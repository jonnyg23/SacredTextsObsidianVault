 <p><font size="-1">Arrival of the expedition at Mombas. Bacchus plots their destruction by new artifices. They are deceived into the belief that the natives are, like themselves, Christians: Bacchus assumes the character of a priest, and worships the god of the Christians. At the invitation of the king of Mombas, GAMA enters the port, and reaches the place intended for his destruction. Venus, aided by the Nereids, effects their deliverance; and GAMA sails away, fearing treachery. Venus hastens to Olympus to seek Jove’s aid. Jupiter assures her of the future glory of the Portuguese, and commands Mercury to conduct the expedition to Melinda. The king of Melinda asks from GAMA an historical account of his nation.</font></p>  
 <p>THE fervent lustre of the evening ray<br> Behind the western hills now died away,<br> And night, ascending from the dim-brow’d east,<br> The twilight gloom with deeper shades increas’d,<br> When GAMA heard the creaking of the oar,<br> And mark’d the white waves length’ning from the shore.<br> In many a skiff the eager natives came,<br> Their semblance friendship, but deceit their aim.<br> And now by GAMA’s anchor’d ships they ride,<br> And "Hail, illustrious chief!" their leader cried,<br> "Your fame already these our regions own,<br> How your bold prows from worlds to us unknown<br> Have brav’d the horrors of the southern main,<br> Where storms and darkness hold their endless reign,<br> Whose whelmy waves our westward prows have barr’d<br> From oldest times, and ne’er before were dar’d</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>By boldest leader: earnest to behold<br> The wondrous hero of a toil so bold,<br> To you the sov’reign of these islands sends<br> The holy vows of peace, and hails you friends.<br> If friendship you accept, whate’er kind Heaven<br> In various bounty to these shores has given,<br> Whate’er your wants, your wants shall here supply,<br> And safe in port your gallant fleet shall lie;<br> Safe from the dangers of the faithless tide,<br> And sudden bursting storms, by you untried;<br> Yours every bounty of the fertile shore,<br> Till balmy rest your wearied strength restore.<br> Or, if your toils and ardent hopes demand<br> The various treasures of the Indian strand,<br> The fragrant cinnamon, the glowing clove,<br> And all the riches of the spicy grove;<br> Or drugs of power the fever’s rage to bound,<br> And give soft languor to the smarting wound;<br> Or, if the splendour of the diamond’s rays,<br> The sapphire’s azure, or the ruby’s blaze,<br> Invite your sails to search the Eastern world,<br> Here may these sails in happy hour be furl’d:<br> For here the splendid treasures of the mine,<br> And richest offspring of the field combine<br> To give each boon that human want requires,<br> And every gem that lofty pride desires;<br> Then here, a potent king your gen’rous friend,<br> Here let your perilous toils and wandering searches <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">1</font></a> end."</p>  
 <p>  He said: brave GAMA smiles with heart sincere,<br> And prays the herald to the king to bear<br> The thanks of grateful joy: "But now," he cries,<br> "The black’ning evening veils the coast and skies, <br> And thro’ these rocks unknown forbids to steer;<br> Yet, when the streaks of milky dawn appear,<br> Edging the eastern wave with silver hoar,<br> My ready prows shall gladly point to shore;</p>

 <p>Assur’d of friendship, and a kind retreat,<br> Assur’d and proffer’d by a king so great."<br> Yet, mindful still of what his hopes had cheer’d,<br> That here his nation’s holy shrines were rear’d,<br> He asks, if certain, as the pilot told,<br> Messiah’s lore had flourish’d there of old,<br> And flourish’d still. The herald mark’d with joy<br> The pious wish, and, watchful to decoy,<br> "Messiah here," he cries, "has altars more<br> Than all the various shrines of other lore."<br> O’erjoy’d, brave VASCO heard the pleasing tale,<br> Yet fear’d that fraud its viper-sting might veil<br> Beneath the glitter of a show so fair.<br> He half believes the tale, and arms against the snare.</p>  
 <p>  With GAMA sail’d a bold advent’rous band, <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Whose headlong rage had urg’d the guilty hand:<br> Stern Justice for their crimes had ask’d their blood,<br> And pale, in chains condemn’d to death, they stood;<br> But, sav’d by GAMA from the shameful death,<br> The bread of peace had seal’d their plighted faith <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The desolate coast, when order’d, to explore,<br> And dare each danger of the hostile shore:<br> From this bold band he chose the subtlest two,<br> The port, the city, and its strength to view,</p>

 <p>To mark if fraud its secret head betray’d,<br> Or if the rites of Heaven were there display’d.<br> With costly gifts, as of their truth secure,<br> The pledge that GAMA deem’d their faith was pure.<br> These two, his heralds, to the king he sends:<br> The faithless Moors depart as smiling friends.<br> Now, thro’ the wave they cut their foamy way,<br> Their cheerful songs resounding through the bay:<br> And now, on shore the wond’ring natives greet,<br> And fondly hail the strangers from the fleet.<br> The prince their gifts with friendly vows receives,<br> And joyful welcome to the Lusians gives;<br> Where’er they pass, the joyful tumult bends,<br> And through the town the glad applause attends.<br> But he whose cheeks with youth immortal shone,<br> The god whose wondrous birth two mothers <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a> own,<br> Whose rage had still the wand’ring fleet annoy’d,<br> Now in the town his guileful rage employ’d.<br> A Christian priest he seem’d; a sumptuous <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">2</font></a> shrine<br> He rear’d, and tended with the rites divine:<br> O’er the fair altar wav’d the cross on high,<br> Upheld by angels leaning from the sky;<br> Descending o’er the Virgin’s sacred head<br> So white, so pure, the Holy Spirit spread<br> The dove-like pictur’d wings, so pure, so white;<br> And, hov’ring o’er the chosen twelve, alight<br> The tongues of hallow’d fire. Amaz’d, oppress’d,<br> With sacred awe their troubled looks confess’d<br> The inspiring godhead, and the prophet’s glow,<br> Which gave each language from their lips to flow</p>

 <p>During the reign of Emmanuel, and his predecessor John II., few criminals were executed in Portugal. These great and political princes employed the lives which were forfeited to the public in the most dangerous undertakings of public utility. In their foreign expeditions the condemned criminals were sent upon the most hazardous undertakings. If death was their fate, it was the punishment they had merited: if successful in what was required, their crimes were expiated; and often they rendered their country the greatest atonement for their guilt which men in their circumstances could possibly make. What multitudes every year, in the prime of their life, end their days in Great Britain by the hands of the executioner! That the legislature <i>might</i> devise means to make the greatest part of these lives useful to society is a fact, which surely cannot be disputed; though, perhaps, the remedy of an evil so shocking to humanity may be at some distance.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_121">34:2</a> When GAMA lay at anchor among the islands of St. George, near Mozambique, "there came three Ethiopians on board (says Faria y Sousa) who, seeing St. Gabriel painted on the poop, fell on their knees in token of their Christianity, which had been preached to them in the primitive times, though now corrupted." Barros, c. 4, and Castaneda, l. i. c. 9, report, that the Portuguese found two or three Abyssinian Christians in the city of Mombas, who had an oratory in their house. The following short account of the Christians of the East may perhaps be acceptable. In the south parts of Malabar, about 200,000 of the inhabitants professed Christianity before the arrival of the Portuguese. They use the Syriac language in their services, and read the Scriptures in that tongue, and call themselves Christians of St. Thomas, by which apostle their ancestors had been converted. For 1300 years they had been under the Patriarch of Babylon, who appointed their <i>Mutran</i>, or archbishop. Dr. Geddes, in his History of the Church of Malabar, relates that Francisco Roz, a Jesuit missionary, complained to Menezes, the Portuguese archbishop of Goa, that when he showed these people an image of the Virgin Mary, they cried out, "Away with that filthiness, we are Christians, and do not adore idols."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_122"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_123">35:2</a> <i>Proud of her kindred birth</i>.--The French translator has the following note on this place: "This is one of the places which discover our author’s intimate acquaintance with mythology, and at the same time how much attention his allegory requires. Many readers, on finding that the protectress of the Lusians sprung from the sea, would be apt to exclaim, Behold, the birth of the terrestrial Venus! How can a nativity so infamous be ascribed to the celestial Venus, who represents Religion? I answer, that Camoëns had not his eye on those fables. which derive the birth of Venus from the foam of the waves, mixed with the blood which flowed from the dishonest wound of Saturn: he carries his views higher; his Venus is from a fable more noble. Nigidius relates that two fishes one day conveyed an egg to the seashore. This egg was hatched by two pigeons whiter than snow, and gave birth to the Assyrian Venus, which, in the pagan theology, is the same with the celestial. She instructed mankind in religion, gave them the lessons of virtue and the laws of equity. Jupiter, in reward of her labours, promised to grant her whatever she desired. She prayed him to give immortality to the two fishes, who had been instrumental in her birth, and the fishes were <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a> accordingly placed in the Zodiac, the sign Pisces. . . This fable agrees perfectly with Religion, as I could clearly show; but I think it more proper to leave to the ingenious reader the pleasure of tracing the allegory."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_123"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_124">36:1</a> <i>Doto, Nyse, and Nerine</i>.--Cloto, or Clotho, as Castera observes, has by some error crept into almost all the Portuguese editions of the Lusiad.

 <p><a name="fn_126"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_127">37:3</a> Latona, says the fable, flying from the serpent Python, and faint with thirst, came to a pond, where some Lycian peasants were cutting the bulrushes. In revenge of the insults which they offered her in preventing her to drink, she changed them into frogs. This fable, says Castera, like almost all the rest, is drawn from history. Philocorus, as cited by Boccace, relates, that the Rhodians having declared war against the Lycians, were assisted by some troops from Delos, who carried the image of Latona on their standards. A detachment <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a> of these going to drink at a lake in Lycia, a crowd of peasants endeavoured to prevent them. An encounter ensued; the peasants fled to the lake for shelter, and were there slain. Some months afterwards their companions came in search of their corpses, and finding an unusual quantity of frogs, imagined, according to the superstition of their age, that the souls of their friends appeared to them under that metamorphosis.</p>  
 <p>To some it may, perhaps, appear needless to vindicate Camoëns, in a point wherein he is supported by the authority of Homer and Virgil. Yet, as many readers are infected with the <i>sang froid</i> of a Bossu or a Perrault, an observation in defence of our poet cannot be thought impertinent. If we examine the finest effusions of genius, we shall find that the most genuine poetical feeling has often dictated those similes which are drawn from familiar and low objects. The sacred writers, and the greatest poets of every nation, have used them. We may, therefore, conclude that the criticism which condemns them is a refinement not founded on nature. But, allowing them admissible, it must be observed, that to render them pleasing requires a peculiar happiness and delicacy of management. When the poet attains this indispensable point, he gives a striking proof of his elegance, and of his mastership in his art. That the similes of the emmets and of the frogs in Camoëns are happily expressed and applied, is indisputable. In that of the frogs there is a peculiar propriety, both in the comparison itself, and in the allusion to the fable, as it was the intent of the poet to represent not only the flight, but the baseness of the Moors. The simile he seems to have copied from Dante, Inf. Cant. 9--</p>

 <p><a name="fn_127"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_128">39:1</a> Barros and Castaneda, in relating this part of the voyage of Gama, say that the fleet, just as they were entering the port of Mombas. were driven back as it were by an invisible hand.

 <p><a name="fn_130"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_131">40:2</a> "I am aware of the objection, that this passage is by no means applicable to the celestial Venus. I answer once for all, that the names and adventures of the pagan divinities are so blended and uncertain in mythology, that a poet is at great liberty to adapt <a href="errata.htm#1">them</a> to his allegory as ho pleases. Even the fables, which may appear as profane, even these contain historical, physical, and moral truths, which fully atone for the seeming licentiousness of the letter. I could prove this in many instances, but let the present suffice. Paris, son of Priam, king of Troy, spent his first years as a shepherd in the country. At this time Juno, Minerva, and Venus disputed for the apple of gold, which was destined to be given to the most beautiful goddess. They consented that Paris should be their judge. His equity claimed this honour. He saw them all naked. Juno promised him riches, Minerva the sciences, but he decided in favour of Venus, who promised him the possession of the most beautiful woman. What a ray of light is contained in this philosophical fable! Paris represents a studious man, who, in the silence of solitude, seeks the supreme good. Juno is the emblem of riches and dignities; Minerva, that of the sciences purely human; Venus is that of religion, which contains the sciences both human and divine; the charming female, which she promises to the Trojan shepherd, is that divine wisdom which gives tranquillity of heart. A judge so philosophical as Paris would not hesitate a moment to whom to give the apple of gold."--CASTERA.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_131"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_132">40:3</a> "The allegory of Camoëns is here obvious. If Acteon, and the <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a> slaves of their violent passions, could discover the beauties of true religion, they would be astonished and reclaimed: according to the expression of Seneca, ‘Si virtus cerni posset oculis corporeis, omnes ad amorem suum pelliceret.’"--CASTERA.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_132"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_133">41:1</a> "That is Divine love, which always accompanies religion. Behold how our author insinuates the excellence of his moral!"--CASTERA.</p>  
 <p>As the French translator has acknowledged, there is no doubt but several readers will be apt to decry this allegorical interpretation of the machinery of Camoëns. Indeed there is nothing more easy than to discover a system of allegory in the simplest narrative. The reign of Henry VIII. is as susceptible of it as any fable in the heathen mythology. Nay, perhaps, more so. Under the names of Henry, More, Wolsey, Cromwell, Pole, Cranmer, etc., all the war of the passions, with their different catastrophes, might be delineated. Though it may be difficult to determine how far, yet one may venture to affirm that Homer and Virgil sometimes allegorised. The poets, however, who wrote on the revival of letters have left us in no doubt; we have their own authority for it that their machinery is allegorical. Not only the pagan deities, but the more modern adventures of enchantment were used by them to delineate the affections, and the trials and rewards of the virtues and vices. Tasso published a treatise to prove that his <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> is no other than the Christian spiritual warfare. And Camoëns, as observed in the preface, has twice asserted that his machinery is allegorical. The poet’s assertion, and the taste of the age in which he wrote, sufficiently vindicate and explain the allegory of the Lusiad.</p>

In 1524, when sailing thither to take possession of his government, his fleet was so becalmed on the coast of Cambaya that the ships stood motionless on the water, when in an instant, without the least change of the weather, the waves were shaken with a violent agitation, like trembling. The ships were tossed about, the sailors were terrified, and in the utmost confusion, thinking themselves lost. Gama, perceiving it to be the effect of an earthquake, with his wonted heroism and prudence, exclaimed, "<i>Of what are you afraid? Do you not see how the ocean trembles under its sovereigns!</i>" Barros, l. 9. c. 1, and Faria, c. 9, say, that such as lay sick of fevers were cured by the fright.</p>

However, I submitted to the opinion of some friends, who were afraid that the ears of Frenchmen would be shocked at the word <i>business</i> applied to a king.

 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="lusbk02.htm#fr_168">53:1</a> The propriety and artfulness of Homer’s speeches have been often and justly admired. Camoëns is peculiarly happy in the same department of the Epopæa. The speech of Gama’s herald to the King of Melinda is a striking instance of it. The compliments with which it begins have a direct tendency to the favours afterwards to be asked. The assurances of the innocence, the purpose of the voyagers, and the greatness of their king, are happily touched. The exclamation on the barbarous treatment they had experienced--"Not wisdom saved us, but Heaven’s own care"--are masterly insinuations. Their barbarous treatment is again repeated in a manner to move compassion: Alas! what could they fear? etc., is reasoning joined with pathos. That they were conducted to the King of Melinda by Heaven, and were by Heaven assured of his truth, is a most delicaté compliment, and in the true spirit of the epic poem. The apology for Gama’s refusal to come on shore is exceeding artful. It conveys a proof of the greatness of the Portuguese sovereign, and affords a compliment to loyalty, which could not fail to be acceptable to a monarch.</p>
