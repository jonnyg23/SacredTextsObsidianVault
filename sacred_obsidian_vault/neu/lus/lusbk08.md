 <p><font size="-1">Description of the pictures, given by Paulus. The heroes of Portugal, from Lusus, one of the companions of Bacchus (who gave his name to Portugal), and Ulysses, the founder of Lisbon, down to Don Pedro and Don Henrique (Henry), the conquerors of Ceuta, are all represented in the portraits of Gama, and are characterized by appropriate verses. Meanwhile the zamorim has recourse to the oracles of his false gods, who make him acquainted with the future dominion of the Portuguese over India, and the consequent ruin of his empire. The Mohammedan Arabs conspire against the Portuguese. The zamorim questions the truth of Gama’s statement, and charges him with being captain of a band of pirates. Gama is obliged to give up to the Indians the whole of his merchandise as ransom, when he obtains permission to re-embark. He seizes several merchants of Calicut, whom he detains on board his ship as hostages for his two factors, who were on land to sell his merchandise. He afterwards liberates the natives, whom he exchanges for his two companions. In Mickle’s translation this portion of the original is omitted, and the factors are released in consequence of a victory gained by Gama.</font></p>

 <p><font size="-1">We have already seen the warm encomium paid by Tasso to his contemporary, Camoëns. That great poet, the ornament of Italy, has also testified his approbation by several imitations of the Lusiad. Virgil, in no instance, has more closely copied Homer, than Tasso has imitated the appearance of Bacchus, or the evil demon, in the dream of the Moorish priest. The enchanter Ismeno thus appears to the sleeping Solyman:--</font></p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Soliman’ Solimano, i tuoi silenti<br> Riposi à miglior tempo homai riserva: <a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a><br> Che sotto it giogo de straniere genti<br> La patria, ove regnasti, ancor’ e serva.<br> In questa terra dormi, e non rammenti,<br> Ch’ insepolte de’ tuoi l’ossa conserva?<br> Ove si gran’ vestigio e del tuo scorno,<br> Tu neghittoso aspetti it nuovo giorno?"</font></dir>  
 <p>Thus elegantly translated by Mr. Hoole:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Oh! Solyman, regardless chief, awake!<br> In happier hours thy grateful slumber take:<br> Beneath a foreign yoke thy subjects bend,<br> And strangers o’er thy land their rule extend;<br> Here dost thou sleep? here close thy careless eyes,<br> While uninterr’d each lov’d associate lies?<br> Here where thy fame has felt the hostile scorn,<br> Canst thou, unthinking, wait the rising morn?"</font></dir>  
 <p>The conclusion of this canto has been slightly altered by the translator. Camoëns, adhering to history, makes GAMA (when his factors are detained on shore) seize upon some of the native merchants as hostages. At the intreaty of their wives and children the zamorim liberates his captives; while GAMA, having recovered his men and the merchandise, sailed away, carrying with him the unfortunate natives, whom he had seized as hostages.</p>  
 <p>As there is nothing heroic in this dishonourable action of GAMA’S, Mickle has omitted it, and has altered the conclusion of the canto.--<i>Ed</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_501"></a><a href="lusbk08.htm#fr_506">223:2</a> <i>In those fair lawns the bless’d Elysium feign’d</i>.--In this assertion our author has the authority of Strabo, a foundation sufficient for a poet. Nor are there wanting several Spanish writers, particularly Barbosa, who seriously affirm that Homer drew the fine description of Elysium, in his fourth Odyssey, from the beautiful valleys of Spain, where, in one of his voyages, they say, he arrived. Egypt, however, seems to have a better title to this honour. The fable of Charon, and the judges of hell, are evidently borrowed from the Egyptian rites of burial, and are older than Homer. After a ferryman had conveyed the corpse over a lake, certain judges examined the life of the deceased, particularly his claim to the virtue of loyalty, and, according to the report, decreed or refused the honours of sepulture. The place of the catacombs, according to Diodorus Siculus, was surrounded with deep canals, beautiful meadows, and a wilderness of groves. It is universally known that the greatest part of the Grecian fables were fabricated from the customs and opinions of Egypt. Several other nations have also claimed the honour of affording the idea of the fields of the blessed. Even the Scotch challenge it. Many Grecian fables, says an author of that country, are evidently founded on the reports of the Phœnician sailors. That these navigators traded to the coasts of Britain is certain. In the middle of summer, the season when the ancients performed their voyages, for about six weeks there is no night over the Orkney Islands; the disk of the sun, during that time, scarcely sinking below the horizon. This appearance, together with the calm which usually prevails at that <a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a> season, and the beautiful verdure of the islands, could not fail to excite the admiration of the Phœnicians; and their accounts of the place naturally afforded the idea that these islands were inhabited by the spirits of the just. This, says our author, is countenanced by Homer, who places his "islands of the happy" at the extremity of the ocean. That the fables of Scylla, the Gorgones, and several others, were founded on the accounts of navigators, seems probable; and, on this supposition, the Insulæ Fortunatæ, and Purpurariæ, now the Canary and Madeira islands, also claim the honour of giving colours to the description of Elysium. The truth, however, appears to be this: That a place of happiness is reserved for the spirits of the good is the natural suggestion of that anxiety and hope concerning the future which animates the human breast. All the barbarous nations of Africa and America agree in placing their heaven in beautiful islands, at an immense distance over the ocean. The idea is universal, and is natural to every nation in a state of barbarous simplicity.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_535"></a><a href="lusbk08.htm#fr_540">235:3</a> <i>The glorious Henry</i>.--In pursuance of the reasons assigned in the preface, the translator has here taken the liberty to make a transposition in the order of his author. In Camoëns, Don Pedro de Menezes, and his son De Vian, conclude the description of the pictured ensigns. Don Henry, the greatest man perhaps that ever Portugal produced, has certainly the best title to close this procession of the Lusian heroes. And, as he was the father of navigation, particularly of the voyage of GAMA, to sum up the narrative with his encomium has even some critical propriety. [These</p>  
 <p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a></p>  
 <p>These observations were suggested by the conduct of Camoëns, whose design, like that of Virgil, was to write a poem which might contain all the triumphs of his country. As the shield of Æneas supplies what could not be introduced in the vision of Elysium, so the ensigns of GAMA complete the purpose of the third and fourth Lusiads. The use of that long episode, the conversation with the King of Melinda, and its connection with the subject, have been already observed. The seeming episode of the pictures, while it fulfils the promise--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1"><i>And all my country’s wars the song adorn</i>,</font></dir>  
 <p>is also admirably connected with the conduct of the poem. The Hindoos naturally desire to be informed of the country, the history, and power of their foreign visitors, and Paulus sets it before their eyes. In every progression of the scenery the business of the poem advances. The regent and his attendants are struck with the warlike grandeur and power of the strangers, and to accept of their friendship, or to prevent the forerunners of so martial a nation from carrying home the tidings of the discovery of India, becomes the great object of their consideration.</p>

This seemed to the translator as an impropriety, and contrary to the purpose of the whole speech of Paulus, which was to give the catual a high idea of Portugal. In the fate of the imaginary painter, the Lusian poet gives us the picture of his own, and resentment wrung this impropriety from him. The spirit of the complaint, however, is preserved in the translation. The couplet--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Immortal fame his deathless labours gave;<br> Poor man, he sunk neglected to the grave!"</font></dir>

The literal English is, As the sun may be beheld at its rising, but, when illustriously kindled, cannot. Naked, however, as this is. the imitation of Camoëns is evident. As Castera is so very bold in his encomium of this fine simile of the sun, it is but justice to add his translation of it, together with the original Portuguese, and the translation of Fanshaw. Thus the French translator:--</p>  
 <p><i>Les yeux peuvent soûtenir la clarté du soleil naissant, mais lorsqu’il s’est avancé dans sa carrière lumineuse, et que ses rayons répandent les ardeurs du midi, on tacherait en vain de l’envisager; un prompt aveuglement serait le prix de cette audace</i>.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The Brahmins, the diviners of India. Ammianus Marcellinus, l. 23, says, that the Persian Magi derived their knowledge from the Brachmanes of India. And Arrianus, l. 7, expressly gives the Brahmins the name of Magi. The Magi of India, says he, told Alexander, on his pretensions to divinity, that in everything he was like other men, except that he took less rest, and did more mischief. The Brahmins are never among modern writers called Magi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_540"></a><a href="lusbk08.htm#fr_545">240:2</a> <i>The hov’ring demon gives the dreadful sign</i>.--This has an allusion to the truth of history. Barros relates, that an augur being brought before the Zamorim, "<i>Em hum vaso de agua l’he mostrara hunas naos, que vin ham de muy longe para a India, e que a gente d’ellas seria total</i> <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a> <i>destruiçam dos Mouros de aquellas partes</i>.--In a vessel of water he showed him some ships which from a great distance came to India, the people of which would effect the utter subversion of the Moors." Camoëns has certainly chosen a more poetical method of describing this divination, a method in the spirit of Virgil; nor in this is he inferior to his great master. The supernatural flame which seizes on Lavinia while assisting at the sacrifice alone excepted, every other part of the augury of Latinus, and his dream in the Albunean forest, whither he went to consult his ancestor, the god Faunus, in dignity and poetical colouring, cannot come in comparison with the divination of the Magi, and the appearance of the demon in the dream of the Moorish priest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_541"></a><a href="lusbk08.htm#fr_546">241:1</a> <i>Th’ eternal yoke</i>.--This picture, it may perhaps be said, is but a bad compliment to the heroes of the Lusiad, and the fruits of their discovery. A little consideration, however, will vindicate Camoëns. It is the demon and the enemies of the Portuguese who procure this divination; everything in it is dreadful, on purpose to determine the zamorim to destroy the fleet of GAMA. In a former prophecy of the conquest of India (when the catual describes the sculpture of the royal palace), our poet has been careful to ascribe the happiest effects to the discovery of his heroes:--</p>

 <p></p><dir><font size="-1"><i>The Moors-----their ancient deeds relate,<br> Their ever faithful service of the state</i>.--</font></dir>  
 <p>An explanation of the word <i>Moor</i> is here necessary. When the East afforded no more field for the sword of the conqueror, the Saracens, assisted by the Moors, who had embraced their religion, laid the finest countries in Europe in blood and desolation. As their various embarkations were from the empire of Morocco, the <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a> Europeans gave the name of Moors to all the professors of the Mohammedan religion. In the same manner the eastern nations blended all the armies of the Crusaders under one appellation, and the Franks, of whom the army of Godfrey was mostly composed, became their common name for all the inhabitants of the West. Before the arrival of GAMA, as already observed, all the traffic of the East, from the Ethiopian side of Africa to China, was in the hands of Arabian Mohammedans, who, without incorporating with the pagan natives, had their colonies established in every country commodious for commerce. These the Portuguese called Moors; and at present the Mohammedans of India are called the Moors of Hindostan by our English writers. The intelligence these Moors gave to one another, relative to the actions of GAMA; the general terror with which they beheld the appearance of Europeans, whose rivalship they dreaded as the destruction of their power; the various frauds and arts they employed to prevent the return of one man of GAMA’S fleet to Europe, and their threat to withdraw from the dominions of the zamorim, are all according to the truth of history. The speeches of the zamorim and of GAMA, which follow, are also founded in truth.</p>

This opinion, however, deceived them. In Melinda and in Calicut they found civilized nations, where the arts flourished; who wanted nothing; who were possessed of all the refinements and delicacies on which we value ourselves. The King of Melinda had the generosity to be contented with the present which GAMA made; but the zamorim, with a disdainful eye, beheld the gifts which were offered to him. The present was this: Four mantles of scarlet, six hats adorned with feathers, four chaplets of coral beads, twelve Turkey carpets, seven drinking cups of brass, a chest of sugar, two barrels of oil, and two of honey."--CASTERA.</p>

 <p>The resemblance of this couplet to many passages in Homer, must be obvious to the intelligent critic.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="lusbk08.htm#fr_556">249:1</a> <i>As in the sun’s bright beam</i>.--Imitated from Virgil, who, by the same simile, describes the fluctuation of the thoughts of Æneas, on the eve of the Latian war:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">               "Laomedontius heros<br> Cuncta videns, magno curarum fluctuat æstu,<br> Atque animum nunc huc celerem, nunc dividit illuc,<br> In partesque rapit varias, perque omnia versat.<br> Sicut aquæ tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis<br> Sole repercussum, aut radiantis imagine Lunæ,<br> Omnia pervolitat late loca: jamque sub auras<br> Erigitur, summique ferit laquearia tecti."  
 <p>"This way and that he turns his anxious mind,<br> Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design’d;<br> Explores himself in vain, in ev’ry part,<br> And gives no rest to his distracted heart:<br> So when the sun by day or moon by night<br> Strike on the polish’d brass their trembling light,<br> The glitt’ring species here and there divide,<br> And cast their dubious beams from side to side;<br> Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,<br> And to the ceiling flash the glaring day."<br>                                                       [Ariosto</p></font></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a></p>  
 <p>Ariosto has also adopted this simile in the eighth book of his Orlando Furioso:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Qual d’acqua chiara it tremolante lume<br> Dal Sol per percossa, o da’ notturni rai,<br> Per gli ampli tetti và con lungo salto<br> A destra, ed a sinistra, e basso, ed alto."  
 <p>"So from a water clear, the trembling light<br> Of Phoebus, or the silver ray of night,<br> Along the spacious rooms with splendour plays,<br> Now high, now low, and shifts a thousand ways."<br>                                                          HOOLE.</p></font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> But the happiest circumstance belongs to Camoëns. The velocity and various shiftings of the sun-beam, reflected from a piece of crystal or polished steel in the hand of a boy, give a much stronger idea of the violent agitation and sudden shiftings of thought than the image of the trembling light of the sun or moon reflected from a vessel of water. The brazen vessel, however, and not the water, is only mentioned by Dryden. Nor must another inaccuracy pass unobserved. That the reflection of the moon <i>flashed the glaring day</i> is not countenanced by the original.</p>
