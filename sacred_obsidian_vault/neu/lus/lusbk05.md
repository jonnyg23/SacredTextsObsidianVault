 <p><font size="-1">Departure of the expedition under the command of VASCO DE GAMA (A.D. 1497). Mountains of Portugal, Cintra, Morocco. Madeira; the burning shores of the Desert of Zanhagan; passage of the Tropic; cold waters of the dark river Senegal. San Jago; pass the rocky coasts of Sierra Leone, the island of St. Thomas, the kingdom of Congo, watered by the great river Zaire. They cross the line and behold the magnificent constellation of the Southern Cross, not visible in the northern hemisphere. After a voyage of five months, with continued storms, they arrive in the latitude of the Cape. Apparition of Adamastor, the giant of the Cape of Storms. His prophecy. The King of Melinda confirms, by the tradition of his people, the weird story of the Cape-giant told him by GAMA. Narrative of the voyage continued; arrival of the expedition at the Port of Good Promise; pass by the ports of Mozambique and Mombas, and arrive at Melinda.</font></p>  
 <p>WHILE on the beach the hoary father stood,<br> And spoke the murmurs of the multitude,<br> We spread the canvas to the rising gales,<br> The gentle winds distend the snowy sails.<br> As from our dear-lov’d native shore we fly<br> Our votive shouts, redoubled, rend the sky;<br> "Success, success!" far echoes o’er the tide,<br> While our broad hulks the foamy waves divide.<br> From Leo <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">1</font></a> now, the lordly star of day,<br> Intensely blazing, shot his fiercest ray;<br> When, slowly gliding from our wishful eyes,<br> The Lusian mountains mingled with the skies;</p>

 <p>Where the vex’d waves against our bulwarks roar,<br> And Lusian towers o’erlook the bending shore:<br> Our sails wide swelling to the constant blast,<br> Now, by the isle from Thomas nam’d we pass’d;<br> And Congo’s spacious realm before us rose,<br> Where copious Layra’s limpid billow flows;<br> A flood by ancient hero never seen,<br> Where many a temple o’er the banks of green, <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Rear’d by the Lusian heroes, through the night<br> Of pagan darkness, pours the mental light.</p>  
 <p>  O’er the wild waves, as southward thus we stray,<br> Our port unknown, unknown the wat’ry way,<br> Each night we see, impress’ d with solemn awe,<br> Our guiding stars, and native skies withdraw,<br> In the wide void we lose their cheering beams,<br> Lower and lower still the pole-star gleams.<br> Till past the limit, where the car of day<br> Roll’d o’er our heads, and pour’d the downward ray:<br> We now disprove the faith of ancient lore;<br> Boötes shining car appears no more.<br> For here we saw Calisto’s <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">2</font></a> star retire<br> Beneath the waves, unaw’d by Juno’s ire.</p>

 <p>Here, while the sun his polar journeys takes,<br> His visit doubled, double season makes;<br> Stern winter twice deforms the changeful year,<br> And twice the spring’s gay flowers their honours rear.<br> Now, pressing onward, past the burning zone,<br> Beneath another heaven and stars unknown,<br> Unknown to heroes and to sages old,<br> With southward prows our pathless course we hold:<br> Here, gloomy night assumes a darker reign,<br> And fewer stars emblaze the heavenly plain;<br> Fewer than those that gild the northern pole,<br> And o’er our seas their glitt’ring chariots roll:<br> While nightly thus, the lonely seas we brave,<br> Another pole-star <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">1</font></a> rises o’er the wave:<br> Full to the south a shining cross <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">2</font></a> appears,<br> Our heaving breasts the blissful omen cheers:<br> Seven radiant stars compose the hallow’d sign<br> That rose still higher o’er the wavy brine.<br> Beneath this southern axle of the world<br> Never, with daring search, was flag unfurl’d;<br> Nor pilot knows if bounding shores are plac’d,<br> Or, if one dreary sea o’erflow the lonely waste.</p>

 <p>Still, gulp on gulp in sucks the rising tide,<br> And now the cloud, with cumbrous weight supplied,<br> Full-gorg’d, and black’ning, spreads, and moves, more slow,<br> And waving trembles to the waves below.<br> Thus, when to shun the summer’s sultry beam<br> The thirsty heifer seeks the cooling stream,<br> The eager horse-leech fixing on her lips,<br> Her blood with ardent throat insatiate sips,<br> Till the gorg’d glutton, swell’d beyond her size,<br> Drops from her wounded hold, and bursting, dies.<br> So, bursts the cloud, o’erloaded with its freight,<br> And the dash’d ocean staggers with the weight.<br> But say, ye sages, who can weigh the cause,<br> And trace the secret springs of nature’s laws,<br> Say, why the wave, of bitter brine erewhile,<br> Should to the bosom of the deep recoil<br> Robb’d of its salt, and, from the cloud distil,<br> Sweet as the waters of the limpid <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">1</font></a> rill?<br> Ye sons of boastful wisdom, famed of yore,<br> Whose feet unwearied wander’d many a shore,<br> From nature’s wonders to withdraw the veil,<br> Had you with me unfurl’d the daring sail,<br> Had view’d the wondrous scenes mine eyes survey’d,<br> What seeming miracles the deep display’d,<br> What secret virtues various nature show’d,<br> Oh! heaven! with what a fire your page had glow’d!</p>

 <p>Five times the changeful empress of the night<br> Had fill’d her shining horns with silver light,<br> When sudden, from the maintop’s airy round,<br> "Land! land!" is echoed. At the joyful sound,<br> Swift to the crowded decks the bounding crew<br> On wings of hope and flutt’ring transport flew,<br> And each strain’d eye with aching sight explores<br> The wide horizon of the eastern shores:<br> As thin blue clouds the mountain summits rise,<br> And now, the lawns salute our joyful eyes;<br> Loud through the fleet the echoing shouts prevail,<br> We drop the anchor, and restrain the sail;<br> And now, descending in a spacious bay,<br> Wide o’er the coast the vent’rous soldiers stray,<br> To spy the wonders of the savage shore,<br> Where stranger’s foot had never trod before.<br> I and my pilots, on the yellow sand,<br> Explore beneath what sky the shores expand.<br> That sage device, whose wondrous use proclaims<br> Th’ immortal honour of its authors’ <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">1</font></a> names,<br> The sun’s height measured, and my compass scann’d,<br> The painted globe of ocean and of land.<br> Here we perceiv’d our vent’rous keels had past<br> Unharm’d the southern tropic’s howling blast;<br> And now, approach’d dread Neptune’s secret reign,<br> Where the stern power, as o’er the austral main<br> He rides, wide scatters from the polar star<br> Hail, ice, and snow, and all the wintry war.<br> While thus attentive on the beach we stood,<br> My soldiers, hast’ning from the upland wood,<br> Right to the shore a trembling negro brought,<br> Whom, on the forest-height, by force they caught,<br> As, distant wander’d from the cell of home,<br> He suck’d the honey from the porous comb.</p>

 <p>Horror glar’d in his look, and fear extreme,<br> In mien more wild than brutal Polypheme:<br> No word of rich Arabia’s tongue <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">1</font></a> he knew,<br> No sign could answer, nor our gems would view:<br> From garments strip’d with shining gold he turn’d,<br> The starry diamond and the silver spurn’d.<br> Straight at my nod are worthless trinkets brought;<br> Round beads of crystal, as a bracelet wrought,<br> A cap of red, and, dangling on a string,<br> Some little bells of brass before him ring:<br> A wide-mouth’d laugh confess’d his barb’rous joy,<br> And, both his hands he raised to grasp the toy.<br> Pleas’d with these gifts, we set the savage free,<br> Homeward he springs away, and bounds with glee.</p>  
 <p>  Soon as the gleamy streaks of purple morn<br> The lofty forest’s topmost boughs adorn,<br> Down the steep mountain’s side, yet hoar with dew,<br> A naked crowd, and black as night their hue,<br> Come tripping to the shore: Their wishful eyes<br> Declare what tawdry trifles most they prize:<br> These to their hopes were given, and, void of fear<br> (Mild seem’d their manners, and their looks sincere),<br> A bold rash youth, ambitious of the fame<br> Of brave adventurer, Velosó his name,<br> Through pathless brakes their homeward steps attends,<br> And, on his single arm, for help depends.<br> Long was his stay: my earnest eyes explore,<br> When, rushing down the mountain to the shore<br> I mark’d him; terror urged his rapid strides,<br> And soon Coëllo’s skiff the wave divides.<br> Yet, ere his friends advanc’d, the treach’rous foe<br> Trod on his latest steps, and aim’d the blow.<br> Moved by the danger of a youth so brave,<br> Myself now snatch’d an oar, and sprung to save:<br> When sudden, black’ning down the mountain’s height,<br> Another crowd pursu’d his panting flight;<br> And, soon an arrowy, and a flinty shower<br> Thick o’er our heads the fierce barbarians pour.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>  
 <p>Nor pour’d in vain; a feather’d arrow stood<br> Fix’d <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">1</font></a> in my leg, and drank the gushing blood.<br> Vengeance, as sudden, ev’ry wound repays,<br> Full on their fronts our flashing lightnings blaze<br> Their shrieks of horror instant pierce the sky,<br> And, wing’d with fear, at fullest speed they fly.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>Long tracks of gore their scatter’d flight betray’d,<br> And now, Velosó to the fleet convey’d,<br> His sportful mates his brave exploits demand,<br> And what the curious wonders of the land:<br> "Hard was the hill to climb, my valiant friend,<br> But oh! how smooth and easy to descend!<br> Well hast thou prov’d thy swiftness for the chase,<br> And shown thy matchless merit in the race!"<br> With look unmov’d the gallant youth replied,<br> "For you, my friends, my fleetest speed was tried;<br> ’Twas you the fierce barbarians meant to slay;<br> For you I fear’d the fortune of the day;<br> Your danger great without mine aid I knew,<br> And, swift as lightning, to your rescue flew." <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>He now the treason of the foe relates,<br> How, soon as past the mountain’s upland straits,<br> They chang’d the colour of their friendly show,<br> And force forbade his steps to tread below:<br> How, down the coverts of the steepy brake<br> Their lurking stand a treach’rous ambush take;<br> On us, when speeding to defend his flight,<br> To rush, and plunge us in the shades of night;<br> Nor, while in friendship, would their lips unfold<br> Where India’s ocean laved the orient shores of gold.</p>  
 <p>  Now, prosp’rous gales the bending canvas swell’d;<br> From these rude shores our fearless course we held:<br> Beneath the glist’ning wave the god of day<br> Had now five times withdrawn the parting ray,<br> When o’er the prow a sudden darkness spread,<br> And, slowly floating o’er the mast’s tall head<br> A black cloud hover’d: nor appear’d from far<br> The moon’s pale glimpse, nor faintly twinkling star;<br> So deep a gloom the low’ring vapour cast,<br> Transfix’d with awe the bravest stood aghast.<br> Meanwhile, a hollow bursting roar resounds,<br> As when hoarse surges lash their rocky mounds;<br> Nor had the black’ning wave, nor frowning heav’n<br> The wonted signs of gath’ring tempest giv’n.<br> Amaz’d we stood. "O thou, our fortune’s guide,<br> Avert this omen, mighty God!" I cried;<br> "Or, through forbidden climes adventurous stray’d,<br> Have we the secrets of the deep survey’d,<br> Which these wide solitudes of seas and sky<br> Were doom’d to hide from man’s unhallow’d eye?<br> Whate’er this prodigy, it threatens more<br> Than midnight tempests, and the mingled roar,<br> When sea and sky combine to rock the marble shore."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a></p>  
 <p>  I spoke, when rising through the darken’d air,<br> Appall’d, we saw a hideous phantom glare;<br> High and enormous o’er the flood he tower’d,<br> And ’thwart our way with sullen aspect lower’d<br> An earthy paleness o’er his cheeks was spread,<br> Erect uprose his hairs of wither’d red;<br> Writhing to speak, his sable lips disclose,<br> Sharp and disjoin’d, his gnashing teeth’s blue rows;<br> His haggard beard How’d quiv’ring on the wind,<br> Revenge and horror in his mien combin’d;<br> His clouded front, by with’ring lightnings scar’d,<br> The inward anguish of his soul declar’d.<br> His red eyes, glowing from their dusky caves,<br> Shot livid fires: far echoing o’er the waves<br> His voice resounded, as the cavern’d shore<br> With hollow groan repeats the tempest’s roar.<br> Cold gliding horrors thrill’d each hero’s breast,<br> Our bristling hair and tott’ring knees confess’d<br> Wild dread, the while with visage ghastly wan,<br> His black lips trembling, thus the fiend began:-- <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>  "O you, the boldest of the nations, fir’d<br> By daring pride, by lust of fame inspir’d,<br> Who, scornful of the bow’rs of sweet repose,<br> Through these my waves advance your fearless prows,<br> Regardless of the length’ning wat’ry way,<br> And all the storms that own my sov’reign sway,<br> Who, mid surrounding rocks and shelves explore<br> Where never hero brav’d my rage before;<br> Ye sons of Lusus, who with eyes profane<br> Have view’d the secrets of my awful reign,<br> Have pass’d the bounds which jealous Nature drew<br> To veil her secret shrine from mortal view;<br> Hear from my lips what direful woes attend,<br> And, bursting soon, shall o’er your race descend.</p>

The latter has other names in the several countries through which it runs. In its course it makes many islands, inhabited only by wild beasts. It is navigable for 150 leagues, at the end of which it is crossed by a stupendous ridge of perpendicular rocks, over which the river rushes with such violence, that travellers pass under it without any other inconvenience than the prodigious noise. The Gambia, or <i>Rio Grande</i>, runs 180 leagues, but is not so <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a> far navigable. It carries more water, and runs with less noise than the other, though filled with many rivers which water the country of Mandinga. Both rivers are branches of the Niger. Their waters have this remarkable quality; when mixed together they operate as an emetic, but when separate do not. They abound with great variety of fishes, and their banks are covered with horses, crocodiles, winged serpents, elephants, ounces, wild boars, with great numbers of others, wonderful for the variety of their nature and different forms.--FARIA Y SOUSA.</p>

A huge rock lay very commodious for a quarry; the workmen began on it; but this rock, as the <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a> devil would have it, happened to be a negro god. The Portuguese were driven away by the enraged worshippers, who were afterwards with difficulty pacified by a profusion of such presents as they most esteemed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_350"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_354">137:1</a> The Portuguese, having brought an ambassador from Congo to Lisbon, sent him back instructed in the faith. By this means the king, queen, and about 100,000 of the people were baptized; the idols were destroyed and churches built. Soon after, the prince, who was then absent at war, was baptized by the name of <i>Alonzo</i>. His younger brother, Aquitimo, however, would not receive the faith, and the father, because allowed only one wife, turned apostate, and left the crown to his pagan son, who, with a great army, surrounded his brother, when only attended by some Portuguese and Christian blacks, in all only thirty-seven. By the bravery of these, however, Aquitimo was defeated, taken, and slain. One of Aquitimo’s officers declared, they were not defeated by the thirty-seven Christians, but by a glorious army who fought under a shining cross. The idols were again destroyed, and Alonzo sent his sons, grandsons, and nephews to Portugal to study; two of whom were afterwards bishops in Congo.--<i>Extracted from</i> Faria y Sousa.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_351"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_355">137:2</a> According to fable, Calisto was a nymph of Diana. Jupiter having assumed the figure of that goddess, completed his amorous desires. On the discovery of her pregnancy, Diana drove her from her train. <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a> She fled to the woods, where she was delivered of a son. Juno changed them into bears, and Jupiter placed them in heaven, where they form the constellations of Ursa Major and Minor. Juno, still enraged, entreated Thetis never to suffer Calisto to bathe in the sea. This is founded on the appearance of the northern pole-star, to the inhabitants of our hemisphere; but, when GAMA approached the austral pole, the northern, of consequence, disappeared under the waves.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_355"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_359">139:2</a> <i>That living fire, by seamen held divine</i>.--The sulphureous vapours of the air, after being violently agitated by a tempest, unite, and when the humidity begins to subside, as is the case when the storm is almost exhausted, by the agitation of their atoms they take fire, and are attracted by the masts and cordage of the ship. Being thus, naturally, the pledges of the approaching calm, it is no wonder that the superstition of sailors should in all ages have esteemed them divine, and--</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> In the expedition of the Golden Fleece, in a violent tempest these fires were seen to hover over the heads of Castor and Pollux, who were two of the Argonauts, and a calm immediately ensued. After the apotheoses of these heroes, the Grecian sailors invoked these fires by the names of Castor and Pollux, or <i>the sons of Jupiter</i>. The Athenians called them Σωτῆρες, <i>Saviours</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_356"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_360">140:1</a> In this book, particularly in the description of Massilia, the Gorgades, the fires called Castor and Pollux, and the water-spout, Camoëns has happily imitated the manner of Lucan. It is probable that Camoëns, in his voyage to the East Indies, was an eye witness of the phenomena of the fires and water-spout. The latter is thus described by Pliny, l. 2. c. 51. <i>Fit et caligo, belluæ similis nubes dira navigantibus vocatur et columna, cum spissatus humor rigensque ipse se sustinet, et in longam veluti fistulam nubes aquam trahit</i>. When the violent heat attracts the waters to rise in the form of a tube, the marine salts are left behind, by the action of rarefaction, being too gross and fixed to ascend. It is thus, when the overloaded vapour bursts, that it descends--</p>

It was invented in Portugal during the reign of John II. by two Jewish physicians, named Roderic and Joseph. It is asserted by some that they were assisted by Martin of Bohemia, a celebrated mathematician. <i>Partly from</i> Castera. Vid. Barros, Dec. 1. lib. iv. c. 2.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_359"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_363">143:1</a> Camoëns, in describing the adventure of Fernando Velosó, by departing from the truth of history, has shown his judgment as a poet. The place where the Portuguese landed they named the Bay of St. Helen. They caught one of two negroes, says Faria, who were busied in gathering honey on a mountain. Their behaviour to this savage, whom they gratified with a red cap, some glasses and bells, induced him to bring a number of his companions for the like trifles. Though some who accompanied GAMA were skilled in the various African languages, not one of the natives could understand them. A commerce, however, was commenced by signs and gestures. GAMA behaved to them with great civility; the fleet was cheerfully supplied with fresh provisions, for which the natives received cloths and trinkets. But this friendship was soon interrupted by a young, rash Portuguese. Having contracted an intimacy with some of the negroes, he obtained leave to penetrate into the country along with them, to observe their habitations and strength. They conducted him to their huts with great good nature, and placed before him, what they esteemed an elegant repast, a sea-calf dressed in the way of their country. This so much disgusted the delicate Portuguese, that he instantly got up and abruptly left them. Nor did they oppose his departure, but accompanied him with the greatest innocence. As fear, however, is always jealous, he imagined they were leading him as a victim to slaughter. No sooner did he come near the ships, than he called aloud for assistance. Coëllo’s boat immediately set off for his rescue. The Africans fled to the woods; and now esteeming the Portuguese as a band of lawless plunderers, they provided themselves with arms, and lay in ambush. Their weapons were javelins, headed with short pieces of horn, which they throw with great dexterity. Soon after, while GAMA and some of his officers were on the shore taking the altitude of the sun by the astrolabe, they were suddenly and with great fury attacked by the ambush from the woods. Several were much wounded, <i>multos convulnerant, inter quos Gama in pede vulnus accepit</i>, and GAMA received a wound in the foot. The admiral made a speedy retreat to the fleet, prudently choosing rather to leave the negroes the honour of the victory, than to risk the life of one man in a quarrel so foreign to the destination of his expedition, and where, to impress the terror of his arms could be of no service to his interest. When he came nearer to the East Indies he acted in a different manner. He then made himself dreaded whenever the treachery of the natives provoked his resentment.--<i>Collected from</i> Faria and Osorius.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_360"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_364">144:1</a> The critics have vehemently declaimed against the least mixture of the comic, with the dignity of the epic poem. It is needless to enter into any defence of this passage of Camoëns, farther than to observe that Homer, Virgil, and Milton have offended the critics in the same manner, and that this piece of raillery in the Lusiad is by much the politest, and the least reprehensible, of anything of the kind in the four poets. In Homer are several strokes of low raillery. Patroclus having killed Hector’s charioteer, puns thus on his sudden fall: <i>It is a pity he is not nearer the sea! He would soon catch abundance of oysters, nor would the storms frighten him. See how he dives from his chariot down to the sand! What excellent divers are the Trojans!</i> Virgil, the most judicious of all poets, descends even to burlesque, where the commander of a galley tumbles the pilot into the sea:--</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And, though the character of the speakers, the ingenious defence which has been offered for Milton, may, in some measure, vindicate the raillery which he puts into the mouths of Satan and Belial, the lowness of it, when compared with that of Camoëns, must still be acknowledged. Talking of the execution of the diabolical artillery among the good angels, they, says Satan--</p>

 <p><a name="fn_361"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_365">146:1</a> The translator in reply to the critics will venture the assertion, that the fiction of the apparition of the Cape of Tempests, in sublimity and awful grandeur of imagination, stands unsurpassed in human composition.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_362"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_366">147:1</a> <i>The next proud fleet</i>.--On the return of GAMA to Portugal, a fleet of thirteen sail, under the command of Pedro Alvarez Cabral, was sent out on the second voyage to India, where the admiral with only six ships arrived. The rest were mostly destroyed by a terrible tempest at the Cape of Good Hope, which lasted twenty days. "The daytime," says Faria, "was so dark that the sailors could scarcely see each other, or hear what was said for the horrid noise of the winds. Among those who perished was the celebrated Bartholomew Diaz, who was the first modern discoverer of the Cape of Good Hope, which he named the Cape of Tempests."</p>

He was the first Portuguese viceroy of India, in which country he obtained several great victories over the Mohammedans and pagans. He was the first who conquered Quiloa and Mombas, or Mombaz. On his return to Portugal he put into the bay of Saldanha, near the Cape of Good Hope, to take in water and provisions. The rudeness of one of his servants produced a quarrel with the Caffres, or Hottentots. His attendants, much against his will, forced him to march against the blacks. "Ah, whither," he exclaimed, "will you carry the infirm man of sixty years?" After plundering a miserable village, on the return to their ships they were attacked by a superior number of Caffres, who fought with such fury in rescue of their, children, whom the Portuguese had seized, that the viceroy and fifty of his attendants were slain.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_365"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_369">148:1</a> This poetical description of the miserable catastrophe of Don Emmanuel de Souza, and his beautiful spouse, Leonora de Sà, is by no means exaggerated. He was several years governor of Diu in India, where he amassed immense wealth. On his return to his native country, the ship in which was his lady, all his riches, and five hundred men, his sailors and domestics, was dashed to pieces on the rocks at the Cape of Good Hope. Don Emmanuel, his lady, and three children, with four hundred of the crew escaped, having only saved a few arms and provisions. As they marched through the wild uncultivated deserts, some died of famine, of thirst, and fatigue; others, who wandered from the main body in search of water, were <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a> murdered by the savages, or destroyed by the wild beasts. They arrived, at last, at a village inhabited by African banditti. At first they were courteously received, but the barbarians, having unexpectedly seized their arms, stripped the whole company naked, and left them destitute to the mercy of the desert. The wretchedness of the delicate and exposed Leonora was increased by the brutal insults of the negroes. Her husband, unable to relieve, beheld her miseries. After having travelled about 300 leagues, her legs swelled, her feet bleeding at every step, and her strength exhausted, she sunk down, and with the sand covered herself to the neck, to conceal her nakedness. In this dreadful situation, she beheld two of her children expire. Her own death soon followed. Her husband, who had been long enamoured of her beauty, received her last breath in a distracted embrace. Immediately, he snatched his third child in his arms, and uttering the most lamentable cries, he ran into the thickest of the wood, where the wild beasts were soon heard to growl over their prey. Of the whole four hundred who escaped the waves, only six and twenty arrived at another village, whose inhabitants were more civilized, and traded with the merchants of the Red Sea, from whence they found a passage to Europe, and brought the tidings of the unhappy fate of their companions. Jerome de Cortereal, a Portuguese poet, has written an affecting poem on the shipwreck, and deplorable catastrophe of Don Emmanuel, and his beloved spouse.--<i>Partly from</i> Castera.</p>

The insertion of this pastoral landscape, between the terrific scenes which precede and follow, has a fine effect. "Variety," says Pope, in one of his notes on the Odyssey, "gives life and delight; and it is much more necessary in epic, than in comic or tragic, poetry, sometimes to shift the scenes, to diversify and embellish the story."</p>  
 <p>The Portuguese, sailing upon the Atlantic Ocean, discovered the most southern point of Africa: here they found an immense sea, which carried them to the East Indies. The dangers they encountered in the voyage, the discovery of Mozambique, of Melinda, and of Calecut, have been sung by Camoëns, whose poem recalls to our minds the charms of the Odyssey, and the magnificence of the Æneid.--MONTESQUIEU, Spirit of Laws, bk. xxi. c. 21.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_378"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_382">156:2</a> It had been extremely impolitic in GAMA to mention the mutiny of his followers to the King of Melinda. The boast of their loyalty, besides, has a good effect in the poem, as it elevates the heroes, and gives uniformity to the character of bravery, which the dignity of the epopea required to be ascribed to them. History relates the matter differently. In standing for the Cape of Good Hope, GAMA gave the highest proofs of his resolution. The fleet seemed now tossed to the clouds, <i>ut modo nubes contingere</i>, and now sunk to the lowest whirlpools of the abyss. The winds were insufferably cold, and, to the rage of the tempest was added the horror of an almost continual darkness. The crew expected every moment to be swallowed up in the deep. At every interval of the storm, they came round GAMA, asserting the impossibility to proceed further, and imploring hint to return. This he resolutely refused. A conspiracy against his life was formed, but was discovered by his brother. He guarded against it with the greatest courage and prudence; put all the pilots in chains, and he himself, with some others, took the management of the helms. At last, after <a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a> having many days withstood the tempest, and a perfidious conspiracy, <i>invicto animo</i>, with an unconquered mind, a favourable change of weather revived the spirits of the fleet, and allowed them to double the Cape of Good Hope.--<i>Extr. from</i> Osorius’s Historia.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_379"></a><a href="lusbk05.htm#fr_383">158:1</a> GAMA and his followers were, from the darkness of the Portuguese complexion, thought to be Moors. When GAMA arrived in the East, a considerable commerce was carried on between the Indies and the Red Sea by the Moorish traders, by whom the gold mines of Sofala, and the riches of East Africa were enjoyed. The traffic was brought by land to Cairo, from whence Europe was supplied by the Venetian and Antwerpian merchants.</p>

 <p>The Libyan lotus is a shrub like a bramble, the berries like the myrtle, purple when ripe, and about the size of an olive. Mixed with bread-corn, it was used as food for slaves. They also made an agreeable wine of it, but which would not keep above ten days. See Pope’s note <i>in loco</i>.</p>

 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"The adverse winds in leathern bags he brac’d,<br> Compress’d their force, and lock’d each struggling blast:<br> For him the mighty sire of gods assign’d,<br> The tempest’s lord, the tyrant of the wind;<br> His word alone the list’ning storms obey,<br> To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea.<br> These, in my hollow ship the monarch hung,<br> Securely fetter’d by a silver thong; <a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 161</font></a><br> But Zephyrus exempt, with friendly gales<br> He charg’d to fill, and guide the swelling sails:<br> Rare gift! but oh, what gift to fools avails?"<br>                                        POPE, Odyss. x. 20.</font></dir>  
 <p>The companions of Ulysses imagined that these bags contained some valuable treasure, and opened them while their leader slept. The tempests bursting out, drove the fleet from Ithaca, which was then in sight, and was the cause of a new train of miseries.</p>
