 <p><font size="-1">The liberation of Gama’s factors is effected by a great victory over the Moorish fleet, and by the bombardment of Calicut. Gama returns in consequence to his ships, and weighs anchor to return to Europe with the news of his great discoveries. Camoëns then introduces a very singular, but agreeable episode, recounting the love adventures of his heroes in one of the islands of the ocean. Venus, in search of her son, journeys through all his realms to implore his aid, and at length arrives at the spot where Love’s artillery and arms are forged. Venus intercedes with her son in favour of the Portuguese. The island of Love, like that of Delos, floats on the ocean. It is then explained by the poet that these seeming realities are only allegorical.</font></p>  
 <p>RED <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">1</font></a> rose the dawn; roll’d o’er the low’ring sky,<br> The scatt’ring clouds of tawny purple fly.<br> While yet the day-spring struggled with the gloom,<br> The Indian monarch sought the regent’s dome.<br> In all the luxury of Asian state,<br> High on a star-gemm’d couch the monarch sat:<br> Then on th’ illustrious captive, bending down<br> His eyes, stern darken’d with a threat’ning frown,<br> "Thy truthless tale," he cries, "thy art appears,<br> Confess’d inglorious by thy cautious fears.<br> Yet, still if friendship, honest, thou implore,<br> Yet now command thy vessels to the shore:</p>

 <p>Gen’rous, as to thy friends, thy sails resign,<br> My will commands it, and the power is mine:<br> In vain thy art, in vain thy might withstands,<br> Thy sails, and rudders too, my will demands: <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Such be the test, thy boasted truth to try,<br> Each other test despis’d, I fix’d deny.<br> And has my regent sued two days in vain!<br> In vain my mandate, and the captive chain!<br> Yet not in vain, proud chief, ourself shall sue<br> From thee the honour to my friendship due:<br> Ere force compel thee, let the grace be thine,<br> Our grace permits it, freely to resign,<br> Freely to trust our friendship, ere too late<br> Our injur’d honour fix thy dreadful fate."</p>  
 <p>  While thus he spake, his changeful look declar’d<br> In his proud breast what starting passions warr’d.<br> No feature mov’d on GAMA’S face was seen;<br> Stern he replies, with bold yet anxious mien,<br> "In me my sov’reign represented see,<br> His state is wounded, and he speaks in me;<br> Unaw’d by threats, by dangers uncontroll’d,<br> The laws of nations bid my tongue be bold.<br> No more thy justice holds the righteous scale,<br> The arts of falsehood and the Moors prevail;<br> I see the doom my favour’d foes decree,<br> Yet, though in chains I stand, my fleet is free.<br> The bitter taunts of scorn the brave disdain;<br> Few be my words, your arts, your threats are vain.<br> My sov’reign’s fleet I yield not to your sway; <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Safe shall my fleet to Lisboa’s strand convey<br> The glorious tale of all the toils I bore,<br> Afric surrounded, and the Indian shore</p>

 <p>Discover’d. These I pledg’d my life to gain,<br> These to my country shall my life maintain.<br> One wish alone my earnest heart desires,<br> The sole impassion’d hope my breast respires;<br> My finish’d labours may my sov’reign hear!<br> Besides that wish, nor hope I know, nor fear.<br> And lo, the victim of your rage I stand,<br> And bare my bosom to the murd’rer’s hand."</p>  
 <p>  With lofty mien he spake. In stern disdain,<br> "My threats," the monarch cries, "were never vain:<br> Swift give the sign."--Swift as he spake, appear’d<br> The dancing streamer o’er the palace rear’d;<br> Instant another ensign distant rose,<br> Where, jutting through the flood, the mountain throws<br> A ridge enormous, and on either side<br> Defends the harbours from the furious tide.<br> Proud on his couch th’ indignant monarch sat,<br> And awful silence fill’d the room of state.<br> With secret joy the Moors, exulting, glow’d,<br> And bent their eyes where GAMA’S navy rode,<br> Then, proudly heav’d with panting hope, explore<br> The wood-crown’d upland of the bending shore.<br> Soon o’er the palms a mast’s tall pendant flows,<br> Bright to the sun the purple radiance glows;<br> In martial pomp, far streaming to the skies,<br> Vanes after vanes in swift succession rise,<br> And, through the opening forest-boughs of green,<br> The sails’ white lustre moving on is seen;<br> When sudden, rushing by the point of land<br> The bowsprits nod, and wide the sails expand;<br> Full pouring on the sight, in warlike pride,<br> Extending still the rising squadrons ride:<br> O’er every deck, beneath the morning rays,<br> Like melted gold, the brazen spear-points blaze;<br> Each prore surrounded with a hundred oars,<br> Old Ocean boils around the crowded prores:<br> And, five times now in number GAMA’S might,<br> Proudly their boastful shouts provoke the fight;<br> Far round the shore the echoing peal rebounds,<br> Behind the hill an answ’ring shout resounds:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>Still by the point new-spreading sails appear,<br> Till seven times GAMA’S fleet concludes the rear.<br> Again the shout triumphant shakes the bay;<br> Form’d as a crescent, wedg’d in firm array,<br> Their fleet’s wide horns the Lusian ships enclasp,<br> Prepar’d to crush them in their iron grasp.<br> Shouts echo shouts.--With stern, disdainful eyes<br> The Indian king to manly GAMA cries,<br> "Not one of thine on Lisboa’s shore shall tell<br> The glorious tale, how bold thy heroes fell."<br> With alter’d visage, for his eyes flash’d fire,<br> "God sent me here, and God’s avengeful ire<br> Shall blast thy perfidy," great VASCO cried,<br> "And humble in the dust thy wither’d pride."<br> A prophet’s glow inspir’d his panting breast,<br> Indignant smiles the monarch’s scorn confess’d.<br> Again deep silence fills the room of state,<br> And the proud Moors, secure, exulting wait:<br> And now inclasping GAMA’S in a ring,<br> Their fleet sweeps on.--Loud whizzing from the string<br> The black-wing’d arrows float along the sky,<br> And rising clouds the falling clouds supply.<br> The lofty crowding spears that bristling stood<br> Wide o’er the galleys as an upright wood,<br> Bend sudden, levell’d for the closing fight,<br> The points, wide-waving, shed a gleamy light.<br> Elate with joy the king his aspect rears,<br> And valiant GAMA, thrill’d with transport, hears<br> His drums’ bold rattling raise the battle sound;<br> Echo, deep-ton’d, hoarse, vibrates far around;<br> The shiv’ring trumpets tear the shrill-voic’d air,<br> Quiv’ring the gale, the flashing lightnings flare,<br> The smoke rolls wide, and sudden bursts the roar,<br> The lifted waves fall trembling, deep the shore<br> Groans; quick and quicker blaze embraces blaze<br> In flashing arms; louder the thunders raise<br> Their roaring, rolling o’er the bended skies<br> The burst incessant; awe-struck Echo dies<br> Falt’ring and deafen’d; from the brazen throats,<br> Cloud after cloud, enroll’d in darkness, floats,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>Curling their sulph’rous folds of fiery blue,<br> Till their huge volumes take the fleecy hue,<br> And roll wide o’er the sky; wide as the sight<br> Can measure heav’n, slow rolls the cloudy white:<br> Beneath, the smoky blackness spreads afar<br> Its hov’ring wings, and veils the dreadful war<br> Deep in its horrid breast; the fierce red glare,<br> Cheq’ring the rifted darkness, fires the air,<br> Each moment lost and kindled, while around,<br> The mingling thunders swell the lengthen’d sound.<br> When piercing sudden through the dreadful roar<br> The yelling shrieks of thousands strike the shore:<br> Presaging horror through the monarch’s breast<br> Crept cold; and gloomy o’er the distant east,<br> Through Gata’s hills <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">1</font></a> the whirling tempest sigh’d,<br> And westward sweeping to the blacken’d tide,<br> Howl’d o’er the trembling palace as it past,<br> And o’er the gilded walls a gloomy twilight cast;<br> Then, furious, rushing to the darken’d bay, <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Resistless swept the black-wing’d night away,<br> With all the clouds that hover’d o’er the fight,<br> And o’er the weary combat pour’d the light.</p>  
 <p>  As by an Alpine mountain’s pathless side<br> Some traveller strays, unfriended of a guide;<br> If o’er the hills the sable night descend,<br> And gath’ring tempest with the darkness blend,<br> Deep from the cavern’d rocks beneath, aghast<br> He hears the howling of the whirlwind’s blast;<br> Above, resounds the crash, and down the steep<br> Some rolling weight groans on with found’ring sweep;</p>

 <p>Aghast he stands, amid the shades of night,<br> And all his soul implores the friendly light:<br> It comes; the dreadful lightning’s quiv’ring blaze<br> The yawning depth beneath his lifted step betrays;<br> Instant unmann’d, aghast in horrid pain,<br> his knees no more their sickly weight sustain;<br> Powerless he sinks, no more his heart-blood flows;<br> So sunk the monarch, and his heart-blood froze;<br> So sunk he down, when o’er the clouded bay<br> The rushing whirlwind pour’d the sudden day:<br> Disaster’s giant arm in one wide sweep<br> Appear’d, and ruin blacken’d o’er the deep;<br> The sheeted masts drove floating o’er the tide,<br> And the torn hulks roll’d tumbling on the side;<br> Some shatter’d plank each heaving billow toss’d,<br> And, by the hand of Heav’n, dash’d on the coast<br> Groan’d prores ingulf’d; the lashing surges rave<br> O’er the black keels upturn’d, the swelling wave<br> Kisses the lofty mast’s reclining head;<br> And, far at sea, some few torn galleys fled.<br> Amid the dreadful scene triumphant rode<br> The Lusian war-ships, and their aid bestow’d<br> Their speedy boats far round assisting ply’d,<br> Where plunging, struggling, in the rolling tide,<br> Grasping the shatter’d wrecks, the vanquish’d foes<br> Rear’d o’er the dashing waves their haggard brows.<br> No word of scorn the lofty GAMA spoke,<br> Nor India’s king the dreadful silence broke.<br> Slow pass’d the hour, when to the trembling shore,<br> In awful pomp, the victor-navy bore:<br> Terrific, nodding on, the bowsprits bend,<br> And the red streamers other war portend:<br> Soon bursts the roar; the bombs tremendous rise,<br> And trail their black’ning rainbows o’er the skies;<br> O’er Calicut’s proud domes their rage they pour,<br> And wrap her temples in a sulph’rous shower.<br> ’Tis o’er--In threat’ning silence rides the fleet:<br> Wild rage, and horror yell in ev’ry street;<br> Ten thousands pouring round the palace gate,<br> In clam’rous uproar wail their wretch’d fate:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a></p>  
 <p>While round the dome, with lifted hands, they kneel’d,<br> "Give justice, justice to the strangers yield--<br> Our friends, our husbands, sons, and fathers slain!<br> Happier, alas, than these that yet remain-<br> Curs’d be the counsels, and the arts unjust--<br> Our friends in chains--our city in the dust--<br> Yet, yet prevent--------"<br>                          The silent VASCO saw<br> The weight of horror, and o’erpowering awe<br> That shook the Moors, that shook the regent’s knees,<br> And sunk the monarch down. By swift degrees<br> The popular clamour rises. Lost, unmann’d,<br> Around the king the trembling council stand;<br> While, wildly glaring on each other’s eyes,<br> Each lip in vain the trembling accent tries;<br> With anguish sicken’d, and of strength bereft,<br> Earnest each look inquires, What hope is left!<br> In all the rage of shame and grief aghast,<br> The monarch, falt’ring, takes the word at last:<br> "By whom, great chief, are these proud war-ships sway’d,<br> Are there thy mandates honour’d and obey’d?<br> Forgive, great chief, let gifts of price restrain<br> Thy just revenge. Shall India’s gifts be vain!-<br> Oh spare my people and their doom’d abodes--<br> Prayers, vows, and gifts appease the injur’d gods:<br> Shall man deny? Swift are the brave to spare:<br> The weak, the innocent confess their care--<br> Helpless, as innocent of guile, to thee<br> Behold these thousands bend the suppliant knee--<br> Thy navy’s thund’ring sides black to the land<br> Display their terrors--yet mayst thou command------</p>  
 <p>  O’erpower’d he paus’d. Majestic and serene<br> Great VASCO rose, then, pointing to the scene<br> Where bled the war, "Thy fleet, proud king, behold<br> O’er ocean and the strand in carnage roll’d!<br> So, shall this palace, smoking in the dust,<br> And yon proud city, weep thy arts unjust.<br> The Moors I knew, and, for their fraud prepar’d,<br> I left my fix’d command my navy’s guard: <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>  "Thy worth, great chief," the pale-lipp’d regent cries,<br> "Thy worth we own: oh, may these woes suffice!<br> To thee each proof of India’s wealth we send;<br> Ambassadors, of noblest race, attend-----"<br> Slow as he falter’d, GAMA caught the word,<br> "On terms I talk not, and no truce afford:</p>

On hasty strides,<br> Hurried along the deck, Coello chides<br> His cold, slow ling’ring, and impatient cries,<br> ’Oh, give the sign, illume the sacrifice,<br> A brother’s vengeance for a brother’s blood------"</p>  
 <p>  He spake; and stern the dreadful warrior stood;<br> So seem’d the terrors of his awful nod,<br> The monarch trembled as before a god;<br> The treach’rous Moors sank down in faint dismay,<br> And speechless at his feet the council lay:<br> Abrupt, with outstretched arms, the monarch cries,<br> "What yet-------" but dar’d not meet the hero’s eyes,<br> "What yet may save!" <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">1</font></a>--Great VASCO stern rejoins,<br> "Swift, undisputing, give th’ appointed signs:<br> High o’er thy loftiest tower my flag display,<br> Me and my train swift to my fleet convey:<br> Instant command--behold the sun rides high------"<br> He spake, and rapture glow’d in ev’ry eye;<br> The Lusian standard o’er the palace How’d,<br> Swift o’er the bay the royal barges row’d.<br> A dreary gloom a sudden whirlwind threw;<br> Amid the howling blast, enrag’d, withdrew<br> The vanquish’d demon.

 <p>Had this been mentioned sooner, the interest of the catastrophe of the <a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a> poem must have languished. Though he is not a warrior, the unexpected friend of GAMA bears a much more considerable part in the action of the Lusiad than the faithful Achates, the friend of the hero, bears in the business of the .Æneid.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_567">262:1</a> <i>There wast thou call’d to thy celestial home</i>.--This exclamatory address to the Moor Monzaida, however it may appear digressive, has a double propriety. The conversion of the Eastern world is the great purpose of the expedition of GAMA, and Monzaida is the first fruits of that conversion. The good characters of the victorious heroes, however neglected by the great genius of Homer, have a fine effect in making an epic poem interest us and please. It might have been said, that Monzaida was a traitor to his friends, who crowned his villainy with apostacy. Camoëns has, therefore, wisely drawn him with other features, worthy of the friendship of GAMA. Had this been neglected, the hero of the Lusiad might have shared the fate of the wise Ulysses of the Iliad, against whom, as Voltaire justly observes, every reader bears a secret ill will. Nor is the poetical character of Monzaida unsupported by history. He was not an Arab Moor, so he did not desert his countrymen. These Moors had determined on the destruction of GAMA; Monzaida admired and esteemed him, and therefore generously revealed to him his danger. By his attachment to GAMA he lost all his effects in India, a circumstance which his prudence and knowledge of affairs must have certainly foreseen. By the known dangers he encountered, by the loss he thus voluntarily sustained, and by his after constancy, his sincerity is undoubtedly proved.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_563"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_568">263:1</a> <i>The joy of the fleet on the homeward departure from India</i>.--We are now come to that part of the Lusiad, which, in the conduct of the poem, is parallel to the great catastrophe of the Iliad, when, on the death of Hector, Achilles thus addresses the Grecian army--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">      "Ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring<br> The corpse of Hector, and your pæons sing:<br> Be this the song, slow moving toward the shore,<br> ’Hector is dead, and Ilion is no more.’"</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Our Portuguese poet, who in his machinery, and many other instances, has followed the manner of Virgil, now forsakes him. In a very bold and masterly spirit he now models his poem by the steps of Homer. What of the Lusiad yet remains, in poetical conduct (though not in an imitation of circumstances), exactly resembles the latter part of the Iliad. The games at the funeral of Patroclus, and the redemption of the body of Hector, are the completion of the rage of Achilles. In the same manner, the reward of the heroes, and the consequences of their expedition complete the unity of the Lusiad. I cannot say it appears that Milton ever read our poet (though Fanshaw’s translation was published in his time); yet no instance can be given of a more striking resemblance of plan and conduct, than may be produced in two principal parts of the poem of Camoëns, and of the Paradise Lost.--See the Dissertation which follows this book.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_566"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_571">264:3</a> <i>His falling kingdom claim’d his earnest care</i>.--This fiction, in poetical conduct, bears a striking resemblance to the digressive histories with which Homer enriches and adorns his poems, particularly to the beautiful description of the feast of the gods with "the blameless Ethiopians." It also contains a masterly commentary on the machinery of the Lusiad. The Divine Love conducts GAMA to India. The same Divine Love is represented as preparing to reform the corrupted world, when its attention is particularly called to bestow a foretaste of immortality on the heroes of the expedition which discovered the eastern world. Nor do the wild fantastic loves, mentioned in this little episode, afford any objection against this explanation, an explanation which is expressly given in the episode itself. These wild fantastic amours signify, in the allegory, the wild sects of different enthusiasts, which spring up under the wings of the best and most rational institutions; and which, however contrary to each other, all agree in deriving their authority from the same source.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_567"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_572">265:1</a> <i>A young Actæon</i>.--The French translator has the following characteristic note: "This passage is an eternal monument of the freedoms taken by Camoëns, and at the same time a proof of the imprudence of poets; an authentic proof of that prejudice which sometimes blinds them, notwithstanding all the light of their genius. The modern Actæon of whom he speaks, was King Sebastian. He loved the chase; but, that pleasure, which is one of the most innocent and one of the most noble we can possibly taste, did not at all interrupt his attention to the affairs of state, and did not render him savage, as our author pretends. On this point the historians are rather to be believed. And what would the lot of princes be, were they allowed no relaxation from their toils, while they allow that privilege to their people? Subjects as we are, let us venerate the amusements of our sovereigns; let us believe that the august cares for our good, which employ them, follow them often even to the very bosom of their pleasures."</p>  
 <p>Many are the strokes in the Lusiad which must endear the character of Camoëns to every reader of sensibility. The noble freedom and manly indignation with which he mentions the foible of his prince, and the flatterers of his court, would do honour to the greatest names of Greece or Rome. While the shadow of freedom remained in Portugal, the greatest names of that nation, in the days of Lusian heroism, thought and conducted themselves in the spirit of Camoëns. A noble anecdote of this brave spirit offers itself. Alonzo IV., surnamed the Brave, ascended the throne of Portugal in the vigour of his age. The pleasures of the chase engrossed all his attention. His confidants and favourites encouraged, and allured him to it. His time was spent in the forests of Cintra, while the affairs of government were neglected or executed by those whose interest it was to keep their sovereign in ignorance. His presence, at last, being necessary at Lisbon, he entered the council with all the brisk impetuosity of a young sportsman, and with great familiarity and gaiety entertained his nobles with the history of a whole month spent in hunting, in fishing, and shooting. When he had finished his narrative, a nobleman of the first rank rose up: "Courts and camps," said he, "were allotted for kings, not woods and deserts. Even the affairs of private men suffer when recreation is preferred to business. But when the whims of pleasure engross the thoughts of a king, a whole nation is consigned to ruin. We came here for other purposes than to hear the exploits of the chase, exploits which are only intelligible to grooms and falconers. If your majesty will <a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a> attend to the wants, and remove the grievances of your people, you will find them obedient subjects; if not------" The king, starting with rage, interrupted him, "If not, what?" "If not," resumed the nobleman, in a firm tone, "they will look for another and a better king." Alonzo, in the highest transport of passion, expressed his resentment, and hasted out of the room. In a little while, however, he returned, calm and reconciled: "I perceive," said he, "the truth of what you say. He who will not execute the duties of a king, cannot long have good subjects. Remember, from this day, you have nothing more to do with Alonzo the sportsman, but with Alonzo the king of Portugal." His majesty was as good as his promise, and became, as a warrior and politician, one of the greatest of the Portuguese monarchs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_573">266:1</a> <i>With love’s fierce flames his frozen heart shall burn</i>.--"It is said, that upon the faith of a portrait Don Sebastian fell in love with Margaret of France, daughter of Henry II., and demanded her in marriage, but was refused. The Spaniards treated him no less unfavourably, for they also rejected his proposals for one of the daughters of Philip II. Our author considers these refusals as the punishment of Don Sebastian’s excessive attachment to the chase; but this is only a consequence of the prejudice with which he viewed the amusements of his prince. The truth is, these princesses were refused for political reasons, and not with any regard to the manner in which he filled up his moments of leisure."</p>  
 <p>Thus Castera, who, with the same spirit of sagacity, starts and answers the following objections: "But here is a difficulty: Camoëns wrote during the life of Don Sebastian, but the circumstance he relates (the return of GAMA) happened several years before, under the reign of Emmanuel. How, therefore, could he say that Cupid then saw Don Sebastian at the chase, when that prince was not then born? The answer is easy: Cupid, in the allegory of this work, represents the love of God, the Holy Spirit, who is God himself. Now the Divinity admits of no distinction of time; one glance of his eye beholds the past, the present, and the future; everything is present before him."</p>  
 <p>This defence of the fiction of Aetæon is not more absurd than useless. The free and bold spirit of poetry, and in particular the nature of allegory, defend it. The poet might easily have said, that Cupid <i>foresaw;</i> but had he said so his satire had been much less genteel. As the sentiments of Castera on this passage are extremely characteristic of French ideas, another note from him will perhaps <a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a> be agreeable. "Several Portuguese writers have remarked," says he, "that the wish--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">‘Of these lov’d dogs that now his passions sway,<br> Ah! may he never fall the hapless prey!’</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Had in it an air of prophecy; and fate, in effect, seemed careful to accomplish it, in making the presaged woes to fall upon Don Sebastian. If he did not fall a prey to his pack of hounds, we may, however, say that he was devoured by his favourites, who misled his youth and his great soul. But at any rate our poet has carried the similitude too far. It was certainly injurious to Don Sebastian, who nevertheless had the bounty not only not to punish this audacity, but to reward the just eulogies which the author had bestowed on him in other places. As much as the indiscretion of Camoëns ought to surprise us, as much ought we to admire the generosity of his master."</p>  
 <p>This foppery, this slavery in thinking, cannot fail to rouse the indignation of every manly breast, when the facts are fairly stated. Don Sebastian, who ascended the throne when a child, was a prince of great abilities and great spirit, but his youth was poisoned with the most romantic ideas of military glory. The affairs of state were left to his ministers (for whose character see the next note), his other studies were neglected, and military exercises, of which he not unjustly esteemed the chase a principal, were almost his sole employ. Camoëns beheld this romantic turn, and in a genteel allegorical satire foreboded its consequences. The wish, that his prince might not fall the prey of his favourite passion, was in vain. In a rash, ill-concerted expedition into Africa, Don Sebastian lost his crown in his twenty-fifth year, an event which soon after produced the fall of the Portuguese empire. Had the nobility possessed the spirit of Camoëns, had they, like him, endeavoured to check the quixotism of a young generous prince, that prince might have reigned long and happy, and Portugal might have escaped the Spanish yoke, which soon followed his defeat at Alcazar; a yoke which sunk Portugal into an abyss of misery, from which, in all probability, she will never emerge into her former splendour.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_578">270:2</a> <i>And Fame--a giant-goddess</i>.--This passage affords a striking instance of the judgment of Camoëns.

 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_580">272:1</a> <i>White as her swans</i>.--A distant fleet compared to swans on a lake is certainly a happy thought. The allusion to the pomp of Venus, whose agency is immediately concerned, gives it besides a peculiar propriety. This simile, however, is not in the original. It is adopted from an uncommon liberty taken by Fanshaw:--</p>

 <p><a name="fn_576"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_581">273:1</a> <i>Soon as the floating verdure caught their sight</i>.--As the departure of GAMA from India was abrupt, he put into one of the beautiful islands of Anchediva for fresh water. "While he was here careening his ships," says Faria, "a pirate named Timoja, attacked him with eight small vessels, so linked together and covered with boughs, that they formed the appearance of a floating island." This, says Castera, afforded the fiction of the floating island of Venus. "The fictions of Camoëns," says he, "are the more marvellous, because they are all founded in history. It is not difficult to find why he makes his island of Anchediva to wander on the waves; it is an allusion to a singular event related by Barros." He then proceeds to the story of Timoja, as if the genius of Camoëns stood in need of so weak an assistance.</p>

Neptune, in pity of her distress, raised the island of Delos for her refuge, where she was delivered of Apollo and Diana.--OVID, Met.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_578"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_583">274:1</a> <i>Form’d in a crystal lake the waters blend</i>.--Castera also attributes this to history. "The Portuguese actually found in this island," says he, "a fine piece of water ornamented with hewn stones and magnificent aqueducts; an ancient and superb work, of which nobody knew the author."</p>  
 <p>In 1505 Don Francisco Almeyda built a fort in this island. In digging among some ancient ruins he found many crucifixes of black and red colour, from whence the Portuguese conjectured, says Osorius, that the Anchedivian islands had in former ages been inhabited by Christians.--Vid. Osor. l. iv.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Frequent allusions to the fables of the ancients form a characteristic feature of the poetry of the 16th and 17th centuries. A profusion of it is pedantry; a moderate use of it, however, in a poem of these times pleases, because it discovers the stages of composition, and has in itself a fine effect, as it illustrates its subject by presenting the classical reader with some little landscapes of that country through which he has travelled. The description of forests is a favourite topic in poetry. Chaucer, Tasso, and Spenser, have been happy in it, but both have copied an admired passage in Statius:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">                      "Cadit ardua fagus,<br> Chaoniumque nemus, brumæque illæsa cupressus;<br> Procumbunt piceæ, flammis alimenta supremis,<br> Ornique, iliceæque trabes, metuandaque sulco<br> Taxus, et infandos belli potura cruores<br> Fraxinus, atque situ non expugnabile robur:<br> Hinc audax abies, et odoro vulnere pinus<br> Scinditur, acclinant intonsa cacumina terræ<br> Alnus amica fretis, nec inhospita vitibus ulmus."</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> In rural descriptions three things are necessary to render them poetical: the happiness of epithet, of picturesque arrangement, and of little landscape views. Without these, all the names of trees and flowers, though strung together in tolerable numbers, contain no more poetry than a nurseryman or a florist’s catalogue. In Statius, in Tasso and Spenser’s admired forests (Ger. Liber. c. 3. st. 75, 76, and F. Queen, b. 1. c. 1. st. 8, 9), the poetry consists entirely in the happiness of the epithets. In Camoëns, all the three requisites are admirably attained and blended together.</p>

It must be confessed, however, that the description of the island of Venus, is infinitely the best part all of Fanshaw’s translation. And indeed the dullest prose translation might obscure, but could not possibly throw a total eclipse over, so admirable an original.</p>

"This," says Castera, "is applicable to the celestial Venus, for, according to my theology, her amour with Adonis had <a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a> nothing in it impure, but was only the love which nature bears to the sun." The fables of antiquity have generally a threefold interpretation, an historical allusion, a physical and a metaphysical allegory. In the latter view, the fable of Adonis is only applicable to the celestial Venus. A divine youth is outrageously slain, but shall revive again at the restoration of the golden age. Several nations, it is well known, under different names, celebrated the Mysteries, or the death and resurrection of Adonis; among whom were the British Druids, as we are told by Dr. Stukely. In the same manner Cupid, in the fable of Psyche, is interpreted by mythologists, to signify the Divine Love weeping over the degeneracy of human nature.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Camoëns who had a genius rich of itself, still further enriched it at the expense of the ancients. Behold what makes great authors Those who pretend to give us nothing but the fruits of their own growth, soon fail, like the little rivulets which dry up in the summer, very different from the floods, who receive in their course the tribute of a hundred and a hundred rivers, and which even in the dog-days carry their waves triumphant to the ocean."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_585"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_590">280:1</a> <i>The second Argonauts</i>.--The expedition of the Golden Fleece was esteemed, in ancient poetry, one of the most daring adventures, the success of which was accounted miraculous. The allusions of Camoëns to this voyage, though in the spirit of his age, are by no means improper.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_591">280:2</a> <i>Wide o’er the beauteous isle the lovely fair</i>.--We now come to the passage condemned by Voltaire as so lascivious, that no nation in Europe, except the Portuguese and Italians, could bear it. The fate of Camoëns has hitherto been very peculiar. The mixture of Pagan and Christian mythology in his machinery has been anathematized, and his island of love represented as a brothel. Yet both accusations are the arrogant assertions of the most superficial acquaintance with his works. His poem itself, and a comparison of its parts with the similar conduct of the greatest modern poets, will clearly evince, that in both instances no modern epic writer of note has given less offence to true criticism.</p>  
 <p>Not to mention Ariosto, whose descriptions will often admit of no palliation, Tasso, Spenser, and Milton, have always been esteemed among the chastest of poets, yet in that delicacy of warm description, which Milton has so finely exemplified in the nuptials of our first parents, none of them can boast the continued uniformity of the Portuguese poet. Though there is a warmth in the colouring of Camoëns which even the genius of Tasso has not reached; and though the island of Armida is evidently copied from the Lusiad, yet those who are possessed of the finer feelings, will easily discover an essential difference between the love-scenes of the two poets, a difference greatly in favour of the delicacy of the former. Though the nymphs in Camoëns are detected naked in the woods, and in the stream, and though desirous to captivate, still their behaviour is that of the virgin <a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a> who hopes to be the spouse. They act the part of offended modesty; even when they yield they are silent, and behave in every respect like Milton’s Eve in the state of innocence, who--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"What was honour knew,"</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And who displayed--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,<br> That would be wooed, and not unsought be won."</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> To sum up all, the nuptial sanctity draws its hallowed curtains, and a masterly allegory shuts up the love-scenes of Camoëns.</p>  
 <p>How different from all this is the island of Armida in Tasso, and its translation, the bower of Acrasia in Spenser! In these virtue is seduced; the scene therefore is less delicate. The nymphs, while they are bathing, in place of the modesty of the bride as in Camoëns, employ all the arts of. the lascivious wanton. They stay not to be wooed; but, as Spenser gives it--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1"><i>The amorous sweet spoils to greedy eyes reveal</i>.</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> One stanza from our English poet, which, however, is rather fuller than the original, shall here suffice:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Withal she laughed and she blush’d withal,<br> That blushing to her laughter gave more grace,<br> And laughter to her blushing, as did fall.<br> Now when they spy’d the knight to slack his pace,<br> Them to behold, and <i>in his sparkling face<br> The secret signs of kindled lust appear</i>,<br> Their wanton merriments they did increase,<br> And to him beckon’d to approach more near,<br> <i>And show’d him many sights, that courage cold could rear</i>.</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> This and other descriptions--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Upon a bed of roses she was laid<br> As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin"--</font></dir>  
 <p>present every idea of lascivious voluptuousness. The allurements of speech are also added. Songs, which breathe every persuasive, are heard; and the nymphs boldly call to the beholder:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1"><i>E’ dolce campo di battaglia il letto<br> Fiavi, e l’herbetta morbida de’ prati</i>.--TASSO.</font></dir>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Our field of battle is the downy bed,<br> Or flow’ry turf amid the smiling mead."--HOOLE.</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> These, and the whole scenes in the domains of Armida and Acrasia, are in a turn of manner the reverse of the island of Venus. In these the expression and idea are meretricious. In Camoëns, though the colouring is even warmer, yet the modesty of the Venus de Medicis is still preserved. In everything he describes there is still something <a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 282</font></a> strongly similar to the modest attitude of the arms of that celebrated statue. Though prudery, that usual mask of the impurest minds, may condemn him, yet those of the most chaste, though less gloomy turn, will allow, that in comparison with others, he might say,--<i>Virginibus puerisque canto</i>.</p>  
 <p>Spenser also, where he does not follow Tasso, is often gross; and even in some instances, where the expression is most delicate, the picture is nevertheless indecently lascivious.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_587"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_592">284:1</a> <i>The hunter</i>.--Acteon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_588"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_593">287:1</a> <i>Madd’ning as he said</i>.--At the end of his Homer Mr. Pope has given an index of the instances of imitative and sentimental harmony contained in his translations. He has also often even in his notes pointed out the adaptation of sound to sense. The translator of the Lusiad hopes he may for once say, that he has not been inattentive to this great essential of good versification: how he has succeeded the judicious only must determine. The speech of Leonard to the cursory reader may perhaps sometimes appear careless, and sometimes turgid and stiff. That speech, however, is an attempt at the imitative and sentimental harmony, and with the judicious he rests its fate. As the translation in this instance exceeds the original in length, the objection of a foreign critic requires attention. An old pursy Abbé, (and critics are apt to judge by themselves) may indeed be surprised <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a> that a man out of breath with running should be able to talk so long. But, had he consulted the experiences of others, he would have found it was no wonderful matter for a stout and young cavalier to talk twice as much, though fatigued with the chase of a couple of miles, provided the supposition be allowed, that he treads on the last steps of his flying mistress.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_589"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_594">289:1</a> <i>Hence, ye profane</i>.--We have already observed, that in every other poet the love scenes are generally described as those of guilt and remorse. The contrary character of those of Camoëns not only gives them a delicacy unknown to other moderns, but, by the fiction of the spousal rites, the allegory and machinery of the poem are most happily conducted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_590"></a><a href="lusbk09.htm#fr_595">290:1</a> <i>Spread o’er the eastern world the dread alarms</i>.--This admonition places the whole design of the poem before us. To extirpate <a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a> Mohammedanism, and propagate Christianity, were professed as the principal purpose of the discoveries of Prince Henry and King Emmanuel. In the beginning of the seventh Lusiad, the nations of Europe are upbraided for permitting the Saracens to erect and possess an empire, which alike threatened Europe and Christianity. The Portuguese, however, the patriot poet concludes, will themselves overthrow their enormous power: an event which is the proposed subject of the Lusiad, and which is represented as, in effect, completed in the last book. On this system, adopted by the poet, and which on every occasion was avowed by their kings, the Portuguese made immense conquests in the East. Yet, let it be remembered, to the honour of GAMA, and the first commanders who followed his route, that the plots of the Moors, and their various breaches of treaty, gave rise to the first wars which the Portuguese waged in Asia. On finding that all the colonies of the Moors were combined for their destruction, the Portuguese declared war against the eastern Moors, and their allies, wherever they found them. The course of human things, however, soon took place, and the sword of victory and power soon became the sword of tyranny and rapine.</p>
