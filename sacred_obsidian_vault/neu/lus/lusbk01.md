 <p><font size="-1">Statement of the subject. Invocation to the muses of the Tagus. Herald calls an assembly of the gods. Jupiter foretells the future conquests of the Portuguese. Bacchus, apprehensive that the Portuguese may eclipse the glory acquired by himself in the conquest of India, declares against them. Venus, who sees in the Portuguese her ancient Romans, promises to aid their enterprise. Mars induces Jupiter to support them, and Mercury is sent to direct their course. Gama, commander of the expedition, lands at Mozambique and Mombas. Opposition of the Moors, instigated by  Bacchus. They grant Gama a pilot who designs treacherously to take them to Quiloa to ensure the destruction of the whole expedition.</font></p>

 <p>When Jove, the god who with a thought controls<br> The raging seas, and balances the poles,<br> From heav’n beheld, and will’d, in sov’reign state,<br> To fix the Eastern World’s depending fate,<br> Swift at his nod th’ Olympian herald flies,<br> And calls th’ immortal senate of the skies;<br> Where, from the sov’reign throne of earth and heav’n,<br> Th’ immutable decrees of fate are given.<br> Instant the regents of the spheres of light,<br> And those who rule the paler orbs of night,<br> With those, the gods whose delegated sway<br> The burning South and frozen North obey;<br> And they whose empires see the day-star rise,<br> And evening Phoebus leave the western skies,<br> All instant pour’d along the milky road,<br> Heaven’s crystal pavements glitt’ring as they trod:<br> And now, obedient to the dread command,<br> Before their awful lord in order stand.</p>  
 <p>  Sublime and dreadful on his regal throne,<br> That glow’d with stars, and bright as lightning shone, <br> Th’ immortal Sire, who darts the thunder, sat,<br> The crown and sceptre added solemn state;<br> The crown, of heaven’s own pearls, whose ardent rays,<br> Flam’d round his brows, outshone the diamond’s blaze:<br> His breath such gales of vital fragrance shed,<br> As might, with sudden life, inspire the dead:<br> Supreme Control thron’d in his awful eyes<br> Appear’d, and mark’d the monarch of the skies.<br> On seats that burn’d with pearl and ruddy gold,<br> The subject gods their sov’reign lord enfold,<br> Each in his rank, when with a voice that shook<br> The tow’rs of heav’n, the world’s dread ruler spoke:</p>  
 <p>  "Immortal heirs of light, my purpose hear,<br> My counsels ponder, and the Fates revere:<br> Unless Oblivion o’er your minds has thrown<br> Her dark blank shades, to you, ye gods, are known<br> The Fate’s decree, and ancient warlike fame<br> Of that bold race which boasts of Lusus’ name;<br> That bold advent’rous race, the Fates declare,<br> A potent empire in the East shall rear,</p>

 <p>Surpassing Babel’s or the Persian fame,<br> Proud Grecia’s boast, or Rome’s illustrious name.<br> Oft from these brilliant seats have you beheld<br> The sons of Lusus on the dusty field,<br> Though few, triumphant o’er the num’rous Moors,<br> Till, from the beauteous lawns on Tagus’ shores<br> They drove the cruel foe. And oft has heav’n<br> Before their troops the proud Castilians driv’n;<br> While Victory her eagle-wings display’d<br> Where’er their warriors wav’d the shining blade,<br> Nor rests unknown how Lusus’ heroes stood<br> When Rome’s ambition dyed the world with blood;<br> What glorious laurels Viriatus <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">1</font></a> gain’d,<br> How oft his sword with Roman gore was stain’d;</p>

 <p>And what fair palms their martial ardour crown’d,<br> When led to battle by the chief renown’d,<br> Who <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">1</font></a> feign’d a dæmon, in a deer conceal’d,<br> To him the counsels of the gods reveal’d.<br> And now, ambitious to extend their sway<br> Beyond their conquests on the southmost bay<br> Of Afric’s swarthy coast, on floating wood<br> They brave the terrors of the dreary flood,<br> Where only black-wing’d mists have hover’d o’er,<br> Or driving clouds have sail’d the wave before;<br> Beneath new skies they hold their dreadful way<br> To reach the cradle of the new-born day:<br> And. Fate, whose mandates unrevok’d remain,<br> Has will’d that long shall Lusus’ offspring reign<br> The lords of that wide sea, whose waves behold<br> The sun come forth enthron’d in burning gold.<br> But now, the tedious length of winter past,<br> Distress’d and weak, the heroes faint at last.<br> What gulfs they dar’d, you saw, what storms they brav’d,<br> Beneath what various heav’ns their banners wav’d!<br> Now Mercy pleads, and soon the rising land<br> To their glad eyes shall o’er the waves expand;<br> As welcome friends the natives shall receive,<br> With bounty feast them, and with joy relieve.<br> And, when refreshment shall their strength renew,<br> Thence shall they turn, and their bold route pursue."</p>  
 <p>  So spoke high Jove: the gods in silence heard,<br> Then rising, each by turns his thoughts preferr’d<br> But chief was Bacchus of the adverse train;<br> Fearful he was, nor fear’d his pride in vain,<br> Should Lusus’ race arrive on India’s shore,<br> His ancient honours would be known no more;</p>

 <p>Give then a pilot to their wand’ring fleet,<br> Bold in his art, and tutor’d in deceit;<br> Whose hand advent’rous shall their helms misguide,<br> To hostile shores, or whelm them in the tide."</p>  
 <p>  So spoke the god, in semblance of a sage<br> Renown’d for counsel and the craft of age.<br> The prince with transport glowing in his face<br> Approv’d, and caught him in a kind embrace:<br> And instant at the word his bands prepare<br> Their bearded darts and implements of war,<br> That Lusus’ sons might purple with their gore<br> The crystal fountain which they sought on shore:<br> And, still regardful of his dire intent,<br> A skilful pilot to the bay he sent,<br> Of honest mien, yet practised in deceit,<br> Who far at distance on the beach should wait,<br> And to the ’scaped, if some should ’scape the snare<br> Should offer friendship and the pilot’s care,<br> But when at sea, on rocks should dash their pride,<br> And whelm their lofty vanes beneath the tide.</p>

 <p>  And now, as swiftly springing o’er the tide<br> Advanc’d the boats, a troop of Moors they spied;<br> O’er the pale sands the sable warriors crowd,<br> And toss their threat’ning darts, and shout aloud.</p>

Duperron de Castera, who has given a French prose translation, or rather paraphrase, of the Lusiad, has a long note on this passage, which, he tells us, must not be understood literally. Our author, he says, could not be ignorant that the African and Indian Oceans had been navigated before the times of the Portuguese. The Phœnicians, whose fleets passed the straits of Gibraltar, made frequent voyages in these seas, though they carefully concealed the course of their navigation that <a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 2</font></a> other nations might not become partakers of their lucrative traffic.--See the Periplus of Hanno, in Cory’s Ancient Fragments.--<i>Ed</i>.</p>

Zeal for the Christian religion was esteemed, at the time of the Portuguese grandeur, as the most cardinal virtue. and to propagate Christianity and extirpate Mohammedanism were the most certain proofs of that zeal. In all their expeditions this was professedly a principal motive of the Lusitanian monarchs, and Camoëns understood the nature of epic poetry too well to omit it.</p>

Though the warm imagination of Camoëns anticipated the praises of the future hero, the young monarch, like Virgil’s Pollio, had not the happiness to fulfil the prophecy. His endowments and enterprising genius promised, indeed, a glorious reign. Ambitious of military laurels, he led a powerful army into Africa, on purpose to replace Muley Hamet on the throne of Morocco, from which he had been deposed by Muley Molucco. On the 4th of August, 1578, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, he gave battle to the usurper on the plains of Alcazar. This was that memorable engagement, to which the Moorish Emperor, extremely weakened by sickness, was carried in his litter. By the impetuosity of the attack, the first line of the Moorish infantry was broken, and the second disordered. Muley Molucco on this mounted his horse, drew his sabre, and would have put himself at the head of his troops, but was prevented by his attendants. His emotion of mind was so great that he fell from his horse, and one of his guards having caught him in his arms, conveyed him to his litter, where, putting his finger on his lips to enjoin them silence, he immediately expired. Hamet Taba stood by the curtains of the carriage, opened them from time to time, and gave out orders as if he had received them from the Emperor. Victory declared for the Moors, and the defeat of the Portuguese was so total, that not above fifty of their whole army escaped. Hieron de Mendoça and Sebastian de Mesa relate, that Don Sebastian, after having two horses killed under him, was surrounded and taken; but the party who had secured him, quarrelling among themselves whose prisoner he was, a Moorish officer rode up and struck the king a blow over the right eye, which brought him to the ground; when, despairing of ransom, the others killed him. About twenty years after this fatal defeat there appeared a stranger <a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a> at Venice, who called himself Sebastian, King of Portugal, whom he so perfectly resembled, that the Portuguese of that city acknowledged him for their sovereign. He underwent twenty-eight examinations before a committee of the nobles, in which he gave a distinct account of the manner in which he had passed his time from the fatal defeat at Alcazar. It was objected, that the successor of Muley Molucco sent a corpse to Portugal which had been owned as that of the king by the Portuguese nobility who survived the battle. To this he replied, that his <i>valet de chambre</i> had produced that body to facilitate his escape, and that the nobility acted upon the same motive, and Mesa and Baena confess, that some of the nobility, after their return to Portugal acknowledged that the corpse was so disfigured with wounds that it was impossible to know it. He showed natural marks on his body, which many remembered on the person of the king whose name he assumed. He entered into a minute detail of the transactions that had. passed between himself and the republic, and mentioned the secrets of several conversations with the Venetian ambassadors in the palace of Lisbon. He fell into the hands of the Spaniards, who conducted him to Naples, where they treated him with the most barbarous indignities. After they had often exposed him, mounted on an ass, to the cruel insults of the brutal mob, he was shipped on beard a galley, as a slave. He was then carried to St. Lucar, from thence to a castle in the heart of Castile, and never was heard of more. The firmness of his behaviour, his singular modesty and heroical patience, are mentioned with admiration by Le Clede. To the last he maintained the truth of his assertions; a word never slipped from his lips which might countenance the charge of imposture, or justify the cruelty of his persecutors.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_70"></a><a href="lusbk01.htm#fr_70">4:1</a> Portugal, when Camoëns wrote his Lusiad, was at the zenith of its power and splendour. The glorious successes which had attended the arms of the Portuguese in Africa, had gained them the highest military reputation. Their fleets covered the ocean. Their dominions and settlements extended along the western and eastern sides of the vast African continent. From the Red Sea to China and Japan, they were sole masters of the riches of the East; and in America, the fertile and extensive regions of Brazil completed their empire.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_77"></a><a href="lusbk01.htm#fr_77">7:2</a> Some critics have condemned Virgil for stopping his narrative to introduce even a short observation of his own. Milton’s beautiful complaint of his blindness has been blamed for the same reason, as being no part of the subject of his poem. The address of Camoëns to Don Sebastian at the conclusion of the tenth Lusiad has not escaped the same censure; though in some measure undeservedly, as the poet has had the art to interweave therein some part of the general argument of his poem.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_78"></a><a href="lusbk01.htm#fr_78">9:1</a> This brave Lusitanian, who was first a shepherd and a famous hunter, and afterwards a captain of banditti, exasperated at the tyranny of the Romans, encouraged his countrymen to revolt and shake off the yoke. Being appointed general, he defeated Vetilius the prætor, who commanded in Lusitania, or farther Spain. After this he defeated, in three pitched battles, the prætors, C. Plautius Hypsæus and Claudius Unimanus, though they led against him very numerous armies. For six years he continued victorious, putting the Romans to flight wherever he met them, and laying waste the countries of their allies. Having obtained such advantages over the proconsul, Servilianus, that the only choice which was left to the Roman army was death or slavery, the brave Viriatus, instead of putting them all to the sword, as he could easily have done, sent a deputation to the general, offering to conclude a peace with him on this single condition, <i>That he should continue master of the country now in his power, and that the Romans should remain possessed of the rest of Spain</i>.</p>  
 <p>The proconsul, who expected nothing but death or slavery, thought these very favourable and moderate terms, and without hesitation concluded a peace, which was soon after ratified by the Roman senate and people. Viriatus, by this treaty, completed the glorious design he had always in view, which was to erect a kingdom in the vast country he had conquered from the republic. And, had it not been for the treachery of the Romans, he would have become, as Florus calls him, the Romulus of Spain.</p>  
 <p>The senate, desirous to revenge their late defeat, soon after this peace, ordered Q. Servilius Cæpio to exasperate Viriatus, and force him, by repeated affronts, to commit the first acts of hostility. But this mean artifice did not succeed: Viriatus would not be provoked to a breach of the peace. On this the Conscript Fathers, to the eternal disgrace of their republic, ordered Cæpio to declare war, and to proclaim Viriatus, who had given no provocation, an enemy to <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a> Rome. To this baseness Cæpio added one still greater; he corrupted the ambassadors whom Viriatus had sent to negotiate with him, who, at the instigation of the Roman, treacherously murdered their protector and general while he slept.--UNIV.

Jealous of such formidable rivals as the Portuguese, they employed every artifice to accomplish the destruction of GAMA’S fleet. As the Moors were acquainted with these seas and spoke the Arabic language, GAMA was obliged to employ them both as pilots and interpreters. The circumstance now mentioned by Camoëns is an historical fact. "The Moorish pilot," says De Barros, "intended to conduct the Portuguese into Quiloa, telling them that place was inhabited by Christians; but a sudden storm arising, drove the fleet from that shore, where death or slavery would have been the certain fate of GAMA and his companions. The villainy of the pilot was afterwards discovered. As GAMA was endeavouring to enter the port of Mombaz his ship struck on a sand-bank, and finding their purpose of bringing him into the harbour defeated, two of the Moorish pilots leaped into the sea and swam ashore. Alarmed at this tacit acknowledgment of guilt, GAMA ordered two other Moorish pilots who remained on board to be examined by whipping, who, after some time, made a full confession of their intended villainy. This discovery greatly encouraged GAMA and his men, who now interpreted the sudden storm which had driven them from Quiloa as a miraculous interposition of Divine Providence in their favour.</p>
