 <p align="center">[<i>ORIGINAL DEDICATION</i>, 1776]</p>  <h6 align="center">TO THE</h6>  <h4 align="center">DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH.</h4>  
 <p>MY LORD,</p>  
 <p>The first idea of offering my LUSIAD to some distinguished personage, inspired the earnest wish, that it might be accepted by the illustrious representative of that family under which my father, for many years, discharged the duties of a clergyman.</p>  
 <p>Both the late Duke of BUCCLEUGH, and the Earl of DALKEITH, distinguished him by particular marks of their favour; and I must have forgotten him, if I could have wished to offer the first Dedication of my literary labours to any other than the Duke of BUCCLEUGH.</p>  
 <p>I am, with the greatest respect,<br>         My Lord,<br>                 Your Grace’s most devoted<br>                         And most obedient humble servant,</p>  
 <p>                                WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.</p>
