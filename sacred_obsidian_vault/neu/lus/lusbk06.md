 <p><font size="-1">Gama’s long recital being concluded, the poet resumes the thread of his story in his own person. The Portuguese admiral enters into an alliance with the King of Melinda, assures him that the vessels of his nation will always in future anchor on his shores. Gama receives from the monarch a faithful pilot to conduct him to India. Bacchus, now has recourse to Neptune, at whose palace the divinities of the sea assemble. The gods of the sea consent to let loose the winds and waves against the daring navigators. During the night the sailors on the watch relate to each other amusing stories. Veloso urges them to relate some proud feats of war. The history of the contest of the twelve knights of England with the twelve of Portugal is then told. A violent tempest assails the fleet. Vivid picture of a storm at sea. Gama addresses his prayer to God; and Venus, with her nymphs so captivates the storm-gods that a calm ensues. The boy at the masthead raises a joyful cry of Land! re-echoed by the whole crew. The pilot informs the Portuguese that they are now approaching the kingdom of Calicut. The poet’s reflections.</font></p>  
 <p>WITH heart sincere the royal pagan joy’d,<br> And hospitable rites each hour employ’d,<br> For much the king the Lusian band admir’d,<br> And, much their friendship and their aid desir’d;<br> Each hour the gay festivity prolongs,<br> Melindian dances, and Arabian songs;<br> Each hour in mirthful transport steals away,<br> By night the banquet, and the chase by day;<br> And now, the bosom of the deep invites,<br> And all the pride of Neptune’s festive rites;</p>

 <p>Their silken banners waving o’er the tide,<br> A jovial band, the painted galleys ride;<br> The net and angle various hands employ,<br> And Moorish timbrels sound the notes of joy.<br> Such was the pomp, when Egypt’s beauteous <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">1</font></a> queen<br> Bade all the pride of naval show convene,<br> In pleasure’s downy bosom, to beguile<br> Her love-sick warrior: <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">2</font></a> o’er the breast of Nile,<br> Dazzling with gold, the purple ensigns flow’d,<br> And to the lute the gilded barges row’d;<br> While from the wave, of many a shining hue,<br> The anglers’ lines the panting fishes drew.</p>  
 <p>  Now, from the West the sounding breezes blow,<br> And far the hoary flood was yet to plough:<br> The fountain and the field bestow’d their store,<br> And friendly pilots from the friendly shore,<br> Train’d in the Indian deep, were now aboard,<br> When GAMA, parting from Melinda’s lord,<br> The holy vows of lasting peace renew’d,<br> For, still the king for lasting friendship sued;<br> That Lusus’ heroes in his port supplied,<br> And tasted rest, he own’d his dearest pride,<br> And vow’d, that ever while the seas they roam,<br> The Lusian fleets should find a bounteous home,<br> And, ever from the gen’rous shore receive<br> Whate’er his port, whate’er his land could give. <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p><font size="-1">Once more the translator is tempted to confess his opinion, that the contrary practice of Homer and Virgil affords, in reality, no reasonable objection against the exclamatory exuberances of Camoëns. Homer, though the father of the epic poem, has his exuberances, which violently trespass against the first rule of the epopea, the unity of the action. A rule which, strictly speaking, is not outraged by the digressive exclamations of Camoëns. The one now before us, as the severest critic must allow, is happily adapted to the subject of the book. The great dangers which the hero had hitherto encountered are particularly described. He is afterwards brought in safety to the Indian shore, the object of his ambition, and of all his toils. The exclamation, therefore, on the grand hinge of the poem has its propriety, and discovers the warmth of its author’s genius. It must also please, as it is strongly characteristic of the temper of our military poet. The manly contempt with which he speaks of the luxurious, inactive courtier, and the delight and honour with which he talks of the toils of the soldier, present his own active life to the reader of sensibility. His campaigns in Africa, where in a gallant attack he lost an eye, his dangerous life at sea, and the military fatigues, and</font></p>

 <p><font size="-1">the battles in which he bore an honourable share in India, rise to our idea, and possess us with an esteem and admiration of our martial poet, who thus could look back with a gallant enthusiasm (though his modesty does not mention himself) on all the hardships he had endured; who thus could bravely esteem the dangers to which he had been exposed, and by which he had severely suffered. as the most desirable occurrences of his life, and the ornament of his name.</font></p>

 <p><a name="fn_401"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_405">165:2</a> Every display of eastern luxury and magnificence was lavished in the fishing parties on the Nile, with which Cleopatra amused Mark Antony, when at any time he showed symptoms of uneasiness, or seemed inclined to abandon the effeminate life which he led with his mistress. At one of these parties, Mark Antony, having procured divers to put fishes upon his hooks while under the water, he very gallantly boasted to his mistress of his great dexterity in angling. Cleopatra perceived his art, and as gallantly outwitted him. Some other divers received her orders, and in a little while Mark Antony’s line brought up a fried fish in place of a live one, to the vast entertainment of the queen, and all the convivial company. Octavius was at this time on his march to decide who should be master of the world.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_402"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_406">165:3</a> The friendship of the Portuguese and Melindians was of long continuance. Alvaro Cabral, the second admiral who made the voyage to India, in an engagement with the Moors off the coast of Sofala, took two ships richly freighted from the mines of that <a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a> country. On finding that Xeques Fonteyma, the commander, was uncle to the King of Melinda, he restored the valuable prize, and treated him with the utmost courtesy. Their good offices were reciprocal. By the information of the King of Melinda, Cabral escaped the treachery of the King of Calicut. The Kings of Mombaz and Quiloa, irritated at the alliance with Portugal, made several depredations on the subjects of Melinda, who in return were effectually revenged by their European allies.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_404"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_408">167:2</a> <i>Two gods contending</i>.--According to the fable, Neptune and Minerva disputed the honour of giving a name to the city of Athens. They agreed to determine the contest by a display of their wisdom and power, in conferring the most beneficial gift on mankind. Neptune <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a> struck the earth with his trident and produced the horse, whose bounding motions are emblematical of the agitation of the sea. Pallas commanded the olive-tree, the symbol of peace, and of riches, to spring forth. The victory was adjudged to the goddess, from whom the city was named Athens. The taste of the ancient Grecians clothed almost every occurrence in mythological allegory. The founders of Athens, it is most probable, disputed whether their new city should be named from the fertility of the soil or from the marine situation of Attica. The former opinion prevailed, and the town received its name in honour of the goddess of the olive-tree--<i>Athēnē</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_405"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_409">168:1</a> <i>While Pallas here appears to wave her hand</i>.--As Neptune struck the earth with his trident, Minerva, says the fable, struck the earth with her lance. That she waved her hand while the olive boughs spread, is a fine poetical attitude, and varies the picture from that of Neptune, which follows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_406"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_410">168:2</a> <i>Though wide, and various, o’er the sculptur’d stone</i>.--The description of palaces is a favourite topic several times touched upon by the two great masters of epic poetry, in which they have been happily imitated by their three greatest disciples among the moderns, Camoëns, Tasso, and Milton. The description of the palace of Neptune has great merit. Nothing can be more in place than the picture of chaos and the four elements. The war of the gods, and the contest of Neptune and Minerva are touched with the true boldness of poetical colouring. To show to the English reader that the Portuguese poet is, in his manner, truly classical, is the intention of many of these notes.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_408"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_412">169:1</a> The description of Triton, who, as Fanshaw says--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Was a great nasty clown,"</font></dir>  
 <p>is in the style of the classics. His parentage is differently related. Hesiod makes him the son of Neptune and Amphitrité. By Triton, in the physical sense of the fable, is meant the noise, and by Salacé, the mother by some ascribed to him, the salt, of the ocean. The origin of the fable of Triton, it is probable, was founded on the appearance of a sea animal, which, according to some ancient naturalists, in the upward parts resembles the human figure. Pausanias relates a wonderful story of a monstrously large one, which often came ashore on the meadows of Bœotia. Over his head was a kind of finny cartilage, which, at a distance, appeared like hair; the body covered with brown scales; the nose and ears like the human; the mouth of a dreadful width, jagged with the teeth of a panther; the eyes of a greenish hue; the hands divided into fingers, the nails of which were crooked, and of a shelly substance. This monster, whose extremities ended in a tail like a dolphin’s, devoured both men and beasts as they chanced in his way. The citizens of Tanagra, at last, contrived his destruction. They set a large vessel full of wine on the sea shore. Triton got drunk with it, and fell into a profound sleep, in which condition the Tanagrians beheaded him, and afterwards, with great propriety, hung up his body in the temple of Bacchus; where, says Pausanias, it continued a long time.</p>

In this frenzy he slew Learchus, and drove the mother and her other son, Melicertus, into the sea. The corpse of the mother was thrown ashore on Megara and that of the son at Corinth.

Scylla, on this, threw herself into the sea. and was metamorphosed into the rock which bears her name. The rock Scylla at a distance appears like the statue of a woman.

It is probable, nevertheless, that however adorned with romantic ornament, it is not entirely without foundation in truth. Castera, who unhappily does not cite his authority, gives the names of the twelve Portuguese champions: Alvaro Vaz d’Almada, afterwards Count d’Avranches in Normandy; another Alvaro d’Almada, surnamed the Juster, from his dexterity at that warlike exercise; Lopez Fernando Pacheco; Pedro Homen d’Acosta; Juan Augustin Pereyra; Luis Gonfalez de Malafay; the two brothers Alvaro and Rodrigo Mendez de Cerveyra; Ruy Gomex de Sylva; Soueyro d’Acosta, who gave his name to the river Acosta in Africa; Martin Lopez d’Azevedo; and Alvaro Gonfalez de Coutigno, surnamed Magricio. The names of the English champions, and of the ladies, he confesses are unknown, nor does history positively explain the injury of which the dames complained. It must, however, he adds, have been such as required the atonement of blood; <i>il falloit qu’elle fût sanglante</i>, since two sovereigns allowed to determine it by the sword. "Some critics," says Castera, "may perhaps condemn this episode of Camoëns; but for my part," he continues, "I think the adventure of Olindo and Sophronia, in Tasso, is much more to be blamed. The episode of the Italian poet is totally exuberant, whereas that of the Portuguese has a direct relation to his proposed subject: the wars of his country, a vast field, in which he has admirably succeeded, without prejudice to the first rule of the epopea, the unity of the action." The severest critic must allow that the episode related by Veloso, is happily introduced. To one who has ever been at sea, the scene must be particularly pleasing. The fleet is under sail, they plough the smooth deep--</p>

Some Spanish chronicles relate that Charles VII. of France, having assembled the states of his kingdom, cited Philip to appear with his other vassals. Isabella, who was present, solemnly protested that the earls of Flanders were not obliged to do homage. A dispute arose, on which she offered, according to the custom of that age, to appeal to the fate of arms. The proposal was accepted, and Magricio the champion of Isabella, vanquished a French chevalier, appointed by Charles. Though our authors do not mention this adventure, and though Emmanuel de Faria, and the best Portuguese writers treat it with doubt, nothing to the disadvantage of Camoëns is thence to be inferred. A poet is not obliged always to follow the truth of history.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_431"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_435">182:3</a> <i>The Rhine another pass’d, and prov’d his might</i>.--This was Alvaro Vaz d’Almada. The chronicle of Garibay relates, that at Basle he <a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a> received from a German a challenge to measure swords, on condition that each should fight with the right side unarmed; the German by this hoping to be victorious, for he was left-handed. The Portuguese, suspecting no fraud, accepted. When the combat began he perceived the inequality. His right side unarmed was exposed to the enemy, whose left side, which was nearest to him was defended with half a cuirass. Notwithstanding all this, the brave Alvaro obtained the victory. He sprang upon the German, seized him, and, grasping him forcibly in his arms, stifled and crushed him to death; imitating the conduct of Hercules, who in the same manner slew the cruel Anteus. Here we ought to remark the address of our author; he describes at length the injury and grief of the English ladies, the voyage of the twelve champions to England, and the prowess they there displayed. When Veloso relates these, the sea is calm; but no sooner does it begin to be troubled, than the soldier abridges his recital: we see him follow by degrees the preludes of the storm, we perceive the anxiety of his mind on the view of the approaching danger, hastening his narration to an end. Behold the strokes of a master!--<i>This note, and the one preceding, are from Castera</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_432"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_436">185:1</a> <i>The halcyons, mindful of their fate, deplore</i>.--Ceyx, king of Trachinia, son of Lucifer, married Alcyone, the daughter of Eolus. On a voyage to consult the Delphic Oracle, he was shipwrecked. His corpse was thrown ashore in the view of his spouse, who, in the agonies of her love and despair, threw herself into the sea. The gods, in pity of her pious fidelity, metamorphosed them into the birds which bear her name. The halcyon is a little bird about the size of a thrush, its plumage of a beautiful sky blue, mixed with some traits of white and carnation. It is vulgarly called the kingfisher. The halcyons very seldom appear but in the finest weather, whence they are fabled to build their nests on the waves. The female is no less remarkable than the turtle, for her conjugal affection. She nourishes and attends the male when sick, and survives his death but a few days. When the halcyons are surprised in a tempest, they fly about as in the utmost terror, with the most lamentable and doleful cries. To introduce them, therefore, in the picture of a storm is a proof, both of the taste and judgment of Camoëns.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_433"></a><a href="lusbk06.htm#fr_437">186:1</a> <i>With shrill, faint voice, th’ untimely ghost complains</i>.--It may not perhaps be unentertaining to cite Madame Dacier and Mr. Pope on the voices of the dead. It will, at least, afford a critical observation which appears to have escaped them both. "The shades of the suitors," observes Dacier, "when they are summoned by Mercury out of the palace of Ulysses, emit a feeble, plaintive, inarticulate sound, τρίζουσι, strident: whereas Agamemnon, and the shades that have been long in the state of the dead, speak articulately. I doubt not but Homer intended to show, by the former description, that when the soul is separated from the organs of the body, it ceases to act after the same manner as while it was joined to it; but how the dead recover their voices afterwards is not easy to understand. In other respects Virgil paints after Homer:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">                     <i>Pars tollere vocem<br> Exiguam: inceptus clamor frustratur hiantes</i>."</font></dir>  
 <p>To this Mr. Pope replies, "But why should we suppose, with Dacier, that these shades of the suitors (of Penelope) have lost the faculty of speaking? I rather imagine that the sounds they uttered were signs of complaint and discontent, and proceeded not from an inability to speak. After Patroclus was slain he appears to Achilles, and speaks very articulately to him; yet, to express his sorrow at his departure, he acts like these suitors: for Achilles--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">‘Like a thin smoke beholds the spirit fly,<br> And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.’</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Dacier conjectures that the power of speech ceases in the dead, till they are admitted into a state of rest; but Patroclus is an instance to the contrary in the Iliad, and Elpenor in the Odyssey, for they both speak before their funereal rites are performed, and consequently before they enter into a state of repose amongst the shades of the happy."</p>  
 <p>The critic, in his search for distant proofs, often omits the most material one immediately at hand. Had Madame Dacier attended to the episode of the souls of the suitors, the world had never seen her ingenuity in these mythological conjectures; nor had Mr. Pope any need to bring the case of Patroclus or Elpenor to overthrow her system. Amphimedon, one of the suitors, in the very episode which gave birth to Dacier’s conjecture, tells his story very articulately to the shade of Agamemnon, though he had not received the funereal rites:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Our mangled bodies, now deform’d with gore,<br> Cold and neglected spread the marble floor:<br> No friend to bathe our wounds! or tears to shed<br> O’er the pale corse! the honours of the dead."<br>                                                 ODYS. xxiv.</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> On the whole, the defence of Pope is almost as idle as the conjectures <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a> of Dacier. The plain truth is, poetry delights in personification; everything in it, as Aristotle says of the Iliad, has manners; poetry must therefore personify according to our ideas. Thus in Milton:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Tears, such as angels weep, burst forth."</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And thus in Homer, while the suitors are conducted to hell:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Trembling, the spectres glide, and plaintive vent<br> Thin, hollow screams, along the deep descent:"</font></dir>  
 <p>and, unfettered with mythological distinctions, either shriek or articulately talk, according to the most poetical view of their supposed circumstances.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> In innumerable instances Camoëns discovers himself a judicious imitator of the ancients. In the two great masters of the epic are several prophecies oracular of the fate of different heroes, which give an air of solemn importance to the poem. The fate of the Armada thus obscurely anticipated, resembles in particular the prophecy of the safe return of Ulysses to Ithaca, foretold by the shade of Tiresias, which was afterwards fulfilled by the Phæacians. It remains now to make some observations on the machinery used by Camoëns in this book. The necessity of machinery in the epopea, and the, perhaps, insurmountable difficulty of finding one unexceptionably adapted to a poem where the heroes are Christians, or, in other words, to a poem whose subject is modern, have already been observed in the preface. The machinery of Camoëns has also been proved, in every respect, to be less exceptionable than that of Tasso in his Jerusalem, or that of Voltaire in his Henriade. The descent of Bacchus to the palace of Neptune, in the depths of the sea, and his address to the watery gods, are noble imitations of Virgil’s Juno in the first Æneid. The description of the storm is also masterly. In both instances the conduct of the Æneid is joined with the descriptive exuberance of the Odyssey. The appearance of the star of Venus through the storm is finely imagined; the influence of the nymphs of that goddess over the winds, and their subsequent nuptials, are in the spirit of the promise of Juno to Eolus:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1"><i>Sunt mihi bis septum præstanti corpore nymphæ:<br> Quarum, gum forma pulcherrima; Deiopeiam</i> <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a><br> <i>Connubio jungam stabili, propriamque dicabo:<br> Omnes ut tecum meritis pro talibus annos<br> Exigat, et pulchra faciat to prole párentem</i>.--VIRGIL, ÆN. bk. i.</font></dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And the fiction itself is an allegory, exactly in the manner of Homer. Orithia, the daughter of Erecteus, and queen of the Amazons, was ravished and carried away by Boreas.</p>
