 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FOLLY OF BEING COMFORTED.</h3>
 <p>One that is ever kind said yesterday<br>
 'Your well beloved's hair has threads of grey<br>
 And little shadows come about her eyes;<br>
 Time can but make it easier to be wise<br>
 Though now it's hard, till trouble is at an end;<br>
 And so be patient, be wise and patient, friend.'<br>
 But heart, there is no comfort, not a grain.<br>
 Time can but make her beauty over again<br>
 Because of that great nobleness of hers;<br>

 Burns but more clearly; O she had not these ways<br>
 When all the wild summer was in her gaze.<br>
 O heart, O heart, if she'd but turn her head,<br>
 You'd know the folly of being comforted.</p>
