 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SONG OF RED HANRAHAN.</h3>
 <p>The old brown thorn trees break in two high over Cummen Strand<br>
 Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand,<br>
 Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies;<br>
 But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes<br>
 Of Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan.</p>
 <p>The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knocknarea <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a><br>
 And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say.<br>
 Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat;<br>
 But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet<br>
 Of Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan.</p>
 <p>The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare,<br>
 For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air;<br>
 Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood;<br>
 But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood<br>
 Is Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan.</p>
