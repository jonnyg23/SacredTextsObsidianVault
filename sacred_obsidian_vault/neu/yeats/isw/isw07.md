 <h3 align="CENTER">ADAM'S CURSE.</h3>
 <p>We sat together at one summer's end<br>
 That beautiful mild woman your close friend<br>
 And you and I, and talked of poetry.</p>
 <p>I said 'a line will take us hours maybe,<br>
 Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought<br>
 Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.<br>
 Better go down upon your marrow bones<br>
 And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones<br>
 Like an old pauper in all kinds of weather;<br>
 For to articulate sweet sounds together<br>
 Is to work harder than all these and yet<br>
 Be thought an idler by the noisy set<br>
 Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen<br>
 The martyrs call the world.' <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a><br>
                             That woman then<br>
 Murmured with her young voice, for whose mild sake<br>
 There's many a one shall find out all heartache<br>
 In finding that it's young and mild and low.<br>
 'There is one thing that all we women know<br>
 Although we never heard of it at school,<br>
 That we must labour to be beautiful.'</p>
 <p>I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing<br>
 Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.<br>
 There have been lovers who thought love should be<br>
 So much compounded of high courtesy<br>
 That they would sigh and quote with learned looks<br>
 Precedents out of beautiful old books;<br>
 Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'</p>
 <p>We sat grown quiet at the name of love,<br>
 We saw the last embers of daylight die<br>
 And in the trembling blue-green of the sky<br>
 A moon, worn as if it had been a shell <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a><br>
 Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell<br>
 About the stars and broke in days and years.</p>
 <p>I had a thought for no one's but your ears<br>
 That you were beautiful and that I strove<br>
 To love you in the old high way of love<br>
 That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown<br>
 As weary hearted as that hollow moon.</p>
