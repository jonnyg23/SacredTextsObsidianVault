 <h3 align="CENTER">THE WITHERING OF THE BOUGHS.</h3>
 <p>I cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds,<br>
 'Let peewit call and curlew cry where they will,<br>
 I long for your merry and tender and pitiful words,<br>
 For the roads are unending and there is no place to my mind.'<br>
 The honey-pale Moon lay low on the sleepy hill<br>
 And I fell asleep upon lonely Echtge of streams;<br>
 No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,<br>
 The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</p>
 <p>I know of the leafy paths that the witches take,<br>
 Who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool, <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a><br>
 And their secret smile, out of the depths of the lake;<br>
 And of apple islands where the Danaan kind<br>
 Wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool<br>
 On the island lawns, their feet where the pale foam gleams;<br>
 No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,<br>
 The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</p>
 <p>I know of the sleepy country, where swans fly round<br>
 Coupled with golden chains and sing as they fly,<br>
 A king and a queen are wandering there, and the sound<br>
 Has made them so happy and hopeless, so deaf and so blind<br>
 With wisdom, they wander till all the years have gone by; <br>
 I know, and the curlew and peewit on Echtge of streams;<br>
 No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,<br>
 The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</p>
