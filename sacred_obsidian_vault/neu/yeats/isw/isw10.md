 <h3 align="CENTER">UNDER THE MOON.</h3>
 <p>I have no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde;<br>
 Nor Avalon the grass green hollow, nor Joyous Isle,<br>
 Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid him for a while,<br>
 Nor Ulad when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind,<br>
 Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart,<br>
 Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon's light and the sun's<br>
 Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long lived ones,<br>
 Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the gates apart, <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a><br>
 And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn<br>
 To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier:<br>
 Therein are many queens like Branwen, and Guinivere;<br>
 And Niam, and Laban, and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn<br>
 And the wood-woman whose love was changed to a blue-eyed hawk;<br>
 And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore,<br>
 Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar,<br>
 I hear the harp string praise them or hear their mournful talk.<br>
 Because of a story I heard under the thin horn<br>
 Of the third moon, that hung between the night and the day,<br>
 To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay,<br>
 Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.</p>
