 </i><p>The host is riding from Knocknarea,<br> And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare;<br> Caolte tossing his burning hair,<br> And Niamh calling, 'Away, come away;<br> Empty your heart of its mortal dream.<br> The winds awaken, the leaves whirl round,<br> Our cheeks are pale, our hair is unbound,<br> Our breasts are heaving, our eyes are a-gleam,<br> Our arms are waving, our lips are apart,<br> And if any gaze on our rushing band,<br> We come between him and the deed of his hand,<br> We come between him and the hope of his heart.'<br> The host is rushing 'twixt night and day;<br> And where is there hope or deed as fair?<br> Caolte tossing his burning hair,<br> And Niamh calling, 'Away, come away.' </p>
