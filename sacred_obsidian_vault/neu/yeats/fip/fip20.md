 <h1 align="CENTER">THE TROOPING FAIRIES</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">THE MERROW</h2>
 <p>The Merrow, of if you write it in the Irish, <i>Moruadh</i> or <i>Murúghach</i>, from <i>muir</i>, sea, and <i>oigh</i>, a maid, is not uncommon, they say, on the wilder coasts. The fishermen do not like to see them, for it always means coming gales. The male <i>Merrows</i> (if you can use such a phrase--I have never heard the masculine of Merrow) have green teeth, green hair, pig's eyes, and red noses; but their women are beautiful, for all their fish tails and the little duck-like scale between their fingers. Sometimes they prefer, small blame to them, good-looking fishermen to their sea lovers. Near Bantry in the last century, there is said to have been a woman covered all over with scales like a fish, who was descended from such a marriage. Sometimes they come out of the sea, and wander about the shore in the shape of little hornless cows. They have, when in their own shape, a red cap, called a <i>cohullen druith</i>, usually covered with feathers. If this is stolen, they cannot again go down under the waves.</p>
 <p>Red is the colour of magic in every country, and has been so from the very earliest times. The caps of fairies and magicians are well-nigh always red.</p>
