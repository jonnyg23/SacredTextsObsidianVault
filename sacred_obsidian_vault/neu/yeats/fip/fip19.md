 <h3 align="CENTER">THE STOLEN CHILD.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">W. B. YEATS</p><dir>

 <p>Where dips the rocky highland<br>
   Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,<br>
 There lies a leafy island<br>
   Where flapping herons wake<br>
 The drowsy water-rats.<br>
 There we've hid our fairy vats<br>
 Full of berries,<br>
 And of reddest stolen cherries.<br>
 Come away, O, human child!<br>
 To the woods and waters wild<br>
 With a fairy hand in hand,<br>
 For the world's more full of weeping than<br>
            you can understand.</p>
 <p>Where the wave of moonlight glosses<br>
   The dim grey sands with light,<br>
 Far off by farthest Rosses<br>
   We foot it all the night,<br>
 Weaving olden dances,<br>
 Mingling hands, and mingling glances,<br>
   Till the moon has taken flight; <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a><br>
 To and fro we leap,<br>
   And chase the frothy bubbles,<br>
   While the world is full of troubles<br>
 And is anxious in its sleep.<br>
 Come away! O, human child!<br>
 To the woods and waters wild,<br>
 With a fairy hand in hand,<br>
 For the world's more full of weeping than<br>
            you can understand.</p>
 <p>Where the wandering water gushes<br>
   From the hills above Glen-Car,<br>
 In pools among the rushes,<br>
   That scarce could bathe a star,<br>
 We seek for slumbering trout,<br>
   And whispering in their ears;<br>
     We give them evil dreams,<br>
 Leaning softly out<br>
   From ferns that drop their tears<br>
     Of dew on the young streams.<br>
 Come! O, human child!<br>
 To the woods and waters wild,<br>
 With a fairy hand in hand,<br>
 For the world's more full of weeping then<br>
            you can understand.</p>
 <p>Away with us, he's going,<br>
   The solemn-eyed;<br>
 He'll hear no more the lowing<br>
   Of the calves on the warm hill-side.<br>
 Or the kettle on the hob<br>
   Sing peace into his breast;<br>
 Or see the brown mice bob<br>
   Round and round the oatmeal chest.<br>
 For he comes, the human child,<br>
 To the woods and waters wild,<br>
 With a fairy hand in hand,<br>
 For the world's more full of weeping than<br>
            he can understand.</p>
