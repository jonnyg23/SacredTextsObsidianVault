 <p align="CENTER">LETITIA MACLINTOCK</p>
 <p>Ay, it's a bad thing to displeasure the gentry, sure enough--they can be unfriendly if they're angered, an' they can be the very best o' gude neighbours if they're treated kindly.</p>
 <p>My mother's sister was her lone in the house one day, wi' a big pot o' water boiling on the fire, and ane o' the wee folk fell down the chimney, and slipped wi' his leg in the hot water.</p>
 <p>He let a terrible squeal out o' him, an' in a minute the house was full o' wee crathurs pulling him out o' the pot, an' carrying him across the floor.</p>
 <p>"Did she scald you?" my aunt heard them saying to him.</p>
 <p>"Na, na, it was mysel' scalded my ainsel'," quoth the wee fellow.</p>
 <p>"A weel, a weel," says they. "If it was your ainsel scalded yoursel', we'll say nothing, but if she had scalded you, we'd ha' made her pay."</p>
