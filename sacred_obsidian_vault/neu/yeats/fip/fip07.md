 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FAIRY WELL OF LAGNANAY</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">BY SAMUEL FERGUSON.</p><dir>

 <p>Mournfully, sing mournfully-<br>
   "O listen, Ellen, sister dear:<br>
 Is there no help at all for me,<br>
   But only ceaseless sigh and tear?<br>
   Why did not he who left me here, <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a><br>
 With stolen hope steal memory?<br>
   O listen, Ellen, sister dear,<br>
 (Mournfully, sing mournfully)--<br>
   I'll go away to Sleamish hill,<br>
 I'll pluck the fairy hawthorn-tree,<br>
   And let the spirits work their will;<br>
 I care not if for good or ill,<br>
   So they but lay the memory<br>
 Which all my heart is haunting still!<br>
   (Mournfully, sing mournfully)--<br>
 The Fairies are a silent race,<br>
   And pale as lily flowers to see;<br>
 I care not for a blanched face,<br>
   For wandering in a dreaming place,<br>
   So I but banish memory:--<br>
 I wish I were with Anna Grace!<br>
   Mournfully, sing mournfully!</p>
 <p>Hearken to my tale of woe--<br>
   'Twas thus to weeping Ellen Con,<br>
 Her sister said in accents low,<br>
   Her only sister, Una bawn:<br>
   'Twas in their bed before the dawn,<br>
 And Ellen answered sad and slow,--<br>
   "Oh Una, Una, be not drawn<br>
 (Hearken to my tale of woe)--<br>
   To this unholy grief I pray,<br>
 Which makes me sick at heart to know,<br>
   And I will help you if I may:<br>
 --The Fairy Well of Lagnanay--<br>
   Lie nearer me, I tremble so,--<br>
 Una, I've heard wise women say<br>
   (Hearken to my tale of woe)--<br>
 That if before the dews arise,<br>
   True maiden in its icy flow<br>
 With pure hand bathe her bosom thrice,<br>
   Three lady-brackens pluck likewise, <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a><br>
 And three times round the fountain go,<br>
   She straight forgets her tears and sighs."<br>
 Hearken to my tale of woe!</p>
 <p>All, alas! and well-away!<br>
   "Oh, sister Ellen, sister sweet,<br>
 Come with me to the hill I pray,<br>
   And I will prove that blessed freet!"<br>
   They rose with soft and silent feet,<br>
 They left their mother where she lay,<br>
   Their mother and her care discreet,<br>
 (All, alas and well-away!)<br>
   And soon they reached the Fairy Well,<br>
 The mountain's eye, clear, cold and grey,<br>
   Wide open in the dreary fell:<br>
 How long they stood 'twere vain to tell,<br>
   At last upon the point of day,<br>
 Bawn Una bares her bosom's swell,<br>
   (All, alas and well-away!)<br>
 Thrice o'er her shrinking breasts she laves<br>
   The gliding glance that will not stay<br>
 Of subtly-streaming fairy waves:--<br>
   And now the charm three brackens craves,<br>
 She plucks them in their fring'd array:--<br>
   Now round the well her fate she braves,<br>
 All, alas! and well-away!</p>
 <p>Save us all from Fairy thrall!<br>
   Ellen sees her face the rim<br>
 Twice and thrice, and that is all--<br>
   Fount and hill and maiden swim<br>
   All together melting dim!<br>
 "Una! Una!" thou may'st call,<br>
   Sister sad! but lith or limb<br>
 (Save us all from Fairy thrall! )<br>
   Never again of Una bawn, <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a><br>
 Where now she walks in dreamy hall,<br>
   Shall eye of mortal look upon!<br>
   Oh! can it be the guard was gone,<br>
 The better guard than shield or wall?<br>
   Who knows on earth save Jurlagh Daune?<br>
 (Save us all from Fairy thrall! )<br>
   Behold the banks are green and bare,<br>
 No pit is here wherein to fall:<br>
   Aye--at the fount you well may stare,<br>
   But nought save pebbles smooth is there,<br>
 And small straws twirling one and all.<br>
   Hie thee home, and be thy pray'r,<br>
 Save us all from Fairy thrall.</p>
