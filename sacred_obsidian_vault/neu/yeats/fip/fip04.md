 <p>Up the airy mountain,<br>
   Down the rushy glen,<br>
 We daren't go a-hunting<br>
   For fear of little men;<br>
 Wee folk, good folk,<br>
   Trooping all together;<br>
 Green jacket, red cap,<br>
   And white owl's feather!</p></dir>

 <p>Down along the rocky shore<br>
   Some make their home,<br>
 They live on crispy pancakes<br>
   Of yellow tide-foam;<br>
 Some in the reeds<br>
   Of the black mountain lake,<br>
 With frogs for their watch-dogs,<br>
   All night awake.</p>
 <p>High on the hill-top<br>
   The old King sits;<br>
 He is now so old and grey<br>
   He's nigh lost his wits.<br>
 With a bridge of white mist<br>
   Columbkill he crosses,<br>
 On his stately journeys<br>
   From Slieveleague to Rosses;<br>
 Or going up with music<br>
   On cold starry nights,<br>
 To sup with the Queen<br>
   Of the gay Northern Lights.</p>
 <p>They stole little Bridget<br>
   For seven years long;<br>
 When she came down again<br>
   Her friends were all gone.<br>
 They took her lightly back,<br>
   Between the night and morrow,<br>
 They thought that she was fast asleep,<br>
   But she was dead with sorrow.<br>
 They have kept her ever since<br>
   Deep within the lake,<br>
 On a bed of flag-leaves,<br>
   Watching till she wake.</p>
 <p>By the craggy hill-side,<br>
   Through the mosses bare,<br>
 They have planted thorn-trees<br>
   For pleasure here and there. <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a><br>
 Is any man so daring<br>
   As dig them up in spite,<br>
 He shall find their sharpest thorns<br>
   In his bed at night.</p>
 <p>Up the airy mountain,<br>
   Down the rushy glen,<br>
 We daren't go a-hunting<br>
   For fear of little men;<br>
 Wee folk, good folk,<br>
   Trooping all together;<br>
 Green jacket, red cap,<br>
   And white owl's feather!</p>
