 <h3 align="CENTER">SHONEEN AND SLEIVEEN.--Page <a href="fip59.htm#page_220">220</a>.</h3>
 <i></i><p>Shoneen is the diminutive of <i>shone</i> [Ir. <i>Seón</i>]. There are two Irish names for John--one is <i>Shone</i>, the other is <i>Shawn</i> [Ir. <i>Seághan</i>]. Shone is the "grandest" of the two, and is applied to the gentry. Hence <i>Shoneen</i> means "a little gentry John", and is applied to upstarts and "big" farmers, who ape the rank of gentleman.</p>
 <i></i><p>Sleiveen, not to be found in the dictionaries, is a comical Irish word (at least in Connaught) for a rogue. It probably comes from <i>sliabh</i>, a mountain, meaning primarily a mountaineer, and in a secondary sense, on the principle that mountaineers are worse than anybody else, a rogue. I am indebted to Mr. Douglas Hyde for these details, as for many others.</p>
