 <h3 align="CENTER">HY-BRASAIL--THE ISLE OF THE BLEST</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">Gerald Griffin</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>On the ocean that hollows the rocks where ye dwell,<br>
 A shadowy land has appeared, as they tell;<br>
 Men thought it a region of sunshine and rest,<br>
 And they called it <i>Hy-Brasail</i>, the isle of the blest.<br>
 From year unto year on the ocean's blue rim,<br>
 The beautiful spectre showed lovely and dim;<br>
 The golden clouds curtained the deep where it lay,<br>
 And it looked like an Eden, away, far away!</p>
 <p>A peasant who heard of the wonderful tale,<br>
 In the breeze of the Orient loosened his sail;<br>
 From Ara, the holy, he turned to the west,<br>
 For though Ara was holy, <i>Hy-Brasail</i> was blest.<br>
 He heard not the voices that called from the shore--<br>
 He heard not the rising wind's menacing roar;<br>
 Home, kindred, and safety, he left on that day,<br>
 And he sped to <i>Hy-Brasail</i>, away, far away!</p>
 <p>Morn rose on the deep, and that shadowy isle,<br>
 O'er the faint rim of distance, reflected its smile;<br>
 Noon burned on the wave, and that shadowy shore<br>
 Seemed lovelily distant, and faint as before;<br>
 Lone evening came down on the wanderer's track,<br>
 And to Ara again he looked timidly back;<br>
 Oh! far on the verge of the ocean it lay,<br>
 Yet the isle of the blest was away, far away!</p>
 <p>Rash dreamer, return! O, ye winds of the main,<br>
 Bear him back to his own peaceful Ara again.<br>
 Rash fool! for a vision of fanciful bliss,<br>
 To barter thy calm life of labour and peace.<br>
 The warning of reason was spoken in vain;<br>
 He never revisited Ara again!<br>
 Night fell on the deep, amidst tempest and spray,<br>
 And he died on the waters, away, far away!</p>
