 <p>I HAD this thought awhile ago,<br> "My darling cannot understand<br> What I have done, or what would do<br> In this blind bitter land."</p>  
 <p>And I grew weary of the sun<br> Until my thoughts cleared up again,<br> Remembering that the best I have done<br> Was done to make it plain;</p>  
 <p>That every year I have cried, "At length<br> My darling understands it all,<br> Because I have come into my strength,<br> And words obey my call";</p>  
 <p>That had she done so who can say<br> What would have shaken from the sieve?<br> I might have thrown poor words away<br> And been content to live.</p>
