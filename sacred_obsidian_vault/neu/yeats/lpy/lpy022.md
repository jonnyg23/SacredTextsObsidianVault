 <p>THE jester walked in the garden:<br> The garden had fallen still;<br> He bade his soul rise upward<br> And stand on her window-sill.</p>  
 <p>It rose in a straight blue garment,<br> When owls began to call:<br> It had grown wise-tongued by thinking<br> Of a quiet and light footfall;</p>  
 <p>But the young queen would not listen;<br> She rose in her pale night gown;<br> She drew in the heavy casement<br> And pushed the latches down.</p>  
 <p>He bade his heart go to her,<br> When the owls called out no more;<br> In a red and quivering garment<br> It sang to her through the door.</p>  
 <p>It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming,<br> Of a flutter of flower-like hair;<br> But she took up her fan from the table<br> And waved it off on the air. <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>"I have cap and bells," he pondered,<br> "I will send them to her and die";<br> And when the morning whitened<br> He left them where she went by.</p>  
 <p>She laid them upon her bosom,<br> Under a cloud of her hair,<br> And her red lips sang them a love-song:<br> Till stars grew out of the air.</p>  
 <p>She opened her door and her window,<br> And the heart and the soul came through,<br> To her right hand came the red one,<br> To her left hand came the blue.</p>  
 <p>They set up a noise like crickets,<br> A chattering wise and sweet,<br> And her hair was a folded flower<br> And the quiet of love in her feet.</p>
