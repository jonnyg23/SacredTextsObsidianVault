 <p>FIVE-AND-TWENTY years have gone<br> Since old William Pollexfen<br> Laid his strong bones down in death<br> By his wife Elizabeth<br> In the grey stone tomb he made.<br> And after twenty years they laid<br> In that tomb by him and her,<br> His son George, the astrologer;<br> And Masons drove from miles away<br> To scatter the Acacia spray<br> Upon a melancholy man<br> Who had ended where his breath began.<br> Many a son and daughter lies<br> Far from the customary skies,<br> The Mall and Eades's grammar school,<br> In London or in Liverpool;<br> But where is laid the sailor John?<br> That so many lands had known:<br> Quiet lands or unquiet seas<br> Where the Indians trade or Japanese.<br> He never found his rest ashore<br> Moping for one voyage more.<br> Where have they laid the sailor John? <a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 289</font></a><br> And yesterday the youngest son,<br> A humorous, unambitious man,<br> Was buried near the astrologer;<br> And are we now in the tenth year?<br> Since he, who had been contented long,<br> A nobody in a great throng,<br> Decided he would journey home,<br> Now that his fiftieth year had come,<br> And "Mr. Alfred" be again<br> Upon the lips of common men<br> Who carried in their memory<br> His childhood and his family.<br> At all these death-beds women heard<br> A visionary white sea-bird<br> Lamenting that a man should die;<br> And with that cry I have raised my cry.</p>
