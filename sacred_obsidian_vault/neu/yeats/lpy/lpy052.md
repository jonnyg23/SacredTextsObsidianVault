 <p>O HURRY where by water among the trees,<br> The delicate stepping stag and his lady sigh<br> When they have but looked upon their images,<br> Would none had ever loved but you and I!</p>  
 <p>Or have you heard that sliding silver-shoed,<br> Pale silver-proud queen-woman of the sky,<br> When the sun looked out of his golden hood:<br> O that none ever loved but you and I!</p>  
 <p>O hurry to the ragged wood, for there<br> I will drive all those lovers out and cry--<br> O my share of the world, O yellow hair,<br> No one has ever loved but you and I!</p>
