 <p align="center">HIC</p>  
 <p>ON the grey sand beside the shallow stream<br> Under your old wind-beaten tower, where still<br> A lamp burns on beside the open book<br> That Michael Robartes left, you walk in the moon<br> And though you have passed the best of life still trace<br> Enthralled by the unconquerable delusion<br> Magical shapes.</p>  
 <p align="center">ILLE</p>  
 <p>By the help of an image<br> I call to my own opposite, summon all<br> That I have handled least, least looked upon.</p>  
 <p align="center">HIC</p>  
 <p>And I would find myself and not an image.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 296</font></a></p>

 <p>That is our modern hope and by its light<br> We have lit upon the gentle, sensitive mind<br> And lost the old nonchalance of the hand;<br> Whether we have chosen chisel, pen or brush<br> We are but critics, or but half create<br> Timid, entangled, empty and abashed<br> Lacking the countenance of our friends.</p>  
 <p align="center">HIC</p>  
 <p>                                     And yet<br> The chief imagination of Christendom<br> Dante Alighieri so utterly found himself<br> That he has made that hollow face of his<br> More plain to the mind's eye than any face<br> But that of Christ.</p>  
 <p align="center">ILLE</p>  
 <p>                      And did he find himself<br> Or was the hunger that had made it hollow<br> A hunger for the apple on the bough<br> Most out of reach? and is that spectral image<br> The man that Lapo and that Guido knew?<br> I think he fashioned from his opposite<br> An image that might have been a stony face,<br> Staring upon a bedouin's horse-hair roof <a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a><br> From doored and windowed cliff, or half upturned<br> Among the coarse grass and the camel dung.<br> He set his chisel to the hardest stone.<br> Being mocked by Guido for his lecherous life<br> Derided and deriding, driven out<br> To climb that stair and eat that bitter bread,<br> He found the unpersuadable justice, he found<br> The most exalted lady loved by a man.</p>  
 <p align="center">HIC</p>  
 <p>Yet surely there are men who have made their art<br> Out of no tragic war, lovers of life,<br> Impulsive men that look for happiness<br> And sing when they have found it.</p>  
 <p align="center">ILLE</p>  
 <p>                               No not sing,<br> For those that love the world serve it in action,<br> Grow rich, popular and full of influence,<br> And should they paint or write still it is action:<br> The struggle of the fly in marmalade.<br> The rhetorician would deceive his neighbours, <a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a>S<br> The sentimentalist himself; while art<br> Is but a vision of reality.<br> What portion in the world can the artist have<br> Who has awakened from the common dream<br> But dissipation and despair?</p>  
 <p align="center">HIC</p>  
 <p>                                 And yet<br> No one denies to Keats love of the world;<br> Remember his deliberate happiness.</p>  
 <p align="center">ILLE</p>  
 <p>His art is happy but who knows his mind?<br> I see a schoolboy when I think of him<br> With face and nose pressed to a sweet-shop window,<br> For certainly he sank into his grave<br> His senses and his heart unsatisfied,<br> And made--being poor, ailing and ignorant,<br> Shut out from all the luxury of the world,<br> The coarse-bred son of a livery stable-keeper-<br> Luxuriant song.</p>  
 <p align="center">HIC</p>  
 <p>Why should you leave the lamp<br> Burning alone beside an open book, <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a><br> And trace these characters upon the sands?<br> A style is found by sedentary toil<br> And by the imitation of great masters.</p>  
 <p align="center">ILLE</p>  
 <p>Because I seek an image not a book.<br> Those men that in their writings are most wise<br> Own nothing but their blind, stupefied hearts.<br> I call to the mysterious one who yet<br> Shall walk the wet sands by the edge of the stream<br> And look most like me, being indeed my double,<br> And prove of all imaginable things<br> The most unlike, being my anti-self,<br> And standing by these characters disclose<br> All that I seek; and whisper it as though<br> He .were afraid the birds, who cry aloud<br> Their momentary cries before it is dawn,<br> Would carry it away to blasphemous men.</p>
