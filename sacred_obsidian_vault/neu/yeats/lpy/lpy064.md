 <p>"WOULD it were anything but merely voice!"<br> The No King cried who after that was King,<br> Because he had not heard of anything<br> That balanced with a word is more than noise;<br> Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail<br> Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,<br> Though he'd but cannon--Whereas we that had thought<br> To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale<br> Have been defeated by that pledge you gave<br> In momentary anger long ago;<br> And I that have not your faith, how shall I know<br> That in the blinding light beyond the grave<br> We'll find so good a thing as that we have lost?<br> The hourly kindness, the day's common speech,<br> The habitual content of each with each<br> When neither soul nor body has been crossed.</p>
