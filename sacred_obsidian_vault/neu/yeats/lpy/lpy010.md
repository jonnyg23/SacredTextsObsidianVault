 <p>OUT-WORN heart, in a time out-worn,<br> Come clear of the nets of wrong and right;<br> Laugh, heart, again in the grey twilight,<br> Sigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.</p>  
 <p>Your mother Eire is always young,<br> Dew ever shining and twilight grey;<br> Though hope fall from you and love decay,<br> Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue.</p>  
 <p>Come, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill:<br> For there the mystical brotherhood<br> Of sun and moon and hollow and wood<br> And river and stream work out their will;</p>  
 <p>And God stands winding His lonely horn,<br> And time and the world are ever in flight;<br> And love is less kind than the grey twilight,<br> And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.</p>
