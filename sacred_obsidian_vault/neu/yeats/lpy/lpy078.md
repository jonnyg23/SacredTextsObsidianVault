 <p>ALL things can tempt me from this craft of verse:<br> One time it was a woman's face, or worse--<br> The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;<br> Now nothing but comes readier to the hand<br> Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,<br> I had not given a penny for a song<br> Did not the poet sing it with such airs<br> That one believed he had a sword upstairs;<br> Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,<br> Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish.</p>
