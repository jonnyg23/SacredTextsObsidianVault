 <p>Now must I these three praise--<br> Three women that have wrought<br> What joy is in my days;<br> One that no passing thought,<br> Nor those unpassing cares,<br> No, not in these fifteen<br> Many times troubled years,<br> Could ever come between<br> Heart and delighted heart;<br> And one because her hand<br> Had strength that could unbind<br> What none can understand,<br> What none can have and thrive,<br> Youth's dreamy load, till she<br> So changed me that I live<br> Labouring in ecstasy.<br> And what of her that took<br> All till my youth was gone<br> With scarce a pitying look?<br> How should I praise that one?<br> When day begins to break<br> I count my good and bad,<br> Being wakeful for her sake, <a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a><br> Remembering what she had,<br> What eagle look still shows,<br> While up from my heart's root<br> So great a sweetness flows<br> I shake from head to foot.</p>
