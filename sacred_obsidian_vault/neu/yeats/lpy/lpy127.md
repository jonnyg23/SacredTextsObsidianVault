 <p>I WOULD be ignorant as the dawn<br> That has looked down<br> On that old queen measuring a town<br> With the pin of a brooch,<br> Or on the withered men that saw<br> From their pedantic Babylon<br> The careless planets in their courses,<br> The stars fade out where the moon comes,<br> And took their tablets and did sums;<br> I would be ignorant as the dawn<br> That merely stood, rocking the glittering coach<br> Above the cloudy shoulders of the horses;<br> I would be--for no knowledge is worth a straw--<br> Ignorant and wanton as the dawn.</p>
