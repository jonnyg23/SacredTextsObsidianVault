 <p><i>PARDON, old fathers, if you still remain<br> Somewhere in ear-shot for the story's end,<br> Old Dublin merchant "free of ten and four"<br> Or trading out of Galway into Spain;<br> And country scholar, Robert Emmet's friend,<br> A hundred-year-old memory to the poor;<br> Traders or soldiers who have left me blood<br> That has not passed through any huxter's loin,<br> Pardon, and you that did not weigh the cost,<br> Old Butlers when you took to horse and stood<br> Beside the brackish waters of the Boyne<br> Till your bad master blenched and all was lost;<br> You merchant skipper that leaped overboard<br> After a ragged hat in Biscay Bay,<br> You most of all, silent and fierce old man<br> Because you were the spectacle that stirred<br> My fancy, and set my boyish lips to say<br> "Only the wasteful virtues earn the sun ";<br> Pardon that for a barren passion's sake,<br> Although I have come close on forty-nine<br> I have no child, I have nothing but a book,<br> Nothing but that to prove your blood and mine</i>.</p>
