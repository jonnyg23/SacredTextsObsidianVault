 <p>AND thus declared that Arab lady:<br> 'Last night, where under the wild moon<br> On grassy mattress I had laid me,<br> Within my arms great Solomon,<br> I suddenly cried out in a strange tongue<br> Not his, not mine."<br>                       And he that knew<br> All sounds by bird or angel sung<br> Answered: "A crested cockerel crew<br> Upon a blossoming apple bough<br> Three hundred years before the Fall,<br> And never crew again till now,<br> And would not now but that he thought,<br> Chance being at one with Choice at last,<br> All that the brigand apple brought<br> And this foul world were dead at last.<br> He that crowed out eternity<br> Thought to have crowed it in again.<br> A lover with a spider's eye<br> Will find out some appropriate pain,<br> Aye, though all passion's in the glance,<br> For every nerve: lover tests lover<br> With cruelties of Choice and Chance;<br> And when at last that murder's over <a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a><br> Maybe the bride-bed brings despair<br> For each an imagined image brings<br> And finds a real image there;<br> Yet the world ends when these two things,<br> Though several, are a single light,<br> When oil and wick are burned in one;<br> Therefore a blessed moon last night<br> Gave Sheba to her Solomon."</p>  
 <p>"Yet the world stays":<br>                             "If that be so,<br> Your cockerel found us in the wrong<br> Although he thought it worth a crow.<br> Maybe an image is too strong<br> Or maybe is not strong enough."</p>  
 <p>"The night has fallen; not a sound<br> In the forbidden sacred grove<br> Unless a petal hit the ground,<br> Nor any human sight within it<br> But the crushed grass where we have lain;<br> And the moon is wilder every minute.<br> Oh, Solomon! let us try again."</p>
