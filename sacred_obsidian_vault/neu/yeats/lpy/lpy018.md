 <p>WHEN my arms wrap you round I press<br> My heart upon the loveliness<br> That has long faded from the world;<br> The jewelled crowns that kings have hurled<br> In shadowy pools, when armies fled;<br> The love-tales wrought with silken thread<br> By dreaming ladies upon cloth<br> That has made fat the murderous moth;<br> The roses that of old time were<br> Woven by ladies in their hair,<br> The dew-cold lilies ladies bore<br> Through many a sacred corridor<br> Where such grey clouds of incense rose<br> That only the gods' eyes did not close:<br> For that pale breast and lingering hand<br> Come from a more dream-heavy land,<br> A more dream-heavy hour than this;<br> And when you sigh from kiss to kiss<br> I hear white Beauty sighing, too,<br> For hours when all must fade like dew,<br> But flame on flame, and deep on deep,<br> Throne over throne where in half sleep,<br> Their swords upon their iron knees,<br> Brood her high lonely mysteries.</p>
