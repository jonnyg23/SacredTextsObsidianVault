 <p><i>I WALKED among the seven woods of Coole,<br> Shan-walla, where a willow-bordered pond<br> Gathers the wild duck from the winter dawn;<br> Shady Kyle-dortha; sunnier Kyle-na-gno,<br> Where many hundred squirrels are as happy<br> As though they had been hidden by green boughs,<br> Where old age cannot find them; Pairc-na-lea,<br> Where hazel and ash and privet blind the paths;<br> Dim Pairc-na-carraig, where the wild bees fling<br> Their sudden fragrances on the green air;<br> Dim Pairc-na-tarav, where enchanted eyes<br> Have seen immortal, mild, proud shadows walk;<br> Dim Inchy wood, that hides badger and fox<br> And marten-cat, and borders that old wood<br> Wise Biddy Early called the wicked wood:<br> Seven odours, seven murmurs, seven woods.<br> I had not eyes like those enchanted eyes,<br> Yet dreamed that beings happier than men<br> Moved round me in the shadows, and at night<br> My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires;<br> And the images I have woven in this story<br> Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters<br> Moved round me in the voices and the fires,<br> And more I may not write of, for they that cleave<br> The waters of sleep can make a chattering tongue</i> <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a><br> <i>Heavy like stone, their wisdom being half silence.<br> How shall I name you, immortal, mild, proud shadows?<br> I only know that all we know comes from you,<br> And that you come from Eden on flying feet.<br> Is Eden far away, or do you hide<br> From human thought, as hares and mice and coneys<br> That run before the reaping-hook and lie<br> In the last ridge of the barley? Do our woods<br> And winds and ponds cover more quiet woods,<br> More shining winds, more star glimmering ponds?<br> Is Eden out of time and out of space?<br> And do you gather about us when pale light<br> Shining on water and fallen among leaves,<br> And winds blowing from flowers, and whirr of feathers<br> And the green quiet, have uplifted the heart?</i> </p>  
 <p><i>I have made this poem for you, that men may read it<br> Before they read of Forgael and Dectora,<br> As men in the old times, before the harps began,<br> Poured out wine for the high invisible ones</i>.</p>
