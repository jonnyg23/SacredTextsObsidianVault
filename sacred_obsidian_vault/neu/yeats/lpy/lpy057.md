 <p><i>EDAIN came out of Midher's hill, and lay<br> Beside young Aengus in his tower of glass,<br> Where time is drowned in odour-laden winds<br> And druid moons, and murmuring of boughs,<br> And sleepy boughs, and boughs where apples made<br> Of opal and ruby and pale chrysolite<br> Awake unsleeping fires; and wove seven strings,<br> Sweet with all music, out of his long hair,<br> Because her hands had been made wild by love.<br> When Midher's wife had changed her to a fly,<br> He made a harp with druid apple wood<br> That she among her winds might know he wept;<br> And from that hour he has watched over none<br> But faithful lovers</i>.</p>
