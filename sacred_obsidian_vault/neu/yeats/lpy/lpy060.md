 <p>IF any man drew near<br> When I was young,<br> I thought, "He holds her dear,"<br> And shook with hate and fear.<br> But oh, ’twas bitter wrong<br> If he could pass her by<br> With an indifferent eye.</p>  
 <p>Whereon I wrote and wrought,<br> And now, being grey,<br> I dream that I have brought<br> To such a pitch my thought<br> That coming time can say,<br> "He shadowed in a glass<br> What thing her body was."</p>  
 <p>For she had fiery blood<br> When I was young,<br> And trod so sweetly proud<br> As ’twere upon a cloud,<br> A woman Homer sung,<br> That life and letters seem<br> But an heroic dream.</p>
