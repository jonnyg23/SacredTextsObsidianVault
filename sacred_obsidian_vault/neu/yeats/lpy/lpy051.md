 <p>I HAVE no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde,<br> Nor Avalon the grass-green hollow, nor Joyous Isle,<br> Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid him for a while;<br> Nor Ulad, when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind;<br> Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart:<br> Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon's light and the sun's<br> Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long-lived ones,<br> Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the gates apart,<br> And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn,<br> To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier.<br> Therein are many queens like Branwen and Guinivere;<br> And Niamh and Laban and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn, <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a><br> And the wood-woman, whose lover was changed to a blue-eyed hawk;<br> And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore,<br> Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar,<br> I hear the harp-string praise them, or hear their mournful talk.</p>  
 <p>Because of something told under the famished horn<br> Of the hunter's moon, that hung between the night and the day,<br> To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay,<br> Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.</p>
