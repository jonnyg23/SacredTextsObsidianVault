 <p>MAY God be praised for woman<br> That gives up all her mind,<br> A man may find in no man<br> A friendship of her kind<br> That covers all he has brought<br> As with her flesh and bone,<br> Nor quarrels with a thought<br> Because it is not her own.</p>  
 <p>Though pedantry denies<br> It's plain the Bible means<br> That Solomon grew wise<br> While talking with his queens<br> Yet never could, although<br> They say he counted grass,<br> Count all the praises due<br> When Sheba was his lass,<br> When she the iron wrought, or<br> When from the smithy fire<br> It shuddered in the water<br> Harshness of their desire<br> That made them stretch and yawn,<br> Pleasure that comes with sleep,<br> Shudder that made them one. <a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a><br> What else He give or keep<br> God grant me--no not here,<br> For I am not so bold<br> To hope a thing so dear<br> Now I am growing old,<br> But when if the tale's true<br> The Pestle of the moon<br> That pounds up all anew<br> Brings me to birth again--<br> To find what once I had<br> And know what once I have known,<br> Until I am driven mad,<br> Sleep driven from my bed,<br> By tenderness and care,<br> Pity, an aching head,<br> Gnashing of teeth, despair;<br> And all because of some one<br> Perverse creature of chance,<br> And live like Solomon<br> That Sheba led a dance.</p>
