 <p>IF you have revisited the town, thin Shade,<br> Whether to look upon your monument<br> (I wonder if the builder has been paid)<br> Or happier thoughted when the day is spent<br> To drink of that salt breath out of the sea<br> When grey gulls flit about instead of men,<br> And the gaunt houses put on majesty:<br> Let these content you and be gone again;<br> For they are at their old tricks yet.<br>                                      A man<br> Of your own passionate serving kind who had brought<br> In his full hands what, had they only known,<br> Had given their children's children loftier thought,<br> Sweeter emotion, working in their veins<br> Like gentle blood, has been driven from the place,<br> And insult heaped upon him for his pains<br> And for his open-handedness, disgrace;<br> Your enemy, an old foul mouth, had set<br> The pack upon him.<br>                        Go, unquiet wanderer,<br> And gather the Glasnevin coverlet <a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a>E<br> About your head till the dust stops your ear,<br> The time for you to taste of that salt breath<br> And listen at the corners has not come;<br> You had enough of sorrow before death--<br> Away, away! You are safer in the tomb.</p>
