 <p>WHEN I play on my fiddle in Dooney,<br> Folk dance like a wave of the sea;<br> My cousin is priest in Kilvarnet,<br> My brother in Mocharabuiee.</p>  
 <p>I passed my brother and cousin:<br> They read in their books of prayer;<br> I read in my book of songs<br> I bought at the Sligo fair.</p>  
 <p>When we come at the end of time,<br> To Peter sitting in state,<br> He will smile on the three old spirits,<br> But call me first through the gate;</p>  
 <p>For the good are always the merry,<br> Save by an evil chance,<br> And the merry love the fiddle<br> And the merry love to dance:</p>  
 <p>And when the folk there spy me,<br> They will all come up to me,<br> With "Here is the fiddler of Dooney!"<br> And dance like a wave of the sea.</p>
