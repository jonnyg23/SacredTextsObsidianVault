 <p>DEAR fellow-artist, why so free<br> With every sort of company,<br> With every Jack and Jill?<br> Choose your companions from the best;<br> Who draws a bucket with the rest<br> Soon topples down the hill.</p>  
 <p>You may, that mirror for a school,<br> Be passionate, not bountiful<br> As common beauties may,<br> Who were not born to keep in trim<br> With old Ezekiel's cherubim<br> But those of Beaujolet.</p>  
 <p>I know what wages beauty gives,<br> How hard a life her servant lives,<br> Yet praise the winters gone:<br> There is not a fool can call me friend,<br> And I may dine at journey's end<br> With Landor and with Donne.</p>
