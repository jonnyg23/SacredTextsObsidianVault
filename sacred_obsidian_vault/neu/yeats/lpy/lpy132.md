 <p>SHE is foremost of those that I would hear praised.<br> I have gone about the house, gone up and down<br> As a man does who has published a new book<br> Or a young girl dressed out in her new gown,<br> And though I have turned the talk by hook or crook<br> Until her praise should be the uppermost theme,<br> A woman spoke of some new tale she had read,<br> A man confusedly in a half dream<br> As though some other name ran in his head.<br> She is foremost of those that I would hear praised.<br> I will talk no more of books or the long war<br> But walk by the dry thorn until I have found<br> Some beggar sheltering from the wind, and there<br> Manage the talk until her name come round. <a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a><br> If there be rags enough he will know her name<br> And be well pleased remembering it, for in the old days,<br> Though she had young men's praise and old men's blame,<br> Among the poor both old and young gave her praise.</p>
