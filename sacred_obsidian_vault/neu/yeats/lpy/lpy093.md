 <p>As I came over Windy Gap<br> They threw a halfpenny into my cap,<br> For I am running to Paradise;<br> And all that I need do is to wish<br> And somebody puts his hand in the dish<br> To throw me a bit of salted fish:<br> And there the king <i>is</i> but as the beggar.</p>  
 <p>My brother Mourteen is worn out<br> With skelping his big brawling lout,<br> And I am running to Paradise;<br> A poor life do what he can,<br> And though he keep a dog and a gun,<br> A serving maid and a serving man:<br> And there the king <i>is</i> but as the beggar.</p>  
 <p>Poor men have grown to be rich men,<br> And rich men grown to be poor again,<br> And I am running to Paradise;<br> And many a darling wit's grown dull<br> That tossed a bare heel when at school,<br> Now it has filled an old sock full:<br> And there the king <i>is</i> but as the beggar. <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>The wind is old and still at play<br> While I must hurry upon my way,<br> For I am running to Paradise;<br> Yet never have I lit on a friend<br> To take my fancy like the wind<br> That nobody can buy or bind:<br> And there the king <i>is</i> but as the beggar.</p>
