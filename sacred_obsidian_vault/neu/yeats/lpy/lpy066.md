 <p>O HEART, be at peace, because<br> Nor knave nor dolt can break<br> What's not for their applause,<br> Being for a woman's sake.<br> Enough if the work has seemed,<br> So did she your strength renew,<br> A dream that a lion had dreamed<br> Till the wilderness cried aloud,<br> A secret between you two,<br> Between the proud and the proud.</p>  
 <p>What, still you would have their praise!<br> But here's a haughtier text,<br> The labyrinth of her days<br> That her own strangeness perplexed;<br> And how what her dreaming gave<br> Earned slander, ingratitude,<br> From self-same dolt and knave;<br> Aye, and worse wrong than these.<br> Yet she, singing upon her road,<br> Half lion, half child, is at peace.</p>
