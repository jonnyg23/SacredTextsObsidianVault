 <p>THE fascination of what's difficult<br> Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent<br> Spontaneous joy and natural content<br> Out of my heart. There's something ails our colt<br> That must, as if it had not holy blood,<br> Nor on Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,<br> Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt<br> As though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays<br> That have to be set up in fifty ways,<br> On the day's war with every knave and dolt,<br> Theatre business, management of men.<br> I swear before the dawn comes round again<br> I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt.</p>
