 <p>"TIME to put off the world and go somewhere<br> And find my health again in the sea air,"<br> Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,<br> "And make my soul before my pate is bare."</p>  
 <p>"And get a comfortable wife and house<br> To rid me of the devil in my shoes,"<br> Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,<br> "And the worse devil that is between my thighs."</p>  
 <p>"And though I'd marry with a comely lass,<br> She need not be too comely--let it pass,"<br> Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,<br> "But there's a devil in a looking-glass."</p>
