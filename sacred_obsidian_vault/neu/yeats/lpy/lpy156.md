 <p>I HAVE met them at close of day<br> Coming with vivid faces<br> From counter or desk among grey<br> Eighteenth-century houses.<br> I have passed with a nod of the head<br> Or polite meaningless words,<br> Or have lingered awhile and said<br> Polite meaningless words,<br> And thought before I had done<br> Of a mocking tale or a gibe<br> To please a companion<br> Around the fire at the club,<br> Being certain that they and I<br> But lived where motley is worn:<br> All changed, changed utterly:<br> A terrible beauty is born.</p>  
 <p>That woman's days were spent<br> In ignorant good will,<br> Her nights in argument<br> Until her voice grew shrill.<br> What voice more sweet than hers<br> When young and beautiful,<br> She rode to harriers? <a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a><br> This man had kept a school<br> And rode our winged horse;<br> This other his helper and friend<br> Was coming into his force;<br> He might have won fame in the end,<br> So sensitive his nature seemed,<br> So daring and sweet his thought.<br> This other man I had dreamed<br> A drunken, vain-glorious lout.<br> He had done most bitter wrong<br> To some who are near my heart,<br> Yet I number him in the song;<br> He, too, has resigned his part<br> In the casual comedy;<br> He, too, has been changed in his turn,<br> Transformed utterly:<br> A terrible beauty is born.</p>  
 <p>Hearts with one purpose alone<br> Through summer and winter seem<br> Enchanted to a stone<br> To trouble the living stream.<br> The horse that comes from the road,<br> The rider, the birds that range<br> From cloud to tumbling cloud,<br> Minute by minute they change;<br> A shadow of cloud on the stream<br> Changes minute by minute;<br> A horse-hoof slides on the brim,<br> And a horse plashes within it<br> Where long-legged moor-hens dive, <a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 336</font></a><br> And hens to moor-cocks call.<br> Minute by minute they live:<br> The stone's in the midst of all.</p>  
 <p>Too long a sacrifice<br> Can make a stone of the heart.<br> O when may it suffice?<br> That is heaven's part, our part<br> To murmur name upon name,<br> As a mother names her child<br> When sleep at last has come<br> On limbs that had run wild.<br> What is it but nightfall?<br> No, no, not night but death;<br> Was it needless death after all?<br> For England may keep faith<br> For all that is done and said.<br> We-know their dream; enough<br> To know they dreamed and are dead;<br> And what if excess of love<br> Bewildered them till they died?<br> I write it out in a verse--<br> MacDonagh and MacBride<br> And Connolly and Pearse<br> Now and in time to be,<br> Wherever green is worn,<br> Are changed, changed utterly:<br> A terrible beauty is born.</p>
