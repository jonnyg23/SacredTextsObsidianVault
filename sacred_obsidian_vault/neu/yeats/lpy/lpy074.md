 <p align="center">(<i>Imitated from Ronsard</i>)</p>  
 <p>DEAR Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case.<br> When we are high and airy hundreds say<br> That if we hold that flight they'll leave the place,<br> While those same hundreds mock another day<br> Because we have made our art of common things,<br> So bitterly, you'd dream they longed to look<br> All their lives through into some drift of wings.<br> You've dandled them and fed them from the book<br> And know them to the bone; impart to us<br> We'll keep the secret--a new trick to please.<br> Is there a bridle for this Proteus<br> That turns and changes like his draughty seas?<br> Or is there none, most popular of men,<br> But when they mock us that we mock again?</p>
