 <p>I THOUGHT no more was needed<br> Youth to prolong<br> Than dumb-bell and foil<br> To keep the body young.<br> Oh, who could have foretold<br> That the heart grows old?</p>  
 <p>Though I have many words,<br> What woman's satisfied,<br> I am no longer faint<br> Because at her side?<br> Oh, who could have foretold<br> That the heart grows old?</p>  
 <p>I have not lost desire<br> But the heart that I had;<br> I thought ’twould burn my body<br> Laid on the death-bed,<br> For who could have foretold<br> That the heart grows old?</p>
