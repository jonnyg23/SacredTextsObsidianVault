 <p>WHAT need you, being come to sense,<br> But fumble in a greasy till<br> And add the halfpence to the pence<br> And prayer to shivering prayer, until<br> You have dried the marrow from the bone;<br> For men were born to pray and save:<br> Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,<br> It's with O'Leary in the grave.</p>  
 <p>Yet they were of a different kind<br> The names that stilled your childish play,<br> They have gone about the world like wind,<br> But little time had they to pray<br> For whom the hangman's rope was spun,<br> And what, God help us, could they save:<br> Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,<br> It's with O'Leary in the grave.</p>  
 <p>Was it for this the wild geese spread<br> The grey wing upon every tide;<br> For this that all that blood was shed,<br> For this Edward Fitzgerald died,<br> And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,<br> All that delirium of the brave; <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a><br> Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,<br> It's with O'Leary in the grave.</p>  
 <p>Yet could we turn the years again,<br> And call those exiles as they were<br> In all their loneliness and pain,<br> You'd cry "Some woman's yellow hair<br> Has maddened every mother's son":<br> They weighed so lightly what they gave,<br> But let them be, they're dead and gone,<br> They're with O'Leary in the grave.</p>
