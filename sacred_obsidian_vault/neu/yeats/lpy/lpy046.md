 <p>NEVER give all the heart, for love<br> Will hardly seem worth thinking of<br> To passionate women if it seem<br> Certain, and they never dream<br> That it fades out from kiss to kiss;<br> For everything that's lovely is<br> But a brief dreamy kind delight.<br> O never give the heart outright,<br> For they, for all smooth lips can say,<br> Have given their hearts up to the play.<br> And who could play it well enough<br> If deaf and dumb and blind with love?<br> He that made this knows all the cost,<br> For he gave all his heart and lost.</p>
