 <p>Then Loch Mac Emonis was asked like the others, and there was promised to him a piece of the arable land of Mag Ai equal in size to Mag Murthemne, and the equipment of twelve warriors and a chariot worth seven cumals <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and he did not think combat with a youth worthy. He had a brother, Long Mac Emonis himself. The same price was given to him, both maiden and raiment and chariots and land. He goes to meet Cuchulainn. Cuchulainn slays him, and he was brought dead before his brother, Loch.</p>  
 <p>This latter said that if he only knew that it was a bearded man who slew him, he would kill him for it.</p>  
 <p>'Take a battle-force to him,' said Medb to her household, 'across the ford from the west, that you may go across; and let fair-play be broken on him.'</p>  
 <p>Then the seven Manes, warriors, go first, so that they saw him on the edge of the ford westward. He</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></a></p>  
 <p>puts his feast-dress on that day. It is then that the women kept climbing on the men to look at him.</p>  
 <p>'I am sorry,' said Medb; 'I cannot see the boy about whom they go there.'</p>  
 <p>'Your mind will not be the gladder for it,' said Lethrend, Ailill's squire, 'if you could see him.' He comes to the ford then as he was.</p>  
 <p>'What man is it yonder, O Fergus?' said Medb.</p>  
 <p>'A boy who wards off,' etc.… 'if it is Culann's Hound.' <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Medb climbed on the men then to look at him.</p>  
 <p>It is then that the women said to Cuchulainn 'that he was laughed at in the camp because he had no beard, and no good warriors would go against him, only wild men; it were easier to make a false beard.' So this is what he did, in order to seek combat with a man; <i>i.e.</i> with Loch. Cuchulainn took a handful of grass, and said a spell over it, so that every one thought he had a beard.</p>  
 <p>'True,' said the troop of women, 'Cuchulainn has a beard. It is fitting for a warrior to fight with him.' They had done this on urging Loch.</p>  
 <p>'I will not make combat against him till the end of seven days from to-day,' said Loch.</p>  
 <p>'It is not fitting for us to have no attack on the man for this space,' said Medb. 'Let us put a hero to hunt(?) him every night, if perchance we may get a chance at him.'</p>  
 <p>This is done then. A hero used to come every night to hunt him, and he used to kill them all. These are the names of the men who fell there: seven Conalls, seven Oenguses, seven Uarguses, seven Celtris, eight</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Fiacs, ten Ailills, ten Delbaths, ten Tasachs. These are his deeds of this week in Ath Grencha.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>Medb asked advice, to know what she should do to Cuchulainn, for what had been killed of their hosts by him distressed her greatly. This is the plan she arrived at, to put brave, high-spirited men to attack him all at once when he should come to an appointed meeting to speak with Medb. For she had an appointment the next day with Cuchulainn to make a peace in fraud with him, to get hold of him. She sent messengers forth to seek him that he should come to meet her; and it was thus he should come, and he unarmed: 'for she would come only with her troop of women to meet him.'</p>  
 <p>The messenger, Traigtren, went to the place where Cuchulainn was, and tells him Medb's message. Cuchulainn promised that he would do so.</p>  
 <p>'In what manner does it please you to go to meet Medb to-morrow, O Cuchulainn?' said Loeg.</p>  
 <p>'As Medb has asked me,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>'Great are Medb's deeds,' said the charioteer; 'I fear a hand behind the back with her.'</p>  
 <p>'How is it to be done then?' said he.</p>  
 <p>'Your sword at your waist,' said the charioteer, 'that you may not be taken at an unfair advantage. For the warrior is not entitled to his honour-price if he is without arms; and it is the coward's law that he deserves in that way.'</p>  
 <p>'Let it be done so then,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>The meeting-place was in Ard Aignech, which is called Fochaird to-day. Now Medb came to the meeting-place and set in ambush fourteen men of her own</p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>special following, of those who were of most prowess, ready for him. These are they: two Glassines, the two sons of Bucchridi; two Ardans, the two sons of Licce; two Glasogmas, the two sons of Crund; Drucht and Delt and Dathen; Tea and Tascra and Tualang; Taur and Giese.</p>  
 <p>Then Cuchulainn comes to meet her. The men rise to attack him. Fourteen spears are thrown at him at once. Cuchulainn guards himself so that his skin or his ———(?) is not touched. Then he turns on them and kills them, the fourteen of them. So that they are the fourteen men of Focherd, and they are the men of Cronech, for it is in Cronech at Focherd that they were killed. Hence Cuchulainn said: 'Good is my feat of heroism,' <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a> etc.</p>  
 <p>So it is from this that the name Focherd stuck to the place; that is, <i>focherd</i>, <i>i.e.</i> 'good is the feat of arms' that happened to Cuchulainn there.</p>  
 <p>So Cuchulainn came, and overtook them taking camp, and there were slain two Daigris and two Anlis and four Dungais of Imlech. Then Medb began to urge Loch there.</p>  
 <p>'Great is the mockery of you,' said she, 'for the man who has killed your brother to be destroying our host, and you do not go to battle with him! For we deem it certain that the wild man, great and fierce, <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">2</font></a> the like of him yonder, will not be able to withstand the rage and fury of a hero like you. For it is by one foster-mother and instructress that an art was built up for you both.'</p>  
 <p>Then Loch came against Cuchulainn, to avenge</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>his brother on him, for it was shown to him that Cuchulainn had a beard.</p>  
 <p>'Come to the upper ford,' said Loch; 'it would not be in the polluted ford that we shall meet, where Long fell.'</p>  
 <p>When he came then to seek the ford, the men drove the cattle across.</p>  
 <p>'It will be across your water <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">1</font></a> here to-day,' said Gabran the poet. Hence is Ath Darteisc, and Tir Mor Darteisc from that time on this place.</p>  
 <p>When the men met then on the ford, and when they began to fight and to strike each other there, and when each of them began to strike the other, the eel threw three folds round Cuchulainn's feet, till he lay on his back athwart the ford. Loch attacked him with the sword, till the ford was blood-red with his blood.</p>  
 <p>'Ill indeed,' said Fergus, 'is this deed before the enemy. Let each of you taunt the man, O men,' said he to his following, 'that he may not fall for nothing.'</p>  
 <p>Bricriu Poison-tongue Mac Carbatha rose and began inciting Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>'Your strength is gone,' said he, 'when it is a little salmon that overthrows you when the Ulstermen are at hand [coming] to you out of their sickness yonder. Grievous for you to undertake a hero's deed in the presence of the men of Ireland and to ward off a formidable warrior in arms thus!'</p>  
 <p>Therewith Cuchulainn arises and strikes the eel so that its ribs broke in it, and the cattle were driven over the hosts eastwards by force, so that they took the tents on their horns, with the thunder-feat that the two heroes had made in the ford.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>The she-wolf attacked him, and drove the cattle on him westwards. He throws a stone from his sling, so that her eye broke in her head. She goes in the form of a hornless red heifer; she rushes before the cows upon the pools and fords. It is then he said: I cannot see the fords for water.' He throws a stone at the hornless red heifer, so that her leg breaks under her. Then he sang a song:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>'I am all alone before flocks;<br>  I get them not, I let them not go;<br>  I am alone at cold hours (?)<br>  Before many peoples.  
 </small><p>'Let some one say to Conchobar<br>  Though he should come to me it were not too soon;<br>  Magu's sons have carried off their kine<br>  And divided them among them.</p>  
 <p>'There may be strife about one head<br>  Only that one tree blazes not;<br>  If there were two or three<br>  Their brands would blaze. <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>'The men have almost worn me out<br>  By reason of the number of single combats;<br>  I cannot work the slaughter (?) of glorious warriors<br>  As I am all alone.<br>               I am all alone. <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">1</font></a></p></div>  
 <p>It is there then that Cuchulainn did to the Morrigan the three things that he had promised her in the <i>Tain Bo Regamna</i>; <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">2</font></a> and he fights Loch in the ford with the <i>gae-bolga</i>, which the charioteer threw him along the stream. He attacked him with it, so that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>it went into his body's armour, for Loch had a horn-skin in fighting with a man.</p>  
 <p>'Give way to me,' said Loch. Cuchulainn gave way, so that it was on the other side that Loch fell. Hence is Ath Traiged in Tir Mor. Cuchulainn cut off his head then.</p>  
 <p>Then fair-play was broken with him that day when five men came against him at one time; <i>i.e.</i> two Cruaids, two Calads, Derothor; Cuchulainn killed them by himself. Hence is Coicsius Focherda, and Coicer Oengoirt; or it is fifteen days that Cuchulainn was in Focherd, and hence is Coicsius Focherda in the Foray.</p>  
 <p>Cuchulainn hurled at them from Delga, so that not a living thing, man or beast, could put its head past him southwards between Delga and the sea.</p>
