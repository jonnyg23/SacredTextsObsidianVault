 <p>'Go to the camp for us, O friend Loeg' [said Cuchulainn], 'and consult Lugaid Mac Nois, descendant of Lomarc, to know who is coming against me tomorrow. Let it be asked diligently, and give him my greeting.'</p>  
 <p>Then Loeg went.</p>  
 <p>'Welcome,' said Lugaid; 'it is unlucky for Cuchulainn, the trouble in which he is, alone against the men of Ireland. It is a comrade of us both, Ferbaeth (ill-luck to his arms!), who goes against him to-morrow. Findabair is given to him for it, and the kingdom of his race.'</p>  
 <p>Loeg turns back to where Cuchulainn is.</p>  
 <p>'He is not very joyful over his answer, my friend Loeg,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>Loeg tells him all that. Ferbaeth had been summoned into the tent to Ailill and Medb, and he is told to sit by Findabair, and that she should be given to him, for he was her choice for fighting with Cuchulainn. He was the man they thought worthy of them, for they had both learned the same arts with Scathach. Then wine is given to him, till he was intoxicated, and he is told, 'They thought that wine fine, and there had only been brought the load of fifty wagons. And it was the maiden who used to put hand to his portion therefrom.'</p>  
 <p>'I do not wish it,' said Ferbaeth; 'Cuchulainn is my foster-brother, and a man of perpetual covenant with</p>  
 <p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></a></p>  
 <p>me. Nevertheless I will go against him to-morrow and cut off his head.'</p>  
 <p>'It will be you who would do it,' said Medb.</p>  
 <p>Cuchulainn told Loeg to go to meet Lugaid, that he should come and speak with him. Lugaid comes to him.</p>  
 <p>'So Ferbaeth is coming against me to-morrow,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>'He indeed,' said Lugaid.</p>  
 <p>'An evil day!' said Cuchulainn; 'I shall not be alive therefrom. Two of equal age we, two of equal deftness, two equal when we meet. O Lugaid, greet him for me; tell him that it is not true valour to come against me; tell him to come to meet me to-night, to speak with me.'</p>  
 <p>Lugaid tells him this. When Ferbaeth did not avoid it, he went that night to renounce his friendship with Cuchulainn, and Fiacha Mac Fir-Febe with him. Cuchulainn appealed to him by his foster-brotherhood, and Scathach, the foster-mother of them both.</p>  
 <p>'I must,' said Ferbaeth. 'I have promised it.'</p>  
 <p>'Take back (?) your bond of friendship then,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>Cuchulainn went from him in anger. A spear of holly was driven into Cuchulainn's foot in the glen, and appeared up by his knee. He draws it out.</p>  
 <p>'Go not, O Ferbaeth, till you have seen the find that I have found.'</p>  
 <p>'Throw it,' said Ferbaeth.</p>  
 <p>Cuchulainn threw the spear then after Ferbaeth so that it hit the hollow of his poll, and came out at his mouth in front, so that he fell back into the glen.</p>  
 <p>'That is a throw indeed,' said Ferbaeth. Hence is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Focherd Murthemne. (Or it is Fiacha who had said, 'Your throw is vigorous to-day, O Cuchulainn; said he; so that Focherd Murthemne is from that.)</p>  
 <p>Ferbaeth died at once in the glen. Hence is Glenn Firbaith. Something was heard: Fergus, who said:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>'O Ferbaeth, foolish is thy expedition<br>  In the place in which thy grave is.<br>  Ruin reached thee …<br>  In Croen Corand.  
 </small><p>'The hill is named Fithi (?) for ever;<br>  Croenech in Murthemne,<br>  From to-day Focherd will be the name<br>  Of the place in which thou didst fall, O Ferbaeth.<br>  O Ferbaeth,' etc.</p></div>  
 <p>'Your comrade has fallen,' said Fergus. 'Say will you pay for this man on the morrow?'</p>  
 <p>'I will pay indeed,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>Cuchulainn sends Loeg again for news, to know how they are in the camp, and whether Ferbaeth lived. Lugaid said: 'Ferbaeth is dead,' and Cuchulainn comes in turn to talk with them.</p>
