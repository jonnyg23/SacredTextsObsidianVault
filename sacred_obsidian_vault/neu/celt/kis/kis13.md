 <p>The Cloud-woman, Mor, was the daughter <br>
 Of Griann, the Sun,--well, and she<br>
 Made a marriage to equal that grandeur,<br>
 For her Goodman was Lir, the Sea.</p>
 <p>The Cloud-woman Mor, she had seven<br>
 Strong sons, and the story-books say<br>
 Their inches grew in the night-time,<br>
 And grew over again in the day.</p>
 <p>The Cloud-woman Mor,--as they grew in<br>
 Their bone, she grew in her pride,<br>
 Till her haughtiness turned away, men say,<br>
 Her goodman Lir from her side;</p>
 <p>Then she lived in Mor's Home and she watched<br>
 With pride her sons and her crop,<br>
 Till one day the wish in her grew<br>
 To view from the mountain-top<br>
 All, all that she owned, so she<br>
 Traveled without any stop.</p>
 <p>And what did she see? A thousand<br>
 Fields and her own fields small, small!<br>
 "What a fine and wide place is Eirinn," said she,<br>
 "I am Mor, but not great after all."</p>
 <p>Then a herdsman came, and he told her<br>
 That her sons had stolen away:<br>
 They had left the calves in the hollow,<br>
 With the goose-flock they would not stay:</p>
 <p>They had seen three ships on the sea<br>
 And nothing would do them but go:<br>
 Mor wept and wept when she heard it,<br>
 And her tears made runnels below.</p>
 <p>Then her shining splendor departed:<br>
 She went, and she left no trace,<br>
 And the Cloud-woman, Mor, was never<br>
 Beheld again in that place.</p>
 <p>The proud woman, Mor, who was daughter<br>
 Of Griann, the Sun, and who made<br>
 A marriage to equal that grandeur,<br>
 Passed away as a shade.</p></dir>
