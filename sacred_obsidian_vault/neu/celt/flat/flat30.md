 <center><h1>The Lord of Dunkerron</h1></center>
   <p>
 THE lord of Dunkerron - O'Sullivan More,<br>
 
   Why seeks he at midnight the sea-beaten shore?<br>
 
   His bark lies in haven, his bounds are asleep;<br>
 
   No foes are abroad on the land or the deep.</p>
 
   <p>
 Yet nightly the lord of Dunkerron is known<br>
 
   On the wild shore to watch and to wander alone;<br>
 
   For a beautiful spirit of ocean, 't is said,<br>
 
   The lord of Dunkerron would win to his bed.</p>
 
   <p>
 When, by moonlight, the waters were hush'd to repose,<br>
 
   That beautiful spirit of ocean arose;<br>
 
   Her hair, full of lustre, just floated and fell<br>
 
   O'er her bosom, that heav'd with a billowy swell.</p>
 
   <p>
 Long, long had he lov'd her- long vainly essay'd<br>
 
   To lure from her dwelling the coy ocean maid;<br>
 
   And long had he wander'd and watch'd by the tide,<br>
 
   To claim the fair spirit O'Sullivan's bride !</p>
 
   <p>
 The maiden she gazed on the creature of earth,<br>
 
   Whose voice in her breast to a feeling gave birth;<br>
 
   Then smiled; and, abashed as a maiden might be,<br>
 
   Looking down, gently sank to her home in the sea.</p>
 
   <p>
 Though gentle that smile, as the moonlight above,<br>
 
   O'Sullivan felt 't was the dawning of love,<br>
 
   And hope came on hope, spreading over his mind,<br>
 
   Like the eddy of circles her wake left behind.</p>
 
   <p>
 The lord of Dunkerron he plunged in the waves,<br>
 
   And sought through the fierce rush of waters, their caves;<br>
 
   The gloom of whose depth studded over with spars,<br>
 
   Had the glitter of midnight when lit up by stars.</p>
 
   <p>
 Who can tell or can fancy the treasures that sleep<br>
 
   Intombed in the wonderful womb of the deep?<br>
 
   The pearls and the gems, as if valueless, thrown<br>
 
   To lie 'mid the sea-wrack concealed and unknown.</p>
 
   <p>
 Down, down went the maid, - still the chieftain pursued;<br>
 
   Who flies must be followed ere she can be wooed.<br>
 
   Untempted by treasures, unawed by alarms,<br>
 
   The maiden at length he has clasped in his arms !</p>
 
   <p>
 They rose from the deep by a smooth-spreading strand,<br>
 
   Whence beauty and verdure stretch'd over the land.<br>
 
   "T was an isle of enchantment ! and lightly the breeze,<br>
 
   With a musical murmur, just crept through the trees.</p>
 
   <p>
 The haze-woven shroud of that newly born isle,<br>
 
   Softly faded away, from a magical pile,<br>
 
   A palace of crystal, whose bright-beaming sheen<br>
 
   Had the tints of the rainbow - red, yellow, and green.</p>
 
   <p>
 And grottoes, fantastic in hue and in form,<br>
 
   Were there, as flung up - the wild sport of the storm;<br>
 
   Yet all was so cloudless, so lovely, and calm,<br>
 
   It seemed but a region of sunshine and balm.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Here, here shall we dwell in a dream of delight,<br>
 
   Where the glories of earth and of ocean unite !<br>
 
   Yet, loved son of earth ! I must from thee away;<br>
 
   There are laws which e'en spirits are bound to obey!</p>
 
   <p>
 " Once more must I visit the chief of my race,<br>
 
   His sanction to gain ere I meet thy embrace.<br>
 
   In a moment I dive to the chambers beneath:<br>
 
   One cause can detain me - one only - 't is death!"</p>
 
   <p>
 They parted in sorrow, with vows true and fond;<br>
 
   The language of promise had nothing beyond.<br>
 
   His soul all on fire, with anxiety burns:<br>
 
   The moment is gone - but no maiden returns.</p>
 
   <p>
 What sounds from the deep meet his terrified ear -<br>
 
   What accents of rage and of grief does he hear?<br>
 
   What sees he? what change has come over the flood -<br>
 
   What tinges its green with a jetty of blood?</p>
 
   <p>
 Can he doubt what the gush of warm blood would explain?<br>
 
   That she sought the consent of her monarch in vain !<br>
 
   For see all around him, in white foam and froth<i>,<br>
 
   </i>The waves of the ocean boil up in their wroth !</p>
 
   <p>
 The palace of crystal has melted in air,<br>
 
   And the dies of the rainbow no longer are there;<br>
 
   The grottoes with vapour and clouds are o'ercast,<br>
 
   The sunshine is darkness - the vision has past !</p>
 
   <p>
 Loud, loud was the call of his serfs for their chief;<br>
 
   They sought him with accents of wailing and grief:<br>
 
   He heard, and he struggled - a wave to the shore,<br>
 
   Exhausted and faint. bears O'Sullivan More !</p>
