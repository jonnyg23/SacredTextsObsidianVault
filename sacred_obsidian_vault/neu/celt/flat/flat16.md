 <center><h1>The Little Shoe</h1></center>
   <p>
 " Now tell me, Molly," said Mr. Coote to Molly
   Cogan, as he met her on the road one day, close to one of the old gateways of
   Kilmallock, ["Kilmallock seemed to me like the court of the Queen of
   Silence." - <i>OKeeffe's Recollections</i>] did you ever bear of the
   Cluricaune?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Is it the CIuricaune? why, then, sure I did, often and
   often; many's the time I heard my father, rest his soul! tell about 'em."</p>
 
   <p>
 "But did you ever see one, Molly, yourself?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Och ! no, I never <i>see
   </i>one in my life ; but my grandfather, that's my
   father's father, you know, he <i>see </i>one, one time, and caught him
   too."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Caught him! Oh ! Molly, tell me how?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Why, then, I'll tell you. My grandfather, you see, was
   out there above in the bog, drawing home turf, and the poor old mare was tired
   after her day's work, and the old man went out to the stable to look after
   her, and to see if she was eating her hay; and when he came to the stab]e door
   there, my dear, he heard something hammering, hammering, hammering, just for
   all the would like a shoemaker making a shoe, and whistling all the time the
   prettiest tune he ever heard in his whole life before. Well, my grandfather,
   he thought it was the Cluricaune, and he said to himself, says he, 'I'll catch
   you, if I can, and then I 'll have money enough always.' So he opened the door
   very quietly, and didn't make a bit of noise in the world that ever was heard;
   and looked all about, but the never a bit of the little man he could see any
   where, but he heard him hammering and whistling, and so be looked and looked,
   till at last he <i>see </i>the little. fellow; and where was he, do you think,
   but in the girth under the mare; and there he was with his little bit of an
   apron on him, and hammer in his hand, and a little red nightcap on his head,
   and he making a shoe; and he was so busy with his work, and he was hammering
   and whistling so loud, that he never minded my grandfather till he caught him
   fast in his hand. ' Faith, I have you now,' says he, ' and I'll never let you
   go till I get your purse - that's what I won't; so give it here to me at once,
   now.' -' Stop, stop,' says the Cluricaune, ' stop, stop,' says he, ' till I
   get it for you.' So my grandfather, like a fool, you see, opened his hand a
   little, and the little fellow jumped away laughing, and he never saw him any
   more, and the never the bit of the purse did he get, only the Cluricaune left
   his little shoe that he was making; and my grandfather was mad enough angry
   with himself for letting him go, but he had the shoe all his life, and my own
   mother told me she often <i>see </i>it, and had it in her hand, and 'twas the
   prettiest little shoe she ever saw.</p>
 
   <p>
 "And did you see it yourself, Molly ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 Oh ! no, my dear, it was lost long afore I was born: but my
   mother told me about it often and often enough."</p>
