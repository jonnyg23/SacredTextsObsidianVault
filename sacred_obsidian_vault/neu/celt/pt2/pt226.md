 <h3 align="CENTER">THE ORIGIN OF LOCH NESS.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">From Mr. Thomas MacDonald, now gamekeeper at Dunrobin.</p>
 <p>WHERE Loch Ness now is, there was long ago a fine glen. A woman went one day to the well to fetch water, and she found the spring flowing so fast that she got frightened, and left her pitcher and ran for her life; she never stopped till she got to the top of a high hill; and when there, she turned about and saw the glen filled with water. Not a house or a field was to be seen! "Aha!" said she, "Tha Loch ann a nis." (Ha Loch an a neesh). There is a lake in it now; and so the lake was called Loch Ness (neesh).</p>
