 I HAVE scarcely anything to add to the
   general account of the collection of Celtic Fairy Tales which I gave in the
   predecessor to this volume. Since the appearance of that volume in 1891, the
   publication of such tales has gone on apace. Mr. Curtin has published in the
   New York <i>Sun </i>no less than fifty more Irish fairy tales, one of which he
   has been good enough to place at my disposal for the present volume. Mr.
   Larminie has published with Mr. E. Stock a volume of <i>West Irish Fairy
   Tales, </i>of which I have also the privilege of presenting a specimen. A
   slight volume of Welsh Fairy Tales, published by Mr. Nutt, and a few fairy
   anecdotes contained in the Prize Essay on Welsh Folk-lore by the Rev. Mr.
   Evans, sum up Cambria's contribution to our subject during the past three
   years. The fifth volume of the <i>Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition, </i>just
   about to appear at the moment of writing, is the sole addition to Celtic Fairy
   Tales from the country of J. F. Campbell. Taken altogether, something like a
   hundred previously unpublished tales from Celtdom have been rendered
   accessible to the world since I last wrote, a by no means insignificant
   outcome in three years. It is at any rate clear, that the only considerable
   addition to our folk-lore knowledge in these isles must come from the Gaelic
   area. The time of harvest can be but short ; may the workers be many, willing,
   and capable.</p>

 XXVII. THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN OF LIR.</p>
 
   
   <p>
 <i>Sources</i>.- Abridged from the text and
   translation published by the Society for the Preservation of the Irish
   Language in 1883. This merely follows the text and version given by Professor
   O'Curry in <i>Atlantis, </i>iv. He used three Dublin MSS., none of them,
   however, of earlier date than the eighteenth century. Dr. Joyce gives a free
   paraphrase in his <i>Old Celtic Romances.</i></p>

   list of incidents at the end of my paper on the Science of Folk.tales" in

   Cox in <i>Folk-lore Journal </i>vii. app. 37 also the same list <i>sub voce </i>"Swan
   Maiden Transformation." In modern Irish literature Griffin has included
   the tale in his <i>Tales of the Jury-room', </i>and Tom Moore's "Song of
   Fiounala" beginning "Silent, O Moyle"is founded upon it.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks.-The " Fate
   of the Children of Lir" is always referred to along with "The Story
   of Deirdre <i>" (cf </i>the <i>Celtic Fairy Tales, </i>ix.), and the
   "Children of Tuireann" as one of the Three Sorrowful Tales of Erin.
   But there is no evidence of equal antiquity to the other two stories, of which
   one is as old as the eleventh century. From the interspersed verse O'Curry
   concluded, however, that the story was at least of considerable antiquity, and
   the references to the unknown Saint Mochaomhog confirm his impression. The
   Hill of the White Field is near Newton Hannton, in the county of Armagh. The
   Lake of the Red Eye is Lough Derg, in the Shannon above Killaloe.</p>
 
   <p>
 Fingula is Fair Shoulder. The tradition
   that swans are inviolable is still extant in Ireland. A man named Connor
   Griffin killed eleven swans: he had previously been a prosperous man, and
   shortly after. wards his son was drowned in the Shannon, his goods were lost,
   and his wife died <i>(Children of Lir, </i>Dublin edit., note, p. 87). In
   County Mayo it is believed that the souls of pure virgins are after death
   enshrined in the forms of swans ; if anybody injures them, it is thought he
   will die within a year (Walter's <i>Natural History of the Birds of Ireland, </i>pp.94-5).
   Mr. Gomme concludes from this that the swan was at one time a British totem <i>(Arch.
   Rev., </i>iii. 226-7).</p>
 
   <p>
 At first sight the tale seems little more
   than an argument against the Bill for Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister,
   but the plaintive lays of Fingula, the touching detail of the swans flying
   over the desolate hill and White Field, give a touch of Celtic glamour to the
   whole story. There is probably also a deep religious significance implied in
   the fact that the wicked Aunt Stepmother's spell is broken when the
   transformed Children of Lir come across the first Christian they meet.</p>
 
   <p>
 Mr. Nutt has kindly communicated the
   following remarks on this tale:-</p>
 
   <p>
 The Fate of the Children of Lir belongs
   formally to the so-called mythological cycle, the personages of which are the
   Tuatha de Danann. The Irish annalists of the 10th-11th
   centuries described these as members of one of the races which possessed
   Ireland in pre-Christian times before the coming of the Milesians. But even in
   the most strongly euhemerised accounts the mythic nature of these beings is
   apparent, and most modern scholars are agreed that they are in fact the
   members of a Pagan Irish Pantheon. They live on to this very day in Irish
   folk-belief as chiefs and rulers of the fairies.</p>
 
   <p>
 The MS. evidence for some of the stories
   concerning the Tuatha de Danann is as old as that for the oldest heroic cycle
   (the Ultonian of Conchobar and Cuchulainn). But the Tuatha de Danann legends
   have retained throughout Irish literature greater plasticity and vitality than
   those of the Ultonian cycle, and many stories are not older in their present
   state than the 14th and 15th centuries. This is probably the case with the
   present story. The oldest known MS. only goes back to 1718, but this and the
   MS. of 1721, used by O'Curry for hs edition, are certainly copied from much
   older MSS.</p>
 
   <p>
 The interesting question for storiologists
   is whether the themes of the story - the swan-metamorphosis consequent upon
   the step-mother's jealousy, and the protecting role assigned to the sister-are
   of old native or of recent imported nature. In support of the first
   hypothesis, it may be noted that the theme of stepmotherly jealousy was
   current in Ireland in the 10th century at the latest, as it is woven into the
   saga of the Destruction of Daderga's Fort (see my article <i>"Folk-lore,"
   </i>ii.). The final episode of the sudden aging of the miraculously long-lived
   swans is also genuinely Irish, but its true significance is obscured in our
   story in a way that sufficiently demonstrates the late and secondary character
   of the text. The idea is that the dwellers in Faery, whether fairy-folk or
   mortals penetrating thither, enjoy perpetual life, forfeited by the latter the
   moment they return to this earth. As children of the Tuatha de Danann,
   Fionngula and her brothers are deathless, and the episode as it stands in our
   text results from a contamination of the original form of the story in which
   the swan-metamorphosis was annulled under certain conditions (the removal of
   the chains), when the original shape was resumed, and the familiar story of
   the mortal returning from Faery after hundreds of years, which he deems to be
   but a short space of time, shrinking into dust the moment he touches earth.</p>
 
   <p>
 There is a well-known Continental folk-taIe
   - the "Seven Swans" (or Ravens) of which<i> </i>we possess several
   medieval (12th to 13th century) versions, all connected with the romance of
   the "Swan Knight." M. Gaston Paris has studied the whole story group
   <i>(Romania, </i>xix. 314, &amp;c.) with the following results The folk-tale
   of the seven swans had originally nothing to do with the saga of the
   swan-knight. The connection apparent in the 12th century texts is artificial ;
   the swans owe their shape-shifting capacity to the superhuman nature of their
   mother ; this trait has been almost effaced even in the oldest versions. The
   distinguishing mark of the swans in all the versions is the possession of
   silver or gold chains, which are what may be called metamorphosis tokens ; it
   follows from this that the contamination of the two story-types ("Seven
   Swans" and "Swan Knight") must be older than the oldest version
   of the first story, as these chains can only be derived from the one with
   which in the Swan Knight saga the swan draws the knight back.</p>
 
   <p>
 In <i>Romania </i>(xxi. 62, <i>seq.</i>)<i>
   </i>M. Ferd. Lot examines the question in the light of our tale. He points out
   that it indicates clearly the super human nature of the mother, and that as
   the silver chains figure in the story, they cannot be due in the Continental
   versions to contamination with the Swan Knight saga, as M. Gaston Paris
   imagines. M. Lot evidently inclines to look upon them as talismans, the
   abandonment of which was the original cause of the metamorphosis, and the
   handling of which at the end brings about the change back to human shape. He
   points out that these chains form an essential part of the gear of beings
   appearing in bird guise (especially if they belong to Faery); thus in the
   10th-century 'Sickbed of Cuchulaion' the goddesses Fand and Liban appear as
   two swans united by a golden chain; in the 8th to 9th century Conception of
   Cuchulainn, Dechtire, the mother of the hero by the god Lug, appears with her
   companions in the guise of many-hued birds linked together by chains of silver
   (or red gold in one version). The MS. evidence for these tales reaches back to
   the early 11th century.</p>
 
   <p>
 Curiously enough, M. Lot has not cited the
   closest parallel to our tale from old Irish literature, and one which is
   certainly connected with it in some measure, the fine story called the
   "Dream of Angus." A story of this title is cited in the epic catalogue of
   the Book of Leinster (which dates back to the early I ith century) as one of
   the introductory stories to the Tam bo Cuailgne. This assumed its present
   shape substantially between 650 and 750. The introductory stories had
   originally no connection with it, and were invented or re-shaped in the 8th to
   10th centuries, after the Tam had taken undisputed place as the leading Irish
   epic. The tale may therefore be ascribed provisionally to the 9th century, if
   we can only be sure that the existing version, preserved in a single MS. of
   the 15th century, is a faithful copy of the original. There need be no doubt
   as to this. The text is due to a Christian scribe, and, like nearly alt
   portions of the mythological cycle, betrays signs of Christian influence,
   though not of Christian remodelling. Such influence is, however, far more
   likely to have exerted itself in the first stage of the written existence of
   these tales, when the memory of organised paganism was still tenacious, than
   later, when the tales had become subject-matter for the play of free poetic
   fancy. The story, printed and translated by Dr. E. Muller, <i>Rev</i>. <i>Celt.
   </i>iv. 342, &amp;c., is as follows: Angus (the chief wizard of the Tuatha de
   Danann) is visited in sleep by a maiden whose beauty throws him into love
   sick-ness. The whole of Ireland is scoured to find her the Dagda is appealed
   to in vain. At length, Bodb, fairy king of Munster, finds her at Loch bel
   Dracon (this is not the only trace of the impression which the story of Bel
   and the Dragon made upon the Irish mind). She lives there with 150 swans ; one
   year they are in swan shape the next in human shape. They appear as white
   birds with silvery chains and golden caps around their heads. Angus changes
   himself into a swan to he with her, and it is recorded of the music they made
   that "people fell asleep for three days and three nights." The
   soporific power of music is that which is chiefly commended in old Irish
   literature.</p>
 
   <p>
 I think it is obvious that the writer of
   our story was familiar with this and other legends in which swan-maids
   encircled with gold and silver chains appear, and that we may fairly draw the
   following conclusions from the preceding facts : There existed an Irish
   folk-tale of a king with two wives, one a water or sea fairy, whose children
   derive from her the capacity of shape-shifting dependent upon certain
   talismans ; jealousy impels the human wife to tamper with these talismans, and
   the children are condemned to remain in their animal form. This folk-tale was,
   probably at some time in the 14th or 15th century, arbitrarily fitted into the
   <i>cadre </i>of the Tuatha de Danann cycle, and entirely re-fashioned in a
   spirit of pious edification by a man who was in his way a great and admirable
   artist. The origin and nature of the story, all the elements of which are
   genuinely national, assured for it wide and lasting popularity. The evolution
   of the Irish folk-tale is in no way dependent upon that of the Continental
   folk-tale of the Seven Swans, but it is possible that the Celtic presentiment
   of the chain-girdled swans may have influenced it as well as the Swan Knight
   Romance.</p>

   115-65. A separate treatise on the subject has been given by S. Prato, 1882,
   La <i>Leggenda di Rhampsinite. </i>Both these writers connect the modern
   folk-tales with Herodotus' story of King Rampsinites. Mr. Knowles in his <i>Folk-tales

   The story of " Master Thief" has been heard among the tramps in
   London workhouses (Mayhew, <i>London Labour and London Poor, </i>iii. 119).</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks.-Thievery
   is universally human, and at first sight it might seem that there was no
   connection between these various versions of the " Master Thief."
   But the identity of the tricks by which the popular hero-thief gains his ends
   renders it impossible that they should have been independently invented

   XXXI. THE BLACK HORSE.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Sources.- From<i>
   </i>J. F. Campbell's manuscript collection now deposited at the Advocates'
   Library in Edinburgh (MS. 53, vol. xi.). Collected in Gaelic, February 14,
   1862, by Hector MacLean, from Roderick MacNeill, in the island of Menglay :
   MacNeill learnt the story about 1840 from a Barra man. I have omitted one
   visit of the Black Horse to Greece, but otherwise left the tale untouched. Mr.
   Nutt gave a short abstract of the story in his report on the Campbell MSS. in <i>Folk-lore,
   </i>i. 370.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Parallels.- Campbell<i>
   </i>gives the following parallels in his notes on the tale, which I quote
   verbatim. On the throwing into the well he remarks: "So this incident of'
   Lady Audley's Secret' was in the mind of a Barra peasant about 1840. Part of a
   modern novel may be as old as Aryan mythology, which was one point to be
   proved." [The incident of throwing into the well almost invariably forms
   a part of the tales of the White Cat type.]</p>
 
   <p>
 With regard to the Black Horse, Campbell
   notes that a Gaelic riddle makes a Black Horse identical with the West Wind,
   and adds "It is for consideration whether this Horse throws light on the
   sacred Wheel in Indian Sculptures it is to be noted that a Black Horse is the
   sacrificial colour."</p>
 
   <p>
 "The Cup is a well-known myth about
   winning a Fairy Cup which pervades Scandinavian England in many forms."
   "A silver ring, two quaint serpents heads pointing opposite ways, is a
   common Scandinavian wedding-ring many were to be got in Barra and elsewhere in
   1869, sold by emigrants bound for America."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Those who can account for myths must
   settle the geography of the Snow Mountain. Avalanches and glaciers are In
   Iceland, in the Caucasus, and in Central Asia. There are none within sight of
   Menglay. Hindoo cosmogony, which makes the world consist of seven rings,
   separated by seas and by a wall of mountains, may account for this in some
   sort."</p>
 
   <p>
 On the spikes driven into the Horse,
   Campbell compares the Norse story of " Dapple-grim" and the Horse
   sacrifice of the Mahabharata. On the building of the Magic Castle, Campbell
   remarks : "Twashtri was the Carpenter of the Vedic gods : can this be his
   work?"</p>
 
   <p>
 On the Horse's head being struck off
   Campbell comments: "This was the last act in the Aryan Horse's sacrifice,
   and the first step in the Horse apotheosis."</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks.-
   Campbell has the following note at the end of the tale, from which it would
   seem that in 1870 at least he was very nearly being an <i>Indiamaniac.</i></p>
 
   
   <p>
 "So ends this horse-riding story.
   Taking it as it is, with the test of language added, nothing short of an Asian
   origin will account for it. A Gaelic riddle makes 'a black horse' mean the
   invisible wind, and a theorist might suppose this horse to be the air
   personified. As Greece is mentioned, he might be Pegasus, who had to do with
   wells. But he had wings, and he was white, and there is nothing in classical
   fable like this Atlantic myth. 'The enchanted horse' of Arabian Nights was a
   flying machine, and his adventures are quite different. This is not the horse
   of Chaucer's Squire's Tale. He is more like 'Hrimfaxi,' the horse of the Edda,
   who drew the car of Nött in heaven, and was ridden round the earth in twelve
   hours, followed by Dagr and his glittering horse Skinfaxi. The black horse who
   always arrives at sunrise is like the horse of night, but there is no
   equivalent story in the Edda. 'Dapple-grim' in Norse tales is clad in a spiked
   bull's hide, and is mixed up with a blazing tar-barrel, but his adventures
   won't fit, and he was grey.</p>
 
   <p>
 "The story is but an imperfect
   skeleton. The cup was to give strength; he had to open seven gates after he
   got the cup, but it does nothing. The hood is to hide with; he went in and out
   of the palace unseen after he had got the hood, but it plays no part. The
   light shoes were the shoes of swiftness of course, but they never showed their
   paces. Baldr's horse was led to the funeral pile with all his gear; and Odin
   laid the gold ring Draupnir on the pile. Such rites might account for the ring
   in the blazing lake. Hermothr's ride northwards and downwards to the abode of
   Hel to seek Baldr, his leap over the grate, and his return with the ring (Edda
   25), might account for one adventure.</p>
 
   <p>
 "The many-coloured horses of the sun
   in the Indian mythology and solar myths may account for all these horses,
   astronomically or meteorologically. The old Aryan Aswa Medha or sacrifice of a
   black horse, and the twelve adventures of Arjuna as told in the Mahabbarata,
   are something like this story in some general vague way. But the simplest
   explanation of this Menglay myth, fished out of the Atlantic, is to admit that
   'the black horse' and all this mythical breed came west with men who rode from
   the land where horses were tamed, which is unknown."</p>

 XXXII. THE VISION OF MACCONGLINNEY.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Source.-
   Kindly condensed by Mr. Alfred Nutt from Prof. Meyer's edition of <i>The
   Vision </i>published in book form in 1892. This contains two versions, a
   longer one from a fourteenth century M S~, <i>Leabhar Breac or Speckled Book, </i>and
   a shorter one from a sixteenth century MS. in the Library of Trinity College,
   Dublin. A translation of the former version was given by the late W. M.
   Hennessy in <i>Fraser's Magazine, </i>September, 1873. Prof. Wollner, who
   contributed to Prof. Meyer's edition an introduction dealing with the story
   from the standpoint of comparative literature, considers that the later
   version reproduces the original common source more nearly.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Parallels.- At<i>
   </i>first sight <i>The Vision </i>seems to picture the Land of Cockayne (on
   which see Poeschel, <i>Das Mährchen vom Schlaraffenlade,, </i>HaIle, 1878<i>),
   </i>but as Prof. Wollner remarks, the Irish form is much more simple and
   primitive, and represents rather an agricultural conception of a past <i>aurea
   aetas. </i>The conception of enormous appetite being due to the presence of a
   voracious animal or demon within the body is widespread among the folk. Prof.
   Wollner gives numerous parallels, <i>l.c. </i>XLVII.-LIII. The common
   expression 'to wolf ones food" is said to be derived from this
   conception. On the personification of disease, see Tylor, <i>Primitive
   Culture, </i>ii. 148.</p>
 
   <p>
 I can myself remember a tale somewhat
   similar to <i>The Vision </i>which I heard from my nurse in Australia, I fancy
   as a warning against gluttony. She told me of a man, who in swallowing large
   pieces of food had swallowed a little hairy monster, which grew and grew and
   grew and caused the man to be eating ah day to satisfy his visitors He was
   cured by being made to fast, and then a bowl of brandy was brought in front of
   his mouth into which the hairy thing, attracted by the fumes, jumped and 'vas
   drowned.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks.- W<i>e
   </i>have here an interesting example of the personification of disease in the
   form of a demon, of which some examples occur in the Gospels. The rollicking
   Rabelaisian tone in which the story is told prevents us, however, from
   attributing any serious belief in the conception by the Irish Monk the author
   of the tale, who was parodying, according to Prof. Wollner, the Visions of the
   Saints. Still he would be scarcely likely to use the conception, even for
   purposes of parody, unless it were current among the folk, and it occurs among
   them even at the present day. (See Hyde, <i>Beside the Fire, </i>p. 183.)</p>

 XXXIII. DREAM OF OWEN O'MULREADY.</p>

 Parallel.-
   Croker's <i>Daniel O'Rourke </i>may be compared in part.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks. - At<i>
   </i>first sight a mere droll, the story has its roots In the most primitive
   philosophy. Owen's problem is to get in the Land of Dreams. Now Dreamland, so
   all our students of Mythology are agreed, is the source and origin of our
   belief in souls and spirits. Owen's problem therefore resolves itself into
   this: where was he to go in order to come into closest contact with the world
   of spirits. Mark what he does - he clears the hearth and has his bed made in
   it. Now it is round the hearth that the fullest associations with the spirit
   life are clustered. The late M. Fustel de Coulanges in his <i>Cité Antique </i>traces
   back most of the Greek and Roman religions and a large number of their
   institutions to the worship of the ancestors localised on the hearth. The late
   Professor Hearn extended his line of research to the whole of the Aryans in
   his <i>Aryan Household. </i>It will thus be seen from this course of
   reasoning, that Owen was acting on the most approved primitive principles in
   adopting this curious method of obtaining dreams. The story is not known
   elsewhere than in Ireland, and we are therefore at liberty to apply the method
   of Survivals to this case.</p>

   Achill folk-tales ; it occurs in two others of Mr. Larminie's stories. On the
   framework, see note on "Conal Yellow claw" <i>(Celtic Folktales, </i>v.).

 XXXVIII. THE RUSSET DOG.</p>
 
   <i>

 Source.- I<i>
   </i>have made up this Celtic Reynard out of several fables given by Campbell, <i>West
   Highland Tales, </i>under the title "Fables," vol. i. pp.275 <i>seq.;
   </i>and "The Keg of Butter" and the "The Fox and the little
   Bonnach," vol. iii. Nos. lxv. lxvi.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Parallels.- The<i>
   </i>Fox's ruse about a truce among the animals is a well-known Aesop's Fable
   see my edition of <i>Carton's Aesop, </i>vol. ii. p.307, and <i>Parallels, </i>vol.
   i. p.267. The trick by which the cock gets out of the fox's mouth is a part of
   the Reynard Cycle, and is given by Chaucer as his "Nonne Preste's
   Tale." How the wolf lost his tail is also part of the same cycle, the
   parallels of which are given by K. Krohn, <i>Bär (Wolf) und Fuchs </i>(Helsingfors,
   1889), pp.26-8. The same writer has studied the geographical distribution of
   the story in Finland, accompanied by a map, in <i>Fennia, </i>iv. No.4. I have
   given a mediaeval Hebrew version in my <i>Jews</i> <i>of Angevin England, </i>pp.
   170-2. See also Gerber, <i>Great Russian Animal Tales, </i>pp. 48-50. The wolf
   was originally the bear, as we see from the conclusion of the incident, which
   professes to explain why the wolf is stumpy-tailed. "The Keg of Butter
   " combines two of the Grimm stories, 2, 189. "The Little
   Bonnach" occurs also in English and has been given in two variants in <i>English
   Fairy Tales, </i>No. xxviii. and <i>More English Fairy Tales, </i>No. lvii.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks.- It
   would lead me too far afield to discuss here the sources of Reynard the Fox,
   with which I hope shortly to deal at length elsewhere. But I would remark that
   in this case, as in several others we have observed, the stories, which are
   certainly reproductions, have received the characteristic Celtic dress. It
   follows that we cannot conclude anything as to the origin of a tale from the
   fact that it is told idiomatically. On the other hand, the stories of"
   The Fox and Wrens "and " The Fox and the Todhunter,' and ' How the
   Fox gets rid of his Fleas," have no parallels elsewhere, and show the
   possibility of a native beast tale or cycle of tales.</p>

 Parallels. -
   Parnell's poem, <i>Edwin and Sir Topaz, </i>contains the same story. As he was
   born in Dublin, 1679, this traces the tale back at least 200 years in Ireland.
   Practically the same story, however, has been found in Japan, and translated
   into English under the title, "Kobutori ; or, The Old Man and the
   Devils." In the story published by Kobunsha, Tokio, the Old Man has a
   lump on the side of his face. He sees the demons dancing, and getting
   exhilarated, joins in. Thereupon the devils are so delighted that they wish to
   see him again, and as a pledge of his return take away from him his lump.
   Another old man, who has a similar lump on the other side of his face, hearing
   of this, tries the same plan, but dances so badly that the devils, not wishing
   to see him again, and mistaking him for the other old man, give him back the
   lump, so that he has one on each side of his face.</p>
 
   <p>
 I may add here that Mr. York Powell informs
   me that No. xvii. of the same series, entitled, " Shippietaro,"
   contains a parallel to the "Hobyahs" of <i>More
   English Tales.</i></p>
 
   <p>
 Remarks.- Here<i>
   </i>we have a problem of diffusion presented in its widest form. There can be
   little doubt that "The Legend of Knockgrafton " and "
   Kobutori," one collected in Ireland and to be traced there for the last
   200 years, and the other collected at the present day in Japan, are one and
   the same story, and it is impossible to imagine they were independently
   produced. Considering that Parnell could not have come across the Japanese
   version, we must conclude that "Kobutori "is a recent importation
   into Japan. On the other hand, as "the Hobyahs" cannot be traced in
   England, and was collected from a Scottish family settled in the United
   States, where Japanese influence has been considerable, it is possible that
   this tale was derived from Japan within the memory of men still living. It
   would be highly desirable to test these two cases, in which we seem to be able
   to observe the process of the diffusion of Folk Tales going on before our
   eyes.</p>

   tells a story of a door in a rock near a cave in the mountains of Brecknock,
   which was left open for Mayday, and men used to enter, and so reach that fairy
   island in the middle of the lake. The visitors were treated very hospitably by
   their fairy hosts, but on the condition that they might eat all, but pocket
   none; for once, a visitor took away with him a fairy flower, and as soon as he
   got outside the door the flower vanished, and the door was never more opened.
   "The Luck of Edenhall," still in existence, is supposed to be a
   trophy brought back from a similar visit.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks.- Mr<i>.
   </i>Hartland suggests that these legends, and the relics connected with them,
   are in some way connected with the heathen rites prevalent in these islands
   before the introduction of Christianity, which may have lingered on into
   historic times. The absence of sunlight in this account of the House of the
   Fairies, as in "Childe Rowland " (on which see note in <i>English
   Fairy Tales), </i>may be regarded as a point in favour of Mr. MacRitchie's
   theories as to the identification of the fairies with the mound-dwellers. The
   object of the expectoration was to prevent Elidore's seeing his way back. Thus
   the fairies prevent the indiscretions of the human midwives they employ.</p>

 Parallels.- The<i>
   </i>earliest version, from an Egerton MS. of the fifteenth century, has been
   printed by Mr. S. H. O'Grady in his <i>Silva Gadelica, </i>No.20, with an
   English version, pp.332-42. Mr. Campbell of Tiree has given a short Gaelic
   version in the <i>Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, </i>78-100.
   Campbell of Islay collected the fullest version of this celebrated story,
   which is to be found among his manuscript remains now in Edinburgh. Mr. Nutt
   has given his English abstract in <i>Folk-lore, </i>i. 373-7, in its original
   form. The story must have contained twenty-four tales or episodes of stories,
   nineteen of which are preserved in J. F. Campbell's version. For parallels to
   the various incidents, see Mr. Nutt's notes on Maclnnes, pp. 47~3. The tale is
   referred to in MacNicol, <i>Remarks on Dr. Johnson's Journey to the Hebrides, </i>1779.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 Remarks.-
   Nothing could give a more vivid idea of what might be called the organisation
   of the art of story-telling among the Celts than this elaborate tale. Mr. Nutt
   is inclined to trace it, even in its present form, back to the twelfth or,
   thirteenth century. It occurs in an MS. of the fifteenth century in an
   obviously unoriginal form which shows that the story-teller did not appreciate
   the significance of many features in the folk-tale he was retelling, and yet
   it was orally collected by the great Campbell in 1871, in a version which runs
   to 142 folio pages.</p>
 
   <p>
 Formally, its interest consists in large
   measure in the curious frame-work in which the subsidiary stories are
   imbedded. This is not of the elaborate kind introduced into Europe from the
   East by the Crusades, but more <i>naive, </i>resembling rather, as Mr. Nutt
   points out to me, the loosely-knit narratives of Charles Lever in his earlier
   manner.</p>

 Remarks.- There<i>
   </i>can be no doubt that the Celtic and German Riddle Stories are related
   genealogically. Which is of the earlier generation is, however, more difficult
   to determine. In favour of the Celtic is the polygamous framework; while on
   the other hand, it is difficult to guess how the story could have got from the
   Highlands to Germany. The simpler form of the riddle in the German version
   might seem to argue greater antiquity.</p>
