 <center><h1>The Tail</h1></center>
   <p>
 THERE
   was a shepherd once who went out to the hill to look after his sheep. It was
   misty and cold, and he had much trouble to find them. At last he had them all
   but one ; and after much searching he found that one too in a peat hag, half
   drowned; so he took off his plaid, and bent down and took hold of the sheep's
   tail, and he pulled ! The sheep was heavy with water, and he could not lift
   her, so he took off his coat and he <i>pulled !! </i>but it was too much for
   him, so he spit on his hands, and took a good hold of the tail and he PULLED !
   ! and the tail broke! and if it had not been for that this tale would have
   been a great deal longer.</p>
