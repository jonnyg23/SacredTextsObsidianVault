 <center><h1>Smallhead and the King's Sons</h1></center>
   <p>
 <br>
 
   
   A LONG ago there lived in Erin a woman who married a man of high degree and had
   one daughter. Soon after the birth of the daughter the husband died.</p>
 
   <p>
 The woman was not long a widow when she married a second time,
   and had two daughters. These two daughters hated their half-sister, thought
   she was not so wise as another, and nicknamed her Smallhead. When the elder of
   the two sisters was fourteen years old their father died. The mother was in
   great grief then, and began to pine away. She used to sit at home in the
   corner and never left the house. Smallhead was kind to her mother, and the
   mother was fonder of her eldest daughter than of the other two, who were
   ashamed of her.</p>
 
   <p>
 At last the two sisters made up in their minds to kill their
   mother. One day, while their half-sister was gone, they put the mother in a
   pot, boiled her, and threw the bones outside. When Smallhead came home there
   was no sign of the mother.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Where is my mother?" asked she of the other two.</p>
 
   <p>
 "She went out somewhere. How should we know where she is
   ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh! wicked girls ! you have killed my mother," said
   Smallhead.</p>
 
   <p>
 Smallhead wouldn't leave the house now at all, and the sisters
   were very angry.</p>
 
   <p>
 "No man will marry either one of us," said they,
   "if he sees our fool of a sister."</p>
 
   <p>
 Since they could not drive Smallhead from the house they made
   up their minds to go away themselves. One fine morning they left home unknown
   to their half-sister and travelled on many miles. When Smallhead discovered
   that her sisters were gone she hurried after them and never stopped till she
   came up with the two. They had to go home with her that day, but they scolded
   her bitterly.</p>
 
   <p>
 The two settled then to kill Smallhead, so one day they took
   twenty needles and scattered them outside in a pile of straw. "We are
   going to that hill beyond," said they, "to stay till evening, and if
   you have not all the needles that are in that straw outside gathered and on
   the tables before us, we'll have your life."</p>
 
   <p>
 Away they went to the hill. Smallhead sat down, and was crying
   bitterly when a short grey cat walked in and spoke to her.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Why do you cry and lament so?" asked the cat.</p>
 
   <p>
 "My sisters abuse me and beat me," answered
   Smallhead. "This morning they said they would kill me in the evening
   unless I had all the needles in the straw outside gathered before them."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Sit down here," said the cat, "and dry your
   tears."</p>
 
   <p>
 The cat soon found the twenty needles and brought them to
   Smallhead. " Stop there now," said the cat, "and listen to what
   I tell you. I am your mother ; your sisters killed me and destroyed my body,
   but don't harm them; do them good, do the best you can for them, save them
   obey my words and it will be better for you in the end."</p>
 
   <p>
 The cat went away for herself, and the sisters came home in
   the evening. The needles were on the table before them. Oh, but they were
   vexed and angry when they saw the twenty needles, and they said some one was
   helping their sister</p>
 
   <p>
 One night when Smallhead was in bed and asleep they started
   away again, resolved this time never to return. Smallhead slept till morning.
   When she saw that the sisters were gone she followed, traced them from place
   to place, inquired here and there day after day, till one evening some person
   told her that they were in the house of an old hag, a terrible enchantress,
   who had one son and three daughters that the house was a bad place to be in,
   for the old hag had more power of witchcraft than any one and was very wicked.</p>
 
   <p>
 Smallhead hurried away to save her sisters, and facing the
   house knocked at the door, and asked lodgings for God's sake.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh, then," said the hag, "it is hard to refuse
   any one lodgings, and besides on such a wild, stormy night. I wonder if you
   are anything to the young ladies who came the way this evening?"</p>
 
   <p>
 The two sisters heard this arid were angry enough that
   Smallhead was in it, but they said nothing, not wishing the old hag to know
   their relationship. After supper the hag told the three strangers to sleep in
   a room on the right side of the house. When her own daughters were going to
   bed Smallhead saw her tie a ribbon around the neck of each one of them, and
   heard her say: "Do you sleep in the left-hand bed." Smallhead
   hurried and said to her sisters : "Come quickly, or I'll tell the woman
   who you are."</p>
 
   <p>
 They took the bed in the left-hand room and were in it before
   the hag's daughters came.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh," said the daughters, "the other bed is as
   good.' So they took the bed in the right-hand room. When Smallhead knew that
   the hag's daughters were asleep she rose, took the ribbons off their necks,
   and put them on her sister's necks and on her own. She lay awake and watched
   them. After a while she heard the hag say to her son:</p>
 
   <p>
 "Go, now, and kill the three girls ; they have the
   clothes and money."</p>
 
   <p>
 "You have killed enough in your life and so let these
   go," said the son.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But the old woman would not listen. The boy
 rose up, fearing his mother, and taking a long knife, went to the right-hand
 room and cut the throats of the three girls without ribbons. He went to bed then
 for himself, and when Smallhead found that the old hag was asleep she roused her
 sisters, told what had happened, made them dress quickly and follow her. Believe
 me, they were willing and glad to follow her this time.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The three travelled briskly and came soon to a bridge called at
 that time "The Bridge of Blood." Whoever had killed a person could not
 cross the bridge. When the three girls came to the bridge the two sisters
 stopped they could not go a step further. Smallhead ran across and went back
 again.</p>
 
 <p>
 "If I did not know that you killed our mother," said
 she, "I might know it now, for this is the Bridge of Blood."</p>
 
 <p>
 She carried one sister over the bridge on her back and then the
 other. Hardly was this done when the hag was at the bridge.</p>
 
 <p>
 Bad luck to you, Smallhead " said she, "I did not know
 that it was you that was in it last evening. You have killed my three
 daughters."</p>
 
 <p>
 "It wasn't I that killed them, but yourself," said
 Small-head.</p>
 
 <p>
 The old hag could not cross the bridge, so she began to curse,
 and she put every curse on Smallhead that she could remember. The sisters
 travelled on till they came to a King's castle. They heard that two servants
 were needed in the castle.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Go now," said Smallhead to the two sisters, "and
 ask for service. Be faithful and do well. You can never go back by the road you
 came."</p>
 
 <p>
 The two found employment at the King's castle. Smallhead took
 lodgings in the house of a blacksmith near by.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I should be glad to find a place as kitchen-maid in the
 castle," said Smallhead to the blacksmith's wife.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will go to the castle and find a place for you if I
 can," said the woman.</p>
 
 <p>
 The blacksmith's wife found a place for Smallhead as
 kitchen-maid in the castle, and she went there next day.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I must be careful," thought Smallhead, "and do
 my best. I am in a strange place. My two sisters are here in the King's castle.
 Who knows, we may have great fortune yet."</p>
 
 <p>
 She dressed neatly and was cheerful. Every one liked her, liked
 her better than her sisters, though they were beautiful. The King had two sons,
 one at home and the other abroad. Smallhead thought to herself one day: "It
 is time for the son who is here in the castle to marry. I will speak to him the
 first time I can." One day she saw him alone in the garden, went up to him,
 and said :</p>
 
 <p>
 "Why are you not getting married, it is high time for
 you?"</p>
 
 <p>
 He only laughed and thought she was too bold, but then thinking
 that she was a simple-minded girl who wished to be pleasant, he said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will tell you the reason : My grandfather bound my
 father by an oath never to let his oldest son marry until he could get the Sword
 of Light, and I am afraid that I shall be long without marrying."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Do you know where the Sword of Light is, or who has
 it?" asked Smallhead.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I do," said the King's son, "an old hag who has
 great power and enchantment, and she lives a long distance from this beyond the
 Bridge of Blood. I cannot go there myself, I cannot cross the bridge, for I have
 killed men in battle. Even if I could cross the bridge I would not go, for many
 is the King's son that hag has destroyed or enchanted."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Suppose some person were to bring the Sword of Light, and
 that person a woman, would you marry her?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I would, indeed," said the King's son.</p>
 
 <p>
 "If you promise to marry my elder sister I will strive to
 bring the Sword of Light."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will promise most willingly," said the King's son.</p>
 
 <p>
 Next morning early, Smallhead set out on her journey. Calling at
 the first shop she bought a stone weight of salt, and went on her way, never
 stopping or resting till she reached the hag's house at nightfall. She climbed
 to the gable, looked down, and saw the son making a great pot of stirabout for
 his mother, and she hurrying him, "I am as hungry as a hawk !" cried
 she.</p>
 
 <p>
 Whenever the boy looked away, Smallhead dropped salt down,
 dropped it when he was not looking, dropped it till she had the whole stone of
 salt in the stirabout. The old hag waited and waited till at last she cried out:
 "Bring the stirabout. I am starving! Bring the pot. I will eat from the
 pot. Give the milk here as well."</p>
 
 <p>
 The boy brought the stirabout and the milk, the old woman began
 to eat, but the first taste she got she spat out and screamed "You put salt
 in the pot in place of meal !"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I did not, mother."</p>
 
 <p>
 "You did, and it's a mean trick that you played on me.
 Throw this stirabout to the pig outside and go for water to the well in the
 field."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I cannot go," said the boy, "the night is too
 dark; I might fall into the well."</p>
 
 <p>
 "You must go and bring the water; I cannot live till
 morning without eating."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I am as hungry as yourself," said the boy, "but
 how can I go to the well without a light? I will not go unless you give me a
 light."</p>
 
 <p>
 "If I give you the Sword of Light there is no knowing who
 may follow you ; maybe that devil of a Smallhead is outside."</p>
 
 <p>
 But sooner than fast till morning the old hag gave the Sword of
 Light to her son, warning him to take good care of it. He took the Sword of
 Light and went out. As he saw no one when he came to the well he left the sword
 on the top of the steps going down to the water, so as to have good light. He
 had not gone down many steps when Smallhead had the sword, and away she ran over
 hills, dales, and valleys towards the Bridge of Blood.</p>
 
 <p>
 The boy shouted and screamed with all his might. Out ran the
 hag. " Where is the sword ? " cried she.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Some one took it from the step."</p>
 
 <p>
 Off rushed the hag, following the light, but she didn't come
 near Smallhead till she was over the bridge.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Give me the Sword of Light, or bad luck to you,"
 cried the hag.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Indeed, then, I will not ; I will keep it, and bad luck to
 yourself," answered Smallhead.</p>
 
 <p>
 On the following morning she walked up to the King's son and
 said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "I have the Sword of Light; now will you marry my
 sister?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will," said he.</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's son married Smallhead's sister and got the Sword of
 Light. Smallhead stayed no longer in the kitchen - the sister didn't care to
 have her in kitchen or parlour.</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's second son came home. He was not long in the castle
 when Smallhead said to herself, "Maybe he will marry my second
 sister."</p>
 
 <p>
 She saw him one day in the garden, went toward him he said
 something, she answered, then asked : "Is it not time for you to be getting
 married like your brother ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "When my grandfather was dying," said the young man,
 "he bound my father not to let his second son marry till he had the Black
 Book. This book used to shine and give brighter light than ever the Sword of
 Light did, and I suppose it does yet. The old hag beyond the Bridge of Blood has
 the book, and no one dares to go near her, for many is the King's son killed or
 enchanted by that woman."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Would you marry my second sister if you were to get the
 Black Book ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I would, indeed ; I would marry any woman if I got the
 Black Book with her. The Sword of Light and the Black Book were in our family
 till my grandfather's time, then they were stolen by that cursed old hag."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will have the book," said Smallhead, " or die
 in the trial to get it."</p>
 
 <p>
 Knowing that stirabout was the main food of the hag, Smallhead
 settled in her mind to play another trick. Taking a bag she scraped the chimney,
 gathered about a stone of soot, and took it with her. The night was dark and
 rainy. When she reached the hag's house, she climbed up the gable to the chimney
 and found that the son was making stirabout for his mother. She dropped the soot
 down by degrees till at last the whole stone of soot was in the pot; then she
 scraped around the top of the chimney till a lump of soot fell on the boy's
 hand.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Oh, mother," said he, "the night is wet and
 soft, the soot is falling."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Cover the pot," said the hag. " Be quick with
 that stirabout, I am starving."</p>
 
 <p>
 The boy took the pot to his mother.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Bad luck to you," cried the hag the moment she tasted
 the stirabout, "this is full of soot ; throw it out to the pig."</p>
 
 <p>
 "If I throw it out there is no water inside to make more,
 and I'll not go in the dark and rain to the well."</p>
 
 <p>
 "You must go !" screamed she.</p>
 
 <p>
 "l'll not stir a foot out of this unless I get a
 light," said the boy.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Is it the book you are thinking of, you fool, to take it
 and lose it as you did the sword? Smallhead is watching you."</p>
 
 <p>
 "How could Smallhead, the creature, be outside all the
 time? If you have no use for the water you can do without it."</p>
 
 <p>
 Sooner than stop fasting till morning, the hag gave her son the
 book, sayilng: " Do not put this down or let it from your hand till you
 come in, or I'll have your life."</p>
 
 <p>
 The boy took the book and went to the well. Smallhead followed
 him carefully. He took the book down into the well with him, and when he was
 stooping to dip water she snatched the book and pushed him into the well, where
 he came very near drowning.</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead was far away when the boy recovered, and began to
 scream and shout to his mother. She came in a hurry, and finding that the book
 was gone, fell into such a rage that she thrust a knife into her son's heart and
 ran after Smallhead, who had crossed the bridge before the hag could come up
 with her.</p>
 
 <p>
 When the old woman saw Smallhead on the other side of the bridge
 facing her and dancing with delight, she screamed :</p>
 
 <p>
 "You took the Sword of Light and the Black Book, and your
 two sisters are married. Oh, then, bad luck to you. I will put my curse on you
 wherever you go. You have all my children killed, and I a poor, feeble, old
 woman."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Bad luck to yourself," said Smallhead. "I am not
 afraid of a curse from the like of you. If you had lived an honest life you
 wouldn't be as you are to-day."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Now, Smallhead," said the old hag, "you have me
 robbed of everything, and my children destroyed. Your two sisters are well
 married. Your fortune began with my ruin. Come, now, and take care of me in my
 old age. I'll take my curse from you, and you will have good luck. I bind myself
 never to harm a hair of your head."</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead thought awhile, promised to do this, and said "If
 you harm me, or try to harm me, it will be the worse for yourself."</p>
 
 <p>
 The old hag was satisfied and went home. Smallhead went to the
 castle and was received with great joy. Next morning she found the King's son in
 the garden, and said :</p>
 
 <p>
 "If you marry my sister to-morrow, you will have the Black
 Book."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will marry her gladly," said the King's son.</p>
 
 <p>
 Next day the marriage was celebrated and the King's son got the
 book. Smallhead remained in the castle about a week, then she left good health
 with her sisters and went to the hag's house. The old woman was glad to see her
 and showed the girl her work. All Smallhead had to do was to wait on the hag and
 feed a large pig that she had.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I am fatting that pig," said the hag ; "he is
 seven years old now, and the longer you keep a pig the harder his meat is :
 we'll keep this pig a while longer, and then we'll kill and eat him."</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead did her work; the old hag taught her some things, and
 Smallhead learned herself far more than the hag dreamt of. The girl fed the pig
 three times a day, never thinking that he could be anything but a pig. The hag
 had sent word to a sister that she had in the Eastern World, bidding her come
 and they would kill the pig and have a great feast. The sister came, and one day
 when the hag was going to walk with her sister she said to Smallhead:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Give the pig plenty of meal to-day ; this is the last food
 he'll have ; give him his fill."</p>
 
 <p>
 The pig had his own mind and knew what was coming. He put his
 nose under the pot and threw it on Smallhead's toes, and she barefoot. With that
 she ran into the house for a stick, and seeing a rod on the edge of the loft,
 snatched it and hit the pig.</p>
 
 <p>
 That moment the pig was a splendid young man.</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead was amazed.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Never fear," said the young man, " I am the son
 of a King that the old hag hated, the King of Munster. She stole me from my
 father seven years ago and enchanted me-made a pig of me."</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead told the King's son, then, how the hag had treated
 her. "I must make a pig of you again," said she, "for the hag is
 coming. Be patient and I'll save you, if you promise to marry me."</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 "I promise you," said the King's son.</p>
 
 <p>
 With that she struck him, and he was a pig again. She put the
 switch in its place and was at her work when the two sisters came. The pig ate
 his meal now with a good heart, for he felt sure of rescue.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Who is that girl you have in the house, and where did you
 find her? " asked the sister.</p>
 
 <p>
 "All my children died of the plague, and I took this girl
 to help me. She is a very good servant."</p>
 
 <p>
 At night the hag slept in one room, her sister in another, and
 Smallhead in a third. When the two sisters were sleeping soundly Smallhead rose,
 stole the hag's magic book, and then took the rod. She went next to where the
 pig was, and with one blow of the rod made a man of him.</p>
 
 <p>
 With the help of the magic book Smallhead made two doves of
 herself and the King's son, and they took flight through the air and flew on
 without stopping. Next morning the hag called Smallhead, but she did not come.
 She hurried out to see the pig. The pig was gone. She ran to her book. Not a
 sign of it.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Oh I" cried she, "that villain of a Smallhead
 has robbed me. She has stolen my book, made a man of the pig, and taken him away
 with her."</p>
 
 <p>
 What could she do but tell her whole story to the sister.
 "Go you," said she, " and follow them. You have more enchantment
 than Smallhead has."</p>
 
 <p>
 "How am I to know them ? asked the sister.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Bring the first two strange things that you find; they
 will turn themselves into something wonderful."</p>
 
 <p>
 The sister then made a hawk of herself and flew away as swiftly
 as any March wind.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Look behind," said Smallhead to the King's son some
 hours later; "see what is coming."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I see nothing" said he, "but a hawk coming
 swiftly."</p>
 
 <p>
 "That is the hag's sister. She has three times more
 enchantment than the hag herself. But fly down on the ditch and be picking
 yourself as doves do in rainy weather, and maybe she'll pass without seeing
 us."</p>
 
 <p>
 The hawk saw the doves, but thinking them nothing wonderful,
 flew on till evening, and then went back to her sister.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Did you see anything wonderful?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I did not; I saw only two doves, and they picking
 themselves."</p>
 
 <p>
 "You fool, those doves were Smallhead and the King's son.
 Off with you in the morning and don't let me see you again without the two with
 you."</p>
 
 <p>
 Away went the hawk a second time, and swiftly as Smallhead and
 the King's son flew, the hawk was gaining on them. Seeing this Smallhead and the
 King's son dropped down into a large village, and, it being market-day, they
 made two heather brooms of themselves. The two brooms began to sweep the road
 without any one holding them, and swept toward each other. This was a great
 wonder. Crowds gathered at once around the two brooms.</p>
 
 <p>
 The old hag flying over in the form of a hawk saw this and
 thinking that it must be Smallhead and the King's son were in it, came down,
 turned into a woman, and said to herself:</p>
 
 <p>
 "I'll have those two brooms."</p>
 
 <p>
 She pushed forward so quickly through the crowd that she came
 near knocking down a man standing before her. The man was vexed.</p>
 
 <p>
 "You cursed old hag!" cried he, "do you want to
 knock us down?" With that he gave her a blow and drove her against another
 man, that man gave her a push that sent her spinning against a third man, and so
 on till between them all they came near putting the life out of her, and pushed
 her away from the brooms. A woman 'n the crowd called out then:</p>
 
 <p>
 "It would be nothing but right to knock the head off that
 old hag, and she trying to push us away from the mercy of God, for it was God
 who sent the brooms to sweep the road for us."</p>
 
 <p>
 "True for you," said another woman. With that the
 people were as angry as angry could be, and were ready to kill the hag. They
 were going to take the head off the hag when she made a hawk of herself and flew
 away, vowing never to do another stroke of work for her sister. She might do her
 own work or let it alone.</p>
 
 <p>
 When the hawk disappeared the two heather brooms rose and turned
 into doves. The people felt sure when they saw the doves that the brooms were a
 blessing from heaven, and it was the old hag that drove them away.</p>
 
 <p>
 On the following day Smallhead and the King's son saw his
 father's castle, and the two came down not too far from it in their own forms.
 Smallhead was a very beautiful woman now, and why not? She had the magic and
 didn't spare it. She made herself as beautiful as ever she could: the like of
 her was not to be seen in that kingdom or the next one.</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's son was in love with her that minute, and did not
 wish to part with her, but she would not go with him.</p>
 
 <p>
 "When you are at your father's castle," said
 Smallhead, "all will be overjoyed to see you, and the king will give a
 great feast in your honour. If you kiss any one or let any living thing kiss
 you, you'll forget me for ever."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will not let even my own mother kiss me," said he.</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's son went to the castle. All were overjoyed; they had
 thought him dead, had not seen him for seven years. He would let no one come
 near to kiss him. "I am bound by oath to kiss no one," said he to his
 mother. At that moment an old grey hound came in, and with one spring was on his
 shoulder licking his face: all that the King's son had gone through in seven
 years was forgotten in one moment.</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead went toward a forge near the castle. The smith had a
 wife far younger than himself, and a stepdaughter. They were no beauties. In the
 rear of the forge was a well and a tree growing over it. "I will go up in
 that tree," thought Smallhead. "and spend the night in it." She
 went up and sat just over the well. She was not long in the tree when the moon
 came out high above the hill tops and shone on the well. The blacksmith's
 stepdaughter, coming for water, looked down in the well, saw the face of the
 woman above in the tree, thought it her own face, and cried:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Oh, then, to have me bringing water to a smith, and I such
 a beauty. I'll never bring another drop to him." With that she cast the
 pail in the ditch and ran off to find a king's son to marry.</p>
 
 <p>
 When she was not coming with the water, and the blacksmith
 waiting to wash after his day's work in the forge, he sent the mother. The
 mother had nothing but a pot to get the water in, so off she went with that, and
 coming to the well saw the beautiful face in the water.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Oh, you black, swarthy villain of a smith," cried
 she, "bad luck to the hour that I met you, and I such a beauty. I'll never
 draw another drop of water for the life of you.</p>
 
 <p>
 She threw the pot down, broke it, and hurried away to find some
 king's son.</p>
 
 <p>
 When neither mother nor daughter came back with water the smith
 himself went to see what was keeping them. He saw the pail in the ditch, and,
 catching it, went to the well; looking down, he saw the beautiful face of a
 woman in the water. Being a man, he knew that it was not his own face that was
 in it, so he looked up, and there in the tree saw a woman. He spoke to her and
 said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "I know now why my wife and her daughter did not bring
 water. They saw your face in the well, and, thinking themselves too good for me,
 ran away. You must come now and keep the house till I find them."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will help you," said Smallhead. She came down, went
 to the smith's house, and showed the road that the women took. The smith hurried
 after them, and found the two in a village ten miles away. He explained their
 own folly to them, and they came home.</p>
 
 <p>
 The mother and daughter washed fine linen for the castle,
 Smallhead saw them ironing one day, and said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Sit down: I will iron for you."</p>
 
 <p>
 She caught the iron, and in an hour had the work of the day
 done.</p>
 
 <p>
 The women were delighted. In the evening the daughter took the
 linen to the housekeeper at the castle.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Who ironed this linen?" asked the housekeeper.</p>
 
 <p>
 " My mother and I."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Indeed, then, you did not. You can't do the like of that
 work, and tell me who did it."</p>
 
 <p>
 The girl was in dread now and answered:</p>
 
 <p>
 "It is a woman who is stopping with us who did the
 ironing."</p>
 
 <p>
 The housekeeper went to the Queen and showed her the linen.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Send that woman to the castle," said the Queen.</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead went: the Queen welcomed her, wondered at her beauty;
 put her over all the maids in the castle. Smallhead could do anything; everybody
 was fond of her. The King's son never knew that he had seen her before, and she
 lived in the castle a year; what the Queen told her she did.</p>
 
 <p>
 The King had made a match for his son with the daughter of the
 King of Ulster. There was a great feast in the castle in honour of the young
 couple, the marriage, was to be a week later. The bride's father brought many of
 his people who were versed in all kinds of tricks and enchantment.</p>
 
 <p>
 The King knew that Smallhead could do many things, for neither
 the Queen nor himself had asked her to do a thing that she did not do in a
 twinkle.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Now," said the King to the Queen, "I think she
 can do something that his people cannot do." He summoned Smallhead and
 asked:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Can you amuse the strangers ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I can if you wish me to do so."</p>
 
 <p>
 When the time came and the Ulster men had shown their best
 tricks, Smallhead came forward and raised the window, which was forty feet from
 the ground. She had a small ball of thread in her hand ; she tied one end of the
 thread to the window, threw the ball out and over a wall near the castle; then
 she passed out the window, walked on the thread and kept time to music from
 players that no man could see. She came in ; all cheered her and were greatly
 delighted.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I can do that," said the King of Ulster's daughter,
 and sprang out on the string; but if she did she fell and broke her neck on the
 stones below. There were cries, there was lamentation, and, in place of a
 marriage, a funeral.</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's son was angry and grieved and wanted to drive
 Smallhead from the castle in some way.</p>
 
 <p>
 "She is not to blame," said the King of Munster, who
 did nothing but praise her.</p>
 
 <p>
 Another year passed the King got the daughter of the King of
 Connacht for his son.</p>
 
 <p>
 There was a great feast before the wedding day, and as the
 Connacht people are full of enchantment and witchcraft, the King of Munster
 called Smallhead and said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Now show the best trick of any."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will," said Smallhead.</p>
 
 <p>
 When the feast was over and the Connacht men had shown their
 tricks the King of Munster called Smallhead.</p>
 
 <p>
 She stood before the company, threw two grains of wheat on the
 floor, and spoke some magic words. There was a hen and a cock there before her
 of beautiful plumage ; she threw a grain of wheat between them; the hen sprang
 to eat the wheat, the cock gave her a blow of his bill, the hen drew back,
 looked at him, arid said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Bad luck to you, you wouldn't do the like of that when I
 was serving the old hag and you her pig, and I made a man of you and gave you
 back your own form."</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's son looked at her and thought, " There must be
 something in this."</p>
 
 <p>
 Smallhead threw a second grain. The cock pecked the hen again.
 " Oh," said the hen, "you would not do that the day the hag's
 sister was hunting us, and we two doves."</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's son was still more astonished.</p>
 
 <p>
 She threw a third grain. The cock struck the hen, and she said,
 " You would not do that to me the day I made two heather brooms out of you
 and myself." She threw a fourth grain. The cock pecked the hen a fourth
 time. "You would not do that the day you promised not to let any living
 thing kiss you or kiss any one yourself but me - you let the hound kiss you and
 you forgot me."</p>
 
 <p>
 The King's son made one bound forward, embraced and kissed
 Smallhead, and told the King his whole story from beginning to end.</p>
 
 <p>
 This is my wife," said he ; "I'll marry no other
 woman."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Whose wife will my daughter be? " asked the King of
 Connacht.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Oh, she will be the wife of the man who will marry
 her," said the King of Munster, "my son gave his word to this woman
 before he saw your daughter, and he must keep it."</p>
 
 <p>
 So Smallhead married the King of Munster's son.</p>
