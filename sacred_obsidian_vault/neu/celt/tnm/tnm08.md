 <p>Before taking leave of the Giants I submit an illustration (<a href="#img_pl07">pl. VII.</a>) which puzzled me much. A cross-slab at Michael has on one face, and above the right arm of the cross, the figure of a man and a great bird. At first I thought of Loki seized by the giant Thiazzi in eagle form in the story of the Rape of Idwyn, <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a> but as was pointed out to me at the time by Dr. York Powell, the man is not holding on either to a stick or to the bird, but seems rather to</p>

 <p>be attacked by it. I think now there can be little doubt it refers to the fall of some hero unknown, such, for example, as Ottar the Doughty, of whom we read in "Ynlinga-Tal," 93-96: "Ottarr the Doughty fell by the weapons of the Danes, under the talons of the Eagle, when the war-vulture spurned him, the reason-endowed, with its brute carrion feet at Wendle."</p>  
 <p>Is not this Hræ-svelgr? As in Vafthruðnis-mal--"Hræ-svelgr (Carrion-gulper) is he called, a giant in eagle's shape,. that sits at the end of heaven; from under his wings the wind that blows over all men is said to come." So in the Edda (Gylfi's mocking). And in "Volu-spa"--"But the Eagle screams. Pale-beak tear corpses."</p>  
 <p>The other face of this stone is shown on <a href="tnm05.htm#img_pl04">pl. IV.</a></p>
