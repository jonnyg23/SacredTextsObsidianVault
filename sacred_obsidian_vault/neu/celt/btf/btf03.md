 <p align="CENTER">Dedication</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>To the memory of those truly cultured and unselfish men, the poet-scribes and hedge-schoolmasters of the last century and the beginning of this--men who may well be called the last of the Milesians--I dedicate this effort to preserve even a scrap of that native lore which in their day they loved so passionately, and for the preservation of which they worked so nobly, but in vain.</blockquote>
