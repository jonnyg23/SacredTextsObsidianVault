 <p>illuminated vellum in the known world. This ancient volume is the work of an unnamed Irish monk of Kells monastery in the seventh century. The weird and commanding beauty of the pages have been at once both the inspiration and despair of artists for centuries, and the wonder of line and color would be unbelievable but for the ancient manuscript treasured at Trinity College, Dublin. The soul of an artist went into the precious volume known even in tenth-century Europe as the "wonder of the Far Western World."</p>  
 <p>The music for the book was arranged by Geraldine G. Saltzberg.</p>  
 <p>All quoted verses or chants are in italic.</p>
