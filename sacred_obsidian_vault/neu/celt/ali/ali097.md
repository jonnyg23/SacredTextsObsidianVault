 <p align="CENTER">The Raven and Water Wagtail</p>
 <blockquote>If ravens come cawing about a house it is a sure sign of death, for the raven is Satan's own bird; so also is the water wagtail, yet beware of killing it, for it has three drops of the devil's blood in its little body, and ill-luck ever goes with it, and follows it.</blockquote>
