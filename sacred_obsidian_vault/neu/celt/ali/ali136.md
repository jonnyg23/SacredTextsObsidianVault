 <p align="CENTER">For Toothache</p>
 <blockquote>Go to a graveyard; kneel upon any grave; say three paters and three ayes for the soul of the dead lying beneath. Then take a handful of grass from the grave, chew it well, casting forth each bite without swallowing any portion. After this process the sufferer, were he to live a hundred years, will never have toothache any more.</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>Another.</blockquote>
 </i><blockquote>The patient must vow a vow to God, the Virgin, and the new moon, never to comb his hair on a Friday, in remembrance of relief should he be cured; and whenever or wherever he first sees the moon he must fall on his knees and say five prayers in gratitude for the cure, even if crossing a river at the time.</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>Another.</blockquote>

 <blockquote>"As Peter sat on a marble stone,<br>
 The Lord came to him all alone,<br>
 'Peter, Peter, what makes you shake?'<br>
 'O Lord and Master, it is the toothache.'<br>
 Then Christ said, 'Take these for My sake, <br>
 And never more you'll have toothache.'"</blockquote>
