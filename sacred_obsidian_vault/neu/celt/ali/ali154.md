 <p align="CENTER">To Find Stolen Goods</p>
 <blockquote>Place two keys on a sieve, in time form of a cross. Two men hold the sieve, while a third makes the sign of time cross on time forehead of the suspected party, and calls out his name loudly, three times over. If innocent, the keys remain stationary; but if guilty, the keys revolve slowly round time sieve, and then there is no doubt as to who is the thief.</blockquote>
