 <p align="CENTER">For the Mad Fever</p>
 <blockquote>Three stones must be charmed by the hands of a wise fairy doctor, and cast by his hand, saying as he does so--"The first stone I cast is for the head in the mad fever; the second stone I cast is for the heart in the mad fever; the third stone I cast is for the back in the mad fever.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"In the name of the Trinity, let peace come. AMEN."</blockquote>
