 <p align="CENTER">For the Red Rash</p>
 <blockquote>"Who will heal me from the red, thirsty, shivering cold disease that came from the foreigner, and kills people with its poisonous pain?" "The prayer of Mary to her Son, the prayer of Columbkill to God; these will heal thee. AMEN."</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>Another.</blockquote>
 </i><blockquote>Say this oration three times over the patient, making the sign of the cross each time--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Bridget, Patrick, Solomon, and the great Mary, banish this redness off you."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then take butter, breathe on it quite close, and give it to the person to chafe himself therewith.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>To ascertain if he will recover, put a handful of yarrow in his hand while he is sleeping; if it is withered in the morning he will die; but if it remains fresh the disease will leave him.</blockquote>
