 <p align="CENTER">St. Patrick</p>
 <blockquote>MANY saints in old time used to come and take up their abode in the wild desolate Western Islands for the rest and sanctity of solitude, and innumerable evidences of their presence still remain in the ancient ruins of the so-called cells or churches built in the rudest form, but always placed in a picturesque locality beside a well, which ever since has been held sacred, and no woman is allowed to wash her feet in the water.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In one of these islands is a stone bed called "The Bed of the Holy Ghost," and many people go from the mainland to lie a night in this bed, though the sea is always rough and dangerous, believing that it heals all diseases, and it brings good luck to all, and to women the blessing of children.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>If the lark sings on St. Bridget's Day it is a good omen, and a sign of fine weather. And whoever hears it the first. thing in the morning will have god luck in all he does for that whole day. St. Bridget was granted by the Lord to have every second Sunday fine so that. she might preach to the converts that came to her.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then St. Patrick greatly desired that his day should also be fine so that the people might gather together in remembrance of him, and this also was granted. So from that time forth the Saints! Day, the 17th of March, is always fine, for so it was decreed from the ancient times when he was upon earth.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>On St. Patrick's Day it is the usage in the islands to affix<i> </i>large crosses made of straw and flowers on the door-posts, and a black cock is sacrificed in honour of the saint, though no one can tell why it is considered necessary that blood should be spilt, except that the idea of sacrifice is found in all religions and rituals of worship. At first the object most loved or most prized was sacrificed--a child, or a costly jewel. Then the human sacrifice began to be replaced by the offering of an animal, who was made the medium of expiation. And the god was satisfied so that blood was spilled to purify from sin.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It is remarkable that relics of this ancient ritual of sacrifice can still be found even in the enlightened households of this advanced nineteenth century. An ox is still slaughtered at Christmas, though Baal is forgotten; and a lamb is sacrificed at Easter, as the Druids offered the firstlings of time flock to the Sun-god; while a goose is slain on St. Michael's Day as a burnt-offering to the saint.</blockquote>
