 <p align="CENTER">Sliabh-Mish, County Kerry</p>
 <blockquote>EVERY one knows that Sliabh-Mish, County Kerry, is haunted. The figure of a man, accompanied by a huge black dog<i>, </i>is frequently seen standing on a high crag, but as the traveller approaches, the forms disappear, although they rise up again before him on another crag, and so continue appearing and appearing as he journeys on. Many travellers have seen them but no one has ever yet been able to meet the man and the dog face to face on the mountain side, for they seem to melt away in the mist, and are seen no more on reaching the spot. It happened, once upon a time, that a man journeying alone over the mountain path, took out his snuff-box to solace himself with a pinch, and was putting it up again in his waistcoat pocket, when he heard a voice near him saying, "Not yet! not yet! I am near you, wait."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>He looked round, but not a soul was to be seen. however, he thought it right to be friendly, so he shook some snuff from the box in the palm of his hand and held it out in the air. But his hair stood on end, and he trembled with fright, when he felt invisible fingers on his hand picking up the snuff, and when he drew it back the snuff had disappeared.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"God and the saints between us and harm!" exclaimed the poor man, ready to drop down from terror.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Amen," responded the clear voice of some invisible speaker close beside him.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then the man quickly made the sign of the cross over the hand touched by the spirit, and so went on his way unharmed.</blockquote>
