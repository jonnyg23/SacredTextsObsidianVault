 <blockquote>Never tell your dreams fasting, and always tell them first to a woman called Mary.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>To dream of a hearse with white plumes is a wedding; but to dream of a wedding is grief, and death will follow.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>To dream of a woman kissing you is deceit; but of a man, friendship; and to dream of a horse is exceedingly lucky.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>To dream of a priest is bad; even to dream of the devil is better. Remember, also, either a present or a purchase from a priest is unlucky.</blockquote>
