 <p align="CENTER">For a Wound</p>
 <blockquote>Close the wound tightly with the two fingers, and repeat these words slowly--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"In the name of the Father, Son, and holy Mary. The wound was red, the cut was deep, and the flesh was sore; but there will be no more blood, and no more pain, till the blessed Virgin Mary bears a child again."</blockquote>
