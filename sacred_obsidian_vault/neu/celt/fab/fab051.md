 <h3 align="CENTER">XXXVI.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXVIII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IN the name of the Ruler of the high powers of heaven,<br>
 They sing of, they deplore the prince;<br>
 He rejected uniform ranks of the rulers,<br>
 Of the hosts of Run and Nudd and Nwython.<br>
 I will not praise contrary to the custom of the Bards of the Brython.<br>
 Wonderfully liberal of the knowledge of astrologers.<br>
 One station of the complete songster; excellent of song,<br>
 I ardently desire; I will sing to the Guledig,<br>
 In the country where he was trembling, <a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a><br>
 10 he will not cause me to be unable to form the lay.<br>
 It is difficult to utter odes;<br>
 That will not be deficient to the Guledig that does not refuse.<br>
 Of looking at a heavy ode of sovereignty<br>
 In his life will not come the advantage of the grave.<br>
 They will not be satisfied with the gratification of their lives.<br>
 Harder the torment of a liberal course,<br>
 A multitude present beyond Prydain.<br>
 Thy excessive care of the too sprightly is corrupted.<br>
 Let it be corrupted. He shall be cut to pieces, he shall be judged.<br>
 20 He will judge all, the supreme man.<br>
 With his will as a judge; and let him be benefited,<br>
 Not the man that claims the mortuary.<br>
 A youth violent that regrets the milky food,<br>
 Like the herald of Gwallawg guiding on.<br>
 Of a forbearing aspect is the countenance of Gwallawg.<br>
 He inquires of no one what he has done.<br>
 Is he not my chief? Is there not sold to you<br>
 Thick mead in the end of summer?<br>
 There will not increase save six.<br>
 30 Sweeter to thee is conversation from elders.<br>
 Talkative is the privileged orator<br>
 Of king s ill the luxuriant circle of the good mead.<br>
 Like the sun, the warm animator of summer, let him sound the greatest song.<br>
 I will sing the wise song, the song of the host of harmony.<br>
 They will be, thou wilt be a Druid in summer time, the aspect of the son<br>
 Of Lleenawg, with a flowing manly robe.<br>
 Light, a robe of heat; vapour of heat, heat of vapour.<br>
 Whilst it rose it was contained without disgrace. <a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 340</font></a><br>
 A sword will destroy the swordsman's horse;<br>
 40 His host will not break me to theft,<br>
 The native country of a slave is not free to him,<br>
 They will perforate the fronts of shields before the fronts of horses.<br>
 From his steed of tumult, Morial shall appear before the host<br>
 Fiercely impassioned. They shall pledge the rich plains<br>
 From Caer Clud to Caer Caradawg,<br>
 The support of the land of Penprys and Gwallawg,<br>
 The king of the kings of tranquil aspect.</p>
