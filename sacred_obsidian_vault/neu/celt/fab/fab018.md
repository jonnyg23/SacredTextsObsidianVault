 <h3 align="CENTER">II.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE DEATH-SONG OF CORROI, SON OF DAYRY.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XLII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. THY large fountain fills the river,<br>
 Thy coming will make thy value of little worth,<br>
 The death-song of Corroy agitates me.<br>
 If the warrior will allure, rough his temper.<br>
 And his evil was greater than its renown was great,<br>
 To seize the son of Dayry, lord of the southern sea,<br>
 Celebrated was his praise before she was entrusted to him.</p>
 <p>II. Thy large fountain fills the stream.<br>
 Thy coming will cause saddling without haste,<br>
 The death-song of Corroi is with me now,<br>
 If (the warrior) will allure.</p>
 <p>III. Thy large fountain fills the deep.<br>
 Thy arrows traverse the strand, not frowning or depressed.<br>
 The warrior conquers, great his rank of soldiers,<br>
 And after penetrating enters towns<br>
 And . . . the pure stream was promptly whitened.<br>
 Whilst the victorious one in the morning heaps carnage;<br>
 Tales will be known to me from sky to earth,<br>
 Of the contention of Corroi and Cocholyn,<br>
 Numerous their tumults about their borders, <a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a><br>
 Springs the chief o'er the surrounding mead of the somewhat gentle wood.<br>
 A Caer there was, love-diffusing, not paling, not trembling.<br>
 Happy is he whose. soul is rewarded.</p>
