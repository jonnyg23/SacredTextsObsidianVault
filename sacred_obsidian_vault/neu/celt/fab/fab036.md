 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>AM I not with hosts making a din?<br>
 I would not cease, between two hosts, without gore.<br>
 Am I not he that is called Gorlassar?<br>
 My belt was a rainbow to my foe.<br>
 Am I not a prince, in darkness, <a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a><br>
 (To him) that takes my appearance with my two chief baskets?<br>
 Am I not, like Cawyl, ploughing?<br>
 I would not cease without gore between two hosts.<br>
 Is it not I that will defend my sanctuary?<br>
 10 In separating with the friends of wrath.<br>
 Have I not been accustomed to blood about the wrathful,<br>
 A sword-stroke daring against the sons of Cawrnur?<br>
 Have I not shared my cause.<br>
 A ninth portion in the prowess of Arthur?<br>
 Is it not I that have destroyed a hundred Caers?<br>
 Is it not I that slew a hundred governors?<br>
 Is it not I that have given a hundred veils?<br>
 Is it not I that cut off a hundred heads?<br>
 Is it not I that gave to Henpen<br>
 20 The tremendous sword of the enchanter?<br>
 Is it not I that performed the rights of purification,<br>
 When Hayarndor went to the top of the mountain?<br>
 I was bereaved to my sorrow. My confidence was commensurate.<br>
 There was not a world were it not for my progeny.<br>
 I am a bard to be praised. The unskilful<br>
 May he be possessed by the ravens and eagle and bird of wrath.<br>
 Avagddu came to him with his equal,<br>
 When the bands of four men feed between two plains,<br>
 Abiding in heaven was he, my desire,<br>
 30 Against the eagle, against the fear of the unskilful.<br>
 I am a bard, and I am a harper,<br>
 I am a piper, and I am a crowder.<br>
 Of seven score musicians the very great<br>
 Enchanter. There was of the enamelled honour the privilege,<br>
 Hu of the expanded wings. <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a><br>
 Thy son, thy barded proclamation,<br>
 Thy steward, of a gifted father.<br>
 MY tongue to recite my death-song.<br>
 If of stone-work the opposing wall of the world.<br>
 40 May the countenance of Prydain be bright for my guidance,<br>
 Sovereign of heaven, let my messages not be rejected.</p>
