 <h3 align="CENTER">BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN IV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>ACCORDING to the sacred ode of Cyridwen, the Ogyrven of various seeds,--<br>
 The various seeds of poetic harmony, the exalted speech of the graduated minstrel,<br>
 Cuhelyn the wise, of elegant Cymraec, an exalted possession,<br>
 Will skilfully sing; the right of Aedan, the lion, shall be heard.<br>
 A song of fulness, worthy of a chair, a powerful composition it is.<br>
 From suitors may he receive eulogy, and they presents from him; <a name="page_501"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 501</font></a><br>
 The bond of sovereigns, the subject of contests in harmonious song.<br>
 Splendid are his horses, hundreds respect him, the skilful seek the chieftain,<br>
 The circle of deliverance, the nation's refuge and a treasure of mutual reproach.<br>
 10 To banter with him, who is of a venerable form, I would devoutly desire;<br>
 A broad defence, like a ship to the suppliant, and a port to the minstrel,<br>
 Quick as lightning, a powerful native, a chief whose might is sharp;<br>
 A luminary of sense, much he knows, completely he accomplishes.<br>
 May the hero of the banquet, through peace, enforce tranquillity from this day.</p>
