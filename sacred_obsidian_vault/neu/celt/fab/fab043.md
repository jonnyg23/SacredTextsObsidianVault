 <h3 align="CENTER">XXVIII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IT broke out with matchless fury.<br>
 The rapid vehement fire.<br>
 Him we praise above the earth,<br>
 Fire, the fiery meteor of the dawn.<br>
 Above the high gale,<br>
 Higher than every cloud.<br>
 Great his animal.<br>
 He will not delay<br>
 Nor the wedding-feast of Llyr.<br>
 10. His path is like a water-course,<br>
 Thy rage in the chief streams.<br>
 The dawn smiles, repelling gloom,<br>
 At the dawn with violence,<br>
 At every meet season,<br>
 At the meet sea-son of his turnings,<br>
 At the four stages of his course,<br>
 I will extol him that judges violence,<br>
 Of the strong din, deep his wrath. <a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a><br>
 I am not a man, cowardly, gray,<br>
 20. A scum, near the wattle.<br>
 The illusion of my two relatives,<br>
 Two groans of affliction without appetite.<br>
 From my hand to thy hand God will give naught.<br>
 Thrice three protections,<br>
 Returning to the old places,<br>
 With a steed used to the field.<br>
 And the steed of Genethawg,<br>
 And the steed of Caradawg,<br>
 Perfect for travelling.<br>
 30. And the steed of Gwythur,<br>
 And the steed of Gwarddur,<br>
 And the steed of Arthur.<br>
 Dauntless to cause an ache,<br>
 And the steed of Taliessin,<br>
 And the steed of Lleu half domesticated,<br>
 And of Pebyr, the dark gray of the grove.<br>
 And Grei, the steed of Cunin.<br>
 Cornan stubborn in the conflict,<br>
 Of ardent desires,<br>
 40. The Black, from the seas famous,<br>
 The steed of Brwyn, betrayer of the country.<br>
 And the three cloven-footed ones<br>
 They will not go a journey conveniently,<br>
 The terrible steed of Ceidaw,<br>
 A hoof with bribery on it.<br>
 Mottle-shouldered Ysgodig<br>
 The steed of Llemenig<br>
 The horse of Rhydderch Rhyddig<br>
 Of the gray colour of a pear.<br>
 50. And Llamre, full of inherent vigour,<br>
 And Froenvoll of a vigorous growth,<br>
 The steed of Sadyrnin, <a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a><br>
 And the steed of Constantine.<br>
 And others handling,<br>
 For the country, the smart of foreigners.<br>
 The good Henwyn brought<br>
 A tale from Hiraddug.<br>
 I have been a sow, I have been a buck,<br>
 I have been a sage, I have been a snout,<br>
 60. I have been a horn, I have been a wild sow,<br>
 I have been a shout in battle.<br>
 I have been a torrent on the slope,<br>
 I have been a wave on the extended shore.<br>
 I have been the light sprinkling of a deluge,<br>
 I have been a cat with a speckled head on three trees.<br>
 I have been a circumference, I have been a head.<br>
 A goat on an elder-tree.<br>
 I have been a crane well filled, a sight to behold.<br>
 Very ardent the animals of Morial,<br>
 70. They kept a good stock.<br>
 Of what is below the air, say the hateful men,<br>
 Too many do not live, of those-that know me.</p>
