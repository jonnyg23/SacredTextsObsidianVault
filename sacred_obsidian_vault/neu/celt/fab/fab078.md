 <p>I. STAND forth, maidens, and survey the land<br>
 Of Cyndylan; Llys Pengwern, is it not in flames?<br>
 Woe to the youth that longs for good fellowship.</p>
 <p><a name="page_449"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 449</font></a></p>
 <p>II. One tree with the tendril on it<br>
 Is escaping it may be,<br>
 But what God shall have willed, let it come!</p>
 <p>III. Cyndylan, with heart like the ice of winter,<br>
 With thrust of wild boar through his head,<br>
 Thou hast dispensed the ale of Tren!</p>
 <p>IV. Cyndylan, with heart like the fire of spring,<br>
 By the common oath, in the midst of the common speech,<br>
 Defending Tren, that wasted town!</p>
 <p>V. Cyndylan, bright pillar of his country,<br>
 Chain-bearer, obstinate in fight,<br>
 Protected Tren, the town of his father!</p>
 <p>VI. Cyndylan, bright intelligence departed,<br>
 Chain-bearer, obstinate in the host,<br>
 Protected Tren as long as be was living.</p>
 <p>VII. Cyndylan, with heart of greyhound,<br>
 When he descended to the turmoil of battle,<br>
 A carnage he carved out.</p>
 <p>VIII. Cyndylan, with heart of hawk,<br>
 Was the true enraged<br>
 Cub of Cyndrwyn, the stubborn one.</p>
 <p>IX. Cyndylan, with heart of wild boar,<br>
 When he descended to the onset of battle,<br>
 There was carnage in two heaps.</p>
 <p>X. Cyndylan, hungry boar, ravager,<br>
 Lion, wolf fast holding of descent,<br>
 The wild boar will not give back the town of his father.</p>
 <p><a name="page_450"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 450</font></a></p>
 <p>XI. Cyndylan! while towards thee fled<br>
 His heart, it was a great festival<br>
 With him, like the press of the battle!</p>
 <p>XII. Cyndylan of Powys purple gallant is he!<br>
 The strangers' refuge, their life's anchor,<br>
 Cub of Cyndrwyn, much to be lamented!</p>
 <p>XIII. Cyndylan, fair son of Cyndrwyn,<br>
 No fitting garb is the beard about the nose,<br>
 Will a man be no better than a maid?</p>
 <p>XIV. Cyndylan! a cause of grief thou art<br>
 Set forward will not be the array,<br>
 Around the pressure of the covert of thy shield!</p>
 <p>XV. Cyndylan, keep thou the slope<br>
 Till the Lloegrians come to-day,<br>
 Anxiety on account of one is not fitting.</p>
 <p>XVI. Cyndylan, keep thou the top<br>
 Till the Lloegrians come through Tren,<br>
 'Tis not called a wood for one tree!</p>
 <p>XVII. My heart has great misery<br>
 In joining together the black boards,<br>
 Fair is the flesh of Cyndylan, the common grief of a hundred hosts!</p>
 <p>XVIII. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<br>
 To-night, without fire, without bed!<br>
 I'll weep a while, afterwards I shall be silent.</p>
 <p><a name="page_451"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 451</font></a></p>
 <p>XIX. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<br>
 To-night, without fire, without candle!<br>
 Except God, who will give me patience?</p>
 <p>XX. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<br>
 To-night, without fire, without light,<br>
 Let there come spreading silence around thee!</p>
 <p>XXI. The Hall of Cyndylan! dark<br>
 Its roof, after the fair assemblage!<br>
 Alas, it makes not well its end!</p>
 <p>XXII. The Hall of Cyndylan! art thou not<br>
 Without seemliness? in the grave is thy shield!<br>
 As long as he was living there was no break in the shingle.</p>
 <p>XXII. The Hall of Cyndylan is forlorn<br>
 To-night, since there has been no one owning it,<br>
 Ah! death will not leave me long!</p>
 <p>XXIV. The Hall of Cyndylan is not pleasant<br>
 To-night, on the top of Carrec Hytwyth,<br>
 Without lord, without company, without feast!</p>
 <p>XXV. The Hall of Cyndylan is gloomy<br>
 To-night, without fire, without songs--<br>
 Tears are the trouble of my cheeks!</p>
 <p>xxvi. The Hall of Cyndylan is gloomy<br>
 To-night, without family,<br>
     *         *         *         *         *</p>
 <p><a name="page_452"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 452</font></a></p>
 <p>XXVII. The Hall of Cyndylan pierces me<br>
 To see it, without roof, without fire.<br>
 Dead is my chief, myself alive!</p>
 <p>XXVIII. The Hall of Cyndylan lies waste<br>
 To-night, after warriors contended,<br>
 Elvan, Cyndylan Caeawc!</p>
 <p>XXIX. The Hall of Cyndylan is piercing cold<br>
 To-night, after the honour that befel me.<br>
 Without the men, without the women it sheltered.</p>
 <p>XXX. The Hall of Cyndylan is still<br>
 To-night, after losing its elder.<br>
 The great merciful God! what shall I do?</p>
 <p>XXXI. The Hall of Cyndylan! dark is its roof<br>
 Since the destruction by the Loegrians<br>
 Cyndylan and Elvan of Powys.</p>
 <p>XXXII. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<br>
 To-night, of the children of Cyndrwyn,<br>
 Cynon and Gwiawn and Gwyn.</p>
 <p>XXXIII. The Hall of Cyndylan pierces me<br>
 Every hour, after the great gathering din at the fire<br>
 Which I saw at thy fire-hearth!</p>
 <p>XXXIV. The eagle of Eli, loud his cry:<br>
 He has swallowed fresh drink,<br>
 Heart-blood of Cyndylan fair!</p>
 <p>XXXV. The eagle of Eli screams aloud<br>
 To-night, in the blood of fair men he wallows!<br>
 He is in the wood, a heavy grief to me!</p>
 <p><a name="page_453"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 453</font></a></p>
 <p>XXXVI. The eagle of Eli I bear<br>
 To-night, bloody is he, I defy not,<br>
 He is in the wood, a heavy grief to me!</p>
 <p>XXXVII. The eagle of Eli, let him afflict<br>
 To-night the vale of illustrious Meissir,<br>
 Brochwael's land, long let him affront it!</p>

 Very loud his echoing voice,<br>
 Eager for the flesh.</p>

 Eager for the. flesh of him I love!</p>

 Truly will Tren be called the ruined town!</p>
 <p>XLIV. The eagle of Pengwern! from afar let him call<br>
 To-night, for the blood of men let him look out,<br>
 Truly will Tren be called the town of flame!</p>
 <p><a name="page_454"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 454</font></a></p>
 <p>XLV. The churches of Bassa! there rests<br>
 To-night, there ends, there shrinks within himself,<br>
 The shelter in battle, heart of the men of Argoed!</p>
 <p>XLVI. The churches of Bassa are enriched<br>
 To-night, my tongue hath done it!<br>
 Ruddy are they, overflowing my grief!</p>
 <p>XLVII. The churches of Bassa are close neighbouring<br>
 To-night to the heir of Cyndrwyn,<br>
 Graveyard of Cyndylan fair!</p>
 <p>XLVIII. The churches of Bassa are lovely<br>
 To-night, their clover hath made them so,<br>
 Ruddy are they, overflowing my heart!</p>
 <p>XLIX. The churches of Bassa have lost their privilege<br>
 Since the destruction by the Lloegrians<br>
 Of Cyndylan and Elvan of Powys.</p>
 <p>L. The churches of Bassa are to make an end<br>
 To-night; the warriors are not to continue.<br>
 He knows who knoweth all things, and I here know.</p>
 <p>LI. The churches of Bassa are still<br>
 To-night, and I am to cry!<br>
 Ruddy are they, overflowing is my lament.</p>
 <p>LII. The White Town in the bosom of the wood!<br>
 There has ever been of its lustyhood,<br>
 On the surface of the grass, the blood!</p>
 <p><a name="page_455"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 455</font></a></p>
 <p>LIII. The White Town in the country side!<br>
 Its lustyhood, its gray thoughtfulness,<br>
 The blood under the feet of its warriors!</p>
 <p>LIV. The White Town in the valley!<br>
 Joyful its troop with the common spoil<br>
 Of battle, its people, are they not gone?</p>
 <p>LV. The White Town between Tren and Trodwyd!<br>
 More common was the broken shield<br>
 Coming from battle than the evening ox.</p>
 <p>LVI. The White Town between Tren and Traval.<br>
 More common was the blood<br>
 On the surface of the grass than the ploughed fallow.</p>
 <p>LVII. Alas, Ffreuer! how sad is it<br>
 To-night, after the loss of kindred.<br>
 By the mishap of my tongue were they slain.</p>
 <p>LVIII. Alas, Ffreuer! how languid she is<br>
 To-night, after the death of Elvan,<br>
 And the eagle of Cyndrwyn, Cyndylan.</p>
 <p>LIX. It is not the death of Ffreuer that separates me<br>
 To-night from the enjoyment of the social circle.<br>
 I will keep awake, I will early weep.</p>
 <p>LX. It is not the death of Ffreuer that pierces me with pain.<br>
 From the beginning of night till midnight<br>
 I will keep awake, I will weep with the dawn.</p>
 <p>LXI. It is not the death of Ffreuer that stares me<br>
 To-night, and causes my checks to be yellow,<br>
 And the red tears to flow over the bedside.</p>
 <p><a name="page_456"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 456</font></a></p>
 <p>LXII. It is not the death of Ffreuer that I am tormented with<br>
 To-night, but myself, being feebly sick,<br>
 My brothers and my country I mourn.</p>
 <p>LXIII. Fair Ffreuer! there are brothers who cherish thee,<br>
 And who have not sprung from the ungenerous;<br>
 They are men who cherish no timidity.</p>
 <p>LXIV. Fair Ffreuer! to thee have been brothers;<br>
 When they heard the meeting of armies<br>
 Their confidence would not fail them.</p>
 <p>LXV. I and Ffreuer and Medlan,<br>
 While there may be battle in every place,<br>
 Are not concerned if our side be not slain.</p>
 <p>LXVI. The mountain, were it still higher<br>
 I will not covet, there to lead my life.<br>
 Light of valuable things is my clothing.</p>
 <p>LXVII. Parallel with the Avaerwy,<br>
 The Tren enters the Trydonwy,<br>
 And the Twrch falls into the Marchnwy.</p>
 <p>LXVIII. Parallel with the Elwydden,<br>
 The Trydonwy flows into the Tren,<br>
 And the Geirw flows into the Alwen.</p>
 <p>LXIX. Before my covering was made of the hide<br>
 Of the hardy goat, intent I was on carnage;<br>
 I was made drunk with the mead of Bryum.</p>
 <p><a name="page_467"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 467</font></a></p>
 <p>LXX. Before my covering was made of the hide<br>
 Of the hardy goat, the young goat to the holly,<br>
 I was made drunk with the mead of Tren.</p>
 <p>LXXI. After my brethren from the region of the Hafren,<br>
 And about the two banks of the Dwyryw,<br>
 Woe is me, God, that I am alive!</p>
 <p>LXXII. After well-trained horses and garments of ruddy hue,<br>
 And the waving yellow plumes,<br>
 Slender is my leg, a covering is not left me.</p>
 <p>LXXIII. The cattle of Edeyrniawn went not astray,<br>
 And with none did they go away,<br>
 In the lifetime of Gorwynion, a man of Uchnant.</p>
 <p>LXXIV. The cattle of Edeyrniawn went not astray,<br>
 And with none did they wander,<br>
 In the lifetime of Gowrynion, a man    .    .    .<br>
 Reproach is known to the herdsman.<br>
 The price is shame and refusal.<br>
 On such as come to disgrace it will befall.<br>
 I know what is good,<br>
 The blood of one hero for another.</p>
 <p>LXXV. Were it the wife of Gyrthmwl, she would be languid<br>
 This day; loud would be her scream;<br>
 She would deplore the loss of her heroes.</p>
 <p>LXXVI. The soil of Ercal is on courageous men,<br>
 On the progeny of Moryal,<br>
 And after Rys great lamentation.</p>
 <p><a name="page_458"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 458</font></a></p>
 <p>LXXVII. The hawk of Heledd calls unto me<br>
 "O God! why is it that to thee have been given<br>
 The horses of my country and their land?</p>
 <p>LXXVIII. The hawk of Heledd will greet me<br>
 "O God I why is it that to thee are given the dark coloured harness<br>
 Of Cyndylan and his forty horses?"</p>
 <p>LXXIX. Have I not gazed with my eyes on pleasant land<br>
 From the conspicuous seat of Gorwynion?<br>
 Long the course of the run, longer my recollection.</p>
 <p>LXXX Have I not gazed from Dinlle<br>
 Wrecon on the patrimony of Ffreuer,<br>
 With grief for its social enjoyment?</p>
 <p>LXXXI. A horseman from a Caer below,<br>
 He was slow in his complaints.<br>
 A man of Sannair--</p>
 <p>LXXXII. Slain were my brothers all at once--<br>
 Cynan, Cyndylan, Cynwraith--<br>
 In defending Tren, a town laid waste.</p>
 <p>LXXXIII. A tribe would not tread on the nest<br>
 Of Cynddylan; he would never flinch a foot;<br>
 His mother nursed no weakling son.</p>
 <p>LXXXIV. Brethren I have had who never were dejected,<br>
 Who grew up like hazel saplings;<br>
 One by one, they are all gone.</p>
 <p><a name="page_459"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 459</font></a></p>
 <p>LXXXV. Brethren I have had whom God has taken<br>
 From me; my misfortune caused it.<br>
 They would not purchase glory by false means.</p>
 <p>LXXXVI. Thin the gale, thick the rumour,.<br>
 Sweet the furrows; thou that made them remain not;<br>
 Those who have been are no more.</p>
 <p>LXXXVII. What is heard by God and man,<br>
 What is heard by young and old,<br>
 Disgrace of beards, let the flier loose.</p>
 <p>LXXXVIII. While it lives the flier will fly<br>
 With garments waiting for the battlefield,<br>
 And with blue blades the chief was enlivened.</p>
 <p>LXXXIX. I wonder the bright fort is no more<br>
 After its defenders notoriously skilful<br>
 In the lair of the boar there is breaking of pignuts.</p>
 <p>XC. They are neither mist nor smoke,<br>
 Nor warriors in mutual defence.<br>
 In a meadow slaughter is bad.</p>
 <p>XCI. I listened in the meadow to the clatter of shields.<br>
 A fortress is no restraint to the mighty,<br>
 The best of men, Caranmael.</p>
 <p>XCII. Caranmael, pressure there is on thee;<br>
 I know thy retreat from battle.<br>
 A mark is wont on the brow of a combatant.</p>
 <p>XCIII. Accustomed to exert a liberal hand,<br>
 The son of Cyndylan, retainer of praise,<br>
 The last man of Cyndrwyn, Caranmael.</p>
 <p><a name="page_460"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 460</font></a></p>
 <p>XCIV. Devoid of zeal was he,<br>
 And his patrimony was sequestrated,<br>
 Who sought Caranmael for a judge.</p>
 <p>XCV. Caranmael, intimate with exertion,<br>
 Son of Cyndylan of ready fame,<br>
 Was not a judge, though he would wist to be.</p>
 <p>XCVI. Where Caranmael put on the corselet of Cyndylan,<br>
 And pushed forward his ashen spear,<br>
 A Frank should not deprive him of his head.</p>
 <p>XCVII. The time when I fared on rich viands<br>
 I would not lift my thigh<br>
 For a man that complained of a sore disease.</p>
 <p>XCVIII. Brothers I also have had<br>
 That would not complain of pestilential diseases:<br>
 One was Elvan, Cyndylan another.</p>
 <p>XCIX. Hair is not gracefully worn, is it not becoming<br>
 A man in the heat of conflict?<br>
 My brethren were not clamorous.</p>
 <p>C. But for death and its fearful afflictions,<br>
 And the pang of the blue blades,<br>
 I will not be clamorous either.</p>
 <p>CI. The plain of Maodyn, is it not covered with frost?<br>
 Since the destruction of him who was of benevolent purpose<br>
 On the grave of Eirinwed thick the snow.</p>
 <p><a name="page_461"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 461</font></a></p>
 <p>CII. The mound of Elwyddan, is it not drenched with rain,<br>
 And the plain of Maodyn below it?<br>
 Cynon ought to deplore him.</p>
 <p>CIII. Four equal brothers to me have been,<br>
 And each was the head of a family.<br>
 Tren knows to itself no owner.</p>
 <p>CIV. Four equal brothers to me have been,<br>
 And to each chief there was vigour.<br>
 Tren knows no congenial owner.</p>
 <p>CV. Four equal courageous and comely<br>
 Brothers to me have been from Cyndrwyn.<br>
 There is not to Tren the possession of enjoyment.</p>
 <p>CVI. Fly thee hence, and array thyself<br>
 Thou art not wont to rise with the dawn.<br>
 Am I not wounded by a spike from the comer of thy bag?</p>
 <p>CVII. Fly thee hence and hide thyself<br>
 Thou art not of sinless conversation..<br>
 Prostration is useless, thy creeping will cause a noise.</p>
