 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>THE lion will be most implacable;<br>
 I will not deplore him.<br>
 Urien I will approach,<br>
 To him I will sing.<br>
 When will come my surety,<br>
 I shall obtain admission.<br>
 Of the very best part,<br>
 Under the flow of melody,<br>
 It concerns me not much,<br>
 10 The everlasting lineage which I see.<br>
 I will not go to them, I will not be with them.<br>
 I will not address the North<br>
 And the kings of the plain.<br>
 Though there should be for many<br>
 That I should see a mutual pledging.<br>
 I have no need of affection:<br>
 Urien will not refuse me<br>
 The lands of Llwyvenydd.<br>
 Mine is their wealth,<br>
 20 Mine are the festivals,<br>
 Mine is the produce,<br>
 Mine are the metals,<br>
 And its rich productions.<br>
 Mead out of buffalo-horns<br>
 And good in abundance,<br>
 From the best prince,<br>
 The most generous that has been heard of. <a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a><br>
 The chiefs of every language<br>
 To thee are all captive.<br>
 30 For thee there will be lamentation when thy death is certain.<br>
 Though I should have preferred him<br>
 After being benefited, I would grow old.<br>
 There was not one that I loved better,<br>
 (Of those) that I knew before.<br>
 At times I see<br>
 The amount of what I shall have.<br>
 Except to God supreme,<br>
 I will not renounce<br>
 Thy royal sons,<br>
 40 The most generous of men,<br>
 Their spears shall resound<br>
 In the land of their enemies.<br>
 And until I fail in old age,<br>
 In the sore necessity of death,<br>
 May I not be smiling,<br>
 If I praise not Urien.</p>
