 <h3 align="CENTER">XXXVIII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXI.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>THE men of Catraeth arose with the dawn,<br>
 About the Guledig, of work a profitable merchant.<br>
 This Urien, without mockery is his regret.<br>
 He sustains the sovereignty and its demands.<br>
 Warlike, the grandeur of a perfect prince of baptism.<br>
 The men of Prydain hurtful in battle array,<br>
 At Gwenystrad, continuously offerers of battle.<br>
 Protected neither the field nor woods<br>
 The people with shelter, when tribulation comes.<br>
 10 Like the wave loud roaring over the beach,<br>
 I saw valiant men in battle array,<br>
 And after the morning, battle-mangled flesh.<br>
 I saw a tumult of three limits slain,<br>
 A shout active in front was heard.<br>
 In defending Gwenystrad was seen<br>
 A mound and slanting ground obstructing.<br>
 In the pass of the ford I saw men gory-tinted,<br>
 Dropping their arms before the pallid miserable ones.<br>
 They join in peace as they were losers. <a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 344</font></a><br>
 20 Hand on the cross they wail on the gravel bank of Garanwynyon.<br>
 The tribes revel over the rising wave.<br>
 The billows protect the hair of their captures.<br>
 I saw men of splendid progress<br>
 With blood that clotted on the garments,<br>
 Toiling energetically and incessantly in battle.<br>
 The covering battle, where there was no flight, when contrived.<br>
 The ruler of Reged, I am astonished at what was dared.<br>
 I saw a brow covered with rage on Urien,<br>
 When he furiously attacked his foes at the white stone<br>
 30 Of Galystem. His rage was a blade;<br>
 The bucklered men were sustained in need.<br>
 May a desire of battle come on Euirwyn.<br>
 And until I fail in old age,<br>
 In the sore necessity of death,<br>
 May I not be smiling,<br>
 If I praise not Urien.</p>
