 <h3 align="CENTER">XLVIII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE DEATH-SONG OF OWAIN.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XLIV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">Text, vol. ii. p. 199. Notes, vol. ii. p. 417.</p>
 <p>THE soul of Owain son of Urien. May its Lord consider its need.<br>
 The chief of Reged, the heavy sward conceals him. His knowledge was not shallow.<br>
 A low cell (contains) the renowned protector of bards, the wings of dawn were the flowing of his lances.<br>
 For there will not be found a match for the chief of the glittering west.<br>
 The reaper of the tenacious foes. The offspring of his father and grandfather.<br>
 When Flamdwyn killed Owain, there was not one greater than he sleeping. <a name="page_367"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 367</font></a><br>
 A wide number of Lloegyr went to sleep with light in their eyes.<br>
 And those that fled not instantly were beyond necessity.<br>
 Owain valiantly chastised them, like a pack (of wolves) pursuing sheep.<br>
 10 A worthy man, upon his many-coloured trappings, he would give horses to those that asked.<br>
 While he hoarded hard money, it was not shared for his soul.<br>
 The soul of Owain, son of Urien.</p>
