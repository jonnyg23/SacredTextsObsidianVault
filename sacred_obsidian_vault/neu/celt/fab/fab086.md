 <p>A DREAM I happen to see last night; clever is he that can interpret it.<br>
 It shall not be related to the wanton; he that will not conceal it shall know it not.<br>
 It is an act of the gentle to govern the multitude. Pleasure is not the wealth of a country.<br>
 Have I not been under the same covering with a fair maid of the hue of the billow of the strand?<br>
 Labour bestowed on anything good is no pain, and the remembrance of it will last.<br>
 Worse is my trouble to answer him who is not acquainted with it.<br>
 It is no reparation for an evil deed, a desistence after it is done.<br>
 One's benefit does not appear when it is asked for in a round about way: thou hadst better keep to what there is. <a name="page_498"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 498</font></a><br>
 And associate with the virtuous, and be resolute as to what may happen.<br>
 10 He that frequently commits crime will at last be caught.<br>
 He that will not relate a thing fully, will not find himself contradicted.<br>
 Riches will not flourish with the wicked. Mass will not be sung on a retreat.<br>
 A sigh is no protection against the vile. He that is not liberal does not deserve the name.<br>
