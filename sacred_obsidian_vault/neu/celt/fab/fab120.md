 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>HE was dexterous that fairly ruled over a country,<br>
 He was most generous, with most beautiful queens,<br>
 He was a violent poison of woe to his fellow-countrymen.<br>
 He broke upon Darius three times in battle.<br>
 And he will not be a dwarf shrub in the country of the plumed Darius.<br>
 Strenuous, far he conquered, the wood-pushing overtook<br>
 Alexander; in the golden fetters of woe he is imprisoned.<br>
 He was not long imprisoned; death came.<br>
 And where he had moving of armies,<br>
 10 No one before him was exalted,<br>
 To go to the grave, rich and prosperous, from the pleasure,<br>
 The generous Alexander took him there.<br>
 The land of Syr and Siryol, and the land of Syria,<br>
 And the land of Dinifdra, and land of Dinitra;<br>
 The land of Persia and Mersia, and the land of Canna;<br>
 And the isles of Pleth and Pletheppa;<br>
 And the state of Babilon and Agascia<br>
 Great, and the land of Galldarus, little its good.<br>
 Until the earth produced, sod was there.<br>
 20 And they do their wills by hunting them.<br>
 They render hostages to Europa. <a name="page_567"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 567</font></a><br>
 And plunder the countries of the peoples of the earth.<br>
 Furiously they pierce women, they impel here,<br>
 Before the burned ones there was a devastation of modesty,<br>
 Of battles when the sorrow was mentioned.<br>
 They satisfy the ravens, they make a head of confused running,<br>
 The soldiers of the possessor of multitudes, when they are mentioned.<br>
 Nor a country to thy young men, when it is destroyed,<br>
 There will not be for thy riddance, a riddance of burthen.<br>
 30 From the care of the fetter and its hardship.<br>
 A hundred thousand of the army died from thirst:<br>
 False their plans with their thousands.<br>
 Was poisoned his youth before he came home.<br>
 Before this, it would have been better to have been satisfied.<br>
 To my lord land-prospering, a country glorious,<br>
 One country may the Lord, the best region connect.<br>
 May I reform, may I be satisfied. Be with thee the fulness,<br>
 And as many as hear me, be mine their unity.<br>
 May they satisfy the will of God before the clothing of the sod.</p>
