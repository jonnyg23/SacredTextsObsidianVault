 <p>I. ON a fine night Pen Gethin heard the shout of a host,<br>
 When he took a long leap;<br>
 Unless the ground be guarded he will not cease.</p>
 <p>II. Since Coegawg is so rich as this in gold,<br>
 Close to the court of Gwallawg<br>
 I also shall be wealthy.</p>
 <p>III. Accursed be the tree<br>
 Which pulled out his eye in his presence,<br>
 Gwallawg ab Lleenawg, the ruler.</p>
 <p>IV. Accursed be the black tree<br>
 That pulled out his eye from its place,<br>
 Gwallawg ab Lleenawg, the chief of armies.</p>
 <p>V. Accursed be the white tree<br>
 That pulled out his eye from his head,<br>
 Gwallawg ab Lleenawg, the sovereign.</p>
 <p>VI. Accursed be the green tree<br>
 That pulled out his eye when a youth,<br>
 Gwallawg ab Lleenawg, the honourable. <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 No one that was eminent went<br>
 In the way that Gwallawg did,<br>
 With his steel into the meadow.</p>
 <p>No one that was honourable went<br>
 In the way that Meurig did,<br>
 With a bandage to the woman in three folds.</p>
