 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>A BARD there is here, who has not sung, what he shall have to sing;<br>
 Lot him sing; when he shall have finished,<br>
 An astrologer then he may be.<br>
 The generous ones refuse me.<br>
 There will not be one that will give.<br>
 Through the language of Taliessin,<br>
 It was a bright day<br>
 When Kian did<br>
 Praise the multitude.<br>
 10 There will be a slaughter, let there be the speech of Avagddu.<br>
 But if he ingeniously brings<br>
 The requisites forward,<br>
 Gwiawn will declare,<br>
 O the deep that will come<br>
 He would make the dead alive,<br>
 And destitute of wealth he is.<br>
 They will not make their cauldrons, <a name="page_526"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 526</font></a><br>
 That will boil without fire.<br>
 They will make their metals<br>
 20 In age of ages.<br>
 Thy pace that bears thee<br>
 From the deep of panegyric,<br>
 Is it not the hostile confederacy?<br>
 What its custom?<br>
 So much of national song<br>
 Your tongue has given.<br>
 Why will ye not recite an oration<br>
 Of blessing over the liquor of brightness?<br>
 The theme of every one's rhapsody.<br>
 30 I shall be there according to custom,<br>
 He was a profound judge.<br>
 He came after his periodical custom,<br>
 The third of the equal judges.<br>
 Three score years<br>
 I have supported an earthly scene,<br>
 In the water of law and the multitude.<br>
 In the element of lands.<br>
 A hundred servants surrounded,<br>
 A hundred kings made vows.<br>
 40 A hundred they are that went,<br>
 A hundred they are that came.<br>
 A hundred minstrels sang,<br>
 And he foretold of them.<br>
 Lladdon, the daughter of the stream,<br>
 Little was her desire<br>
 For gold and silver,<br>
 Who is the living one that left her?<br>
 Blood on the breast;<br>
 He will probably be spoken of,<br>
 50 He will be greatly praised.<br>
 I am Taliessin, <br>
 I will delineate the true lineage<br>
 Continuing until the end,<br>
 In the pattern of Elphin,<br>
 Is not the tribute<br>
 Of counted gold a debt?<br>
 When is hated and not loved,<br>
 Perjury and treason,<br>
 I desire not advantage,<br>
 60 Through the fluctuation of our song.<br>
 The brother that freely greets,<br>
 From me no one shall know.<br>
 The wise man of the primary science,<br>
 The astrologer reasoned,<br>
 About wrath, about the resolvent,<br>
 About the man describing windings.<br>
 About men well versed in praise.<br>
 Let us proceed, God it is,<br>
 Through the language of Talhaearn,<br>
 70 Baptism was the day of judgment,<br>
 That judged the characteristics<br>
 Of the force of poetry.<br>
 He and his virtue gave<br>
 Inspiration without mediocrity,<br>
 Seven score Ogyrven<br>
 Are in the Awen.<br>
 Eight score, of every score it will be one.<br>
 In the deep it will cease from ire;<br>
 In the deep it will be excessively angry;<br>
 80 In the deep, below the earth;<br>
 In the sky, above the earth.<br>
 There is one that knows<br>
 What sadness is,<br>
 Better than joy.<br>
 I know the law of the graces of <a name="page_528"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 528</font></a><br>
 The Awen, when it flows,<br>
 Concerning skilful payments,<br>
 Concerning happy days,<br>
 Concerning a tranquil life,<br>
 90 Concerning the protection of ages.<br>
 Concerning what beseems kings; how long their consolation.<br>
 Concerning similar things, that are on the face of the earth.<br>
 Magnificent astronomy, when communicated,<br>
 Sees all that is high.<br>
 When the mind is active,<br>
 When the sea is pleasant,<br>
 When the race is valiant,<br>
 When the high one is supplicated,<br>
 Or the sun when it is given,<br>
 100 When it covers the land.<br>
 Covering land of what extent?<br>
 When was drawn the bird of wrath,<br>
 The bird of wrath when it was drawn.<br>
 When the earth is green.<br>
 Who chaunted songs?<br>
 Songs who chaunted?<br>
 If true, who has considered them?<br>
 It has been considered in books,<br>
 110 How many winds, how many streams,<br>
 How many streams, how many winds.<br>
 How many rivers in their courses,<br>
 How many rivers there are.<br>
 The earth, what its breadth;<br>
 Or what its thickness.<br>
 I know the noise of the blades,<br>
 Crimson on all sides, about the floor.<br>
 I know the regulator, <a name="page_529"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 529</font></a><br>
 Between heaven and earth;<br>
 120 When an opposite hill is echoing,<br>
 When devastation urges onward,<br>
 When the silvery (vault) is shining,<br>
 When the dell shall be gloomy.<br>
 The breath when it is black,<br>
 When is best that has been.<br>
 A cow, when it is horned,<br>
 A wife, when she is lovely,<br>
 Milk, when it is white,<br>
 When the holly is green,<br>
 130 When is bearded the kid<br>
 In the multitude of fields,<br>
 When it is bearded,<br>
 When the cow-parsnip is created,<br>
 When is revolving the wheel,<br>
 When the mallet is flat,<br>
 When is spotted the little roebuck,<br>
 When the salt is brine,<br>
 Ale, when it is of an active quality.<br>
 When is of purplish hue the alder.<br>
 140 When is green the linnet,<br>
 When are red the hips,<br>
 Or a woman when restless,<br>
 When the night comes on.<br>
 What reserve there is in the hour of flowing,<br>
 No one knows whence the bosom of the sun is made ruddy.<br>
 A stain on a new garment,<br>
 It is difficult to remove it.<br>
 The string of a harp, why it complains,<br>
 The cuckoo, why it complains, why it sings.<br>
 150 Why keepeth the agreeable,<br>
 Why have led the camp <a name="page_530"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 530</font></a><br>
 Gereint and Arman.<br>
 What brings out the sparkle<br>
 From bard working of the stones.<br>
 When is sweet-smelling the goat's-beard plant;<br>
 When the crows are of a waxen line.<br>
 Talhayarn is<br>
 The greatest astronomer.<br>
 What is the imagination of trees.<br>
 160 From the muse the agreement of a day.<br>
 I know good and evil.<br>
     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 The bowl of whom has flowed,<br>
 What dawn has finished,<br>
 Who preached,<br>
 Eli and Eneas:<br>
 I know the cuckoos of summer,<br>
 (Where) they will be in the winter.<br>
 170 The Awen I sing,<br>
 From the deep I bring it,<br>
 A river while it flows,<br>
 I know its extent;<br>
 I know when it disappears;<br>
 I know when it fills;<br>
 I know when it overflows;<br>
 I know when it shrinks;<br>
 I know what base<br>
 There is beneath the sea.<br>
 180 I know their equivalent,<br>
 Every one in its retinue;<br>
 How many were heard in a day,<br>
 How many days in a year.<br>
 How many shafts in a battle,<br>
 How many drops in a shower. <a name="page_531"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 531</font></a><br>
 Mildly he divided them.<br>
 A greater mockery, the partial stirring up of disgrace,<br>
 The vicious muse of Gwydyon.<br>
 I know the one,<br>
 190 That filled the river,<br>
 On the people of Pharaoh.<br>
 Who brought the windings<br>
 Of present reasons.<br>
 What was the active patience,<br>
 When heaven was upreared.<br>
 What was a sail-staff<br>
 From earth to sky.<br>
 How many fingers about the cauldron,<br>
 About one, about the hand,<br>
 200 What name the two words<br>
 Will not deliver in one cauldron.<br>
 When the sea is turning round,<br>
 When black are the fish.<br>
 Marine food shall be their flesh,<br>
 Until it is transformed,<br>
 When fish shall contain it.<br>
 When the foot of the white swan is black,<br>
 Four-sided the sharp spear.<br>
 The tribe of heaven will not put down.<br>
 210 Which are the four elements.<br>
 Their end is not known.<br>
 What pigs, or what wandering of stags.<br>
 I salute thee, Bard of the border.<br>
 May he increase thee, (whose) bones (are of) mist<br>
 (Where) two cataracts of wind fall.<br>
 My mind has been expressed<br>
 In Hebrew, in Hebraic.<br>
 In Hebraic, in Hebrew,<br>
 Laudatu Laudate Jesu. <a name="page_532"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 532</font></a><br>
 220 A second time was I formed.<br>
 I have been a blue salmon.<br>
 I have been a dog; I have been a stag;<br>
 I have been a roebuck on the mountain.<br>
 I have been a stock, I have been a spade;<br>
 I have been an axe in the hand;<br>
 I have been a pin in a forceps,<br>
 A year and a half;<br>
 I have been a speckled white cock<br>
 Upon hens in Eiddyn.<br>
 230 I have been a stallion over a stud.<br>
 I have been a violent bull,<br>
 I have been a buck of yellow hue,<br>
 As it is feeding.<br>
 I have been a grain discovered,<br>
 Which grew on a hill.<br>
 He that reaped me placed me,<br>
 Into a smoke-hole driving me.<br>
 Exerting of the hand,<br>
 In afflicting me,<br>
 240 A hen received me,<br>
 With ruddy claws, (and) parting comb.<br>
 I rested nine nights.<br>
 In her womb a child,<br>
 I have been matured,<br>
 I have been an offering before the Guledig,<br>
 I have been dead, I have been alive.<br>
 A branch there was to me of ivy,<br>
 I have been a convoy,<br>
 Before God I have been poor.<br>
 250 Again advised me the cherisher<br>
 With ruddy claws; of what she gave me<br>
 Scarcely can be recounted;<br>
 Greatly will it be praised. <a name="page_533"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 533</font></a><br>
 I am Taliessin,<br>
 I will delineate the true lineage,<br>
 That will continue to the end,<br>
 In the pattern of Elphin.</p>
