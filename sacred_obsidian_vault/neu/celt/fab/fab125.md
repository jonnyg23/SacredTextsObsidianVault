 <p>1. ENTANGLING is the snare, clustered is the ash;<br>
 The ducks are in the pond; white breaks the wave;<br>
 More powerful than a hundred is the counsel of the heart.</p>
 <p>II. Long the night, boisterous is the sea-shore;<br>
 Usual a tumult in a congregation;<br>
 The vicious will not agree with the good.</p>
 <p>III. Long the night, boisterous is the mountain,<br>
 The wind whistles over the tops of trees;<br>
 Ill-nature will not deceive the discreet.</p>

 <p>IV. The saplings of the green-topped birch<br>
 Will extricate my foot from the shackle;<br>
 Disclose not thy secret to a youth.</p>
 <p>V. The saplings of oaks in the grove<br>
 Will extricate my foot from the chain;<br>
 Disclose no secret to a maid.</p>
 <p>VI. The saplings of the leafy oaks<br>
 Will extricate my foot from the prison;<br>
 Divulge no secret to a babbler.</p>
 <p>VII. The saplings of bramble have berries on them;<br>
 The thrush is on her nest;<br>
 And the liar will never be silent.</p>
 <p>VIII. Rain without, the fern is drenched;<br>
 White the gravel of the sea; there is spray on the margin;<br>
 Reason is the fairest lamp for man.</p>
 <p>IX. Rain without, near is the shelter,<br>
 The furze yellow; the cow-parsnip withered and dry;<br>
 God the Creator! why hast thou made a coward?</p>
 <p>X. Rain without, my hair is drenched;<br>
 Full of complaint is the feeble; steep the cliff;<br>
 Pale white is the sea; salt is the brine.</p>
 <p>XI. Rain without, the ocean is drenched;<br>
 The wind whistles over the tops of the reeds;<br>
 After every feat, still without the genius.</p>
