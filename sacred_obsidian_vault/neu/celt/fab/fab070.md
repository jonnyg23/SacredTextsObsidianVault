 <p align="CENTER">I.</p>
 <p>THE qualities shall be extolled<br>
 Of the man that. chained the. wind.<br>
 When his powers come,<br>
 Extremely noisy the elements;<br>
 For ever will thy impulse be,<br>
 Thou dost pervade<br>
 The tide of darkness and day.<br>
 The day, there will be a shelter to me,<br>
 The night, it will be rested. <a name="page_428"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 428</font></a><br>
 10 Softness is praised.<br>
 From a great Guledig.<br>
 The great God caused<br>
 The sun of summer, and its excessive heat;<br>
 And he caused<br>
 The abundance of the wood and field.<br>
 He is the powerful cause of the stream,<br>
 Flowing abundantly.<br>
 He is the powerful cause of every kindness;<br>
 God redeemed me<br>
 20 And before they come,<br>
 The people of the world to the one hill,<br>
 They will not be able to do the least,<br>
 Without the power of the King.<br>
 He shall steep it in the Llyn,<br>
 Until it shall sprout.<br>
 He shall steep it another time<br>
 Until it is sodden.<br>
 Not for a long time will be finished<br>
 30 What the elements produce.<br>
 Let his vessels be washed,<br>
 Let his wort be clear.<br>
 And when there shall be an exciter of song,<br>
 Let it be brought from the cell,<br>
 Let it be brought before kings.<br>
 In splendid festivals.<br>
 Will not oppose every two<br>
 The honey that made it.<br>
 God's departure in me,<br>
 40 As long as the world is in being,<br>
 The mildest is the Trinity.<br>
 The provocative of the drunkard is drunkenness.<br>
 The fishes might show<br>
 The capacity of the lodgments <a name="page_429"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 429</font></a><br>
 Of the gravel of the salt sea,<br>
 Before it overwhelms the strand.<br>
 The gravel of the salt sea<br>
 Below the sand<br>
 Will conceal me from the privileged one.<br>
 Myself he will deliver.<br>
 50 No one will be satisfied,<br>
 Without the power of the Trinity.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">II.</p>
 <p>Qualities they will honour<br>
 In the boundary of Garant.<br>
 The mighty ones, without desire, from the reeking<br>
 Marsh will remove,<br>
 When the string of harmony resounds,<br>
 Or the shades of night approach,<br>
 The hidden retreat from day.<br>
 Do the skilful in song know<br>
 Where the powerful artist is concealed?<br>
 10 That will give me a robe<br>
 From the gate when he ascends.<br>
 When the chief leads, in winter,<br>
 What melody is commenced together.<br>
 In choosing loud fame,<br>
 With haste the fortunate will run,<br>
 He will awake the sleeper.<br>
 He will merit Carawg<br>
 Of the many-citied Cymry,<br>
 The father of Caradawg;<br>
 20 The sound of the Meneivians,<br>
 The sound of Mynawg of Mona.<br>
 The great terrible perjured<br>
 Gwentians, long-haired.<br>
 On account of Caer Wyrangon. <a name="page_430"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 430</font></a><br>
 Who will pay the precious reward?<br>
 Is it Maelgwn from Mona?<br>
 Or shall it come from Aeron?<br>
 Or Coel or Canawon?<br>
 Or Gwrweddw or his sons?<br>
 30 His enemies shall not exult<br>
 From the hostages of Ynyr.<br>
 To him will resort the minstrels<br>
 The star of magnificent stars,<br>
 Have I not disarmed the mystery?<br>
 In Mordei Uffin,<br>
 In the seas of Gododin,<br>
 He is a sharer of varied words,<br>
 The raven of the morning divining.<br>
 I am an aged exile,<br>
 40 I am of joyful talents,<br>
 And the stroke of malice.<br>
 Mine, the praising of Urien,<br>
 Of splendid purity of life.<br>
 Very keen his conduct of hosts,<br>
 The ruddy-reaping of the steep.<br>
 Ruddyn formed them,<br>
 At the battle in Harddnenwys,<br>
 It was Ynyr that broke them to pieces.<br>
 A hundred festivals holding<br>
 50 A hundred friends be defended.<br>
 I saw mighty men,<br>
 Who hastened to the shout of war;<br>
 I saw blood on the ground<br>
 From the assault of swords.<br>
 They tinged with blue the wings of the dawn;<br>
 They threw off the spears.<br>
 Three hundred festivals complete of the renowned<br>
 Ynyr, on the earth indeed there will be redness.</p>
