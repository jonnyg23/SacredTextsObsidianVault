 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>ON the face of the earth his equal was not born,<br>
 Three persons of God, one Son gentle, strong Trinity.<br>
 Son of the Godhead, Son of the Manhood, one son wonderful.<br>
 Son of God, a fortress, Son of the blessed Mary, a good son to see. <a name="page_558"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 558</font></a><br>
 Great his destiny, great God supreme, a glorious portion.<br>
 Of the race of Adam, and Abraham he was born.<br>
 Of the race of the Lord, a portion of the eloquent host, was he born.<br>
 He brought by a word the blind and deaf from every ailment.<br>
 A people gluttonous, vain, iniquitous, vile, perverse,<br>
 10 We have risen against the Trinity, after redemption,<br>
 The Cross of Christ clearly, a breastplate gleaming against every ailment.<br>
 Against every hardship may it be certainly a city of protection.</p>
