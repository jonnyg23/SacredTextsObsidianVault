 <h3 align="CENTER">XXXIII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">RED BOOK OF HERGEST XI.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. I WAS formerly fair of limb, I was eloquent in speech:<br>
 What is not wonderful will be extolled<br>
 The men of Argoed have ever supported me.</p>
 <p><a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a></p>
 <p>II. I was formerly fair of limb, I was bold,<br>
 I was admitted into the congress-house<br>
 Of Powys, the paradise of the Cymry.</p>
 <p>III. I was formerly fair of limb, I was comely;<br>
 Throbbing was concomitant with my spear:<br>
 My back (now) curved was first in vigour--I am heavy, I am wretched.</p>
 <p>IV. Wooden crook! is it not the time of harvest,<br>
 When the fern is brown, and the reeds are yellow?<br>
 Have I not once disliked what I now love!</p>
 <p>V. Wooden crook! is not this winter,<br>
 When men are noisy over the beverage?<br>
 Is not my bedside void of greeting visits!</p>
 <p>VI. Wooden crook! is it not the spring,<br>
 When the cuckoos are brownish, when the foam is bright?<br>
 I am destitute of a maiden's love.</p>
 <p>VII. Wooden crook! is it not the beginning of summer,<br>
 Are not the furrows brown, are not the corn-blades curled?<br>
 It is refreshing to me to look at thy beak!</p>
 <p>VIII. Wooden crook! thou contented branch<br>
 That supportest a mourning old man!<br>
 Llywarch of pleasant talk!</p>
 <p>IX. Wooden crook! thou hardy branch<br>
 That bearest with me--God protect thee!<br>
 Thou art justly called the tree of wandering.</p>
 <p><a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a></p>
 <p>X. Wooden crook! be thou steady,<br>
 So that thou mayest support me the better--<br>
 Am not I Llywarch known to many far away?</p>
 <p>XI. Surely old age is uniting itself with me,<br>
 From my hair to my teeth,<br>
 And the glowing eyeball which the young ones loved!</p>
 <p>XII. Surely old age is uniting itself with me,<br>
 From my hair to my teeth,<br>
 And the glowing eyeball which the women loved!</p>
 <p>XIII. The wind grinningly blusters out, white is the skirt of the wood,<br>
 Lively is the stag, there is no moisture on the hill;<br>
 Feeble is the aged, slowly he moves!</p>
 <p>XIV. This leaf, is it not driven by the wind?<br>
 Woe to it as to its fate!<br>
 It is old, this year was it born.</p>
 <p>XV. What I loved when a youth are hateful to me now:<br>
 A stranger's daughter, and a gray steed.<br>
 Am not I for them unmeet?</p>
 <p>XVI. The four most hateful things to me through life,<br>
 Have met together with one accord:--<br>
 Cough and old age, sickness and grief.</p>
 <p>XVII. I am old, I am lonely, I am decrepit and cold,<br>
 After the sumptuous bed of honour:<br>
 I am wretched, I am triply bent!</p>
 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p>
 <p>XVIII. I am triply bent and old, I am fickly bold,<br>
 I am rash, I am outrageous:<br>
 Those that loved me, love me not.</p>
 <p>XIX. Young maidens love me not, I am visited by none,<br>
 I cannot move about--<br>
 Ah! death, that he does not seek me!</p>
 <p>XX. I am sought by neither sleep nor gladness;<br>
 After the slaughter of Llawr and Gwen,<br>
 I am outrageous and loathsome, I am old.</p>
 <p>XXI. Wretched was the fate decreed to Llywarch<br>
 On the night he was born;<br>
 Long pain without being delivered of his load of trouble.</p>
 <p>XXII. Array not thyself after waiting; let not thy mind be vexed;<br>
 Sharp is the gale, and bleak the spring!--<br>
 Accuse me not, my mother--I am thy son!</p>
 <p>XXIII. Do I not recognise by my Awen,<br>
 My descent, sway, and kindred:<br>
 Three themes of the harmonious Awen?</p>
 <p>XXIV. Sharp is my spear, furious in the onset;<br>
 I will prepare to watch the ford;<br>
 Support against falling may God grant me.</p>
 <p>XXV. Shouldst thou run away, I will weep for thee;<br>
 Shouldst thou be slain, I shall mourn thee:<br>
 Lose not the countenance of the men of conflict.</p>
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p>
 <p>XXVI. I will not lose thy countenance, prone to warfare,<br>
 From the time that the hero puts on harness for the course;<br>
 I will hear the pang ere I quit the spot.</p>
 <p>XXVII. Gliding is the wave along the beach;<br>
 I perceive that the design of that battle will be frustrated,<br>
 It is usual for the talkative to run away.</p>
 <p>XXVIII. Of that which concerns me I will speak;<br>
 There is breaking of spears about the place where I am;<br>
 I will not say but that I may retreat.</p>
 <p>XXIX. Soft is the bog, the cliff is hard,<br>
 Before the hart's hoof the edge of the bank breaks,<br>
 A promise not fulfilled is none at all.</p>
 <p>XXX. The streams will divide around the wall of the Caer,<br>
 And I will prognosticate--<br>
 A shield with a fractured front before I skulk.</p>
 <p>XXXI. The horn given to thee by Urien,<br>
 With the wreath of gold around its rim,<br>
 Blow in it, if thou art in danger.</p>
 <p>XXXII. For the terror of death from the base men of Lloegyr<br>
 I will. not tarnish my honour;<br>
 I will not dispraise maidens.</p>
 <p>XXXIII. Whilst I was of the age of yonder youth,<br>
 That wears the golden spurs,<br>
 I was active in thrusting the spear.</p>
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p>
 <p>XXXIV. Truly thy young man is faithful,<br>
 Thou art alive, and thy witness is slain,<br>
 The old man that is now feeble was not so in his youth.</p>
 <p>XXXV. Gwen, by the Llawen, watched last night,<br>
 And success did not fail him:<br>
 The battle progressed on the green embankment.</p>
 <p>XXXVI. Gwen, by the Llawen, watched last night,<br>
 With the shield on the shoulder;<br>
 As he was my son, he did not retreat.</p>
 <p>XXXVII. Gwen with the lowering look, troubled is my mind,<br>
 Thy death greatly provokes my wrath--<br>
 It is not kindred (only) that will speak of thee!</p>
 <p>XXXVIII. Gwen with thigh of wide opening watched last night<br>
 On the border of the ford of Morlas;<br>
 And as he was my son, he did not retreat.</p>
 <p>XXXIX. Gwen, I knew thy inherent disposition;<br>
 In the assault like the eagle at fall of rivers thou wert;<br>
 If I were fortunate thou wouldst have escaped.</p>
 <p>XL. Let the face of the ground be turned up, let the assailants be covered,<br>
 When chiefs repair to the toil of war;<br>
 Gwen, woe to him that is over old, for thee he is indignant.</p>
 <p>XLI. Let the face of the ground be turned up, and the plain be covered,<br>
 When the opposing spears are lifted up.<br>
 Gwen, woe to him that is over old, that he should have lost thee.</p>
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p>
 <p>XLII. My son was a man, splendid was his fame;<br>
 And he was the nephew of Urien;<br>
 On the ford of Morlas, Gwen was slain.</p>
 <p>XLIII. The shrine of the fierce overbearing foe,<br>
 That vanquished the circularly compact army of Lloegr;<br>
 The grave of Gwen, the son of Llywarch Hen, is this!</p>
 <p>XLIV. Four-and-twenty sons have been to me,<br>
 Wearing the golden chain, leaders of armies;<br>
 Gwen was the best of them.</p>
 <p>XLV. Four-and-twenty sons have been to me,<br>
 Wearing the golden chain, leaders of battle;<br>
 Gwen was the best son of his father.</p>
 <p>XLVI. Four-and-twenty sons to me have been,<br>
 Wearing the golden chain, leading princes;<br>
 Compared with Gwen they were but striplings.</p>
 <p>XLVII. Four-and-twenty sons were in the family of Llywarch,<br>
 Of brave men fall of the wrath of war;<br>
 Their march was a rush, immense their fame.</p>
 <p>XLVIII. Four-and-twenty were my sons complete;<br>
 My flesh they have caused to wither;<br>
 It is well that my budget of misfortune is come!</p>
 <p>XLIX When Pyll was slain, gashing was the wound;<br>
 And the blood on the hair seemed horrible;<br>
 And on both banks of the Ffraw there was violence.</p>
 <p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a></p>
 <p>L. A room might be formed for the wings of shields,<br>
 Which would hold one standing upright,<br>
 That were broken in the grasp of Pyll.</p>
 <p>LI. The chosen man amongst my sons,<br>
 When each assaulted the foe,<br>
 Was fair Pyll, impetuous as a fire through a chimney.</p>
 <p>LII. Gracefully he placed his thigh over the saddle.<br>
 Of his horse, on the near and far side--<br>
 Pyll, impetuous as the fire through a chimney.</p>
 <p>LIII. He was gentle, with a hand eager for battle;<br>
 He was second to no treasure;<br>
 He was a bulwark on the course--<br>
 Fair Pyll! fearful is his covering of separation.</p>
 <p>LIV. When he stood at the door of his tent,<br>
 On the dark-gray steed,<br>
 At the sight, the wife of Pyll would recognise a hero.</p>
 <p>LV. There was fractured before Pyll a strong skull;<br>
 Seldom would the silent coward be concealed from him;<br>
 The weak is satisfied without anything.</p>
 <p>LVI. Fair Pyll, widely spread his fame:<br>
 Am. I not invigorated since thou hast existed<br>
 As my son, and joyful to have known thee?</p>
 <p>LVII. The best three men under heaven<br>
 That guarded their habitation,--<br>
 Pyll, and Selyv, and Sandev.</p>
 <p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a></p>
 <p>LVIII. A shield I gave to Pyll;<br>
 Before he slept was it not perforated?<br>
 To promise it carelessly was to depreciate it.</p>
 <p>LIX. Should Cymry come, and the predatory host of Lloegr,<br>
 And many from distant parts,<br>
 Pyll would show them conduct.</p>
 <p>LX. Nor Pyll nor Madawg would be long lived,<br>
 If they preserved the custom.<br>
 Would they surrender? they would not surrender! they would never ask for truce!</p>
 <p>LXI. Behold here the grave of a faultless one and warlike;<br>
 With the Bards his fame went, where would not have gone,<br>
 Pyll, if longer he had continued?</p>
 <p>LXII. Maen, and Madawg, and Medel, valiant men,<br>
 And brothers not refractory,<br>
 Selyv, Heilyn, Llawr, and Lliver.</p>
 <p>LXIII. The grave of Gwell is in Rhiw Velen;<br>
 The grave of Sawyl in Llangollen;<br>
 Llawr protects the pass of Llorien,</p>
 <p>LXIV. The grave of Rhudd, is it not covered with sods?<br>
 The earth of Ammarch does not conceal<br>
 The grave of Llyngedwy, the son of Llywarch.</p>
 <p>LXV. Far from hence is Aber Llyw,<br>
 Farther are the two Cyvedliws:<br>
 Talan, thou hast repaid my tears to-day.</p>
 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a></p>
 <p>LXVI. I have drunk wine from the goblet;<br>
 He would rush forward against the lance-bearer;<br>
 Like the wings of the dawn were the gleamings of the spear of Duawg.</p>
 <p>LXVII. I have repented of the time that I entreated<br>
 That thou shouldst not have thy choice;<br>
 It would have been generous to have life prolonged a month.</p>
 <p>LXVIII. I know the voice of distress:--<br>
 When he descended into the congress-house,<br>
 Chief of men, a goblet of wine he deserved.</p>
