 <p>GOD supreme, be mine the Awen! Amen; fiat!<br>
 A successful song of fruitful praise, relating to the bustling course of the host,<br>
 According to the sacred ode of Cyridwen, the goddess of various seeds,<br>
 The various seeds of poetic harmony, the exalted speech of the graduated minstrel,<br>
 Cuhelyn the bard of elegant Cymraec utterly rejects.<br>
 A poem for a favour, the gift of friendship, will not be maintained. .<br>
 But a composition of thorough praise is being brought to thee,<br>
 Splendid singer in a choir, and of a song equal in length and motion.<br>
 Appropriate and full were the tuneful horns, gloriously ascended the conflagration <a name="page_499"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 499</font></a><br>
 10 Of the nation of the border, whose troops were of the same pace and simultaneous movement.<br>
 Praise the here, whose gift is large, the benefit of humble suitors,<br>
 Light is the rebuke of the rallying-point of relatives, the winner of praise,<br>
 A skilful fastener, for a hundred calends, the accumulator of heat;<br>
 A fierce frowning wolf, whose inflexible disposition is law, accustomed to jurisdiction.<br>
 Eidoel was a man extremely brave, very choice and full of wisdom;<br>
 A leader as regards the Brython, full of knowledge and prudence, fiery in his wrath;<br>
 Accustomed to hatred, accustomed to harmony, and to the high seat in the banquet of mead;<br>
 Partaker of the intoxicating wine, a knight of the list, a place of limitation;<br>
 A lord who is the measurer of the wall, the delight of the four quarters, the great centre power;<br>
 20 A knight of stout conduct, a knight of virtuous conduct, with warriors full of rage;<br>
 A guardian celebrated in song, a fine panegyric, the blandishment of language.<br>
 Odious was his death by Nognaw. Am I not agitated? The active and eloquent one will I praise;<br>
 A contented ruler, a restless guardian, energetic and wise.<br>
 A company of active reapers, melodious poetry, and the assuaging of wrath<br>
 A talented hero, like a furious wave over the strand,<br>
 The marrow of fine songs, a contemplative mind, a sacred mystery;<br>
 A servitor with knowledge, the possession of mead, in agreeable eulogy; <a name="page_500"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 500</font></a><br>
 Music which has melody like that of a golden organ, a place of retirement;<br>
 The action of law against violence, the admirable vigour of the brave, the energy of the Supreme Being.<br>
 30 A blessing I will venture to ask, a blessing I will pray for, I will bind myself thereby;<br>
 The wonderful rush of the gale, the pervasion of fire, the war of youth;<br>
 One deserving of ruddy gold, one liberal of praise furrowed (with age), a free wing;<br>
 Ready affluence, a rill in a pleasant shelter, a reward for a panegyric.<br>
 The most deserving will yield, he will keep his refuge from the insult of the enemy:<br>
 He has completely kept the law, completely shown his disposition before the placid Ogyrven.<br>
 For a good turn from me, may the gift of Cuhelyn give satisfaction of mind.</p>
