 <p>I. SWEET appletree of delightful branches,<br>
 Budding luxuriantly, and shooting forth renowned scions,<br>
 I will predict before the owner of Machreu,<br>
 That in the valley of Machawy on Wednesday there will be blood,--<br>
 Joy to Lloegyr of the blood-red blades.<br>
 Rear, O little pig! there will come on Thursday<br>
 Joy to the Cymry of mighty battles,<br>
 In their defence of Cymminawd, with their incessant sword-thrusts.<br>
 On the Saxons there will be a slaughter with ashen spears,<br>
 And their heads will be used as balls to play with.<br>
 I prophesy truth without disguise,--<br>
 The elevation of a child in a secluded part of the South.</p>
 <p>II. Sweet appletree, a green tree of luxurious growth,<br>
 How large are its branches, and beautiful its form!<br>
 And I will predict a battle that will make me shriek<br>
 At Pengwern, in the sovereign feast, mead is appropriate. <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>III. Sweet appletree, and a yellow tree;<br>
 Grow at Tal Ardd, without a garden surrounding it;<br>
 And I will predict a battle in Prydyn,<br>
 In defence of their frontier against the men of Dublin;<br>
 Seven ships will come over the wide lake,<br>
 And seven hundred over the sea to conquer.<br>
 Of those that come, none will go to Cennyn,<br>
 Except seven half-empty ones, according to the prediction.</p>
 <p>IV. Sweet appletree that luxuriantly grows!<br>
 Food I used to take at it base to please a fair maid,<br>
 When, with my shield on my shoulder, and my sword on my thigh,<br>
 I slept all alone in the woods of Celyddon.<br>
 Hear, O little pig! now apply thyself to reason,<br>
 And listen to birds whose notes. are pleasant,<br>
 Sovereigns across the sea will come on Monday;<br>
 Blessed will the Cymry be, from that design.</p>
 <p>V. Sweet appletree that grows in the glade!<br>
 Their vehemence will conceal it from the lords of Rydderch,<br>
 Trodden it is around its base, and men are about it.<br>
 Terrible to them were heroic forms.<br>
 Gwendydd loves me not, greets me not;<br>
 I am hated by the firmest minister of Rydderch;<br>
 I have ruined his son and his daughter.<br>
 Death takes all away, why does he not visit me?<br>
 For after Gwenddoleu no princes honour me;<br>
 I am not soothed with diversion, I am not visited by the fair;<br>
 Yet in the battle of Ardderyd golden was my torques,<br>
 Though I am now despised by her who is of the colour of swans.</p>
 <p><a name="page_372"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 372</font></a></p>
 <p>VI. Sweet appletree of delicate bloom,<br>
 That grows in concealment in the woods!<br>
 At break of day the tale was told me,<br>
 That the firmest minister is offended at my creed,<br>
 Twice, thrice, four times, in one day.<br>
 O Jesus! would that my end had come<br>
 Before the death of the son of Gwendydd happen on my hand!</p>
 <p>VII. Sweet appletree, which grows by the river-side!<br>
 With respect to it, the keeper will not thrive on its splendid fruit.<br>
 While my reason was not aberrant, I used to be around its stem<br>
 With a fair sportive maid, a paragon of slender form.<br>
 Ten years and forty, as the toy of lawless ones,<br>
 Have I been wandering in gloom and among sprites.<br>
 After wealth in abundance and entertaining minstrels,<br>
 I have been (here so long that) it is useless for gloom and sprites to lead me astray.<br>
 I will not sleep, but tremble on account of my leader,<br>
 My lord Gwenddoleu, and those who are natives of my country.<br>
 After suffering disease and longing grief about the words of Celyddon,<br>
 May I become a blessed servant of the Sovereign of splendid retinues!</p>
 <p>VIII. Sweet appletree of delicate blossoms,<br>
 Which grows in the soil amid the trees!<br>
 The Sibyl foretells a tale that will come to pass--<br>
 A golden rod of great value, will, for bravery,<br>
 Be given to glorious chiefs before the dragons;<br>
 The diffuser of grace will vanquish the profane man. <a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 373</font></a><br>
 Before the child, bold as the sun in his courses,<br>
 Saxons shall be eradicated, and bards shall flourish.</p>
 <p>IX. Sweet appletree, and a tree of crimson hue,<br>
 Which grow in concealment in the wood of Celyddon;<br>
 Though sought for their fruit, it will be in vain,<br>
 Until Cadwaladyr comes from the conference of Cadvaon,<br>
 To the Eagle of Tywi and Teiwi rivers;<br>
 And until fierce anguish comes from Aranwynion,<br>
 And the wild and long-haired ones are made tame:</p>
 <p>X. Sweet appletree, and a tree of crimson hue,<br>
 Which grow in concealment in the wood of Celyddon;<br>
 Though sought for their fruit, it will be in vain,<br>
 Until Cadwaladyr comes from the conference of Rhyd Rheon,<br>
 And Cynan to meet him advances upon the Saxons;<br>
 The Cymry will be victorious, glorious will be their leader.<br>
 All shall have their rights, and the Brython will rejoice,<br>
 Sounding the horns of gladness, and chanting the song of peace and happiness!</p>
