 <p align="CENTER">HERE NOW BEGINNETH THE GORCHAN OF CYNVELYN.</p>
 <p>WERE I to praise,<br>
 Were I to sing,<br>
 The Gwarchan would cause high shoots to spring,<br>
 Stalks like the collar of Trych Trwyth,<br>
 Monstrously savage, bursting and thrusting through,<br>
 When he was attacked in the river<br>
 Before his precious things.<br>
 Carn Gaffon burst through,<br>
 Before the cairns of Riwrhon,<br>
 10 Those that delighted in war,<br>
 Whose bones were short, their horsemen shorter.<br>
 Gylvach burst through<br>
 The assaults of heroism.<br>
 Fury against the Angles is just;<br>
 It is right to kill; it is right to crush those who are crushing.<br>
 Before the congenial splendour<br>
 There will be light for furthering the project,<br>
 And ability to descend<br>
 To every daring enterprise,<br>
 20 Through nail, through snare,<br>
 Through trapdoor, and fetters,<br>
 And gold spread abroad;<br>
 And deep sorrow will happen<br>
 To Gwynassedd the yellow.<br>
 His blood will be around him<br>
 Concealed will be the froth <a name="page_413"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 413</font></a><br>
 Of the splendid yellow mead;<br>
 Again there will be blood around him<br>
 Before the battles of Cynvelyn,--<br>
 30 From the indignation of Cynvelyn,<br>
 The uplifted pillar of wrath,<br>
 Food-provider for the birds.<br>
 With pendent stirrups<br>
 Will the graceful ones return,<br>
 Under the thigh of the heroes,<br>
 As swift as sprites move<br>
 On a pleasant lawn.<br>
 Sovereign of the land of song!<br>
 It is mine to lament him,<br>
 40 Until I come to the silent day!<br>
 The foe asked for<br>
 A long-handled weapon!<br>
 More powerful than the highly-honoured lays<br>
 Is the Gwarchan of Cynvelyn.<br>
 The Gorchan of Cynvelyn, to make the region weep.<br>
 A man of fortitude from Gwynedd has departed his country!<br>
 The brave are lamented;<br>
 Let the Caer of Eiddin deplore<br>
 The dread and illustrious men clothed in splendid blue.<br>
 50 Brilliant is thy ruddy gem--is it not precious?<br>
 Flowing panegyric is due to the horses<br>
 Of Eithinyn--are they not splendid?<br>
 The Gwarchan of Cynvelyn on Gododin!<br>
 Has he not, for a man, performed a reasonable part?<br>
 His heavy spear, adorned with gold, he bestowed on me;<br>
 Be it for the benefit of his soul!<br>
 His son Tegvan shall be honoured<br>
 In numbering and in partitioning, the grandson of Cadvan,<br>
 The pillar of ardency.<br>
 60 When weapons were hurled <a name="page_414"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 414</font></a><br>
 Over the heads of battle-wolves,<br>
 Soon would he come in the day of distress.<br>
 Three men and three score and three hundred<br>
 To the conflict of Catraeth went forth;<br>
 Of those who hastened<br>
 From the mead of the cup-bearers, three only returned,--<br>
 Cynon, and Cadreith, and Cadlew of Cadnant;<br>
 And me, on account of my blood they deplored,<br>
 Son of the omen pile, my ransom they contributed,<br>
 70 Of pure gold, and steel, and silver.<br>
 For their heroism they received no protection.<br>
 The Gwarchan of Cynvelyn will celebrate their contribution.</p>
