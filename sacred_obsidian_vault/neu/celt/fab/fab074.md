 <p>THE Awen foretells the hastening of<br>
 The multitude, possessed of wealth and peace;<br>
 And a bountiful sovereign, and eloquent princes.<br>
 And after tranquillity, commotion in every place,<br>
 Heroic men raising a tumult of fierce contention.<br>
 Swift the remorse of defending too long.<br>
 The contention of men even to Caer Weir, the dispersion of the Allmyn.<br>
 They made great rejoicing after exhaustion,<br>
 And the reconciling of the Cymry and the men of Dublin,<br>
 10 The Gwyddyl of Iwerdon, Mona, and Prydyn,<br>
 Cornwall and Clydemen their compact with them.<br>
 The Brython will be outcasts, when they shall have done,<br>
 Far will be foretold the time they shall be.<br>
 Kings and nobles will subdue them.<br>
 The men of the North at the entry surrounding them,<br>
 In the midst of their front they will descend.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">II.</p>
 <p>Myrdin foretells these will meet,<br>
 In Aber Peryddon, the stewards of the kings<br>
 And though there be no right of slaughter they complain. <a name="page_437"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 437</font></a><br>
 20 Of one will of the mind they will refuse.<br>
 Stewards their taxes would collect;<br>
 In the treasures of Cymry, there was not that they would pay.<br>
 One that is a proprietor says this.<br>
 There will not come one that will pay in slavery.<br>
 The great Son of Mary declareth, when if did not break out<br>
 Against the chief of the Saxons and their fondness,<br>
 Far be the Cychmyn to Gwrtheyrn of Gwynedd.<br>
 He drove the Allmyn to banishment.<br>
 No one will attain to anything, but what earth will deprive.<br>
 30 They know not what may be passing in every outlet.<br>
 When they bought Thanet, through lack of discretion,<br>
 With Hors and Heng who were in their career,<br>
 Their prosperity has been derived from us without honour.<br>
 After a secret, the captive was worked upon at the Ynver.<br>
 Drunkenness will be pleased with much liquor of mead,<br>
 Poverty will bear with the death of many.<br>
 Terrors will bear with the tears of women;<br>
 An enervated chief will excite a wailing.<br>
 The sorrow of the world will bear with much irritation.<br>
 40 When the Cechmyu of Thanet are our kings,<br>
 May the Trinity ward off the blow that is intended.<br>
 To agitate the land of the Brython, and the Saxons at variance.<br>
 Sooner may their kings be in banishment,<br>
 Than the Cymry should go into exile.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">III.</p>
 <p>The great Son of Mary declareth, when will not break out<br>
 The Cymry against the surmise of a baron, and princes;<br>
 Foremost ones in asking, examples, one law they complain,<br>
 One meeting, one council, of one voice they are.<br>
 There were none, however great, who did not speak. <a name="page_438"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 438</font></a><br>
 50 Except to dispense with surmises they would not agree.<br>
 To God and David they recommended themselves.<br>
 Let him pay, let him refrain from a refusal to Allmyn.<br>
 Let them make ill reports of the wants of the townsman.<br>
 The Cymry will meet the Saxons.<br>
 For various mutual consumption and resistance.<br>
 Of the excessively great army, when they have experience,<br>
 And on the hill, at the blades and shout, they will tremble,<br>
 And on the Gwy severe rencounters will follow them.<br>
 And a banner will come, rough it will descend.<br>
 60 And like the budded blossoms the Saxons will fall.<br>
 The Cymry gathering strength with union of actions.<br>
 First and last the Granwynyon were in a strait,<br>
 The stewards to the value of their deceit prostrating them.<br>
 Their army in the running of blood surrounding them.<br>
 Others on their feet through woods will retreat.<br>
 Through the ramparts of the city they will flee.<br>
 A war without returning to the land of Prydyn.<br>
 The council will be broken by hand, like the sea they will glide away.<br>
 The stewards of Caer Ceri dishonoured complain.<br>
 70 Some the valley and hill do not decline,<br>
 To Aber Peryddon they came not well.<br>
 Tremendous taxes they collect.<br>
 Nine score hundred men they descend.<br>
 Great mockery, except four, they did not return.<br>
 Tranquillity to their wives they say,<br>
 Their shirts full of gore they wash.<br>
 The Cymry, foremost in asking, profuse of soul,<br>
 The men of the South will defend their taxes,<br>
 With sharp-ground blades utterly they will kill.<br>
 80 There will be no advantage to the physician from what they do.<br>
 The armies of Cadwaladyr, mighty they come, <a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a><br>
 The Cymry were exalted, a battle they made.<br>
 A slaughter without measure they assailed.<br>
 In the end of their taxes, death they know.<br>
 Others, large branches they planted.<br>
 For age of ages their taxes they will not leave off.<br>
 In wood, in plain, on hill,<br>
 A candle in the dark will go with them.<br>
 Cynan opening a forward way in every descent.<br>
 90 Saxons against the Brython, woe they will sing.<br>
 Cadwaladyr a pillar with his princes.<br>
 Though prudence utterly attending to them.<br>
 When they drop their covering over their support.<br>
 In affliction, and the crimson gore on the cheeks of the Allmyn.<br>
 At the end of every expedition spoil they lead.<br>
 The Saxon on journey as far as Caer Wynt formerly who sooner skulked?<br>
 Happy they, the Cymry, when they say,<br>
 The Trinity delivered us from the former trouble.<br>
 Let not Dyved or Glywyssyg tremble.<br>
 100 The praise of stewards will not affect kings,<br>
 Nor shall the councils of the Saxons obtain what they say.<br>
 Meads shall not cause drunkenness with us,<br>
 Without the payment by fate of what we have.<br>
 From orphaned sons and others a few<br>
 Through the intercession of David and the saints of Prydeyn,<br>
 As far as the stream of Arlego they will flee out.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">IV.</p>
 <p>The Awen foretells, the day will come,<br>
 When he will come to summon to one council,<br>
 One company, one council, and Lloegyr being burnt, <a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a><br>
 110 In the hope of detracting our most comely army.<br>
 And the song of another country will flee always.<br>
 He knows not a hiding-place for my goods, and where will be a shelter?<br>
 They raise a barking, like a bear from the mountain.<br>
 To pay flattery their country will bleed.<br>
 Again shall come the toil of spears, fierce and sharp:<br>
 The friend shall not spare the body of his companion.<br>
 Again shall come the head of a salmon without brains;<br>
 Again shall come widowed women and spare horses.<br>
 Again shall come a terrible shout from the assault of the warriors,<br>
 120 And many hands unequal before scattering armies.<br>
 The messengers of death met together,<br>
 When stood carcases according to their origin,<br>
 The tax will be avenged and the value daily,<br>
 And the many messages on the false army.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">V.</p>
 <p>The Cymry have prevailed through the rencounter,<br>
 Completely unanimous: of one voice, of one faith.<br>
 The Cymry have prevailed to cause battle.<br>
 And the tribes of many a country they will collect,<br>
 And the holy banner of David they will raise,<br>
 130 To lead the Gwyddyl through the dark blue sea.<br>
 And the faction of Dublin with us stood,<br>
 When they come to the battle, they will not deny themselves;<br>
 They will ask the Saxons what they seek:<br>
 How much of debt from the country they hold?<br>
 Whence is their route when they settled?<br>
 Whence their generation? from what land did they come?<br>
 Since the time of Gwrtheyrn they trample upon us.<br>
 Truth will not be obtained in the land of discord.<a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a><br>
 Did they not trample entirely on the privilege of our saints?<br>
 140 Did they not entirely break through the miracles of David?<br>
 The Cymry will keep themselves, when they visit.<br>
 The Allmyn will not go from the places they stand on,<br>
 Until they shall have paid seven times the value of what they did.<br>
 And death shall scatter to the value of their wrong.<br>
 The kin of Garmawn will pay of honour,<br>
 In four years and four hundred.<br>
 Valiant men long-haired, the Lord will incite:<br>
 And a driving of the Saxons from Iwerdon there will be.<br>
 Thence will come from Lengo, a wanton fleet,<br>
 150 The battle was ruined, the armies were torn.<br>
 There will come from Alclud, men, bold, faithful,<br>
 To drive from Prydein bright armies.<br>
 There will come from Llydaw, a seasonable ally,<br>
 Warriors from their war-horses will not regard their origin.<br>
 Saxons on all sides into disgrace will come;<br>
 Their age has passed away; there is not a country.<br>
 Death has been accomplished to the black auxiliary.<br>
 Disease and duty will deliver us,<br>
 After gold and silver and what is congenial.<br>
 160 Let a bush be their shelter in reward of their bad faith.<br>
 Let the sea be, let an anchor be, their counsellors.<br>
 let gore be, let death be, their auxiliary.<br>
 Cynan and Cadwaladyr, mighty in armies;<br>
 They will, be honoured until judgment: prosperity will attend them.<br>
 Two tenacious chiefs; profound their counsel.<br>
 Two that will overcome the Saxons, with the aid of the Lord.<br>
 Two generous ones, two treasurers of a merchant's country. <a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a><br>
 Two fearless ones, ready, of one fortune, of one faith.<br>
 Two exalters of Prydein of bright armies.<br>
 170 Two bears do not know shame barking daily.<br>
 Druids foretell what great things will happen.<br>
 From Mynaw to Llydaw in their hands will be.<br>
 From Dyved to Thanet they will possess.<br>
 From the light to the ground along their Abers.<br>
 Their chief partly paid for the land.<br>
 A nakedness on Cynon, Saxons will not be.<br>
 The Gwyddyl will return to their native country,<br>
 The Cymry will raise up a mighty auxiliary.<br>
 Armies about ale from the tumult of soldiers.<br>
 180 And the kings of God that have kept their faith<br>
 Will summon to every fleet: trouble will end;<br>
 And Cynan will reconcile them with each other.<br>
 Cynon will not call in as combatants,<br>
 Save the Cechmyn of Cadwaladyr, and his merchants.<br>
 Like a Cymro, joyful of speech he will be,<br>
 About the afflicted isle swarms will cease;<br>
 When the carcases stand according to their race,<br>
 Even to Aber Santwic it will be noised,<br>
 That the Allmyn are about to emigrate abroad,<br>
 190 One after another, breaking afresh upon their race.<br>
 The Saxons at anchor on the sea always,<br>
 The Cymry venerable until doomsday shall be supreme<br>
 They will not seek books nor be covetous of poets.<br>
 The presage of this isle will be no other than this.<br>
 We will praise the King that created heaven and earth.<br>
 May David be a leader to the combatants.<br>
 Ynyr in Gelli Caer for God be is;<br>
 He will not die, he will not run away, he will not exhaust;<br>
 He will not fade, he will not fail, he will not bend, he will not tremble.</p>
