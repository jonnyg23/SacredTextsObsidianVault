 <p>I. I WILL offer a prayer to the Trinity,<br>
 May the Eternal grant me to praise thee!<br>
 In the present course, dangerous<br>
 Our work; destruction is a slight impulse of wrath.<br>
 They reckon of the saints a tribe,<br>
 King of heaven, may I be eloquent about thee!<br>
 Before the separation of my soul from my flesh.<br>
 Thou particularly knowest in what is my sin.</p>
 <p>II. Thy entreaty before the paternal governance<br>
 May there be to me from the Trinity mercy!<br>
 I adore, I earnestly long for the elements of blood,<br>
 Nine degrees of the mystic troops of heaven,<br>
 And the tenth, saints a preparation of sevens.<br>
 Heroic numberer of languages,<br>
 A conspicuous sea-shoal of goodly increase.<br>
 A number that God will watch with extreme love.<br>
 In heaven, in earth, at the end,<br>
 In straits, in expanse, in form,<br>
 In body, in soul, in habit,<br>
 Prudence (is) far from the presence of kings.<br>
 j adore thee, Ruler of the land of peace.<br>
 Let my soul be in a condition of life;<br>
 For ever in (his) court;<br>
 A servant of heaven (to be), he will not refuse me.</p>
 <p>III. Apostles and martyrs,<br>
 Youths, supplicants of glory, <a name="page_546"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 546</font></a><br>
 And Solomon (that) served God:<br>
 Of pure speech, of pure walk, thy quality<br>
 And a verdant gift will come to me.<br>
 As long as I keep my faculties.<br>
 Numbers there were clean and holy,<br>
 Steps, golden columns of the church.<br>
 And many writers have declared,<br>
 Skilled in the fully-holy books,<br>
 For the multitude discarded anxiety.<br>
 May my soul be defended from it!</p>
 <p>IV. A number there were in the inconcurrence<br>
 Of Uffern, a cold refuge;<br>
 During the five ages of the world,<br>
 Until when Christ loosened the bondage.<br>
 From the deep shore of the abyss of evil<br>
 Many God brought through protection,<br>
 Two thousand sons of the children of Ilia.<br>
 A bimatu et infra<br>

 The tears of Rachel, it was seen that a plague<br>
 Had come to Jerusalem.</p>

 From the chief temple of the chief infidel nation.</p>

 The fame far of the castle of Maria.<br>
 That broke not again Syloe<br>
 Ecclesie retunde<br>
 Phalatie cesarie<br>
 Amanion amabute,<br>
 And the valleys of Bersabe.<br>
 And before the Christian religion the men of Cartasine,<br>
 And the severely just ones of Retunde,<br>
 The languages, Greek and Hebrew,<br>
 And Latin, men of gleaming pervasion.</p>
 <p>VIII. The number of saints in scores,<br>
 Valiant men, golden their party.<br>
 Before kings a career of praise,<br>
 Warriors, no one was before them in demanding.<br>
 In straits, in expanse, in every need,<br>
 May they be a city to our body and our soul!</p>
 <p>IX. The number of the saints of Sicomorialis,<br>
 And isle of Deffrobani.<br>
 And the holy multitude that blessed<br>
 Water, wine, hostile men destroyed.<br>
 And entreating his exalted weight,<br>
 Under the stars, saints he planted.</p>
 <p>X. The number of the saints that the upper region holds,<br>
 Effectus re inferior<br>

 And Iwerdon, a gentle portion.<br>
 Multitudes, of beautiful works,<br>
 Believed, served with us.</p>
 <p>XII. The number of saints, a synod without desire,<br>
 From God the divine prophesy.<br>
 In every tongue they compose,<br>
 About the earth they were,<br>
 And so many wisely prophesied<br>
 Christ, and before he was, they were.</p>
 <p>XIII. The number of the saints of the East,<br>
 And the concord of the nation of Judah.<br>
 Languages of Greek and Hebrew,<br>
 And Latin, men of gleaming pervasion.</p>
 <p>XIV. Seven scores, seven scores, seven hundreds of saints,<br>
 And seven thousands and seven ten scores,<br>
 November a number implored,<br>
 Through martyrs good they came.<br>
 Fifteen scores of saints there were<br>
 And three thousand children of Morialis.<br>
 In these Decembers above relatives<br>
 Over the head of Jesus utter sighs.</p>
 <p>XV. Twelve thousand in the convention<br>
 Believed through the voice of John.<br>
 They worship, they deserve a portion,<br>
 In heaven they will not be angry.</p>
 <p><a name="page_549"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 549</font></a></p>
 <p>XVI. Nine thousand saints received<br>
 Baptism, and religion, and confession.<br>
 Notwithstanding death the punishment of people (is) heat,<br>
 Uffern, cold its refuge.<br>
 If the Lord hath satisfied us,<br>
 Through the head of Peter was made the destitute.</p>
 <p>XVII. Qui venerunt angli<br>
 In natale Domini<br>
 Media nocte in laudem<br>
 Cum pastoribus in Bethleem.<br>
 Nivem angli de celo<br>
 Cum Michaele archanglo<br>
 Qui precedunt precelio<br>
 Erga animas in mundo<br>
 Am nivem nivem angeli.<br>
 Precedunt confirmati<br>
 Vnistrati baptizati<br>
 Usque in them judicii.<br>
 Quando fuit Christus crucifixus ut sibi<br>
 Ipsi placuisset venissent ibi in auxilium<br>
 Plusquam duodecim legiones angelorum.<br>
 Toto orbe terrarum.<br>
 Jesus Christus videntem in agonia in mundo.<br>
 Ut sint nostri auxilium<br>
 Duodecim milia miliantem<br>
 Ante tribunal stantem.<br>
 Qui laudantie laudantium<br>
 Tues mores rex regum.</p>
 <p>XVIII. The number that have been, and will be,<br>
 Above heaven, below heaven, how many there are.<br>
 And as many as have believed in revelation, <a name="page_550"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 550</font></a><br>
 Believed through the will of the Lord.<br>
 As many as are on wrath through the circles,<br>
 Have mercy, God, on thy kindred.<br>
 May I be meek, the turbulent ruler,<br>
 May I not endure, before I am without motion.<br>
 Grievously complaineth every lost one,<br>
 Hastily, claimeth every needy one.<br>
 An exceedingly displeased mind will not run<br>
 From (its) present course, when I am angry.<br>
 I will declare when I am in the gravel,<br>
 From the maintenance of gifts,<br>
 From being numbered, from going to be a martyr<br>
 In the reckoning of Saint Segerno.<br>
 From a word when sin may be to me,<br>
 Let there be no sigh from those that hear me.</p>
