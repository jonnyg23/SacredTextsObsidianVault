 <h3 align="CENTER">VIII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXX.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. I WILL praise the sovereign, supreme king of the land,<br>
 Who hath extended his dominion over the shore of the world.<br>
 Complete was the prison of Gweir in Caer Sidi,<br>
 Through the spite of Pwyll and Pryderi.<br>
 No one before him went into it.<br>
 The heavy blue chain held the faithful youth,<br>
 And before the spoils of Annwvn woefully he sings,<br>
 And till doom shall continue a bard of prayer.<br>
 Thrice enough to fill Prydwen, we went into it;<br>
 Except seven, none returned from Caer Sidi.</p>
 <p>II. Am I not a candidate for fame, if a song is heard?<br>
 In Caer Pedryvan, four its revolutions;<br>
 In the first word from the cauldron when spoken, <a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a><br>
 From the breath of nine maidens it was gently warmed.<br>
 Is it not the cauldron of the chief of Annwvn? What is its intention?<br>
 A ridge about its edge and pearls.<br>
 It will not boil the food of a coward, that has not been sworn,<br>
 A sword bright gleaming to him was raised,<br>
 And in the hand of Lleminawg it was left.<br>
 And before the door of the gate of Uffern the lamp was burning.<br>
 And when we went with Arthur, a splendid labour,<br>
 Except seven, none returned from Caer Vedwyd.</p>
 <p>III. Am I not a candidate for fame with the listened song<br>
 In Caer Pedryvan, in the isle of the strong door?<br>
 The twilight and pitchy darkness were mixed together.<br>
 Bright wine their liquor before their retinue.<br>
 Thrice enough to fill Prydwen we went on the sea,<br>
 Except seven, none returned from Caer Rigor.</p>
 <p>IV. I shall not deserve much from the ruler of literature,<br>
 Beyond Caer Wydyr they saw not the prowess of Arthur.<br>
 Three score Canhwr stood on the wall,<br>
 Difficult was a conversation with its sentinel.<br>
 Thrice enough to fill Prydwen there went with Arthur,<br>
 Except seven, none returned from Caer Golud.</p>
 <p>V. I shall not deserve much from those with long shields.<br>
 They know not what day, who the causer,<br>
 What hour in the serene day Cwy was born.<br>
 Who caused that he should not go to the dales of Devwy.<br>
 They know not the brindled ox, thick his head-band.<br>
 Seven score knobs in his collar.<br>
 And when we went with Arthur, of anxious memory,<br>
 Except seven, none returned from Caer Vandwy.</p>
 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>
 <p>VI. I shall not deserve much from those of loose bias,<br>
 They know not what day the chief was caused.<br>
 What hour in the serene day the owner was born.<br>
 What animal they keep, silver its head.<br>
 When we went with Arthur of anxious contention,<br>
 Except seven, none returned from Caer Ochren.</p>
 <p>VII. Monks congregate like dogs in a kennel,<br>
 From contact with their superiors they acquire knowledge,<br>
 Is one the course of the wind, is one the water of the sea?<br>
 Is one the spark of the fire, of unrestrainable tumult?<br>
 Monks congregate like wolves,<br>
 From contact with their superiors they acquire knowledge.<br>
 They know not when the deep night and dawn divide.<br>
 Nor what is the course of the wind, or who agitates it,<br>
 In what place it dies away, on what land it roars.<br>
 The grave of the saint is vanishing from the altar-tomb.<br>
 I will pray to the Lord, the great supreme,<br>
 That I be not wretched. Christ be my portion.</p>
