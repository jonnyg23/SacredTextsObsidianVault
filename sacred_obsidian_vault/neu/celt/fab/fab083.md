 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>THE fleet of Mona, the seat of misfortune,<br>
 Prevents bloodshed, with the noise of oars around her.<br>
 A greater influx will be into the Conwy on account of distress,<br>
 The men of the eagle of Eryri having fallen.<br>
 Without ardour they were in the time of heat before becoming silent, <a name="page_491"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 491</font></a><br>
 Cymry without energy against injustice.<br>
 The dragon of prediction is the son of Henri;<br>
 For a year was be desired before the assembling of hosts,<br>
 Wolf of the mighty, mighty his retainers:<br>
 10 The retinue of the world will for a time be a sign from the Invisible.<br>
 The country will be constant to the ruler of Normandi,<br>
 The bane of Prydein, there will be anxious concern because of his birth,<br>
 With a constancy like the revolving of a wheel.<br>
 Chief of bards of every region, as to thy ancient claims<br>
 I will address thee by signs.<br>
 How often dost thou communicate with the youthful hero,<br>
 The heroic youth, amiable in society?<br>
 Supremely high will be the voice of fame on the blue sea,<br>
 When the youths of Brythyon come to their privilege;<br>
 20 And Owein will be the ruler of the kingdom,<br>
 A ruddy man in the ruddy scene, the joy of Gwynedd,<br>
 Of brave ancestors, the progeny of Mervyn, the bulwark of sovereignty.<br>
 A crowned young hero, on the point of effecting deliverance.<br>
 Known to God is my wish.<br>
 That the Allmyn should commence their flight with a bloody fate,<br>
 And with destruction so precipitate, so violent, so terrible!<br>
 Extremely offensive is every naked truth, be it certain<br>
 That distracted men have come contending about towns.<br>
 A heap of ruddy carcases by the peaceless blade has been deserved; and certainly such is the case.<br>
 30 Every record, every juncture, every man, and every triumph,<br>
 Christ has conferred upon me the advantage of knowing. <a name="page_492"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 492</font></a><br>
 The Lloegrians are unfit in the conflict of blades,<br>
 An enervated rabble to contend in battle.</p>
