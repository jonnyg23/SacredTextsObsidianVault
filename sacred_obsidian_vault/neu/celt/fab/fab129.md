 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. MOUNTAIN snow--every region is white;<br>
 The raven is accustomed to sing.<br>
 No good will come from long sleeping.</p>
 <p>II. Mountain snow--white the ravine;<br>
 From the assault of the wind trees will bend.<br>
 Many a two may mutually love,<br>
 But never come together.</p>
 <p>III. Mountain snow--the wind scatters it;<br>
 Broad the moon's orb, green the dock-leaves.<br>
 The mischievous man is seldom without claim.</p>
 <p>IV. Mountain snow--fleet the hart;<br>
 Common in Prydein is a daring race.<br>
 Understanding is necessary for the alien.</p>
 <p>V. Mountain snow--the hart in the warmth;<br>
 Ducks in the pond, white the foam.<br>
 Slow is the aged, and easily overtaken.</p>
 <p>VI. Mountain snow--the hart is roaming;<br>
 The countenance smiles on whom one loves.<br>
 As long as a tale is told me,<br>
 I know where there is disgrace.</p>
 <p><a name="page_587"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 587</font></a></p>
 <p>VII. Mountain snow--the strand is white and pebbly;<br>
 The fishes in the ford may go to the cavern.<br>
 Odious is he that imposes burdens.</p>
 <p>VIII. Mountain snow--the hart in the retreat;<br>
 It is usual for a chieftain to have splendid arms,<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 And for misfortune to fall on the beard.</p>
 <p>IX. Mountain snow--the hart is plump and round;<br>
 I have said a great deal; if I am not mistaken,<br>
 This is unlike a summer day.</p>
 <p>X. Mountain snow--the hart is hunted;<br>
 The wind whistles over the eaves.<br>
 Sin is a very great heap.</p>
 <p>XI. Mountain snow--the hart is leaping;<br>
 The wind whistles over the high white wall.<br>
 It is natural the calm should be graceful.</p>
 <p>XII. Mountain snow--the hart in the vale;<br>
 The wind whistles above the house-top.<br>
 Evil will not conceal itself where it is.</p>
 <p>XIII. Mountain snow--the hart on the strand;<br>
 The aged has lost his juvenility.<br>
 . . . makes a man captive.</p>
 <p>XIV. Mountain snow--the hart in the bush;<br>
 Thoroughly black the raven; swift the young roebuck.<br>
 If one is free and healthy, it is strange there should be complaining.</p>
 <p><a name="page_588"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 588</font></a></p>
 <p>XV. Mountain snow--the hart in the rushes;<br>
 Cold the quagmire; the mead is in the brewing-tub.<br>
 The injured is accustomed to complain.</p>
 <p>XVI. Mountain snow--variegated the front of the tower;<br>
 Let the cattle seek shelter.<br>
 Woe to the wife that should get a bad husband.</p>
 <p>XVII. Mountain snow--variegated the side of the cliff;<br>
 Dried the stalk; the water-lily droops.<br>
 Woe to the man that should have a bad wife.</p>
 <p>XVIII. Mountain snow--the hart in the ditch;<br>
 Congenial to the thief is long night.<br>
 Let the bees sleep in the shelter.</p>
 <p>XIX. Mountain snow--slow is<br>
 The growth of the liverwort.<br>
 The sluggard will not soon avenge an injury.</p>
 <p>XX. Mountain snow--the fish in the lake;<br>
 Proud the hawk; people cluster around monarchs.<br>
 Every one cannot get what he wishes.</p>
 <p>XXI. Mountain snow--red the top of the fir;<br>
 Wrathful the push of many spears.<br>
 Alas, for longing, my brethren</p>
 <p>XXII. Mountain snow--swift the wolf;<br>
 The side of the desert he will penetrate.<br>
 Every blemish is common on the destitute of zeal.</p>
 <p>XXIII. Mountain snow--not slow the hart;<br>
 Rain falls from the sky.<br>
 Sorrow produces complete depression of spirits.</p>
 <p><a name="page_589"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 589</font></a></p>
 <p>XXIV. Mountain snow--noisy the roebuck;<br>
 The waves wash the margin of the strand;<br>
 Let the skilful conceal his design.</p>
 <p>XXV. Mountain snow--the hart in the glen;<br>
 Summer will be placid; calm the lake.<br>
 The gray-bearded in frost has a strong support,</p>
 <p>XXVI. Mountain snow--variegated the breast of the goose;<br>
 Strong my arm and shoulder.<br>
 I pray that I may not be a hundred years old.</p>
 <p>XXVII. Mountain snow--bare the stalk-tops;<br>
 Bent the branches of trees; the fish are in the deep.<br>
 Where there is no learning there will be no natural gift.</p>
 <p>XXVIII. Mountain snow--the fish in the ford;<br>
 Let the lean and stooping stag seek the sheltered vale.<br>
 Longing for the dead will not avail.</p>
 <p>XXIX Mountain snow--the hart in the wood;<br>
 The discreet will not walk on foot.<br>
 The timid causes many a delay.</p>
 <p>XXX. Mountain snow--the hart on the slope;<br>
 The wind whistles over the ash-tops.<br>
 A third foot for the aged is his stick.</p>
 <p>XXXI. Mountain snow--the hart is upon it;<br>
 The ducks are in the lake; white the water-lily.<br>
 The vicious is not disposed to listen.</p>
 <p><a name="page_590"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 590</font></a></p>
 <p>XXXII. Mountain snow--ruddy the feet of hens;<br>
 Shallow the water; it makes much noise.<br>
 The disgrace that is boasted of is augmented.</p>
 <p>XXXIII. Mountain snow--nimble the hart;<br>
 Hardly anything in the world interests me.<br>
 Admonition to the depraved will not avail.</p>
 <p>XXXIV. Mountain snow--white its fleece;<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .</p>
 <p>XXXV. Mountain snow--white the roofs of houses;<br>
 If the tongue were to relate what the bosom knows,<br>
 None would be neighbours.</p>
 <p>XXXVI. Mountain snow--let the wise move about in the day;<br>
 Let every pensive one be ill, every bush bare.<br>
 It is usual that the unwise should have all faults.</p>
