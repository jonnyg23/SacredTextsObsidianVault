 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XLV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>DISTURBED is the isle of the praise of Hu, the isle of the severe recompenser<br>
 Mona of the good bowls, of active manliness. The Menei its door.<br>
 I have drunk liquor of wine and bragget, from a brother departed.<br>
 The universal sovereign, the end of every king, the ruinator.<br>
 Sorrowful (is) the Dean, since the Archdeacon is interred.<br>
 There has not been, there will not be in tribulation his equal.<br>
 When Aeddon came from the country of Gwydyon, the thickly coveted Seon.<br>
 A pure poison came four nightly fine-night seasons.<br>
 The contemporaries fell, the woods were no shelter against the wind on the coast.<br>
 10 Math and Eunyd, skilful with the magic wand, freed the elements.<br>
 In the life of Gwydyon and Amaethon, there was counsel.<br>
 Pierced (is) the front of the shield of the strong, fortunate, strong irresistibly.<br>
 The powerful combination of his front rank, it was not of great account<br>
 Strong (in) feasting; in every assembly his will was done. <a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 300</font></a><br>
 Beloved he went first; while I am alive, he shall be commemorated.<br>
 May I be with Christ, so that I may not be sorrowful, when an apostle,<br>
 The generous Archdeacon amongst angels may he be contained.<br>
 Disturbed (is) the isle of the praise of Hu, the isle of the severe ruler.<br>
 Before the victorious youth, the fortress of the Cymry remained tranquil.<br>
 20 The dragon chief, a rightful proprietor in Britonia.<br>
 A sovereign is gone, alas! the chief that is gone to the earth.<br>
 Four damsels, after their lamentation, performed their office.<br>
 Very grievous truly on sea, without land, long their dwelling,<br>
 On account of his integrity (it was) that they were not satiated with distress.<br>
 I am blameable if I mention not his good actions.<br>
 In the place of Llywy, who shall prohibit, who shall order?<br>
 In the place of Aeddon, who shall support Mona's gentle authorities?<br>
 May I be with Christ, that I may not be sorrowful, for evil or good.<br>
 Share of mercy in the country of the governor of perfect life.</p>
