 <p>I WILL address my Lord,<br>
 To consider the Awen.<br>
 What brought necessity<br>
 Before the time of Ceridwen.<br>
 Primarily through my life<br>
 Poverty has been.<br>
 The wealthy monks<br>
 Why will they not speak to me?<br>
 Why will they not cause me to tremble?<br>
 10 One hour that I was not followed,<br>
 What disappearance of smoke?<br>
 Why sang he evil?<br>
 What fountain breaks out<br>
 Above the covert of darkness?<br>
 When the reed is white, <a name="page_543"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 543</font></a><br>
 When it is a moonlight night.<br>
 Another was not sung,<br>
 It was shaken out,<br>
 When is apt to be forward<br>
 20 The noise of waves on the shore.<br>
 In the vengeance of the ocean,<br>
 A day will reach to them.<br>
 When a stone is so heavy,<br>
 When a thorn is so sharp.<br>
 Knowest thou which is best?<br>
 Its base or its point,<br>
 Who caused a partition<br>
 Between man and frigidity?<br>
 Whose is the wholesomest sore?<br>
 30 The young or the old?<br>
 Knowest thou what thou art<br>
 When thou art sleeping?<br>
 Whether a body or a soul,<br>
 Or a secresy of perception?<br>
 The ingenious minstrel,<br>
 Why does he not inform me?<br>
 Knowest thou where should be<br>
 The night waiting the passing of the day?<br>
 Knowest thou a sign,<br>
 40 How many leaves there are?<br>
 Who uplifted the mountain,<br>
 Before the elements fell?<br>
 Who supports the structure<br>
 Of the earth for a habitation?<br>
 The soul of whom is complained of?<br>
 Who has seen it, who knows?<br>
 I wonder in books<br>
 That they know not truly<br>
 The soul, what is its seat. <a name="page_544"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 544</font></a><br>
 50 What form its limbs,<br>
 Through what part it pours out.<br>
 What air it respires?<br>
 A war petulant,<br>
 A sinner endangered.<br>
 A wonder in mockery,<br>
 What were its dregs.<br>
 Which is the best intoxication,<br>
 Of mead or of bragget?<br>
 When their happiness<br>
 60 Was protected by the God of Trinity<br>
 Why should I utter a treatise,<br>
 Except of thee?<br>
 Who caused coin<br>
 Of current silver?<br>
 When is so current<br>
 A ear so prickly;<br>
 Death having a foundation,<br>
 In every country is shared.<br>
 Death above our head,<br>
 70 Wide is its covering,<br>
 High above the canopy of heaven.<br>
 Man is oldest when he is born.<br>
 And is younger (and) younger continually,<br>
 What is there to be anxious about,<br>
 Of the present attainment?<br>
 After a want of property,<br>
 Does it not make to us a shortness of life?<br>
 Enough of sadness,<br>
 The visitation of the grave.<br>
 80 And the One that made us,<br>
 From the supreme country,<br>
 Be he our God, and bring us<br>
 To him at the end!</p>
