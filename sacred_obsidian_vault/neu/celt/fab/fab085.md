 <p align="CENTER">I.</p>
 <p>CHRIST JESUS! who art in complete possession of light,<br>
 The strength of the feeble Christian in the gloom;<br>
 Christ, the mysterious One! in order to produce seriousness<br>
 May utterance be given to my bardic lays;<br>
 May my bards, when they chant, be attended to;<br>
 May my bardic word from the golden chair be kept;<br>
 May my poem above books be read.<br>
 As a canon by him who chants the Paternoster.<br>
 Believe in God, and God will not reject thee;<br>
 10 Believe! from his court no vanity will affect thee;<br>
 Believe that He suffered on a Friday,<br>
 And that He arose to overcome a host.<br>
 From the mutual sullenness of royal chiefs a tumult shall be heard;<br>
 By virtue of unity, the compact of Rosser,<br>
 May the Saxons hasten away before distress!<br>
 On the borders a standing army will be complained of.<br>
 Unprofitable Maelenydd will be molested, <a name="page_494"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 494</font></a><br>
 Lawless, with rights, without a Caer.<br>
 20 Around the land of Mael a long battle will be heard;<br>
 Around the banks of Gwyran there will be a gory scene;<br>
 Around Buallt eager will be the tumult at the close of day,<br>
 Beards in flight from mortal cowardice.<br>
 Around Aber Cammarch may be greeted<br>
 The chief, the joy of his retinue.<br>
 Then will the poet be free from anxiety,<br>
 From celebrating the completion of splendid actions,<br>
 From the primitive language, penance, and paternosters,<br>
 From the value of respect when thou art addressed.<br>
 30 Ask of the Supreme Being, from the depth of adoration,<br>
 Of adoration, success from above the light,<br>
 To the steel against Lloegyr which corrupts the paternoster,<br>
 To his friends, his flag, and his standard.<br>
 A man from concealment, prompt, brave, and wrathful,<br>
 Will appear, to command a multitude;<br>
 He will cause terror at the commencement,<br>
 And easily break the boundary on a Friday,<br>
 Friday: believe it is no falshood.<br>
 The Saxons will retreat from his oppression over the country.<br>
 40 About Aber Cammarch there will be ignominy,<br>
 Excessive tumult, shouting, blades, and men in battle-array.<br>
 And a splendid banner, it is no error,<br>
 And a dragon causing the death of a leader:<br>
 Lloegrians will be uttering doleful lamentations,<br>
 And men in the dire shout bewailing their brains.<br>
 A man over Lloegyr which corrupts religion,<br>
 Will come to command his army;<br>
 He will cause a happy beginning.<br>
 For a long time, as regards the land, he will disappear,<br>
 50 The hero of a disturbed country.<br>
 There will be a mutual sharpening of blades, a mutual havoc concerning baptism. <a name="page_495"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 495</font></a><br>
 It will be time like doomsday; and gifts will be given to the poet,<br>
 The action will be heard all over the land.<br>
 His driving and impelling forces will have no end.<br>
 His gifts, according to established rights, he will pour forth.<br>
 Let us deserve and love Caer Leriydd,<br>
 Because of the voice of Cod whose favour is unfeigned.<br>
 Until we shall have been long through.<br>
 60 Purity is a state of freedom from frailty.<br>
 Precious will be the gifts of baptism from my Lord,<br>
 Seek mercy, for fear of the element of discord.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">II.</p>
 <p>Around Buallt the troops of the public host<br>
 Cause a tumult: there is complaint for each destruction.<br>
 When disbanded let the hordes of Henri fly.<br>
 Obscure is the top of the Caer where ruins meet.<br>
 Alun, the foremost in beauty, is all commotion,<br>
 Dispersion, ruin, and disgrace are all over it:<br>
 70 The slaughter shocks one when thou relatest it;<br>
 To relate its severe loss thou canst not,<br>
 From the contention of a baron of short co-operation,<br>
 There will be a white corpse, without head, without beauty,<br>
 There will be spare horses, worthless to be destroyed.<br>
 And men with unfriendly looks about Ceri,<br>
 And loud uproar, and thrusting, and shouting,<br>
 And groaning in every . . .<br>
 Actively will the sons of Cymry call upon Dewi<br>
 Who loveth peace and mercy . . .</p>
 <p align="CENTER">III.</p>
 <p>80 Fellow-ranger of the green woods!<br>
 Painful, piercing grief affects me.<br>
 Conflicts are pangs of anguish to the upright. <a name="page_496"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 496</font></a><br>
 The life of a man is pursued like that of a wretch,<br>
 By the strong ones of Lloegyr who corrupt equity.<br>
 Let us meet them and see their death!<br>
 The union of Saxons is but for a night;<br>
 Of ignoble descent they are in the banquet of mead;<br>
 They make compacts without mutual entertainment and sociality;<br>
 And break them with a violent rupture:<br>
 90 Barons whose co-operation is of short duration.<br>
 And the ruler of what land in Gwyned, inferior in speech,<br>
 Can relate the fatigue and trouble of pursuing them?<br>
 Look if you can see any paltry spoil.<br>
 The tumult of slaughter is heard again.<br>
 Let reparation be made if there is military law.<br>
 It is peaceless treachery if a man is to be denied the hope<br>
 Of being brought to God at once.<br>
 Hosts get rich on full march.<br>
 A plaintiff is strong while investigating his claim.<br>
 100 A man was killed by an unlucky obstruction.<br>
 True, it is incumbent on the innocent to die,<br>
 But it is a disgrace before God to cause his death.<br>
 There is a deliverer ten times to the brave.<br>
 God will be pleased when every language shall have ceased.<br>
 Health by means of penance is a painful restriction.<br>
 May he give us through hope,<br>
 In the end, mercy through a just compact! Amen.</p>
