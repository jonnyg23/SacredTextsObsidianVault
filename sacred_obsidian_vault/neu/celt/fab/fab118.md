 <p>AND God the possessor, God the regulator, merciful diviner,<br>
 Great., wonderful, when thou protectedst me through the wave.<br>
 The hosts of Moses, sovereign Lord, woe their dispersion!<br>
 Pharaoh and his host perceived them, cursing the cause,<br>
 And to sea thou madest new the cause.<br>
 Did he not allure them through an inundation that drowns birds?<br>
 From where the sun rises to the west there was land.<br>
 Thou wouldst protect those that thou lovest from every prison<br>
 Except hosts, vehement their shout, heavy their din.<br>
 10 And protect us also from the miseries of Uffern fierce.<br>
 And God the possessor, God the regulator, merciful diviner,<br>
 Thine is the country of heaven, it is in peace that thou lovest.<br>
 There is not weariness, nor want in thy country, Lord.<br>
 No one will be ordered; no one will be an enemy to another.<br>
 I would have known, if I had understood, for shame,<br>
 That thou lovest, the Holy Trinity, any one that is skilful.<br>
 Bards disparage you; they love much for ever.<br>
 That was not vile, the Israel which thou placedst in the hand of David.<br>
 Alexander had a large number of men.<br>
 20 He would not have been strong, had he not thy friendship,<br>
 With his armies and great battles and his tortuous hosts.<br>
 When they came to the land they were sad in their death. <a name="page_564"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 564</font></a><br>
 Solomon the judge contained the land, he was better than they.<br>
 Son of kings. He was accustomed to riches for his auxiliary.<br>
 The sons of Jacob were rich on their land;<br>
 What they liked, they shared according to the word of the Lord.<br>
 Abel, innocent, was prosperous, and took the faith,<br>
 His brother Cain was headstrong, evil his counsel.<br>
 Aser and Soyw in the clear air, their co-operators.<br>
 30 A star-angel conducteth a number before their warriors,<br>
 With the wand of Moses, him and his hosts on their land.<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 The talkative and dumb and wise and bold were redressed,<br>
 Ruler protect, one protection to those that deserve death.<br>
 I also will praise the abode of hosts, the dwelling of blessedness,<br>
 I also will praise the best repository that overflows the world.<br>
 The chief kingdom that Jonah brought from the centre of junction,<br>
 The nation of Nineveh, he was a man that joyfully preached.<br>
 Queens over sea had the shadow of the Lord, that protected them,<br>
 40 And Maria Mary, daughter of Anna, great her penitence.<br>
 Through thy generosity and mercy, King of the world!<br>
 May there be to us, in the cities of heaven, admission to thee.</p>
