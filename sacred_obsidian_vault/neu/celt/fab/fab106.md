 <h3 align="CENTER">THE CHAIR OF TALIESSIN.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XIII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">Text, vol. ii. p. 151. Notes, vol. ii. p. 403.</p>
 <p>I AM the agitator<br>
 Of the praise of God the Ruler.<br>
 With respect to the concerns of song,<br>
 The requisites of a profound speaker,<br>
 A bard, with the breast of an astrologer.<br>
 When he recites<br>
 The Awen at the setting in of the evening.<br>
 On the fine night of a fine day.<br>
 Bards loquacious the light will separate.<br>
 10 Their praise will not bring me to associate,<br>
 In the strath, on the course<br>
 With aspect of great cunning.<br>
 I am not a mute artist,<br>
 Conspicuous among the bards of the people.<br>
 I animate the bold,<br>
 I influence the heedless<br>
 I wake up the looker on,<br>
 The enlightener of bold kings.<br>
 I am not a shallow artist,<br>
 20 Conspicuous among kindred bards,<br>
 The likeness of a subtle portion,<br>
 The deep ocean (is) suitable.<br>
 Who has filled me with hatred? <a name="page_534"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 534</font></a><br>
 A prize in every unveiling,<br>
 When the dew is undisturbed,<br>
 And the wheat is reaped,<br>
 And the bees are gentle,<br>
 And myrrh and frankincense,<br>
 And transmarine aloes.<br>
 30 And the golden pipes of Lleu,<br>
 And a curtain of excellent silver,<br>
 And a ruddy gem, and berries.<br>
 And the foam of the sea.<br>
 Why will the fountain hasten<br>
 Water-cresses of purifying juicy quality?<br>
 What will join together the common people?<br>
 Wort, the nobility of liquor.<br>
 And a load that the moon separates<br>
 The placid gentleness of Merlyn.<br>
 40 And philosophers of intelligence<br>
 Will study about the moon.<br>
 And the influence of an order of men,<br>
 Exposed to the breeze of the sky.<br>
 And a soddening and effusion,<br>
 And a portion after effusion,<br>
 And the coracle of glass<br>
 In the hand of the pilgrim,<br>
 And the valiant one and pitch,<br>
 And the honoured Segyrffyg,<br>
 50 And medical plants.<br>
 A place of complete benefit,<br>
 And bards and blossoms.<br>
 And gloomy bushes,<br>
 And primroses and small herbs,<br>
 And the points of the tree-shrubs.<br>
 And deficiency and possession,<br>
 And frequent pledging. <a name="page_535"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 535</font></a><br>
 And wine overflowing the brim,<br>
 From Rome to Rossed.<br>
 60 And deep still water,<br>
 Its stream the gift of God.<br>
 Or if it will be wood the purifier,<br>
 Fruitful its increase.<br>
 Let the brewer give a heat,<br>
 Over a cauldron of-five trees,<br>
 And the river of Gwiawn,<br>
 And the influence of fine weather,<br>
 And honey and trefoil,<br>
 And mead-horns intoxicating<br>
 70 Pleasing to a sovereign,<br>
 The gift of the Druids.</p>
