 <p>HAIL, glorious Lord!<br>
 May church and chancel bless Thee!'<br>
 And chancel and church!<br>
 And plain and precipice!<br>
 And the three fountains there are,<br>
 Two above wind, and one above the earth,<br>
 May darkness and light bless Thee!<br>
 And fine silk and sweet trees!<br>
 Abraham the chief of faith did bless Thee.<br>
 10 And life eternal.<br>
 And birds find bees.<br>
 And old and young.<br>
 Aaron and Moses did bless Thee.<br>
 And male and female.<br>
 And the seven days and the stars.<br>
 And the air and the ether.<br>
 And books and letters.<br>
 And fish in the flowing water.<br>
 And song and deed.<br>
 20 And sand and sward.<br>
 And such as were satisfied with good.<br>
 I will bless Thee, glorious Lord!<br>
          Hail, glorious Lord!</p>
