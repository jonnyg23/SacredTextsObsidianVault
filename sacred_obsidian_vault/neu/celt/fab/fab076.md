 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. TRULY there will be to me a Roman friend.<br>
 Possibly from the son of another man he will cause<br>
 Before him that he heard the expanding tumult.<br>
 And an army and flow of blood on his enemy.<br>
 And let horses sound, and the multitude (be) merciful.<br>
 They would cut, they would greatly assemble in the sword of conflict.<br>
 Ravens and eagles adore blood.<br>
 The ruddy path of the violent bear is fearless.<br>
 Let Cadwaladyr rise ardent and gleaming<br>
 On the face of the embattled hosts of vigorous countries.</p>
 <p>II. Truly there will be to me a day-share of frailties,<br>
 A vow of prophecy in the first beginning.<br>
 Years victorious, an excess of extensive rights.<br>
 When winter overspreads, sharp the steering of ships.<br>
 Confined the flow of harmony, courteous, respiring.<br>
 Glorious the appearance of the torrent on the top of the waves.<br>
 The swans resort round the morsel on the face of the surges.<br>
 Bear and lion empty the bright pools.<br>
 The boundary depends upon crimson spears.<br>
 Too much is sought chastisement, a caution to the fronts.<br>
 Before his ranks and great possessions,<br>
 Creeds fall, collars are broken by the crowds in front.<br>
 To the combat of Cadwaladyr, of splendidly-read fame,<br>
 There arose a dragon from the south,<br>
 By a free youth he was slain on a Thursday.</p>
 <p><a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 445</font></a></p>
 <p>III. Truly there will be to me bounteous heroism,<br>
 A royal eulogy of fame of great abundance.<br>
 A path thick, abundant, broad its form.<br>
 Until there be seven languages to the king of Gwynedd,<br>
 Until exhausting tumult passes away,<br>
 A king fond of a sleepless covering,<br>
 Violence on Angles, and a journey to banishment,<br>
 Through a sea will glide their offspring.</p>
 <p>IV. Truly there will be to me one having a right to Mona.<br>
 Glorious the protection of the dragon to the people of the Brython.<br>
 Chief of armies, a respecter of breastplated men.<br>
 Deep, the prophecy divine of the Druids.<br>
 They would pitch their tents on Tren and Taranhon.<br>
 They would lie in ambush, to take Mona.<br>
 Far to go away be it a length from Iwerdon.<br>
 Fair the honour to liberate the Cæsarians.</p>
 <p>V. Predict a scene of unlovely discord.<br>
 I know when a battle was caused over wine and mead<br>
 A bear from Deheubarth barking at Gwynedd.<br>
 Defending too long wonderful superfluity.<br>
 Its fortified uplands were prepared,<br>
 On the calends of winter placing lands.<br>
 The mutual reflection on shields in the shout of the sword,<br>
 To the combat of Cadwaladyr on the lord of Gwynedd.</p>
 <p>VI. Truly it will come, this will come to pass.<br>
 All Lloegyr will lose their possessions by us.<br>
 Seeing the aspects of the speckled white men,<br>
 Between the shafts of arrows and white iron,<br>
 A shouting on the sea, a lance-darting trembling of slaughter-- <a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 446</font></a><br>
 They will languish in the ocean, beyond the broad lake,<br>
 Sea and isles will be their gain.</p>
 <p>VII. Truly there will come to me from beyond Hafren<br>
 Repelled of Prydein, a king of destiny.<br>
 A mild ruler of armies, numerous his progeny.<br>
 A kingdom suitable, hateful from ice.<br>
 The common people of the world truly will be joyful.<br>
 They possess energies, a tribe of rich men.<br>
 The flash flamed over the region of Hafren.<br>
 Let the Cymry be collected splendidly<br>
 To the combat of Cadwaladyr; be joyful<br>
 The chief minstrels with the glory of the battle.</p>
 <p>VIII. Truly he will come<br>
 With his host and ships,<br>
 And searing shields,<br>
 And changing lances,<br>
 And after a valiant shout,<br>
 His will will be done.<br>
 May the circle of Prydein<br>
 Be enflamed there.<br>
 The dragon will not hide himself,<br>
 However many may come.<br>
 Not light the praise<br>
 Of conquering Dyved.<br>
 He will bear likewise<br>
 Over the effusions of Reged.<br>
 The creator, possessor of treasure,<br>
 Generous, daring his flow,<br>
 Immense his battle.<br>
 By airing the skin<br>
 Of Cadwaladyr, an active work.</p>
