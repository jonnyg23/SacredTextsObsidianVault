 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IN the name of the Lord, mine to adore, whose praise is great.<br>
 I will praise the great Ruler, whose blessing is great on an alms-deed;<br>
 The God that defends us, the God that made us, the God that will deliver us,<br>
 The God of our hope, blessed, perfect, and pure is his true happiness.<br>
 God owns us; God is above, the Triune King,<br>
 God has been felt a support to us in affliction;<br>
 God has been, by being imprisoned, in humility.<br>
 May the blessed Ruler make us free against the day of doom,<br>
 And bring us to the feast, for the sake of his meekness and lowliness,<br>
 10 And happily receive us into Paradise from the burden of sin,<br>
 And give us salvation, for the sake of his agony and five wounds,<br>
 Terrible anguish! God delivered us when he assumed flesh.<br>
 Man would have been lost, had He not ransomed him, according to his glorious ordinance.<br>
 From the bloody Cross came redemption to the whole world.<br>
 Christ the mighty Shepherd, his merits will never fail.</p>
