 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>A SKILFUL composition, the pattern being from God,<br>
 A composition, the language, beautiful and pleasant, from Christ.<br>
 And should there be a language all complete around the sun,<br>
 On as many pivots as there are under the sea,<br>
 On as many winged ones as the Almighty made,<br>
 And should every one have thrice three hundred tongues,<br>
 They could not relate the power of the Trinity.<br>
 A diligent man in prosperity will receive no punishment.<br>
 Let communion be ready against the Trinity.<br>
 10 Let him be ill and ailing when his flesh becomes weak,<br>
 That he may puff his disguise.<br>
 Woe to thee, man of passion; if the world were given me,<br>
 Unless thou wert to deliver thyself, thou wouldst be satiated of the evil.<br>
 Art thou not at liberty as regards what thy mind loves?<br>
 Furious thy violent death, thy being borne on the wattled frame;<br>
 More wretched thy end, thy interment in the grave,<br>
 And being trodden by feet in the midst of soil and sod.<br>
 Unequalled thy journey, thy separation from thy companions.<br>
 Faithless and useless body, think of thy soul!<br>
 20 Body, thou wouldst not hear when others spoke. <a name="page_505"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 505</font></a><br>
 What gavest thou of thy wealth before private confession?<br>
 What gavest thou of thy riches before the close and silent pit?<br>
 And what thou hadst intended, thou hast left undone<br>
 And thou sawest not how many thou shouldst have loved.<br>
 And a benefit it would have been as regards the passions of the people.<br>
 And the good would have come to so much prosperity.<br>
 When thou of thy freedom purchasest a hundred things, they are uncertain,<br>
 And vanish as suddenly as the motion of eyelid.<br>
 Hast thou noticed that they love sinisterly while seeking violence?<br>
 30 Thou respectedst not Friday, of thy great humility<br>
 Thou chantedst not a paternoster at matins or vespers,<br>
 A paternoster, the chief thing to be repeated: meditate on nothing<br>
 Except the Trinity.<br>
 Thou shouldst pay what is equal to three seven paternosters daily.<br>
 What has been and is not, and their life has not passed away.<br>
 Thou art more accustomed to the roaring of the sea than to the preaching of the evangel.<br>
 Must thou not go to the pile, because thou hast not been humble?<br>
 Thou respectedst neither relies, nor altars, nor churches.<br>
 Thou didst not attend to the strains of bards of harmonious utterance.<br>
 40 Thou didst not respect the law of the Creator of heaven before death.<br>
 A strange mixture didst thou employ in thy speech.<br>
 Woe is me that I went with thee to our joint work!<br>
 Woe is me when I am about to praise thee! <a name="page_506"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 506</font></a><br>
 When I came to thee, small was my evil,<br>
 But it came to me from thy grovelling co-operation.<br>
 As for them, none will believe us respecting thy appearance of enjoyment.</p>
