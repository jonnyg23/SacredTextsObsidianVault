 <p align="CENTER">I.</p>
 <p>I. THE first word that I will utter<br>
 In the morning when I get up,<br>
 "May the Cross of Christ be as a vesture around me."</p>
 <p>II. What belongs to my Creator I will put on<br>
 To-day, in one house will I attend.<br>
 He is not a God in whom I will not believe.</p>
 <p>III. I will dress myself handsomely,<br>
 And believe in no omen which is not certain;<br>
 He that created me will strengthen me.</p>
 <p>IV. I have a mind to see sights,<br>
 Intending to go to sea;<br>
 May a useful purpose become a treasure!</p>
 <p>V. I have a mind for all advice,<br>
 Intending to go to sea;<br>
 May the purpose be useful, Lord!</p>
 <p>VI. Let the raven uplift its wing,<br>
 With the intention of going far away;<br>
 May a useful purpose become better!</p>
 <p>VII. Let the raven uplift its wing,<br>
 With. the intention of going to Rome;<br>
 May a useful purpose become glorious!</p>

 <p>VIII. Saddle thou the bayard with the white bridle,<br>
 To course Hiraethawg with its quaking grass:<br>
 Creator of Heaven! God must be with us!</p>
 <p>IX. Saddle thou the bayard with the short hair,<br>
 Free in the conflict, quick in his pace;<br>
 Where the nose is, there will be snorting.</p>
 <p>X. Saddle thou the bayard with the long bound,<br>
 Free in the conflict, pleasing in his pace;<br>
 The sneering of the vicious will not check the brave.</p>
 <p>XI. Heavy the consistence of the earth, thick leaves its cover;<br>
 Bitter the drinking-horn of sweet mead;<br>
 Creator of Heaven! prosper my business!</p>
 <p>XII. From the progeny of the sovereign and victor,<br>
 Gwosprid, and Peter chief of every language,<br>
 Saint Ffraid, bless us on our journey!</p>
 <p>XIII. Thou, Sun, to him intercession and vows are made,<br>
 Lord, Christ the Mysterious, the pillar of beneficence!<br>
 May I make satisfaction for my sin and actions.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">II.</p>
 <p>I asked to secular priests,<br>
 To their bishops and their judges,<br>
 "What is the best thing for the soul?"<br>
 The Paternoster, and consecrated wafers, and a holy<br>
 Creed, he who sings them for his soul,<br>
 Until the judgment will be accustomed to the best thing.<br>
 Smooth the way as thou goest, and cultivate peace,<br>
 And to thee there will be no end of mercy.<br>
 Give food to the hungry and clothes to the naked, <a name="page_521"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 521</font></a><br>
 10 And say thy devotions:<br>
 From the presence of devils thou hast escaped.<br>
 The proud and the idle have pain in their flesh,<br>
 The reward of going to excess:<br>
 Beware of sifting what is not pure.<br>
 Excess of sleep, and excess of drunkenness, and too much beverage<br>
 Of mead, and too much submission to the flesh,<br>
 These are six bitter things against the judgment.<br>
 For perjury in respect of land, and the betrayment of a lord,<br>
 And the scandalising of the bounteous,<br>
 20 At the day of judgment let there be repentance.<br>
 By rising to matins and nocturns,<br>
 Awaking, and interceding with the saints,<br>
 Shall every Christian obtain forgiveness.</p>
