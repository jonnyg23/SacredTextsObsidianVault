 <p>GUESS who it is.<br>
 Created before the deluge.<br>
 A creature strong,<br>
 Without flesh, without bone,<br>
 Without veins, without blood,<br>
 Without head, and without feet.<br>
 It will not be older, it will not be younger,<br>
 Than it was in the beginning.<br>
 There will not come from his design<br>
 10 Fear or death.<br>
 He has no wants<br>
 From creatures.<br>
 Great God! the sea whitens <a name="page_536"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 536</font></a><br>
 When it comes from the beginning.<br>
 Great his beauties,<br>
 The one that made him.<br>
 He, in the field, he, in the wood,<br>
 Without hand and without foot.<br>
 Without old age, without age.<br>
 20 Without the most jealous destiny<br>
 And he (is) coeval<br>
 With the five periods of the five ages.<br>
 And also is older,<br>
 Though there be five hundred thousand years.<br>
 And he is as wide<br>
 As the face of the earth,<br>
 And he was not born,<br>
 And he has not been seen.<br>
 He, on sea, he, on land,<br>
 30 He sees not, he is not seen.<br>
 He is not sincere,<br>
 He will not come when it is wished.<br>
 He, on land, he, on sea,<br>
 He is indispensable,<br>
 He is unconfined,<br>
 He is unequalled.<br>
 He from four regions,<br>
 He will not be according to counsel.<br>
 He commences his journey<br>
 40 From above the stone of marble.<br>
 He is loud-voiced, he is mute.<br>
 He is uncourteous.<br>
 He is vehement, he is bold,<br>
 When he glances over the land.<br>
 He is mute, he is loud-voiced.<br>
 He is blustering.<br>
 Greatest, his banner <a name="page_537"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 537</font></a><br>
 On the face of the earth.<br>
 He is good, he is bad,<br>
 50 He is not bright,<br>
 He is not manifest,<br>
 For the sight does not see (him).<br>
 He is bad, he is good.<br>
 He is yonder, he is here,<br>
 He will disorder.<br>
 He will not repair what he does<br>
 And he sinless,<br>
 He is wet, he is dry,<br>
 He comes frequently<br>
 60 From the heat of the sun, and the coldness of the moon.<br>
 The moon is without benefit,<br>
 Because less, her heat.<br>
 One Person has made it,<br>
 All the creatures.<br>
 He owns the beginning<br>
 And the end without falsehood.<br>
 Not skilful, the minstrel<br>
 That praises not the Lord.<br>
 Not true, the songster<br>
 70 That praises not the Father.<br>
 Not usual will a plough be<br>
 Without iron, without seed.<br>
 There was not a light<br>
 Before the creation of heaven;<br>
 There will not be a priest,<br>
 That will not bless the wafer;<br>
 The perverse will not know<br>
 The seven faculties.<br>
 Ten countries were provided,<br>
 80 In the angelic country. <a name="page_538"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 538</font></a><br>
 The tenth were discarded,<br>
 They loved not their Father.<br>
 A loveless shower<br>
 In utter ruin.<br>
 Llucufer the corrupter,<br>
 Like his destitute country<br>
 Seven stars there are,<br>
 Of the seven gifts of the Lord.<br>
 The student of the stars<br>
 90 Knows their substance.<br>
 Marca mercedus<br>
 Ola olimus<br>
 Luna lafurus<br>
 Jubiter venerus<br>
 From the sun freely flowing<br>
 The moon fetches light.<br>
 Remembrance is not in vain,<br>
 No cross if not believed.<br>
 Our Father! Our Father!<br>
 100 Our relative and companion.<br>
 Our Sovereign, we shall not be separated.<br>
 By the host of Llucufer.</p>
