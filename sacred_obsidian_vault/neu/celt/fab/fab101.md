 <h3 align="CENTER">LXXXVI.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XXVI.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. BLACK thy horse, black thy cope,<br>
 Black thy head, black thyself,<br>
 Yes, black I art thou Yscolan?</p>
 <p>II. I am Yscolan the scholar,<br>
 Slight is my clouded reason,<br>
 There is no drowning the woe of him who offends a sovereign.</p>
 <p>III. For having burnt a church, and destroyed the cattle of a school,<br>
 And caused a book to be submerged,<br>
 My penance is a heavy affliction.</p>
 <p>IV. Creator of the creatures, of supports<br>
 The greatest, pardon me my iniquity!<br>
 He who betrayed Thee, deceived me.</p>
 <p>V. A full year was given me<br>
 At Bangor on the pole of a weir;<br>
 Consider thou my suffering from sea-worms.</p>
 <p>VI. If I knew what I now know<br>
 As plain as the wind in the top branches of waving trees,<br>
 What I did I should never have done.</p>
