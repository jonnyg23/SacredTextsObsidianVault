 <p>MAY God exalt over the community of Brython<br>
 The sign of gladness of a host from Mona,<br>
 There is a contention among the active patriots of Gwynedd.<br>
 Of bright radiancy, from every battle to have pledges,.<br>
 Powys will become grave in embraces.<br>
 Men, great-craving, will act on their laws.<br>
 Two hosts will go, they will be consonant.<br>
 Of one disposition, of one word, harmonious, compact.<br>
 They will divide justly the people of Ceredigiawn.<br>
 10 When thou seest men few about Llyn Aeron.<br>
 When will be heavy Tywi and Teivi rivers,<br>
 They will make battle in haste about Llys Llonion. <a name="page_433"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 433</font></a><br>
 What he saw he left over-laden.<br>
 He protected not cities from indignations.<br>
 A man warm, a man that guards, a man of impulse.<br>
 He was not an utterly clownish man, Rieddon.<br>
 When Cadwallawn came<br>
 Over the ocean of Iwerdon,<br>
 He regulated heaven as high creator.<br>
 20 Songsters, soon may I hear their cares,<br>
 An army of horsemen so harassing about Caer Llion,<br>
 And the revenge of Idwal on Aranwynyon,<br>
 And playing at ball with heads of Saxons.<br>
 There will be troubled the Cat Vreith and its strange language,<br>
 From the ford at Taradyr, as far as Porth Wygyr in Mona.<br>
 A youth brought them to Dinas Maon.<br>
 From the time when is defended the honey and clover<br>
 They leave their noise and contention,<br>
 30 Not unpledged to raise anger against enemies.<br>
 May God exalt over the community of Brython.</p>
