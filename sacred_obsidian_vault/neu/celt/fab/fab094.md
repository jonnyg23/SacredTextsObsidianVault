 <p align="CENTER">Text, vol. ii. p. 10. Notes, vol. ii. p. 330.</p>
 <p>LET God be praised in the beginning and the end.<br>
 Who supplicates Him, He will neither despise nor refuse.<br>
 The only son of Mary, the great exemplar of kings,<br>
 Mary, the mother of Christ, the praise of women.<br>
 The sun will come from the East to the North.<br>
 Intercede, for thy great mercy's sake,<br>
 With thy Son, the glorious object of our love,<br>
 God above us, God before us, God possessing (all things).<br>
 May the Father of Heaven grant us a portion of mercy;<br>
 10 Puissant Sovereign, may there be peace between us without refusal;<br>
 May we reform and make satisfaction for our transgressions,<br>
 Before I go to the earth to my fresh grave,<br>
 In the dark without a candle to my tribunal,<br>
 To my narrow abode, to the limits assigned to me, to my repose;<br>
 After my horse, and indulgence in fresh mead,<br>
 And social feasting, and gallantry with women.<br>
 I will not sleep; I will meditate on my end.<br>
 We are in a state the wantonness of which is sad;<br>
 Like leaves from the top of trees it will vanish away.<br>
 20 Woe to the niggard that hoards up precious things;<br>
 And unless the Supreme Father will support him,<br>
 Though he is allowed to have his course in the present world, his end will be dangerous.<br>
 He knows not what it is to be brave, yet will he not tremble in his present state; <a name="page_509"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 509</font></a><br>
 He will not rise up in the morning, will utter no greeting, nor will he sit;<br>
 He will not sing joyfully nor ask for mercy.<br>
 Bitter will, in the end, be the retribution<br>
 Of haughtiness, arrogance, and restlessness.<br>
 He pampers his body for toads and snakes<br>
 And lions, and conceives iniquity.<br>
 30 And death will come upon hoary age;<br>
 He is insatiable in the assembly and in the banquet.<br>
 Old age will draw nigh, and spreads itself over thee.<br>
 Thy ear, thy sight, thy teeth, they will not return;<br>
 The skin of thy fingers will wrinkle,<br>
 And age and hoariness will affect thee.<br>
 May Michael make intercession for us, that the Father of heaven may dispense us His mercy!<br>
 The beginning of summer is a most pleasant season, tuneful the birds, green the stalks of plants,<br>
 Ploughs are in the furrow, oxen in the yoke,<br>
 Green is the sea, variegated the land.<br>
 40 When cuckoos sing on the branches of pleasant trees,<br>
 May my joyfulness become greater.<br>
 Smoke is painful, sleeplessness is manifest.<br>
 Since my friends are returned to their former state<br>
 In the hill, in the dale, in the islands of the sea,<br>
 In every direction that one goes, in the presence of the blessed Christ there is no terror.<br>
 It was our desire, our friend, our trespass<br>
 To penetrate into the land of thy banishment.<br>
 Seven saints and seven score and seven hundred did he pierce in one convention.<br>
 With Christ the blessed they sustain. no apprehension of evil.<br>
 50 A gift I will ask, may it not be refused me by the God of peace. <a name="page_510"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 510</font></a><br>
 Since there is a way to the gate of the Supreme Father,<br>
 Christ, may I not be sad before thy throne!</p>
