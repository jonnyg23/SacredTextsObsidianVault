 <p>URIEN of the cultivated plain,<br>
 The most generous man of baptism,<br>
 Abundance has been given<br>
 To the men of earth.<br>
 As it has been gathered,<br>
 It has been scattered.<br>
 Joyful the bards of baptism<br>
 Whilst thy life continues.<br>
 There is greater joy<br>
 10 For the high-famed, and liberal of praise. <a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a><br>
 It is greater glory,<br>
 That Urien and his children should exist.<br>
 And he especially<br>
 The supreme Guledig.<br>
 In a distant city,<br>
 A principal pilgrim,<br>
 The Lloegrians know him,<br>
 When they converse.<br>
 Death they had,<br>
 20 And frequent vexation,<br>
 Burning their homesteads,<br>
 And drawing their coverings.<br>
 And loss,<br>
 And great incomprehension,<br>
 Without obtaining deliverance<br>
 From Urien Reged.<br>
 The protector of Reged,<br>
 The praise of Ior, the anchor of the country.<br>
 My inclination is on thee,<br>
 30 Of every hearing.<br>
 Heavy thy spear-throwing,<br>
 When the battle is heard,<br>
 When they resort to battle,<br>
 A smarting is made.<br>
 Fire in houses before day,<br>
 Before the sovereign of the cultivated plain,<br>
 The most fair cultivated plain,<br>
 And its most generous men.<br>
 The Angles are accustomed to be without homage<br>
 40 From most valiant king.<br>
 A most valiant progeny,<br>
 Thine is the best.<br>
 Of those who have been, or will be,<br>
 There is not thy match. <a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 346</font></a><br>
 When he is looked upon,<br>
 Very great is the terror.<br>
 It is usual to look for him,<br>
 For an active king.<br>
 Around him a modest demeanour,<br>
 50 And the varied multitude,<br>
 The splendid prince of the North,<br>
 The choicest of princes.<br>
 And when I fail in age,<br>
 In the sore necessity of death,<br>
 May I not be smiling,<br>
 If I praise not Urien.</p>
