 <p>I. How sad with me, how sad!<br>
 Have Cedwyv and Cadvan perished?<br>
 Glaring and tumultuous was the slaughter;<br>
 Perforated was the shield from Trywruyd.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</p>
 <p>II. It was Maelgwn that I saw combating,<br>
 His household before the tumult of the host is not silent.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">MYRDIN.</p>
 <p>III. Before two men in Nevtur will they land,<br>
 Before Errith and Gurrith on a pale white horse.<br>
 The slender bay they will undoubtedly bear away.<br>
 Soon will his retinue be seen with Elgan.<br>
 Alas for his death! a great journey they came.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</p>
 <p>IV. Rys, the one-toothed, a span was his shield;<br>
 Even to thee has complete prosperity come.<br>
 Cyndur has been slain; beyond measure they deplore;<br>
 Men that were generous while they lived have been slain;<br>
 Three men of note, whose. esteem was great with Elgan.</p>
 <p><a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 369</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">MYRDIN.</p>
 <p>V. Through and through, in excess and excess they came,<br>
 From yonder and yonder there came to me Bran and Melgan;<br>
 Slay, in their last conflict, Diwel<br>
 The son of Erbin, and his men, they did.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</p>
 <p>VI. The host of Maelgwn, it was fortunate that they came--<br>
 Slaughtering men of battle, penetrating the gory plain,<br>
 Even the action of Ardderyd, when there will be a crisis,<br>
 Continually for the hero they will prepare.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">MYRDIN.</p>
 <p>VII. A host of flying darts, reeking will be the gory plain;<br>
 A host of. warriors, vigorous and active will they be;<br>
 A host, when wounds will be given, a host, when flight will take place,<br>
 A host, when they will return to the combat.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</p>
 <p>VIII. The seven sons of Eliffer, seven heroes when put to proof,<br>
 They will not avoid seven spears in their seven divisions.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">MYRDIN.</p>
 <p>IX. Seven blazing fires, seven opposing armies,<br>
 The seventh Cynvelyn in every foremost place.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</p>
 <p>X. Seven thrusting spears, seven rivers-ful<br>
 Of the blood of chieftains will they fill.</p>
 <p><a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 370</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">MYRDIN.</p>
 <p>XI. Seven score generous ones have gone to the shades;<br>
 In the wood of Celyddon they came to their end.</p>
 <p>Since I, Myrdin, am next after Taliessin,<br>
 Let my prediction become common.</p>
