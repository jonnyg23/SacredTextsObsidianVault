 <h3 align="CENTER">XII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XIV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I WILL adore the love-diffusing Lord of every kindred,<br>
 The sovereign of hosts manifestly round the universe.<br>
 A battle at the feast over joyless beverage,<br>
 A battle against the sons of Llyr in Ebyr Henvelen. <a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a><br>
 I saw the oppression of the tumult, and wrath and tribulation,<br>
 The blades gleamed on the glittering helmets,<br>
 A battle against the lord of fame, in the dales of the Severn,<br>
 Against Brochwel of Powys, that loved my Awen.<br>
 A battle in the pleasant course early against Urien,<br>
 10 There falls about our feet blood on destruction.<br>
 Shall not my chair be defended from the cauldron of Ceridwen?<br>
 May my tongue be free in the sanctuary of the praise of Gogyrwen.<br>
 The praise of Gogyrwen is an oblation, which has satisfied<br>
 Them, with milk, and dew, and acorns.<br>
 Let us consider deeply before is heard confession,<br>
 That is coming assuredly death nearer and nearer.<br>
 And round the lands of Enlli the Dyvi has poured,<br>
 Raising the ships on the surface of the plain.<br>
 And let us call upon him that hath made us,<br>
 20 That he may protect us from the wrath of the alien nation.<br>
 When the isle of Mona shall be called a pleasant field,<br>
 Happy they the mild ones, the affliction of the Saxons.<br>
 I came to Deganwy to contend<br>
 With Maelgwn, the greatest in delinquencies,<br>
 I liberated my lord in the presence of the distributor,<br>
 Elphin, the sovereign of greatly aspiring ones.<br>
 There are to me three chairs regular, accordant,<br>
 And until doom they will continue with the singers.<br>
 I have been in the battle of Godeu, with Lleu and Gwydion,<br>
 30 The changed the form of the elementary trees and sedges.<br>
 I have been with Bran in Iwerdon.<br>
 I saw when was killed Morddwydtyllon.<br>
 I heard a meeting about the minstrels,<br>
 With the Gwyddyl, devils, distillers. <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a><br>
 From Penryn Wleth to Loch Reon<br>
 The Cymry are of one mind, bold heroes.<br>
 Deliver thou the Cymry in tribulation.<br>
 Three races, cruel from true disposition,<br>
 Gwyddyl, and Brython, and Romani,<br>
 40 Create discord and confusion.<br>
 And about the boundary of Prydain, beautiful its towns,<br>
 There is a battle against chiefs above the mead-vessels,<br>
 In the festivals of the Distributor, who bestowed gifts upon me.<br>
 The chief astrologers received wonderful gifts.<br>
 Complete is my chair in Caer Sidi,<br>
 No one will be afflicted with disease or old age that may be in it.<br>
 It is known to Manawyd and Pryderi.<br>
 Three utterances, around the fire, will he sing before it,<br>
 And around its borders are the streams of the ocean.<br>
 50 And the fruitful fountain is above it,<br>
 Is sweeter than white wine the liquor therein.<br>
 And when I shall have worshipped thee, Most High, before the sod<br>
 May I be found in covenant with thee.</p>
