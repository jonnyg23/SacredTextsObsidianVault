 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXIV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IN one year<br>
 One that provides<br>
 Wine and bounty and mead,<br>
 And manliness without enmity,<br>
 And a musician excelling,<br>
 With a swarm of spears about him.<br>
 With ribbands at their heads,<br>
 And their fair appearances.<br>
 Every one went from his presence,<br>
 10 They came into the conflict,<br>
 And his horse under him.<br>
 Purposing the affair of Mynaw.<br>
 And more harmony,<br>
 Advantage flowing about his hand.<br>
 Eight score of one colour<br>
 Of calves and cows.<br>
 Milch cows and oxen.<br>
 And every fair need.<br>
 I should not be joyful<br>
 20 If Urien were slain.<br>
 He is dear before he went.<br>
 A Saxon shivering, trembling,<br>
 With hair white-washed,<br>
 And a bier his destiny,<br>
 With a bloody face.<br>
 For the blood of men a little protected. <a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a><br>
 And a man of the intrenchment persevering,<br>
 Whose wife is a widow.<br>
 Mine is the wine of the prince,<br>
 30 Mine is the wine of frequent parties,<br>
 My chance, my aid, my head.<br>
 Since the rising up will not cause<br>
 A striking fronting one another.<br>
 Porter, listen.<br>
 What is the noise: is it the earth that quakes?<br>
 Or is it the sea that swells?<br>
 Whitened, clinging together, against the infantry.<br>
 If there is a cry on the hill,<br>
 Is it not Urien that terrifies?<br>
 40 If there is a cry in the valley,<br>
 Is it not Urien that pierces?<br>
 If there is a cry in the mountain,<br>
 Is it not Urien that conquers?<br>
 If there is a cry on the slope,<br>
 Is it not Urien that wounds?<br>
 If there is a sigh on the dyke,<br>
 Is it not Urien that is active?<br>
 A cry of a journey over the plain,<br>
 A cry in every meandering vale.<br>
 50 Nor will one sneeze or two<br>
 Protect from death.<br>
 He would not be on famine<br>
 With spoils surrounding him.<br>
 Over-querulous, trailing, of a blue tint.<br>
 Like death was his spear,<br>
 Killing his enemy.<br>
 And until I fail in old age,<br>
 In the sore necessity of death,<br>
 May I not be smiling,<br>
 60 If I praise not Urien.</p>
