 <p>I AM Taliesin the ardent;<br>
 I will enrich the praise of baptism.<br>
 At the baptism of the ruler, the worshipper wondered,<br>
 The conflict of the rocks and rocks and plain.<br>
 There is trembling from fear of Cunedda the burner,<br>
 In Caer Weir and Caer Lliwelydd.<br>
 There is trembling from the mutual encounter.<br>
 A complete billow of fire over the seas, .<br>
 A wave in which the brave fell among his companions.<br>
 10 A hundred received his attack on the earth,<br>
 Like the roaring of the wind against the ashen spears,<br>
 His dogs raised their backs at his presence.,<br>
 They protected, and believed in his kindness.<br>
 The bards are arranged according to accurate canons.<br>
 The death of Cunedda, which I deplore, is deplored.<br>
 Deplored be the strong protector, the fearless defender,<br>
 He will assimilate, he will agree with the deep and shallow,<br>
 A deep cutting he will agree to.<br>
 (His) discourse raised up the bard stricken in poverty,<br>
 20 Harder against an enemy than a bone.<br>
 Pre-eminent is Cunedda before the furrow (<i>i.e.</i> the grave)<br>
 And the sod. His face was kept<br>
 A hundred times before there was dissolution. A door hurdle<br>
 The men of Bryniich carried in the battle.<br>
 They became pale from fear of him and his terror chill-moving.<br>
 Before the earth was the portion of his end. <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a><br>
 Like a swarm of swift dogs about a thicket.<br>
 Sheathing (swords is) a worse cowardice than adversity.<br>
 The destiny of an annihilating sleep I deplore,<br>
 30 For the palace, for the shirt of Cunedda;<br>
 For the salt streams, for the freely-dropping sea.<br>
 For the prey, and the quantity I lose.<br>
 The sarcasm of bards that disparage I will harrow,<br>
 And others that thicken I will count.<br>
 He was to be admired in the tumult with nine hundred horse.<br>
 Before the communion of Cunedda,<br>
 There would be to me milch cows in summer,<br>
 There would be to me a steed in winter,<br>
 There would be to me bright wine and oil.<br>
 40 There would be to me a troop of slaves against any advance.<br>
 He was diligent of heat from an equally brave visitor.<br>
 A chief of lion aspect, ashes become his fellow-countrymen,<br>
 Against the son of Edern, before the supremacy of terrors,<br>
 He was fierce, dauntless, irresistible,<br>
 For the streams of death he is distressed.<br>
 He carried the shield in the pre-eminent place,<br>
 Truly valiant were his princes.<br>
 Sleepiness, and condolence, and pale front,<br>
 A good step, will destroy sleep from a believer.</p>
