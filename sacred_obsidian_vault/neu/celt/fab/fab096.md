 <p>I. I WILL extol Thee, the Trinity in the mysterious One,<br>
 Who is One and Three, a Unity of one energy,<br>
 Of the same essence and attributes, one God to be praised.<br>
 I will praise Thee, great Father, whose mighty works are great;<br>
 To praise Thee is just; to praise Thee is incumbent on me,<br>
 The produce of poetry is the right of Eloi.<br>
 Hail, glorious Christ!<br>
 Father, and Son, and Spirit! Lord,<br>
 God, Adonai!</p>
 <p>II. I will extol God, who is both One and Two,<br>
 Who is Three without any error, without its being easily doubted;<br>
 Who made fruit, and rill, and every gushing stream;<br>
 God is his name, being two Divine Ones to be comprehended;<br>
 God is his name, being three Divine Ones in his energy;<br>
 God is his name, being One; the God of Paul and Anhun.</p>
 <p>III. I will extol One, who is both Two and One.<br>
 Who is, besides, Three, who is God Himself,<br>
 Who made Mars and Luna, and male and female,<br>
 And ordained that the shallow and the abyss should not be of equal depth;<br>
 Who made heat and cold, and sun and moon,<br>
 And letters in the wax, and flame in the candle,<br>
 And affection to be one of the senses, and lovely woman late,<br>
 And caused the burning of five Caers, and an erring consort.</p>
