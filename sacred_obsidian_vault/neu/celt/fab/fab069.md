 <h3 align="CENTER">LIV.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF ANEURIN V.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>Every ode of the Gododin is equivalent to a single song, according to the privilege of poetical composition. Each of the Gwarchans is equal to three hundred and sixty-three songs, because the number of the men who went to Catraeth is commemorated in the Gorchans; and as no man should go to battle without arms, so no bard ought to contend without that poem.</p>
 <p>Here now begins the Gwarchan of Maelderw. Taliessin sung it, and it is a privileged ode. His three Gwarchans are equal in poetical competition to all the odes in the Gododin.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">_____________</p>
 <p>The noise of two Abers around the Caer!<br>
 Arouse thyself to arms and splendour! <a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 415</font></a><br>
 Cold is the passing and repassing of the breach of battle.<br>
 Lover of fame, seekest thou to sleep?<br>
 The variegated texture, the covering of heroism,<br>
 For the shelterless assault shall be woven.<br>
 The breach that has been attempted will not be effected.<br>
 Bear the patient exertion of heroism.<br>
 Sharply in arms he used to frown,<br>
 10 But mildly allured he the intellectual world.<br>
 A man that will run when thou pursuest,<br>
 Will have the rounded house of the sepulchre for his bed.<br>
 Call together, but do not reproach the over-anxious;<br>
 And meddle not with the fierce and violent.<br>
 Let him who has a just claim break the boundary.<br>
 He does not calculate upon praise<br>
 Who defends his shelter.<br>
 Praise is the meed of those who have made impressions.<br>
 The victor gazed towards the fair one.<br>
 20 Of bright and prominent uplifted front,<br>
 On the ruddy dragon, the palladium of Pharaon,<br>
 Which will in the air accompany the people.<br>
 Dead is every one that fell on his mouth<br>
 In the repulsion of the march of Teth and Teddyd.<br>
 Courteous was the great retinue of the wall, of ashen spears.<br>
 To the sea thou mayst not come;<br>
 But neither thy retreat nor thy counsel will fail,<br>
 Thou magnanimous soul in the defence of his boundaries.<br>
 No more can they extricate themselves,<br>
 30 Extricate themselves before the barrier of Eiddyn.<br>
 Cenan, the fair wall of excellence,<br>
 Placed a sword on the entrenchment of warriors.<br>
 Victorious was the chief<br>
 In dispossessing the sovereign,<br>
 The inconstant <a name="page_416"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 416</font></a><br>
 Gray-headed chief of ministers,<br>
 Whose counsels were deep.<br>
 The mutually sweet will not produce the mutually bitter.<br>
 I have mutually wished,<br>
 40 I do mutually wish for the repose of Eulli<br>
 The fair aspect of which is filled with deep interest,<br>
 On the course on a serene morning.<br>
 It allures me, it plays upon my strong desire.<br>
 I will ask the men for a dwelling,<br>
 In order to lessen the loss.<br>
 Happiness was lost and recovered.<br>
 The Northern Run, chieftain, thou hast caused to withdraw<br>
 The fat one in returning thou wilt cause to return to me.<br>
 They call more for large trees than for honeysuckles.<br>
                   (<i>Three lines untranslated</i>).<br>
 Let the sovereign stand firm between the looks of Dremrudd,<br>
 The ruddy glancer, whose purpose cannot be viewed for a sufficient time,<br>
 Whose purpose cannot be viewed for a sufficient time,<br>
 By those who with impunity plough the noisy sea.<br>
 First to be satisfied is the pale one,<br>
 The eccentric, whose throne is of complete form.<br>
 Before he was covered, Gownddelw<br>
 60 Was a tall man of great worth like Maelderw.<br>
 I will extol him who wields the spear,<br>
 Whose course is like that of the ruler of the mount,<br>
 The pervader of the land, by whose influence I am moved.<br>
 With active tumult did he descend to the ravine between the hills,<br>
 Nor was his presence a running shadow.<br>
 Whatever may befall the high land,<br>
 Disgrace shall never happen to the assembled train.</p>
 <p><a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 417</font></a></p>
 <p>I. It is well that Adonwy came, Adonwy to those that were left.<br>
 What Bradwen did, thou hast done; thou didst kill and burn,<br>
 Thou didst not keep the rear or the van.<br>
 I know the aspect of thy helmet. I have not seen from sea<br>
 To sea a worse knight than Odgur.</p>
 <p>II. Three hundred golden-torqued ones hastened along<br>
 To engage in the conflict; a sally ensued;<br>
 And though they were killed, they also killed;<br>
 And unto the end of the world honoured they shall be;<br>
 And of those who went in mutual amity,<br>
 Alas! except one man none escaped.</p>
 <p>III. Three hundred wearing the golden torques,<br>
 Fond of valorous toil, and headlong in the course;<br>
 Three hundred haughty ones,<br>
 Unanimous, and equally armed.<br>
 Three hundred prancing horses<br>
 Did with them hasten.<br>
 Three chiefs and three hundred,<br>
 Alas! none returned.</p>
 <p>IV. Furious in the battle, unreceding in distress;<br>
 In the conflict there was no peace if he acted vigorously;<br>
 In the day of wrath, shunning was no part of his work;<br>
 The aspect of a boar had Bleiddig son of Eli;<br>
 Wine was quaffed in brimful vessels of glass;<br>
 And the day of battle, exploits did he achieve<br>
 On Arvwl Cann, before he died.<br>
 Ruddy-tinted carnage used to attract him:</p>
 <p>V. Vigorously in the front of battles would he cause the crimson fluid to flow, <a name="page_413"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 413</font></a><br>
 Powerful as an instrument in battle,<br>
 And splendidly covered with mail.<br>
 Report informs me<br>
 That the dexterous blade<br>
 Will not be manifested<br>
 To the diffident.</p>
 <p>VI. He would reduce men to ashes,<br>
 And make wives widows,<br>
 Before his death,--<br>
 Breint, son of Bleiddgi;<br>
 With spears would he<br>
 Cause blood to flow.</p>
 <p>VII. Great is the design of him who conceals his vigorous attack;<br>
 His weapon he will conceal<br>
 Like a hidden treasure.<br>
 When all ascended, thou descendest.<br>
 Ceneu Gwyn, the blood of the dead how didst thou shed!<br>
 Three years and four,<br>
 Thou, guardian, didst put on magnificent raiment.<br>
 And to protect thee,<br>
 Though a youth, it was not right for me, for thou didst not retreat.<br>
 Pressent narrates that he was carried away with the arms.</p>
 <p>VIII. When he repaired to his native country, his fame was spread abroad;<br>
 He poured out the wine, the golden-torqued man!<br>
 He would give a gorgeously fine suit to a brave person,<br>
 And check a hundred men, courteous hero!<br>
 And send away the progeny of a foreign knight;--<br>
 The only son of Cian from beyond Bannawg, <a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 419</font></a><br>
 Never did in Gododin tread on the surface of the fosse,<br>
 While he was, any one more ardent than Lliv.</p>
 <p>IX. Anger, the scatterer of the brave, serpent with the piercing pike,<br>
 An immovable stone in front of the army;<br>
 Accustomed to the preparation of attacks,<br>
 And greatly to reward the assaulting lance.<br>
 Perfect art thou called from thy just deed,<br>
 Leader, director, and bulwark of all that are of the same language:<br>
 Tudvwlch, the subduer in battle, the destroyer of Caers.</p>
 <p>X. Anger, the scatterer of the brave, serpent with the piercing pike in the front of the army;<br>
 Perfect art thou called from thy just deed.<br>
 Faithful art thou called from thy faithful deed.<br>
 Leader, director, and the bulwark of every tribe,<br>
 Meryn, son of Madyeith, it is well that thou art born!</p>
 <p>XI. Gwolowy secured a gray wolf, whose roaring was as that of water.<br>
 Angor, the scatterer of the brave, an immovable stone in the front of the army.<br>
 Ruddy radiance, and horses, and men were in front of Gododin,<br>
 Whence so rapidly ascends the address<br>
 Of the Bard of the Cymry, Tottarth, in front of Garth Merin.</p>
 <p>XII. His shield, with endurance, he would not lower<br>
 Before the face of any one; wrong he would not encourage.<br>
 Urgent were the requests for horses in the entrance. <a name="page_420"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 420</font></a><br>
 The gold of the heroes, the crowd of holly lances covered it with gore,<br>
 While his comrade was pierced, he pierced others;<br>
 Disgrace to thee he would not bring:<br>
 Active in martial valour, he made a noble display,<br>
 When he carried away the famous Cyhuran of Mordei.</p>
 <p>XIII. Falsely it was said by Tudleo,<br>
 That no one's steeds were overtaken by Marchlew,<br>
 As he was reared to bring support to all around:<br>
 Powerful was the stroke of his sword on the adversary;<br>
 Eagerly ascended the ashen spear from the grasp<br>
 Of his hand, from the narrow summit of the awful pile.</p>
 <p>XIV. Direct us to heaven, the wished-for home of order!<br>
 Woe to us on account of constant lamentation and grief!<br>
 When the strangers came from Dineiddyn,<br>
 Every wise man was banished the country.<br>
 In the contention with Lloegyr of various conflicts,<br>
 Nine score for every one were made prostrate.<br>
 An array of horses, harness, and silken robes,<br>
 Gwaednerth arranged conspicuously from the battle.</p>
 <p>XV. From the retinue of Mynyddawg that hastened<br>
 In splendid order around the store of beverage regaled they themselves,<br>
 From the banquet of Mynyddawg, my mind has become sad,<br>
 Because of those of my true kinsmen I have completely lost.<br>
 Of three hundred golden-wreathed heroes, who marched to Catraeth,<br>
 Alas! except one man none escaped.</p>
 <p><a name="page_421"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 421</font></a></p>
 <p>XVI. The retinue of Gododin rode on<br>
 Swan-coloured horses with quivering manes and drooping harness,<br>
 And in front of the host, the throng descended,<br>
 In defence. of his generalship, and the mead of Eiddyn,<br>
 By the advice of Mynyddawg.<br>
 The shields were moved about,<br>
 The lances fell<br>
 Upon fair brows,<br>
 While the men were languidly dropping like fruit from the tree.<br>
 They bore no reproach, men that did not skulk.</p>
 <p>XVII. Have I not drunk mead on the march,<br>
 A banquet of wine before Catraeth as a preservative?<br>
 When he made slaughter with his unyielding lance<br>
 In the conflict, it was no inglorious sight to see where thou wert.<br>
 A monster wag no frightful object to thee while effecting deliverance,<br>
 Terrible and shielded Madawg Elved.</p>
 <p>XVIII. When they fairly met, there was no escaping for life.<br>
 Dialgur of Arvon fetched bright gold at the request<br>
 Of the Brython. High-mettled were the horses of Cynon.</p>
 <p>XIX. Llech Lleudu, and Tud Lleuvre,<br>
 The course, the course of Gododin.<br>
 A hand! a hand! a counsel! a counsel!<br>
 A tempest over the sea! a vessel from beyond sea!<br>
 The host of Heidiliawn, the host of Meidlyawn, a degenerate host,<br>
 Moving from Dindywydd.<br>
 Battered was the shield before the bull of conflict, the van was broken.</p>
 <p><a name="page_422"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 422</font></a></p>
 <p>XX. Golden-mailed warriors were there on the walls of the Caer;<br>
 Slow was the excess, but the tumult of battle was not dilatory.<br>
 One feeble man with his shouts kept away<br>
 The birds of the region, like Pelloid Mirain.<br>
 No one living will relate what happened<br>
 At Lliw, about the banks of Llwch Llivanad;<br>
 No one living will relate of any one to whom in the day of conflict<br>
 Cynaval was not equal in merit.</p>
 <p>XXI. No achievement to-day around Neimyn!<br>
 The same covering envelopes men of the noblest descent.<br>
 A numerous host engaged in battle which is worth relating,<br>
 The son of Nwython killed of the golden-torqued ones<br>
 A hundred chieftains, as far as it is related, the vehemence<br>
 Was greater than when a hundred men went to Catraeth.<br>
 He was like a mead-fed hero with a large heart.<br>
 He was a man of hosts; energetic was he in his coat of mail,<br>
 He was a man of conflict, fierce was he on the ridge of Cavall.<br>
 No man among a thousand brave warriors<br>
 Handled a spear, or a shield, or a sword, or a dagger,<br>
 Who was a braver man than Neim the son of Nwython.</p>
 <p>XXII. While there was a drop, they were like three lions in purpose;<br>
 In the battle three brave, prompt, active lions.<br>
 Bribon who wielded the thick lance,</p>
 <p>XXIII. Accustomed was he to defend Gododin against a hero,<br>
 In the van of battle, against vehement ones, <a name="page_423"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 423</font></a><br>
 Accustomed was he, in the manner of Alan, to be swift;<br>
 Accustomed was he before a horde of depredators to make a descent;<br>
 Accustomed was the son of Golystan, though he was<br>
 A sovereign, to listen to what his father said;<br>
 Accustomed was he, in the interest of Mynyddawg, to have a perforated shield,<br>
 And a ruddy lance, before the vigorous chief of Eiddyn.</p>
 <p>XXIV. The rulers did not celebrate the praise of the holy one.<br>
 Before the attack of the numerous host, the battle was broken through.<br>
 Like a raging fire through combustibles.<br>
 On Tuesday, they put on their splendid robes;<br>
 On Wednesday, bitter was their assembly;<br>
 On Thursday, messengers formed contracts;<br>
 On Friday, there were carnage and contusion;<br>
 On Saturday, they dealt mutual blows;<br>
 On Sunday, they were pierced by ruddy weapons;<br>
 On Monday, a pool of blood, knee-deep, was seen.<br>
 The Gododin, after tedious toil, cannot relate it.<br>
 Before the tents of Madawg after the return.</p>
 <p>XXV. A grievous descent was made in front of the hoarded riches;<br>
 The first to chase them was a person renowned for activity;--<br>
 Gwannannon, honoured in the mead banquet, whose prowess I will extol;<br>
 And next to him the brave-minded and heroic<br>
 Eithinyn the renowned, the son of Bodw.</p>
 <p><a name="page_424"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 424</font></a></p>
 <p>XXVI. Men of excess went with them,<br>
 Who had been revelling in wine and mead,<br>
 In the banquet of Mynyddawg.<br>
 We are greatly grieved at the loss<br>
 Of a man of such terrible energy;<br>
 Like thunder from heaven was the clashing of his shield,<br>
 From the agitation caused by Eithinyn;</p>
 <p>XXVII. Swift and heroic he was when at early dawn<br>
 He would arise to lead his band;<br>
 But whether leading or following<br>
 Before a hundred he stood prominent.<br>
 He was so disposed to (assault) them,<br>
 As to drink mead or wine;<br>
 He was so unsparing,<br>
 When he transfixed the foes,<br>
 And forward was his course towards them.</p>
 <p>XXVIII. Rapidly and heroically with the dawn they marched<br>
 To the conflict, with the commander in front of the course;<br>
 Gwair was greeted by the fluid gore<br>
 In the van of the battle;<br>
 He was a beloved friend<br>
 In the day of distress.<br>
 The defence of the mountain, the place,<br>
 And the forward beam of war, wore a murky hue.</p>
 <p>XXIX. His lances were seen among the hosts<br>
 Vigorously employed for mutual defence against the foe;<br>
 Before the din of his shields they concealed themselves, <a name="page_425"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 425</font></a><br>
 They lay hid before Eiddyn, the lofty hill;<br>
 And of as many as he found none returned;<br>
 Of him the truth is related and sung:<br>
 Obstinately would he pierce armour, when he caused a trembling;<br>
 And he whom he pierced, would not be pierced again.<br>
 Repeated are the lamentations that his presents are gone;<br>
 His friends were as numerous as bees;<br>
 And before he was covered under the sward of the earth,<br>
 He caused the mead to flow.</p>
 <p>XXX.     (<i>Five lines untranslated</i>.)<br>
 The Gododin will not relate at the early dawn<br>
 Of any to whom Cynaval was not equal.</p>
 <p>XXXI. Blade weapons, broad and ruddy, were abundant before he was covered,<br>
 The hero who filled the plain with slaughtered men.<br>
 He was a joyous chief, an unflinching wolf-like hero, a firm wolf<br>
 In the camp, with a submissive retinue blessing him;<br>
 Before he was arrested, he was not feeble.<br>
 Perfect art thou called from thy righteous deed;<br>
 Leader, director, and bulwark of all that are of the same language,<br>
 Tudvwlch, the subduer in battle, the destroyer of Caers.</p>
 <p>XXXII. The slayer of hosts is gone to the black glebe:<br>
 A piece of earth has made<br>
 Sweet bitter to the people.<br>
 Withered leaves are driven too and fro on his patrimony; <a name="page_426"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 426</font></a><br>
 It was not for the advantage of the country that the sod (should cover him);<br>
 The bull of conflict never retreated the width of an acre.<br>
 Sad is the fate that it should thus be!</p>
 <p>XXXIII. He pierced upwards of three hundred of the foe,<br>
 He slaughtered the centre and the extreme;<br>
 He was worthy to be at the head of an army, most gentle;<br>
 He fed his horses upon barley in winter,<br>
 Black ravens croaked on the wall<br>
 Of the beautiful Caer. He was an Arthur<br>
 In the midst of the exhausting conflict,<br>
 In the assault in the pass, like Gwernor the hero.</p>
 <p>XXXIV. I ought to sing to Cynon with the flesh-spears:<br>
 In action, and before the desolating spears of Aeron,<br>
 His hand was reckoned at the head of hoary heroes.<br>
 To me was distributed the best fare among the daring ones,<br>
 To the advantage of Mynyddawg, knight of the people,<br>
 He appointed me to harass the enemy<br>
 On Catraeth, where the golden-torqued heroes were loquacious.<br>
 They pierced and slaughtered those who stood before them;<br>
 Whelps committed ravages about their territories.<br>
 There was scarcely in the lists, on the part of the Brython,<br>
 At Gododin, from a distance a man better than Cenon.</p>
 <p>XXXV. It is incumbent on me to celebrate the complete acquisition<br>
 Of our warriors, who around Catraeth made a tumultuous rout, <a name="page_427"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 427</font></a><br>
 With confusion, and blood, and treading, and trampling,<br>
 Where valour was trampled, and vengeance taken because of the contribution of mead.<br>
 As to the carnage of the combatants,<br>
 Cibno does not relate after the excitement of battle.<br>
 Since he has received the communion he shall be interred.</p>
 <p>XXXVI. Birds were allured (<i>untranslated</i>).<br>
           (<i>One line untranslated</i>.)<br>
 He put on gold before the battle-shout, in the front rank of the accomplished heroes.<br>
          (<i>Three lines untranslated</i>.)<br>
 Cibno the son of Gwengad had a long and splendid retinue.</p>
 <p>XXXVII. I owe a complete song to the dog of Gwerunyd.<br>
 Let joy be in the chamber.        *        *        *</p>
