 <p>I. BEFORE Geraint, the enemy of oppression,<br>
 I saw white horses jaded and gory,<br>
 And after the shout, a terrible resistance.</p>

 <p>II. Before Geraint, the unflinching foe,<br>
 I saw horses jaded and gory from the battle,<br>
 And after the shout, a terrible impulsion.</p>
 <p>III. Before Geraint, the enemy of tyranny,<br>
 I saw horses white with foam,<br>
 And after the shout, a terrible torrent.</p>
 <p>IV. In Llongborth I saw the rage of slaughter,<br>
 And biers beyond all number,<br>
 And red-stained men from the assault of Geraint.</p>
 <p>V. In Llongborth I saw the edges of blades in contact,<br>
 Men in terror, and blood on the pate,<br>
 Before Geraint, the great son of his father.</p>
 <p>VI. In Llongborth I saw the spurs<br>
 Of men who would not flinch from the dread of the spears,<br>
 And the drinking of wine out of the bright glass.</p>
 <p>VII. In Llongborth I saw the weapons<br>
 Of men, and blood fast dropping,<br>
 And after the shout, a fearful return.</p>
 <p>VIII. In Llongborth I saw Arthur,<br>
 And brave men who hewed down with steel,<br>
 Emperor, and conductor of the toll.</p>
 <p>IX. In Llongborth Geraint was slain,<br>
 A brave man from the region of Dyvnaint,<br>
 And before they were overpowered, they committed slaughter.</p>

 <p>X. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<br>
 Long-legged, with wheat for their corn,<br>
 Ruddy ones, with. the assault of spotted eagles.</p>
 <p>XI. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<br>
 Long their legs, grain was given them,<br>
 Ruddy ones, with the assault of black eagles.</p>

 Long-legged, restless over their grain,<br>
 Ruddy ones, with the assault of red eagles.</p>
 <p>XIII. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<br>
 Long-legged, grain-scattering,<br>
 Ruddy ones, with the assault of white eagles.</p>
 <p>XIV. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<br>
 Long-legged, with the pace of the stag,<br>
 With a nose like that of the consuming fire on a wild mountain.</p>
 <p>XV. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<br>
 Long-legged, satiated with grain,<br>
 Grey ones, with their manes tipped with silver.</p>
 <p>XVI. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<br>
 Long-legged, well deserving of grain,<br>
 Ruddy ones, with the assault of grey eagles.</p>
 <p>XVII. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<br>
 Long-legged, having corn for food,<br>
 Ruddy ones, with the assault of brown eagles.</p>
 <p>XVII. When Geraint was born, open were the gates of heaven,<br>
 Christ granted what was asked,<br>
 Beautiful the appearance of glorious Prydain.</p>
