 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SPOILS OF TALIESSIN, A SONG TO URIEN.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXVII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IN manliness he will greet my trouble,<br>
 Should I be bled, I should evidently get better;<br>
 Truly I saw. no one before, who saw not in me<br>
 Every indisposition, he will cultivate his business.<br>
 I saw a feeding about a lion for plants,<br>
 I saw leaves of luxuriant growth.<br>
 I saw a branch with equal blossoms.<br>
 Did I not see a prince? most liberal his customs, <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a><br>
 I saw the ruler of Catraeth beyond the plains<br>
 10 Be my oak <i>(i.e.</i> prince) the gleaming spirit (<i>i.e.</i> lightning) of the Cymry.<br>
 The value of my cry great will be its advantage to degrees.<br>
 The chief of men, shield of warriors.<br>
 The extensive booty of the ashen shaft is my fair Awen.<br>
 A shield before a prince, bright his smile,<br>
 Heroic, aspiring, the most heroic is Urien.<br>
 A merchant will not oppose me. Tumultuous<br>
 The slothful one, brightly shines the blue of the enamelled covering; prolific and highly exalted<br>
 Every one; a step without skill on the side of the watery fronts of the Mordei.<br>
 A chief excessively active to us he will come of thy will.<br>
 20 Active the yellow-gray one in the hall.<br>
 Full of people. A protector in Aerou.<br>
 Great his energy, his poets, and his musicians,<br>
 Very fierce is Ial against his enemies.<br>
 May great strength of men be connected with Brython.<br>
 Like the wheeling of a fiery meteor over the earth.<br>
 Like a wave that governs Llwyvenydd.<br>
 Like the harmonious ode of Gwen and Gweithen,<br>
 Like Mor the greatly courteous is Urien.<br>
 In his early career an intrepid hero.<br>
 30 He is such a ruler of kings as Dyawr,<br>
 He is one (i.e. unequalled) as a chaser of the swift horses of the multitude.<br>
 In the beginning of May in Powys, in battle array,<br>
 He is one, coming when he visits his people.<br>
 Eagle of the land, extensive thy glance.<br>
 I would have requested an active courser<br>
 Of vigorous trot, the price of the spoil of Taliessin.<br>
 One is the violent course on the bottom and the summit, <a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a><br>
 One is the gift of a baron to a lord.<br>
 One is the herd of stags in their flight,<br>
 40 One is the wolf not covetous of broom,<br>
 One is the country where a son is born,<br>
 And of one form and one sound is the battle-place of warriors.<br>
 Of one sound they will evilly yoke<br>
 And Ceneu and Nudd Hael, and an extensive country under him.<br>
 And if I obtain for myself a smile,<br>
 He will make the bards ever joyful,<br>
 Before that I could wish dead the sons of Gwyden,<br>
 May the happy country of Urien be filled with blood.</p>
