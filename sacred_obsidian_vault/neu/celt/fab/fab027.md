 <p>THE best song they will dispraise,<br>
 Eight numbers they will protect,<br>
 Monday, they will come,<br>
 Devastating they will go.<br>
 Tuesday, they will portion<br>
 Anger against the adversary.<br>
 Wednesday, they will reap.<br>
 Pomp in excess.<br>
 Thursday, they will part with<br>
 10 The undesired possessor.<br>
 Friday, a day of abundance.<br>
 In the blood of men they will swim.<br>
 Saturday<br>
 Sunday, certainly,<br>
 Assuredly there will come<br>
 Five ships and five hundred<br>
 That make supplication--<br>
     <i>O Brithi, Brithi</i>!<br>
     <i>Co-occupancy or battle</i>.<br>
     20 <i>Brithi, Brithanai</i>!<br>
     <i>Before battle, battle of spears in the field</i>.<br>
 Son of the wood of Cogni,<br>
 There will be an adventuring of<br>
 Everyone to Adonai.<br>
 On the sward of Pwmpai.<br>
 An intimation they prophesy,<br>
 A long cry against overwhelming, <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a><br>
 Long the public harmony<br>
 Of Cadwaladyr and Cynan.<br>
 30 The world's profit (is) small,<br>
 The heat of the sun is lost.<br>
 The Druid will prophesy<br>
 What has been will be.<br>
 Sky of Geirionydd,<br>
 I would go with thee<br>
 Gloomy like the evening,<br>
 In the recesses of the mountain.<br>
 When should be the full length<br>
 The Brython in chasing.<br>
 40 To the Brython there will be<br>
 Blood of glorious strenuousness,<br>
 After gold and golden trinkets.<br>
 The devastation of Moni and Lleeni,<br>
 And Eryri, a dwelling in it.<br>
 It is a perfect prophecy,<br>
 With dwellings laid waste.<br>
 The Cymry of four languages<br>
 Shall change their speech.<br>
 Until shall come the cow, the speckled cow<br>
 50 That shall cause a blessing<br>
 On a fine day lowing,<br>
 On a fine night being boiled,<br>
 On the land of the boiler,<br>
 In the ships of the consumer.<br>
 Let the song of woe be chaunted.<br>
 Around the encircling border of Prydain.<br>
 They will come, with one purpose,<br>
 To resist a maritime disgrace.<br>
 Be true the happiness<br>
 60 Of the sovereign of the world.<br>
 The worshippers adored together, <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a><br>
 To the dale of grievous water it was gone.<br>
 A portion full of corn<br>
 Invites conflagration.<br>
 Without Eppa, without a cow-stall.<br>
 Without a luxury of the world.<br>
 The world will be desolate, useless.<br>
 The deceitful will be fated.<br>
 Activity through freshness.<br>
 70 Small men are almost deceived<br>
 By the white-bellied trotter.<br>
 A hawk upon baptism<br>
 The swords of warriors will not pierce Cyllellawr.<br>
 They had not what they wished for.<br>
 Violent is the grasp of the townman,<br>
 And to warriors there is a love of blood.<br>
 Cymry, Angles, Gwyddyl, of Prydyn.<br>
 The Cymry, swift in mischief,<br>
 Will launch their ships on the lake.<br>
 80 The North has been poisoned by rovers<br>
 Of a livid hateful hue and form.<br>
 Of the race of Adam the ancient.<br>
 The third will be brought to set out,<br>
 Ravens of the accurate retinue,<br>
 The sluggish animals of Seithin.<br>
 On sea, an anchor on the Christian.<br>
 A cry from the sea, a cry from the mountain,<br>
 A cry from the sea, they vigorously utter.<br>
 Wood, field, dale, and hill.<br>
 90 Every speech without any one attending,<br>
 High minded from every place<br>
 There will be confusion.<br>
 A multitude enraged,<br>
 And distress diffused<br>
 Vengeances through ready belief abiding. <a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a><br>
 That the Creator afflicts, the powerful God of exalted state.<br>
 A long time before the day of doom.<br>
 There will come a day<br>
 And a reader will rise,<br>
 100 In the pleasant border of the land of Iwerdon,<br>
 To Prydain then will come exaltation,<br>
 Brython of the nobility of Rome.<br>
 There will be to me a judge unprejudiced, void of guile;<br>
 The astrologers (or diviners) prophesy,<br>
 In the land of the lost ones.<br>
 Druids prophesy<br>
 Beyond the sea, beyond the Brython.<br>
 The summer will not be serene weather,<br>
 The noblemen shall be broken,<br>
 110 It will come to them from treachery<br>
 Beyond the effusion of the father of Ked.<br>
 A thousand in the judgment of exalted Prydain,<br>
 And within its united boundary.<br>
 May I not fall into the embrace of the swamp,<br>
 Into the mob that peoples the depths of Uffern.<br>
 I greatly fear the flinty covering<br>
 With the Guledig of the boundless country.</p>
