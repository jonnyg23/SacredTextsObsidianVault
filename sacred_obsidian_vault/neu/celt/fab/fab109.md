 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN LV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I WILL adore my Father,<br>
 My God, my strengthener,<br>
 Who infused through my head<br>
 A soul to direct me.<br>
 Who has made for me in perception,<br>
 My seven faculties.<br>
 Of fire and earth,<br>
 And water and air,<br>
 And mist and flowers,<br>
 10 And southerly wind. <a name="page_540"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 540</font></a><br>
 Other senses of perception<br>
 Thy father formed for me.<br>
 One is to have instinct<br>
 With the second I touch,<br>
 With the third I call,<br>
 With the fourth I taste,<br>
 With the fifth I see,<br>
 With the sixth I hear.<br>
 With the seventh I smell.<br>
 20 And I foresay,<br>
 Seven airs there are,<br>
 Above the astronomer,<br>
 And three parts the seas.<br>
 How they strike on all sides.<br>
 How great and wonderful,<br>
 The world, not of one form,<br>
 Did God make above,<br>
 On the planets.<br>
 He made Sola,<br>
 30 He made Luna,<br>
 He made Marca<br>
 And Marcarucia,<br>
 He made Venus,<br>
 He made Venerus,<br>
 He made Severus,<br>
 And the seventh Saturnus,<br>
 The good God made<br>
 Five zones of the earth,<br>
 For as long as it will last.<br>
 40 One is cold,<br>
 And the second is cold,<br>
 And the third is heat,<br>
 Disagreeable, unprofitable.<br>
 The fourth, paradise, <a name="page_541"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 541</font></a><br>
 The people will contain.<br>
 The fifth is the temperate,<br>
 And the gates of the universe.<br>
 Into three it is divided,<br>
 In the minstrelsy of perception.<br>
 50 One is Asia,<br>
 The second is Africa,<br>
 The third is Europa,<br>
 The baptism of consolation,<br>
 Until doomsday it will continue,<br>
 When everything will be judged.<br>
 My Awen has caused me<br>
 To praise my king.<br>
 I am Taliessin,<br>
 With a speed flowing as a diviner.<br>
 60 Continuing to the end<br>
 In the pattern of Elphin.</p>
