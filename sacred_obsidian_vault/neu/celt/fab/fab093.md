 <p>LET us not reproach one another, but rather mutually save ourselves.<br>
 Certain is a meeting after separation,<br>
 The appointment of a senate, and a certain conference,<br>
 And the rising from the grave after a long repose. <a name="page_507"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 507</font></a><br>
 The mighty God will keep in his power the man of correct life,<br>
 And will let fire upon the unholy people,<br>
 And lightning and thunder and wide-spread death.<br>
 Neither a solitary nor a sluggard shall pass to a place of safety.<br>
 And after peace there shall be the usages of a kingdom;<br>
 10 The three hosts shall be brought to the overpowering presence of Jesus:<br>
 A pure and blessed host like the angels;<br>
 Another host, mixed, like the people of a country;<br>
 The third host, unbaptized, a multitude that directly after death<br>
 Will proceed in a thick crowd to the side of devils,<br>
 Not one of them shall go, owing to their hideous forms,<br>
 To the place where there are flowers and dew on the pleasant land,<br>
 Where there are singers tuning their harmonious lays,<br>
 Happy will be their cogitations with the ruler of the glorious retinue;<br>
 Where the Apostles are in the kingdom of the humble,<br>
 20 Where the bounteous Creator is on his glorious throne.<br>
 May a disposition for the grave be given us; exalted is a relationship to Him;<br>
 And. before we are gathered together to mount Olivet,<br>
 May those who have fallen be victorious over death;<br>
 And work like theirs may we also do; for at the judgment day<br>
 The wonders, greatness, and puissance of the Creator none can relate.</p>
