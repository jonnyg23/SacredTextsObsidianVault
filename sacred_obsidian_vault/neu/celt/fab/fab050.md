 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IN the name of the Ruler of heaven, the mighty one<br>
 The supporter of his friends shall keep possession of his towns,<br>
 Splendid his princely spear.<br>
 Warlike kings spear-scouting.<br>
 He will defend the pleasant plain of Lleenawg;<br>
 The ruthless pushing shafts are broken.<br>
 Long they will experience<br>
 The gratitude of Prydain.<br>
 From the bush of Maw and Eiddyn,<br>
 10 They would not take opposition.<br>
 Friendly the aid of Clydwyn.<br>
 May I be satisfied! He supplied his fleet<br>
 From spears until the shafts were heated.<br>
 A coffin to every one his ambition.<br>
 They cannot reckon the battles fought<br>
 By Gwallawg. Better is wild food than a she-bear.<br>
 A battle in Agathes in defence,<br>
 Praise his active judgment caused.<br>
 A battle in the region of Bretrwyn with heat,<br>
 20 A great fire. Limited is his vehemence.<br>
 A battle, there was a rule of general benefit.<br>
 A battle, a battle of trembling in Aeron.<br>
 A battle in Arddunion and Aeron.<br>
 Bring reproach to the youths.<br>
 A battle in the wood of Beit at the close of the day.<br>
 Thou didst not think of thy foes.<br>
 A battle in the presence of Mabon.<a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a><br>
 He will not mention the contradiction of the saved.<br>
 A battle in Gwensteri, and thou subduest Lloegyr.<br>
 30 A darting of spears there is made.<br>
 A battle in the marsh of Terra with the dawn,<br>
 Easily broken (was) the terrible arch,<br>
 At the first littering of the word,<br>
 Of kings who were extinguished in the war.<br>
 Men with full intent to obtain cattle.<br>
 Haearddur and Hyveidd and Gwallawg,<br>
 And Owen of Mona of Maelgwnian quality,<br>
 Will lay the Peithwyr prostrate,<br>
 At the end of the wood of Cleddyfein,<br>
 40 From which there will be pierced corpses,<br>
 And the ravens wandering about.<br>
 In Prydain, in Eiddyn, acknowledged.<br>
 In Gafran, in the retreat of Brecheinawc.<br>
 In energy, in exalted covering.<br>
 He sees not a hero, who saw not Gwallawg.</p>
