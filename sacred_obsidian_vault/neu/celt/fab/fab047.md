 <p>THOUGH I love the strand, I hate the sea.<br>
 How the wave covered the stone of Camwr! <a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a><br>
 The brave, the magnanimous, the amiable, the generous, and the energetic,<br>
 Are as stepping-stones to the bards of the world, and an advantageous shelter.<br>
 The fame of Heilyn proved a benefit to the solicitous.<br>
 To the day of judgment may his celebrity remain!<br>
 Though I love the strand, I hate the wave.<br>
 The wave has done violence, dismal the blow to the breast.<br>
 He will complain as long as he believes on its account.<br>
 10 It is a cheerful work to bathe on my bosom,<br>
 Though it (the water) fills the cavity, it does not disturb the heart.<br>
 And in the direction of Cyhaig did the wave arise.<br>
 Sorry we are for his concerns,<br>
 When Pebrwr from afar hastened to his death.<br>
 The brave and courageous multitude will affect us both;<br>
 As the water bearing the leaves shows it thee.<br>
 Mechydd is sad on account of thy coming.<br>
 I will not receive thee to my receptacle.<br>
 From my part I sold a horse for thee.<br>
 20 Cyhaig will revenge for the delay of his enjoyment,<br>
 And for the sweet strains.<br>
 O dwarf! for thy anger to me there have been enemies.</p>
