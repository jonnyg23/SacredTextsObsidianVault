 <p>I. MAENWYN, when I was of thy age,<br>
 My garment should not be trodden under foot,<br>
 My land should not be ploughed without blood.</p>
 <p>II. Maenwyn, when I was opposed to thee,<br>
 With youth attendant on me,<br>
 The foe would not break my boundary.</p>
 <p>III. Maenwyn, while I was in pursuit of thee,<br>
 Following my youth,<br>
 The foe loved not the fury of my resentment.</p>
 <p>IV. Maenwyn, while I was young and plump,<br>
 Addicted to fierce slaughter,<br>
 I would perform the acts of a man, though I was but a youth.</p>
 <p>V. Maenwyn, take thy aim discreetly;<br>
 There is need of advice on him who is in error:<br>
 Let Maelgwn provide another mayor.</p>

 <p>VI. My choice is a portion, with its sheath on it,<br>
 And sharp-pointed as a thorn;<br>
 It is not labour lost for me to whet a stone.</p>
 <p>VII. A present was bestowed on me from the vale<br>
 Of Mewyrniawn, concealed in a bucket,<br>
 A sharp iron projecting from the hand.</p>
 <p>VIII. Blessed be the solitary hag,<br>
 That said from the door of her cell,<br>
 "Maenwyn, do not deliver up thy knife."</p>
