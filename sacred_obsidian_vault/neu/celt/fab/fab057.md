 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>EXTOL the career of the kings of Reged.<br>
 Was I not an expense to thee, though I am thine?<br>
 They brandished the blade of battle, and spears of battle,<br>
 Men brandished under the round shield; lights<br>
 White gulls trampled.<br>
 It was not fell fought. A false king is not good.<br>
 The Guledig will prepare himself against contusions.<br>
 He will not drive the business of those that seek him.<br>
 We shall have a nimble horseman, of Gwirion's fame,<br>
 10 A leader of fair promise, wise as Don.<br>
 Until Ulph came with violence on his enemies.<br>
 Until Urien came in the day to Aeron.<br>
 He was not an agressor, there appeared not<br>
 The uplifted front of Urien before Powys.<br>
 Was not easily treated the heat of the compact elf the tribes,<br>
 Hyveidd and Gododin and the lion prince.<br>
 Bold in patience, and journey of joint summons.<br>
 Without pollution he drew blood in his veins.<br>
 (He) that saw Llwyvenydd humbly will tremble,<br>
 20 A conspicuous banner in the second place,<br>
 A battle in the ford of Alclud, a battle at the Inver.<br>
 The battle of Cellawr Brewyn. The battle of Hireurur.<br>
 A battle in the underwood of Cadleu, a battle in Aberioed.<br>
 He interposes with the steel loud (and) great.<br>
 The battle of Cludvein, the, affair of the head of the wood.<br>
 A tribe attracted of dogs to a plentitude of blood.<br>
 To destroy supreme felicity is the aim<br>
 Of the Angles, a hostile crew. <a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a><br>
 Ruddy-stained from the conflict with Ulph at the ford.<br>
 30 Better is born the Guledig, forward was born his lord,<br>
 Prydain's chief proprietor, harmonious his lord.<br>
 He bare not clothes, either blue or gray,<br>
 Or red or green; he will not honour the ground.<br>
 He placed not his thigh over Moel Maelaur,<br>
 On horses of the speckled race of Mor Greidiawl.<br>
 Summer until winter, and gently in hand,<br>
 On ford, and course exercising them.<br>
 And a guest under songs and exalting one's-self,<br>
 And until the end of the world was perceived the band.<br>
 40 They arrange, they sweep about chainless for an image,<br>
 Uncowardly about lights did I not mangle?<br>
 I strove against the fall of spears on shoulders.<br>
 Shield in hand, Godeu. and Reged protecting;<br>
 Did I not see a man folding cattle?<br>
 A serpent of enchantment, a comely trampler of the ground.<br>
 Do I not know a war wherein he was lost,<br>
 And how much I lose by his perishing?<br>
 I shall not be extremely angry to possess mead-liquor.<br>
 From the heroic Hyveidd, of hospitable course.<br>
 50 Wit not I that was permitted (to have) shelter of the battle.<br>
 My kings were broken off from cheerful graces,<br>
 Shelter of the country good to the oppressed.<br>
 And until I fail in age,<br>
 In the sore necessity of death,<br>
 May I not be smiling,<br>
 If I praise not Urien.</p>
