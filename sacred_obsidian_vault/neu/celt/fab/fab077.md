 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>CYNAN, the exciter of battle,<br>
 Bestowed on me treasure,<br>
 For not false the glory<br>
 Of the stout hunting dogs of the domain.<br>
 A hundred steeds of equal pace,<br>
 Silver their covering.<br>
 A hundred legions in green<br>
 Of one front running together.<br>
 A hundred urchins in my bosom.<br>
 10 And a battalion of cats.<br>
 A sword with sheath of stone.<br>
 A fist-cell better than any.<br>
 A hundred Cynan had,<br>
 Hateful not to see,<br>
 From the vales of Cadell.<br>
 In battle they were not shaken.<br>
 To the battle on Wy there resorted<br>
 Spears innumerable.<br>
 The Gwentians were slain,<br>
 20 With the gore-drenched blade.<br>
 A battle in Mona, great, fair,<br>
 Hovering over, and praised<br>
 Over the Menei, there went<br>
 Horses and confident ones. <a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 448</font></a><br>
 A battle on the hill of Dyved.<br>
 Slaughter stings in motion.<br>
 Nor were seen<br>
 The kine before the countenance of any one.<br>
 Let the son of Brochuael boast,<br>
 30 He will declare his wish.<br>
 Let Cornwall greet,<br>
 The younger will not praise fate.<br>
 The incomprehensible will depress<br>
 In the day that is praised by me,<br>
 My patron of Cynan.<br>
 Battles arose.<br>
 A woeful spreading flame,<br>
 There raises up a great fire.<br>
 A battle in the country of Brachan,<br>
 40 A warring scene of tumult,<br>
 Miserable princes.<br>
 Were made to tremble before Cynan.<br>
 The breastplate being transfixed,<br>
 Like a ruler, they cried out,<br>
 Cyngen of perfect song<br>
 Thou wilt help with thy wide country.<br>
 A saying was heard.<br>
 Every one in his red place,<br>
 Be the circle red, they say ironically,<br>
 50 They, will enslave thy Cynan.</p>
