 <p>THE eternal Trinity<br>
 Made the element, <a name="page_565"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 565</font></a><br>
 And after the element,<br>
 Adam wonderfully.<br>
 And after Adam,<br>
 Well he made Eva.<br>
 The blessed Israel<br>
 The mighty Spirit made.<br>
 Ardent the suggestion,<br>
 10 Clear the reasoning.<br>
 Twelve towns of Israel, rising equally high,<br>
 Twelve sons of Israel, the generous God made.<br>
 Twelve sons of Israel were nursed together.<br>
 Twelve good, blameless, three mothers nursed them.<br>
 One person created them, the Creator made them.<br>
 As he will do as he pleases, who is supreme.<br>
 Twelve sons of Israel made the love-diffuser.<br>
 As he will do as he pleases, who is Lord.<br>
 Twelve sons of Israel made the Lord.<br>
 20 As he will do as he pleases, who is skilful.<br>
 Twelve-sons of Israel bore reward<br>
 Of the mission of Jesus.<br>
 And one father there was to them.<br>
 And three mothers to them.<br>
 From them came grace<br>
 And good offspring.<br>
 And Mary, good, created,<br>
 And Christ, my strengthener,<br>
 Lord of every fair country,<br>
 30 And I will call on and sing to thee every day;<br>
 For has been my desire<br>
 Friendship with thee.</p>
