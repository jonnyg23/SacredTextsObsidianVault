 <p>MEDITATING were my thoughts<br>
 On the vain poetry of the bards of Brython.<br>
 Making the best of themselves in the chief convention.<br>
 Enough, the care of the smith's sledge-hammer.<br>
 I am in want of a stick, straitened in song,<br>
 The fold of the bards, who knows it not?<br>
 Fifteen thousand over it<br>
 Adjusting it.<br>
 I am a harmonious one; I am a clear singer.<br>
 10 I am steel; I am a druid.<br>
 I am an artificer; I am a scientific one.<br>
 I am a serpent; I am love; I will indulge in feasting<br>
 I am not a confused bard drivelling, <a name="page_524"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 524</font></a><br>
 When songsters sing a song by memory,<br>
 They will not make wonderful cries;<br>
 May I be receiving them.<br>
 Like receiving clothes without a hand,<br>
 Like sinking in a lake without swimming,<br>
 The stream boldly rises tumultuously in degree.<br>
 20 High in the blood of sea-board towns.<br>
 The rock wave-surrounded, by great arrangement,<br>
 Will convey for us a defence, a protection from the enemy.<br>
 The rock of the chief proprietor, the head of tranquillity.<br>
 The intoxication of meads will cause us to speak.<br>
 I am a cell, I am a cleft, I am a restoration,<br>
 I am the depository of song; I am a literary man;<br>
 I love the high trees, that afford a protection above,<br>
 And a bard that composes, without earning anger;<br>
 I love not him that causes contention<br>
 30 He that speaks ill of the skilful shall not possess mead.<br>
 It is a fit time to go to the drinking,<br>
 With the skilful men, about art,<br>
 And a hundred knots, the custom of the country,<br>
 The shepherd of the districts, support of gates,<br>
 Like going without a foot to battle.<br>
 He would not journey without a foot.<br>
 He would not breed nuts without trees,<br>
 Like seeking for ants in the heath.<br>
 Like an instrument of foolish spoil,<br>
 40 Like the retinue of an army without a head,<br>
 Like feeding the unsheltered on lichen.<br>
 Like ridging furrows from the country<br>
 Like reaching the sky with a hook,<br>
 Like deprecating with the blood of thistles,<br>
 Like making light for the blind,<br>
 Like sharing clothes to the naked,<br>
 Like spreading buttermilk on the sands, <a name="page_525"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 525</font></a><br>
 Like feeding fish upon milk,<br>
 Like roofing a hall with leaves,<br>
 50 Like killing a tortoise with rods.<br>
 Like dissolving riches before a word.<br>
 I am a bard of the hall, I am a chick of the chair.<br>
 I will cause to loquacious bards a hindrance.<br>
 Before I am dragged to my harsh reward,<br>
 May we buy thee, that wilt protect us, thou son of Mary.</p>
