 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>HOW miserable it is to see<br>
 Tumult, commotion,<br>
 Wounds and confusion,<br>
 The Brithwyr in motion,<br>
 And a cruel fate.<br>
 With the impulse of destiny,<br>
 And for heaven's sake<br>
 Declare the discontinuance of the disaster!<br>
 It is not well that a son should be born:<br>
 10 His youthful destiny<br>
 Will necessarily be unbelief<br>
 And general privation:--<br>
 The Lloegrians declare it.<br>
 Alas! for the utter confusion<br>
 Until the end of the seventh<br>
 From the hard Calends.<br>
 True it is, deliverance will come<br>
 By means of the wished-for man.<br>
 May he throw open the White Mount,<br>
 20 And into Gwynedd make his entry!<br>
 The forces of the Cymry <a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a><br>
 Will be of one course with the lightning:<br>
 The signal of their deliverance<br>
 Will be a true relief, to the bosom:<br>
 The guarantee being Reged,<br>
 Whose share will be glorious.<br>
 Glorious will be our portion.<br>
 To me has been given sway,<br>
 I have become a predicting bard:<br>
 30 Camlan will be heard again<br>
 Scenes of groaning will again be seen,<br>
 And dismal lamentations,<br>
 And mischievous contention,<br>
 And the child will grow<br>
 Strong in battle, even when small.<br>
 People will see battles,<br>
 And the increase of fortresses;<br>
 Many a banner will be shattered:<br>
 A red banner I know there is,<br>
 40 It will be death to vanquish it<br>
 A signal of their coming,--<br>
 The heroic warriors,<br>
 Who will defend their fame.<br>
 Active their swords before thee,<br>
 Before me their virtues.<br>
 They shall receive their portion before death.<br>
 The day of causing blood-streams,<br>
 The day of assailing walls,<br>
 Will come for certain,<br>
 50 And fleets on the water,<br>
 Neither tax nor tribute<br>
 Nor service will succeed,<br>
 Nor the entreaties of the weak will avail,<br>
 Under the sway of the rulers.<br>
 May hens be relics <a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a><br>
 From Mona to Mynneu!<br>
 Believe in the living God for benefits,<br>
 Who will dispense us free blessings.<br>
 By imploring saints,<br>
 60 And the thorough comprehension of books,<br>
 May we obtain, an Thursday, a, portion<br>
 In the blissful region, the splendid place of rest!</p>
