 <p></p>
 <p>I. LET the furious Unhwch lead me on<br>
 To the front of the mutual conflict--<br>
 'Tis better to be killed than parley on terms.</p>
 <p>II. Let the furious Unhwch lead me on--<br>
 It was said in the Pass of Llech,--<br>
 "Dunawd the son of Pabo will not lurk."</p>
 <p>III. Let the furious Unhwch lead me on--<br>
 Like the sullen agitation of the sea was the war-expanding tumult.<br>
 Of Urien with the ardent grasp.</p>
 <p>IV. The eagle of Gal, Unhwch, bold and generous,<br>
 Wrathful in war, sure of conquest,<br>
 Was Urien with the ardent grasp.</p>
 <p><a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 356</font></a></p>
 <p>V. The eagle of Gal, Unhwch,<br>
 The possessor of the energetic soul . . .<br>
 The cell of the sea of smooth inlets with green surface.</p>
 <p>VI. A head I bear by my side,<br>
 That has been an assaulter between two hosts--<br>
 The magnanimous son of Cynvarch was its possessor.</p>
 <p>VII. A head I bear by my side,<br>
 The head of Urien, the mild leader of his army--<br>
 And on his white bosom the sable raven is perched.</p>
 <p>VIII, A head I bear in my shirt,<br>
 The head of Urien who governed a court in mildness--<br>
 And on his white bosom the sable raven gluts.</p>
 <p>IX. A head I bear in my hand,<br>
 He that was a soaring eagle, whose like will not be had,<br>
 His princely breast is assailed by the devourer.</p>
 <p>X. A head I bear by the side of my thigh,<br>
 That was the shield of his country,<br>
 That was a wheel in battle,<br>
 That was a ready sword in his country's battles.</p>
 <p>XI. A head I bear on my sword:<br>
 Better his being alive than that he should go to the grave;<br>
 He was a castle for old age.</p>
 <p>XII. A head I bear from the bordering land of Penawg,<br>
 Wide extended was his warfare:<br>
 Urien the eloquent, whose, fame went far.</p>
 <p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 357</font></a></p>
 <p>XIII. A head I bear on my shoulder,<br>
 That would not bring on me disgrace--<br>
 Woo to my hand that my lord is slain.</p>
 <p>XIV. A head I bear on my arm,<br>
 He that overcame the land of Bryneich--<br>
 But after being a hero, now on the hearse.</p>
 <p>XV. A head I bear in the grasp of my hand,<br>
 Of a chief that mildly governed a country;<br>
 The head, the most powerful pillar of Prydain.</p>
 <p>XVI. A head I bear that supported me,<br>
 Is there any known but he welcomed?<br>
 Woe my hand, gone is be that sustained me.</p>
 <p>XVII. A head I bear from the Riw,<br>
 With his lips foaming with blood--<br>
 Woe to Reged from this day!</p>
 <p>XVIII. My arm has not flagged; my bosom is greatly troubled;<br>
 Ah! my heart, is it not broken?<br>
 A head I bear that was my support.</p>
 <p>XIX. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day,<br>
 Under earth and stones:<br>
 Woe my hand, that the father of Owain is slain!</p>
 <p>XX. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day,<br>
 Amidst earth and oak:<br>
 Woe my hand, that my cousin is slain!</p>
 <p>XXI. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-night;<br>
 Under stones let it be left:<br>
 Woe my hand, what a step has fate decreed me!</p>
 <p><a name="page_358"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 358</font></a></p>
 <p>XXII. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-night<br>
 Amidst earth and green sods:<br>
 Woe my hand, that the son of Cynvarch is slain!</p>
 <p>XXIII. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day<br>
 Under the greensward and a tumulus:<br>
 Woe my hand, that my lord is slain!</p>
 <p>XXIV. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day,<br>
 Under earth and sand:<br>
 Woe my hand, the step that is decreed to me!</p>
 <p>XXV. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day<br>
 Under earth and nettles:<br>
 Woe my hand, that such a step could have happened to me!</p>
 <p>XXVI. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day<br>
 Under earth and blue stones:<br>
 Woe my hand, the step that has befallen me!</p>
 <p>XXVII. A master-feat of the world the brother has been in pursuit of;<br>
 For the horns of the buffalo, for a festive goblet<br>
 He was the depredator with the hounds in the covert of Reged!<br>
 XXVIII. A master-feat of the world the brother has eagerly sought,<br>
 For the equivocal horn of the buffalo;<br>
 He was the chaser with the hounds with the men of Reged.</p>
 <p>XXIX. Eurdyl will be joyless this night,<br>
 And multitudes (will be so) besides:<br>
 In Aber Lleu has Urien been slain.</p>
 <p><a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 359</font></a></p>
 <p>XXX. Eurdyl will be sorrowful from the tribulation of this night,<br>
 And from the fate that is to me befallen;<br>
 That her brother should be slain at Aber Lleu.</p>
 <p>XXXI. On Friday I saw great anxiety<br>
 Among the hosts of Baptism,<br>
 Like a swarm without a hive, bold in despair.</p>
 <p>XXXII. Were there not given to me by Run, greatly fond of war,<br>
 A hundred swarms and a hundred shields?<br>
 But one swarm was better far than all.</p>
 <p>XXXIII. Were there not given to me by Run, the famous chief,<br>
 A cantrev, and a hundred oxen?<br>
 But one gift was better far than those.</p>
 <p>XXXIV. In the lifetime of Run, the peaceless ranger,<br>
 The unjust will wallow in dangers;<br>
 May there be irons on the steeds of rapine.</p>
 <p>XXXV. The extreme I know of my trouble:<br>
 Is what all will hear in every season of warfare;<br>
 No one can charge me with anything.</p>
 <p>XXXVI. Dunawd, the leading horseman, would drive onward,<br>
 Intent upon making a corpse,<br>
 Against the onset of Owain.</p>
 <p>XXXVII. Dunawd, the chief of the age, would drive onward,<br>
 Intent upon making battle,<br>
 Against the conflict of Pasgen.</p>
 <p><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a></p>
 <p>XXXVIII. Gwallawg, the horseman of tumult, would drive onward,<br>
 Intent upon trying the sharpest edge,<br>
 Against the conflict of Elphin.</p>
 <p>XXXIX. Bran, the son of Mellyrn, would drive onward,<br>
 Collecting men to burn my ovens:<br>
 A wolf that looked grimly by the banks of Abers.</p>
 <p>XL. Morgant and his men would drive onward,<br>
 Collecting a host to burn my lands:<br>
 He was a mouse that scratched against a rock.</p>
 <p>XLI. I pushed onward when Elgno was slain;<br>
 The blade which Pyll brandished would gleam terribly,<br>
 If tents were pitched in his country.</p>
 <p>XLII. A second time I saw, after a conflict,<br>
 A golden shield on the shoulder of Urien;<br>
 A second to him there was Elgno Hen.</p>
 <p>XLIII. Upon the resolution there came a failing<br>
 From the dread of a furious horseman:<br>
 Will there be another compared with Urien?</p>
 <p>XLIV. Decapitated is my lord, his opponents are powerful:<br>
 Warriors will not love his enemies:<br>
 Many sovereigns has he consumed.</p>
 <p>XLV. The ardent disposition of Urien! it is sadness to me:<br>
 There is commotion in every region.<br>
 In pursuit of Llovan Llawdivro.</p>
 <p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 361</font></a></p>
 <p>XLVI. Gentle gate! thou art heard afar;<br>
 There is scarcely another deserving praise,<br>
 Since Urien is no more.</p>
 <p>XLVII. Many a hunting-dog and fine grown hawk<br>
 Have been trained on its flow,<br>
 Before Erlleon became desolate.</p>
 <p>XLVIII. This hearth, deserted by the shout of war,<br>
 More congenial on its floor would have been<br>
 The mead, and loquacious drinkers.</p>
 <p>XLIX. This hearth, will not nettles cover it?<br>
 While its defender lived,<br>
 More congenial to it were those who made requests.</p>
 <p>L. This hearth, will it not be covered by the greensward?<br>
 In the lifetime of Owain and Elphin,<br>
 Its cauldron boiled the prey.</p>
 <p>LI. This hearth, will it not be covered with musty fingers?<br>
 More congenial around its viand would have been<br>
 The gashing sword of the dauntless.</p>
 <p>LII. This hearth, will not the slender brambles cover it?<br>
 Burning wood used to be on it,<br>
 Which Reged was accustomed to give.</p>
 <p>LIII. This hearth, will not thorns cover it?<br>
 More congenial on it would have been the mixed group<br>
 Of Owain's social retinue.</p>
 <p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a></p>
 <p>LIV. This hearth, will it not be covered over by the ants?<br>
 More accustomed it was to bright torches,<br>
 And harmless festivities.</p>
 <p>LV. This hearth, will it not be covered with dock-leaves?<br>
 More congenial on its floor would have been<br>
 The mead, and loquacious drinkers.</p>
 <p>LVI. This hearth, will it not be turned up by the swine?<br>
 More congenial to it would have been<br>
 The joy of men, and the circling horns of banquet.</p>
 <p>LVII. This hearth, will it not be scratched up by the fowl?<br>
 Want would not approach it<br>
 In the lifetime of Owain and Urien.</p>
 <p>LVIII. This buttress, and that one there,<br>
 More congenial around them would have been<br>
 The joy of a host, and the tread of a minstrel.</p>
