 <p>SOVEREIGN of the power of the air, thou also<br>
 The satisfaction of my transgressions.<br>
 At midnight and at matins<br>
 There shone my lights.<br>
 Courteous the life of Minawg ap Llen,<br>
 Whom I saw here a short while ago.<br>
 The end, in the slope of Lleu.<br>
 Ardent was his push in combats;<br>
 Avagddu my son also.<br>
 10 Happy the Lord made him,<br>
 In the competition of songs,<br>
 His wisdom was better than mine,<br>
 The most skilful man ever heard of.<br>
 Gwydyon ap Don, of toiling spirits,<br>
 Enchanted a woman from blossoms,<br>
 And brought pigs from the south.<br>
 Since he had no sheltering cots,<br>
 Rapid curves, and plaited chains.<br>
 He made the forms of horses<br>
 20 From the springing<br>
 Plants, and illustrious saddles.<br>
 When are judged the chairs, <a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a><br>
 Excelling them (will be) mine,<br>
 My chair, my cauldron, and my laws,<br>
 And my pervading eloquence, meet for the chair.<br>
 I am called skilful in the court of Don.<br>
 I, and Euronwy, and Euron.<br>
 I saw a fierce conflict in Nant Frangeon<br>
 On a Sunday, at the time of dawn,<br>
 30 Between the bird of wrath and Gwydyon.<br>
 Thursday, certainly, they went to Mona<br>
 To obtain whirlings and sorcerers.<br>
 Arianrod, of laudable aspect, dawn of serenity,<br>
 The greatest disgrace evidently on the side of the Brython,<br>
 Hastily sends about his court the stream of a rainbow,<br>
 A stream that scares away violence from the earth.<br>
 The poison of its former state, about the world, it will leave.<br>
 They speak not falsely, the books of Beda.<br>
 The chair of the Preserver is here.<br>
 40 And till doom, shall continue in Europa.<br>
 May the Trinity grant us<br>
 Mercy in the day of judgment.<br>
 A fair alms from good men.</p>
