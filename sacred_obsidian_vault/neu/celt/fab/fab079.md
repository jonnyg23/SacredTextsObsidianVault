 <h2 align="CENTER">POEMS WHICH MENTION HENRY, OR THE SON OF HENRY</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">LXIV.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">A DIALOGUE BETWEEN MYRDIN AND HIS SISTER GWENDYDD.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">RED BOOK OF HERGEST I.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. I have come to thee to tell<br>
 Of the jurisdiction I have in the North;<br>
 The beauty of every region has been described to me.</p>
 <p>II. Since the action of Ardderyd and Erydon,<br>
 Gwendydd, and all that will happen to me,<br>
 Dull of understanding, to what place of festivity shall I go?</p>
 <p>III. I will address my twin-brother<br>
 Myrdin, a wise man and a diviner,<br>
 Since he is accustomed to make disclosures<br>
 When a maid goes to him.</p>
 <p>IV. I shall become the simpleton's song:<br>
 It is the ominous belief of the Cymry. The gale intimates<br>
 That the standard of Rydderch Hael is unobstructed.</p>
 <p>V. Though Rydderch has the pre-eminence,<br>
 And all the Cymry under him,<br>
 Yet, after him, who will come?</p>
 <p><a name="page_463"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 463</font></a></p>
 <p>VI. Rydderch Hael, the feller of the foe,<br>
 Dealt his stabs among them,<br>
 In the day of bliss at the ford of Tawy.</p>
 <p>VII. Rydderch Hael, while he is the enemy<br>
 Of the city of the bards in the region of the Clyd;<br>
 Where will he go to the ford?</p>
 <p>VIII. I will tell it to Gwendydd.<br>
 Since she has addressed me skilfully,<br>
 The day after to-morrow Rydderch Hael will not be.</p>
 <p>IX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 The intrepid in battle,<br>
 After Rydderch who will be?</p>
 <p>X. As Gwenddoleu was slain in the blood-spilling of Ardderyd,<br>
 And I have come from among the furze,<br>
 Morgant Mawr, the son of Sadyrnin.</p>
 <p>XI. I will ask my far-famed brother,<br>
 The fosterer of song among the streams,<br>
 Who will rule after Morgant?</p>
 <p>XII. As Gwenddoleu was slain in the bloodshed of Ardderyd,<br>
 And I wonder why I should be perceived,<br>
 The cry of the country to Urien.</p>
 <p>XIII, Thy head is of the colour of winter boar;<br>
 God has relieved thy necessities<br>
 Who will rule after Urien?</p>
 <p>XIV. Heaven has brought a heavy affliction<br>
 On me, and I am ill at last,<br>
 Maelgwn Hir over the land of Gwynedd.</p>
 <p><a name="page_464"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 464</font></a></p>
 <p>XV. From parting with my brother pines away<br>
 My heart, poor is my aspect along my furrowed cheek;<br>
 Now, after Maelgwn, who will rule?</p>
 <p>XVI. Run is his name impetuous in the gushing conflict;<br>
 And fighting in the van of the army,<br>
 The woe of Prydein of the day!</p>
 <p>XVII. Since thou art a companion and canon<br>
 Of Cunllaith, which with great expense we support,<br>
 To whom will Gwynedd go after Run?</p>
 <p>XVIII. Run his name, renowned in war;<br>
 What I predict will surely come to pass,<br>
 Gwendydd, the country will be in the hand of Beli.</p>
 <p>XIX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid in difficulties,<br>
 Who will rule after Beli?</p>
 <p>XX. Since my reason is gone with ghosts of the mountain,<br>
 And I myself am pensive,<br>
 After Beli, his son Iago.</p>
 <p>XXI. Since thy reason is gone with ghosts of the mountain,<br>
 And thou thyself art pensive,<br>
 Who will rule after Iago?</p>
 <p>XXII. He that comes before me with a lofty mien,<br>
 Moving to the social banquet;<br>
 After Iago, his son Cadvan?</p>
 <p>XXIII. The songs have fully predicted<br>
 That one of universal fame will come;<br>
 Who will rule after Cadvan?</p>
 <p><a name="page_465"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 465</font></a></p>
 <p>XXIV. The country of the brave Cadwallawn,<br>
 The four quarters of the world shall hear of it;<br>
 The heads of the Angles will fall to the ground,<br>
 And there will be a world to admire it.</p>
 <p>XXV. Though I see thy cheek so direful,<br>
 It comes impulsively to my mind,<br>
 Who will rule after Cadwallawn?</p>
 <p>XXVI. A tall man holding a conference,<br>
 And Prydein under one sceptre,<br>
 The best son of Cymro, Cadwaladyr.</p>
 <p>XXVII. He that comes before me mildly,<br>
 His abilities, are they not worthless?<br>
 After Cadwaladyr, Idwal.</p>
 <p>XXVIII. I will ask thee mildly,<br>
 Far-famed, and best of men on earth,<br>
 Who will rule after Idwal?</p>
 <p>XXIX. There will rule after Idwal,<br>
 In consequence of a dauntless one being called forth,<br>
 White-shielded Howel, the son of Cadwal.</p>
 <p>XXX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 The intrepid in war,<br>
 Who will rule after Howel?</p>
 <p>XXXI. I will tell his illustrious fame,<br>
 Gwendydd, before I part from thee;<br>
 After Howel, Rodri.</p>
 <p>XXXII. Cynan in Mona will be,<br>
 He will not preserve his rights;<a name="page_466"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 466</font></a><br>
 And before the son of Rodri may be called,<br>
 The son of Cealedigan will be.</p>
 <p>XXXIII. I will ask on account of the world,<br>
 And answer thou me gently;<br>
 Who will rule after Cynan?</p>
 <p>XXXIV. Since Gwenddoleu was slain in the bloodshed of<br>
 Ardderyd, thou art filled with dismay;<br>
 Mervyn Vrych from the region of Manaw.</p>
 <p>XXXV. I will ask my brother renowned in fame,<br>
 Lucid his song, and he the best of men,<br>
 Who will rule after Mervyn?</p>
 <p>XXXVI. I will declare, from no malevolence,<br>
 The oppression of. Prydein, but from concern;<br>
 After Mervyn, Rodri Mawr.</p>
 <p>XXXVII. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid in the day of the war-shout;<br>
 Who will rule after the son of Rodri Mawr?</p>
 <p>XXXVIII. On the banks of the Conwy in the conflict of Wednesday,<br>
 Admired will be the eloquence<br>
 Of the hoary sovereign Anarawd.</p>
 <p>XXXIX. I will address my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid in the day of mockery,<br>
 Who will rule after Anarawd?</p>
 <p>XL. The next is nearer to the time<br>
 Of unseen messengers;<br>
 The sovereignty in the band of Howel.</p>
 <p><a name="page_467"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 467</font></a></p>
 <p>XLI. The Borderers have not been,<br>
 And will not be nearer to Paradise.<br>
 An order from a kiln is no worse than from a church.</p>
 <p>XLII. I will ask my beloved brother,<br>
 Whom I have seen celebrated in fame,<br>
 Who will rule after the Borderers?</p>
 <p>XLIII. A year and a half to loquacious<br>
 Barons, whose lives shall be shortened;<br>
 Every careless one will be disparaged.</p>
 <p>XLIV. Since thou art a companion and canon of Cunllaith,<br>
 The mercy of God to thy soul!<br>
 Who will rule after the Barons?</p>
 <p>XLV. A single person will arise from obscurity,<br>
 Who will not preserve his countenance;<br>
 Cynan of the dogs will possess Cymry.</p>
 <p>XLVI. I will ask thee on account of the world,<br>
 Answer thou me gently,<br>
 Who will rule after Cynan?</p>
 <p>XLVII. A man from a distant foreign country;<br>
 They will batter impregnable Caers<br>
 They say a king from a baron.</p>
 <p>XLVIII. I will ask on account of the world,<br>
 Since thou knowest the meaning;<br>
 Who will rule after the Baron?</p>
 <p>XLIX. I will foretell of Serven Wyn,<br>
 A constant white-shielded messenger,<br>
 Brave, and strong like a white encircled prison; <a name="page_468"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 468</font></a><br>
 He will traverse the Countries of treacherous sovereigns;<br>
 And they will tremble before him as far as Prydein.</p>
 <p>L. I will ask my blessed brother,<br>
 For it is I that is inquiring it,<br>
 Who will rule after Serven Wyn?</p>
 <p>LI. Two white-shielded Belis<br>
 Will then come and cause tumult;<br>
 Golden peace will not be.</p>
 <p>LII. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid among the Cymry,<br>
 Who will rule after the two white-shielded Belis?</p>
 <p>LIII. A. single passionate one with a beneficent mien,<br>
 Counselling a battle of defence;<br>
 Who will rule before the extermination?</p>
 <p>LIV. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid in the battle,<br>
 Who is the single passionate one<br>
 That thou predictest then?<br>
 What his name? what is he? when will he come?</p>
 <p>LV. Gruffyd his name, vehement and handsome:<br>
 It is natural that he should throw lustre on his kindred;<br>
 He will rule over the land of Prydein.</p>
 <p>LVI. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid in battles,<br>
 Who shall possess it after Gruffyd?</p>
 <p>LVII. I will declare from no malevolence,<br>
 The oppression of Prydein, but from concern;<br>
 After Gruffyd, Gwyn Gwarther.</p>
 <p><a name="page_469"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 469</font></a></p>
 <p>LVIII. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 The intrepid in war,<br>
 Who will rule after Gwyn Gwarther?</p>
 <p>LIX. Alas! fair Gwendydd, great is the prognostication of the oracle,<br>
 And the tales of the Sybil;<br>
 Of an odious stock will be the two Idases;<br>
 For land they will be admired; from their jurisdiction, long animosity.</p>
 <p>LX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid in the battles,<br>
 Who will rule after them?</p>
 <p>LXI. I will predict that no youth will venture;<br>
 A king, a lion with unflinching hand,<br>
 Gylvin Gevel with a wolf's grasp.</p>
 <p>LXII. I will ask my profound brother,<br>
 Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<br>
 After that who will be sovereign?</p>
 <p>LXIII. To the multiplicity of the number of the stars<br>
 Will his retinue be compared;<br>
 He is Mackwy Dau Hanner.</p>
 <p>LXIV. I will ask my unprotected brother,<br>
 The key of difficulty, the benefit of a lord--<br>
 Who will rule after Dan Hanner?</p>
 <p>LXV. There will be a mixture of the Gwyddelian tongue in the battle,<br>
 With the Cymro, and a fierce conflict;<br>
 He is the lord of eight chief Caers.</p>
 <p><a name="page_470"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 470</font></a></p>
 <p>LXVI. I will ask my pensive brother,<br>
 Who has read the book of Cado,<br>
 Who will rule after him?</p>
 <p>LXVII. I say that he is from Reged,<br>
 Since I am solemnly addressed;<br>
 The whelp of the illustrious Henri,<br>
 Never in his age will there be deliverance.</p>
 <p>LXVIII. I will ask my brother renowned in fame,<br>
 Undaunted among the Cymry,<br>
 Who will rule after the son of Henri?</p>
 <p>LXIX. When there will be a bridge on the Tav, and another on the Tywi,<br>
 Confusion will come upon Lloegyr,<br>
 And I will predict after the son of Henri,<br>
 Such and such a king and troublous times will be.</p>
 <p>LXX. I will ask my blessed brother,<br>
 For it is I that is inquiring,<br>
 Who will rule after such and such a king?</p>
 <p>LXXI. A silly king will come,<br>
 And the men of Lloegyr will deceive him;<br>
 There will be no prosperity of country under him.</p>
 <p>LXXII. Myrdin fair, of fame-conferring song,<br>
 Wrathful in the world,<br>
 What will be in the age of the foolish one?</p>
 <p>LXXIII. When Lloegyr will be groaning,<br>
 And Cymir full of malignity,<br>
 An army will be moving to and fro.</p>
 <p><a name="page_471"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 471</font></a></p>
 <p>LXXIV. Myrdin fair, gifted in speech,<br>
 Tell me no falsehood;<br>
 What will be after the army?</p>
 <p>LXXV. There will arise one out of the six<br>
 That have long been in concealment;<br>
 Over Lloegyr he will have the mastery.</p>
 <p>LXXVI. Myrdin fair, of fame-conferring stock,<br>
 Let the wind turn inside the house,<br>
 Who will rule after that?</p>
 <p>LXXVII. It is established that Owein should come,<br>
 And conquer as far as London,<br>
 To give the Cymry glad tidings.</p>
 <p>LXXVIII. Myrdin fair, most gifted and most famed,<br>
 For thy word I will believe,<br>
 Owein, how long will he continue?</p>
 <p>LXXIX. Gwendydd, listen to a rumour,<br>
 Let the wind turn in the valley,<br>
 Five years and two, as in time of yore.</p>
 <p>LXXX. I will ask my profound brother,<br>
 Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<br>
 Who will thence be sovereign?</p>
 <p>LXXXI. When Owein will be in Manaw,<br>
 And a battle in Prydyn close by,<br>
 There will be a man with men under him.</p>
 <p>LXXXII. I will ask my profound brother,<br>
 Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<br>
 After that who will be sovereign?</p>
 <p><a name="page_472"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 472</font></a></p>
 <p>LXXXIII. A ruler of good breeding and good will he be,<br>
 Will conquer the land,<br>
 And the country will be happy with joy.</p>
 <p>LXXXIV. I will ask my profound brother,<br>
 Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<br>
 After that who will be sovereign?</p>
 <p>LXXXV. Let there be a cry in the valley<br>
 Beli Hir and his men like the whirlwind;<br>
 Blessed be the Cymry, woe to the Gynt.</p>
 <p>LXXXVI. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<br>
 Intrepid in battles,<br>
 After Beli who will be the possessor?</p>
 <p>LXXXVII. Let there be a cry in the Aber,<br>
 Beli Hir and his numerous troops;<br>
 Blessed be the Cymry, woe to the Gwyddyl.</p>
 <p>LXXXVIII. I will address my farfamed twin-brother<br>
 Intrepid in war;<br>
 Why woe to the Gwyddyl?</p>
 <p>LXXXIX. I will predict that one prince will be<br>
 Of Gwynedd, after your affliction;<br>
 You will have a victory over every nation.</p>
 <p>XC. The canon of Morvryn, how united to us<br>
 Was Myrdin Vrych with the powerful host,<br>
 What will happen until the wish be accomplished?</p>
 <p>XCI. When Cadwaladyr will descend,<br>
 Having a large united host with him, <a name="page_473"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 473</font></a><br>
 On Wednesday to defend the men of Gwynedd,<br>
 Then will come the men of Caer Garawedd.</p>
 <p>XCII. Do not separate abruptly from me,<br>
 From a dislike to the conference;<br>
 In what part will Cadwaladyr descend?</p>
 <p>XCIII. When Cadwaladyr descends<br>
 Into the valley of the Tywi,<br>
 Hard pressed will be the Abers<br>
 And the Brython will disperse the Brithwyr.</p>
 <p>XCIV. I will ask my profound brother,<br>
 Whom I have seen tenderly nourished;<br>
 Who will rule from thenceforth?</p>
 <p>XCV. When a boor will know three languages<br>
 In Mona, and his son be of honourable descent,<br>
 Gwynedd will be heard to be abounding in riches.</p>
 <p>XCVI. Who will drive Lloegyr from the borders<br>
 Of the sea, who will move upon Dyved?<br>
 And as to the Cymry, who will succour them?</p>
 <p>XCVII. The far-extended rout and tumult of Rydderch,<br>
 And the armies of Cadwaladyr,<br>
 Above the river Tardennin,<br>
 Broke the key of men.</p>
 <p>XCVIII. Do not separate abruptly from me,<br>
 From dislike to the conference,<br>
 What death will carry off Cadwaladyr?</p>
 <p>XCIX. He will be pierced by a spear from the strong timber <a name="page_474"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 474</font></a><br>
 Of a ship, and a hand before the evening;<br>
 The day will be a disgrace to the Cymry.</p>
 <p>C. Do not separate abruptly from me<br>
 From dislike to the conference,<br>
 How long will Cadwaladyr reign?</p>
 <p>CI. Three months and three long years,<br>
 And full three hundred years<br>
 With occasional battles, he will rule.</p>
 <p>CII. Do not separate abruptly from me<br>
 From dislike to the conference,<br>
 Who will rule after Cadwaladyr?</p>
 <p>CIII. To Gwendydd I will declare;<br>
 Age after age I will predict;<br>
 After Cadwaladyr, Cynda.</p>
 <p>CIV. A hand upon the sword, another upon the cross,<br>
 Let every one take care of his life;<br>
 With Cyndav there is no reconciliation.</p>
 <p>CV. I will foretell that there will be one prince<br>
 Of Gwynedd, after your affliction,<br>
 You will overcome every nation.</p>
 <p>CVI. And as to the tribe of the children of Adam,<br>
 Who have proceeded from his flesh,<br>
 Will their freedom extend to the judgment?</p>
 <p>CVII. From the time the Cymry shall be without the aid<br>
 Of battle, and altogether without keeping their mien,<br>
 It will be impossible to say who will be ruler.</p>
 <p><a name="page_475"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 475</font></a></p>
 <p>CVIII. Gwendydd, the delicately fair,<br>
 The first will be the most puissant in Prydein;<br>
 Lament, ye wretched Cymry!</p>
 <p>CIX. When extermination becomes the highest duty,<br>
 From the sea to the shoreless land,<br>
 Say, lady, that the world is at an end.</p>
 <p>CX. And after extermination becomes the highest duty,<br>
 Who will there be to keep order?<br>
 Will there be a church, and a portion for a priest?</p>
 <p>CXI. There will be no portion for priest nor minstrel,<br>
 Nor repairing to the altar,<br>
 Until the heaven falls to the earth.</p>
 <p>CXII. My twin-brother, since thou hast answered me,<br>
 Myrdin, son of Morvryn the skilful,<br>
 Sad is the tale thou hast uttered.</p>
 <p>CXIII. I will declare to Gwendydd,<br>
 For seriously hast thou inquired of me,<br>
 Extermination, lady, will be the end.</p>
 <p>CXIV. What I have hitherto predicted<br>
 To Gwendydd, the idol of princes.<br>
 It will come to pass to the smallest tittle.</p>
 <p>CXV. Twin-brother, since these things will happen to me,<br>
 Even for the souls of thy brethren,<br>
 What sovereign after him will be?</p>
 <p><a name="page_476"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 476</font></a></p>
 <p>CXVI. Gwendydd fair, the chief of courtesy,<br>
 I will seriously declare,<br>
 That never shall be a sovereign afterwards.</p>
 <p>CXVII. Alas I thou dearest, for the cold separation,<br>
 After the coming of tumult,<br>
 That by a sovereign brave and fearless<br>
 Thou shouldst be placed under earth.</p>
 <p>CXVIII. The air of heaven will scatter<br>
 Rash resolution, which deceives, if believed:<br>
 Prosperity until the judgment is certain.</p>
 <p>CXIX. By thy dissolution, thou tenderly nourished,<br>
 Am I not left cheerless?<br>
 A delay will be good destiny when will be given<br>
 Praise to him who tells the truth.</p>
 <p>CXX. From thy retreat arise, and unfold<br>
 The books of Awen without fear;<br>
 And the discourse of a maid, and the repose of a dream.</p>
 <p>CXXI. Dead is Morgeneu, dead Cyvrennin<br>
 Moryal. Dead is Moryen, the bulwark of battle;<br>
 The heaviest grief is, Myrdin, for thy destiny.</p>
 <p>CXXII. The Creator has caused me heavy affliction;<br>
 Dead is Morgeneu, dead is Mordav,<br>
 Dead is Moryen, I wish to die.</p>
 <p>CXXIII. My only brother, chide me not;<br>
 Since the battle of Ardderyd I am ill; <a name="page_477"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 477</font></a><br>
 It is instruction that I seek;<br>
 To God I commend thee.</p>
 <p>CXXIV. I, also, commend thee,<br>
 To the, Chief of all creatures<br>
 Gwendydd fair, the refuge of songs.</p>
 <p>CXXV. The songs too long have tarried<br>
 Concerning universal fame to come;<br>
 Would to God they had come to pass!</p>
 <p>CXXVI. Gwendydd, be not dissatisfied;<br>
 Has not the burden been consigned to the earth?<br>
 Every one must give up what he loves.</p>
 <p>CXXVII. While I live, I will not forsake thee,<br>
 And until the judgment will bear thee in mind;<br>
 Thy entrenchment is the heaviest calamity.</p>
 <p>CXXVIII. Swift is the steed, and free the wind;<br>
 I will commend my blameless brother<br>
 To God, the supreme Ruler;<br>
 Partake of the communion before thy death.</p>
 <p>CXXIX. I will not receive the communion<br>
 From excommunicated monks,<br>
 With their cloaks on their hips;<br>
 May God himself give me communion!</p>
 <p>CXXX. I will commend my blameless<br>
 Brother in the supreme Caer;<br>
 May God take care of Myrdin!</p>
 <p><a name="page_478"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 478</font></a></p>
 <p>CXXXI. I, too, will commend my blameless<br>
 Sister in the supreme Caer;--<br>
 May God take care of Gwendydd. Amen!</p>
