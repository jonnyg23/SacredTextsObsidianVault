Being in great hunger, or haste, he thought it waste of time to cut his meat into smaller pieces than he could possibly swallow; besides, solid junks would stand by his ribs and do the more good.  
 <p>He made but two morsels of a quarter of a pound of beef; and in bolting the last it stuck in his throat. In an instant he went blue in the face and fell on the floor. The landlord ran for a surgeon, and by good luck found one at home, the other side of the street. "Stand clear a bit, and open the man's trap," said the doctor. With much trouble the Zennor man's jaws were forced open, and the doctor feeling a portion of the meat pulled out a piece about six inches long.</p>  
 <p>The patient was soon restored and ready for another such meal.</p>

Saying this he drew from his pocket a sheet of paper, and gave it to the doctor, telling him he might keep it, if he had a mind to see how to make a will. He intended to make another the next Sunday, because he had more, things to bequeath now than when he made the testament, of which the following is a faithful copy:—</p>  
 <p>"I'll make my will while I am well. I will bestow my riches. I'll give to Ellek, <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">*</font></a> my eldest son, my best Coat, Jacket, and my Breeches. As for my watch et es in pawn else Elexander should have that. Neckey shall have the courage Horse, and Jan the little Sprat. Mary shall have the milking Cow, and Lystria shall have the Heifer. Fillis shall have the flock of Sheep, and wat can I do better? Old Polly shall have the Puss <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">†</font></a> of goold, and that will most maintain her. Sally shall have the old brass Pan, the Bucket, and the Strainer.</p>
