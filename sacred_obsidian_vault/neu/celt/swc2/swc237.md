 <p>We wish to correct an error that many persons, not Cornish, entertain with regard to the language of Cornish working people. Their mistake originates, in many instances, from seeing in stories—misnamed Cornish, and for the most part written by strangers to the country—such an uncouth jargon, put into the mouths of West Country folks, which is no more the common dialect of Cornwall than it is of Jericho. Our English will bear comparison with that of any rural district, and, in most cases, be found more correct, though somewhat antiquated.

Now that's a fine word, my dear, and I mean to use et on all occasions; like An’ Betty Brea, up your way, who es twenty times a day askan 'Do ’e knaw the sig-ni-fi-ca-tion' of some fiddle-stick's end, or other, that she may use her one and word, picked up from a local preacher.</p>  
 <p>"I've been minded lately of a story that was told me by an old comrade—Uncle Tom Trevorrow, who's many years older than I am. When I was a boy, workan at Trink Stamps, he was married; and he was then as fine a man as one would meet of a long summer's day. If you'll have patience enow I'll tell ’e the story of</p>
