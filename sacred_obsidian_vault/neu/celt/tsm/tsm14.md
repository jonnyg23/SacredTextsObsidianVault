 <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XI</h3>
 <h1 align="CENTER">In the Kingdom of Seals</h1>
 <p>The sea fairies have grey skin-coverings and resemble seals. They dwell in cave houses on the borders of Land-under-Waves, where they have a kingdom of their own. They love music and the dance, like the green land fairies, and when harper or piper plays on the beach they come up to listen, their sloe-black eyes sparkling with joy. On moonlight nights they hear the mermaids singing on the rocks when human beings are fast asleep, and they call to them: "Sing again the old sea croons; sing again!" All night long the sea fairies call thus when mermaids cease to sing, and the mermaids sing again and again to them. When the wind pipes loud and free, and the sea leaps and whirls and swings and cries aloud with wintry merriment, the sea fairies dance with the dancing waves, tossing white petals of foam over their beads, and twining pearls of spray about their necks. They love to hunt the silvern salmon in the forests of sea-tangle</p>

 <p>and in ocean's deep blue glens, and far up dark ravines through which flow rivers of sweet mountain waters gemmed with stars.</p>
 <p>The sea fairies have a language of their own, and they are also skilled in human speech. When they come ashore they can take the forms of men or women, and turn billows into dark horses with grey manes and long grey tails, and on these they ride over mountain and moor.</p>
 <p>There was once a fisherman who visited the palace of the queen of sea fairies, and told on his return all he had seen and all he had heard. He dwelt in a little township nigh to John-o'-Groat's House, and was wont to catch fish and seals. When he found that he could earn much money by hunting seals, whose skins make warm winter clothing, he troubled little about catching salmon or cod, and worked constantly as a seal-hunter. He crept among the rocks searching for his prey, and visited lonely seal-haunted islands across the Pentland Firth, where he often found the strange sea-prowlers lying on smooth flat ledges of rock fast asleep in the warm sunshine.</p>
 <p>In his house he had great bundles of dried sealskins, and people came from a distance to purchase them from him. His fame as a seal-hunter went far and wide.</p>
 <p>One evening a dark stranger rode up to his house, mounted on a black, spirited mare with grey</p>
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>
 <p>mane and grey tail. He called to the fisherman who came out, and then said: "Make haste and ride with me towards the east. My master desires to do business with you."</p>
 <p>"I have no horse," the fisherman answered, "but I shall walk to your master's house on the morrow.</p>
 <p>Said the stranger: "Come now. Ride with me. My good mare is fleet-footed and strong."</p>
 <p>"As you will," answered the fisherman, who at once mounted the mare behind the stranger.</p>
 <p>The mare turned round and right-about, and galloped eastward faster than the wind of March. Shingle rose in front of her like rock-strewn sea-spray, and a sand-cloud gathered and swept out behind like mountain mists that are scattered before a gale. The fisherman gasped for breath, for although the wind was blowing against his back when he mounted the mare, it blew fiercely in his face as he rode on. The mare went fast and far until she drew nigh to a precipice. Near the edge of it she halted suddenly. The fisherman found then that the wind was still blowing seaward, although he had thought it had veered round as he rode. Never before had he sat on the back of so fleet-footed a mare.</p>
 <p>Said the stranger: "We have almost reached my master's dwelling."</p>
 <p>The fisherman looked round about him with</p>
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a></p>
 <p>surprise, and saw neither house nor the smoke of one. "Where is your master?" he asked.</p>
 <p>Said the stranger: "You shall see him presently. Come with me."</p>
 <p>As he spoke he walked towards the edge of the precipice and looked over. The fisherman did the same, and saw nothing but the grey lonely sea heaving in a long slow swell, and sea-birds wheeling and sliding down the wind.</p>
 <p>"Where is your master?" he asked once again.</p>
 <p>With that the stranger suddenly clasped the seal-hunter in his arms, and crying, "Come with me," leapt over the edge of the precipice. The mare leapt with her master.</p>
 <p>Down, down they fell through the air, scattering the startled sea-birds. Screaming and fluttering, the birds rose in clouds about and above them, and down ever down the men and the mare continued to fall till they plunged into the sea, and sank and sank, while the light around them faded into darkness deeper than night. The fisherman wondered to find himself still alive as he passed through the sea depths, seeing naught, hearing naught, and still moving swiftly. At length he ceased to sink, and went forward. He suffered no pain or discomfort, nor was he afraid. His only feeling was of wonder, and in the thick, cool darkness he wondered greatly what would</p>
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a></p>
 <p>happen next. At length he saw a faint green light, and as he went onward the light grew brighter and brighter, until the glens and bens and forests of the sea kingdom arose before his eyes. Then he discovered that he was swimming beside the stranger and that they had both been changed into seals.</p>
 <p>Said the stranger: "Yonder is my master's house."</p>
 <p>The fisherman looked, and saw a township of foam-white houses on the edge of a great sea-forest and fronted by a bank of sea-moss which was green as grass but more beautiful, and very bright. There were crowds of seal-folk in the township. He saw them moving about to and fro, and heard their voices, but he could not understand their speech. Mothers nursed their babes, and young children played games on banks of green sea-moss, and from the brown and golden sea-forest came sounds of music and the shouts of dancers.</p>
 <p>Said the stranger: "Here is my master's house. Let us enter."</p>
 <p>He led the fisherman towards the door of a great foam-white palace with its many bright windows. It was thatched with red tangle, and the door was of green stone. The door opened as smoothly as a summer wave that moves across a river mouth, and the fisherman entered with his</p>
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>
 <p>guide. He found himself in a dimly-lighted room, and saw an old grey seal stretched on a bed, and heard him moaning with pain. Beside the bed Jay a blood-stained knife, and the fisherman knew at a glance that it was his own. Then he remembered that, not many hours before, he had stabbed a seal, and that it had escaped by plunging into the sea, carrying the knife in its back.</p>
 <p>The fisherman was startled to realize that the old seal on the bed was the very one he had tried to kill, and his heart was filled with fear. He threw himself down and begged for forgiveness and mercy, for he feared that he would be put to death.</p>
 <p>The guide lifted up the knife and asked: "Have you ever seen this knife before?" He spoke in human language.</p>
 <p>"That is my knife, alas!" exclaimed the fisherman.</p>
 <p>Said the guide: "The wounded seal is my father. Our doctors are unable to cure him. They can do naught without your help. That is why I visited your house and urged you to come with me. I ask your pardon for deceiving you, O man! but as I love my father greatly, I had to do as I have done."</p>
 <p>"Do not ask my pardon," the fisherman said; "I have need of yours. I am sorry and ashamed for having stabbed your father."</p>
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a></p>
 <p>Said the guide: "Lay your hand on the wound and wish it to be healed."</p>
 <p>The fisherman laid his hand on the wound, and the pain that the seal suffered passed into his hand, but did not remain long. As if by magic, the wound was healed at once. Then the old grey seal rose up strong and well again.</p>
 <p>Said the guide: "You have served us well this day, O man!"</p>
 <p>When the fisherman had entered the house, all the seals that were within were weeping tears of sorrow, but they ceased to weep as soon as he had laid his hand on the wound, and when the old seal rose up they all became merry and bright.</p>
 <p>The fisherman wondered what would happen next. For a time the seals seemed to forget his presence, but at length his guide spoke to him and said: "Now, O man! you can return to your own home where your wife and children await you. I shall lead you through the sea depths, and take you on my mare across the plain which we crossed when coming hither."</p>
 <p>"I give you thanks," the fisherman exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Said the guide: "Before you leave there is one thing you must do; you must take a vow never again to hunt seals."</p>
 <p>The fisherman answered: "Surely, I promise never again to hunt for seals."</p>
 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a></p>
 <p>Said the guide: "If ever you break your promise you shall die. I counsel you to keep it, and as long as you do so you will prosper. Every time you set lines, or cast a net, you will catch much fish. Our seal-servants will help you, and if you wish to reward them for their services, take with you in your boat a harp or pipe and play sweet music, for music is the delight of all seals."</p>
 <p>The fisherman vowed he would never break his promise, and the guide then led him back to dry land. As soon as he reached the shore he ceased to be a seal and became a man once again. The guide, who had also changed shape, breathed over a great wave and, immediately, it became a dark mare with grey mane and grey tail. He then mounted the mare, and bade the fisherman mount behind him. The mare rose in the air as lightly as wind-tossed spray, and passing through the clouds of startled sea-birds reached the top of the precipice. On she raced at once, raising the shingle in front and a cloud of sand behind. The night was falling and the stars began to appear, but it was not quite dark when the fisherman's house was reached.</p>
 <p>The fisherman dismounted, and his guide spoke and said: "Take this from me, and may you live happily."</p>
 <p>He handed the fisherman a small bag, and crying: "Farewell! Remember your vow," he</p>
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a></p>
 <p>wheeled his mare right round and passed swiftly out of sight.</p>
 <p>The fisherman entered his house, and found his wife still there. "You have returned," she said. "How did you fare?"</p>
 <p>"I know not yet," he answered. Then he sat down and opened the bag, and to his surprise and delight found it was full of pearls.</p>
 <p>His wife uttered a cry of wonder, and said: "From whom did you receive this treasure?"</p>
 <p>The fisherman then related all that had taken place, and his wife wondered to hear him.</p>
 <p>"Never again will I hunt seals," he exclaimed. And he kept his word and prospered, and lived happily until the day of his death.</p>
