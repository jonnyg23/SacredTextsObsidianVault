 <p>About the year of God 1259, the Danes and Norwegians did land at the ferry of Unes, with a resolution to invade Sutherland and the neighbouring provinces, against whom William, Earl of Sutherland, made resistance, and encountered with them betwixt the town of Dornoch and the ferry at Unes, at a place called Embo. After a sharp conflict the Danes are overthrown, their general slain, with many others, and the rest chased to their ships; in memory of which a monument of stone was there erected, which was called Righ-Chrois, that is, the king's or general's cross, which, together with divers burials, is there to be seen at this day.</p>
