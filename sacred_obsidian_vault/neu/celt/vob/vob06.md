 <p>Now once upon a time when Forgoll the poet was with Mongán, the latter at a certain hour of the day went before his [10] stronghold, where he found a bardic scholar <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">1</font></a> learning his lesson. <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">2</font></a> Said Mongán:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'All is lasting<br> In a cloak of sackcloth; <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> In due course thou shalt attain<br> The end of thy studies.' <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">4</font></a> [15]</dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Mongán then took pity on the scholar, who was in the cloak of sackcloth. He had little of any substance. In order to know whether he would be a truthful and good messenger, <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">5</font></a> he said to hint, promising him . . .: 'Go now,' said Mongán, 'until</p>

 <p>thou reach the fairy knoll of Lethet Oidni, <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">1</font></a> and bring a precious stone which I have there, and for thyself take a pound of white silver, in which are twelve ounces. Thou shalt have help from them. <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">2</font></a> This is thy journey <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">3</font></a> from here, to Cnocc Bane. <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">4</font></a> Thou wilt find welcome in the fairy knoll of Cnocc [5] Bane for my sake. Thence to Duma Granerit. <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">5</font></a> Thence to the fairy knoll of Lethet Oidni. Take the stone for me, and go to the stream of Lethet Oidni, where thou wilt find a pound of gold, in which are nine ounces. Take that with thee for me.'</p>  
 <p>The man went on his journey. In the fairy knoll of Cnocc [10] Bane he found a noble-looking couple <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">6</font></a> to meet him. They gave great welcome to a messenger of Mongán's. It was his due. He went further. He found another couple in Durna Granerit, where he had the same welcome. He went to the fairy knoll of Lethet Oidni, where again he found another couple. [15] They gave great welcome to a man of Mongán's. He was most hospitably entertained, as on the other nights. There was a marvellous chamber <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">7</font></a> at the side of the couple's house. Mongán had told him that he should ask for its key. He did so. <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">8</font></a> The key was brought to him. He opens it. He had been told [20] not to take anything out of the house except what he had been sent for. He does so. The key he gave back to the couple;</p>

 <p>his stone, however, and his pound of silver he took with him. Thereupon he went to the stream of Lethet Oidni, out of which he took his pound of gold. He went back to Mongán, to whom he gave his stone and his gold. He himself takes his silver. [5] These were his wanderings.</p>
