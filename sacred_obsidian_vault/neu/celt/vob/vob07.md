 <p>Findtigernd, <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">2</font></a> Mongán's wife, besought Mongán to tell her the simple truth of his adventures. He asked of her a respite of seven years. It was granted. Then that period arrived. The [15] men of Ireland had a great gathering at Usnech in Meath, the year of the death of Ciarán the son of the Carpenter, and of the slaying of Túathal Maelgarb, <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">3</font></a> and of the taking of the kingship by Diarmait. <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">4</font></a> The hosts were on (the hill of) Usnech.

Seven conspicuous men were there. Within [5] the house there was a marvellous spread of quilts and covers, and of wonderful jewels. Seven vats of wine there were. Mongán was made welcome in the house. He stayed there. He became intoxicated. It was then and there that Mongán sang the 'Frenzy' to his wife, since he had [10] promised he would tell her something of his adventures. It seemed to them it was not very long they were in that house. They deemed it to be no more but one night. However, they were there a full year. When they awoke, they saw it was Rathmore <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">1</font></a> of Moy-Linny in which they were.</p>
