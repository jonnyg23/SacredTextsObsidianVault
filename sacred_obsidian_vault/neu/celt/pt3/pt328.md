 <h3 align="CENTER">THE STORY OF CONALL GULBAN.</h3>
 <p>THERE was at some time a young king in Eirinn, and when he came to man's estate the high counsellors of the realm were counselling him to marry; but he himself was inclined to go to foreign countries first, so that he might get more <a href="errata.htm#7">knowledge</a>, and that he might be more instructed how the realm should be regulated; and he put each thing in order for matters to be arranged till he should come back. He staid there a while till he had got every learning that he thought he could get in that realm. Then he left Greece and he went "do'n Fheadailte," to the Italy to get more learning. When he was in that country he made acquaintance with the young king of "an Iubhair," and they were good comrades together; and when they had got every learning that they had to get in Italy, they thought of going home.</p>
 <p>The young king of the Iubhar gave an invitation to</p>
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p>
 <p>the young king of Eirinn that be should go to the realm of the Iubhar, and that he should stay a while there with him. The young king of Eirinn went with him, and they were together in the fortress of Iubhar for a while, at sports and hunting</p>
 <p>The king of Iubhar had a sister who was exceedingly handsome; she was "stuama beusach," modest and gentle in her ways, and she was right (well) instructed. The young king of Eirinn fell in love with her, and she fell in love with the young king of Eirinn, and he was willing to marry her, and she was willing so marry him, and the king of Iubhar was willing that the wedding should go on; but the young king of Eirinn went home first, and he gathered together the high counsellors of the realm, and he told them what he desired to do; and the high counsellors of the realm of Eirinn counselled their king to marry the sister of the kin, of Iubhar. <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>The king; of Eirinn went back and he married the king's sister; and the king of the Iubhar and the king of Eirinn made "co-cheanghal" a league together. If straits, or hardships, or extremity, or anything counter should come upon either, the other was to go to his aid.</p>
 <p>When they had settled each thing as it should be, the two kings gave each other a blessing and the king of Eirinn and his queen went home to Eirinn.</p>
 <p>At the end of a little more than a year <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">2</font></a> after that they had a young son, and they gave him Eobhan as a</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a></p>
 <p>name. Good care was taken of him, as should be of a king's son. At the end of a little more than a year after that they had another son, and they gave him Claidhean as a name. Care was taken of this one as had been taken of his brother; and at more than a year after that they had another son, and they gave him Conall as a name, and care was taken of him as had been taken of the two others. <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p>
 <p>They were coming on well, and at the fitting time a teacher was got for them. When they had got about as much learning as the teacher could give them, they were one day out at play, and the king and the queen were going past them, and they were looking at their children (clann).</p>
 <p>Said the queen, "This is well, and well enough, but more than this must be done for the children yet. I think that we ought to send them to Gruagach Bhein Eidinn to learn feats and heroes' activity (luth ghaisge), and that there is not in the sixteen realms another that is as good as the Gruagach of Beinn Eidinn. <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p>
 <p>The king agreed with her, and word was sent for the Gruagach. He came, and Eobhan and Claidhean were sent with him to Bein Eidinn to learn feats and activity, and what thing so ever besides the Gruagach could teach them.</p>
 <p>They thought that Conall was too young to send him there at that time. When Eobhan and Claidhean were about a year by the Gruagach, he came with them to their father's house; they were sent back again, and the Gruagach was giving every learning to the king's children. He took them with him one day aloft up Beinn Eidinn, and when they were on high about half the mountain, the king's children saw a round brown stone, and as if it were set aside from other stones. They asked what was the reason of that stone being set aside so, rather than all the other stones on the mountain. The Gruagach said to them that the name of that stone was "Clach nan gaisgeach," the stone of the heroes. Any one that could lift that stone till he could place the wind between it and earth, that he was a hero.</p>
 <p>Eobhan went to try to lift the stone; he put his arms about it, and he lifted it up to his knees; Claidhean seized the stone, and he put the wind between it and earth.</p>
 <p>Said the Gruagach to them, "Ye are but young and tender yet, be not spoiling yourselves with things that are too weighty for you. Stop till the end of a year after this and you will be stronger for it than you are now."</p>
 <p>The Gruagach took them home and taught them feats and activity, and at the end of a year he took them</p>
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>
 <p>again up the mountain. Eobhan and Claidhean went to the stone; Eobhan lifted it to his shoulder top, and set it down; Claidhean lifted the stone up to his lap, and the Gruagach said to them, "There is neither want of strength or learning with you; I will give you over to your father."</p>
 <p>At the end of a few days after that, the Gruagach went home to the king's house, and he gave them to their father; and he said that the king's sons were the strongest and the best taught that there were in the sixteen realms. The king gave thanks and reward to the Gruagach, and he sent Conall with him.</p>
 <p>The Gruagach began to teach Conall to do tricks and feats, and Conall pleased him well; and on a day he took Conall with him up the face of Beinn Eidinn, and they reached the place where the round brown stone was. Conall noticed it, and he asked as his brothers had done; and the Gruagach said as he said before. Conall put his hands about the stone, and he put the wind between it and earth; and they went home, and he was with the Gruagach getting more knowledge.</p>
 <p>The next year after that they went up Beinn Eidinn where the round brown stone was. Conall thought that he would try if he was (na bu mhurraiche) stronger to lift the heroes' stone. He caught the stone, and he raised it on the top of the shoulder, and on the faggot gathering place of his back, and he carried it aloft to the top of Beinn Eidinn, and down to the bottom of Beinn Eidinn, and back again; and he left it where he found it.</p>
 <p>And the Gruagach said to him, "Ach! thou hast enough of strength, if thou hast enough of swiftness."</p>
 <p>The Gruagach shewed Conall. a black thorn bush that was a short way from them, and he said, "If thou canst</p>
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>
 <p>give me a blow with that black thorn bush yonder, before I reach the top of the mountain, I may cease giving thee instructions," and the Gruagach ran up the hill.</p>
 <p>Conall sprang to the bush; he thought it would take too much time to cut it with his sword, and he pulled it out of the root, and he ran after the Gruagach with it and before he was but a short way up the mountain, Conall was at his back striking him about the backs of his knees with the black thorn bush.</p>
 <p>The Gruagach said, "I will stop giving thee instructions, and I will go home and I will give thee up to thy father."</p>
 <p>The Gruagach wished to go home with Conall, but Conall was not willing till he should get every knowledge that the Gruagach could give him; and he was with him after that more than a year, and after that they went home.</p>
 <p>The king asked the Gruagach how Conall had taken up his learning. "It is so," said the Gruagach, "that Conall is the man that is the strongest and best taught in the sixteen realms, and if he gets days, he will increase that heroism yet."</p>
 <p>The king gave full reward and thanks to the Gruagach for the care he had taken of his son. The Gruagach gave thanks to the king for the reward he had given him. They gave each other a blessing, and the Gruagach and the king's sons gave each other a blessing, and the Gruagach went home, and he was fully pleased. <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">1</font></a>]</p><table align="LEFT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

 <p>The young King of Eirinn and the king of Laidheann were comrades, and fond of each other; and they used to go to the green mound to the side of Beinn Euadain to seek pastime and pleasure of mind.</p>
 <p>The King of Eirinn had three sons, and the King of Laidheann one daughter; and the youngest son that the King of Eirinn had was Conall. On a day, as they were on the green mound at the side of Beinn Eudain, they saw the seeming of a shower gathering in the heart of the north-western airt, and a rider of a black filly coming from about the shower; and he took (his way) to the green mound where were the King of Eirinn and the King of Laidheann, and he blessed the men, and he inquired of them. The King of Eirinn asked what he came about; and he said that he was going to make a request to the King of Eirinn, if it were so that he might get it. The King of Eirinn said that he should get it if it should be in his power to give it to him.</p>
 <p>"Give me a loan of a day and a year of Conall thy son."</p>
 <p>"I myself promised that to thee," said the King of Eirinn; "and unless I had promised thou shouldst not got him."</p>
 <p>He took Conall with him. Now the King of Eirinn went home; he laid down music, and raised up woe, lamenting his son; he laid vows on himself that he would not stand on the green mound till a day and a</p>
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>
 <p>year should run out. There then he was at home, heavy and sad, till a day and a year had run.</p>
 <p>At the end of a day and year he went to the green mound at the side of Beinn Eudain. There he was a while at the green mound, and he was not seeing a man coming, and he was not seeing a horseman coming, and he was under sorrow and under grief. In the same airt of the heaven, in the mouth of the evening he saw the same shower coming, and a man upon a black filly in it, and a man behind him. He went to the green mound where the man was coming, and he saw the King of Laidheann.</p>
 <p>"How dost thou find thyself, King of Eirinn?"</p>
 <p>"I myself am but middling."</p>
 <p>"What is it that lays trouble on thee, King of Eirinn?"</p>
 <p>"There is enough that puts trouble upon me. There came a man a year from yesterday that took from me my son; he promised to be with me this day, and I cannot see his likeness coming, himself or my son."</p>
 <p>"Wouldst thou know thy son if thou shouldst see him?"</p>
 <p>"I think I should know him for all the time he has been away."</p>
 <p>"There is thy son for thee then," said the lad who came.</p>
 <p>"Oh, it is not; he is unlike my son; so great a change as might come over my son, such a change as that could not come over him since he went away."</p>
 <p>"He is all thou hast for thy son."</p>
 <p>"Oh, you are my father, surely," said Conall.</p>
 <p>"Thanks be to thee, king of the chiefs and the mighty! that Conall has come," said the King of Eirinn; "I am pleased that my son has come. Any</p>
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>
 <p>one thing that thou settest before me for bringing my son home, thou shalt get it, and my blessing."</p>
 <p>"I will not take anything but thy blessing; and if I got thy blessing I am paid enough."</p>
 <p>He got the blessing of the King of Eirinn, and they parted; and the King of Eirinn and his children went home.]</p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

 <p>After the sons of the King of Eirinn had gotten their learning, they themselves, and the king and the queen, were in the fortress; and they were full of rejoicing with music and joy, when there came a messenger to them from the King of Iubhar, telling that the Turcaich were at war with him to take the land from him; and that the realm of Iubhar was sore beset by the Turks; that they were (LIONAR NEARTHMHOR 'S BORB) numerous, powerful, and proud (RA GHARG), right fierce, merciless without kindliness, and that there were things incomprehensible about them; though they were slain to-day they would be alive to-morrow, and they would come forward to hold battle on the next day, as fierce and furious as they ever were; and the messenger was entreating the King of Eirinn to go to help the King of Iubhar, according to his words and his covenants. <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">1</font></a> The King of Eirinn must go to help the King of the Iubhar, because of the heavy vows: if strife, danger, straits, or any hardship should come against the one king, that the other king was to go to help him.  <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">2</font></a>] </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

 <p>They put on them forgoing; and when they had put on them for going away, they sent away a ship with provisions <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a> and with arms. There went away right good ships loaded with each thing they might require; noble ships indeed. The King of Eirinn and the King of Laidheann gave out an order that every man in the kingdom should gather to go.</p>
 <p>The King of Eirinn asked, "Is there any man about to stay to keep the wives and sons of Eirinn, till the King of Eirinn come back? Oh, thou, my eldest son, stay thou to keep the kingdom of Eirinn for thy father, and thine is the third part of it for his life, and at his death."</p>
 <p>"Thou seemest light minded to me, my father," said the eldest son, "when thou speakest such idle talk; I would rather hold one day of battle and combat against the great Turk, than that I should have the kingdom of Eirinn altogether."</p>
 <p>"There is no help for it," said the king. "But thou, middlemost son, stay thou to keep the kingdom of Eirinn for thy father, and thine is the half for his life, and at his death."</p>
 <p>"Do not speak, my father, of such a silly thing! What strong love should you have yourself for going, that I might not have?"</p>
 <p>"There is no help for it," said the King of Eirinn.</p>
 <p>"Oh, Conall," said the king, "thou that hast ever earned my blessing, and that never deserved my curse, stay thou to keep the wives and sons of Eirinn for thy father until he himself returns home again, and thou</p>

 <p>The king thought that Conall was too young for the realm to be trusted to him; he gathered his high counsellors and he took their counsel about it. The counsellors said that Conall was surely too young, but that was (FAILLINN A BHA DAONAN A DOL AM FEOBHAS) a failing that was always bettering; though he was young, that he would always be growing older; and that as Eobhan and Claidhean would not stay, that it was best to trust the realm to Conall].</p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

 <p>They went away, and Conall went along with them to the shore; he and his father and his brothers gave a blessing to each other; and the King of Eirinn and his two sons, Eobhan and Claidhean, went on board of a ship, and they hoisted the speckled flapping sails up against the tall tough masts; and they sailed the ship fiulpande <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">3</font></a> fiullande. <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">4</font></a> Sailing about the sandy ocean, where the biggest beast eats the beast that is least, and the beast that is least is fleeing and hiding as best he</p>

 <p>And Conall was heavy and dull when his father and brothers left him, and he sat down on the shore and he slept; and the wakening he got was the one wave sweeping him out, and the other wave washing him in against the shore.</p>
 <p>Conall got up swiftly, and he said to himself, "Is this the first exploit I have done! It is no wonder my father should say I was too young to take care of the realm, since I cannot take care of myself."</p>

 <p>Anna Diucalas, daughter of the King of Laidheann, was the name of that woman, the very drop of woman's blood that was the most beautiful of all that ever stood on leather of cow or horse. Her father left her in his castle, with five hundred soldiers to keep her; and she had no man with her in Laidheann but the soldiers, and Conall was by himself in the realm of Eirinn.</p>
 <p>Then sorrow struck Conall, and melancholy that he should stay in the realm of Eirinn by himself; that he himself was better than the people altogether, though they had gone away. He thought that there was nothing that would take his care and his sorrow from off him</p>

He went, and he reached the green mound; be laid his face downwards on the hillock, and he thought that there was no one thing that would suit himself better, than that be should find his match of a woman. Then he gave a glance from him, and what should he see but a raven sitting on a heap of snow; <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">1</font></a> and he set it before him that he would not take a wife forever, but one whose head should be as black as the raven, and her face as fair as the snow, and her cheeks as red as blood. Such a woman was not to be found, but the one that the King of Laidheann left within in his castle, and it would not be easy to get to her, for all the soldiers that her father left to keep her; but be thought that he could reach her.</p>

 <p>It were a sorry matter for me though I should put</p>

 <p>"Well, we will tell thee," said they, "what reason we had for that: we have never seen coming here (one), a gulp of whose blood, or a morsel of whose flesh could reach us, but thou thyself, except one other man, and he fled from us; and now everyone is doubting the other, in case thou shouldst flee."</p>
 <p>"That was the thing that made me do it myself likewise, since I have got yourselves so close as you are." Then he went and he began upon them. "I feared to be chasing you from hole to hole, and from hill to hill, and I did that." Then he gazed at them, from one to two, and he seized on the one of the slenderest shanks and the fattest head; he drove upon the rest, sliochd! slachd! till he had killed every one of them; and he had not a jot of the one with whom he was working at them, but what was in his hands of the shanks. <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>He killed every man of them, and though he was such a youth as he was, he was exhausted (enough-ified, if I might coin a word.) Then he began redding up the dwelling (reitach na h-araich) that was there, to clean it for himself that night. Then he put them out</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a></p>

 <p>There came a dream (Bruaduil) <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">2</font></a> to him then, and he said to him, "Rise, oh Conall, and the chase about to be upon thee."</p>
 <p>He let that pass, and he gave it no heed, for he was exhausted.</p>
 <p>He came the second journey, and he said to him, "Conall, wilt thou not arise, and that the chase is about to be upon thee."</p>
 <p>He let that pass, and he gave it no heed; but the third time he came to him, he said, "Conall art thou about to give heed to me at all! and that thy life is about to be awanting to thee."</p>
 <p>He arose and he looked out at the door, and he saw a hundred carts, and a hundred horses, and a hundred carters, coming with food to the amhusg; supposing that they had done for the youth that went amongst them the night before; and a piper playing music behind them, with joy and pleasure of mind.</p>
 <p>They were coming past a single bridge, and the bridge was pretty large; and when Conall saw that they were together (cruin round) on the bridge, he reached the bridge, and he put each cart, and each horse, and each carter, over the bridge into the river; and he drowned the men.</p>

 <p>(So he went back and he slept again.)</p>
 <p>Word reached the young king of Lochlann, that the big man who came off the ocean had gone to the house of the "Tamhasg;" that they had set a combat, and that the "Tamhasgan" had been slain. The young king of Lochlann ordered four of the best warriors that were in his realm, that they should up to the house of the Tamhasg, and take off the head of the big man that that had come off the ocean, and to bring it up to him before he should sit down to his dinner.</p>
 <p>The warriors went, and they found Duanach there, and they railed at him for going with the big man that came out of the outer land, <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">2</font></a> for they did not know who he was.</p>
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a></p>
 <p>"And why," said Duanach, "should I not go with the man of my own country? but it you knew it, I am as tired of him as you are yourselves. He has given me much to do; see you I have just made a heap of corpses, a heap of clothes, and a heap of the arms of the "Tamhaisg;" and you have for it but to lift them along with you."</p>
 <p>"It is not for that we came," said they, "but to slay him, and to take his head to the young king of Lochlann before he sits to dine. Who is he?" said they.</p>
 <p>"He is," said Duanach, "one of the sons of the king of Eirinn."</p>
 <p>"The young King of Lochlann has sent us to take his head off," said they.</p>
 <p>"If you kill one of the children of the King of Eirinn in his sleep you will regret it enough afterwards," said Duanach.</p>
 <p>"What regret will there be?" said they.</p>
 <p>"There is this," said Duanach. "There will be no son to woman, there will be no calf to cow, no grass nor braird shall grow in the realm of Lochlann, till the end of seven years, <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">1</font></a> if ye kill one of the clan of the King of Eirinn in his sleep, and go and tell that to the young King of Lochlann."</p>
 <p>They went back, and they told what Duanach had said.</p>
 <p>The young King of Lochlann said that they should go back, and do as he had bidden them, and that they should not heed the lies of Duanach. The four warriors went again to the house of the Tamhasg," and they said to Duanach,--</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>
 <p>"We have come again to take the head off the son <a href="errata.htm#8">of</a> the King of Eirinn."</p>
 <p>And Duanach said, "He is yonder then, over there, for you, in his sleep; but take good heed to yourselves, unless your swords are sharp enough to take off his head at the first blow, all that is in your bodies is to be pitied after that; he will not leave one of you alive, and he will bring (sgrios) ruin on the realm."</p>
 <p>Each of them stretched his sword to Duanach, and Duanach said that their swords were not sharp enough, that they should go out to the Tamhasg stone to sharpen them. They went out, and they were sharpening their swords on the smooth grinding-stone of the Tamhasg, and Conall began to dream (again).</p>
 <p>It seemed to him that he was going on a road that went through the midst of a gloomy wood, <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a> and it seemed to him that he saw four lions before him, two, on the upper side of the rood, and two on the lower side, and they were gnashing their teeth, and switching their tails, <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">2</font></a> making ready to spring upon him, and it seemed to him that it was easier for the lions that were on the upper side of the road to leap down, than it was for the lions that were on the lower side to leap up; and it was better for him to slay those that were on the tipper side first, and he gave a cheery spring to be at them; and he sprang aloft through his sleep, and he struck his head against a tie beam (sail shuimear) that was across above him in the house of the "Tamhasgan," and he drove as much as the breadth of a half-crown piece of the skin off the top of his head, and then he was aroused, and he said to Duanach,--</p>

 <p>"I myself was dreaming, Duanach," and he told him his dream.</p>
 <p>And Duanach said, "Thy dream is a dainty to read. Go thou out to the stone of the Tamhasg, and thou wilt see the four best warriors that the King of Lochlann has, two on each side of the stone round about it, sharpening, their swords to take off thy head."</p>
 <p>Conall went out with his blade in his hand, and he took off their heads, and he left two heads on each side of the stone of the Tamhasg and he came in where Duanach was, and he said, I am yet without food since I came to the realm of Lochlann, and I feel in myself that I am growing weak."</p>
 <p>And Duanach said, "I wilt get thee food if thou wilt take my counsel, and that is, that thou shouldst go to court the sister of the King of Lochlann, and I myself will go to redd the way for thee. <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">1</font></a>] </p><table align="LEFT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

 <p>"Well, then, if thou art, it is but little care thou hast for me.

 <p>"Faire! faire! watch, oh queen," said Duanach; "if thou hadst quicker asked it, thou hadst not got it slower."</p>
 <p>Away went Duanach down, and it was not on the side of the Avas Ormanach he began, but on the side of Conall. "Thou hast not told it to me for certain, yet if it be thou, when thou art not hastening thine hand, and making heavy thy blow! And to let slip that wretch that ought to be in a land of holes, or in crannies of rock, or in otter's cairns! Though thou shouldst fall here for slowness or slackness, there would neither be wife nor sweetheart crying for thee, and that is not the like of what would befall him."</p>

 <p>"Still be thy hand, O Conall," said Duanach Acha Draodh, "make him the binding of the three smalls there, until he gives thee his oaths under the edge of his set of arms, that there is no stroke he will strike for ever against thee." <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>He did not know that it was not bad stuff that was in the vessel. He put a little twig into the vessel, so that he might know what thing was in it. The twig came up full of sap (snodhach) as it went down. Then he thought that it was good stuff, and not bad stuff. He went and he washed himself in it, and he was as whole and healthy as he ever was. Then meat and drink went to them, that they might have pleasure of mind while passing the evening, and after that they went to rest; but he drew his cold sword between himself and the woman. He passed the night so, and in the morning he rose and went out of the castle. He clashed his shield without, and he shouted battle or else combat to be sent to him, or else Breast of Light, daughter of the King of Laidheann. It was battle and combat he should get, and not Breast of Light, for she was not there to give him.</p>

 <p>Conall loosed the young King of Lochlann and his men from their bonds and from their fetters, and he sat himself and the young King of Lochlann at the board, and they took their feast; and the big man was cast in under the board. Again when they were at supper the king's sister was with them, and every word she said she was trying to make the friendship greater and greater between her brother and Conall. The big man was lying under the board, and Conall said to him, "Thou man that art beneath, wert thou ever before in strait or extremity as great as to be lying under the great board, under the drippings of the waxen torches of the King of Lochlann and mine?"</p>
 <p>Said be, "If I were above, a comrade of meat and cup to thee, I would tell thee a tale on that."</p>
 <p>At the end of a while after that, when the drink was taking Conall a little, he was willing to hear the tale of the man who was beneath the board, and he said to him, "Thou that art beneath the board, if I</p>

 <p>And he answered as before.</p>
 <p>Said Conall, "If thou wilt promise to be peaceable when thou gettest up, I will let thee come up; and if thou art not peaceable, the two hands that put thee down before, will put thee down again."</p>
 <p>Conall loosed the man who was beneath, and he rose up aloft and he sat at the other side of the board, opposite to Conall; and Conall said,</p>
 <p>"Aha! thou art on high now, thou man that wert beneath. If I had thy name it is that I would call thee. What strait or extremity wert thou ever in that was harder than to be laid under the board of the young king of Lochlann, and mine?"</p>

 <p><a name="fn_37"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_37">203:1</a> This seems to shew that Celtic kings did not act without the consent of their chiefs; and this appears in other places, in this, and in many other stories. Iubhar is a name for Newry, but the story is not consistent with the supposition that Newry is meant. I suspect Jewry is the word, and that the Holy Land is meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_38"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_38">203:2</a> The island reciter always say, "at the end of three quarters," etc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_39"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_39">204:1</a> The parentage and education of Conall are differently given in a very good, though short version, written by Mr. Fraser of Mauld. It is called the tale of Conall Guilbeanach, son of the King of Eirinn, and Gealmhaiseach mhin (fair, beauteous, smooth) daughter of the King of Lochlann.</p>
 <p>A king of Eirinn was fond of the chase, and on a fine spring day he chased the deer till he lost his dogs and his people. In the gray of the evening he sat on the side of a green knoll, behind the wind and before the sun, and he heard a voice beside him say, "Hail to thee, King of Eirinn." "Hail to thyself, thou old gray man," said the king.</p>
 <p>The old man took him into the mountain, and there he saw what he had never seen before: such food and drink, meat and music and dancing; and the old man had a beautiful daughter. He slept that night, and when he arose in the morning he heard the cry of a child; and he had to stay for the christening of his son, and he was named Conal Guilbeanach.</p>
 <p>The king sent him venison from time to time, and be grew up to be a stalwart youth, swift and strong.</p>
 <p>Then war sprung up between the King of Eirinn and the King of Lochlann; and the king sent Caoilte (one of the Feine), the swiftest man in the realm, for Conall, and he could not keep up with Conall on the way home.</p>
 <p>The old gray man gave him a sword, and he said "Here is for thee, Conall, 'a Gheur Ghlas' (the keen gray), that I got myself from Oisean MacOscar na Feinne," etc.</p>
 <p>An old man in Benbecula, Donald MacIntyre, told me this story in 1859. It lasted about an hour, and I did not take notes, but his version was the same as Mr. Fraser's, so far. A king of Eirinn gets lost in a magic mist, is entertained by a gray old <a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a> man, stays in his house for a night, sees the man's daughter, "and wheresoever the girl slept, it was there the king rose in the morning." He had been there a year and a day. Conall was born, and when the king went home he said nothing about his adventures.</p>
 <p>The man who was sent for Conall, when war broke out with the Turks, and the king's two sons refused to stay, was so swift that he could cover seven ridges at a stride; but Conall beat him at all feats of agility, and when he came home with him he was seven ridges before him; and as he went he kept a golden apple playing aloft with the points of his two spears, etc.</p>
 <p>Old Donald MacPhie, in South Uist, also told me the story. Like all versions which I have heard, it was full of metrical prose passages, "runs," as they are called. His version agreed with MacIntyre's as to the parentage of Conall.</p>
 <p>The correct reading then seems to be, that Conall's two brothers were the sons of the queen, but that the hero was the son of the daughter of the Gruagach (? the Druid) of Beinn Eudain, an old gray man, who lived in the mountain, and who had been a comrade of Oisean and the Feine.</p>
 <p>Conall had the blood of the ancient heroes in his veins, and they helped their descendant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_40"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_40">205:1</a> Dewar says, "a master of arts and sciences, a title, old Gaelic;" but he says so only on the authority of his stories. I suspect the word to be the same as Druidhach, a Druid or magician; <a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a> and that this relates to some real school of arms and warlike exercises. What the sixteen realms may mean I don't know.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_41"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_41">208:1</a> So far I have followed MacNair's version, which is the only one with this part. I have shortened it by striking out repetitions; but I have followed Dewar's spelling of' the names. The<a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a> next bit may be but another version of the education of the warrior, but it seems as if something were wanted to complete it. It is the beginning of the story as told in Barra, and I give it as part of the same thing. It agrees with the mysterious origin of Conall.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_42">211:1</a> All versions agree that there was war between Eirinn and the Turks.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_43">211:2</a> This is the fullest version. MacNeill gives the same incidents in a very few words. The Colonsay man, MacGilvray, begins here. "The King of Eirinn thought that he would go to put the Turks out of the realm of the Emperor--Impire." Another version also says that the king had gone to put the Turks out of the realm of the Emperor.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_44"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_44">212:1</a> The word provēēshon has been adopted by reciters.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_45"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_45">213:1</a> The Colonsay version and MacNair's give the same incidents; and Conall says that if the others get as much as Eirinn, they will be well off. "Thou art wise, Conall," said the king; and Conall was crowned King of Eirinn before the started.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_46"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_46">213:2</a> The other versions do not say that the company of the King of Laidhean went, but it is implied.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_49"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_49">214:1</a> A man, DUINE, means a human being.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_50"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_50">214:2</a> GUARD, this is an English word which has crept into Gaelic stories, saighdair probably meant archer; it means soldier.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_51"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_51">215:1</a> This incident, with variations, is common. It is clear that the raven ought to have been eating something to suggest the blood; and so it is elsewhere.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Mr. Fraser of Mauld, Inverness, East Coast.</p>
 <p>He had gone to see his grandfather, the mysterious old gray man.</p>
 <p>"When he got up in the morning there was a young snow, and the raven was upon a spray near him, and a bit of flesh in his beak. The piece of flesh fell, and Conall went to lift it; and the raven said to him, that Fair Beauteous Smooth was as white as the snow upon the spray, her cheek as red as the flesh that was in his hand, and her hair as black as the feather that was in his wing."</p>
 <p align="CENTER">MacPhie, Uist.</p>
 <p>On a snowy day Conall. saw a goat slaughtered, and a black raven came to drink the blood. "Oh," says he, "that I could marry the girl whose breast is as white as the snow, whose cheeks are red as the blood, and whose hair is as black as the raven; and Conall fell sick for love.</p>
 <p>(Benbecula) Macintyre gave the same incident.</p>
 <p>The Colonsay version introduces an old nurse instead.</p>
 <p>MacNair simply says that Conall heard of the lady.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_52"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_52">216:1</a> It seems hopeless to try to explain this topography. Laidheann should be Leinster, and Iubhar might be Newry, and Beinn Eudainn or Eideinn is like the Gaelic for Edinburgh, though the stories place the hill in Ireland; and here are the king of Eirinn and his son rowing and sailing about from realm to realm in Ireland, and the Turks at Newry a foreign land. If Iubhar mean Jewry, and this is a romance of the crusades, it is more reasonable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_53">217:1</a> This name is variously spelt:--1, as above; 2, Anna Diucalas; and 3, An Uchd Solais. The first is like a common French name, Eucharis, the second Maclean thinks has something to do with the raven black hair. The third was used by the Colonsay man and means bosom of light. All three have a similar sound, and I take Breast of Light as the most poetical.] </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

 <p><a name="fn_54"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_54">219:1</a> Macgilvray also gives this incident, but omits the next. She kilted her gown and followed him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_55"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_55">220:1</a> What the artist meant who sculptured the stone from which this woodcut is taken is not clear, but the three lower figures <a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a> might mean Conall knocking out the big man's eye with a jaw bone, and the lady looking on. It might mean Samson slaying a Philistine. The upper part might represent the king hunting, but there is a nondescript figure which will not fit, unless it be the monster which was slain at the palace of the King of Light. The date and origin of stone and story are alike unknown, but they are both old and curious, and may serve as rude illustrations of past customs and dresses and of each other.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_56"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_56">221:1</a> This is common to many stories. Beaarradh eòin us amadain, means shaving and clipping and stripping one side of a man, like a bird with one wing pinioned.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_57"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_57">221:2</a> The spirit of this is like the Icelandic code of honour described in the Njal Saga. It was all fair to kill a man if it was done openly, or even unawares if the deed were not hidden, and here the lady was offended because the swain had not declared his name, and quite satisfied when he did.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_58"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_58">221:3</a> Na leumanan garbh 's na, gharbh threte mar nathair nimh na mar bheithir bhéumanach.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_59"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_59">222:1</a> The king's company had started for the wars; it is to be assumed the king followed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_60"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_60">223:1</a> MacNair also gives the next passage in different words, and with the variation that the joint of his little finger was to be cut off.</p>
 <p>Macgilvray, the same in different words. According to the introduction to Njal Saga, there were in Iceland long ago gifted men of prodigious strength, who, after performing feats of superhuman, force, were weak and powerless for a time. While engaged in London about this story, an Irish bricklayer came to mend a fire-place, and I asked him if he had ever heard of Conall Gulban, "Yes sure," said the man with a grin, "he was one of the Finevanians, and when he slept they had to cut bits off him, before he could be wakened. They were cutting his fingers off." And then he went away with his hod.</p>
 <p>The incident is common in Gaelic stories, and Conall is mentioned in a list of Irish stories in the transactions of the Ossianic society.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_61"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_61">224:1</a> And he laid his head in her lap, and she--dressed--his hair. (MacPhie, Uist.) This is always the case in popular tales of all countries, and the practice is common from Naples to Lapland. I have seen it often. The top of his little linger was to be cut off to rouse him, and if that failed, a bit from his crown, and he was to be knocked about the ribs, and a stone placed on his chest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_62"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_62">224:2</a> MacGilvray gives the incident in different words.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_63"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_63">224:3</a> Long means a large ship.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_64"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_64">226:1</a> A good illustration of the law of the strongest, which seems to have been the law of the Court of Appeal in old times in Iceland, and probably in Ireland and Scotland also.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_65"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_65">226:2</a> Here, as it seems to me, the mythological character of the legend appears. Sorcha is <i>light</i>, in opposition to Dorch, <i>dark</i>; and further on a lady is found to match the king of Sorcha, who is in a lofty turret which no man could scale, but which the great warrior pulled down. So far as I know there is no place which now goes by the name of Sorcha, unless it be the island of Sark. According to Donald MacPhie (Uist), this was Righ-an-Domhain, the King of the Universe, which again indicates mythology.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_66"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_66">227:1</a> Macgilvray awakens him by a troop of school-boys who were playing tricks to him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_67"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_67">228:1</a> He also gives the following passage, but less fully.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_68"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_68">228:2</a> It was a common practice, according to the Njal Saga, for the old Icelands to bind themselves by vows to perform certain <a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a> deeds, and, according to Irish writers, a like practice prevailed in Ireland. it seems that the custom is remembered and preserved in these stories. The fruit, TORADH, rather means a harvest; he will leave a harvest of dead reaped by his hand.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_69"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_69">229:1</a> Mr. Fraser, Invernesshire. "His grandfather took him to the side of the sea, and he struck a rod that was in his band on a rock, and there rose up a long ship under sail. The old man put "a gheur ghlas," the keen gray (sword) on board, and at parting he said, in every strait in which thou art for ever remember me."--MacPhie. He wished for his grandfather, who came and said, "Bad! bad! thou hast wished too soon," and raised a ship with his magic rod.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_70"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_70">229:2</a> The only variation here is the words.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_71"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_71">229:3</a> I have never seen the game of shinny played in Norway, but there is mention of a game at "ball" in Icelandic sagas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_72"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_72">230:1</a> Iomhair Oaidh MacRigh na Hiribhi, Iver, son of the King of Bergen, is the person who plays this part in the Inverness-shire version. He was a suitor, and he was thrashed, but he afterwards plays the part of the King of Sorcha, and is killed. MacPhie makes him a young man, and a suitor for the Princess of Norway.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_73"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_73">231:1</a> According to MacPhie (Uist), he wished for his grandfather, who appeared with an iron shinny, and said, "Bad, bad, thou hast wished too soon."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_74"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_74">232:1</a> This description of a game of shinny is characteristic, and the petulance of Prince Cheery Fire, with his two-and-thirty toadies, and the independence of the warrior who came over the sea, and who would stand no nonsense, are well described, MacNair's version is not so full, nor is the catastrophe so tragic, but otherwise the incidents are the same.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_75"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_75">232:2</a> From the Njal Saga it appears that the Northmen, in their raids, carried off the people of IRELAND, and made slaves of them. Macgilvray called this character Dubhan MacDraoth, blacky, or <a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a> perhaps crook, the son of magic, and he explained, that draoth was one who brought messages from one enemy to another, and whose person was sacred.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_76"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_76">233:1</a> Here my two chief authorities vary a little in the order of the incidents. MacNair sends him first to his house, the other takes him there later; they vary but little in the incidents. Macgilvray takes him at once to the palace, where he finds a great chain which he shakes to bring out the foe.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_77"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_77">235:1</a> AMHAS, a madman, a wild ungovernable man; also, a dull stupid person (Armstrong). AMHASAN, a sentry (ditto); also, a wild beast, according to the Highland Society Dictionary. Perhaps these may have something to do with the Basemarks of the old Norsemen, who were "public pests," great warriors, half crazy, enormously strong, subject to fits of ungovernable fury, occasionally employed by saner men, and put to death when done with. The characters appear in many Highland tales; and an Irish blind fiddler told me a long story in which they figured. I suspect this guardhouse of savage warriors has a foundation in fact. Macgilvray gives the incidents also.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_78"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_78">236:1</a> He made himself a bed of rushes at the side of the house.--Macgilvray.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_79"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_79">236:2</a> This word, thus written, is in no dictionary that I have, but it is the same as brudair; and, the other version proves that a dream is meant. It is singular to find a dream thus personified in the mouth of a Barra peasant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_80"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_80">237:1</a> MacNair has not got this adventure of the carts; and MacNeil has not the next adventure, unless it be the same considerably varied. I give both upon chance.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_81"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_81">237:2</a> "AN FHOIRS TIR;" this word is now commonly applied to the furthest ground known, such as the outermost reef or even fishing bank; it is also written oirihir, edge-land.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_82"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_82">238:1</a> Cha bhith mac aig bean; cha bhith laogh aig mart; 's cha chinn fear na fochan, ann an righachd Lochlann, gu ceann seachd bliadhna, etc.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_84"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_84">239:2</a> A casadh am fiacall 's a sguitse le n' earball.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_85"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_85">240:1</a> He has not got the next adventure, which I take from MacNeill.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_86"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_86">240:2</a> AMHUS, the savage, or wild man, ORMANACH is not so clear; written from ear it might be a word beginning with an aspirated silent letter, such as <i>th</i>, which would make the word "noisy," or it may be some compound of OR gold, such as OR-MHEINNEACH, gold-ore-ish, which would make him the wild man of the gold mines, or armour, or hair, or something else. Macgilvray called him an Amhas Orannoch, the wild man of songs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_87"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_87">241:1</a> Songstership of Magic field, which is MacNeill's name for the character.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_88"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_88">241:2</a> Brosnachadh file fiorghlic. It is said that the bards from the earliest of times sang songs of encouragement to the warriors. The old Icelanders, as it is asserted in their sagas, sung themselves in the heat of the fight, and here is a tradition of something of the kind. In Stewart's collection, 1804, is the battle song of the Macdonalds for the battle of Harlaw.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_89"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_89">241:3</a> Deagh run, droch run. <i>Rùn</i> has many meanings--love, etc.; purpose, etc.; a person beloved; a secret, a mystery; and, <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a> according to Armstrong, it is the origin of "runic." The man who told this story clearly meant "purpose" by run; but perhaps the original meaning of the passage which comes repeatedly in this story was that Songstership of Magic field sang "good runes for the victory of his countrymen." It must be remembered that Barra was in the way of Norsemen, and that their ways of life throw light on Gaelic traditions. According to Macgilvray--another islander--Dubhan MacDraoth was the Draoth (? herald) of the king of Eirinn when he went to put the Turk out of the realm of the emperor, and the king of Lochlann brought him home thence, and he was his draoth. As there was a guard of Norsemen in Constantinople this looks like a possible fact.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_90"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_90">242:1</a> "The d---l has sworn by the edge of his knife."--<i>Carle of Kellyburn Braes</i>, Old Song.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_91"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_91">242:2</a> Cha 'n e sin domh 's e.--It is not that to me it is.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_92"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_92">243:1</a> MacNair gives the following incidents more in detail, and more as matter of fact. The bard, to get food for the warrior, persuades the lady that he has come to court her, and with her consent, takes him food, and guides him to her chamber. He places a drawn sword between them, and never speaks. The bard sleeps on the stair outside; the king's men seek in vain for Conall; and in the morning the bard explains the mystery of the drawn sword to the lady, who is content. And so it happens thrice, when Conall feels able to fight the lady's brother, and the lady finds that the warrior is faithful to his first love, and the bard a cunning deceiver. This incident is very widely known in popular tales. <i>See</i> the "Arabian Nights," Grimm, etc. "Gu de am fath ma 'n do rinn se è mata?" orsa ise. "Tha," orsa Duanach, "tha e a los ma bhitheas leanabh gille eadar sibh gu am bi e na fhear claidheamh cho math ris fein." Thuirt ise, "Ach na an saoillinn sin dheanainn a bheatha ciod air bhith doigh air an tigeadh e."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_93"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_93">244:1</a> Thug e leum o chaol a choise go barr a bhoise, 's o barr a bhoise go mullach a chaisteil.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_94"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_94">244:2</a> According to MacNeill it was her father; and as the young king goes away afterwards and is married, I follow MacNair. MacNeill killed a brother at landing. MacNair left him alive to <a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a> be introduced further on, so I have altered one word in MacNeill's account of the fight, and assume that Prince Cheery fire was a younger brother of the young king.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_96"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_96">246:1</a> As this is a kind of chorus, and probably old, I give the original.

 <p><a name="fn_99"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_99">247:3</a> Fo chis, tribute or subjection. It seems almost a hopeless task to make romance reasonable, and yet I am convinced that these are semi-historical romances, When it is certain that Norse sea-rovers, were actually settled in the Hebrides, and wandered from America to Constantinople, and levied tribute wherever they could; when it appears from their sagas, which <a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a> are believed to be almost true history, that these raids were often made in single ships, and when simple Icelanders fought with Orkney earls and Norse kings, and Norman adventurers conquered England; it seems possible that one of the body guard from Constantinople might become "Emperor of the world" in the Hebrides, and a voyager from Greenland "king of the green isle that was about the heaps of the deep;" and that such exploits as these men performed might be magnified, and applied to a Celtic warrior by Celtic bards; or that a Celtic warrior may have done as much. It is admitted that Irish priests had found their way to Iceland before the Norsemen went there, and if so, perhaps Irish warriors may have been pirates or varangians, and successful in forays on the Vikings, as Vikings were in Irish forays. We believe the Sagas, so far as they are reasonable; why should not truth be sifted from these romances also.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_102"></a><a href="pt328.htm#fr_102">250:1</a> MacNair's version is almost the same in different words. This has some resemblance to the story of Conall, Nos. V. VI. VII.; but the adventures of this man are quite different. Macgilvray gives the same story.</p>
