 <h3 align="CENTER">HOW THE COCK TOOK A TURN OUT OF THE FOX,<br>
 AND NO CREATURE EVER TOOK A TURN OUT OF HIM BUT THAT COCK.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1">From Hector Boyd, Barra, Sept. 20, 1860.</font></p>
 <p>THE russet dog came to a house, and he caught hold of a cock. He went away with the cock, and the people of the town-land went away after him.</p>
 <p>"Are they not silly!" quoth the cock, "going after thee, and that they cannot catch thee at any rate."</p>
 <p>The cock was for that he should open his mouth that he might spring out.</p>
 <p>When he saw that the cock was so willing to go along with himself, he was so pleased.</p>
 <p>"Oh! musician, wilt thou not say--It is my own cock that is here, and they will turn back," said the cock.</p>

 <p>The fox said, "Shê-mo-haolach-hay-n-a-han;" and when the fox opened his mouth the cock sprung away.</p>
 <p>I have already given a version of this in Vol. II.; the main difference is, that the cock here calls the fox a musician, as the fox in the old story called the crow, when he did him out of a cheese by the same stratagem. Ceolaire is used to express a silly fellow.</p>
