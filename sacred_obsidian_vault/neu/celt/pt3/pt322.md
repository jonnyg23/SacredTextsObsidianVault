 <h3 align="CENTER">THE HOODIE AND THE FOX.</h3>
 <p>THE hoodie and the fox were good at early rising, and they laid a wager with each other, for which should soonest get up in the morning. The hoodie went into a tree top, and she slept; and the fox staid at the foot of the tree, looking aloft (to see) when the day would come. As soon as he perceived the day he cried,</p>
 <p>"Sê-n-lAbAn-ê." It is bright day.</p>
 <p>The hoodie had never stirred all the night, and then she awoke with the cry, and she answered, "SAd-o-bê-ê, SAd-o-bê-ê." It's long since it was. Then the fox lost the wager and the hoodie won.</p>
