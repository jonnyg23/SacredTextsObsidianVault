 Part of the 'Myths and Legends' series published by Gresham in the early
 20th century, 'Celtic Myth and Legend' is actually a reissue of a 1905
 work, 'The Mythology of the British Islands'.
 It differs from the rest of the Gresham series because it is a bit more
 scholarly (it actually has an adequate set of footnotes)
 and a bit more didactic.
 There is <a href="cml31.htm">an extensive index</a>
 with over 8,000 references (all hyperlinked here).
 Another great feature is a <a href="cml32.htm">glossary</a> of
 dozens of Irish and Welsh words and phrases
 with phonetic transcriptions--finally
 everyone can learn how to properly pronounce terms such as 
 'Táin Bo Chuailgné' and 'Pwyll'!
 This is a good thing.
 More importantly,
 Squire is summarizing a (fairly mainstream)
 school of thought about the mythology
 of Britain, in which many names and incidents in the
 tangled legends of the dark ages can be traced to ancient Pagan myths.
 The Celtic fairy faith is explained as a survival of the
 worship of ancient tutelary gods and goddesses.
 When one considers that the other two
 leading theories are that the fairies are supernatural
 transdimensional entities or reclusive troglodyte pygmies, this seems
 to be fairly rational.
 </p>
 <p>
 Through the ancient chronologies of Irish invasions and the heroic
 age of the Fenians, through the Welsh tales from the Mabinogion,
 and into the age of Arthur, we see similar names, themes and story
 elements crop up again and again.
 For instance, the ancient sky-God Lludd, is confused with a sea-god,
 Llyr, who eventually morphs into King Lear.
 Llud's daughter Creudylad, becomes Cordelia.
 The magic cauldron of ancient Celtic mythology becomes the Holy Grail.
 And so on.</p>
 <p>
 There are many parallels to classical mythology, and
 Squire uses these as reference points, e.g. by calling
 the War of the Bull of Cualgne, 'The Irish Iliad,' Cuchulainn,
 'The Irish Achilles,' and
 Branwen, 'The British Aphrodite.'
 Some of these analogies do break down on close examination,
 but they can aid the reader's
 absorption of this lesser-known branch of mythology.
 </p>
 <p>
 While Squire is trying to make a point, and there is
 more apparatus than the typical Gresham <i>Myths and Legends</i> book, he
 also tells these timeless stories in a very entertaining fashion.
