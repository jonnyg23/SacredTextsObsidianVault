 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/minit.jpg" alt="m"></td></tr></table>ANY of the members of the human body were embodied in rhymes, commonly nursery rhymes. Here is one about the face; and as the nurse repeated each line she touched with her finger the part of the face mentioned in the line:--  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Chin cherry,<br> Moo merry,<br> Nose nappie,<br> Ee winkie,<br> Broo brinkie,<br> Cock-up jinkie."</font></dir>  
 <p>There is a variation of the last line:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Our the hill ail awa."</font></dir>  
 <p>The following refers to the brow, the eye, the nose, and the mouth:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Knock at the doorie,<br> Peep in,<br> Lift the latch<br> An walk in."</font></dir>  
 <p>Here is one about the fingers, beginning with the index finger:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Here's the man it brook the barn,<br> Here's the man it staa the corn,<br> Here's the man it taul a,<br> Peer creenie-crannie paid for a."</font></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>The nurse took hold of each finger as she repeated each line. There was another form of the rhyme, in which the thumb played the part of breaking the barn:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"This is the man it brook the barn,<br> This is the man it staa the corn,<br> This is the man it taul a,<br> This the man it ran awa,<br> Peer creenie-crannie paid for a."</font></dir>  
 <p>Another form of the last line is:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"An puir wee crannie doodlie paid for a."</font></dir>  
 <p>The legs and feet were utilised by the nurse as a means of amusement. Here is what she repeated while she held a leg in each hand and kept crossing them, slowly at first, and then with greater rapidity when the dogs were supposed to be on their homeward journey:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"There wiz twa doggies,<br> A ii they geed t the mill,<br> All they got a lick cot o this wife's pyock,<br> An anither oot o the neesht wife's pyock,<br> All a leb oot o the dam,<br> An syne they geed hame,<br> Loupie for loup, loupie for loup."</font></dir>  
 <p>Another version runs thus:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Twa doggies geed t the mill,<br> They took a lick oot o this wife's pyock,<br> An a lick oot o that wife's pyock,<br> An a leb oot o the mill dam;<br> Hame again, hame again--loupie for loup--<br> Hame again, hame again--loupie for spang."</font></dir>  
 <p>The following rhyme was repeated to the child by the nurse while she took off the child's boot and imitated the blacksmith in nailing the shoes on the horse's foot:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"John Smith, a fellow fine,<br> Cam t shee a horse o mine.<br> Pit a bit upo the tae,<br> T gar the horsie clim the brae;<br> Pit a bit upo the brod,<br> T gar the horsie clim the road;<br> Pit a bit upo the heel,<br> T gar the horsie trot weel."</font></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>Here is another version:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"John Smith, a fellow fine,<br> Cam t shoo a horse o mine--<br> Shoo a horse, ca a nail,<br> Ca a tackit ins tail--<br> Hand him sicker, hand him sair,<br> Haud him by the head o hair."</font></dir>  
 <p>Another rhyme about the legs and feet is as follows:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Hey my kittin, my kittin--<br> Hey my kittin, my dearie;<br> Sic a fit as this<br> Wiz na far nor nearie.<br> Here we gae up, up, up;<br> Here we gae doon, doon, doonie;<br> Here we gae back an fore;<br> Here we gae roon an roonie;<br> Here's a leg for a stockin,<br> An here's a fit for a shoeie."</font></dir>  
 <p>Various members of the body were celebrated in the following way:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"This is the broo o knowledge,<br> This is the ee o life.<br> This is the bibblie gauger,<br> An this is the pen-knife,<br> This is the shouther o mutton,<br> This is the lump o fat."</font></dir>  
 <p>The next two lines must be left untold.</p>  
 <p>When the child was being fed, to keep it in good humour and induce it to take its food, the nurse kept repeating:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Sannie Kilrannie, the laird o Kailcrack,<br> Suppit kale brose, and swallit the cap."</font></dir>  
 <p>A fuller version of the same was:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Sandy Killrannie,<br> The laird o Kilknap,<br> He suppit kail brose<br> Till his wyme it did crack.<br> He suppit the brose<br> An swallit the speen.<br> "Ho, ho," quo Sandy,<br> The brose is deen."</font></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>When the child showed signs of being satisfied, the following words wore repeated:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Gouckit Geordie, Brig o Dee,<br> Sups the brose an leaves the bree."</font></dir>  
 <p>When the child was being undressed for bed, the nurse kept repeating:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Hey diddle dumplin, my son John<br> Went to his bed an his trousers on;<br> One shoe oft, an the other shoe on,<br> Hey diddle dumplin, my son John."</font></dir>  
 <p>When the child got into the sulks it was called:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Grinigo Gash, the laird's piper."</font></dir>  
 <p>Children in their amusements often repeated rhymes.</p>  
 <p>The following one was repeated when a child mounted a walking-stick or a piece of stick as a "horse":--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Hurple Dick upon a stick,<br> An Sandy on a soo,<br> We'll awa t Aiberdeen<br> T buy a pun o oo."</font></dir>  
 <p>Another version is:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"Cripple Dick upon a stick,<br> An Sandy on a soo,<br> Ride awa t Galloway<br> T buy a pun o oo."</font></dir>  
 <p>This rhyme was repeated to the child when dandled on the knee in imitation of the modes of riding indicated in the lines:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"This is the way the ladies rides,<br> Jimp an sma, jimp an sma;<br> This is the way the gentlemen rides,<br> Spurs an a, spurs an a;<br> This is the way the cadgers rides,<br> Creels an a, creels an a."</font></dir>  
 <p>Another rhyme of the same kind is:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Ride, dide, dide,<br> Ride t Aberdeen,<br> An buy fite bread,<br> She fan ere he cam back<br> The carlin wiz dead, <a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a><br> Up wi her club,<br> Gie her on the lug,<br> An said, 'Rise up, carlin,<br> An eat fite bread."'</font></dir>  
 <p>Two children placed themselves back to back, locked their arms together, and alternately lifted each other, repeating the words:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Weigh butter, weigh cheese,<br> Weigh a, pun a caunle grease."</font></dir>  
 <p>Here follow various rhymes current among the young:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"A, B, buff,<br> The cattie lickit snuff,<br> An the monkey chawed tobacco."  
 <p>"A, B, buff,<br> Gee the cat a cuff,<br> Gee her ane, gee her twa,<br> Rap her hehd t the stehn wa."</p>  
 <p>"Charlie Chats milkit the cats,<br> An Gollochy made the cheese,<br> An Charlie steed at the back o the door,<br> An heeld awa the flees."</p>

 <p>"John Prott an his man<br> To the market they ran;<br> They bought, they sold,<br> Muckle money down told,<br> Till they came till a plack,<br> Steek your neive on that."</p>  
 <p>"'Hielanman, Hielanman,<br> Fahr wiz ye born?'<br> 'Up in the Hielands,<br> Amon the green corn.'<br> 'Faht got you there<br> Bit green kail an leeks?'<br> Laugh at a Hielanman<br> Wintin his breeks." <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>"The little lady lairdie<br> She longt for a baby,<br> She took her father's grey hunn<br> An rowd it in a plaidy.<br> Says 'Hishie, bishie, bow, wow,<br> Lang legit now ow<br> Int warna for yir muckle baird<br> I wad kiss yir mou-ow'."</p>

 <p>"Four-an-twenty tailors<br> Chasin at a snail,<br> The snail shot oot its horns<br> Like a hummil coo.<br> 'Ah,' cried the foremost tailor,<br> 'We're a stickit noo.'" <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Wallace wicht<br> Upon a nicht<br> Took in a stack o bere,<br> An or the moon at fair daylicht<br> Hid draff ot till's more."</p>  
 <p>"That's the lady's forks an knives,<br> An that's the lady's table,<br> An that's the lady's looking-glass,<br> An that's the baby's cradle."</p></font></dir>  
 <p>This rhyme was repeated on placing the fingers in such positions as to imitate knives, tables, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>The following is a rhyme on the numbers up to twenty:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">"One, two,<br> Buckle my shoe;<br> Three, four,<br> Open the door;<br> Five, six,<br> Pick up sticks;<br> Seven, eight,<br> Lay them straight;<br> Nine, ten,<br> A good fat hen;<br> Eleven, twel,<br> Gar her swell;<br> Thirteen, fourteen,<br> Draw the curtain;<br> Fifteen, sixteen,<br> Maid in the kitchen;<br> Seventeen, eighteen,<br> I am waitin;<br> Nineteen, twenty,<br> My stomach's empty;<br> Please, mother, give me my dinner."  
 <p>"Steal a needle, steal a preen,<br> Steal a coo or a be deen."</p></font></dir>  
 <p>This sensible rhyme was often repeated to children when they were guilty of pilfering, or began to show any inclination to do so.</p>  
 <p>The following is called the "Souter's Grace":--</p>  
 <p><font size="-1">"What are we before thee, O King Crispin? Naething bit a parcel o easy ozy sooter bodies, nae worth one old shoe to mend another. Yet thou hast given us leather to yark, and leather to bark, oot-seam awls, and in-seam awls, pincers and petrie-balls, lumps o creesch and balls o rosit, and batter in a cappie. Amen."</font></p>
