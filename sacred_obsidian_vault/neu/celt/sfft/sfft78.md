 <p>As I was a-walking one morning in the spring,<br> I heard a young ploughman so sweetly to sing,<br> And as he was singing these words he did say,<br> No life is like the ploughman's in the month of May.</p>  
 <p>The lark in the morning rises from her nest,<br> And mounts in the air with the dew on her breast,<br> And with the jolly ploughman she'll whistle and she'll sing,<br> And at night she'll return to her nest back again.</p>  
 <p>If you walk in the fields any pleasure to find,<br> You may see what the ploughman enjoys in his mind;<br> There the corn he sows grows and the flowers do spring,<br> And the ploughman's as happy as a prince or a king.</p>  
 <p>When his day's work is done that he has to do,<br> Perhaps to some country walk he will go; <a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="green">p. 303</font></a><br> There with a sweet lass he will dance and sing,<br> And at night return with his lass back again.</p>  
 <p>Then he rises next morning to follow his team,<br> Like a jolly ploughman so neat and so trim;<br> If he kiss a pretty girl he will make her his wife,<br> And she loves her jolly ploughman as dear as her life.</p>  
 <p>There's Molly and Dolly, Nelly and Sue;<br> There's Ralph, John, and Willie, and young Tommy too ;<br> Each lad takes his lass to the wake or the fair,<br> Adzooks! they look rarely I vow and declare.</p>
