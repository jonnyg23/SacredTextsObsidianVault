 <p align="CENTER">A MOONLIGHT SCENE</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>CONCEIVED AND COMMENCED WHEN PASSING OVEN PUTNEY BRIDGE ON A FINE MOONLIGHT NIGHT IN SUMMER.</blockquote>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>THE moonbeams on the lake are glancing, <br>
 The nimble bark is now advancing,<br>
 That for this grove is bound.<br>
 Ye gentle clouds, ah! hear a lover,<br>
 And hasten not the moon to cover<br>
 And darkness pour around.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Doth fancy sport, or do I hear her,<br>
 As nearer still she comes and nearer,<br>
 Cutting the billows bright? -.<br>
 How still! scarce even a light breeze flying! <br>
 Earth, water, air, at peace are lying<br>
 Beneath the calm moonlight.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>My heart beats high, my soul rejoices,<br>
 Methinks I hear their merry voices--<br>
 She soon will reach the shore.--<br>
 Ah me! my hopes, my hopes are failing, <br>
 Yon sable cloud is onwards sailing--<br>
 The moon it covers o'er.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Now o'er the lake they dubious wander,<br>
 And on some part remote may strand her, <br>
 Unless they aid obtain--<br>
 I'll wave a signal from the summit<br>
 Of you high bank, and haply from it<br>
 Some guidance they may gain.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The cloud moves on, the moonlight beameth<br>
 And o'er the lovely lady streameth,<br>
 Upon her lofty stand.<br>
 With joyful shout the boatmen greet her, <br>
 Her anxious lover hastes to meet her,<br>
 And eager springs to land.</blockquote>
