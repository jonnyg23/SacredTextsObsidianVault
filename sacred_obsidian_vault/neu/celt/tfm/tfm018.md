 <p align="CENTER">SIR OLOF IN THE ELVE-DANCE</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>SIR Olof he rode out at early day,<br>
 And so came he unto an Elve-dance gay.<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The Elve-father reached out his white hand free,<br>
 "Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"O nought I will, and nought I may,<br>
 To-morrow will be my wedding-day.'<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And the Elve-mother reached out her white hand free,<br>
 "Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"O nought I will, and nought I may,<br>
 To-morrow will be my wedding-day."<br>
 The dance.it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And the Elve-sister reached out her white hand free,<br>
 "Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"O nought I will, and nought I may,<br>
 To-morrow will be my wedding-day."<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And the bride she spake with her bride-maids so,<br>
 "What may it mean that the bells thus go?"<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Tis the custom of this our isle," they replied;<br>
 "Each young swain ringeth home his bride."<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And the truth from you to conceal I fear,<br>
 Sir Olof is dead, and lies on his bier."<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And on the morrow, ere light was the day,<br>
 In Sir Olof's house three corpses lay.<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It was Sir Olof, his bonny bride,<br>
 And eke his mother, of sorrow she died.<br>
 The dance it goes well,<br>
 So well in the grove. [a]</blockquote>
