 <p align="CENTER">KIRSTEN'S HILL</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>THERE is a hill on the lands of Skjelverod, near Ringsted, called Kirsten's-hill <i>(Kirstens Bjerg). </i>In it there lived a Hill-troll whose name was Skynd, who had from time to time stolen no less than three wives from a man in the village of Englerup.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It was late one evening when this man was riding hone from Ringsted, and his way lay by the hill. When he came there he saw a great crowd of Hill-folk who were dancing round it, and had great merriment among them. But on looking a little closer, what should he recognise but all his three wives among them! Now as Kirsten, the second of them, had been his favourite, and dearer to him than either of the others, he called out to her, and named her name. Troll Skynd then came up to the man, and asked him why he presumed to call Kirsten. The man told him briefly how she had been his favourite and best beloved wife, and entreated of him, with many tears and much lamentation, to let him have her home with him again. The Troll consented at last to grant the husband's request, with, however, the condition, that he should never hurry <i>(skynde) </i>her.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>For a long time the husband strictly kept the condition; but one day, when the woman was above in the loft, getting something, and it happened that she delayed a long time, he called out, Make haste, Kirsten, make haste, <i>(Skynde dig Kirsten); </i>and scarcely had he spoken the words, when the woman was gone, compelled to return to the hill, which has ever since been called Kirsten's Bjerg.
