 <p align="CENTER">ALEXANDER SELKIRK'S DREAM</p>
 <p align="CENTER">COMPOSED ONE DAY WHEN CONFINED TO BED BY A COLD<br>
 AND UNABLE TO READ</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>O'ER the isle of Juan Fernandez<br>
 Cooling shades of evening spread,<br>
 While upon the peaks of Andes<br>
 Still the tints of day were shed.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>From the sea-beat shore returning <br>
 Homeward hied the lonely man,<br>
 O'er his cheerless fortune mourning, <br>
 As through past days memory ran.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Soon his brief repast was ended<br>
 And he sought his lowly bed;<br>
 Balmy slumber there descended,<br>
 Shedding influence o'er his head.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then a vision full of gladness<br>
 Came, sent forth by Him supreme,<br>
 Who his suffering servants' sadness <br>
 Oft dispelleth in a dream.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>*</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In his view the lively dream sets<br>
 Hills and vales in verdure bright;<br>
 Where the gaily-prattling streamlets <br>
 Sparkle in the morning-light.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Hark! the holy bell is swinging,<br>
 Calling to the house of prayer;<br>
 Loud resounds the solemn ringing<br>
 Through the still and balmy air.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Youths and maids from glen and mountain <br>
 Hasten at the hallowed sound,<br>
 Old men rest by shady fountain,<br>
 Children lay them on the ground.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Now the pious throng is streaming <br>
 Through the temple's portal low;<br>
 Rapture in each face is beaming<br>
 Pure devotion's genuine glow.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Fervently the hoary pastor,<br>
 Humbly bent before his God,<br>
 Supplicates their heavenly Master<br>
 Them to lead on Sion's road;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Owns that all have widely erred<br>
 From the true, the narrow way,<br>
 That with Him we have no merit,<br>
 And no claim of right can lay.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Loud then rise in choral measure <br>
 Hymns of gratitude and praise,<br>
 As, inspired with solemn pleasure,<br>
 Unto Heaven their strains they raise.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Now the grave discourse beginneth,<br>
 Which, ungraced by rhetoric's arts,<br>
 Quick the rapt attention winneth,<br>
 While it glorious truths imparts;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>While it tells how kind is Heaven<br>
 To the race of him who fell;<br>
 How of old the Son was given<br>
 To redeem from pains of hell;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>How the Holy Spirit abideth<br>
 In their hearts that hear his call;<br>
 How our God for all provideth,<br>
 How His mercy's over all;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>How, beyond the grave extending,<br>
 Regions lie of endless bliss;<br>
 How our thoughts on that world bending, <br>
 We should careless be of this.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Once again the raised hymn pealeth<br>
 Notes of joy and jubilee,<br>
 Praising Him who truth revealeth,<br>
 Dweller of Eternity!</blockquote>
 <blockquote>*</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Night's dim shades were now retreating, <br>
 Over Andes rose the day<br>
 On the hills the kids' loud bleating<br>
 Lingering slumber chased away.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Birds their merry notes were singing, <br>
 Joyous at the approach of morn--<br>
 Morn that, light and fragrance flinging, <br>
 Earth doth cherish and adorn.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Waked by Nature's general chorus<br>
 Selkirk quits his lonely couch,<br>
 While o'er heaven run colours glorious, <br>
 Heralding the sun's approach.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Still the vision hovers o'er him, <br>
 Still the heavenly strains he hears,<br>
 Setting those bright realms before him<br>
 Where are wiped away all tears.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>All this vain and transitory <br>
 State of mankind here on earth,<br>
 Weighed with that exceeding glory,<br>
 Now he deems as nothing worth.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Low he bends in adoration,<br>
 As the sun ascends the sky;<br>
 Doubt and fear and lamentation<br>
 With the night's last shadows fly.</blockquote>
