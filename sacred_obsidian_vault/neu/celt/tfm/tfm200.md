 <p align="CENTER">TO AMANDA</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>[These are the verses quoted in the Introduction to the "Tales and Popular Fictions." The author was very young when he wrote them; and Amanda was, like Beatrice and Laura, a mere <i>donna di mente, </i>having no real existence.]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>As when a storm in vernal skies<br>
 The face of day doth stain,<br>
 And o'er the smiling landscape flies,<br>
 With mist and drizzling rain;<br>
 If chance the sun look through the shower <br>
 O'er flowery hill and dale,<br>
 Reviving Nature owns his power,<br>
 And softly sighs the gale:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>So when, by anxious thoughts oppressed,<br>
 My soul sinks in despair,<br>
 When smiling hope deserts my breast,<br>
 And all is darkness there<br>
 If chance Amanda's form appear,<br>
 The gloom is chased away,<br>
 My soul once more her soft smiles cheer,<br>
 And joy resumes his sway.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then, dear Amanda, since thy smile<br>
 Has power all gloom to charm,<br>
 Oh! ever thus my cares beguile,<br>
 And guard my soul from harm.<br>
 Let Hymen's bands our fates unite,<br>
 What bliss may then be ours!--<br>
 Our days will glide, like streamlets bright,<br>
 O'erhung with fragrant flowers.</blockquote>
