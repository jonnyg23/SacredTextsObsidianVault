 <blockquote><br>
 <br>
 A WIDOW and her son, a little boy, lived, together in a cottage in or near the village of Rothley, Northumberland. One winter's evening the child refused to go to bed with his mother, as he wished to sit up for a while longer, "for," said he, "I am not sleepy." The mother finding remonstrance in vain, at last told him that if he sat up by himself the faries would most certainly come and take him away. The boy laughed as his mother went to bed, leaving him sitting by the fire; he had not been there long, watching the fire and enjoying its cheerful warmth, till a beautiful little figure, about the size of a child's doll, descended the chimney and alighted on the hearth! The little fellow was somewhat startled at first, but its prepossessing smile as it paced to and fro before him soon overcame his fears, and he inquired familiarly, "What do they ca' thou?" "Ainsel," answered the little thing haughtily, at the same time retorting the question, "And what do they ca' <i>thou?" "My </i>ainsel'," answered the boy; and they commenced playing together like two children newly acquainted. Their gambols continued quite innocently until the fire began to grow dim; the boy then took up the poker to stir it, when a hot cinder accidentally fell upon the foot of his playmate; her tiny voice was instantly raised to a most terrific roar, and the boy had scarcely time to crouch into the bed behind his mother, before the voice of the old fary-mother was heard shouting, "Who's done it? 'Who's done it?" "Oh! it was my ainsel!" answered the daughter. "Why, then," said the mother, as she kicked her up the chimney, "what 's all this noise for: there's nyon <i>(i.e. </i>no one) to blame."</blockquote>

 <blockquote>Such is the sum of what we have been able to collect respecting the popular fairy-lore of England, the largest and most complete collection that, to our knowledge, has ever been made. We might venture to add that little more is ever likely to be collected, for the sounds of the cotton-mill, the steam-engine, and, more than all, the whistle of the railway train, more powerful than any exorcists, have banished, or soon will banish, the fairy tribes from all their accustomed haunts, and their name and their exploits will in future be found in works like the present rather than in village tradition.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>As the merry spirit, Puck, is so prominent an actor in the scenes forming our next division, this may be deemed no unfitting place for the consideration of his various appellations; such as Puck, Robin Good-fellow, Robin Hood, Hobgoblin.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Puck is evidently the same with the old word <i>Pouke, </i>[a]<i> </i>the original meaning of which would seem to be devil, demon, or evil spirit. We first meet with it in the Vision of Piers Ploughman, where it undoubtedly signifies 'the grand adversary of God and man.'</blockquote>
 <blockquote>When, in this poem, [b] the Seer beholds Abraham, the personification of Faith, with his "wide clothes," within which lay a Lazar,</blockquote><dir>

 <blockquote>Amonges patriarkes and prophetes,<br>

 <blockquote>Golding also must have understood Pooke in the sense of devil, when in the ninth book of his translation of Ovid, unauthorised however by the original, he applies it to the Chimaera,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The country where Chymsara, that same <i>pooke<br>
 </i>Hath goatish body, lion's head and brist, and dragon's tayle.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Spenser employs the word, and he clearly distinguishes it from hob-goblin:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Ne let housefires nor lightnings helpless harms,<br>
 Ne let the <i>pouke </i>[c]<i> </i>nor other evil sprites,<br>
 Ne let mischievous witches with their charms,<br>
 No let <i>hob-goblins, </i>names whom sense we see not,<br>
 Fray us with things that be not--<i>Epithalamion, </i>v. 340.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>These terms are also distinguished in the poem named The Scourge of Venus:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And that they may perceive the heavens frown,<br>
 The <i>poukes </i>and <i>goblins </i>pull the coverings down.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In Ben Jonson's play of The Devil is an Ass, the unlucky fiend who gives origin to its name is called Pug, and in the same author's Sad Shepherd the personage named Puck-hairy is, as Gifford justly observes, "not the Fairy or Oriental Puck, though often confounded with him." [d] In truth, it is first in Shakespeare that we find Puck confounded with the House-spirit, and having those traits of character which are now regarded as his very essence, and have caused his name Pug to be given to the agile mischievous monkey, and to a kind of little dog.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>We will now discuss the origin of this far-famed appellation and its derivation.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the Slavonic tongues, which are akin to the Teutonic, <i>Bôg</i> is God, and there are sleights of etymology which would identify the two terms; the Icelandic Puki is an evil spirit, and such we have seen was the English Pouke, which easily became Puck, Pug, and Bug; finally, in Friesland the Kobold is called Puk, and in old German we meet with Putt or Butz as the name of a being not unlike the original English Puck.[e] The Devonshire fairies are called Pixies, and the Irish have their Pooka, and the Welsh their Pwcca, both derived from Pouke or Puck. From Bug comes the Scottish Bogle, (which Gawin Douglas expressly distinguishes from the Brownie) and the Yorkshire Boggart. [f] The Swedish language has the terms <i>spöka, spöke; </i>the Danish <i>spöge, spögelse, </i>the German, <i>spuken, spuk, </i>all used of spirits or ghosts, and their apparitions. Perhaps the Scottish <i>pawkey, </i>sly, knowing, may belong to the same family of words. Akin to Bogle was the old English term Puckle, noticed above, which is still retained in the sense of mischievous, as in Peregrine Pickle and Little Pickle. It has been conjectured [g] that <i>Picklehäring, </i>the German term for zany or merry-andrew, may have been properly <i>Picklehärin, i.e. </i>the hairy sprite, answering to Jonson<sup>1</sup>s Puck-hairy, and that he may have worn a vesture of hair or leaves to be rough like the Brownie and kindred beings.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>From Bug also come Bugbear, and Bugleboo, or Bugaboo. They owe their origin probably to the Ho! Ho! Ho! given to Puck or Robin Goodfellow, as it was to the Devil <i>(i.e., </i>Pouke) in the Mysteries. Bull-beggar may be only a corruption of Bugbear. [h]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The following passage from a writer of the present day proves that in some places the idea of Puck as a spirit haunting the woods and fields is still retained. "The peasantry" says Mr. Allies, [i] "of Alfrick and those parts of Worcestershire, say that they are sometimes what they call <i>Poake-ledden, </i>that is, that they are occasionally waylaid in the night by a mischievous sprite whom they call Poake, who leads them into ditches, bogs, pools, and. other such scrapes, and then sets up a loud laugh and leaves them quite bewildered in the lurch." This is what in Devon is called being <i>Pixy-led. </i>We may observe the likeness here to the Puck of Shakspeare and Drayton, who were both natives of the adjoining county.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>A further proof perhaps of Puck's rural and extern character is the following rather trifling circumstance. An old name of the fungus named <i>puffball </i>is <i>puck-fist</i>, which is plainly Puck's-fist, and not <i>puff-fist </i>as Nares conjectured; for its Irish name is <i>Cos-a-Phooka, </i>or Pooka's-foot, <i>i.e., </i>Puck's-foot. We will add by the way, that the Anglo-Saxon, Wolf's-fist, is rendered in the dictionaries toadstool, mushroom, and we cannot help suspecting that as wolf and elf were sometimes confounded, and wolf and fist are, in fact, incompatible terms, this was originally Elf's-fist, and that the mushrooms meant were not the thick ugly toadstools, the "grislie todestooles," of Spenser, but those delicate fungi called in Ireland <i>fairy-mushrooms </i>and which perhaps in England also were ascribed to the fairies. [j]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>So much then for Puck; we will now consider some other terms.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Robin Goodfellow, of whom we have given above a full account, is evidently a domestic spirit, answering in name and character to the Nisse God-dreng of Scandinavia, the Knecht Ruprecht, <i>i.e., </i>Robin of Germany. He seems to unite in his person the Boggart and Barguest of Yorkshire.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Hob-goblin is, as we have seen, another name of the same spirit. Goblin is the French <i>gobelin, </i>German Kobold; Hob is Rob, Robin, Bob; just as Hodge is Roger. We still have the proper names Hobbs, Hobson, like Dix, Dixon, Wills, Wilson; by the way, Hick, <i>i. e. </i>Dick, from Richard, still remains in Hicks, Hickson.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Robin Hood, though we can produce no instance of it, must, we think, also have been an appellation of this spirit, and been given to the famed outlaw of merry Sherwood, from his sportive character and his abiding in the recesses of the greenwood. The hood is a usual appendage of the domestic spirit.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Roguery and sportiveness are, we may see, the characteristics of this spirit. Hence it may have been that the diminutives of proper names were given to him, and even to the Ignis Fatuus, which in a country like England, that was in general dry<i> </i>and free from sloughs and bog-holes, was mischievous rather than dangerous. [k] But this seems to have been a custom of our forefathers, for we find the devil himself called Old Nick, and Old Davy is the sailor's familiar name for Death.</blockquote>
 <blockquote><a name="img_11"></a>

 <blockquote>In the Midsummer Night's Dream the fairy says to Puck "Thou Lob of spirits;<i>" </i>Milton has the <i>lubber-fiend, </i>and Fletcher says, [l] "There is a pretty tale of a witch that had a giant to be her son that was called Lob Lie-by-the-fire." This might lead us to suppose that <i>Lob, </i>whence <i>loby </i>(looby), <i>lubbard, lubber,</i> [m]<i> </i>and adding the diminutive <i>kin, </i>Lubberkin, a name of one of the clowns in Gay's Pastorals, was an original name of some kind of spirit. We shall presently see that the Irish name of the Leprechaun is actually Lubberkin. As to the origin of the name we have little to say, but it may have had a sense the very opposite of the present one of <i>lubber, </i>and have been connected with the verb <i>to leap. </i>[n]<i> </i>Grimm [o] tells of a spirit named the Good Lubber, to whom the bones of animals used to be offered at Mansfield in Germany; but we see no resemblance between him and our Lob of spirits; we might rather trace a connexion with the French Lutin, Lubin. [p] The phrase of <i>being in </i>or <i>getting into Lob's Pound </i>(like the "Pouke's pondfold,") is easy of explanation, if we suppose Lob to be a sportive spirit. it is equivalent to being <i>Poake-ledden </i>or <i>Pixy-led.</i></blockquote>
 <blockquote>Wight, answering to the German <i>Wicht, </i>seems to have been used in the time of Chaucer for elf or fairy, most probably for such as haunted houses, or it may have had the signification of <i>witch, </i>which is evidently another form of it. In the Miller's Tale the carpenter says,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>I crouchè thee from elves and from <i>wights.</i></blockquote>
 <blockquote>And</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Jesu Crist, and Seint Benedight,<br>
 Blisse this house from every wicked <i>wight. </i>[q]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Urchin is a term which, like <i>elf </i>and such like, we still apply to children, but which seems formerly to have been one of the appellations of the fairies. Reginald Scott, as we have seen, places it in his list, and we find it in the following places of the poets:</blockquote><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <i><blockquote>Urchins</blockquote>
 </i><blockquote>Shall for the vast of night that they may work<br>
 All exercise on <i>thee.--Tempest, </i>i. 2.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>                            His spirits hear me,<br>
             And yet I needs must curse; but they'll not pinch<br>
             Fright me with <i>urchin-shows, </i>pitch me i' the mire,<br>
             Nor lead me like a fire-brand in the dark<br>
             Out of my way, unless he bid <i>'em.--lb. </i>ii. 2.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Like <i>urchins, </i>ouphs, and fairies.</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>Merry Wives of Windsor, </blockquote></i>iv. 4.<br>
  
 <blockquote>Elves, <i>urchins, </i>goblins all, and little fairyes.</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>Mad Pranks, </blockquote></i>etc., p.38.
 <blockquote><br>
 Great store of goblins, fairies, bugs, nightmares,<br>
 <i>Urchins, </i>and elves, to many a house repairs.</blockquote>

 <i><blockquote>Comas, </blockquote></i>845.
 <blockquote><br>
 Urchin is a hedgehog, as Stevens has justly observed,[r] and in these lines of Titus Andronicus (ii. 3.)</blockquote>
 <blockquote>A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,<br>
 Ten thousand swelling toads, as many <i>urchins,</i></blockquote>
 <blockquote>it probably has this sense. We still call the <i>echinus marinus </i>the Sea-urchin. Still as we have no analogy, but rather the contrary, for transferring the name of an animal to the elves, we feel inclined to look for a different origin of the term as applied to these beings. The best or rather only hypothesis we have met with [s] is that which finds it in the hitherto unexplained word <i>Orcneas </i>in Beówulf which may have been <i>Orcenas, </i>and if, as we have supposed [t] the Anglo-Saxons sometimes pronounced <i>c </i>before <i>e </i>and <i>i </i>in the Italian manner, we should have, if needed, the exact word. We would also notice the old German <i>urkinde, </i>which Grimm renders <i>nanus. </i>[u]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>We now come to the poets.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In Beówulf, an Anglo-Saxon poem, supposed not to be later than the seventh century, we meet with the following verse,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Eotenas, and Ylfe,<br>
 And Orcneas."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The first of these words is evidently the same as the Iötunn or Giants of the northern mythology; the second is as plainly its Alfar, and we surely may be excused for supposing that the last may be the same as its Duergar.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Layamon, in the twelfth century, in his poetic paraphrase of Wace's Brut, [v] thus expands that poet's brief notice of the birth of Arthur:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Ertur son nom; de sa bunte<br>
 Ad grant parole puis este."<br>
 So soon he came on earth,<br>
 Elves received him.<br>
 They enchanted that child<br>
 With magic most strong.<br>
 They gave him might<br>
 To be the best of all knights.<br>
 They gave him another king.<br>
 They gave him the third<br>
 That he should long live.<br>
 They gave to that kingly child<br>
 Virtues most good.<br>
 That he was most generous<br>
 Of all men alive.<br>
 This the Elves him gave,<br>
 vv 19254: <i>seq</i>. </blockquote>
 <blockquote>If we have made any discovery of importance in the department of romantic literature, it is our identification of Ogier le Danois with the Eddaic Helgi. [w] We have shown among other points of resemblance, that as the Norns were at the birth of the one, so the Fées were at that of the other. With this circumstance Layamon was apparently acquainted, and when he wished to transfer it to Arthur as the Norns were no longer known and the Fées had not yet risen into importance, there only remained for him to employ the Elves, which had not yet acquired tiny dimensions. Hence then we see that the progress was Norns, Elves, Fées, and these last held their place in the subsequent Fairy tales of France and Italy.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>These potent Elves are still superior to the popular Fairies which we first met with in Chaucer.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Yet nothing in the passages in which he speaks of them leads to the inference of his conceiving them to be of a diminutive stature. His notions, indeed, on the subject seem very vague and unsettled; and there is something like a confusion of the Elves and Fairies of Romance, as the following passages will show:--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The Wife of Bathes Tale is evidently a Fairy tale. It thus commences:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In oldê dayès of the king Artoúr,<br>
 Of which that Bretons speken gret honoúr,<br>
 All was this lond fulfilled of faerie; [x]<br>
 The Elf-quene with her joly compagnie,<br>
 Danced ful oft in many a grenè mede.<br>
 This was the old opinion as I rede;<br>
 I speke of many hundred yeres ago.<br>
 But now can no man see non elvès mo,<br>
 For now the gretè charitee and prayéres<br>
 Of limitoures, and other holy freres,<br>
 That serchen every land and every streme,<br>
 As thikke as motes in the sonnè-beme,<br>
 Blissing halles, chambres, kichenès, and boures,<br>
 Citees and burghès, castles highe, and toures,<br>
 Thropès [y] and bernès, shepenes and dairiés,<br>
 This maketh that there ben no faëries;<br>
 For there as wont to walken was an elf,<br>
 There walketh now the limitour himself,<br>
 In undermelès, [z] and in morweninges,<br>
 And sayth his matines and his holy thinges,<br>
 As he goth in his limitatioun.<br>
 Women may now go safely up and down;<br>
 In every bush and under every tree<br>
 There is none other incubus but he,<br>
 And he ne will don hem no dishonoúr.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The Fairies therefore form a part of the tale, and they are thus introduced:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The day was come that homward must he turne;<br>
 And in his way it happed him to ride,<br>
 In all his care, under a forest side,<br>
 Wheras he saw upon a dancè go<br>
 Of ladies foure and twenty, and yet mo:<br>
 Toward this ilke dance he drow ful yerne,<br>
 In hope that he som wisdom shuldè lerne;<br>
 But certainly, er he came fully there,<br>
 Yvanished was this dance, he n'iste not wher;<br>
 No creäture saw he that barè lif,<br>
 Save on the grene he saw sitting a wif,<br>
 A fouler wight ther may no man devise.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>These ladies bear a great resemblance to the Elle-maids of Scandinavia. We need hardly inform our readers that this "foul wight" becomes the knight's deliverer from the imminent danger he is in, and that, when he has been forced to marry her, she is changed into a beautiful young maiden. But who or what she was the poet sayeth not.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the Marchantes Tale we meet the Faerie attendant on Pluto and Proserpina, their king and queen, a sort of blending of classic and Gothic mythology:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>for to tell</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The beautee of the gardin, and the well<br>
 That stood under a laurer alway grene;<br>
 Ful often time he Pluto, and his quene<br>
 Proserpina, and alle hir faerie [aa]<br>
 Disporten hem, and maken melodie<br>
 About that well, and daunced, as men told.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Again, in the same Tale:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And so befel in that bright morwe tide,<br>
 That, in the gardin, on the ferther side,<br>
 Pluto, that is the king of Faerie,<br>
 And many a ladye in his compagnie,<br>
 Folwing his wif, the quene Proserpina,<br>
 Which that he ravisshed out of Ethná,<br>
 While that she gadred floures in the mede,<br>
 (In Claudian ye may the story rede,<br>
 How that hire in his grisely carte he fette);<br>
 This king of Faërie adoun him sette<br>
 Upon a benche of turvès, fresh and grene.</blockquote>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>... to be continued ...</blockquote>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the conversation which ensues between these august personages, great knowledge of Scripture is displayed; and the queen, speaking, of the "sapient prince," passionately exclaims--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>I setè nat of all the vilanie<br>
 That he of women wrote a boterflie;<br>
 I am a woman nedès moste I speke,<br>
 Or swell unto that time min hertè breke.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Some might suspect a mystery in the queen's thus emphatically styling herself a woman, but we lay no stress upon it, as Faire Damoselle Pertelote, the hen, who was certainly less entitled to it, does the same.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the Man of Lawes Tale the word Elfe is employed, but whether as equivalent to witch or fairy is doubtful.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>This lettre spake, the quene delivered was<br>
 Of so horrible a fendliche creäture,<br>
 That in the castle, non so hardy was,<br>
 That any whilè dorste therein endure.<br>

 Y come, by charmès or by sorcerie,<br>
 And everich man hateth hire conlpagnie. [ab]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The Rime of Sir Thopas has been already considered as belonging to romance.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It thus appears that the works of manners-painting Chaucer give very little information respecting the popular belief in Fairies of his day. Were it not for the sly satire of the passage, we might be apt to suspect that, like one who lived away from the common people, he was willing to represent the superstition as extinct--" But now can no man see non elves mo." The only trait that he gives really characteristic of the popular elves is their love of dancing.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the poets that intervene between Chaucer and the Maiden Reign, we do not recollect to have noticed anything of importance respecting Fairies, except the employment, already adverted to, of that term, and that of Elves, by translators in rendering the Latin <i>Nymphae. </i>Of the size of these beings, the passages in question give no information.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But in Elizabeth's days, "Fairies," as Johnson observes, "were much in fashion; common tradition had made them familiar, and Spenser's poem had made them great." A just remark, no doubt, though Johnson fell into the common error of identifying Spenser's Fairies with the popular ones.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The three first books of the Faerie Queene were published in 1590, and, as Warton remarks, Fairies became a familiar and fashionable machinery with the poets and poetasters. Shakspeare, well acquainted, from the rural habits of his early life, with the notions of the peasantry respecting these beings, and highly gifted with the prescient power of genius, saw clearly how capable they were of being applied to the production of a species of the wonderful, as pleasing, or perhaps even more so, than the classic gods; and in the Midsummer-Night's Dream he presented them in combination with the heroes and heroines of the mythic age of Greece. But what cannot the magic wand of genius effect? We view with undisturbed delight the Elves of Gothic mythology sporting in the groves of Attica,, the legitimate haunts of Nymphs and Satyrs.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Shakspeare, having the Faerie Queene before his eyes, seems to have attempted a blending of the Elves of the village with the Fays of romance. His Fairies agree with the former in their diminutive stature,--diminished, indeed, to dimensions inappreciable by village gossips,--in their fondness for dancing, their love of cleanliness, and their child-abstracting propensities. Like the Fays, they form a community, ruled over by the princely Oberon and the fair Titania. [ac] There is a court and chivalry: Oberon would have the queen's sweet changeling to be a "Knight of his train to trace the forest wild." Like earthly monarchs, he has his jester, "the shrewd and knavish sprite, called Robin Good-fellow."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The luxuriant imagination of the poet seemed to exult in pouring forth its wealth in the production of these new actors on the mimic scene, and a profusion of poetic imagery always appears in their train. Such lovely and truly British poetry cannot be too often brought to view; we will therefore insert in this part of our work several of these gems of our Parnassus, distinguishing by a different character such acts and attributes as appear properly to belong to the Fairy of popular belief.</blockquote>

 <blockquote>In his Shepherd's Pipe, also, Brown thus speaks of the Fairies:--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Many times he hath been seen<br>
 With the fairies on the green,<br>
 And to them his pipe did sound<br>
 While they danced in a round.<br>
 Mickle solace they would make him,<br>
 And at midnight often wake him<br>
 And convey him from his room<br>
 To a field of yellow-broom;<br>
 Or into the meadows where<br>
 Mints perfume the gentle air,<br>
 And where Flora spreads her treasure;<br>
 There they would begin their measure.<br>
 If it chanced night's sable shrouds<br>
 Mused Cynthia up in clouds,<br>
 Safely home they then would see him,<br>
 And from brakes and quagmires free him.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But Drayton is the poet after Shakespeare for whom the Fairies had the greatest attractions. Even in the Polyobion he does not neglect them. In Song xxi., Ringdale, in Cambridgeshire, says,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>For in my very midst there is a swelling ground<br>
 About which Ceres' nymphs dance many a wanton round;<br>
 The frisking fairy there, as on the light air borne,<br>
 Oft run at barley-break upon the ears of corn;<br>
 And catching drops of dew in their lascivious chases.<br>
 Do cast the liquid pearl in one another's faces.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And in Song iv., he had spoken of</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The feasts that underground the faery did him (Arthur) make,<br>
 And there how he enjoyed the Lady of the Lake.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Nymphidia is a delicious piece of airy and fanciful invention. The description of Oberon's palace in the air, Mab's amours with the gentle Pigwiggin, the mad freaks of the jealous Oberon, the pygmy Orlando, the mutual artifices of<i> </i>Puck and the Fairy maids of honour, Hop, Mop, Pip, Trip, and Co., and the furious combat of Oberon and the doughty Pigwiggin, mounted on their earwig chargers--present altogether an unequalled fancy-piece, set in the very best and most appropriate frame of metre.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It contains, moreover, several traits of traditionary Fairy lore, such as in these lines:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Hence shadows, seeming idle shapes <br>
 Of little frisking elves and apes, <br>
 To earth do make their wanton skapes<br>
 As hope of pastime hastes them;<br>
 Which maids think on the hearth they see, <br>
 When fires well near consumed be, <br>
 There dancing hays by two and three,<br>
 Just as their fancy casts them. [ar]<br>
 These make our girls their sluttery rue, <br>
 By pinching them both black and blue, <br>
 And put a penny in their shoe,<br>
 The house for cleanly sweeping;<br>
 And in their courses make that round, <br>
 In meadows and in marshes found, <br>
 Of them so call'd the fairy ground,<br>
 Of which they have the keeping.<br>
 These, when a child haps to be got, <br>
 That after proves an idiot, <br>
 When folk perceive it thriveth not,<br>
 The fault therein to smother,<br>
 Some silly, doating, brainless calf;<br>
 That understands things by the half;<br>
 Says that the fairy left this aulf; <br>
 And took away the other.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And in these:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Scarce set on shore but therewithal<br>
 He meeteth Puck, whom most men call<br>
 Hobgoblin, and on him doth fail <br>
 With words from frenzy spoken;<br>
 "Ho! ho!" quoth Puck, "God save your Grace!<br>
 Who drest you in this piteous case?<br>
 He thus that spoiled my sovereign's face, <br>
 I would his neck were broken.<br>
 This Puck seems but a dreaming dolt, <br>
 Still walking like a ragged colt, <br>
 And oft out of a bush doth bolt,<br>
 Of purpose to deceive us; <br>
 And leading us, makes us to stray <br>
 Long winter nights out of the way;<br>
 And when we stick in mire and clay, <br>
 He doth with laughter leave us.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In his Poet's Elysium there is some beautiful Fairy poetry, which we do not recollect to have seen noticed any where. This work is divided into ten Nymphals, or pastoral dialogues. The Poet's Elysium is, we are told, a paradise upon earth, inhabited by Poets, Nymphs, and the Muses.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The poet's paradise this is,<br>
 To which but few can come,<br>
 The Muses' only bower of bliss,<br>
 Their dear Elysium.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the eighth Nymphal,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>A nymph is married to a fay,<br>
 Great preparations for the day,<br>
 All rites of nuptials they recite you<br>
 To the bridal, and invite you.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The dialogue commences between the nymphs Mertilla and Claia:</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>M. </blockquote></i>But will our Tita wed this fay?<br>
 <i>C. </i>Yes, and to-morrow is the day.<br>
 <i>M. </i>But why should she bestow herself<br>
 Upon this dwarfish fairy elf?<br>
 <i>C. </i>Why, by her smallness, you may find<br>
 That she is of the fairy kind;<br>
 And therefore apt to choose her make<br>
 Whence she did her beginning take;<br>
 Besides he 's deft and wondrous airy,<br>
 And of the noblest of the fairy, [as]
 <blockquote>Chief of the Crickets, [at] of much fame, <br>
 In Fairy a most ancient name.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The nymphs now proceed. to describe the bridal array of Tita: her jewels are to be dew-drops; her head-dress the "yellows in the full-blown rose;" her gown</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Of pansy, pink, and primrose leaves,<br>
 Most curiously laid on in threaves;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>her train the "cast slough of a snake;" her canopy composed of "moons from the peacock's tail," and. "feathers from the pheasant's head;"</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Mix'd with the plume (of so high price),<br>
 The precious bird of paradise;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>and it shall be</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Borne o'er our head (by our inquiry)<br>
 By elfs, the fittest of the fairy.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Her buskins of the "dainty shell" of the lady-cow. The musicians are to be the nightingale, lark, thrush, and other songsters of the grove.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But for still music, we will keep<br>
 The wren and titmouse, which to sleep<br>
 Shall sing the bride when she's alone,<br>
 The rest into their chambers gone;<br>
 And like those upon ropes that walk<br>
 On gossamer from stalk to stalk,<br>
 The tripping fairy tricks shall play<br>
 The evening of the wedding day.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Finally, the bride-bed is to be of roses; the curtains, tester, and all, of the "flower imperial;" the fringe hung with harebells; the pillows of lilies, "with down stuft of the butterfly;"</blockquote>
 <blockquote>For our Tita is to-day,<br>
 To be married to a fay.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In Nymphal iii.,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The fairies are hopping, <br>
 The small flowers cropping, <br>
 And with dew dropping,<br>
 Skip thorow the greaves.<br>
 At barley-break they play<br>
 Merrily all the day:<br>
 At night themselves they lay <br>
 Upon the soft leaves.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And in Nymphal vi. the forester says,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The dryads, hamadryads, the satyrs, and the fawns,<br>
 Oft play at hide-and-seek before me on the lawns;<br>
 The frisking fairy oft, when horned Cynthia shines,<br>
 Before me as I walk dance wanton matachines.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Herrick is generally regarded as the Fairy-poet, <i>par excellence; </i>but, in our opinion, without sufficient reason, for Drayton's Fairy pieces are much superior to his.

 <blockquote>Regardless of Mr. Gifford's sneer at "those who may undertake the unprofitable drudgery of tracing out the property of every word, and phrase, and idea in Milton," [aw] we will venture to trace a little here, and beg the reader to compare this passage with one quoted above from Harsenet, and to say if the resemblance be accidental. The truth is, Milton, reared in London, probably knew the popular superstitions chiefly or altogether from books; and almost every idea in this passage may be found in books that he must have read.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the hands of Dryden the Elves of Chaucer lose their indefiniteness. In the opening of the Wife of Bath her Tale,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The king of elves and <i>little </i>fairy queen<br>
 Gamboled on heaths and danced on every green.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And</blockquote>

 The dairy-maid expects no fairy guest<br>
 To skim the bowls, and after pay the feast.<br>
 She sighs, and shakes her empty shoes in vain,<br>
 No silver penny to reward her pain.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>In the Flower and the Leaf, unauthorised by the old bard, he makes the knights and dames, the servants of the Daisy and of the Agnus Castus, Fairies, subject, like the Italian Fate, to "cruel Demogorgon."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Pope took equal liberties with his original, as may be seen by a comparison of the following verses with those quoted above:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>About this spring, if ancient fame say true,<br>
 The dapper elves their moonlight sports pursae:<br>
 Their pigmy king and little fairy queen<br>
 In circling dances gamboled on the green,<br>
 While tuneful sprites a merry concert made,<br>
 And airy music warbled through the shade.</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>January and May, </blockquote></i>459.
 <blockquote>It so befel, in that fair morning tide,<br>
 The fairies sported on the garden's side,<br>
 And in the midst their monarch and his bride.<br>
 So featly tripp'd the light-foot ladies round,<br>
 The knight so nimbly o'er the greensward bound,<br>
 That scarce they bent the flowers or touch'd the ground.<br>
 The dances ended, all the fairy train<br>
 For pinks and daisies search'd the flowery plain. [ax]</blockquote>

 <blockquote>With the Kensington Garden [ay] of Tickell, Pope's contemporary, our Fairy-poetry may be said to have terminated. [az] Collins, Beattie, and a few other poets of the last century make occasional allusions to it, and some attempts to revive it have been made in the present century. But vain are such efforts, the belief is gone, and divested of it such poetry can produce no effect. The Fairies have shared the fate of the gods of ancient Hellas.</blockquote>
