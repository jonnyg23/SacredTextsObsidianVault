 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>AT Seewenweiher, in the Black-Forest, a little Water-man <i>(Seemänlein) </i>used to come and join the people, work the whole day long with them, and in the evening go back into the lakes. They used to set his breakfast and dinner apart for him. When, in apportioning the work, the rule of "Not too much and not too little" was infringed, he got angry, and knocked all the things about. Though his clothes were old and worn, he steadily refused to let the people get him new ones. But when at last they would do so, and one evening the lake-man was presented with a new coat, be said, "When one is paid off, one must go away. After this day I'II come no more to you." And, unmoved by the excuses of the people, he never let himself be seen again. [a]</blockquote>
