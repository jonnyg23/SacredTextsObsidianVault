 <p align="CENTER">THE PRAISES OF MAZENDERAN</p>
 <blockquote><br>
 [The object of this version was to give a correct idea of the animated anapastic measure in which the Shib-Nameh Is written. Our knowledge of Persian was extremely slight; but a friendly Orientalist gave us a faithful line-for-line translation, which we versified, and he and Ram Mohun Roy then compared our version with the original.]</blockquote>

 <blockquote>His band from the lute hath its melody drawn,<br>
 And thus rose the song of Mazenderân:--<br>
 May Mazenderan, the land of my birth,<br>
 Its hills and its dales, be e'er famed o'er the earth:<br>
 For evermore blooms in its<i> </i>gardens the rose,<br>
 On its hills nods the tulip, the hyacinth blows;<br>
 Its air ever fragrant, its earth flourishing,<br>
 Cold or heat is not felt,--'tis perpetual spring.<br>
 The nightingale's lays in the gardens resound;<br>
 On the sides of the mountains the stately deer bound,<br>
 In search evermore of their pastime and food;<br>
 With fragrance and colour each season's bedewed;<br>
 Its streams of rose-water unceasingly roll,<br>
 Whose perfume doth gladness diffuse o'er the soul<br>
 In November, December, and January,<br>
 Pull of tulips the ground thou mayest everywhere see;<br>
 The springs, unexhausted, flow all through the year;<br>
 The hawk at his chase everywhere doth appear.<br>
 The region of bliss is adorned all o'er<br>
 With dinars, with rich stuffs, and with all costly store;<br>
 The idol-adorers with fine gold are crowned,<br>
 And girdles of gold gird the heroes renowned.<br>
 Whoe'er hath not dwelt in that region so bright,<br>
 His soul knows no pleasure, his heart no delight.</blockquote>
