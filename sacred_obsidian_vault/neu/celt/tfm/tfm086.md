 <p align="CENTER">THE KOBOLDS [a]</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>Von Kobolt sang die Amme mir<br>
 Von Kobolt sing' ich winder.<br>
 VON HALEM.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Of Kobold sang my nurse to me;<br>
 Of Kobold I too sing.</blockquote>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>THE Kobold is exactly the same being as the Danish Nis, and Scottish Brownie, and English Hobgoblin. [b] He performs the very same services for the family to whom he attaches himself.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>When the Kobold is about coming into any place, he first makes trial of the disposition of the family in this way. He brings chips and saw-dust into the house, and throws dirt into the milk vessels. If the master of the house takes care that the chips are not scattered about, and that the dirt is left in the vessels, and the milk drunk out of them, the Kobold comes and stays in the house as long as there is one of the family alive.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The change of servants does not affect the Kobold, who still remains. The maid who is going away must recommend her successor to take care of him, and treat him well. If she does not so, things go ill with her till she is also obliged to leave the place.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The history of the celebrated Hinzelmann will give most full and satisfactory information respecting the nature and properties of Kobolds; for such he was, though he used constantly to deny it. His history was written at considerable length by a pious minister, named Feldmann. MM. Grimm gives us the following abridgement of it. [c]</blockquote>

 <font face="Times New Roman"><blockquote>[a] This word is usually derived from the Greek κόβαλος</blockquote></font><i>, </i>a knave, which is found in Aristophanes. According to Grimm (p. 468) the German Kobold is not mentioned by any writer anterior to the thirteenth century; we find the French Gobelin in the eleventh; see <i>France.
