 <p align="CENTER">DUKE MAGNUS AND THE MERMAID</p>
 <blockquote><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 DUKE MAGNUS looked out through the castle window,<br>
 How the stream ran so rapidly;<br>
 And there he saw how upon the stream sat<br>
 A woman most fair and lovelie,</blockquote><dir>

 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, plight thee to me,<br>
 I pray you still so freely;<br>
 Say me not nay, but yes, yes!</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"O, to you I will give a travelling ship,<br>
 The best that a knight would guide;<br>
 It goeth as well on water as on firm land,<br>
 And through the fields all so wide.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"O, to you will I give a courser gray,<br>
 The best that a knight would ride;<br>
 He goeth as well on water as on firm land,<br>
 And through the groves all so wide."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"O, how should I plight me to you?<br>
 I never any quiet get;<br>
 I serve the king and my native land,<br>
 But with woman I match me not yet."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"To you will I give as much of gold<br>
 As for more than your life will endure;<br>
 And of pearls and precious stones handfuls;<br>
 And all shall be so pure."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"O gladly would I plight me to thee,<br>
 If thou wert of Christian kind;<br>
 But now thou art a vile sea-troll,<br>
 My love thou canst never win."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, bethink thee well,<br>
 And answer not so haughtily;<br>
 For if thou wilt not plight thee to me,<br>
 Thou shalt ever crazy be."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"I am a king's son so good,<br>
 How can I let you gain me?<br>
 You dwell not on land, but in the flood,<br>
 Which would not with me agree."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, plight thee to me,<br>
 I offer you still so freely;<br>
 Say me not nay, but yes, yes! [a]</blockquote>

 <blockquote>[a] This is a ballad from Småland. Magnus was the youngest son of Gustavus Vass. He died out of his mind, It is well known that insanity pervaded the Vass family for centuries.</blockquote>
