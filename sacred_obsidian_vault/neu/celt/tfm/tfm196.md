 <p align="CENTER">ROUSSEAU'S DREAM</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>THESE verses are adapted to the well-known air. They were suggested by a passage from Rousseau's works, quoted by Alison in his Essay on Taste. Though real names are mentioned, the scenery and subject are purely ideal.</blockquote><dir>
 
 <blockquote>Calmly at eve shone the sun o'er Lake Leman,<br>
 Bright in his beam lay the watery expanse,<br>
 Softly the white sails reflected his gleaming,<br>
 Groves, banks, and trees their slow shadows advance.<br>
 Cool from the mountains the summer-gale breathed,<br>
 Laden with fragrance the lake it came o'er;<br>
 Leman, exulting, danced joyous beneath it,<br>
 Light crisped waves gently roll to the shore.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>At that soft hour on the blue Leman rowing,<br>
 Slowly a sage urged his bark by a grove,<br>
 Silently musing, his lofty mind glowing,<br>
 Viewing earths pomp and the glories above<br>
 As o'er the lake the long shadows extended,<br>
 Whispering the breeze, lulled each sense to repose;<br>
 Calm he reclined, and as slumber descended,<br>
 Visions of bliss to his fancy arose.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Heaven to his view seemed arrayed in new glory,<br>
 Earth breathed forth fragrance and basked in the ray<br>
 Clad in loose raiment, more white than the hoary<br>
 Front of Mont Blanc, came a son of the day.<br>
 Lightly his wand o'er the slumberer extending,<br>
 While with new joy laughed the earth, sky, and lake;<br>
 Love in his accents with soft pity blending,<br>
 Shedding content, thus the bright vision spake:--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Hither I come, from ray cloud-crowned station,<br>
 Touched with thy grief; to shed balm o'er thy mind<sup> </sup>'<br>
 I am the Spirit to whom, at creation,<br>
 Charge was by Heaven o'er this region assigned.<br>
 List to my accents, thou hunted by malice!<br>
 Let what I utter sink deep in thy breast:<br>
 Fly from mankind, to the lakes, hills, and valleys,<br>
 Thus, thus alone, shall thy spirit find rest.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"But if again to the world thou now fliest,<br>
 Thou should return, and again meet thy foes,<br>
 Think on this hour, when for comfort thou sighest,<br>
 And the bright scene will dispel all thy woes."<br>
 Gone was the vision: eve's star now was glancing,<br>
 Cold came the breeze o'er the blue curling stream;<br>
 Waked from his slumber, his heart with joy dancing,<br>
 Homeward he turned, and still mused on his dream.</blockquote>
