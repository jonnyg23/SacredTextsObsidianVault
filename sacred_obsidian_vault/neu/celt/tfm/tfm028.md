 <blockquote>[a] Niebuhr, speaking of the Celsi Ramnes, says, "With us the salutation of blood relations was <i>Willkommen stolze Vetter </i>(Welcome, proud cousins) and in the Danish ballads, proud <i>(stolt) </i>is a noble appellation of a maiden."--Römische Geschichte, 2d edit. vol. i. p. 316.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It may be added, that in English, <i>proud </i>and the synonymous terni <i>stout (stolz, stolt) </i>had also the sense of noble, high-born.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Do now your devoir, yonge knightes <i>proud.<br>
 Knight's Tale.</i></blockquote>
 <blockquote>Up stood the queen and ladies stout.<br>
 <i>Launfal.</i></blockquote>
 <blockquote>[b] <i>Men jag vet a sorge är tung.<br>
 <br>
 </i>[c] Wain, our readers hardly need be informed, originally signified any kind of carriage: see Faerie Queene, <i>passim. </i>It is the Ang. Sax. <i>páen</i>, and not a contraction of <i>waggon.<br>
 <br>
 </i>[d] From Vermland and Upland.</blockquote>
