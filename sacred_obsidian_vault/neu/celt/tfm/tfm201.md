 <blockquote>Written in Rome in the Spring of 1842.</blockquote>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>FAIR Tibur, once the Muses' home, <br>
 Before us lay; around<br>
 Was spread the plain which mighty Rome <br>
 Oft saw with victory crowned.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The sun rode high, the sky was clear, <br>
 The lark poured forth his strain,<br>
 And flowers, the firstlings of the year, <br>
 Shed fragrance o'er the plain.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>A gentle lady turned on me<br>
 Her bright expressive eyes,<br>
 And bade the flame of poesy<br>
 Within my bosom rise.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>'Twas then I felt, I felt, alas!<br>
 How Time has dealt with me,<br>
 And how the rays of fancy pass,<br>
 And vanish utterly.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>For time has been when such a view <br>
 And mandate of the fair,<br>
 With images of brightest hue,<br>
 Had fill'd the land and air:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>While now I strive, and strive in vain, <br>
 To twine poetic flowers,<br>
 Since from me Time away has ta'en <br>
 Imagination's powers.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then lady, be thou gentle still,<br>
 Let pity sway thy breast;<br>
 Accept for deeds the fervent will<br>
 To honour thy behest,</blockquote>
