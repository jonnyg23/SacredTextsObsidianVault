 <p align="center">THE ELEMENTS.</p>  
 <p>1. There are three original principles, which are the three primary elements: the first, calas, hence all hardness, and it hardens every other thing, that comes in conjunction with it, and from this comes all corporeity; the second, fluidity, <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">2</font></a> and hence all freshness and softness, and it freshens and softens every thing that is commingled with it, and all moisture and all corporal change; the third, nwyvre, and hence all life, for whatever it mixes with becomes alive, as far as its species and capability permit.</p>  
 <p>Other teachers and wise men say thus:</p>  
 <p>2. There are five elements: calas; water; air; fire; and nev. <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>And others say thus:</p>  
 <p>3. There are five elements: earth, which is calas; fluidity, which is water and freshness; air, and hence all breathing, every voice and speech; fire, and hence all heat and light; and nwyvre, whence proceed all life, intelligence, knowledge, and power from will and desire.</p>  
 <p>Another of a similar kind:--</p>  
 <p>4. The three materials of every thing: earth; water; and nwyvre. Others say: earth; water; and nev. Others say: calas; fluidity; and nwyvre.</p>  
 <p>Another of the same kind:</p>  
 <p>5. There are five particular elements: calas; fluidity; firmament; uvel; and nwyvre.</p>

 <p>Another:--</p>  
 <p>6. There are three elements of matter, of original kind and condition: calas, from which comes all corporeity that has form and measure; fluidity, from which comes all progress capable of rest and motion; and nwyvre, whence all life and understanding.</p>  
 <p>It is as follows in another Book, according to other teachers:--</p>  
 <p>7. There are five elements, namely:, earth; water; air; fire; and nev; and it is in nev that God exists, as well as every soul, which is also from Him.</p>  
 <p>Others say thus:--</p>  
 <p>8. The five concurrences of every thing: earth; water; air; fire; and soul, the soul being God, from Whom proceeds all life; in the earth are the body and form; in the water is the conjunction; in the air are the breath and motion; in the fire is the feeling, that is, the corporal senses; in the soul are the life, and the senses of perception, namely, understanding, sciences, awen, reason, and affection. And in these five all things concur and have their origin.</p>
