 <p>At length here is an account of symbols and speech, namely, letters and signs, according to their preservation by means of the memory, voice, and usages of the Chair and Gorsedd of the Bards of Glamorgan and Gwent in Tir Iarll, <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">1</font></a> and previously at Caerleon-upon-Usk, since the first arrival of the Cymry in this island. They say that three privileged arts were introduced by the Cymry tinder the protection and guidance of Hu the Mighty <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">2</font></a> into this island; namely, Bardism, Literature, and Agriculture; that is, they were brought from Asia, as it is now called. Deffrobani, <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">3</font></a> however, or the Summer Country, was the first name of the primitive country of the nation of the Cymry, in which country were large and rich kingdoms without number. An usurping nation drove the Cymry out of their country into countries where for upwards of two hundred years they were roving from land to land under the oppression of devastative and predatory nations, until at last they landed in Scandinavia and the highlands of Italy, and the region of Gaul. It was from Scandinavia that they first came into the island [of Britain,] having landed at the river Humber. <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">4</font></a> After that other clans of Cymry came from the land of Gaul into this island, landing at the fords of Pwyth Meinlas, <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">5</font></a> but the usurping nation of the Coranians <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">6</font></a> drove</p>

 <p>them to the South, whilst the Irish Picts drove the Cymry of the land of Deivr and Bernicia, who were derived from the Cymry of Scandinavia, to Venedotia; after that, the Irish of Ireland oppressed them in Mona and Arvon. Ten from the beginning was the number of the symbols of the Coelbren, and they were called Abcedilroes and Abcedilros, as they are called at present, that is, <a name="img_08500"></a>

Subsequently, in the time of Prydain [son of ] Aedd the Great, others were added until they were sixteen symbols, and they continued of that number until the coming of Christ in the flesh; then eighteen, and after that twenty, or, as others say, twenty-one symbols primarily as at present, whilst others were invented as auxiliaries, in number as far as thirty-eight.</p>

It was still called there the Chair of Caerleon. In the time of the contests between Rhys, son of Tewdwr, and Iestyn, son of Gwrgant, the Chair was disturbed, until the time of William, earl of Gloucester, who renewed it in Tir Iarll, (the earl's land,) for such, after his appellation, was the new name bestowed upon the Comot of Maes Mawr, and gave privilege and license to Bards."--Anthony Powell.</p>

(Tr. 15; ib.) They were evidently the same as the Coritani.</p>
