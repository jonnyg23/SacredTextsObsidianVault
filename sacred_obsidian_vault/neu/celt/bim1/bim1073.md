 <p>Another mode for booking sciences were the Peithynvain, <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">1</font></a> that is, they wrote with a steel pencil on both surfaces of the stones, and then put them on a strong cord, or on an iron or brass rod, which passed through the top of every Peithynvaen. These stones were called Coelvain. Another method was that of Howel the Good, devised by Blegywryd, his Clerk, <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">2</font></a> which was this;--they faced the hall of the Prince's court with stones, one side and another of the hall, and on the stones wrote in order, with a strong pencil, the laws which Howel imposed upon the country and nation of the Cymry, an open entrance being left for every man that needed, whatever man he might be, whether a native or a stranger, to proceed into the hall, and to read the law, or to have it read to him.

 <p>a vocal song, a Roll, a poem, the memorial of praiseworthy deeds, and the narration of wisdom, on Peithynvain, and to place them on the face of walls and partitions, or on strings, or iron rods. It was from this also that the practice arose of giving the name of Coelvain to all sciences, of whatsoever kind they were, and to whatsoever things that were inscribed thereon.</p>  
 <p>King Arthur placed the system of the Round Table, and the praiseworthy deeds of its knights, on plates of brass and tin, in his three principal courts, namely, Caerleon-upon-Usk, Celliwig, <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Penrhyn Rhionydd, <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">2</font></a> written with a steel pencil.</p>
