 <p>The five Ages of Letters. The first was the age of the three letters, which above all represented the Name of God and goodness, and which were a sign of goodness and truth, and understanding and equity, of whatsoever kind they might be. Other things were exhibited under the sign of blazonry in respect of the art of a herald-bard. This is the mode in which they numbered ten according to the three letters, namely, <a name="img_09500"></a>
 <img src="img/09500.jpg">, <a name="img_09501"></a>
 <img src="img/09501.jpg"> being put for ten, and after that <a name="img_09502"></a>
 <img src="img/09502.jpg"> for the second tenth, that is, a hundred, and <a name="img_09503"></a>
 <img src="img/09503.jpg"> for the third tenth, that is, a thousand, and <a name="img_09504"></a>
 <img src="img/09504.jpg"> for the fourth tenth, that is, a myriad, and for a million <a name="img_09505"></a>
 <img src="img/09505.jpg">, and for buna <a name="img_09506"></a>
 <img src="img/09506.jpg">, and so on to three <a name="img_09507"></a>
 <img src="img/09507.jpg">, or four or more. According to this arrangement <a name="img_09508"></a>
 <img src="img/09508.jpg"> stood for A, that is, the first letter, <a name="img_09509"></a>
 <img src="img/09509.jpg"> for B, that is, the second, <a name="img_09510"></a>
 <img src="img/09510.jpg">, the third, <a name="img_09511"></a>
 <img src="img/09511.jpg">, the fourth, <a name="img_09512"></a>
 <img src="img/09512.jpg">, <a name="img_09513"></a>
 <img src="img/09513.jpg">, <a name="img_09514"></a>
 <img src="img/09514.jpg">, <a name="img_09515"></a>
 <img src="img/09515.jpg">, <a name="img_09516"></a>
 <img src="img/09516.jpg">, and <a name="img_09517"></a>
 <img src="img/09517.jpg">, the tenth letter, <a name="img_09518"></a>
 <img src="img/09518.jpg">, <a name="img_09519"></a>
 <img src="img/09519.jpg"> the twelfth. This is the first age.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>In the second age sixteen letters were arranged, whence literature became more clear. After that, In the third age there were eighteen letters, for the improvement of literature; that is, <a name="img_09520"></a>

 <p>sound of B; and then the three letters of God's Name were made into <a name="img_09700"></a>
 <img src="img/09700.jpg">; and the eighteenth letter was <a name="img_09701"></a>
 <img src="img/09701.jpg">, or, according to another form, <a name="img_09702"></a>
 <img src="img/09702.jpg">.</p>  
 <p>In the fourth age there were twenty-four letters; and the Name of God, according to the arrangement of the third age, was a secret.</p>
