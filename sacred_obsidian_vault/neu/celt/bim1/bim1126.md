 <p>1. There are three Gorsedd cries: the cry of greeting; the cry of claim; and the cry of efficiency.</p>  
 <p>2. There are three authoritative cries: the cry of country and nation to begin; cry relative to a pledge, in right of claim; and cry for a recurrency, in virtue of obligation.</p>  
 <p>3. There are three unities: one God, that is, the one primary element, from Whom proceeds every living and existing thing; one truth, from which proceed every knowledge and mental intelligence; and one point of liberty, from which proceed every strength and operation.</p>  
 <p>4. Three things incapable of change: the laws of nature; the quality of truth; and the laws of Bardism; for whatever is found to be beautiful, good, and just, belongs to each one of those things.</p>  
 <p>5. According to the three principal dispositions of man will be his migration in Abred: from slothfulness and mental blindness he will fall to Annwn; from his dissolute wantonness he will traverse the circle of Abred, according to the necessity laid upon him; and from his love of goodness he will ascend to the circle of Gwynvyd. According as</p>

 <p>one or other of the three principal dispositions prevails, will be the state of man; hence his three states, Annwn, Abred, and Gwynvyd.</p>  
 <p>6. The three states of living beings: Annwn, where there is a beginning; Abred, where knowledge is accumulated, and hence goodness; and Gwynvyd, where is the fulness of every goodness, of knowledge, truth, love, and endless life.</p>  
 <p>7. The three necessities of man in Abred: natural goodness, and hence intelligence, reason, and sciences; vigour, and hence love, hatred, fear, hope, awen, sorrow, and joy--and from the union of vigour and goodness proceed mercy, generosity, love, and courage; inherent blindness, and hence all hatred, ignorance, anger, pride, and covetousness; and where the two first do not predominate over the third, man will fall in Abred when he dies, and parts with life in this world.</p>  
 <p>8. The three necessities of man in Gwynvyd: godliness; love; and light; and from the three proceed all power, all knowledge, and all everlasting joy, and hence all goodness without cessation, without end.</p>  
 <p>9. There are three primary elements: corporeity; fluidity and air.</p>
