 <p>1. The three stabilities of unity, namely: completeness, for there can be no two kinds of one universality; infinity, for there can be no limit to one entirety; and immutability, for it cannot be that one completeness, universality, and entirety, should be other than they are. Therefore, there can be no God but from fundamental oneness. <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Three things united will produce power: I, Thou, and It; that is to say, the I willing, the Thou performing what the I wills, and the It becoming what is decided by the I, willing in union with the Thou. And they are called the three fundamentals, because from them in one are produced might and existence.</p>  
 <p>3. There are three judgments of duty, in which it will be understood; what a man forbids in another; what he seeks from another; and what is compatible with the circle of Gwynvyd.</p>

 <p>4. Three victories will cause an escape: over uncharitableness; over coveteousness; and over disorder; for these will not accord with the circle of Gwynvyd.</p>  
 <p>5. The three principal co-existences of the circle of Gwynvyd: love as far as its necessity requires; order until it cannot be improved; and knowledge as far as it can be conceived and comprehended.</p>  
 <p>6. There are three things that cannot take place in the circle of Gwynvyd: death; uncharitableness; and disorder.</p>
