 <p><a name="fn_330"></a><a href="bim1124.htm#fr_332">365:1</a> <a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="green">p. 364</font></a> It is not quite clear whether "Bardd Prydain," means here the Bard of Britain, that is, the Isle of Britain, or the Bard of Prydain, the son of Aedd the Great. Among the Gwyddoniaid, which was the name by which the priests and public teachers were known previous to the reformation of Bardism under Prydain, we meet with a son of Peredur Wrawn; and if this Gwrawn was the same as Gwron, one of "the three primary Bards of the Isle of Britain," Peredur, in point of time at least, might well be called the Bard of Prydain. There were two others of the same name, who lived some time after the Christian era; Peredur, the son of Eliver Gosgorddvawr, who lived about the close of the fifth century, and Peredur, the son of Evrawg, a chieftain who flourished in the early part of the sixth century, and is mentioned by Aneurin as having fallen in the battle of Cattraeth. Neither of these, however, is represented as of the Bardic order. We may remark here, that, whenever the island of Britain is mentioned in old documents, <a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="green">p. 365</font></a> it is almost invariably described as Ynys Prydain, a circumstance which gives force to the supposition that Peredur, in the heading of the above Prediction, was meant for the Bard of the son of Aedd the Great.</p>
