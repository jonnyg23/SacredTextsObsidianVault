 <p>1. Keep thy eyes upon God, worship Him, and do no dishonour to Him in His presence.</p>  
 <p>2. Justice and love, with peace and truth, are the materials of immortal life.</p>  
 <p>3. Avoid adultery and the violation of marriage.</p>  
 <p>4. Commit no <a href="errata.htm#2">depredation</a> and pillage.</p>  
 <p>5. There is nothing just for any one, except what will suffice him in the face of death.</p>  
 <p>6. Impart the knowledge of God to all, and the instruction of man to such as will receive it.</p>  
 <p>7. Insert ........ <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">*</font></a> and the order of time in the memorials of theological sciences.</p>  
 <p>8. Do thy best, to the extent of reason and power, and leave the impossible excess to God, and His will.</p>  
 <p>9. Give of thy wealth and property an oblation to God and his poor, that thou mayest not be accursed, and that thou mayest not pine away; for God will have his own.</p>  
 <p>10. There is nothing which has not been made by God; there is nothing which does not belong to God, and not to another. Leave to God what He wills.</p>  
 <p>And thus end the Ten Commandments of St Paul, which he received from the mouth of Jesus Christ, the Son of grace.</p>
