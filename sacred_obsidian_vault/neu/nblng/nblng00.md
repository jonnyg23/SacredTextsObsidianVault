 <h1 align="CENTER">The Nibelungenlied</h1>
 <h4 align="CENTER">Author Unknown</h4>
 <p>Originally written in Middle High German (M.H.G.), sometime around 1200 A.D., although this dating is by no means certain. Author unknown.</p>
 <p>The text of this edition is based on that published as "The Nibelungenlied", translated by Daniel B. Shumway (Houghton-Mifflin Co., New York, 1909). This edition is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN in the United States.</p>
 <p>This electronic edition was edited, proofed, and prepared by Douglas B. Killings</p>
 <p align="CENTER">PREPARER'S NOTE:</p>
 <p>In order to make this electronic edition easier to use, the preparer has found it necessary to re-arrange the endnotes of Mr. Shumway's edition, collating them with the chapters themselves and substituting page references with footnote references. The preparer takes full responsibility for these changes.--DBK.</p>
