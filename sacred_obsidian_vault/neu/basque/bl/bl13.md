 <h3 align="CENTER">VARIATION OF 'THE GRATEFUL TARTARO AND THE HEREN-SUGE'</h3>
 <p>In a variation of the above tale, from the narration of Marino Amyot, of St. Jean Pied de Port, the young prince, as a herdsman, kills with a hammer successively three Tartaros who play at cards with him; he then finds in their house all their riches and horses, barrels full of gold and silver, etc., and also three "<i>olano</i>," which is described as an animal who serves the Tartaro, like a dog, but much larger and more terrible, but also more intelligent and able to do any message. He kills the serpent with the aid of the "<i>olanos</i>," and the princess helps by striking the serpent's tail with a sword, <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">1</font></a> instead of sprinkling the "sweet-scented water." The "<i>olano</i>" then steals dishes off the king's table for the prince. The charcoal-burner comes; but at last the prince shows the tongues and pieces of dress, and ill ends happily, except for the charcoal-burner, who is placed on the top of seven barrels of powder, and fire is applied beneath, and then nobody sees him any more.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_28"></a><a href="bl13.htm#fr_28">32:1</a> One of those present here interrupted the reciter--"What did she hit the serpent on the <i>tail</i> for?" "Why, to kill him, of course," was the reply; "ask Mr. Webster if serpents are not killed by hitting them on the tail?"</p>
