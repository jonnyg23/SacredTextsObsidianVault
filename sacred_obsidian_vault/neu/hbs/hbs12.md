 <h2 align="center">THE BATTLE OF KÓSOVO</h2>
 
 A <small>GRAY</small> hawk from Jerusalem, with a swallow in his beak,<br>
 
 Flew onward into Servia, Tsar Lazarus to seek,<br>
 
 Nay, it was never a great gray hawk with a swallow that flew so far,<br>
 
 But Elijah, our Lady’s messenger, with her tidings to the tsar.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Tsar Lazar read the letter: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“O king whom the Serbs revere,</td></tr></table>
 
 Wilt thou choose for thine own the Kingdom of God or an earthly empire here?<br>
 
 For if, instead of a heavenly rule, thou choosest an earthly realm,<br>
 
 Leap astride of the steed this tide and do on hauberk and helm;<br>
 
 Belt about thee the girdle of war and look to saber and dirk,<br>
 
 Tighten at need the girth of the steed—and here shalt thou slaughter the Turk.<br>
 
 But if thou choosest the Empire of Christ, and a kingdom of God’s own,<br>
 
 Build him a church by Kósovo, but not of marble stone;<br>
 
 But found it on silk and satin and its corners in scarlet fine.<br>
 
 Therein shall thine armies take of Christ the white bread and the wine.<br>
 
 Thou shalt marshal the army of the Serbs, and upon that dreadful day<br>

 In the van of the war thou shalt die, O tsar, with the whole of thine array.”<br>
 
  When the tsar heard the holy word, his thoughts came two and two:<br>
 
  “Dear God, what is the whole of thine heart, and what is the deed to do?<br>
 
 Which shall I hold for the better realm? Man’s sovereignty may die,<br>
 
 But the Kingdom of the Living God, its power goes on for aye.”<br>
 
  Tsar Lazarus has chosen at last God’s Kingdom for his own;<br>
 
 And he built a church at Kósovo, but not of marble stone;<br>
 
 On satin and on velvet he made the walls to stand,<br>
 
 And he summoned our lord the patriarch, and bishops twelve to hand.<br>
 
 The armies came before him, what time the prayers were said,<br>
 
 And the good priests gave to them Christ’s wine and milk-white bread.<br>
 
  And when on level Kósovo that army up was drawn,<br>
 
 The Turks smote against Kósovo at the breaking of the dawn.<br>
 
 Yug Bogdan with the vanguard came up against their line;<br>
 
 The young gray hawks were with him, his gallant children nine;<br>
 
 And after every standard came thrice three thousand men,<br>

 But by Yug Bogdan’s banner were thousands two and ten.<br>
 
 They came upon the infidel, that army of renown,<br>
 
 And slashed and slew among them; seven pashas smote they down.<br>
 
 The eighth gave way before them; Yug Bogdan there was slain;<br>
 
 His nine gray falcons and their host came never home again.<br>
 
  The children of Marnyáva moved on with their array;<br>
 
 Vukáshin, Goyko, Úglyesha were marshals of the fray;<br>
 
 And the ninth Turkish pasha before their charge fell back,<br>
 
 But Úglyesha and Goyko were slain in the attack,<br>
 
 Two of Marnyáva’s children; and terribly, indeed,<br>
 
 Was King Vukáshin wounded, and trampled by the steed.<br>
 
  Now smitten was the center and smitten was the van,<br>
 
 And Ertseg Stepan with the rear into the battle ran.<br>
 
 Brave warriors had Ertseg, full sixty thousand men;<br>
 
 They trampled through the tumult and smote the Turks again.<br>
 
 Nine pashas fell before them, the tenth drew back in dread;<br>
 
 But Ertseg and his army were numbered with the dead.<br>

  And now rode out Tsar Lazarus with his whole host along,<br>
 
 Seventy thousand gallant Serbs and seven thousand strong.<br>
 
 They scattered the Turks by Kósovo; they scarce would let them stand<br>
 
 To look upon the army for the lifting of the brand.<br>
 
 Then would the tsar have won the war for Servia by God’s aid—<br>
 
 God’s curse be on Vuk Bránkovich, the dastard that betrayed<br>
 
 The father of his wife that tide!—the tsar of all the land!<br>
 
 The Turks smote down Tsar Lazarus with the edges of the brand.<br>
 
 Seven and seventy thousand men lay dead upon the sod,<br>
 
 All gallant Serbs, and their pure blood was dear unto their God.<br>
