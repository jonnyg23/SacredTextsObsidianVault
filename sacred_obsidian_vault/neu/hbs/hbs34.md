 <h2 align="center">HOW STARÍNA NOVAK BECAME A HAYDUK</h2>
 
 N<small>OVAK</small> and Rado drank the wine near Bosna the river cold,<br>
 
 With Bógosav. When they had drunk as much as they could hold,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Prince Bogosav began to speak: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Starína Novak,” said he,</td></tr></table>
 
 “My brother sworn, now speak the truth, so may God prosper thee!<br>
 
 Why didst thou join the outlaws? What constraint on thee was laid<br>
 
 To go to the wood to break thy neck, and to ply a wretched trade?<br>
 
 And in thine age, moreover, when thy season was past and sped?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Starína Novak spake to him: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Prince Bógosav,” he said,</td></tr></table>
 
 “My brother sworn, since thou askest me, I will even tell thee the truth;<br>
 
 But it was through a hard constraint that I fled, in very sooth.<br>
 
 Thou mayst remember, when Yérina did Sméderevo rear,<br>
 
 She made me a day laborer. I labored there three year.<br>
 
 Wood and stone did I haul for her with my oxen and my wain,<br>
 
 <p>

 And in the space of full three years not a penny did I gain;<br>
 
 Not even bark sandals for my feet could I win my labor by.<br>
 
 And that I should have pardoned her. When the town was builded high,<br>
 
 She would build towers and gild the doors and windows of the hold.<br>
 
 Each house in the vilayet she taxed three measures of gold,<br>
 
 That is three hundred ducats. Who gave, in the place might live;<br>
 
 But I was poverty-stricken, and had no gold to give.<br>
 
 With the mattock, wherewith I had labored, to the outlaws I fled amain.<br>
 
 I could not stay where Yérina, the accursèd one, did reign,<br>
 
 But ran to the cold Drina, and to rocky Bosnia fled.<br>
 
 When I came near Romániya, there Turkish wooers led<br>
 
 A Turkish damsel homeward. In peace they passed by me.<br>
 
 There remained the Turkish bridegroom; on a great brown steed was he.<br>
 
 In peace that Turkish bridegroom he would not let me pass,<br>
 
 But forth he drew a triple whip with three knobs of yellow brass.<br>
 
 Thrice he smote me on the shoulders. Thrice I prayed him in God’s name:<br>

  “ ‘I pray thee, Turkish bridegroom, mayst thou have courage and fame!<br>
 
 Mayst thou have a happy marriage, but pass me by in peace!<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Thou seest how poor a man am I.’ </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“But the bridegroom would not cease;</td></tr></table>
 
 But rather in his anger began to smite the more.<br>
 
 Then at last was I angry, for my shoulders were waxen sore.<br>
 
 With the mattock on my shoulder, the bridegroom did I smite<br>
 
 With one blow from the brown steed’s back, though the stroke was passing light.<br>
 
 And then I leaped upon him, and smote him where he lay,<br>
 
 Twice or thrice, till his spirit from the body fled away.<br>
 
 I reached my hand in his pockets, and there found purses three;<br>
 
 I put them in my bosom, and girt his saber on me.<br>
 
 I left the mattock at his head that the Turks might have withal<br>
 
 Something to bury him with; the steed I mounted, brown and tall.<br>
 
 To the wood of Romániya I went; the wooers saw me there;<br>
 
 But wished not to pursue me, or haply did not dare.<br>
 
  “It is forly year. The forest is better known to me<br>

 Than the house of my habitation was ever wont to be.<br>
 
 The roads across the mountains I watch them and I hold.<br>
 
 From the youths of Sárayevo I take their silver and gold,<br>
 
 And their linen and velvet for me and mine; and I can go abroad<br>
 
 And stand in the place of danger, for I fear none but God.”<br>
