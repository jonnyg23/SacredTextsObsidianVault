 <h2 align="center">THE DEATH OF THE MOTHER OF THE YÚGOVICHI</h2>
 
 D<small>EAR</small> God, a mighty marvel is fallen at Kósovo!<br>
 
 In the host were Yug’s nine children and their father the tenth also.<br>
 
 The mother of Yug’s children she prayed God in her pain<br>
 
 For the eyes of a hawk and a swan’s white wing to fly along the plain,<br>
 
 To see her nine strong children and Yug her lord beside.<br>
 
 And what she prayed for, verily, God granted her that tide.<br>
 
 God gave her eagle eyesight and the swan’s pinion white,<br>
 
 And she found low in Kósovo her children slain in fight,<br>
 
 And old Yug Bogdan with them, and beside them nine good spears,<br>
 
 And on the goodly spearshafts there perched nine falcons fierce;<br>
 
 Roaming about the lances the chargers nine did stray;<br>
 
 Amid them were nine lions. And the steeds began to neigh,<br>
 
 And the lions roared together, and the falcons screamed aloud;<br>
 
 But the proud heart of the mother I wot it was unbowed.<br>
 
  But the lions and the horses she took them by the brows,<br>

 And the good falcons with them, and brought them to the house.<br>
 
 The wives of her strong children afar they saw her come,<br>
 
 And calling like to cuckoos went out to lead her home.<br>
 
 Moaning before the neighing steeds and the loud beasts thereby<br>
 
 Wept the nine noble ladies, and the hawks took up their cry.<br>
 
 Yet wept not that stern mother, and her heart was undismayed,<br>
 
  About the middle of the night the steed of Damyan neighed.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Then spake the mother to Damyan’s wife: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My daughter, what is this?</td></tr></table>
 
 And wherefore neighs in the nighttide that dappled steed of his?<br>
 
 Is he hungry for the milk-white wheat? Doth he thirst for Zvechan’s wave?”<br>
 
  And the fair wife of Damyan in this wise answer gave:<br>
 
  “My mother, Damyan’s mother, no wheat the steed doth crave,<br>
 
 Nor in the darkened nighttime doth he thirst for Zvechan’s wave;<br>
 
 But aye hath Damyan taught him, and bidden him abide<br>
 
 To champ his oats till midnight, thereafter forth to ride.<br>

 Now he sorrows that his master mounts not his back this tide.”<br>
 
  Yet wept not that stern mother, and her heart was undismayed.<br>
 
  That morn flew by two ravens, unto the shoulders red,<br>
 
 Upon the blackness of their beaks the milk-white froth it shone;<br>
 
 And they bare the hand of a hero and a golden ring thereon.<br>
 
 In the bosom of the mother, the dead hand they let fall;<br>
 
 And unto her daughter, Damyan’s wife, in a loud voice did she call:<br>
 
 “My daughter, wife of Damyan, what hero’s hand is this?”<br>
 
 And the daughter made her answer: “Our Damyan’s hand it is;<br>
 
 Shall I not know the ring I gave the day that we were wed?”<br>
 
  The mother lifted the hero’s hand, and fondled it, and said:<br>
 
  “O hand, who plucked thee off, and where apple-like didst thou grow?<br>
 
 Thou grewest in my bosom; thou wast plucked in Kósovo.”<br>
 
  Then swelled her heart within her, and her soul was rent in twain<br>
 
 For her children and their father that at Kósovo were slain.<br>
