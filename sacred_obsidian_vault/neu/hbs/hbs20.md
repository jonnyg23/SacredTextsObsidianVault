 <h2 align="center">UROSH AND THE SONS OF MARNYÁVA</h2>
 
 I<small>N</small> the fair field of Kósovo were four pavilions pight<br>
 
 By the fair church of Kósovo, Samódrezha the white.<br>
 
 Vukáshin lay in one fair tent, and Lord Úglyesha was nigh;<br>
 
 Goyko the duke and Urosh, the tsar’s son, lay thereby.<br>
 
 The tsars rob one another of the empire of the tsars,<br>
 
 And they yearn to slay each other with the gilded scimitars.<br>
 
 They know not whose is the empire. “It is mine,” Vukáshin saith,<br>
 
 But the great Lord Úglyesha answers: “It is mine, upon my faith.”<br>
 
 And Goyko, the proud voývoda, saith likewise: “It is mine”;<br>
 
 But the son of the tsar, Prince Urosh, in silence must he pine,<br>
 
 For he dares not break his silence before those angry ones,<br>
 
 Before the three great brothers, Marnyáva’s mighty sons.<br>
 
  Vukáshin writeth a letter, and a herald doth he send,<br>
 
 To Nédelko, the archpriest, in the city of Prizrend;<br>
 
 And he bids him come to Kósovo, that he may there decide<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 To whom of the four princes the realm belongs, this tide;<br>
 
 For he had given the sacrament unto the glorious tsar,<br>
 
 And shriven him; and the ancient books, with the archpriest they are.<br>
 
 Úglyesha writeth a letter and a herald doth he send<br>
 
 To Nédelko, the archpriest, in the city of Prizrend;<br>
 
 And Goyko, the great voývoda, he writeth yet a third,<br>
 
 And sendeth a fiery messenger to the archpriest with his word;<br>
 
 And the son of the tsar, Prince Urosh, sent a letter likewise away.<br>
 
 In secret the fiery heralds went with their letters on that day.<br>
 
 By the house of the Archpriest Nédelko, in Prizrend, the white town,<br>
 
 The heralds met, but the archpriest out of his house was gone,<br>
 
 For he sat at the service in the midst of matin song.<br>
 
 So fierce were those fierce heralds, so keen the strong of the strong,<br>
 
 That they came not down from the chargers, but through the door did dash,<br>
 
 And the good Archpriest Nédelko they smote with the woven lash:<br>
 
  “Come swift, thou priest, to Kósovo, that there thou mayst decide<br>
 
 To whom of the four princes the realm belongs, this tide;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 113------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 For thou didst give the sacrament unto the glorious tsar,<br>
 
 And shrovest him, and the ancient books of learning with thee they are.<br>
 
 If thou comest not to Kósovo, forthwith thou shalt lose thy head.”<br>
 
  Then wept the Archpriest Nédelko, and unto them he said:<br>
 
  “Till we are done with the service, get hence, ye strong of the strong,<br>
 
 And it will be shown hereafter to whom doth the realm belong.”<br>
 
  Out rode the heralds straightway. When the liturgy was done,<br>
 
 Forth came the Archpriest Nédelko, and spake to all and one:<br>
 
  “With me the tsar took sacrament, to me he did confess;<br>
 
 But I asked not of his kingdom, but of his wickedness.<br>
 
 But to the house of Marko in the town of Prilip hie,<br>
 
 For Marko was my pupil to read in charactery;<br>
 
 And the good Marko Krályevich was a scribe before the tsar,<br>
 
 And the books of yore with their ancient lore, this day with him they are;<br>
 
 And who shall have the kingdom, Prince Marko shall make known.<br>
 
 He speaketh the truth, for he feareth none save the true God alone.”<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
  To Prilip, to Prince Marko’s house, went on the heralds four;<br>
 
 They came unto the milk-white house, and smote with the ring on the door.<br>
 
 And Yévrosima heard it and called unto her son:<br>
 
 “Do thy father’s heralds at the door with the ring strike thereon?”<br>
 
  Marko arose and opened the door. They bowed where they did stand:<br>
 
 “God bless thee, Marko!” But Marko, he stroked them with his hand:<br>
 
 “Now welcome, sons! With the champions and the tsars are all things well?”<br>
 
 But thereupon the heralds down on their knees they fell:<br>
 
  “The lords are well, Prince Marko, but they are not at peace this night;<br>
 
 In Kósovo they quarrel, by Samódrezha the white;<br>
 
 The tsars rob one another of the empire of the tsars,<br>
 
 And they yearn to slay each other with the gilded scimitars;<br>
 
 But to whom the realm belongeth, no man of them doth know,<br>
 
 Wherefore they cite thee to tell them on the field of Kósovo.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Prince Marko went into the house: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My mother of delight,</td></tr></table>
 
 In Kósovo they quarrel, by Samódrezha the white;<br>
 
 The tsars rob one another of the empire of the tsars,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 115------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And they yearn to slay each other with the gilded scimitars;<br>
 
 But to whom the realm belongeth, no man of them doth know.<br>
 
 Therefore they cite me to tell them on the field of Kósovo.”<br>
 
  Though greatly Marko loved the truth, she conjured him the more:<br>
 
  “Let not my rearing be accurst in thee, the son I bore,<br>
 
 For thy father or his brethren speak not false, whate’er the stress,<br>
 
 But according to the living God speak out his righteousness.<br>
 
 Hurl not the spirit, Marko; save thou the soul, my son.<br>
 
 Rather lose life than that the soul should have a stain thereon.”<br>
 
  Marko brought forth the ancient books, and mounted Dapple the gray;<br>
 
 On Dapple’s back he rode the track to Kósovo that day.<br>
 
 And when he came to the king’s tent Vukáshin stood thereby:<br>
 
  “Here is my good son Marko, and fortunate am I!<br>
 
 For he will say, I trow, this day, the realm of the tsars is mine.<br>
 
 Then from the father to the son shall the realm stand in our line.”<br>
 
  Marko heard, but said naught; from the tent he turned away.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 116------------------------>

 </p>
 
 Voývoda Úglyesha saw him, and aloud his thought did he say:<br>
 
  “Here is my nephew Marko, and a lucky man am I!<br>
 
 For I trow he will say to me this day that mine is the empery.<br>
 
 Say, Marko, that the realm is mine. We will share the government.”<br>
 
  But Marko the Prince said nothing, nor turned unto the tent.<br>
 
 Goyko, the voývoda, saw him, what time he went thereby:<br>
 
  “Here is my nephew Marko, and a lucky man am I!<br>
 
 He will say that unto me, Goyko, the empire doth belong,<br>
 
 Because I erstwhile loved him, when he was weak and young.<br>
 
 For I loved him very dearly, and in the bosom fold<br>
 
 Of my mantle did I keep him like an apple of red gold;<br>
 
 Where’er I went upon my steed was Marko wont to ride.<br>
 
 Say then, Prince Marko, in this wise, what time thou shalt decide,<br>
 
 That all the empire of the tsars is given unto me,<br>
 
 And thou shalt be the overlord, and I the tsar at thy knee.”<br>
 
  But Marko aye kept silence, and turned not to the tent.<br>
 
 To Urosh’ white pavilion upon his way he went;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 117------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Unto the tsar’s fair tent he rode. Urosh leaped up awake<br>
 
 From the fair silken cushions, and to the prince he spake:<br>
 
  “A lucky man am I to-day; my godfather I see!<br>
 
 Marko the Prince will say to whom the Servian realms shall be.”<br>
 
  Then they embraced each other, and wished each other well;<br>
 
 And sate upon the cushions until the evening fell.<br>
 
 When the dark night was over, and the white morning shone,<br>
 
 They rang the bells for matins, and to church the lords are gone.<br>
 
 They came forth from the service before the church to dine,<br>
 
 And then they ate the sugar, and drank the brandy-wine.<br>
 
 Marko looks on the ancient books, and a great word saith he:<br>
 
  “O thou, my sire, Vukáshin, is thy realm too small for thee?<br>
 
 May a curse go out and through it, for ye seize another’s reign!<br>
 
 And Úglyesha, my uncle, too small is thy domain?<br>
 
 May a curse go out and through it, for another’s realm would ye seize!<br>
 
 And thou, my uncle, Goyko, to a strait are thy provinces?<br>
 
 May a curse go out and through them, for an other’s realm would ye steal!<br>
 
 <p>

 <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 See—and may God forget you!—what the book doth reveal!<br>
 
 For the realm belongeth to Urosh, from the father to the son;<br>
 
 The child is of the tsar his house, and in him the line goes on,<br>
 
 And the tsar left it to him at the season when he died.”<br>
 
  Vukáshin, when he heard it, drew the dagger from his side;<br>
 
 On his son leaped Vukáshin, to stab him in that hour,<br>
 
 And Marko fled before him, for he had not will nor power<br>
 
 In arms against his father to lift the hand and fight.<br>
 
 Marko ran round about the church, Samodrezha the white;<br>
 
 Three times round white Samodrezha the circle did they make;<br>
 
 The king well-nigh had caught him, when a voice to Marko spake:<br>
 
  “Into the church, Prince Marko!” the voice from the church did say,<br>
 
 “For the sake of truth thou wilt perish at thy father’s hand this day.”<br>
 
  Marko ran hard into the church as the doors wide open drew;<br>
 
 Vukáshin fell against them as again the doors shut to,<br>
 
 And smote the beam with his dagger. Therefrom did the red blood drain.<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 The king repented: “By the one God, I dread my son have I slain.”<br>
 
  A voice spoke to him from the church: “Dost hear where thou dost stand?<br>
 
 Thou smot’st not thy son, but an angel, with the dagger in thy hand.”<br>
 
  The king was wroth at Marko, and cursed him thereupon:<br>
 
  “My son, God slay thee! Mayst thou have nor sepulcher nor son!<br>
 
 May the soul go not from thee till thou servest the Turk in war!”<br>
 
  His father cursed him, but he won the blessing of the tsar:<br>
 
  “O my godfather Marko, may God thee ever shield!<br>
 
 May thy face shine in the council; thy saber slash in the field!<br>
 
 May none excel thee in battle, and thy name far and wide<br>
 
 Be everywhere remembered while the sun and moon abide!”<br>
 
  So spake Vukáshin and the tsar, and so did it betide.<br>
