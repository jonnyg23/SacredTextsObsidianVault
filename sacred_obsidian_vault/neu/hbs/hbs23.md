 <h2 align="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE EAGLE</h2>
 
 M<small>ARKO</small> lay on the tsar’s highway, and green was all his gear.<br>
 
 A silver cloth was on his face; by his head was planted his spear.<br>
 
 By the spear stood Dapple, but on it a great white eagle stayed;<br>
 
 It spread its wings above the prince and gave the hero shade,<br>
 
 And water in its beak it bore, the wounded hero, to slake.<br>
 
 But a vila of the mountain unto the eagle spake:<br>
 
  “In the name of God, white eagle, how hath Marko stood thine aid,<br>
 
 That thou spreadest thy wings above him to give the hero shade,<br>
 
 And bringest water in thy beak, the wounded hero to slake?”<br>
 
  But thereupon the eagle unto the vila spake:<br>
 
  “Be silent, vila, and hold thy tongue. What, good hath come to me,<br>
 
 Hath aye come at Prince Marko’s hands. Keepest thou the memory<br>
 
 Of the day the army perished on the field of Kósovo,<br>
 
 And both tsars, Lazar and Murad, died in the overthrow?<br>
 
 Up to the stirrups of the steed that day the red blood ran,<br>
 
 Unto the silken girdle of many a fighting man;<br>

 Horses and heroes swam, steed by steed, and hero hero by,<br>
 
 And we flew up hungry and thirsty, the vultures of the sky;<br>
 
 We fed on human flesh, we drank our fill of human blood:<br>
 
 My wings were wet. Forth flamed the sun in heaven where he stood:<br>
 
 My wings grew stiff; my feathers in flight I could not wield;<br>
 
 My comrades flew, and I was left upon the level field.<br>
 
 Heroes and steeds rushed onward, and me they trampled o’er.<br>
 
 God sent Marko; he lifted me up from the heroes’ gore<br>
 
 And put me behind on Dapple. To the green wood amain<br>
 
 He bore me and tossed me into a fir; and down the gentle rain<br>
 
 Descended there upon me. My wings were washen clean,<br>
 
 That I might fly thereafter over the forest green;<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And there I met my comrades. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“One more good deed to me</td></tr></table>
 
 Did the good Marko Krályevich. Hast thou in memory<br>
 
 How the town burned at Kósovo? Burnt was Ajága’s tower:<br>
 
 Therein my little eaglets were hidden in that hour,<br>
 
 And Marko gathered all of them in his silken bosom fold,<br>

 And a full month he nourished them in the white house of his hold,<br>
 
 And let them go to the green wood, when a month and a week were told.<br>
 
 And this did Marko for me, that I met my eaglets dear.”<br>
 
  <br>
 
  Prince Marko is remembered like a fair day in the year.<br>
