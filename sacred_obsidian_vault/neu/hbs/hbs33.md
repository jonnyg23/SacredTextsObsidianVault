 <h2 align="center">THE MAIDEN MÁRGITA AND RAYKO THE VOÝVODA<a name="page_187_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_187_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a></h2>
 
 N<small>OT</small> yet the dawn had whitened, nor the day star shown its face;<br>
 
 Men thought not of day—forth Márgita the maid walked in the place,<br>
 
 In Sriyem over Slánkamen;<a name="page_187_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_187_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> barefoot the damsel sprang<br>
 
 Over the stone so early. In delicate wise she sang,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>But Rayko in the song she cursed: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Rayko, may God thee slay!</td></tr></table>
 
 The Turks have plagued us grievously in Sriyem, since the day<br>
 
 When thou becamest voývoda. When Mirko ruled the land,<br>
 
 We heard of no Turk, nor ever saw one before us stand;<br>
 
 But now they plague us grievously. Their horses’ feet are sore<br>
 
 For riding night and morning in our country evermore.<br>
 
 The very fields on their horsehoofs are lifted and stolen away,<br>
 
 And the air is full of javelins and their throwing-darts to-day.”<br>

  So sang the girl of Sriyem, and deemed that none could hear,<br>
 
 But Voývoda Rayko saw her, and the curse came to his ear;<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And he called the maiden Márgita: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Sister,” he saith, “do thou</td></tr></table>
 
 No more curse Rayko the voývoda. What more can he do now?<br>
 
 What may he do for himself? And what for Sriyem in this hour?<br>
 
 What shall he do in Sriyem against the Turkish power?<br>
 
 While Mirko was the voývoda, in our cities in their turn<br>
 
 Were many voývodas. Stay thou; their number thou shalt learn.<br>

 At Pótserye on Sava his dwelling Milosh made.<br>
 
 He was vizier of Lazar in many-towered Belgrade.<br>

 In Krúshevats, the white city, glorious Lazar had his hall,<br>
 
 With his fair son beside him, the good lad Stevan the Tall.<br>
 
 Yug Bogdan, the old hero, with the nine sons of his might,<br>
 
 Dwelt in another city, Prókuplye the white.<br>
 
 At the white town of Kurshúmliya was Strahin, the great ban;<br>
 
 At Tóplitsa, Milan Tóplitsa, where the chill waters ran.<br>

 At Skadar on the Bóyana, Vukáshin was the king.<br>
 
 With his brethren Goyko and Úglyesha, to help in governing.<br>

 With his little son, Prince Urosh, was Stepan the Servian tsar.<br>

 Starína Novak<a name="page_189_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_189_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> held the rule on Stara, the mountain old;<br>

 All of them were among us, and all have passed away.<br>
 
 Some died in their beds, sister, and some in battle were slain;<br>
 
 To-day doth Rayko alone of them in Sriyem yet remain,<br>
 
 Like a dry tree in the mountain grove. What shall he do in this hour?<br>
 
 What shall he do in Sriyem against the Turkish power?”<br>
 
  From his belt he drew a dagger—through his live heart it sped;<br>
 
 On the black earth Rayko of Sriyem, the voývoda, lay dead.<br>
 
 And Márgita ran to him; with a wailing cry she said:<br>
 
  “My brothers, Servian voývodas; you have been and have passed away!<br>
 
 How have you left your children and your faithful wives this day?<br>
 
 Are they not now a footstool, that Turkish feet may rest?<br>
 
 Are not your monasteries become a Turkish jest?”<br>
 
  She snatched the dagger of Rayko, through her live heart smote it well,<br>
 
 And dead the wretched maiden by the dead Rayko fell.<br>
