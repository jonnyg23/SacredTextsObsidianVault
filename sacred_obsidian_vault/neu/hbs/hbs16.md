 <h2 align="center">TSÁRITSA MÍLITSA AND VLÁDETA THE VOÝVODA</h2>
 
 M<small>ÍLITSA</small> the tsáritsa went walking up and down<br>
 
 Below the wall of Krúshevats and the ramp of the white town,<br>
 
 And also Vúkosava and Mara, her daughters dear,<br>
 
 When Vládeta, the voývoda, on a charger brown drew near.<br>
 
 Sweated that steed had been, indeed, and the white foam stained his side.<br>
 
  “God aid thee, marshal of the king!” Queen Mílitsa she cried;<br>
 
 “Why sweats the stallion? Hast thou not come from Kósovo this day?<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Sawest thou not my lord and thine?” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>And Vládeta did say:</td></tr></table>
 
  “God aid me, Tsáritsa Mílitsa! I come from Kósovo.<br>
 
 I saw not the tsar, but his white steed the Turks drove to and fro,<br>
 
 Up and down by Kósovo, and I dread that the tsar is slain.”<br>
 
  When Queen Mílitsa had heard it, on her cheeks the tears did rain,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And anew she asketh the voývoda: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“What tidings of the tsar?</td></tr></table>
 
 Sawest thou Yug’s nine children at Kósovo that are;<br>

 <table><tr><td>And the tenth, Yug Bogdan, their father?” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>And Vládeta replied:</td></tr></table>
 
  “I rode by level Kósovo, and I saw them in that tide—<br>
 
 Yug and his nine strong children at Kósovo have I seen.<br>
 
 Their arms were red to the shoulders, and red were the sabers keen;<br>
 
 Weary were their arms at Kósovo with cutting the Moslems down.”<br>
 
  Yet again unto the voývoda the tsáritsa spake on:<br>
 
 “Sawest thou Milosh and Bránkovich, my daughters’ lords that are?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Vládeta answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“At Kósovo, in the center of the war,</td></tr></table>
 
 There saw I Milosh Óbilich that leaned on his broken spear;<br>
 
 He is dead ere now, for the Moslems pressed on him very near.<br>
 
 Vuk Bránkovich I saw not. Never may sun him see!<br>
 
 That same betrayed Tsar Lazar, the lord of thee and me.”<br>
