 <h2 align="center">SISTER AND BROTHER</h2>
 
 N<small>INE</small> dear sons and a daughter, a mother bore and bred;<br>
 
 She reared them up till they were grown and the sons were ready to wed,<br>
 
 And the maiden ripe for marriage. And straightway asked for her<br>
 
 Three suitors, a ban, and a marshal, and a neighbor villager.<br>
 
 To the neighbor the mother would give her, but her brethren to the man<br>
 
 From over sea would give her. They said to her: “Marry the ban,<br>
 
 The great lord from beyond the sea. In every month of the year<br>
 
 We will come, and every week in the month, to see thee, sister dear.”<br>
 
  The sister obeyed them, and the ban from over sea she wed.<br>
 
 But behold a marvel! God’s pestilence struck her nine brethren dead,<br>
 
 And the solitary mother was left. So passed three years.<br>
 
 In her grief little Yélitsa the sister mourned with tears:<br>
 
  “Dear God, a mighty marvel! What great sin have I done<br>
 
 To my brethren, that of all of them cometh to me not one?”<br>
 
  The wives of her lord’s brethren reviled her sharp enow:<br>

  “O wife of our lords’ brother, a wanton one art thou,<br>
 
 Hateful unto thy brethren now hast thou come to be,<br>
 
 That not one of thy brethren comes here to visit thee.”<br>
 
  And little sister Yélitsa wept much both day and night;<br>
 
 But the dear God, in mercy, took pity on her plight,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And sent forthwith two angels: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Go down, ye angels of mine,</td></tr></table>
 
 To the white tomb of Yovan, the youngest of the nine;<br>
 
 Breathe light upon him with your breath; from the tomb frame him a steed;<br>
 
 From the earth make cakes for the festival all ready to his need;<br>
 
 Of his shroud make gifts, and get him in readiness to appear<br>
 
 Upon his wedding visit at the house of his sister dear.”<br>
 
  To the white tomb of Yovan the angels of God made speed;<br>
 
 They breathed upon him with their breath; from the tomb they framed him a steed,<br>
 
 And cakes from the earth for the festival all ready to his need;<br>
 
 Of his shroud they made gifts, and got him in readiness to appear<br>

 Upon his wedding visit at the house of his sister dear.<br>
 
 Swiftly went Yovan the feeble. When the house before him lay<br>
 
 His sister saw, and to meet him came forth a little way;<br>
 
 And O her tears fell bitter, all for her sorrow’s sake!<br>
 
 They spread their arms, and each other kissed, and sister to brother spake:<br>
 
  “Did ye not promise, brother, when ye gave me in marriage here,<br>
 
 That ye would come to see me every month in the year,<br>
 
 And every week in every month, to visit your sister dear?<br>
 
 But ye never came to see me, though three full years have fled.”<br>
 
  And little Yélitsa further unto her brother said:<br>
 
 “Why hast thou grown so dark, brother? ’Tis as though beneath the sod<br>
 
 Thou hadst been.” Said Yovan the feeble: “Be still, as thou lovest God.<br>
 
 A hard constraint is on me. I have wedded eight brothers well,<br>
 
 And served eight sisters by marriage; and, sister, it befell<br>
 
 That, when my brothers were married, we made nine houses white.<br>
 
 Therefore, my little sister, am I grown as black as night.”<br>

  And little sister Yélitsa got ready. She fashioned then<br>
 
 Gifts for her brethren and sisters; silken shirts for the men<br>
 
 She made, and, for her sisters, fair rings and bracelets fair.<br>
 
 And ever Yovan her brother besought her strongly there:<br>
 
  “Dear little sister Yélitsa, I prithee go not home,<br>
 
 Till on their wedding visit thy brethren to thee come.”<br>
 
  But Yélitsa would not turn back; her fair gifts she prepared.<br>
 
 Thence Yovan started homeward, and his sister with him fared.<br>
 
 When they were come to their home again, a white church stood thereby.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Said Yovan the feeble: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Sister, I prithee tarry nigh,</td></tr></table>
 
 Until I go behind the church; for here at the marrying<br>
 
 Of the fourth of our eight brethren, I lost my golden ring.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Let me go to seek it, sister.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>To his tomb went Yovan straight,</td></tr></table>
 
 And little sister Yélitsa for Yovan there did wait.<br>
 
 She waited and sought him. Nigh the church a fresh grave she espied;<br>

 Suddenly she knew in sorrow that Yovan the weak had died.<br>
 
 Quickly she went to the white house. When she was come to the hall,<br>
 
 In the hollow rooms of the white house she heard a cuckoo call.<br>
 
 Nay, it was not a cuckoo blue, but her mother crying sore.<br>
 
 Yélitsa lifted up her voice as she came unto the door:<br>
 
 “Open the door, poor mother.” Said the mother thereunto:<br>
 
  “Get hence, thou pestilence of God, nine sons of mine that slew!<br>
 
 Their ancient mother, also, wilt thou smite stark and dead?”<br>
 
  And little sister Yélitsa lifted her voice and said:<br>
 
  “Poor mother, open now the door! No pestilence is here;<br>
 
 It is only little Yélitsa, and she is thy daughter dear.”<br>
 
  She opened the door. Each other they clasped their arms around,<br>
 
 Wailing like cuckoos. Mother and child fell dead upon the ground.<br>
