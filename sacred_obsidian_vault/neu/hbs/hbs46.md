 <h2 align="center">THE SERPENT BRIDEGROOM</h2>
 
 I <small>WILL</small> tell you a marvel, brethren, how the King of Budim was wed,<br>
 
 And nine full years passed over, yet there was no child to his bed.<br>
 
 Forth issued King Milútin; he went to the forest-close;<br>
 
 But God and fortune granted him not to strike the stags and does.<br>
 
 And his thirst was great; to a chilly spring Milútin went his way,<br>
 
 And drank the chilly water. Then down ’neath a fir he lay.<br>
 
 Three vilas of the hill came then, thereby their thirst to slake,<br>
 
 And gossip by the water; and the eldest of them spake:<br>
 
  “Harken, belovèd daughters! Harken me now, and hear!<br>
 
 Since the King of Budim married, now is it full nine year;<br>
 
 And yet no child of his heart hath he to cherish and hold dear.”<br>
 
  Said the vila also: “Of any herb doth either of you know,<br>
 
 By the virtue whereof, hereafter, his wife with child shall go?”<br>
 
  But the younger twain said nothing. Only the eldest said:<br>
 
  “If the king knew all my knowledge, he would gather every maid<br>

 In Budim, and before them the dry gold would he set,<br>
 
 Until their hands should have woven thereof a splendid net.<br>
 
 Down on the quiet Danube, he would throw the fair net in.<br>
 
 In it, a great fish would he take; and golden is every fin.<br>
 
 He would take the right fin from it; then back the fish would he throw,<br>
 
 And give the fin to the queen to eat. Straightway with child would she go.”<br>
 
  But King Milútin saw them, and heard whate’er was said;<br>
 
 And he went to the town of Budim and gathered every maid<br>
 
 In Budim, and before them the good dry gold he set,<br>
 
 Until their hands had woven thereof a splendid net.<br>
 
 Down on the quiet Danube he threw the fair net in.<br>
 
 In it he took a mighty fish, and golden was every fin.<br>
 
 He took the right fin from it; and back the fish did he throw;<br>
 
 He gave the fin to his queen to eat. Straightway with child did she go.<br>
 
 A year she carried her burden; and then the time came on<br>
 
 Of the bringing forth of the kingly child, but she did not bear a son.<br>
 
 <p>

 Nay, a fierce serpent was it! On the earth when it did fall,<br>
 
 Straightway the serpent crept away through a crevice in the wall.<br>
 
 And straight the queen departed; unto the king she spake:<br>
 
  “For the child of thy heart, it is hard, O king, to be merry for his sake.<br>
 
 No son but a serpent! What time on the earth the snake did fall,<br>
 
 Forthwith the serpent crept away through a crevice in the wall.”<br>
 
  Then said the king: “Now glory to God for his gift’s sake.”—<br>
 
 Then seven years passed over. From the wall the serpent spake:<br>
 
 “Wherefore, thou King of Budim, findest thou no bride for me?”<br>
 
 Sore was Milútin troubled, but at length aloud said he:<br>
 
 “My serpent, my evil offspring, who will give a maid to a snake?”<br>
 
 But thus to him the serpent raised up his voice and spake:<br>
 
  “My father, the King of Budim, do thou saddle Swallow, and wend<br>
 
 To the tsar. He will give thee a maid for me in the city of Prizrend.”<br>
 
  When the King of Budim heard it, he saddled Swallow, the steed;<br>
 
 There went unto a hero, a hero then indeed!<br>

 He came to the city of Prizrend. When he came ’neath the tsar’s tower,<br>
 
 The tsar looked down upon him, and saw him in that hour.<br>
 
 The tsar came down unto him, and in the open square<br>
 
 The heroes spread out wide their arms, and kissed each other there,<br>
 
 And each asked how fared the other. The tsar the king did lead<br>
 
 To the palace; to the new stable the servants took the steed.<br>
 
 For three white days with yellow wine their thirst the kings did slake,<br>
 
 Till they had ta’en their fill thereof, and then the brandy spake.<br>
 
 Sore was the King of Budim by his embassy distressed.<br>
 
 The Tsar of Prizrend saw it, and thus the king addressed:<br>
 
  “I conjure thee, King of Budim; what trouble troubles thee,<br>
 
 That thou art distressed in spirit before my lords and me?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The king to the tsar spake likewise: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“O tsar of Prizrend, hear!</td></tr></table>
 
 When I married, no son of my heart was born for the space of full nine year.<br>
 
 When that their term was over, and the nine year course was run,<br>
 
 To me was born a serpent instead of a little son;<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 And, at its birth, unto the earth did the fierce serpent fall,<br>
 
 And forthwith the serpent crept away through a crevice in the wall.<br>
 
 When seven years were over, therefrom did the serpent call:<br>
 
 ‘Wherefore, thou King of Budim, dost thou find no bride for me?’<br>
 
 And unto the fierce serpent I answered finally:<br>
 
 ‘My serpent, my evil offspring, who will give a maid to a snake?’<br>
 
 But thereupon the serpent lifted his voice and spake:<br>
 
  “ ‘My father, the King of Budim, do thou saddle Swallow and wend<br>
 
 To the tsar. He will give thee a maid for me in the city of Prizrend.’<br>
 
  “And tsar, a wretch am I in this. But I labored and came from afar.”<br>
 
  And unto the king in answer outspake at last the tsar:<br>
 
  “Hearest thou, King of Budim? To Budim for me thou shalt go.<br>
 
 There shalt thou ask the serpent in the wall, whether or no<br>
 
 He will lead the wooers from Budim to Prizrend through the land,<br>
 
 So that no sun shall warm them, nor dew upon them stand.<br>
 
 If in such wise the serpent will venture them to lead,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 265------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Then for a bride to the serpent I will give the maid indeed.”<br>
 
  When the King of Budim heard it, forth was steed Swallow led.<br>
 
 He threw himself on the back of the steed, and forth away he sped,<br>
 
 Over the level country, like a star in the lucid sky.<br>
 
 And the king thought within him, when Budim he came nigh:<br>
 
  “Alas! In the name of God the One, now whither shall I wend,<br>
 
 To give to the serpent in the wall the greetings the tsar doth send?”<br>
 
  Before the gates of Budim but a little space was he.<br>
 
 Spake the serpent: “My father, gave the tsar his maiden unto me?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Said the king: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My evil offspring, if thou darest, snake, to wend</td></tr></table>
 
 With the crowd of gay-clad wooers from Budim to Prizrend,<br>
 
 So that no sun shall warm them, nor dew upon them stand,<br>
 
 The tsar will lightly surrender the maiden to thy hand.<br>
 
 But if the crowd of wooers thou wilt not venture to lead,<br>
 
 No maiden of his whatever will the tsar give thee indeed.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But the serpent said: </td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td>
 
 <!------------------------page 266------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a>
 
 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“The wooers, now get them ready to hand.</td></tr></table>
 
 We will go hence for the maiden; I will lead them through the land,<br>
 
 So that no sun shall warm them, nor dew upon them stand.”<br>
 
  They gathered a host of wooers, a thousand with all speed;<br>
 
 They came to the king’s courtyard. They brought forth Swallow the steed;<br>
 
 Alone in the courtyard stood the steed. Then the quick heralds cried:<br>
 
 “Make ready, gay-clad wooers! Make ready, groom of the bride!”<br>
 
 And when in the wall’s crevice the serpent heard the call,<br>
 
 Forthwith crawled down the serpent from the crevice in the wall;<br>
 
 By the knee he gripped the charger; on the saddle he coiled and lay.<br>
 
 Then out through Budim the city they hastened on their way.<br>
 
 From Budim to Prizrend a dark blue cloud drave o’er them through the land,<br>
 
 So that no sun could warm them, nor dew upon them stand.<br>
 
 When they came to Prizrend, they led their steeds through the tsar’s courtyard there;<br>
 
 But the serpent guided not Swallow that went alone through the square.<br>
 
 Gloriously the tsar welcomed them with gifts that were splendid indeed,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 267------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 To every wooer a shirt of silk, to the groom a hawk and a steed,<br>
 
 And moreover the maiden of Prizrend. Then the quick heralds cried:<br>
 
  “Make ready, wooers, and groomsman, and bringer of the bride!<br>
 
 Make ready, maiden of Prizrend! It is time for us to ride.”<br>
 
  The wooers and the maiden, they mounted one and all.<br>
 
 When the serpent heard it, down he came from the crevice in the wall;<br>
 
 He gripped the charger by the knee; on the saddle he coiled and lay.<br>
 
 Then out through Prizrend the city they hastened on their way,<br>
 
 But evermore above them drave on the dark blue cloud.<br>
 
 The wooers spurred their horses, until they trampled proud;<br>
 
 And thereupon the serpent on Swallow that did ride,<br>
 
 He made the charger trample on the pavement in his pride.<br>
 
 He goaded him so fiercely, that the steed from end to end<br>
 
 Hath ruined all the pavement in the city of Prizrend.<br>
 
 Plague strike on it! In twelve full years the masons scarce will mend<br>
 
 The damage that upon that time unto the tsar was done.<br>

 And merrily and with good heart to Budim they were gone,<br>
 
 And anew the marriage festival they held a full week more,<br>
 
 And solemnized it duly until the rites were o’er.<br>
 
 Then each returned unto the house, and the serpent to the wall,<br>
 
 And the king remained a season within the council-hall.<br>
 
  Time came to bring together the bridegroom and the bride.<br>
 
 They brought her to the tower; to the highest room they hied;<br>
 
 They left her in the highest room. At the middle of the night<br>
 
 There was a sound of voices in the chamber in the height;<br>
 
 And the Lady Queen in the tower stole on from floor to floor,<br>
 
 Till she reached the highest story; then she opened the chamber door.<br>
 
 What saw she in the chamber? A mighty marvel therein!<br>
 
 On a cushion in the chamber, there lay a serpent-skin;<br>
 
 On the pillow a good hero in slumber deep was laid;<br>
 
 And the damsel out of Prizrend, he held the lovely maid.<br>
 
 A mother has joy of her children. She stole the serpent-skin;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 269------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 She bore it to the living fire, and swiftly threw it in.<br>
 
 To the king, her lord and master, she ran forth hastily:<br>
 
  “O king, upon this hour it is well with thee and me!<br>
 
 I went to the high chamber, and opened the door. Therein<br>
 
 On a cushion in the chamber there lay a serpent-skin;<br>
 
 On the pillow a good hero in slumber deep was laid;<br>
 
 The damsel out of Prizrend, he held the lovely maid.<br>
 
 And forthwith from the chamber I stole the serpent-skin,<br>
 
 And took it to the living fire, and quickly threw it in.”<br>
 
  “What is this, wife? May the serpent now seize thee and devour!”<br>
 
  And they hastened forth together to the summit of the tower.<br>
 
 What saw they? A mighty marvel! On the pillow a hero dead;<br>
 
 The maid of Prizrend embraced him. She lifted her voice and said:<br>
 
 “Alas! In the name of the one God, I am widowed and alone!<br>
 
 My mother, for me—God slay thee!—little enow hast thou done,<br>
 
 And this woe hast thou brought upon thyself.” So the mother lost her son.<br>

 We give you the song, but God on high gives health unto the wise!<br>
 
 Our fathers lied unto us, and we repeat their lies.<br>
