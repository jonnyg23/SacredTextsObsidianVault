 <h2 align="center">THE DEATH OF IVO OF SENYE<a name="page_199_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_199_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a></h2>
 
 Ivo’s mother dreamed that darkness was risen Senye around,<br>
 
 That the clear sky was broken and the bright moon fell to the ground<br>
 
 On Rúzhitsa church in Senye, and the stars fled far and wide,<br>
 
 And the daystar rose up bloody, and the cuckoo to her cried—<br>
 
 In Senye’s midst on the holy roof of Rúzhitsa did he perch.<br>
 
 The woman awoke and took her crutch and hastened to the church,<br>
 
 And told the Archpriest Nédelko what dream was come to her,<br>
 
 And to her the priest made clear the dream as an interpreter:<br>
 
  “Hearest thou, mother! Ill hast thou dreamed and evil soon will be.<br>
 
 In that darkness rose round Senye, ’twill be desolate for thee.<br>
 
 In that the sky was broken and the bright moon fell to the ground<br>
 
 On Rúzhitsa, Ivo will perish; he hath reached his term and bound.<br>
 
 In that the stars fled far and wide, will many a widow moan.<br>
 
 In that bloody rose the daystar, thou wilt be as a cuckoo alone.<br>

 In that it sang on the Rúzhitsa, the Turks will overthrow<br>
 
 Rúzhitsa, and, though old I be, the Turks will lay me low.”<br>
 
  Hardly had he done speaking, when before them Ivo stood.<br>
 
 The great black steed he rode upon was soaked with the dark blood;<br>
 
 He had seventeen wounds; in his left hand his cleft right hand he bore.<br>
 
 He drove the black steed onward the great white church before.<br>
 
 To his mother he spake: “From the black steed take me down, mother mine,<br>
 
 And wash me with cold water and purify with wine.”<br>
 
 Swift she obeyed: she took him down from the steed fierce and fine;<br>
 
 She washed him with cold water, and o’er him poured the wine.<br>
 
 His mother asked him: “What, my son, in Italy befell?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Ivo spake: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Mother, in Italy all things went swift and well;</td></tr></table>
 
 Enough slaves we took, mother, and enough of treasure bright;<br>
 
 Safe we turned home. When we were at the camp of the first night,<br>
 
 A first pursuit o’ertook us, black warriors that sped<br>
 
 Upon black steeds; black turbans they wore about the head.<br>

 We fired one volley, mother, we slew them all in fight;<br>
 
 Of us none perished, mother. At the camp of the second night<br>
 
 The second pursuit o’ertook us; the furious heroes sped<br>
 
 Upon white steeds, white turbans they wore about the head.<br>
 
 We fired one volley, mother; we slew them all in fight.<br>
 
 Of us none perished, mother. At the camp of the third night<br>
 
 The third pursuit o’ertook us; black cloaks, long guns did they bear.<br>
 
 We fired a single volley, and began to fight them there;<br>
 
 Of them none perished, mother; of us all fell in the fray,<br>
 
 Excepting thy son Ivo, at last that got away.<br>
 
 And he is wounded; in his left hand his right hand hath he brought.”<br>
 
  So Ivo spake, and forthwith with his dear soul he fought;<br>
 
 He breathed, and released from prison thereby was the spirit light.<br>
 
 He died, and his ancient mother—O evil was her plight!<br>
 
 May God give him a dwelling place in pleasant paradise,<br>
 
 And health to us, my brethren, and merriment likewise!<br>
