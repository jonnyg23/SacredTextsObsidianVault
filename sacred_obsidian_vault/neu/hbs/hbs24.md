 <h2 align="center">THE MARRIAGE OF PRINCE MARKO</h2>
 
 P<small>RINCE</small> M<small>ARKO</small> with his mother one evening sate alone.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Said his mother: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Marko, my little son, old is thy mother grown;</td></tr></table>
 
 No more can she prepare for thee the meal whereon to dine;<br>
 
 She cannot light a torch for thee or serve the ruddy wine.<br>
 
 Marry, my son, a woman forthwith to take my place.”<br>
 
  Marko unto his mother shortly he spake apace:<br>
 
  “In God’s name, my ancient mother, I have been nine realms around,<br>
 
 And a tenth, the Turkish empire. When a girl to my taste I found,<br>
 
 She would not have been to thy liking; when I found a friend for thee,<br>
 
 Then she was not to my liking, nor desirable to me.<br>
 
 Except for one, my mother, in the Bulgarian land;<br>
 
 I saw her in Shíshmanin’s palace; by a cistern did she stand.<br>
 
 When I looked on her, my mother, the grass swam under me;<br>
 
 There is the maid for me, mother, and a dear friend for thee.<br>
 
 Get me food for the journey; I will ask for the maiden’s hand.”<br>
 
 <p>

  She waited not, nor abided till the dawn shone in the land,<br>
 
 But she baked him bread with sugar. When the dawn broke clear and fine,<br>
 
 Marko girded himself and the steed and filled a skin of wine;<br>
 
 He hung it on Dapple’s saddle, and his mace on the other hand;<br>
 
 On Dapple he went to Shíshmanin’s house in the Bulgarian land.<br>
 
 Afar the king perceived him. Marko he came before;<br>
 
 They embraced and kissed each other, and asked how they them bore.<br>
 
 The servant to the cellars went with the faithful steed,<br>
 
 But the king, the good Prince Marko to his white house did lead.<br>
 
 They sat down at the ready board the dark-red wine to drain;<br>
 
 When they had drunk their fill thereof Marko leaped up again.<br>
 
 He doffed his cap, he bowed to the earth, and he asked for the maid of the king.<br>
 
 The king said naught, but gave her; on the ground he laid a ring,<br>
 
 And an apple thereby; moreover for the girl he let cut a shift.<br>
 
 To her sisters and kinswomen Marko gave many a gift,<br>
 
 He gave three packs of treasure; and there a month he spent,<br>
 
 <p>

 Ere to gather gay-clad wooers to Prilip the white he went.<br>
 
  The maid’s mother bespoke him: “My son-in-law,” she cried,<br>
 
 “My Marko, let no stranger be the bringer of the bride,<br>
 
 But rather thine own brother or some nephew of thy name,<br>
 
 For the maid is passing lovely and we fear some open shame.”<br>
 
  There bode Prince Marko of Prilip the remnant of the night;<br>
 
 At dawn he saddled Dapple and rode to Prilip the white.<br>
 
 Near the town his mother saw him, and drew near a little space,<br>
 
 And in her arms she took him and kissed him on the face.<br>
 
 And his mother asked Prince Marko, as he kissed her milk-white hand:<br>
 
  “My son, Prince Marko, art thou come in peace across the land?<br>
 
 And hast thou as yet discovered a daughter dear for me,<br>
 
 A maid to be my daughter and a true wife to thee?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Marko answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My mother, I am come in peace through the land;</td></tr></table>
 
 I have asked and won in marriage a maiden to my hand.<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 When I set out for my white house, then the maid’s mother cried:<br>
 
  “ ‘My Marko, let no stranger be the bringer of the bride,<br>
 
 But rather thine own brother or some nephew of thy name,<br>
 
 For the maid is passing lovely and we fear some open shame.’<br>
 
  “But, mother, I have not a brother, no nephew at all have I.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> His mother spake: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Son Marko, be troubled not thereby.</td></tr></table>
 
 A letter in fine characters, my son, thou shalt indite<br>
 
 Unto the Doge of Venice, and bid him come forthright<br>
 
 To be groomsman at thy wedding, with five hundred wooers beside.<br>
 
 Thou shalt write to Stevan Zemlyich to be bringer of the bride,<br>
 
 With five hundred wooers likewise. No shame at all shalt thou fear.”<br>
 
  When Marko understood her speech, he harkened his mother dear.<br>
 
 He wrote the letters on his knee, and one to the doge is borne,<br>
 
 And one to Stevan Zemlyich, that is his brother sworn.<br>
 
 Time passed; the Doge of Venice came, and five hundred wooers beside;<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 He went to the slender tower, but they to the lealand wide.<br>
 
 In a little while came Stevan and five hundred wooers fine.<br>
 
 They gathered at the slender tower and drank their fill of the wine.<br>
 
 Then they went to the court of Shíshmanin in the Bulgarian land,<br>
 
 And King Shíshmanin received them, and open was his hand<br>
 
 To the heroes in the houses and the horses in the stall,<br>
 
 And three white days he kept them, and they rested one and all.<br>
 
 When out broke the fourth morning, spake the heralds in this wise:<br>
 
  “What ho, ye gay-clad wooers, it is time that ye arise!<br>
 
 Short are the days, and the delays at nightfall long are they;<br>
 
 Ye should take thought, ye wooers, to wend the homeward way.”<br>
 
  King Shíshmanin brought gracious gifts. Fair hose he gave to one,<br>
 
 To another he gave a gallant cloth with embroidery thereon;<br>
 
 He gave unto the groomsman a table of gold well-tried,<br>
 
 And he gave a golden garment to the bringer of the bride,<br>
 
 And a great war-steed furthermore, and charged him with the maid;<br>
 
 <p>

 <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And to the bringer of the bride the king moreover said:<br>
 
  “Here is the steed and the maid likewise to take to Marko’s place:<br>
 
 Give him the maid; the steed is thine, a gift of honor and grace.”<br>
 
  Forth marched the gay-clad wooers through the Bulgarian land.<br>
 
 Where comes good fortune, also ill fortune is at hand;<br>
 
 For on that tide both far and wide the wind blew in the field,<br>
 
 The wind stirred lightly the maiden’s veil and the maiden’s face was revealed.<br>
 
 The Doge of Venice saw her. His head for grief ached sore.<br>
 
 He scarce could wait till evening the land had fallen o’er.<br>
 
 When they came to the night encampment, the Doge of Venice sped<br>
 
 To the tent of Stevan Zemlyich, and soft to him he said:<br>
 
  “O Stevan, the bringer of the bride, give me thy sister dear<br>
 
 One night for my love, and thou shalt have this bootful of treasure here.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Lo, Stevan, the yellow ducats!” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>But Stevan to him did cry:</td></tr></table>
 
 “Be silent, doge, mayst thou change to stone! Has it entered thy mind to die?”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 139------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  The Doge of Venice turned him back. At the second camp he went<br>
 
 And spoke to Stevan Zemlyich in the midst of the white tent:<br>
 
  “I prithee, Stevan Zemlyich, give me thy sister dear<br>
 
 One night for my love. Thou shalt have therefor two bootsfull of treasure here.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Lo, Stevan, the yellow ducats!” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Said Stevan thereupon:</td></tr></table>
 
 “Go, doge! Mayst thou perish straightway! Shall my sister be undone?”<br>
 
  To his tent went the doge. When the third camp was pitched at eventide,<br>
 
 The doge went unto Stevan, the bringer of the bride:<br>
 
  “O thou, the bringer of the bride, give me thy sister dear<br>
 
 One night for my love. Thou shalt have therefor three bootsfull of ducats here.”<br>
 
  Thereupon Stevan Zemlyich was finally cajoled<br>
 
 To give the doge his sister for three bootsfull of yellow gold.<br>
 
 Stevan took up the ducats and the doge led the maid<br>
 
 By the white hand within his tent and softly to her said:<br>
 
 “Sit down, sweet bride, that thou and I may fondle each other now.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But answered the Bulgarian bride: </td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td>
 
 <!------------------------page 140------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a>
 
 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“A shameful groomsman art thou!</td></tr></table>
 
 O Doge of Venice, beneath us the earth will open wide,<br>
 
 The heaven will crack above us! What man shall fondle a bride?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The Doge of Venice answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Speak not like a fool confessed!</td></tr></table>
 
 I have already, dearest, nine christened brides caressed,<br>
 
 And of wives four and twenty. The earth it gaped not wide,<br>
 
 Nor did the heaven crack o’er us. Sit down, let me fondle thee, bride!”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But the bride said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Doge of Venice, my groomsman, harken this.</td></tr></table>
 
 My mother dear adjured me no bearded man to kiss,<br>
 
 But a young and beardless hero, such as Prince Marko is.”<br>
 
  When the Doge of Venice heard it, he called swift barbers there;<br>
 
 One bathed him, and the second he shaved him clean and fair.<br>
 
 And the lovely bride bowed over in the place where she stood,<br>
 
 And picked up the beard and wrapped it in a piece of linen good.<br>
 
 Thereafter the Doge of Venice the barbers drove outside,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 141------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And said unto her softly: “Now sit thee down, sweet bride!”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Then answered the Bulgarian girl: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“When Marko of this shall hear,</td></tr></table>
 
 Three heads, O Doge, my groomsman, from our bodies he will shear.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The doge said unto the sweet bride: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Speak not so foolishly!</td></tr></table>
 
 There in the midst of the wooers is Marko plain to see,<br>
 
 Where his fair white pavilion he did himself unfold.<br>
 
 Upon the summit of the tent is an apple of red gold,<br>
 
 With gems so bright that by their light are half the wooers seen clear.<br>
 
 But at my side sit down, O bride, that we may fondle here.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The bride said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Wait in the tent a space, thou dearest groomsman of mine,</td></tr></table>
 
 Till I look on the sky above the clouds, if it be foul or fine.”<br>
 
  When she had came without the tent, she fled to Marko in fear;<br>
 
 The girl sprang through the wooers like a fawn of a single year,<br>
 
 To the tent of the Prince Marko, that down to sleep had lain;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 142------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And the girl stood before him, and her tears ran down like rain.<br>
 
 Then Marko leaped to his feet and spake to the Bulgarian bride:<br>
 
  “What a wretch, Bulgarian, art thou! Couldst thou not e’en abide<br>
 
 Till we came to my white dwelling, and in Christian guise were wed?”<br>
 
  He seized the saber silver-wrought, but the bride bowed down and said:<br>
 
  “Marko, mine is no wretch’s line, but a house of power and pride!<br>
 
 The wretches are thine, thy groomsman and the bringer of the bride!<br>
 
 Thine own bride Stevan Zemlyich to the Doge of Venice sold<br>
 
 For three bootsfull of treasure, ducats of yellow gold.<br>
 
 Prince Marko haply will not believe—if thou believest not me,<br>
 
 The beard of the Doge of Venice, I have brought it unto thee.”<br>
 
  And thereupon she opened the cloth that held it wide.<br>
 
 When the Prince Marko saw it, he spoke unto the bride:<br>
 
 “Sit down, fair bride; on the morrow I will look the matter o’er.”<br>
 
 Then Marko laid him down again to slumber there once more.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 143------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 But when on the morrow morning the mighty sun outbroke,<br>
 
 Marko leaped nimbly to his feet, and fastened back his cloak;<br>
 
 In his hand he took the heavy mace, and then away he hied,<br>
 
 To bid the groomsman good morrow, and the bringer of the bride.<br>
 
  “Good morrow, bringer of the bride, and groomsman mine,” said he;<br>
 
 “Bringer of the bride and groomsman, say, where now the bride may be.”<br>
 
  Still was the bringer of the bride, no answer would he make;<br>
 
 But unto the Prince Marko the Doge of Venice spake:<br>
 
  “How now, friend Marko the bridegroom, of such strange whims men are,<br>
 
 That hardly a man may make a jest without begetting a war!”<br>
 
  “Evil is the jest of thine, O doge!” thereto did Marko say,<br>
 
 “No jest is a shaven beard! Where now is thy beard of yesterday?”<br>
 
  Yet more to him in answer had the Doge of Venice said;<br>
 
 Marko swung the great saber, and cut off the doge’s head.<br>
 
 Forthwith fled Stevan Zemlyich, but Marko ran amain,<br>
 
 And smote him with the saber, and cut him right in twain.<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 In the tent himself he girded, and saddled Dapple aright;<br>
 
 Forth went the gay-clad wooers, and came to Prilip the white.<br>
