 <h2 align="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE VILA</h2>
 
 Two sworn brothers were riding over Miroch, the mountain fair;<br>
 
 Voývoda Milosh and Marko were the two heroes there.<br>
 
 Side by side the steeds did they ride as they bore the spears that day;<br>
 
 One kissed the face of the other: such loving brothers were they.<br>
 
 Then Marko on Dapple yearned to sleep; he spake to his brother sworn:<br>
 
  “Voývoda Milosh, heavily by sleep am I overborne.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Sing to me, brother, and cheer me.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Prince Marko, brother mine,”</td></tr></table>
 
 Said Milosh, “I would sing to thee, but, Marko, I drank the wine<br>
 
 In the mountain with Ravíyoyla, the vila, yesternight.<br>
 
 She forbade me; if she hears me, my throat and heart will she smite.”<br>
 
  Prince Marko spake: “Sing brother, nor ever the vila fear,<br>
 
 While Dapple and I and the war-club with six gold knobs are here.”<br>
 
  Then sang Milosh, the voývoda, a great and beautiful song<br>
 
 Of our elders and our betters that held the kingdom long<br>
 
 <p>

 In famous Macedonia, and the troop that with each did go.<br>
 
 The song was pleasing to Marko, and he bowed on the saddlebow.<br>
 
 Prince Marko slept in the saddle, and Milosh sang on the track;<br>
 
 And the vila Ravíyoyla heard him, and sang in answer back.<br>
 
 Milosh sang, and the vila again unto him sang.<br>
 
 The better voice had Milosh, and angrily she sprang<br>
 
 Away to the mountain Miroch; with two white arrows she smote<br>
 
 Voývoda Milosh through the heart and likewise in the throat.<a name="page_121_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_121_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Said Milosh: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Alas, my mother! And woe unto Marko, too!</td></tr></table>
 
 Alas, my brother, the vila has shot me through and through!<br>
 
 Did I not tell thee I must not sing on Miroch in our course?”<br>
 
 Marko started from slumber, and sprang from the dappled horse.<br>
 
 Well did he stretch the girth-straps for Dapple the good gray;<br>
 
 He kissed him, and embraced him, and to the steed did he say:<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
  “Ah, Dapple the steed, of all my strength the great right wing art thou;<br>
 
 Ravíyoyla, the vila, do thou overtake her now.<br>
 
 I will shoe thee with pure silver and gold of the seventh proof;<br>
 
 I will cover thee with silk to the knee, with tassels thence to the hoof;<br>
 
 And all thy mane, moreover, shall be mingled with the gold;<br>
 
 And I will deck thy trappings with small pearls manifold.<br>
 
 If thou dost not overtake her, I will put out both thine eyes;<br>
 
 I will break thy legs, all four of them, and leave thee in evil guise;<br>
 
 And thou shalt struggle from fir to fir, abandoned and forlorn,<br>
 
 Even as I, Prince Marko, without my brother sworn.”<br>
 
  Prince Marko on gray Dapple’s back forthwith himself he threw;<br>
 
 They raced across Mount Miroch. O’er the trees the vila flew,<br>
 
 And desperately Dapple galloped the midst of the forest through.<br>
 
 At first nowhere could the vila be seen or heard thereby;<br>
 
 But at last, when Dapple saw her, he leaped three spear-lengths high<br>
 
 And a full four spear-lengths forward. Dapple gained on her swift;<br>
 
 <p>

 In her distress she leaped aloft amid the clouds and lift.<br>
 
 Up Marko hurled the golden mace, the weapon of great worth,<br>
 
 And smote her between the shoulders, and beat her to the earth.<br>
 
 Left and right he did her smite with the golden club that day.<br>
 
  “Why shottest thou my brother, vila? May the good God thee slay!<br>
 
 Give thou herbs for the hero. Ere long thou shalt lose thine head.”<br>
 
  The vila besought him in God’s name. Imploringly she said:<br>
 
  “Prince Marko, my sworn brother, God and St. John before,<br>
 
 Release me alive in the forest, to search Mount Miroch o’er<br>
 
 For herbs to heal the hero, and his fierce wounds abate.”<br>
 
  Marko harkened her prayer, for his heart was compassionate;<br>
 
 Alive into the forest he let the vila go.<br>
 
 She gathered herbs on Miroch, as she wandered to and fro,<br>
 
 And she called often: “My brother, I am coming from the field.”<br>
 
 The vila gathered many an herb, and the hero’s wounds she healed;<br>
 
 And the lordly throat of Milosh was better than before,<br>
 
 <p>

 And the strong heart of the hero was stronger than of yore.<br>
 
 The vila went unto Miroch. With his sworn brother good,<br>
 
 Went Marko to Porech country, and forded Timok flood,<br>
 
 Till he came to the great town Brégovo and the Vidin country-side.<br>
 
 But Ravíyoyla, the vila, to the other vilas cried:<br>
 
  “Hear ye, my friends, the vilas, and harken, and give ear:<br>
 
 Shoot no hero on the mountain when Marko the Prince is near,<br>
 
 Or while Dapple and he and the war-club with six gold knobs are here.<br>
 
 What I have suffered at his hands, I have not strength to say,<br>
 
 And hardly out of them at last alive I got away.”<br>
