 <h2 align="center">THE DEATH OF MARKO KRÁLYEVICH</h2>
 
 P<small>RINCE</small> M<small>ARKO</small> rose up early on Sunday before the sun,<br>
 
 On Mount Úrvina by the seacoast. And as he rode thereon,<br>
 
 Dapple the stallion staggered sore; from his eyes ran bitter tears.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Marko it grieved. He spake to the steed: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“A hundred and sixty years,</td></tr></table>
 
 Dapple, my gallant stallion, are gone since I came on thee.<br>
 
 Never hast thou staggered; yet to-day hast thou staggered under me,<br>
 
 And thou sheddest tears. God knoweth there is no good from the sign:<br>
 
 The one of us is in danger; thy life it is or mine.”<br>
 
  While Marko spake, a vila on Úrvina’s steep side<br>
 
 In summons to Prince Marko lifted her voice and cried:<br>
 
  “Knowest thou, Marko, my brother sworn, why stumbles Dapple, thine horse?<br>
 
 He sorrows for thee, his master, since soon will ye part perforce.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said Marko to the vila: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“May thy throat ache for this!</td></tr></table>
 
 How should I part with Dapple? Cities and emperies<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 Have I not passed over and traversed, from the east unto the west?<br>
 
 And Dapple, my steed, was ever of all good steeds the best;<br>
 
 And I was the best of the heroes. He shall not from me be led,<br>
 
 While upon Marko’s shoulders remaineth Marko’s head.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said the vila: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Marko, my brother sworn, none shall take Dapple so.</td></tr></table>
 
 Neither shalt thou die at a hero’s hands by any saber blow,<br>
 
 Nor by the shock of the heavy mace, nor piercing of the spear;<br>
 
 For any hero of the earth, Prince Marko, have no fear.<br>
 
 But Marko, God shall slay thee, the ancient slayer of men.<br>
 
 If thou wilt not believe me, go up to the mountain then.<br>
 
 Aloft shalt thou see two slender firs on the left and on the right;<br>
 
 They have overhung the mountain with the summits of their might.<br>
 
 And all the air is spicy with their fair needles green;<br>
 
 And there runneth a spring of water the slender trees between.<br>
 
 There turn and dismount from Dapple; to a tree the steed shalt thou tie.<br>
 
 <p>

 Raise thyself over the water-spring that bubbles up hard by,<br>
 
 And look at thy face in the water. Thou shalt see when thou shalt die.”<br>
 
  Marko obeyed. Aloft he looked on the left and on the right<br>
 
 At the firs that overhung the mount with the summits of their might,<br>
 
 And all the air was spicy with the fair needles green.<br>
 
 There Marko halted Dapple in a little space between,<br>
 
 And to a fir tree in the midst the charger did he tie.<br>
 
 He raised himself o’er the water-spring that bubbled up hard by;<br>
 
 And when Marko looked on the water, he saw when he should die.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>He wept apace and spake apace: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Ah, lying world, fair flower—</td></tr></table>
 
 Fair wast thou and too little have I roamed thee in my hour,<br>
 
 Three hundred years; and now must part from thy pleasure and thy power!”<br>
 
  From his girdle the Prince Marko drew out the iron glaive,<br>
 
 And he went to the steed Dapple, and Dapple’s neck he clave,<br>
 
 That Dapple might come never to a Turk, a prize of war,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 181------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And do him bitter service bearing water in the jar.<br>
 
 When he had slaughtered Dapple, he buried Dapple the steed;<br>
 
 A better grave the horse he gave than to Andrew, his brother, indeed.<br>
 
 The mighty glaive, thereafter, he broke in pieces four,<br>
 
 Lest it should come into Turkish hands, and the Turks should be glad therefor,<br>
 
 And rejoice for the sword of Marko to their hand that had fallen then;<br>
 
 And lest, moreover, he should be curst by any Christian men.<br>
 
 When he had broken the saber, in seven the spear broke he,<br>
 
 And threw it among the fir twigs. The rough mace mightily<br>
 
 He grasped, and from Úrvina hurled it into the thick blue sea;<br>
 
 And Marko said: “When that club of mine ariseth out of the main,<br>
 
 Then will there be a hero upon the earth again.”<br>
 
 When he had ruined his weapons, then pen and ink he drew<br>
 
 From his belt, and from his pocket white paper fresh and new.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And he writes a letter: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Whoever over Ùrvina shall fare</td></tr></table>
 
 To the cold spring between the firs, and finds brave Marko there,<br>
 
 <p>

 Let him know forthwith that perished at last is Marko the bold.<br>
 
 About him are three money-belts. What treasure do they hold?<br>
 
 Therein is a lordly treasure of ducats of yellow gold.<br>
 
 One belt will I give with my blessing to him who buries me;<br>
 
 With the second belt let churches be sculptured splendidly;<br>
 
 And the third belt I bequeath it to the maimed and to the blind,<br>
 
 That they may sing of Marko and his fame be kept in mind.”<br>
 
  When the letter was written, he thrust it upon a twig of the fir,<br>
 
 Whence from the road it might be seen by any wayfarer.<br>
 
 The golden writing-set therewith into the spring he threw,<br>
 
 And his good mantle of the green from off his shoulders drew.<br>
 
 He spread the mantle beneath the fir, and the sign of the cross made then;<br>
 
 He pulled the sables over his eyes, and lay there, nor rose again.<br>
 
 Dead was Marko beside the spring. For a week, from day to day,<br>
 
 Whoever saw Prince Marko that traveled along that way,<br>
 
 Deemed that the good Prince Marko asleep was lying there;<br>

 And, fearing to awake him, a long way round would they fare.<br>
 
  Where’er is found good fortune, misfortune cometh apace,<br>
 
 And wherever evil hap is found, good cometh soon in the place.<br>
 
 Abbot Basil of Athos from the church Vilíndar the white,<br>
 
 He it was spied Prince Marko, with Isaias his acolyte.<br>
 
 He held his hand: “Lightly, my son, see that thou wake him not.<br>
 
 After sleep is Marko moody; he may kill us on the spot.”<br>
 
 But the monk saw how Marko slept. The letter he espied,<br>
 
 And he read throughout the letter that told how Marko died.<br>
 
 The monk dismounted from the steed, and raised up Marko the bold.<br>
 
 Marko was dead. The bitter tears down Basil’s cheek they rolled,<br>
 
 And he sorrowed sore for Marko. The belts of golden pelf<br>
 
 He ungirded from the hero, and belted on himself.<br>
 
 On many a grave he pondered, where to bury Marko dead.<br>
 
 He chose; and got him on the horse, and to the seashore sped.<br>
 
 In a ship he laid Prince Marko. And to Athos the Holy Height<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 He bore him, to Vilíndar, the stately and the white,<br>
 
 And there the funeral liturgy over the prince he read<br>
 
 And likewise sang the requiem before they graved the dead.<br>
 
 There the old man buried Marko. No mark he placed him o’er,<br>
 
 That none might say where the hero lay, and mock at him therefore.<br>
