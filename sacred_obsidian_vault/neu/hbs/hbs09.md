 <h2 align="center">BAN STRAHIN</h2>
 
 S<small>TRAHIN</small> was ban of Banska that by Kósovo doth stand;<br>
 
 And such another falcon there is not in the land.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>He rose up in the morning: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Ho, all my knaves, give heed!</td></tr></table>
 
 Get ye down to the stables and saddle me my steed.<br>
 
 Deck him out fair and seemly, and gird him with the girth;<br>
 
 For hark and hear me, gallants, I go roving o’er the earth.<br>
 
 Weary shall be the milk-white steed, before I shall alight<br>
 
 Where dwell my wife’s good kindred in Krúshevats the white—<br>
 
 Her brave old father Yug Bogdan and her good brothers nine,<br>
 
 Her gallant kin shall take me in and cheer me with the wine.”<br>
 
  Then forthwith all the servants unto the ban gave heed,<br>
 
 And from the lordly stable led the white falcon steed.<br>
 
 And then the brave Ban Strahin himself the steed arrayed;<br>
 
 He set on him a saddle of velvet and brocade,<br>
 
 Redder than sunset water, more shining than the sun!<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 33------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 So the good ban put on the steed that rich caparison.<br>
 
 So rode he forth that morning, nor ever did alight<br>
 
 Till he came in to his wife’s kin in Krúshevats the white,<br>
 
 Where late the realm men stablished. And him Yug Bogdan saw,<br>
 
 And with his nine gray hawks came on to greet his son-in-law.<br>
 
 They waited little for him, but clasped him one and all;<br>
 
 And while the servants took the steed, they brought the ban to hall.<br>
 
 Down sat they at the ready board, and spake fair words and fine;<br>
 
 And man and maid came in apace to serve or pour the wine.<br>
 
 Then all those goodly Christians their thirst began to quench;<br>
 
 Yug Bogdan set Ban Strahin beside him on the bench;<br>
 
 Upon his right he set him, his sons on the other hand;<br>
 
 But the remnant of his people at the table-foot must stand.<br>
 
 The servants served before them. Nine daughters had that lord,<br>
 
 And each fair daughter in her turn served deftly at the board.<br>
 
 They served before their father; they served their lords that tide;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 34------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 But most of all Ban Strahin, for their sister was his bride.<br>
 
 One servant stood before them to serve the red wine up;<br>
 
 In a gold cup he measured it—nine measures held that cup.<br>
 
 Much courtesy was there to see and guests from near and far;<br>
 
 Brothers as many came as to a banquet of the tsar.<br>
 
 Long was Ban Strahin’s tarrying; long, long did he abide,<br>
 
 Dwelling among his wife her kin in pleasure and in pride.<br>
 
  The guests that were in Krúshevats a bitter cry they made,<br>
 
 And came to old Yug Bogdan and unto him they prayed:<br>
 
  “We kiss thy silken garments, thou art our lord and chief;<br>
 
 We therefore pray thy kindness to do us this relief.<br>
 
 Bring Strahin thy good son-in-law to our castles and our courts,<br>
 
 That we may do him honor as with his worth consorts.”<br>
 
  Before that mirth was over was long enough, I trow.<br>
 
 Long the ban tarried, ere came forth the tidings of his woe.<br>
 
 But lo, in the fair morning, when the warm sun beat down,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 35------------------------>

 A lad bore a white letter from Banska, the little town,—<br>
 
 Tidings from his old mother! He set it on his knee;<br>
 
 Therein was many a bitter and dreadful thing to see,<br>
 
 For there her curse is written most plain in Strahin’s sight:<br>
 
  “Where art thou, son? Foul fall the wine in Krúshevats the white!<br>
 
 Evil is the wine and full of shame for thee and thy wife’s kin.<br>
 
 Behold what woes against thee are written down herein!<br>
 
 From Yedren<a name="page_35_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_35_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> with an army is come the Turkish tsar<br>
 
 To Kósovo, and his viziers are with him in the war;<br>
 
 And he hath taken Kósovo with his accurst viziers.<br>
 
 The whole strength hath he brought along of all the Turkish spears;<br>
 
 Along the land of Kósovo hath he ta’en either flood—<br>
 
 Lab and Sítnitsa onward from the marble to the wood,<br>
 
 From the maple dry to Sázliya bridged over by the arch,<br>
 
 Through Zvechan and Chechan to the wood round Kósovo they march,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 36------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 The valley of their capture; thereto they haste along.<br>
 
 And the tsar hath one army an hundred thousand strong,<br>
 
 That one lone lord hath lent him who hath a fief of the tsar.<br>
 
 Many lords eat of the tsars bread, and ride his steeds of war.<br>
 
 Few arms those chieftains carry; nay, but a single blade!<br>
 
 And yet another army is for the tsar arrayed—<br>
 
 The Turks and janissaries in Yedren’s milk-white tower;<br>
 
 And yet an hundred thousand they say are in that power.<br>
 
 Tuk and Manjuk an army for the tsar lead as well,<br>
 
 And death is in their onslaught and slaughter in their yell.<br>
 
 But yet there is one army of all from far and near—<br>
 
 Vlah Áliya’s, that feareth not for sultan nor vizier,<br>
 
 Nor all within the armies save as ants upon the hill.<br>
 
  “Such is the Turkish battle, nor departs he without ill.<br>
 
 He smote on little Banska; by the left-hand way he came;<br>
 
 He stormed the hold of Banska, and burned it with the flame.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 37------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 He hath o’erturned the lowest stone; thy servants fled perforce;<br>
 
 And o’er thy mother’s body hath he ridden on his horse;<br>
 
 With thy wife upon his saddlebow through Kósovo he went,<br>
 
 And he kisses thy belovèd in the shadow of his tent.<br>
 
 And I above burned ruins bewail this fate of mine,<br>
 
 While thou drink’st wine in Krúshevats. God send ’tis Death his wine!”<br>
 
  When the ban read the letter, Grief took him in her grip;<br>
 
 Down drooped upon his shoulder the black beard of his lip;<br>
 
 He ground his teeth together, and was very nigh to weep;<br>
 
 And old Yug Bogdan saw him, as he rose up from his sleep.<br>
 
 Yug’s voice flashed up like fire; he spake after this wise:<br>
 
  “God help my son! and wherefore dost thou so soon arise?<br>
 
 And wherefore art thou troubled, good son-in-law of mine?<br>
 
 Have thy brave brothers laughed at thee or mocked thee at the wine?<br>
 
 Have not thy sisters served thee? Is there evil among thy kin?<br>
 
 Tell me, my son, and straightway: what shame is found herein?”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 38------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  The ban flashed up before him and to his father said:<br>
 
  “Father, I find no fault at all in the kin of her I wed,<br>
 
 And my good brothers with me deal pleasantly withal;<br>
 
 The noble ladies speak me fair and serve me in the hall:<br>
 
 Among my wife’s good kindred no fault at all doth stand.<br>
 
 My mother out of Banska sends this letter to my hand.”<br>
 
  He tells unto his father in the fair morning-tide<br>
 
 How all of his possession is wasted far and wide;<br>
 
 How that the Turks have scattered his servants, knight and knave,<br>
 
 And trampled on his mother, and his wife ta’en for a slave:<br>
 
  “And O thou old Yug Bogdan, if she be dear to me,<br>
 
 Also she is thy daughter and shame to me and thee!<br>
 
 And if thou ever thoughtest a gift to me to give,<br>
 
 Give it not after I am dead, but now while yet I live.<br>
 
 I pray thee and I kiss thy hand: give me thy children nine,<br>
 
 And we will go to Kósovo to seek this foe of mine—<br>
 
 Yea, this red traitor to the tsar, that hath enslaved my wife.<br>
 
 Be not afraid, my father, nor sorrow for their life;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 39------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 They shall wear Turkish raiment, turbans as white as milk<br>
 
 And good green mantles, and also broad trousers wrought of silk.<br>
 
 And at the belt long sabers as flashing as a flame.<br>
 
 And I will call my servants, and order them by name,<br>
 
 To saddle up the horses and draw the saddlebelts,<br>
 
 And cover o’er the horses with the strong black bear-pelts.<br>
 
 Strong janissaries shall they be; my counsel shall they know,<br>
 
 What time through the tsar’s army we ride in Kósovo.<br>
 
 And I will be their captain, who have their sister wed,<br>
 
 That they may heed my counsel, and have it still in dread.<br>
 
 And if a soldier of the tsar shall challenge us in speech,<br>
 
 Turkish, mayhap, or Arabic; why, I can speak in each,<br>
 
 And Manov too, and Arnaut, enough to serve that tide.<br>
 
 To seek my foe through Kósovo, so lightly will we ride—<br>
 
 This Turk Vlah Áliya that enslaved my love by might and main.<br>
 
 For though alone among the Turks I might perish or be ta’en,<br>
 
 My brethren and I, we shall not die nor be smitten down in vain!”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 40------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  When old Yug Bogdan heard this, he flashed like living fire;<br>
 
 He spake unto Ban Strahin in words of wrath and ire:<br>
 
  “O thou, my son Ban Strahin, witless art thou and rash!<br>
 
 Wilt thou lead my sons to Kósovo for these same Turks to slash?<br>
 
 Say nothing more, my son-in-law! My sons shall not be slain,<br>
 
 Though thy fair wife, my daughter, come never home again.<br>
 
 Nay, nevermore, Ban Strahin, unloose thy wrath at me,<br>
 
 For wit thou well, my son-in-law—may the plague light on thee!—<br>
 
 If she have been his paramour but one night in the tent,<br>
 
 So may she be no longer the bride of thy content;<br>
 
 God hath slain her forever; accursèd shall she be!<br>
 
 And a worse thing, Ban Strahin, him she prefers to thee.<br>
 
 Go to! The Devil take her! And for this love of thine<br>
 
 I will give thee a better, and with thee drink the wine.<br>
 
 I will be thy friend forever, but my children shall not go<br>
 
 Riding amain across the plain with thee to Kósovo!”<br>
 
  But when Ban Strahin heard it, he flashed like living fire;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 41------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Answered the ban to the old man in agony and ire.<br>
 
 He will not call a servant; for a groom he takes not heed,<br>
 
 But goeth himself to the stable to saddle the white steed.<br>
 
 How royally he saddled him! how girded him thereto!<br>
 
 How over flashing ear and crest the bit and bridle drew!<br>
 
 Before the gateway of the court he led him forth alone,<br>
 
 And held him by the bridle near the white stepping-stone.<br>
 
 And he caught the steed by the shoulder and mounted with a bound,<br>
 
 And looked upon his brethren, but they looked upon the ground.<br>
 
 Upon his sister’s husband Ban Strahin turned his eyes,<br>
 
 But Némanyich looked downward at the black dust likewise.<br>
 
 They had drunken wine and brandy enough to make one nod,<br>
 
 And boasted that they were heroes, and sworn by the name of God:<br>
 
 “We love thee, thou Ban Strahin, more than the tsar’s whole land.”<br>
 
 But woe! the ban has never a man this day his friend to stand.<br>
 
 It is no easy labor to Kósovo to wend;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 42------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And the ban looked about him and saw he had no friend.<br>
 
 He rode down through white Krúshevats, but aye he looked behind<br>
 
 To see if his brave brethren would alter in their mind,<br>
 
 And pity his affliction. No friend came to the ban.<br>
 
 And thereupon he minded him of the hound Káraman,<a name="page_42_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_42_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 
 Whom he loves better than the steed, and holds of richer worth,<br>
 
 And loudly from the strong white throat the hound-call thunders forth.<br>
 
 The hound lay in the stable, but harkened and gave heed,<br>
 
 And swiftly in the field he ran, till he overtook the steed.<br>
 
 And gay beside the milk-white steed the hound rejoicing springs,<br>
 
 And on his neck the collar of corded goldwork rings.<br>
 
 A pleasant thing it was; the ban rode glad on the stallion’s back,<br>
 
 And took by weald and mount and field to Kósovo the track.<br>
 
 When he saw the host at Kósovo his heart was touched by fear,<br>
 
 But he remembered the true God, and to the Turks drew near.<br>
 
 Over the field of Kósovo on all four sides he went,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 43------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Seeking the strong Vlah Áliyah, but he could not find his tent.<br>
 
  By the waters of the Sítnitsa a marvel there was seen,<br>
 
 By the shore of the Sítnitsa was pitched a tent of green.<br>
 
 The tent of green was very fair; it hid the grassy lawn,<br>
 
 The golden apple on the pole shone brighter than the dawn.<br>
 
 A spear is set before the door, and by the spear a steed,<br>
 
 With his head deep in the nose-bag upon the oats to feed.<br>
 
 The steed pawed fierce upon the ground with the off hoof and the near,<br>
 
 And the ban thought unto himself: “Vlah Áliya’s tent is here.”<br>
 
 And forward rode the hero upon the milk-white steed;<br>
 
 He took his spear from shoulder, all ready to his need.<br>
 
 He threw the tent door open, and looked within the tent;<br>
 
 But it was not Vlah Áliya, the strong and insolent;<br>
 
 But a dervish, to whose girdle the white beard sweeps from the chin,<br>
 
 Lies in the shadow of the tent, and no one else therein.<br>
 
 A luckless dervish is the Turk, but he drinks wine in a cup;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 44------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 He pours the wine out for himself and forthwith drinks it up.<br>
 
 Ban Strahin looked on the dervish that was bloody to the eyes,<br>
 
 And made salam unto him, after the Turkish wise.<br>
 
 The drunken Turk looked on him, and spoke a word of woe:<br>
 
 “Hail to thee, brave Ban Strahin of Banska by Kósovo!”<br>
 
 Now flashed up the Ban Strahin, and answered him in dread;<br>
 
 In the fair-spoken Turkish a bitter word he said:<br>
 
  “Foul fall thy mother, thou dervish, that drinkest here this hour!<br>
 
 Thou art so drunk thou canst not tell a Moslem from a Giaour.<br>
 
 Wherefore dost thou speak of him? for here is found no ban;<br>
 
 There is none here but I, and I am the tsar’s true fighting man.<br>
 
 All of the tsar’s good horses are scattered near and far,<br>
 
 And the warriors run quickly to catch them for the tsar.<br>
 
 If I go with this thy insult to the tsar and the vizier,<br>
 
 Know well, thou sorry dervish, thy words shall cost thee dear.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Laughed the dervish: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Thou a Turk, Strahin? Good fortune go with thee!</td></tr></table>

 Were I upon Mount Golech, and should haply chance to see<br>
 
 Thee afar in the host of the tsar, well I should know thee, ban—<br>
 
 Thee and that milk-white steed of thine, and the hound Káraman,<br>
 
 Whom aye thou lovest better than the strong stallion white.<br>
 
 And know, thou ban of Banska, I read thy brow aright.<br>
 
 And I know the eyes thereunder and the black beard of thy lip.<br>
 
 Know, ban—and may good fortune be of thy fellowship!—<br>
 
 That when thy guardsmen took me and made of me a slave,<br>
 
 To thee in Suhara of the mount me miserable they gave.<br>
 
 To the bottom of that prison didst thou cast me at that tide,<br>
 
 And there a slave to thine and thee nine years did I abide.<br>
 
 Nine fearful years past over, yea! and the tenth began,<br>
 
 When filled with deep compassion thou thoughtest on me, ban.<br>
 
 Thou badest Rado, the jailer, unbar the doors withal,<br>
 
 And forthwith bring me upward a captive to the hall.<br>
 
 And dost thou know, Ban Strahin, what words thy fierce lips said:<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 46------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  “ ‘Slave! Turkish snake! Now would that thou within my hold wert dead!<br>
 
 Canst thou then, like a hero, redeem thee with a fee?’<br>
 
  “So ran thy question to me, and I told the truth to thee:<br>
 
  “ ‘My life now could I ransom, could I come to my hall,<br>
 
 To my father’s land and my birthplace and my fiefs one and all—<br>
 
 My many farms and freeholds, the price of liberty.<br>
 
 But thither to go, too well I know, hardly thou trustest me.<br>
 
 I will give thee a good bondsman, even God who does not feign,<br>
 
 And another bondsman, his good faith, that I bring that ransom again.’<br>
 
  “Thou gavest thy trust to me that tide to go to my white hall,<br>
 
 To my father’s land and my birthplace, and my fiefs one and all.<br>
 
 I came to my sad birthplace; no more I knew good luck;<br>
 
 On my houses and my birthplace the pestilence had struck.<br>
 
 It smote the men and women; in my houses none had stayed,<br>
 
 And my whole house had perished and my whole possession strayed.<br>
 
 Fast-barred was all my sire’s estate, and bolted was the door.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 47------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 The Turks took farm and freehold for their own forevermore.<br>
 
 And when I saw my houses all closed against me stand,<br>
 
 That I had neither friend nor goods, then a good plan I planned.<br>
 
 I rode post unto Yedren, to the vizier and the tsar,<br>
 
 And the vizier boasted me for a hero in the war.<br>
 
 The tsar’s vizier clothed me and gave a tent to me,<br>
 
 And the great raven charger and shining panoply.<br>
 
 For the tsar’s man forever in his book my name they set,<br>
 
 And thou hast come to me to-day to claim of me thy debt.<br>
 
 But, ban, I have not a penny; and woe is on thee this day,<br>
 
 That thou comest to die in folly amidst the tsar’s array.”<br>
 
  The ban looked on the dervish. Forthwith the man he knew;<br>
 
 From the steed he vaulted, and clasped him, and to his bosom drew:<br>
 
  “Brother in God, old dervish, no debt is due to me.<br>
 
 I seek no money, brother, nor any ransom fee.<br>
 
 I seek the strong Vlah Áliya, who hath overthrown my hall,<br>
 
 And hath taken my belovèd to be his bounden thrall.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 48------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Tell me of him, thou dervish, and do not me betray<br>
 
 Unto the Turkish army, who are yearning me to slay.”<br>
 
  “By God,” then said the dervish, “thou ban, thou falcon-one,<br>
 
 The strength of this my faith to thee is firmer than the stone.<br>
 
 Shouldst thou with the sword’s edges smite half the army dead,<br>
 
 Yet would I not betray thee, nor trample on thy bread.<br>
 
 Though I ate of it in prison, thou gavest me store of wine;<br>
 
 Thou gavest the milk-white loaves to me that I might freely dine;<br>
 
 Oft in the sun’s light glorious I warmed me in the morn;<br>
 
 Thou didst set me free upon my word, wherein I am forsworn.<br>
 
 I could not keep my word to thee, returning to thy hall:<br>
 
 Faith it was hard for me to keep without the wherewithal!<br>
 
 And for the Turk, Ban Strahin, Vlah Áliya insolent—<br>
 
 On the high mount of Golech he pitches now his tent.<br>
 
 But, Strahin, go from Kósovo, or a fool’s death diest thou here;<br>
 
 Trust not thy hand, nor the sharp brand, nor the venom of the spear.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 49------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 To pass that Turk in the mountain, it is a hero’s deed;<br>
 
 In his arms alive will he take thee, thy weapons and thy steed.<br>
 
 He will break thine arms asunder; he will blind thee living, O ban.”<br>
 
  Laughed Strahin: “Dervish, pity me not because of any man,<br>
 
 But to the Turkish army betray me not this tide.”<br>
 
  And thereupon the dervish unto the ban replied:<br>
 
  “My faith is firmer than the stone, and plighted thee indeed.<br>
 
 For even shouldst thou madden the anger of thy steed,<br>
 
 And riding on the army the half thereof shouldst slay,<br>
 
 Yet I will not at any time thee to the Turks betray.”<br>
 
  The ban spoke and departed, but he turned on the stallion white:<br>
 
  “Dervish, thou waterest thy steed at daybreak and at night<br>
 
 In the waters of Sítnitsa. Say where the fords are found—<br>
 
 The fords in the cool water—that my horse may not be drowned.”<br>
 
  Said the dervish: “Thou Servian falcon, a ford shalt thou find indeed,<br>
 
 Where’er thou enterest the water, for thy valor and thy steed.”<br>
 
  The ban forded that water; on the milk-white steed he sped<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 50------------------------>

 </p>
 
 Over the mount of Golech with the great sun overhead.<br>
 
 It warms all things beneath it, both the near and the far,<br>
 
 And it shines down on Kósovo and the army of the tsar.<br>
 
  And now behold Vlah Áliya, the strong and insolent,<br>
 
 Ban Strahin’s bride that kisses in the shadow of the tent.<br>
 
 He hath an evil custom, for ever does he fall<br>
 
 In slumber of a morning, when the sun beats over all.<br>
 
 He dreamed a dream upon that tide, and heavy lay his head<br>
 
 On the breast of the belovèd that Stráhinya had wed.<br>
 
 At the tent door she fondled him, but her eyes went to and fro<br>
 
 Over the Turkish army on the field of Kósovo.<br>
 
 She sees what manner are the tents, what steeds the heroes ride,<br>
 
 And by mischance towards Golech she turned her eyes aside.<br>
 
 She slapped the Turk on the right cheek; and, “Master,” did she cry,<br>
 
 “Rise up, Vlah Áliya! stir thyself! or forthwith mayst thou die!<br>
 
 Now belt thou on thy war-belt and thy fair mail likewise!<br>
 
 Ban Strahin comes that will cut off thine head, or blind thine eyes.”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 51------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  Vlah Áliya wakened from his dream and flashed up like the fire;<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>His eye was proud, he laughed aloud: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Thou Stráhinya’s desire,</td></tr></table>
 
 Thou art afraid, Wallachian maid; thou fearest him eachwhere!<br>
 
 When I bear thee unto Yedren, yet wilt thou see him there!<br>
 
 “Yon captain is not Strahin; a tsar’s man rideth here:<br>
 
 Either the tsar hath sent him, or Mehmet, the vizier.<br>
 
 He bids that I submit me, nor smite the host of the tsar.<br>
 
 Tsar and vizier, mayhap they fear to feel my scimitar.<br>
 
 Fear not, what time I smite him with the keen, shining sword<br>
 
 That no more captains of the tsar come hither for their lord.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But the ban’s bride spake unto him: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My master, prithee see!</td></tr></table>
 
 That is no Turkish captain—a blindness light on thee!—<br>
 
 Nay, but my master Strahin, that did my body clip.<br>
 
 Do I not know both eye and brow and the black beard of his lip?<br>
 
 Do I not know his milk-white horse with the spot of brown and tan,<br>
 
 <p>

 And the tawny hound beside him, the good hound Káraman?<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Jest not with life, my gallant lord.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>But when Vlah Áliya heard,</td></tr></table>
 
 The wrathful Turk leaped to his feet and straight began to gird:<br>
 
 His girdle with the poniards and the scimitar thereto.<br>
 
 And he giveth heed to the black steed, while the ban nearer drew.<br>
 
 The ban is very careful, but he cursed him, nor bowed his head<br>
 
 After the Turkish fashion; and unto him he said:<br>
 
  “Art thou then there, thou dastard—thou traitor to the tsar?<br>
 
 Whose women hast thou taken that round thy camp-fires are?<br>
 
 And whose belovèd hast thou kist in the shadow of the tent?<br>
 
 Come out to battle against me, thou strong and insolent.”<br>
 
  The Turk was very angry. He sprang with might and main<br>
 
 Unto the shoulder of the horse, and caught the bridle-rein.<br>
 
 The ban bode not his coming, but straight against him drove;<br>
 
 He lifted the iron spear on high, and hurled it from above.<br>
 
 And the strong Turk, Vlah Áliya, reached out and caught the spear,<br>
 
 <p>

 <table><tr><td>And he spake unto Strahin: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Dastard, what dost thou here?</td></tr></table>
 
 Here are no maids of Shúmadin to scatter with a cry,<br>
 
 But who fears not vizier or tsar, Vlah Áliya am I!<br>
 
 And I dread not any hero in the army of the tsar;<br>
 
 To me as ants upon the grass all in that army are.<br>
 
 And thou thinkest in the lists this tide to battle with me here!”<br>
 
  He spake and very suddenly he cast the battle-spear,<br>
 
 Eager to wound. But the good God aided Ban Strahin well.<br>
 
 His white steed, when the spear flew by, down on his knees he fell.<br>
 
 High overhead the great spear flashed, and broke on a stone in three.<br>
 
 Up to the boss that guards the hand was it broken utterly.<br>
 
 Now when the spears were broken, each champion drew his mace;<br>
 
 Vlah Áliya smote on Strahin and beat him from his place,<br>
 
 Forward from out of the saddle on the white neck of the steed.<br>
 
 Now the good God aided Strahin in the moment of his need.<br>
 
 Nor Turk, nor Serb a steed doth curb of half that worth to-day.<br>
 
 The beast swung head and shoulder in the middle of the fray,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 54------------------------>

 </p>
 
 And his lord out of that danger to the saddletree threw back;<br>
 
 And upon that Turkish devil the ban made his attack.<br>
 
 But the Turk out of the saddle would neither fall nor flee,<br>
 
 Though ’neath the blows his horse had sunk in the black dust to the knee.<br>
 
 The spiky maces in their hands were shattered left and right,<br>
 
 And forth they drew the sabers, and anew they fought the fight.<br>
 
 But lo, the great Ban Strahin at his belt had such a blade<br>
 
 That a pair of smiths must forge it with three men there to aid!<br>
 
 From Sunday unto Sunday till the steel was waxen cold<br>
 
 Had those same craftsmen cooled it within the earthen mold;<br>
 
 And thereafter had they sharpened it by laying on the sledge.<br>
 
 Smote the Turk, but Strahin waited edge against saber-edge,<br>
 
 Till he smote hard against it, and the Turk’s blade broke in half.<br>
 
 This saw the ban and in he ran, and in his heart did laugh<br>
 
 As he prest in upon him, smiting on either hand,<br>
 
 To strike his head from his shoulders with the edges of the brand.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 55------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Hero smote against hero; the Turk good ward he made,<br>
 
 He kept his head and shoulders with the truncheon of the blade.<br>
 
 With the remnant of his weapon he beat the saber back;<br>
 
 And bit by bit as he smote on it to pieces did he hack<br>
 
 The saber of Ban Strahin. Two blades in fragments lay.<br>
 
  Then leaped they from the horses, and hurled the hilts away.<br>
 
 They gripped each other by the throat like dragons at that tide;<br>
 
 All day till noon they wrestled upon the mountain side;<br>
 
 Till on the Turk’s pale lips the foam like snow new-fallen stood,<br>
 
 And the white foam on Strahin’s lip was flecked with drops of blood;<br>
 
 The blood upon his garments and on his jack-boots ran.<br>
 
 But when the pain had gripped him, at last out spake the ban:<br>
 
  “My love, God’s curse upon thee! What travail dost thou see?<br>
 
 Take up a splinter of the sword, and strike the Turk or me.<br>
 
 Think which of us, belovèd, is dearer unto thee.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But thereto the Turk spake fiercely: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Belovèd of the ban,</td></tr></table>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 56------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Strike him, for thou shalt never more be dear unto the man;<br>
 
 But aye his sharp reproaches against thee shall be bent,<br>
 
 Because thou once wast with me in the shadow of the tent.<br>
 
 But I will love thee always, nor ever thee disdain.<br>
 
 In Yedren thirty serving-maids shall bear thy sleeves and train;<br>
 
 Sugar and honey ever more shall be set for thee to eat;<br>
 
 With ducats will I deck thee from thy head unto thy feet:<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Strike now the ban.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All womankind are lightly led astray.</td></tr></table>
 
 She leaped and grasped a splinter of the sword-blade where it lay.<br>
 
 She wrapped it in a napkin, lest it should wound her hand,<br>
 
 And she sought to smite her wedded lord with the fragment of the brand,<br>
 
 And guard Vlah Áliya’s head. She cut the silver plume in twain;<br>
 
 She clove the milk-white turban that guarded him in vain;<br>
 
 The blood flowed down the hero’s face, and was like to blind his eyes,<br>
 
 And the ban dreaded sore that tide to die in foolish wise.<br>
 
 But suddenly within him the thoughts together ran,<br>
 
 <p>

 And out of his white throat he called on the hound Káraman—<br>
 
 A hound trained to the hunting. He called the hound by name,<br>
 
 And with a bound the tawny hound to help his master came,<br>
 
 And bit the ban’s belovèd. A dog all women fear;<br>
 
 She threw the blade upon the ground, and cuffed the hound on the ear.<br>
 
 Screaming she fled across the mount; afar they heard her cry;<br>
 
 But the strong Turk looked after to see where she did fly.<br>
 
 And new strength burst upon the ban, and courage great and new,<br>
 
 And hither and yon he drove the Turk, and wrestling overthrew.<br>
 
 Howe’er so hard the Turk might guard, he struck from underneath,<br>
 
 And, leaping in under the chin, he fastened with his teeth,<br>
 
 As the wolf throttling a lamb. Then he leaped up from the ground,<br>
 
 And with a mighty voice he called after the tawny hound,<br>
 
 That the beast should cease pursuing the maid the ban had wed;<br>
 
 And swift along the mountain to the Turkish host she fled.<br>
 
 But the ban would not let her; he caught her by the hand;<br>

 He brought her back unto the place where the dappled steed did stand.<br>
 
 He took the horse by the shoulders; he threw her on behind;<br>
 
 Then rode he deviously along, the homeward way to find.<br>
 
 Away from the tsar’s army he turned the bridle-rein,<br>
 
 Till he came in to his wife’s kin at Krúshevats on the plain,<br>
 
 And old Yug Bogdan and his sons rose, when they saw him come;<br>
 
 They took him to their bosoms, and gave him welcome home.<br>
 
 But when Yug Bogdan saw his plight his tears ran down amain:<br>
 
  “Now fair be all thy fortune, that thou art home again.<br>
 
 Strong are the Turkish heroes, the soldiers of the tsar;<br>
 
 A fighting man to wound the ban they must have sought afar.”<br>
 
  But the nine brothers feared him, till the ban to them spake:<br>
 
  “Dread nothing, my good brethren, nor be troubled for my sake.<br>
 
 With the tsar there was no hero to conquer me in fight.<br>
 
 Would ye then hear who wounded me, and whose hand did me smite?<br>
 
 When with the Turk I battled, O thou good father mine,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 59------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Then my belovèd smote me—this dearest child of thine;<br>
 
 She set aside my love that tide, and to the Turk gave aid.”<br>
 
  Yug flashed up like a living fire, and to his sons he said:<br>
 
 “Slash the she-wolf in pieces with the nine blades of the brands!”<br>
 
 The strong sons heard their father, and upon her set their hands.<br>
 
 But Strahin will not let them. He speaketh to them apace:<br>
 
  “My nine good brethren, wherefore do ye yourselves disgrace?<br>
 
 Why are your knives unscabbarded? Heroes ye are, I know!<br>
 
 But why were not your sabers with me at Kósovo,<br>
 
 To do great deeds against the Turk when danger ran most high?<br>
 
 And harken this, my brethren; your sister shall not die.<br>
 
 Without your aid already, all I wished, she had been slain.<br>
 
 Yet, should I slaughter all her kin, no comrade then would drain,<br>
 
 Reveling with me deliciously, the cool cups of the wine.<br>
 
 So now have I given my pardon unto this bride of mine.”<br>
 
  There are not many on earth to match him, man to man,<br>
 
 And scanty are the heroes as gallant as the ban.<br>
