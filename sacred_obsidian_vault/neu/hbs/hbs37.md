 <h2 align="center">THE MARRIAGE OF STOYAN YÁNKOVICH</h2>
 
 W<small>HILE</small> still men dreamed not of the dawn, the gates were opened wide<br>
 
 In Údbina, and from the town a squadron forth did ride.<br>
 
 Four and thirty friends are there; before them is Mustay Bey,<br>
 
 The lord of Lika;<a name="page_202_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_202_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> to Kunor wood he went to hunt that day.<br>
 
 For half a week he hunted, but nothing came to hand;<br>
 
 To Údbina and Lika he went homeward through the land;<br>
 
 When down through the fir forest to a spring be turned aside,<br>
 
 To drink and rest. He cast his eye ’neath a green fir that tide;<br>
 
 But when Mustay Bey of Lika came, the twigs of the fir tree shone.<br>
 
 A drunken warrior lay asleep in the fir wood alone;<br>
 
 All in the pure gold was he clad and in the silver fine;<br>
 
 On his head he wore a splendid cap with silver feathers nine,<br>
 
 And set beside the feathers a great wing silver-wrought;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 203------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 For a thousand ducats and no less the silver wing was bought.<br>
 
 On his shoulders the hero weareth a mantle great and green,<br>
 
 And thirty knobs of yellow gold thereon are to be seen,<br>
 
 Each one of a golden measure; and one ’neath the neck is worn,<br>
 
 Three measure weight with a screw that opes, and brandy that holds in the morn.<br>
 
 On the mantle are three golden plates, of the weight of four good pound;<br>
 
 Two were of twisted goldwork, and one did the smelters found.<br>
 
 His breeches had golden buckles; and yellow, rich to see,<br>
 
 Were his legs as any falcon’s from the ankle to the knee.<br>
 
 From the buckles hung fine golden chains, and from them trinkets fair,<br>
 
 Such as the slender maidens aye at their sweet throats wear.<br>
 
 At his splendid belt were pistols of the Damascus gold,<br>
 
 Silver-inlaid was the great blade, with three gold hilts to hold;<br>
 
 In them are set three precious stones; it is worth three towns of the tsar.<br>
 
 On his breast was a musket, and golden the thirty hoops of it are,<br>
 
 And each hoop worth ten ducats, and thirty, one by the sight;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 204------------------------>

 </p>
 
 There was more of gold on the musket than of steel hammered and bright.<br>
 
  When the hero rose upward from the grass, the fir twigs crackled then,<br>
 
 But the Bey of Lika pinned him down with his four and thirty men.<br>
 
 When the hero looked up from the grass with a black and lowering eye,<br>
 
 He saw that the Turks had pinned him down, and his weapons were not by.<br>
 
 One of his foes with his great arms he gripped as with a girth;<br>
 
 The living heart was burst in the Turk as he hurled him to the earth;<br>
 
 And seven others, moreover, he slaughtered of the band,<br>
 
 Before the Turks could master the strength of the white hand.<br>
 
 But they captured him, and forthwith the white hand did they bind,<br>
 
 And drove him to white Údbina with his weapons tied behind,<br>
 
 That great and small might marvel how Mustay, of Lika the Bey,<br>
 
 Such a warrior with his weapons had taken in the fray.<br>
 
 And Mustay spake to him as through the open field they came:<br>
 
  “God’s love! Whence comest thou, lord unknown? What do men call thy name?<br>
 
 Whither wast thou going, and whither have thy comrades gone away?”<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 <table><tr><td> Saith he: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“What sayst thou, Mustay, of Lika that art Bey?</td></tr></table>
 
 Hast thou heard of the Latin seacoast, and Kotári<a name="page_205_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_205_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> set thereon,<br>
 
 And of Stoyan, the son of Yanko? I am Stoyan, Yanko’s son,<br>
 
 And I had no other comrade than God and myself alone;<br>
 
 And I had taken counsel to descend beneath thy tower,<br>
 
 And the slender maiden, Haýkuna, to lure her in that hour,<br>
 
 And take her to Kotári—but it was not God’s decree;<br>
 
 The thrice accursèd liquor it overmastered me!”<br>
 
  Said Mustay, the Bey of Lika: “Stoyan, well mayst thou speed!<br>
 
 Thou hast fallen into a hero’s hands who will find thee a wife indeed!”<br>
 
  Amid their speech to Údbina at last they made their way,<br>
 
 Beneath the tower of Mustay, of Lika that was Bey;<br>
 
 And great and small came out to gaze on the squadron in that hour,<br>
 
 And Haýkuna, Mustay’s sister dear, looked down from the slender tower.<br>
 
 At the tambour frame of coral a needle of glass doth she hold,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 206------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And she weaveth through the linen white a gallant thread of gold.<br>
 
 And when she saw the squadron forth from the forest come,<br>
 
 That led a fettered hero with his shining weapons home,<br>
 
 The tambour frame before her with her hand she thrust away—<br>
 
 Two of its legs were shattered—and to herself did she say:<br>
 
  “Dear God, a mighty marvel, a hero in evil stead!<br>
 
 By what guile did they bind him, for he is not wounded nor dead?”<br>
 
  But when she reckoned the squadron, were lacking seven men.<br>
 
 When the squadron came ’neath the white tower, she took his weapons then,<br>
 
 And bore away his weapons in the treasury to keep.<br>
 
 Stoyan they cast in a prison that was fifty fathom deep;<br>
 
 Therein to the knees of the hero the water doth arise,<br>
 
 And the bones of captive Christians to his shoulder reach likewise.<br>
 
 The bey went unto the new inn, with his men the wine to drain,<br>
 
 And to boast to the Turks of Údbina what a captive he had ta’en.<br>
 
 The fair maid went to the dungeon door with a bucket of wine that tide;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 207------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 She lowered it with a strong cord, and unto the hero cried:<br>
 
  “O hero, God protect thee, nor slay thee here in shame!<br>
 
 Whence art thou? what is thy country? what dost thou call thy name?<br>
 
 How did the Turks deceive thee, when thine arms behind they tied?”<br>
 
  Stoyan drank of the yellow wine, and to the damsel cried:<br>
 
  “Who calls from the white dungeon? My throat hath drunken full.<br>
 
 With the windlass half way up the hold the hero shalt thou pull;<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>From thence will I tell the story.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>The maiden harkened thereto;</td></tr></table>
 
 The rope with hooks of steel let down, and half way up she drew.<br>
 
 Stoyan the son of Yanko. He questioned her and said:<br>
 
 “Who calls from the white dungeon?” Then appeared the Turkish maid:<br>
 
 “Even I, unknown hero, the sister of Mustay Bey.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Stoyan answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“O Haýkuna, may God in heaven thee slay!</td></tr></table>
 
 I am Stoyan the son of Yanko, and in prison because of thee.<br>
 
 The Turks beguiled me when I was drunk, and bound have they taken me.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The Turkish maid spake to him: </td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td>
 
 <!------------------------page 208------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a>
 
 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“O Stoyan, of Yanko born,</td></tr></table>
 
 Fain would the Turks destroy thee. They will question thee tomorn<br>
 
 Whether to be a Moslem thy faith thou wilt put aside.<br>
 
 Become a Moslem, Stoyan; and I will be thy bride.<br>
 
 My brother, the Bey of Lika, two treasure towers hath he,<br>
 
 One his, one mine; if he dieth first, mine and thine shall they be.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Spake Stoyan: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Thou: damsel, Haýkuna, no more like a mad girl rave!</td></tr></table>
 
 Though Údbina and Lika into my hand they gave,<br>
 
 By God I would not turn Moslem! In Kotári my treasure lay,<br>
 
 More than the Turks’, and a hero better am I than they.<br>
 
 If God it grant, fair damsel, before the noon hour ring,<br>
 
 The captains of Kotári over Údbina shall spring,<br>
 
 Over and roundabout it, and hence shall they rescue me.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said the maid: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Speak not like a madman; ere that they will slaughter thee.</td></tr></table>
 
 But to take me to be thy wedded wife, firm will thy faith remain,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>If I free thee out of the dungeon?” </td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td>
 
 <!------------------------page 209------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a>
 
 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>And Stoyan answered again:</td></tr></table>
 
  “Firm is my faith, fair damsel, I will take thee before all;<br>
 
 Verily on mine honor I will not deceive thee at all.”<br>
 
  When the damsel heard, in the prison she lowered him in that hour,<br>
 
 And she wended her own way forthwith unto the slender tower.<br>
 
 A little time went after this; from the inn came forth the bey,<br>
 
 And the maiden staggered before him, as a fit were on her that day.<br>
 
 Mustay the Bey asked of her: “What aileth thee, sister dear?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>She said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“A pain of the head and the heart is fallen upon me here;</td></tr></table>
 
 A chill is come upon me; ’twere better, brother, to die.<br>
 
 But seat thee on the soft cushions, that I on thy breast may lie,<br>
 
 And there at last surrender my spirit in its sin.”<br>
 
  Mustay the Bey was sorry, for he had no other kin,<br>
 
 And over his white features the bitter tears he shed.<br>
 
 He sat upon the cushions, on his bosom she drooped her head;<br>
 
 One hand she laid on his bosom, with the other did she seize<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 210------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 In her dear brother’s pocket the stable and prison keys,<br>
 
 And the key of the treasure likewise. Then tossed she where she lay<br>
 
 On the cushion, and to his sister made question Mustay the Bey:<br>
 
 “Has not God granted thee, sister, that the pain should pass away?”<br>
 
 “Brother, he has, may God be thanked!” And he went to the roof outside,<br>
 
 To counsel with them of Údbina how Stoyan should die that tide.<br>
 
  But the maiden leaped to her feet, and wide the treasury door she threw;<br>
 
 And saddlebags of ducats and Stoyan’s armor, too,<br>
 
 She gathered in that hour from the dungeon white and cold.<br>
 
 She let out Stoyan, and led him from the cellars of the hold;<br>
 
 And released the steeds from the stables: the good white steed of the bey,<br>
 
 That ever more he rode upon in the heroic fray,<br>
 
 And the black steed of his lady; swifter is none in the land.<br>
 
 The damsel mounted the white, but the black is under Stoyan’s hand,<br>
 
 And forthwith over the broad field swiftly they got them gone<br>
 
 Over Ogóryelitsa, and from Kunor the wood, and on<br>
 
 From Kunor to Kótari. Then the son of Yanko said:<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 211------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  “Grievously am I weary, O Haýkuna the maid!<br>
 
 Dismount from the white charger; of sleep I have sore need.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But she said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“By thy courage, Stoyan! Drive forward the black steed</td></tr></table>
 
 On unto flat Kotári; sleep cometh with little aid.<br>
 
 But for some squadron of the Turks yet am I sore afraid!”<br>
 
  But he harkened not. From the horses they descended on the grass;<br>
 
 With his head on her bosom Stoyan slept; like a foolish lamb he was.<br>
 
 But the maiden cannot slumber. Before the white day’s hour<br>
 
 The bey’s wife rose to visit the girl in the slender tower.<br>
 
 Very sick was the damsel, when darkness fell yestreen,<br>
 
 But now in the slender tower no more the girl is seen;<br>
 
 And the money from the treasury is gathered up and gone,<br>
 
 And no longer in the dungeon lieth Stoyan, Yanko’s son.<br>
 
 Forthwith came back the woman into the slender tower;<br>
 
 She fired the great alarum gun suddenly in that hour.<br>
 
 On the green roof the bey heard it; what was come to pass he knew,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 212------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And swiftly with his fingers he searched his pockets through,<br>
 
 And found that from his pockets the keys were stolen away.<br>
 
  “My brothers, men of Údbina!” then shouted Mustay Bey,<br>
 
 “Stoyan, the son of Yanko, with the maid is fled abroad.<br>
 
 Up on your feet, my brethren, as ye believe in God!”<br>
 
  Strange is the Turkish use. Their steeds were ready saddled there;<br>
 
 They seized their steeds and over the wide field did they fare.<br>
 
 They reached the Kunor wood, and through the forest did they pass<br>
 
 Unto Kotári. Haýkuna looked up from the green grass;<br>
 
 Often she looked to Kunor. A crest rose far away,<br>
 
 The dust of horses and heroes, and she knew her brother, the bey,<br>
 
 And the thirty men of Údbina. Stoyan she dares not wake,<br>
 
 But above the face of Stoyan she weepeth for his sake.<br>
 
 When Stoyan started from slumber, he bespake her in this wise:<br>
 
  “What ails thee, Turkish damsel, that the tears run from thine eyes?<br>
 
 Dost thou weep for thy brother, Mustay Bey, and his great treasury?<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 213------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Or haply is it that Stoyan no longer pleases thee?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Quoth the maiden: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Sorrow-stricken may thy mother be this tide!</td></tr></table>
 
 I weep not for my brother nor the treasure of his pride.<br>
 
 We have brought the treasure with us, in the midst of my heart art thou;<br>
 
 But the bey with the thirty of Údbina is hard upon us now.<br>
 
 Ride the black to Kotári; our lives are thrown away!”<br>
 
 When Stoyan heard the damsel, unto her did he say:<br>
 
  “By God, I will not, maiden! They have stirred my anger up;<br>
 
 They pinned me down on the grass when I had drunken of the cup.<br>
 
 Now will I make exchange of gifts with thy brother, dear indeed!<br>
 
 Do thou ride the black charger, and give me the white steed;<br>
 
 The white is a little better, when I go thy brother to meet.”<br>
 
  Stoyan leapt on the good white steed; the black she mounted fleet,<br>
 
 And galloped to white Kotári; but Stoyan against the bey.<br>
 
 And it were worth the trouble, to sit and watch the fray,<br>
 
 And behold a mighty marvel, how thirty smote at one:<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 214------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 The palace that sent thirty forth waits the return of none.<br>
 
 Stoyan smote off the thirty heads, and he seized on Mustay Bey;<br>
 
 Hands bound behind, he drove him to where the damsel lay.<br>
 
 He spake to the damsel as he drew the silver-hilted blade:<br>
 
 “Thus, Haýkuna, ’twixt brothers exchange of gifts is made!”<br>
 
 He swung the silver-hilted sword, but she threw her arms on high:<br>
 
  “By thy courage, leave a sister a brother for swearing by!<br>
 
 For thee also a sister might weep, and be full of woe.<br>
 
 Turn him now back to Údbina, and give him leave to go.”<br>
 
  Stoyan turned back the saber; tighter he bound the bey,<br>
 
 And set his face toward Údbina, and unto him did say:<br>
 
  “When thou comest unto Údbina, to drink with the men thereby,<br>
 
 Tell thou the whole truth to them, nor ever speak a lie;<br>
 
 And here will I grant thy life to thee in the fierce single fray.”<br>
 
  Forth in his bonds to Údbina alone went back the bey;<br>
 
 <p>

 But to flat Kotári Stoyan the Turkish damsel takes,<br>
 
 And his christened wife he kisses whensoever he awakes.<br>
