 <h2 align="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE SWORD OF VUKÁSHIN</h2>
 
 T<small>HE</small> sultan with an army is come to Kósovo;<br>
 
 An hundred thousand men had he where Sítnitsa doth flow.<br>
 
 With a saber of Damascus his herald goeth forth,<br>
 
 And full three hundred ducats the naked blade is worth;<br>
 
 And likewise was the scabbard worth ducats fifteen score,<br>
 
 And the cost of the cord of the scabbard three hundred ducats more.<br>
 
 No one was found for money to buy that scimitar,<br>
 
 But chance brought the Prince Marko on the herald of the tsar.<br>
 
 Said Marko: “The Damascus blade, thou herald, show to me.”<br>
 
 The herald heard and gave over the blade, but not a word said he.<br>
 
 Marko said to the herald, as he looked on the saber cold:<br>
 
  “Forty-five score of ducats will I give thee of yellow gold;<br>
 
 But harken, herald, let us go to some safe place hereabout,<br>
 
 That I may count before thee the yellow ducats out,<br>
 
 For I would not ungird me of the three gold belts this tide,<br>
 
 Since I am much in the Turkish debt in the camp on every side,<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 And I deem that for the saber they will not let me pay.”<br>
 
  The Turk would hardly await him, and hastened on the way,<br>
 
 And along the water of Sítnitsa they speedily are gone.<br>
 
 Prince Marko there ungirded him ’neath the white bridge of stone;<br>
 
 He spread a mantle of the green, he took the belts of gold,<br>
 
 And out he shook the golden belts while the Turk the ducats told.<br>
 
 Marko looked on the saber, and saw thereon displayed<br>
 
 Three Christian words engraven upon the shining blade;<br>
 
 And first “The Saint Demetrius,” and next “The Archangel” came,<br>
 
 And last of all upon the blade stood King Vukáshin’s name.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Marko saw and forthwith spake: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“O herald of the tsar,</td></tr></table>
 
 By the one God I adjure thee; whence came the scimitar?<br>
 
 Was it left by thy father? Did thy wife bring it to thee?<br>
 
 Or was it won in battle, perchance, from an enemy?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The Turk spake unto Marko: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“By God, thou chief unknown,</td></tr></table>

 Unto thee now the inward of this matter will I own.<br>
 
 It was not left by my father, my wife brought it not to me;<br>
 
 But, chief unknown, I won it from a single enemy.<br>
 
 When with the Servian empire fell both tsars at Kósovo,<br>
 
 Murad and Lazar, then I won the saber from the foe.<br>
 
 Early to water my fat steed to Sítnitsa I went,<br>
 
 And there my fortune brought me to a green silken tent.<br>
 
 Within was a wounded warrior most fierce—God strike him dead!—<br>
 
 The black beard of his lip that tide over his breast it spread.<br>
 
 He wore a great green mantle, and by him lay the sword.<br>
 
 When the wounded one beheld me, by God he me implored:<br>
 
  “ ‘Brother, thou champion unknown, now smite not off mine head;<br>
 
 Soon will my soul go from me, for my wounds are deep and dread.<br>
 
 Wait half an hour; by Sítnitsa there shalt thou set my grave.<br>
 
 Three belts of gold are on me, and a Damascus glaive<br>
 
 That is worth a thousand ducats, and here is my silken tent.’<br>
 
  “But I would not harken his prayer, and out with him I went,<br>
 
 <p>

 Dragging the wounded hero. My saber then I drew,<br>
 
 And cut off his head; his leg I grasped, and his arm, and straightway threw<br>
 
 The hero into Sítnitsa, where swiftly the waters run.<br>
 
 There with the marvelous booty this saber for thee I won.”<br>
 
  When the Prince Marko heard it, to the herald did he say:<br>
 
  “O herald of the Turkish tsar, may God reward thee this day!<br>
 
 That was my own dear father, even Vukáshin, the king.<br>
 
 Hadst thou waited his soul’s departure, it had been a better thing,<br>
 
 And thou, O Turkish herald, wouldst have had a better grave.”<br>
 
  He drew, and cut the Turk’s head off with the Damascus glaive.<br>
 
 He grasped the milk-white hand and leg, and in Sítnitsa he threw<br>
 
 The herald of the tsar and said: “Go thou my father unto!”<br>
 
 To the army Marko wended with the gold and the scimitar;<br>
 
 Said the janissaries: “Prithee, where is the herald of the tsar?”<br>
 
 But to them said Marko: “I pray you, janissaries, begone!<br>
 
 He took his ducats and pennies to the sea to trade thereon.”<br>

 Said the Turks one to the other: “Hard must the Moslem strive,<br>
 
 Who cometh to Prince Marko a bargain with him to drive!”<br>
