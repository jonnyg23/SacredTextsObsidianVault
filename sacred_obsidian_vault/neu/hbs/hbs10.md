 <h2 align="center">TSAR LAZAR AND TSÁRITSA MÍLITSA</h2>
 
 T<small>SAR</small> L<small>AZAR</small> sat at dinner; and with him at the wine<br>
 
 Sat Mílitsa, the Tsáritsa, beside her lord to dine.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Unto her lord said Mílitsa: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“O Servia’s king and crown,</td></tr></table>
 
 To-morrow unto Kósovo the army goeth down,<br>
 
 Thy voývodas and captains. No man thou leavest at home<br>
 
 With a letter to go to Kósovo and hither again to come.<br>
 
 Thou leadest my nine brethren, Yug Bogdan’s children nine.—<br>
 
 Leave me one brother of them all to cheer this heart of mine.”<br>
 
  To her spake Lazar of the Serbs: “Which wilt thou have with thee<br>
 
 In the palace?” And she made answer: “Let Boshko stay with me.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Then spake Tsar Lazar: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Lady, to-morrow, when day comes on,</td></tr></table>
 
 And the white dawn breaketh, and the world is warmed of the great sun,<br>
 
 And they open the gates of the city, go thou unto the arch,<br>
 
 Wherethrough unto the muster my hosts begin to march.<br>
 
 The spears shine over the chargers: before them will Boshko ride,<br>
 
 <p>

 And he carries high the standard with a great cross glorified.<br>
 
 Bless him! Let give the standard to whomsoever he will;<br>
 
 But let him back to the palace, abiding with thee still.”<br>
 
  Now when the gates were opened, what time the morning shone,<br>
 
 Then forth unto the gateway Queen Mílitsa came down,<br>
 
 And stood beneath the portal in the shadow of the arch,<br>
 
 What time unto the muster the host began to march.<br>
 
 The spears shone over the chargers: before them Boshko rode<br>
 
 On a bay steed, and his rich weed with shining goldwork glowed,<br>
 
 And the standard that he carried swept round him fold on fold;<br>
 
 Over the steed it bellied; thereon was an apple of gold;<br>
 
 From the apple rose gilded crosses, and tassels from them did hang,<br>
 
 And brushed against his shoulders as in the wind they swang.<br>
 
 Queen Mílitsa sprang forward to the bay stallion’s head,<br>
 
 And she clasped arms round her brother, and unto him she said:<br>
 
  “My brother Boshko, thou art become the tsar his gift to me.<br>
 
 <p>

 Thou shalt not go to Kósovo; he gives his blessing to thee;<br>
 
 Thou shalt give the golden banner to the hero of thy will,<br>
 
 And be my brother in Krúshevats, that I may have thee still.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Boshko answered her straightway: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Get back to thy hall this tide!</td></tr></table>
 
 I would not turn nor give up the flag with the great cross glorified,<br>
 
 Though the tsar should give me Krúshevats for ever and a day;<br>
 
 For the remnant of the army concerning me would say:<br>
 
  “ ‘Where is the captain, Boshko—that same I that dared not go<br>
 
 To perish for Christ his Cross and Faith on the field of Kósovo?’ ”<br>
 
  And forthwith he rode the stallion abroad beneath the arch;<br>
 
 And lo, Yug Bogdan and seven sons began thereby to march!<br>
 
 She stopped each of the seven to whom her heart did yearn,<br>
 
 But none of all the seven aside for her would turn.<br>
 
 With the tsar’s chargers Voin, her brother, came that way;<br>
 
 All covered with a panoply of shining gold were they.<br>
 
 She seized the dun steed under him, and took him by the head;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 63------------------------>

 </p>
 
 She took her brother in her arms, and unto him she said:<br>
 
  “My brother Voin, thou art become the tsar his gift to me;<br>
 
 Thou shalt not go to Kósovo; he gives his blessing to thee.<br>
 
 Thou shalt give the tsar’s war horses to the hero of thy will,<br>
 
 And be my brother in Krúshevats, that I may have thee still.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Voin answered her straightway: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Get back to thy hall this tide!</td></tr></table>
 
 I would not turn nor give over the steeds that the tsar shall ride;<br>
 
 What though in wisdom I foresaw all of my overthrow,<br>
 
 I would ride to death for the Cross and the Faith on level Kósovo.”<br>
 
  Forthwith right through the gateway he spurred the charger well;<br>
 
 And when the queen that sight had seen, on the stone in a swoon she fell.<br>
 
 And when King Lazar saw it, the tears ran down his face;<br>
 
 And he looked and called Golúban, his henchman, from his place:<br>
 
  “Golúban, my good henchman, dismount thee in this hour,<br>
 
 And bear thy lady in thine arms up to the slender tower.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 64------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 For this the deed of my command God’s pardon shalt thou find;<br>
 
 Thou shalt not go to Kósovo, but linger here behind.”<br>
 
  Weeping, Golúban heard it. He dismounted in that hour;<br>
 
 He bore his lady in his arms up to the slender tower;<br>
 
 But his will he could not overcome, nor bear to linger so,<br>
 
 But steed bestrode, and hard he rode away to Kósovo.<br>
 
  When rose up the white morning, from Kósovo there wheeled<br>
 
 A pair of great black ravens from the broad battlefield;<br>
 
 They perched on the white palace whence Lazar issued forth;<br>
 
 The one cawed loud and vainly, the one spake words of worth:<br>
 
  “Is this Tsar Lazar’s palace, where he was wont to dwell?<br>
 
 Is there no man or woman within the citadel?”<br>
 
  None heard but the Queen Mílitsa; she came before the wall,<br>
 
 And unto those two ravens her voice aloud did call:<br>
 
  “I conjure you, black ravens, sitting upon the coign,<br>
 
 From whence come ye this morning? Did ye see the armies join?<br>
 
 Have the armies smitten together in the field of Kósovo?<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 65------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 In God his name I conjure you, who hath the overthrow?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> And the black ravens answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“At Kósovo, O queen,</td></tr></table>
 
 Two hosts that smote at Kósovo, we saw them fight yestreen.<br>
 
 Both tsars are down; and of the Turks a remnant doth remain,<br>
 
 But all the Serbs are slaughtered, or wounded on the plain.”<br>
 
  They spoke; and lo, Milútin came before the queen to stand!<br>
 
 Wounded full sore, the henchman bore one hand in the other hand;<br>
 
 Seventeen wounds were on him; his steed with blood was red.<br>
 
 And unto him the weeping queen rough words in anger said:<br>
 
 “What treachery, Milútin, is this unto the tsar?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But he said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Help me down, lady, from the great steed of war;</td></tr></table>
 
 Lave me with the cool water, and with the ruddy wine,<br>
 
 Do thou, O royal lady, anoint these wounds of mine.”<br>
 
  Queen Mílitsa she lifted him down from the steed of war;<br>
 
 She laved him with white water, and red wine from the jar.<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 And when he was himself again, she questioned him withal:<br>
 
  “Ah, what betid at Kósovo? Did the Tsar Lazar fall?<br>
 
 My father and my brethren, are they fallen on the plain?<br>
 
 Lord Milosh, and Vuk Bránkovich, and Strahin, are they slain?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The servant spake: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My lady, they are dead at Kósovo,</td></tr></table>
 
 Where Lazar the tsar glorious fell in the overthrow.<br>
 
 The Turk and Servian lances lie shattered everywhere,<br>
 
 But many more of Christian spears, alas, were broken there,<br>
 
 Defending good Tsar Lazar in the fury of the fray.<br>
 
 But Yug Bogdan perished, lady, in the fight of the first day;<br>
 
 Eight of his sons, those champions, were slaughtered side by side;<br>
 
 For they would not use treachery, and by each other died.<br>
 
 Still Boshko’s banner of the cross hurled back the Turks in droves,<br>
 
 To and fro over Kósovo, as a falcon harries doves.<br>
 
 Where the blood flowed up to the knee died Stráhinya the ban;<br>
 
 By Sítnitsa fell Milosh, where the cool waters ran.<br>
 
 There perished many Turks amain; and Milosh in his ire<br>

 Hath slain the Sultan Murad—God be gracious to his sire!—<br>
 
 And a good twelve thousand Turks that tide. And aye the Serbs will know<br>
 
 His deeds of war while men are left to tell of Kósovo.<br>
 
 But ask not of the cursèd Vuk! May God’s damnation burst<br>
 
 Upon his sire and all his tribe, and the whole house accurst!<br>
 
 ’Twas he betrayed the tsar in war unto the Turkish spear,<br>
 
 And fled with his twelve thousand men, the traitor cavalier!”<br>
