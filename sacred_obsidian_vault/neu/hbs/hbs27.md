 <h2 align="center">PRINCE MARKO AND BEY KOSTADIN</h2>
 
 P<small>RINCE</small> M<small>ARKO</small> and Bey Kostádin, brothers in God were they;<br>
 
 They rode their steeds together. Outspoke Kostádin the Bey:<br>
 
  “Prince Marko, now I prithee, thou art my brother sworn;<br>
 
 Come to me in the autumn, on St. Demetrius’ morn,<br>
 
 The feast day of my patron saint. Much honor wilt thou see,<br>
 
 And a fair feast and a welcome becoming my degree.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said Marko: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Boast not of thy feast! When I sought for my brother born,</td></tr></table>
 
 Ándriya, I dwelt in autumn with thee. On St. Demetrius’ morn,<br>
 
 The feast day of thy patron saint, I saw the feast of thy pride,<br>
 
 And also in the selfsame hour three cruel deeds beside.”<br>
 
  Said Bey Kostádin: “Marko, my brother sworn art thou;<br>
 
 Say to me of what cruel deeds thou speakest to me now.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said Marko: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“The first cruel deed after this wise befell.</td></tr></table>
 
 There came two orphans unto thee that thou mightst feed them well<br>

 With the white bread, and give them the ruddy wine to drain.<br>
 
 But thou saidst: ‘Ye mere scull of the earth, now get you hence amain!<br>
 
 Ye shall not defile the wine before my gentlefolk this day.’<br>
 
 Bey, I pitied the orphans and with them went away;<br>
 
 And I took them to the market and fed them on white bread,<br>
 
 And gave them to drink of the ruddy wine, and clad them in satin red,<br>
 
 And in green silk moreover. Unto thy house again<br>
 
 I sent them, and looked to see thee, how them thou wouldst entertain.<br>
 
 One thou tookest on either hand; to the table thou leddest them then:<br>
 
 ‘Eat and drink,’ thou saidst, ‘ye sons of gentlemen!’<br>
 
  “Thy second cruel deed was this. When ancient squires forlorn<br>
 
 Came there, who had lost their money, and whose scarlet was outworn,<br>
 
 Thou evermore didst set them at the foot of the table there;<br>
 
 But whoso of the younger squires at thy festival that were,<br>
 
 Who had gained new hordes of money, and whose scarlet was fresh and new,<br>
 
 Evermore thou broughtest them the head of the board unto;<br>

 Thou didst pour the wine and brandy before them fast and free;<br>
 
 There was a feast and welcome, befitting thy degree.<br>
 
  “This is thy third cruel deed, O bey. Father and mother are thine;<br>
 
 Neither is ever at thy board nor draineth first the wine.”<br>
