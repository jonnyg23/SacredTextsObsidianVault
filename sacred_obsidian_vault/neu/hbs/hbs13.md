 <h2 align="center">HOW MILOSH ÓBILICH SLEW THE SULTAN MURAD</h2>
 
 T<small>SAR</small> M<small>URAD</small> sat beneath his tent with the pashas of his power<br>
 
 And his viziers, and counsel took what way to smite the Giaour<br>
 
 And win with least disaster; when lo there came from afar<br>
 
 The vizier Osman running to claim reward of the tsar.<br>
 
 He kissed the hand and the garment, himself to the earth he bowed,<br>
 
 And thus to Murad, the Turkish tsar, the vizier spake aloud:<br>
 
  “Murad, the Sun of all the East, holy Mahomet’s heir!<br>
 
 Rejoice! the Servian empire thou hast conquered everywhere!<br>
 
 Here come three Servian voývodas that have chiefly made us fear;<br>
 
 They come hither to surrender, for down have they turned the spear.”<br>
 
  It pleased the Sultan Murad; it was pleasant in his ears;<br>
 
 Woes plagued him not. He spake unto the pashas and viziers:<br>
 
  “Brave pashas, glorious viziers, my captains of command,<br>
 
 Shall I reach to the Wallachians my foot or my white hand?”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 82------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  Said the viziers: “O glorious lord, put not thy hand to shame;<br>
 
 Shame were it to reach out to one of the Wallachian name!<br>
 
 Stretch out thy foot unto them, and let them kiss it sweet,<br>
 
 And let them be forever at all times ’neath thy feet.”<br>
 
  Outspake Vizier Ushtúgliya: “Tsar Murad, our crown of gold,<br>
 
 shall we go out before them?” Then answered Murad the bold:<br>
 
  “Go out to the field before them, and three great cloths unfold;<br>
 
 Stretch one of red, the second of white, the third green glorious.<br>
 
 When the slaves drive on their horses, if they come to fight with us,<br>
 
 All three of the cloths beneath their feet will they trample under here.<br>
 
 If they bring me the keys of the cities and the taxes for seven year,<br>
 
 On the red cloth will they trample, the red and the white beside,<br>
 
 But the green will they lift on their lances and thereunder will they ride.”<br>
 
  When the tsar’s troopers heard it, before the three they flew;<br>
 
 Before the Servian voývodas the three great cloths they drew.<br>
 
 When the voývodas drove on the steeds, they trampled the cloths all three;<br>
 
 <p>

 <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And when Ushtúgliya saw it, to Murad the tsar said he:<br>
 
  “Lo, tsar, the servants of Lazar have trampled every cloth!<br>
 
 Under foot have they trampled them, for a sign that they are wroth,<br>
 
 And desire to-day their quarrel to undertake with thee,<br>
 
 Tsar Murad; they bring not bither of any city the key.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> The bold Tsar Murad answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Not so, my children brave!</td></tr></table>
 
 Had they been eager to quarrel, long since had they drawn the glaive;<br>
 
 Drunk are the Giaours, and in drunkenness have trampled the cloth amain.”<br>
 
  Meanwhile with his brethren was Milosh come, on his steed, the Crane.<br>
 
 Down he got from the charger, and out the tsar’s grooms flew<br>
 
 To hold the Crane for Milosh; no rein to them he threw,<br>
 
 He gave him to Ivan Kósanchich. To the tent of Murad the strong<br>
 
 Forthwith Milosh the voývoda went hastily along.<br>
 
 Murad stretched out his foot to him over the tapestries,<br>
 
 And spoke, for he deemed that Milosh desired his face to kiss:<br>
 
  “Now fair and soft, now soft and fair, O Lazar’s follower;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 84------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Trample not on my garment’s edge, but kiss my boot and spur.”<br>
 
  Milosh flashed like a living fire, like a wolf on Murad he sprang;<br>
 
 Over him like a hayduk the biting blade he swang;<br>
 
 From the midriff to the milk-white throat the tsar alive he rent.<br>
 
 Murad gaped wordless on the ground; and underneath the tent<br>
 
 Flashing like lightning hither and yon the blade of Milosh went.<br>
 
 He slaughtered all the tsar’s viziers, Ushtúgliya he slew;<br>
 
 He smote the tsar’s twelve guardsmen and the tent ropes clove in two.<br>
 
 The bodyguard from Yedren, all of them had he slain;<br>
 
 Seventy heads had he smitten off ere he mounted his steed, the Crane.<br>
 
  Then mounted the three sworn brethren and charged through Kósovo.<br>
 
 Dear God, their onslaught on the Turk was no cheap overthrow!<br>
 
 When blood began a-flowing, ’twas good nearby to stand<br>
 
 And see how the Turkish heads split wide beneath the Servian brand.<br>
 
 Fierce slashed the Servian voývodas, they slashed the Turks like grass:<br>
 
 Whither went Milan Tóplitsa, was room for a wain to pass;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 85------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Whither went Ivan Kósanchich, lightly had two moved on;<br>
 
 Whither went Milosh Óbilich, abreast could three have gone.<br>
 
 The whole of the Turkish host boiled up, rushing to bar their track;<br>
 
 The voývodas trampled the army like the earth hard and black.<br>
 
 Shame to the Turks not to have ta’en their vengeance for the tsar!<br>
 
 ’Neath the standard of Mahomet the whole host came in war;<br>
 
 The pashas and fierce warriors, they flew into the fight<br>
 
 Upon their faëry chargers, the heroes good to smite.<br>
 
 But Milosh and his comrades with the keen blade cut their way.<br>
 
 A saber cuts not a mountain down in the swift course of a day,<br>
 
 Nor the voývodas all the army—and Milan Tóplitsa cried:<br>
 
 “Avenge me, Milosh! At Kósovo have I failed to-day at thy side.”<br>
 
 But Milosh answered softly: “I forgive thee readily,<br>
 
 My brother Milan; quickly shall I lie there by thee.”<br>
 
 Furiously the Turks set on, till Ivan Kósanchich cried:<br>
 
  “Farewell, Milosh! At Kósovo have I perished at thy side.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 86------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Avenge me, Milosh, who swarest my brother sworn to be!”<br>
 
  But Milosh the good voývoda, O softly answered he!<br>
 
  “My brother, Ivan, for this gift I hope in perfect faith,<br>
 
 For never yet was gallant man but yearned for a gallant death.”<br>
 
  And the faëry steed he goaded, the battle-charger, the Crane;<br>
 
 He maddened on the maddened steed and smote the Turks again.<br>
 
 Like a dragon over Kósovo the voývoda did pass,<br>
 
 With the hot blood of the cursèd Turks he reddened all the grass.<br>
 
 Furious and shamefaced was the host, yet unavenged for the tsar<br>
 
 ’Neath the standard of Mahomet the whole host came in war<br>
 
 On Milosh the weary hero. Of wounds he got no lack;<br>
 
 They beat him from his steed and bound his hands behind his back.<br>
 
 And unto the Tsar Murad, Milosh they led along:<br>
 
  “Here is Milosh the voývoda for thee, Tsar Murad the strong!<br>
 
 Do thou tell us, Lord Glorious, in what wise we shall him slay.”<br>
 
  Murad still lived; unto them in a soft voice did he say:<br>
 
  “Be ye not angry with him, and do not strike him down<br>

 </p>
 
 For that he slew me; fortune of battle brought it on<br>
 
 That a good hero slew me. Now draw up the host to war,<br>
 
 And smite the Giaour! Let not his power outlive the Servian tsar!”<br>
