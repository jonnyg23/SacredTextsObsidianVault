 <h2 align="center">THE CAPTIVITY OF STOYAN YÁNKOVICH</h2>
 
 W<small>HEN</small> the Turks took Kotári, great havoc did they make<br>
 
 With the house of Yánkovich Íliya Smílyanich did they take<br>
 
 And likewise Stoyan Yánkovich; bereft was Íliya’s bride<br>
 
 Of fifteen days; ungently from his wife’s youthful side<br>
 
 Was Stoyan taken also, ere a week they had been wed.<br>
 
 The Turks to Stamboul city captive the husbands led.<br>
 
 To the tsar whom all men honor, with the prisoners of their spears<br>
 
 Came the Turks; and the two were holden for the space of nine long years<br>
 
 And seven months. And Moslems the tsar hath made them there,<br>
 
 And likewise built them houses beside his palace fair.<br>
 
  Spake Íliya Smílyanich: “Stoyan, dear brother,” did he say,<br>
 
 “To-morrow will be Friday, the Turkish holiday;<br>
 
 The tsáritsa walks with the Turkish dames and the tsar with the Turks at heel.<br>
 
 Do thou steal the key of the treasury, and the stable key will I steal;<br>
 
 Let us gather the guardless treasure and take two steeds amain,<br>
 
 And run to level Kotári and see our wives again,<br>
 
 <p>

 That never enemy caressed nor foeman carried away.”<br>
 
  They harkened each other. On the morn of the Turkish holiday<br>
 
 The tsáritsa walked with the Turkish dames and the tsar with the Turks at heel.<br>
 
 One stole the treasury key, and one did the key of the stable steal;<br>
 
 They took much treasure and two good steeds, and to flat Kotári fled.<br>
 
 When they were near Kotári, Stoyan Yánkovich said:<br>
 
  “O Íliya, my dear brother, unto the white house go;<br>
 
 And I will unto the vineyard that mine own hand did sow,<br>
 
 That I may look on the vineyard, to see who binds the vine<br>
 
 And prunes it—in whose possession the place has gone from mine.”<br>
 
  To the white house went Íliya, to the vineyard Stoyan came;<br>
 
 In the vineyard he found his mother, the weary and ancient dame.<br>
 
 And standing in the vineyard she cut the strands of her hair,<br>
 
 And with them to the stanchions she bound the grapevines there,<br>
 
 And with tears she watered the vine sprouts and the tendrils where they twined,<br>
 
 And ever her own son Stoyan was present in her mind:<br>

  “Stoyan, my golden apple, is forgot of his mother old;<br>
 
 But I will remember Yela his wife, fair as the unworn gold!”<br>
 
  Stoyan in God’s name greeted her: “Old dame, whom God defend!—<br>
 
 Hast thou none younger than thyself for thee the vines to tend?<br>
 
 Thou totterest wretched and feeble.” But bravely she replied:<br>
 
  “Live well, thou unknown champion, and all good thee betide!<br>
 
 I have none younger save Stoyan, sole son of my desire.<br>
 
 The Turks took him with Íliya, the nephew of his sire;<br>
 
 And in that bitter hour bereft was Íliya’s bride<br>
 
 Of fifteen days; ungently from his wife’s youthful side<br>
 
 Was Stoyan taken also, ere a week they had been wed.<br>
 
 My daughter of Adam waited until nine years were sped,<br>
 
 And seven months of the tenth year; she weds another to-day.<br>
 
 And I—I could not endure it; to the vineyard I ran away!”<br>
 
  When Stoyan understood it, he went to the white house,<br>
 
 And well the wooers welcomed him with revel and carouse.<br>
 
 <p>

 He went from the steed to table, his thirst with wine to slake;<br>
 
 When he had drunk his fill of it, softly to them he spake:<br>
 
 “My brothers, gay-clad wooers, to sing is it granted me?”<br>
 
 Said the wooers: “It is, thou hero unknown; wherefore should it not be?”<br>
 
 Then Stoyan sang unto them in a high voice and a clear:<br>
 
  “A swallow plaited her fair nest; she plaited her nest nine year;<br>
 
 To-morrow will she unplait it. But there flew to her from afar<br>
 
 A mighty falcon green and gray, from the city of the tsar;<br>
 
 And the mighty falcon green and gray lets her not unplait the nest.”<br>
 
  In all this to the wooers was nothing manifest,<br>
 
 But the inward of the matter the wife of Stoyan spied.<br>
 
 Thereupon she departed from the bringer of the bride;<br>
 
 She went to the lookout place and spoke to Stoyan’s sister dear:<br>
 
 “Sister-in-law, my sister, thy brother my lord is here!”<br>
 
  When the sister of Stoyan heard it, she ran from the lookout place;<br>
 
 Thrice she looked round the table, till she saw her brother’s face.<br>
 
 <p>

 When she saw the face of her brother, wide then their arms they spread;<br>
 
 They kissed each other on the face, and the sweet tears they shed;<br>
 
 One washes the cheeks of the other with the tears of their desire.<br>
 
 But the gay-clad wooers said: “Stoyan, what get we for our hire?<br>
 
 For we spent a deal of money ere we won thy wife to wed.”<br>
 
  “Stand aside, gay-clad wooers,” Stoyan Yánkovich said,<br>
 
 “Until I have gazed on my sister! We will look to your money then;<br>
 
 Easily shall we pay it, if we in truth be men.”<br>
 
  When he had gazed on her, gifts he gave unto the wooers there;<br>
 
 A kerchief to one, to another a shirt of linen fair;<br>
 
 To the bridegroom he gave his sister: and the wooers went their way.<br>
 
  Wailing came home the mother at the ending of the day,<br>
 
 Wailing even as a cuckoo the hawthorn leaves behind,<br>
 
 And ever her son Stoyan was present in her mind:<br>
 
  “Stoyan, my golden apple, is forgot of his mother old;<br>
 
 But I will remember Yela his wife, fair as the unworn gold!<br>
 
 Who will wait for the ancient mother? Who will come forth for me,<br>

 And say to the weary woman, ‘Hath thy toil wearied thee?’ ”<br>
 
  When the wife of Stoyan heard it, before the house she sped;<br>
 
 She took her mother in her sweet arms, and to the dame she said:<br>
 
  “Wail not, O ancient mother! On thee has the warm sun shone,<br>
 
 For returned unto thy bosom is Stoyan, thy only son.”<br>
 
  She looked on her son Stoyan, and dead on the earth she fell.<br>
 
 And Stoyan buried his mother most royally and well.<br>
