 <h2 align="center">THE HEAD OF TSAR LAZAR</h2>
 
 W<small>HEN</small> the Turks smote off Tsar Lazar’s head in Kósovo, the fair,<br>
 
 No Serb came forth to find it, but a young Turk found it there;<br>
 
 He was a Turk that a Servian slave to a Moslem master bore.<br>
 
 And the young soldier thereupon he spoke his friends before:<br>
 
  “Brethren, most shameful would it be before God who is One,<br>
 
 That this lord’s head should the eagles tear, and the steeds trample thereon,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And the legions of the heroes.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>In the skirt of his spotted cloak</td></tr></table>
 
 He bore Saint Lazar’s head where forth a spring of water broke.<br>
 
 Into the spring of water he lowered the holy head,<br>
 
 And there it lay in the cool spring till forty years were sped.<br>
 
 But the fair body at Kósovo, that was so white and wan,<br>
 
 The eagles did not tear it, nor the steeds trample thereon,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Nor the legions of the heroes. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Now praise to the Lord God’s might!</td></tr></table>
 
 There were young carters that went forth from the town of Skupi the white;<br>
 
 To Nissa and to Vidin had they set out to go<br>

 With Greeks and Bulgars; and they camped one night at Kósovo.<br>
 
 The carters ate their dinner, and thirsty they became;<br>
 
 And the candle of their lantern they lighted at the flame;<br>
 
 Over Kósovo up and down a water-spring they sought,<br>
 
 And them their fortune at that hour to the spring of water brought.<br>
 
 One of them spake: “A shining moon behold in the water fair!”<br>
 
 And the second answered: “Brother, no shining moon is there.”<br>
 
 The third was silent and nothing said, but he turned his eyes abroad<br>
 
 To the east, and called on Saint Nicholas, and on the very God:<br>
 
 “O God and Father Nicholas, succor me now!” he said,<br>
 
 And he stepped into the spring therewith, and forth he drew the head<br>
 
 Of Lazar the Saint of Servia, and threw it on the grass;<br>
 
 Then he drank the water in a cup, for a thirsty man he was.<br>
 
  Before the thirsty lads had drunk, they looked where the head had been<br>
 
 On the black earth, but no head at all on the green grass was seen.<br>
 
 Forth went the sacred head alone, on the way across the plain,<br>

 Till it came to the holy body and was one with it again.<br>
 
 And when was risen the morning that broke so free and fair,<br>
 
 To the priests their tidings the carters bore, and many priests came there.<br>
 
 There were full three hundred ancient priests and twelve great bishops more,<br>
 
 And likewise at that season there came the patriarchs four;<br>
 
 In Pech<a name="page_107_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_107_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> the one was ruler, and one of Tsárigrad,<a name="page_107_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_107_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 
 One in Jerusalem, and the last the earth for his province had.<br>
 
 And they put on the sacred robes with monks’ hats for the head,<br>
 
 And with them took the holy book, and mighty prayers they said.<br>
 
 And three days that great vigil and three nights did they keep;<br>
 
 They sat not down, nor rested, nor laid them down to sleep,<br>
 
 But aye they prayed Saint Lazar, that he would grant them to know<br>
 
 What church he loved: Would he rest in Krushédol or Ópovo,<br>
 
 Beshénovo, or Yasak, or perchance he fain would lie<br>
 
 In Shíshatovats or Rákovats, Kuvézhdin, or Jifsha thereby,<br>

 Or haply in Macedonia? He will have no churching there;<br>
 
 He will go to the church that he founded, Ravánitsa, the fair.<br>
 
 Under Kuchay he stablished it, the mountain sheer and dread;<br>
 
 He built it here among us with his treasure and his bread;<br>
 
 And because of it no wretched tears by the fatherless were shed.<br>
