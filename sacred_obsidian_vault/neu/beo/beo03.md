 <h1 align="CENTER">II</h1>
 WENT he forth to find at fall of night<br>
 that haughty house, and heed wherever<br>
 the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.<br>
 Found within it the atheling band<br>
 asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,<br>
 of human hardship. Unhallowed wight,<br>
 grim and greedy, he grasped betimes,<br>
 wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,<br>
 thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed<br>
 fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,<br>
 laden with slaughter, his lair to seek.<br>
 Then at the dawning, as day was breaking,<br>
 the might of Grendel to men was known;<br>
 then after wassail was wail uplifted,<br>
 loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,<br>
 atheling excellent, unblithe sat,<br>
 labored in woe for the loss of his thanes,<br>
 when once had been traced the trail of the fiend,<br>
 spirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow,<br>
 too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;<br>
 with night returning, anew began<br>
 ruthless murder; he recked no whit,<br>
 firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime.<br>
 They were easy to find who elsewhere sought<br>
 in room remote their rest at night,<br>
 bed in the bowers,[1] when that bale was shown,<br>
 was seen in sooth, with surest token, --<br>
 the hall-thane's[2] hate. Such held themselves<br>
 far and fast who the fiend outran!<br>
 Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill<br>
 one against all; until empty stood<br>
 that lordly building, and long it bode so.<br>
 Twelve years' tide the trouble he bore,<br>
 sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,<br>
 boundless cares. There came unhidden<br>
 tidings true to the tribes of men,<br>
 in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel<br>
 harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him,<br>
 what murder and massacre, many a year,<br>
 feud unfading, -- refused consent<br>
 to deal with any of Daneland's earls,<br>
 make pact of peace, or compound for gold:<br>
 still less did the wise men ween to get<br>
 great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.<br>
 But the evil one ambushed old and young<br>
 death-shadow dark, and dogged them still,<br>
 lured, or lurked in the livelong night<br>
 of misty moorlands: men may say not<br>
 where the haunts of these Hell-Runes[3] be.<br>
 Such heaping of horrors the hater of men,<br>
 lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,<br>
 harassings heavy. O'er Heorot he lorded,<br>
 gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights;<br>
 and ne'er could the prince[4] approach his throne,<br>
 -- 'twas judgment of God, -- or have joy in his hall.<br>
 Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings'-friend,<br>
 heart-rending misery. Many nobles<br>
 sat assembled, and searched out counsel<br>
 how it were best for bold-hearted men<br>
 against harassing terror to try their hand.<br>
 Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes<br>
 altar-offerings, asked with words[5]<br>
 that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them<br>
 for the pain of their people. Their practice this,<br>
 their heathen hope; 'twas Hell they thought of<br>
 in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not,<br>
 Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord,<br>
 nor Heaven's-Helmet heeded they ever,<br>
 Wielder-of-Wonder. -- Woe for that man<br>
 who in harm and hatred hales his soul<br>
 to fiery embraces; -- nor favor nor change<br>
 awaits he ever. But well for him<br>
 that after death-day may draw to his Lord,<br>
 and friendship find in the Father's arms!<br>
