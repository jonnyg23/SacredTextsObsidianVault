 HROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings'-helmet:--<br>
 "For fight defensive, Friend my Beowulf,<br>
 to succor and save, thou hast sought us here.<br>
 Thy father's combat[1] a feud enkindled<br>
 when Heatholaf with hand he slew<br>
 among the Wylfings; his Weder kin<br>
 for horror of fighting feared to hold him.<br>
 Fleeing, he sought our South-Dane folk,<br>
 over surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings,<br>
 when first I was ruling the folk of Danes,<br>
 wielded, youthful, this widespread realm,<br>
 this hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead,<br>
 my elder brother, had breathed his last,<br>
 Healfdene's bairn: he was better than I!<br>
 Straightway the feud with fee[2] I settled,<br>
 to the Wylfings sent, o'er watery ridges,<br>
 treasures olden: oaths he[3] swore me.<br>
 Sore is my soul to say to any<br>
 of the race of man what ruth for me<br>
 in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought,<br>
 what sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me,<br>
 my warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them<br>
 into Grendel's grasp. But God is able<br>
 this deadly foe from his deeds to turn!<br>
 Boasted full oft, as my beer they drank,<br>
 earls o'er the ale-cup, armed men,<br>
 that they would bide in the beer-hall here,<br>
 Grendel's attack with terror of blades.<br>
 Then was this mead-house at morning tide<br>
 dyed with gore, when the daylight broke,<br>
 all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled,<br>
 gory the hall: I had heroes the less,<br>
 doughty dear-ones that death had reft.<br>
 -- But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words,<br>
 hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee."<br>
 Gathered together, the Geatish men<br>
 in the banquet-hall on bench assigned,<br>
 sturdy-spirited, sat them down,<br>
 hardy-hearted. A henchman attended,<br>
 carried the carven cup in hand,<br>
 served the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang<br>
 blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled,<br>
 no dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane.<br>
 <hr align="CENTER">
 [1] There is no irrelevance here. Hrothgar sees in Beowulf's mission a
 heritage of duty, a return of the good offices which the Danish king rendered to Beowulf's father in time of dire need.<br>
 [2] Money, for wergild, or man-price.<br>
 [3] Ecgtheow, Beowulf's sire.<br>
