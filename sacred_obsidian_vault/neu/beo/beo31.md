 <h1 align="CENTER">XXXII</h1>
 THAT way he went with no will of his own,<br>
 in danger of life, to the dragon's hoard,<br>
 but for pressure of peril, some prince's thane.<br>
 He fled in fear the fatal scourge,<br>
 seeking shelter, a sinful man,<br>
 and entered in. At the awful sight<br>
 tottered that guest, and terror seized him;<br>
 yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon<br>
 from fright and fear ere he fled away,<br>
 and took the cup from that treasure-hoard.<br>
 Of such besides there was store enough,<br>
 heirlooms old, the earth below,<br>
 which some earl forgotten, in ancient years,<br>
 left the last of his lofty race,<br>
 heedfully there had hidden away,<br>
 dearest treasure. For death of yore<br>
 had hurried all hence; and he alone<br>
 left to live, the last of the clan,<br>
 weeping his friends, yet wished to bide<br>
 warding the treasure, his one delight,<br>
 though brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready,<br>
 to strand and sea-waves stood anear,<br>
 hard by the headland, hidden and closed;<br>
 there laid within it his lordly heirlooms<br>
 and heaped hoard of heavy gold<br>
 that warden of rings. Few words he spake:<br>
 "Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not,<br>
 what earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee<br>
 brave men brought it! But battle-death seized<br>
 and cruel killing my clansmen all,<br>
 robbed them of life and a liegeman's joys.<br>
 None have I left to lift the sword,<br>
 or to cleanse the carven cup of price,<br>
 beaker bright. My brave are gone.<br>
 And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,<br>
 shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep<br>
 who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;<br>
 and those weeds of war that were wont to brave<br>
 over bicker of shields the bite of steel<br>
 rust with their bearer. The ringed mail<br>
 fares not far with famous chieftain,<br>
 at side of hero! No harp's delight,<br>
 no glee-wood's gladness! No good hawk now<br>
 flies through the hall! Nor horses fleet<br>
 stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death<br>
 the flower of my race have reft away."<br>
 Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,<br>
 alone, for them all, and unblithe wept<br>
 by day and by night, till death's fell wave<br>
 o'erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss<br>
 that old ill-doer open found,<br>
 who, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,<br>
 naked foe-dragon flying by night<br>
 folded in fire: the folk of earth<br>
 dread him sore. 'Tis his doom to seek<br>
 hoard in the graves, and heathen gold<br>
 to watch, many-wintered: nor wins he thereby!<br>
 Powerful this plague-of-the-people thus<br>
 held the house of the hoard in earth<br>
 three hundred winters; till One aroused<br>
 wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing<br>
 that costly cup, and the king implored<br>
 for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,<br>
 borne off was booty. His boon was granted<br>
 that wretched man; and his ruler saw<br>
 first time what was fashioned in far-off days.<br>
 When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.<br>
 O'er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found<br>
 footprint of foe who so far had gone<br>
 in his hidden craft by the creature's head. --<br>
 So may the undoomed easily flee<br>
 evils and exile, if only he gain<br>
 the grace of The Wielder! -- That warden of gold<br>
 o'er the ground went seeking, greedy to find<br>
 the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.<br>
 Savage and burning, the barrow he circled<br>
 all without; nor was any there,<br>
 none in the waste.... Yet war he desired,<br>
 was eager for battle. The barrow he entered,<br>
 sought the cup, and discovered soon<br>
 that some one of mortals had searched his treasure,<br>
 his lordly gold. The guardian waited<br>
 ill-enduring till evening came;<br>
 boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper,<br>
 and fain with flame the foe to pay<br>
 for the dear cup's loss. -- Now day was fled<br>
 as the worm had wished. By its wall no more<br>
 was it glad to bide, but burning flew<br>
 folded in flame: a fearful beginning<br>
 for sons of the soil; and soon it came,<br>
 in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end.<br>
