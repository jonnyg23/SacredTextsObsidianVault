 "UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed<br>
 by sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails<br>
 from foul behest of the hellish fiend.[1]<br>
 Him seems too little what long he possessed.<br>
 Greedy and grim, no golden rings<br>
 he gives for his pride; the promised future<br>
 forgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him,<br>
 Wonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame.<br>
 Yet in the end it ever comes<br>
 that the frame of the body fragile yields,<br>
 fated falls; and there follows another<br>
 who joyously the jewels divides,<br>
 the royal riches, nor recks of his forebear.<br>
 Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest,<br>
 best of men, and the better part choose,<br>
 profit eternal; and temper thy pride,<br>
 warrior famous! The flower of thy might<br>
 lasts now a while: but erelong it shall be<br>
 that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish,<br>
 or fang of fire, or flooding billow,<br>
 or bite of blade, or brandished spear,<br>
 or odious age; or the eyes' clear beam<br>
 wax dull and darken: Death even thee<br>
 in haste shall o'erwhelm, thou hero of war!<br>
 So the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled,<br>
 wielded 'neath welkin, and warded them bravely<br>
 from mighty-ones many o'er middle-earth,<br>
 from spear and sword, till it seemed for me<br>
 no foe could be found under fold of the sky.<br>
 Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure<br>
 came grief for joy when Grendel began<br>
 to harry my home, the hellish foe;<br>
 for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered<br>
 heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked,<br>
 Lord Eternal, for life extended<br>
 that I on this head all hewn and bloody,<br>
 after long evil, with eyes may gaze!<br>
 -- Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,<br>
 warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure<br>
 at dawn of day, be dealt between us!"<br>
 Glad was the Geats' lord, going betimes<br>
 to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded.<br>
 Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,<br>
 for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight<br>
 nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened<br>
 dusk o'er the drinkers.<br>
 The doughty ones rose:<br>
 for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,<br>
 aged Scylding; and eager the Geat,<br>
 shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned.<br>
 Him wander-weary, warrior-guest<br>
 from far, a hall-thane heralded forth,<br>
 who by custom courtly cared for all<br>
 needs of a thane as in those old days<br>
 warrior-wanderers wont to have.<br>
 So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall<br>
 rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on<br>
 till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven[2]<br>
 blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying<br>
 shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,<br>
 athelings all were eager homeward<br>
 forth to fare; and far from thence<br>
 the great-hearted guest would guide his keel.<br>
 Bade then the hardy-one Hrunting be brought<br>
 to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,<br>
 excellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it,<br>
 quoth that he counted it keen in battle,<br>
 "war-friend" winsome: with words he slandered not<br>
 edge of the blade: 'twas a big-hearted man!<br>
 Now eager for parting and armed at point<br>
 warriors waited, while went to his host<br>
 that Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling<br>
 to high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted.<br>
 
 [1] That is, he is now undefended by conscience from the temptations 
 (shafts) of the devil.<br>
 [2] Kenning for the sun. -- This is a strange role for the raven. He is the
 warrior's bird of battle, exults in slaughter and carnage; his joy here is a
 compliment to the sunrise.<br>
