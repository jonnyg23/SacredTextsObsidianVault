 THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene<br>
 with the woe of these days; not wisest men<br>
 assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,<br>
 loathly and long, that lay on his folk,<br>
 most baneful of burdens and bales of the night.<br>
 This heard in his home Hygelac's thane,<br>
 great among Geats, of Grendel's doings.<br>
 He was the mightiest man of valor<br>
 in that same day of this our life,<br>
 stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker<br>
 he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,<br>
 far o'er the swan-road he fain would seek,<br>
 the noble monarch who needed men!<br>
 The prince's journey by prudent folk<br>
 was little blamed, though they loved him dear;<br>
 they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.<br>
 And now the bold one from bands of Geats<br>
 comrades chose, the keenest of warriors<br>
 e'er he could find; with fourteen men<br>
 the sea-wood[1] he sought, and, sailor proved,<br>
 led them on to the land's confines.<br>
 Time had now flown;[2] afloat was the ship,<br>
 boat under bluff. On board they climbed,<br>
 warriors ready; waves were churning<br>
 sea with sand; the sailors bore<br>
 on the breast of the bark their bright array,<br>
 their mail and weapons: the men pushed off,<br>
 on its willing way, the well-braced craft.<br>
 Then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind<br>
 that bark like a bird with breast of foam,<br>
 till in season due, on the second day,<br>
 the curved prow such course had run<br>
 that sailors now could see the land,<br>
 sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,<br>
 headlands broad. Their haven was found,<br>
 their journey ended. Up then quickly<br>
 the Weders'[3] clansmen climbed ashore,<br>
 anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing<br>
 and gear of battle: God they thanked<br>
 for passing in peace o'er the paths of the sea.<br>
 Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,<br>
 a warden that watched the water-side,<br>
 how they bore o'er the gangway glittering shields,<br>
 war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him<br>
 to know what manner of men they were.<br>
 Straight to the strand his steed he rode,<br>
 Hrothgar's henchman; with hand of might<br>
 he shook his spear, and spake in parley.<br>
 "Who are ye, then, ye armed men,<br>
 mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel<br>
 have urged thus over the ocean ways,<br>
 here o'er the waters? A warden I,<br>
 sentinel set o'er the sea-march here,<br>
 lest any foe to the folk of Danes<br>
 with harrying fleet should harm the land.<br>
 No aliens ever at ease thus bore them,<br>
 linden-wielders:[4] yet word-of-leave<br>
 clearly ye lack from clansmen here,<br>
 my folk's agreement. -- A greater ne'er saw I<br>
 of warriors in world than is one of you, --<br>
 yon hero in harness! No henchman he<br>
 worthied by weapons, if witness his features,<br>
 his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell<br>
 your folk and home, lest hence ye fare<br>
 suspect to wander your way as spies<br>
 in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar,<br>
 ocean-travellers, take from me<br>
 simple advice: the sooner the better<br>
 I hear of the country whence ye came."<br>
 
 [1] Ship.<br>
 [2] That is, since Beowulf selected his ship and led his men to the harbor.<br>
