 <h1 align="CENTER">XI</h1>
 THEN from the moorland, by misty crags,<br>
 with God's wrath laden, Grendel came.<br>
 The monster was minded of mankind now<br>
 sundry to seize in the stately house.<br>
 Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there,<br>
 gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,<br>
 flashing with fretwork. Not first time, this,<br>
 that he the home of Hrothgar sought, --<br>
 yet ne'er in his life-day, late or early,<br>
 such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found!<br>
 To the house the warrior walked apace,<br>
 parted from peace;[1] the portal opended,<br>
 though with forged bolts fast, when his fists had struck it,<br>
 and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,<br>
 the house's mouth. All hastily, then,<br>
 o'er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on,<br>
 ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes<br>
 fearful flashes, like flame to see.<br>
 He spied in hall the hero-band,<br>
 kin and clansmen clustered asleep,<br>
 hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart;<br>
 for the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn,<br>
 savage, to sever the soul of each,<br>
 life from body, since lusty banquet<br>
 waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him<br>
 to seize any more of men on earth<br>
 after that evening. Eagerly watched<br>
 Hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe,<br>
 how he would fare in fell attack.<br>
 Not that the monster was minded to pause!<br>
 Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior<br>
 for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,<br>
 the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,<br>
 swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus<br>
 the lifeless corse was clear devoured,<br>
 e'en feet and hands. Then farther he hied;<br>
 for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,<br>
 felt for the foe with fiendish claw,<br>
 for the hero reclining, -- who clutched it boldly,<br>
 prompt to answer, propped on his arm.<br>
 Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils<br>
 that never he met in this middle-world,<br>
 in the ways of earth, another wight<br>
 with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,<br>
 sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!<br>
 Fain would he flee, his fastness seek,<br>
 the den of devils: no doings now<br>
 such as oft he had done in days of old!<br>
 Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane<br>
 of his boast at evening: up he bounded,<br>
 grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked.<br>
 The fiend made off, but the earl close followed.<br>
 The monster meant -- if he might at all --<br>
 to fling himself free, and far away<br>
 fly to the fens, -- knew his fingers' power<br>
 in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march<br>
 to Heorot this monster of harm had made!<br>
 Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft,<br>
 castle-dwellers and clansmen all,<br>
 earls, of their ale. Angry were both<br>
 those savage hall-guards: the house resounded.<br>
 Wonder it was the wine-hall firm<br>
 in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth<br>
 the fair house fell not; too fast it was<br>
 within and without by its iron bands<br>
 craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill<br>
 many a mead-bench -- men have told me --<br>
 gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled.<br>
 So well had weened the wisest Scyldings<br>
 that not ever at all might any man<br>
 that bone-decked, brave house break asunder,<br>
 crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire<br>
 in smoke engulfed it. -- Again uprose<br>
 din redoubled. Danes of the North<br>
 with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,<br>
 who from the wall that wailing heard,<br>
 God's foe sounding his grisly song,<br>
 cry of the conquered, clamorous pain<br>
 from captive of hell. Too closely held him<br>
 he who of men in might was strongest<br>
 in that same day of this our life.<br>
 
 [1] That is, he was a "lost soul," doomed to hell.<br>
