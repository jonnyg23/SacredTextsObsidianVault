 THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought<br>
 his rest of the evening, -- as ofttime had happened<br>
 when Grendel guarded that golden hall,<br>
 evil wrought, till his end drew nigh,<br>
 slaughter for sins. 'Twas seen and told<br>
 how an avenger survived the fiend,<br>
 as was learned afar. The livelong time<br>
 after that grim fight, Grendel's mother,<br>
 monster of women, mourned her woe.<br>
 She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters,<br>
 cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down<br>
 with edge of the sword his only brother,<br>
 his father's offspring: outlawed he fled,<br>
 marked with murder, from men's delights<br>
 warded the wilds. -- There woke from him<br>
 such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who,<br>
 war-wolf horrid, at Heorot found<br>
 a warrior watching and waiting the fray,<br>
 with whom the grisly one grappled amain.<br>
 But the man remembered his mighty power,<br>
 the glorious gift that God had sent him,<br>
 in his Maker's mercy put his trust<br>
 for comfort and help: so he conquered the foe,<br>
 felled the fiend, who fled abject,<br>
 reft of joy, to the realms of death,<br>
 mankind's foe. And his mother now,<br>
 gloomy and grim, would go that quest<br>
 of sorrow, the death of her son to avenge.<br>
 To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes<br>
 slept in the hall. Too soon came back<br>
 old ills of the earls, when in she burst,<br>
 the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror,<br>
 e'en as terror of woman in war is less,<br>
 might of maid, than of men in arms<br>
 when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard,<br>
 sword gore-stained, through swine of the helm,<br>
 crested, with keen blade carves amain.<br>
 Then was in hall the hard-edge drawn,<br>
 the swords on the settles,[1] and shields a-many<br>
 firm held in hand: nor helmet minded<br>
 nor harness of mail, whom that horror seized.<br>
 Haste was hers; she would hie afar<br>
 and save her life when the liegemen saw her.<br>
 Yet a single atheling up she seized<br>
 fast and firm, as she fled to the moor.<br>
 He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest,<br>
 of trusty vassals betwixt the seas,<br>
 whom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous,<br>
 in battle brave. -- Nor was Beowulf there;<br>
 another house had been held apart,<br>
 after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. --<br>
 Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed,<br>
 blood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned,<br>
 dole in the dwellings: 'twas dire exchange<br>
 where Dane and Geat were doomed to give<br>
 the lives of loved ones. Long-tried king,<br>
 the hoary hero, at heart was sad<br>
 when he knew his noble no more lived,<br>
 and dead indeed was his dearest thane.<br>
 To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste,<br>
 dauntless victor. As daylight broke,<br>
 along with his earls the atheling lord,<br>
 with his clansmen, came where the king abode<br>
 waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All<br>
 would turn this tale of trouble and woe.<br>
 Strode o'er floor the famed-in-strife,<br>
 with his hand-companions, -- the hall resounded, --<br>
 wishing to greet the wise old king,<br>
 Ingwines' lord; he asked if the night<br>
 had passed in peace to the prince's mind.<br>
 
 [1] They had laid their arms on the benches near where they slept.<br>
