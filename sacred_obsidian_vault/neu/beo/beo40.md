 "THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats<br>
 and the storm of their strife, were seen afar,<br>
 how folk against folk the fight had wakened.<br>
 The ancient king with his atheling band<br>
 sought his citadel, sorrowing much:<br>
 Ongentheow earl went up to his burg.<br>
 He had tested Hygelac's hardihood,<br>
 the proud one's prowess, would prove it no longer,<br>
 defied no more those fighting-wanderers<br>
 nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard,<br>
 his bairn and his bride: so he bent him again,<br>
 old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came<br>
 with slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac<br>
 o'er peaceful plains in pride advancing,<br>
 till Hrethelings fought in the fenced town.[1]<br>
 Then Ongentheow with edge of sword,<br>
 the hoary-bearded, was held at bay,<br>
 and the folk-king there was forced to suffer<br>
 Eofor's anger. In ire, at the king<br>
 Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck;<br>
 and the chieftain's blood, for that blow, in streams<br>
 flowed 'neath his hair. No fear felt he,<br>
 stout old Scylfing, but straightway repaid<br>
 in better bargain that bitter stroke<br>
 and faced his foe with fell intent.<br>
 Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred<br>
 answer to render the aged chief;<br>
 too soon on his head the helm was cloven;<br>
 blood-bedecked he bowed to earth,<br>
 and fell adown; not doomed was he yet,<br>
 and well he waxed, though the wound was sore.<br>
 Then the hardy Hygelac-thane,[2]<br>
 when his brother fell, with broad brand smote,<br>
 giants' sword crashing through giants'-helm<br>
 across the shield-wall: sank the king,<br>
 his folk's old herdsman, fatally hurt.<br>
 There were many to bind the brother's wounds<br>
 and lift him, fast as fate allowed<br>
 his people to wield the place-of-war.<br>
 But Eofor took from Ongentheow,<br>
 earl from other, the iron-breastplate,<br>
 hard sword hilted, and helmet too,<br>
 and the hoar-chief's harness to Hygelac carried,<br>
 who took the trappings, and truly promised<br>
 rich fee 'mid folk, -- and fulfilled it so.<br>
 For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord,<br>
 Hrethel's offspring, when home he came,<br>
 to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure,<br>
 Each of them had a hundred thousand[3]<br>
 in land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned<br>
 mid-earth men such mighty deeds!<br>
 And to Eofor he gave his only daughter<br>
 in pledge of grace, the pride of his home.<br>
 "Such is the feud, the foeman's rage,<br>
 death-hate of men: so I deem it sure<br>
 that the Swedish folk will seek us home<br>
 for this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings,<br>
 when once they learn that our warrior leader<br>
 lifeless lies, who land and hoard<br>
 ever defended from all his foes,<br>
 furthered his folk's weal, finished his course<br>
 a hardy hero. -- Now haste is best,<br>
 that we go to gaze on our Geatish lord,<br>
 and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings<br>
 to the funeral pyre. No fragments merely<br>
 shall burn with the warrior. Wealth of jewels,<br>
 gold untold and gained in terror,<br>
 treasure at last with his life obtained,<br>
 all of that booty the brands shall take,<br>
 fire shall eat it. No earl must carry<br>
 memorial jewel. No maiden fair<br>
 shall wreathe her neck with noble ring:<br>
 nay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,<br>
 oft shall she pass o'er paths of exile<br>
 now our lord all laughter has laid aside,<br>
 all mirth and revel. Many a spear<br>
 morning-cold shall be clasped amain,<br>
 lifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp<br>
 those warriors wake; but the wan-hued raven,<br>
 fain o'er the fallen, his feast shall praise<br>
 and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate<br>
 when he and the wolf were wasting the slain."<br>
 So he told his sorrowful tidings,<br>
 and little[4] he lied, the loyal man<br>
 of word or of work. The warriors rose;<br>
 sad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,<br>
 went, welling with tears, the wonder to view.<br>
 Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,<br>
 their lifeless lord, who had lavished rings<br>
 of old upon them. Ending-day<br>
 had dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized<br>
 in woful slaughter the Weders' king.<br>
 There saw they, besides, the strangest being,<br>
 loathsome, lying their leader near,<br>
 prone on the field. The fiery dragon,<br>
 fearful fiend, with flame was scorched.<br>
 Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures<br>
 in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile<br>
 it had revelled by night, and anon come back,<br>
 seeking its den; now in death's sure clutch<br>
 it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.<br>
 By it there stood the stoups and jars;<br>
 dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords<br>
 eaten with rust, as, on earth's lap resting,<br>
 a thousand winters they waited there.<br>
 For all that heritage huge, that gold<br>
 of bygone men, was bound by a spell,[5]<br>
 so the treasure-hall could be touched by none<br>
 of human kind, -- save that Heaven's King,<br>
 God himself, might give whom he would,<br>
 Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, --<br>
 even such a man as seemed to him meet.<br>
 
 [1] The line may mean: till Hrethelings stormed on the hedged shields, -- i.e. the shield-wall or hedge of defensive war -- Hrethelings, of course, are Geats.<br>
 [2] Eofor, brother to Wulf Wonreding.<br>
 [3] Sc. "value in" hides and the weight of the gold.<br>
 [4] Not at all.<br>
 [5] Laid on it when it was put in the barrow. This spell, or in our days
 the "curse," either prevented discovery or brought dire ills on the finder
 and taker.<br>
