 NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence[1]<br>
 suffer that slaughterous stranger to live,<br>
 useless deeming his days and years<br>
 to men on earth. Now many an earl<br>
 of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,<br>
 fain the life of their lord to shield,<br>
 their praised prince, if power were theirs;<br>
 never they knew, -- as they neared the foe,<br>
 hardy-hearted heroes of war,<br>
 aiming their swords on every side<br>
 the accursed to kill, -- no keenest blade,<br>
 no farest of falchions fashioned on earth,<br>
 could harm or hurt that hideous fiend!<br>
 He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,<br>
 from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting<br>
 on that same day of this our life<br>
 woful should be, and his wandering soul<br>
 far off flit to the fiends' domain.<br>
 Soon he found, who in former days,<br>
 harmful in heart and hated of God,<br>
 on many a man such murder wrought,<br>
 that the frame of his body failed him now.<br>
 For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac<br>
 held in hand; hateful alive<br>
 was each to other. The outlaw dire<br>
 took mortal hurt; a mighty wound<br>
 showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,<br>
 and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now<br>
 the glory was given, and Grendel thence<br>
 death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,<br>
 noisome abode: he knew too well<br>
 that here was the last of life, an end<br>
 of his days on earth. -- To all the Danes<br>
 by that bloody battle the boon had come.<br>
 From ravage had rescued the roving stranger<br>
 Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise one<br>
 had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,<br>
 his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes<br>
 had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,<br>
 all their sorrow and ills assuaged,<br>
 their bale of battle borne so long,<br>
 and all the dole they erst endured<br>
 pain a-plenty. -- 'Twas proof of this,<br>
 when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,<br>
 arm and shoulder, -- all, indeed,<br>
 of Grendel's gripe, -- 'neath the gabled roof·<br>
