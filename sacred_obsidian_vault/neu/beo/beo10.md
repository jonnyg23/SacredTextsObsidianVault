 ME thus often the evil monsters<br>
 thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword,<br>
 the darling, I dealt them due return!<br>
 Nowise had they bliss from their booty then<br>
 to devour their victim, vengeful creatures,<br>
 seated to banquet at bottom of sea;<br>
 but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt,<br>
 on the edge of ocean up they lay,<br>
 put to sleep by the sword. And since, by them<br>
 on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk<br>
 are never molested. -- Light from east,<br>
 came bright God's beacon; the billows sank,<br>
 so that I saw the sea-cliffs high,<br>
 windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth<br>
 earl undoomed if he doughty be!<br>
 And so it came that I killed with my sword<br>
 nine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles<br>
 ne'er heard I a harder 'neath heaven's dome,<br>
 nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man!<br>
 Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch,<br>
 though spent with swimming. The sea upbore me,<br>
 flood of the tide, on Finnish land,<br>
 the welling waters. No wise of thee<br>
 have I heard men tell such terror of falchions,<br>
 bitter battle. Breca ne'er yet,<br>
 not one of you pair, in the play of war<br>
 such daring deed has done at all<br>
 with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! --<br>
 though thou wast the bane[1] of thy brethren dear,<br>
 thy closest kin, whence curse of hell<br>
 awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve!<br>
 For I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf,<br>
 never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,<br>
 monster dire, on thy master dear,<br>
 in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine<br>
 were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud!<br>
 But he has found no feud will happen;<br>
 from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan<br>
 he vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings.<br>
 He forces pledges, favors none<br>
 of the land of Danes, but lustily murders,<br>
 fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads<br>
 from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now<br>
 shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats,<br>
 shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead<br>
 go he that listeth, when light of dawn<br>
 this morrow morning o'er men of earth,<br>
 ether-robed sun from the south shall beam!"<br>
 Joyous then was the Jewel-giver,<br>
 hoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited<br>
 the Bright-Danes' prince, from Beowulf hearing,<br>
 folk's good shepherd, such firm resolve.<br>
 Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding<br>
 with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth,<br>
 queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,<br>
 gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall;<br>
 and the high-born lady handed the cup<br>
 first to the East-Danes' heir and warden,<br>
 bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,<br>
 the land's beloved one. Lustily took he<br>
 banquet and beaker, battle-famed king.<br>
 Through the hall then went the Helmings' Lady,<br>
 to younger and older everywhere<br>
 carried the cup, till come the moment<br>
 when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,<br>
 to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead.<br>
 She greeted the Geats' lord, God she thanked,<br>
 in wisdom's words, that her will was granted,<br>
 that at last on a hero her hope could lean<br>
 for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,<br>
 hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow's hand,<br>
 and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.<br>
 Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<br>
 "This was my thought, when my thanes and I<br>
 bent to the ocean and entered our boat,<br>
 that I would work the will of your people<br>
 fully, or fighting fall in death,<br>
 in fiend's gripe fast. I am firm to do<br>
 an earl's brave deed, or end the days<br>
 of this life of mine in the mead-hall here."<br>
 Well these words to the woman seemed,<br>
 Beowulf's battle-boast. -- Bright with gold<br>
 the stately dame by her spouse sat down.<br>
 Again, as erst, began in hall<br>
 warriors' wassail and words of power,<br>
 the proud-band's revel, till presently<br>
 the son of Healfdene hastened to seek<br>
 rest for the night; he knew there waited<br>
 fight for the fiend in that festal hall,<br>
 when the sheen of the sun they saw no more,<br>
 and dusk of night sank darkling nigh,<br>
 and shadowy shapes came striding on,<br>
 wan under welkin. The warriors rose.<br>
 Man to man, he made harangue,<br>
 Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail,<br>
 let him wield the wine hall: a word he added:--<br>
 "Never to any man erst I trusted,<br>
 since I could heave up hand and shield,<br>
 this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.<br>
 Have now and hold this house unpeered;<br>
 remember thy glory; thy might declare;<br>
 watch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee<br>
 if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life."<br>
