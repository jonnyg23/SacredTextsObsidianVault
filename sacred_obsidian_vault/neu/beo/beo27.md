 BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<br>
 "Lo, we seafarers say our will,<br>
 far-come men, that we fain would seek<br>
 Hygelac now. We here have found<br>
 hosts to our heart: thou hast harbored us well.<br>
 If ever on earth I am able to win me<br>
 more of thy love, O lord of men,<br>
 aught anew, than I now have done,<br>
 for work of war I am willing still!<br>
 If it come to me ever across the seas<br>
 that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, --<br>
 as they that hate thee erewhile have used, --<br>
 thousands then of thanes I shall bring,<br>
 heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,<br>
 ward of his folk, that, though few his years,<br>
 the lord of the Geats will give me aid<br>
 by word and by work, that well I may serve thee,<br>
 wielding the war-wood to win thy triumph<br>
 and lending thee might when thou lackest men.<br>
 If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,<br>
 a sovran's son, he will surely there<br>
 find his friends. A far-off land<br>
 each man should visit who vaunts him brave."<br>
 Him then answering, Hrothgar spake:--<br>
 "These words of thine the wisest God<br>
 sent to thy soul! No sager counsel<br>
 from so young in years e'er yet have I heard.<br>
 Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary,<br>
 art wise in words! I ween indeed<br>
 if ever it hap that Hrethel's heir<br>
 by spear be seized, by sword-grim battle,<br>
 by illness or iron, thine elder and lord,<br>
 people's leader, -- and life be thine, --<br>
 no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find<br>
 at all to choose for their chief and king,<br>
 for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt<br>
 thy kinsman's kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me<br>
 the longer the better, Beowulf loved!<br>
 Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,<br>
 sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,<br>
 shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,<br>
 such as once they waged, from war refrain.<br>
 Long as I rule this realm so wide,<br>
 let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold<br>
 each other greet o'er the gannet's-bath,<br>
 and the ringed-prow bear o'er rolling waves<br>
 tokens of love. I trow my landfolk<br>
 towards friend and foe are firmly joined,<br>
 and honor they keep in the olden way."<br>
 To him in the hall, then, Healfdene's son<br>
 gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls<br>
 bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,<br>
 hale to his home, and in haste return.<br>
 Then kissed the king of kin renowned,<br>
 Scyldings' chieftain, that choicest thane,<br>
 and fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears<br>
 of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,<br>
 he had chances twain, but he clung to this,[1] --<br>
 that each should look on the other again,<br>
 and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.<br>
 his breast's wild billows he banned in vain;<br>
 safe in his soul a secret longing,<br>
 locked in his mind, for that loved man<br>
 burned in his blood. Then Beowulf strode,<br>
 glad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o'er,<br>
 warrior blithe. The wave-roamer bode<br>
 riding at anchor, its owner awaiting.<br>
 As they hastened onward, Hrothgar's gift<br>
 they lauded at length. -- 'Twas a lord unpeered,<br>
 every way blameless, till age had broken<br>
 -- it spareth no mortal -- his splendid might.<br>
 
 [1] That is, he might or might not see Beowulf again. Old as he was, the
 latter chance was likely; but he clung to the former, hoping to see his
 young friend again "and exchange brave words in the hall."
