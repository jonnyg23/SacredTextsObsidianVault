 IT was heavy hap for that hero young<br>
 on his lord beloved to look and find him<br>
 lying on earth with life at end,<br>
 sorrowful sight. But the slayer too,<br>
 awful earth-dragon, empty of breath,<br>
 lay felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure,<br>
 could the writhing monster rule it more.<br>
 For edges of iron had ended its days,<br>
 hard and battle-sharp, hammers' leaving;[1]<br>
 and that flier-afar had fallen to ground<br>
 hushed by its hurt, its hoard all near,<br>
 no longer lusty aloft to whirl<br>
 at midnight, making its merriment seen,<br>
 proud of its prizes: prone it sank<br>
 by the handiwork of the hero-king.<br>
 Forsooth among folk but few achieve,<br>
 -- though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me,<br>
 and never so daring in deed of valor, --<br>
 the perilous breath of a poison-foe<br>
 to brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall,<br>
 whenever his watch the warden keeps<br>
 bold in the barrow. Beowulf paid<br>
 the price of death for that precious hoard;<br>
 and each of the foes had found the end<br>
 of this fleeting life.<br>
 Befell erelong<br>
 that the laggards in war the wood had left,<br>
 trothbreakers, cowards, ten together,<br>
 fearing before to flourish a spear<br>
 in the sore distress of their sovran lord.<br>
 Now in their shame their shields they carried,<br>
 armor of fight, where the old man lay;<br>
 and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat<br>
 at his sovran's shoulder, shieldsman good,<br>
 to wake him with water.[2] Nowise it availed.<br>
 Though well he wished it, in world no more<br>
 could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles<br>
 nor baffle the will of all-wielding God.<br>
 Doom of the Lord was law o'er the deeds<br>
 of every man, as it is to-day.<br>
 Grim was the answer, easy to get,<br>
 from the youth for those that had yielded to fear!<br>
 Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, --<br>
 mournful he looked on those men unloved:--<br>
 "Who sooth will speak, can say indeed<br>
 that the ruler who gave you golden rings<br>
 and the harness of war in which ye stand<br>
 -- for he at ale-bench often-times<br>
 bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate,<br>
 lord to liegemen, the likeliest gear<br>
 which near of far he could find to give, --<br>
 threw away and wasted these weeds of battle,<br>
 on men who failed when the foemen came!<br>
 Not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms<br>
 venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,<br>
 God, gave him grace that he got revenge<br>
 sole with his sword in stress and need.<br>
 To rescue his life, 'twas little that I<br>
 could serve him in struggle; yet shift I made<br>
 (hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman.<br>
 Its strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck<br>
 that fatal foe, and the fire less strongly<br>
 flowed from its head. -- Too few the heroes<br>
 in throe of contest that thronged to our king!<br>
 Now gift of treasure and girding of sword,<br>
 joy of the house and home-delight<br>
 shall fail your folk; his freehold-land<br>
 every clansman within your kin<br>
 shall lose and leave, when lords highborn<br>
 hear afar of that flight of yours,<br>
 a fameless deed. Yea, death is better<br>
 for liegemen all than a life of shame!"<br>
