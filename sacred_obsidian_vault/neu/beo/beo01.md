 <h1 align="CENTER">PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE</h1>
 
 LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings<br>
 of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,<br>
 we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!<br>
 Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,<br>
 from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,<br>
 awing the earls. Since erst he lay<br>
 friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:<br>
 for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,<br>
 till before him the folk, both far and near,<br>
 who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,<br>
 gave him gifts: a good king he!<br>
 To him an heir was afterward born,<br>
 a son in his halls, whom heaven sent<br>
 to favor the folk, feeling their woe<br>
 that erst they had lacked an earl for leader<br>
 so long a while; the Lord endowed him,<br>
 the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown.<br>
 Famed was this Beowulf:[1] far flew the boast of him,<br>
 son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands.<br>
 So becomes it a youth to quit him well<br>
 with his father's friends, by fee and gift,<br>
 that to aid him, aged, in after days,<br>
 come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,<br>
 liegemen loyal: by lauded deeds<br>
 shall an earl have honor in every clan.<br>
 Forth he fared at the fated moment,<br>
 sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.<br>
 Then they bore him over to ocean's billow,<br>
 loving clansmen, as late he charged them,<br>
 while wielded words the winsome Scyld,<br>
 the leader beloved who long had ruled....<br>
 In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,<br>
 ice-flecked, outbound, atheling's barge:<br>
 there laid they down their darling lord<br>
 on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,[2]<br>
 by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure<br>
 fetched from far was freighted with him.<br>
 No ship have I known so nobly dight<br>
 with weapons of war and weeds of battle,<br>
 with breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay<br>
 a heaped hoard that hence should go<br>
 far o'er the flood with him floating away.<br>
 No less these loaded the lordly gifts,<br>
 thanes' huge treasure, than those had done<br>
 who in former time forth had sent him<br>
 sole on the seas, a suckling child.<br>
 High o'er his head they hoist the standard,<br>
 a gold-wove banner; let billows take him,<br>
 gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits,<br>
 mournful their mood. No man is able<br>
 to say in sooth, no son of the halls,<br>
 no hero 'neath heaven, -- who harbored that freight!<br>
 <hr width="50%">
 [1] Not, of course, Beowulf the Great, hero of the epic.<br>
 [2] Kenning for king or chieftain of a comitatus: he breaks off gold from
 the spiral rings -- often worn on the arm -- and so rewards his followers.
