 BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:<br>
 "Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better<br>
 friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.<br>
 Each of us all must his end abide<br>
 in the ways of the world; so win who may<br>
 glory ere death! When his days are told,<br>
 that is the warrior's worthiest doom.<br>
 Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,<br>
 and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.<br>
 No harbor shall hide her -- heed my promise! --<br>
 enfolding of field or forested mountain<br>
 or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!<br>
 But thou this day endure in patience,<br>
 as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one."<br>
 Leaped up the graybeard: God he thanked,<br>
 mighty Lord, for the man's brave words.<br>
 For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled<br>
 wave-maned steed. The sovran wise<br>
 stately rode on; his shield-armed men<br>
 followed in force. The footprints led<br>
 along the woodland, widely seen,<br>
 a path o'er the plain, where she passed, and trod<br>
 the murky moor; of men-at-arms<br>
 she bore the bravest and best one, dead,<br>
 him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.<br>
 On then went the atheling-born<br>
 o'er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,<br>
 narrow passes and unknown ways,<br>
 headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.<br>
 Foremost he[1] fared, a few at his side<br>
 of the wiser men, the ways to scan,<br>
 till he found in a flash the forested hill<br>
 hanging over the hoary rock,<br>
 a woful wood: the waves below<br>
 were dyed in blood. The Danish men<br>
 had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,<br>
 for many a hero, 'twas hard to bear,<br>
 ill for earls, when Aeschere's head<br>
 they found by the flood on the foreland there.<br>
 Waves were welling, the warriors saw,<br>
 hot with blood; but the horn sang oft<br>
 battle-song bold. The band sat down,<br>
 and watched on the water worm-like things,<br>
 sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,<br>
 and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness --<br>
 such as oft essay at hour of morn<br>
 on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, --<br>
 and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,<br>
 swollen and savage that song to hear,<br>
 that war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats,<br>
 with bolt from bow, then balked of life,<br>
 of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart<br>
 went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed<br>
 less doughty in swimming whom death had seized.<br>
 Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well<br>
 hooked and barbed, it was hard beset,<br>
 done to death and dragged on the headland,<br>
 wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed the grisly guest.<br>
 Then girt him Beowulf<br>
 in martial mail, nor mourned for his life.<br>
 His breastplate broad and bright of hues,<br>
 woven by hand, should the waters try;<br>
 well could it ward the warrior's body<br>
 that battle should break on his breast in vain<br>
 nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe.<br>
 And the helmet white that his head protected<br>
 was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,<br>
 through wave-whirl win: 'twas wound with chains,<br>
 decked with gold, as in days of yore<br>
 the weapon-smith worked it wondrously,<br>
 with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,<br>
 brandished in battle, could bite that helm.<br>
 Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps<br>
 which Hrothgar's orator offered at need:<br>
 "Hrunting" they named the hilted sword,<br>
 of old-time heirlooms easily first;<br>
 iron was its edge, all etched with poison,<br>
 with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight<br>
 in hero's hand who held it ever,<br>
 on paths of peril prepared to go<br>
 to folkstead[2] of foes. Not first time this<br>
 it was destined to do a daring task.<br>
 For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf<br>
 sturdy and strong, that speech he had made,<br>
 drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent<br>
 to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not<br>
 under welter of waters wager his life<br>
 as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory,<br>
 honor of earls. With the other not so,<br>
 who girded him now for the grim encounter.<br>
 
 [1] Hrothgar is probably meant.<br>
 [2] Meeting place.<br>
