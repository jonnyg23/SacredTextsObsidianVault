 UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf,<br>
 who sat at the feet of the Scyldings' lord,<br>
 unbound the battle-runes.[1] -- Beowulf's quest,<br>
 sturdy seafarer's, sorely galled him;<br>
 ever he envied that other men<br>
 should more achieve in middle-earth<br>
 of fame under heaven than he himself. --<br>
 "Art thou that Beowulf, Breca's rival,<br>
 who emulous swam on the open sea,<br>
 when for pride the pair of you proved the floods,<br>
 and wantonly dared in waters deep<br>
 to risk your lives? No living man,<br>
 or lief or loath, from your labor dire<br>
 could you dissuade, from swimming the main.<br>
 Ocean-tides with your arms ye covered,<br>
 with strenuous hands the sea-streets measured,<br>
 swam o'er the waters. Winter's storm<br>
 rolled the rough waves. In realm of sea<br>
 a sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee,<br>
 had more of main! Him at morning-tide<br>
 billows bore to the Battling Reamas,<br>
 whence he hied to his home so dear<br>
 beloved of his liegemen, to land of Brondings,<br>
 fastness fair, where his folk he ruled,<br>
 town and treasure. In triumph o'er thee<br>
 Beanstan's bairn[2] his boast achieved.<br>
 So ween I for thee a worse adventure<br>
 -- though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been,<br>
 in struggle grim, -- if Grendel's approach<br>
 thou darst await through the watch of night!"<br>
 Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<br>
 "What a deal hast uttered, dear my Unferth,<br>
 drunken with beer, of Breca now,<br>
 told of his triumph! Truth I claim it,<br>
 that I had more of might in the sea<br>
 than any man else, more ocean-endurance.<br>
 We twain had talked, in time of youth,<br>
 and made our boast, -- we were merely boys,<br>
 striplings still, -- to stake our lives<br>
 far at sea: and so we performed it.<br>
 Naked swords, as we swam along,<br>
 we held in hand, with hope to guard us<br>
 against the whales. Not a whit from me<br>
 could he float afar o'er the flood of waves,<br>
 haste o'er the billows; nor him I abandoned.<br>
 Together we twain on the tides abode<br>
 five nights full till the flood divided us,<br>
 churning waves and chillest weather,<br>
 darkling night, and the northern wind<br>
 ruthless rushed on us: rough was the surge.<br>
 Now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace;<br>
 yet me 'gainst the monsters my mailed coat,<br>
 hard and hand-linked, help afforded, --<br>
 battle-sark braided my breast to ward,<br>
 garnished with gold. There grasped me firm<br>
 and haled me to bottom the hated foe,<br>
 with grimmest gripe. 'Twas granted me, though,<br>
 to pierce the monster with point of sword,<br>
 with blade of battle: huge beast of the sea<br>
 was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine.<br>
