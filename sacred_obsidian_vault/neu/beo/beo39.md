 THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,<br>
 at the fort on the cliff, where, full of sorrow,<br>
 all the morning earls had sat,<br>
 daring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:<br>
 would they wail as dead, or welcome home,<br>
 their lord beloved? Little[1] kept back<br>
 of the tidings new, but told them all,<br>
 the herald that up the headland rode. --<br>
 "Now the willing-giver to Weder folk<br>
 in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats<br>
 on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent's deed!<br>
 And beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men<br>
 with knife-wounds sick:[2] no sword availed<br>
 on the awesome thing in any wise<br>
 to work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,<br>
 Weohstan's bairn, by Beowulf's side,<br>
 the living earl by the other dead,<br>
 and heavy of heart a head-watch[3] keeps<br>
 o'er friend and foe. -- Now our folk may look<br>
 for waging of war when once unhidden<br>
 to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king<br>
 is spread afar. -- The strife began<br>
 when hot on the Hugas[4] Hygelac fell<br>
 and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.<br>
 Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war,<br>
 plied with such prowess their power o'erwhelming<br>
 that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it<br>
 and fell in fight. To his friends no wise<br>
 could that earl give treasure! And ever since<br>
 the Merowings' favor has failed us wholly.<br>
 Nor aught expect I of peace and faith<br>
 from Swedish folk. 'Twas spread afar<br>
 how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood<br>
 Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,<br>
 when the folk of Geats for the first time sought<br>
 in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.<br>
 Soon the sage old sire[5] of Ohtere,<br>
 ancient and awful, gave answering blow;<br>
 the sea-king[6] he slew, and his spouse redeemed,<br>
 his good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold,<br>
 mother of Ohtere and Onela.<br>
 Then he followed his foes, who fled before him<br>
 sore beset and stole their way,<br>
 bereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood.<br>
 With his host he besieged there what swords had left,<br>
 the weary and wounded; woes he threatened<br>
 the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:<br>
 some with the morrow his sword should kill,<br>
 some should go to the gallows-tree<br>
 for rapture of ravens. But rescue came<br>
 with dawn of day for those desperate men<br>
 when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound,<br>
 tones of his trumpet; the trusty king<br>
 had followed their trail with faithful band.<br>
