 THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,<br>
 and bright homes burned. The blaze stood high<br>
 all landsfolk frighting. No living thing<br>
 would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.<br>
 Wide was the dragon's warring seen,<br>
 its fiendish fury far and near,<br>
 as the grim destroyer those Geatish people<br>
 hated and hounded. To hidden lair,<br>
 to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.<br>
 Folk of the land it had lapped in flame,<br>
 with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,<br>
 its battling and bulwarks: that boast was vain!<br>
 To Beowulf then the bale was told<br>
 quickly and truly: the king's own home,<br>
 of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,<br>
 that gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man<br>
 sad in heart, 'twas heaviest sorrow.<br>
 The sage assumed that his sovran God<br>
 he had angered, breaking ancient law,<br>
 and embittered the Lord. His breast within<br>
 with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.<br>
 The folk's own fastness that fiery dragon<br>
 with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all<br>
 washed by waves; but the warlike king,<br>
 prince of the Weders, plotted vengeance.<br>
 Warriors'-bulwark, he bade them work<br>
 all of iron -- the earl's commander --<br>
 a war-shield wondrous: well he knew<br>
 that forest-wood against fire were worthless,<br>
 linden could aid not. -- Atheling brave,<br>
 he was fated to finish this fleeting life,[1]<br>
 his days on earth, and the dragon with him,<br>
 though long it had watched o'er the wealth of the hoard! --<br>
 Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,<br>
 to follow the flyer-afar with a host,<br>
 a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he,<br>
 nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring,<br>
 its vigor and valor: ventures desperate<br>
 he had passed a-plenty, and perils of war,<br>
 contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,<br>
 Hrothgar's hall he had wholly purged,<br>
 and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,<br>
 loathsome breed! Not least was that<br>
 of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell,<br>
 when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,<br>
 lord of his folk, in the Frisian land,<br>
 son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died,<br>
 by brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled<br>
 through strength of himself and his swimming power,<br>
 though alone, and his arms were laden with thirty<br>
 coats of mail, when he came to the sea!<br>
 Nor yet might Hetwaras[2] haughtily boast<br>
 their craft of contest, who carried against him<br>
 shields to the fight: but few escaped<br>
 from strife with the hero to seek their homes!<br>
 Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow's son<br>
 lonely and sorrowful, seeking his land,<br>
 where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm,<br>
 rings and royal-seat, reckoning naught<br>
 the strength of her son to save their kingdom<br>
 from hostile hordes, after Hygelac's death.<br>
 No sooner for this could the stricken ones<br>
 in any wise move that atheling's mind<br>
 over young Heardred's head as lord<br>
 and ruler of all the realm to be:<br>
 yet the hero upheld him with helpful words,<br>
 aided in honor, till, older grown,<br>
 he wielded the Weder-Geats. -- Wandering exiles<br>
 sought him o'er seas, the sons of Ohtere,<br>
 who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings'-helmet,<br>
 the bravest and best that broke the rings,<br>
 in Swedish land, of the sea-kings' line,<br>
 haughty hero.[3] Hence Heardred's end.<br>
 For shelter he gave them, sword-death came,<br>
 the blade's fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;<br>
 but the son of Ongentheow sought again<br>
 house and home when Heardred fell,<br>
 leaving Beowulf lord of Geats<br>
 and gift-seat's master. -- A good king he!<br>
 
 [1] Literally "loan-days," days loaned to man.<br>
 [2] Chattuarii, a tribe that dwelt along the Rhine, and took part in repelling
 the raid of (Hygelac) Chocilaicus.<br>
 [3] Onela, son of Ongentheow, who pursues his two nephews Eanmund and
 Eadgils to Heardred's court, where they have taken refuge after their un-
 successful rebellion. In the fighting Heardred is killed.
