 <h1 align="CENTER">XIII</h1>
 MANY at morning, as men have told me,<br>
 warriors gathered the gift-hall round,<br>
 folk-leaders faring from far and near,<br>
 o'er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,<br>
 trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed<br>
 the enemy's end to any man<br>
 who saw by the gait of the graceless foe<br>
 how the weary-hearted, away from thence,<br>
 baffled in battle and banned, his steps<br>
 death-marked dragged to the devils' mere.<br>
 Bloody the billows were boiling there,<br>
 turbid the tide of tumbling waves<br>
 horribly seething, with sword-blood hot,<br>
 by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor<br>
 laid forlorn his life adown,<br>
 his heathen soul,-and hell received it.<br>
 Home then rode the hoary clansmen<br>
 from that merry journey, and many a youth,<br>
 on horses white, the hardy warriors,<br>
 back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory<br>
 eager they echoed, and all averred<br>
 that from sea to sea, or south or north,<br>
 there was no other in earth's domain,<br>
 under vault of heaven, more valiant found,<br>
 of warriors none more worthy to rule!<br>
 (On their lord beloved they laid no slight,<br>
 gracious Hrothgar: a good king he!)<br>
 From time to time, the tried-in-battle<br>
 their gray steeds set to gallop amain,<br>
 and ran a race when the road seemed fair.<br>
 From time to time, a thane of the king,<br>
 who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses,<br>
 stored with sagas and songs of old,<br>
 bound word to word in well-knit rime,<br>
 welded his lay; this warrior soon<br>
 of Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang,<br>
 and artfully added an excellent tale,<br>
 in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds<br>
 he had heard in saga of Sigemund.<br>
 Strange the story: he said it all, --<br>
 the Waelsing's wanderings wide, his struggles,<br>
 which never were told to tribes of men,<br>
 the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only,<br>
 when of these doings he deigned to speak,<br>
 uncle to nephew; as ever the twain<br>
 stood side by side in stress of war,<br>
 and multitude of the monster kind<br>
 they had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew,<br>
 when he passed from life, no little praise;<br>
 for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed<br>
 that herded the hoard:[1] under hoary rock<br>
 the atheling dared the deed alone<br>
 fearful quest, nor was Fitela there.<br>
 Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced<br>
 that wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck,<br>
 best blade; the dragon died in its blood.<br>
 Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved<br>
 over the ring-hoard to rule at will,<br>
 himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded,<br>
 and bore on its bosom the beaming gold,<br>
 son of Waels; the worm was consumed.<br>
 He had of all heroes the highest renown<br>
 among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,<br>
 for deeds of daring that decked his name<br>
 since the hand and heart of Heremod<br>
 grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished<br>
 to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes,<br>
 to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow<br>
 had lamed him too long; a load of care<br>
 to earls and athelings all he proved.<br>
 Oft indeed, in earlier days,<br>
 for the warrior's wayfaring wise men mourned,<br>
 who had hoped of him help from harm and bale,<br>
 and had thought their sovran's son would thrive,<br>
 follow his father, his folk protect,<br>
 the hoard and the stronghold, heroes' land,<br>
 home of Scyldings. -- But here, thanes said,<br>
 the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed<br>
 to all: the other[2] was urged to crime!<br>
 And afresh to the race,[3] the fallow roads<br>
 by swift steeds measured! The morning sun<br>
 was climbing higher. Clansmen hastened<br>
 to the high-built hall, those hardy-minded,<br>
 the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure,<br>
 crowned with glory, the king himself,<br>
 with stately band from the bride-bower strode;<br>
 and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens<br>
 measured the path to the mead-house fair.<br>
 
 [1] "Guarded the treasure."<br>
 [2] Sc. Heremod.<br>
 [3] The singer has sung his lays, and the epic resumes its story. The
 time-relations are not altogether good in this long passage which describes
 the rejoicings of "the day after"; but the present shift from the riders
 on the road to the folk at the hall is not very violent, and is of a piece
 with the general style.<br>
