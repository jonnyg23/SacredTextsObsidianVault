 <h1 align="CENTER">XXXIV</h1>
 THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite<br>
 in after days; and to Eadgils he proved<br>
 friend to the friendless, and forces sent<br>
 over the sea to the son of Ohtere,<br>
 weapons and warriors: well repaid he<br>
 those care-paths cold when the king he slew.[1]<br>
 Thus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow<br>
 had passed a plenty, through perils dire,<br>
 with daring deeds, till this day was come<br>
 that doomed him now with the dragon to strive.<br>
 With comrades eleven the lord of Geats<br>
 swollen in rage went seeking the dragon.<br>
 He had heard whence all the harm arose<br>
 and the killing of clansmen; that cup of price<br>
 on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.<br>
 In the throng was this one thirteenth man,<br>
 starter of all the strife and ill,<br>
 care-laden captive; cringing thence<br>
 forced and reluctant, he led them on<br>
 till he came in ken of that cavern-hall,<br>
 the barrow delved near billowy surges,<br>
 flood of ocean. Within 'twas full<br>
 of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,<br>
 warrior trusty, the treasures held,<br>
 lurked in his lair. Not light the task<br>
 of entrance for any of earth-born men!<br>
 Sat on the headland the hero king,<br>
 spake words of hail to his hearth-companions,<br>
 gold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul,<br>
 wavering, death-bound. Wyrd full nigh<br>
 stood ready to greet the gray-haired man,<br>
 to seize his soul-hoard, sunder apart<br>
 life and body. Not long would be<br>
 the warrior's spirit enwound with flesh.<br>
 Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:--<br>
 "Through store of struggles I strove in youth,<br>
 mighty feuds; I mind them all.<br>
 I was seven years old when the sovran of rings,<br>
 friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,<br>
 had me, and held me, Hrethel the king,<br>
 with food and fee, faithful in kinship.<br>
 Ne'er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me,<br>
 bairn in the burg, than his birthright sons,<br>
 Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.<br>
 For the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,<br>
 by kinsman's deed, was the death-bed strewn,<br>
 when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,<br>
 his own dear liege laid low with an arrow,<br>
 missed the mark and his mate shot down,<br>
 one brother the other, with bloody shaft.<br>
 A feeless fight,[2] and a fearful sin,<br>
 horror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was,<br>
 unavenged must the atheling die!<br>
 Too awful it is for an aged man<br>
 to bide and bear, that his bairn so young<br>
 rides on the gallows. A rime he makes,<br>
 sorrow-song for his son there hanging<br>
 as rapture of ravens; no rescue now<br>
 can come from the old, disabled man!<br>
 Still is he minded, as morning breaks,<br>
 of the heir gone elsewhere;[3] another he hopes not<br>
 he will bide to see his burg within<br>
 as ward for his wealth, now the one has found<br>
 doom of death that the deed incurred.<br>
 Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son,<br>
 wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers<br>
 reft of revel. The rider sleepeth,<br>
 the hero, far-hidden;[4] no harp resounds,<br>
 in the courts no wassail, as once was heard.<br>
 
 [1] That is, Beowulf supports Eadgils against Onela, who is slain by Eadgils
 in revenge for the "care-paths" of exile into which Onela forced him.<br>
 [2] That is, the king could claim no wergild, or man-price, from one son
 for the killing of the other.<br>
 [3] Usual euphemism for death. <br>
 [4] Sc. in the grave.<br>
