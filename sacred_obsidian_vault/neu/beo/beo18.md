 THEN hastened those heroes their home to see,<br>
 friendless, to find the Frisian land,<br>
 houses and high burg. Hengest still<br>
 through the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn,<br>
 holding pact, yet of home he minded,<br>
 though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive<br>
 over the waters, now waves rolled fierce<br>
 lashed by the winds, or winter locked them<br>
 in icy fetters. Then fared another<br>
 year to men's dwellings, as yet they do,<br>
 the sunbright skies, that their season ever<br>
 duly await. Far off winter was driven;<br>
 fair lay earth's breast; and fain was the rover,<br>
 the guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered<br>
 on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep,<br>
 and how to hasten the hot encounter<br>
 where sons of the Frisians were sure to be.<br>
 So he escaped not the common doom,<br>
 when Hun with "Lafing," the light-of-battle,<br>
 best of blades, his bosom pierced:<br>
 its edge was famed with the Frisian earls.<br>
 On fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise,<br>
 on himself at home, the horrid sword-death;<br>
 for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack<br>
 had sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed,<br>
 mourning their woes.[1] Finn's wavering spirit<br>
 bode not in breast. The burg was reddened<br>
 with blood of foemen, and Finn was slain,<br>
 king amid clansmen; the queen was taken.<br>
 To their ship the Scylding warriors bore<br>
 all the chattels the chieftain owned,<br>
 whatever they found in Finn's domain<br>
 of gems and jewels. The gentle wife<br>
 o'er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore,<br>
 led to her land.<br>
 The lay was finished,<br>
 the gleeman's song. Then glad rose the revel;<br>
 bench-joy brightened. Bearers draw<br>
 from their "wonder-vats" wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth,<br>
 under gold-crown goes where the good pair sit,<br>
 uncle and nephew, true each to the other one,<br>
 kindred in amity. Unferth the spokesman<br>
 at the Scylding lord's feet sat: men had faith in his spirit,<br>
 his keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found him<br>
 unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke:<br>
 "Quaff of this cup, my king and lord,<br>
 breaker of rings, and blithe be thou,<br>
 gold-friend of men; to the Geats here speak<br>
 such words of mildness as man should use.<br>
 Be glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful,<br>
 or near or far, which now thou hast.<br>
 Men say to me, as son thou wishest<br>
 yon hero to hold. Thy Heorot purged,<br>
 jewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst,<br>
 with many a largess; and leave to thy kin<br>
 folk and realm when forth thou goest<br>
 to greet thy doom. For gracious I deem<br>
 my Hrothulf,[2] willing to hold and rule<br>
 nobly our youths, if thou yield up first,<br>
 prince of Scyldings, thy part in the world.<br>
 I ween with good he will well requite<br>
 offspring of ours, when all he minds<br>
 that for him we did in his helpless days<br>
 of gift and grace to gain him honor!"<br>
 Then she turned to the seat where her sons were placed,<br>
 Hrethric and Hrothmund, with heroes' bairns,<br>
 young men together: the Geat, too, sat there,<br>
 Beowulf brave, the brothers between.<br>
 
 [1] That is, these two Danes, escaping home, had told the story of the
 attack on Hnaef, the slaying of Hengest, and all the Danish woes. Collect-
 ing a force, they return to Frisia and kill Finn in his home.<br>
 [2] Nephew to Hrothgar, with whom he subsequently quarrels, and elder
 cousin to the two young sons of Hrothgar and Wealhtheow, -- their natural
 guardian in the event of the king's death. There is something finely femi-
 nine in this speech of Wealhtheow's, apart from its somewhat irregular and
 irrelevant sequence of topics. Both she and her lord probably distrust
 Hrothulf; but she bids the king to be of good cheer, and, turning to the
 suspect, heaps affectionate assurances on his probity. "My own Hrothulf"
 will surely not forget these favors and benefits of the past, but will repay
 them to the orphaned boy.<br>
