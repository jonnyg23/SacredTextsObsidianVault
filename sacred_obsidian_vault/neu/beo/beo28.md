 <h1 align="CENTER">XXVII</h1>
 CAME now to ocean the ever-courageous<br>
 hardy henchmen, their harness bearing,<br>
 woven war-sarks. The warden marked,<br>
 trusty as ever, the earl's return.<br>
 From the height of the hill no hostile words<br>
 reached the guests as he rode to greet them;<br>
 but "Welcome!" he called to that Weder clan<br>
 as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on.<br>
 Then on the strand, with steeds and treasure<br>
 and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship<br>
 was heavily laden: high its mast<br>
 rose over Hrothgar's hoarded gems.<br>
 A sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,<br>
 mounted with gold; on the mead-bench since<br>
 he was better esteemed, that blade possessing,<br>
 heirloom old. -- Their ocean-keel boarding,<br>
 they drove through the deep, and Daneland left.<br>
 A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,<br>
 firm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned;[1]<br>
 nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow<br>
 across from her course. The craft sped on,<br>
 foam-necked it floated forth o'er the waves,<br>
 keel firm-bound over briny currents,<br>
 till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs,<br>
 home-known headlands. High the boat,<br>
 stirred by winds, on the strand updrove.<br>
 Helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood,<br>
 who long already for loved companions<br>
 by the water had waited and watched afar.<br>
 He bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship<br>
 with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows<br>
 that trusty timber should tear away.<br>
 Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure,<br>
 gold and jewels; no journey far<br>
 was it thence to go to the giver of rings,<br>
 Hygelac Hrethling: at home he dwelt<br>
 by the sea-wall close, himself and clan.<br>
 Haughty that house, a hero the king,<br>
 high the hall, and Hygd[2] right young,<br>
 wise and wary, though winters few<br>
 in those fortress walls she had found a home,<br>
 Haereth's daughter. Nor humble her ways,<br>
 nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,<br>
 of precious treasure. Not Thryth's pride showed she,<br>
 folk-queen famed, or that fell deceit.<br>
 Was none so daring that durst make bold<br>
 (save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear<br>
 that lady full in the face to look,<br>
 but forged fetters he found his lot,<br>
 bonds of death! And brief the respite;<br>
 soon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken,<br>
 and the burnished blade a baleful murder<br>
 proclaimed and closed. No queenly way<br>
 for woman to practise, though peerless she,<br>
 that the weaver-of-peace[3] from warrior dear<br>
 by wrath and lying his life should reave!<br>
 But Hemming's kinsman hindered this. --<br>
 For over their ale men also told<br>
 that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,<br>
 onslaughts of evil, after she went,<br>
 gold-decked bride, to the brave young prince,<br>
 atheling haughty, and Offa's hall<br>
 o'er the fallow flood at her father's bidding<br>
 safely sought, where since she prospered,<br>
 royal, throned, rich in goods,<br>
 fain of the fair life fate had sent her,<br>
 and leal in love to the lord of warriors.<br>
 He, of all heroes I heard of ever<br>
 from sea to sea, of the sons of earth,<br>
 most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised<br>
 for his fighting and feeing by far-off men,<br>
 the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled<br>
 over his empire. Eomer woke to him,<br>
 help of heroes, Hemming's kinsman,<br>
 Grandson of Garmund, grim in war.<br>
 
 [1] With the speed of the boat.<br>
 [2] Queen to Hygelac. She is praised by contrast with the antitype, Thryth,
 just as Beowulf was praised by contrast with Heremod.<br>
 [3] Kenning for "wife."<br>
