 BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<br>
 "Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene<br>
 gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,<br>
 sovran wise, what once was said:<br>
 if in thy cause it came that I<br>
 should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide<br>
 to me, though fallen, in father's place!<br>
 Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,<br>
 my warrior-friends, if War should seize me;<br>
 and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,<br>
 Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send!<br>
 Geatland's king may ken by the gold,<br>
 Hrethel's son see, when he stares at the treasure,<br>
 that I got me a friend for goodness famed,<br>
 and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.<br>
 And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword,<br>
 earl far-honored, this heirloom precious,<br>
 hard of edge: with Hrunting I<br>
 seek doom of glory, or Death shall take me."<br>
 After these words the Weder-Geat lord<br>
 boldly hastened, biding never<br>
 answer at all: the ocean floods<br>
 closed o'er the hero. Long while of the day<br>
 fled ere he felt the floor of the sea.<br>
 Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain<br>
 sword-hungry held these hundred winters,<br>
 greedy and grim, that some guest from above,<br>
 some man, was raiding her monster-realm.<br>
 She grasped out for him with grisly claws,<br>
 and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not<br>
 his body hale; the breastplate hindered,<br>
 as she strove to shatter the sark of war,<br>
 the linked harness, with loathsome hand.<br>
 Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,<br>
 the lord of rings to the lair she haunted<br>
 whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held,<br>
 weapon to wield against wondrous monsters<br>
 that sore beset him; sea-beasts many<br>
 tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,<br>
 and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked<br>
 he was now in some hall, he knew not which,<br>
 where water never could work him harm,<br>
 nor through the roof could reach him ever<br>
 fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw,<br>
 beams of a blaze that brightly shone.<br>
 Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,<br>
 mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke<br>
 he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not.<br>
 Then sang on her head that seemly blade<br>
 its war-song wild. But the warrior found<br>
 the light-of-battle[1] was loath to bite,<br>
 to harm the heart: its hard edge failed<br>
 the noble at need, yet had known of old<br>
 strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven,<br>
 doomed men's fighting-gear. First time, this,<br>
 for the gleaming blade that its glory fell.<br>
 Firm still stood, nor failed in valor,<br>
 heedful of high deeds, Hygelac's kinsman;<br>
 flung away fretted sword, featly jewelled,<br>
 the angry earl; on earth it lay<br>
 steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted,<br>
 hand-gripe of might. So man shall do<br>
 whenever in war he weens to earn him<br>
 lasting fame, nor fears for his life!<br>
 Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat,<br>
 the Geatish war-prince Grendel's mother.<br>
 Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,<br>
 his deadly foe, that she fell to ground.<br>
 Swift on her part she paid him back<br>
 with grisly grasp, and grappled with him.<br>
 Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,<br>
 fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown.<br>
 On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword,<br>
 broad and brown-edged,[2] the bairn to avenge,<br>
 the sole-born son. -- On his shoulder lay<br>
 braided breast-mail, barring death,<br>
 withstanding entrance of edge or blade.<br>
 Life would have ended for Ecgtheow's son,<br>
 under wide earth for that earl of Geats,<br>
 had his armor of war not aided him,<br>
 battle-net hard, and holy God<br>
 wielded the victory, wisest Maker.<br>
 The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;<br>
 and easily rose the earl erect.<br>
 
 [1] Kenning for "sword." Hrunting is bewitched, laid under a spell of
 uselessness, along with all other swords.<br>
 [2] This brown of swords, evidently meaning burnished, bright, continues to
 be a favorite adjective in the popular ballads.<br>
