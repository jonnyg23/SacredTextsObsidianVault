 I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan<br>
 at wish and word of his wounded king, --<br>
 war-sick warrior, -- woven mail-coat,<br>
 battle-sark, bore 'neath the barrow's roof.<br>
 Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud,<br>
 passing the seat,[1] saw store of jewels<br>
 and glistening gold the ground along;<br>
 by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel<br>
 in the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old:<br>
 unburnished bowls of bygone men<br>
 reft of richness; rusty helms<br>
 of the olden age; and arm-rings many<br>
 wondrously woven. -- Such wealth of gold,<br>
 booty from barrow, can burden with pride<br>
 each human wight: let him hide it who will! --<br>
 His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner<br>
 high o'er the hoard, of handiwork noblest,<br>
 brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,<br>
 all the earth-floor he easily saw<br>
 and viewed all these vessels. No vestige now<br>
 was seen of the serpent: the sword had ta'en him.<br>
 Then, I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft,<br>
 old work of giants, by one alone;<br>
 he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate<br>
 at his own good will, and the ensign took,<br>
 brightest of beacons. -- The blade of his lord<br>
 -- its edge was iron -- had injured deep<br>
 one that guarded the golden hoard<br>
 many a year and its murder-fire<br>
 spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows<br>
 at midnight hour, till it met its doom.<br>
 Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him<br>
 his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,<br>
 high-souled hero, if haply he'd find<br>
 alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,<br>
 weakening fast by the wall of the cave.<br>
 So he carried the load. His lord and king<br>
 he found all bleeding, famous chief<br>
 at the lapse of life. The liegeman again<br>
 plashed him with water, till point of word<br>
 broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,<br>
 sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. --<br>
 "For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks,<br>
 to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,<br>
 for what I behold, to Heaven's Lord,<br>
 for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk<br>
 or ever the day of my death be run!<br>
 Now I've bartered here for booty of treasure<br>
 the last of my life, so look ye well<br>
 to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry.<br>
 A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise<br>
 for my ashes. 'Twill shine by the shore of the flood,<br>
 to folk of mine memorial fair<br>
 on Hrones Headland high uplifted,<br>
 that ocean-wanderers oft may hail<br>
 Beowulf's Barrow, as back from far<br>
 they drive their keels o'er the darkling wave."<br>
 From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold,<br>
 valorous king, to his vassal gave it<br>
 with bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring,<br>
 to the youthful thane: bade him use them in joy.<br>
 "Thou art end and remnant of all our race<br>
 the Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,<br>
 all my line, to the land of doom,<br>
 earls in their glory: I after them go."<br>
 This word was the last which the wise old man<br>
 harbored in heart ere hot death-waves<br>
 of balefire he chose. From his bosom fled<br>
 his soul to seek the saints' reward.<br>
