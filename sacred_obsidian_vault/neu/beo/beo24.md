 'MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,<br>
 old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,<br>
 warriors' heirloom, weapon unmatched,<br>
 -- save only 'twas more than other men<br>
 to bandy-of-battle could bear at all --<br>
 as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen.<br>
 Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings' chieftain,<br>
 bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,<br>
 reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote<br>
 that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,<br>
 her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through<br>
 that fated-one's flesh: to floor she sank.<br>
 Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed.<br>
 Then blazed forth light. 'Twas bright within<br>
 as when from the sky there shines unclouded<br>
 heaven's candle. The hall he scanned.<br>
 By the wall then went he; his weapon raised<br>
 high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane,<br>
 angry and eager. That edge was not useless<br>
 to the warrior now. He wished with speed<br>
 Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many,<br>
 for the war he waged on Western-Danes<br>
 oftener far than an only time,<br>
 when of Hrothgar's hearth-companions<br>
 he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,<br>
 fifteen men of the folk of Danes,<br>
 and as many others outward bore,<br>
 his horrible prey. Well paid for that<br>
 the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw<br>
 Grendel stretched there, spent with war,<br>
 spoiled of life, so scathed had left him<br>
 Heorot's battle. The body sprang far<br>
 when after death it endured the blow,<br>
 sword-stroke savage, that severed its head.<br>
 Soon,[1] then, saw the sage companions<br>
 who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood,<br>
 that the tossing waters turbid grew,<br>
 blood-stained the mere. Old men together,<br>
 hoary-haired, of the hero spake;<br>
 the warrior would not, they weened, again,<br>
 proud of conquest, come to seek<br>
 their mighty master. To many it seemed<br>
 the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life.<br>
 The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings<br>
 left the headland; homeward went<br>
 the gold-friend of men.[2] But the guests sat on,<br>
 stared at the surges, sick in heart,<br>
 and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord again to see.<br>
 Now that sword began,<br>
 from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,[3]<br>
 war-blade, to wane: 'twas a wondrous thing<br>
 that all of it melted as ice is wont<br>
 when frosty fetters the Father loosens,<br>
 unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all<br>
 seasons and times: the true God he!<br>
 Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats<br>
 precious things, though a plenty he saw,<br>
 save only the head and that hilt withal<br>
 blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted,<br>
 burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,<br>
 so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there.<br>
 Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat<br>
 downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.<br>
 The clashing waters were cleansed now,<br>
 waste of waves, where the wandering fiend<br>
 her life-days left and this lapsing world.<br>
 Swam then to strand the sailors'-refuge,<br>
 sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,<br>
 of burden brave he bore with him.<br>
 Went then to greet him, and God they thanked,<br>
 the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,<br>
 that safe and sound they could see him again.<br>
 Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor<br>
 deftly they doffed: now drowsed the mere,<br>
 water 'neath welkin, with war-blood stained.<br>
 Forth they fared by the footpaths thence,<br>
 merry at heart the highways measured,<br>
 well-known roads. Courageous men<br>
 carried the head from the cliff by the sea,<br>
 an arduous task for all the band,<br>
 the firm in fight, since four were needed<br>
 on the shaft-of-slaughter[4] strenuously<br>
 to bear to the gold-hall Grendel's head.<br>
 So presently to the palace there<br>
 foemen fearless, fourteen Geats,<br>
 marching came. Their master-of-clan<br>
 mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.<br>
 Strode then within the sovran thane<br>
 fearless in fight, of fame renowned,<br>
 hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet.<br>
 And next by the hair into hall was borne<br>
 Grendel's head, where the henchmen were drinking,<br>
 an awe to clan and queen alike,<br>
 a monster of marvel: the men looked on.<br>
 
 [1] After the killing of the monster and Grendel's decapitation.<br>
 [2] Hrothgar.<br>
 [3] The blade slowly dissolves in blood-stained drops like icicles. <br>
 [4] Spear.<br>
