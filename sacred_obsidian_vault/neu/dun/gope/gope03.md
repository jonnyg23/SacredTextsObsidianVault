 <p align="center">INTRODUCTION</p>  
 <p>Before there stood gods upon Olympus, or ever Allah was Allah, had wrought and rested MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.</p>  
 <p>There are in Pegana Mung and Sish and Kib, and the maker of all small gods, who is MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Moreover, we have a faith in Roon and Slid.</p>  
 <p>And it has been said of old that all things that have been were wrought by the small gods, excepting only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, who made the gods and hath thereafter rested.</p>  
 <p>And none may pray to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI but only the gods whom he hath made.</p>  
 <p>But at the Last will MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI forget to rest, and will make again new gods and other worlds, and will destroy the gods whom he hath made.</p>  
 <p>And the gods and the worlds shall depart, and there shall be only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.</p>
