 <i></i><p>Then Igor gazed up at the bright sun, and saw all his warriors covered 
 with the darkness [that proceeded] out of it. And Igor said to his
 druzhina:--"Brothers and druzhina! Better is it to be hewn to pieces
 than to be captive! So let us mount, brothers, on our swift
 steeds and look upon the blue Don!"</p>
 </dir>
 <p>
 The Story of Igor is a long Russian ballad from the 12th century.
 This work is often referred to simply as the <cite>Slovo</cite>, the <cite>Tale</cite> (from its Russian title
 <cite>Slovo o pol'ku Igoreve</cite>).
 In the 12th century Russia was a small feuding group of city states, without
 central authority or cohesion.
 Fifty years hence, the Mongolians would roll over the Russians and
 rule them with an iron fist for two centuries.
 But at that time the most persistent enemies of the Russians were
 the fierce Polovtsi nomads.
 They roamed the wide grassy plains of the Don and Dnepr
 down to the inland seas, to the south of Russian territory.
 In 1185 a minor skirmish between the Polovtsi and Igor Svyatoslavich,
 a noble of Chernigov, a city in what it today the Ukraine, was
 immortalized in this poem.
 </p>
 <p>
 This was not a strategic battle: Igor had marched with his brothers
 on a grudge, having been excluded from a larger expedition, and the
 encounter with the enemy was purely impromptu.
 Nor was it a victory: Igor was wounded and captured in battle,
 later escaping to walk back to Chernigov.
 Out of this incident, however, was built one of the first
 treasures of Russian literature.
 There are vivid natural metaphors, the evocation of Slavic pagan
 deities, and the stirring description of combat.
 There an appeal for Russian national unity,
 as the poet pleads for each of the factions to support Igor
 in his hour of need.
 Even more striking is the fact that we know nothing
 about the author of the <cite>Slovo</cite>, other than that he was
 a contemporary of the events he wrote about--perhaps even a witness.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <cite>Slovo</cite> was discovered in 1795 in a bundle of manuscripts
 purchased from a monastery.
 It was published in 1800, although most of the print run was destroyed
 along with the original manuscript in 1812 during the fire which
 the retreating forces of Napoleon set to Moscow.
 There have always been nagging doubts about the authenticity of
 the poem, because no other manuscript of it has ever been found.
 Some have speculated that this may be because of the explicit pagan beliefs in
 the <cite>Slovo</cite>, which may have led the Church to quietly shelve it.
 It would be nearly impossible to forge this text,
 as it is written in very archaic Russian which has
 stood up to modern linguistic studies.
 </p>
 <p>
 The 19th century opera <cite>Prince Igor</cite>, by Bordin and
 Rimsky-Korsakov was based on the <cite>Slovo</cite>.
 An excerpt from this opera, the orchestral <cite>Polovetsian Suite</cite>
 is a staple in the 'pops classical' repertoire.
 </p>
 <p>
 This, the Magnus translation, is the only public
 domain English translation of the <cite>Slovo</cite>,
 and it makes its first appearance on the Internet at this site; it is long
 out of print and hard to obtain.
 There is a notable 1960 translation by Vladimir Nabokov, the author
 of <cite>Lolita</cite> (see box on the right), which is currently
 out of print but available used in at least two editions.
 Nabokov describes Magnus' work as "a bizarre blend of incredible
 blunders, fantastic emendations, erratic erudition and shrewd guesses."
 However, as this is the only one currently in the public domain
 in the US, it will have to suffice.
 Among the features of this edition are a dozen genealogical
 charts of the Russian noble families of the period, which Nabokov
 considered very helpful in preparing his translation.
