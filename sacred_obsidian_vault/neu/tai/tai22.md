   <h3 align="center">IV. THE COMPOSITION OF THE POEM.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(A) THE VERSIFICATION.</h3>  
 <p>The principal authority on this head is Korš, whose edition of the text is virtually a monograph and metrical reconstruction. With his bold interpolations and omissions it would be premature to agree; his accentual lore one must gratefully follow.</p>  
 <p>The metrical basis consists of two main accents, the first of which may be preceded, by one, two or more enclitic syllables, each foot usually</p>  
 <p><a name="page_xi"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xi</font></a></p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>being dactylic: these two accents are followed by a caesura, after which comes a third subsidiary dactylic ending, such as is always found in the ballad metre. Examples of such perfect lines are</p>

 <p>To analyse the metre in full would betray me into a discussion, too long for this introduction; and I rather doubt whether it would be profitable, either to truth, or the advancement of the subject. The few hints given in this section are all derived from Korš; for the rest the reader had far better trust to his own ear; and the richness of this three-beat</p>  
 <p><a name="page_xlii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xlii</font></a></p>  
 <p>measure will ring out. The position of the accented syllable in the foot is variable, as also, within reason,--unlike the style of the later <i>bylíny</i>,--the number of the unaccented syllables.</p>  
 <p>The regularity of the alliteration approximates the metre to that of the old German poems; but the freedom of the Slav has released this Russian verse from the stiffness and artificiality that characterize some of the Early English alliterative poems.</p>  
 <p>Later, this Russian liberty of accent and syllabization developed into anarchy in the popular ballads; and form had to be restored to Russian verse in the eighteenth century by the imitation of Western models.</p>  
 <p>The Slóvo is important in the history of early Slav literature, not least as an instance of native poetry with the just balance of form and license.</p>
