 <p>The text is based on Pekárski's Екатерининскій Списокъ as emended by Simoni. The two texts are called Е and С: variants in the printed text of 1800 of Musin-Puškin being designated as П.</p>  
 <p>The lines and divisions of the text are the editor's: the original manuscript having been unpunctuated, unparagraphed and with the words unintervalled.</p>  
 <p>Emendations of the text are marked by italicized type.</p>  
 <p>The notes (with reference to the lines) are in the order of the <i>Russian</i> alphabet for easy reference: the words annotated have a little 'n' after them: where an emendation has been made, the word is to be found under the <i>original</i> form as stated in the variants.</p>
