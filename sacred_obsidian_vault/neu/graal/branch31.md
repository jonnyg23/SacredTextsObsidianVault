 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXXI</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Thereupon the story is silent of Lancelot, and cometh back to
 Perceval that had not heard these tidings, and if he had known
 them, right sorrowful would he have been thereof.  He is departed
 from his uncle's castle that he hath reconquered, and was sore
 grieved of the tidings that the damsel that was wounded brought
 him of his sister that Aristor had carried away by force to the
 house of a vavasour.  He was about to take her to wife and cut
 off her head on the day of the New Year, for such was his custom
 with all them that he took.  Perceval rideth one day, all heavy
 in thought, and taketh his way as fast as he may toward the
 hermitage of his uncle King Hermit.  He is come thither on an
 eventide, and seeth three hermits issued forth of the hermitage.
 He alighteth and goeth to meet them so soon as he seeth them.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say the hermits, "Enter not in, for they are laying out a
 body there."
 </p><p>
 "Who is it?" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say the hermits, "It is the good King Pelles that Aristor
 slew suddenly after mass on account of one of his nephews,
 Perceval, whom he loveth not, and a damsel is laying out the body
 there within."
 </p><p>
 When Perceval heard the news or his uncle that is dead, thereof
 was he right grieved at heart, and on the morrow was he at his
 uncle's burial.  When mass was sung, Perceval would have
 departed, as he that had great desire to take vengeance on him
 that had done him such shame.

 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon behold you the damsel that is his.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Full long time have I been seeking you. 
 Behold here the head of a knight that I carry hanging at the bow
 of my saddle, in this rich casket of ivory that you may see, and
 by none ought he to be avenged but by you alone.  Discharge me
 thereof, fair Sir, of your courtesy, for I have carried it too
 long a time, and this King Arthur knoweth well and Messire
 Gawain, for each hath seen me at court along with the head, but
 they could give me no tidings of you, and my castle may I not
 have again until such time as he be avenged."
 </p><p>
 "Who, then, was the knight, damsel?" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, he was son of your uncle Bruns Brandalis, and were he on
 live, would have been one of the best knights in the world."
 </p><p>
 "And who slew him, damsel?" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, the Knight of the Deep Forest that leadeth the lion, foully
 in treason there where he thought him safe.  For had he been
 armed in like manner as was the other, he would not have slain
 him."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," said Perceval, "This grieveth me that he hath slain
 him, and it grieveth me likewise of mine uncle King Hermit, whom
 I would avenge more willingly than all the men in the world, for
 he was slain on my account."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 "Most disloyal was this knight, and foully was he fain to avenge
 him when he slew a holy man, a hermit that never wished him ill
 on account of me and of none other.  Right glad shall I be and I
 may find the knight, and so, methinketh, will he be of me, for me
 he hateth as much as I do him, as I have been told, and Lord God
 grant, howsoever he may take it, that I may find him betimes."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "So outrageous a knight is he that no
 knight is there in the world so good but he thinketh himself of
 more worth than he, and sith that he hateth you with a will, and
 he knew that you were here, you and another, or you the third, he
 would come now at once, were he in place and free."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Perceval, "God give him mischief of his coming,
 come whensoever he may!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "The Deep Forest there, where the Red Knight
 leadeth the lion, is towards the castle of Aristor, and, or ever
 you come by adventure into the forest, you may well hear some
 tidings of him!"
