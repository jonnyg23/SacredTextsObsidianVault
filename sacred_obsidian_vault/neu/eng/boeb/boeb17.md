 <h1 align="CENTER">Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>WHEN shaws beene sheene, and shradds full fayre,<br>
   And leaves both large and longe,<br>
 Itt is merrye walkyng in the fayre forrèst<br>
   To heare the small birdes songe.</p>
 <p>The woodweele sang, and wold not cease,<br>
   Sitting upon the spraye,<br>
 Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,<br>
   In the greenwood where he lay.</p>
 <p>"Now, by my faye," sayd jollye Robin,<br>
   "A sweaven I had this night;<br>
 I dreamt me of tow wighty yemen,<br>
   That fast with me can fight.</p>
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a></p>
 <p>"Methought they did mee beate and binde,<br>
   And tooke my bow mee froe;<br>
 Iff I be Robin alive in this lande,<br>
   Ile be wroken on them towe."</p>
 <p>"Sweavens are swift, master," quoth John,<br>
   "As the wind that blowes ore the hill;<br>
 For if itt be never so loude this night,<br>
   To-morrow it may be still."</p>
 <p>"Buske yee, bowne yee, my merry men all,<br>
   And John shall goe with mee,<br>
 For Ile goe seeke yond wight yeomen,<br>
   In greenwood where the bee."</p>
 <p>Then they cast on their gownes of grene,<br>
   And tooke theyr bowes each one;<br>
 And they away to the greene forrèst<br>
   A shooting forth are gone;</p>
 <p>Untill they came to the merry greenwood,<br>
   Where they had gladdest to bee;<br>
 There were they ware of a wight yeomàn,<br>
   His body leaned to a tree.</p>
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>
 <p>A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,<br>
   Of manye a man the bane;<br>
 And he was clad in his capull hyde,<br>
   Topp and tayll and mayne.</p>
 <p>"Stand you still, master," quoth Little John,<br>
   "Under this tree so grene,<br>
 And I will go to yond wight yeomàn<br>
   To know what he doth meane."</p>
 <p>"Ah! John, by me thou settest noe store,<br>
   And that I farley finde:<br>
 How offt send I my men beffore,<br>
   And tarry my selfe behinde!</p>
 <p>"It is no cunning a knave to ken,<br>
   And a man but heare him speake;<br>
 And itt were not for bursting of my bowe,<br>
   John, I thy head wold breake."</p>
 <p>As often wordes they breeden bale,<br>
   So they parted Robin and John;<br>
 And John is gone to Barnesdale;<br>
   The gates he knoweth eche one.</p>
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>
 <p>But when he came to Barnesdale,<br>
   Great heavinesse there hee hadd,<br>
 For he found tow of his owne fellòwes<br>
   Were slaine both in a slade.</p>
 <p>And Scarlette he was flying a-foote<br>
   Faste over stocke and stone,<br>
 For the sheriffe with seven score men<br>
   Fast after him is gone.</p>
 <p>"One shoote now I will shoote," quoth John,<br>
   "With Christ his might and mayne;<br>
 Ile make yond fellow that flyes soe fast,<br>
   To stopp he shall be fayne."</p>
 <p>Then John bent up his long bende-bowe,<br>
   And fetteled him to shoote:<br>
 The bow was made of tender boughe,<br>
   And fell down to his foote.</p>
 <p>"Woe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood,<br>
   That ere thou grew on a tree;<br>
 For now this day thou art my bale,<br>
   My boote when thou shold bee."</p>
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 110</font></a></p>
 <p>His shoote it was but loosely shott,<br>
   Yet flewe not the arrowe in vaine,<br>
 For itt mett one of the sherriffes men,<br>
   Good William a Trent was slaine.</p>
 <p>It had bene better of William a Trent<br>
   To have bene abed with sorrowe,<br>
 Than to be that day in the green-wood slade<br>
   To meet with Little Johns arrowe.</p>
 <p>But as it is said, when men be mett<br>
   Fyve can doe more than three,<br>
 The sheriffe hath taken Little John,<br>
   And bound him fast to a tree.</p>
 <p>"Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe,<br>
   And hanged hye on a hill;"<br>
 But thou mayst fayle of thy purpose," quoth John,<br>
   If itt be Christ his will."</p>
 <p>Lett us leave talking of Little John,<br>
   And thinke of Robin Hood,<br>
 How he is gone to the wight yeomàn,<br>
   Where under the leaves he stood.</p>

 <p>"Good morrowe, good fellowe," sayd Robin so fayre,<br>
   "Good morrowe, good fellow," quoth he.<br>
 "Methinks by this bowe thou beares in thy hande,<br>
   A good archere thou sholdst bee."</p>
 <p>"I am wilfulle of my waye," quo' the yeoman,<br>
   "And of my morning tyde:"<br>
 "Ile lead thee through the wood," sayd Robin,<br>
   "Good fellow, Ile be thy guide."</p>
 <p>"I seeke an outlàwe," the straunger sayd,<br>
   "Men call him Robin Hood;<br>
 Rather Ild meet with that proud outlàwe<br>
   Than fortye pound soe good."</p>
 <p>"Now come with me, thou wight yemàn,<br>
   And Robin thou soone shalt see;<br>
 But first let us some pastime find<br>
   Under the greenwood tree.</p>
 <p>"First let us some masterye make<br>
   Among the woods so even;<br>
 We may chance to meet with Robin Hood<br>
   Here att some unsett steven."</p>
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a></p>
 <p>They cutt them down two summer shroggs,<br>
   That grew both under a breere,<br>
 And set them threescore rood in twaine,<br>
   To shoote the prickes y-fere.</p>
 <p>"Leade on, good fellowe," quoth Robin Hood,<br>
   "Leade on, I doe bidd thee."<br>
 "Nay, by my faith, good fellowe," hee sayd,<br>
   "My leader thou shalt bee."</p>
 <p>The first time Robin shot at the pricke,<br>
   He mist but an inch it fro;<br>
 The yeoman he was an archer good,<br>
   But he cold never shoote soe.</p>
 <p>The second shoote had the wightye yeomàn,<br>
   He shote within the garlànde;<br>
 But Robin he shott far better than hee,<br>
   For he clave the good pricke-wande.</p>
 <p>A blessing upon thy heart," he sayd,<br>
   "Good fellowe, thy shooting is goode<br>
 For an thy hart be as good as thy hand,<br>
   Thou wert better then Robin Hoode.</p>
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a></p>
 <p>Now tell me thy name, good fellowe," sayd he,<br>
   "Under the leaves of lyne."<br>
 Nay, by my faith," quoth bolde Robin,<br>
   "Till thou have told me thine."</p>
 <p>"I dwell by dale and downe," quoth hee,<br>
   "And Robin to take Ime sworne;<br>
 And when I am called by my right name,<br>
   I am Guy of good Gisbòrne."</p>
 <p>"My dwelling is in this wood," sayes Robin,<br>
   "By thee I set right nought:<br>
 I am Robin Hood of Barnèsdale,<br>
   Whom thou so long hast sought."</p>
 <p>He that had neither beene kithe nor kin,<br>
   Might have seen a full fayre sight,<br>
 To see how together these yeomen went<br>
   With blades both browne and bright:</p>
 <p>To see how these yeomen together they fought<br>
   Two howres of a summers day,<br>
 Yett neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy<br>
   Them fettled to flye away.</p>
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a></p>
 <p>Robin was reachles on a roote,<br>
   And stumbled at that tyde;<br>
 And Guy was quicke and nimble with-all,<br>
   And hitt him ore the left side.</p>
 <p>"Ah, deere Lady," sayd Robin Hood tho,<br>
   "Thou art but mother and may';<br>
 I think it was never mans destinye<br>
   To dye before his day."</p>
 <p>Robin thought on Our Ladye deere,<br>
   And soone leapt up againe,<br>
 And strait he came with a 'backward' stroke,<br>
   And he Sir Guy hath slayne.</p>
 <p>He took Sir Guy's head by the hayre,<br>
   And stuck itt upon his bowes end:<br>
 "Thou hast beene a traytor all thy liffe,<br>
   Which thing must have an end."</p>
 <p>Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe,<br>
   And nicked Sir Guy in the face,<br>
 That he was never on woman born<br>
   Cold tell whose head it was.</p>
 <p> </p>

 <p> </p>
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a></p>
 <p>Sayes, "Lye there, lye there now, Sir Guy,<br>
   And with me be not wrothe;<br>
 Iff thou have had the worst strokes at my hand,<br>
   Thou shalt have the better clothe."</p>
 <p>Robin did off his gowne of greene,<br>
   And on Sir Guy did throwe,<br>
 And hee put on that capull hyde,<br>
   That cladd him topp to toe.</p>
 <p>"The bowe, the arrowes, and litle horne,<br>
   Now with me I will beare;<br>
 For I will away to Barnèsdale,<br>
   To see how my men doe fare."</p>
 <p>Robin Hood sett Guy's horne to his mouth,<br>
   And a loud blast in it did blow:<br>
 That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham,<br>
   As he leaned under a lowe.</p>
 <p>Hearken, hearken," sayd the sheriffe,<br>
   "I heare nowe tydings good,<br>
 For yonder I heare Sir Guy's horne blowe,<br>
   And he hath slaine Robin Hoode.</p>
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p>
 <p>"Yonder I heare Sir Guy's horne blowe,<br>
   Itt blowes soe well in tyde,<br>
 And yonder comes that wightye yeomàn,<br>
   Cladd in his capull hyde.</p>
 <p>"Come hyther, come hyther, thou good Sir Guy,<br>
   Aske what thou wilt of mee."<br>
 "O I will none of thy gold," sayd Robin,<br>
   "Nor I will none of thy fee.</p>
 <p>"But now I have slaine the master," he sayes,<br>
   "Let me goe strike the knave;<br>
 For this is all the rewarde I aske.<br>
   Nor noe other will I have."</p>
 <p>"Thou art a madman," said the sheriffe,<br>
   "Thou sholdst have had a knightes fee;<br>
 But seeing thy asking hath beene soe bad,<br>
   Well granted it shale be."</p>
 <p>When Little John heard his master speake,<br>
   Well knewe he it was his steven;<br>
 Now shall I be looset," quoth Little John,<br>
   With Christ his might in heaven."</p>
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p>
 <p>Fast Robin hee hyed him to Little John,<br>
   He thought to loose him belive:<br>
 The sheriffe and all his companye<br>
   Fast after him can drive.</p>
 <p>"Stand abacke, stand abacke," sayd Robin;<br>
   "Why draw you mee so neere?<br>
 Itt was never the use in our countryè,<br>
   Ones shrift another shold heere."</p>
 <p>But Robin pulled forth an Irysh knife,<br>
   And losed John hand and foote,<br>
 And gave him Sir Guy's bow into his hand,<br>
   And bade it be his boote.</p>
 <p>Then John he took Guy's bow in his hand,<br>
   His boltes and arrowes eche one:<br>
 When the sheriffe saw Little John bend his bow,<br>
   He fettled him to be gone.</p>
 <p>Towards his house in Nottingham towne<br>
   He fled full fast away,<br>
 And soe did all the companye,<br>
   Not one behind wold stay.</p>
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a></p>
 <p>But he cold neither runne soe fast,<br>
   Nor away soe fast cold ryde,<br>
 But Little John with an arrowe soe broad<br>
   He shott him into the 'backe'-syde.</p>
