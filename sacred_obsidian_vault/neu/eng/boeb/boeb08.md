 <h1 align="CENTER">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>As it fell out on a long summer's day,<br>
   Two lovers they sat on a hill;<br>
 They sat together that long summer's day,<br>
   And could not talk their fill.</p>
 <p>"I see no harm by you, Margarèt,<br>
   And you see none by mee;<br>
 Before to-morrow at eight o' the clock<br>
   A rich wedding you shall see."</p>
 <p>Fair Margaret sat in her bower-windòw,<br>
   Combing her yellow hair;<br>
 There she spyed sweet William and his bride,<br>
   As they were a riding near.</p>
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a></p>
 <p>Then down she layd her ivory combe,<br>
   And braided her hair in twain:<br>
 She went alive out of her bower,<br>
   But ne'er came alive in't again.</p>
 <p>When day was gone, and night was come,<br>
   And all men fast asleep,<br>
 Then came the spirit of Fair Marg'ret,<br>
   And stood at William's feet.</p>
 <p>"Are you awake, sweet William?" shee said,<br>
   "Or, sweet William, are you asleep?<br>
 God give you joy of your gay bride-bed,<br>
   And me of my winding sheet."</p>
 <p>When day was come, and night was gone,<br>
   And all men wak'd from sleep,<br>
 Sweet William to his lady sayd,<br>
   "My dear, I have cause to weep.</p>
 <p>"I dreamt a dream, my dear ladyè,<br>
   Such dreames are never good:<br>
 I dreamt my bower was full of red 'wine,'<br>
   And my bride-bed full of blood."</p>
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>
 <p>"Such dreams, such dreams, my honoured sir,<br>
   They never do prove good;<br>
 To dream thy bower was full of red 'wine,'<br>
   And thy bride-bed full of blood."</p>
 <p>He called up his merry men all,<br>
   By one, by two, and by three;<br>
 Saying, "I'll away to fair Marg'ret's bower,<br>
   By the leave of my ladiè."</p>
 <p>And when he came to fair Marg'ret's bower,<br>
   He knocked at the ring;<br>
 And who so ready as her seven brethrèn<br>
   To let sweet William in.</p>
 <p>Then he turned up the covering-sheet;<br>
   "Pray let me see the dead;<br>
 Methinks she looks all pale and wan.<br>
   She hath lost her cherry red.</p>
 <p>"I'll do more for thee, Margarèt,<br>
   Than any of thy kin:<br>
 For I will kiss thy pale wan lips,<br>
   Though a smile I cannot win."</p>
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>
 <p>With that bespake the seven brethrèn,<br>
   Making most piteous mone,<br>
 "You may go kiss your jolly brown bride,<br>
   And let our sister alone."</p>
 <p>"If I do kiss my jolly brown bride,<br>
   I do but what is right;<br>
 I ne'er made a vow to yonder poor corpse,<br>
   By day, nor yet by night.</p>
 <p>"Deal on, deal on, my merry men all,<br>
   Deal on your cake and your wine:<br>
 For whatever is dealt at her funeral to-day,<br>
   Shall be dealt to-morrow at mine."</p>
 <p>Fair Margaret dyed to-day, to-day,<br>
   Sweet William dyed the morrow:<br>
 Fair Margaret dyed for pure true love,<br>
   Sweet William dyed for sorrow.</p>
 <p>Margaret was buryed in the lower chancèl,<br>
   And William in the higher:<br>
 Out of her brest there sprang a rose,<br>
   And out of his a briar.</p>
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>
 <p>They grew till they grew unto the church top,<br>
   And then they could grow no higher;<br>
 And there they tyed in a true lover's knot,<br>
   Which made all the people admire.</p>
 <p>Then came the clerk of the parish,<br>
   As you the truth shall hear,<br>
 And by misfortune cut them down,<br>
   Or they had now been there.</p>
