 <h1 align="CENTER">The Bailiff's Daughter of Islington</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>THERE was a youthe, and a well-beloved youthe,<br>
   And he was a squire's son;<br>
 He loved the bayliffe's daughter deare,<br>
   That lived in Islington.</p>
 <p>Yet she was coye, and would not believe<br>
   That he did love her soe,<br>
 Noe nor at any time would she<br>
   Any countenance to him showe.</p>
 <p>But when his friendes did understand<br>
   His fond and foolish minde,<br>
 They sent him up to faire London,<br>
   An apprentice for to binde.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>And when he had been seven long yeares,<br>
   And never his love could see,--<br>
 "Many a teare have I shed for her sake,<br>
   When she little thought of mee."</p>
 <p>Then all the maids of Islington<br>
   Went forth to sport and playe,<br>
 All but the bayliffe's daughter deare;<br>
   She secretly stole awaye.</p>
 <p>She pulled off her gowne of greene,<br>
   And put on ragged attire,<br>
 And to faire London she would go<br>
   Her true love to enquire.</p>
 <p>And as she went along the high road,<br>
   The weather being hot and drye,<br>
 She sat her downe upon a green bank,<br>
   And her true love came riding bye.</p>
 <p>She started up, with a colour soe redd,<br>
   Catching hold of his bridle-reine;<br>
 "One penny, one penny, kind sir," she sayd,<br>
   "Will ease me of much paine."</p>
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>
 <p>"Before I give you one penny, sweet-heart,<br>
   Praye tell me where you were borne."<br>
 "At Islington, kind sir," sayd shee,<br>
   "Where I have had many a scorne."</p>
 <p>"I prythee, sweet-heart, then tell to mee,<br>
   O tell me, whether you knowe<br>
 The bayliffes daughter of Islington."<br>
   "She is dead, sir, long agoe."</p>
 <p>"If she be dead, then take my horse,<br>
   My saddle and bridle also;<br>
 For I will into some farr countrye,<br>
   Where noe man shall me knowe."</p>
 <p>"O staye, O staye, thou goodlye youthe,<br>
   She standeth by thy side;<br>
 She is here alive, she is not dead,<br>
   And readye to be thy bride."</p>
 <p>"O farewell griefe, and welcome joye,<br>
   Ten thousand times therefore;<br>
 For nowe I have founde mine owne true love,<br>
   Whom I thought I should never see more."</p>
