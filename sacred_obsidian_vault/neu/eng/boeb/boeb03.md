 <h1 align="CENTER">Chevy Chace</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>GOD prosper long our noble king,<br>
   Our liffes and safetyes all;<br>
 A woefull hunting once there did<br>
   In Chevy-Chace befall.</p>
 <p>To drive the deere with hound and horne,<br>
   Erle Percy took his way;<br>
 The child may rue that is unborne<br>
   The hunting of that day.</p>
 <p>The stout Erle of Northumberland<br>
   A vow to God did make,<br>
 His pleasure in the Scottish woods<br>
   Three summers days to take;</p>
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>
 <p>The cheefest harts in Chevy-Chace<br>
   To kill and beare away:<br>
 These tydings to Erle Douglas came,<br>
   In Scotland where he lay.</p>
 <p>Who sent Erie Percy present word,<br>
   He wold prevent his sport;<br>
 The English Erle not fearing that,<br>
   Did to the woods resort,</p>
 <p>With fifteen hundred bow-men bold,<br>
   All chosen men of might,<br>
 Who knew full well in time of neede<br>
   To ayme their shafts arright.</p>
 <p>The gallant greyhounds swiftly ran,<br>
   To chase the fallow deere;<br>
 On Munday they began to hunt,<br>
   Ere day-light did appeare;</p>
 <p>And long before high noone they had<br>
   An hundred fat buckes slaine;<br>
 Then having din'd, the drovyers went<br>
   To rouze the deare againe.</p>
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>
 <p>The bow-men mustered on the hills,<br>
   Well able to endure;<br>
 Theire backsides all, with speciall care,<br>
   That day were guarded sure.</p>
 <p>The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,<br>
   The nimble deere to take,<br>
 That with their cryes the hills and dales<br>
   An eccho shrill did make.</p>
 <p>Lord Percy to the quarry went,<br>
   To view the tender deere;<br>
 Quoth he, "Erle Douglas promised<br>
   This day to meet me heere;</p>
 <p>"But if I thought he wold not come,<br>
   Noe longer wold I stay."<br>
 With that, a brave younge gentleman<br>
   Thus to the Erle did say:</p>
 <p>"Loe, yonder doth Erle Douglas come,<br>
   His men in armour bright;<br>
 Full twenty hundred Scottish speres,<br>
   All marching in our sight.</p>
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>
 <p>"All men of pleasant Tivydale,<br>
   Fast by the river Tweede:"<br>
 "O cease your sport," Erle Percy said,<br>
   "And take your bowes with speede.</p>
 <p>"And now with me, my countrymen,<br>
   Your courage forth advance;<br>
 For never was there champion yett<br>
   In Scotland or in France,</p>
 <p>"That ever did on horsebacke come,<br>
   But, if my hap it were,<br>
 I durst encounter man for man,<br>
   With him to breake a spere."</p>
 <p>Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede,<br>
   Most like a baron bold,<br>
 Rode formost of his company,<br>
   Whose armour shone like gold.</p>
 <p>"Show me," sayd hee, "whose men you bee,<br>
   That hunt soe boldly heere,<br>
 That, without my consent, doe chase<br>
   And kill my fallow-deere."</p>
 <p> </p>

 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>
 <p>The man that first did answer make<br>
   Was noble Percy hee;<br>
 Who sayd, "Wee list not to declare,<br>
   Nor shew whose men wee bee.</p>
 <p>"Yet will wee spend our deerest blood,<br>
   Thy cheefest harts to slay;"<br>
 Then Douglas swore a solempne oathe,<br>
   And thus in rage did say;</p>
 <p>"Ere thus I will out-braved bee,<br>
   One of us two shall dye:<br>
 I know thee well, an erle thou art;<br>
   Lord Percy, soe am I.</p>
 <p>"But trust me, Percy, pittye it were,<br>
   And great offence, to kill<br>
 Any of these our guiltlesse men,<br>
   For they have done no ill.</p>
 <p>"Let thou and I the battell trye,<br>
   And set our men aside."<br>
 "Accurst bee he," Erle Percy sayd,<br>
   By whome this is denyed."</p>
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>
 <p>Then stept a gallant squier forth,<br>
   Witherington was his name,<br>
 Who said, "I wold not have it told<br>
   To Henry our king for shame,</p>
 <p>"That ere my captaine fought on foote,<br>
   And I stood looking on:<br>
 You bee two erles," sayd Witherington,<br>
   "And I a squier alone.</p>
 <p>"Ile doe the best that doe I may,<br>
   While I have power to stand;<br>
 While I have power to weeld my sword,<br>
   Ile fight with hart and hand."</p>
 <p>Our English archers bent their bowes,<br>
   Their harts were good and trew;<br>
 Att the first flight of arrowes sent,<br>
   Full four-score Scots they slew.</p>
 <p>[Yet bides Earl Douglas on the bent,<br>
   As Chieftain stout and good,<br>
 As valiant Captain, all unmov'd<br>
   The shock he firmly stood.</p>
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>
 <p>His host he parted had in three,<br>
   As Leader ware and try'd,<br>
 And soon his spearmen on their foes<br>
   Bare down on every side.</p>
 <p>Throughout the English archery<br>
   They dealt full many a wound;<br>
 But still our valiant Englishmen<br>
   All firmly kept their ground.</p>
 <p>And throwing strait their bows away,<br>
   They grasp'd their swords so bright:<br>
 And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,<br>
   On shields and helmets light.]</p>
 <p>They clos'd full fast on everye side,<br>
   Noe slacknes there was found;<br>
 And many a gallant gentleman<br>
   Lay gasping on the ground.</p>
 <p>O Christ! it was a griefe to see,<br>
   And likewise for to heare,<br>
 The cries of men lying in their gore,<br>
   And scattered here and there.</p>
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>
 <p>At last these two stout erles did meet,<br>
   Like captaines of great might;<br>
 Like lyons wood they layd on lode,<br>
   And made a cruell fight.</p>
 <p>They fought, untill they both did sweat,<br>
   With swords of tempered steele;<br>
 Until the blood, like drops of rain,<br>
   They trickling downe did feele.</p>
 <p>"Yeeld thee, Lord Percy," Douglas sayd<br>
   "In faith I will thee bringe,<br>
 Where thou shalt high advancèd bee<br>
   By James our Scottish king.</p>
 <p>"Thy ransom I will freely give,<br>
   And thus report of thee,<br>
 Thou art the most couragious knight<br>
   That ever I did see."</p>
 <p>"Noe, Douglas," quoth Erle Percy then,<br>
   "Thy proffer I doe scorne<br>
 I will not yeelde to any Scott,<br>
   That ever yett was borne."</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_03600"></a>

 <p> </p>
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>
 <p>With that, there came an arrow keene<br>
   Out of an English bow,<br>
 Which struck Erle Douglas to the heart,<br>
   A deepe and deadlye blow:</p>
 <p>Who never spake more words than these,<br>
   "Fight on, my merry men all;<br>
 For why, my life is at an end:<br>
   Lord Percy sees my fall."</p>
 <p>Then leaving liffe, Erle Percy tooke<br>
   The dead man by the hand;<br>
 And said, "Erle Douglas, for thy life<br>
   Wold I had lost my land!</p>
 <p>"O Christ! my verry hart doth bleed<br>
   With sorrow for thy sake;<br>
 For sure, a more renownèd knight<br>
   Mischance cold never take."</p>
 <p>A knight amongst the Scotts there was,<br>
   Which saw Erle Douglas dye,<br>
 Who streight in wrath did vow revenge<br>
   Upon the Lord Percye;</p>
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>
 <p>Sir Hugh Mountgomerye was he call'd,<br>
   Who, with a spere most bright,<br>
 Well-mounted on a gallant steed,<br>
   Ran fiercely through the fight;</p>
 <p>And past the English archers all,<br>
   Without all dread or feare,<br>
 And through Earl Percyes body then<br>
   He thrust his hatefull spere</p>
 <p>With such a vehement force and might<br>
   He did his body gore,<br>
 The speare ran through the other side<br>
   A large cloth-yard, and more.</p>
 <p>So thus did both these nobles dye,<br>
   Whose courage none could staine;<br>
 An English archer then perceiv'd<br>
   The noble erle was slaine.</p>
 <p>He had a bow bent in his hand,<br>
   Made of a trusty tree;<br>
 An arrow of a cloth-yard long<br>
   Up to the head drew hee.</p>
 <p> </p>

 <p> </p>
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>
 <p>Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,<br>
   So right the shaft he sett,<br>
 The grey goose-wing that was thereon<br>
   In his harts bloode was wett.</p>
 <p>This fight did last from breake of day<br>
   Till setting of the sun;<br>
 For when they rung the evening bell,<br>
   The battel scarce was done.</p>
 <p>With stout Erle Percy, there was slaine,<br>
   Sir John of Egerton,<br>
 Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,<br>
   Sir James, that bold Baròn.</p>
 <p>And with Sir George and stout Sir James,<br>
   Both knights of good account,<br>
 Good Sir Ralph Rabby there was slaine,<br>
   Whose prowesse did surmount.</p>
 <p>For Witherington needs must I wayle,<br>
   As one in doleful dumpes;<br>
 For when his legs were smitten off,<br>
   He fought upon his stumpes.</p>
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>
 <p>And with Erle Douglas, there was slaine<br>
   Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,<br>
 Sir Charles Murray, that from the feeld<br>
   One foote wold never flee.</p>
 <p>Sir Charles Murray of Ratcliff, too,<br>
   His sisters sonne was hee;<br>
 Sir David Lamb, so well esteem'd,<br>
   Yet savèd cold not bee.</p>
 <p>And the Lord Maxwell in like case<br>
   Did with Erle Douglas dye;<br>
 Of twenty hundred Scottish speres,<br>
   Scarce fifty-five did flye.</p>
 <p>Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,<br>
   Went home but fifty-three;<br>
 The rest were slaine in Chevy-Chace,<br>
   Under the greene wood tree.</p>
 <p>Next day did many widowes come,<br>
   Their husbands to bewayle;<br>
 They washt their wounds in brinish teares,<br>
   But all wold not prevayle.</p>
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>
 <p>Theyr bodyes, bathed in purple blood,<br>
   They bore with them away:<br>
 They kist them dead a thousand times,<br>
   Ere they were cladd in clay.</p>
 <p>This newes was brought to Eddenborrow,<br>
   Where Scotlands king did raigne,<br>
 That brave Erle Douglas suddenlye<br>
   Was with an arrow slaine.</p>
 <p>"O heavy newes," King James did say;<br>
   "Scottland can witnesse bee,<br>
 I have not any captaine more<br>
   Of such account as hee."</p>
 <p>Like tydings to King Henry came,<br>
   Within as short a space,<br>
 That Percy of Northumberland<br>
   Was slaine in Chevy-Chace.</p>
 <p>"Now God be with him," said our king,<br>
   "Sith it will noe better bee;<br>
 I trust I have, within my realme,<br>
   Five hundred as good as hee.</p>
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>
 <p>"Yett shall not Scotts nor Scotland say,<br>
   But I will vengeance take,<br>
 I'll be revengèd on them all,<br>
   For brave Erle Percyes sake."</p>
 <p>This vow full well the king perform'd<br>
   After, at Humbledowne;<br>
 In one day, fifty knights were slayne,<br>
   With lordes of great renowne.</p>
 <p>And of the rest, of small account,<br>
   Did many thousands dye:<br>
 Thus endeth the hunting in Chevy-Chace,<br>
   Made by the Erle Percy.</p>
 <p>God save our king, and bless this land<br>
   In plentye, joy, and peace;<br>
 And grant henceforth, that foule debate<br>
   'Twixt noblemen may cease!</p>
