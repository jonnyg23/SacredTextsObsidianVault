 <p align="CENTER">The Douglas Tragedy</p>
 <p>"RISE up, rise up, now, Lord Douglas," she says,<br>
   "And put on your armour so bright;<br>
 Sweet William will hae Lady Margaret awi'<br>
   Before that it be light.</p>
 <p>"Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,<br>
   And put on your armour so bright,<br>
 And take better care of your youngest sistèr,<br>
   For your eldest's awa' the last night."</p>
 <p>He's mounted her on a milk-white steed,<br>
   And himself on a dapple grey,<br>
 With a buglet horn hung down by his side<br>
   And lightly they rode away.</p>
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>
 <p>Lord William lookit o'er his left shouldèr,<br>
   To see what he could see,<br>
 And there he spied her seven brethren bold<br>
   Come riding o'er the lea.</p>
 <p>"Light down, light down, Lady Margaret," he said,<br>
   "And hold my steed in your hand,<br>
 Until that against your seven brethren bold,<br>
   And your father I make a stand."</p>
 <p>She held his steed in her milk-white hand,<br>
   And never shed one tear,<br>
 Until that she saw her seven brethren fa'<br>
   And her father hard fighting, who loved her so dear.</p>
 <p>"O hold your hand, Lord William!" she said,<br>
   "For your strokes they are wondrous sair;<br>
 True lovers I can get many a ane,<br>
   But a father I can never get mair."</p>
 <p>O, she's ta'en out her handkerchief,<br>
   It was o' the holland sae fine,<br>
 And aye she dighted her father's bloody wounds,<br>
   That were redder than the wine.</p>

 <p>"O chuse, O chuse, Lady Margaret," he said,<br>
   "O whether will ye gang or bide?"<br>
 "I'll gang, I'll gang, Lord William," she said,<br>
   "For you have left me nae other guide."</p>
 <p>He's lifted her on a milk-white steed,<br>
   And himself on a dapple grey,<br>
 With a buglet horn hung down by his side,<br>
   And slowly they baith rade away.</p>
 <p>O they rade on, and on they rade,<br>
   And a' by the light of the moon,<br>
 Until they came to yon wan water,<br>
   And there they lighted down.</p>
 <p>They lighted down to tak a drink<br>
   Of the spring that ran sae clear;<br>
 And down the stream ran his gude heart's blood,<br>
   And sair she 'gan to fear.</p>
 <p>"Hold up, hold up, Lord William," she says,<br>
   "For I fear that you are slain!"<br>
 "'Tis naething but the shadow of my scarlet cloak,<br>
   That shines in the water sae plain."</p>
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>
 <p>O they rade on, and on they rade,<br>
   And a' by the light of the moon,<br>
 Until they came to his mother's ha' door,<br>
   And there they lighted down.</p>
 <p>"Get up, get up, lady mother," he says,<br>
   "Get up, and let me in!<br>
 Get up, get up, lady mother," he says,<br>
   "For this night my fair lady I've win.</p>
 <p>"O mak my bed, lady mother," he says,<br>
   "O mak it braid and deep!<br>
 And lay Lady Margaret close at my back,<br>
   And the sounder I will sleep."</p>
 <p>Lord William was dead lang ere midnight,<br>
   Lady Margaret lang ere day:<br>
 And all true lovers that go thegither,<br>
   May they have mair luck than they!</p>
 <p>Lord William was buried in St. Marie's kirk,<br>
   Lady Margaret in Marie's quire;<br>
 Out o' the lady's grave grew a bonny red rose,<br>
   And out o' the knight's a brier.</p>
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>
 <p>And they twa met, and they twa plat<br>
   And fain they wad be near;<br>
 And a' the world might ken right weel,<br>
   They were twa lovers dear.</p>
 <p>But bye and rade the black Douglas<br>
   And wow but he was rough!<br>
 For he pulled up the bonny brièr,<br>
   And flanged in St. Marie's Loch.</p>
