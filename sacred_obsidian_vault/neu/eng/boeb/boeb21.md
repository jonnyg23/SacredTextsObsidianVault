 <h1 align="CENTER">The Nut-brown Maid</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>BE it right, or wrong, these men among<br>
   On women do complain;<br>
 Affirming this, how that it is<br>
   A labour spent in vain<br>
 To love them wele; for never a dele<br>
   They love a man again:<br>
 For let a man do what he can,<br>
   Their favour to attain,<br>
 Yet, if a new do them pursue,<br>
   Their first true lover then<br>
 Laboureth for nought; for from her thought<br>
   He is a banished man.</p>
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>
 <p>I say not nay, but that all day<br>
   It is both writ and said<br>
 That woman's faith is, as who saith,<br>
   All utterly decayed;<br>
 But, nevertheless, right good witnèss<br>
   In this case might be laid,<br>
 That they love true, and continùe,<br>
   Record the Nut-brown Maid:<br>
 Which, when her love came, her to prove,<br>
   To her to make his moan,<br>
 Would not depart; for in her heart<br>
   She loved but him alone.</p>
 <p>Then between us let us discuss<br>
   What was all the manere<br>
 Between them two: we will also<br>
   Tell all the pain, and fere,<br>
 That she was in. Now I begin,<br>
   So that ye me answère;<br>
 Wherefore, all ye, that present be<br>
   I pray you, give an ear.<br>
 I am the knight; I come by night,<br>
   As secret as I can; <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a><br>
 Saying,' Alas! thus standeth the case,<br>
   I am a banished man.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>And I your will for to fulfil<br>
   In this will not refuse;<br>
 Trusting to shew, in wordès few,<br>
   That men have an ill use<br>
 (To their own shame) women to blame,<br>
   And causeless them accuse:<br>
 Therefore to you I answer now,<br>
   All women to excuse,--<br>
 Mine own heart dear, with you what chere?<br>
   I pray you, tell anone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>It standeth so; a dede is do<br>
   Whereof great harm shall grow<br>
 My destiny is for to die<br>
   A shameful death, I trowe; <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a><br>
 Or else to flee: the one must be.<br>
   None other way I know,<br>
 But to withdraw as an outlaw,<br>
   And take me to my bow.<br>
 Wherefore, adieu, my own heart true!<br>
   None other rede I can:<br>
 For I must to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>O Lord, what is this worldys bliss,<br>
   That changeth as the moon!<br>
 My summer's day in lusty May<br>
   Is darked before the noon.<br>
 I hear you say, farewell: Nay, nay,<br>
   We dèpart not so soon.<br>
 Why say ye so? wheder will ye go?<br>
   Alas! what have ye done?<br>
 All my welfàre to sorrow and care<br>
   Should change, if ye were gone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>I can believe, it shall you grieve,<br>
   And somewhat you distrain;<br>
 But, afterward, your painès hard<br>
   Within a day or twain<br>
 Shall soon aslake; and ye shall take<br>
   Comfort to you again.<br>
 Why should ye ought? for, to make thought<br>
   Your labour were in vain.<br>
 And thus I do; and pray you to.,<br>
   As heartily as I can;<br>
 For I must to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>Now, sith that ye have shewed to me<br>
   The secret of your mind,<br>
 I shall be plain to you again,<br>
   Like as ye shall me find.<br>
 Sith it is so, that ye will go,<br>
   I wolle not leave behind;<br>
 Shall never be said, the Nut-brown Maid<br>
   Was to her love unkind: <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a><br>
 Make you readỳ, for so am I,<br>
   Although it were anone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>Yet I you rede to take good heed<br>
   What men will think and say:<br>
 Of young and old it shall be told.,<br>
   That ye be gone away,<br>
 Your wanton will for to fulfil,<br>
   In green wood you to play;<br>
 And that ye might from your delight<br>
   No longer make delay.<br>
 Rather than ye should thus for me<br>
   Be called an ill womàn,<br>
 Yet would I to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>Though it be sung of old and young,<br>
   That I should be to blame, <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a><br>
 Theirs be the charge, that speak so large<br>
   In hurting of my name:<br>
 For I will prove, that, faithful love<br>
   It is devoid of shame;<br>
 In your distress, and heaviness,<br>
   To part with you, the same:<br>
 And sure all tho, that do not so,<br>
   True lovers are they none;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>I counsel you, remember how,<br>
   It is no maiden's law,<br>
 Nothing to doubt, but to renne out<br>
   To wood with an outlàw:<br>
 For ye must there in your hand bear<br>
   A bow, readỳ to draw;<br>
 And, as a thief, thus must you live,<br>
   Ever in dread and awe;<br>
 Whereby to you great harm might grow:<br>
   Yet had I lever than, <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a><br>
 That I had to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>I think not nay, but as ye say,<br>
   It is no maiden's lore;<br>
 But love may make me for your sake,<br>
   As I have said before,<br>
 To come on foot, to hunt, and shoot<br>
   To get us meat in store;<br>
 For so that I your company<br>
   May have, I ask no more:<br>
 From which to part, it maketh my heart<br>
   As cold as any stone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>For an outlàw this is the law,<br>
   That men him take and bind;<br>
 Without pitỳ, hangèd to be,<br>
   And waver with the wind. <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a><br>
 If I had nede, (as God forbede!)<br>
   What rescue could ye find?<br>
 Forsooth, I trow, ye and your bow<br>
   For fear would draw behind:<br>
 And no mervayle: for little avail<br>
   Were in your counsel then:<br>
 Wherefore I will to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>Right well know ye, that women be<br>
   But feeble for to fight;<br>
 No womanhede it is indeed<br>
   To be bold as a knight:<br>
 Yet, in such fear if that ye were<br>
   With enemies day or night,<br>
 I would withstand, with bow in hand,<br>
   To greve them as I might,<br>
 And you to save; as women have<br>
   From death men many a one:<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>Yet take good hede; for ever I drede<br>
   That ye could not sustain<br>
 The thorny ways, the deep vallèys,<br>
   The snow, the frost, the rain,<br>
 The cold, the heat: for dry, or wet,<br>
   We must lodge on the plain;<br>
 And, us above, none other roof<br>
   But a brake bush, or twain;<br>
 Which soon should grieve you, I believe,<br>
   And ye would gladly then<br>
 That I had to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>Sith I have here been partynère<br>
   With you of joy and bliss,<br>
 I must alsò part of your woe<br>
   Endure, as reason is:<br>
 Yet am I sure of one pleasùre;<br>
   And, shortly, it is this:<br>
 That, where ye be, me seemeth, pardè,<br>
   I could not fare amiss. <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a><br>
 Without more speech, I you beseech<br>
   That we were soon agone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>If ye go thyder, ye must consider,<br>
   When ye have lust to dine,<br>
 There shall no meat be for you gete,<br>
   Nor drink, beer, ale, nor wine.<br>
 No shetès clean, to lie between,<br>
   Made of thread and twine;<br>
 None other house, but leaves and boughs,<br>
   To cover your head and mine;<br>
 O mine heart sweet, this evil diète<br>
   Should make you pale and wan;<br>
 Wherefore I will to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>Among the wild dere, such an archère,<br>
   As men say that ye be, <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a><br>
 Ne may not fail of good vitàyle,<br>
   Where is so great plentỳ:<br>
 And water clear of the ryvére<br>
   Shall be full sweet to me;<br>
 With which in hele I shall right wele<br>
   Endure, as ye shall see;<br>
 And, or we go, a bed or two<br>
   I can provide anone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>Lo! yet, before, ye must do more,<br>
   If ye will go with me:<br>
 As cut your hair up by your ear,<br>
   Your kirtle by the knee;<br>
 With bow in hand, for to withstand<br>
   Your enemies, if need be:<br>
 And this same night before day-light,<br>
   To wood-ward will I flee.<br>
 If that ye will all this fulfil,<br>
   Do it shortly as ye can <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a><br>
 Else will I to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>I shall as now do more for you<br>
   Than 'longeth to womanhede;<br>
 To shorte my hair, a bow to bear,<br>
   To shoot in time of need.<br>
 O my sweet mother, before all other<br>
   For you I have most drede:<br>
 But now, adieu! I must ensue,<br>
   Where fortune doth me lead.<br>
 All this make ye: Now let us flee;<br>
   The day cometh fast upon;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>Nay, nay, not so; ye shall not go,<br>
   And I shall tell ye why,--<br>
 Your appetite is to be light<br>
   Of love, I wele espy: <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a><br>
 For, like as ye have said to me,<br>
   In like wise hardely<br>
 Ye would answère whosoever it were<br>
   In way of companỳ.<br>
 It is said of old, Soon hot, soon cold<br>
   And so is a womàn.<br>
 Wherefore I to the wood will go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>If ye take heed, it is no need<br>
   Such words to say by me;<br>
 For oft ye prayed, and long assayed,<br>
   Or I you loved, pardè:<br>
 And though that I of ancestry<br>
   A baron's daughter be,<br>
 Yet have you proved how I you loved<br>
   A squire of low degree;<br>
 And ever shall, whatso befall;<br>
   To die therefore anone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>A baron's child to be beguiled!<br>
   It were a cursèd dede;<br>
 To be felàwe with an outlàwe!<br>
   Almighty God forbede!<br>
 Yet better were, the poor squyère<br>
   Alone to forest yede,<br>
 Than ye should say another day,<br>
   That, by my cursèd dede,<br>
 Ye were betrayed: Wherefore, good maid,<br>
   The best rede that I can,<br>
 Is, that I to the green wood go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>Whatever befall, I never shall<br>
   Of this thing you upbraid:<br>
 But if ye go, and leave me so,<br>
   Then have ye me betrayed.<br>
 Remember you wele, how that ye dele;<br>
   For, if ye, as ye said,<br>
 Be so unkind, to leave behind,<br>
   Your love, the Nut-brown Maid, <a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a><br>
 Trust me trulỳ, that I shall die<br>
   Soon after ye be gone;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>If that ye went, ye should repent;<br>
   For in the forest now<br>
 I have purvayed me of a maid,<br>
   Whom I love more than you;<br>
 Another fayrère, than ever ye were,<br>
   I dare it wele avow;<br>
 And of you both each should be wroth<br>
   With other, as I trow:<br>
 It were mine ease, to live in peace;<br>
   So will I, if I can;<br>
 Wherefore I to the wood will go,<br>
   Alone, a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>Though in the wood I understood<br>
   Ye had a paramour, <a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a><br>
 All this may nought remove my thought,<br>
   But that I will be your:<br>
 And she shall find me soft and kind,<br>
   And courteys every hour;<br>
 Glad to fulfil all that she will<br>
   Command me to my power:<br>
 For had ye, lo! an hundred mo,<br>
   Of them I would be one;<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>Mine own dear love, I see the proof<br>
   That ye be kind and true;<br>
 Of maid, and wife, in all my life,<br>
   The best that ever I knew.<br>
 Be merry and glad, be no more sad,<br>
   The case is changèd new;<br>
 For it were ruth, that, for your truth,<br>
   Ye should have cause to rue.<br>
 Be not dismayed, whatsoever I said<br>
   To you, when I began; <a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a><br>
 I will not to the green wood go,<br>
   I am no banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SHE</p>
 <p>These tidings be more glad to me,<br>
   Than to be made a queen,<br>
 If I were sure they should endure:<br>
   But it is often seen,<br>
 When men will break promise, they speak<br>
   The wordès on the splene.<br>
 Ye shape some wile me to beguile,<br>
   And steal from me, I ween:<br>
 Then, were the case worse than it was,<br>
   And I more wo-begone:<br>
 For, in my mind, of all mankind<br>
   I love but you alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">HE</p>
 <p>Ye shall not nede further to drede;<br>
   I will not disparàge<br>
 You, (God defend!) sith ye descend<br>
   Of so great a lineàge. <a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a><br>
 Now understand; to Westmoreland,<br>
   Which is mine heritage,<br>
 I will you bring; and with a ring,<br>
   By way of marriàge<br>
 I will you take, and lady make,<br>
   As shortly as I can:<br>
 Thus have you won an erly's son,<br>
   And not a banished man.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">AUTHOR</p>
 <p>Here may ye see, that women be<br>
   In love, meek, kind, and stable;<br>
 Let never man reprove them then,<br>
   Or call them variàble;<br>
 But, rather, pray God that we may<br>
   To them be comfortàble;<br>
 Which sometime proveth such, as he loveth,<br>
   If they be charitàble.<br>
 For sith men would that women should<br>
   Be meek to them each one;<br>
 Much more ought they to God obey,<br>
   And serve but Him alone.</p>
