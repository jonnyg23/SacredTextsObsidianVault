 <h1 align="CENTER">The Lament of the Border Widow</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>MY love he built me a bonny bower,<br>
 And clad it a' wi' a lilye flower,<br>
 A brawer bower ye ne'er did see,<br>
 Than my true love he built for me.</p>
 <p>There came a man, by middle day,<br>
 He spied his sport and went away,<br>
 And brought the king that very night,<br>
 Who brake my bower, and slew my knight.</p>
 <p>He slew my knight, to me so dear;<br>
 He slew my knight, and poined his gear;<br>
 My servants all for life did flee,<br>
 And left me in extremitie.</p>
 <p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 170</font></a></p>
 <p>I sewed his sheet, making my mane;<br>
 I watched the corpse, myself alane;<br>
 I watched his body, night and day;<br>
 No living creature came that way.</p>
 <p>I took his body on my back,<br>
 And whiles I gaed, and whiles I sat,<br>
 I digged a grave, and laid him in,<br>
 And happed him with the sod so green.</p>
 <p>But think na ye my heart was sair,<br>
 When I laid the moul' on his yellow hair;<br>
 Think na ye my heart was wae,<br>
 When I turned about, away to gae?</p>
 <p>Nae living man I'll love again,<br>
 Since that my lovely knight is slain;<br>
 W? ae lock of his yellow hair<br>
 I'll chain my heart for evermair.</p>
