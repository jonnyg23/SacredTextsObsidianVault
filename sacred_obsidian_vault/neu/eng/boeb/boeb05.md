 <h1 align="CENTER">King Leir and his Three Daughters</h1>
 <p>KING LEIR once rulèd in this land<br>
   With princely power and peace,<br>
 And had all things with hearts content,<br>
   That might his joys increase.<br>
 Amongst those things that nature gave,<br>
   Three daughters fair had he,<br>
 So princely seeming beautiful,<br>
   As fairer could not be.</p>
 <p>So on a time it pleas'd the king<br>
   A question thus to move,<br>
 Which of his daughters to his grace<br>
   Could shew the dearest love: <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a><br>
 "For to my age you bring content,"<br>
   Quoth he, "then let me hear,<br>
 Which of you three in plighted troth<br>
   The kindest will appear."</p>
 <p>To whom the eldest thus began:<br>
   "Dear father, mind," quoth she,<br>
 "Before your face, to do you good,<br>
   My blood shall render'd be.<br>
 And for your sake my bleeding heart<br>
   Shall here be cut in twain,<br>
 Ere that I see your reverend age<br>
   The smallest grief sustain."</p>
 <p>"And so will I," the second said;<br>
   "Dear father, for your sake,<br>
 The worst of all extremities<br>
   I'll gently undertake:<br>
 And serve your highness night and day<br>
   With diligence and love;<br>
 That sweet content and quietness<br>
   Discomforts may remove."</p>
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>
 <p>"In doing so, you glad my soul,"<br>
   The aged king reply'd;<br>
 But what sayst thou, my youngest girl,<br>
   How is thy love ally'd?"<br>
 "My love" (quoth young Cordelia then),<br>
   "Which to your grace I owe,<br>
 Shall be the duty of a child,<br>
   And that is all I'll show."</p>
 <p>"And wilt thou shew no more," quoth he,<br>
   "Than doth thy duty bind?<br>
 I well perceive thy love is small,<br>
   When as no more I find.<br>
 Henceforth I banish thee my court;<br>
   Thou art no child of mine;<br>
 Nor any part of this my realm<br>
   By favour shall be thine.</p>
 <p>"Thy elder sisters' loves are more<br>
   Than well I can demand;<br>
 To whom I equally bestow<br>
   My kingdome and my land, <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a><br>
 My pompal state and all my goods,<br>
   That lovingly I may<br>
 With those thy sisters be maintain'd<br>
   Until my dying day."</p>
 <p>Thus flattering speeches won renown,<br>
   By these two sisters here;<br>
 The third had causeless banishment,<br>
   Yet was her love more dear.<br>
 For poor Cordelia patiently<br>
   Went wandring up and down,<br>
 Unhelp'd, unpity'd, gentle maid,<br>
   Through many an English town:</p>
 <p>Untill at last in famous France<br>
   She gentler fortunes found;<br>
 Though poor and bare, yet she was deem'd<br>
   The fairest on the ground:<br>
 Where when the king her virtues heard,<br>
   And this fair lady seen,<br>
 With full consent of all his court<br>
   He made his wife and queen.</p>
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>
 <p>Her father, old King Leir, this while<br>
   With his two daughters staid;<br>
 Forgetful of their promis'd loves,<br>
   Full soon the same decay'd;<br>
 And living in Queen Ragan's court,<br>
   The eldest of the twain,<br>
 She took from him his chiefest means,<br>
   And most of all his train.</p>
 <p>For whereas twenty men were wont<br>
   To wait with bended knee,<br>
 She gave allowance but to ten,<br>
   And after scarce to three,<br>
 Nay, one she thought too much for him;<br>
   So took she all away,<br>
 In hope that in her court, good king,<br>
   He would no longer stay.</p>
 <p>"Am I rewarded thus," quoth he,<br>
 "  In giving all I have<br>
 Unto my children, and to beg<br>
   For what I lately gave? <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a><br>
 I'll go unto my Gonorell:<br>
   My second child, I know,<br>
 Will be more kind and pitiful,<br>
   And will relieve my woe."</p>
 <p>Full fast he hies then to her court;<br>
   Where when she heard his moan,<br>
 Return'd him answer, that she griev'd<br>
   That all his means were gone,<br>
 But no way could relieve his wants;<br>
   Yet if that he would stay<br>
 Within her kitchen, he should have<br>
   What scullions gave away.</p>
 <p>When he had heard, with bitter tears,<br>
   He made his answer then;<br>
 In what I did, let me be made<br>
   Example to all men.<br>
 I will return again," quoth he,<br>
   "Unto my Ragan's court;<br>
 She will not use me thus, I hope,<br>
   But in a kinder sort."</p>
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>
 <p>Where when he came, she gave command<br>
   To drive him thence away:<br>
 When he was well within her court,<br>
   (She said) he would not stay.<br>
 Then back again to Gonorel<br>
   The woeful king did hie,<br>
 That in her kitchen he might have<br>
   What scullion boys set by.</p>
 <p>But there of that he was deny'd<br>
   Which she had promis'd late<br>
 For once refusing, he should not,<br>
   Come after to her gate.<br>
 Thus twixt his daughters for relief<br>
   He wandred up and down,<br>
 Being glad to feed on beggars' food<br>
   That lately wore a crown.</p>
 <p>And calling to remembrance then<br>
   His youngest daughters words,<br>
 That said, the duty of a child<br>
   Was all that love affords--<a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a><br>
 But doubting to repair to her,<br>
   Whom he had ban'sh'd so,<br>
 Grew frantic mad; for in his mind<br>
   He bore the wounds of woe.</p>
 <p>Which made him rend his milk-white locks<br>
   And tresses from his head,<br>
 And all with blood bestain his cheeks,<br>
   With age and honour spread.<br>
 To hills and woods and watry founts,<br>
   He made his hourly moan,<br>
 Till hills and woods and senseless things<br>
   Did seem to sigh and groan.</p>
 <p>Even thus possest with discontents,<br>
   He passed o'er to France,<br>
 In hopes from fair Cordelia there<br>
   To find some gentler chance.<br>
 Most virtuous dame! which, when she heard<br>
   Of this her father's grief,<br>
 As duty bound, she quickly sent<br>
   Him comfort and relief.</p>

 <p>And by a train of noble peers,<br>
   In brave and gallant sort,<br>
 She gave in charge he should be brought<br>
   To Aganippus' court;<br>
 Whose royal king, with noble mind,<br>
   So freely gave consent<br>
 To muster up his knights at arms,<br>
   To fame and courage bent.</p>
 <p>And so to England came with speed,<br>
   To repossesse King Leir,<br>
 And drive his daughters from their thrones<br>
   By his Cordelia dear.<br>
 Where she, true-hearted, noble queen,<br>
   Was in the battel stain;<br>
 Yet he, good king, in his old days,<br>
   Possest his crown again.</p>
 <p>But when he heard Cordelia's death,<br>
   Who died indeed for love<br>
 Of her dear father, in whose cause<br>
   She did this battle move, <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a><br>
 He swooning fell upon her breast,<br>
   From whence he never parted;<br>
 But on her bosom left his life<br>
   That was so truly hearted.</p>
 <p>The lords and nobles, when they saw<br>
   The end of these events,<br>
 The other sisters unto death<br>
   They doomèd by consents;<br>
 And being dead, their crowns they left<br>
   Unto the next of kin:<br>
 Thus have you seen the fall of pride,<br>
   And disobedient sin.</p>
