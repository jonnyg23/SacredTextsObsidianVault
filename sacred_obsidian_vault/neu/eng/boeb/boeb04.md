 <h1 align="CENTER">King Cophetua and the Beggar-Maid</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>I READ that once in Affrica<br>
   A princely wight did raine,<br>
 Who had to name Cophetua,<br>
   As poets they did faine.<br>
 From natures lawes he did decline,<br>
 For sure he was not of my minde,<br>
 He cared not for women-kind<br>
   But did them all disdaine.<br>
 But marke what hapned on a day;<br>
 As he out of his window lay,<br>
 He saw a beggar all in gray.<br>
   The which did cause his paine.</p>
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a></p>
 <p>The blinded boy that shootes so trim<br>
   From heaven downe did hie,<br>
 He drew a dart and shot at him,<br>
   In place where he did lye:<br>
 Which soone did pierse him to the quicke,<br>
 And when he felt the arrow pricke,<br>
 Which in his tender heart did sticke,<br>
   He looketh as he would dye.<br>
 What sudden chance is this," quoth he,<br>
 "That I to love must subject be,<br>
 Which never thereto would agree,<br>
   But still did it defie?"</p>
 <p>Then from the window he did come,<br>
   And laid him on his bed;<br>
 A thousand heapes of care did runne<br>
   Within his troubled head.<br>
 For now he meanes to crave her love,<br>
 And now he seekes which way to proove<br>
 How he his fancie might remoove,<br>
   And not this beggar wed.<br>
 But Cupid had him so in snare,<br>
 That this poor begger must prepare <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a><br>
 A salve to cure him of his care,<br>
   Or els he would be dead.</p>
 <p>And as he musing thus did lye,<br>
   He thought for to devise<br>
 How he might have her companye,<br>
   That so did 'maze his eyes.<br>
 "In thee," quoth he, "doth rest my life;<br>
 For surely thou shalt be my wife,<br>
 Or else this hand with bloody knife,<br>
   The Gods shall sure suffice."<br>
 Then from his bed he soon arose,<br>
 And to his pallace gate he goes;<br>
 Full little then this begger knowes<br>
   When she the king espies.</p>
 <p>"The gods preserve your majesty,"<br>
   The beggers all gan cry;<br>
 "Vouchsafe to give your charity,<br>
   Our childrens food to buy."<br>
 The king to them his purse did cast,<br>
 And they to part it made great haste;</p>
 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a></p>
 <p>This silly woman was the last<br>
   That after them did hye.<br>
 The king he cal'd her back againe,<br>
 And unto her he gave his chaine;<br>
 And said, "With us you shal remaine<br>
   Till such time as we dye.</p>
 <p>"For thou," quoth he, "shalt be my wife,<br>
   And honoured for my queene;<br>
 With thee I meane to lead my life,<br>
   As shortly shall be seene:<br>
 Our wedding shall appointed be,<br>
 And every thing in its degree;<br>
 "Come on," quoth he, "and follow me,<br>
   Thou shalt go shift thee cleane.<br>
 What is thy name, faire maid?" quoth he.<br>
 "Penelophon, O King," quoth she;<br>
 With that she made a lowe courtsèy;<br>
   A trim one as I weene.</p>
 <p>Thus hand in hand along they walke<br>
   Unto the king's pallàce:<br>
 The king with courteous, comly talke<br>
   This begger doth embrace.</p>
 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a></p>
 <p>The begger blusheth scarlet red,<br>
 And straight againe as pale as lead,<br>
 But not a word at all she said,<br>
   She was in such amaze.<br>
 At last she spake with trembling voyce,<br>
 And said, "O King, I doe rejoyce<br>
 That you wil take me for your choyce,<br>
   And my degree so base."</p>
 <p>And when the wedding day was come,<br>
   The king commanded strait<br>
 The noblemen, both all and some,<br>
   Upon the queene to wait.<br>
 And she behaved herself that day<br>
 As if she had never walkt the way;<br>
 She had forgot her gowne of gray,<br>
   Which she did weare of late.<br>
 The proverbe old is come to passe,<br>
 The priest, when he begins his masse,<br>
 Forgets that ever clerke he was<br>
   He knowth not his estate.</p>
 <p>Here you may read Cophetua,<br>
   Through long time fancie-fed, <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a><br>
 Compelled by the blinded boy<br>
   The begger for to wed:<br>
 He that did lovers lookes disdaine,<br>
 To do the same was glad and faine,<br>
 Or else he would himselfe have slaine,<br>
   In storie, as we read.<br>
 Disdaine no whit, O lady deere,<br>
 But pitty now thy servant heere,<br>
 Least that it hap to thee this yeare,<br>
   As to that king it did.</p>
 <p>And thus they led a quiet life<br>
   During their princely raine,<br>
 And in a tombe were buried both,<br>
   As writers sheweth plaine.<br>
 The lords they tooke it grievously,<br>
 The ladies tooke it heavily,<br>
 The commons cryed pitiously,<br>
   Their death to them was paine.<br>
 Their fame did sound so passingly,<br>
 That it did pierce the starry sky,<br>
 And throughout all the world did flye<br>
   To every princes realme.</p>
