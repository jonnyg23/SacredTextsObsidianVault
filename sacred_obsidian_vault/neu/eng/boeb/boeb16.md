 <h1 align="CENTER">Robin Hood and Allen-a-Dale</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>COME listen to me, you gallants so free,<br>
   All you that love mirth for to hear,<br>
 And I will tell you of a bold outlàw,<br>
   That lived in Nottinghamshire.</p>
 <p>As Robin Hood in the forest stood<br>
   All under the greenwood tree,<br>
 There he was aware of a brave young man,<br>
   As fine as fine might be.</p>
 <p>The youngster was clad in scarlet red,<br>
   In scarlet fine and gay<br>
 And he did frisk it over the plain,<br>
   And chaunted a roundelay.</p>
 <p> </p>

 <p>As Robin Hood next morning stood<br>
   Amongst the leaves so gay,<br>
 There did he espy the same young man<br>
   Come drooping along the way.</p>
 <p>The scarlet he wore the day before<br>
   It was clean cast away;<br>
 And at every step he fetched a sigh,<br>
   "Alas! and a well-a-day!"</p>
 <p>Then steppèd forth brave Little John,<br>
   And Midge, the miller's son;<br>
 Which made the young man bend his bow,<br>
   When as he see them come.</p>
 <p>"Stand off! stand off!" the young man said,<br>
   "What is your will with me?"<br>
 "You must come before our master straight,<br>
   Under yon greenwood tree."</p>
 <p>And when he came bold Robin before,<br>
   Robin asked him courteously,<br>
 O, hast thou any money to spare,<br>
   For my merry men and me?</p>
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a></p>
 <p>"I have no money," the young man said,<br>
   "But five shillings and a ring;<br>
 And that I have kept this seven long years,<br>
   To have at my wedding.</p>
 <p>"Yesterday I should have married a maid,<br>
   But she was from me ta'en,<br>
 And chosen to be an old knight's delight,<br>
   Whereby my poor heart is slain."</p>
 <p>"What is thy name?" then said Robin Hood,<br>
   "Come tell me, without any fail."<br>
 "By the faith of my body," then said the young man,<br>
   "My name it is Allen-a-Dale."</p>
 <p>"What wilt thou give me," said Robin Hood,<br>
   "In ready gold or fee,<br>
 To help thee to thy true love again,<br>
   And deliver her unto thee?"</p>
 <p>"I have no money," then quoth the young man,<br>
   "No ready gold nor fee,<br>
 But I will swear upon a book<br>
   Thy true servant for to be."</p>
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>
 <p>"How many miles is it to thy true love?<br>
   Come tell me without guile."<br>
 "By the faith of my body," then said the young man,<br>
   "It is but five little mile."</p>
 <p>Then Robin he hasted over the plain,<br>
   He did neither stint nor lin,<br>
 Until he came unto the church<br>
   Where Allen should keep his weddin'.</p>
 <p>"What hast thou here?" the bishop then said,<br>
   "I prithee now tell unto me."<br>
 "I am a bold harper," quoth Robin Hood,<br>
   "And the best in the north countrỳ."</p>
 <p>"O welcome, O welcome," the bishop he said,<br>
   "That music best pleaseth me."<br>
 "You shall have no music," quoth Robin Hood,<br>
   "Till the bride and bridegroom I see."</p>
 <p>With that came in a wealthy knight,<br>
   Which was both grave and old;<br>
 And after him a finikin lass,<br>
   Did shine like the glistering gold.</p>
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>
 <p>"This is not a fit match," quoth Robin Hood,<br>
   "That you do seem to make here;<br>
 For since we are come into the church,<br>
   The bride shall chuse her own dear."</p>
 <p>Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth,<br>
   And blew blasts two and three;<br>
 When four-and-twenty bowmen bold<br>
   Came leaping over the lea.</p>
 <p>And when they came into the church-yard,<br>
   Marching all in a row,<br>
 The first man was Allen-a-Dale,<br>
   To give bold Robin his bow.</p>
 <p>"This is thy true love," Robin he said,<br>
   Young Allen, as I hear say;<br>
 And you shall be married this same time,<br>
   Before we depart away."</p>
 <p>"That shall not be," the bishop he cried,<br>
   "For thy word shall not stand;<br>
 They shall be three times asked in the church,<br>
   As the law is of our land."</p>
 <p> </p>

 <p>Robin Hood pulled off the bishop's coat,<br>
   And put it upon Little John;<br>
 "By the faith of my body," then Robin said,<br>
   "This cloth doth make thee a man."</p>
 <p>When Little John went into the quire,<br>
   The people began to laugh;<br>
 He asked them seven times into church,<br>
   Lest three times should not be enough.</p>
 <p>"Who gives me this maid?" said Little John,<br>
   Quoth Robin Hood, "That do I;<br>
 And he that takes her from Allen-a-Dale,<br>
   Full dearly he shall her buy."</p>
 <p>And then having ended this merry wedding,<br>
   The bride looked like a queen;<br>
 And so they returned to the merry greenwood,<br>
   Amongst the leaves so green.</p>
