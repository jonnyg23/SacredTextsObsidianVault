 <p align="CENTER">CORNISH DIALOGUE</p>
 <p>AS the Cornish dialogue peculiarly illustrates a
 description of literary composition which has no resemblance to that of
 any county, I think it advisable to give one specimen :-- </p>
 <u>
 </u><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN MAL TRELOARE AND SAUNDRY KEMP.</p>
 <b>
 <ul>
 </ul></b>
 <p>'Twas
 Kendle teening, when jung Mal Treloare</p>
 <p>Trudg'd
 hum from Bal, a bucken copper ore;</p>
 <p>Her
 clathing hard and ruff, black was her eye,</p>
 <p>Her face
 and arms like stuff from Cairn Kye.</p>
 <p>Full
 butt she mit jung Saundry Kemp, who long</p>
 <p>She had
 been token'd to, come from Ding Dong;</p>
 <p>Hes
 jacket wet, his faace rud like his beard,</p>
 <p>And
 through his squarded hat hes hair appeared.</p>
 <p>She
 said, "Oh, Kemp, I thoft of thee well leer,</p>
 <p>Thees
 naw that daay we wor to Bougheehere,</p>
 <p>That
 daay with ale and cakes, at three o'clock,</p>
 <p>Thees
 stuff'd me so, I jist neen crack'd me dock:</p>
 <p>Jue said
 to me, 'Thee mayst depend thee life,</p>
 <p>I love
 thee, Mal, and thee shust be ma wife.'</p>
 <p>And to
 ma semmen, tes good to lem ma naw</p>
 <p>Whether
 the words were as! in jest or no.</p>
 <p>" <i>
 Saundry. </i>Why, truly, Mal, I like a thing did zay,</p>
 <p>That I
 wud have thee next Chewiden daay.</p>
 <p>But
 zence that time I bike a think ded hear</p>
 <p>Thees

 <p>Now es

 <i>
 </i><p>Mal. 
 Od rot tha body, Saundry, who said so?</p>
 <p>Now,
 faath and traath, I 'II naw afore I go;</p>
 <p>Do lem
 me naw the Gossenbary dog.</p>
 <i>
 </i><p>Saundry.
 Why, then, Crull said jue wor down to Wheal Bog</p>
 <p>With he
 and Tabban, and ded make some tricks</p>
 <p>By
 dabben clay at jungsters making bricks;</p>
 <p>Aand
 that from there jue went to Aafe-waye house,</p>
 <p>Aand
 drink't some leeker. Mal, now there's down souse.</p>
 <p>Aand jue
 to he, like a thing ded zay,</p>
 <p>Jue wed
 have he, and I mait go away.</p>
 <i>
 </i><p>Mat. 
 I tell the lubber so! Ito Wheal Bog!</p>
 <p>I'll
 scatt his chacks. the emprent, saucy dog.</p>
 <p>'Now
 hire me, Saundry Kemp, now down and full,</p>
 <p>Ef thee
 arten hastes, thee shust hire the whole.</p>
 <p>Fust jue
 must naw, tes true as thee art there,</p>
 <p>Aant
 Blanch and I went to Golsinny feer.</p>
 <p>Who 
 overtookt us in the doosty road,</p>
 <p>In
 common hum but Crull, the cloppen toad.</p>
 <p>Zes he
 to Aant, "What cheer? Aant Blanch, what cheer?</p>
 <p>Jue
 makes good coose, suppose jue been to feer."</p>
 <p>"Why,
 hiss," zes Aant, "ben there a pewer spur.</p>
 <p>I wedn
 't<b> </b>a gone ef nawed ed been so fur.</p>
 <b>
 </b><p>I 
 bawft a pair of<b> </b>shods for Sarah's cheeld."</p>
 <p>By this
 time, lock! we cum jist to the field</p>
 <p>We went
 to clemmer up the temberen style.</p>
 
 <p>(Haw
 kept his eye upon me all the while.)</p>
 <p>Zes hem
 to Aant, "Then whos es thees braa maide?</p>
 <p>Come tha
 wayst long, dasent be afraid."</p>
 <p>Then 
 mov'd my side, like a thing,</p>
 <p>Aand
 pull'd my mantle, and just touch'd my ching,</p>
 <p>"How
 arry,jung woman?" zeshaw. "Howdost do?"</p>
 <p>Zes I, "Jue
 saucy dog, what's that to jue?</p>
 <p>Keep off<i>,
 </i>jung lad, else thees have a slap."</p>
 <p>Then haw
 fooch'd some great big doat figs in me lap.</p>
 <p>So I
 thoft, as haw had been so kind,</p>
 <p>Haw
 might go by Aant Blanch, ef haw had a mind.</p>
 <p>Aand so
 haw ded, sand tookt Aant Blanch's arm.</p>
 <p>"Araeh!"
 zes haw, "I dedn't mane no harm."</p>
 <p>So then
 Aant Blanch and he ded talk and jest</p>
 <p>Bout
 dabbing clay and bricks at Petran feast. </p>
 <i>
 </i><p>Saundry.
 Ahab then, Ma!, 'twas there they dabbed the clay </p>
 <i>
 </i><p>Mal. 
 Plaase Father, Kemp, tes true wot I do saay.</p>
 <p>And hire
 me now, pla-sure, haw dedent budge</p>
 <p>From
 Aanty's arm till jest this side Long Brudge</p>
 <p>Aand
 then zes he to Aant, "Shall we go in</p>
 <p>To
 Aafe-waye house, and have a dram of gin</p>
 <p>And
 trickle mixt? Depend ol do es good,</p>
 <p>Taake up
 the sweat, and set to rights the blud."</p>
 <p>So Aant
 did saay, "Such things she dedn 't<b> </b>chuse,"</p>
 <p>And
 squeezed my hand, aand bike a thing refuse.</p>
 <p>So when
 we pass'd along by Wheal Bog moor,</p>
 <p>Haw
 jumpt behind, and pok <b>'</b>t<b> </b>es in the door.</p>
 <p>Haw caal
 'd for gin, aand brandy too, I think.</p>
 <p>He clunk 'd the
 brandy, we the gin did drink.</p>
 <p>So when
 haw wish'd good night, as es the caase,</p>
 <p>Haw kiss
 <b>'</b>t<b> </b>Aant Blanch, and jist neen touched my face.</p>
 <p>Now,
 Saundry Kemp, there's nothing sure in this,</p>
 <p>To my
 moinde, then, that thee shust take amiss. </p>
 <i>
 </i><p>Saundry.
 No, fath, then Ma!, ef this is all aand true,</p>
 <p>I had a
 done the same ef I was jue.</p>
 <i>
 </i><p>Mal. 
 Next time in any house I see or near am, </p>
 <p>I'll

 <p>Aand I

 <i>
 </i><p>Saundry.

 <i>
 </i><p>Kappen.

 <i>
 </i><p>She
 wiped her muzzle from the mundic stuf</p>
 <p>And he
 rub/id his, a little stain'd with snuff</p>
 
 <p>Now
