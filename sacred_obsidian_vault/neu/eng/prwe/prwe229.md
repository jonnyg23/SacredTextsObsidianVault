 <p align="CENTER">ALLHALLOWS-EVE AT ST IVES.</p>
 <p>THE ancient custom of providing children with a large apple
 on Allhallows-eve is still observed, to a great extent, at St Ives.
 "Allan-day," as it is called, is the day of days to hundreds' of children,
 who would deem it a great misfortune were they to go to bed on "Allan-night"
 without the time-honoured Allan apple to hide beneath their pillows. A
 quantity of large apples are thus disposed of the sale of which is dignified
 by the term Allan Market.</p>
