 <p align="CENTER">GEESE DANCING--GUISE DANCING--
 GUIZARDS</p>
 <p>"THE doings of the guizards--that is, masquers--form a
 conspicuous feature in the New Year's proceedings throughout Scotland. The
 evenings on which these personages are understood to be privileged to appear
 are those of Christmas, Hogmanay, New Year's day, and Handsel Monday. Such
 boys as can pretend to anything like a voice have, for weeks before, been
 thumbing the collection of excellent new songs which lies hike a bunch of
 rags in the window-sole; and being now able to screech up 'Barbara Allan,'
 or the 'Wee cot-house and the wee kail-yardie,' they determine upon enacting
 the part of guizards. For this purpose they don old shirts belonging to
 their fathers, and mount casques of brown paper, shaped so like a mitre,
 that I am tempted to believe them to be borrowed from the Abbot of Unreason;
 attached to this is a sheet of the same paper, which, falling down in front,
 covers and conceals the whole face, except where holes are made to let
 through the point of the nose, and afford sight to the eyes and breath to
 the mouth. Each vocal guizard is, like a knight of old, attended by a kind
 of humble squire, who assumes the habiliments of a girl, with an old woman's
 cap and a broomstick, and is styled 'Bessie.' Bessie is equal in no
 respects, except that she shares fairly in the proceeds of the enterprise.
 She goes before her principal, opens all the doors at which he pleases to
 exert his singing powers, and busies herself during the time of the song in
 sweeping the floor with her broomstick, or in playing any other antics that
 she thinks may amuse the indwellers. The common reward of this entertainment
 is a halfpenny; but many churlish persons fall upon the unfortunate guizards
 and beat them out of the house. Let such persons, however, keep a good watch
 over their cabbage-gardens next Hallowe'en.</p>
 <p>.</p>
 <p>"The more important of the guizards are of a
 theatrical character. There is one rude and grotesque drama which they
 are accustomed to perform on each of the four above-mentioned nights,
 and which, in various fragments or versions, exists in every part of
 Lowland Scotland. The per. formers, who are never less than three, but
 sometimes as many as six, having dressed themselves, proceed in a band
 from house to house, generally contenting themselves with the kitchen
 for an arena, whither, in mansions presided over by the spirit of
 good-humour, the whole family will resort to witness the spectacle. Sir
 Walter Scott, who delighted to keep up old customs, and could condescend
 to simple things without losing genuine dignity, invariably had a set of
 guizards to perform this play before his family both at Ashiestiel and
 Abbotsford. The editor has with some difficulty obtained what appears a
 tolerably complete copy." [a]</p>
 <p align="CENTER">"GOOSE-DANCING."</p>
 <p>"OF late years, at this season, in the Islands of
 Scilly, the young people exercise a sort of gallantry called
 'goose-dancing.' The maidens are dressed up for young men, and the young
 men for maidens; and thus disguised, they visit their neighbours in
 companies, where they dance and make jokes upon what has happened in the
 island, and every one is humorously 'told their own,' without offence
 being taken. By this sort of sport, according to yearly custom and
 toleration, there is a spirit of wit and drollery kept up among the
 people. The music and dancing done, they are treated with liquor, and
 then they go to the next house of entertainment." [b]</p>
 <p>This custom was by no means confined to the Islands
 of Scilly. In nearly every town and large village in Cornwall, <i>
 geese-dancing</i>,--not goose-dancing,--formed one of the Christmas
 entertainments. The term was applied to the old Christmas plays, and
 indeed to any kind of sport in which characters were assumed by the
 performers, or disguises worn.</p>
 <p>It should be noted that these sports are never-
 termed <i>goose</i>, but always <i>geese</i> or <i>guise</i> dancing.</p>
