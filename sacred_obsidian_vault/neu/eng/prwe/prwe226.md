 <p align="CENTER">MIDSUMMER SUPERSTITIOUS CUSTOMS.</p>
 <p>IF on midsummer-eve a young woman takes off the shift
 which I she has been wearing, and, having washed it, turns its wrong side
 out, and hangs it in silence over the back of a chair, near the fire, she
 will see, about midnight, her future husband, who deliberately turns the
 garment.</p>
 <p>If a young lady will, on midsummer-eve, walk backwards
 into the garden and gather a rose, she has the means of knowing who is to be
 her husband. The rose must be cautiously sewn up in a paper bag, and put
 aside in a dark drawer, there to remain until Christmas-day.</p>
 <p>On the morning of the Nativity the bag must be carefully
 opened in silence, and the rose placed by the lady in her bosom. Thus she
 must wear it to church. Some youngman will either ask for the rose, or take
 it from her without asking. That young man is destined to become eventually
 the lady's husband.</p>
 <p>"At eve last midsummer no sleep I sought,<br>
 But to the field a bag of hemp-seed brought;<br>
 I scatter'd round the seed on every side,<br>
 And three times in a trembling accent cried,--<br>
 'This hemp-seed with my virgin hand I sow,<br>
 Who shall my true love be, the crop shall mow.'<br>
 I straight look'd back, and, if my eyes speak truth,<br>
 With his keen scythe behind me came the youth."<br>
 <i>Gay's Pastoral:.</i></p>
 
 <p>The practice of sowing hemp-seed on midsummer-eve is not
 especially a Cornish superstition, yet it was at one time a favourite
 practice with young women to try the experiment. Many a strange story have I
 been told as to the result of the sowing, and many a trick could I tell off,
 which has been played off by young men who had become acquainted with the
 secret intention of some maidens. I believe there is but little difference
 in the rude rhyme used on the occasion, --</p>
 <p>"Hemp-seed I sow,<br>
 Hemp-seed I hoe,"</p>
 <p>(the action of sowing the seed and of hoeing it in, must be
 deliberately gone through) ;--</p>
 <p>"And he<br>
 Who will my true love be,<br>
 Come after me and mow."</p>
 <p>A phantom of the true lover will now appear, and of course
 the maid or maidens retire in wild affright.</p>
 <p>If a young unmarried woman stands at midnight on
 Midsummer-eve in the porch of the parish church, she will see, passing by in
 procession, every one who will die in the parish during the year. This is so
 serious an affair that it is not, I believe, often tried. I have, however,
 heard of young women who have made the experiment. But every one of the
 stories relate that, coming last in the procession, they have seen shadows
 of themselves; that from that day forward they have pined, and ere midsummer
 has again come round, that they have been laid to rest in the village
 graveyard.</p>
