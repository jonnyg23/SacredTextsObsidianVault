 <p align="CENTER">ST PIRAN'S-DAY AND PICROUS-DAY.</p>
 <p>HONE, in his "Every-Day Book," has the following remarks
 on St Piran :</p>
 <p>"This saint, anciently of good repute in Cornwall, is not
 mentioned by Butler. According to Porter, he was born in Ireland, and became
 a hermit there. He afterwards came to England, and settling at Cornwall, had
 a grave made for hint, entered into it, and dying on the 6th of March, 'in
 the glorie of a great light and splendour that appeared at the same
 instant,' was buried at Padstow. 'He is reported,' says Porter, 'to have
 wrought manie wonderful miracles in his lifetime, which, because they tend
 rather to breed an incredulous amazement in the readers, than move to anie
 workes of virtues or pietie, we have willingly omitted.' We have had a
 specimen of such miracles as Father Porter deemed worthy of belief; those of
 St Piran, which would have caused 'incredulous amassment' in Porter's
 readers, must have been 'passing wonderful.'"</p>
 <p>"<i>St .Piran's.day</i> is said to be a favourite with
 the tinners. Having a tradition that some secrets regarding the manufacture
 of tin was communicated to their ancestors by that saint, they leave the
 manufacture to shift for itself for that day, and keep it as a holiday." [a]</p>
 <p>Mr T. Q. Couch obligingly favours me with the following note
 on Picous-day:-- </p>
 <p>"The second Thursday before Christmas-day is a festival
 observed by the tinners of the district of Blackmore, and known as .Picrous
 day. It is not at present marked by any distinctive ceremonies, but it is
 the occasion of a supper and much merry-making. The owner of the tin-stream
 contributes a shilling a man towards it.<i> This is said to be the feast of
 the discovery of tin by a man named Picrous</i>. My first impression was
 that the day took its name from the circumstance of a pie forming the pièce
 de résistance of the supper; butt this explanation is not allowed by tinners,
 nor sanctioned by the usages of the feast. What truth there may be in the
 tradition of the first tinner, Picrous, it is now too late to discover, but
 the notion is worth recording. It has occurred to me whether, from some
 similarity between the names (not a close one, I admit it), the honours of
 Picrous may not have been transferred to St Piran, who is generally said to
 be the patron saint of tunners. St Piran is not known in Blackmore, and his
 festival is on the <sub>5</sub>th of March. The tinners also have a festival
 to commemorate the discovery of smelting."</p>
