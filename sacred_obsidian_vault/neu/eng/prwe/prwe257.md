 <p align="CENTER">SNAKES AVOID THE ASH-TREE.</p>
 <p>
  IT is said that no kind of snake is ever found near the
 "ashen-tree," and that a branch of the ash-tree will prevent a snake from
 coming near a person.</p>
 <p>A child who was in the habit of receiving its portion of
 bread and milk at the cottage door, was found to be in the habit of
 sharing its food with one of the poisonous adders. The reptile came
 regularly every morning, and the child, pleased with the beauty of his
 companion, encouraged the visits. The babe and adder were close friends.</p>
 <p>Eventually this became known to the mother, and, finding
 it to be a matter of difficulty to keep the snake from the child whenever
 it was left alone,--and she was frequently, being a labourer in the fields,
 compelled to leave her child to shift for itself,--she adopted the
 precaution of binding an "ashen-twig" about its body.</p>
 <p>The adder no longer came near the child; but from that day
 forward the child~ pined, and eventually died, as all around said, through
 grief at having lost the companion by whom it had been fascinated.</p>
