 <p align="CENTER">WHISTLING</p>
 <p>
  TO whistle by night is one of the unpardonable sins amongst
 the fishermen of St Ives. My correspondent says, "I would no more dare go
 among a party of fishermen at night whistling a popular air than into a
 den of untamed tigers."</p>
 <p>No miner will allow of whistling underground. I could
 never learn from the miners whether they regarded it as unlucky or not. I
 rather think they feel that whistling indicates thoughtlessness, and they
 know their labour is one of danger, requiring serious attention.</p>
