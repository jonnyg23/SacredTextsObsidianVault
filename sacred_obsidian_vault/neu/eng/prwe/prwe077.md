 <p align="CENTER">THE ARMED KNIGHT.</p>
 <p><br>
 "AT low water there is to be seen, off the Land's End, towards the Scilly
 Island (probably so called from the abundance of eel or conger fishes caught
 there, which are called sillys, or lillis), for a mile or more, a dangerous
 strag of ragged rocks, amongst which the Atlantic Sea and the waves of St
 George's and the British Channel meeting, make a dreadful bellowing and
 rumbling noise at half-ebb and half-flood, which let seamen take notice of to
 avoid them.</p>
 <p>"Of old, there was one of those rocks more notable than the
 rest, which tradition saith was ninety feet above the flux and reflux of the
 sea, with an iron spire at the top thereof, which was overturned or thrown
 down in a violent storm, 1647, and the rock was broken in three pieces. This
 iron spire, as the additions to Camden's "Britannia" inform us, was thought
 to have been erected by the Romans, or set up as a trophy there by King
 Athelstan, when he first conquered the Scilly Islands (which was in those
 parts); but it is not very probable such a piece of iron, in this salt sea
 and air, without being consumed by rust, could endure so long a time.
 However, it is or was, certain I am it commonly was called in Cornish, An
 Marogeth Arvowed, <i>i.e</i>., the Armed Knight; for what reason I know not,
 except erected by or in memory of some armed knight; as also Carne-an-peul,
 <i>i.e</i>., the spile, spire, or javelin rock. Again, remember silly lilly,
 is in Cornish and Armoric language a conger fish or fishes, from whence
 Scilly Islands is probably denominated, as elsewhere noted." [a] Mr Blight
 says this rock is also called <i>Guela</i>, or <i>Guelaz</i>,--the "rock
 easily seen."</p>
