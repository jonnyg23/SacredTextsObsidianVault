 <p align="CENTER">PENGERSWICK</p>
 <p>ANOTHER legend relates that it was not the stepmother
 found by Pengerswick whose "skin was covered with scales like a
 serpent," but that the lady brought 'home from Palestine by him was an
 Ophidian--a serpent-worshipper. Hence she became celebrated as a woman
 possessed by a serpent--having a serpent's power--in fact, a Lamia. 
 This is the only tradition of the kind with which I am acquainted in
 this county.</p>
