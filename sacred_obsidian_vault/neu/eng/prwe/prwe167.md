 <p align="CENTER">CARLIAN IN KEA</p>
 <p>ONE of the most celebrated of Arthur's knights, Sir
 Tristram, is said to have been born in this parish. A tradition of this is
 preserved in the parish, but it is probably derived from the verses of
 Thomas of Erceldoune, better known as Thomas the Rhymer.</p>
