 <p align="CENTER">THE CITY OF LANGARROW OR LANGONA.--
 PERRAN CHURCHES.</p>
 <p>NEAR the oldest Perran church there formerly existed a
 lake called the <i>Vlow</i>, and across this lake the sand was never
 blown. The sands encroached rapidly on the first church, and it was
 resolved by the parish to build a church on the other side of the lake,
 where it would be quite beyond the reach of the sands. The church was
 built and remained for a long period free from the effects of the
 blowing sands. At length a miner, called Roberts, drove an adit in from
 the cliffs under the lake, to reach the mine now called Huel Vlow, and
 this carried off all the water from the lake. Then the sands rapidly
 advanced towards, and at length threatened to bury, the second church.
 So great was the danger of this, that at length it was resolved to
 remove the church to the position which it at present occupies. The
 limits of the lake can be readily traced.</p>
 <p>It is now said--and there is much appearance of truth
 in it--that the sand will not cross the small stream which divides
 Perranzabuloe from Cubert. Those who have watched the travelling of the
 sand will understand the influence of running water in checking its
 progress.</p>
