 <p align="CENTER">THE LIZARD PEOPLE</p>
 <p>THERE is a tradition that the Lizard people were formerly
 a very inferior race. In fact it is said that they went on all fours, till
 the crew of a foreign vessel, wrecked on the coast, settled among them, and
 improved the race so much that they became as remarkable for their stature
 and physical development as they had been before for the reverse. At this
 time, as a whole, the Lizard folks certainly have among them a very large
 population of tall people, many of the men and women being over six feet in
 height.</p>
