 <p align="CENTER">THE SPRIGGANS OF TRENCROM HILL.</p>
 <p><br>
 IT is not many years since a man, who thought he was fully informed as to the
 spot in which a crock of the giant's gold was buried, proceeded on one fine
 moonlight night to this enchanted hill, and with spade and pick commenced his
 search. He proceeded for some time without interruption, and it became evident
 to him that the treasure was not far off. The sky was rapidly covered with the
 darkest clouds, shutting out the brilliant light o the moon--which had
 previously gemmed each cairn--and leaving the gold-seeker in total and
 unearthly darkness. The wind rose, and roared terrifically amidst the rocks;
 but this was soon drowned amidst the fearful crashes of thunder, which
 followed in quick succession the flashes of lightning. By its light the man
 perceived that the spriggans were coming out in swarms from all the rocks.
 They were in countless numbers; and although they were small at first, they
 rapidly increased in size, until eventually they assumed an almost giant form,
 looking all the while, as he afterwards said, "as ugly as if they would eat
 him." How this poor man escaped is unknown, but he is said to have been so
 frightened that he took to his bed, and was not able to work for a long time.</p>
