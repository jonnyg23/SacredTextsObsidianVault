 <p align="CENTER">THE PADSTOW "HOBBY-HORSE." [a]</p>
 <p>
  <br>
 AT the time of the spring festival, which is observed at Helston as a
 revel in honour, probably, of Flora, and hence called the "Furry-day," and by
 the blowing of horns and gathering of the "May" in St Ives and other places,
 the people of Padstow were a few years since in the habit of riding the
 "hobby-horse" to water. This hobby-horse was, after it had been taken round
 the town, submerged in the sea. The old people said it was once believed that
 this ceremony preserved the cattle of the inhabitants from disease and death.
 The appearance of a white horse escaping from the flood which buried the
 Lionesse, is told at several points, on both the north and south coast, and
 the riding of the hobby-horse probably belongs to this tradition. In support
 of this idea, we must not forget the mermaid story associated with the harbour
 of Padstow.</p>
 <p>The water-horse is a truly Celtic tradition. We have it in
 the "Arabian Nights," and in the stories of all countries in the south of
 Europe. Mr Campbell, "West Highland Tales," says he finds the horse brought
 prominently forward in the Breton legends, and that animal figures largely in
 the traditions of Scotland and Ireland.</p>
 <p>Has the miners' phrase --" a horse in the lode," applied to
 a mass of unproductive ground in the middle of a mineral lode; or, "Black Jack
 rides a good horse," signifying that zinc ore gives good promise for copper --
 anything to do with these traditions?</p>
