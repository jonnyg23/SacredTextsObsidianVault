 <p align="CENTER">THE COCK-CROW STONE.</p>
 <p><br>
 A ROCK of white marble (?) with many rock basins on its surface lies in Looe
 harbour, under Saunder's Lane, and is now -covered by every tide. This stone
 once stood on the top of an elevated rock near it, and when in this position,
 whenever it heard a cock crow in the neighbouring farmyard of Hay, it turned
 round three times.</p>
 <p>The topmost stone of that curious pile of rocks in the parish
 of St Cleer known as the Cheesewring is gifted in like manner. Even now the
 poultry-yards are very distant, but in ancient days the cocks must have crowed
 most lustily, to have produced vibrations on either the sensitive rock or the
 tympanum of man.</p>
