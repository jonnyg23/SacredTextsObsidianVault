 <p align="CENTER">DEATH TOKENS AND SUPERSTITIONS.</p>
 <p>"Continually at my bed's head<br>
 A hearse doth hang, which doth me tell <br>
 That I ere morning may be dead,<br>
 Though now I feel myself full well."<br>
 ROBERT SOUTHWELL</p>
 <p align="CENTER">THE DEATH-TOKEN OF THE VINGOES.</p>
 <p>"The messenger of God<br>
 With golden trumpet I see,<br>
 With many other angels more,<br>
 Which sound and call for use.<br>
 Instead of musicke sweet,<br>
 Go toll my passing bell"<br>
 <i>The Bride's Burial.</i></p>
 
 <p>WWHEN you cross the brook which divides St Leven from
 Sennen, you are on the estate of Treville.</p>
 <p>Tradition tells us that this estate was given to an old
 family who came with the Conqueror to this country. This ancestor is said to
 have been the Duke of Normandy's wine-taster, and that he belonged to the
 ancient counts of Treville, hence the name of the estate. Certain it is the
 property has ever been held without poll deeds. For many generations the
 family has been declining, and the race is now nearly, if not quite,
 extinct.</p>
 <p>Through all time a peculiar token has marked the coming
 death of a Vingoe. Above the deep caverns in the Treville cliff rises a carn
 . On this, chains of fire were seen ascending and descending, and often
 accompanied by loud and frightful noises.</p>
 <p>It is said that these tokens have not been seen since the
 last male of the family came to a violent end.</p>
