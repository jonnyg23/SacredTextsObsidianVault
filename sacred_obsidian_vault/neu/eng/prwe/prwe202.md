 <p align="CENTER">JACK HARRY'S LIGHTS.</p>
 <p>THE phantom lights are called, they tell me, "Jack
 Harry's lights," because he was the first man who was fooled by them. They
 are generally observed before a gale, and the ship seen is like the ship
 which is sure to be wrecked. The man who communicated this to me said, "What
 or how it is we can't tell, but the fact of its being seen is too plain."</p>
 <p>The following is another version, which I received from
 an old pilot--</p>
 <p>"Some five years ago, on a Sunday night, the wind being
 strong, our crew heard of a large vessel in the offing, after we came out of
 chapel. We manned our big boat, the Ark,--she was nearly new then,--and
 away we went, under close-reefed foresail and little mizen, the sea going
 over us at a sweet rate. The vessel stood just off the head, the wind
 blowing W. N. W. We had gone off four or five miles, and we thought we were
 up alongside, when, lo I she slipped to windward a league or more. Well, off
 we went after her, and a good beating match we had, too; but the <i>Ark </i>
 was a safe craft, and we neared and neared till, as we thought, we got up
 close. Away she whizzed in a minute, in along to Godrevy, just over the
 course we sailed; so we gave it up for "Jack Harry's light," and, with wet
 jackets and disappointed hopes, we bore up for the harbour, prepared to hear
 of squalls, which came heavier than ever next day.</p>
 <p>"Scores of pilots have seen and been led a nice chase
 after them. They are just the same as the <i>Flying Dutchman, </i>seen off
 the Cape of Good Hope."</p>
 <p>Another man informed me that, once coming down channel,
 they had a phantom ship alongside of them for miles it was a moonlight
 night, with a thin rain and mist. They could see several men aboard moving
 about. They hailed her several times, but could not get an answer, "and we
 didn't know what to think of her, when all at once she vanished."</p>
