 <p align="CENTER">THE HOOPER, OR THE HOOTER, OF SENNEN
 COVE.</p>
 <p>THIS was supposed to be a spirit which took the form of a
 band of misty vapour, stretching across the bay, so opaque that nothing
 could be seen through it. It was regarded as a kindly interposition of some
 ministering spirit, to warn the fishermen against venturing to sea. This
 appearance was always followed, and often suddenly, by a severe storm. It is
 seldom or never seen now. One profane old fisherman would not be warned by
 the bank of fog. The weather was fine on the shore, and the</p>
 <p>waves fell tranquilly on the sands; and this aged sinner,
 declaring he would not be made a fool of, persuaded some young men to join
 him. They manned a boat, and the aged leader, having with him a
 threshing-flail, blasphemously declared that he would drive. the spirit
 away; and he vigorously beat the fog with the "threshel"--so the flail is
 called.</p>
 <p>The boat passed through the fog and went to sea. A severe
 storm came on. No one ever saw the boat or the men again; and since that
 time the Hooper has been rarely seen.</p>
