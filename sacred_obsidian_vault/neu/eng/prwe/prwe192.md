 CHRISTMAS-EVE IN THE MINES.</h3>
 <h3>ON Christmas-eve, in former days, the
 small people, or the spriggans, would meet at the bottom of the deepest
 mines, and have a midnight mass. Then those who were in the mine would hear
 voices, melodious beyond all earthly voices, singing, "Now well ! now well;
 " [a] and the strains of some deep-toned organ would shake the rocks. Of the
 grandeur of those meetings, old stories could not find words sufficiently
 sonorous to speak; it was therefore left to the imagination But this was
 certain, the temple
 formed by the fairy
 bands in which to celebrate the eve of the birth of a Saviour, in whose
 mercy they all had hope, was of the most magnificent description.</h3>
 <h3>Midsummer-eve and
 new-year's day and eve are holidays with the miners. It has been said they
 refuse to work of those days from superstitious reasons. I never heard of
 any.</h3>
 <h3>
 [a] "Now well I now well!
 the angel did say<i><br>
 </i>To certain poor shepherds in the fields who lay<i><br>
 </i>Late in the night, folding their sheep;<i><br>
 </i>A winter's night, both cold and, deep.<i><br>
 </i>Now well ! now well ! now well !<i><br>
 </i>Born is the King of Israel !"</h3>
