 <p align="CENTER">THE DEVIL AND HIS DANDY-DOGS.</p>
 <p><br>
 A POOR herdsman was journeying homeward across the moors one windy night, when
 he heard at a distance among the Tors the baying of hounds, which he soon
 recognised as the dismal chorus of the dandy-dogs. It was three or four miles
 to his house; and very much alarmed, he hurried onward as fast as the
 treacherous nature of the soil and the uncertainty of the path would allow;
 but, alas! the melancholy yelping of the hounds, and the dismal bolloa of the
 hunter came nearer and nearer. After a considerable run, they had so gained
 upon him, that on looking back,--oh horror! he could distinctly see hunter
 and dogs. The former was terrible to look at, and had the usual complement of
 saucer-eyes, horns, and tail, accorded by common consent to the legendary
 devil. He was hiack, of course, and carried in his hand a long hunting-pole.
 The dogs, a numerous pack, blackened the small patch of moor that was visible;
 each snorting fire, and uttering a yelp of indescribably frightful tone. No
 cottage, rock, or tree was near to give the herdsman shelter, and nothing
 apparently remained to him but to abandon himself to their fury, when a happy
 thought suddenly flashed upon him and suggested a resource. Just as they were
 about to rush upon him, he fell on his knees in prayer. There was strange
 power in the holy words he uttered; for immediately, as if resistance had
 been offered, the hell-hounds stood at bay, howling more dismally than ever,
 and the hunter shouted, 'Bo Shrove,' which (says my informant means in the old
 language, 'The boy trays,' at which they all drew off on some other pursuit
 and disappeared."</p>
