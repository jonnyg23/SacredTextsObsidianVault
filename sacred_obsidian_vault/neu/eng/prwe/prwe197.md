 <p align="CENTER">THE DEAD HAND.</p>
 <p>"I 've seen it--I've seen it !" exclaimed a young woman,
 pale with terror, approaching with much haste the door of a cottage, around
 which were gathered several of the miners' wives inhabiting the adjoining
 dwellings.</p>
 <p>"God's mercy be with the chield !" replied the oldest woman
 of the group, with very great seriousness.</p>
 <p>"Aunt Alice," asked one of the youngest women, "and do 'e
 b'lieve any harm will come o' seeing it ?"</p>
 <p>"Mary Doble saw it and pined; Jinny Trestrail was never the
 same woman after she seed the hand in Wheal Jewel; and I knows ever so many
 more; but let us hope, by the blessing o' the Lord, no evil will come on
 Mary."</p>
 <p>Mary was evidently impressed with a sense of some heavy
 trouble. She sighed deeply, and pressed her hand to her side, as if to still
 the beating of her heart. The thoughtless faith of the old woman promised to
 work out a fulfilment of her fears in producing mental distress and
 corporeal suffering in the younger one.</p>
 <p>While this was passing in the little village, a group of men
 were gathered around a deserted shaft, which existed in too dangerous
 proximity with the abodes of the miners. They were earnestly discussing the
 question of the reality of the appearance of the <i>dead </i>hand--those
 who had not seen it expressing a doubt of its reality, while others declared
 most emphatically, "that in that very shaft they had seed un with a lighted
 candle in his hand, moving up and down upon the ladders, as though he was
 carried by a living man."</p>
 <p>It appears that some time previously to the abandonment of
 the mine, an unfortunate miner was ascending from his subterranean labours,
 carrying his candle in his hand. He was probably seized with giddiness, but
 from that or some other cause, he fell away from the ladders, and was found
 by his comrades a bleeding corpse at the bottom. The character of this man
 was not of the best; and after his burial, it was stated by the people that
 <i>he had been seen. </i>From a vague rumour of his spectral appearance on
 the surface, the tale eventually settled itself into that of the dead hand
 moving up and down in the shaft.</p>
 <p>By the spectral light of the candle, the hand had been
 distinctly visible to many, and the irregular motion of the light proved
 that the candle was held in the usual manner between the thumb and finger in
 its ball of clay, while the fingers were employed in grasping stave after
 stave of the ladder. The belief in the evil attendant on being unfortunate
 enough to see this spectral hand, prevailed very generally amongst the
 mining population about twenty years since. The dead hand was not, however,
 confined to one shaft or mine. Similar narrations have been met with in
 several districts.</p>
