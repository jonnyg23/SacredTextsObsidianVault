 <p align="CENTER">THE SPANIARD AT PENRYN</p>
 <p>IN the reign of James I. there happened to be upon our
 coast a Spanish vessel of war. Favoured by the mists of evening and the
 growing darkness, the ship entered Falmouth Harbour unseen. The crew armed
 themselves, and taking to their boats, proceeded with great caution to the
 town of Penryn, situated at the head of the harbour. There they landed,
 formed themselves into proper order, and marched into the town, purposing to
 plunder the inhabitants and bum the town. With steady tramp they cautiously
 proceeded up the dark main street, resolving to attack the principal
 dwellings first. Suddenly a great shout was heard, drums and trumpets
 sounded, the noise of many feet rushing to and fro fell on the ears of the
 Spaniards. Believing that they were discovered, and that preparations had
 been made for their reception, fear seized them, and they fled precipitately
 to their boats and left the town. The martial music proceeded, however, from
 a temporary theatre, in which a troop of strolling players were entertaining
 the people.</p>
