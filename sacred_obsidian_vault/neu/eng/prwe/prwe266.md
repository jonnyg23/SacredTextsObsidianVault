 <p align="CENTER">THE SUN NEVER SHINES ON THE PERJURED</p>
 <p>
  THERE appears to exist a very old superstition, to the
 effect that when a man has deeply perjured himself--especially if by his
 perjury he has sacrificed the life of a friend,--he not merely loses the
 enjoyment of the sunshine, but he actually loses all consciousness of its
 light or its warmth. Howsoever bright the sun may shine, the weather
 appears to him gloomy, dark, and cold.</p>
 <p>I have recently been told of a man living in the western
 part of Cornwall, who is said to have sworn away the life of an innocent
 person. "The face of this false witness is the colour of one long in the
 tomb; and he has never, since the death of the victim of his forswearing,
 seen the sun." It must be remembered the perjured man is not blind. All
 things around him are seen as by other men, but the sense of vision is so
 dulled that the world is for ever to him in a dark, vapoury cloud.</p>
