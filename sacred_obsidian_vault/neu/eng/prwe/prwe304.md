 <p align="CENTER">PECULIAR WORDS AND PHRASES [a]</p>
 <p>"THE people in the west," writes a correspondent, "have I
 adopted many words from the Danish invaders." Tradition assures us that
 the sea-rovers of the North frequently landed at Witsand Bay, burned and
 pillaged the villages of Escols and Mayon, sometimes took off the women,
 but never made a settlement. Certain red-haired families are often
 referred to as Danes and the dark-haired people will not marry with "a
 red-haired Dane.' He continues :-- "If you were in Buryan Church town this
 evening, you might probably hear Betty Trenoweth say, 'I 'll take off my
 <i>touser</i> [toute serve], and run up to Janey Angwins to <i>cousey</i>
 [causer] a spell; there's a lot of boys gone in there, so there'll be a
 grand <i>courant </i>[de courir], I expect.' In a short time Betty may
 come back disappointed, saying, ' 'Twas a mere <i>cow's courant</i> after
 all, cheld vean--all hammer and tongs.'"</p>
 <p>The <i>touser</i> is a large apron or wrapper to come
 quite round and keep the under garments clean. By a <i>courant</i> with the boys, they
 mean a game of running romps. It is not at all uncommon in other parts of
 the country to hear the people say, "It was a
  fine <i>courant</i>," "We 'ye had a
 good <i>courant</i>," when they intend to express the enjoyment of some
 pleasure party. These are, however, probably more nearly allied to
 Norman-French.</p>
 <p>
 There are some proverbial expressions peculiar to the west :-</p>
 <p>
 "Sow barley in dree, and wheat in pul." [b]</p>
 <p>
 "To make an old nail good, right it on wood."</p>
 <p>
 " Fill the sack, then it cars stand."<br>
 The last meaning that neither man nor beast can work on an empty stomach.</p>
 <p>
 The following are a few of less common
 expressions, presenting remarkable words :-</p>
 <p>
 'Tis not <i>bezibd</i>--It is not allotted
 me.</p>
 <p>
 He will never <i>scrip</i> it--He will
 never escape it.</p>
 <p>
 He is nothing <i>pridy</i>--He is not
 handsome.</p>
 <p>
 Give her <i>dule</i>--Give her some comfort
 or consolation.</p>
 <p>
 Hark to his <i>lidden</i>--Listen to his
 word or talk.</p>
 <p>
 -  It was <i>twenty</i> or <i>some</i>--It
 was about twenty.</p>
 <p>
 The wind brings the <i>pilme</i>--The wind
 raises the dust.</p>
 <p>
 How thick the <i>brusse</i> lies--How thick
 the dust lies.</p>
 <p>
 He is <i>throyting</i>--He is cutting chips
 from sticks.</p>
 <p>
 He came of a good <i>havage</i>--He
 belongs to a good or respectable family.</p>
 <p>
 <i>Hame</i>--a straw collar with wooden
 collar-trees, to which are fastened the rope traces.</p>
 <p>
 <i>Scalpions</i> (buckthorn, or rather
 buckhorn)--salt dried fish, usually the whiting.</p>
 <p>

 --[pilcbards], and drinking mahogany [gin and treacle]."</p>
