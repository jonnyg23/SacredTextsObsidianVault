 <p align="CENTER">THE NINE MAIDS, OR VIRGIN SISTERS.</p>
 <p><br>
 NINE "Moor Stones" are set up near the road in the parish of Gwendnon, or
 Wendron, to which the above name is given. The perpendicular blocks of granite
 have evidently been placed with much labour in their present position.
 Tradition says they indicate the graves of nine sisters. Hals appears to think
 some nuns were buried here. From one person only I heard the old stony of the
 stones having been metamorphosed maidens. Other groups of stone might be
 named, as Rosemedery, Tregaseal, Boskednan, Botallack, Tredinek, and Crowlas,
 in the west, to which the same story extends, and many others in the eastern
 parts of the county; but it cannot be necessary.</p>
