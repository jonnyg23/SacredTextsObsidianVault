 <p align="CENTER">THE SISTERS OF GLEN-NEOT</p>
 <p align="CENTER">by THE LATE REV. R. S. HAWKER OF MORWENSTOW.</p>
 <p>IT IS from
 Neot's sainted steep</p>
 <p>The foamy waters
 flash and leap;</p>
 <p>It is where
 shrieking wildflowers grow,</p>
 <p>They lave the
 nymph that dwells below !</p>
 <p>But wherefore in
 this far-off dell, </p>
 <p>The reliques of
 a human cell ?</p>
 <p>Where the sad
 stream and lonely wind</p>
 <p>Bring Man no
 tidings of their kind !</p>
 <p>Long years agone
 ! the otd man said,</p>
 <p>'Twas told him
 by his grandsire dead,</p>
 <p>One day two
 ancient sisters came,</p>
 <p>None there could
 tell their race or name.</p>
 <p>Their speech was
 not in Cornish phrase,</p>
 <p>Their garb had
 marks of loftier days;</p>
 <p>Slight food they
 took from hands of men,</p>
 <p>They wither'd
 slowly in that glen.</p>
 <p>One died ! the
 other's shrunken eye</p>
 <p>Gush'd till the
 fount of tears was dry;</p>
 <p>A wild and
 wasting thought had she --</p>
 <p>"I shall have
 none to weep for me !"</p>
 <p>They found her
 silent at the last,</p>
 <p>Bent in the
 shape wherein she pass'd --</p>
 <p>Where her lone
 seat long used to stand,</p>
 <p>Her head upon
 her shrivell'd hand !</p>
 <p>Did fancy give
 this legend birth ?</p>
 <p>The grandame's
 tale for winter-hearth,</p>
 <p>Or some dead
 bark, by Neot's stream</p>
 <p>People these
 banks with such a dream ?</p>
 <p>We know not !
 but it suits the scene,</p>
 <p>To think such
 wild things here have been;</p>
 <p>What spot more
 meet could grief or sin</p>
 <p>Choose at the
 last to wither in ?</p>
