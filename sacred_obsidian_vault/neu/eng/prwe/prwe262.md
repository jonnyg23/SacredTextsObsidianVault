 <p align="CENTER">THE BONFIRE TEST</p>
 <p>
  A BONFIRE is formed of faggots of furze, ferns, and the
 like. Men and maidens by locking hands form a circle, and commence a dance
 to some wild native song. At length, as the dancers become excited, they
 pull each other from side to side across the fire. If they succeed in
 treading out the fire without breaking the chain, none of the party will
 die during the year. If, however, the ring is broken before the fire is
 extinguished, "bad luck to the weak hands," as my informant said.</p>
