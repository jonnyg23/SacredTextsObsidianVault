 <p align="CENTER">JAGO'S DEMON.</p>
 <p>THE vicar of Wendron, who bore the name of Jago, appears to
 have had strange intercourse with the invisible world; or, rather, the
 primitive people of this district believe him to have possessed supernatural
 powers. Any one visiting the parish of Wendron will be struck with many
 distinguishing features in its inhabitants. It would appear as if a strange
 people had settled down amidst the races already inhabiting the spot, and that
 they had studiously avoided any intimate connection with their neighbours. The
 dialect of the Wendron people is unlike any other in Cornwall, and there are
 many customs existing amongst them which are not found in any other part of
 the county. Until of late years, the inhabitants of Wendron were quite
 uneducated;--. hence the readiness with which they associate ancient
 superstitions with comparatively modern individuals.</p>
 <p>The Reverend Mr Jago was no doubt a man who impressed this
 people with the powers of his knowledge. Hence we are told that no spirit
 walking the earth could resist the spells laid upon him by Jago. By his
 prayers--or powers--many a night wanderer has been put back into his grave,
 and so confined that the poor ghost could never again get loose. To the
 evil-disposed Mr Jago was a terror. All Wendron believed that every act was
 visible to the parson at the moment it was done-- day or night it mattered not.
 He has been known to pick a thief at once out of a crowd, and criminal men or
 women could not endure the glance of his eye. Many a person has at once
 confessed to guilty deeds of which they have been suspected the moment they
 have been brought before Mr Jago.</p>
 <p>We are told that he had spirits continually waiting upon
 him, though invisible until he desired them to appear. The parson rode far and
 wide over the moorland of his parish. He never took a groom with him; for, the
 moment he alighted from his horse, he had only to strike the earth with his
 whip, and up came a demon-groom to take charge of the steed.</p>
