 <p align="CENTER">"ST GEORGE"--THE CHRISTMAS PLAYS.</p>
 <p>THE Christmas play is a very ancient institution in
 Cornwall. At one time religious subjects were chosen, but those gave way to
 romantic plays. The arrangements were tolerably complete, and sometimes a
 considerable amount of dramatic skill was displayed.</p>
 <p>"St George, and the other tragic performers, are dressed
 out some. what in the style of morris-dancers, in their shirt sleeves and
 white trousers, much decorated with riblbons and handkerchiefs, each carryg
 a drawn sword in his hand, if they can be procured, otherwise a cudgel. They
 wear high caps of pasteboard, adorned with beads, small pieces of
 looking-glass, coloured paper, &amp;c. ; several long strips of pith generally
 hang down from the top, with small pieces of different coloured cloth strung
 on them; the whole has a very smart effect.</p>
 <p>Father Christmas is personified in a grotesque manner, as
 an ancient man wearing a large mask and wig, and a huge club, wherewith he
 keeps the bystanders in order.</p>
 <p>The Doctor, who is generally the merryandrew of the piece,
 is dressed in any ridiculous way, with a wig, three-cornered hat, and
 painted face.</p>
 <p>The other comic characters are dressed according to fancy.
 </p>
 <p>The female, where there is one, is usually in the dress worn
 half a century ago.</p>
 <p>The hobbyhorse, which is a character sometimes introduced,
 wears a representation of a horse's hide.</p>
 <p>Beside the regular drama of "St George," many parties of
 mummers go about in fancy dresses of every sort, most commonly the males in
 female attire, and vice versa.</p>
 <p>BATTLE OF ST GEORGE</p>
 <p>[One of the party steps in, crying out, -</p>
 <p>Room, a room, brave gallants, room !<br>
 Within this court<br>
 I do resort<br>
 To show some sport<br>
 And pastime,<br>
 Gentlemen and ladies, in the Christmas time.</p>
 <p>[After this note of preparation, Old Father Christmas
 capers into the room, saying -</p>
 <p>Here comes I, Old Father Christmas;<br>
 Welcome or welcome not,<br>
 I hope Old Father Christmas<br>
 Will never be forgot.<br>
 I was born in a rocky country, where there was no wood to make me cradle; I
 was rocked in a stouring bowl, which made me round shouldered then, and I am
 round shouldered still.</p>
 <p>[He then frisks about the room, until he thinks he has
 sufficiently amused the spectators, when he makes his exit, with this speech
 -</p>
 <p>Who went to the orchard to steal apples to make
 gooseberry pies against Christmas ?</p>
 <p>[These prose speeches, you may suppose, depend much upon
 the imagination of the actor.</p>
 <p><i>Enter Turkish Knight</i></p>
 <p>Here comes I, a Turkish Knight,<br>
 Come from the Turkish land to fight;<br>
 And if St George do meet me here,<br>
 I'll try his courage without fear.</p>
 <p><i>Enter St George</i></p>
 <p>Here comes I, St George,<br>
 That worthy champion bold;<br>
 And, with my sword and spear,<br>
 I won three crowns of gold.<br>
 I fought the dragon bold,<br>
 And brought him to the slaughter;<br>
 By that I gain'd fair Sabra,<br>
 To the King of Egypt's daughter.</p>
 <p>T.K. St George, I pray, be not too bold<br>
         If thy blood is hot, I'll soon make
 it cold<br>
 St. G Thou Turkish knight, I pray forbear;<br>
         I'll make thee dread my sword and
 spear.</p>
 <p>[They fight until the Turkish knight falls</p>
 <p>St. G I have a little bottle, which goes by the name
 Elicumpane;<br>
         If the man is alive, let him rise and
 fight again.</p>
 <p>[The Knight here rises on one knee, and endeavours to
 continue the fight, but is again struck down</p>
 <p>T.K. Oh pardon me, St George; oh pardon me, I crave;<br>
         Oh pardon me this once, and I will be
 thy slave.<br>
 St. G I'll never pardon a Turkish knight;<br>
         Therefore arise and try thy might.</p>
 <p>[The knight gets up, and they fight, till the knight
 receives a heavy blow, and then drops on the ground as dead.</p>
 <p>St G Is there a doctor to be found<br>
         To cure a deep and deadly wound ?</p>
 <p><i>Enter Doctor</i></p>
 <p>        Oh yes, there
 is a doctor to be found,<br>
         To cure a deep and deadly wound.</p>
 <p>St. G What can you cure ?<br>
 Doctor I can cure the itch, the palsy, and gout;<br>
         If the devil's in him. I'll pull him
 out.</p>
 <p>[The doctor here performs the cure with sundry grimaces,
 and St George and the knight again fight, when the latter is knocked down,
 and left for dead.</p>
 <p>[Then another performer enters, and on seeing the dead
 body, says, -</p>
 <p>        Ashes to
 ashes, dust to dust;<br>
         If Uncle Tom Pearce won't have him,
 Aunt Molly must.</p>
 <p>[The hobby horse here capers in, and takes off the body.</p>
 <p><i>Enter Old Squire</i></p>
 <p>        Here comes I,
 old, Old Squire<br>
         As black as any friar<br>
         As ragged as a colt,<br>
         To leave fine clothes for malt.</p>
 <p><i>Enter Hub Bub</i></p>
 <p>        Here comes I,
 old Hub Bub Bub Bub;<br>
         Upon my shoulders I carries a club,<br>
         And in my hand a frying pan,<br>
         So am I not a valient man ?</p>
 <p>[These characters serve as a sort of burlesque on St
 George and the other hero, and may be regarded in the light of an
 anti-masque</p>
 <p><i>Enter the Box-holder</i></p>
 <p>        Here comes I,
 great head and little wit;<br>
         Put your hand in your pocket, and
 give what you think fit.<br>
         Gentlemen and ladies sitting down at
 your ease,<br>
         Put your hand in your pocket, and
 give me what you please.</p>
 <h3><i>St </i>
 <i>G.</i> Gentlemen and
 ladies, the sport is almost ended;<br>
         Come pay to the box, it is highly
 commended.<br>
         The box it would speak, if it had but
 a tongue;<br>
         Come throw in your money, and think
 it no wrong.</h3>
 <h3>The characters now
 generally finish with a dance, or sometimes a song or two is introduced. In
 some of the performances, two or three other tragic heroes are brought
 forward, as the King of Egypt and his son, &amp;c.; but they are all of them
 much in the style of that I have just described, varying somewhat in length
 and number of characters."-- The <i>Every-Day Book.</i></h3>
 <h3>Of the Cornish
 mystery plays which were once acted in the famous "Rounds," it is not
 necessary, in this place, to say any­thing. The translations by Mr Norris
 preserve their characteristics, which indeed differ in few respects from the
 mystery plays of other parts.</h3>
 <h3>The "Perran Round"
 is fortunately preserved by the proprietor in its original state. Every one
 must regret the indifference of the wealthy inhabitants of <i>St </i>Just to
 their "Round," which is now a wretched ruin.</h3>
