 <p align="CENTER">PETER THE DEVIL.</p>
 <p>THE church at Altarnun is said to have been built from the
 remains of an ancient nunnery which had been founded in the early days of
 Christianity by the saint to whom it was dedicated.</p>
 <p>There was a peculiar sanctity about all that surrounded
 this little church and its holy well, and few were unfaithful enough to scoff
 at any of the holy traditions of the sacred place.</p>
 <p>About the time of Charles II., an under-clerk or deacon of
 this church was called Peter, and he is said to have been a man of exceedingly
 bad character. He scoffed at holy things, and--unless he was belied--he made
 use of his position for merely temporal benefit, and was not remarkable for
 his honesty. He was, moreover, the terror of the neighbourhood. Common report
 insisting on it that Peter had been known to disentomb the dead, whether for
 the purpose of stealing rings and other trinkets which may have been buried,
 as some said, or for the purpose of renewing his youth, as others suggested,
 by mysterious contact with the dead, was not clearly made out. He was
 invariably called Peter Jowle, or Joule--that is, Peter the Devil. At the age
 of a hundred he was a gray-headed, toothless man; but then, by some diabolical
 incantation, he is said to have caused new black hairs to spring forth amongst
 those which were white with age, and then also new teeth grew in his jaws.
 Peter is said to have, died when he was more than a hundred and fifty years
 old.</p>
