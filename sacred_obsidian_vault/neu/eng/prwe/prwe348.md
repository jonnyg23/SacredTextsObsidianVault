 <p align="CENTER">ST CHIWIDDEN.</p>
 <p>THE last Thursday--a clear week before Christmas day
 --was formerly always claimed by the tinners as a holiday, and was
 called by them White-Thursday (<i>Jew-whidn</i>), because on this day,
 according to tradition, black tin (tin ore) was first melted and refined
 into white tin. From <i>Jew-whian</i> to <i>Chi-widden</i> 'is an easy
 transition. Jew-whidn is a name given to the old furnaces generally
 called Jews'-houses.</p>
