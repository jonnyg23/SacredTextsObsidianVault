 <p align="CENTER">THE ROBIN AND THE WREN</p>
 <p>
  "THOSE who kill a robin or a wran,<br>
 Will never prosper, boy or man."</p>
 <p>This feeling is deeply impressed on every young mind;
 there are few, therefore, who would injure either of those birds.</p>
 <p>I remember that a boy in Redruth killed a robin: the dead
 robin was tied round his neck, and he was marched by the other boys
 through the town, all of them singing the above lines.</p>
