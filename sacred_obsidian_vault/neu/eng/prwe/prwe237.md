 <p align="CENTER">SHAM MAYORS.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">I.--THE MAYOR OF MYLOR.</p>
 <p>HERE was a curious custom in the town of Penryn in
 Cornwall, which long outlived all modern innovations. On some particular
 day in September or October (I forget the exact date), about when the
 hazel-nuts are ripe, the festival of nutting-day is kept. The rabble of
 the town go into the country to gather nuts returning in the evening with
 boughs of hazel in their hands, shouting and making a great noise. In the
 meantime the journeymen tailors of the town have proceeded to the
 adjoining village of Mylor,. and elected one of their number "Mayor of
 Mylor," taking care the. selection falls on the wittiest. Seated in a
 chair shaded with green boughs, and borne on the shoulders of four
 stalwart men, the worthy mayor proceeds from his "good town of Mylor" to
 his "ancient borough of Penryn," the van being led by the "bodyguard" of
 stout fellows well armed with cudgels,--which they do not fail to use
 should' their path be obstructed,--torch-bearers, and two "town
 serjeants," clad in official gowns and cocked hats,, and carrying each a
 monstrous cabbage on his shoulder in lieu of a mace. The rear is brought
 up by the rabble of the "nutters". About mid-day a band of music meets
 them, and plays them to Penryn, where they are received by the entire
 population. The procession proceeds to the town-hall, in front of which
 the mayor delivers a speech, declaratory of his intended improvements, &amp;c.
 for the coming year, being generally an excellent sarcastic burlesque on
 the speeches of parliamentary candidates. The procession then moves on to
 each; public-house door, where the mayor, his council, and .officers, are
 liberally supplied with liquor; and the speech is repeated with
 variations. They then adjourn to the "council-chamber," in some
 public-house, and devote the night to drinking. At night the streets are
 filled with people bearing torches, throwing fireballs, and discharging
 rockets; and huge bonfires are kindled on the "Green," and "Old Wall." The
 legal mayor once made an effort to put a stop to this saturnalia, but his
 new-made brother issued prompt orders to his body-guards, and the <i>posse
 comitatus </i>had to fly.</p>
 <p>The popular opinion is, that there is a clause in the
 borough charter compelling the legitimate mayor to surrender his power to
 the "Mayor of Mylor" on the night in question, and to lend the town
 sergeants' paraphernalia to the gentlemen
 of the shears.</p>
