 <p align="CENTER">THE RIVAL GIANTS.</p>
 <p><br>
 THOSE who have visited the Logan Rock will be familiar with the several groups
 which form the Treryn promontory. Treryn Castle, an ancient British fortress,
 the Cyclopean walls of which, and its outer earthwork, can still be traced,
 was the dwelling of a famous giant and his wife. I have heard it said that he
 gave his name to this place, but that is, of course, doubtful. This giant was
 chief of a numerous band, and by his daring he held possession, against the
 giants of the Mount, of all the lands west of Penzance. Amongst the hosts who
 owned allegiance to him, was a remarkable fine young fellow, who had his abode
 in a cave, in the pile of rocks upon which the Logan Rock stands. This young
 giant grew too fond of the giantess, and it would appear that the lady was not
 unfavourably inclined towards him. Of their love passes, however, we know
 nothing. Tradition has only told us that the giantess was one day reclining on
 the rock still known as the Giant Lady's Chair, while the good old giant was
 dosing in the Giant's Chair which stands near it, when the young and wicked
 lover stole behind his chief and stabbed him in the belly with a knife.[a] The
 giant fell over the rocks to the level ridge below, and there he lay, rapidly
 pouring out his life-blood. From this spot the young murderer kicked him into
 the sea, ere yet his life was quite extinct, and he perished in the waters.</p>
 <p>The guilty pair took possession of Treryn Castle, and, we
 are told, lived happily for many years. </p>
 <p>[a] Mr Halliwell infers from this that
 the story is Saxon. See "Wanderings in the Footsteps of the Giants"</p>
