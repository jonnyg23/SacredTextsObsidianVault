 <p align="CENTER">THE "PELLER"</p>
 <p>A MAN who has resided at several places on the south
 coast was known by this name. He is said to be in possession of no end of
 charms, and to possess powers, of no common order, over this and the other
 world. "He is able," writes a friend, "to put ghosts, hobgoblins, and, I
 believe, even Satan himself; to rest. I have known farmers well informed in
 many other matters, and members of religious bodies, go to the 'Peller' to
 have the 'spirits that possessed the calves' driven out; for they, the
 calves, 'were so wild, they tore down all the wooden fences and gates, and
 must be possessed with the devil.'</p>
 <p>"The 'Peller' always performs a cure; but as the evil
 spirits must go somewhere, and as it is always to be feared that they may
 enter into other calves or pigs, or, it may be, even possess the bodies of
 their owners themselves, the 'Peller' makes it imperative that a stone wall
 shall be built around the calves, to confine them for three times seven
 days, or until the next moon is as old as the present one. This precaution
 always results in taming the devils and the calves, and consequently in
 curing them--the 'Peller', usually sending the spirits to some very remote
 region, and chaining them down under granite rocks."</p>
 <p>An old woman had long suffered from debility; but she and
 her friends were satisfied that she had been ill-wished. So she went to the
 "Peller." He told her to buy a bullock's heart, and. get a packet of pound
 pins. She was to stick the heart as full of' pins as she could, and "the
 body that ill-wished her felt every. pin run into the bullock's heart same
 as if they had been run into her." The spell was taken off; and the old
 woman grew strong.</p>
 <p>An old man living on Lady Downs had a lot of money stolen
 from his house. He, too, went to the "Peller." In this case the magician
 performed the spells, and the man was told the money would be returned.
 After a few days, it was so; the money during the night, was tied to the
 handle of the door, and found there by the owner in the morning.</p>
