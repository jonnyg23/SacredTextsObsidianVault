 <p align="CENTER">THE MERMAID OF PADSTOW.</p>
 <p>THE port of Padstow has a good natural harbour, so far as
 rocky area goes, but it is so choked up with drifting sands as to be nearly
 useless. A peasant recently thus explained the cause. He told how "it was once
 deep water for the largest vessel, and under the care of a merry-maid--as he
 called her; but one day, as she was sporting on the surface, a fellow with a
 gun shot at her. "She dived for a moment; but re-appearing, raised her right
 arm, and vowed that henceforth the harbour should be desolate." "And," added
 the old man, "it always will be so. We have had commissions, and I know not
 what, about converting this place into a harbour of refuge. A harbour of
 refuge would be a great blessing, but not all the Goyernment commissions in
 the world could keep the sand out, or make the harbour deep enough to swim a
 frigate, unless the parsons can find out the way to take up the merry-maid's
 curse."</p>
 <p>Another tale refers the choking up of this harbour to the bad
 spirit Tregeagle. --</p>
