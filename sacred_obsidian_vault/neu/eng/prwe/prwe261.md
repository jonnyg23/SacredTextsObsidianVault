 <p align="CENTER">A TEST OF INNOCENCY</p>
 <p>
  A FARMER in Towednack having been robbed of some property of
 no great value, was resolved nevertheless, to employ a test which he had
 heard the "old people" resorted to for the purpose of catching the thief.
 He invited all his neighbours into his cottage, and when they were
 assembled, he placed a cock under the "brandice," (an iron vessel formerly
 much employed by the peasantry in baking, when this process was carried
 out on the hearth, the fuel being furze and ferns). Every one was directed
 to touch the brandice with his, or her, third finger, and say, "In the
 name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, speak." Every one did as they
 were directed, and no sound came from beneath the brandice. The last
 person was a woman, who occasionally laboured for the farmer in his
 fields. She hung back, hoping to pass unobserved amidst the crowd. But her
 very anxiety made her a suspected person. She was forced forward, and most
 unwillingly she touched the brandice, when, before she could utter the
 words prescribed, the cock crew. The woman fell faint on the floor, and,
 when she recovered, she confessed herself to be the thief, restored the
 stolen property, and became, it is said, "a changed character from that
 day."</p>
