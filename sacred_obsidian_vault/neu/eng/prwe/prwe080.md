 PIPER'S HOLE, SCILLY</p>
 <p><br>
 ON the banks of Peninnis, in St Mary's, is
 Piper's Hole, which communicates, as tradition saith, with the island of
 Tresco, where another orifice known by the same name is seen. Going in at the
 orifice at Peninnis Banks in St Mary's, it is above man's height, and of as
 much space in its breadth, but grows lower and narrower farther in a little
 beyond which entrance appear rocky basins, or reservoirs, continually running
 over with fresh water, descending as it distils from the sides of the rocky
 passage. By the fall of water heard further in, it is probable there may be
 rocky descents in the passage. The drippings from the sides have worn the
 passage, as far as it can be seen, into very various angular surfaces. Strange
 stories are related of this passage, of men going so far in that they never
 returned; of dogs going quite through, and coming out at Tresco, with most of
 their hair off; and such like incredibles. But its retired situation, where
 lovers retreat to indulge their mutual passion-, has made it almost as famous
 as the cave wherein Dido and Aeneas met of old. Its water is exceeding good.

 [ a] Heath's "Scilly Isles." These stories of Piper's Hole are still
 told, and many of the ignorant
 inhabitants regard it with superstitious dread. The Fugoe Hole, at the Land's
 End, has yet to be spoken of in the Witch stories. Several who have
 attempted to penetrate this hole have escaped only by great luck --" by the skin
 of their teeth," as the saving is.</p>
