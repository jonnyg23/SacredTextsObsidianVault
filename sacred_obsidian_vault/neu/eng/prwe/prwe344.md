 <p align="CENTER">AMBROSIAE PETRAE</p>
 <p>IN connection with the Bambury stone in Worcestershire,
 Mr. Jabez Allies remarks, and Dr. Nash is of the same opinion, that it was
 in all probability originally <i>Ambury</i>. He then gives us several
 examples of the occurrence of this name--as Ambreforde in Yorkshire,
 Ambrelie in Sussex, Ambresberie in Wilts, Ambresdone in Oxfordshire, and
 many others. [a]</p>
 <p>"The ancients distinguished stones, erected with a
 religious view, by the name of amber, by which was signified anything solar
 and divine. [b]</p>
 <p>"Respecting the Phoenicians being the founders of the
 Druidical discipline in Britain, one fact weighs more with me than a
 thousand arguments. I allude to the Tyrian coin, on which appear the tree,
 the sacred fire, the two stone pillars of Hercules (Thoth), and the singular
 legend, Tyr. Col. (Colony of Tvrians), and the still more remarkable words
 under the erect stones, AMBPOΣIE IIETPE (Ambrosiae Petrae), the anointed
 rocks. Let the reader remember the monkish traditions of Ambrosius, the
 exact likeness of these pillars on this coin to the stones at Stonehenge,
 the Ambrosiae Petrae; and if he does not think the origin of Ambrosbury, or
 Amesbury, was derived from the Ambrosiae Petrae, or anointed rocks of the
 Tyrian colonists, he will think the coincidence most remarkable." [c]</p>
 <p>"<i>Main Ambrosiae petrae</i> <i>ambrosiae</i>, signify
 the stones anointed with holy oil, consecrated; or, in a general sense, a
 temple, altar, or place of worship." [d]</p>
