 <p align="CENTER">THE CRICK STONE IN MORVA.</p>
 <p><br>
  </p>
 <p>IF any one suffering from a "crick in the back" can pass
 through this forked rock, on the borders of Zennor and Morva, without touching
 the stone, he is certain of being cured. This is but a substitute for the
 holed stone, which, it is admitted, has much more virtue than the forked
 stone.</p>
 <p>In various parts of the county there are, amongst the
 granitic masses, rocks which have fallen across each other, leaving small
 openings, or there are holes, low and narrow, extending under a pile of rocks.
 In nearly every case of this kind, we find it is popularly stated, that any
 one suffering from rheumatism or lumbago would be cured if he crawled through
 the openings. In some cases, nine times are insisted on "to make the charm
 complete."</p>
 <p>Mrs Bray, in her "Traditions of Devonshire," gives several
 examples of the prevalence of this superstition over the granitic district of
 Dartmoor. [a]</p>
 <p>[a] "Creeping under tolmens for the cure of diseases is
 still practised in Ireland, and also in the East, as is shown by Mrs Colonel
 Elwood In her Trayels."--Gentlemen's Magazine, July 1831.</p>
