 MINERS' SUPERSTITIONS</h3>
 <h3>MINERS say they
 often see little imps or demons underground. Their presence is considered
 favourable; they indicate the presence of lodes, about which they work
 during the absence of the miners. A miner told my informant that he had
 often seen them, sitting on pieces of timber, or tumbling about in curious
 attitudes, when he came to work.</h3>
 <h3>Miners do not like
 the form of the cross being made underground. A friend of my informant,
 going through some "levels" or "adits," made a + by the side of one, to know
 his way back, as he would have to return by himself.   He was compelled to
 alter it into another form.</h3>
 <h3>If miners see a
 snail when going to "bal" in the morning, they always drop a piece of tallow
 from their candles by its side.</h3>
