 <p align="CENTER">LIGHTS SEEN BY THE CONVERTED.</p>
 <p>
  THERE is, in many parts of the county, a belief, derived no
 doubt from the recollection of St Paul's conversion, that, when sinners
 are converted, they see shining lights about themselves. I have many times
 heard this, but every one seems to have his own particular mode of
 describing the phenomenon,--where they can be prevailed on to describe it
 at all,--and usually that is derived from some picture which has made an
 impression on their minds such as, "exactly like the light shining round
 the angel appearing to St Peter, in fayther's Bible."</p>
