 <p align="CENTER">PILCHARDS CRYING FOR MORE</p>
 <p>WHEN there is a large catch of fish (pilchards), they are
 preserved,--put in bulk, as the phrase is,--by being rubbed with salt, and
 placed in regular order, one on the other, head and tails alternately,
 forming regular walls of fish.</p>
 <p>The fish often, when so placed, make a squeaking noise; this
 is called "crying for more," and is regarded as a most favourable sign. More
 fish may soon be expected to be brought to the same cellar.</p>
 <p>The noise which is heard is really produced by the bursting
 of the air-bladders; and when many break together, which, when hundreds of
 thousands are piled in a mass, is not unusual, the sound is a loud one.</p>
