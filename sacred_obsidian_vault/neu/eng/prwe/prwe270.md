 <p align="CENTER">CELTS--FLINT ARROW-HEADS, ETC.</p>
 <p>
  THE common people believe these to be produced by thunder,
 and thrown down from the clouds, and that they show what weather will
 ensue by changing their colour.</p>
 <p>I have also found a belief prevailing in many districts,
 that Celts impart a virtue to water in which they have been soaked, and
 that diseases have been cured by drinking it.</p>
