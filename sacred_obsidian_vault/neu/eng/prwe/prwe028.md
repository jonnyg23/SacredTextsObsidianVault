 <p align="CENTER">THE NIGHT-RIDERS.</p>
 <p>I WAS on a visit when a boy at a farmhouse situated near Fowey
 river. Well do I remember the farmer with much sorrow telling us one morning
 at breakfast, that "the piskie people had been riding Tom again;" and this he
 regarded as certainly leading to the destruction of a fine young horse. I was
 taken to the stable to see the horse. There could be no doubt that the animal
 was much distressed, and refused to eat his food. The mane was said to be
 knotted into fairy stirrups; and Mr--told me that he had no doubt at least
 twenty small people had sat upon the horse's neck. He even assured me that one
 of his men had seen them urging the horse to his utmost speed round and round
 one of his fields.</p>
