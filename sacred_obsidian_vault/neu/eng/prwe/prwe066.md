 <p align="CENTER">THE LOGAN OR LOGING ROCK. [a]</p>
 <p>MODRED, in Mason's" Caractacus," addressing Vellinus and
 Elidurus, says--</p>
 <p>"Thither, youths,<br>
 Turn your astonish'd eyes; behold yon huge<br>
 And unhewn sphere of living adamant,<br>
 Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight<br>
 On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems,<br>
 Such is the strange and virtuous property,<br>
 It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch<br>
 Of him whose breath is pure; but to a traitor,<br>
 Though even a giant's prowess nerved his arm,<br>
 It stands as fixed as Snowdon."</p>
 <p>This faithfully preserves the traditionary idea of the
 purposes to which this in every way remarkable rock was devoted.</p>
 <p>Up to the time when Lieutenant Goldsmith, on the 8th of
 April 1824, slid the rock off from its support, to prove the falsehood of Dr
 Borlase's statement, that "it is morally impossible that any lever, or,
 indeed, force, however applied in a mechanical way, can remove it from its
 present position," the Logan Rock was believed to cure children, who were
 rocked upon it at certain seasons, of several diseases; but the charm is
 broken, although the rock is restored. [b]</p>
 <p>[a] "It may be observed that I have
 always used the words Loging Rock for the celebrated stone at Trereen Dinas.
 Much learned research seems to have been idly expended on the supposed name,
 'Logan Rock.' To log is a verb in general use throughout Cornwall for vibrating
 or rolling like a drunken man; and <i>an</i> is frequently heard in provincial
 pronunciation for tug, characteristic of the modem present participle. The
 Loging Rock is, therefore, strictly descriptive of its peculiar motlon." --
 Davies Gilbert.</p>
 <p>[b] When this great natural curiosity
 was, as it was thought, destroyed, the public wrath was excited, and appeased
 only' by the conciliatory spirit manifested by Mr Davies Gilbert, who persuaded
 the Lords of the Admiralty to lend Lieutenant Goldsmith the required apparatus
 for replacing it. Mr D. Gilbert found the money; and after making the necessary
 arrangements, on the ad of November 1824, Goldsmith "had the glory of replacing
 this immense rock in its natural position." The glory of Goldsmith and of
 Shrubsall, who overturned another large Logan Rock, is certainly one not to be
 desired.</p>
