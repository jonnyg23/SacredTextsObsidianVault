 <p align="CENTER">HOW TO EAT PILCHARDS.</p>
 <p>IT is unlucky to commence eating pilchards, or, indeed, any
 kind I of fish, from the head downwards. I have often heard persons rebuked
 for committing such a grievous sin, which is "sure to turn the heads of the
 fish away from the coasts."</p>
 <p>The legitimate process--mark this, all fish-eaters--is <i>
 to eat the fish from the tail towards the head. </i>This brings the fish to
 our shores, and secures good luck to the fishermen.</p>
