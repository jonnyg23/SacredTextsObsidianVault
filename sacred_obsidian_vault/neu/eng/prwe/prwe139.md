 <p align="CENTER">ST NEOT AND THE FISHES.</p>
 <p>
  On one occasion, when the saint
 was at his devotions, an angel appeared unto him, and showing him three fishes
 in the well, he said, "These are for thee; take one each day for thy daily
 food, and the number shall never grow less: the choice of one of three fishes
 shall be thine all the days of thy life." Long time passed by, and daily a
 fish was taken from the well, and three awaited his coming every morning. At
 length the saint, who shared in human suffering, notwithstanding his piety,
 fell ill; and being confined to his bed, St Neot sent his servant Barius to
 fetch him a fish for his dinner. Barius, being desirous of pleasing, if
 possible, the sick man's taste, went to the well and caught two fishes. One of
 these he broiled, and the other he boiled. Nicely cooked, Barius took them on
 a dish to his master's bedside, who started up alarmed for the consequences of
 the act of his servant, in disobedience to the injunctions of the angel. So
 good a man could not allow wrath to get the mastery of him; so he sat up in
 his bed, and, instead of eating, he prayed with great earnestness -over the
 cooked fish. At last the spirit of holiness exerted its full power; St Neot
 commanded Barius to return at once and cast' the fish into the well. Barius
 went and did as his master had told him to do; and, lo, the moment the fishes
 fell into the water they recovered life, and swam away with the third fish, as
 if nothing had happened to them.</p>
 <p>All these things, and more, are recorded in the windows of St
 Neot's Church. [a]</p>
