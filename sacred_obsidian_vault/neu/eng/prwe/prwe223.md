 <p align="CENTER">MAY-DAY</p>
 <p>THE first of May is inaugurated with much uproar. As soon
 as the clock has told of midnight, a loud blast on tin trumpets proclaims
 the advent of May. This is long continued. At daybreak, with their
 "tintarrems," they proceed to the country, and strip the sycamore-trees
 (called May-trees) of all their young branches, to make whistles. With these
 shrill musical instruments they return home. Young men and women devote
 May-day to junketing and picnics.</p>
 <p>It was a custom at Penzance, and probably at many other
 Cornish towns, when the author was a boy, for a number of young people to
 sit up until twelve o'clock, and then to march round the town with violins
 and fifes, and summon their friends to the Maying.</p>
 <p>When all were gathered, they went into the country, and
 were welcomed at the farmhouses at which they called, with some refreshment
 in the shape of rum and milk, junket, or something of that sort.</p>
 <p>They then gathered the "May," which included the young
 branches of any tree in blossom or fresh leaf. The branches of the sycamore
 were especially cut for the purpose of making the "May-music." This was done
 by cutting a circle through the bark to the wood a few inches from the end
 of the branch. The, bark was wetted and carefully beaten until it was
 loosened and could be slid off from the wood. The wood was cut angularly at
 the end, so as to form a mouth-piece, and a slit was made in both the bark
 and the wood, so that when the bark was replaced a whistle was formed.
 Prepared with a sufficient number of May whistles, all the party returned to
 the town, the band playing, whistles blowing, and the young people singing
 some appropriate song.</p>
