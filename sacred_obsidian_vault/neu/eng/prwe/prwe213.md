 <p align="CENTER">WHIPPING THE HAKE.</p>
 <p>IT is not improbable that the saying applied to the
 people of one of the Cornish fishing-towns, of" Who whipped the hake ?" may
 be explained by the following <i>:--</i></p>
 
 <p>"Lastly, they are persecuted by the hakes, who (not long
 silence) haunted the coast in great abundance; but now being deprived of
 their wonted bait, are much diminished, verifying the proverb, <i>'What we
 lose in hake we shall have in herring'." - Carew, Survey, </i>p. 34.</p>
 <p>Annoyed with the hakes, the seiners may, in their
 ignorance have actually served one of those fish as indicated.</p>
