 <p align="CENTER">TO CHARM A SNAKE.</p>
 <p>
  WHEN an adder or snake is seen a circle is to be rapidly
 drawn around it, and the sign of the cross made within it, while the two
 first verses of the 68th Psalm are repeated :-- "Let God arise, let his
 enemies be scattered; let them also that hate him flee before him.</p>
 <p>"As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax
 melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God."</p>
 <p>When a child, I well remember being shown a snake, not yet
 dead, within a circle of this kind; the gardener who drew my attention to
 the reptile informing me that he had charmed it in the manner related.</p>
