 <p align="CENTER">THE FAIRY FAIR IN GERMOE.</p>
 <p><br>
 BAL LANE in Germoe was a notorious place for piskies. One night Daniel
 Champion and his comrade came to Godolphin Bridge,--they were a little bit
 "overtook" with liquor. They said that when they came to "Bal Lane," they
 found it covered all over from end to end, and the Small People holding a fair
 there with all sorts of merchandise--the prettiest sight they ever met with.
 Champion was sure he saw his child there; for a few nights before, his child
 in the evening was as beautiful a one as could be seen anywhere, but in the
 morning was changed for one as ugly and wizened as could be; and he was sure
 the Small People had done it. Next day, telling the story at Croft Gothal, his
 comrade was knocked backward, thrown into the bob-pit, and just killed.
 Obliged to be carried to his home, Champion followed, and was telling of their
 adventure with the Small People, when one said, "Don't speak about them; they
 're wicked, spiteful devils." No sooner were the words uttered than the
 speaker was thrown clean over stairs and bruised dreadfully,--a convincing
 proof to all present of the reality of the existence of the Small Folks.</p>
