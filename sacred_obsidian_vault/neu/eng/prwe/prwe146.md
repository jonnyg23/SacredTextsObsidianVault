 <p align="CENTER">GULVAL WELL.</p>
 <p>YOUNG woman, with a child in her arms, stands by the side of
 Gulval Well, in Fosses Moor. There is an expression of extreme anxiety in her
 interesting face, which exhibits a considerable amount of intelligence. She
 appears to doubt, and yet be disposed to believe in, the virtues of this
 remarkable well. She pauses, looks at her babe, and sighs. She is longing to
 know something of the absent, but she fears the well may indicate the extreme
 of human sorrow. While she is hesitating, an old woman advances towards her,
 upon whom the weight of eighty years was pressing, but not over-heavily; and
 she at once asked the young mother if she wished to ask the well after the
 health of her husband.</p>
 <p>"Yes, Aunt Alcie," she replied; "I ant so anxious. I have
 not heard of John for six long months. I could not sleep last night, so I rose
 with the light, and came here, determined to ask the well; but I am afraid. O
 Aunt Alcie, suppose the well should not speak, I should die on the spot !"</p>
 <p>"Nonsense, cheeld," said the old woman; "thy man is well
 enough; and the well will boil, if thee 'It ask it in a proper spirit."</p>
 <p>"But, Aunt Alcie, if it sends up puddled water, or if it
 remains quiet, what would become of me ?"</p>
 <p>"Never be foreboding, cheeld; troubles come quick without
 running to meet 'em. Take my word for it, the fayther of thy little un will
 soon be home again. Ask the well ! ask the well !"</p>
 <p>"Has it told any death or sickness lately ?" asked the
 young mother.</p>
 <p>"On St Peter's eve Mary Curnew questioned the water about
 poor Willy."</p>
 <p>"And the water never moved ?"</p>
 <p>"The well was quiet; and verily I guess it was about that
 time he died."</p>
 <p>"Any sickness, Aunt Alcie ?"</p>
 <p>"Jenny Kelinach was told, by a burst of mud, how ill her
 old mother was; but do not be feared, all is well with Johnny Thomas."</p>
 <p>Still the woman hesitated; desire, fear, hope, doubt,
 superstition, and intelligence struggled within her heart and brain.</p>
 <p>The old creature, who was a sort of guardian to the well,
 used all her rude eloquence to persuade Jane Thomas to put her question, and
 at length she consented. Obeying the old woman's directions, she knelt on the
 mat of bright green grass which grew around, and leaning over the well so as
 to see her face in the water, she repeated after her instructor,</p>
 <p>"Water, water, tell me truly, <br>
 Is the man I love duly<br>
 On the earth, or under the sod, <br>
 Sick or well,--in the name of God ?"</p>
 <p>Some minutes passed in perfect silence, and anxiety was
 rapidly turning cheeks and lips pale, when the colour rapidly returned.</p>
 <p>There was a gush of clear water from below, bubble rapidly
 followed bubble, sparkling brightly in the morning sunshine. Full of joy, the
 young mother rose from her knees, kissed her child, and exclaimed, "I am happy
 now ! " [a]</p>
 <p>[a] Hals, speaking of Gelval well, thus describes it and
 its virtues :-- In Fosses Moor part of this manor of Lanesly, its this parish,
 is that well-known fountain called Gulval Well. To which place great numbers
 of people, time out of mind, have resorted for pleasure and profit of their
 health, as the credulous country people do in these days, not only to drink
 the waters thereof, but to inquire after the life or death of their absent
 friends; where, being arrived, they demanded the question at the well whether
 such a person by name be living, in health, sick, or dead. If the party be
 living and in health, the still quiet water of the well-pit, as soon as the
 question is demanded, will instantly bubble or bon up as a pot, clear
 crystalline water; if sick, foul and puddled waters; if the party be dead, it
 will neither bubble, boil up, nor alter ita colour or still motion. However, I
 can speak nothing of the truth of those supernatural facts from my own sight
 or experience, but write from the mouths of those who told me they had seen
 and proved the veracity thereof. Finally, it is a strong and courageous
 fountain of water, kept neat and clean by an old woman of the vicinity, to
 accommodate strangers, for her own advantage, by blazing the virtues and
 divine qualities of those waters."--,Hals, <i>quoted by Gibert, Parochial
 History of Cornwall, </i>vol. ii. p. 121.</p>
