 <p align="CENTER">ROCK MASSES, CELTIC</p>
 <i>
 </i>
 <p>"THE Celts, or Keλτοί, or Keλταί were a people of the origin
 of which nothing positive is known. They occupied a great part of Western Europe
 perhaps in times antecedent to the invasion of Indo-Germanic nations.</p>
 <p>"The very name <i>Celt</i> is of uncertain etymology. Ammian
 derives it from the king, <i>Kelta</i>, or <i>Celta</i>; Leibnitz, from the
 German <i>gelt</i>, or <i>geld,</i> money; Mezerai, from the British <i>gall</i>,
 or <i>gault</i>, a forest; Pellontier, from the Tudesk <i>wallen</i>, to wander;
 Latour d'Auvergne, from <i>gael</i>, or <i>gall</i>, yellow, alluding to the
 light hair of the Galli, whom Bochart identtfies with <i>Dodanim</i> (for
 Rhodanim) of Gen. x. [a[</p>
 <p>"But the name of Cell may probably come, as Camden says, from
 <i>gwalth</i>, a head of hair; <i>coma</i>, and <i>gwalthay</i>, <i>comatus</i>;
 from whence Keλταί. Γαλταί, or Γαλτοί,
 <i>Galli</i> or <i>Gauls</i>, the <i>Gaedil</i>, <i>Caedil</i>, or Keile, and in pl.
 <i>Keilt</i>, or <i>Keiltiet</i>,
 or <i>Gaels</i>, <i>Gaedels</i>, or <i>Guidhelod</i>, as the Irish call
 themselves and their tongue.</p>
 <p>"The language called Celtic is divided into two principal
 branches--viz., 1. The Irish or Hibernian, from which the present <i>Irish</i>,
 or <i>Erse</i>, and the Gaelic of Scotland are derived. 2. The <i>British</i>,
 to which the primitive Gaellic or Gallic are allied, and from which are derived
 the <i>Welsh</i>, the <i>Cornish</i>, and the <i>Armoric</i>, or language of
 Brittany." [b]</p>
 <p>"The Welsh, which is the relic of the language of the inland
 Britons, or Caesar's aborigines, is most probably akin to the dialect of <i>Gallia Celtica</i>, and the Cornish to the idiom of the Belgae, who overran the
 southern district of England, and probably sought refuge in the west when the
 Saxons were extending themselves from the eastern part of the island." [c]</p>
 <p>But surely there are indications of a people inhabiting
 Cornwall long before the Saxons gained a foot of ground in England?</p>
