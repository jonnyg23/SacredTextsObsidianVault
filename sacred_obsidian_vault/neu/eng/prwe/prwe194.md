 THE GHOST ON HORSEBACK.</h3>
 <h3>BILLY--and John --,
 working at Wheal Vor, were in the habit, early in the morning, of calling
 out a dog or two, kept by the occupier of an adjoining farm, and with them
 hunt over the Godolphin warren adjoining. One morning, while thus en­gaged,
 one of them gave the alarm that a man on horseback was coming down the road.
 "'Tisn't possible," said the other; "no horse can ever come over that road."
 "There is a horse, and old Cap'n  T. is upon it," replied the first. "Hold
 thy tongue," rejoined his comrade; "he 's dead months ago." "I know that;
 but 'tis he, sure enough." Both crouched down behind a bush; and my
 informant, whose father was one of the parties, declared that the appearance
 of Capt. T., on a black horse, passed noiselessly down the road immediately
 before them, but without noticing their presence.</h3>
