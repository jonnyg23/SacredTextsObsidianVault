 <p align="CENTER">THE HAG'S BED NEAR FERMOY.</p>
 <p>"NEAR Fermoy is a very peculiar variety of these early
 structures, being en oblong building constructed with large blocks of
 limestone of the locality. It contains an internal chamber, from twenty to
 thirty feet long, five feet wide, and at the present time about four feet
 high; the side walls are near five feet thick, constructed with two rows of
 upright stones on edge, and the interior is filled with smaller stones,
 forming a wall; the front has only a row of thin upright stones, but fitting
 nearly close together; the covering stones rest on rude horizontal stones,
 which are placed on the wall before described, and which would appear to
 have been of insufficient height, and on those are three large covering
 stones, one of which is about eighteen feet long." [a]</p>
