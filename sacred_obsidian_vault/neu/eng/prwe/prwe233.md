 <p align="CENTER">GEESE-DANCING--PLOUGH MONDAY.</p>
 <p>THE first Monday after Twelfth-day is Plough Monday, and it
 is the ploughman's holiday.</p>
 <p>At this season, in the Islands of Scilly, at St Ives,
 Penzance, and other places, the young people exercise a sort of gallantry
 called "geese-dancing." The maidens are dressed up for young men, and the
 young men for maidens; and, thus disguised, they visit their neighbours in
 companies, where they dance, and make jokes upon what has happened during
 the year, and every one is humorously "told their own," without offence
 being taken. By this sort of sport, according to yearly custom and
 toleration, there is a spirit of wit and drollery kept up among the people.
 The music and dancing done, they are treated with liquor, and then they go
 to the next house, and carry on the same sport. A correspondent, writing to
 the "Table-Book," insists on calling these revels "goose-dancing." The true
 Cornishman never uses the term, which is, as I have elsewhere shown, derived
 from <i>dance deguiser,--hence </i>guise-dancing, or geese-dancing, by
 corruption.</p>
