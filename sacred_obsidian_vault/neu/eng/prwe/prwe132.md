 <p align="CENTER">HOW ST PIRAN REACHED CORNWALL.</p>
 <p>GOOD men are frequently persecuted by those whom they
 have benefited the most. The righteous Piran had, by virtue of his sanctity,
 been enabled to feed ten Irish kings and their armies for ten days together
 with three cows. He brought to life by his prayers the dogs which had been
 killed while hunting the elk and the boar, and eyen restored to existence
 many of the warriors who had fallen on the battle-field. Notwithstanding
 this, and his incomparable goodness, some of these kings condemned him to be
 cast off a precipice into the sea, with a millstone around his neck.</p>
 <p>On a boisterous day, a crowd of the lawless Irish
 assembled on the brow of a beetling cliff, with Piran in chains. By great
 labour they had rolled a huge millstone to the top of the hill, and Piran
 was chained to it. At a signal from one of the kings, the stone and the
 saint were rolled-to the edge of and suddenly over, the cliff intd the
 Atlantic. The winds were blowing tempestuously, the heavens were dark with
 clouds, and the waves white with crested foam. No sooner was Piran and the
 millstone launched into space, than the sun shone out brightly, casting the
 full lustre of its beams on the holy man, who sat tranquilly on the
 descending stone. The winds died away, and th~ waves became smooth as a
 mirror. The moment the millstone touched the water, hundreds were converted
 to Christianity who saw this miracle. St Piran floated on safely to
 Cornwall; he landed on the 5th of March on the sands which bear his name. He
 lived amongst the Cornish men until he attained the age of 206 years. [a]</p>
