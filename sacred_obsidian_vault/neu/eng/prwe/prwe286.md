 <p align="CENTER">ITCHING EARS</p>
 <p>
  WHEN the ears are red and itch, it is a sign that some one
 is talking of the suffering individual. If it is the left ear, they are
 being scandalised; if the right ear, they are being praised.</p>
 <p>Often have I heard, when the lower and middle class people
 have been indulging in some gossip of their neighbours or friends, "I 'II
 bet how their ears do itch."</p>
