 <p align="CENTER">THE LIMP CORPSE.</p>
 <p>IF a corpse stiffens shortly after death, all is thought to
 proceed naturally; but if the limbs remain flexible, some one of the family is
 shortly to follow. If the eyes of a corpse are difficult to close, it is said
 "they are looking after a follower."</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>To find a louse on one's linen, is a sign of sickness. To
 find. two, indicates a severe illness. If three lice are so found within a
 month, it is a "token to prepare."</p>
 <p>Talking backwards, or putting one word incorrectly before
 another,--"the cart before the horse,"--is considered to foretell that you
 will shortly see a stranger.</p>
 <p>If two young people, in conversation, happen to think of the
 same thing at the same time, and one of them utters the thought before the
 other, that one is certain to be married first.</p>
