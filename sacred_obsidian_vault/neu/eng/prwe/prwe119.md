 <p align="CENTER">THE LUGGER OF CROFT PASCO POOL</p>
 <p>IN the midst of the dreary waste of Gornhilly, which
 occupies a large portion of the Lizard promontory, is a large piece of water
 known as "Croft Pasco Pool," where it is said at night the form of a ghostly
 vessel may be seen floating with lug-sails spread. A more dreary, weird spot
 could hardly be selected for a witches' meeting; and the Lizard folks were
 always--a fact--careful to be back before dark, preferring to suffer
 inconvenience, to risking a sight of the ghostly lugger. Unbelieving people
 attributed the origin of the tradition to a white horse seen in a dim
 twilight standing in the shallow water; but this was indignantly rejected by
 the mass of the residents.</p>
