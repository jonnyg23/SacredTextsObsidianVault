 <p align="CENTER">THE MERMAID OF SEATON.</p>
 <p>NEAR Looe,--that is, between Down Derry and Looe,--there is
 a little sand-beach called "Seaton."</p>
 <p>Tradition tells us that here once stood a goodly commercial
 town bearing this name, and that when it was in its pride, Plymouth was but a
 small fishing-village.</p>
 <p>The town of Seaton is said to have been overwhelmed with sand
 at an early period, the catastrophe having been brought about,--as in the
 case of the filling up of Padstow harbour,--by the curse of a mermaid, who
 had suffered some injury from the sailors who belonged to this port. Beyond
 this I have been unable to glean any story worth preserving.</p>
