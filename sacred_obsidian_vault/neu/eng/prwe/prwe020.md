 <p align="CENTER">THE HACK AND CAST.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN the parish of Goran is an intrenchment running from cliff to cliff, and
 cutting off about a hundred acres of coarse ground. This is about twenty feet
 broad, and twenty-four feet high in most places.</p>
 <p>Marvellous as it may appear, tradition assures us that this
 was the work of a giant, and that he performed the task in a single night.
 This fortification has long been known as <i>Thica Vosa</i>, and the Hack and
 Cast.</p>
 <p>The giant, who lived on the promontory, was the terror of
 the neighbourhood, and great were the rejoicings in Goran when his death was
 accomplished through a stratagem by a neighbouring doctor.</p>
 <p>The giant fell ill through eating some food--children or
 otherwise--to satisfy his voracity, which had disturbed his stomach. His
 roars and groans were heard for miles, and great was the terror throughout the
 neighbourhood. A messenger, however, soon arrived at the residence of the
 doctor of the parish, and he bravely resolved to obey the summons of the
 giant, and visit him. He found the giant rolling on the ground with pain, and
 he at once determined to rid the world, if possible, of the monster.</p>
 <p>He told him that he must be bled. The giant submitted, and
 the doctor moreover said that, to insure relief, a large hole in the cliff
 must be filled with the blood. The giant lay on the ground, his arm extended
 over the hole, and the blood flowing a torrent into it. Relieved by the loss
 of blood, he permitted the stream to flow on, until he at last became so weak,
 that the doctor kicked him over the cliff, and killed him. The well-known
 promontory of The Dead Man, or Dodman, is so called from the dead giant. The
 spot on which he fell is the "Giant's House," and the hole has ever since been
 most favourable to the growth of ivy.</p>
