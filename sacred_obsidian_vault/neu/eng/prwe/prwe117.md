 <p align="CENTER">A FLYING SPIRIT.</p>
 <p>ABOUT the year 1761 a pinnacle was thrown down, by
 lightning, from the tower of the church at Ludgvan. The effect was then
 universally imputed to the vengeance of a perturbed spirit, exorcised from
 Treassow, and passing eastward, towards the usual place of banishment --THE
 RED SEA.</p>
 <p>The following story is given as a remarkable example of
 the manner in which very recent events become connected with exceedingly old
 superstitious ideas. The tales of Tregeagle have shown us how the name of a
 man who lived about two centuries since is made to do duty as a demon
 belonging to the pagan times. In this story we have the name of a woman who
 lived about the commencement of the present century, associated with a
 legend belonging to the earliest ages.</p>
