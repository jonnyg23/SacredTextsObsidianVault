 <p align="CENTER">THE MIGRATORY BIRDS.</p>
 <p>
  I FIND a belief still prevalent amongst the people in the
 outI lying districts of Cornwall, that such birds as the cuckoo and the
 swallow remain through the winter in deep caves, cracks in the earth, and
 in hollow trees; and instances have been cited of these birds having been
 found in a torpid state in the mines, and in hollow pieces of wood. This
 belief appears to be of some antiquity, for Carew writes in his "Survey of
 Cornwall" as follows :-- </p>
 <p>"In the west parts of Cornwall, during the winter season,
 swallows are</p>
 <p>found sitting in old deep tynne-works, and holes in the
 sea cliffes; but touching their lurking-places, <i>Olaus .Msgnus</i>
 maketh a far stranger report. For he saith that in the north parts of the
 world, as summer weareth out, they clap mouth to mouth, wing to wing, and
 legge to legge, and so, after a sweet singing, fall downe into certain
 lakes or pools amongst the caves, from whence at the next spring they
 receive a new resurrection; and he addeth, for proofe thereof, that the
 fishermen who make holes in the ice, to dig up such fish in their nets as
 resort thither for breathing, doe sometimes light on these swallows
 conge..lled in clods, of a slymie substance, and that, carrying them home
 to their stoves, the warmth restored them to life and flight."</p>
 <p>A man employed in the granite quarries near Penryn,
 informed me that he found such a " slymie substance" in one of the pools
 in the quarry where he was working, that he took it home, warmth proved it
 to be a bird, but when it began to move it was seized by the cat, who ran
 out on the downs and devoured it.</p>
