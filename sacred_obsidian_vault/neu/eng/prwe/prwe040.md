 <p align="CENTER">THE FAIRY REVEL.</p>
 <p><br>
 RICHARD also once witnessed a fairy revel in the Towen--upon which tables
 were spread, with the utmost profusion of gold and silver ornaments, and
 fruits and flowers. Richard however, according to the statement of " Aunt
 Alcey" (the name by which his wife was familiarly called), very foolishly
 interrupted the feast by some exclamation of surprise; whereas, had he but
 touched the end of a table with his finger, it would have been impossible for
 the fairy host to have removed an article, as that which has been touched by
 mortal fingers becomes to them accursed. As it was, the lovely vision faded
 before the eyes of the astonished labourer.</p>
