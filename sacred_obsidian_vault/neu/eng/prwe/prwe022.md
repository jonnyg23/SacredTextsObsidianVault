 ORDULF THE GIANT</p>
 <p><br>
 THIS <i>Tavistock</i> Sampson is far removed from our fine old legendary
 giant; yet we perceive in the stories of Ordulph precisely the same process as
 that which has given immortality to Blunderbuss and others. In the church of
 the monastery of Tavistock, built by Orgar in 960, and consecrated by St
 Rumon, was buried Orgar, and also his son Edulf or Ordulph, to whom, by some
 writers, the foundation of the abbey is attributed Ordulph was a man of giant
 size, and possessing most remarkable strength. He once appeared before the
 gates of the city of Exeter in company with King Edward, and demanded
 admission. His demand was not immediately complied with. He tore away the bars
 of the portcullis with his hands--burst open the gates with his foot--rent
 the locks and bolts asunder--and broke down a considerable portion of the
 wall--walking into the city over the ruins, and occasioning great alarm
 amidst the inhabitants.</p>
 <p>The king is said to have attributed this extraordinary feat
 of strength to the chieftain's having entered into a compact with the devil; 
 and the people generally believed the king to be correct.</p>
 <p>At Tavistock, it was the custom of Ordulph to stand with
 one foot on either side of the Tavy, which is about twenty feet wide, and
 having the wild beasts driven in from the Dartmoor forests, he would--with
 the seemingly insignificant blows of a small knife--strike their heads off
 into the stream. [a]</p>
 <p>[a] William of Malmesbury tells us
 that both father and son were buried at Tavistock, which is thus described -
 Est in Domnonia caenobium monachorum, juxta Tau fiuvium, quod Tavistock
 vocator; quod per Ordgarum, comitem Domnoniensem, patrem Elffilda, gui fuit
 uxor regis Edgari, surgendi exordium, per Livinguns episcopum, cresendi
 accepit auspicium locus, amaenus opportunitate nemorum, captura copiosa
 piscum, Ecclesiae congruente fabriea, fluvialibus rivis per officinas
 monachorum decurrentibus, qui suo impetu effusi, quidquid invenerint
 superfium, portant in exitum." Quoted by Pedler in his "Episcopate of
 Cornwall."</p>
 <p>Mrs Bray, in her "Traditions,
 Legends, Superstitions, and Sketches of Devonshire," says,--"But
 notwithstanding the superiority of his strength and stature, Ordulph died in
 the flower of his age. He gave orders to be buried at his abbey at Herton, in
 Dorsetshire; but was interred in or near the Abbey Church of Tavistock, where
 a mausoleum or tomb of vast dimensions was erected to his memory, which is
 represented to have been visited as a wonder. 'The thigh-bone of Ordulph is
 still preserved in Tavistock Church."</p>
