 <p align="CENTER">THE MURYANS' BANK [a]</p>
 <p><br>
 The ant is called by the peasantry a Muryan. Believing that they are the Small
 People in their state of decay from off the earth, it is deemed most unlucky
 to destroy a colony of ants. If you place a oiece of tin in a bank of Muryans
 at a certain age of the moon, it will be turned into silver.</p>
 <p>[a] <i>Murrian</i>, Welsh, "Crig-murrian,"
 the hill of ants.</p>
