 <p align="CENTER">PACKS OF WOOL THE FOUNDATION OF THE
 BRIDGE OF WADEBRIDGE</p>
 <p>LOVEBONE was the vicar of Wadebridge, and there
 was a ferry across the river. It was a frequent custom for the
 farmers to ride their horses and to drive their cattle across when
 the tide was low, and frequently men and beasts were lost in the
 quicksands formed on the rising of the tide. A sad accident of this
 kind happened, and Lovebone resolved on building a bridge; as Leland
 says in his " Itinerary," "Then one Lovebone, vicar of Wadebridge,
 moved with pitie, began the bridge, and with great paine and studie,
 good people putting their help thereto, finished it with xvii fair
 and great uniform arches of stone."</p>
 <p>Great was the labour, and frequent the
 disappointment. Pier after pier were built, and then they were lost in
 the sands. A "fair structure" was visible at night, in the morning
 there was no trace of the work of the masons. Lovebone almost
 despaired of success, indeed he was about to abandon the work, when he
 dreamed that an angel came with a flock of sheep, that he sheared
 them, let the wool fall into the water, and speedily built the bridge
 upon the wool.</p>
 <p>Lovebone awoke with a new idea. He gathered from
 the farmers around, all the wool they would give him, he put it
 loosely into packs, placed these thickly upon the sand, and built his
 piers. The work remains to this day in proof of the engineering skill
 of the suggesting angel. [a]</p>
 <p>Quoting Beaumont and Fletcher's "Knight of the
 Burning Pestle," we find the Citizen saying to the Prologue:</p>
 <p>"Why could you not be content as well as others,
 with the Legend of Whittington? or the Life and Death of Sir Thomas
 Gresham, with the building of the Royal Exchange? or the Story of
 Queen Eleanor, with the rearing of London Bridge upon woolsacks?"</p>
