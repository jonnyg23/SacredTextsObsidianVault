 THE LAST WOLF IN ENGLAND</p>
 <p align="CENTER">
 <b> </b>THE extirpation of the wolves, which once existed in every part of these
 islands, is an oft-told story.</p>
 <p>
  But it is not generally known
 that the last native wolf lived in the forests of Ludgvan, near
 Penzance. The last of his race was a gigantic specimen, and terrible was the
 havoc made by him on the flocks. Tradition tells us that at last he
 carried off a child. This could not be endured, so the peasantry all
 turned out, and this famous wolf was captured at Rospeith, the name of
 a farm still existing in Ludgvan.</p>
