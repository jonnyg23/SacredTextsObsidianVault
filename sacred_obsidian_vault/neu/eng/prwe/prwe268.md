 <p align="CENTER">THE MUTTON FEAST.</p>
 <p>
  AN old tradition--the particulars of which I have failed
 to recover--says that a flock of sheep were blown from the Gwithian Sands
 over into St Ives Bay, and that the St Ives fishermen caught them,--
 believing them to be a new variety of fish,--either in their nets, or
 with hook and line, and brought them ashore as their night's catch.</p>
 <p>I learn that Mr Fortescue Hitchins, some fifty or sixty
 years since, wrote a "copy of verses" on this tradition, but I have never
 seen this production.</p>
