 <p align="CENTER">PADSTOW HOBBY HORSE.</p>
 <p>MR. GEORGE RAWLINGS writes, September 1, 1865:-- Formerly
 all the respectable people kept the anniversary decorated with the choicest
 flowers, but some unlucky day a number of rough characters from a distance
 joined it, and committed some sad assaults on old and young--spoiling all
 their nice summer clothes, and covering their faces and persons with smut.
 From that time--fifty years since--the procession is formed of the lowest.</p>
 <p> The Maypole was once decorated with the best flowers--
 now, with only some elm branches and furze in blossom. The horse is formed
 as follows :-- The dress is made of sailcloth painted black--a fierce mask--
 eyes red--horse's head--horse-hair matte and tail distended by a hoop.
 Some would call it very frightful. Carried by a powerful man--they could
 inflict much mischief with the <i>snappers</i>, &amp;c. No doubt it is a remnant
 of the ancient days, and it represents the Devil, or the power of Darkness.
 They commence singing at sunrise. </p>
 <p align="CENTER">THE MORNING SONG</p>
 <p>Unite
 and unite and let us all unite,</p>
 <p>For
 summer it is come unto day;</p>
 <p>And
 whither we are going we all will unite</p>
 <p>In
 the merry morning of May.<br>
  </p>
 <p>Arise
 up, Mr. --, and joy you betide,</p>
 <p>For
 summer is come unto day;</p>
 <p>And
 bright is your bride that lays by your side</p>
 <p>In
 the merry morning of May.<br>
  </p>
 <p>Arise
 up, Mrs. --, and gold be your ring,</p>
 <p>For
 summer is come unto day;</p>
 <p>And
 give to us a cup of ale, the merrier we shall sing</p>
 <p>In
 the merry morning of May.<br>
  </p>
 <p>Arise
 up, Miss --, all in your smock of silk,</p>
 <p>For
 summer is come unto day;</p>
 <p>And
 all your body under as white as any milk,</p>
 <p>In
 the merry morning of May.<br>
  </p>
 <p>The
 young men of Padstow might, if they would, </p>
 <p>For
 summer is come unto day;</p>
 <p>They
 might have built a ship and gilded her with gold</p>
 <p>In
 the merry morning of May.<br>
  </p>
 <p>Now
 fare you well, and we bid you good cheer,</p>
 <p>For
 summer is come unto day;</p>
 <p>We
 will come no mote unto your house before another year, </p>
 <p>In
 the merry morning of May.</p>
 <p>
 THE DAY SONG</p>
 <p>Awake, St. George, our English knight,</p>
 <p>For
 summer is a' come O, and winter is ago;</p>
 <p>And
 every day God give us His grace</p>
 <p>By
 day and by night O!<br>
  </p>
 <p>Where is St. George, where is he O?</p>
 <p>He is out in his long boat all on the salt sea
 O!</p>
 <p>And
 in every land O! the land where'er we go,</p>
 <p>And for to fetch the summer home.
 </p>
 <p>The summer and the May O,
 </p>
 <p>For summer is a conic,
 </p>
 <p>And winter is a go.<br>
  </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>Where are the French dogs that make such boast O?</p>
 <p>They shall eat the grey goose feather,</p>
 <p>And
 we will cattle roast O !</p>
 <p>And in every land O ! the land where'er we go,</p>
 <p>The summer and the May O<br>
  </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>Thou
 mightst have shown thy knavish face!</p>
 <p>Thou mightst have tarried at home O !</p>
 <p>But
 thou shalt be an old cuckold,</p>
 <p>And
 thou shalt wear the horns O;</p>
 <p>The summer and the May
 O.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>ADDITIONAL CHORUS<br>
  </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>With
 hal-an-tow [a] and jolly rumble O,</p>
 <p>For summer is a come O, and winter is a go,</p>
 <p>And
 in every land O, the land where'er we go,</p>
 <p>Up
 flies the kite, and down falls the lark O !</p>
 <p>Aunt Ursula Birdhood she had an old ewe,</p>
 <p>And
 she died in her own park O !</p>
 <p>And for to fetch the summer home.</p>
