 III --THE MAYOR OF
 HALGAVER MOOR.</p>
 <p>
  The
 people of Bodmin had an old custom of assembling in large numbers on
 Halgaver Moor in the month of July, and electing a "Mayor of Misrule," for
 the punishment of petty offenders. Our old historian gives a quaint
 description. "The youthlyer sort of Bodmin townsmen use sometimes to sport
 themselves by playing the box with strangers, whom they summon to
 Halgaver; the name signifieth the Goats' Moore, and such a place it is,
 lying a little without the town, and very full of quagmires. When these
 mates meet with any raw serving-man or other young master, who may serve
 and deserve to make pastime, they cause him to be solemnly arrested for
 his appearance before the Mayor of Halgaver, where he is charged with
 wearing, one spur, or wanting a girdle, or some such like felony, and
 after he hath been arraigned and tried with all requisite circumstances,
 judgment is given in formal terms, and executed in some one ungracious
 prank or other, more to the scorn than hurt of the party condemned. Hence
 is sprung rise proverb, when we see one slovenly apparelled, to say, 'He
 shall be presented in Halgaver Court."</p>
