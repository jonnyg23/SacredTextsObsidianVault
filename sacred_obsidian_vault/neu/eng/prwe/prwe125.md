 THE SAINT'S PATH.</p>
 <p>
  The path along which St Leven was
 accustomed to walk from Bodellen, by Rospletha, on to St Leven's Rocks, as
 they are still called, may be yet seen; the grass grows greener wherever the
 good priest trod than in any other part of the fields through which the
 footpath passes.</p>
