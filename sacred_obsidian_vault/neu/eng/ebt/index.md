 This was the first book about ley lines.
 Ley lines are alignments on the
 landscape of natural and artificial features, some of which
 follow perfectly straight tracks for miles.
 First discovered in Britain by the author of this book, Alfred Watkins,
 a photographer and inventor, ley lines were pursued eagerly
 by organized clubs in the period between the world wars.
 Interest in leys died out after the 1930s, but was revived in the 1960s,
 after the publication of a popular book on the subject,
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/050027312X/internetsacredte">
 <cite>The View Over Atlantis</cite></a>, by John Michell.
 Latter-day ley-hunters took the concept much further than
 Watkins and the earlier enthusiasts.
 Dowsing, flying saucer paths, crop circles,
 biodynamic farming, and <i>feng shui</i> have
 all been associated with ley lines.
 Collections of ley lines have been said to conceal hidden messages,
 reveal the location of esoteric items, or contain star maps.
 The existence of ley lines is now one of the
 accepted tenets of New Age belief.
 This topic is collectively called 'Earth Mysteries'.
 However, they aren't just limited to this planet:
 leys have even supposedly been charted in the Cydonia region of Mars in the
 vicinity of the 'Face of Mars'.</p>
 <p>
 Watkins never attributed any supernatural significance to
 leys; he believed that they were simply pathways that had been
 used for trade or ceremonial purposes, very ancient in origin,
 possibly dating back to the Neolithic, certainly pre-Roman.
 His obsession with leys was a natural outgrowth
 of his interest in landscape photography
 and love of the British countryside.
 He was an intensely rational person with an active intellect, and
 I think he would be a bit disappointed with some of the fringe aspects
 of ley lines today.

 <p>
 Originally just the existence of ley lines was considered speculative
 by academic archeologists and topographers.
 Since Watkins, there have been similar alignments discovered in far-flung
 locations, including the Atacama desert of Chile,
 the Southwestern United States,
 and other places; all of these can be directly traced to human activity,
 and associated with ceremonial and astronomical activities.
 So this probably makes the concept of similar alignments
 by Neolithic Britons more acceptable to traditional academics, once
 all the mystical connotations are subtracted.

 Watkins wrote several other books on this topic, including 
 <cite>The Old Straight Track</cite> [1925], and
 <cite>The Ley Hunter's Manual</cite> [1927].
 These books go into much greater detail
 but essentially cover the same set of points in this, his first book on leys.
 All of Watkins' books are long out of print, although
 used copies can usually be obtained easily (if not cheaply).
