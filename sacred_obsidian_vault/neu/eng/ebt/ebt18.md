 <h3 align="CENTER">CASTLES.</h3>
 <p>Every castle in this district has a ley passing over it, and originated in a sighting tump, upon which the keep was afterwards built when some lord selected this as a desirable site for a defensive home. If a large tump, there were usually some excavations which were developed and extended into real defensive works.</p>
 <p>The word castle is applied to many tumps (as in Moccas Park), where no building has ever existed, and to farms (as Castle Farm, Madley), where there are signs of a tump, but merely a homestead round it.</p>
 <p>Where the word castle is part of a genuine place name, there was a sighting mound.</p>
