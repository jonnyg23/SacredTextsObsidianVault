 </p><blockquote> 
  
  
 <i>To sinfull house of Pride, Duessa<br>
 guides the faithfull knight,<br> 
 Where brothers death to wreak Sansioy<br> 
 doth chalenge him to fight. </i><p> 
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>     
 YOung knight, what euer that dost armes 
 professe,<br>  
 And through long labours huntest after fame,<br>  
 Beware of fraud, beware of ficklenesse,<br>  
 In choice, and change of thy deare loued Dame,<br>  
 Least thou of her beleeue too lightly blame,<br>  
 And rash misweening doe thy hart remoue:<br>  
 For vnto knight there is no greater shame,<br>  
 Then lightnesse and inconstancie in loue;<br>
 That doth this <i>Redcrosse</i> knights ensample plainly proue.<p>
  
 Who after that he had faire <i>Vna</i> lorne,<br>  
 Through light misdeeming of her loialtie,<br>  
 And false <i>Duessa</i> in her sted had borne,<br>  
 Called <i>Fidess'</i>, and so supposd to bee;<br>  
 Long with her traueild, till at last they see<br>  
 A goodly building, brauely garnished,<br>  
 The house of mightie Prince it seemd to bee:<br>  
 And towards it a broad high way that led,<br>
 All bare through peoples feet, which thither traueiled.</p><p>
  
 Great troupes of people traueild thitherward<br>  
 Both day and night, of each degree and place,<br>  
 But few returned, hauing scaped hard,<br>  
 With balefull beggerie, or foule disgrace,<br>  
 Which euer after in most wretched case,<br>  
 Like loathsome lazars, by the hedges lay.<br>  
 Thither <i>Duessa</i> bad him bend his pace:<br>  
 For she is wearie of the toilesome way,<br>
 And also nigh consumed is the lingring day.</p><p>
  
 A stately Pallace built of squared bricke,<br>  
 Which cunningly was without morter laid,<br>  
 Whose wals were high, but nothing strong, nor thick,<br>  
 And golden foile all ouer them displaid,<br>  
 That purest skye with brightnesse they dismaid:<br>  
 High lifted vp were many loftie towres,<br>  
 And goodly galleries farre ouer laid,<br>  
 Full of faire windowes, and delightfull bowres;<br>
 And on the top a Diall told the timely howres.</p><p>
  
 It was a goodly heape for to behould,<br>  
 And spake the praises of the workmans wit;<br>  
 But full great pittie, that so faire a mould<br>  
 Did on so weake foundation euer sit:<br>  
 For on a sandie hill, that still did flit,<br>  
 And fall away, it mounted was full hie,<br>  
 That euery breath of heauen shaked it:<br>  
 And all the hinder parts, that few could spie,<br>
 Were ruinous and old, but painted cunningly.</p><p>
  
 Arriued there they passed in forth right;<br>  
 For still to all the gates stood open wide,<br>  
 Yet charge of them was to a Porter hight<br>  
 Cald <i>Maluenú</i>, who entrance none denide:<br>  
 Thence to the hall, which was on euery side<br>  
 With rich array and costly arras dight:<br>  
 Infinite sorts of people did abide<br>  
 There waiting long, to win the wished sight<br>
 Of her, that was the Lady of that Pallace bright.</p><p>
  
 By them they passe, all gazing on them round,<br>  
 And to the Presence mount; whose glorious vew<br>  
 Their frayle amazed senses did confound:<br>  
 In liuing Princes court none euer knew<br>  
 Such endlesse richesse, and so sumptuous shew;<br>  
 Ne <i>Persia</i> selfe, the nourse of pompous pride<br>  
 Like euer saw. And there a noble crew<br>  
 Of Lordes and Ladies stood on euery side<br>
 Which with their presence faire, the place much beautifide.</p><p>
  
 High aboue all a cloth of State was spred,<br>  
 And a rich throne, as bright as sunny day,<br>  
 On which there sate most braue embellished<br>  
 With royall robes and gorgeous array,<br>  
 A mayden Queene, that shone as <i>Titans</i> ray,<br>  
 In glistring gold, and peerelesse pretious stone:<br>  
 Yet her bright blazing beautie did assay<br>  
 To dim the brightnesse of her glorious throne,<br>
 As enuying her selfe, that too exceeding shone.</p><p>
  
 Exceeding shone, like <i>Phoebus</i> fairest childe,<br>  
 That did presume his fathers firie wayne,<br>  
 And flaming mouthes of steedes vnwonted wilde<br>  
 Through highest heauen with weaker hand to rayne;<br>  
 Proud of such glory and aduancement vaine,<br>  
 While flashing beames do daze his feeble eyen,<br>  
 He leaues the welkin way most beaten plaine,<br>  
 And rapt with whirling wheeles, inflames the skyen,<br>
 With fire not made to burne, but fairely for to shyne.</p><p>
  
 So proud she shyned in her Princely state,<br>  
 Looking to heauen; for earth she did disdayne,<br>  
 And sitting high; for lowly she did hate:<br>  
 Lo vnderneath her scornefull feete, was layne<br>  
 A dreadfull Dragon with an hideous trayne,<br>  
 And in her hand she held a mirrhour bright,<br>  
 Wherein her face she often vewed fayne,<br>  
 And in her selfe-lou'd semblance tooke delight;<br>
 For she was wondrous faire, as any liuing wight.</p><p>
  
 Of griesly <i>Pluto</i> she the daughter was,<br>  
 And sad <i>Proserpina</i> the Queene of hell;<br>  
 Yet did she thinke her pearelesse wroth to pas<br>  
 That parentage, with pride so did she swell,<br>  
 And thundring <i>Ioue</i>, that high in heauen doth dwell,<br>  
 And wield the world, she claymed for her syre,<br>  
 Or if that any else did <i>Ioue</i> excell:<br>  
 For to the highest she did still aspyre,<br>
 Or if ought higher were then that, did it desyre.</p><p>
  
 And proud <i>Lucifera</i> men did her call,<br>  
 That made her selfe a Queene, and crownd to be,<br>  
 Yet rightfull kingdome she had none at all,<br>  
 Ne heritage of natiue soueraintie,<br>  
 But did vsurpe with wrong and tyrannie<br>  
 Vpon the scepter, which she now did hold:<br>  
 Ne ruld her Realmes with lawes, but pollicie,<br>  
 And strong aduizement of six wisards old,<br>
 That with their counsels bad her kingdome did vphold.</p><p>
  
 Soone as the Elfing knight in presence came,<br>  
 And false <i>Duessa</i> seeming Lady faire,<br>  
 A gentle Husher, <i>Vanitie</i> by name<br>  
 Made rowme, and passage for them did prepaire:<br>  
 So goodly brought them to the lowest staire<br>  
 Of her high throne, where they on humble knee<br>  
 Making obeyssance, did the cause declare,<br>  
 Why they were come, her royall state to see,<br>
 To proue the wide report of her great Maiestee.</p><p>
  
 With loftie eyes, halfe loth to looke so low,<br>  
 She thanked them in her disdainefull wise,<br>  
 Ne other grace vouchsafed them to show<br>  
 Of Princesse worthy, scarse them bad arise.<br>  
 Her Lordes and Ladies all this while deuise<br>  
 Themselues to setten forth to straungers sight:<br>  
 Some frounce their curled haire in courtly guise,<br>  
 Some prancke their ruffes, and others trimly dight<br>
 Their gay attire: each others greater pride does spight.</p><p>
  
 Goodly they all that knight do entertaine,<br>  
 Right glad with him to haue increast their crew:<br>  
 But to <i>Duess'</i> each one himselfe did paine<br>  
 All kindnesse and faire courtesie to shew;<br>  
 For in that court whylome her well they knew:<br>  
 Yet the stout Faerie mongst the middest crowd<br>  
 Thought all their glorie vaine in knightly vew,<br>  
 And that great Princesse too exceeding prowd,<br>
 That to strange knight no better countenance allowd.</p><p>
  
 Suddein vpriseth from her stately place<br>  
 The royall Dame, and for her coche doth call:<br>  
 All hurtlen forth, and she with Princely pace,<br>  
 As faire <i>Aurora</i> in her purple pall,<br>  
 Out of the East the dawning day doth call:<br>  
 So forth she comes: her brightnesse brode doth blaze;<br>  
 The heapes of people thronging in the hall,<br>  
 Do ride each other, vpon her to gaze:<br>
 Her glorious glitterand light doth all mens eyes amaze.</p><p>
  
 So forth she comes, and to her coche does clyme,<br>  
 Adorned all with gold, and girlonds gay,<br>  
 That seemd as fresh as <i>Flora</i> in her prime,<br>  
 And stroue to match, in royall rich array,<br>  
 Great <i>Iunoes</i> golden chaire, the which they say<br>  
 The Gods stand gazing on, when she does ride<br>  
 To <i>Ioues</i> high house through heauens bras-paued way<br>
 Drawne of faire Pecocks, that excell in pride,<br>
 And full of <i>Argus</i> eyes their tailes dispredden wide.</p><p>
  
 But this was drawne of six vnequall beasts,<br>  
 On which her six sage Counsellours did ryde,<br>  
 Taught to obay their bestiall beheasts,<br>  
 With like conditions to their kinds applyde:<br>  
 Of which the first, that all the rest did guyde,<br>  
 Was sluggish <i>Idlenesse</i> the nourse of sin;<br>  
 Vpon a slouthfull Asse he chose to ryde,<br>  
 Arayd in habit blacke, and amis thin,<br>
 Like to an holy Monck, the seruice to begin.</p><p>
  
 And in his hand his Portesse still he bare,<br>  
 That much was worne, but therein little red,<br>  
 For of deuotion he had little care,<br>  
 Still drownd in sleepe, and most of his dayes ded;<br>  
 Scarse could he once vphold his heauie hed,<br>  
 To looken, whether it were night or day:<br>  
 May seeme the wayne was very euill led,<br>  
 When such an one had guiding of the way,<br>
 That knew not, whether right he went, or else astray.</p><p>
  
 From worldy cares himselfe he did esloyne,<br>  
 And greatly shunned manly exercise,<br>  
 From euery worke he chalenged essoyne,<br>  
 For contemplation sake: yet otherwise,<br>  
 His life he led in lawlesse riotise;<br>  
 By which he grew to grieuous malady;<br>  
 For in his lustlesse limbs through euill guise<br>  
 A shaking feuer raignd continually:<br>
 Such one was <i>Idlenesse</i>, first of this company.</p><p>
  
 And by his side rode loathsome <i>Gluttony</i>,<br>  
 Deformed creature, on a filthie swyne,<br>  
 His belly was vp-blowne with luxury,<br>  
 And eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne,<br>  
 And like a Crane his necke was long and fyne,<br>  
 With which he swallowd vp excessiue feast,<br>  
 For want whereof poore people oft did pyne;<br>  
 And all the way, most like a brutish beast,<br>  
 He spued vp his gorge, that all did him deteast.</p><p>
  
 In greene vine leaues he was right fitly clad;<br>  
 For other clothes he could not weare for heat,<br>  
 And on his head an yuie girland had,<br>  
 From vnder which fast trickled downe the sweat:<br>  
 Still as he rode, he somewhat still did eat,<br>  
 And in his hand did beare a bouzing can,<br>  
 Of which he supt so oft, that on his seat<br>  
 His dronken corse he scarse vpholden can,<br>
 In shape and life more like a monster, then a man.</p><p>
  
 Vnfit he was for any worldy thing,<br>  
 And eke vnhable once to stirre or go,<br>  
 Not meet to be of counsell to a king,<br>  
 Whose mind in meat and drinke was drowned so,<br>  
 That from his friend he seldome knew his fo:<br>  
 Full of diseases was his carcas blew,<br>  
 And a dry dropsie through his flesh did flow:<br>  
 Which by misdiet daily greater grew:<br>
 Such one was <i>Gluttony</i>, the second of that crew.</p><p>
  
 And next to him rode lustfull <i>Lechery</i>,<br>  
 Vpon a bearded Goat, whose rugged haire,<br>  
 And whally eyes (the signe of gelosy,)<br>  
 Was like the person selfe, whom he did beare:<br>  
 Who rough, and blacke, and filthy did appeare,<br>  
 Vnseemely man to please faire Ladies eye;<br>  
 Yet he of Ladies oft was loued deare,<br>  
 When fairer faces were bid standen by:<br>
 O who does know the bent of womens fantasy?</p><p>
  
 In a greene gowne he clothed was full faire,<br>  
 Which vnderneath did hide his filthinesse,<br>  
 And in his hand a burning hart he bare,<br>  
 Full of vaine follies, and new fanglenesse:<br>  
 For he was false, and fraught with ficklenesse,<br>  
 And learned had to loue with secret lookes,<br>  
 And well could daunce, and sing with ruefulnesse,<br>  
 And fortunes tell, and read in louing bookes,<br>
 And thousand other wayes, to bait his fleshly hookes.</p><p>
  
 Inconstant man, that loued all he saw,<br>  
 And lusted after all, that he did loue,<br>  
 Ne would his looser life be tide to law,<br>  
 But ioyd weake wemens hearts to tempt, and proue<br>  
 If from their loyall loues he might then moue;<br>  
 Which lewdnesse fild him with reprochfull paine<br>  
 Of that fowle euill, which all men reproue,<br>  
 That rots the marrow, and consumes the braine:<br>
 Such one was <i>Lecherie</i>, the third of all this traine.</p><p>
  
 And greedy <i>Auarice</i> by him did ride,<br>  
 Vpon a Camell loaden all with gold;<br>  
 Two iron coffers hong on either side,<br>  
 With precious mettall full, as they might hold,<br>  
 And in his lap an heape of coine he told;<br>  
 For of his wicked pelfe his God he made,<br>  
 And vnto hell him selfe for money sold;<br>  
 Accursed vsurie was all his trade,<br>
 And right and wrong ylike in equall ballaunce waide.</p><p>
  
 His life was nigh vnto deaths doore yplast,<br>  
 And thred-bare cote, and cobled shoes he ware,<br>  
 Ne scarse good morsell all his life did tast,<br>  
 But both from backe and belly still did spare,<br>  
 To fill his bags, and richesse to compare;<br>  
 Yet chylde ne kinsman liuing had he none<br>  
 To leaue them to; but thorough daily care<br>  
 To get, and nightly feare to lose his owne,<br>
 He led a wretched life vnto him selfe vnknowne.</p><p>
  
 Most wretched wight, whom nothing might suffise,<br>  
 Whose greedy lust did lacke in greatest store,<br>  
 Whose need had end, but no end couetise,<br>  
 Whose wealth was want, whose plẽty made him pore,<br>  
 Who had enough, yet wished euer more;<br>  
 A vile disease, and eke in foote and hand<br>  
 A grieuous gout tormented him full sore,<br>  
 That well he could not touch, nor go, nor stand:<br>
 Such one was <i>Auarice</i>, the fourth of this faire band.</p><p>
  
 And next to him malicious <i>Enuie</i> rode,<br>  
 Vpon a rauenous wolfe, and still did chaw<br>  
 Betweene his cankred teeth a venemous tode,<br>  
 That all the poison ran about his chaw;<br>  
 But inwardly he chawed his owne maw<br>  
 At neighbours wealth, that made him euer sad;<br>  
 For death it was, when any good he saw,<br>  
 And wept, that cause of weeping none he had,<br>
 But when he heard of harme, he wexed wondrous glad.</p><p>
  
 All in a kirtle of discolourd say<br>  
 He clothed was, ypainted full of eyes;<br>  
 And in his bosome secretly there lay<br>  
 An hatefull Snake, the which his taile vptyes<br>  
 In many folds, and mortall sting implyes.<br>  
 Still as he rode, he gnasht his teeth, to see<br>  
 Those heapes of gold with griple Couetyse,<br>  
 And grudged at the great felicitie<br>
 Of proud <i>Lucifera</i>, and his owne companie.</p><p>
  
 He hated all good workes and vertuous deeds,<br>  
 And him no lesse, that any like did vse,<br>  
 And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds,<br>  
 His almes for want of faith he doth accuse;<br>  
 So euery good to bad he doth abuse:<br>  
 And eke the verse of famous Poets witt<br>  
 He does backebite, and spightfull poison spues<br>  
 From leprous mouth on all, that euer writt:<br>
 Such one vile <i>Enuie</i> was, that fift in row did sitt.</p><p>
  
 And him beside rides fierce reuenging <i>VVrath</i>,<br>  
 Vpon a Lion, loth for to be led;<br>  
 And in his hand a burning brond he hath,<br>  
 The which he brandisheth about his hed;<br>  
 His eyes did hurle forth sparkles fiery red,<br>  
 And stared sterne on all, that him beheld,<br>  
 As ashes pale of hew and seeming ded;<br>  
 And on his dagger still his hand he held,<br>
 Trembling through hasty rage, whẽ choler in him sweld.</p><p>
  
 His ruffin raiment all was staind with blood,<br>  
 Which he had spilt, and all to rags yrent,<br>  
 Through vnaduized rashnesse woxen wood;<br>  
 For of his hands he had no gouernement,<br>  
 Ne car'd for bloud in his auengement:<br>  
 But when the furious fit was ouerpast,<br>  
 His cruell facts he often would repent;<br>  
 Yet wilfull man he neuer would forecast,<br>
 How many mischieues should ensue his heedlesse hast.</p><p>
  
 Full many mischiefes follow cruell <i>VVrath</i>;<br>  
 Abhorred bloudshed, and tumultuous strife,<br>  
 Vnmanly murder, and vnthrifty scath,<br>  
 Bitter despight, with rancours rusty knife,<br>  
 And fretting griefe the enemy of life;<br>  
 All these, and many euils moe haunt ire,<br>  
 The swelling Splene, and Frenzy raging rife,<br>  
 The shaking Palsey, and Saint <i>Fraunces</i> fire:<br>
 Such one was <i>VVrath</i>, the last of this vngodly tire.</p><p>
  
 And after all, vpon the wagon beame<br>  
 Rode <i>Sathan</i>, with a smarting whip in hand,<br>  
 With which he forward lasht the laesie teme,<br>  
 So oft as <i>Slowth</i> still in the mire did stand.<br>  
 Huge routs of people did about them band,<br>  
 Showting for ioy, and still before their way<br>  
 A foggy mist had couered all the land;<br>  
 And vnderneath their feet, all scattered lay<br>
 Dead sculs &amp; bones of men, whose life had gone astray.</p><p>
  
 So forth they marchen in this goodly sort,<br>  
 To take the solace of the open aire,<br>  
 And in fresh flowring fields themselues to sport;<br>  
 Emongst the rest rode that false Lady faire,<br>  
 The fowle <i>Duessa</i>, next vnto the chaire<br>  
 Of proud <i>Lucifer'</i>, as one of the traine:<br>  
 But that good knight would not so nigh repaire,<br>  
 Him selfe estraunging from their ioyaunce vaine,<br>
 Whose fellowship seemd far vnfit for warlike swaine.</p><p>
  
 So hauing solaced themselues a space<br>  
 With pleasaunce of the breathing fields yfed<br>  
 They backe returned to the Princely Place;<br>  
 Whereas an errant knight in armes ycled,<br>  
 And heathnish shield, wherein with letters red<br>  
 Was writ <i>Sans ioy</i>, they new arriued find:<br>  
 Enflam'd with fury and fiers hardy-hed,<br>  
 He seemd in hart to harbour thoughts vnkind,<br>
 And nourish bloudy vengeaunce in his bitter mind.</p><p>
  
 Who when the shamed shield of slaine <i>Sans foy</i><br>  
 He spide with that same Faery champions page,<br>  
 Bewraying him, that did of late destroy<br>  
 His eldest brother, burning all with rage<br>  
 He to him leapt, and that same enuious gage<br>  
 Of victors glory from him snatcht away:<br>  
 But th'Elfin knight, which ought that warlike wage,<br>  
 Disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray,<br>
 And him rencountring fierce, reskewd the noble pray.</p><p>
  
 Therewith they gan to hurtlen greedily,<br>  
 Redoubted battaile ready to darrayne,<br>  
 And clash their shields, and shake their swords on hy,<br>  
 That with their sturre they troubled all the traine;<br>  
 Till that great Queene vpon eternall paine<br>  
 Of high displeasure, that ensewen might,<br>  
 Commaunded them their fury to refraine,<br>  
 And if that either to that shield had right,<br>
 In equall lists they should the morrow next it fight.</p><p>
  
 Ah dearest Dame, (quoth then the Paynim bold,)<br>  
 Pardon the errour of enraged wight,<br>  
 Whom great griefe made forget the raines to hold<br>  
 Of reasons rule, to see this recreant knight,<br>  
 No knight, but treachour full of false despight<br>  
 And shamefull treason, who through guile hath slayn<br>  
 The prowest knight, that euer field did fight,<br>  
 Euen stout <i>Sans foy</i> (O who can then refrayn?)<br>
 Whose shield he beares renuerst, the more to heape disdayn.</p><p>
  
 And to augment the glorie of his guile,<br>  
 His dearest loue the faire <i>Fidessa</i> loe<br>  
 Is there possessed of the traytour vile,<br>  
 Who reapes the haruest sowen by his foe,<br>  
 Sowen in bloudy field, and bought with woe:<br>  
 That brothers hand shall dearely well requight<br>  
 So be, ô Queene, you equall fauour showe.<br>  
 Him litle answerd th'angry Elfin knight;<br>
 He neuer meant with words, but swords to plead his right.</p><p>
  
 But threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge,<br>  
 His cause in combat the next day to try:<br>  
 So been they parted both, with harts on edge,<br>  
 To be aueng'd each on his enimy.<br>  
 That night they pas in ioy and iollity,<br>  
 Feasting and courting both in bowre and hall;<br>  
 For Steward was excessiue <i>Gluttonie</i>,<br>  
 That of his plenty poured forth to all:<br>
 Which doen, the Chamberlain <i>Slowth</i> did to rest them call.</p><p>
  
 Now whenas darkesome night had all displayd<br>  
 Her coleblacke curtein ouer brightest skye,<br>  
 The warlike youthes on dayntie couches layd,<br>  
 Did chace away sweet sleepe from sluggish eye,<br>  
 To muse on meanes of hoped victory.<br>  
 But whenas <i>Morpheus</i> had with leaden mace<br>  
 Arrested all that courtly company,<br>  
 Vp-rose <i>Duessa</i> from her resting place,<br>
 And to the Paynims lodging comes with silent pace.</p><p>
  
 Whom broad awake she finds, in troublous fit,<br>  
 Forecasting, how his foe he might annoy,<br>  
 And him amoues with speaches seeming fit:<br>  
 Ah deare <i>Sans ioy</i>, next dearest to <i>Sans foy</i>,<br>  
 Cause of my new griefe, cause of my new ioy,<br>  
 Ioyous, to see his ymage in mine eye,<br>  
 And greeu'd, to thinke how foe did him destroy,<br>  
 That was the flowre of grace and cheualrye;<br>
 Lo his <i>Fidessa</i> to thy secret faith I flye.</p><p>
  
 With gentle wordes he can her fairely greet,<br>  
 And bad say on the secret of her hart.<br>  
 Then sighing soft, I learne that litle sweet<br>  
 Oft tempred is (quoth she) with muchell smart:<br>  
 For since my brest was launcht with louely dart<br>  
 Of deare <i>Sansfoy</i>, I neuer ioyed howre,<br>  
 But in eternall woes my weaker hart<br>  
 Haue wasted, louing him with all my powre,<br>
 And for his sake haue felt full many an heauie stowre.</p><p>
  
 At last when perils all I weened past,<br>  
 And hop'd to reape the crop of all my care,<br>  
 Into new woes vnweeting I was cast,<br>  
 By this false faytor, who vnworthy ware<br>  
 His worthy shield, whom he with guilefull snare<br>  
 Entrapped slew, and brought to shamefull graue.<br>  
 Me silly maid away with him he bare,<br>  
 And euer since hath kept in darksome caue,<br>
 For that I would not yeeld, that to <i>Sans-foy</i> I gaue.</p><p>
  
 But since faire Sunne hath sperst that lowring clowd,<br>  
 And to my loathed life now shewes some light,<br>  
 Vnder your beames I will me safely shrowd,<br>  
 From dreaded storme of his disdainfull spight:<br>  
 To you th'inheritance belongs by right<br>  
 Of brothers prayse, to you eke longs his loue.<br>  
 Let not his loue, let not his restlesse spright<br>  
 Be vnreueng'd, that calles to you aboue<br>
 From wandring <i>Stygian</i> shores, where it doth endlesse moue.</p><p>
  
 Thereto said he, Faire Dame be nought dismaid<br>  
 For sorrowes past; their griefe is with them gone:<br>  
 Ne yet of present perill be affraid;<br>  
 For needlesse feare did neuer vantage none,<br>  
 And helplesse hap it booteth not to mone.<br>  
 Dead is <i>Sans-foy</i>, his vitall paines are past,<br>  
 Though greeued ghost for vengeance deepe do grone:<br>  
 He liues, that shall him pay his dewties last,<br>
 And guiltie Elfin bloud shall sacrifice in hast.</p><p>
  
 O but I feare the fickle freakes (quoth shee)<br>  
 Of fortune false, and oddes of armes in field.<br>  
 Why dame (quoth he) what oddes can euer bee,<br>  
 Where both do fight alike, to win or yield?<br>  
 Yea but (quoth she) he beares a charmed shield,<br>  
 And eke enchaunted armes, that none can perce,<br>  
 Ne none can wound the man, that does them wield.<br>  
 Charmd or enchaunted (answerd he then ferce)<br>
 I no whit reck, ne you the like need to reherce.</p><p>
  
 But faire <i>Fidessa</i>, sithens fortunes guile,<br>  
 Or enimies powre hath now captiued you,<br>  
 Returne from whence ye came, and rest a while<br>  
 Till morrow next, that I the Elfe subdew,<br>  
 And with <i>Sans-foyes</i> dead dowry you endew.<br>  
 Ay me, that is a double death (she said)<br>  
 With proud foes sight my sorrow to renew:<br>
