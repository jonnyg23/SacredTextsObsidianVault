 </p><p>
 </p><blockquote> 
  
 <i>Forsaken Truth long seekes her loue,<br>
 And makes the Lyon mylde,<br>
 Marres blind Deuotions mart, and fals<br> 
 In hand of leachour vylde.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 NOught there vnder heau'ns wilde hollownesse,<br>
   
 That moues more deare compassion of mind,<br>
   
 Then beautie brought t'vnworthy wretchednesse<br>
   
 Through enuies snares or fortunes freakes vnkind:<br>
   
 I, whether lately through her brightnesse blind,<br>
   
 Or through alleageance and fast fealtie,<br>
   
 Which I do owe vnto all woman kind,<br>
   
 Feele my heart perst with so great agonie,<br>
 When such I see, that all for pittie I could die.<p>
  
 And now it is empassioned so deepe,<br>
   
 For fairest <i>Vnaes</i> sake, of whom I sing,<br>
   That my fraile eyes these lines with teares do steepe,<br>
 To thinke how she through guilefull handeling,<br>  
 Though true as touch, though daughter of a king,<br>  
 Though faire as euer liuing wight was faire,<br>  
 Though nor in word nor deede ill meriting,<br>  
 Is from her knight diuorced in despaire<br>
 And her due loues deriu'd to that vile witches share.</p><p>
  
 Yet she most faithfull Ladie all this while<br>  
 Forsaken, wofull, solitarie mayd<br>  
 Farre from all peoples prease, as in exile,<br>  
 In wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd,<br>  
 To seeke her knight; who subtilly betrayd<br>  
 Through that late vision, which th'Enchaunter wrought,<br>  
 Had her abandond. She of nought affrayd,<br>  
 Through woods and wastnesse wide him daily sought;<br>
 Yet wished tydings none of him vnto her brought.</p><p>
  
 One day nigh wearie of the yrkesome way,<br>  
 From her vnhastie beast she did alight,<br>  
 And on the grasse her daintie limbes did lay<br>  
 In secret shadow, farre from all mens sight:<br>  
 From her faire head her fillet she vndight,<br>  
 And laid her stole aside. Her angels face<br>  
 As the great eye of heauen shyned bright,<br>  
 And made a sunshine in the shadie place;<br>
 Did neuer mortall eye behold such heauenly grace.</p><p>
  
 It fortuned out of the thickest wood<br>  
 A ramping Lyon rushed suddainly,<br>  
 Hunting full greedie after saluage blood;<br>  
 Soone as the royall virgin he did spy,<br>  
 With gaping mouth at her ran greedily,<br>  
 To haue attonce deuour'd her tender corse:<br>  
 But to the pray when as he drew more ny,<br>  
 His bloudie rage asswaged with remorse,<br>
 And with the sight amazd, forgat his furious forse.</p><p>
  
 In stead thereof he kist her wearie feet,<br>  
 And lickt her lilly hands with fawning tong,<br>  
 As he her wronged innocence did weet.<br>  
 O how can beautie maister the most strong,<br>  
 And simple truth subdue auenging wrong?<br>  
 Whose yeelded pride and proud submission,<br>  
 Still dreading death, when she had marked long,<br>  
 Her hart gan melt in great compassion,<br>
 And drizling teares did shed for pure affection.</p><p>
  
 The Lyon Lord of euerie beast in field,<br>  
 Quoth she, his princely puissance doth abate,<br>  
 And mightie proud to humble weake does yield,<br>  
 Forgetfull of the hungry rage, which late<br>  
 Him prickt, in pittie of my sad estate:<br>  
 But he my Lyon, and my noble Lord,<br>  
 How does he find in cruell hart to hate<br>  
 Her that him lou'd, and euer most adord,<br>
 As the God of my life?  why hath he me abhord?</p><p>
  
 Redounding teares did choke th'end of her plaint,<br>  
 Which softly ecchoed from the neighbour wood;<br>  
 And sad to see her sorrowfull constraint<br>  
 The kingly beast vpon her gazing stood;<br>  
 With pittie calmd, downe fell his angry mood.<br>  
 At last in close hart shutting vp her paine,<br>  
 Arose the virgin borne of heauenly brood,<br>  
 And to her snowy Palfrey got againe,<br>
 To seeke her strayed Champion, if she might attaine.</p><p>
  
 The Lyon would not leaue her desolate,<br>  
 But with her went along, as a strong gard<br>  
 Of her chast person, and a faithfull mate<br>  
 Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard:<br>  
 Still when she slept, he kept both watch and ward,<br>  
 And when she wakt, he waited diligent,<br>  
 With humble seruice to her will prepard:<br>  
 From her faire eyes he tooke commaundement,<br>
 And euer by her lookes conceiued her intent.</p><p>
  
 Long she thus traueiled through deserts wyde,<br>  
 By which she thought her wandring knight shold pas,<br>  
 Yet neuer shew of liuing wight espyde;<br>  
 Till that at length she found the troden gras,<br>  
 In which the tract of peoples footing was,<br>  
 Vnder the steepe foot of a mountaine hore;<br>  
 The same she followes, till at last she has<br>  
 A damzell spyde slow footing her before,<br>
 That on her shoulders sad a pot of water bore.</p><p>
  
 To whom approching she to her gan call,<br>  
 To weet, if dwelling place were nigh at hand;<br>  
 But the rude wench her answer'd nought at all,<br>  
 She could not heare, nor speake, nor vnderstand;<br>  
 Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand,<br>  
 With suddaine feare her pitcher downe she threw,<br>  
 And fled away: for neuer in that land<br>  
 Face of faire Ladie she before did vew,<br>
 And that dread Lyons looke her cast in deadly hew.</p><p>
  
 Full fast she fled, ne euer lookt behynd,<br>  
 As if her life vpon the wager lay,<br>  
 And home she came, whereas her mother blynd<br>  
 Sate in eternall night: nought could she say,<br>  
 But suddaine catching hold, did her dismay<br>  
 With quaking hands, and other signs of feare:<br>  
 Who full of ghastly fright and cold affray,<br>  
 Gan shut the dore. By this arriued there<br>
 Dame <i>Vna</i>, wearie Dame, and entrance did requere.</p><p>
  
 Which when none yeelded, her vnruly Page<br>  
 With his rude clawes the wicket open rent,<br>  
 And let her in; where of his cruell rage<br>  
 Nigh dead with feare, and faint astonishment,<br>  
 She found them both in darkesome corner pent;<br>  
 Where that old woman day and night did pray<br>  
 Vpon her beades deuoutly penitent;<br>  
 Nine hundred <i>Pater nosters</i> euery day,<br>
 And thrise nine hundred <i>Aues</i> she was wont to say.</p><p>
  
 And to augment her painefull pennance more,<br>  
 Thrise euery weeke in ashes she did sit,<br>  
 And next her wrinkled skin rough sackcloth wore,<br>  
 And thrise three times did fast from any bit:<br>  
 But now for feare her beads she did forget.<br>  
 Whose needlesse dread for to remoue away,<br>  
 Faire <i>Vna</i> framed words and count'nance fit:<br>  
 Which hardly doen, at length she gan them pray,<br>
 That in their cotage small, that night she rest her may.</p><p>
  
 The day is spent, and commeth drowsie night,<br>  
 When euery creature shrowded is in sleepe;<br>  
 Sad <i>Vna</i> downe her laies in wearie plight,<br>  
 And at her feet the Lyon watch doth keepe:<br>  
 In stead of rest, she does lament, and weepe<br>  
 For the late losse of her deare loued knight,<br>  
 And sighes, and grones, and euermore does steepe<br>  
 Her tender brest in bitter teares all night,<br>
 All night she thinks too long, and often lookes for light.</p><p>
  
 Now when <i>Aldeboran</i> was mounted hie<br>  
 Aboue the shynie <i>Cassiopeias</i> chaire,<br>  
 And all in deadly sleepe did drowned lie,<br>  
 One knocked at the dore, and in would fare;<br>  
 He knocked fast, and often curst, and sware,<br>  
 That readie entrance was not at his call:<br>  
 For on his backe a heauy load he bare<br>  
 Of nightly stelths and pillage seuerall,<br>
 Which he had got abroad by purchase criminall.</p><p>
  
 He was to weete a stout and sturdie thiefe,<br>  
 Wont to robbe Churches of their ornaments,<br>  
 And poore mens boxes of their due reliefe,<br>  
 Which giuen was to them for good intents;<br>  
 The holy Saints of their rich vestiments<br>  
 He did disrobe, when all men carelesse slept,<br>  
 And spoild the Priests of their habiliments,<br>  
 Whiles none the holy things in safety kept;<br>
 Then he by cunning sleights in at the window crept.</p><p>
  
 And all that he by right or wrong could find,<br>  
 Vnto this house he brought, and did bestow<br>  
 Vpon the daughter of this woman blind,<br>  
 <i>Abessa</i> daughter of <i>Corceca</i> slow,<br>  
 With whom he whoredome vsd, that few did know,<br>  
 And fed her fat with feast of offerings,<br>  
 And plentie, which in all the land did grow;<br>  
 Ne spared he to giue her gold and rings:<br>
 And now he to her brought part of his stolen things.</p><p>
  
 Thus long the dore with rage and threats he bet,<br>  
 Yet of those fearefull women none durst rize,<br>  
 The Lyon frayed them, him in to let:<br>  
 He would no longer stay him to aduize,<br>  
 But open breakes the dore in furious wize,<br>  
 And entring is; when that disdainfull beast<br>  
 Encountring fierce, him suddaine doth surprize,<br>  
 And seizing cruell clawes on trembling brest,<br>
 Vnder his Lordly foot him proudly hath supprest.</p><p>
  
 Him booteth not resist, nor succour call,<br>  
 His bleeding hart is in the vengers hand,<br>  
 Who streight him rent in thousand peeces small,<br>  
 And quite dismembred hath: the thirstie land<br>  
 Drunke vp his life; his corse left on the strand.<br>  
 His fearefull friends weare out the wofull night,<br>  
 Ne dare to weepe, nor seeme to vnderstand<br>  
 The heauie hap, which on them is alight,<br>
 Affraid, least to themselues the like mishappen might.</p><p>
  
 Now when broad day the world discouered has,<br>  
 Vp <i>Vna</i> rose, vp rose the Lyon eke,<br>  
 And on their former iourney forward pas,<br>  
 In wayes vnknowne, her wandring knight to seeke,<br>  
 With paines farre passing that long wandring 
 <i>Greeke</i>,<br>  
 That for his loue refused deitie;<br>  
 Such were the labours of this Lady meeke,<br>  
 Still seeking him, that from her still did flie,<br>
 Then furthest from her hope, when most she weened nie.</p><p>
  
 Soone as she parted thence, the fearefull twaine,<br>  
 That blind old woman and her daughter deare<br>  
 Came forth, and finding <i>Kirkrapine</i> there slaine,<br>  
 For anguish great they gan to rend their heare,<br>  
 And beat their brests, and naked flesh to teare.<br>  
 And when they both had wept and wayld their fill,<br>  
 Then forth they ranne like two amazed deare,<br>  
 Halfe mad through malice, and reuenging will,<br>
 To follow her, that was the causer of their ill.</p><p>
  
 Whom ouertaking, they gan loudly bray,<br>  
 With hollow howling, and lamenting cry,<br>  
 Shamefully at her rayling all the way,<br>  
 And her accusing of dishonesty,<br>  
 That was the flowre of faith and chastity;<br>  
 And still amidst her rayling, she did pray,<br>  
 That plagues, and mischiefs, and long misery<br>  
 Might fall on her, and follow all the way,<br>
 And that in endlesse error she might euer stray.</p><p>
  
 But when she saw her prayers nought preuaile,<br>  
 She backe returned with some labour lost;<br>  
 And in the way as she did weepe and waile,<br>  
 A knight her met in mighty armes embost,<br>  
 Yet knight was not for all his bragging bost,<br>  
 But subtill <i>Archimag</i>, that <i>Vna</i> sought<br>  
 By traynes into new troubles to haue tost:<br>  
 Of that old woman tydings he besought,<br>
 If that of such a Ladie she could tellen ought.</p><p>
  
 Therewith she gan her passion to renew,<br>  
 And cry, and curse, and raile, and rend her heare,<br>  
 Saying, that harlot she too lately knew,<br>  
 That causd her shed so many a bitter teare,<br>  
 And so forth told the story of her feare:<br>  
 Much seemed he to mone her haplesse chaunce,<br>  
 And after for that Ladie did inquere;<br>  
 Which being taught, he forward gan aduaunce<br>
 His fair enchaunted steed, and eke his charmed launce.</p><p>
  
 Ere long he came, where <i>Vna</i> traueild slow,<br>  
 And that wilde Champion wayting her besyde:<br>  
 Whom seeing such, for dread he durst not show<br>  
 Himselfe too nigh at hand, but turned wyde<br>  
 Vnto an hill; from whence when she him spyde,<br>  
 By his like seeming shield, her knight by name<br>  
 She weend it was, and towards him gan ryde:<br>  
 Approching nigh, she wist it was the same,<br>
 And with faire fearefull humblesse towards him shee came.</p><p>
  
 And weeping said, Ah my long lacked Lord,<br>  
 Where haue ye bene thus long out of my sight?<br>  
 Much feared I to haue bene quite abhord,<br>  
 Or ought haue done, that ye displeasen might,<br>  
 That should as death vnto my deare hart light:<br>  
 For since mine eye your ioyous sight did mis,<br>  
 My chearefull day is turnd to chearelesse night,<br>  
 And eke my night of death the shadow is;<br>
 But welcome now my light, and shining lampe of blis.</p><p>
  
 He thereto meeting said, My dearest Dame,<br>  
 Farre be it from your thought, and fro my will,<br>  
 To thinke that knighthood I so much should shame,<br>  
 As you to leaue, that haue me loued still,<br>  
 And chose in Faery court of meere goodwill,<br>  
 Where noblest knights were to be found on earth:<br>  
 The earth shall sooner leaue her kindly skill<br>  
 To bring forth fruit, and make eternall derth,<br>
 Then I leaue you, my liefe, yborne of heauenly berth.</p><p>
  
 And sooth to say, why I left you so long,<br>  
 Was for to seeke aduenture in strange place,<br>  
 Where <i>Archimago</i> said a felon strong<br>  
 To many knights did daily worke disgrace;<br>  
 But knight he now shall neuer more deface:<br>  
 Good cause of mine excuse; that mote ye please<br>  
 Well to accept, and euermore embrace<br>  
 My faithfull seruice, that by land and seas<br>
 Haue vowd you to defend. Now then your plaint appease.</p><p>
  
 His louely words her seemd due recompence<br>  
 Of all her passed paines: one louing howre<br>  
 For many yeares of sorrow can dispence:<br>  
 A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sowre:<br>  
 She has forgot, how many a wofull stowre<br>  
 For him she late endur'd; she speakes no more<br>  
 Of past: true is, that true loue hath no powre<br>  
 To looken backe; his eyes be fixt before.<br>
 Before her stands her knight, for whom she toyld so sore.</p><p>
  
 Much like, as when the beaten marinere,<br>  
 That long hath wandred in the <i>Ocean</i> wide,<br>  
 Oft soust in swelling <i>Tethys</i> saltish teare,<br>  
 And long time hauing tand his tawney hide<br>  
 With blustring breath of heauen, that none can bide,<br>  
 And scorching flames of fierce <i>Orions</i> hound,<br>  
 Soone as the port from farre he has espide,<br>  
 His chearefull whistle merrily doth sound,<br>
 And <i>Nereus</i> crownes with cups; his mates him pledg around.</p><p>
  
 Such ioy made <i>Vna</i>, when her knight she found;<br>  
 And eke th'enchaunter ioyous seemd no lesse,<br>  
 Then the glad marchant, that does vew from ground<br>  
 His ship farre come from watrie wildernesse,<br>  
 He hurles out vowes, and <i>Neptune</i> oft doth blesse:<br>  
 So forth they past, and all the way they spent<br>  
 Discoursing of her dreadfull late distresse,<br>  
 In which he askt her, what the Lyon ment:<br>
 Who told her all that fell in iourney as she went.</p><p>
  
 They had not ridden farre, when they might see<br>  
 One pricking towards them with hastie heat,<br>  
 Full strongly armd, and on a courser free,<br>  
 That through his fiercenesse fomed all with sweat,<br>  
 And the sharpe yron did for anger eat,<br>  
 When his hot ryder spurd his chauffed side;<br>  
 His looke was sterne, and seemed still to threat<br>  
 Cruell reuenge, which he in hart did hyde,<br>
 And on his shield <i>Sans loy</i> in bloudie lines was dyde.</p><p>
  
 When nigh he drew vnto this gentle payre<br>  
 And saw the Red-crosse, which the knight did beare,<br>  
 He burnt in fire, and gan eftsoones prepare<br>  
 Himselfe to battell with his couched speare.<br>  
 Loth was that other, and did faint through feare,<br>  
 To taste th'vntryed dint of deadly steele;<br>  
 But yet his Lady did so well him cheare,<br>  
 That hope of new good hap he gan to feele;<br>
 So bent his speare, and spurnd his horse with yron heele.</p><p>
  
 But that proud Paynim forward came so fierce,<br>  
 And full of wrath, that with his sharp-head speare<br>  
 Through vainely crossed shield he quite did pierce,<br>  
 And had his staggering steede not shrunke for feare,<br>  
 Through shield and bodie eke he should him beare:<br>  
 Yet so great was the puissance of his push,<br>  
 That from his saddle quite he did him beare:<br>  
 He tombling rudely downe to ground did rush,<br>
 And from his gored wound a well of bloud did gush.</p><p>
  
 Dismounting lightly from his loftie steed,<br>  
 He to him lept, in mind to reaue his life,<br>  
 And proudly said, Lo there the worthie meed<br>  
 Of him, that slew <i>Sansfoy</i> with bloudie knife;<br>  
 Henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife,<br>  
 In peace may passen ouer <i>Lethe</i> lake,<br>  
 When morning altars purgd with enemies life,<br>  
 The blacke infernall <i>Furies</i> doen aslake:<br>  
 Life from <i>Sansfoy</i> thou tookst, <i>Sansloy</i> shall frõ 
 thee 
 take.</p><p>
  
 Therewith in haste his helmet gan vnlace,<br>  
 Till <i>Vna</i> cride, O hold that heauie hand,<br>  
 Deare Sir, what euer that thou be in place:<br>  
 Enough is, that thy foe doth vanquisht stand<br>  
 Now at thy mercy: Mercie not withstand:<br>  
 For he is one the truest knight aliue,<br>  
 Though conquered now he lie on lowly land,<br>  
 And whilest him fortune fauourd, faire did thriue<br>
 In bloudie field: therefore of life him not depriue.</p><p>
  
 Her piteous words might not abate his rage,<br>  
 But rudely rending vp his helmet, would<br>  
 Haue slaine him straight: but when he sees his age,<br>  
 And hoarie head of <i>Archimago</i> old,<br>  
 His hastie hand he doth amazed hold,<br>  
 And halfe ashamed, wondred at the sight:<br>  
 For the old man well knew he, though vntold,<br>  
 In charmes and magicke to haue wondrous might,<br>
 Ne euer wont in field, ne in round lists to fight.</p><p>
  
 And said, Why <i>Archimago</i>, lucklesse syre,<br>  
 What doe I see? what hard mishap is this,<br>  
 That hath thee hither brought to taste mine yre?<br>  
 Or thine the fault, or mine the error is,<br>  
 In stead of foe to wound my friend amis?<br>  
 He answered nought, but in a traunce still lay,<br>  
 And on those guilefull dazed eyes of his<br>  
 The cloud of death did sit. Which doen away,<br>
 He left him lying so, ne would no lenger stay.</p><p>
  
 But to the virgin comes, who all this while<br>  
 Amased stands, her selfe so mockt to see<br>  
 By him, who has the guerdon of his guile,<br>  
 For so misfeigning her true knight to bee:<br>  
 Yet is she now in more perplexitie,<br>  
 Left in the hand of that same Paynim bold,<br>  
 From whom her booteth not at all to flie;<br>  
 Who by her cleanly garment catching hold,<br>
 Her from her Palfrey pluckt, her visage to behold.</p><p>
  
 But her fierce seruant full of kingly awe<br>  
 And high disdaine, whenas his soueraine Dame<br>  
 So rudely handled by her foe he sawe,<br>  
 With gaping iawes full greedy at him came,<br>  
 And ramping on his shield, did weene the same<br>  
 Haue reft away with his sharpe rending clawes:<br>  
 But he was stout, and lust did now inflame<br>  
 His corage more, that frõ his griping pawes<br>
 He hath his shield redeem'd, and foorth his sword he drawes.</p><p>
  
 O then too weake and feeble was the forse<br>  
 Of saluage beast, his puissance to withstand:<br>  
 For he was strong, and of so mightie corse,<br>  
 As euer wielded speare in warlike hand,<br>  
 And feates of armes did wisely vnderstand.<br>  
 Eftsoones he perced through his chaufed chest<br>  
 With thrilling point of deadly yron brand,<br>  
 And launcht his Lordly hart: with death opprest<br>
 He roar'd aloud, whiles life forsooke his stubborne brest.</p><p>
  
 Who now is left to keepe the forlorne maid<br>  
 From raging spoile of lawlesse victors will?<br>  
 Her faithfull gard remou'd, her hope dismaid,<br>  
 Her selfe a yeelded pray to saue or spill.<br>  
 He now Lord of the field, his pride to fill,<br>  
 With foule reproches, and disdainfull spight<br>  
 Her vildly entertaines, and will or nill,<br>  
 Beares her away vpon his courser light:<br>
 Her prayers nought preuaile, his rage is more of might.</p><p>
  
 And all the way, with great lamenting paine,<br>  
 And piteous plaints she filleth his dull eares,<br>  
 That stony hart could riuen haue in twaine,<br>  
 And all the way she wets with flowing teares:<br>  
 But he enrag'd with rancor, nothing heares.<br>  
 Her seruile beast yet would not leaue her so,<br>  
 But followes her farre off, ne ought he feares,<br>  
 To be partaker of her wandring woe,<br>
 More mild in beastly kind, then that her beastly foe.</p><p>
