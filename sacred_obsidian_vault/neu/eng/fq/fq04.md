 </p><p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>The guilefull great Enchaunter parts<br>
 The Redcrosse Knight from Truth:<br>
 Into whose stead faire falshood steps,<br>
 And workes him wofull ruth. </i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 BY this the Northerne wagoner had set<br>
    
 His seuenfold teme behind the stedfast starre,<br>
    
 That was in Ocean waues yet neuer wet,<br>
    
 But firme is fixt, and sendeth light from farre<br>
    
 To all, that in the wide deepe wandring arre:<br>
    
 And chearefull Chaunticlere with his note shrill<br>
    
 Had warned once, that <i>Phoebus</i> fiery carre<br>
    
 In hast was climbing vp the Easterne hill,<br>
 Full enuious that night so long his roome did fill.<p>
  
 When those accursed messengers of hell,<br>
    
 That feigning dreame, and that faire-forged Spright<br>
    
 Came to their wicked maister, and gan tell<br>
    
 Their bootelesse paines, and ill succeeding night:<br>
    
 Who all in rage to see his skilfull might<br>
    
 Deluded so, gan threaten hellish paine<br>
    
 And sad <i>Proserpines</i> wrath, them to affright.<br>
    
 But when he saw his threatning was but vaine,<br>
 He cast about, and searcht his balefull bookes againe.</p><p>
  
 Eftsoones he tooke that miscreated faire,<br>
    
 And that false other Spright, on whom he spred<br>
    
 A seeming body of the subtile aire,<br>
    
 Like a young Squire, in loues and lusty-hed<br>
    
 His wanton dayes that euer loosely led,<br>
    
 Without regard of armes and dreaded fight:<br>
    
 Those two he tooke, and in a secret bed,<br>
    
 Couered with darknesse and misdeeming night,<br>
 Them both together laid, to ioy in vaine delight.</p><p>
  
 Forthwith he runnes with feigned faithfull hast<br>
    
 Vnto his guest, who after troublous sights<br>
    
 And dreames, gan now to take more sound repast,<br>
    
 Whom suddenly he wakes with fearefull frights,<br>
    
 As one aghast with feends or damned sprights,<br>
    
 And to him cals, Rise rise vnhappy Swaine,<br>
    
 That here wex old in sleepe, whiles wicked wights<br>
    
 Haue knit themselues in <i>Venus</i> shamefull chaine;<br>
 Come see, where your false Lady doth her honour staine.</p><p>
  
 All in amaze he suddenly vp start<br>
    
 With sword in hand, and with the old man went;<br>
    
 Who soone him brought into a secret part,<br>
    
 Where that false couple were full closely ment<br>
    
 In wanton lust and lewd embracement:<br>
    
 Which when he saw, he burnt with gealous fire,<br>
    
 The eye of reason was with rage yblent,<br>
    
 And would haue slaine them in his furious ire,<br>
 But hardly was restreined of that aged sire.</p><p>
  
 Returning to his bed in torment great,<br>
    
 And bitter anguish of his guiltie sight,<br>
    
 He could not rest, but did his stout heart eat,<br>
    
 And wast his inward gall with deepe despight,<br>
    
 Yrkesome of life, and too long lingring night.<br>
    
 At last faire <i>Hesperus</i> in highest skie<br>
    
 Had spent his lampe, and brought forth dawning light,<br>
    
 Then vp he rose, and clad him hastily;<br>
 The Dwarfe him brought his steed: so both away do fly.</p><p>
  
 Now when the rosy-fingred Morning faire,<br>
    
 Weary of aged <i>Tithones</i> saffron bed,<br>
    
 Had spred her purple robe through deawy aire,<br>
    
 And the high hils <i>Titan</i> discouered,<br>
    
 The royall virgin shooke off drowsy-hed,<br>
    
 And rising forth out of her baser bowre,<br>
    
 Lookt for her knight, who far away was fled,<br>
    
 And for her Dwarfe, that wont to wait each houre;<br>
 Then gan she waile and weepe, to see that woefull stowre.</p><p>
  
 And after him she rode with so much speede<br>
    
 As her slow beast could make; but all in vaine:<br>
    
 For him so far had borne his light-foot steede,<br>
    
 Pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdaine,<br>
    
 That him to follow was but fruitlesse paine;<br>
    
 Yet she her weary limbes would neuer rest,<br>
    
 But euery hill and dale, each wood and plaine<br>
    
 Did search, sore grieued in her gentle brest,<br>
 He so vngently left her, whom she loued best.</p><p>
  
 But subtill <i>Archimago</i>, when his guests<br>
    
 He saw diuided into double parts,<br>
    
 And <i>Vna</i> wandring in woods and forrests,<br>
    
 Th'end of his drift, he praisd his diuelish arts,<br>
    
 That had such might ouer true meaning harts;<br>
    
 Yet rests not so, but other meanes doth make,<br>
    
 How he may worke vnto her further smarts:<br>
    
 For her he hated as the hissing snake,<br>
 And in her many troubles did most pleasure take.</p><p>
  
 He then deuisde himselfe how to disguise;<br>
    
 For by his mightie science he could take<br>
    
 As many formes and shapes in seeming wise,<br>
    
 As euer <i>Proteus</i> to himselfe could make:<br>
    
 Sometime a fowle, sometime a fish in lake,<br>
    
 Now like a foxe, now like a dragon fell,<br>
    
 That of himselfe he oft for feare would quake,<br>
    
 And oft would flie away.  O who can tell<br>
 The hidden power of herbes, and might of Magicke spell?</p><p>
  
 But now seemde best, the person to put on<br>
    
 Of that good knight, his late beguiled guest:<br>
    
 In mighty armes he was yclad anon,<br>
    
 And siluer shield vpon his coward brest<br>
    
 A bloudy crosse, and on his crauen crest<br>
    
 A bounch of haires discolourd diuersly:<br>
    
 Full iolly knight he seemde, and well addrest,<br>
    
 And when he sate vpon his courser free,<br>
 <i>Saint George</i> himself ye would haue deemed him to be.</p><p>
  
 But he the knight, whose semblaunt he did beare,<br>
    
 The true <i>Saint George</i> was wandred far away,<br>
    
 Still flying from his thoughts and gealous feare;<br>
    
 Will was his guide, and griefe led him astray.<br>
    
 At last him chaunst to meete vpon the way<br>
    
 A faithlesse Sarazin all arm'd to point,<br>
    
 In whose great shield was writ with letters gay<br>
    
 <i>Sans foy</i>: full large of limbe and euery ioint<br>
 He was, and cared not for God or man a point.</p><p>
  
 He had a faire companion of his way,<br>
    
 A goodly Lady clad in scarlot red,<br>
    
 Purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay,<br>
    
 And like a <i>Persian</i> mitre on her hed<br>
    
 She wore, with crownes and owches garnished,<br>
    
 The which her lauish louers to her gaue;<br>
    
 Her wanton palfrey all was ouerspred<br>
    
 With tinsell trappings, wouen like a waue,<br>
 Whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses braue.</p><p>
  
 With faire disport and courting dalliaunce<br>
    
 She intertainde her louer all the way:<br>
    
 But when she saw the knight his speare aduaunce,<br>
    
 She soone left off her mirth and wanton play,<br>
    
 And bad her knight addresse him to the fray:<br>
    
 His foe was nigh at hand. He prickt with pride<br>
    
 And hope to winne his Ladies heart that day,<br>
    
 Forth spurred fast: adowne his coursers side<br>
 The red bloud trickling staind the way, as he did ride.</p><p>
  
 The knight of the <i>Redcrosse</i> when him he spide,<br>
    
 Spurring so hote with rage dispiteous,<br>
    
 Gan fairely couch his speare, and towards ride:<br>
    
 Soone meete they both, both fell and furious,<br>
    
 That daunted with their forces hideous,<br>
    
 Their steeds do stagger, and amazed stand,<br>
    
 And eke themselues too rudely rigorous,<br>
    
 Astonied with the stroke of their owne hand,<br>
 Do backe rebut, and each to other yeeldeth land.</p><p>
  
 As when two rams stird with ambitious pride,<br>
    
 Fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flocke,<br>
    
 Their horned fronts so fierce on either side<br>
    
 Do meete, that with the terrour of the shocke<br>
    
 Astonied both, stand sencelesse as a blocke,<br>
    
 Forgetfull of the hanging victory:<br>
    
 So stood these twaine, vnmoued as a rocke,<br>
    
 Both staring fierce, and holding idely<br>
 The broken reliques of their former cruelty.</p><p>
  
 The <i>Sarazin</i> sore daunted with the buffe<br>
    
 Snatcheth his sword, and fiercely to him flies;<br>
    
 Who well it wards, and quyteth cuff with cuff:<br>
    
 Each others equall puissaunce enuies,<br>
    
 And through their iron sides with cruell spies<br>
    
 Does seeke to perce: repining courage yields<br>
    
 No foote to foe. The flashing fier flies<br>
    
 As from a forge out of their burning shields,<br>
 And streames of purple bloud new dies the verdant fields.</p><p>
  
 Curse on that Crosse (quoth then the <i>Sarazin</i>)<br>
    
 That keepes thy body from the bitter fit;<br>
    
 Dead long ygoe I wote thou haddest bin,<br>
    
 Had not that charme from thee forwarned it:<br>
    
 But yet I warne thee now assured sitt,<br>
    
 And hide thy head. Therewith vpon his crest<br>
    
 With rigour so outrageous he smitt,<br>
    
 That a large share it hewd out of the rest,<br>
 And glauncing downe his shield, from blame him fairely blest.</p><p>
  
 Who thereat wondrous wroth, the sleeping spark<br>
    
 Of natiue vertue gan eftsoones reuiue,<br>
    
 And at his haughtie helmet making mark,<br>
    
 So hugely stroke, that it the steele did riue,<br>
    
 And cleft his head. He tumbling downe aliue,<br>
    
 With bloudy mouth his mother earth did kis,<br>
    
 Greeting his graue: his grudging ghost did striue<br>
    
 With the fraile flesh; at last it flitted is,<br>
 Whither the soules do fly of men, that liue amis.</p><p>
  
 The Lady when she saw her champion fall,<br>
    
 Like the old ruines of a broken towre,<br>
    
 Staid not to waile his woefull funerall,<br>
    
 But from him fled away with all her powre;<br>
    
 Who after her as hastily gan scowre,<br>
    
 Bidding the Dwarfe with him to bring away<br>
    
 The <i>Sarazins</i> shield, signe of the conqueroure.<br>
    
 Her soone he ouertooke, and bad to stay,<br>
 For present cause was none of dread her to dismay.</p><p>
  
 She turning backe with ruefull countenaunce,<br>
    
 Cride, Mercy mercy Sir vouchsafe to show<br>
    
 On silly Dame, subiect to hard mischaunce,<br>
    
 And to your mighty will. Her humblesse low<br>
    
 In so ritch weedes and seeming glorious show,<br>
    
 Did much emmoue his stout hero¨icke heart,<br>
    
 And said, Deare dame, your suddein ouerthrow<br>
    
 Much rueth me; but now put feare apart,<br>
 And tell, both who ye be, and who that tooke your part.</p><p>
  
 Melting in teares, then gan she thus lament;<br>
    
 The wretched woman, whom vnhappy howre<br>
    
 Hath now made thrall to your commandement,<br>
    
 Before that angry heauens list to lowre,<br>
    
 And fortune false betraide me to your powre,<br>
    
 Was, (O what now auaileth that I was!)<br>
    
 Borne the sole daughter of an Emperour,<br>
    
 He that the wide West vnder his rule has,<br>
 And high hath set his throne, where <i>Tiberis</i> doth pas.</p><p>
  
 He in the first flowre of my freshest age,<br>
    
 Betrothed me vnto the onely haire<br>
    
 Of a most mighty king, most rich and sage;<br>
    
 Was neuer Prince so faithfull and so faire,<br>
    
 Was neuer Prince so meeke and debonaire;<br>
    
 But ere my hoped day of spousall shone,<br>
    
 My dearest Lord fell from high honours staire,<br>
    
 Into the hands of his accursed fone,<br>
 And cruelly was slaine, that shall I euer mone.</p><p>
  
 His blessed body spoild of liuely breath,<br>
    
 Was afterward, I know not how, conuaid<br>
    
 And fro me hid: of whose most innocent death<br>
    
 When tidings came to me vnhappy maid,<br>
    
 O how great sorrow my sad soule assaid.<br>
    
 Then forth I went his woefull corse to find,<br>
    
 And many yeares throughout the world I straid,<br>
    
 A virgin widow, whose deepe wounded mind<br>
 With loue, long time did languish as the striken hind.</p><p>
  
 At last it chaunced this proud <i>Sarazin</i><br>
    
 To meete me wandring, who perforce me led<br>
    
 With him away, but yet could neuer win<br>
    
 The Fort, that Ladies hold in soueraigne dread.<br>
    
 There lies he now with foule dishonour dead,<br>
    
 Who whiles he liu'de, was called proud <i>Sans foy</i>,<br>
    
 The eldest of three brethren, all three bred<br>
    
 Of one bad sire, whose youngest is <i>Sans ioy</i>,<br>
 And twixt them both was borne the bloudy bold <i>Sans loy</i>.</p><p>
  
 In this sad plight, friendlesse, vnfortunate,<br>
    
 Now miserable I <i>Fidessa</i> dwell,<br>
    
 Crauing of you in pitty of my state,<br>
    
 To do none ill, if please ye not do well.<br>
    
 He in great passion all this while did dwell,<br>
    
 More busying his quicke eyes, her face to view,<br>
    
 Then his dull eares, to heare what she did tell;<br>
    
 And said, Faire Lady hart of flint would rew<br>
 The vndeserued woes and sorrowes, which ye shew.</p><p>
  
 Henceforth in safe assuraunce may ye rest,<br>
    
 Hauing both found a new friend you to aid,<br>
    
 And lost an old foe, that did you molest:<br>
    
 Better new friend then an old foe is said.<br>
    
 With chaunge of cheare the seeming simple maid<br>
    
 Let fall her eyen, as shamefast to the earth,<br>
    
 And yeelding soft, in that she nought gain-said,<br>
    
 So forth they rode, he feining seemely merth,<br>
 And she coy lookes: so dainty they say maketh derth.</p><p>
  
 Long time they thus together traueiled,<br>
    
 Till weary of their way, they came at last,<br>
    
 Where grew two goodly trees, that faire did spred<br>
    
 Their armes abroad, with gray mosse ouercast,<br>
    
 And their greene leaues trembling with euery blast,<br>
    
 Made a calme shadow far in compasse round:<br>
    
 The fearefull Shepheard often there aghast<br>
    
 Vnder them neuer sat, ne wont there sound<br>
 His mery oaten pipe, but shund th'vnlucky ground.</p><p>
  
 But this good knight soone as he them can spie,<br>
    
 For the coole shade him thither hastly got:<br>
    
 For golden <i>Phoebus</i> now ymounted hie,<br>
    
 From fiery wheeles of his faire chariot<br>
    
 Hurled his beame so scorching cruell hot,<br>
    
 That liuing creature mote it not abide;<br>
    
 And his new Lady it endured not.<br>
    
 There they alight, in hope themselues to hide<br>
 From the fierce heat, and rest their weary limbs a tide.</p><p>
  
 Faire seemely pleasaunce each to other makes,<br>
    
 With goodly purposes there as they sit:<br>
    
 And in his falsed fancy he her takes<br>
    
 To be the fairest wight, that liued yit;<br>
    
 Which to expresse, he bends his gentle wit,<br>
    
 And thinking of those braunches greene to frame<br>
    
 A girlond for her dainty forehead fit,<br>
    
 He pluckt a bough; out of whose rift there came<br>
 Small drops of gory bloud, that trickled downe the same.</p><p>
  
 Therewith a piteous yelling voyce was heard,<br>
    
 Crying, O spare with guilty hands to teare<br>
    
 My tender sides in this rough rynd embard,<br>
    
 But fly, ah fly far hence away, for feare<br>
    
 Least to you hap, that happened to me heare,<br>
    
 And to this wretched Lady, my deare loue,<br>
    
 O too deare loue, loue bought with death too deare.<br>
    
 Astond he stood, and vp his haire did houe,<br>
 And with that suddein horror could no member moue.</p><p>
  
 At last whenas the dreadfull passion<br>
    
 Was ouerpast, and manhood well awake,<br>
    
 Yet musing at the straunge occasion,<br>
    
 And doubting much his sence, he thus bespake;<br>
    
 What voyce of damned Ghost from <i>Limbo</i> lake,<br>
    
 Or guilefull spright wandring in empty aire,<br>
    
 Both which fraile men do oftentimes mistake,<br>
    
 Sends to my doubtfull eares these speaches rare,<br>
 And ruefull plaints, me bidding guiltlesse bloud to spare?</p><p>
  
 Then groning deepe, Nor damned Ghost, (quoth he,)<br>
    
 Nor guilefull sprite, to thee these wordes doth speake,<br>
    
 But once a man <i>Fradubio</i>, now a tree,<br>
    
 Wretched man, wretched tree; whose nature weake,<br>
    
 A cruell witch her cursed will to wreake,<br>
    
 Hath thus transformd, and plast in open plaines,<br>
    
 Where <i>Boreas</i> doth blow full bitter bleake,<br>
    
 And scorching Sunne does dry my secret vaines:<br>
 For though a tree I seeme, yet cold and heat me paines.</p><p>
  
 Say on <i>Fradubio</i> then, or man, or tree,<br>
    
 Quoth then the knight, by whose mischieuous arts<br>
    
 Art thou misshaped thus, as now I see?<br>
    
 He oft finds med'cine, who his griefe imparts;<br>
    
 But double griefs afflict concealing harts,<br>
    
 As raging flames who striueth to suppresse.<br>
    
 The author then (said he) of all my smarts,<br>
    
 Is one <i>Duessa</i> a false sorceresse,<br>
 That many errãt knights hath brought to wretchednesse.</p><p>
  
 In prime of youthly yeares, when corage hot<br>
    
 The fire of loue and ioy of cheualree<br>
    
 First kindled in my brest, it was my lot<br>
    
 To loue this gentle Lady, whom ye see,<br>
    
 Now not a Lady, but a seeming tree;<br>
    
 With whom as once I rode accompanyde,<br>
    
 Me chaunced of a knight encountred bee,<br>
    
 That had a like faire Lady by his syde,<br>
 Like a faire Lady, but did fowle <i>Duessa</i> hyde.</p><p>
  
 Whose forged beauty he did take in hand,<br>
    
 All other Dames to haue exceeded farre;<br>
    
 I in defence of mine did likewise stand,<br>
    
 Mine, that did then shine as the Morning starre:<br>
    
 So both to battell fierce arraunged arre,<br>
    
 In which his harder fortune was to fall<br>
    
 Vnder my speare: such is the dye of warre:<br>
    
 His Lady left as a prise martiall,<br>
 Did yield her comely person, to be at my call.</p><p>
  
 So doubly lou'd of Ladies vnlike faire,<br>
    
 Th'one seeming such, the other such indeede,<br>
    
 One day in doubt I cast for to compare,<br>
    
 Whether in beauties glorie did exceede;<br>
    
 A Rosy girlond was the victors meede:<br>
    
 Both seemde to win, and both seemde won to bee,<br>
    
 So hard the discord was to be agreede.<br>
    
 <i>Frælissa</i> was as faire, as faire mote bee,<br>
 And euer false <i>Duessa</i> seemde as faire as shee.</p><p>
  
 The wicked witch now seeing all this while<br>
    
 The doubtfull ballaunce equally to sway,<br>
    
 What not by right, she cast to win by guile,<br>
    
 And by her hellish science raisd streightway<br>
    
 A foggy mist, that ouercast the day,<br>
    
 And a dull blast, that breathing on her face,<br>
    
 Dimmed her former beauties shining ray,<br>
    
 And with foule vgly forme did her disgrace:<br>
 Then was she faire alone, when none was faire in place.</p><p>
  
 Then cride she out, Fye, fye, deformed wight,<br>
    
 Whose borrowed beautie now appeareth plaine<br>
    
 To haue before bewitched all mens sight;<br>
    
 O leaue her soone, or let her soone be slaine.<br>
    
 Her loathly visage viewing with disdaine,<br>
    
 Eftsoones I thought her such, as she me told,<br>
    
 And would haue kild her; but with faigned paine,<br>
    
 The false witch did my wrathfull hand with-hold;<br>
 So left her, where she now is turnd to treen mould.</p><p>
  
 Thensforth I tooke <i>Duessa</i> for my Dame,<br>
    
 And in the witch vnweeting ioyd long time,<br>
    
 Ne euer wist, but that she was the same,<br>
    
 Till on a day (that day is euery Prime,<br>
    
 When Witches wont do penance for their crime)<br>
    
 I chaunst to see her in her proper hew,<br>
    
 Bathing her selfe in origane and thyme:<br>
    
 A filthy foule old woman I did vew,<br>
 That euer to haue toucht her, I did deadly rew.</p><p>
  
 Her neather partes misshapen, monstruous,<br>
    
 Were hidd in water, that I could not see,<br>
    
 But they did seeme more foule and hideous,<br>
    
 Then womans shape man would beleeue to bee.<br>
    
 Thensforth from her most beastly companie<br>
    
 I gan refraine, in minde to slip away,<br>
    
 Soone as appeard safe opportunitie:<br>
    
 For danger great, if not assur'd decay<br>
 I saw before mine eyes, if I were knowne to stray.</p><p>
  
 The diuelish hag by chaunges of my cheare<br>
    
 Perceiu'd my thought, and drownd in sleepie night,<br>
    
 With wicked herbes and ointments did besmeare<br>
    
 My bodie all, through charmes and magicke might,<br>
    
 That all my senses were bereaued quight:<br>
    
 Then brought she me into this desert waste,<br>
    
 And by my wretched louers side me pight,<br>
    
 Where now enclosd in wooden wals full faste,<br>
 Banisht from liuing wights, our wearie dayes we waste.</p><p>
  
 But how long time, said then the Elfin knight,<br>
    
 Are you in this misformed house to dwell?<br>
    
 We may not chaunge (quoth he) this euil plight,<br>
    
 Till we be bathed in a liuing well;<br>
    
 That is the terme prescribed by the spell.<br>
    
 O how, said he, mote I that well out find,<br>
    
 That may restore you to your wonted well?<br>
    
 Time and suffised fates to former kynd<br>
 Shall vs restore, none else from hence may vs vnbynd.</p><p>
  
 The false <i>Duessa</i>, now <i>Fidessa</i> hight,<br>
    
 Heard how in vaine <i>Fradubio</i> did lament,<br>
    
 And knew well all was true. But the good knight<br>
    
 Full of sad feare and ghastly dreriment,<br>
    
 When all this speech the liuing tree had spent,<br>
    
 The bleeding bough did thrust into the ground,<br>
    
 That from the bloud he might be innocent,<br>
    
 And with fresh clay did close the wooden wound:<br>
 Then turning to his Lady, dead with feare her found.</p><p>
  
 Her seeming dead he found with feigned feare,<br>
    
 As all vnweeting of that well she knew,<br>
    
 And paynd himselfe with busie care to reare<br>
    
 Her out of carelesse swowne. Her eylids blew<br>
    
 And dimmed sight with pale and deadly hew<br>
    
 At last she vp gan lift: with trembling cheare<br>
    
 Her vp he tooke, too simple and too trew,<br>
 And oft her kist. At length all passed feare,<br>
 He set her on her steede, and forward forth did beare.</p><p>
