 <br>  FAERIE QVEENE. </p><p> 
 <i>Contayning</i><br>  THE LEGEND OF SIR GVYON.<br>  
 <br> <i>OR</i><br> OF TEMPERAUNCE.</p><p> </p></center> 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 R
 Ight well I wote most mighty Soueraine,<br>
 That all this famous antique history,<br>
 Of some th'aboundance of an idle braine<br>
 Will iudged be, and painted forgery,<br>
 Rather then matter of iust memory,<br>
 Sith none, that breatheth liuing aire, does know,<br>
 Where is that happy land of Faery,<br>
 Which I so much do vaunt, yet no where show,<br>
 But vouch antiquities, which no body can know.<p>
  
 But let that man with better sence aduize,<br>
 That of the world least part to vs is red:<br>
 And dayly how through hardy enterprize,<br>
 Many great Regions are discouered,<br>
 Which to late age were neuer mentioned.<br>
 Who euer heard of th'Indian <i>Peru</i>?<br>
 Or who in venturous vessell measured<br>
 The <i>Amazon</i> huge riuer now found trew?<br>
 Or fruitfullest <i>Virginia</i> who did euer vew?</p><p>
  
 Yet all these were, when no man did them know;<br>
 Yet haue from wisest ages hidden beene:<br>
 And later times things more vnknowne shall show.<br>
 Why then should witlesse man so much misweene<br>
 That nothing is, but that which he hath seene?<br>
 What if within the Moones faire shining spheare?<br>
 What if in euery other starre vnseene<br>
 Of other worldes he happily should heare?<br>
 He wõder would much more: yet such to some appeare.</p><p>
  
 Of Faerie lond yet if he more inquire,<br>
 By certaine signes here set in sundry place<br>
 He may it find; ne let him then admire,<br>
 But yield his sence to be too blunt and bace,<br>
 That no'te without an hound fine footing trace.<br>
 And thou, O fairest Princesse vnder sky,<br>
 In this faire mirrhour maist behold thy face,<br>
 And thine owne realmes in lond of Faery,<br>
 And in this antique Image thy great auncestry.</p><p>
  
 The which O pardon me thus to enfold<br>
 In couert vele, and wrap in shadowes light,<br>
 That feeble eyes your glory may behold,<br>
 Which else could not endure those beames bright,<br>
 But would be dazled with exceeding light.<br>
 O pardon, and vouchsafe with patient eare<br>
 The braue aduentures of this Faery knight<br>
 The good Sir <i>Guyon</i> gratiously to heare,<br>
 In whom great rule of Temp'raunce goodly doth appeare.</p><p>
