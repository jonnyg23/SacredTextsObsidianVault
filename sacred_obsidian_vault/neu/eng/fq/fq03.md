 <center>  <i>Canto I.</i> </center><p> 
  
 </p><p> 
 </p><blockquote>
 <i> The Patron of true Holinesse,<br> 
 Foule Errour doth defeate:<br> 
 Hypocrisie him to entrappe,<br>
 Doth to his home entreate.</i>   <p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 A Gentle Knight was pricking on 
 the plaine,<br> 
    
 Y cladd in mightie armes and siluer shielde,<br>
    
 Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,<br>
    
 The cruell markes of many' a bloudy fielde;<br>
    
 Yet armes till that time did he neuer wield:<br>
    
 His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,<br>
    
 As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:<br>
    
 Full iolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,<br>
 As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.<p>
  
 But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,<br>
    
 The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,<br>
    
 For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,<br>
    
 And dead as liuing euer him ador'd:<br>
    
 Vpon his shield the like was also scor'd,<br>
    
 For soueraine hope, which in his helpe he had:<br>
    
 Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,<br>
    
 But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;<br>
 Yet nothing did he dread, but euer was ydrad.</p><p>
  
 Vpon a great aduenture he was bond,<br>
    
 That greatest <i>Gloriana</i> to him gaue,<br>
    
 That greatest Glorious Queene of <i>Faerie</i> lond,<br>
    
 To winne him worship, and her grace to haue,<br>
    
 Which of all earthly things he most did craue;<br>
    
 And euer as he rode, his hart did earne<br>
    
 To proue his puissance in battell braue<br>
    
 Vpon his foe, and his new force to learne;<br>
 Vpon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.</p><p>
  
 A louely Ladie rode him faire beside,<br>
    
 Vpon a lowly Asse more white then snow,<br>
    
 Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide<br>
    
 Vnder a vele, that wimpled was full low,<br>
    
 And ouer all a blacke stole she did throw,<br>
    
 As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,<br>
    
 And heauie sat vpon her palfrey slow:<br>
    
 Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,<br>
 And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.</p><p>
  
 So pure and innocent, as that same lambe,<br>
    
 She was in life and euery vertuous lore,<br>
    
 And by descent from Royall lynage came<br>
    
 Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore<br>
    
 Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,<br>
    
 And all the world in their subiection held;<br>
    
 Till that infernall feend with foule vprore<br>
    
 Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:<br>
 Whom to auenge, she had this Knight from far cõpeld.</p><p>
  
 Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,<br>
    
 That lasie seemd in being euer last,<br>
    
 Or wearied with bearing of her bag<br>
    
 Of needments at his backe.  Thus as they past,<br>
    
 The day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast,<br>
    
 And angry <i>Ioue</i> an hideous storme of raine<br>
    
 Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,<br>
    
 That euery wight to shrowd it did constrain,<br>
 And this faire couple eke to shroud thẽselues were fain.</p><p>
  
 Enforst to seeke some couert nigh at hand,<br>
    
 A shadie groue not far away they spide,<br>
    
 That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:<br>
    
 Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,<br>
    
 Did spred so broad, that heauens light did hide,<br>
    
 Not perceable with power of any starre:<br>
    
 And all within were pathes and alleies wide,<br>
    
 With footing worne, and leading inward farre:<br>
 Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.</p><p>
  
 And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,<br>
    
 Ioying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,<br>
    
 Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,<br>
    
 Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.<br>
    
 Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,<br>
    
 The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,<br>
    
 The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar neuer dry,<br>
    
 The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,<br>
 The Aspine good for staues, the Cypresse funerall.</p><p>
  
 The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours<br>
    
 And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,<br>
    
 The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,<br>
    
 The Eugh obedient to the benders will,<br>
    
 The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,<br>
    
 The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,<br>
    
 The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,<br>
    
 The fruitfull Oliue, and the Platane round,<br>
 The caruer Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.</p><p>
  
 Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,<br>
    
 Vntill the blustring storme is ouerblowne;<br>
    
 When weening to returne, whence they did stray,<br>
    
 They cannot finde that path, which first was showne,<br>
    
 But wander too and fro in wayes vnknowne,<br>
    
 Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,<br>
    
 That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:<br>
    
 So many pathes, so many turnings seene,<br>
 That which of them to take, in diuerse doubt they been.</p><p>
  
 At last resoluing forward still to fare,<br>
    
 Till that some end they finde or in or out,<br>
    
 That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,<br>
    
 And like to lead the labyrinth about;<br>
    
 Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,<br>
    
 At length it brought them to a hollow caue,<br>
    
 Amid the thickest woods.  The Champion stout<br>
    
 Eftsoones dismounted from his courser braue,<br>
 And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gaue.</p><p>
  
 Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,<br>
    
 Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash prouoke:<br>
    
 The danger hid, the place vnknowne and wilde,<br>
    
 Breedes dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,<br>
    
 And perill without show: therefore your stroke<br>
    
 Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.<br>
    
 Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to reuoke<br>
    
 The forward footing for an hidden shade:<br>
 Vertue giues her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.</p><p>
  
 Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place<br>
    
 I better wot then you, though now too late<br>
    
 To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,<br>
    
 Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,<br>
    
 To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.<br>
    
 This is the wandring wood, this <i>Errours den</i>,<br>
    
 A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:<br>
    
 Therefore I read beware.  Fly fly (quoth then<br>
 The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for liuing men.</p><p>
  
 But full of fire and greedy hardiment,<br>
    
 The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,<br>
    
 But forth vnto the darksome hole he went,<br>
    
 And looked in: his glistring armor made<br>
    
 A litle glooming light, much like a shade,<br>
    
 By which he saw the vgly monster plaine,<br>
    
 Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,<br>
    
 But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,<br>
 Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.</p><p>
  
 And as she lay vpon the durtie ground,<br>
    
 Her huge long taile her den all ouerspred,<br>
    
 Yet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound,<br>
    
 Pointed with mortall sting.  Of her there bred<br>
    
 A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,<br>
    
 Sucking vpon her poisonous dugs, each one<br>
    
 Of sundry shapes, yet all ill fauored:<br>
    
 Soone as that vncouth light vpon them shone,<br>
 Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.</p><p>
  
 Their dam vpstart, out of her den effraide,<br>
    
 And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile<br>
    
 About her cursed head, whose folds displaid<br>
    
 Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.<br>
    
 She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle<br>
    
 Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;<br>
    
 For light she hated as the deadly bale,<br>
    
 Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,<br>
 Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.</p><p>
  
 Which when the valiant Elfe perceiu'd, he lept<br>
    
 As Lyon fierce vpon the flying pray,<br>
    
 And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept<br>
    
 From turning backe, and forced her to stay:<br>
    
 Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,<br>
    
 And turning fierce, her speckled taile aduaunst,<br>
    
 Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:<br>
    
 Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:<br>
 The stroke down frõ her head vnto her shoulder glaunst.</p><p>
  
 Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,<br>
    
 Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,<br>
    
 And all attonce her beastly body raizd<br>
    
 With doubled forces high aboue the ground:<br>
    
 Tho wrapping vp her wrethed sterne arownd,<br>
    
 Lept fierce vpon his shield, and her huge traine<br>
    
 All suddenly about his body wound,<br>
    
 That hand or foot to stirre he stroue in vaine:<br>
 God helpe the man so wrapt in <i>Errours</i> endlesse traine.</p><p>
  
 His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,<br>
    
 Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,<br>
    
 Add faith vnto your force, and be not faint:<br>
    
 Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.<br>
    
 That when he heard, in great perplexitie,<br>
    
 His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,<br>
    
 And knitting all his force got one hand free,<br>
    
 Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,<br>
 That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.</p><p>
  
 Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw<br>
    
 A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,<br>
    
 Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,<br>
    
 Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke<br>
    
 His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:<br>
    
 Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,<br>
    
 With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,<br>
    
 And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:<br>
 Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.</p><p>
  
 As when old father <i>Nilus</i> gins to swell<br>
    
 With timely pride aboue the <i>Aegyptian</i> vale,<br>
    
 His fattie waues do fertile slime outwell,<br>
    
 And ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale:<br>
    
 But when his later spring gins to auale,<br>
    
 Huge heapes of mudd he leaues, wherein there breed<br>
    
 Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male<br>
    
 And partly female of his fruitfull seed;<br>
 Such vgly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed.</p><p>
  
 The same so sore annoyed has the knight,<br>
    
 That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,<br>
    
 His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.<br>
    
 Whose corage when the feend perceiu'd to shrinke,<br>
    
 She poured forth out of her hellish sinke<br>
    
 Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,<br>
    
 Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,<br>
    
 Which swarming all about his legs did crall,<br>
 And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.</p><p>
  
 As gentle Shepheard in sweete euen-tide,<br>
    
 When ruddy <i>Phoebus</i> gins to welke in west,<br>
    
 High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,<br>
    
 Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;<br>
    
 A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,<br>
    
 All striuing to infixe their feeble stings,<br>
    
 That from their noyance he no where can rest,<br>
    
 But with his clownish hands their tender wings<br>
 He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.</p><p>
  
 Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,<br>
    
 Then of the certaine perill he stood in,<br>
    
 Halfe furious vnto his foe he came,<br>
    
 Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,<br>
    
 Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;<br>
    
 And strooke at her with more then manly force,<br>
    
 That from her body full of filthie sin<br>
    
 He raft her hatefull head without remorse;<br>
 A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed frõ her corse.</p><p>
  
 Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare<br>
    
 They saw so rudely falling to the ground,<br>
    
 Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,<br>
    
 Gathred themselues about her body round,<br>
    
 Weening their wonted entrance to haue found<br>
    
 At her wide mouth: but being there withstood<br>
    
 They flocked all about her bleeding wound,<br>
    
 And sucked vp their dying mothers blood,<br>
 Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.</p><p>
  
 That detestable sight him much amazde,<br>
    
 To see th'vnkindly Impes of heauen accurst,<br>
    
 Deuoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,<br>
    
 Hauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst,<br>
    
 Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,<br>
    
 And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end<br>
    
 Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;<br>
    
 Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,<br>
 His foes haue slaine themselues, with whom he should contend.</p><p>
  
 His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre<br>
    
 Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,<br>
    
 And said, Faire knight, borne vnder happy starre,<br>
    
 Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:<br>
    
 Well worthy be you of that Armorie,<br>
    
 Wherein ye haue great glory wonne this day,<br>
    
 And proou'd your strength on a strong enimie,<br>
    
 Your first aduenture: many such I pray,<br>
 And henceforth euer wish, that like succeed it may.</p><p>
  
 Then mounted he vpon his Steede againe,<br>
    
 And with the Lady backward sought to wend;<br>
    
 That path he kept, which beaten was most plaine,<br>
    
 Ne euer would to any by-way bend,<br>
    
 But still did follow one vnto the end,<br>
    
 The which at last out of the wood them brought.<br>
    
 So forward on his way (with God to frend)<br>
    
 He passed forth, and new aduenture sought;<br>
 Long way he trauelled, before he heard of ought.</p><p>
  
 At length they chaunst to meet vpon the way<br>
    
 An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,<br>
    
 His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,<br>
    
 And by his belt his booke he hanging had;<br>
    
 Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,<br>
    
 And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,<br>
    
 Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,<br>
    
 And all the way he prayed, as he went,<br>
 And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.</p><p>
  
 He faire the knight saluted, louting low,<br>
    
 Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:<br>
    
 And after asked him, if he did know<br>
    
 Of straunge aduentures, which abroad did pas.<br>
    
 Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,<br>
    
 Silly old man, that liues in hidden cell,<br>
    
 Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,<br>
    
 Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?<br>
 With holy father sits not with such things to mell.</p><p>
  
 But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,<br>
    
 And homebred euill ye desire to heare,<br>
    
 Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,<br>
    
 That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.<br>
    
 Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,<br>
    
 And shall you well reward to shew the place,<br>
    
 In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:<br>
    
 For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,<br>
 That such a cursed creature liues so long a space.</p><p>
  
 Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse<br>
    
 His dwelling is, by which no liuing wight<br>
    
 May euer passe, but thorough great distresse.<br>
    
 Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,<br>
    
 And well I wote, that of your later fight<br>
    
 Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,<br>
    
 But wanting rest will also want of might?<br>
    
 The Sunne that measures heauen all day long,<br>
 At night doth baite his steedes the <i>Ocean</i> waues emong.</p><p>
  
 Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,<br>
    
 And with new day new worke at once begin:<br>
    
 Vntroubled night they say giues counsell best.<br>
    
 Right well Sir knight ye haue aduised bin,<br>
    
 (Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win<br>
    
 Is wisely to aduise: now day is spent;<br>
    
 Therefore with me ye may take vp your In<br>
    
 For this same night.  The knight was well content:<br>
 So with that godly father to his home they went.</p><p>
  
 A little lowly Hermitage it was,<br>
    
 Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,<br>
    
 Far from resort of people, that did pas<br>
    
 In trauell to and froe: a little wyde<br>
    
 There was an holy Chappell edifyde,<br>
    
 Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say<br>
    
 His holy things each morne and euentyde:<br>
    
 Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,<br>
 Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.</p><p>
  
 Arriued there, the little house they fill,<br>
    
 Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:<br>
    
 Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;<br>
    
 The noblest mind the best contentment has.<br>
    
 With faire discourse the euening so they pas:<br>
    
 For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,<br>
    
 And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;<br>
    
 He told of Saintes and Popes, and euermore<br>
 He strowd an <i>Aue-Mary</i> after and before.</p><p>
  
 The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,<br>
    
 And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,<br>
    
 As messenger of <i>Morpheus</i> on them cast<br>
    
 Sweet slõbring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.<br>
    
 Vnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:<br>
    
 Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,<br>
    
 He to his study goes, and there amiddes<br>
    
 His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,<br>
 He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes</p><p>
  
 Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,<br>
    
 (Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,<br>
    
 With which and other spelles like terrible,<br>
    
 He bad awake blacke <i>Plutoes</i> griesly Dame,<br>
    
 And cursed heauen, and spake reprochfull shame<br>
    
 Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;<br>
    
 A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name<br>
    
 Great <i>Gorgon</i>, Prince of darknesse and dead night,<br>
 At which <i>Cocytus</i> quakes, and <i>Styx</i> is put to flight.</p><p>
  
 And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred<br>
    
 Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes<br>
    
 Fluttring about his euer damned hed,<br>
    
 A-waite whereto their seruice he applyes,<br>
    
 To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:<br>
    
 Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,<br>
    
 And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;<br>
    
 The one of them he gaue a message too,<br>
 The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.</p><p>
  
 He making speedy way through spersed ayre,<br>
    
 And through the world of waters wide and deepe,<br>
    
 To <i>Morpheus</i> house doth hastily repaire.<br>
    
 Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,<br>
    
 And low, where dawning day doth neuer peepe,<br>
    
 His dwelling is; there <i>Tethys</i> his wet bed<br>
    
 Doth euer wash, and <i>Cynthia</i> still doth steepe<br>
    
 In siluer deaw his euer-drouping hed,<br>
 Whiles sad Night ouer him her mãtle black doth spred</p><p>
  
 Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,<br>
    
 The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yuory,<br>
    
 The other all with siluer ouercast;<br>
    
 And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye,<br>
    
 Watching to banish Care their enimy,<br>
    
 Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.<br>
    
 By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,<br>
    
 And vnto <i>Morpheus</i> comes, whom drowned deepe<br>
 In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.</p><p>
  
 And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,<br>
    
 A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe<br>
    
 And euer-drizling raine vpon the loft,<br>
    
 Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne<br>
    
 Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:<br>
    
 No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,<br>
    
 As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,<br>
    
 Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,<br>
 Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.</p><p>
  
 The messenger approching to him spake,<br>
    
 But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:<br>
    
 So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.<br>
    
 Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,<br>
    
 Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe<br>
    
 Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.<br>
    
 As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine<br>
    
 Is tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,<br>
 He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.</p><p>
  
 The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,<br>
    
 And threatned vnto him the dreaded name<br>
    
 Of <i>Hecate</i>: whereat he gan to quake,<br>
    
 And lifting vp his lompish head, with blame<br>
    
 Halfe angry asked him, for what he came.<br>
    
 Hither (quoth he) me <i>Archimago</i> sent,<br>
    
 He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,<br>
    
 He bids thee to him send for his intent<br>
 A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.</p><p>
  
 The God obayde, and calling forth straight way<br>
    
 A diuerse dreame out of his prison darke,<br>
    
 Deliuered it to him, and downe did lay<br>
    
 His heauie head, deuoide of carefull carke,<br>
    
 Whose sences all were straight benumbd and starke.<br>
    
 He backe returning by the Yuorie dore,<br>
    
 Remounted vp as light as chearefull Larke,<br>
    
 And on his litle winges the dreame he bore<br>
 In hast vnto his Lord, where he him left afore.</p><p>
  
 Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes,<br>
    
 Had made a Lady of that other Spright,<br>
    
 And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes<br>
    
 So liuely, and so like in all mens sight,<br>
    
 That weaker sence it could haue rauisht quight:<br>
    
 The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,<br>
    
 Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:<br>
    
 Her all in white he clad, and ouer it<br>
 Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for <i>Vna</i> fit.</p><p>
  
 Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought,<br>
    
 Vnto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,<br>
    
 Where he slept soundly void of euill thought,<br>
    
 And with false shewes abuse his fantasy,<br>
    
 In sort as he him schooled priuily:<br>
    
 And that new creature borne without her dew,<br>
    
 Full of the makers guile, with vsage sly<br>
    
 He taught to imitate that Lady trew,<br>
 Whose semblance she did carrie vnder feigned hew.</p><p>
  
 Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast,<br>
    
 And comming where the knight in slomber lay,<br>
    
 The one vpon his hardy head him plast,<br>
    
 And made him dreame of loues and lustfull play,<br>
    
 That nigh his manly hart did melt away,<br>
    
 Bathed in wanton blis and wicked ioy:<br>
    
 Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,<br>
    
 And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,<br>
 Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.</p><p>
  
 And she her selfe of beautie soueraigne Queene,<br>
    
 Faire <i>Venus</i> seemde vnto his bed to bring<br>
    
 Her, whom he waking euermore did weene,<br>
    
 To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring<br>
    
 On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,<br>
    
 Now a loose Leman to vile seruice bound:<br>
    
 And eke the <i>Graces</i> seemed all to sing,<br>
    
 <i>Hymen iô Hymen</i>, dauncing all around,<br>
 Whilst freshest <i>Flora</i> her with Yuie girlond crownd.</p><p>
  
 In this great passion of vnwonted lust,<br>
    
 Or wonted feare of doing ought amis,<br>
    
 He started vp, as seeming to mistrust,<br>
    
 Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:<br>
    
 Lo there before his face his Lady is,<br>
    
 Vnder blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,<br>
    
 And as halfe blushing offred him to kis,<br>
    
 With gentle blandishment and louely looke,<br>
 Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.</p><p>
  
 All cleane dismayd to see so vncouth sight,<br>
    
 And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,<br>
    
 He thought haue slaine her in his fierce despight:<br>
    
 But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,<br>
    
 He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe aduise<br>
    
 To proue his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.<br>
    
 Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,<br>
    
 Tho can she weepe, to stirre vp gentle ruth,<br>
 Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.</p><p>
  
 And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my loue,<br>
    
 Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,<br>
    
 And mightie causes wrought in heauen aboue,<br>
    
 Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate,<br>
    
 For hoped loue to winne me certaine hate?<br>
    
 Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.<br>
    
 Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state<br>
    
 You, whom my hard auenging destinie<br>
 Hath made iudge of my life or death indifferently.</p><p>
  
 Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leaue<br>
    
 My Fathers kingdome,--There she stopt with teares;<br>
    
 Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereaue,<br>
    
 And then againe begun, My weaker yeares<br>
    
 Captiu'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,<br>
    
 Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:<br>
    
 Let me not dye in languor and long teares.<br>
    
 Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?<br>
 What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?</p><p>
  
 Loue of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint<br>
    
 Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night<br>
    
 In secret anguish and vnpittied plaint,<br>
    
 Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.<br>
    
 Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight<br>
    
 Suspect her truth: yet since no' vntruth he knew,<br>
    
 Her fawning loue with foule disdainefull spight<br>
    
 He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,<br>
 That for my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew.</p><p>
  
 Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;<br>
    
 For all so deare as life is to my hart,<br>
    
 I deeme your loue, and hold me to you bound;<br>
    
 Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,<br>
    
 Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.<br>
    
 Not all content, yet seemd she to appease<br>
    
 Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,<br>
    
 And fed with words, that could not chuse but please,<br>
 So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.</p><p>
  
 Long after lay he musing at her mood,<br>
    
 Much grieu'd to thinke that gentle Dame so light,<br>
    
 For whose defence he was to shed his blood.<br>
    
 At last dull wearinesse of former fight<br>
    
 Hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,<br>
    
 That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,<br>
    
 With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:<br>
    
 But when he saw his labour all was vaine,<br>
 With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.</p><p>
