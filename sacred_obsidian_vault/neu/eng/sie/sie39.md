 <p>Pity would be no more,<br> If we did not make somebody Poor:<br> And Mercy no more could be,<br> If all were as happy as we:</p>  
 <p>And mutual fear brings peace:<br> Till the selfish loves increase.<br> Then Cruelty knits a snare,<br> And spreads his baits with care.</p>  
 <p>He sits down with holy fears,<br> And waters the ground with tears:<br> Then Humility takes its root<br> Underneath his foot.</p>  
 <p>Soon spreads the dismal shade<br> Of Mystery over his head;<br> And the Catterpiller and Fly,<br> Feed on the Mystery.</p>  
 <p>And it bears the fruit of Deceit,<br> Ruddy and sweet to eat:<br> And the Raven his nest has made<br> In its thickest shade.</p>  
 <p>The Gods of the earth and sea,<br> Sought thro’ Nature to find this Tree<br> But their search was all in vain;<br> There grows one in the Human Brain</p>
