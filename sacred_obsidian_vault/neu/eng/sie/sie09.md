 <p>When my mother died I was very young,<br> And my father sold me while yet my tongue,<br> Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep.</p>  
 <p>So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep.<br> Theres little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head<br> That curl’d like a lambs back, was shav’d, so I said,<br> Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head's bare,<br> You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.</p>  
 <p>And so he was quiet, &amp; that very night,<br> As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight,<br> That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned &amp; Jack<br> Were all of them lock’d up in coffins of black,</p>  
 <p>And by came an Angel who had a bright key,<br> And he open’d the coffins &amp; set them all free.<br> Then down a green plain leaping laughing they run<br> And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.</p>  
 <p>Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind,<br> They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.<br> And the Angel told Tom, if he’d be a good boy,<br> He’d have God for his father &amp; never want joy.</p>  
 <p>And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark<br> And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work.<br> Tho’ the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm.<br> So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.</p>
