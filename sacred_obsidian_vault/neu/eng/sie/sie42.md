 <p>Nought loves another as itself<br> Nor venerates another so,<br> Nor is it possible to Thought<br> A greater than itself to know:</p>  
 <p>And Father, how can I love you,<br> Or any of my brothers more?<br> I love you like the little bird<br> That picks up crumbs around the door.</p>  
 <p>The Priest sat by and heard the child,<br> In trembling zeal he siez’d his hair:<br> He led him by his little coat:<br> And all admir’d the Priestly care.</p>  
 <p>And standing on the altar high,<br> Lo what a fiend is here! said he:<br> One who sets reason up for judge<br> Of our most holy Mystery.</p>  
 <p>The weeping child could not be heard,<br> The weeping parents wept in vain:<br> They strip’d him to his little shirt,<br> And bound him in an iron chain.</p>  
 <p>And burn’d him in a holy place,<br> Where many had been burn’d before:<br> The weeping parents wept in vain.<br> Are such things done on Albions shore.</p>
