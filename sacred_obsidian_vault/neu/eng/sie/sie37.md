 <p>Dear Mother, dear Mother, the Church is cold.<br> But the Ale-house is healthy &amp; pleasant &amp; warm:<br> Besides I can tell where I am use’d well.<br> Such usage in heaven will never do well.</p>  
 <p>But if at the Church they would give us some Ale,<br> And a pleasant fire, our souls to regale:<br> We’d sing and we’d pray all the live-long day:<br> Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.</p>  
 <p>Then the Parson might preach &amp; drink &amp; sing,<br> And we’d be as happy as birds in the spring:<br> And modest dame Lurch, who is always at Church,<br> Would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch.</p>  
 <p>And God like a father rejoicing to see,<br> His children as pleasant and happy as he:<br> Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel<br> But kiss him &amp; give him both drink and apparel.</p>
