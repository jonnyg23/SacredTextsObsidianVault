but certeinly it is greet doute.<br> <a name="an_92"></a> For, as seith Seint Gregorie, "Unnethe ariseth he out of his synne, that is charged with the charge of yvel usage."<br> <a name="an_93"></a> And therfore repentant folk, that stynte for to synne and forlete synne er that synne forlete hem,<br> <a name="an_93A"></a> hooly chirche holdeth hem siker of hire savacioun.<br> <a name="an_94"></a> And he that synneth and verraily repenteth hym in his laste, hooly chirche yet hopeth his savacioun,<br> <a name="an_94A"></a> by the grete mercy of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, for his repentaunce; but taak the siker wey.<br> <a name="an_95"></a> And now, sith I have declared yow what thyng is Penitence, now shul ye understonde that ther been three acciouns of Penitence.<br> <a name="an_96"></a> The firste is that if a man be baptized after that he hath synned.<br> <a name="an_97"></a> Seint Augustyn seith, "But he be penytent for his olde synful lyf, he may nat bigynne the newe clene lif."<br> <a name="an_98"></a> For, certes, if he be baptized withouten penitence of his olde gilt, he receyveth the mark of baptesme<br> <a name="an_98A"></a> but nat the grace ne the remission of his synnes, til he have repentance verray.<br> <a name="an_99"></a> Another defaute is this: that men doon deedly synne after that they han receyved baptesme.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_100">100</a></font></span> The thridde defaute is that men fallen in venial synnes after hir baptesme fro day to day.<br> <a name="an_101"></a> Therof seith Seint Augustyn that penitence of goode and humble folk is the penitence of every day.<br> <a name="an_102"></a> The speces of Penitence been three. That oon of hem is solempne, another is commune, and the thridde is privee.<br> <a name="an_103"></a> Thilke penance that is solempne is in two maneres;<br> <a name="an_103A"></a> as to be put out of hooly chirche in Lente for slaughtre of children, and swich maner thyng.<br> <a name="an_104"></a> Another is, whan a man hath synned openly, of which synne the fame is openly spoken in the contree,<br> <a name="an_104A"></a> and thanne hooly chirche by juggement destreyneth hym for to do open penaunce.<br> <a name="an_105"></a> Commune penaunce is that preestes enjoynen men communly in certeyn caas, as for to goon peraventure naked in pilgrimages, or barefoot.<br> <a name="an_106"></a> Pryvee penaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee synnes, of whiche we shryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce.<br> <a name="an_107"></a> Now shaltow understande what is bihovely and necessarie to verray parfit Penitence. And this stant on three thynges:<br> <a name="an_108"></a> Contricioun of Herte, Confessioun of Mouth, and Satisfaccioun.<br> <a name="an_109"></a> For which seith Seint John Crisostom, "Penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benygnely every peyne that hym is enjoyned,<br> <a name="an_109A"></a> with contricioun of herte, and shrift of mouth, with satisfaccioun, and in werkynge of alle manere humylitee."<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span> And this is fruytful penitence agayn three thynges in which we wratthe oure Lord Jhesu Crist;<br> <a name="an_111"></a> this is to seyn, by delit in thynkynge, by reccheleesnesse in spekynge, and by wikked synful werkynge.<br> <a name="an_112"></a> And agayns thise wikkede giltes is Penitence, that may be likned unto a tree.<br> <a name="an_113"></a> The roote of this tree is Contricioun, that hideth hym in the herte of hym that is verray repentaunt,<br> <a name="an_113A"></a> right as the roote of a tree hydeth hym in the erthe.<br> <a name="an_114"></a> Of the roote of Contricioun spryngeth a stalke that bereth braunches and leves of Confessioun, and fruyt of Satisfaccioun.<br> <a name="an_115"></a> For which Crist seith in his gospel, "Dooth digne fruyt of Penitence"; for by this fruyt may men knowe this tree,<br> <a name="an_115A"></a> and nat by the roote that is hyd in the herte of man, ne by the braunches, ne by the leves of Confessioun.<br> <a name="an_116"></a> And therfore oure Lord Jhesu Crist seith thus: "By the fruyt of hem shul ye knowen hem."<br> <a name="an_117"></a> Of this roote eek spryngeth a seed of grace, the which seed is mooder of sikernesse, and this seed is egre and hoot.<br> <a name="an_118"></a> The grace of this seed spryngeth of God thurgh remembrance of the day of doom and on the peynes of helle.<br> <a name="an_119"></a> Of this matere seith Salomon that in the drede of God man forleteth his synne.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span> The heete of this seed is the love of God and the desiryng of the joye perdurable.<br> <a name="an_121"></a> This heete draweth the herte of a man to God and dooth hym haten his synne.<br> <a name="an_122"></a> For soothly ther is nothyng that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk of his norice,<br> <a name="an_122A"></a> ne nothyng is to hym moore abhomynable than thilke milk whan it is medled with oother mete.<br> <a name="an_123"></a> Right so the synful man that loveth his synne, hym semeth that it is to him moost sweete of any thyng;<br> <a name="an_124"></a> but fro that tyme that he loveth sadly oure Lord Jhesu Crist,<br> <a name="an_124A"></a> and desireth the lif perdurable, ther nys to him no thyng moore abhomynable.<br> <a name="an_125"></a> For soothly the lawe of God is the love of God; for which David the prophete seith.<br> <a name="an_125A"></a> "I have loved thy lawe and hated wikkednesse and hate"; he that loveth God kepeth his lawe and his word.<br> <a name="an_126"></a> This tree saugh the prophete Daniel in spirit, upon the avysioun of the kyng Nabugodonosor, whan he conseiled hym to do penitence.<br> <a name="an_127"></a> Penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receyven,<br> <a name="an_127A"></a> and he that holdeth hym in verray penitence is blessed, after the sentence of Salomon.<br> <a name="an_128"></a> In this Penitence or Contricioun man shal understonde foure thynges; that is to seyn, what is Contricioun,<br> <a name="an_128A"></a> and whiche been the causes that moeven a man to Contricioun, and how he sholde be contrit, and what Contricioun availleth to the soule.<br> <a name="an_129"></a> Thanne is it thus: that Contricioun is the verray sorwe that a man receyveth in his herte for his synnes,<br> <a name="an_129A"></a> with sad purpos to shryve hym, and to do penaunce, and neveremoore to do synne.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130">130</a></font></span> And this sorwe shal been in this manere, as seith Seint Bernard:<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130A">130A</a></font></span> "It shal been hevy and grevous, and ful sharp and poynaunt in herte."<br> <a name="an_131"></a> First, for man hath agilt his Lord and his Creatour; and moore sharp and poynaunt for he hath agilt hys Fader celestial;<br> <a name="an_132"></a> and yet moore sharp and poynaunt for he hath wrathed and agilt hym that boghte hym, that with his precious blood hath delivered us<br> <a name="an_132A"></a> fro the bondes of synne, and fro the crueltee of the devel, and fro the peynes of helle.<br> <a name="an_133"></a> The causes that oghte moeve a man to Contricioun been sixe. First a man shal remembre hym of his synnes;<br> <a name="an_134"></a> but looke he that thilke remembraunce ne be to hym no delit by no wey, but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt.<br> <a name="an_134A"></a> For Job seith, "Synful men doon werkes worthy of confusioun."<br> <a name="an_135"></a> And therfore seith Ezechie, "I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf in bitternesse of myn herte."<br> <a name="an_136"></a> And God seith in the Apocalipse, "Remembreth yow fro whennes that ye been falle";<br> <a name="an_136A"></a> for biforn that tyme that ye synned, ye were the children of God and lymes of the regne of God;<br> <a name="an_137"></a> but for youre synne ye been woxen thral, and foul, and membres of the feend, hate of aungels, sclaundre of hooly chirche,<br> <a name="an_137A"></a> and foode of the false serpent, perpetueel matere of the fir of helle;<br> <a name="an_138"></a> and yet moore foul and abhomynable, for ye trespassen so ofte tyme as dooth the hound that retourneth to eten his spewyng.<br> <a name="an_139"></a> And yet be ye fouler for youre longe continuyng in synne and youre synful usage,<br> <a name="an_139A"></a> for which ye be roten in youre synne, as a beest in his dong.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_140">140</a></font></span> Swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his synne, and no delit, as God seith by the prophete Ezechiel,<br> <a name="an_141"></a> "Ye shal remembre yow of youre weyes, and they shuln displese yow." Soothly synnes been the weyes that leden folk to helle.<br> <a name="an_142"></a> The seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of synne is this:<br> <a name="an_142A"></a> that, as seith Seint Peter, "whoso that dooth synne is thral of synne"; and synne put a man in greet thraldom.<br> <a name="an_143"></a> And therfore seith the prophete Ezechiel: "I wente sorweful in desdayn of myself."<br> <a name="an_143A"></a> Certes, wel oghte a man have desdayn of synne and withdrawe hym from that thraldom and vileynye.<br> <a name="an_144"></a> And lo, what seith Seneca in this matere? He seith thus: "Though I wiste that neither God ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it,<br> <a name="an_144A"></a> yet wolde I have desdayn for to do synne."<br> <a name="an_145"></a> And the same Seneca also seith, "I am born to gretter thynges than to be thral to my body,<br> <a name="an_145A"></a> or than for to maken of my body a thral."<br> <a name="an_146"></a> Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken of his body than for to yeven his body to synne.<br> <a name="an_147"></a> Al were it the fouleste cherl or the fouleste womman that lyveth, and leest of value,<br> <a name="an_147A"></a> yet is he thanne moore foul and moore in servitute.<br> <a name="an_148"></a> Evere fro the hyer degree that man falleth, the moore is he thral, and moore to God and to the world vile and abhomynable.<br> <a name="an_149"></a> O goode God, wel oghte man have desdayn of synne, sith that thurgh synne ther he was free now is he maked bonde.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_150">150</a></font></span> And therfore seyth Seint Augustyn: "If thou hast desdayn of thy servant,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_150A">150A</a></font></span> if he agilte or synne, have thou thanne desdayn that thou thyself sholdest do synne."<br> <a name="an_151"></a> Tak reward of thy value, that thou ne be to foul to thyself.<br> <a name="an_152"></a> Allas, wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles to synne, and soore been ashamed of hemself<br> <a name="an_153"></a> that God of his endelees goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat, or yeven hem wit, strengthe of body, heele, beautee, prosperitee,<br> <a name="an_154"></a> and boghte hem fro the deeth with his herte-blood,<br> <a name="an_154A"></a> that they so unkyndely, agayns his gentilesse, quiten hym so vileynsly to slaughtre of hir owene soules.<br> <a name="an_155"></a> O goode God, ye wommen that been of so greet beautee, remembreth yow of the proverbe of Salomon. He seith,<br> <a name="an_156"></a> "Likneth a fair womman that is a fool of hire body<br> <a name="an_156A"></a> lyk to a ryng of gold that were in the groyn of a soughe."<br> <a name="an_157"></a> For right as a soughe wroteth in everich ordure, so wroteth she hire beautee in the stynkynge ordure of synne.<br> <a name="an_158"></a> The thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to Contricioun is drede of the day of doom and of the horrible peynes of helle.<br> <a name="an_159"></a> For as Seint Jerome seith, "At every tyme that me remembreth of the day of doom I quake;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_160">160</a></font></span> for whan I ete or drynke, or what so that I do, evere semeth me that the trompe sowneth in myn ere:<br> <a name="an_161"></a> `Riseth up, ye that been dede, and cometh to the juggement.'"<br> <a name="an_162"></a> O goode God, muchel oghte a man to drede swich a juggement, "ther as we shullen been alle,"<br> <a name="an_162A"></a> as Seint Poul seith, "biforn the seete of oure Lord Jhesu Crist";<br> <a name="an_163"></a> whereas he shal make a general congregacioun, whereas no man may been absent.<br> <a name="an_164"></a> For certes there availleth noon essoyne ne excusacioun.<br> <a name="an_165"></a> And nat oonly that oure defautes shullen be jugged, but eek that alle oure werkes shullen openly be knowe.<br> <a name="an_166"></a> And, as seith Seint Bernard, "Ther ne shal no pledynge availle, ne no sleighte; we shullen yeven rekenynge of everich ydel word."<br> <a name="an_167"></a> Ther shul we han a juge that may nat been deceyved ne corrupt. And why?<br> <a name="an_167A"></a> For, certes, alle oure thoghtes been discovered as to hym, ne for preyere ne for meede he shal nat been corrupt.<br> <a name="an_168"></a> And therfore seith Salomon, "The wratthe of God ne wol nat spare no wight, for preyere ne for yifte";<br> <a name="an_168A"></a> and therfore, at the day of doom ther nys noon hope to escape.<br> <a name="an_169"></a> Wherfore, as seith Seint Anselm, "Ful greet angwyssh shul the synful folk have at that tyme;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_170">170</a></font></span> ther shal the stierne and wrothe juge sitte above, and under hym the horrible pit of helle open to destroyen hym<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_170A">170A</a></font></span> that moot biknowen his synnes, whiche synnes openly been shewed biforn God and biforn every creature;<br> <a name="an_171"></a> and in the left syde mo develes than herte may bithynke, for to harye and drawe the synful soules to the peyne of helle;<br> <a name="an_172"></a> and withinne the hertes of folk shal be the bitynge conscience, and withouteforth shal be the world al brennynge.<br> <a name="an_173"></a> Whider shal thanne the wrecched synful man flee to hiden hym? Certes, he may nat hyden hym; he moste come forth and shewen hym."<br> <a name="an_174"></a> For certes, as seith Seint Jerome, "the erthe shal casten hym out of hym, and the see also,<br> <a name="an_174A"></a> and the eyr also, that shal be ful of thonder-clappes and lightnynges."<br> <a name="an_175"></a> Now soothly, whoso wel remembreth hym of thise thynges, I gesse that his synne shal nat turne hym into delit,<br> <a name="an_175A"></a> but to greet sorwe for drede of the peyne of helle.<br> <a name="an_176"></a> And therfore seith Job to God, "Suffre, Lord, that I may a while biwaille and wepe,<br> <a name="an_176A"></a> er I go withoute returnyng to the derke lond, covered with the derknesse of deeth,<br> <a name="an_177"></a> to the lond of mysese and of derknesse, whereas is the shadwe of deeth,<br> <a name="an_177A"></a> whereas ther is noon ordre or ordinaunce but grisly drede that evere shal laste."<br> <a name="an_178"></a> Loo, heere may ye seen that Job preyde respit a while to biwepe and waille his trespas,<br> <a name="an_178A"></a> for soothly oo day of respit is bettre than al the tresor of this world.<br> <a name="an_179"></a> And forasmuche as a man may acquiten hymself biforn God by penitence in this world, and nat by tresor,<br> <a name="an_179A"></a> therfore sholde he preye to God to yeve hym respit a while to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_180">180</a></font></span> For certes, al the sorwe that a man myghte make fro the bigynnyng of the world<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_180A">180A</a></font></span> nys but a litel thyng at regard of the sorwe of helle.<br> <a name="an_181"></a> The cause why that Job clepeth helle the "lond of derkness.":<br> <a name="an_182"></a> understondeth that he clepeth it "lond" or erthe, for it is stable and nevere shal faille; "derk,"<br> <a name="an_182A"></a> for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material.<br> <a name="an_183"></a> For certes, the derke light that shal come out of the fyr that evere shal brenne<br> <a name="an_183A"></a> shal turne hym al to peyne that is in helle for it sheweth him to the horrible develes that hym tormenten.<br> <a name="an_184"></a> "Covered with the derknesse of deeth" -- that is to seyn, that<br> <a name="an_184A"></a> he that is in helle shal have defaute of the sighte of God, for certes the sighte of God is the lyf perdurable.<br> <a name="an_185"></a> "The derknesse of deeth" been the synnes that the wrecched man hath doon, whiche that destourben hym to see the face of God,<br> <a name="an_185A"></a> right as dooth a derk clowde bitwixe us and the sonne.<br> <a name="an_186"></a> "Lond of misese," by cause that ther been three maneres of defautes,<br> <a name="an_186A"></a> agayn three thynges that folk of this world han in this present lyf; that is to seyn, honours, delices, and richesses.<br> <a name="an_187"></a> Agayns honour, have they in helle shame and confusioun.<br> <a name="an_188"></a> For wel ye woot that men clepen honour the reverence that man doth to man, but in helle is noon honour ne reverence.<br> <a name="an_188A"></a> For certes, namoore reverence shal be doon there to a kyng than to a knave.<br> <a name="an_189"></a> For which God seith by the prophete Jeremye, "Thilke folk that me despisen shul been in despit."<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_190">190</a></font></span> Honour is eek cleped greet lordshipe; ther shal no wight serven other, but of harm<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_190A">190A</a></font></span> and torment.
