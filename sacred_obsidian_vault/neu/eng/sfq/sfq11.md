 <h3 align="CENTER">The House of Pride</h3>
 <p>Now the Red Cross Knight, because of his lack of loyalty to Una, fell into much danger and difficulty. His first fault was in believing evil of her so readily, and leaving her forlorn; after that he was too easily beguiled by the pretended goodness and beauty of</p>
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Duessa. All who fight in a good cause must beware of errors such as these. If matters do not go exactly as we wish, we must not lose heart and get impatient; even if we cannot understand what is happening, we must trust that all will be well. We must keep steadily to the one true aim set before us, or else, like the Red Cross Knight, we may be led astray by false things that are only pleasant in appearance, and have no real goodness.</p>
 <p>Duessa and the Knight travelled for a long way, till at last they saw in front of them a grand and beautiful building. It seemed as if it were the house of some mighty Prince; a broad highway led up to it, all trodden bare by the feet of those who flocked thither. Great troops of people of all sorts and condition journeyed here, both by day and night. But few returned, unless they managed to escape, beggared and disgraced, when, ever afterwards, they lived a life of misery.</p>
 <p>To this place Duessa guided the Red Cross Knight, for she was tired with the toilsome journey, and the day was nearly over.</p>
 <p>It was a stately palace, built of smooth bricks, cunningly laid together without mortar. The walls were high, but neither strong nor thick, and they were covered with dazzling gold-foil. There were many lofty towers and picturesque galleries, with bright windows and delightful bowers; and on the top there was a dial to tell the time.</p>
 <p>It was lovely to look at, and did much credit to the workman that designed it; but it was a great pity</p>
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>
 <p>that so fair a building rested on so frail a foundation. For it was mounted high up on a sandy hill that kept shifting and falling away. Every breath of heaven made it shake; and all the back parts, that no one could see, were old and ruinous, though cunningly painted over.</p>
 <p>Arrived here, Duessa and the Red Cross Knight passed in at once, for the gates stood wide open to all. They were in charge of a porter, called "Ill-come," who never denied entrance to any one. The hall inside was hung with costly tapestry and rich curtains. Numbers of people, rich and poor, were waiting here, in order to gain sight of the Lady of this wonderful place.</p>
 <p>Duessa and the Knight passed through this crowd, who all gazed at them, and entered the Presence Chamber of the Queen.</p>
 <p>What a dazzling sight met. their eyes! Such a scene of splendour had never been known in the court of any living prince. A noble company of lords and ladies stood on every side, and made the place more beautiful with their presence.</p>
 <p>High above all there was a cloth of state, and a rich throne as bright as' the sun. On the throne, clad in royal robes, sat the Queen. Her garments were all glittering with gold and precious jewels; but so great was her beauty that it dimmed even the brightness of her throne. She sat there in princely state, shining like the sun. She hated and despised all lowly things of earth. Under her scornful feet lay a dreadful dragon, with a hideous tall. In her hand she held a mirror in which she often looked at her face; she took</p>

 <p>great delight in her own appearance, for she was fairer than any living woman.</p>
 <p>She was the daughter of grisly Pluto, King of Hades, and men called her proud Lucifera. She had crowned herself a queen, but she had no rightful kingdom at all, nor any possessions The power which she had obtained she had usurped by wrong and tyranny. She ruled her realm not by laws, but by craft, and according to the advice of six old wizards, who with their bad counsels upheld her kingdom.</p>
 <p>As soon as the Knight and Duessa came into the presence-chamber, an usher, by name <i>Vanity</i>, made room and prepared a passage for them, and brought them to the lowest stair of the high throne. Here they made a humble salute, and declared that they had come to see the Queen's royal state, and to prove if the wide report of her great splendour were true.</p>
 <p>With scornful eyes, half unwilling to look so low, she thanked them disdainfully, and did not show them any courtesy worthy of a queen, scarcely even bidding them arise. The lords and ladies of the court, however, were all eager to appear well in the eyes of the strangers. They shook out their ruffles, and fluffed up their curls, and arranged their gay attire more trimly; and each one was jealous and spiteful of the others.</p>
 <p>They did their best to entertain the Knight, and would gladly have made him one of their company. To Duessa, also, they were most polite and gracious, for formerly she had been well known in that court. But to the knightly eyes of the warrior all the glitter of the crowd seemed vain and worthless, and he thought.</p>
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>
 <p>that it was unbefitting so great a queen to treat a strange knight with such scant courtesy.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Queen Lucifera rose from her throne, and called for her coach. Then all was bustle and confusion, every one rushing violently forth. Blazing with brightness she paced down the hall, like the sun dawning in the east. All the people thronging the hall thrust and pushed each other aside to gaze upon her. Her glorious appearance amazed the eyes of all men.</p>
 <p>Her coach was adorned with gold and gay garlands, and was one of the most splendid carriages ever seen, but it was drawn by an ugly and ill-matched team. On every animal rode one of her evil Councillors, who was much like in nature to the creature that carried him.</p>
 <p>The first of these, who guided all the rest, was <i>Idleness</i>, the nurse of Sin. He chose to ride a slothful ass; he looked always as if he were half asleep, and as if he did not know whether it were night or day. He shut himself away from all care, and shunned manly exercise, but if there were any mischief to be done he joined in it readily. The Queen was indeed badly served who had Idleness for her leading Councillor.</p>
 <p>Next to him came <i>Gluttony</i>, riding on a pig; then <i>Self-indulgence</i> on a goat, <i>Avarice</i> on a camel, <i>Envy</i> on a wolf, and <i>Wrath</i> on a lion. Each in his own way was equally hideous and hateful.</p>
 <p>As they went along, crowds of people came round, shouting for joy; always before them a foggy mist sprang up, covering all the land, and under their feet lay the dead bones of men who had wandered from the right path.</p>

 <p>So forth they went in this goodly array to enjoy the fresh air, and to sport in the flowery meadows. Among the rest, next to the chariot, rode the false Duessa, but the good Knight kept far apart, not joining in the noisy mirth which seemed unbefitting a true warrior.</p>
 <p>Having enjoyed themselves awhile in the pleasant fields, they returned to the stately palace. Here they found that a wandering knight had just arrived. On his shield, in red letters, was written the name "Sans Joy," which means <i>Joyless</i>, and he was the brother of <i>Faithless</i>, whom the Red Cross Knight had slain, and of <i>Lawless</i>, who had taken Una captive. He looked sullen and revengeful, as if he had in his mind bitter and angry thoughts.</p>
 <p>When he saw the shield of his slain brother, Faithless, in the hands of the Red Cross Knight's page, he sprang at him and snatched it away. But the Knight had no mind to lose the trophy which he had won in battle, and, attacking him fiercely, he again got possession of it.</p>
 <p>Thereupon they hastily began to prepare for battle, clashing their shields and shaking their swords in the air. But the Queen, on pain of her severe displeasure, commanded them to restrain their fury, saying that if either had a right to the shield, they should fight it out fairly the next day.</p>
 <p>That night was passed in joy and gaiety, feasting and making merry in bower and hall. The steward of the court was <i>Gluttony</i>, who poured forth lavishly of his abundance to all; and then the chamberlain, <i>Sloth</i>, summoned them to rest.</p>
