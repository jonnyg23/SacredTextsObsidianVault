 <h1 align="CENTER">248A: The Grey Cock, or, Saw You My Father</h1>
 <pre>
 
 248A.1	 O SAW ye my father? or saw ye my mother?
 	 Or saw ye my true-love John?
 	 I saw not your father, I saw not your mother,
 	 But I saw your true-love John.
 248A.2	 Its now ten at night, and the stars gie nae light,
 	 And the bells they ring ding, dang;
 	 Hes met wi some delay that causeth him to stay,
 	 But he will be here ere lang.
 248A.3	 The surly auld earl did naething but snarl,
 	 And Johnys face it grew red;
 	 Yet, tho he often sighd, he neer a word replied
 	 Till all were asleep in bed.
 248A.4	 Up Johny rose, and to the door he goes,
 	 And gently tirl d the pin;
 	 The lassie taking tent unto the door she went,
 	 And she opend and let him in.
 248A.5	 And are ye come at last? and do I hold ye fast?
 	 And is my Johny true?
 	 I hae nae time to tell, but sae langs I like mysell
 	 Sae lang will I love you.
 248A.6	 Flee, flee up, my bonny grey cock,
 	 And craw when it is day;
 	 Your neck shall be like the bonny beaten gold,
 	 And your wings of the silver grey.
 248A.7	 The cock provd false, and untrue he was,
 	 For he crew an hour oer soon;
 	 The lassie thought it was day when she sent her love away,
 	 And it was but a blink of the moon.
