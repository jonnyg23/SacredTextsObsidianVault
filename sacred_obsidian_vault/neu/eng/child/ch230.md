 <h1 align="CENTER">230A: The Slaughter of the Laird of Mellerstain</h1>
 <pre>
 
 230A.1	 . . . .
 	 As they came in by the Eden side,
 	 They heard a lady lamenting sair,
 	 Bewailing the time she was a bride.
 230A.2	 . . . .
 	 A stately youth of blude and lane,
 	 . . . .
 	 John Hately, the laird of Mellerstain.
 230A.3	 Cowdenknows, had ye nae lack?
 	 And Earlstoun, had ye nae shame?
 	 Ye took him away beside my back,
 	 But ye never saw to bring him hame.
 230A.4	 And she has lookit to Fieldiesha,
 	 So has she through Yirdandstane;
 	 She lookit to Earlstoun, and she saw the Fans,
 	 But hes coming hame by West Gordon.
 230A.5	 And she staggerd and she stood,
 230A.6	 . . . . . . .
 	 . . . . .  wude;
 	 How can I keep in my wits,
 	 When I look on my husbands blood?
 230A.7	 Had we been men as we are women,
 	 And been at his back when he was slain,
 	 It should a been tauld for mony a lang year,
 	 The slaughter o the laird of Mellerstain.
