 <h1 align="CENTER">40: The Queen of Elfans Nourice</h1>
 <pre>
 
 40.1	I HEARD a cow low, a bonnie cow low,
 	An a cow low down in yon glen;
 	Lang, lang will my young son greet
 	Or his mither bid him come ben.
 40.2	I heard a cow low, a bonnie cow low,
 	An a cow low down in yon fauld;
 	Lang, lang will my young son greet
 	Or his mither take him frae cauld.
 	* * * * *
 40.3	. . . . .
 	. . . .
 	Waken, Queen of Elfan,
 	An hear your nourice moan.
 40.4	O moan ye for your meat,
 	Or moan ye for your fee,
 	Or moan ye for the ither bounties
 	That ladies are wont to gie?
 40.5	I moan na for my meat,
 	Nor moan I for my fee,
 	Nor moan I for the ither bounties
 	That ladies are wont to gie.
 40.6	. . . . .
 	. . . . .
 	But I moan for my young son
 	I left in four nights auld.
 40.7	I moan na for my meat,
 	Nor yet for my fee,
 	But I mourn for Christen land,
 	Its there I fain would be.
 40.8	O nurse my bairn, nourice, she says,
 	Till he stan at your knee,
 	An yes win hame to Christen land,
 	Whar fain its ye wad be.
 40.9	O keep my bairn, nourice,
 	Till he gang by the hauld,
 	An yes win hame to your young son
 	Ye left in four nights auld.
 	* * * * *
 40.10	O nourice lay your head
 	Upo my knee:
 	See ye na that narrow road
 	Up by yon tree?
 40.11	. . . . . .
 	. . . . .
 	Thats the road the righteous goes,
 	And thats the road to heaven.
 40.12	An see na ye that braid road,
 	Down by yon sunny fell?
 	Yons the road the wicked gae,
 	An thats the road to hell.
