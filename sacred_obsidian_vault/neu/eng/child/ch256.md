 <pre>
 
 256A.1	 MY luve she lives in Lincolnshire,
 	 I wat shes neither black nor broun,
 	 But her hair is like the thread o gowd,
 	 Aye an it waur weel kaim d doun.
 256A.2	 Shes pued the black mask owre her face,
 	 An blinkit gaily wi her ee:
 RRrro	 will you to my weddin come,
 	 An will you bear me gude companie?
 256A.3	 I winna to your weddin come,
 	 Nor [will] I bear you gude companie,
 	 Unless you be the bride yoursell,
 	 An me the bridegroom to be.
 256A.4	 For me to be the bride mysel,
 	 An you the bonnie bridegroom to be-+--+-
 	 Cheer up you heart, Sweet Willie, she said,
 	 For thats the day youll never see.
 256A.5	 Gin you waur on your saddle set,
 	 An gaily ridin on the way,
 	 Youll hae nae mair mind o Alison
 	 Than she waur dead an laid in clay.
 256A.6	 When he was on his saiddle set,
 	 An slowly ridin on the way,
 	 He had mair mind o Alison
 	 Than he had o the licht o day.
 256A.7	 He saw a hart draw near a hare,
 	 An aye that hare drew near a toun,
 	 An that same hart did get a hare,
 	 But the gentle knicht got neer a toun.
 256A.8	 He leant him owre his saiddle-bow,
 	 An his heart did brak in pieces three;
 	 Wi sighen said him Sweet Willie,
 	 The pains o luve hae taen hald o me.
 256A.9	 . . . .
 	 . . . .
 	 There cam a white horse an a letter,
 	 That stopped the weddin speidilie.
 256A.10	 She leant her back on her bed-side,
 	 An her heart did brak in pieces three;
 	 She was buried an bemoaned,
 	 But the birds waur Willies companie.
