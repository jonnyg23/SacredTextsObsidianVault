 <h1 align="CENTER">STUPID'S MISTAKEN CRIES  <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a></h1>
 <p>THERE was once a little boy, and his mother sent him to buy a sheep's head and pluck; afraid he should forget it, the lad kept saying all the way along:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Sheep's head and pluck!<br>
 Sheep's head and pluck!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>Trudging along, he came to a stile; but in getting over he fell and hurt himself, and, beginning to blubber, forgot what he was sent for. So he stood a little while to consider; at last he thought he recollected it, and began to repeat:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Liver and lights and gall and all!<br>
 Liver and lights and gall and all!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>Away he went again, and came to where a man was sick, bawling out:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Liver and lights and gall and all!<br>
 Liver and lights and gall and all!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>Whereon the man laid hold of him and beat him, bidding him say:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Pray God send no more up!<br>
 Pray God send no more up!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>The youngster strode along, uttering these words, till he reached a field where a hind was sowing wheat:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Pray God send no more up!<br>
 Pray God send no more up!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>This was all his cry. So the sower began to thrash him, and charged him to repeat:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Pray God send plenty more!<br>
 Pray God send plenty more!</p></dir>
 
 <p>Off the child scampered with these words in his mouth till he reached a churchyard and met a funeral, but he went on with his:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Pray God send plenty more!<br>
 Pray God send plenty more!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>The chief mourner seized and punished him, and bade him repeat:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Pray God send the soul to heaven!<br>
 Pray God send the soul to heaven!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>Away went the boy, and met a dog and a bitch going to be hung, but his cry rang out:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Pray God send the soul to heaven!<br>
 Pray God send the soul to heaven!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>The good folk nearly were furious, seized and struck him, charging him to say:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"A dog and a bitch agoing to be hung!<br>
 A dog and a bitch agoing to be hung!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>This the poor fellow did, till he overtook a man and a woman going to be married. "Oh! oh!" he shouted:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"A dog and a bitch agoing to be hung!<br>
 A dog and a bitch agoing to be hung!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>The man was enraged, as we may well think, gave him many a thump, and ordered him to repeat:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"I wish you much joy!<br>
 I wish you much joy!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>This he did, jogging along, till he came to two labourers who had fallen into a ditch. The lad kept bawling out:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"I wish you much joy! <br>
 I wish you much joy!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>This vexed one of the folk so sorely that he used all his strength, scrambled out, beat the crier, and told him to say:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"The one is out, I wish the other was!<br>
 The one is out, I wish the other was!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>On went young 'un till he found a fellow with only one eye; but he kept up his song:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"The one is out, I wish the other was!<br>
 The one is out, I wish the other was!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>This was too much for Master One-eye, who grabbed him and chastised him, bidding him call:</p><dir>
 
 <p>"The one side gives good light, I wish the other did!<br>
 The one side gives good light, I wish the other did!"</p></dir>
 
 <p>So he did, to be sure, till he came to a house, one side of which was on fire. The people here thought it was he who had set the place a-blazing, and straightway put him in prison. The end was, the judge put on his black cap, and condemned him to die.</p>
