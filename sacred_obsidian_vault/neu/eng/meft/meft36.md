 <p>There lived a Puddock in a well,<br>
 And a merry Mousie in a mill.</p>
 <p>Puddock he would a-wooing ride<br>
 Sword and pistol by his side.</p>
 <p>Puddock came to the Mousie's inn,<br>
 'Mistress Mousie, are you within?'</p>
 <p>MOUSIE<br>
 'Yes, kind sir, I am within,<br>
 Softly<i> </i>do I sit and spin.'</p>
 <p>PUDDOCK<br>
 'Madam, I am come to woo,<br>
 Marriage I must have of you.'</p>
 <p>MOUSIE<br>
 'Marriage I will grant you none<br>
 Till Uncle Ratton he comes home.'</p>
 <p>PUDDOCK<br>
 'See, Uncle Ratton's now come in<br>
 Then go and bask the bride within.'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Who is it that sits next the wall<br>
 But Lady Mousie both slim and small?</p>
 <p>Who is it that sits next the bride<br>
 But Lord Puddock with yellow side?</p>
 <p>But soon came Duckie and with her Sir Drake;<br>
 Duckie takes Puddock and makes him speak.</p>
 <p>Then came in the old carl cat<br>
 With a fiddle on his back:<br>
 'Do ye any music lack?'</p>
 <p>Puddock he swam down the brook,<br>
 Sir Drake he catched him in his fluke.</p>
 <p>The cat he pulled Lord Ratton down,<br>
 The kittens they did claw his crown.</p>
 <p>But Lady Mousie, so slim and small,<br>
 Crept into a hole beneath the wall;<br>
 'Squeak,' quoth she, 'I'm out of it all.'</p>
