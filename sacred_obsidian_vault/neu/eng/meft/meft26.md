 <p> </p>
 <p>Now ponder well, you parents dear,<br>
 These words which I shall write;<br>
 A doleful story you shall hear,<br>
 In time brought forth to light.<br>
 A gentleman of good account,<br>
 In Norfolk dwelt of late,<br>
 Who did in honour far surmount<br>
 Most men of his estate.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Sore sick he was and like to die,<br>
 No help his life could save;<br>
 His wife by him as sick did lie,<br>
 And both possest one grave.<br>
 No love between these two was lost,<br>
 Each was to other kind;<br>
 In love they lived, in love they died,<br>
 And left two babes behind.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The one a fine and pretty boy<br>
 Not passing three years old,<br>
 The other a girl more young than he,<br>
 And framed in beauty's mould.<br>
 The father left his little son,<br>
 As plainly did appear,<br>
 When he to perfect age should come,<br>
 Three hundred pounds a year;</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>And to his little daughter Jane<br>
 Five hundred pounds in gold,<br>
 To be paid down on marriage-day,<br>
 Which might not be controlled.<br>
 But if the children chanced to die<br>
 Ere they to age should come,<br>
 Their uncle should possess their wealth;<br>
 For so the will did run.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>'Now, brother,' said the dying man,<br>
 'Look to my children dear;<br>
 Be good unto my boy and girl,<br>
 No friends else have they here;<br>
 To God and you I recommend<br>
 My children dear this day;<br>
 But little while be sure we have<br>
 Within this world to stay.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>'You must be father and mother both,<br>
 And uncle, all in one;<br>
 God knows what will become of them<br>
 When I am dead and gone.'<br>
 With that bespake their mother dear;<br>
 'O brother kind,' quoth she,<br>
 'You are the man must bring our babes<br>
 To wealth or misery.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>'And if you keep them carefully,<br>
 Then God will you reward;<br>
 But if you otherwise should deal,<br>
 God will your deeds regard.'<br>
 With lips as cold as any stone,<br>
 They kissed their children small:<br>
 'God bless you both, my children dear!'<br>
 With that the tears did fall.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>These speeches then their brother spake<br>
 To this sick couple there:<br>
 'The keeping of your little ones,<br>
 Sweet sister, do not fear;<br>
 God never prosper me nor mine,<br>
 Nor aught else that I have,<br>
 If I do wrong your children dear<br>
 When you are laid in grave!'</p>
 <p><br>
 <br>
 The parents being dead and gone,<br>
 The children home he takes,<br>
 And brings them straight unto his house<br>
 Where much of them he makes.<br>
 He had not kept these pretty babes<br>
 A twelvemonth and a day,<br>
 But, for their wealth, he did devise<br>
 To make them both away.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>He bargained with two ruffians strong,<br>
 Which were of furious mood,<br>
 That they should take these children young,<br>
 And slay them in a wood.<br>
 He told his wife an artful tale<br>
 He would the children send<br>
 To be brought up in London town<br>
 With one that was his friend.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Away then went those pretty babes,<br>
 Rejoicing at that tide,<br>
 Rejoicing with a merry mind<br>
 They should on cock-horse ride.<br>
 They prate and prattle pleasantly,<br>
 As they ride on the way,<br>
 To those that should their butchers be<br>
 And work their lives' decay:</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>So that the pretty speech they had<br>
 Made Murder's heart relent;<br>
 And they that undertook the deed<br>
 Full sore now did repent.<br>
 Yet one of them, more hard of heart,<br>
 Did vow to do his charge,<br>
 Because the wretch that hired him<br>
 Had paid him very large.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The other won't agree thereto,<br>
 So there they fall to strife;<br>
 With one another they did fight<br>
 About the children's life;<br>
 And he that was of mildest mood<br>
 Did slay the other there,<br>
 Within an unfrequented wood;<br>
 The babes did quake for fear!</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>He took the children by the hand,<br>
 Tears standing in their eye,<br>
 And bade them straightway follow him,<br>
 And look they did not cry;<br>
 And two long miles he led them on,<br>
 While they for food complain:<br>
 'Stay here,' quoth he, 'I'll bring you bread,<br>
 When I come back again.'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>These pretty babes, with hand in hand,<br>
 Went wandering up and down;<br>
 But never more could see the man<br>
 Approaching from the town.<br>
 Their pretty lips from blackberries<br>
 Were all besmeared and dyed;<br>
 And when they saw the darksome night,<br>
 They sat them down and cried.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Thus wandered these poor innocents,<br>
 Till death did end their grief;<br>
 In one another's arms they died,<br>
 As wanting due relief:<br>
 No burial this pretty pair<br>
 From any man receives,<br>
 Till Robin Redbreast piously<br>
 Did cover them with leaves.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>And now the heavy wrath of God<br>
 Upon their uncle fell;<br>
 Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,<br>
 His conscience felt an hell:<br>
 His barns were fired, his goods consumed,<br>
 His hands were barren made,<br>
 His cattle died within the field,<br>
 And nothing with him stayed.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>And in a voyage to Portugal<br>
 Two of his sons did die;<br>
 And to conclude, himself was brought<br>
 To want and misery:<br>
 He pawned and mortgaged all his land<br>
 Ere seven years came about.<br>
 And now at last this wicked act<br>
 Did by this means come out.</p>
 <p><br>
 <br>
 The fellow that did take in hand<br>
 These children for to kill,<br>
 Was for a robbery judged to die.<br>
 Such was God's blessed will:<br>
 Who did confess the very truth,<br>
 As here hath been displayed:<br>
 The uncle having died in jail,<br>
 Where he for debt was laid.</p>
 <p>You that executors be made,<br>
 And overseers eke,<br>
 Of children that be fatherless,<br>
 And infants mild and meek,<br>
 Take you example by this thing,<br>
 And yield to each his right,<br>
 Lest God with suchlike misery<br>
 Your wicked minds requite.</p>
