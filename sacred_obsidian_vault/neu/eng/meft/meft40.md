 <h1 align="CENTER">Old Mother Wiggle-Waggle</h1>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The fox and his wife they had a great strife,<br>
 They never ate mustard in all their whole life;<br>
 They ate their meat without fork or knife <br>
 And loved to be picking a bone, e-ho!</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The fox went out, one still, clear night,<br>
 And he prayed the moon to give him light,<br>
 For he'd a long way to travel that night,<br>
 Before he got back to his den-o!</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The fox when he came to yonder stile,<br>
 He lifted his lugs and he listened a while!<br>
 'Oh, ho!' said the fox, 'it's but a short mile<br>
 From this unto yonder wee town, e-ho!'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> And first he arrived at a farmer's yard,<br>
 Where the ducks and geese declared it was hard,<br>
 That their nerves should be shaken and their rest should be marred<br>
 By the visits of Mister Fox-o!</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The fox when he came to the farmer's gate,<br>
 Who should he see but the farmer's drake;<br>
 'I love you well for your master's sake,<br>
 And long to be picking your bones, e-ho!'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The grey goose she ran round the hay-stack,<br>
 Oh, ho!' said the fox, 'you are very fat;<br>
 You'll grease my beard and ride on my back<br>
 From this into yonder wee town, e-ho!'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Then he took the grey goose by her sleeve,<br>
 And said: 'Madam Grey Goose, by your leave<br>
 I'll take you away without reprieve,<br>
 And carry you back to my den-o!'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>And he seized the black duck by the neck,<br>
 And slung him all across his back,<br>
 The black duck cried out 'quack, quack, quack',<br>
 With his legs all dangling down-o!</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Old Mother Wiggle-Waggle hopped out of bed,<br>
 Out of the window she popped her old head;<br>
 'Oh! husband, oh! husband, the grey goose is gone,<br>
 And the fox is off to his den, oh!'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Then the old man got up in his red cap,<br>
 And swore he would catch the fox in a trap;<br>
 But the fox was too cunning, and gave him the slip,<br>
 And ran through the town, the town, oh!</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>When he got to the top of the hill,<br>
 He blew his trumpet both loud and shrill,<br>
 For joy that he was safe and sound<br>
 Through the town, oh!</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>But at last he arrived at his home again,<br>
 To his dear little foxes, eight, nine, ten,<br>
 Says he, 'You're in luck, here's a fine fat duck<br>
 With his legs all dangling down-o!'</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>So he sat down together with his hungry wife,<br>
 And they did very well without fork or knife,<br>
 They never ate a better duck in all their life,<br>
 And the little ones picked the bones-o !</p>
