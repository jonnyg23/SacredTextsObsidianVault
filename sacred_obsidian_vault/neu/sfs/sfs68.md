 <p>THE Croats are believed to take their name from their former abode in the ancient Chrobatia, north of the Carpathian Mountains, whose name retains the same root, CRB(or P)T. Among them we meet with a wonderful hero, 'Marko' (<a href="sfs69.htm#an_52">No. 52</a>), the account of whose <i>buzdovan</i>, or mace, the southern representative of Thor's hammer, may be compared with 'Little Rolling-pea's <i>bulava</i> (<a href="sfs31.htm#an_22">No. 22</a>), and that of 'Ivan Popyalof' (Ralston, p. 66). Marko appears to have been a very unprincipled hero, with very slight ideas of honesty and fair-play. He is represented as gaining his vast strength from a superhuman source--a Vila, of whom more anon. In <a href="sfs70.htm#an_53">No. 53</a>, we are carried into cloudland, and meet with representatives of the <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>Clashing Rocks' (Symplegades), through which the good ship <i>Argo</i> had to pass before she could make her way into the Black Sea, and which, till their reappearance in this story, seem to have dropped altogether out of folklore. From this story, and also from several incidents in <a href="sfs69.htm#an_52">No. 52</a>, we perceive that the Vilas of the South Slavonians are not denizens of the earth, the waters, or the woods, but of the clouds, and thus a journey has to be made into cloudland to find the daughter of their king. <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">*</font></a> <a href="sfs71.htm#an_54">No. 54</a> will remind us of Aladdin and his</p>
