 <p>THE Upper Lusatian language is spoken in a district which may be marked by the towns of Löbau, Bautzen, and Muskau, while the Lower Lusatians dwell round the towns of Spremberg and Kottbus. Of the Upper Lusatians the larger portion live in Saxony and the smaller in Prussian territory; the Lower Lusatians are all Prussian subjects.</p>  
 <p>The <a href="sfs20.htm#an_14">Upper Lusatian story</a> illustrates, in folklore style, a moral principle of great value. The <a href="sfs21.htm#an_15">Lower Lusatian tale</a> is a variant of our own 'Little Red Ridinghood.' But it completes the story in such a manner as to explain the allegorical meaning of the narrative in the sense in which I am inclined to interpret it, as will be shown at the conclusion of the story.</p>  
 <p>But the Slavonic remnant in Lusatia is so surrounded by German territory, that most of its folklore has already been pressed into the service of the Germans.</p>  
 <p>A remarkable point in the Lusatian language is the completeness of the dual number in both nouns, adjectives, and verbs.</p>
