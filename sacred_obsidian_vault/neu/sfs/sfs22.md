 <p>THE Kashubians inhabit a small district in the North-east of Pomerania, 'the province upon the sea,' from <i>po</i>, upon, and <i>more</i>, the sea. The limits of the district may be roughly marked by the towns of Leba, Lauenburg and Bütow or Bytom.</p>  
 <p><a href="sfs23.htm#an_16">The story</a> contains many of the circumstances of the German story of 'The Table, the Ass and the Stick' in Grimm's collection. The Kashubian tales again would naturally be pressed into the service of the surrounding Germans. Bitter complaints have been made by Slavonic literati, that their Folklore tales have been appropriated by the Germans. Of course there is a vast amount of common ground in Folklore, and incidents belonging to one tale will sometimes start up at a distance in another apparently entirely unconnected with it. But I believe that there is considerable ground for the complaint.</p>
