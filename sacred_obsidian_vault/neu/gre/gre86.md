 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Of the Carline's evil Gift to Grettir.</p>
 <p>NOW wore away the time of autumn till it wanted but three weeks of winter; then the carline bade bear her to the sea-shore. Thorbiorn asked what she would there.</p>
 <p>"Little is my errand, yet maybe," she says, "it is a foreboding of greater tidings."</p>
 <p>Now was it done as she bade, and when she came down to the strand, she went limping along by the sea, as if she were led thereto, unto a place where lay before her an uprooted tree, as big as a man might bear on his shoulder. She looked at the tree and bade them turn it over before her eyes, and on one side it was as if singed and rubbed; so there whereas it was rubbed she let cut a little flat space; and then she took her knife and cut runes on the root, and made them red with her blood, and sang witch-words over</p>

 <p>them; then she went backwards and widdershins round about the tree, and cast over it many a strong spell; thereafter she let thrust the tree forth into the sea, and spake in such wise over it, that it should drive out to Drangey, and that Grettir should have all hurt therefrom that might be. Thereafter she went back home to Woodwick; and Thorbiorn said that he knew not if that would come to aught; but the carline answered that he should wot better anon.</p>
 <p>Now the wind blew landward up the firth, yet the carline's root went in the teeth of the wind, and belike it sailed swifter than might have been looked for of it.</p>
 <p>Grettir abode in Drangey with his fellows as is aforesaid, and in good case they were; but the day after the carline had wrought her witch-craft on the tree the brothers went down below the cliffs searching for firewood, so when they came to the west of the island, there they found that tree</p>
 <p>drifted ashore.</p>
 <p>Then said Illugi, "A big log of firewood, kinsman, let us bear it home."</p>
 <p>Grettir kicked it with his foot and said, "An evil tree from evil sent; other firewood than this shall we have."</p>
 <p>Therewithal he cast it out into the sea, and bade Illugi beware of bearing it home, "For it is sent us for our ill-hap." And therewith they went unto their abode, and said nought about it to the thrall. But the next day they found the tree again, and it was nigher to the ladders than heretofore, Grettir drave it out to sea, and said that it should never be borne home.</p>
 <p>Now the days wore on into summer, and a gale came on with much wet, and the brothers were loth to be abroad, and bade Noise go search for firewood.</p>
 <p>He took it ill, and said he was ill served in that he had to drudge and labour abroad in all the foulest weather; but</p>
 <p><a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a></p>
 <p>withal he went down to the beach before the ladders and found the carline's tree there, and deemed things had gone well because of it; so he took it up and bore it to the hut, and cast it down thereby with a mighty thump.</p>
 <p>Grettir heard it and said, "Noise has got something, so I shall go out and see what it is."</p>
 <p>Therewithal. he took up a wood-axe, and went out, and straightway Noise said, "Split it up in as good wise as I have brought it home, then."</p>
 <p>Grettir grew short of temper with the thrall, and smote the axe with both hands at the log, nor heeded what tree it was; but as soon as ever the axe touched the wood, it turned flatlings and glanced off therefrom into Grettir's right leg above the knee, in such wise that it stood in the bone, and a great wound was that. Then he looked at the tree and said,</p>
 <p>"Now has evil heart prevailed, nor will this hap go alone, since that same tree has now come back to us that I have cast out to sea on these two days. But for thee, Noise, two slips hast thou had, first, when thou must needs let the fire be slaked, and now this bearing home of that tree of ill-hap; but if a third thou hast, thy bane will it be, and the bane of us all."</p>
 <p>With that came Illugi and bound up Grettir's hurt, and it bled little, and Grettir slept well that night; and so three nights slipped by in such wise that no pain came of the wound, and when they loosed the swathings, the lips of the wound were come together so that it was well-nigh grown over again. Then said Illugi,</p>
 <p>"Belike thou wilt have no long hurt of this wound."</p>
 <p>"Well were it then," said Grettir, "but marvellously has this befallen, whatso may come of it; and my mind misgives me of the way things will take."</p>
