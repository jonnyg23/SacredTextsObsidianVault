 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAP. III.</h1>
 <p>AT that time were many great men west over the Sea, such as had fled from their lands in Norway before King Harald, because he had made all those outlaws, who had met him in battle, and taken to him their possessions. So, when Onund was healed of his wounds, he and Thrand went to meet Geirmund Helskin, because he was the most famed of vikings west there over the Sea, and they asked him whether he had any mind to seek after that kingdom which he had in Hordaland, and offered him their fellowship herein; for they deemed they had a sore loss of their lands there, since Onund was both mighty and of great kin.</p>
 <p>Geirmund said that so great had grown the strength of King Harald, that he deemed there was little hope that they would win honour in their war with him when men had been worsted, even when all the folk of the land had been drawn together; and yet withal that he was loth to become a king's thrall and pray for that which was his own; that he would find somewhat better to do than that; and now, too, he was no longer young. So Onund and his fellows went back to the South-isles, and there met many of their friends.</p>
 <p>There was a man, Ufeigh by name, who was bynamed</p>
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>
 <p>Grettir; he was the son of Einar, the son of Olvir Bairn-Carle; he was brother to Oleif the Broad, the father of Thormod Shaft; Steinulf was the name of Olvir Bairn-Carle's son, he was the father of Una whom Thorbiorn Salmon-Carle had to wife. Another son of Olvir Bairn-Carle was Steinmod, the father of Konal, who was the father of Aldis of Barra. The son of Konal was Steinmod, the father of Haldora, the wife of Eilif, the son of Ketil the One-handed. Ufeigh Grettir had to wife Asny, the daughter of Vestar Hængson; and Asmund the Beardless and Asbiorn were the sons of Ufeigh Grettir, but his daughters were these, Aldis, and Asa, and Asvor. Ufeigh had fled away west over the Sea before Harald the king, and so had Thormod Shaft his kinsman, and had with them their kith and kin; and they harried in Scotland, and far and wide west beyond the Sea.</p>
 <p>Now Thrand and Onund Treefoot made west for Ireland to find Eyvind the Eastman, Thrand's brother, who was Land-ward along the coasts of Ireland; the mother of Eyvind was Hlif, the daughter of Rolf, son of Ingiald, the son of King Frodi; but Thrand's mother was Helga, the daughter of Ondott the Crow; Biorn was the name of the father of Eyvind and Thrand, he was the son of Rolf from Am; he had had to flee from Gothland, for that he had burned in his house Sigfast, the son-in-law of King Solver; and thereafter had he gone to Norway, and was the next winter with Grim the hersir, the son of Kolbiorn the Abasher. Now Grim had a mind to murder Biorn for his money, so he fled thence to Ondott the Crow, who dwelt in Hvinisfirth in Agdir; he received Biorn well,, and Biorn was with him in the winter, but was in warfare in summertide, until Hlif his wife died; and after that Ondott gave Biorn Helga his daughter, and then Biorn left off warring.</p>

 <p>Now thereon Eyvind took to him the war-ships of his father, and was become a great chief west over the Sea he wedded Rafarta, the daughter of Kiarval, King of Ireland their sons were Helgi the Lean and Snbiorn.</p>
 <p>So when Thrand and Onund came to the South-isles, there they met Ufeigh Grettir and Thormod Shaft, and great friendship grew up betwixt them, for each thought he had gained from hell the last who had been left behind in Norway while the troubles there were at the highest. But Onund was exceeding moody, and when Thrand marked it, he asked what he was brooding over in his mind. Onund answered, and sang this stave--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>What joy since that day can I get<br>
 When shield-fire's thunder last I met<br>
 Ah, too soon clutch the claws of ill;<br>
 For that axe-edge shall grieve me still.<br>
 In eyes of fighting man and thane,<br>
 My strength and manhood are but vain,<br>
 This is the thing that makes me grow<br>
 A joyless man; is it enow?"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Thrand answered that whereso he was, he would still be deemed a brave man, "And now it is meet for thee to settle down and get married, and I would put forth my word and help, if I but knew whereto thou lookest."</p>
 <p>Onund said he did in manly wise, but that his good hope for matches of any gain was gone by now.</p>
 <p>Thrand answered, "Ufeigh has a daughter who is called Asa, thitherward will we turn if it seem good to thee." Onund showed that he was willing enough hereto; so after wards they talked the matter over with Ufeigh; he answered well, and said that he knew how that Onund was a man of</p>
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>
 <p>great kin and rich of chattels; "but his lands," said he, "I put at low worth, nor do I deem him to be a hale man, and withal my daughter is but a child."</p>
 <p>Thrand said, that Onund was a brisker man yet than many who were hale of both legs, and so by Thrand's help was this bargain struck; Ufeigh was to give his daughter but chattels for dowry, because those lands that were in Norway neither would lay down any money for.</p>
 <p>AL little after Thrand wooed the daughter of Thormod Shaft, and both were to sit in troth for three winters.</p>
 <p>So thereafter they went a harrying in the summer, but were in Barra in the winter-tide.</p>
