 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Of Thorstein Kuggson, and the gathering for the Bloodsuit for the Slaying of Thorgils Makson.</p>
 <p>THERE was a man called Thorstein, he was the son of Thorkel Kugg, the son of Thord the Yeller, the son</p>
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>
 <p>of Olaf Feilan, the son of Thorstein the Red, the son of And the Deep-minded. The mother of Thorstein Kuggson was Thurid the daughter of Asgeir Madpate, Asgeir was father's brother of Asmund the Greyhaired.</p>
 <p>Thorstein Kuggson was suitor in the case about Thorgils Makson's slaying along with Asmund the Greyhaired, who now sent word to Thorstein that he should come to meet him. Thorstein was a great champion, and the wildest-tempered of men; he went at once to meet his kinsman Asmund, and they talked the blood-suit over together. Thorstein was mightily wroth and said that no atonement should be for this, and said they had strength of kin enough to bring about for the slaying either outlawry or vengeance on men. Asmund said that he would follow him in whatsoever he would have done. They rode north to Thorvald their kinsman to pray his aid, and he quickly gave his word and said yea thereto. So they settled the suit against Thorgeir and Thormod; then Thorstein rode home to his farmstead, he then farmed at Liarskogar in Hvamsveit. Skeggi farmed at Hvam, he also joined in the suit with Thorstein. Skeggi was the son of Thorarinn Fylsenni, the son of Thord the Yeller; the mother of Skeggi was Fridgerd, daughter of Thord of Head.</p>
 <p>These had a many men with them at the Thing, and pushed their suit with great eagerness.</p>
 <p>Asmund and Thorvald rode from the north with six tens of men, and sat at Liarskogar many nights.</p>
