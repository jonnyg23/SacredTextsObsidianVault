 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Of Thorstein Dromond's Arms, and what he deemed they might do.</p>
 <p>NOW Grettir was with Thorstein for the rest of the winter and on into the spring; and it befell one morning, as those brothers, Thorstein and Grettir, lay in their sleeping-loft, that Grettir had laid his arms outside the bedclothes; and Thorstein was awake and saw it. Now Grettir woke up a little after, and then spake Thorstein:</p>
 <p>"I have seen thine arms, kinsman," said he, "and I deem it nowise wonderful, though thy strokes fall heavy on many, for no man's arms have I seen like thine."</p>
 <p>"Thou mayst know well enough," said Grettir, "that I should not have brought such things to pass as I have wrought, if I were not well knit."</p>
 <p>"Better should I deem it," said Thorstein, "if they were slenderer and somewhat luckier withal."</p>

 <p>Grettir said, "True it is, as folk say, <i>No man makes himself</i>; but let me see thine arms," said he.</p>
 <p>Thorstein did so; he was the longest and gauntest of men; and Grettir laughed, and said,</p>
 <p>"No need to look at that longer; hooked together are the ribs in thee; nor, methinks, have I ever seen such tongs as thou bearest about, and I deem thee to be scarce of a woman's strength."</p>
 <p>"That may be," said Thorstein; "yet shalt thou know that these same thin arms shall avenge thee, else shalt thou never be avenged; who may know what shall be, when all is over and done?"</p>
 <p>No more is told of their talk together; the spring wore on, and Grettir took ship in the summer. The brothers parted in friendship, and saw each other never after.</p>
