 <h1 align="CENTER">THE LAY CALLED THE SHORT LAY OF SIGURD.</h1><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Sigurd of yore,<br>
 Sought the dwelling of Giuki,<br>
 As he fared, the young Volsung,<br>
 After fight won;<br>
 Troth he took<br>
 From the two brethren;<br>
 Oath swore they betwixt them,<br>
 Those bold ones of deed.<br>
 A may they gave to him<br>
 And wealth manifold,<br>
 Gudrun the young,<br>
 Giuki's daughter:<br>
 They drank and gave doom<br>
 Many days together,<br>
 Sigurd the young,<br>
 And the sons of Giuki.<br>
 Until they wended<br>
 For Brynhild's wooing,<br>
 Sigurd a-riding<br>
 Amidst their rout;<br>
 The wise young Volsung<br>
 Who knew of all ways--<br>
 Ah! He had wed her,<br>
 Had fate so willed it.<br>
 Southlander Sigurd<br>
 A naked sword,<br>
 Bright, well grinded,<br>
 Laid betwixt them;<br>
 No kiss he won<br>
 From the fair woman,<br>
 Nor in arms of his<br>
 Did the Hun King hold her,<br>
 Since he gat the young maid<br>
 For the son of Giuki.<br>
 No lack in her life<br>
 She wotted of now,<br>
 And at her death-day<br>
 No dreadful thing<br>
 For a shame indeed<br>
 Or a shame in seeming;<br>
 But about and betwixt<br>
 Went baleful fate.<br>
 Alone, abroad,<br>
 She sat of an evening,<br>
 Of full many things<br>
 She fall a-talking:<br>
 "O for my Sigurd!<br>
 I shall have death,<br>
 Or my fair, my lovely,<br>
 Laid in mine arms.<br>
 "For the word once spoken,<br>
 I sorrow sorely--<br>
 His queen is Gudrun,<br>
 I am wed to Gunnar;<br>
 The dread Norns wrought for us<br>
 A long while of woe."<br>
 Oft with heart deep<br>
 In dreadful thoughts,<br>
 O'er ice-fields and ice-hills<br>
 She fared a-night time,<br>
 When he and Gudrun<br>
 Were gone to their fair bed,<br>
 And Sigurd wrapped<br>
 The bed-gear round her.<br>
 "Ah! Now the Hun King<br>
 His queen in arms holdeth,<br>
 While love I go lacking,<br>
 And all things longed for<br>
 With no delight<br>
 But in dreadful thought."<br>
 These dreadful things Thrust her toward murder:<br>
 "Listen, Gunnar,<br>
 For thou shalt lose<br>
 My wide lands,<br>
 Yea, me myself!<br>
 Never love I my life,<br>
 With thee for my lord--<br>
 "I will fare back thither<br>
 From whence I came,<br>
 To my nighest kin<br>
 And those that know me<br>
 There shall I sit<br>
 Sleeping my life away,<br>
 Unless thou slayest<br>
 Sigurd the Hun King,<br>
 Making thy might more<br>
 E'en than his might was!<br>
 "Yea, let the son fare<br>
 After the father,<br>
 And no young wolf<br>
 A long while nourish!<br>
 For on earth man lieth<br>
 Vengeance lighter,<br>
 And peace shall be surer<br>
 If the son live not."<br>
 Adrad was Gunnar,<br>
 Heavy-hearted was he,<br>
 And in doubtful mood<br>
 Day-long he sat.<br>
 For naught he wotted,<br>
 Nor might see clearly<br>
 What was the seemliest<br>
 Of deeds to set hand to;<br>
 What of all deeds<br>
 Was best to be done:<br>
 For he minded the vows<br>
 Sworn to the Volsung,<br>
 And the sore wrong<br>
 To be wrought against Sigurd.<br>
 Wavered his mind<br>
 A weary while,<br>
 No wont it was<br>
 Of those days worn by,<br>
 That queens should flee<br>
 From the realms of their kings.<br>
 "Brynhild to me<br>
 Is better than all,<br>
 The child of Budli<br>
 Is the best of women.<br>
 Yea, and my life<br>
 Will I lay down,<br>
 Ere I am twinned<br>
 From that woman's treasure."<br>
 He bade call Hogni<br>
 To the place where he bided;<br>
 With all the trust that might be,<br>
 Trowed he in him.<br>
 "Wilt thou bewray Sigurd<br>
 For his wealth's sake?<br>
 Good it is to rule<br>
 O'er the Rhine's metal;<br>
 And well content<br>
 Great wealth to wield,<br>
 Biding in peace<br>
 And blissful days."<br>
 One thing alone Hogni Had for an answer:<br>
 "Such doings for us<br>
 Are naught seemly to do;<br>
 To rend with sword<br>
 Oaths once sworn,<br>
 Oaths once sworn,<br>
 And troth once plighted.<br>
 "Nor know we on mould,<br>
 Men of happier days,<br>
 The while we four<br>
 Rule over the folk;<br>
 While the bold in battle,<br>
 The Hun King, bides living.<br>
 "And no nobler kin<br>
 Shall be known afield,<br>
 If our five sons<br>
 We long may foster;<br>
 Yea, a goodly stem<br>
 Shall surely wax.<br>
 But I clearly see<br>
 In what wise it standeth,<br>
 Brynhild's sore urging<br>
 O'ermuch on thee beareth.<br>
 "Guttorm shall we<br>
 Get for the slaying,<br>
 Our younger brother<br>
 Bare of wisdom;<br>
 For he was out of<br>
 All the oaths sworn,<br>
 All the oaths sworn,<br>
 And the plighted troth."<br>
 Easy to rouse him<br>
 Who of naught recketh!<br>
 Deep stood the sword<br>
 In the heart of Sigurd.<br>
 There, in the hall,<br>
 Gat the high-hearted vengeance;<br>
 For he can his sword<br>
 At the reckless slayer:<br>
 Out at Guttorm<br>
 Flew Gram the mighty,<br>
 The gleaming steel<br>
 From Sigurd's hand.<br>
 Down fell the slayer<br>
 Smitten asunder;<br>
 The heavy head<br>
 And the hands fell one way,<br>
 But the feet and such like<br>
 Aback where they stood.<br>
 Gudrun was sleeping<br>
 Soft in the bed,<br>
 Empty of sorrow<br>
 By the side of Sigurd:<br>
 When she awoke<br>
 With all pleasure gone,<br>
 Swimming in blood<br>
 Of Frey's beloved.<br>
 So sore her hands<br>
 She smote together,<br>
 That the great-hearted<br>
 Gat raised in bed;<br>
 "O Gudrun, weep not<br>
 So woefully,<br>
 Sweet lovely bride,<br>
 For thy brethren live for thee!<br>
 "A young child have I<br>
 For heritor;<br>
 Too young to win forth<br>
 From the house of his foes.--<br>
 Black deeds and ill<br>
 Have they been a-doing,<br>
 Evil rede<br>
 Have they wrought at last.<br>
 "Late, late, rideth with them<br>
 Unto the Thing,<br>
 Such sister's son,<br>
 Though seven thou bear,--<br>
 But well I wot<br>
 Which way all goeth;<br>
 Alone wrought Brynhild<br>
 This bale against us.<br>
 "That maiden loved me<br>
 Far before all men,<br>
 Yet wrong to Gunnar<br>
 I never wrought;<br>
 Brotherhood I heeded<br>
 And all bounden oaths,<br>
 That none should deem me<br>
 His queen's darling."<br>
 Weary sighed Gudrun,<br>
 As the king gat ending,<br>
 And so sore her hands<br>
 She smote together,<br>
 That the cups arow<br>
 Rang out therewith,<br>
 And the geese cried on high<br>
 That were in the homefield.<br>
 Then laughed Brynhild<br>
 Budli's daughter,<br>
 Once, once only,<br>
 From out her heart;<br>
 When to her bed<br>
 Was borne the sound<br>
 Of the sore greeting<br>
 Of Giuki's daughter.<br>
 Then, quoth Gunnar,<br>
 The king, the hawk-bearer,<br>
 "Whereas, thou laughest,<br>
 O hateful woman,<br>
 Glad on thy bed,<br>
 No good it betokeneth:<br>
 Why lackest thou else<br>
 Thy lovely hue?<br>
 Feeder of foul deeds,<br>
 Fey do I deem thee,<br>
 "Well worthy art thou<br>
 Before all women,<br>
 That thine eyes should see<br>
 Atli slain of us;<br>
 That thy brother's wounds<br>
 Thou shouldest see a-bleeding,<br>
 That his bloody hurts<br>
 Thine hands should bind."<br>
 "No man blameth thee, Gunnar,<br>
 Thou hast fulfilled death's measure<br>
 But naught Atli feareth<br>
 All thine ill will;<br>
 Life shall he lay down<br>
 Later than ye,<br>
 And still bear more might<br>
 Aloft than thy might.<br>
 "I shall tell thee, Gunnar,<br>
 Though well the tale thou knowest,<br>
 In what early days<br>
 Ye dealt abroad your wrong:<br>
 Young was I then,<br>
 Worn with no woe,<br>
 Good wealth I had<br>
 In the house of my brother!<br>
 "No mind had I<br>
 That a man should have me,<br>
 Or ever ye Giukings,<br>
 Rode into our garth;<br>
 There ye sat on your steeds<br>
 Three kings of the people--<br>
 Ah! That that faring<br>
 Had never befallen!<br>
 "Then spake Atli<br>
 To me apart,<br>
 And said that no wealth<br>
 He would give unto me,<br>
 Neither gold nor lands<br>
 If I would not be wedded;<br>
 Nay, and no part<br>
 Of the wealth apportioned,<br>
 Which in my first days<br>
 He gave me duly;<br>
 Which in my first days<br>
 He counted down.<br>
 "Wavered the mind<br>
 Within me then,<br>
 If to fight I should fall<br>
 And the felling of folk,<br>
 Bold in Byrny<br>
 Because of my brother;<br>
 A deed of fame<br>
 Had that been to all folk,<br>
 But to many a man<br>
 Sorrow of mind.<br>
 "So I let all sink<br>
 Into peace at the last:<br>
 More grew I minded<br>
 For the mighty treasure,<br>
 The red-shining rings<br>
 Of Sigmund's son;<br>
 For no man's wealth else<br>
 Would I take unto me.<br>
 "For myself had I given<br>
 To that great king<br>
 Who sat amid gold<br>
 On the back of Grani;<br>
 Nought were his eyes<br>
 Like to your eyen,<br>
 Nor in any wise<br>
 Went his visage with yours;<br>
 Though ye might deem you<br>
 Due kings of men.<br>
 "One I loved,<br>
 One, and none other,<br>
 The gold-decked may<br>
 Had no doubtful mind;<br>
 Thereof shall Atli<br>
 Wot full surely,<br>
 When he getteth to know<br>
 I am gone to the dead.<br>
 "Far be it from me,<br>
 Feeble and wavering,<br>
 Ever to love<br>
 Another's love--<br>
 Yes shall my woe<br>
 Be well avenged."<br>
 Up rose Gunnar,<br>
 The great men's leader,<br>
 And cast his arms<br>
 About the queen's neck;<br>
 And all went nigh<br>
 One after other,<br>
 With their whole hearts<br>
 Her heart to turn.<br>
 But then all these<br>
 From her neck she thrust,<br>
 Of her long journey<br>
 No man should let her.<br>
 Then called he Hogni<br>
 To have talk with him;<br>
 "Let all folk go<br>
 Forth into the hall,<br>
 Thine with mine--<br>
 O need sore and mighty!--<br>
 To wot if we yet<br>
 My wife's parting may stay.<br>
 Till with time's wearing<br>
 Some hindrance wax."<br>
 One answer Hogni<br>
 Had for all;<br>
 "Nay, let hard need<br>
 Have rule thereover,<br>
 And no man let her<br>
 Of her long journey!<br>
 Never born again,<br>
 May she come back thence!<br>
 "Luckless she came<br>
 To the lap of her mother,<br>
 Born into the world<br>
 For utter woe,<br>
 TO many a man<br>
 For heart-whole mourning."<br>
 Upraised he turned<br>
 From the talk and the trouble,<br>
 To where the gem-field<br>
 Dealt out goodly treasure;<br>
 As she looked and beheld<br>
 All the wealth that she had,<br>
 And the hungry bondmaids,<br>
 And maids of the hall.<br>
 With no good in her heart<br>
 She donned her gold byrny,<br>
 Ere she thrust the sword point<br>
 Through the midst of her body:<br>
 On the boister's far side<br>
 Sank she adown,<br>
 And, smitten with sword,<br>
 Still bethought her of redes.<br>
 "Let all come forth<br>
 Who are fain the red gold,<br>
 Or things less worthy<br>
 To win from my hands;<br>
 To each one I give<br>
 A necklace gilt over,<br>
 Wrought hangings and bed=gear,<br>
 And bright woven weed."<br>
 All they kept silence,<br>
 And thought what to speak,<br>
 Then all at once<br>
 Answer gave:<br>
 "Full enow are death-doomed,<br>
 Fain are we to live yet,<br>
 Maids of the hall<br>
 All meet work winning."<br>
 "From her wise heart at last<br>
 The linen-clad damsel,<br>
 The one of few years<br>
 Gave forth the word:<br>
 "I will that none driven<br>
 By hand or by word,<br>
 For our sake should lose<br>
 Well-loved life.<br>
 "Thou on the bones of you<br>
 Surely shall burn,<br>
 Less dear treasure<br>
 At your departing<br>
 Nor with Menia's Meal [1]<br>
 Shall ye come to see me."<br>
 "Sit thee down, Gunnar,<br>
 A word must I say to thee<br>
 Of the life's ruin<br>
 Of thy lightsome bride--<br>
 Nor shall thy ship<br>
 Swim soft and sweetly<br>
 For all that I<br>
 Lay life adown.<br>
 "Sooner than ye might deem<br>
 Shall ye make peace with Gudrun,<br>
 For the wise woman<br>
 Shall full in the young wife<br>
 The hard memory<br>
 Of her dead husband.<br>
 "There is a may born<br>
 Reared by her mother,<br>
 Whiter and brighter<br>
 Than is the bright day;<br>
 She shall be Swanhild,<br>
 She shall be Sunbeam.<br>
 "Thou shalt give Gudrun<br>
 Unto a great one,<br>
 Noble, well-praised<br>
 Of the world's folk;<br>
 Not with her goodwill,<br>
 Or love shalt thou give her;<br>
 Yet will Atli<br>
 Come to win her,<br>
 My very brother,<br>
 Born of Budli.<br>
 "Ah! Many a memory<br>
 Of how ye dealt with me,<br>
 How sorely, how evilly<br>
 Ye ever beguiled me,<br>
 How all pleasure left me<br>
 The while my life lasted!--<br>
 "Fain wilt thou be<br>
 Oddrun to win,<br>
 But thy good liking<br>
 Shall Atli let;<br>
 But in secret wise<br>
 Shall ye win together,<br>
 And she shall love thee<br>
 As I had loved thee,<br>
 If in such wise<br>
 Fare had willed it.<br>
 "But with all ill<br>
 Shall Atli sting thee,<br>
 Into the strait worm-close<br>
 Shall he cast thee.<br>
 "But no long space<br>
 Shall slip away<br>
 Ere Atli too<br>
 All life shall lose,<br>
 Yea, all his weal<br>
 With the life of his sons,<br>
 For a dreadful bed<br>
 Dights Gudrun for him,<br>
 From a heart sore laden,<br>
 With the sword's sharp edge.<br>
 "More seemly for Gudrun,<br>
 Your very sister,<br>
 In death to wend after<br>
 Her love first wed;<br>
 Had but good rede<br>
 To her been given,<br>
 Or if her heart<br>
 Had been like to my heart.<br>
 "Faint my speech groweth--<br>
 But for our sake<br>
 Ne'er shall she lose<br>
 Her life beloved;<br>
 The sea shall have her,<br>
 High billows bear her<br>
 Forth unto Jonakr's<br>
 Fair land of his fathers.<br>
 "There shall she bear sons,<br>
 Stays of a heritage,<br>
 Stays of a heritage,<br>
 Jonakr's sons;<br>
 And Swanhild shall she<br>
 Send from the land,<br>
 That may born of her,<br>
 The may born of Sigurd.<br>
 "Her shall bite<br>
 The rede of Bikki,<br>
 Whereas for no good<br>
 Wins Jormunrek life;<br>
 And so is clean perished<br>
 All the kin of Sigurd,<br>
 Yea, and more greeting,<br>
 And more for Gudrun.<br>
 "And now one prayer<br>
 Yet pray I of thee--<br>
 That last word of mine<br>
 Here in the world--<br>
 So broad on the field<br>
 Be the burg of the dead<br>
 That fair space may be left<br>
 For us all to lie down,<br>
 All those that died<br>
 At Sigurd's death!<br>
 "Hang round that burg<br>
 Fair hangings and shields,<br>
 Web by Gauls woven,<br>
 And folk of the Gauls:<br>
 There burn the Hun King<br>
 Lying beside me.<br>
 "But on the other side<br>
 Burn by the Hun King<br>
 Those who served me<br>
 Strewn with treasure;<br>
 Two at the head,<br>
 And two at the feet,<br>
 Two hounds therewith,<br>
 And two hawks moreover:<br>
 Then is all dealt<br>
 With even dealing.<br>
 "Lay there amidst us<br>
 The right-dight metal,<br>
 The sharp-edged steel,<br>
 That so lay erst;<br>
 When we both together<br>
 Into one bed went,<br>
 And were called by the name<br>
 Of man and wife.<br>
 "Never, then, belike<br>
 Shall clash behind him<br>
 Valhall's bright door<br>
 With rings bedight:<br>
 And if my fellowship<br>
 Followeth after,<br>
 In no wretched wise<br>
 Then shall we wend.<br>
 "For him shall follow<br>
 My five bondmaids,<br>
 My eight bondsmen,<br>
 No borel folk:<br>
 Yea, and my fosterer,<br>
 And my father's dower<br>
 That Budli of old days<br>
 Gave to his dear child.<br>
 "Much have I spoken,<br>
 More would I speak,<br>
 If the sword would give me<br>
 Space for speech;<br>
 But my words are waning,<br>
 My wounds are swelling--<br>
 Naught but truth have I told--<br>
 And now make I ending."</p></dir>
