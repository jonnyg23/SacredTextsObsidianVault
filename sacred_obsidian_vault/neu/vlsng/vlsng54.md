 <h1 align="CENTER">THE LAY OF HAMDIR</h1><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Great deeds of bale<br>
 In the garth began,<br>
 At the sad dawning<br>
 The tide of Elves' sorrow<br>
 When day is a-waxing<br>
 And man's grief awaketh,<br>
 And the sorrow of each one<br>
 The early day quickeneth.<br>
 Not now, not now,<br>
 Nor yesterday,<br>
 But long ago<br>
 Has that day worn by,<br>
 That ancientest time,<br>
 The first time to tell of,<br>
 Then, whenas Gudrun,<br>
 Born of Giuki,<br>
 Whetter her sons<br>
 To Swanhild's avenging.<br>
 "Your sister's name<br>
 Was naught but Swanhild,<br>
 Whom Jormunrek<br>
 With horses has trodden!--<br>
 White horses and black<br>
 On the war-beaten way,<br>
 Grey horses that go<br>
 On the roads of the Goths.<br>
 "All alone am I now<br>
 As in holt is the aspen;<br>
 As the fir-tree of boughs,<br>
 So of kin am I bare;<br>
 As bare of things longed for<br>
 As the willow of leaves<br>
 When the bough-breaking wind<br>
 The warm day endeth.<br>
 "Few, sad, are ye left<br>
 O kings of my folk!<br>
 Yet alone living<br>
 Last shreds of my kin!<br>
 "Ah, naught are ye grown<br>
 As that Gunnar of old days;<br>
 Naught are your hearts<br>
 As the heart of Hogni!<br>
 Well would ye seek<br>
 Vengeance to win<br>
 If your hearts were in aught<br>
 As the hearts of my brethren!"<br>
 Then spake Hamdir The high-hearted:<br>
 "Nought hadst thou to praise<br>
 The doings of Hogni,<br>
 When they woke up Sigurd<br>
 From out of slumber,<br>
 And in bed thou sat'st up<br>
 'Mid the banes-men's laughter.<br>
 "Then when thy bed-gear,<br>
 Blue-white, well woven<br>
 By art of craftsmen<br>
 All swam with thy king's blood;<br>
 The Sigurd died,<br>
 O'er his dead corpse thou sattest,<br>
 Not heeding aught gladsome,<br>
 Since Gunnar so willed it.<br>
 "Great grief for Atli<br>
 Gatst thou by Erp's murder,<br>
 And the end of thine Eitil,<br>
 But worse grief for thyself.<br>
 Good to use sword<br>
 For the slaying of others<br>
 In such wise that its edge<br>
 Shall not turn on ourselves!"<br>
 Then well spake Sorli<br>
 From a heart full of wisdom:<br>
 "No words will I<br>
 Make with my mother,<br>
 Though both ye twain<br>
 Need words belike--<br>
 What askest thou, Gudrun,<br>
 To let thee go greeting?<br>
 "Weep for thy brethren,<br>
 Weep for thy sweet sons,<br>
 And thy nighest kinsfolk<br>
 Laid by the fight-side!<br>
 Yea, and thou Gudrun,<br>
 May'st greet for us twain<br>
 Sitting fey on our steeds<br>
 Doomed in far lands to die."<br>
 From the garth forth they went<br>
 With hearts full of fury,<br>
 Sorli and Hamdir,<br>
 The sons of Gudrun,<br>
 And they met on the way<br>
 The wise in all wiles:<br>
 "And thou little Erp,<br>
 What helping from thee?"<br>
 He of alien womb<br>
 Spake out in such wise:<br>
 "Good help for my kin,<br>
 Such as foot gives to foot,<br>
 Or flesh-covered hand<br>
 Gives unto hand!"<br>
 "What helping for foot<br>
 That help that foot giveth,<br>
 Or for flesh-covered hand<br>
 The helping of hand?"<br>
 Then spake Erp<br>
 Yet once again<br>
 Mock spake the prince<br>
 As he sat on his steed:<br>
 "Fool's deed to show<br>
 The way to a dastard!"<br>
 "Bold beyond measure,"<br>
 Quoth they, "is the base-born!"<br>
 Out from the sheath<br>
 Drew they the sheath-steel,<br>
 And the glaives' edges played<br>
 For the pleasure of hell;<br>
 By the third part they minished<br>
 The might that they had,<br>
 Their young kin they let lie<br>
 A-cold on the earth.<br>
 Then their fur-cloaks they shook<br>
 And bound fast their swords,<br>
 In webs goodly woven<br>
 Those great ones were clad;<br>
 Young they went o'er the fells<br>
 Where the dew was new-fallen<br>
 Swift, on steeds of the Huns,<br>
 Heavy vengeance to wreak.<br>
 Forth stretched the ways,<br>
 And an ill way they found,<br>
 Yea, their sister's son [1]<br>
 Hanging slain upon tree--<br>
 Wolf-trees by the wind made cold<br>
 At the town's westward<br>
 Loud with cranes' clatter--<br>
 Ill abiding there long!<br>
 Din in the king's hall<br>
 Of men merry with drink,<br>
 And none might hearken<br>
 The horses' tramping<br>
 Or ever the warders<br>
 Their great horn winded.<br>
 Then men went forth<br>
 To Jormunrek<br>
 To tell of the heeding<br>
 Of men under helm:<br>
 "Give ye good counsel!<br>
 Great ones are come hither,<br>
 For the wrong of men mighty<br>
 Was the may to death trodden."<br>
 "Loud Jormunrek laughed,<br>
 And laid hand to his beard,<br>
 Nor bade bring his byrny,<br>
 But with the wine fighting,<br>
 Shook his red locks,<br>
 On his white shield sat staring,<br>
 And in his hand<br>
 Swung the gold cup on high.<br>
 "Sweet sight for me<br>
 Those twain to set eyes on,<br>
 Sorli and Hamdir,<br>
 Here in my hall!<br>
 Then with bowstrings<br>
 Would I bind them,<br>
 And hang the good Giukings<br>
 Aloft on the gallows!"</p>
 <p>Then spake Hrothglod<br>
 From off the high steps,<br>
 Spake the slim-fingered<br>
 Unto her son,--<br>
 For a threat was cast forth<br>
 Of what ne'er should fall--<br>
 "Shall two men alone<br>
 Two hundred Gothfolk<br>
 Bind or bear down<br>
 In the midst of their burg?"</p>
 <p>Strife and din in the hall,<br>
 Cups smitten asunder<br>
 Men lay low in blood<br>
 From the breasts of Goths flowing.<br>
 Then spake Hamdir,<br>
 The high-hearted:<br>
 "Thou cravedst, O king,<br>
 From the coming of us,<br>
 The sons of one mother,<br>
 Amidmost thine hall--<br>
 Look on these hands of thine,<br>
 Look on these feet of thine,<br>
 Cast by us, Jormunrek,<br>
 On to the flame!"<br>
 Then cried aloud<br>
 The high Gods' kinsman [2]<br>
 Bold under byrny,--<br>
 Roared he as bears roar;<br>
 "Stones to the stout ones<br>
 That the spears bite not,<br>
 Nor the edges of steel,<br>
 These sons of Jonakr!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>QUOTH SORLI:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Bale, brother, wroughtst thou<br>
 By that bag's [3] opening,<br>
 Oft from that bag<br>
 Rede of bale cometh!<br>
 Heart hast thou, Hamdir,<br>
 If thou hadst heart's wisdom<br>
 Great lack in a man<br>
 Who lacks wisdom and lore!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAMDIR SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Yes, off were the head<br>
 If Erp were alive yet,<br>
 Our brother the bold<br>
 Whom we slew by the way;<br>
 The far-famed through the world--<br>
 Ah, the fares drave me on,<br>
 And the man war made holy,<br>
 There must I slay!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>SORLI SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Unmeet we should do<br>
 As the doings of wolves are,<br>
 Raising wrong each 'gainst other<br>
 As the dogs of the Norns,<br>
 The greedy ones nourished<br>
 In waste steads of the world.<br>
 In strong wise have we fought,<br>
 On Goths' corpses we stand,<br>
 Beat down by our edges,<br>
 E'en as ernes on the bough.<br>
 Great fame our might winneth,<br>
 Die we now, or to-morrow,--<br>
 No man lives till eve<br>
 Whom the fates doom at morning."<br>
 At the hall's gable-end<br>
 Fell Sorli to earth,<br>
 But Hamdir lay low<br>
 At the back of the houses.</p></dir>

 <p>Now this is called the Ancient Lay of Hamdir.</p>
