 <h1 align="CENTER">THE SONG OF ATLI.</h1>
 <p>Gudrun, Giuki's daughter, avenger her brethren, as is told far and wide; first she slew the sons of Atli, and then Atli himself; and she burned the hall thereafter, and all the household with it: and about these matters is this song made:--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>In days long gone<br>
 Sent Atli to Gunnar<br>
 A crafty one riding,<br>
 Knefrud men called him;<br>
 To Giuki's garth came he,<br>
 To the hall of Gunnar,<br>
 To the benches gay-dight,<br>
 And the gladsome drinking.<br>
 There drank the great folk<br>
 'Mid the guileful one's silence,<br>
 Drank wine in their fair hall:<br>
 The Huns' wrath they feared<br>
 When Knefrud cried<br>
 In his cold voice,<br>
 As he sat on the high seat,<br>
 That man of the Southland:<br>
 "Atli has sent me<br>
 Riding swift on his errands<br>
 On the bit-griping steed<br>
 Through dark woodways unbeaten,<br>
 To bid thee, King Gunnar,<br>
 Come to his fair bench<br>
 With helm well-adorned,<br>
 To the house of King Atli.<br>
 "Shield shall ye have there<br>
 And spears ashen-shafted,<br>
 Helms ruddy with gold,<br>
 And hosts of the Huns;<br>
 Saddle-gear silver gilt,<br>
 Shirts red as blood,<br>
 The hedge of the warwife,<br>
 And horses bit-griping.<br>
 "And he saith he will give you<br>
 Gnitaheath widespread,<br>
 And whistling spears<br>
 And prows well-gilded,<br>
 Might wealth<br>
 With the stead of Danpi,<br>
 And that noble wood<br>
 Men name the Murkwood."<br>
 Then Gunnar turned head<br>
 And spake unto Hogni:<br>
 "What rede from thee, high one,<br>
 Since such things we hear?<br>
 No gold know I<br>
 On Gnitaheath,<br>
 That we for our parts<br>
 Have not portion as great.<br>
 "Seven halls we have<br>
 Fulfilled of swords,<br>
 And hilts of gold<br>
 Each sword there has;<br>
 My horse is the best,<br>
 My blade is the keenest;<br>
 Fair my bow o'er the bench is,<br>
 Gleams my byrny with gold;<br>
 Brightest helm, brightest shield,<br>
 From Kiar's dwelling ere brought--<br>
 Better all things I have<br>
 Than all things of the Huns."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HOGNI SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"What mind has our sister<br>
 That a ring she hath sent us<br>
 In weed of wolves clad?<br>
 Bids she not to be wary?<br>
 For a wolf's hair I found<br>
 The fair ring wreathed about;<br>
 Wolf beset shall the way be<br>
 If we wend on this errand."<br>
 No sons whetted Gunnar,<br>
 Nor none of his kin,<br>
 Nor learned men nor wise men,<br>
 Nor such as were mighty.<br>
 Then spake Gunnar<br>
 E'en as a king should speak,<br>
 Glorious in mead-hall<br>
 From great heart and high:<br>
 "Rise up now, Fiornir,<br>
 Forth down the benches<br>
 Let the gold-cups of great ones<br>
 Pass in hands of my good-men!<br>
 Well shall we drink wine,<br>
 Draughts dear to our hearts,<br>
 Though the last of all feasts<br>
 In our fair house this be!<br>
 "For the wolves shall rule<br>
 O'er the wealth of the Niblungs,<br>
 With the pine-woods' wardens<br>
 In Gunnar perish:<br>
 And the black-felled bears<br>
 With fierce teeth shall bite<br>
 For the glee of the dog kind,<br>
 If again comes not Gunnar."<br>
 Then good men never shamed,<br>
 Greeting aloud,<br>
 Led the great king of men<br>
 From the garth of his home;<br>
 And cried the fair son<br>
 Of Hogni the king:<br>
 "Fare happy, O Lords,<br>
 Whereso your hearts lead you!"<br>
 Then the bold knights<br>
 Let their bit-griping steeds<br>
 Wend swift o'er the fells,<br>
 Tread the murk-wood unknown,<br>
 All the Hunwood was shaking<br>
 As the hardy ones fared there;<br>
 O'er the green meads they urged<br>
 Their steeds shy of the goad.<br>
 Then Atli's land saw they;<br>
 Great towers and strong,<br>
 And the bold men of Bikki,<br>
 Aloft on the burg:<br>
 The Southland folks' hall<br>
 Set with benches about,<br>
 Dight with bucklers well bounden,<br>
 And bright white shining shields.<br>
 There drank Atli,<br>
 The awful Hun king,<br>
 Wine in his fair hall;<br>
 Without were the warders,<br>
 Gunnar's folk to have heed of,<br>
 Lest they had fared thither<br>
 With the whistling spear<br>
 War to wake 'gainst the king.<br>
 But first came their sister<br>
 As they came to the hall,<br>
 Both her brethren she met,<br>
 With beer little gladdened:<br>
 "Bewrayed art thou, Gunnar!<br>
 What dost thou great king<br>
 To deal war to the Huns?<br>
 Go thou swift from the hall!<br>
 Better, brother, hadst thou<br>
 Fared here in thy byrny<br>
 Than with helm gaily dight<br>
 Looked on Atli's great house:<br>
 Them hadst sat then in saddle<br>
 Through days bright with the sun<br>
 Fight to awaken<br>
 And fair fields to redden:<br>
 "O'er the folk fate makes pale<br>
 Should the Norn's tears have fallen,<br>
 The shield mays of the Huns<br>
 Should have known of all sorrow;<br>
 And King Atli himself<br>
 To worm-close should be brought;<br>
 But now is the worm-close<br>
 Kept but for thee."<br>
 Then spake Gunnar<br>
 Great 'mid the people:<br>
 "Over-late sister<br>
 The Niblungs to summon;<br>
 A long way to seek<br>
 The helping of warriors,<br>
 The high lord unshamed,<br>
 From the hills of the Rhine!"<br>
 Seven Hogni beat down<br>
 With his sword sharp-grinded,<br>
 And the eighth man he thrust<br>
 Amidst of the fire.<br>
 Ever so shall famed warrior<br>
 Fight with his foemen,<br>
 As Hogni fought<br>
 For the hand of Gunnar.<br>
 But on Gunnar they fell,<br>
 And set him in fetters,<br>
 And bound hard and fast<br>
 That friend of Burgundians;<br>
 Then the warrior they asked<br>
 If he would buy life,<br>
 But life with gold<br>
 That king of the Goths.<br>
 Nobly spake Gunnar,<br>
 Great lord of the Niblungs;<br>
 "Hogni's bleeding heart first<br>
 Shall lie in mine hand,<br>
 Cut from the breast<br>
 Of the bold-riding lord,<br>
 With bitter-sharp knife<br>
 From the son of the king."<br>
 With guile the great one<br>
 Would they beguile,<br>
 On the wailing thrall<br>
 Laid they hand unwares,<br>
 And cut the heart<br>
 From out of Hjalli,<br>
 Laid it bleeding on trencher<br>
 And bare it to Gunnar.<br>
 "Here have I the heart<br>
 Of Hjalli the trembler,<br>
 Little like the heart<br>
 Of Hogni the hardy:<br>
 As much as it trembleth<br>
 Laid on the trencher<br>
 By the half more it trembled<br>
 In the breast of him hidden."<br>
 Then laughed Hogni<br>
 When they cut the heart from him,<br>
 From the crest-smith yet quick,<br>
 Little thought he to quail.<br>
 The hard acorn of thought<br>
 From the high king they took,<br>
 Laid it bleeding on trencher<br>
 And bare it Gunnar.<br>
 "Here have I the heart<br>
 Of Hogni the hardy,<br>
 Little like to the heart<br>
 Of Hjalli the trembler.<br>
 Howso little it quaketh<br>
 Laid here on the dish,<br>
 Yet far less it quaked<br>
 In the breast of him laid.<br>
 "So far mayst thou bide<br>
 From men's eyen, O Atli,<br>
 As from that treasure<br>
 Thou shalt abide!<br>
 "Behold in my heart<br>
 Is hidden for ever<br>
 That hoard of the Niblungs,<br>
 Now Hogni is dead.<br>
 Doubt threw me two ways<br>
 While the twain of us lived,<br>
 But all that is gone<br>
 Now I live on alone.<br>
 "The great Rhine shall rule<br>
 O'er the hate-raising treasure,<br>
 That gold of the Niblungs,<br>
 The seed of the gods:<br>
 In the weltering water<br>
 Shall that wealth lie a-gleaming,<br>
 Or it shine on the hands<br>
 Of the children of Huns!"<br>
 Then cried Atli,<br>
 King of the Hun-folk,<br>
 "Drive forth your wains now<br>
 The slave is fast bounden."<br>
 And straightly thence<br>
 The bit-shaking steeds<br>
 Drew the hoard-warden,<br>
 The war-god to his death.<br>
 Atli the great king,<br>
 Rode upon Glaum,<br>
 With shields set round about,<br>
 And sharp thorns of battle:<br>
 Gudrun, bound by wedlock<br>
 To these, victory made gods of,<br>
 Held back her tears<br>
 As the hall she ran into.<br>
 "Let it fare with thee, Atli,<br>
 E'en after thine oaths sworn<br>
 To Gunnar fell often;<br>
 Yea, oaths sworn of old time,<br>
 By the sun sloping southward,<br>
 By the high burg of Sigry,<br>
 By the fair bed of rest,<br>
 By the red ring of Ull!"<br>
 Now a host of men<br>
 Cast the high king alive<br>
 Into a close<br>
 Crept o'er within<br>
 With most foul worms,<br>
 Fulfilled of all venom,<br>
 Ready grave to dig<br>
 In his doughty heart.<br>
 Wrathful-hearted he smote<br>
 The harp with his hand,<br>
 Gunnar laid there alone;<br>
 And loud rang the strings.--<br>
 In such wise ever<br>
 Should hardy ring-scatterer<br>
 Keep gold from all folk<br>
 In the garth of his foeman.<br>
 Then Atli would wend<br>
 About his wide land,<br>
 On his steed brazen shod,<br>
 Back from the murder.<br>
 Din there was in the garth,<br>
 All thronged with the horses;<br>
 High the weapon-song rose<br>
 From men come from the heath.<br>
 Out then went Gudrun,<br>
 'Gainst Atli returning,<br>
 With a cup gilded over,<br>
 To greet the land's ruler;<br>
 "Come, then, and take it,<br>
 King glad in thine hall,<br>
 From Gudrun's hands,<br>
 For the hell-farers groan not!"<br>
 Clashed the beakers of Atli,<br>
 Wine-laden on bench,<br>
 As in hall there a-gathered,<br>
 The Huns fell a-talking,<br>
 And the long-bearded eager ones<br>
 Entered therein,<br>
 From a murk den new-come,<br>
 From the murder of Gunnar.<br>
 Then hastened the sweet-faced<br>
 Delight of the shield-folk,<br>
 Bright in the fair hall,<br>
 Wine to bear to them:<br>
 The dreadful woman<br>
 Gave dainties withal<br>
 To the lords pale with fate,<br>
 Laid strange word upon Atli:<br>
 "The hearts of thy sons<br>
 Hast thou eaten, sword-dealer,<br>
 All bloody with death<br>
 And drenched with honey:<br>
 In most heavy mood<br>
 Brood o'er venison of men!<br>
 Drink rich draughts therewith,<br>
 Down the high benches send it!<br>
 "Never callest thou now<br>
 From henceforth to thy knee<br>
 Fair Erp or fair Eiril,<br>
 Bright-faced with the drink;<br>
 Never seest thou them now<br>
 Amidmost the seat,<br>
 Scattering the gold,<br>
 Or shafting of spears;<br>
 Manes trimming duly,<br>
 Or driving steeds forth!"<br>
 Din arose from the benches,<br>
 Dread song of men was there,<br>
 Noise 'mid the fair hangings,<br>
 As all Hun's children wept;<br>
 All saving Gudrun,<br>
 Who never gat greeting,<br>
 For her brethren bear-hardy<br>
 For her sweet sons and bright,<br>
 The young ones, the simple<br>
 Once gotten with Atli.</p>
 <p>The seed of gold<br>
 Sowed the swan-bright woman,<br>
 Rings of red gold<br>
 She gave to the house-carls;<br>
 Fate let she wax,<br>
 Let the bright gold flow forth,<br>
 In naught spared that woman<br>
 The store-houses' wealth.<br>
 Atli unaware<br>
 Was a-weary with drink;<br>
 No weapon had he,<br>
 No heeding of Gudrun--<br>
 Ah, the pity would be better,<br>
 When in soft wise they twain<br>
 Would full often embrace<br>
 Before the great lords!<br>
 To the bed with sword-point<br>
 Blood gave she to drink<br>
 With a hand fain of death,<br>
 And she let the dogs loose:<br>
 Then in from the hall-door--<br>
 Up waked the house-carls--<br>
 Hot brands she cast,<br>
 Gat revenge for her brethren.<br>
 To the flame gave she all<br>
 Who therein might be found;<br>
 Fell adown the old timbers,<br>
 Reeked all treasure-houses;<br>
 There the shield-mays were burnt,<br>
 Their lives' span brought to naught;<br>
 In the fierce fire sank down<br>
 All the stead of the Budlungs.<br>
 Wide told of is this--<br>
 Ne'er sithence in the world,<br>
 Thus fared bride clad in byrny<br>
 For her brothers' avenging;<br>
 For behold, this fair woman<br>
 To three kings of the people,<br>
 Hath brought very death<br>
 Or ever she died!</p></dir>
