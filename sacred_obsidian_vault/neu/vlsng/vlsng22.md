 <h2 align="CENTER">Of Sigurd's Meeting with Brynhild on the Mountain.</h2>
 <p>By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on to Hindfell, and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; and he sees before him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning, and flaming up even unto the heavens; and when he came thereto, lo, a shield hung castle before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof: into the castle went Sigurd, and saw one lying there asleep, and all-armed. Therewith he takes the helm from off the head of him, and sees that it is no man, but a woman; and she was clad in a byrny as closely set on her as though it had gown to her flesh; so he rent it from the collar downwards; and then the sleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit on it as if it were cloth. Then said Sigurd that over-long had she lain asleep; but she asked--</p>
 <p>"What thing of great might is it that has prevailed to rend my byrny, and draw me from my sleep?"</p>
 <p>Even as sings the song [1]</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"What bit on the byrny,<br>
 Why breaks my sleep away,<br>
 Who has turned from me<br>
 My wan tormenting?"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>"Ah, is it so, that here is come Sigurd Sigmundson, bearing Fafnir's helm on his head and Fafnir's bane in his hand?"</p>
 <p>Then answered Sigurd--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Sigmund's son<br>
 With Sigurd's sword<br>
 E'en now rent down<br>
 The raven's wall."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>"Of the Volsung's kin is he who has done the deed; but now I have heard that thou art daughter of a mighty king, and folk have told us that thou wert lovely and full of lore, and now I will try the same."</p>
 <p>Then Brynhild sang--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Long have I slept<br>
 And slumbered long,<br>
 Many and long are the woes of mankind,<br>
 By the might of Odin<br>
 Must I bide helpless<br>
 To shake from off me the spells of slumber.<br>
 "Hail to the day come back!<br>
 Hail, sons of the daylight!<br>
 Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!<br>
 Look with kind eyes a-down,<br>
 On us sitting here lonely,<br>
 And give unto us the gain that we long for.<br>
 "Hail to the Aesir,<br>
 And the sweet Asyniur! [2]<br>
 Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!<br>
 Fair words, wise hearts,<br>
 Would we win from you,<br>
 And healing hands while life we hold."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then Brynhild speaks again and says, "Two kings fought, one hight Helm Gunnar, an old man, and the greatest of warriors, and Odin had promised the victory unto him; but his foe was Agnar, or Audi's brother, and so I smote down Helm Gunnar in the fight; and Odin, in vengeance for that deed, stuck the sleep-thorn into me, and said that I should never again have the victory, but should be given away in marriage; but there against I vowed a vow, that never would I wed one who knew the name of fear."</p>
 <p>Then said Sigurd, "Teach us the lore of mighty matters!"</p>
 <p>She said, "Belike thou cannest more skill in all than I; yet will I teach thee; yea, and with thanks, if there be aught of my cunning that will in anywise pleasure thee, either of runes or of other matters that are the root of things; but now let us drink together, and may the Gods give to us twain a good day, that thou mayst win good help and fame from my wisdom, and that thou mayst hereafter mind thee of that which we twain speak together."</p>
 <p>Then Brynhild filled a beaker and bore it to Sigurd, and gave him the drink of love, and spake--</p><dir>
 
 <p>"Beer bring I to thee,<br>
 Fair fruit of the byrnies' clash,<br>
 Mixed is it mightily,<br>
 Mingled with fame,<br>
 Brimming with bright lays<br>
 And pitiful runes,<br>
 Wise words, sweet words,<br>
 Speech of great game.<br>
 "Runes of war know thou,<br>
 If great thou wilt be!<br>
 Cut them on hilt of hardened sword,<br>
 Some on the brand's back,<br>
 Some on its shining side,<br>
 Twice name Tyr therein.<br>
 "Sea-runes good at need,<br>
 Learnt for ship's saving,<br>
 For the good health of the swimming horse;<br>
 On the stern cut them,<br>
 Cut them on the rudder-blade<br>
 And set flame to shaven oar:<br>
 Howso big be the sea-hills,<br>
 Howso blue beneath,<br>
 Hail from the main then comest thou home.<br>
 "Word-runes learn well<br>
 If thou wilt that no man<br>
 Pay back grief for the grief thou gavest;<br>
 Wind thou these,<br>
 Weave thou these,<br>
 Cast thou these all about thee,<br>
 At the Thing,<br>
 Where folk throng,<br>
 Unto the full doom faring.<br>
 "Of ale-runes know the wisdom<br>
 If thou wilt that another's wife<br>
 Should not bewray thine heart that trusteth:<br>
 Cut them on the mead-horn,<br>
 On the back of each hand,<br>
 And nick an N upon thy nail.<br>
 "Ale have thou heed<br>
 To sign from all harm<br>
 Leek lay thou in the liquor,<br>
 Then I know for sure<br>
 Never cometh to thee,<br>
 Mead with hurtful matters mingled.<br>
 "Help-runes shalt thou gather<br>
 If skill thou wouldst gain<br>
 To loosen child from low-laid mother;<br>
 Cut be they in hands hollow,<br>
 Wrapped the joints round about;<br>
 Call for the Good-folks' gainsome helping.<br>
 "Learn the bough-runes wisdom<br>
 If leech-lore thou lovest;<br>
 And wilt wot about wounds' searching<br>
 On the bark be they scored;<br>
 On the buds of trees<br>
 Whose boughs look eastward ever.<br>
 "Thought-runes shalt thou deal with<br>
 If thou wilt be of all men<br>
 Fairest-souled wight, and wisest,<br>
 These areded<br>
 These first cut<br>
 These first took to heart high Hropt.<br>
 "On the shield were they scored<br>
 That stands before the shining God,<br>
 On Early-waking's ear,<br>
 On All-knowing's hoof,<br>
 On the wheel which runneth<br>
 Under Rognir's chariot;<br>
 On Sleipnir's jaw-teeth,<br>
 On the sleigh's traces.<br>
 "On the rough bear's paws,<br>
 And on Bragi's tongue,<br>
 On the wolfs claws,<br>
 And on eagle's bill,<br>
 On bloody wings,<br>
 And bridge's end;<br>
 On loosing palms,<br>
 And pity's path:<br>
 "On glass, and on gold,<br>
 And on goodly silver,<br>
 In wine and in wort,<br>
 And the seat of the witch-wife;<br>
 On Gungnir's point,<br>
 And Grani's bosom;<br>
 On the Norn's nail,<br>
 And the neb of the night-owl.<br>
 "All these so cut,<br>
 Were shaven and sheared,<br>
 And mingled in with holy mead,<br>
 And sent upon wide ways enow;<br>
 Some abide with the Elves,<br>
 Some abide with the Aesir,<br>
 Or with the wise Vanir,<br>
 Some still hold the sons of mankind.<br>
 "These be the book-runes,<br>
 And the runes of good help,<br>
 And all the ale-runes,<br>
 And the runes of much might;<br>
 To whomso they may avail,<br>
 Unbewildered unspoilt;<br>
 They are wholesome to have:<br>
 Thrive thou with these then.<br>
 When thou hast learnt their lore,<br>
 Till the Gods end thy life-days.<br>
 "Now shalt thou choose thee<br>
 E'en as choice is bidden,<br>
 Sharp steel's root and stem,<br>
 Choose song or silence;<br>
 See to each in thy heart,<br>
 All hurt has been heeded."<br>
 Then answered Sigurd--<br>
 "Ne'er shall I flee,<br>
 Though thou wottest me fey;<br>
 Never was I born for blenching,<br>
 Thy loved rede will I<br>
 Hold aright in my heart Even as long as I may live."</p></dir>
