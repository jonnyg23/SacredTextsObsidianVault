 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XXXI.</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">Of the Lamentation of Gudrun over Sigurd's dead, as it is told told in ancient Songs. [1]</h2><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Gudrun of old days<br>
 Drew near to dying<br>
 As she sat in sorrow<br>
 Over Sigurd;<br>
 Yet she sighed not<br>
 Nor smote hand on hand,<br>
 Nor wailed she aught<br>
 As other women.<br>
 Then went earls to her.<br>
 Full of all wisdom,<br>
 Fain help to deal<br>
 To her dreadful heart:<br>
 Hushed was Gudrun<br>
 Of wail, or greeting,<br>
 But with a heavy woe<br>
 Was her heart a-breaking.<br>
 Bright and fair<br>
 Sat the great earls' brides,<br>
 Gold arrayed<br>
 Before Gudrun;<br>
 Each told the tale<br>
 Of her great trouble,<br>
 The bitterest bale<br>
 She erst abode.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Giaflaug, Giuki's sister:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Lo upon earth<br>
 I live most loveless<br>
 Who of five mates<br>
 Must see the ending,<br>
 Of daughters twain<br>
 And three sisters,<br>
 Of brethren eight,<br>
 And abide behind lonely."<br>
 Naught gat Gudrun<br>
 Of wail and greeting,<br>
 So heavy was she<br>
 For her dead husband,<br>
 So dreadful-hearted<br>
 For the King laid dead there.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Herborg</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Queen of Hunland--<br>
 "Crueller tale<br>
 Have I to tell of,<br>
 Of my seven sons<br>
 Down in the Southlands,<br>
 And the eighth man, my mate,<br>
 Felled in the death-mead.<br>
 "Father and mother,<br>
 And four brothers,<br>
 On the wide sea<br>
 The winds and death played with;<br>
 The billows beat<br>
 On the bulwark boards.<br>
 "Alone must I sing o'er them,<br>
 Alone must I array them,<br>
 Alone must my hands deal with<br>
 Their departing;<br>
 And all this was<br>
 In one season's wearing,<br>
 And none was left<br>
 For love or solace.<br>
 "Then was I bound<br>
 A prey of the battle,<br>
 When that same season<br>
 Wore to its ending;<br>
 As a tiring may<br>
 Must I bind the shoon<br>
 Of the duke's high dame,<br>
 Every day at dawning.<br>
 "From her jealous hate<br>
 Gat I heavy mocking,<br>
 Cruel lashes<br>
 She laid upon me,<br>
 Never met I<br>
 Better master<br>
 Or mistress worser<br>
 In all the wide world."<br>
 Naught gat Gudrun<br>
 Of wail or greeting,<br>
 So heavy was she<br>
 For her dead husband,<br>
 So dreadful-hearted<br>
 For the King laid dead there.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Gullrond,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Giuki's daughter--<br>
 "O foster-mother,<br>
 Wise as thou mayst be,<br>
 Naught canst thou better<br>
 The young wife's bale."<br>
 And she bade uncover<br>
 The dead King's corpse.<br>
 She swept the sheet<br>
 Away from Sigurd,<br>
 And turned his cheek<br>
 Towards his wife's knees--<br>
 "Look on thy loved one<br>
 Lay lips to his lips,<br>
 E'en as thou wert clinging<br>
 To thy king alive yet!"<br>
 Once looked Gudrun--<br>
 One look only,<br>
 And saw her lord's locks<br>
 Lying all bloody,<br>
 The great man's eyes<br>
 Glazed and deadly,<br>
 And his heart's bulwark<br>
 Broken by sword-edge.<br>
 Back then sank Gudrun,<br>
 Back on the bolster,<br>
 Loosed was her head array,<br>
 Red did her cheeks grow,<br>
 And the rain-drops ran<br>
 Down over her knees.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then wept Gudrun,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Giuki's daughter,<br>
 So that the tears flowed<br>
 Through the pillow;<br>
 As the geese withal<br>
 That were in the homefield,<br>
 The fair fowls the may owned,<br>
 Fell a-screaming.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Gullrond,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Giuki's daughter--<br>
 "Surely knew I<br>
 No love like your love<br>
 Among all men,<br>
 On the mould abiding;<br>
 Naught wouldst thou joy in<br>
 Without or within doors,<br>
 O my sister,<br>
 Save beside Sigurd."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Gudrun,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Giuki's daughter--<br>
 "Such was my Sigurd<br>
 Among the sons of Giuki,<br>
 As is the king leek<br>
 O'er the low grass waxing,<br>
 Or a bright stone<br>
 Strung on band,<br>
 Or a pearl of price<br>
 On a prince's brow.<br>
 "Once was I counted<br>
 By the king's warriors<br>
 Higher than any<br>
 Of Herjan's mays;<br>
 Now am I as little<br>
 As the leaf may be,<br>
 Amid wind-swept wood<br>
 Now when dead he lieth.<br>
 I miss from my seat,<br>
 I miss from my bed,<br>
 My darling of sweet speech.<br>
 Wrought the sons of Giuki,<br>
 Wrought the sons of Giuki,<br>
 This sore sorrow,<br>
 Yea, for their sister,<br>
 Most sore sorrow.<br>
 "So may your lands<br>
 Lie waste on all sides,<br>
 As ye have broken<br>
 Your bounden oaths!<br>
 Ne'er shalt thou, Gunnar,<br>
 The gold have joy of;<br>
 The dear-bought rings<br>
 Shall drag thee to death,<br>
 Whereon thou swarest<br>
 Oath unto Sigurd.<br>
 Ah, in the days by-gone<br>
 Great mirth in the homefield<br>
 When my Sigurd<br>
 Set saddle on Grani,<br>
 And they went their ways<br>
 For the wooing of Brynhild!<br>
 An ill day, an ill woman,<br>
 And most ill hap!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Brynhild,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Budli's daughter--<br>
 "May the woman lack<br>
 Both love and children,<br>
 Who gained greeting<br>
 For thee, O Gudrun!<br>
 Who gave thee this morning<br>
 Many words!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Gullrond,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Giuki's daughter--<br>
 "Hold peace of such words<br>
 Thou hated of all folk!<br>
 The bane of brave men<br>
 Hast thou been ever,<br>
 All waves of ill<br>
 Wash over thy mind,<br>
 To seven great kings<br>
 Hast thou been a sore sorrow,<br>
 And the death of good will<br>
 To wives and women."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then spake Brynhild,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Budli's daughter--<br>
 "None but Atli<br>
 Brought bale upon us,<br>
 My very brother<br>
 Born of Budli.<br>
 When we saw in the hall<br>
 Of the Hunnish people<br>
 The gold a-gleaming<br>
 On the kingly Giukings;<br>
 I have paid for that faring<br>
 Oft and Full,<br>
 And for the sight<br>
 That then I saw."<br>
 By a pillar she stood<br>
 And strained its wood to her;<br>
 From the eyes of Brynhild,<br>
 Budli's daughter,<br>
 Flashed out fire,<br>
 And she snorted forth venom,<br>
 As the sore wounds she gazed on<br>
 Of the dead-slain Sigurd.</p></dir>
