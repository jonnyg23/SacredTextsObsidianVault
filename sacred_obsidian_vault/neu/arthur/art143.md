 <p align="left"> <br>                              I.</p>     
 <p align="left"> On the morn of sweet St. Martin<br>       Davie drew a hazel wand,<br>    And he singing came to Bala,<br>       With the hazel in his hand.<br>    <br>    What he sang, the cock-thrush echoed,<br>       Some wild rhyme of Merlin's doom,<br>    Or the sad refrain of Rhuddlan,<br>       Or the love of Hob and Twm.<br>    <br>    From the hill, he heard the harpers,<br>       And the hagglers, in the town,<br>    And his heart leapt up to hear them,<br>       As he sang, and hastened down.<br>                            </p>  
 <p align="left">                         II.<br>    <br>    What cobbled ancientry is this comes coughing thro' the fair,<br>                            Davie dear?<br>    Like one from out the grave arisen, the grave-mould in his hair?<br>    <br>    The shepherd boys cry 'Druan!' the Bala maids 'Beware!<br>                            Davie dear!'<br>    Yea sure, at sight of Davie's wand, he waits a while to stare.<br>    <br>    'If thou'll take me where thy hazel grew,--ah, this cough has made me old!'<br>                            Davie's told,--<br>    'I'll twine thy wand with silver, and bind thy belt with gold!'<br>    <br>    Can you bear to leave untasted all the fun of Bala Fair,<br>                            Davie dear?<br>    'Davie dear!' the maids keep calling. His wand leads otherwhere.<br>                            </p>  
 <p align="left">                         III.<br>    <br>    Far from Bala fair, the Lonnen<br>       Leans against the mountain side;<br>    Far above the Lonnen haystacks,<br>       Drops the brook the hazels hide.<br>    <br>    Davie leads, the grey-man follows,<br>       As grey-eve, St. Martin's morn;<br>    While across the Lonnen haystacks,<br>       Now the pale frost-fog is borne.<br>    <br>    Davie leads, the grey-man follows;<br>       And he coughs; but Davie sighs<br>    As they climb, and mark the night-fall;<br>       With no lantern but their eyes.<br>    <br>    By the torrent, mid the hazels,<br>       Hardly may the grey-man see,<br>    Groping, kneeling, there, a gravestone,<br>       Cast with Druid charactry.<br>    <br>    Ach, he coughs; his lean long fingers<br>       Strain upon it, til it stirs,<br>    But a cry from out the torrent,<br>       And the hazels Davie hears!</p>  
 <p align="left"> <br>                            IV.<br>    <br>    Deep as Merlin's grave, the stairway<br>       That descended, gloom on gloom,<br>    Into darkness that no window<br>       Ever yet let sun illume.<br>    <br>    Davie fears, but he must follow:<br>       Till the darkness soars and falls,--<br>    Arched and groined, and looped and lifted,<br>       Like St. David's twilit walls.<br>    <br>    And within, a trembling twilight<br>       Surely shewed a thousand men,<br>    All asleep, in shining helmets,<br>       Ah, to see them wake again.<br>    <br>    'They are mighty Arthur's warriors!'<br>       Said the grey-man; 'Till the day<br>    When the bell shall ring to wake them,<br>       They must sleep. Then wake for aye!<br>    <br>    'With his knights at the Round Table,--<br>       Owain, Kai, and Percival,--<br>    See,--the little star that crowns him,<br>       There sleeps Arthur, King of all.<br>    <br>    'But as Merlin said, not waking<br>       In our time, save yonder bell<br>    Ring,--and see the gold around them<br>       That is ours. Oh, Sirs, sleep well!'</p>  
 <p align="left"> <br>                            V.<br>    <br>    Davie's lips part, wide with wonder,<br>       At the warriors in their sleep,<br>    With such spears, and splendid helmets;<br>       'Ah,' he cries, 'to see them leap<br>    <br>    'Forth to life, and march to music,<br>       Flashing all their thousand spears;<br>    Ring, you bell, until King Arthur<br>       Rises, royal, when he hears!'<br>    <br>    Still the old man gropes and grumbles<br>       O'er his gold, as Davie's gone;<br>    Hark, ye mystic hall of warriors,<br>       Hark, the bell rings, night is done!<br>    <br>    At its stroke, the mountain trembled,<br>       And the thousand spears replied,<br>    Grounding on the mouldy pavement,<br>       As the men rose, side by side.<br>    <br>    Oh, the soldiers rise in radiance,<br>       All in motion, helm and spear!<br>    And King Arthur's crown, above them,<br>       Like a star shines steadfast there!<br>    <br>    But a voice cried,--'Sleep, King Arthur!<br>       Greed of gold, a boy at play,<br>    Wake thy destined sleep; far distant<br>       Still is the awakening day!'<br>    <br>    And King Arthur cried,--'Sleep, soldiers!<br>       Sleep, my spears!' They sank again<br>    Into silence. Round the table<br>       Arthur slept with all his men!<br>    <br>    But the old man hastened, stumbling,<br>       From his gold, and grumbling crept,<br>    And drew Davie up the stairway,<br>       Looking back at those who slept.<br>    <br>    Far below, the Lonnen windows,<br>       Sent one gleam forth lonelily,<br>    As alone stood Davie, asking,--<br>       'Old man, gold man, where is he?'<br>                            </p>  
 <p align="left">                         VI.<br>    <br>    Many a morn, up from the Lonnen,<br>       Davie led his sheep to seek<br>    For the door, but never found it,--<br>       Many a morn, week after week!<br>    <br>    Many an eve, too, Davie waited,<br>       Year by year, till he was grown<br>    Stalwart, and the Lonnen pastures,<br>       And the sheep there were his own.<br>    <br>    And when he was grey, he told it,<br>       In his sounding mountain tongue<br>    To his grandsons; and they told it<br>       To the harp when songs were sung.<br>    <br>    So my grandsire told the story<br>       O'er to me: and long I sought<br>    For King Arthur's Hall,--and seeking,<br>       Yet must wander, finding nought.<br>    <br>    Yet we wait the day of waking!<br>       But the grave its counsel keeps:<br>    Still within his Hall of Waiting,<br>       With his warriors Arthur sleeps.<br>  </p>
