Scriblerus Secundus;</i> <br>  <br>   HIS<br>  <br>  <b>  PREFACE</b> </center> <br> <br>  The Town hath seldom been more  divided in its Opinion, than concerning the Merit of the following Scenes. Whilst  some publickly affirmed, That no Author could produce so fine a Piece but Mr.  <i> P</i> ------, others have with as much Vehemence insistsed, That no one could  write any thing so bad, but Mr. <i> F</i> ------.<br>      Nor  can we wonder at this Dissention about its Merit, when the learned World have  not unanimously decided even the very Nature of this Tragedy. For tho' most of  the Universities in <i> Europe</i>  have honoured it with the Name of <i> Egregium  &amp; maximi pretii opus, Tragaediis tam antiquis quam novis longe anteponendum;</i>   nay, Dr. <i> B</i> ------ hath pronounced, <i> Citiùs Maevii AEneadem quam  Scribleri istius Tragaediam hanc crediderim, cujus Autorem Senecam ipsum tradidisse  haud dubitârim</i> ; and the great Professor <i> Burman</i> , hath stiled <i> Tom  Thumb, Heroum omnium Tragicorum facilè Principem</i> . Nay, tho' it hath,  among other Languages, been translated into <i> Dutch</i> , and celebrated with  great Applause at <i> Amsterdam</i>  (where Burlesque never came) by the Title of  <i> Mynheer Vander Thumb</i> , the Burgomasters receiving it with that reverent  and silent Attention, which becometh an Audience at a deep Tragedy: Notwithstanding  all this, there have not been wanting some who have represented these Scenes in  a ludicrous Light; and Mr. <i> D</i> ------ hath been heard to say, with some Concern,  That he wondered a Tragical and Christian Nation would permit a Representation  on its Theatre, so visibly designed to ridicule and extirpate every thing that  is Great and Solemn among us.<br>       This learned Critick,  and his Followers, were led into so great an Error, by that surreptitious and  piratical Copy which stole last Year into the World; with what Injustice and Prejudice  to our Author, I hope will be acknowledged by every one who shall happily peruse  this genuine and original Copy. Nor can I help remarking, to the great Praise  of our Author, that, however imperfect the former was, still did even that faint  Resemblance of the true <i> Tom Thumb</i> , contain sufficient Beauties to give  it a Run of upwards of Forty Nights, to the politest Audiences. But, nothwithstanding  that Applause which it receiv'd from all the best Judges, it was as severely censured  by some few bad ones, and I believe, rather maliciously than ignorantly, reported  to have been intended a Burlesque on the loftiest Parts of Tragedy, and designed  to banish what we generally call Fine Things, from the Stage.<br>       Now,  if I can set my Country right in an Affair of this Importance, I shall lightly  esteem any Labour which it may cost. And this I the rather undertake, First, as  it is indeed in some measure incumbent on me to vindicate myself from that surreptitious  Copy before-mentioned, published by some ill-meaning People, under my Name: Secondly,  as knowing my self more capable of doing Justice to our Author, than any other  Man, as I have given my self more Pains to arrive at a thorough Understanding  of this little Piece, having for ten Years together read nothing else; in which  time, I think I may modestly presume, with the help of my English Dictionary,  to comprehend all the Meanings of every Word in it.<br>      But  should any Error of my Pen awaken <i> Clariss. Bentleium</i>  to enlighten the World  with his Annotations on our Author, I shall not think that the least Reward or  Happiness arising to me from these my Endeavours.<br>      I  shall wave at present, what hath caused such Feuds in the learned World, Whether  this Piece was originally written by <i> Shakespear</i> , tho' certainly That, were  it true, must add a considerable Share to its Merit; especially, with such who  are so generous as to buy and to commend what they never read, from an implicit  Faith in the Author only: A Faith! which our Age abounds in as much, as it can  be called deficient in any other.<br>       Let it suffice,  that the <i> Tragedy of Tragedies</i> , or, <i> The Life and Death of Tom Thumb</i> ,  was written in the Reign of Queen <i> Elizabeth</i> . Nor can the Objection made  by Mr. <i> D</i> ------, That the Tragedy must then have been antecedent to the  History, have any Weight, when we consider, That tho' the <i> History of Tom Thumb</i> ,  printed by and for <i> Edward M------r</i> , at the Looking-Glass on <i> London-Bridge</i> ,  be of a later Date; still must we suppose this History to have been transcribed  from some other, unless we suppose the Writer thereof to be inspired: A Gift very  faintly contended for by the Writers of our Age. As to this History's not bearing  the Stamp of Second, Third, or Fourth Edition, I see but little in that Objection;  Editions being very uncertain Lights to judge of Books by: And perhaps Mr. <i> M------r</i>   may have joined twenty Editions in one, as Mr. <i> C------l</i>  hath ere now divided  one into twenty.<br>      Nor doth the other Argument, drawn  from the little Care our Author hath taken to keep up to the letter of the History,  carry any greater Force. Are there not Instances of Plays, wherein the History  is so perverted, that we can know the Heroes whom they celebrate by no other Marks  than their Names? Nay, do we not find the same Character placed by different Poets  in such different Lights, that we can discover not the least Sameness, or even  Likeness in the Features? The <i> Sophonisba</i>  of <i> Mairet</i> , and of <i> Lee</i> ,  is a tender, passionate, amorous Mistress of <i> Massinissa; Corneille</i> , and  Mr. <i> Thomson</i>  give her no other Passion but the Love of her Country, and  make her as cool in her Affection to <i> Massinissa</i> , as to <i> Syphax</i> . In  the two latter, she resembles the Character of Queen <i> Elizabeth</i> ; in the  two former she is the Picture of <i> Mary</i>  Queen of <i> Scotland</i> . In short,  the one <i> Sophonisba</i>  is as different from the other, as the <i> Brutus</i>   of <i> Voltaire</i> , is from the <i> Marius</i>  Jun. of <i> Otway</i> ; or as the  <i> Minerva</i>  is from the <i> Venus</i>  of the Ancients.<br>      Let  us now proceed to a regular Examinatoin of the Tragedy before us, in which I shall  treat separately of the Fable, the Moral, the Characters, the Sentiments, and  the Diction. And first of the<br>      <i> Fable</i> ; which  I take to be the most simple imaginable; and, to use the Words of an eminent Author,  'One, regular, and uniform, not 'charged with a Multiplicity of Incidents, and  yet affording several 'Revolutions of Fortune; by which the Passions may be excited,  'varied, and driven to their full Tumult of Emotion.' -- Nor is the <i> Action</i>   of this Tragedy less great than uniform. The Spring of all, is the Love of <i> Tom  Thumb</i>  for <i> Huncamunca</i> ; which causeth the Quarrel between their Majesties  in the first Act; the Passion of Lord <i> Grizzle</i>  in the Second; the Rebellion,  Fall of Lord <i> Grizzle</i> , and <i>  Glumdalca</i> , Devouring of <i> Tom Thumb</i>   by the Cow, and that bloody Catastrophe, in the Third.<br>      Nor  is the <i> Moral</i>  of this excellent Tragedy less noble than the <i> Fable</i> ;  it teaches these two instructive Lessons, <i> viz</i> . That Human Happiness is  exceeding transient, and, That Death is the certain End of all Men; the former  whereof is inculcated by the fatal End of <i> Tom Thumb</i> ; the latter, by that  of all the other Personages.<br>      The <i> Characters</i>   are, I think, sufficeintly described in the <i> Dramatis Personae</i> ; and I believe  we shall find few Plays, where greater care is taken to maintain them throughout,  and to preserve in every Speech that Characteristical Mark which distinguishes  them from each other. 'But (says Mr. <i> D</i> ------) how well doth the <i> Character</i>   of '<i> Tom Thumb</i> , whom we must call the Hero of this Tragedy, if it hath 'any  Hero, agree with the Precepts of <i> Aristotle</i> , who defineth <i> Tragedy 'to  be the Imitation of a short, but perfect Action, containing a just 'Greatness  in itself</i> , &amp;c. What Greatness can be in a Fellow, whom History 'relateth to  have been no higher than a Span?' This Gentleman seemeth to think, with Serjeant  <i> Kite</i> , that the Greatness of a Man's Soul is in proportion to that of his  Body, the contrary of which is affirmed by our <i> English</i>  Physognominical  Writers. Besides, if I understand <i> Aristotle</i>  right, he speaketh only of  the Greatness of the Action, and not of the Person.<br>      As  for the <i> Sentiments</i>  and the <i> Diction</i> , which now only remain to be  spoken to; I thought I could afford them no stronger Justification, than by producing  parallel Passages out of the best of our <i> English</i>  Writers. Whether this  Sameness of Thought and Expression which I have quoted from them, proceeded from  an Agreement in their Way of Thinking; or whether they have borrowed from our  Author, I leave the Reader to determine. I shall adventure to affirm this of the  Sentiments of our Author; That they are generally the most familiar which I have  ever met with, and at the same time delivered with the highest Dignity of Phrase;  which brings me to speak of his <i> Diction</i> . -- Here I shall only beg one Postulatum,  <i> viz</i> . That the greatest Perfection of the Language of a Tragedy is, that  it is not to be understood; which granted (as I think it must be) it will necessarily  follow, that the only ways to avoid this, is by being too high or too low for  the Understanding, which will comprehend every thing within its Reach. Those two extremities of Stile Mr. <i> Dryden</i>  illustrates by the familiar  Image of two Inns, which I shall term the Aerial and the Subterrestrial.<br>      <i> Horace</i>   goeth farther, and sheweth when it is proper to call at one of these Inns, and  when at the other; <br>      <i> Telephus &amp; Peleus, cùm  pauper &amp; exul uterque,<br>      Projicit Ampullas &amp; Sesquipedalia  Verba</i> .<br>  That he approveth of the <i> Sesquipedalia Verba</i> , is plain;  for had not <i> Telephus &amp; Peleus</i>  used this sort of Diction in Prosperity,  they could not have dropt it in Adversity. The Aerial Inn, therefore (says <i> Horace</i> )  is proper only to be frequented by Princes and other great Men, in the highest  Affluence of Fortune; the Subterrestrial is appointed for the Entertainment of  the poorer sort of People only, whom <i> Horace</i>  advises,<br> <br>      ----  <i> dolere Sermone pedestri</i> .<br> <br>  The true Meaning of both which Citations  is, That Bombast is the proper Language for Joy, and Doggrel for Grief, the latter  of which is literally imply'd in the <i> Sermo pedestris</i> , as the former is  in the <i> Sesquipedalia Verba</i> .<br>      <i> Cicero</i>  recommendeth  the former of these. <i> Quid est tam furiosum vel tragicum quàm verborum  sonitus inanis, nullâ subjectâ Sententiâ neque Scientiâ</i> . What can be so proper for Tragedy as a Set of big sounding Words, so contrived  together, as to convey no Meaning; which I shall one Day or other prove to be  the Sublime of <i> Longinus. Ovid</i>  declareth absolutely for the latter Inn:  <br>  <i> Omne genus scripti Gravitate Tragaedia vincit</i> .<br>  Tragedy hath of all  Writings the greatest Share in the <i> Bathos</i> , which is the Profound of <i> Scriblerus</i> .<br>       I shall not presume to determine which of these two Stiles  be properer for Tragedy. -- It sufficeth, that our Author excelleth in both. He is  very rarely within sight through the whole Play, either rising higher than the  Eye of your Understanding can soar, or sinking lower than it careth to stoop. But  here it may perhaps be observed, that I have given more frequent Instances of  Authors who have imitated him in the Sublime, than in the contrary. To which I  answer, First, Bombast being properly a Redundancy of Genius, Instances of Nature  occur in Poets whose Names do more Honour to our Author, than the Writers in the  Doggerel, which proceeds from a cool, calm, weighty Way of Thinking. Instances  whereof are most frequently to be found in Authors of a lower Class. Secondly,  That the Works of such Authors are difficultly found at all. Thirdly, That it  is a very hard Task to read them, in order to extrat these Flowers from them.  And Lastly, It is very often difficult to transplant them at all; they being like  some Flowers of a very nice Nature, which will flourish in no Soil but their own:  For it is easy to transcribe a Thought, but not the Want of one. The <i> Earl of  Essex</i> , for Instance, is a little Garden of choice Rarities, whence you can  scarce transplant one Line so as to perserve its original Beauty. This must account  to the Reader for his missing the Names of several of his Acquaintance, which  he had certainly found here, had I ever read their Works; for which, if I have  not a just Esteem, I can at least say with <i> Cicero, Quae non contemno, quippè  quae nunquam legerim</i> . However, that the Reader may meet with due Satisfaction  in this Point, I have a young Commentator from the University, who is reading  over all the modern Tragedies, at Five Shillings a Dozen, and collecting all that  they have stole from our Author, which shall shortly be added as an Appendix to  this Work.<br> <br> <br>   <br>  <center>   <b> DRAMATIS PERSONAE</b> <br> <br>   </center>  <table border="0" width="96%">    <tr>       <td width="84%">  KING <i> Arthur</i> , A passionate sort of King, Husband to        Queen <i> Dollallolla</i> , of whom he stands a little in Fear; Father to        <i>  Huncamunca</i> , whom he is very fond of; and in Love with <i> Glumdalca</i> .      </td>      <td width="16%">  <br>            Mr. <i> Mullart</i> .     </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%">  <br> TOM THUMB <i> the Great</i> , A little Hero with a great Soul,        something violent in his Temper, which is a little abated by his Love for        <i> Huncamunca</i> . </td>      <td width="16%"> <br>            Young <i> Verhuyck</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> GHOST of <i> Gaffar Thumb</i> , A whimsical sort        of GHOST.       <br>       </td>      <td width="16%"> <br>     Mr. <i> Lacy</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> Lord GRIZZLE, Extremely zealous for the Liberty of the Subject,        very cholerick in his Temper, and in Love with <i> Huncamunca</i> .</td>      <td width="16%">  <br>     Mr. <i> Jones</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> MERLIN, A Conjurer, and in some sort Father to <i> Tom Thumb</i> .      </td>      <td width="16%"> <br>     Mr. <i> Hallam</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> NOODLE, Courtiers in Place, and consequently of that Party        that is uppermost. <br>         <br> DOODLE, Courtiers in Place, and consequently of that Party that is uppermost.             </td>      <td width="16%"> <br>      Mr. <i> Reynolds</i> .<br>       <br>      Mr. <i> Wathan</i> . </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> FOODLE, A Courtier that is out of Place, and consequently        of that Party that is undermost. </td>      <td width="16%"> <br>     Mr. <i> Ayres</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> BAILIFF, and<br>        FOLLOWER, Of the Party of the Plaintiff. </td>      <td width="16%"> <br>     Mr. <i> Peterson</i> .<br>            Mr. <i> Hicks</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> PARSON, Of the Side of the Church.</td>      <td width="16%"> <br>      Mr. <i> Watson</i> .</td>    </tr>  </table>     <br>    <br>   <center>  WOMEN</center>  <br>  <table border="0" width="96%">    <tr>       <td width="84%">  QUEEN <i> Dollallolla</i> , Wife to King <i> Arthur</i> , and        Mother to <i> Huncamunca</i> , a Woman entirely faultless, saving that she        is a little given to Drink; a little too much a <i> Virago</i>  towards her        Husband, and in Love with <i> Tom Thumb</i> . </td>      <td width="16%"> <br>            Mrs. <i> Mullart</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> The Princess HUNCAMUNCA, Daughter to their Majesties King        <i> Arthur</i>  and Queen <i> Dollallolla</i> , of a very sweet, gentle, and amorous        Disposition, equally in Love with Lord <i> Grizzle</i>  and <i> Tom Thumb</i> ,        and desirous to be married to them both. </td>      <td width="16%"> <br> <br>     Mrs. <i> Jones</i> . </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> GLUMDALCA, of the Giants, a Captive Queen, belov'd by the        King, but in Love with <i> Tom Thumb</i> .</td>      <td width="16%"> <br>     Mrs. <i> Dove</i> .</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br> CLEORA, Maid of Honour, in Love with <i> Noodle</i> .<br>        <br> MUSTACHA, Maid of Honour, in Love with <i> Doodle</i> .</td>      <td width="16%"> </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="84%"> <br>  <i> Courtiers, Guards, Rebels, Drums, Trumpets, Thunder and        Lightning</i> .</td>      <td width="16%">   </td>    </tr>  </table>  <br>          SCENE  <i> the Court of King</i>  Arthur, <i> and a Plain thereabouts</i> .<br>  <br> <br> <br>  <center>ACT  I<br>  <br>  SCENE I<br>  <br>  SCENE, <i> The Palace</i> .<br>  DOODLE, NOODLE.</center>  <br>  DOODLE.

This the best of our Tragical Writers have understood to mean a Day remarkable for the Serenity of the Sky, or what we generally call a fine Summer's Day: So that according to this their Exposition, the same Months are proper for Tragedy, which are proper for Pastoral. Most of our celebrated <i> English</i>  Tragedies, as <i> Cato, Mariamne, Tamerlane</i> , &amp;c. begin with their Observations on the Morning. <i> Lee</i>  seems to have come the nearest to this beautiful Description of our Authors;<br>  <blockquote> <blockquote>  <i>  The Morning dawns with an unwonted Crimson,<br>  The Flowers all odorous seem, the Garden Birds<br>  Sing louder, and the</i>  laughing <i> Sun ascends,<br>  The gaudy Earth with an unusual brightness,<br>      All Nature smiles. </i>   (Caes. Borg.)   </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <i> Massinissa</i>  in the new <i> Sophonisba</i>  is also a Favourite of the Sun;<br>  <blockquote> <blockquote>  <i> -- The Sun too seems<br>  As conscious of my Joy with broader Eye<br>  To look abroad the World, and all things smile<br>  Like</i>  Sophonisba. </blockquote> </blockquote>  <i>  Memnon</i>  in the <i> Persian Princess</i> , makes the Sun decline rising, that he may not peep on Objects, which would prophane his Brightness.<br>  <blockquote> <blockquote>  --<i>  The Morning rises slow,<br>  And all those ruddy Streaks that us'd to paint<br>  The Days Approach, are lost in Clouds as if<br>  The Horrors of the Night had sent 'em back,<br>  To warn the Sun, he should not leave the Sea,<br>      To Peep</i> , &amp;c. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  
 <p> 2 This Line is highly conformable to the beautiful    Simplicity of the Antients. It hath been copied by almost every Modern,<br> <br>                 <i> Not    to be is not to be in Woe.</i>   (State    of Innocence.)<br> <br>                 <i> Love    is not Sin but where 'tis sinful Love.</i>   (Don    Sebastian.)<br> <br>                 <i> Nature    is Nature, </i> Laelius.  (Sophonisba.)<br> <br>                 <i> Men    are but Men, we did not make our selves.</i>   (Revenge.)<br> <br>    <br>    3 Dr. <i> B------y</i>  reads the mighty Tall-mast    Thumb. Mr. <i> D------s</i>  the mighty Thumping Thumb. Mr. T------d reads Thundering.    I think <i> Thomas</i>  more agreeable to the great Simplicity so apparent in    our Author.<br>    <br>    4 That learned Historian Mr. <i> S------n</i>  in the third    Number of his Criticism on our Author, takes great Pains to explode this Passage.    It is, says he, difficult to guess what Giants are here meant, unless the Giant    <i> Despair</i>  in the <i> Pilgrim's Progress</i> , or the Giant <i> Greatness</i>  in the    <i> Royal Villain</i> ; for I have heard of no other sort of Giants in the Reign    of King <i> Arthur. Petrus Burmanus</i>  makes three <i> Tom Thumbs</i> , one whereof    he supposes to have been the same Person whom the <i> Greeks</i>  called <i> Hercules</i> ,    and that by these Giants are to be understood the <i> Centaurs</i>  slain by that    Heroe. Another <i> Tom Thumb</i>  he contends to have been no other than the <i> Hermes    Trismegistus</i>  of the Antients. The third <i> Tom Thumb</i>  he places under    the Reign of King <i> Arthur</i> , to which third <i> Tom Thumb</i> , says he, the    Actions of the other two were attributed. Now tho' I know that this Opinion    is supported by an Assertion of <i> Justus Lipsius, Thomam illum Thumbum non    alium quam Herculem fuisse satis constat</i> ; yet shall I venture to oppose    one Line of Mr. <i> Midwinter</i> , against them all,<br>    <br>                 <i> In</i>  Arthur's    <i> Court</i>  Tom Thumb <i> did live</i> .<br>    <br>    But then, says Dr. <i> B------y</i> , if we place <i> Tom Thumb</i>  in the Court    of King <i> Arthur</i> , it will be proper to place that Court out of <i> Britain</i> ,    where no Giants were ever heard of. <i> Spencer</i> , in his <i> Fairy Queen</i> ,    is of another Opinion, where describing <i> Albion</i>  he says,<br>    <br>                 <i> --    Far within a salvage Nation dwelt<br>                 Of    hideous Giants</i> .<br>    <br>    And in the same Canto,<br>    <br>                 <i>     Then</i>  Elfar, <i> who two Brethren Giants had,<br>                 The    one of which had two Heads --<br>                        The other three</i> .<br>    <br>    Risum teneatis, Amici.<br>    <br>    5 To whisper in Books says Mr. <i> D------s</i>  is    errant Nonsense. I am afraid this learned Man does not sufficiently understand    the extensive meaning of the Word Whisper. If he had rightly understood what    is meant by the <i> Senses Whisp'ring the Soul</i>  in the <i> Persian Princess</i> ,    or what <i> Whisp'ring like Winds</i>  is in <i> Aurengzebe</i> , or like Thunder    in another Author, he would have understood this. <i> Emmeline</i>  in <i> Dryden</i>     sees a Voice, but she was born blind, which is an Excuse <i> Panthea</i>  cannot plead    in <i> Cyrus</i> , who hears a sight.<br>    <br>                 <i> --    Your Description will surpass,<br>                 All    Fiction, Painting, or dumb Shew of Horror,<br>                 That    ever Ears yet heard, or Eyes beheld</i> .<br>    <br>    When Mr. <i> D------s</i>  understands these he will understand Whisp'ring in    Books.<br>    <br>    6               -- <i> Some Ruffian stept into his Father's Place</i> ,<br>                 And    more than half begot him.  (<i> Mary Q. of Scots</i> ).<br>    <br>    7               -- <i> For</i>  Ulamar <i> seems</i>  sent Express from Heaven,<br>                 <i> To    civilize this rugged</i>  Indian <i> Clime</i> .  (Liberty Asserted.)<br>    <br>    8 <i> Omne majus continet in se minus, sed minus non    in se majus continere potest</i> , says <i> Scaliger</i>  in <i> Thumbo</i> . - I    suppose he would have cavilled at these beautiful Lines in the Earl of <i> Essex</i> ;<br>    <br>                 <i> --    Thy most inveterate Soul,<br>                 That    looks through the foul Prison of thy Body</i> .<br> <br>                 And    at those of <i> Dryden,<br> <br>                 The    Palace is without too well design'd,<br>                 Conduct me in, for I will view thy Mind.  </i> (Aurengzebe.)<br>    <br>    9 Mr. <i> Banks</i>  hath copied this almost Verbatim,<br>    <br>                 <i> It    was enough to say, here's</i>  Essex <i> come,<br>                 And    Nurses still'd their Children with the fright.  </i> (E. of <i> Essex</i> .)<br>    <br>    10 The Trumpet in a Tragedy is generally as much    as to say enter King: Which makes Mr. <i> Banks</i>  in one of his Plays call    it the Trumpets's formal Sound.<br>    <br>    11 <i> Phraortes</i>  in the <i> Captives</i>  seems    to have been acquainted with King <i> Arthur</i> .<br>    <br>                 <i> Proclaim    a Festival for seven Days space,<br>                 Let    the Court shine in all its Pomp and Lustre,<br>                 Let    all our Streets resound with Shouts of Joy;<br>                 Let    Musick's Care-dispelling Voice be heard,<br>                 The    sumptuous Banquet, and the flowing Goblet<br>                 Shall    warm the Cheek, and fill the Heart with Gladness.<br>                 Astarbe    shall sit Mistress of the Feast</i> .<br>    <br>    12         <i> Repentance</i>  frowns    on <i> thy contracted Brow</i> .  (Sophonisba.)<br> <br>                 <i> Hung    on his clouded Brow, I mark'd Despair</i> .  (Ibid.)<br> <br>    <i>                 <i> </i> -- A sullen Gloom,</i> <br>    <i>                 <i> </i> Scowls on his Brow</i> .  (Busiris.)<br>    <br>    13 <i> Plato</i>  is of this Opinion, and so is Mr.    <i> Banks</i> ;<br> <br>                 <i> Behold    these Tears sprung from fresh Pain and Joy</i> .  (E. of <i> Essex</i> .)<br>    <br>    14 These Floods are very frequent in the Tragick    Authors.<br> <br>                 <i> Near    to some murmuring Brook I'll lay me down,<br>                 Whose    Waters if they should too shallow flow,<br>                 My    Tears shall swell them up till I will drown</i> .  (Lee's    Sophonisba.)<br>    <br>                 <i> Pouring    forth Tears at such a lavish Rate,<br>                 <i> </i> That    were the World on Fire, they might have drown'd<br>                 <i> </i> The    Wrath of Heav'n, and quench'd the mighty Ruin</i> .  (Mithridates.)<br>    <br>       One Author changes the Waters of Grief to those of Joy,</p>

 <p>               <i> --    Each Star withdraws<br>                 His    golden Head and burns within the Socket.</i>   (Nero.)<br> <br>                <i> A    Soul grown old and sunk into the Socket</i> .  (Sebastian.)<br>    <br>    21 This Simile occurs very frequently among the    Dramatick Writers of both Kinds.<br>    <br>    22 Mr. Lee hath stolen this Thought from our Author;</p>

The Gods and Heroes in <i> Homer</i>  and    <i> Virgil</i>  are continually described higher by the Head than their Followers,    the contrary of which is observ'd by our Author: In short, to exceed on either    side is equally admirable, and a Man of three Foot is as wonderful a sight as    a Man of nine.<br>    <br>    25     <i>  <i> </i>  <i> </i>  <i> </i>  <i> </i> My    Blood leaks fast, and the great heavy lading<br>                 My    Soul will quickly sink.</i>   (Mithrid.)<br> <br>                 <i> My    Soul is like a Ship</i> .  (Injur'd Love.)<br>    <br>    26 This well-bred Line seems to be copied in the    <i> Persian Princess</i> ;</p>

He who understood the Passions    better, and that so violent an Affection as this must be too big for Utterance,    chooses rather to send his Characters off in this sullen and doleful manner:    In which admirable Conduct he is imitated by the Author of the justly celebrated    <i> Eurydice</i> .

Mr. <i> Banks</i>     makes one Soul to be so expanded that Heaven could not contain it;<br>    <br>                 <i> The    Heavens are all too narrow for her Soul</i> .  (Virtue Betray'd.)<br>    <br>    The <i> Persian Princess</i>  hath a Passage not unlike the Author of this;<br>    <br>                 <i> We    will send such Shoals of murther'd Slaves,<br>                 Shall    glut Hell's empty Regions</i> .<br>    <br>    This threatens to fill Hell even tho' it were empty; Lord <i> Grizzle</i>  only    to fill up the Chinks, supposing the rest already full.<br>    <br>    97 Mr. <i> Addisoin</i>  is generally thought to    have had this Simile in his Eye, when he wrote that beautiful one at the end    of the third Act of his <i> Cato</i> .<br>    <br>    98 This beautiful simile is founded on a Proverb,    which does Honour to the <i> English</i>  Language;<br>    <br>                 <i> Between    two Stools the Breech falls to the Ground.</i> <br>    <br>    I am not so pleased with any written Remains of the Ancients, as with those    little Aphorisms, which verbal Tradition hath delivered down to us, under the    Title of Proverbs. It were to be wished that instead of filling their Pages    with the fabulous Theology of the Pagans, our modern Poets would think it worth    their while to enrich their Works with the Proverbial Sayings of their Ancestors.    Mr. <i> Dryden</i>  hath chronicl'd one in Heroick;<br>    <br>                 <i> Two    ifs scarce make one Possibility</i> .  (Conquest of Granada.)<br>    <br>    My Lord <i> Bacon</i>  is of Opinion, that whatever is known of Arts and Sciences    might be proved to have lurked in the Proverbs of <i> Solomon</i> . I am of the    same Opinion in relation to those abovemention'd: At least I am confident that    a more perfect System of Ethicks, as well as Oeconomy, might be compiled out    of them, than is at present extant, either in the Works of the Antient Philosophers,    or those more valuable, as more voluminous, ones of the modern Divines.<br>    <br>    99 Of all the Particulars in which the modern Stage    falls short of the ancient, there is none so much to be lamented, as the great    Scarcity of Ghosts in the latter. Whence this proceeds, I will not presume to    determine. Some are of opinion, that the Moderns are unequal to that sublime    Language which a Ghost ought to speak. One says ludicrously, That Ghosts are    out of Fashion; another, That they are properer for Comedy; forgetting, I suppose,    that <i> Aristotle</i>  hath told us, That a Ghost is the Soul of Tragedy; for    so I render the  which M. <i> Dacier</i> ,    amongst others, hath mistaken; I suppose mis-led, by not understanding the <i> Fabula</i>     of the <i> Latins</i> , which signifies a <i> Ghost</i>  as well as a <i> Fable</i> .    <br>    <br>                 <i> --    Te premet nox, fabulaeque Manes</i>   (Hor.)<br>    <br>    Of all the Ghosts that have ever appeared on the Stage, a very learned and judicious    foreign Critick, gives the Preference to this of our Author. These are his Words,    speaking of this Tragedy;<br>    <br>    <i> -- Nec quidquam in illâ admirabilius quam Phasma quoddam horrendum,    quod omnibus aliis Spectris, quibuscum scatet Anglorum Tragaedia, longè    (pace D ------ isii V.

Thou canst no Conquest boast,<br>                 I thought    what was the Courage of a Ghost</i> .  (Conquest of Granada.)<br>    <br>    King <i> Arthur</i>  seems to be as brave a Fellow as <i> Almanzor</i> , who says    most heroically,<br>    <br>                 <i> --    In spight of Ghosts, I'll on.</i> <br>    <br>    105 The Ghost of <i> Lausaria</i>  in <i> Cyrus</i>     is a plain Copy of this, and is therefore worth reading.<br>    <br>                 <i> Ah</i> ,    Cyrus!<br>                 <i> Thou    may'st as well grasp Water, or fleet Air,<br>                 As    think of touching my immortal Shade.</i>   (Cyrus the Great.)<br>    <br>    106  <i> Thou better Part of heavenly Air.</i>   (Conquest    of Granada.)<br>    <br>    107 <i> A String of Similies</i>  (says one) <i> proper    to be hung up in the Cabinet of a Prince</i> .<br>    <br>    108 This Passage hath been understood several    different Ways by the Commentators. For my part, I find it difficult to understand    it at all. Mr. <i> Dryden</i>  says,<br>    <br>                 <i> I    have heard something how two Bodies meet,<br>                 But    how two Souls join, I know not.</i> <br>    <br>    So that 'till the Body of a Spirit be better understood, it will be difficult    to understand how it is possible to run him through it.<br>    <br>    109 <i> Cydaria</i>  is of the same fearful Temper    with <i> Dollallolla</i> ;<br>    <br>                 <i> I    never durst in Darkness be alone.</i>   (Ind. Emp.)<br>    <br>    110       <i> Think well of this,    think that, think every way.</i>   (Sophonisba.)<br>    <br>    111 These Quotations are more usual in the Comick,    than in the Tragick Writers.<br>    <br>    112 <i> This Distress</i>  (says Mr. <i> D------</i> )    <i> I must allow to be extremely beautiful, and tends to heighten the virtuous    Character of </i> Dollallolla, <i> who is so exceeding delicate, that she is in    the highest Apprehension from the inanimate Embrace of a Bolster. An Example    worthy of Imitation from all our Writers of Tragedy</i> .<br>    <br>    113 <i> Credat Judaeus Apelles.<br>    Non ego</i>  -- (Says Mr. <i> D.</i> ) -- <i> For, passing over the Absurdity of    being equal to Odds, can we possibly suppose a little insignificant Fellow -    I say again, a little insignificant Fellow able to vie with a Strength which    all the </i> Sampsons<i>  and </i> Hercules's <i> of Antiquity would be unable to    encounter.</i> <br>    <br>    I shall refer this incredulous Critick to Mr. <i> Dryden's</i>  Defence of his    <i> Almanzor</i> ; and lest that should not satisfy him, I shall quote a few Lines    from the Speech of a much braver Fellow than <i> Almanzor</i> , Mr. <i> Johnson's    Achilles;<br>    <br>                 Tho'    </i> Human Race rise in embattel'd Hosts,<br>                 <i> To    force her from my Arms -- Oh!

I believe    he never heard of Sailing with Wings, which he may read in no less a Poet than    Mr. <i> Dryden</i> ;<br>    <br>                 <i> Unless    we borrow Wings, and sail thro' Air.</i>   (Love Triumphant.)<br>    <br>    What will he say to a kneeling Valley?<br>    <br>                 <i> --    I'll stand<br>                 Like    a safe Valley, that low bends the Knee,<br>                 To    some aspiring Mountain.</i>   (Injur'd Love.)<br>    <br>    I am asham'd of so ignorant a Carper, who doth not know that an Epithet in Tragedy    is very often no other than an Expletive. Do not we read in the New <i> Sophonisba</i>     of <i> grinding Chains, blue Plagues, white Occasions</i> , and <i> blue Serenity</i> ?    Nay, 'tis not the Adjective only, but sometimes half a Sentence is put by way    of Expletive, as, <i> Beauty pointed high with Spirit</i> , in the same Play --    and, <i> In the Lap of Blessing, to be most curst</i> , in the Revenge.<br>    <br>    115   <i>   </i> <i>   </i> A    Victory like that of <i> Almanzor</i> .<br>                 Almanzor    <i> is victorious without Fight</i> .  (Conq. of Granada.)<br>    <br>    116   <i>     Well    have we chose an happy Day for Fight,<br>                 For    every Man in course of Time has found,<br>                 Some    Days are lucky, some unfortunate</i> .  (K. Arthur.)<br>    <br>    117 We read of such another in <i> Lee;<br>    <br>                 Teach    his rude Wit a Flight she never made,<br>                 And    sent her Post to the </i> Elysian<i>  Shade.</i>   (Gloriana.)<br>    <br>    118 These Lines are copied <i> Verbatim</i>  in    the <i> Indian Emperor</i> .<br>    <br>    119   <i>   </i> <i>   </i> <i> Unborn    Thunder rolling in a Cloud.</i>   (Conq. of Gran.)<br>    <br>    120   <i>     Were    Heaven and Earth in wild Confusion hurl'd,<br>                 Should    the rash Gods unhinge the rolling World,<br>                 Undaunted,    would I tread the tott'ring Ball,<br>                 Crush'd,    but unconquer'd, in the dreadful Fall.</i>   (Female Warrior.)<br>    <br>    121 See the History of <i> Tom Thumb</i> , pag.    2.<br>    <br>    122   <i>   </i> <i>   </i> <i> --    Amazement swallows up my Sense,<br>                 And    in th' impetuous Whirl of circling Fate,<br>                 Drinks    down my Reason.  (Pers.</i>  Princess.)<br>    <br>    123  <i>   </i> <i>   </i>  <i> --    I have outfaced my self,<br>                 What!    am I two? Is there another Me?</i>   (K. Arthur.)<br>    <br>    124 The Character of <i> Merlin</i>  is wonderful    throughout, but most so in this Prophetick Part. We find several of these Prophecies    in the Tragick Authors, who frequently take this Opportunity to pay a Compliment    to their Country, and sometimes to their Prince. None but our Author (who seems    to have detested the least Appearance of Flattery) would have past by such an    Opportunity of being a Political Prophet.<br>    <br>    125   <i> I saw the Villain, </i> Myron,    <i> with these Eyes I saw him</i> .  (Busiris.)<br>    <br>    In both which Places it is intimated, that it is sometimes possible to see with    other Eyes than your own.<br>    <br>    126 <i> This Mustard</i>  (says Mr. <i> D.</i> )    <i> is enough to turn one's Stomach: I would be glad to know what Idea the Author    had in his Head when he wrote it</i> . This will be, I believe, best explained    by a Line of Mr. <i> Dennis</i> ;<br>    <br>                 <i> And    gave him Liberty, the Salt of Life</i> .  (Liberty asserted.)<br>    <br>    The Understanding that can digest the one, will not rise at the other.<br>    <br>    127       Han.    <i> Are you the Chief, whom Men fam'd</i>  Scipio <i> call?</i> <br>                 Scip.    <i> Are you the much more famous </i> Hannibal?  (Hannib.)<br>    <br>    128 Dr. <i> Young</i>  seems to have copied this    Engagement in his <i> Busiris</i> :<br>    <br>                 Myr.    <i> Villain!</i> <br>                 Mem.

Mandane<br>    <br>    129 This last Speech of my Lord <i> Grizzle</i> ,    hath been of great Service to our Poets;<br>    <br>                 <i> --    I'll hold it fast<br>                 As    Life, and when Life's gone, I'll hold this last;<br>                 And    if thou tak'st it from me when I'm slain,<br>                 I'll    send my Ghost, and fetch it back again</i> .  (Conquest of Granada.)<br>    <br>    130   <i>     My    Soul should with such Speed obey,<br>                 It    should not bait at Heaven to stop its way</i> .<br>    <br>    <i> Lee</i>  seems to have had this last in his Eye;<br>    <br>                 <i> 'Twas    not my Purpose, Sir, to tarry there,<br>                 I would    but go to Heaven to take the Air</i> .  (Gloriana.)<br>    <br>    131   <i>     A    rising </i> Vapour rumbling <i> in my Brains</i> .  (Cleomenes.)<br>    <br>    132   <i>   </i> <i>   </i> <i> Some    kind Spright knocks softly at my Soul,<br>                 To    tell me Fate's at Hand</i> .<br>    <br>    133 Mr. <i> Dryden</i>  seems to have had this    Simile in his Eye, when he says,<br>    <br>                 <i> My    Soul is </i> packing up, <i> and just on Wing</i> .  (Conquest of Granada.)<br>    <br>    134   <i>   </i> <i>   </i> <i> And    in a purple Vomit pour'd his Soul.</i>   (Cleomenes.)<br>    <br>    135   <i>     The    Devil swallows vulgar Souls<br>                 Like    whipp'd Cream</i> .  (Sebastian.)<br>    <br>    136   <i>     How    I could curse my Name of </i> Ptolemy!<br>                 <i> It    is so long, it asks an Hour to write it.<br>                 By    Heav'n! I'll change it into </i> Jove, <i> or </i> Mars,<br>                 <i> Or    any other civil Monosyllable,<br>                 That    will not tire my Hand</i> .  (Cleomenes.)<br>    <br>    137 Here is a visible Conjunction of two Days    in one, by which our Author may have either intended an Emblem of a Wedding;    or to insinuate, that Men in the Honey-Moon are apt to imagine time shorter    than it is. It brings into my Mind a Passage in the Comedy call'd the <i> Coffee-House    Politician</i> ;<br>    <br>                 <i> We    will celebrate this Day at my House To-morrow</i> .<br>    <br>    138 These beautiful Phrases are all to be found    in one single Speech of <i> King Arthur</i> , or <i> The British Worthy</i> .<br>    <br>    139   <i>   </i> <i>   </i> <i> I    was but teaching him to grace his Tale<br>                 With    decent Horror</i> .  (Cleomenes.)<br>    <br>    140 We may say with <i> Dryden,<br>    <br>                 Death    did at length so many Slain forget,<br>                 And    left the Tale, and took them by the Great</i> .<br>    <br>    I know of no Tragedy which comes nearer to this charming and bloody Catastrophe,    than <i> Cleomenes</i> , where the Curtain covers five principal Characters dead    on the Stage. These Lines too,<br>    <br>                 <i> I    ask no Questions then, of Who kill'd Who?<br>                 The    Bodies tell the Story as they lie.</i> <br>    <br>    seem to have belonged more properly to this Scene of our Author. -- Nor can    I help imagining they were originally his. The Rival Ladies too seem beholden    to this Scene;<br>    <br>                 <i> We're    now a Chain of Lovers link'd in Death,<br>                 </i> Julia    <i> goes first</i> , Gonsalvo <i> hangs on her,<br>                 And    </i> Angelina <i> hangs upon </i> Gonsalvo,<br>                 <i> As    I on </i> Angelina.<br>    <br>    No Scene, I believe, ever received greater Honours than this. It was applauded    by several <i> Encores</i> , a Word very unusual in Tragedy -- And it was very    difficult for the Actors to escape without a second Slaughter. This I take to    be a lively Assurance of that fierce Spirit of Liberty which remains among us,    and which Mr. <i> Dryden</i>  in his <i> Essay</i>  on <i> Dramatick Poetry</i>  hath    observed -- <i> Whether Custom</i>  (says he) <i> hath so insinuated it self into    our Countrymen, or Nature hath so formed them to Fierceness, I know not, but    they will scarcely suffer Combats, and other Objects of Horror, to be taken    from them</i> . -- And indeed I am for having them encouraged in this Martial    Disposition: Nor do I believe our Victories over the <i> French</i>  have been    owing to any thing more than to those bloody Spectacles daily exhibited in our    Tragedies, of which the <i> French</i>  Stage is so entirely clear. <br>    <br>
