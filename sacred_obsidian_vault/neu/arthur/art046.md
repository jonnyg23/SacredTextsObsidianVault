As for the rest--<br>    Well you know how <i> they</i>  were set,<br>    Saying that I must forget<br> And 'twas for the best.<br> <br> <i> I</i>  forget?--But let it go!--<br>    Kiss me as you used of old.<br>    There;  your kisses are not cold!<br> Can you love me so?<br> <br> Knowing what I am to him,<br>    To that gouty gray one there,<br>    On the wide verandah, where<br> Fitful fireflies swim.<br> <br> Is it tears?  Or what?  that wets<br>    Eyes and cheeks;--on brow and lip<br>    Kisses!  Soft as bees that sip<br> Sweets from violets.<br> <br> See!  the moon has risen;  white<br>    As this open lily here,<br>    Rocking on the dusty mere,<br> Like a silent light.<br> <br> Let us walk...So soon to part!--<br>    All too soon!  But he may miss.<br>    Give me but another kiss--<br> It will heat my heart<br> <br> And the bitter winter there.--<br>    So;  we part, my Launcelot,<br>    My true knight!  And am I not<br> Your true Guinevere?<br> <br> Oft they parted thus, they tell,<br>    In that mystical romance...<br>    Were they placed, think you, perchance,<br> For such love, in Hell?<br> <br> No!  It can not, can not be!<br>    Love is God, and God is love:<br>    And they live and love above,<br> Guinevere and he.<br> <br> I must go now.--See! there fell,<br>    Molten into purple light,<br>    One wild star.  Kiss me good night,<br> And once more.  Farewell.<br>
