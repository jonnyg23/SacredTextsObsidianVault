It is weary without her.<br>  I would that I were as the winds which play about her!<br>  For here I waste and I sicken, and nought is fair<br>  To mine eyes: nor night with stars in her clouded hair,<br>  Nor all the whitening ways of the stormy seas,<br>  Nor the leafy twilight trembling under the trees:<br>  But mine hands crave for her touch, mine eyes for her sight,<br>  My mouth for her mouth, mine eyes for her foot-falls light,<br>  And my soul would drink of her soul through every sense,<br>  Thirsting for her, as earth, in the heat intense,<br>  For the soft song and the gentle dropping of rain.<br>  But I sit here as a smouldering fire of pain,<br>  Lonely, here!  And the wind in the forest grieves,<br>  And I hear my sorrow sobbing among the leaves.<br>
