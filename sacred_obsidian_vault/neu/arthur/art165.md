This long while<br> Hath Mark grown older with his hate of me,<br> And now his hand for lust to smite at us<br> Plucks the white hairs inside his beard that he<br> This year made thicker.  Seeing this he does<br> I pray you note that we may meet with him<br> At riding through the branches growth, and then<br> Our wine grow bitter at the golden rim<br> And taste of blood and tears, not sweet to drink<br> As this new honey wherein juices swim<br> Of fair red vintage."<br>                      Her voice done, I think<br> He had no heart to answer; yet some time<br> The noon outside them seem to throb and sink,<br> Wrought in the quiet to a rounded rhyme.<br> Then "certes," said he, "this were harm to both<br> If spears grew thick between the beech and lime,<br> Or amid reeds that let the river south,<br> Yet so I think you might get help of me.<br> Had I not heart to smile, when Iseult's mouth<br> Kissed Palomydes under a thick tree?<br> For I remember, as the wind sets low,<br> How all that peril ended quietly<br> In a green place where heavy sunflowers blow."<br>
