He importuneth none with his song, be it never so wild and sweet.<br> She that hath ears to hear, let her hear; he will not follow her feet. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Merlyn makes no petition. He asketh of no man alms.<br>    Prince and prophet is he, a monarch, a giver of gifts, a lord of the open palms,<br>  Sueth he naught, not at God's own hand, though he laudeth the Lord in psalms.  <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Merlyn would speak his message only to hearts that are strong,<br>    To him that hath courage to climb, who would gather time's samphire flowers, who would venture the crags among.<br> To her who would lesson her soul to fear, with love for sermon and song. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Merlyn hath arms of pity, the weak he would hold to his soul,<br>    Make them partakers of truth, of the ancient weal of the Earth, of the life-throb from Pole to Pole.<br>  He would hold them close; he would dry their tears; with a kiss he would make  them whole. <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Thus would he sing and to thee, thou child with the eyes of passion<br>     Watching his face in the dark, in the silent light of the stars,  while he in his godlike fashion<br>  Maketh his mock at the fears of men, nor spareth to lay the lash on. <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Thus would thy Merlyn devise, ere the days of his years be numbered,<br>    Now at threescore and ten. He would leave his word to the world, his soul of its load uncumbered.<br> Then would he lay his ear to the grave, and sleep as his childhood slumbered. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> What is the fruit of Wisdom? To learn the proportion of things;<br>    To know the ant from the lion, the whale from the crest of the wave, the ditty the grasshopper sings<br> From the chaunt of the full-fledged Paradise bird as he shakes the dew from his wings. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> There is one thing more than knowledge, a harvest garnered by few:<br>    To tutor the heart to achieve, to fashion the act to the hand, to do and not yearn to do,<br> To say to the wish of the soul "I will," to have gathered the flower where it grew. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> I was young, and they told me "Tarry. The rash in the nets are taken.<br>    If there be doubt of thy deed, abstain, lest the day of danger behold thee by these forsaken,<br> Lest thou lie in the lion's den thou hast roused, with the eyes thou hast dared to waken. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  T hey spake, but I answered "Nay, who waiteth shall take no quarry.<br>     Pleasure is fleet as the roe; in the vales he feedeth to-day, but at night when the eyes grow weary<br> Lo, he hath passed to the desolate hills; he is gone. Nay, <i> he</i>  may not tarry." <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> For Joy too needeth a net. He cometh tame to thy hand,<br>    Asketh an alms of thy life, to serve thee, thy jubilant slave, if thou wouldst but understand.<br> Then is thy moment, O Man, for the noose, be it steel or a silken band. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Therefore, where doubt is, do! Thou shalt stumble in thine endeavour<br>    Ay, till thy knees be sore, thy back with the arrows of grief, and thou stand with an empty quiver.<br> Yet shall thy heart prevail through its pain, for pain is a mastering lever. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Wouldst thou be wise, O Man? At the knees of a woman begin.<br>     Her eyes shall teach thee thy road, the worth of the thing called  pleasure, the joy of the thing called sin.<br>  Else shalt thou go to thy grave in pain for the folly that might have been. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> For know, the knowledge of women the beginning of wisdom is.<br>    Who had seven hundred wives and concubines hundreds three, as we read in the book of bliss?<br> Solomon, wisest of men and kings, and "all of them princesses." <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Yet, be thou stronger than they. To be ruled of a woman is ill.<br>    Life hath an hundred ways, beside the way of her arms, to give thee of joy thy fill.<br> Only is love of thy life the flower. Be thine the ultimate will. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> A right way is to be happy, a wrong way too. Then beware.<br>    Leave the colt in his stall, he shall grow to a thankless jade, be he never so fat and fair.<br> Sloth is a crime. Rise up, young fool, and grasp thy joy by the hair. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> What is the motto of youth? There is only one. Be thou strong.<br>    Do thy work and achieve, with thy brain, with thy hands, with thy heart, the deeds which to strength belong.<br> Strike each day thy blow for the right, or failing strike for the wrong. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> He that would gain let him give. The shut hand hardly shall win.<br>     Open thy palms to the poor, O thou of the indigent heart. There  shall pleasure be poured therein.<br>  Use thy soul to the cord of joy. If thou sin must, strongly sin. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Cast thy whole heart away. The Earth, philosophers tell,<br>    Leaps to a pebble thrown, be it never so little; it moved to the bidding of that which fell.<br>  Throw thy heart! Thou shalt move the world, though thou fall on the floor of Hell.  <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Few have the courage of loving. Faint hearts! The loss is theirs.<br>     Few of their idlest whims. "I would win to Rome ere I die,"  one cried in his daily cares,<br>  Yet plods on on 'Change to his grave, the slave of his stocks and shares. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Learn to appraise thy desires, to weigh the wares of thy heart.<br>    If thou wouldst play with pleasure, avoid Love's passionate tides, its perilous Ocean chart,<br> Hug the shores of Love's inland seas, and buy thy joys in the mart. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Love lightly, but marry at leisure. Wild Love is a flower of the field<br>    Waiting all hands to gather and ours. If we leave it another will win it and kneel where we kneeled.<br> Marriage is one tame garden rose in a garden fenced and sealed. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> O thou who art sitting silent! Youth, with the eyelids of grief!<br>    How shall I rouse thee to wit? Thou hast stolen the joy of our world. Thou scornest its vain relief.<br> Nay, she is here. Be thy tongue set free. Play up, thou eloquent thief. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Doubt not thy absolution, sinner, who darest to sin.<br>    So thou prevail in the end, she shall hold thee guiltless of guile, a hero, a paladin.<br> The end in her eyes hath thee justified, whatever thy means have been. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Love is of body and body, the physical passion of joy;<br>    The desire of the man for the maid, her nakedness strained to his own; the mother's who suckles her boy<br> With the passionate flow of her naked breast.  All else is a fraudulent toy. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Of the house where Love is the master thy beauty may hold the key.<br>    It shall open the hall-door wide, shout loud thy name to its lord. Yet, wouldst thou its full guest be,<br> Bring with thee other than beauty, wit. Then sit at the feast made free. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> "To talk of love is to make love." Truly, a maxim of price.<br>    Nathless the noblest soul, shouldst thou tell her of passionate things and fail to gaze in her eyes,<br> Shall hold thee cheap in her woman's pride, a clown for thy courtesies. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Love hath two mountain summits, the first where pleasure was born<br>    Faint in the cloud-land of light, a vision of possible hope; the second a tempest-torn<br> Crag where passion is lord and king. Betwixt them what vales forlorn! <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Happiness needs to be learned. In youth the ideal woman<br>     Gazed at afar was a dream, a priceless untouchable prize, while  she in your arms, too human,<br>  Mocked you with love. 'Tis an art learned late; alas, and the whole by no man. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> O! thou in the purple gendered. Thou needst pain for thy case.<br>    Lose thy health or thy heart. Be bowed in thy soul's despond. Be whelmed in a world's disgrace.<br> So shall thy eyes be unsealed of pride and see Love face to face. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> If thou wouldst win love, speak. She shall read the truth on thy lips.<br>     Spoken vows shall prevail, the spell of thy eloquent hand, the  flame of thy finger-tips.<br>  Write? She is reading another's eyes while thy sad pen dips and dips. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  Thou hast ventured a letter of passion, in ease of thy passionate heart?<br>     Nay, be advised; there is fear, mischance in the written word, when lovers are far apart.<br> Pain is betrayed by the subtle pen where lips prevailed without art. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Love is fire. In the lighting, it raiseth a treacherous smoke,<br>    Telling its tale to the world; but anon, growing clear in its flame, may be hid by an old wife's cloak,<br> And the world learn nothing more and forget the knowledge its smouldering woke. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Comes there a trouble upon thee? Be silent, nor own the debt.<br>    Friendship kicks at the goad; thy naked state is its shame; thou hast angered these with thy fret.<br> Wait. The world shall forgive thy sin. It asks but leave to forget. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  The world is an indolent house-shrew. It scolds but cares not to know<br>     Whether in fancy or fact. What it thinks we have done, that it scourges; the true thing we did it lets go.<br> What matter? We fare less ill than our act, ay, all of us; more be our woe! <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> There were days when wisdom is witless, when folly is noble, sublime.<br>    Let us thank the dear gods for our madness, the rush of the blood in our veins, the exuberant pulsings of Time,<br> And pray, while we sin the forbidden sin, we be spared our penance of crime. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> There are habits and customs of passion. Long loves are a tyrannous debt.<br>    But to some there is custom of change, the desire of the untrodden ways, with sunshine of days that were wet,<br> Of the four fair wives of love's kindly law by licence of Mahomet. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Experience all is of use, save one, to have angered a friend.<br>    Break thy heart for a maid; another shall love thee anon. The gold shall return thou didst spend,<br> Ay, and thy beaten back grow whole. But friendship's grave is the end. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Why do I love thee, brother? We have shared what things in our youth,<br>    Battle and siege and triumph, together, always together, in wanderings North and South.<br> But one thing shared binds nearer than all, the kisses of one sweet mouth. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> He that hath loved the mother shall love the daughter no less,<br>    Sister the younger sister. There are tones how sweet to his ear, gestures that plead and press,<br> Echoes fraught with remembered things that cry in the silences. <br> <br>                             *                                   *                                   * <br>  <br> Fly from thy friend in his fortune, his first days of wealth, of fame;<br>    Or, if thou needest to meet him, do thou as the children of Noah, walk backwards and guard thee from blame.<br> He who saw found forgiveness none. With thee it were haply the same. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Bridegroom, thy pride is unseemly. Thou boastest abroad, with a smile,<br>    Thou hast read our humanity's riddle. Nay, wait yet a year with thy bride; she shall lesson thee wiser the while.<br>  Then shalt thou blush for thy words to-day, the shame of thy innocent guile.  <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> The love of a girl is a taper lit on a windy night.<br>    Awhile it lightens our darkness, consoles with its pure sudden flame, and the shadows around it grow white.<br> Anon with a rain-gust of tears it is gone, and we blink more blind for the light. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Sage, thou art proud of thy knowledge, what mountains and marvels seen!<br>     Thou hast loved how madly, how often! hast known what wiles  of the heart, what ways of maid, wife and quean!<br>  Yet shalt thou still be betrayed by love, befooled like a boy on the green. <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Oh, there is honour in all love. Have lips once kissed thee, be dumb,<br>    Save in their only praise. To cheapen the thing thou hast loved is to bite at thyself thy thumb,<br> To shout thy own fool's fault to the world, and beat thy shame on a drum. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Who hath dared mock at thy beauty, Lady? Who deemeth thee old?<br>    If he had seen thee anon in the tender light of thine eyes, as I saw thee, what tales had he told<br> Of ruined kingdoms and kings for one, of misers spending their gold! <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Friendship or Love? You ask it: which binds with the stronger tether?<br>     Friendship? Thy comrade of youth, who laughed with thee on thy  road? What ailed him in that rough weather,<br>  When to thy bosom Love's angel crept, twin tragedies locked together? <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  Friendship is fostered with gifts. Be it so; little presents? Yes.<br>     Friendship! But ah, not Love, since love is itself Love's gift and it angereth him to have less.<br> Woe to the lover who dares to bring more wealth than his tenderness. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> This to the woman: Forbear his gifts, the man's thou wouldst hold.<br>    Cheerfully he shall give and thou nothing guess, yet anon he shall weigh thee in scales of his gold.<br>  Woe to thee then if the charge be more than a heartache's cost all told. <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Thou art tempted, a passion unworthy? Long struggle hath dulled  thy brain?<br>     How shalt thou save thee, poor soul? How buy back the peace  of thy days? If of rest thou be fain,<br>  Oft is there virtue in yielding all; thou shalt not be tempted again. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Sacrifice truly is noble. Yet, Lady, ponder thy fate.<br>     Many a victory, won in tears by her who forbore, hath ruined  her soul's estate.<br>  Virtue's prize was too dear a whim, the price agreed to too great. <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  Virtue or vice? Which, think you, should need more veil for her face?<br>     Virtue hath little fear; she goeth in unchaste guise; she ventureth  all disgrace.<br>  Poor Vice hid in her shame sits dumb while a stranger taketh her place. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Chastity? Who is unchaste? The church-wed wife, without blame<br>    Yielding her body nightly, a lack-love indolent prize, to the lord of her legal shame?<br> Or she, the outlawed passionate soul? Their carnal act is the same. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Whence is our fountain of tears? We weep in childhood for pain,<br>    Anon for triumph in manhood, the sudden glory of praise, the giant mastered and slain.<br> Age weeps only for love renewed and pleasure come back again. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> What is our personal self? A fading record of days<br>    Held in our single brain, memory linked with memory back to our childhood's ways.<br> Beyond it what? A tradition blurred of gossip and nursemaid says. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Why dost thou plain of thine age, O thou with the beard that is thin?<br>    Art thou alone in thy home? Is there none at thy side, not one, to deem thee a man among men?<br>  Nay, thou art young while she holds thy hand, be thy years the threescore and  ten. <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> The world is untimely contrived. It gives us our sunshine in summer,<br>    Its laughing face in our youth, when we need it not to be gay, being each one his own best mummer.<br> All its frown is for life that goes, its smile for the last new comer. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Europe a horologe is, ill mounted and clogged with grime,<br>    Asia a clock run down. Its hands on the dial are still; its hours are told by no chime.<br> Nathless, twice in the twenty-four, it shall tell thee exactly the time. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> What is the profit of knowledge? Ah none, though to know not is pain!<br>    We grieve like a child in the dark; we grope for a chink at the door, for a way of escape from the chain;<br>  We beat on life's lock with our bleeding hands, till it opens. And where is the  gain? <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> I have tried all pleasures but one, the last and sweetest; it waits.<br>    Childhood, the childhood of age, to totter again on the lawns, to have done with the loves and the hates,<br>  To gather the daisies, and drop them, and sleep on the nursing knees of Fates.  <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> I asked of the wise man "Tell me, what age is the age of pleasure?<br>     Twenty years have I lived. I have spread my meshes in vain.  I have taken a paltry treasure.<br>  Where is the heart of the gold?" And he, "I will tell thee anon at leisure." <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> I pleaded at thirty "Listen. I have played, I have lost, I have won.<br>    I have loved in joy and sorrow. My life is a burden grown with the thought of its sands outrun.<br> Where is the joy of our years? At forty? "Say it is just begun." <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  At forty I made love's mourning. I stood alone with my foes,<br>      Foot to fooot with my Fate, as a man at grips with a man, returning blows for blows <br>  In the joy of battle "'Tis here" I cried.  But the wise man, "Nay, who knows?" <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> At fifty I walked sedately. At sixty I took my rest.<br>    I had learned the good with the evil. I troubled my soul no more, I had reached the Isles of the Blest.<br> The sage was dead who had warned my fears. I was wise, I too, with the best. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> What do we know of Being? Our own? How short lived, how base!<br>    That which is not our own? The eternal enrolment of stars, the voids and the silences!<br> The enormous might of the mindless globes whirling through infinite space! <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> The infinite Great overhead, the infinite Little beneath!<br>    The turn of the cellular germ, the giddy evolving of life in the intricate struggle for breath,<br> The microbe, the mote alive in the blood, the eyeless atom of death! <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Yet which is the greater Being? We have dreamed of a life-giving God,<br>     Him, the mind of the Sun, the conscious brain-flower of Space,  with a cosmic form and abode,<br>  With thought and pity and power of will, Humanity's ethical code. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> We have dreamed, but we do not believe. Be He here, be He not, 'tis as one.<br>     His Godhead, how does it help? He is far. He is blind to our  need. Nay, nay, He is less than the Sun,<br>  Less than the least of the tremulous stars, than our old scorned idols of stone. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> For He heareth not, nor seeth. As we to the motes in our blood,<br>     So is He to our lives, a possible symbol of power, a formula  half understood.<br>  But the voice of Him, where? the hand grip, where? A child's cry lost in a wood. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Therefore is Matter monarch, the eternal the infinite Thing,<br>     The "I that am" which reigneth, which showeth no shadow of change,  while humanities wane and spring,<br>  Which saith "Make no vain Gods before me, who only am Lord and King." <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> What then is Merlyn's message, his word to thee weary of pain,<br>    Man, on thy desolate march, thy search for an adequate cause, for a thread, for a guiding rein,<br> Still in the maze of thy doubts and fears, to bring thee thy joy again? <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Thou hast tried to climb to the sky; thou hast called it a firmament;<br>    Thou hast found it a thing infirm, a heaven which is no haven, a bladder punctured and rent,<br> A mansion frail as the rainbow mist, as thy own soul impotent. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Thou hast clung to a dream in thy tears; thou hast stayed thy rage with a hope;<br>    Thou hast anchored thy wreck to a reed, a cobweb spread for thy sail, with sand for thy salvage rope;<br> Thou hast made thy course with a compass marred, a toy for thy telescope. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  What hast thou done with thy days? Bethink thee, Man, that alone,<br>     Thou of all sentient things, hast learned to grieve in thy joy,  hast earned thee the malison<br>  Of going sad without cause of pain, a weeper and woe-begone. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Why? For the dream of a dream of another than this fair life<br>    Joyous to all but thee, by every creature beloved in its spring-time of passion rife,<br>  By every creature but only thee, sad husband with sadder wife, <br>  <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Scared at thought of the end, at the simple logic of death,<br>    Scared at the old Earth's arms outstretched to hold thee again, thou child of an hour, of a breath,<br> Seeking refuge with all but her, the mother that comforteth. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Merlyn's message is this: he would bid thee have done with pride.<br>    What has it brought thee but grief, thy parentage with the Gods, thy kinship with beasts denied?<br> What thy lore of a life to come in a cloud-word deified? <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> O thou child which art Man, distraught with a shadow of ill!<br>    O thou fool of thy dreams, thou gatherer rarely of flowers but of fungi of evil smell,<br> Poison growths of the autumn woods, rank mandrake and mort-morell! <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> Take thy joy with the rest, the bird, the beast of the field,<br>     Each one wiser than thou, which frolic in no dismay, which seize  what the seasons yield,<br>  And lay thee down when thy day is done content with the unrevealed. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br> Take the thing which thou hast. Forget thy kingdom unseen.<br>    Lean thy lips on the Earth; she shall bring new peace to thy eyes with her healing vesture green.<br> Drink once more at her fount of love, the one true hippocrene. <br> <br>                           *                                  *                                  * <br> <br>  O thou child of thy fears! Nay, shame on thy childish part<br>     Weeping when called to thy bed. Take cheer. When the shadows come, when the crowd is leaving the mart,<br> Then shalt thou learn that thou needest sleep, Death's kindly arms for thy heart.<br> <br> <br>                                                                      THE END <br> <br> <br>
