Let one breath only be drawn by each of the morice for his waes-hael.<br>  <br>                 I.<br>  Waes-hael for knight and dame!<br>     O! merry be their dole;<br>  Drink-hael! in Jesu's name<br>     We fill the tawny bowl;<br>  But cover down the curving crest,<br>  Mould of the orient lady's breast.<br>  <br>                 II.<br>  Waes-hael! yet lift no lid:<br>     Drain ye the reeds for wine!<br>  Drink-hael! the milk was hid<br>     That soothed that Babe divine;<br>  Hushed, as this hollow channel flows,<br>  He drew the balsam from the rose.<br>  <br>                 III.<br>  Waes-hael! thus glowed the breast<br>     Where a God yearned to cling;<br>  Drink-hael! so Jesu pressed<br>     Life from its mystic spring;<br>  Then hush, and bend in reverent sign,<br>  And breathe the thrilling reeds for wine.<br>  <br>                 IV.<br>  Waes-hael! in shadowy scene,<br>     Lo! Christmas children we;<br>  Drink-hael! behold we lean<br>     At a far Mother's knee;<br>  To dream, that thus her bosom smiled,<br>  And learn the lip of Bethlehem's Child.<br>  <center>Note.</center>     The rounded shape of the bowl for waes-hael was intended to recal the image of a mother's breast; and thus it was meant, with a touching simplicity, to blend the thought of our Chrismas gladness with the earliest nurture of the Child Jesus.
