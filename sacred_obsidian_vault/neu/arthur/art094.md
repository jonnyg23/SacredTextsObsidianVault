I was with her then.<br> She gathered up her piteous pride,<br>    But she could never weave again.<br> <br> The mirror cracked from side to side;<br>    I saw its silver shadows go.<br> "The curse has come on me!" she cried.<br>    Poor lady!  I had told her so.<br> <br> She was so proud: she would not hide.<br>    She only laughed and tried to sing.<br> But singing, in her song she died.<br>    <i> She did not profit anything.</i> <br>
