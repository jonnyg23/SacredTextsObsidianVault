POETRY</i> </h2>  <h3 align="CENTER">by</h3>  <h2 align="CENTER">BISHOP THOMAS PERCY</h2>  </center>  <br>  <br>  When Arthur first in court began,<br>     And was approvèd king,<br>  By force of armes great victorys wonne,<br>     And conquest home did bring;<br>  <br>  Then into England straight he came<br>     With fifty good and able<br>  Knights that resorted unto him,<br>     And were of the Round Table.<br>  <br>  And many justs and turnaments<br>     Whereto were many prest,<br>  Wherein some knights did farr excell,<br>     And eke surmount the rest.<br>  <br>  But one Sir Lancelot du Lake,<br>     Who was approvèd well,<br>  He for his deeds and feates of armes<br>     All others did excell.<br>  <br>  When he had rested him a while,<br>     In play, and game, and sportt,<br>  He said he wold goe prove himselfe,<br>     In some adventurous sort.<br>  <br>  He armèd rode in forrest wide,<br>     And met a damsell faire,<br>  Who told him of adventures great,<br>     Whereto he gave good care.<br>  <br>  "Why shold I not?" quoth Lancelott tho,<br>     "For that cause came I hither."<br>  "Thou seemst," quoth she, "a knight full good,"<br>     And I will bring thee thither,<br>  <br>  "Wheras a mighty knight doth dwell,<br>     That now is of great fame;<br>  Therefore tell me what knight thou art,<br>     And what may be thy name."<br>  <br>  "My name is Lancelot du Lake."<br>     Quoth she, "It likes me than;<br>  Here dwelles a knight who never was<br>     Yet matcht with any man;<br>  <br>  "Who has in prison threescore knights<br>     And four, that he did wound;<br>  Knights of King Arthurs court they be,<br>     And of his Table Round."<br>  <br>  She brought him to a river side,<br>     And also to a tree,<br>  Whereon a copper bason hung,<br>     And many shields to see.<br>  <br>  He struck soe hard, the bason broke:<br>     And Tarquin soon he spyed:<br>  Who drove a horse before him fast,<br>     Whereon a knight lay tyed.<br>  <br>  "Sir Knight," then sayd Sir Lancelòtt,<br>     "Bring me that horse-load hither,<br>  And lay him downe, and let him rest;<br>     Weel try our force together.<br>  <br>  "For, as I understand, thou hast,<br>     Soe far as thou art able,<br>  Done great despite and shame unto<br>     The knights of the Round Table."<br>  <br>  "If thou be of the Table Round,"<br>     Quoth Tarquin, speedilye,<br>  "Both thee and all thy fellowship<br>     I utterly defye."<br>  <br>  "That's over much," quoth Lancelott tho,<br>     "Defend thee by and by."<br>  They sett their speares unto their steeds,<br>     And each att other flye.<br>  <br>  They coucht their speares, (their horses ran,<br>     As though there had been thunder);<br>  And strucke them each immidst their shields,<br>     Wherewith they broke in sunder.<br>  <br>  Their horsses backes brake under them,<br>     The knights were both astound;<br>  To avoyd their horsses they made great haste,<br>     And light upon the ground.<br>  <br>  They tooke them to their shields full fast,<br>     Their swords they drew out than;<br>  With mighty strokes most eagerlye<br>     Each at the other ran.<br>  <br>  They wounded were, and bled full sore,<br>     They both for breath did stand,<br>  And leaning on their swordes awhile,<br>     Quoth Tarquine, "Hold thy hand,<br>  <br>  "And tell to me what I shall aske;"<br>     "Say on," quoth Lancelot tho.<br>  "Thou art," quoth Tarquine, "the best knight<br>     That ever I did know;<br>  <br>  "And like a knight that I did hate;<br>     Soe that thou be not hee,<br>  I will deliver all the rest,<br>     And eke accord with thee."<br>  <br>  "That is well sayd," quoth Lancelott tho,<br>     "But sith it must be soe,<br>  What knight is that thou hatest thus?<br>     I pray thee to meshow."<br>  <br>  "His name is Lancelot du Lake,<br>     He slew my brother deere;<br>  Him I suspect of all the rest:<br>     I would I had him here."<br>  <br>  "Thy wish thou hast, but yet unknowne;<br>     I am Lancelot du Lake,<br>  Now knight of Arthurs Table Round;<br>     King Hauds son of Schuwake;<br>  <br>  "And I desire thee do thy worst."<br>     "Ho, ho," quoth Tarquin tho,<br>  "One of us two shall end our lives,<br>     Before that we do go.<br>  <br>  "If thou be Lancelot du Lake<br>     Then welcome shalt thou bee;<br>  Wherfore see thou thyself defend,<br>     For now defye I thee."<br>  <br>  They buckled then together so,<br>     Like unto wild boares rashing,<br>  And with their swords and shields they ran<br>     At one another slashing.<br>  <br>  The ground besprinkled was with blood,<br>     Tarquin began to yield;<br>  For he gave backe for wearinesse,<br>     And lowe did beare his shield.<br>  <br>  This soone Sir Lancelot espyde,<br>     He leapt upon him then,<br>  He pull'd him downe upon his knee,<br>     And rushing off his helm,<br>  <br>  Forthwith he strucke his necke in two;<br>     And when he had soe done,<br>  From prison, threescore knights and four<br>     Delivered everye one.
