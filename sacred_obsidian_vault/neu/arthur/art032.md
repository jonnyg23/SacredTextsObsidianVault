And wounded sore,<br>           Beside a brook ran near,<br>  He spied the false Sir Mordred,<br>           Was leaning on his spear.<br>  "Now pay me full, false traitor,<br>           The debt thy treasons owe;<br>  Would'st reive thine uncle's crown, and force<br>           His Queen thy bed-fellowe!"<br>  Then on the false Sir Mordred<br>           Like wolf on fawn he flew,<br>  And Rone his spear a full fathome<br>           He thrust his body through.<br>  <br>                 IX.<br>  <br>  Shrieked wild for pain that traitor knight,<br>           And in his dying throe<br>  On Arthur's helmet blindly strake<br>           So furious fell a blow,<br>  That blow nor bone nor basnet<br>           Might stay its force nor stand:<br>  Then dropped the shivered weapon<br>           From Mordred's lifeless hand!<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 X.<br>  <br>  The moon is cold on Camlan,<br>           And on its thousands slain,<br>  Save but the pillers pille the dead,<br>           None trode that silent plain!<br>  To help Sir Arthur at his need<br>           But only two were found,<br>  Of all that brave three hundred<br>           Sat at his Table Round!<br>  His boteler and his chamberlain --<br>           Sir Lucan and Bedwere --<br>  And many a gash, and ghastly,<br>           The fainting brothers bare.<br>  Alas for good Sir Lucan!<br>           His wound burst open wide,<br>  And out thereat his bowels gushed,<br>           He groaned aloud, and died!<br>  <br>                 XI.<br>  <br>  And when Sir Arthur's trance was pass'd,<br>           He gazed, and him beside,<br>  Of all his many thousands, none<br>           Save brave Bedwere espied.<br>  And thus he spake -- "Sir Bedwere,<br>           Go get thee haste, and take<br>  My trusty sword Escaliber,<br>           And cast in yonder lake;<br>  And fling it far will all thy might,<br>           What thereupon shall be<br>  Observe it well, and speed thee<br>           To truly tell it me."<br>  <br>                 XII.<br>  <br>  That sword of worth and wonder,<br>           Whose sweep in Arthur's hand<br>  Nor shirt of mail, nor plate of brass,<br>           Nor casque of steel might stand,<br>  A priceless gift gave Merlin,<br>           Won from his peerless make.<br>  Within their bower of pleasure,<br>           The Lady of the Lake.<br>  <br>                 XIII.<br>  <br>  Embossed was hilt and handle<br>           With gem and jewel rare,<br>  And scrolled the blade with magic sign,<br>           And mystic character.<br>  "Ah pity were," -- Sir Bedwere thought, --<br>           To fling in yonder lake<br>  So goodly thing!" and hid it<br>           Within hazle-brake.<br>  <br>                 XIV.<br>  <br>  "What sawest thou, Sir Bedwere?"<br>           "But wave and water free;"<br>  "Nay, nay, thy vision wandered,<br>           Go look more heedfully.<br>  What sawest thou now?"  "Nor token<br>           Nor sign the water gave,<br>  But silverly and softly<br>           Did wap with wind and wave."<br>  <br>                 XV.<br>  <br>  He looked a look of anger,<br>           "Shame on the knight would say<br>  A soothless tale twice over,<br>           All for a sword's inlay!<br>  But haste, my life is ebbing fast,<br>           Thy fault and folly through --"<br>  This time the charmed weapon<br>           Far o'er the waters flew.<br>  <br>                 XVI.<br>  <br>  But ere it reached the water,<br>           A giant arm upreared,<br>  And clutched it fast, and waved it thrice<br>           On high, then disappeared;<br>  And when Sir Bedwere told that sign,<br>           "Must now no tarrying --<br>  Haste, lay me down beside the lake,<br>           They're nigh will succour bring."<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 XVII.<br>  <br>  And swift as arrow shoots from bow,<br>           Shot barge of beauty rare,<br>  Nor steerer had, nor rower,<br>           That barge, but ladies fair:<br>  And of these ladies crowns of gold<br>           Upon their head had three,<br>  And glittered in the moonlight<br>           Their jewelled bravery!<br>  <br>                 XVIII.<br>  <br>  Aloud she wept that queenliest seemed<br>           That crowned three among --<br>  "Alas! alas! my brother dear, <br>           Why tarried'st thou so long?<br>  Nor weeting gavest, nor warning.<br>           Of thine so evil cheer,<br>  Nor spedst that token sooner<br>           When help was all so near!<br>  Light task had been, and speedy, <br>           Thy gashes green to close,<br>  And by mine art, and with mine herbs<br>           To work thy pain's repose;<br>  But now long time and sorely<br>           My leech's art 'twill strain,<br>  And many a year must circle<br>           Ere thou see earth again!"<br>  <br>                 XIX.<br>  <br>  His fainting head they pillowed<br>           That lady's lap upon;<br>  "Now row ye, sisters, row ye<br>           With speed for Avalon!"<br>  As meteor shoots or moon-beam<br>           Across the waters blue,<br>  It shot, that bark of mystery,<br>           Then melted from the view.<br>  And long with fear and wonder<br>           Looked Bedwere from the shore<br>  Across that silent water,<br>           But ne'er saw Arthur more!<br>  <br>           NOTE. -- Though Sir Bedwere never saw Arthur more, it is unnecessary to inform the readers of the <i> Morte Arthur</i> , that, by accident or miracle, he eventually discovered his tomb in the chapel of an hermitage at Glastonbury (the Avalon of the Round-Table Romances); that he became forthwith a monk, and spent the residue of his days in praying for the soul of his royal master; that Queen Guinevere took the veil at Ambresbury, and made a good end; that Sir Launcelot, after finding out by chance the place of her retreat, being refused his earnest petition for one parting kiss, and being, moreover, lectured by the former partner of his guilt of the sinfulness of his past life, and admonished to repentance, went on his way sorrowing till he reached Glastonbury; where finding his old comrade-in-arms, Sir Bedwere, now turned monk, he joined his society, assumed the monastic habit, was in due time ordained a priest, and becoming as pre-eminent in piety as he had been in valour, died at a good old age in the odour of sanctity; his <i> body</i>  being, at his dying request, removed to Joyous Garde for interment, while his <i> soul</i>  was (as the bishop who in a vision had witnessed the whole transaction, with arithmetical fidelity testified) escorted to heaven by "thirty thousand and seven" attending angels!<br>  <br>  <br>  <b> Footnotes.</b> <br>  <br>  <a> 1.  Logres is England, so named from Locrine (or Logrine), eldest son of the fabulous <i> Brut</i>  or Brutus, to whom in the tripartite division of the island, it fell by inheritance.<br>  <br>  </a><a> 2.  <i> Pridwin</i> , the shield; <i> Escalibur</i>  (or Kaliburn), the sword; and <i> Rone</i> , the spear of King Arthur.<br>   <br> <br>
