 like bridgegroom<br>           They looked, I ween, and bride:<br>  "Ah! pity," whispered ladies,<br>           "Their love was sin!" and sigh'd.<br>  A four-and-twenty maidens,<br>           On milk-white palfrey borne,<br>  Behind the Queen rode daintily,<br>           Fresh as that April morn.<br>  With scarf and plume, in boyhood's bloom,<br>           Behind Sir Launcelot,<br>  Of gentle strain, twelve pages rein<br>           Their curving coursers hot.<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 III.<br>  <br>  They cross'd the presence-chamber,<br>           And knelt them duteously;<br>  And lords and ladies many a'wept<br>           For joy that sight to see.<br>  But sternly cold Sir Arthur looked<br>           Upon that kneeling pair;<br>  Nor word he spake to Launcelot,<br>           Nor word to Guinevere!<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>  Flashed then his eye for anger,<br>           And flushed his brow for shame;<br>  And proudly rose Sir Launcelot,<br>           And raised that royal dame --<br>  "My lord the king!

 laments me sorely<br>           That twain my lovers true;<br>  But well thou wot'st 'twas blindly done,<br>           Unweeting whom I slew.<br>  And for atonement, hear thou now,<br>           The penance I intend --<br>  To Sandwich town, in sackcloth gown,<br>           To barefoot pilgrim wend:<br>  And whereso'er I rest by night,<br>           To found me convent fair,<br>  Where holy men, the live year long,<br>           Shall for their souls do prayer."<br>  <br>                 V.<br>  <br>  O then, on Launcelot kindly<br>           Sir Arthur turned his eye;<br>  But hastily, and haughtily,<br>           Sir Gawayne made reply --<br>  "My lord the king, so listeth him,<br>           But anger or arraign,<br>  May take that lady to his grace,<br>           Or if he list, refrain:<br>  But peace or pardon pledge he thee,<br>           Or seat at Table Round,<br>  Shall never more Sir Gawayne<br>           Be seen on British ground.<br>  So speed thee hence in safety,<br>           As safely thou art come:<br>  But tarry not, beyond the sea<br>           To harbour find and home,<br>  Ere fifteen days be come and gone;<br>           Or wete thou well ere long,<br>  Our trumpets from thy morning-sleep<br>           Shall wake thee with their song."<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 VI.<br>  <br>  "Ah, noble realm!" sighed Launcelot,<br>           And must we part us so?<br>  For bield or biding here is none,<br>           While Gawayne is my foe!<br>  Alas!  that land or lordship,<br>           I wan or knightly name,<br>  In this fair isle, like felon vile,<br>           To be cast forth with shame!<br>  O broad art thou, and beautiful,<br>           The Briton's isle to see,<br>  With mead, and mere, and mountain,<br>           And strath and forest free!<br>  For trench thou hast the ocean-stream,<br>           And rocks for rampart-wall;<br>  Thou rearest steed for knightly need,<br>           And steer for festive hall.<br>  For brand, for bow, to ride, to row,<br>           Or battle-axe to wield.<br>  So stalworth arm, so fearless heart,<br>           No hand on earth may yield,<br>  Or dames so true, or maidens<br>           So witch with beauty's smile, --<br>  A happy-doled that man I hold<br>           Doth home the Briton's isle!<br>  But false and fickle lover<br>           Is fortune well I know;<br>  Her wheel a'roll, who loftiest rise<br>           Do ever fall most low.<br>  A banished man and branded<br>           From land I loved so long,<br>  Most noble dame!  speak fair my name<br>           Against maligner's wrong.<br>  And come defame or danger,<br>           Then lightly send me word;<br>  And doubt thou ne'er Sir Launcelot<br>           Shall right thee with his sword!"<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 VII.<br>  <br>  He kissed her ivory forehead,<br>           Her trembling hand he took,<br>  And round that presence-chamber<br>           He looked a lofty look --<br>  "Stands here the man shall say it,<br>           Or shall uphold it said,<br>  She is untrue this lady<br>           To Arthur's bond or bed?"<br>  Then to her lord he led her,<br>           And reverently he bent<br>  Before them both in silence,<br>           And forth for ever went!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <br>
