<h2 align="CENTER">GEORGE AUGUSTUS SIMCOX</h2>  </center>  <br>  Came tidings unto Caerleon,<br>     Where Arthur kept Shrovetide,<br>  How, far away in Avalon,<br>     A scaly dragon's pride,<br>  With visage like a woman's, wan,<br>     Wasted the country-side.<br>  <br>  Arthur let cry through all his land,<br>     "Who curses me for wrong?"<br>  Then flowed there in on every hand<br>     The stream of loyal song,<br>  "If right could make a king's throne stand,<br>     Then Arthur's would stand long."<br>  <br>  When Arthur's praise was duly sung,<br>     A way-worn maiden came,<br>  And said, with duteous faltering tongue,<br>     "Ye are not much to blame,<br>  My liege, for we were very young,<br>     Though ye forgat our game.<br>  <br>  "We played at guessing thoughts," she said.<br>     "Ye did not guess aright.<br>  Ye sware to give me one to wed,<br>     To be my lord and knight.<br>  Now twenty years, methinks, are fled,<br>     And ye forget our plight."<br>  <br>  The dew was on her raven hair<br>     And her blue glistering eye;<br>  No dust on foot or ankle bare,<br>     Though all the land was dry;<br>  And every knight was ready there<br>     To wed with her or die.<br>  <br>  "But I," she said, "am dowerless,<br>     And comfortless of men,<br>  And sojourn in the wilderness,<br>     And in the dragon's den."<br>  Pale looks were plentiful, I guess,<br>     About the Table then.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lancelot looked in her pleading face,<br>     And sighed, "If I were free;"<br>  Quoth Tristram as he left the place,<br>     "His answer serves for me."<br>  Galahad said something of God's grace;<br>     She said, "I choose not thee."<br>  <br>  Geraint bowed over Enid's veil;<br>     His visage was more white.<br>  Lamorack buckled up his mail,<br>     And looked into the night.<br>  Gawain, whose face was always pale,<br>     Seemed ruddy in the light.<br>  <br>  She laid her little hand in his,<br>     He chose to let it stay;<br>  She put her rosy cheek to his,<br>     He did not turn away;<br>  She put her cherry lips to his,<br>     Which were as dim as clay.<br>  <br>  He spake, as soon as it was time,<br>     Of pleasant ways of love,<br>  That rules the sweetly-ordered chime<br>     Of stars and saints above,<br>  And bade the minstrels sing the rhyme<br>     Of the true turtle-dove;<br>  <br>  And bade them call the holy priest<br>     To knit the twain in one.<br>  She said, "I keep my marriage-feast<br>     Not here, at Avalon."<br>  None knew why all men as she ceased<br>     Trembled in Caerleon.<br>  <br>  "Where shall we find a priest to wait<br>     And bless the marriage-bed?<br>  And if your house be desolate,<br>     How shall your guests be fed?<br>  And who will guide them to our gate?"<br>     The courteous bridegroom said.<br>  <br>  "The dragon's scales of woven glass<br>     Will light my banquet well;<br>  Iscariot will sing the mass,<br>     And Pilate toll the bell;<br>  And all my marriage guests will pass<br>     Over the mouth of hell.<br>  <br>  "I go to the great wilderness,<br>     And to the dragon's lair,<br>  Where the great hills are harbourless,<br>     And the sharp rocks are bare;<br>  And if thou pity my distress,<br>     Then thou wilt meet me there.<br>  <br>  "But sit thou with thy master here<br>     For three days yet," saith she;<br>  "Then shalt thou ride in desert drear,<br>     Three days alone to me;<br>  The seventh day with lordly cheer<br>     Our marriage-feast shall be."<br>  <br>  She kissed Sir Gawain on the mouth,<br>     He kissed her on the hand;<br>  Then she departed to the south,<br>     Between the sea and sand,<br>  Leaving behind a bitter drouth<br>     In all King Arthur's land.<br>  <br>  Thereat the King was full of woe,<br>     The princes of dismay.<br>  A bolder man had feared to go,<br>     But Gawain feared to stay,<br>  And parted in a storm of snow,<br>     Alone, on the third day.<br>  <br>  The seventh day, by Grammarie,<br>     And by the dragon's power,<br>  He saw beside a leaden sea<br>     A rosy granite tower,<br>  That fronted to a sunny lea,<br>     Blood-red with wild windflower.<br>  <br>  Thereon went many quick and dead,<br>     And some who do not die;<br>  Each wore a garland on the head,<br>     Each laughed within the eye.<br>  No flower was bent beneath their tread,<br>     No dewy leaf brushed dry.<br>  <br>  They passed within the granite gate,<br>     And there was room for all;<br>  Gawain could see his lady wait,<br>     In green and purple pall.<br>  As he lit down, the cloud of fate<br>     Went up from Arthur's hall.<br>  <br>  Beneath Gawain his feet seemed lame,<br>     He stumbled and he fell;<br>  There lived for him a subtle flame<br>     In every crushed wind-bell.<br>  She said, "No marvel, for ye came<br>     Over the mouth of hell."<br>  <br>  He saw an altar to the west,<br>     He saw the incense sink,<br>  And in the bag on the priest's breast<br>     He heard the silver chink.<br>  One stood to serve in purple vest,<br>     Whose hands were washed in ink.<br>  <br>  Black serpents round the altar ran,<br>     But Judas chanted well,<br>  And sweetly rang his sacristan<br>     The silver sacring bell;<br>  And so the marriage rite began,<br>     Over the pit of hell.<br>  <br>  Sweet gusts of music from below<br>     Lifted the lady's veil;<br>  Soft sudden flakes of rosy snow<br>     Flecked the black serpent's mail.<br>  'Mid happy faces all aglow<br>     The bridegroom's face was pale.<br>  <br>  The altar sank beneath the floor,<br>     Arose the marriage feast,<br>  Sweeter and merrier and more<br>     The melody increased;<br>  None started as grim graveworms tore<br>     The sacristan and priest.<br>  <br>  In shifting many-coloured light,<br>     Too bright to look upon,<br>  You saw the guests, you saw the knight,<br>     Where that wild radiance shone;<br>  You did not see the lady bright<br>     Who reigns in Avalon.<br>  <br>  Yet all, as though beneath her eye,<br>     Were busy to rejoice;<br>  And now the music mounted high<br>     To glorify her choice,<br>  Who felt the dragon sliding by,<br>     And heard the lady's voice.<br>  <br>  A moment not a guest was seen<br>     Within the marriage room;<br>  A moment, and the magic sheen<br>     Faded in magic gloom,<br>  Through which, half seen, the fairy queen<br>     Scattered a sweet perfume.<br>  <br>  Gawain bent low for courtesie,<br>     And thanked her for her grace;<br>  He laid his hand upon her knee<br>     And looked into her face,<br>  And wondered if he did not see<br>     The dragon in her place.<br>  <br>  The lady his weak hand hath ta'en,<br>     And bidden him be of cheer;<br>  He asked her, "Is the dragon slain?"<br>     She said, "He is not here.<br>  The dragon will not waste again<br>     In Arthur's golden year."<br>  <br>  Arose a happy fairy sound,<br>     As of a little well<br>  By the first break of spring unbound;<br>     Cool flowers began to swell<br>  From underneath the burning ground,<br>     To veil the mouth of hell.<br>  <br>  The moon above the misty lea<br>     Hung like a globe of fire,<br>  Whereby Gawain a hag might see<br>     In ghastly gay attire,<br>  Whose wrinkled face flushed horribly<br>     With jubilant desire.<br>  <br>  He knew her, for she held the hand<br>     He gave to one more fair;<br>  He knew her by the magic band<br>     His lady used to wear,<br>  With jewels from an unknown land<br>     Bound in her raven hair.<br>  <br>  Fondly she lisped, "My honey knight,<br>     It needs not to rehearse<br>  Wherefore I lifted up the blight,<br>     And took away the curse,<br>  Because ye took me in God's sight<br>     For better and for worse.<br>  <br>  "Though thou be very fair to see,<br>     And I a loathly crone,<br>  Yet what is that to thee and me<br>     Before King Arthur's throne?<br>  And when I hunger after thee,<br>     I hunger for mine own."<br>  <br>  Gawain, the knight of courtesie,<br>     Bowed down his stately head,<br>  And said, "Sweet wife, most certainly<br>     We in God's sight are wed,"<br>  As he drew back the canopy<br>     Over the bridal bed.<br>  <br>  Full still he lay till break of day<br>     In counterfeited bliss,<br>  Nor turned his loyal cheek away<br>     From any loathly kiss,<br>  And saw the while the lightnings play,<br>     And heard her serpents hiss.<br>  <br>  There lay beside Gawain at morn<br>     A maiden undefiled,<br>  As rosy as the blooming thorn<br>     When eves in May are mild;<br>  As tender as the babe unborn,<br>     To life scarce reconciled.<br>  <br>  Her brow was veiled with woven brass,<br>     And bonds were on the hands,<br>  Which held an emerald hourglass<br>     Wherein few golden sands;<br>  Her feet seemed quivering to pass<br>     Into untravelled lands.<br>  <br>  She kissed her husband thick and fast<br>     On lip and brow and cheek,<br>  Her captive arms round him she cast,<br>     And then she tried to speak,<br>  Until the love came out at last,<br>     Although the voice was weak.<br>  <br>  "Wilt have by day a lovely may,<br>     By night a loathly crone,<br>  That other men may see and say,<br>     His bride becomes a throne;<br>  Or have me foul for them by day,<br>     And fair for thee alone?"<br>  <br>  He thought, "Whate'er my choice may be,<br>     I cannot choose but ill,<br>  For she by slight of Grammarie<br>     Would fool my simple skill."<br>  He said, "This is too hard for me,<br>     Use your own gentle will."<br>  <br>  Oh, sweetly smiled the lady then,<br>     And sweetly laughed the lea,<br>  Sweet roses veiled the dragon's den;<br>     "Henceforth my face shall be<br>  Fair when I will for other men,<br>     And all day long for thee!"<br>  <br>  She laughed, "'Tis well ye did not play<br>     When Arthur lost the game,<br>  For you have guessed aright to-day<br>     The wish of every dame."<br>  "Yet," said Gawain, "I cannot say<br>     My lady's lovesome name."<br>  <br>  The colours of the dragon's mail<br>     Flashed in the dewy grass;<br>  The lady's face flushed red and pale,<br>     "And I had hoped, alas!<br>  That thou shouldst rend the brazen veil,<br>     And loose the bonds of glass.<br>  <br>  "Ah! woe is me, it may not be,<br>     And I have loved thee so;<br>  But henceforth thou shalt never see<br>     My footprints where I go,<br>  To wake the flowers upon the lea,<br>     And kiss away the snow."<br>  <br>  He smiled farewell, her colour rose;<br>     She cried aloud, "For shame!<br>  I sojourn seven years with those<br>     Who do not ask my name.<br>  Hence with thee and thy painted shows;<br>     Hence by the road ye came!<br>  <br>  "Go home and boast in Caerleon,<br>     Below thy courtly breath,<br>  About the bonny bride ye won,<br>     For whom hell hungereth!<br>  But come no more to Avalon,<br>     For that will be thy death."<br>  <br>  Low fell the veil of woven brass,<br>     On heavy eyelids bound;<br>  On folded hands the bonds of glass<br>     Clanked softly without sound;<br>  And so Gawain beheld her pass<br>     Over the dewy ground.<br>
