The bishop said,<br>  "Yet go to Launcelot's bedside!"<br>      They go; they find him dead.<br> <br>   Still asleep, and fast asleep,<br>      Oh, sweet the smile he wore!<br>  Sir Launcelot lay fast asleep,<br>      To waken never more.<br> <br>   Yes, there he lay, and smiled in sleep;<br>      And a sweetest savour rose:<br>  But greater dolour none has heard,<br>      Than the dole within that house.<br> <br>           *        *        *<br> <br>   Next day, the mass of requiem sung,<br>      They lift for him his sword.<br>  The same bier that bare Gwenevere,<br>      Bare him to Joyous Garde.<br> <br>   And still asleep, and fast asleep,<br>      His visage open laid,<br>  Within the quire of Joyous Garde<br>      Sir Launcelot lies dead.<br> <br>
