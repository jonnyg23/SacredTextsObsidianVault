A thousand times we read;<br>  A thousand turn the page and understand,<br>  And think we know the record of a life,<br>  When lo! if we will open once again<br>  The awful volume, hid, mysterious,<br>  Intent, there lies the unseen alphabet--<br>  Re-reads the tale from breath to death, and spells<br>  A living language that we never knew.<br>  <br>  This that I read was one short song of hers,<br>  A fragment, I interpret, or a lost<br>  Faint prelude to another--missing too.<br>  She sang it (says the text) one summer night,<br>  After the vespers, when the Abbess passed<br>  And blessed her; when the nuns were gone, and when<br>  She, kneeling in her drowsy cell, had said<br>  Her prayers (poor soul!), her sorrowful prayers, in which<br>  She had besought the Lord, for His dear sake,<br>  And love and pity of His Only Son,<br>  To wash her of her stain, and make her fit<br>  On summer nights, behind the convent bars<br>  And on stone floors, with bruisèd lips, to pray<br>  Away all vision but repentance from<br>  Her soul.<br>  <br>     When, kneeling as she was, her limbs<br>  Refused to bear her, and she fell afaint<br>  From weariness and striving to become<br>  A holy woman, all her splendid length<br>  Upon the ground, and groveled there, aghast<br>  That buried nature was not dead in her,<br>  But lived, a rebel through her fair, fierce youth;<br>  Aghast to find that claspèd hands would clench;<br>  Aghast to feel that praying lips refused<br>  Like saints to murmur on, but shrank<br>  And quivered dumb.  "Alas!  I cannot pray!"<br>  Cried Guinevere.  "I cannot pray!  I will<br>  Not lie!  God is an honest God, and I<br>  Will be an honest sinner to his face.<br>  Will it be wicked if I sing?  Oh!  let<br>  Me sing a little, of I know not what;<br>  Let me just sing, I know not why.  For lips<br>  Grow stiff with praying <i> all</i>  the night.<br>  Let me believe that I am happy, too.<br>  A blessèd blessèd woman, who is fit<br>  To sing because she did not sin; or else<br>  That God forgot it for a little while<br>  And does not mind me very much.<br>              Dear Lord,"<br>  (Said Guinevere), "wilt thou not listen while<br>  I sing, as well as while I pray?  I shall<br>  Feel safer so.  For I have naught to say<br>  God should not hear.  The song comes as the prayer<br>  Doth come.  Thou listenest.  I sing." . . .<br>  <br>  <i> Purple the night, and high were the skies, and higher<br>     The eyes that leaned like the stars of my soul, to me.<br>  Whom loveth the Queen?  Him who hath right to crown her.<br>        Who but the King is he?<br>  <br>  Sultry the day, and gold was the hair, and golden<br>     The mist that blinded my soul away from me.<br>  Dethroned for a dream, for a gleam, for a glance, for a color,<br>        How could the crownèd be?<br>  <br>  Life goeth by like a deed, nor returneth forever.<br>     Death cometh on, fleet-footed as pity should be.<br>  Hush!  When she waketh at last and looketh about her,<br>        Whom will a woman see?</i> <br>  <br>           Thus in her cell,<br>  Deep in the summer night, sang Guinevere--<br>  A little, broken, blind, sweet melody--<br>  And then she kneeled upon the convent floor,<br>  And, peaceful, finished all her prayer and slept;<br>  For she had naught to say God might not hear.
