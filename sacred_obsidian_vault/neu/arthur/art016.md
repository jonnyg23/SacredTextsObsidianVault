P. B.<br>  <br>                       FIRST PART<br> <br>                                1<br> <br>  A  lad I was, dark-haired and dark of eye,<br>       Ever the first to court a danger shown,<br>       Ever the last to lay my courage down<br>  In face of man or sprite.  Strife then ran high<br>     Betwixt us and the strangers; and the land<br>     Stirred with a thrill it could not understand.<br>  <br>  For 'twas the tie that bound mother and child,<br>       And strangers would possess her bosom bare,<br>       And strangers batten on our woodland air,<br>  And strangers trample on our mountains wild;<br>     And so the earth stirred in stern motherhood,<br>     And all her children knew in their blood.<br>  <br>  Slight-limbed was I, nor challenged feats of strength:<br>       My great-thewed cousins hurled the massy rock,<br>       And flung the fir-tree that ten winters' shock<br>  Had left unharmed. Thick shoulders, thighs of length,<br>     Flat hips, stout buttocks; -- they could throw a steer,<br>     Or drink their shallow wits away the livelong year.<br>  <br>                                2<br> <br>  Yberha was her name. Across the flood,<br>  Where then a mounded tower in stoutness stood,<br>       There lived her father; -- silent, moody man,<br>     Caring not who was kind nor who was proud,<br>     Nor what more than aught else men cried aloud,<br>       Nor where his neighbour's power stretched its span.<br>  <br>  One moonlight night I swam the tide across,<br>  Met the great wave in the middle, saw it toss,<br>       Tossed a long bowshot in its boiling surge,<br>     Fought till the flood could know its master there,<br>     Swam, bold, to the further bank, for earth and air,<br>       And saw her standing silent on the verge.<br>  <br>  The moon played on her head, and yellow hair<br>  Flowed to her waist with never let or care;<br>       White dress, white arms, shone in the mystic light,<br>     Pale cheeks, and lips compressed, were desolate:<br>     She seemed a spirit wandered forth by fate,<br>       To give a pallid soul to the dead night.<br>  <br>                                3<br> <br>  She looked toward the moon; and, stooping down,<br>       Reached backward without gazing, from the sward<br>       Plucking three strange leaves, and with a careful ward<br>  Knotted them fast enfolded in her gown;<br>     Nor ever looked but straitly at the moon,<br>     And murmured weary words to strange sad tune: -- <br>  <br>          "Listen maid, listen man,<br>          Catch bubble who catch can,<br>          Surge tide, river glide;<br>          Merge bush, shiver rush:<br>     Watch, fair lady of the skies!<br>     Look me, look me in the eyes;<br>     You shall not see me pick your prize."<br>  <br>  I knew not if she were of fairy birth,<br>       But knew that she was fair, as never yet<br>       Has man known and been able to forget.<br>  I knew not were she slight or honest worth;<br>     But knew that how so e'er I lived on earth,<br>     For how so many years, without her it was dearth.<br>  <br>  And stepping forth beside her on the dew,<br>       I said, "The night is lonely in this place,<br>       The moon is poor protection for your grace;<br>  The wolves are fierce, and those that dare them few:<br>     Till you find safer guardian I will stand<br>     Beside you; strong or weak, to your command."<br>  <br>                                4<br> <br>  And so I turned, proud of my youth and might,<br>  Of skill and courage -- for, whate'er the fight,<br>       The swift eye and the swiftly-reasoning brain,<br>     Knowing when best to give, and when to take,<br>     And vantage out of direst chance to make,<br>       Laughs at the strength that rives an oak in twain; -- <br>  <br>  Proud of my power, shamed of my nakedness;<br>  Nor caring what this maid with golden tress<br>       Thought of my sudden speech. For she was mine,<br>     I cared not how so great her pride or power,<br>     Nor did her lips smile or her forehead lower,<br>       Or tears or fire beneath her eyelids shine.<br>  <br>  Proud of my power, I knew her ever mine,<br>  Willing or unwilling; so the sun should shine<br>       The morrow, or the winter bring us snow.<br>     Strength must bow down to greater strength; and none,<br>     My proud youth told me, breathed our Western sun<br>       Woman or man, my subtle force could know.<br>  <br>                                5<br> <br>  Turned she, a-rustle in the dewy grass: --<br>       "Strange things, methinks, are come abroad to-night,<br>       When a poor stripling deems my heart in fright<br>  For wolves, that every woodland hind would pass<br>       And send them snarling back. Yet wolves, fair boy,<br>       Perchance the more than you such meeting would enjoy!"<br>  <br>       With that she raised her white arms in the wind,<br>  And waving cried aloud. By lonely mere,<br>     When the night sleep is deep, somewhiles a sound,<br>     Unearthly and unheavenly, fills the round<br>  Of the starred sky, and earth is filled with fear:<br>     Such sounds she sent through moonlight and through shade,<br>     Waving her white arms toward the forest glade;<br>       And my heart beat beside her, fragrant-skinned.<br>  <br>  Three times she called, once to the moony South,<br>       Once to the mountain woods; and once she turned,<br>       And where the North Star by his chariot burned,<br>  Once more that strange wail came from that curved mouth:<br>     And my arms ached her filmy weight to bear,<br>     And in my blood was tangling all her golden hair.<br>  <br>                                6<br> <br>  But from the South there came an answering cry<br>  I knew ere yet it ceased. For that reply<br>       I heard when with my cousins we had found<br>     A she-wolf in her lair, and on a fire<br>     Had tied the dam to burn out her desire<br>       For human flesh, and on the gory ground<br>  <br>  Had killed her cubs before her. Then that sound<br>  Had answered the last cry of that sad mother bound;<br>       And cousins stout cared not to stay and see<br>     What cheer her spouse should give them; so they ran<br>     To where were fire and walls and home of man --<br>       I last -- and to my home his foot-tracks followed me.<br>  <br>  And from the West there came the fearful wail,<br>  That ever made men's faces change and pale,<br>       Of the old were-wolf of the woods; that through the dark<br>     Howled when a man should die. And North again<br>     A she-wolf screamed like a dead soul in pain: -- <br>       They cried there was a man soon to lie stiff and stark.<br>  <br>                                7<br> <br>  Once, twice, and thrice they cried; and every cry<br>  Nearer and nearer; and with moonlit eye<br>       She smiled upon me, mocking. I knew well<br>     That all in arms I could not fight these foes;<br>     High to the danger still my courage rose,<br>       Nor, naked, owned their cries my funeral knell.<br>  <br>  I seized her swiftly up from where she stood,<br>  To bear her with me to the angry flood,<br>       There swim for life or death; face to my face,<br>     Heart to my heart, breath panting with my breath;<br>     To live if I could live, die with my death,<br>       And rot with me in one last long embrace.<br>  <br>  "Boy," she laughed, "art afraid of these my friends?<br>  The river but some cowardly mankin sends,<br>       Who dares not face the forest! Stand your ground:<br>     I promise you shall have no cause for fear!<br>     These are my friends whom I have summoned here,<br>       To do my pleasure fond, to do my bidding bound."<br>  <br>                                8<br> <br>  "Seal thou thy promise with a kiss!" I cried.<br>  She kissed; -- and in my ears murmured the tide,<br>       And in her eyes the moon and stars were pent,<br>     And in her lips were past and future bliss,<br>     All life, all thought, sunk in one burning kiss:<br>       Stars, earth and heaven, in her eyes were blent --<br>  <br>  And round the wolves were seated. Panting tongue,<br>  Sharp teeth in cruel jaw, that hungry hung<br>       Under the gleaming eyes; and all the air<br>     Was noisome with their scent. The three that cried<br>     Were foremost; and sat watching, side by side, <br>       Where first from my young limbs the flesh to tear.<br>  <br>  Dark shadows stretched behind them with strange stars<br>  That came and went, as o'er the harbour bars<br>       The shipman sees the lantern on the shore.<br>     Dark shadows clustered round upon the grass,<br>     And backward, forward, would a shadow pass;<br>       And ever drew they nearer, ever more.<br>  <br>                                9<br> <br>  We stood, and I stood foremost; till the breath<br>       Of him from the South whose vixen I had slain,<br>       Fanned warm on my cold limbs, and a thick rain<br>  Slavered from both those jaws of fearsome death;<br>     And his coat bristled o'er in lustful hate,<br>     Big with revenge, and hunger, and my fate.<br>  <br>  Yet she behind me gave a silvery laugh, <br>       Like streamlet on the mountain, rippling clear,<br>       When first it strikes the tired hunter's ear,<br>  Who turns from summer's hear its rill to quaff.<br>     Low answered from the pack in fear and dread<br>     A whine of horror; and uneasy stirred each shadowy head.<br>  <br>  She struck her little hand across his ears --<br>       "Down, rascal! hast no manners for my friend?<br>       Kiss, dog, where I have kissed." -- I saw him bend,<br>  I felt his mouth drip hot and hungry tears<br>     Over my feet; and then from foot to head<br>     He slavered me -- whose cubs I had laid dead --<br>     With teeth, and shining eyes, and hair bristling in hate and dread.<br>  <br>                                10<br> <br>  Ever there rang the silvery laugh behind,<br>  And the eyes of the shadows moved; a single mind<br>       Seemed to grow into the twining shapeless crowd,<br>     As they closed together, and closer; poised on their feet,<br>     As those who wait to know the moment is meet --<br>       On a sudden the were-wolf rose and howled aloud --<br>  <br>  And away to the South were a cloud of galloping backs,<br>  Old dog, were-wolf, and the vixen leading the packs;<br>       And up the stars rose laughter, awful and shrill:<br>     She and I were alone.  Her parted mouth<br>     Shrilled, mocking, to the skies; and away to the South<br>       I saw a rushlight burn in the village under the hill.<br>  <br>  O then I turned to her, and I held my eyes<br>  Proud, gazing where I saw her eyelids rise:<br>       "Now, know you; wolves or fiends, I fear them nought;<br>     But I will take what heart is in your breast,<br>     And I will make you follow my behest,<br>       Natheless for all the spells that e'er were wrought!"<br>  <br>                                11<br> <br>  Her white hands touched my face. "Poor, gentle boy,<br>       And have you not enough of Yberha's grace?<br>       Were you not sated with the wolf's embrace,<br>  That you would know my lips as little coy?<br>     Would you court a bride who can cast a shade on the sun,<br>     And will watch the soul in its flight when the rushlight yonder is done?<br>  <br>  "I love not ever my father; who reads strange scrolls<br>       Of how the world shall be happy, and men be kind,<br>       And great ones from their slaves their chains unbind,<br>  And lowly men be great. I take his rolls<br>     And read on the other side, of power and pride;<br>     Who weds must win them for me, whatsoe'er betide.<br>  <br>  "Swim home and dream in peace. Not yours to turn<br>       The forces of the stars out from the sky,<br>       And wield them; while the men fall down and die<br>  Where'er your finger points, and the worlds burn,<br>     And horror fills your soul with horror's depth and height,<br>     And round about you press the forces of the night.<br>  <br>                                12<br> <br>  "Boy, dare you hold unceasing, endless pain<br>  Thralled in your hand? when a shiver or a stain<br>       Of fear across your mind would loose it there,<br>     And in one flood would roll over your brain <br>     One blank of that unceasing endless pain,<br>       And agony relentless, and unperishing despair.<br>  <br>  "Dare you walk forth on lone eternal hills,<br>  And know beside you lone eternal wills,<br>       Bend them, unwilling, to tear up the earth,<br>     To whirl the heavens backward, heap the sea,<br>     Cast night on noonday, set the Zodiac free.<br>       And curse a newborn life before its birth?<br>  <br>  "Swim home and dream in peace: and woo some girl<br>  Whose charms are blush of cheek, and waft of curl;<br>       And give her then this kiss." I clasped her form,<br>     White-robed and slim: "I woo no other maid;<br>     I fear not death or pain, nor the cold shade <br>       Of loneliness. Rage all your fiery storm.<br>  <br>                                13<br> <br>  "Thus I will hold you! And in death or pain,<br>       Victor or vanquished, till your bosom's snow<br>       Melt in my heart, I will not let you go:<br>  I will not live away from you again;<br>     I am more strong than you with all your might,<br>     And all your beauty is my proper right!"<br>  <br>  Still there she stood, clasped closely, dreamingly,<br>       With moonlit eyes and dewy marble cheek,<br>       Lips moving not to kiss me or to speak;<br>  Still there she stood, clasped closely, dreamingly.<br>     Her eyes shone in the darkness, as the light <br>     That leads forth wanderers, far, far into the night.<br>  <br>  Rested her white hand on my hungry arm:<br>       "And I have been alone; alone," she said;<br>       "I thought to go alone among the dead,<br>  And lonely guide them with an awful charm.<br>     I thought alone to turn the weak world's length;<br>     I knew not that a man had such a strength.<br>  <br>                                14<br> <br>  "Fold round your arms more closely. How your lip<br>  Is cold, and night-dews from your eyelids drip!<br>       Fold closely. Now I know that life can give<br>     Something more sweet than power, yet more sweet<br>     Than cruelty. Do our hearts together beat?<br>       To be in lonely strength is not to live.<br>  <br>  "Kiss not so close, for I would speak awhile:<br>  Know, love, that I must wander many a mile<br>       'Twixt now and day. Know, I can never wed,<br>     Save with death to my lover, but a man<br>     Who knows my every spell to bless or ban;<br>       Unless I lay all down beside my marriage bed.<br>  <br>  "Which will you: wed me as a powerless maid, <br>  Of night, and wolves, and warlock word afraid;<br>       Or wait till my high art yourself have learned?"<br>     I cried -- "I wed no weakling for my bride!<br>     Ride we this rotten world, whate'er betide:<br>       I kiss you on it." -- And her lips like fire burned.<br>  <br>                       SECOND PART<br> <br>                                15<br> <br>  S o three long years I toiled by night and day<br>  To learn her spells. The meteors at play<br>  Cried round us as we sat upon the hills,<br>  The lightning flowed in lucid gentle rills<br>  To bathe her feet; and strange tongues spake anon<br>  Thundering, and red streamers through the welkin shone.<br>  <br>  Sometime we pored o'er mystic written signs<br>  Tangled with pictured horrors, wrapt designs<br>  That first were stains of blood upon the page,<br>  And then were men, writhing in pain and rage,<br>  And then shone forth a face in hate and fear,<br>  And grew, until the eyeballs stared as near<br>  <br>  As beat her heart to mine. And as we gazed <br>  Sense became dim, and sight and thought amazed:<br>  The walls fell back from out that narrow room,<br>  The world lay wide before us in its gloom,<br>  Strange swift things sped on wings of livid light,<br>  And round about us closed the forces of the night.<br>  <br>                                16<br> <br>  Sometime from out the shadows of the grave<br>  We called the old Fenickian; who, when wave<br>  Curled o'er his ship to sink it in the deep,<br>  Bade there its mountainous waters hang, asleep<br>  (And still men show it, from the quiet sea<br>  A long white rock, o'erhanging treacherously):<br>  <br>  And he would teach us how in Orient land<br>  Great toiling sprites weave cables from the sand;<br>  And he that holds them may chain back the hours<br>  Till his proud life, in ever-waxing powers,<br>  Stretch on a thousand years, and time is tired,<br>  And all lies in his hand that ever he desired:<br>  <br>  And how within the bowels of the earth<br>  A fiery race awaits its coming birth,<br>  And they that master mighty spells have care<br>  To say nought that shall break their fetters there;<br>  Else all our world should vanish in a breath,<br>  One fierce and fearsome flame, and long eternal death.<br>  <br>                                17<br> <br>  And sometime we would pass into the skies<br>  Till the near stars gleamed hotly in her eyes;<br>  And we would look behind the Milky Veil <br>  Where watch the drowsy fates, weary and pale,<br>  Till planets cease to rule. And we would fall<br>  Downward to the abyss from whence the thunders call;<br>  <br>  And there were monstrous, mountainous, cloudy forms,<br>  Whose eyes were lightnings, and whose breaths were storms;<br>  Writhing and twisting through the unbounded deep,<br>  Now strove they at their chains, and now would sleep:<br>  When they be loosed the mountains pass to air,<br>  And all the solid earth to windy, dark despair.<br>  <br>  And sometime would we sit beneath the trees;<br>       And I would kiss the blushes to her face,<br>       And wind her hair in many a wandering grace,<br>  And set it flowing to the evening breeze;<br>     And bury her with flowers, scenting of spring,<br>     And hear the white-barred winter-finch his love-bell ring.<br>  <br>                       THIRD PART<br> <br>                                18<br> <br>  A nd so there went three years: and I was grown<br>       Stronger than she, more daring in my spells,<br>       Calling the spirits of the rugged fells<br>  As shepherd calls his dogs. Our troth was known;<br>     Merlin would wed Yberha of the Mount,<br>     Child of the silent man men held of small account.<br>  <br>  Yet never had he yielded to our troth,<br>       Nor ever took her dower at my hand;<br>       But called me wastrel of an ill-lived land,<br>  Profitless in labour, diligent in sloth,<br>     No husband for his daughter; but a curse<br>     To make good bad in her, and make bad worse.<br>  <br>  That time the foe came on us. Fiery light<br>       Shone forth from every hill-top, and all day<br>       Men drove their women and their herds away,<br>  And digged to wall about them all the night.<br>     About Yberha's tower they digged the wall;<br>     Yon moody man was leader of them all.<br>  <br>                                19<br> <br>  And from the sacred places came a chant<br>       From daybreak to nightfall; and fierce-eyed priests<br>       Tore from the rout the best of all the beasts,<br>  Made ox and sheep up the long stoneway pant,<br>     Till all the altars, set in crimson mire,<br>     Clouded the sky with smoke and marred the night with fire.<br>  <br>  <hr>  <br>                  THE PRAYER OF THE PRIESTS<br> <br>  Great mountains, hear us!<br>       Hear us, who deck in flowers your granite brows<br>       And fill your cups with blood.<br>  <br>  Great river, hear us!<br>       Hear us, who pour our offerings on the wave,<br>       Whose fairest in thy bosom have their grave.<br>  <br>  Sun, hear us!<br>       We give the best our bitter life allows<br>       To thee, giver of good.<br>  <br>  Gods of the forest, hear us!<br>       Red drip the branches of your sacred trees:<br>  What other gods there be, O hear us!<br>       And scent our offerings on the evening breeze.<br>  <br>       Round, round<br>           We march in mystic rite;<br>       Sound, sound<br>           The trumpets to the Night:<br>          She is coming from the east,<br>          And the sacrifice, O priest,<br>            Is alight.<br>  <br>  Priest of the dawn,<br>       Is there help?<br>  Priest of the rocks,<br>       Is there help?<br>  Priest of the flood,<br>  Priest of the wood,<br>       Is there help?<br>  <br>       Round, round<br>          We march in mystic rite;<br>       Sound, sound<br>           The trumpets to the Night:<br>          Take our foes, dying deep;<br>          But we worship thee -- <br>            Let us sleep.<br>  <br>  Priest of the Night,<br>       Is there help?<br>  <br>  <hr>  <br>  Yet nearer closed the foe: the holy seers<br>       Had fled to the holy woods, to pray anew<br>       In secret caverns where they held the clew;<br>  Our tower rang with lowings, moans, and cheers;<br>     The strangers were encamped against the wall;<br>     That, and the moody man, became the hope of all.<br>  <br>  Three days they sieged about us; till at length<br>       We penned the cattle and women in the tower,<br>       Massed to their weaker wing in all our power,<br>  And rushed to measure with the foe our strength:<br>     Foremost of all Yberha's father there;<br>     An axe made like a cross he brandished in the air.<br>  <br>                                20<br> <br>  Bloodily waged the battle. I was light<br>  Of spear and swift of foot, and through the fight<br>       Passed like a wandering death. With heavy blows<br>     Of axe on target, edgéd stone on hide,<br>     My cousins fought in phalanx, side by side;<br>       And over all the voice of Yberha's father rose:<br>  <br>  "Strike for your children! Strike for love and wife!<br>  Strike for the kindly land that gave you life!<br>       -- O Thou that rulest lives and ways of men,<br>     Save this poor ignorant people to new days<br>     That thus a thankful land thy grace repays."<br>  And he struck with the two-edged axe, and cried, "Amen."<br>  <br>  But we were few, and I saw Yberha's head at the tower,<br>  And I drew forth, to weave a spell of power<br>       With her for conquest. Waving hand with hand,<br>     She on the tower, I back from out the fight,<br>     We read a twisted spell of potent might<br>       Pointing to where the crossed axe made a stand; -- <br>  <br>                                21<br> <br>  When all of a sudden the cross flew back as he smote,<br>  Slipping his grasp, and struck me down in the moat,<br>       I rose with courage strangely faint, a cry<br>     Rang from the foe; my cousins side by side<br>     Took blows of axe and spear on the stout bull-hide:<br>       Yberha's father was down, and our men began to fly.<br>  <br>  From out the tower whispered a light footfall, <br>  Where shone my beauty, cold, and white, and tall;<br>       I leapt quick-hearted o'er our fenceless bank,<br>     Crying, "Come, sweetheart! speed we to the wood;<br>     Thy sire is dead: none other ever stood<br>       To foil our marriage; foiléd spells we well may thank!"<br>  <br>  Cold stood she, white and tall. From out the fight<br>  Our men were rallying back upon the right.<br>       She spake: "Take up thy spear and lead the men,<br>     Nor think of spells or love. Sweep back yon foe,<br>     Or never word thine ear from me shall know:<br>       When they are conquered, ask me further then."<br>  <br>                                22<br> <br>  Dizzy I turned me, and with waving spear<br>       Called on my men and fell into the press;<br>       Naught knew I but to long for her caress,<br>  And for her safety to be sick with fear:<br>     Still with skilled arm I thrust, and thrust again,<br>     And into the hot foe we fought out way amain.<br>  <br>  And as the sun was setting, down the hill<br>       We pressed them; and my wing the more and more<br>       Forced them, retreating, to the river shore,<br>  Until they turned to flee, and we to kill:<br>     But where my cousins stood, stubborn and loud,<br>     The battle waged like thunder in a thundercloud.<br>  <br>  At length there too the foe broke; turned and fled,<br>       Scattering toward the river, and we ran<br>       To slay; but my huge cousin, once began<br>  The cloud to break, turned back among the dead,<br>     And I cried wrathful words; but there they stood,<br>     While half stricken foe escaped into the flood.<br>  <br>                                23<br> <br>  We slew till all were fled, or bound, or slain,<br>  Then turned triumphing to the tower again.<br>       The women busily sped to and fro<br>     Helping the wounded; or with bitter wail<br>     Pressed lip to cheek that sundown-light left pale;<br>       Or vainly, sadly, searched their dead to know.<br>  <br>  I was unwounded. Youth, and skill of fence,<br>  And fearless coolness, and a delicate sense<br>       Of where a man was weakest, kept my head;<br>     And so, afront of all my lagging men, <br>     I mounted lightly from the bloody glen,<br>       And walked to meet my love among the dead. <br>  <br>  A dark group stood within our earthen mound;<br>  A body, and my cousins pressing round;<br>  And she, white-robed, the nearest. Lightly treading,<br>  As one that walks from waiting unto wedding,<br>  I came behind her; and, ere I could speak,<br>  Had touched her glossy hair, and kissed her cheek.<br>  <br>                                24<br> <br>  Like adder coiled about her threatened young,<br>  With head thrown back, and swift death-dealing tongue,<br>       Turning, she spake: -- "Smooth coward! whole of skin,<br>     You have come well forth from all this bitter strife,<br>     And saved, at least, one traitorous, worthless life --<br>       Maid's body, with a weasel's heart within!<br>  <br>  "There lies my father, stricken by your guile.<br>  You faced him not to kill him; but, with wile<br>       Evil and secret, struck him out of sight,<br>     Spelling I know not what of fatal ban.<br>     You could lay low a fearless, trustful man,<br>       Foremost and strongest in his people's fight<br>  <br>  "I wed you? Wed me rather to the raven,<br>  Gorged with yon bravest blood, than to a craven."<br>       With that she faced the rest, and, bowing head --<br>     "I have been wild and foolish as a maid,<br>     And tried to learn strange arts, proud not to be afraid:<br>       For ever now I lay them by," she said.<br>  <br>                                25<br> <br>  "Worthless they were, worthless I know are those<br>  Who seek out all the thorns whereon the rose<br>       Of our fair life, by sun and showers fed,<br>     Blossoms in love and truth. Crook'd thorns there be;<br>     And strange imaginings those that seek them see:<br>       Methinks the most of them are false," she said.<br>  <br>  "An honest man, with strong and brave right arm<br>  To keep a loving woman from all harm,<br>       Seeing at night a glowing ingle-bed<br>     With laughing, dark-haired children, clear of eye,<br>     Fearlessly helpless, smiling trustfully; --<br>       Stronger are these than charms or spells," she said.<br>  <br>  "Friends, I was wrong; this day I have seen clear<br>  That such things are but vain; be witness here;<br>       I tell, who know. My days that be unsped<br>     Henceforth I strive -- and what I strive I can -- <br>     To live a woman, as my sire a man,<br>       Worthy of love from man and child," she said. <br>  <br>                                26<br> <br>  "This thing that fed my follies, in my blindness<br>       I thought to marry; but my father wise,<br>       Seeing my madness with a father's eyes,<br>  Dissuaded, vainly, gently, with a father's kindness.<br>     -- Foolish or false, my strange arts this man shared:<br>     Traitor in them, his black heart he has bared;<br>  <br>  "I leave him, and for ever." Such mad words --<br>  More mad, more fierce than memory affords<br>       To utter rightly, -- with proud head back thrown,<br>     She uttered; in some glamour, as I thought,<br>     That made her to the bold day I had fought<br>       Blind, and forgetful of our magic throne;<br>  <br>  I deemed that it would pass. And cousin stout<br>  Stood forth and said, "Fair lady, in yon rout<br>       Young Merlin led the van, no traitor he.<br>     Of star-work tricks I know not; but you twain<br>     Foolish and young, grow not so young again:<br>       Marry him, maid! he made our foes to flee."<br>  <br>                                27<br> <br>  So his two brothers dropped axe-handle down<br>  Upon the ground; and, nodding with wise frown,<br>       Said, "Aye, the chief is right; he led the van:<br>     Marry him, lady, 'tis a fightsome lad!"<br>     And one said, "Lady, be not all so sad;<br>       Your father breathes, perchance not sped his span."<br>  <br>  But she looked on the corse despairingly:<br>  And one said to me, "Lad, 'twere better see<br>       This is no time for wooing. On the morrow<br>     She will forget these strange things she has said<br>     Of all your love-games. Leave her with her dead;<br>       You must not woo a maiden in her sorrow."<br>  <br>  Then looked she on my cousin. Big and tired<br>  He stood, his eye no more with battle fired,<br>       His face astreak with blood. One ugly gash<br>     Left half his forehead hanging; his right hand<br>     Swung powerless, broke at the elbow. Brown and tanned,<br>       You saw him pale in the lips, and all his eyes with blood asplash.<br>  <br>                                28<br> <br>  "Friend, you bestrode, untrod, my father's corse<br>       From afternoon till evening. Brave in fight<br>       I knew you; true to what you know is right<br>  I find you: strong and true. For better or worse<br>     I here do vow me yours. So you me wed<br>     I will be faithful wife, or know no marriage-bed."<br>  <br>  Silence held us, all still. She knelt aground,<br>       And took his miry, bloodstained hand, and raised<br>       That ox-hoof to her honeyed lips. Amazed,<br>  I poised my spear; but the brothers held me round. <br>     Stupid, but not unkindly louts, they bore<br>     Me, mad with rage, to a coracle on the shore.<br>  <br>  And one came with me, sculling where we knew<br>       Safe cave of refuge. There he stayed with me,<br>       Lying to watch the water from the sea<br>  Behind the islet where the willow grew;<br>     And there we stayed a week beside the shore,<br>     And to this day I never saw her more.<br>  <br>                                29<br> <br>  For he sailed me down the river, and set me forth<br>  With the fisher-folk that knew us not of the North;<br>  And I flung a stone on his boat as he sailed away<br>  That sank him there, and the tide swept into the bay;<br>  And none knew ever a man had come with me,<br>  Nor boat, nor whence I came, of earth or sky or sea.<br>  <br>  I chose me a cave where a wolf had made his den,<br>  And drave them forth with a stick: the people feared me then.<br>       I lived as the wise men live in Orient lands;<br>     I made strange spells in the night, and spell on spell<br>     I learned, till all the world obeyed me well;<br>       And one, with weaving paces and with waving hands,<br>  <br>  You wot of, I made then; and spelled those twain,<br>  Her and her sotted lover, that again<br>       They ne'er should love, but see me ever there --<br>     But see me ever betwixt closéd walls,<br>     Whether, without, sun rises or dew falls,<br>       Ever in hate, and ever in despair.<br>  <br>                                30<br> <br>  And I live on in power, power of men,<br>       To wield their kings and councils, and to wield<br>       Their herd-like armies on the battle field,<br>  And power o'er all that is beyond their ken.<br>     And yet, sometimes, when I see the moon in the south, <br>     Methinks I feel warm lips upon my mouth.<br>  <br>  <br> <br>  <br> <br>  <br>
