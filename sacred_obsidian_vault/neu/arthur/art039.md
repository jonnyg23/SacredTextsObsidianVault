Morgana, or Morgaine le fay, was half-sister to King Arthur.  She was a powerful enchantress, scarcely inferior to the <i> Lady of the Lake</i>  herself, but otherwise a lady of a very indifferent character, "born of fire and lasciviousness," as Merlin more correctly than courteously describes her.  In the present instance, however, it must be stated in mitigation of her offence, that in laying a trap for the virtue of her sister-in-law, she was but repaying Queen Guinevere in kind.  For we learn from the Table-Round Romances, that on a former occasion the Queen had maliciously conducted Arthur to Morgana's bower, at a critical conjuncture in a love-tryste, similar to that into which she here inveigles Launcelot and Guinevere.<br>  <br> <br>
