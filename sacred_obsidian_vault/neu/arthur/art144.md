 <p> </p>    
 <p> <br>                                     I. <br>      <br>      Three sailors pass, by the Water-gate,<br>      And sing of Merlin, as it grows late.<br>      Last night they sailed the Irish Sea,<br>      The bitter sea, in a wild twilight,<br>      Where its tide swims north to Enlli strait.<br>      From the Water-gate to Merlin's Tree,--<br>      They sing to-night<br>      Of Merlin's death and Annwn's might.<br>    </p>     
 <p> <br>                                   II. <br>    <br>    To-night, oh Towy, from the seas,<br>    We saw their mast o'ertop thy trees,<br>    The tow rope swayed their top-mast tall;<br>    While the wind whipt the rain like a tarrying team,<br>    And the spent leaves speckled thy serpent stream:<br>    Thro' the sleepy town, what songs are these<br>    They sing, till they reach the Spital wall,<br>    And break the dream of Morial? </p>  <div align="left">                   <br>                                                  III. <br>    <br>                       <i> SAILORS'    SONG.</i> <br>    <br>    <i>    'Marvellous Merlin is wasted away<br>       With a wicked woman:--woe might she be!<br>       For she hath closed him in a crag<br>                   On    Cornwall coast.'</i>  </div>  <div align="left">     
 <p align="left"> <br>                                           IV. <br>      <br>      'A fair sea-tale! What woman could,<br>      With all the red witchery of her blood,<br>      Enchant the Enchanter that is lost?<br>      Her maiden mystery,' Morial said,<br>      'Was Nimua's art, in Merlin's mood.<br>      What iron crag of Cornwall coast,<br>      What cleft of fierce Tintagil's head,<br>      Keeps him that like a flower all Carnac sunward spread?'</p>    
 <p> <br>      <br>                   II.--THE      SECOND SEA-RUMOUR.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    I. <br>      <br>      Deep, deep is the night, the street deserted:<br>      One house alone wakes broken-hearted:<br>      A candle winks in the window-pane.<br>      The children wake and cry within<br>      At the thing that never yet tear averted.<br>      As the monk sains the dead, another strain<br>      From the quay below, brings the sailor's din<br>      And tells some belated ship is in!<br>    </p>    
 <p> <br>                                    II. <br>      <br>      'Yo ho, yo he!' a hearty sound:<br>      But their barque has gotten a sore sea-wound.<br>      Her master hastens from the quay;<br>      At the Spital gate, now hear him knock,<br>      And hum to himself, while on the ground<br>      From his fierce red-beard, and his stained sea-frock,<br>      The salt sea-fret continually<br>      Drops as he drones his sea-mystery.<br>                                   </p>    
 <p>                                         III.     </p>  </div>  <div align="left"> <i>                SHIPMASTER'S    SONG.<br>    <br>       Marvellous Merlin is wafted away<br>       In a sailing island, a ship of glass;<br>       Far over the edge of the world he's blown<br>                  By    Annwn's blast.</i> </div>  <div align="left">    
 <p> <br>                                    IV. <br>      <br>      His voice fell as he sang, forlorn<br>      As a voice o'er the drown'd five cities borne:<br>      To a mariner on the winter sea:<br>      And the monk that came from the dead-chamber,<br>      With thought of death, grew sad to hear:<br>      And sad his 'Benedicite?'<br>      [Twas Morial spoke], as he turned the key.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    V. <br>      <br>      The wet night wind went whistling through<br>      The wicket as he swung it to,<br>      And the lantern gaped at the red sea-beard.<br>      'From demons save my soul,' began<br>      The Shipmaster: 'Hark ye, it blew<br>      The blackest blast that ever I knew,<br>      Under Enlli Isle: and we fell afeard,<br>      For the Isle was adrift, and we barely cleared.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    VI. <br>      <br>      'Like a ship of glass as white as milk,<br>      With mast of ebon and shroud of silk,<br>      She sailed away. But see in black<br>      Stands Merlin midships, round his head<br>      A ring of white-fire,--while the rack<br>      Screams by o'erhead: and the long-drown'd dead<br>      Stand up to see. But he never looks back:<br>      Tho' the hounds of Annwn are on his track.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    VII. <br>      <br>      'Oh, the dead cried out, and the sea-worms leapt,<br>      For her keel drag'd fathom deep, and swept<br>      Gulfs dark with demons in her wake!<br>      And they sea-witched us, me and my men,<br>      Till we drank the salt, and never slept,<br>      And for many a moon beat the sea, and then,<br>      Came home, came home! Good Morial, take<br>      Off Satan's curse for Christ His sake!'</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    VIII. <br>      <br>      Next noon, see, on the sunn'd ebbtide,<br>      His ship sails trim from Towy side,<br>      And the sailors sing: but Morial<br>      Thinks of the dead last night, and deems<br>      That Merlin lies indeed where glide<br>      Those snakes that demons are. His dreams<br>      Make pale moon-paintings on his wall;<br>      Where the drowned sink, saying,--'Death is all!'</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    IX. <br>      <br>      Oh, then to all else Morial died,<br>      Save scroll and desk, and wall beside:<br>      For Merlin's history let him write!<br>      The Abbot said, and nothing hide:<br>      But year by year the thread unwind<br>      Of Merlin's mystery from his mind;<br>      From demon birth, thro' sin and sleight,<br>      To the dark sea-death in the drifting night.</p>    
 <p> <br>      <br>                   III.--MORIAL'S      DEATH-DREAM.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    I. <br>      <br>      Now Calan Gauav again draws on,<br>      And many a marching year is gone:<br>      And yet, as thirty years before,<br>      His faith thrice-slain, writes Morial.<br>      He hardly marks the one year more;<br>      The winter dusk stand at the door;<br>      The winter wind sigh in the wall;<br>      The winter leaves by the window fall.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    II. <br>      <br>      To-night there should have been a moon:<br>      But it rained hard all afternoon,<br>      And chill the early twilight fell,<br>      O'er Merlin's death he bent his head,<br>      To tell the end: 'Now from Annwn,<br>      The demons call;' he writes, 'the bell<br>      [And never a mass for Merlin said,]<br>      Rings thrice in Enlli for the dead!'</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    III. <br>      <br>      With every word he writes, he dies;<br>      The historian with his histories.<br>      The parchment paled as now the pen<br>      With failing charactry made pause<br>      O'er Merlin's demon-obsequies,<br>      Too monstrous to be told of men:<br>      Thrice dead is all that Merlin was:--<br>      'MERLINUS MORTUUS: DEO LAUS!'</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    IV. <br>      <br>      His heart slept there: but sure the gloom<br>      Hid one that spoke within the room,<br>      A face that grew on the grey wall,<br>      And seemed to speak, and fade again<br>      'Beneath Galltvyrthen is my tomb,<br>      Where now the rain drips, Morial:<br>      But I hear the stars at their ancient strain:<br>      And it needs you come where I have lain.'</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    V. <br>      <br>      He knew that voice, that tone of fate;<br>      And cried, 'I come!' The Spital gate<br>      Creak'd as he passed. The wind made spears<br>      Of the shattered rain: his pulses leapt<br>      To feel them fall: his heart grew great<br>      With every gust: his only fears,<br>      To feel how frail the pace he kept;<br>      To feel how slow his stiff feet stept.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    VI.<br>       <br>      By Towy's tide, o'er Gwili's flood--<br>      Now Morial gains Galltvyrthen wood.<br>      In the heart of the wood the wind lay still;<br>      The moon in the trees lit a silver lamp;<br>      And Morial saw where the Nine Oaks stood<br>      About the grave-stone under the hill,<br>      That rose from the mould and the dead-leaf-damp,<br>      In the twilight of the moon's white lamp.</p>    
 <p> <br>                   IV.--THE      WAKING OF MERLIN.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    I. <br>      <br>      'Merlin!' he cried. Like nine grey men,<br>      The oaks, he thought, moved nearer then<br>      The door of death, whose mysteries<br>      Gave way at the clay's rebirth;<br>      As shaking off the grave again,<br>      With all his smouldering fervencies<br>      Regathered from his mother Earth,<br>      Her Marvellous Son stood forth.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    II. <br>      <br>      But first, half-risen from the clay,<br>      'Marw a garav,' he seemed to say--<br>      'Marw Mordav'--'Since Mordav's dead,<br>      I want to die!' So long ago,<br>      He cried on dread Arderyd's day,<br>      Thought Morial,--and in his bed<br>      Of death, that crimson stream of woe<br>      Seemed thro' his dream to flow and flow.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    III. <br>      <br>      'Crist Celi' next he cries, with hands<br>      Heaved trembling up, and forthright stands:<br>      And surely now the nine Oak-trees<br>      Stand, nine grey Druids, robed in white,<br>      Armed with the smoking bardic brands,<br>      And hymn the Eternal Three Essences,<br>      And weave the rune of the crescent Light,<br>      Whose dawn-fire breaks on Merlin's night.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    IV. <br>      <br>                         <i> DRUIDS'      SONG.</i> <br>      <br>      <i> Marvellous Merlin's awake with the day:<br>      The Morning Star calls the Dawn from the hill:<br>      The Flame wakes again on the ash of thy brands,<br>                   Oh      sacred hearth!<br>      <br>      Wild Merlin's awake. The Sun's on his way;<br>      Where the Elements heard the harp of the Stars,<br>      That Darkness let shine, as Death does thy Life,<br>                   Oh      Cymraec Land!</i> </p>    
 <p> <br>                                    V. <br>      <br>      Their hymn was done. Their brands the smoke<br>      Sent branching up; and Merlin spoke:<br>      'The Soul aspires, past Night's last arch;<br>      Where they that stained Arderyd's dust,<br>      Cross, to the ardent fields of air;<br>      And make such music in their march,<br>      Their hearts forget the deadly thrust,<br>      Whose purple decks the robes they wear.</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    VI. <br>      <br>      'Now Morning, from Caer Cennen's steep,<br>      Comes marching,' Merlin cries, 'to keep<br>      Watch on the mountain fastnesses!<br>      Crying to all the Cymraec fields--<br>      Awake! Not long King Arthur's sleep<br>      Shall be, ere while the herd-boy sees<br>      The dawn that yields<br>      The cry of harps, the glancing of his shields!'</p>    
 <p> <br>                                    VII. <br>      <br>      So Morial heard, that might not write<br>      Nor add the morn to Merlin's night.<br>      That ends his mortal chronicle;<br>      And some say still, that many a one<br>      Read Annwn's mark, and dreadful might,<br>      In the dead face of Morial:<br>      There speaks the Night! The Night is done:<br>      And Marvellous Merlin's Day's begun. </p>  </div>
