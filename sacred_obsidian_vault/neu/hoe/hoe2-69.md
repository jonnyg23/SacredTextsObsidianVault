 <h2 align="center">THE CHURCH AT REVEL.</h2>
 
 <p>R<small>EVEL</small> was formerly an unimportant place, and the inhabitants wished to make it famous by building a church. They contracted with the great architect Olaf<a name="page_262_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_262_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> to erect it; and when it was completed, and he was about to fix the cross on the summit, his wife cried out joyfully, “Olaf will come home to-day with a thousand barrels of gold.”<a name="page_262_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_262_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> But scarcely had

 Olaf fixed the cross in its place, when he slipped and fell to the ground, and a toad and a snake sprang out of his mouth. The Devil wished to destroy the church, but could not get near it; so he made a sling at Pernau, and hurled a great rock at it. But the sling broke, and the rock fell half-way between Pernau and Revel, where it now remains. (Similar tales are related of the Devil in many countries, but are perhaps commonest in Scandinavia.)</p>

 <p><a name="page_262_note_2"></a><a href="#page_262_fr_2">2</a> This incident reminds us of the story of St. Olaf and the giant Wind and Weather (see Keightley’s <i>Fairy Mythology</i>, Bohn’s edition, 1860, p. 117), though here it is the giant church-builder who falls. According to one of the legends of Cologne Cathedral, the architect was hurled from the top of the unfinished building by the Devil. The calling of a person by name was often regarded by the Scandinavians as a death-omen.</p>
