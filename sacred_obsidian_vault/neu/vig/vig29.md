 <b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc29619173">CHAPTER XXVI</a></p>
 </font></b><p>EINAR now set the suit on foot afresh for the Althing, and both sides collected their people together, but before Glum left home he dreamt that many persons came to Thverà to visit the god Frey, and he thought he saw a great crowd on the sand-banks by the river, with Frey sitting on a chair. He dreamt that he asked who they were who had come thither, and they said, "We are thy departed kindred, and we are now begging Frey that thou mayst not be driven out of Thverà, but it is no use, for he answers shortly and angrily, and calls to mind now the gift of the ox by Thorkel the tall." At that point Glum woke up, and ever afterwards he professed that he was on worse terms with Frey.<br>
         Men rode to the Thing, and the suit was brought to a close in such a way that Glum admitted the killing of Thorvald; but his kinsmen and friends exerted themselves to secure the acceptance of a settlement rather than the imposition of outlawry or banishment. So they compounded the matter at the Thing, on the condition that Glum was to forfeit the land at Thverà, half absolutely as an atonement to Ketell, the son of Thorvald the crooked, and to convey the other half at a valuation; but he was allowed to live there till the spring, and was then to be outlawed in the district, and not to live nearer than in Hörgardal. So they left the Thing. Einar afterwards bought the land, as had been promised to him. In the spring his men came thither to work on the farm, and Einar told them that they should give an account to him of every word which Glum spoke. One day he came and talked with them on this wise, "It is easy to see that Einar has got good workmen about him; the work is well done on the land, and it is now of consequence that great and little matters should both be attended to. You would do well to put up posts here by the water side for drying clothes; it is convenient for the women washing the larger articles; the wells at home are indifferent."<br>
         When they got home Einar asked what Glum had said to them. They told him how careful he was with reference to all the work done. "Did it appear to you," said he, "that he was desirous of getting everything ready for my hands?" "Yes," they replied, "so we think." "Well," replied Einar, "I think differently. I think he meant very likely to hang you on these posts, or stick on them some insult to me. You must not go there, however."<br>
         Einar transferred his household to Thverà in the spring, but Glum remained where he was till the last day for moving,  <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">1</font></a> and when people were all ready to start he sat down on the high seat and did not move, although he was summoned to do so. He had the hall decorated with hangings, and refused to turn out like mere "cottage tenants." Hallbera, the daughter of Thorodd, the son of Hialm, was the mother of Gudmund and Einar, and lived at Hanakamb. She came to Thverà, and saluted Glum, saying, "Good morning to you, Glum, but you cannot stay here any longer. I have marked out the land of Thverà with fire, and I eject you and all yours formally from it, as made over to my son Einar."  <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">2</font></a> Then Glum rose up and told her she might chatter away like a miserable old woman as she was; but as he rode away he looked over his shoulder towards the homestead and sung a stanza--</p>
 <b></b><p align="CENTER">With sword and spear, as fame hath told,<br>
 Like many a gallant earl of old,<br>
 I won these lands by might and main.<br>
 But now the wielder of the brand<br>
 Has dashd at last from out his hand,<br>
 Broad lands and lordships lost again.</p>
 <p>Glum lived at Mödrufell, in Hörgardal, with Thorgrim Fiuk, but he was not content to remain there more than one winter. Then he dwelt two winters in Myrkárdal, but a landslip fell near the homestead and destroyed some of the buildings. After that he bought land at Thverbrek, in Öxnadal, and dwelt there as long as he lived, and became aged and blind.  <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

They began on the Thursday after the expiration of six weeks of summer, which was reckoned to begin on the Thursday between the 9th and 15th of April. They fell therefore about the beginning of June. See the Glossary to the Grágás, and Dasents Preface, p. liv.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_25"></a><a href="vig29.htm#fr_25">2</a> Maurer (s. 58) gives a translation of this curious passage, and remarks that it shows the hallowing of the land by fire as applicable not only to its first occupation, but also to a change of possession.</p>
