 CHAPTER XII
 
 How Galahad and Percivale found in a castle many tombs
 of maidens that had bled to death.
 
 
 NOW saith the story that all night Galahad and Percivale
 were in a chapel in their prayers, for to save Sir Bors.  So
 on the morrow they dressed them in their harness toward
 the castle, to wit what was fallen of them therein.  And
 when they came there they found neither man nor woman
 that he ne was dead by the vengeance of Our Lord.
 With that they heard a voice that said:  This vengeance
 is for blood-shedding of maidens.  Also they found at the
 end of the chapel a churchyard, and therein might they
 see a three score fair tombs, and that place was so fair and
 so delectable that it seemed them there had been none
 tempest, for there lay the bodies of all the good maidens
 which were martyred for the sick lady's sake.  Also they
 found the names of everych, and of what blood they were
 come, and all were of kings' blood, and twelve of them
 were kings' daughters.  Then they departed and went
 into a forest.  Now, said Percivale unto Galahad, we
 must depart, so pray we Our Lord that we may meet
 together in short time: then they did off their helms and
 kissed together, and wept at their departing.
