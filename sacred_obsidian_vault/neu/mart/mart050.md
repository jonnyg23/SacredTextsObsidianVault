 CHAPTER V
 
 How at feast of the wedding of King Arthur to Guenever,
 a white hart came into the hall, and thirty couple
 hounds, and how a brachet pinched the hart which
 was taken away.
 
 THEN was the high feast made ready, and the king was wedded at
 Camelot unto Dame Guenever in the church of Saint Stephen's, with
 great solemnity.  And as every man was set after his degree,
 Merlin went to all the knights of the Round Table, and bade them
 sit still, that none of them remove.  For ye shall see a strange
 and a marvellous adventure.  Right so as they sat there came
 running in a white hart into the hall, and a white brachet next
 him, and thirty couple of black running hounds came after with a
 great cry, and the hart went about the Table Round as he went by
 other boards.  The white brachet bit him by the buttock and
 pulled out a piece, wherethrough the hart leapt a great leap and
 overthrew a knight that sat at the &lt;85&gt;board side; and therewith
 the knight arose and took up the brachet, and so went forth out
 of the hall, and took his horse and rode his way with the
 brachet.  Right so anon came in a lady on a white palfrey, and
 cried aloud to King Arthur, Sir, suffer me not to have this
 despite, for the brachet was mine that the knight led away.  I
 may not do therewith, said the king.
 
 With this there came a knight riding all armed on a great horse,
 and took the lady away with him with force, and ever she cried
 and made great dole.  When she was gone the king was glad, for
 she made such a noise.  Nay, said Merlin, ye may not leave these
 adventures so lightly; for these adventures must be brought again
 or else it would be disworship to you and to your feast.  I will,
 said the king, that all be done by your advice.  Then, said
 Merlin, let call Sir Gawaine, for he must bring again the white
 hart.  Also, sir, ye must let call Sir Tor, for he must bring
 again the brachet and the knight, or else slay him.  Also let
 call King Pellinore, for he must bring again the lady and the
 knight, or else slay him.  And these three knights shall do
 marvellous adventures or they come again.  Then were they called
 all three as it rehearseth afore, and each of them took his
 charge, and armed them surely.  But Sir Gawaine had the first
 request, and therefore we will begin at him.
