 <p><i>HERE are we for the last time face to face,<br> Thou and I, Book, before I bid thee speed<br> Upon thy perilous journey to that place<br> For which I have done on thee pilgrim's weed,<br> Striving to get thee all things for thy need<br> I love thee, whatso time or men may say<br> Of the poor singer of an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   Good reason why I love thee, een if thou<br> Be mocked or clean forgot as time wears on;<br> For ever as thy fashioning did grow,<br> Kind word and praise because of thee I won<br> From those without whom were my world all gone,<br> My hope fallen dead, my singing cast away,<br> And I set soothly in an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   I love thee; yet this last time must it be<br> That thou must hold thy peace and I must speak,<br> Lest if thou babble I begin to see<br> Thy gear too thin, thy limbs and heart too weak,<br> To find the land thou goest forth to seek<br> Though what harm if thou die upon the way,<br> Thou idle singer of an empty day?</i> <a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>   But though this land desired thou never reach,<br> Yet folk who know it mayst thou meet or death;<br> Therefore a word unto thee would I teach<br> To answer these, who, noting thy weak breath,<br> Thy wandering eyes, thy heart of little faith,<br> May make thy fond desire a sport and play,<br> Mocking the singer of an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   That land's name, sayst thou? and the road thereto?<br> Nay, Book, thou mockest, saying thou knowst it not;<br> Surely no book of verse I ever knew<br> But ever was the heart within him hot<br> To gain the Land of Matters Unforgot<br> There, now we both laughas the whole world may,<br> At us poor singers of an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   Nay, let it pass, and hearken! Hast thou heard<br> That therein I believe I have a friend,<br> Of whom for love I may not be afeard?<br> It is to him indeed I bid thee wend;<br> Yea, he perchance may meet thee ere thou end,<br> Dying so far off from the hedge of bay,<br> Thou idle singer of an empty day!</i></p>  
 <p><i>   Well, think of him, I bid thee, on the road,<br> And if it hap that midst of thy defeat,<br> Fainting beneath thy follies heavy load,<br> My Master, GEOFFRY CHAUCER, thou do meet,<br> Then shalt thou win a space of rest full sweet;</i> <a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a><br> <i>Then be thou bold, and speak the words I say,<br> The idle singer of an empty day!</i></p>  
 <p><i>   "O Master, O thou great of heart and tongue,<br> Thou well mayst ask me why I wander here,<br> In raiment rent of stories oft besung!<br> But of thy gentleness draw thou anear,<br> And then the heart of one who held thee dear<br> Mayst thou behold! So near as that I lay<br> Unto the singer of an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   "For this he ever said, who sent me forth<br> To seek a place amid thy company;<br> That howsoever little was my worth,<br> Yet was he worth een just so much as I;<br> He said that rhyme hath little skill to lie;<br> Nor feigned to cast his worser part away<br> In idle singing for an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   "I have beheld him tremble oft enough<br> At things he could not choose but trust to me,<br> Although he knew the world was wise and rough:<br> And never did he fail to let me see<br> His love, his folly and faithlessness, maybe;<br> And still in turn I gave him voice to pray<br> Such prayers as cling about an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   "Thou, keen-eyed, reading me, mayst read him through,<br> For surely little is there left behind;</i> <a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a><br> <i>No power great deeds unnameable to do;<br> No knowledge for which words he may not find;<br> No love of things as vague as autumn wind<br> Earth of the earth lies hidden by my clay,<br> The idle singer of an empty day!</i></p>  
 <p><i>   "Children we twain are, saith he, late made wise<br> In love, but in all else most childish still,<br> And seeking still the pleasure of our eyes,<br> And what our ears with sweetest sounds may fill;<br> Not fearing Love, lest these things he should kill;<br> Howeer his pain by pleasure doth he lay,<br> Making a strange tale of an empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   "Death have we hated, knowing not what it meant;<br> Life have we loved, through green leaf and through sere,<br> Though still the less we knew of its intent:<br> The Earth and Heaven through countless year on year,<br> Slow changing, were to us but curtains fair,<br> Hung round about a little room, where play<br> Weeping and laughter of man's empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   "O Master, if thine heart could love us yet,<br> Spite of things left undone, and wrongly done,<br> Some place in loving hearts then should we get,<br> For thou, sweet-souled, didst never stand alone,<br> But knewst the joy and woe of many an one <br> By lovers dead, who live through thee, we pray,<br> Help thou us singers of an empty day!" <a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a></i></p>  
 <p><i>   Fearest thou, Book, what answer thou mayst gain<br> Lest he should scorn thee, and thereof thou die?<br> Nay, it shall not be.Thou mayst toil in vain,<br> And never draw the House of Fame anigh;<br> Yet he and his shall know whereof we cry,<br> Shall call it not ill done to strive to lay<br> The ghosts that crowd about life's empty day.</i></p>  
 <p><i>   Then let the others go! and if indeed<br> In some old garden thou and I have wrought,<br> And made fresh flowers spring up from hoarded seed,<br> And fragrance of old days and deeds have brought<br> Back to folk weary; all was not for nought.<br> No little part it was for me to play<br> The idle singer of an empty day</i>.</p>
