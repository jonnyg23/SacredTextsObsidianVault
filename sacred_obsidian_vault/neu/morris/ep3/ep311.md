 <p>SO is a year passed of the quiet life,<br> That these old men from such mishap and strife,<br> Such springing up, and dying out of dreams<br> Had won at last. What further then? Meseems<br> Whateer the tale may know of what befell<br> Their lives henceforth I would not have it tell;<br> Since each tale's ending needs must be the same:<br> And we men call it Death. Howeer it came<br> To those, whose bitter hope hath made this book,<br> With other eyes, I think, they needs must look<br> On its real face, than when so long agone<br> They thought that every good thing would be won,<br> If they might win a refuge from it.<br>                                       Lo,<br> A long life gone, and nothing more they know,<br> Why they should live to have desire and foil,<br> And toil, that overcome, brings yet more toil,<br> Than that day of their vanished youth, when first<br> They saw Death clear, and deemed all life accurst<br> By that cold overshadowing threat,the End.</p>  
 <p>   That night, when first they gan their way to wend, <a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 435</font></a><br> And each dash in the moonlight of the sweep,<br> That broke the green bay's little-resting sleep,<br> Drew their stern further from the plague-cursed shore,<br> Did no cold doubt their gathering hope cross oer<br> Of sweet rest fled from? Or that day of days,<br> When first the sun the veil of mist did raise,<br> And showed the new land real before them there,<br> Did no shame blot the victory over fear,<br> (Ah, short-lived victory!) that, whateer might grow<br> And change, there changeless were they fettered now,<br> And with blind eyes must gaze upon the earth,<br> Forgetting every word that tells of birth,<br> And still be dead-alive, while all things else<br> Beat with the pulse that mid the struggle dwells?</p>  
 <p>   Ah, doubt and shame they well might have indeed.<br> Cry out upon them, ye who have no need<br> Of life to right the blindness and the wrong!<br> Think scorn of these, ye, who are made so strong,<br> That with no good-night ye can loose the hand<br> That led you erst through love's sweet flowery land!<br> Laugh, ye whose eyes are piercing to behold<br> What makes the silver seas and skies of gold!<br> Pass by in hate, ye folk, who day by day<br> Win all desires that lie upon your way!</p>  
 <p>   Yet mid your joyous wisdom and content,<br> Methinks ye know not what those moments meant,<br> When ye, yet children, mid great pleasure stayed, <a name="page_436"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 436</font></a><br> Wondering for why your hearts were so downweighed;<br> Or if ye ever loved, then, when her eyes<br> In happiest moments changed in sudden wise,<br> And nought ye knew what she was thinking of;<br> Yet, O belike, ye know not much of love,<br> Who know not that this meant the fearful threat,<br> The End, forgotten much, remembered yet<br> Now and again, that all perfection mocks.</p>  
 <p>   "And yet the door of many a tale unlocks,<br> Makes love itself," saith one, "with all its bliss."<br> Ah, could I speak the word that in me is!<br> I dare not, lest to cursing it should turn.<br> But hearkenif Death verily makes Love burn,<br> It is because we evermore should cry,<br> If we had words, that we might never die:<br> Words fail us: therefore, "O thou Death," we say,<br> "Thus do we work that thou mayst take away!<br> Look at this beauty of young children's mirth,<br> Soon to be swallowed by thy noiseless dearth!<br> Look at this faithful love that knows no end<br> Unless thy cold thrill through it thou shouldst send!<br> Look at this hand ripening to perfect skill<br> Unless the fated measure thou didst fill;<br> This eager knowledge that would stop for nought,<br> Unless thy net both chase and hunter caught!<br> O Death! with deeds like these gainst thee we pray,<br> That thou, like those thou slewest, mayst pass away!" <a name="page_437"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 437</font></a></p>  
 <p>   And these folkthese poor tale-tellers, who strove<br> In their wild way the heart of Death to move,<br> Een as we singers, and failed, een as we,<br> Surely on their side I at least will be,<br> And deem that when at last, their fear worn out,<br> They fell asleep, all that old shame and doubt,<br> Shamed them not now, nor did they doubt it good,<br> That they in arms against that Death had stood.</p>  
 <p>   Ah me! all praise and blame, they heed it not<br> Cold are the yearning hearts that once were hot;<br> And all those images of love and pain,<br> Wrought as the year did wax, perfect, and wane,<br> If they were verily loving there alive,<br> No pleasure to their tale-tellers could give.<br> And thou, O tale of what these sleepers were,<br> Wish one good-night to them thou holdest dear,<br> Then die thyself, and let us go our ways,<br> And live awhile amid these latter days!</p>
