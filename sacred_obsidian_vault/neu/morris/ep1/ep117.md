 <p>FAIR was the morn to-day, the blossom's scent<br> Floated across the fresh grass, and the bees<br> With low vexed song from rose to lily went,<br> A gentle wind was in the heavy trees,<br> And thine eyes shone with joyous memories;<br> Fair was the early morn, and fair wert thou,<br> And I was happyAh, be happy now!</p>  
 <p>   Peace and content without us, love within<br> That hour there was, now thunder and wild rain,<br> Have wrapped the cowering world, and foolish sin,<br> And nameless pride, have made us wise in vain;<br> Ah, love! although the morn shall come again,<br> And on new rose-buds the new sun shall smile,<br> Can we regain what we have lost meanwhile?</p>  
 <p>   Een now the west grows clear of storm and threat,<br> But midst the lightning did the fair sun die<br> Ah he shall rise again for ages yet,<br> He cannot waste his lifebut thou and I<br> Who knows if next morn this felicity<br> My lips may feel, or if thou still shalt live<br> This seal of love renewed once more to give?</p>

 <p>WITHIN a lovely valley, watered well<br> With flowery streams, the July feast befell,<br> And there within the Chief-priest's fair abode<br> They cast aside their trouble's heavy load,<br> Scarce made aweary by the sultry day.<br> The earth no longer laboured; shaded lay<br> The sweet-breathed kine, across the sunny vale,<br> From hill to hill the wandering rook did sail,<br> Lazily croaking, midst his dreams of spring,<br> Nor more awake the pink-foot dove did cling<br> Unto the beech-bough, murmuring now and then;<br> All rested but the restless sons of men<br> And the great sun that wrought this happiness,<br> And all the vale with fruitful hopes did bless.<br>    So in a marble chamber bright with flowers,<br> The old men feasted through the fresher hours,<br> And at the hottest time of all the day<br> When now the sun was on his downward way,<br> Sat listening to a tale an elder told,<br> New to his fathers while they yet did hold<br> The cities of some far-off Grecian isle,<br> Though in the heavens the cloud of force and guile<br> Was gathering dark that sent them oer the sea<br> To win new lands for their posterity.</p>
