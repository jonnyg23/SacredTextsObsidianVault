 <p><font size="-1">IT was foretold to a great king, that he who should reign after him should be low-born and poor; which thing came to pass in the end, for all that the king could do?</font></p>  
 <p>A KING there was in days of old<br> Who ruled wide lands, nor lacked for gold,<br> Nor honour, nor much longed-for praise,<br> And his days were called happy days,<br> So peaceable his kingdoms were,<br> While others wrapt in war and fear<br> Fell ever unto worse and worse.<br>    Therefore his city was the nurse<br> Of all that men then had of lore,<br> And none were driven from his door<br> That seemed well-skilled in anything;<br> So of the sages was he king;<br> And from this learned man and that,<br> Little by little, lore he gat,<br> And many a lordless, troubled land<br> Fell scarce loth to his dreaded hand. <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a><br>    Midst this it chanced that, on a day,<br> Clad in his glittering gold array,<br> He held a royal festival;<br> And nigh him in his glorious hall<br> Beheld his sages most and least,<br> Sitting much honoured at the feast.<br> But mid the faces so well-known,<br> Of men he well might call his own,<br> He saw a little wizened man<br> With face grown rather grey than wan<br> From lapse of years, beardless was he,<br> And bald as is the winter tree;<br> But his two deep-set, glittering eyes<br> Gleamed at the sight of mysteries<br> None knew but he; few words he said,<br> And unto those small heed was paid;<br> But the king, young, yet old in guile,<br> Failed not to note a flickering smile<br> Upon his face, as now and then<br> He turned him from the learned men<br> Toward the king's seat, so thought to know<br> What new thing he might have to show;<br> And presently, the meat being done,<br> He bade them bring him to his throne,<br> And when before him he was come,<br> He said, "Be welcome to my home;<br> What is thine art, canst thou in rhyme<br> Tell stories of the ancient time?<br> Or dost thou chronicle old wars? <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a><br> Or knowst thou of the change of stars?<br> Or seekst thou the transmuting stone?<br> Or canst thou make the shattered bone<br> Grow whole, and dying men live on<br> Till years like thine at last are won?<br> Or what thing bringst thou to me here,<br> Where nought but men of lore are dear<br> To me and mine?"<br>                      "O King," said he,<br> "But few things know I certainly,<br> Though I have toiled for many a day<br> Along the hard and doubtful way<br> That bringeth wise men to the grave:<br> And now for all the years I gave,<br> To know all things that man can learn,<br> A few months learned life I earn,<br> Nor feel much liker to a god<br> Than when beside my sheep I trod<br> Upon the thymy, wind-swept down.<br> Yet am I come unto thy town<br> To tell thee somewhat that I learned<br> As on the stars I gazed, and yearned<br> To cast this weary body off,<br> With all its chains of mock and scoff<br> And creeping deathfor as I read<br> The sure decrees with joy and dread,<br> Somewhat I saw writ down of thee,<br> And who shall have the sovereignty<br> When thou art gone." <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a><br>                    "Nay," said the King,<br> "Speak quick and tell me of the thing."<br>    "Sire," said the sage, "thine ancient line<br> Thou holdest as a thing divine,<br> So long and undisturbed it is,<br> But now shall there be end to this,<br> For surely in my glittering text<br> I read that he who shall sit next,<br> On this thine ancient throne and high,<br> Shall he no better born than I<br> Whose grandsire none remembereth,<br> Nor where my father first drew breath."<br>    "Yea," said the King, "and this may be;<br> Yet, O Sage, ere I credit thee,<br> Some token certes must thou show,<br> Or tell me what I think to know,<br> Alone, among all folk alive;<br> Then surely great gifts will I give<br> To thee, and make thee head of all<br> Who watch the planets rise and fall."<br>    "Bid these stand backward from thy throne,"<br> The sage said, "then to thee alone<br> Long hidden matters will I tell;<br> And then, if thou believest, well<br> And if thou dost notwell also;<br> No gift I ask, but leave to go,<br> For strange to me is this thy state,<br> And for thyself, thou well mayst hate<br> My crabbed age and misery." <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a><br>    "Well," said the King, "let this thing be;<br> And ye, my masters, stand aback!<br> For of the fresh air have I lack,<br> And in my pleasance would I walk<br> To hearken this grave elder's talk<br> And gain new lore."<br>                         Therewith he rose<br> And led the way unto a close,<br> Shaded with grey-leaved olive-trees;<br> And when they were amidst of these<br> He turned about and said, "Speak, friend,<br> And of thy folly make an end,<br> And take this golden chain therefore."<br>    "Rightly thou namest my weak lore,"<br> The sage said, "therefore to the end<br> Be wise, and what the fates may send<br> Take thou, nor struggle in the net<br> Wherein thine helpless feet are set!<br> Hearken! a year is well-nigh done<br> Since, at the hottest of the sun,<br> Stood Antony beneath this tree,<br> And took a jewelled cup of thee,<br> And drank swift death in guise of wine;<br> Since he, most trusted of all thine,<br> At last too full of knowledge grew,<br> And chiefly, he of all men knew<br> How the Earl Marshal Hugh had died,<br> Since he had drawn him on to ride<br> Into a bushment of his foes, <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a><br> To meet death from unnumbered blows."<br>    "Thou knowest that by me he died,"<br> The King said, "How if now I cried<br> Help! the magician slayeth me?"<br> Swiftly should twenty sword-blades be<br> Clashing within thy ribs, and thou<br> Nearer to death than even now."<br>    "Not thus, O King, I fear to die,"<br> The Sage said; "Death shall pass me by<br> Many a year yet, because perchance,<br> I fear not aught his clattering dance,<br> And have enough of weary days.<br> But thoufarewell, and win the praise<br> Of sages, by thy hearkening<br> With heed to this most certain thing.<br> Fear not because this thing I know,<br> For to my grey tower back I go<br> High raised above the heathy hills<br> Where the great erne the swift hare kills,<br> Or stoops upon the new-yeaned lamb;<br> There almost as a god I am<br> Unto few folk, who hear thy name<br> Indeed, but know nought of thy fame,<br> Nay, scarce if thou be man or beast."<br> So saying, back unto the feast<br> He turned, and went adown the hall,<br> Not heeding any gibe or call;<br> And left the palace and the town<br> With face turned toward his windy down. <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a><br> Back to the hall, too, the King went,<br> With eyes upon the pavement bent<br> In pensive thought, delighting not<br> In riches and his kingly lot;<br> But thinking how his days began,<br> And of the lonely souls of man.</p>  
 <p>   But time past, and midst this and that,<br> The wise man's message he forgat;<br> And as a king he lived his life,<br> And took to him a noble wife<br> Of the kings' daughters, rich and fair.<br> And they being wed for nigh a year,<br> And she now growing great with child,<br> It happed unto the forest wild<br> This king with many folk must ride<br> At ending of the summer-tide;<br> There boar and hart they brought to bay,<br> And had right noble prize that day;<br> But when the noon was now long past,,<br> And the thick woods grew overcast,<br> They roused the mightiest hart of all.<br> Then loudly gan the king to call<br> Unto his huntsmen, not to leave<br> That mighty beast for dusk nor eve<br> Till they had won him; with which word<br> His horn he blew, and forth he spurred,<br> Taking no thought of most or least,<br> But only of that royal beast. <a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a><br> And over rough and smooth he rode,<br> Nor yet for anything abode,<br> Till dark night swallowing up the day<br> With blindness his swift course must stay.<br> Nor was there with him any one,<br> So far his fair steed had outrun<br> The best of all his hunting-folk.<br>    So, glancing at the stars that broke<br> Twixt the thick branches here and there,<br> Backward he turned, and peered with care<br> Into the darkness, but saw nought,<br> Nor heard his folk, and therewith thought<br> His bed must be the brake leaves brown.<br> Then in a while he lighted down,<br> And felt about a little space,<br> If he might find a softer place;<br> But as he groped from tree to tree<br> Some glimmering light he seemed to see<br> Twixt the dark stems, and thither turned,<br> If yet perchance some wood-fire burned<br> Within a peasant's hut, where he<br> Might find, amidst their misery,<br> Rough food, or shelter at the least.<br>    So, leading on his wearied beast,<br> Blindly he crept from tree to tree,<br> Till slowly grew that light to be<br> The thing he looked for, and he found<br> A hut on a cleared space of ground,<br> From whose half-opened door there streamed <a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a><br> The light that erst far off had gleamed.<br> Then of that shelter was he fain,<br> But just as he made shift to gain<br> The open space in front of it,<br> A shadow oer the grass did flit,<br> And on the wretched threshold stood<br> A big man, with a bar of wood<br> In his right hand, who seemed as though<br> He got him ready for a blow;<br> But ere he spoke the King cried, "Friend,<br> May God good hap upon thee send,<br> If thou wilt give me rest this night,<br> And food according to thy might."<br>    "Nay," said the carle, "my wife lieth<br> In labour, and is nigh her death:<br> Nor canst thou enter here at all;<br> But nearby is my asses stall,<br> Who on this night bide in the town;<br> There, if thou wilt, mayst thou lie down,<br> And sleep until the dawn of day,<br> And I will bring thee what I may<br> Of food and drink."<br>                        Then said the King,<br> "Thanked be thou; neither for nothing<br> Shalt thou this good deed do to me."<br> "Nay," said the carle, "let these things be,<br> Surely I think before the morn,<br> To be too weary and forlorn<br> For gold much heart in me to put." <a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a><br> With that he turned, and from the hut<br> Brought out a lantern, and rye-bread,<br> And wine, and showed the king a shed,<br> Strewed with a litter of dry brake:<br> Withal he muttered, for his sake,<br> Unto Our Lady some rude prayer,<br> And turned about and left him there.<br>    So when the rye-bread, nowise fine,<br> The king had munched, and with green wine<br> Had quenched his thirst, his horse he tied<br> Unto a post, and there beside<br> He fell asleep upon the brake.</p>  
 <p>   But in an hour did he awake,<br> Astonied with an unnamed fear,<br> For words were ringing in his ear<br> Like the last echo of a scream,<br> "<i>Take! take!</i>" but of the vanished dream<br> No image was there left to him.<br> Then, trembling sore in every limb,<br> Did he arise, and drew his sword,<br> And passed forth on the forest sward,<br> And cautiously about he crept;<br> But he heard nought at all, except<br> Some groaning of the woodman's wife,<br> And forest sounds well known, but rife<br> With terror to the lonely soul.<br>    Then he lay down again, to roll<br> His limbs within his huntsman's cloak; <a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a><br> And slept again, and once more woke<br> To tremble with that unknown fear,<br> And other echoing words to hear<br> "<i>Give up! give up!</i>" nor anything<br> Showed more why these strange words should ring<br> About him. Then he sat upright,<br> Bewildered, gazing through the night,<br> Until his weary eyes, grown dim,<br> Showed not the starlit tree-trunks slim<br> Against the black wood, grey and plain;<br> And into sleep he sank again,<br> And woke not soon: but sleeping dreamed<br> That he awoke, nor other seemed<br> The place he woke in but that shed,<br> And there beside his bracken bed<br> He seemed to see the ancient sage<br> Shrivelled yet more with untold age,<br> Who bending down his head to him<br> Said, with a mocking smile and grim,<br> "Take, or give up; what matters it?<br> This child new-born shall surely sit<br> Upon thy seat when thou art gone,<br> And dwelling twixt straight walls of stone."<br>    Again the King woke at that word<br> And sat up, panting and afeard,<br> And staring out into the night,<br> Where yet the woods thought not of light;<br> And fain he was to cast off sleep,<br> Such visions from his eyes to keep. <a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a><br> Heavy his head grew none the less,<br> Twixt wildering thoughts and weariness,<br> And soon he fell asleep once more,<br> Nor dreamed, nor woke again, before<br> The sun shone through the forest trees;<br> And, shivering in the morning breeze,<br> He blinked with just-awakened eyes,<br> And pondering on those mysteries,<br> Unto the woodman's hut he went.</p>  
 <p>   Him he found kneeling down, and bent<br> In moody grief above a bed,<br> Whereon his wife lay, stark and dead,<br> Whose soul near morn had passed away;<br> And twixt the dead and living lay<br> A new-born man-child, fair and great.<br> So in the door the King did wait<br> To watch the man, who had no heed<br> Of this or that, so sore did bleed<br> The new-made wound within his heart.<br> But as the King gazed, for his part<br> He did but see his threatened foe,<br> And ever hard his heart did grow<br> With deadly hate and wilfulness:<br> And sight of that poor man's distress<br> Made it the harder, as of nought<br> But that unbroken line he thought<br> Of which he was the last: withal<br> His scornful troubled eyes did fall <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a><br> Upon that nest of poverty,<br> Where nought of joy he seemed to see.<br>    On straw the poor dead woman lay;<br> The door alone let in the day,<br> Showing the trodden earthen floor,<br> A board on trestles weak and poor,<br> Three stumps of tree for stool or chair,<br> A half-glazed pipkin, nothing fair,<br> A bowl of porridge by the wife<br> Untouched by lips that lacked for life,<br> A platter and a bowl of wood;<br> And in the further corner stood<br> A bow cut from the wych-elm tree,<br> A holly club, and arrows three<br> Ill pointed, heavy, spliced with thread.</p>  
 <p>   Ah! soothly, well remembered<br> Was that unblissful wretched home,<br> Those four bare walls, in days to come;<br> And often in the coming years<br> He called to mind the pattering tears<br> That, on the rent old sackcloth cast<br> About the body, fell full fast,<br> Twixt half-meant prayers and curses wild,<br> And that weak wailing of the child,<br> His threatened dreaded enemy,<br> The mighty king that was to be.<br>    But as he gazed unsoftened there,<br> With hate begot of scorn and care, <a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a><br> Loudly he heard a great horn blow,<br> And his own hunting call did know,<br> And soon began the shouts to hear<br> Of his own people drawing near.<br> Then lifting up his horn, he blew<br> A long shrill point, but as he threw<br> His head aback, beheld his folk,<br> Who from the close-set thicket broke<br> And oer the cleared space swiftly passed,<br> With shouts that he was found at last.<br>    Then turned the carle his doleful face,<br> And slowly rising in his place,<br> Drew thwart his eyes his fingers strong,<br> And on that gay-dressed glittering throng<br> Gazed stupidly, as still he heard<br> The name of King; but said no word.<br>    But his guest spoke, "Sirs, well be ye!<br> This luckless woodman, whom ye see,<br> Gave me good harbour through the night<br> And such poor victual as he might;<br> Therefore shall he have more than gold<br> For his reward; since dead and cold<br> His helpmate lies who last night died.<br> See now the youngling by her side;<br> Him will I take and rear him so<br> That he shall no more lie alow<br> In straw, or from the beech-tree dine.<br> But rather use white linen fine<br> And silver plate; and with the sword <a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a><br> Shall learn to serve some King or Lord.<br> How sayst thou, good man?"<br>                                     "Sire," he said,<br> Weeping, but shamefaced,"Since here dead<br> She lies, that erst kept house for me,<br> Een as thou willest let it be;<br> Though I had hoped to have a son<br> To help me get the day's work done.<br> And now, indeed, forth must he go<br> If unto manhood he should grow,<br> And lonely I must wander forth,<br> To whom east, west, and south, and north<br> Are all alike: forgive it me<br> If little thanks I give to thee<br> Who scarce can thank great God in heaven<br> For what is left of what was given."<br>    Small heed unto him the King gave,<br> But trembling in his haste to have<br> The body of his enemy,<br> Said to an old squire, "Bring to me<br> The babe, and give the good man this<br> Wherewith to gain a little bliss,<br> In place of all his troubles gone,<br> Nor need he now be long alone."<br>    The carle's rough face, at clink of gold,<br> Lit up, though still did he behold<br> The wasted body lying there;<br> But stooping, a rough box, foursquare,<br> Made of old wood and lined with hay, <a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a><br> Wherein the helpless infant lay,<br> He raised, and gave it to the squire<br> Who on the floor cast down his hire,<br> Nor sooth dared murmur aught the while,<br> But turning smiled a grim hard smile<br> To see the carle his pieces count<br> Still weeping: so did all men mount<br> And turning round into the wood<br> Forgat him and his drearihood,<br> And soon were far off from the hut.</p>  
 <p>   Then coming out, the door he shut<br> Behind him, and adown a glade,<br> Towards a rude hermitage he made<br> To fetch the priest unto his need,<br> To bury her and say her bede<br> So when all things that he might do<br> Were done aright, heavy with woe,<br> He left the woodland hut behind<br> To take such chance as he might find<br> In other lands, forgetting all<br> That in that forest did befall.</p>  
 <p>   But through the wild wood rode the King,<br> Moody and thinking on the thing,<br> Nor free from that unreasoning fear;<br> Till now, when they had drawn anear<br> The open country, and could see<br> The road run on from close to lea, <a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a><br> And lastly by a wooden bridge<br> A long way from that heathy ridge<br> Cross over a deep lowland stream<br> Then in his eyes there came a gleam,<br> And his hand fell upon his sword,<br> And turning round to squire and lord<br> He said, "Ride sirs, the way is clear,<br> Nor of my people have I fear,<br> Nor do my foes range over wide;<br> And for myself fain would I ride<br> Right slowly homewards through the fields<br> Noting what this and that one yields;<br> While by my squire who bears the child<br> Lightly my way shall be beguiled.<br> For some nurse now he needs must have<br> This tender life of his to save;<br> And doubtless by the stream there is<br> Some house where he may dwell in bliss,<br> Till he grow old enough to learn<br> How gold and glory he may earn;<br> And grow, perchance, to be a lord."<br>    With downcast eyes he spoke that word;<br> But forth they galloped speedily,<br> And he drew rein and stood to see<br> Their green coats lessening as they went.<br> This man unto the other bent,<br> Until mid dust and haze at last<br> Into a wavering mass they passed;<br> Then twixt the hedgerows vanished quite <a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a><br> Just told of by the dust-cloud white<br> Rolled upwards twixt the elm-trunks slim.</p>  
 <p>   Then turned the king about to him,<br> Who held the child, noting again<br> The thing wherein he had been lain,<br> And on one side of it could see<br> A lion painted hastily<br> In red upon a ground of white,<br> As though of old it had been dight<br> For some lord's rough-wrought palisade;<br> But naked mid the hay was laid<br> The child, and had no mark or sign.<br>    Then said the king, "My ancient line<br> Thou and thy sires through good and ill<br> Have served, and unto thee my will<br> Is law enough from day to day;<br> Ride nigh me hearkening what I say."<br>    He shook his rein and side by side<br> Down through the meadows did they ride,<br> And opening all his heart, the king<br> Told to the old man everything<br> Both of the sage, and of his dream;<br> Withal drawn nigh unto the stream,<br> He said, "Yet this shall never be,<br> For surely as thou lovest me,<br> Adown this water shall he float<br> With this rough box for ark and boat,<br> Then if mine old line he must spill <a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a><br> There let God save him if he will,<br> While I in no case shed his blood."<br>    "Yea," said the squire, "thy words are good,<br> For the whole sin shall lie on me,<br> Who greater things would do for thee<br> If need there were; yet note, I pray,<br> It may be he will scape this day<br> And live; and what wouldst thou do then<br> If thou shouldst meet him among men?<br> I counsel thee to let him go<br> Since sure to nought thy will shall grow."<br>    "Yea, yea," the king said, "let all be<br> That may be, if I once but see<br> This ark whirl in the eddies swift<br> Or tangled in the autumn drift<br> And wrong side up:" but with that word<br> Their horse-hoofs on the plank he heard,<br> And swift across the bridge he rode,<br> And nigh the end of it abode,<br> Then turned to watch the old squire stop,<br> And leaning oer the bridge-rail drop<br> The luckless child; he heard withal<br> A muttered word and splashing fall<br> And from the wakened child a cry,<br> And saw the cradle hurrying by,<br> Whirled round and sinking, but as yet<br> Holding the child, nor overset.<br>    Now somewhat, soothly at the sight<br> Did the king doubt if he outright <a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a><br> Had rid him of his feeble foe,<br> But frowning did he turn to go<br> Unto his home, nor knew indeed<br> How better he might help his need;<br> And as unto his house he rode<br> Full little care for all he showed,<br> Still bidding Samuel the squire<br> Unto his bridle-hand ride nigher,<br> To whom he talked of careless things,<br> As unto such will talk great kings.<br>    But when unto his palace gate<br> He came at last, thereby did wait<br> The chamberlain with eager eyes<br> Above his lips grown grave with lies,<br> In haste to tell him that the queen,<br> While in the wild-wood he had been,<br> Had borne a daughter unto him<br> Strong, fair of face, and straight of limb.<br> So well at ease and glad thereat<br> His troubled dream he nigh forgat,<br> His troubled waking, and the ride<br> Unto the fateful river-side;<br> Or thought of all as little things<br> Unmeet to trouble souls of kings.</p>  
 <p>So passed the days, so passed the years<br> In such-like hopes, and such-like fears,<br> And such-like deeds in field and hall<br> As unto royal men befall, <a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a><br> And fourteen years have passed away<br> Since on the huddled brake he lay<br> And dreamed that dream, remembered now<br> Once and again, when slow and slow<br> The minutes of some sleepless night<br> Crawl toward the dawning of the light.</p>  
 <p>   Remembered not on this sweet morn<br> When to the ringing of the horn,<br> Jingle of bits and mingled shout<br> Toward that same stream he rideth out<br> To see his grey-winged falcons fly.<br>    So long he rode he drew anigh<br> A mill upon the river's brim,<br> That seemed a goodly place to him,<br> For oer the oily smooth millhead<br> There hung the apples growing red,<br> And many an ancient apple-tree<br> Within the orchard could he see,<br> While the smooth millwalls white and black<br> Shook to the great wheel's measured clack,<br> And grumble of the gear within;<br> While oer the roof that dulled that din<br> The doves sat crooning half the day,<br> And round the half-cut stack of hay<br> The sparrows fluttered twittering.<br>    There smiling stayed the joyous king,<br> And since the autumn noon was hot<br> Thought good anigh that pleasant spot <a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a><br> To dine that day, and therewith sent<br> To tell the miller his intent:<br> Who held the stirrup of the king,<br> Bareheaded, joyful at the thing,<br> While from his horse he lit adown,<br> Then lead him oer an elm-beam brown,<br> New cut in February tide<br> That crossed the stream from side to side,<br> So underneath the apple trees<br> The king sat careless, well at ease<br> And ate and drank right merrily.<br>    To whom the miller drew anigh<br> Among the courtiers, bringing there<br> Such as he could of country fare,<br> Green yellowing plums from off his wall,<br> Wasp-bitten pears, the first to fall<br> From off the wavering spire-like tree,<br> Junkets, and cream and fresh honey.<br>    Smiling the king regarded him,<br> For he was round-paunched, short of limb,<br> Red-faced, with long, lank flaxen hair;<br> But with him was a boy, right fair,<br> Grey-eyed, and yellow-haired, most like<br> Unto some Michael who doth strike<br> The dragon on a minster wall,<br> So sweet-eyed was he, and withal<br> So fearless of all things he seemed.<br> But when he saw him the king deemed<br> He scarce could be the miller's kin, <a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a><br> And laughing said, "Hast thou within<br> Thy dusty mill the dame who bore<br> This stripling in the days of yore,<br> For fain were I to see her now,<br> If she be liker him than thou?"<br>    "Sire," said the miller, "that may be<br> And thou my dame shall surely see;<br> But for the stripling, neither I<br> Begat him, nor my wife did lie<br> In labour when the lad was born,<br> But as an outcast and forlorn<br> We found him fourteen years to-day,<br> So quick the time has passed away."</p>  
 <p>   Then the king, hearkening what he said,<br> A vanished day remembered,<br> And troubled grew his face thereat;<br> But while he thought of this and that<br> The man turned from him and was gone<br> And by him stood the lad alone;<br> At whom he gazed, and as their eyes<br> Met, a great horror gan arise<br> Within his heart, and back he shrank<br> And shuddering a deep draught he drank,<br> Scarce knowing if his royal wine<br> He touched, or juice of some hedge-vine.<br>    But as his eyes he lifted up<br> From off his jewelled golden cup,<br> Once more the miller drew anigh, <a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 160</font></a><br> By whom his wife went timidly<br> Bearing some burden in her hand;<br> So when before him she did stand<br> And he beheld her worn and old,<br> And black-haired, then that hair of gold,<br> Grey eyes, firm lips, and round cleft chin,<br> Brought stronger memory of his sin.<br>    But the carle spake, "Dame, tell the King<br> How this befell, a little thing<br> The thoughts of such great folk to hold,<br> Speak out, and fear not to be bold."<br>    "My tale," she said, "is short enow,<br> For this day fourteen years ago<br> Along this river-side I rode<br> From market to our poor abode,<br> Where we dwelt far from other men,<br> Since thinner was the country then<br> Than now it is; so as I went<br> And wearied oer my panniers bent,<br> From out the stream a feeble cry<br> I heard, and therewith presently,<br> From off my mule's back could I see<br> This boy who standeth here by thee,<br> A naked, new-born infant, laid<br> In a rough ark that had been stayed<br> By a thick tangled bed of weed;<br> So pitying the youngling's need,<br> Dismounting, did I wade for him<br> Waist deep, whose ark now scarce did swim; <a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 161</font></a><br> And he, with cold, and misery,<br> And hunger, was at point to die.<br>    "Withal, I bare him to the mill<br> And cherished him, and had good will<br> To bring the babe up as mine own;<br> Since childless were we and alone,<br> And no one came to father it.<br> So oft have I rejoiced to sit<br> Beside the fire and watch him play.<br> And now, behold him!but some day<br> I look to lose him, for, indeed,<br> I deem he comes of royal seed,<br> Unmeet for us: and now, my lord,<br> Have you heard every foolish word<br> About my sonthis boywhose name<br> Is Michael soothly, since he came<br> To us this day nigh Michaelmas.<br> See, sire, the ark wherein he was!<br> Which I have kept."<br>                        Therewith she drew<br> A cloth away; but the King knew,<br> Long ere she moved, what he should see,<br> Nor looked, but seeming carelessly<br> Leaned on the board and hid his eyes.<br> But at the last did he arise<br> And saw the painted lion red,<br> Not faded, well remembered;<br> Withal he thought, "And who of these<br> Were with me then amongst the trees <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a><br> To see this box;" but presently<br> He thought again that none but he<br> And the grey squire, old Samuel,<br> That painting could have noted well.<br> Since Samuel his cloak had cast<br> About it, and therewith had past<br> Throughout the forest on that day,<br> And not till all were well away<br> Had drawn it off before the King.<br> But changed and downcast at the thing<br> He left the lovely autumn place,<br> Still haunted by the new-found face<br> Of his old foe, and back he rode<br> Unto his ancient rich abode,<br> Forcing but dismal merriment<br> As midst his smiling lords he went;<br> Who yet failed not to note his mood,<br> So changed: and some men of the wood<br> Remembered them, but said not aught,<br> Yea, trembled lest their hidden thought<br> Some bird should learn, and carry it.</p>  
 <p>   The morrow come, the King did sit<br> Alone, to talk with Samuel,<br> Who yet lived, gathering wage for hell.<br> He from the presence in a while<br> Came forth, and with his ugly smile<br> He muttered, "Well betide me, then,<br> St. Peter! they are lucky men <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a><br> Who serve no kings, since they indeed<br> May damn themselves each for his need.<br> And will not he outlive this day<br> Whom the deep water could not slay,<br> Ere yet his lips had tasted food?<br> With that a horse, both strong and good,<br> He gat of the king's equerry,<br> And toward the mill rode speedily.</p>  
 <p>   There Michael by the mill-tail lay,<br> Watching the swift stream snatch away<br> His float from midst the careless dace;<br> But thinking of the thin, dark face,<br> That yesterday all men he saw<br> Gaze at with seeming love and awe;<br> Nor had he, wondering at the lords,<br> Lost one word of the housewife's words;<br> And still he noted that the King<br> Beheld him as a wondrous thing,<br> Strange to find there: so in his heart<br> He thought to play some royal part<br> In this wild play of life, and made<br> Stories, wherein great words he said,<br> And did great deeds in desperate fight.<br> But midst these thoughts there came in sight<br> He who had carried him of yore,<br> From out the woodman's broken door,<br> Dressed like a king's man, with fine gold<br> Touching his hard brown hands and old, <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a><br> So was his sleeve embroidered;<br> A plumed hat had he on his head,<br> And by his side a cutting sword<br> Fit for the girdle of a lord;<br> And round his neck a knife he bore,<br> Whose hilt was well enamelled oer,<br> With green leaves on a golden ground,<br> Whose stem a silver scroll enwound;<br> Charged with those letters, writ in black,<br> <i>Strike! for no dead man cometh back!</i><br>    The boy gazed at him earnestly,<br> With beating heart, as he drew nigh.<br> And when at last he drew his rein<br> Beside him, thought that not in vain<br> His dream might be. But Samuel<br> Below his breath said; "Surely well<br> Shalt thou fulfil thy destiny;<br> And, spite of all, thou wilt not die<br> Till thou hast won the arched crown?<br>    But with that word he lighted down,<br> And said aloud, "Lad, tell to me<br> Where the good miller I may see,<br> For from the King I come to-day,<br> And have a word to him to say;<br> I think, indeed, concerning thee;<br> For surely thou his lad must be."<br>    Then Michael leapt up, nor took heed<br> Of how the nibbling dace might feed<br> Upon the loose ends of his bait; <a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a><br> "Fair sir," he said, "my sire doth wait<br> Until men bring his mare from grass,<br> For to the good town will he pass,<br> Since he has need of household gear;<br> Follow, my lord, the place is here."<br>    Withal, the good steed being made fast,<br> Unto the other side they passed,<br> And by the door the miller found,<br> Who bowed before him to the ground,<br> And asked what he would have him do<br> Then from his bosom Samuel drew<br> A scroll, and said, "Good friend, read here,<br> And do my bidding without fear<br> Of doing ill."<br>                "Sir," said the man,<br> "But little lettered skill I can;<br> Let my dame come, for she can read<br> Well written letters at good need."<br>    "Nay, friend," he said, "suffice it thee<br> This seal at the scroll's end to see,<br> My Lord the King's; and hear my word,<br> That I come hither from my lord<br> Thy foundling lad to have away<br> To serve the King from this same day."<br>    Downcast the miller looked thereat,<br> And twisting round his dusty hat,<br> Said, "Well, my lord, so must it be,<br> Nor is he aught akin to me,<br> Nor seems so: none the less would I <a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a><br> Have left him, when I came to die,<br> All things I have, with this my mill,<br> Wherein he hath no prentice skill,<br> Young as he is: and surely here<br> Might he have lived, with little fear,<br> A life of plenty and of bliss<br> Near by, too, a fair maid there is,<br> I looked should be good wife to him."</p>  
 <p>   Meanwhile young Michael's head gan swim<br> With thoughts of noble life and praise;<br> And he forgat the happy days<br> Wherein the happy dreams he dreamed<br> That now so near fulfilment seemed;<br> And, looking through the open mill,<br> Stared at the grey and windy hill<br> And saw it not, but some fair place<br> Made strange with many a changing face.<br> And all his life that was to be.<br>    But Samuel, laughing scornfully,<br> Said, "O good soul, thou thinkest then<br> This is a life for well-born men,<br> As our lord deems this youngling is<br> Tell me good lad, where lies thy bliss?<br>    But Michael turned shamefaced and red,<br> Waked from his dream, and stammering said,<br> "Fair sir, my life is sweet and good,<br> And John, the ranger of the wood,<br> Saith that I draw so good a bow, <a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a><br> That I shall have full skill enow<br> Ere many months have passed me by<br> To join the muster, and to try<br> To win the bag of florins white,<br> That folk, on Barnaby the bright,<br> Shoot for within the market town.<br> Sir, please you to look up and down<br> The weedy reaches of our stream,<br> And note the bubbles of the bream,<br> And see the great chub take the fly,<br> And watch the long pike basking lie<br> Outside the shadow of the weed.<br> Withal there come unto our need<br> Woodcock and snipe when swallows go;<br> And now the water-hen flies low<br> With feet that well nigh touch the reeds,<br> And plovers cry about the meads,<br> And the stares chatter; certes, sir,<br> It is a fair place all the year."<br>    Eyeing him grimly, Samuel said,<br> "Thou showst churl's breeding, by my head,<br> In foul despite of thy fair face!<br> Take heart, for to a better place<br> Thou goest now.Miller, farewell,<br> Nor needst thou to the neighbours tell<br> The noble fortunes of the lad;<br> For, certes, he shall not be glad<br> To know them in a year or twain.<br> Yet shall thy finding not be vain, <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a><br> And thou mayst bless it; for behold<br> This bag wherein is store of gold;<br> Take it and let thy hinds go play,<br> And grind no corn for many a day,<br> For it would buy thy mill and thee."<br>    He turned to go, but pensively<br> Stood Michael, for his broken dream<br> Doubtful and far away did seem<br> Amid the squire's rough mockeries;<br> And tears were gathering in his eyes.<br> But the kind miller's rough farewell<br> Rang in his ears; and Samuel<br> Stamped with his foot and plucked his sleeve;<br> So therewithal he turned to leave<br> His old abode, the quiet place,<br> Trembling, with wet and tearful face.<br>    But even as he turned there came<br> From out the house the simple dame<br> And cast rough arms about the lad,<br> Saying, "For that I have been glad<br> By means of thee this many a day,<br> My mourning heart this hour doth pay.<br> But fair son, mayst thou live in bliss,<br> And die in peace; remembering this,<br> When thou art come to high estate,<br> That in our house, early and late,<br> The happy house that shall be sad,<br> Thou hadst the best of all we had<br> And love unfeigned from us twain, <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a><br> Whose hearts thou madest young again,<br> Hearts that the quicker old shall grow<br> Now thou art gone."<br>                        "Good dame, enow,"<br> Quoth Samuel, "the day grows late,<br> And sure the king for meat shall wait<br> Until he see this new-found lord."<br> He strode away upon that word;<br> And half ashamed, and half afeard,<br> Yet eager as his dream he neared,<br> Shyly the lad went after him.<br> They crossed the stream and by its brim<br> Both mounted the great warhorse grey,<br> And without word they rode away.</p>  
 <p>   But as along the river's edge<br> They went, and brown birds in the sedge<br> Twittered their sweet and formless tune<br> In the fair autumn afternoon,<br> And reach by reach the well-known stream<br> They passed, again the hopeful dream<br> Of one too young to think death near,<br> Who scarce had learned the name of fear<br> Remorseful memories put to flight;<br> Lovely the whole world showed and bright.<br> Nor did the harsh voice rouse again<br> The thought of mockery or of pain,<br> For other thoughts held Samuel.<br>    So, riding silently and well, <a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 170</font></a><br> They reached at last the dusty road<br> That led unto the King's abode.<br> But Samuel turned away his face<br> Therefrom, and at a steady pace<br> The great horse thundered oer the bridge,<br> And made on toward the heathy ridge,<br> Wherefrom they rode that other day.<br> But Michael, noting well the way,<br> Why thus they went, fell wondering,<br> And said aloud, "Dwells then the King,<br> Fair sir, as now within the wood?"<br>    "Young fool, where that it seems him good<br> He dwelleth," quoth old Samuel,<br> "And now it pleaseth him to dwell<br> With the black monks across the wood."<br>    Withal he muttered in his hood,<br> "Curst be the King, and thee also,<br> Who thrust me out such deeds to do;<br> When I should bide at home to pray,<br> Who draw so nigh my ending day."<br> So saying forth his horse he spurred<br> And to himself said yet this word,<br> "Yea, yea, and of all days forlorn<br> God curse the day when I was born."<br>    Therewith he groaned; yet saying thus<br> His case seemed hard and piteous,<br> When he remembered how of old<br> Another tale he might have told.<br>    So as each thought his own thoughts still, <a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 171</font></a><br> The horse began to breast the hill,<br> And still they went on higher ground,<br> Until as Michael turned him round<br> He saw the sunny country-side<br> Spread out before him far and wide,<br> Golden amidst its waning green,<br> Joyous with varied life unseen.<br> Meanwhile from side to side of them<br> The trees began their way to hem,<br> As still he gazed from tree to tree,<br> And when he turned back presently<br> He saw before him like a wall<br> Uncounted tree trunks dim and tall.<br> Then with their melancholy sound<br> The odorous spruce woods met around<br> Those wayfarers, and when he turned<br> Once more, far off the sunlight burned<br> In star-like spots, while from oerhead,<br> Dim twilight through the boughs was shed.<br>    Not there as yet had Michael been,<br> Nor had he left the meadows green<br> Dotted about with spreading trees,<br> And fresh with sun and rain and breeze,<br> For those mirk woods, and still his eyes<br> Gazed round about for mysteries.<br> Since many an old wife's tale he knew;<br> Huge woodcutters in raiment blue,<br> The remnant of a mighty race,<br> The ancient masters of the place, <a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 172</font></a><br> And hammering trolls he looked to see,<br> And dancers of the faërie,<br> Who, as the ancient stories told,<br> In front were lovely to behold,<br> But empty shells seen from behind.</p>  
 <p>   So on they rode until the wind<br> Had died out, stifled by the trees,<br> And Michael mid those images<br> Of strange things made alive by fear,<br> Grew drowsy in the forest drear;<br> Nor noted how the time went past<br> Until they nigh had reached at last<br> The borders of the spruce-tree wood;<br> And with a tingling of the blood<br> Samuel bethought him of the day<br> When turned about the other way<br> He carried him he rode with now.<br> For the firs ended on the brow<br> Of a rough gravelly hill, and there<br> Lay a small valley nowise fair<br> Beneath them, clear at first of all<br> But brake, till amid rushes tall<br> Down in the bottom alders grew<br> Crabbed and rough; and winding through<br> The clayey mounds a brook there was<br> Oozy and foul, half choked with grass.<br>    There now the Squire awhile drew rein,<br> And noted how the ground again <a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a><br> Rose up upon the other side,<br> And saw a green glade opening wide<br> Twixt oaks and hollies, and he knew<br> Full well what place it led unto;<br> Withal he heard the bittern's boom,<br> And though without the fir-wood's gloom<br> They now were come, yet red and low<br> The sun above the trees did show,<br> And in despite of hardihead,<br> The old squire had a mortal dread<br> Of lying in the wood alone<br> When that was done that should be done.<br>    Now Michael, wakened by the wind,<br> Clutched tighter at the belt behind,<br> And with wide eyes was staring round,<br> When Samuel said, "Get to the ground,<br> My horse shall een sink deep enow,<br> Without thy body, in this slough;<br> And haste thee, or we both shall lie<br> Beneath the trees, and be as dry<br> As autumn dew can make us. Haste!<br> The time is short for thee to waste."<br>    Then from the horse the boy did glide,<br> And slowly down the valley side<br> They went, and Michael, wakened now,<br> Sang such rude songs as he might know,<br> Grown fresh and joyous of his life;<br> While Samuel, clutching at the knife<br> About his neck that hung, again <a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a><br> Down in the bottom tightened rein,<br> And turning, in a hoarse voice said,<br> "My girths are loosening, by my head!<br> Come nigh and draw them tighter, lad."<br>    Then Michael stayed his carol glad,<br> And noting little in his mirth<br> The other's voice, unto the girth<br> Without a word straight set his hand:<br> But as with bent head he did stand,<br> Straining to tighten what was tight,<br> In Samuel's hand the steel flashed bright,<br> And fell, deep smitten in his side,<br> Then, leaping back, the poor lad cried,<br> As if for help, and staggering fell,<br> With wide eyes fixed on Samuel;<br> Who none the less grown deadly pale,<br> Lit down, lest that should not avail<br> To slay him, and beside him knelt,<br> And since his eyes were closed now, felt<br> His heart that beat yet: therewithal<br> His hand upon the knife did fall.<br> But, ere his fingers clutched it well,<br> Far off he seemed to hear a bell,<br> And trembling knelt upright again,<br> And listening, listened not in vain,<br> For clear he heard a tinkling sound.<br> Then to his horse from off the ground<br> He leapt, nor reasoned with his dread,<br> But thought the angel of the dead <a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a><br> Was drawing nigh the slayer to slay,<br> Ere scarce the soul had passed away.<br> One dreadful moment yet he heard<br> That bell, then like a madman spurred<br> His noble horse; that maddened too,<br> The close-set fir-wood galloped through,<br> Not stayed by any stock or stone,<br> Until the furious race being done,<br> Anigh the bridge he fell down dead;<br> And Samuel, mazed with guilt and dread,<br> Wandered afoot throughout the night,<br> But came, at dawning of the light,<br> Half-dead unto the palace gate.<br>    There till the opening did he wait;<br> Then, by the King's own signet-ring,<br> He gained the chamber of the king,<br> And painfully what he had done<br> He told, and how the thing had gone.<br> And said withal: "Yet is he dead,<br> And surely that which made my dread<br> Shall give thee joy: for doubt not aught<br> That bell the angels to him brought,<br> That he in Abraham's breast might lie<br> So ends, O King, the prophecy."<br>    Nathless the King scowled, ill content,<br> And said, "I deemed that I had sent<br> A man of war to do my will,<br> Who lacked for neither force nor skill,<br> And thou comst with a woman's face, <a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a><br> Bewildered with thy desperate race,<br> And made an idiot with thy fear,<br> Nor bringst me any token here!"<br>    Therewith he rose and gat away,<br> But brooding on it through that day,<br> Thought that all things went not so ill<br> As first he deemed, and that he still<br> Might leave his old line flourishing.<br> Therewith both gold and many a thing<br> Unto old Samuel he gave,<br> But thereby failed his life to save;<br> Who, not so old in years as sin,<br> Died ere the winter, and within<br> The minster choir was laid asleep,<br> With carven saints his head to keep.</p>  
 <p>   And so the days and years went by,<br> And still in great felicity<br> The King dwelt, wanting only this<br> A son wherewith to share his bliss,<br> And reign when he was dead and gone.<br> Nor had he daughter, save that one<br> Born on the night when Michael first,<br> Forlorn, alone, and doubly cursed,<br> Felt on him this world's bitter air.<br>    This daughter, midst fair maids most fair,<br> Was not yet wed, though at this time,<br> Being come unto her maiden's prime,<br> She looked upon her eighteenth May. <a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a><br>    Midst this her mother passed away,<br> Not much lamented of the King,<br> Who had the thought of marrying<br> Some dame more fertile, and who sent<br> A wily man with this intent<br> To spy the countries out and find<br> Some great king's daughter, wise and kind,<br> And fresh, and fair, in face and limb,<br> In all things a fit mate for him.<br>    So in short time it came to pass<br> Again the King well wedded was,<br> And hoped once more to have a son.<br>    And when this fair dame he had won,<br> A year in peace he dwelt with her,<br> Until the time was drawing near<br> When first his eyes beheld that foe<br> He deemed was dead these years ago.<br> Now at that time, as custom was,<br> His daughter was about to pass<br> Unto a distant house of his,<br> Some king had built for worldly bliss<br> In ancient days: there, far removed<br> From courts or towns, the dame he loved<br> The dead king had been wont to see<br> Play mid the summer greenery,<br> Or like Erigone of old<br> Stand in the vineyards girt with gold,<br> To queen it oer the vintagers,<br> Half worshipping that face of hers. <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a><br> Long years agone these folk were passed,<br> Their crimes forgotten, or else cast<br> Into the glowing crucible<br> Of time, that tempers all things well,<br> That maketh pleasure out of pain,<br> And out of ruin golden gain;<br> Nathless, unshaken still, there stood<br> The towers and ramparts red as blood;<br> Wherein their lives had passed away;<br> And still the lovely gardens lay<br> About them, changed, but smiling still,<br> As in past time, on good or ill.<br>    Thither the Princess Cecily<br> Must go awhile in peace to be;<br> For now, midst care, and doubt, and toil,<br> Proud words drawn back, and half-healed broil,<br> The King had found one meet to wed<br> His daughter, of great godlihead,<br> Wealth, and unbroken royalty.<br> And now he said to her, when she<br> Was setting out for that fair place,<br> "O daughter, thou shalt see my face<br> Before a month is fully gone,<br> Nor wilt thou see me then alone;<br> For that man shall be with me then,<br> Whom I have chosen from all men<br> To give my dearest treasure to.<br> Most fain he is to look on you,<br> Nor needst thou fear him for thy part, <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a><br> Who holdeth many a woman's heart<br> As the net holds the silvery fish.<br> Farewelland all things thou mayst wish<br> I pray God grant thee."<br>                           Therewithal<br> He kissed her, and from out the hall<br> She passed, not shamefaced, or afraid<br> Of what might happen; though, indeed,<br> Her heart of no man's heart had need<br> To make her happy as she thought.</p>  
 <p>   Ever the new sun daily brought<br> Fresh joy of life to her bedside,<br> The world before her open wide<br> Was spread, a place for joy and bliss.<br> Her lips had trembled with no kiss,<br> Wherewith love slayeth fear and shame;<br> Her grey eyes conscious of no blame,<br> Beheld unmoved the eyes of men;<br> Her hearing grew no dimmer when<br> Some unused footstep she might hear;<br> And unto no man was she dear,<br> But as some goddess might have been<br> When Greek men worshipped many a queen.</p>  
 <p>   Now with her armed folk forth she rode<br> Unto that ancient fair abode,<br> And while the lark sung oer the corn,<br> Love gilded not the waning morn; <a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a><br> And when the sun rose high above,<br> High thoughts she thought, but not of love;<br> And when that sun the world did leave,<br> He left no love to light the eve.<br> The moon no melancholy brought,<br> The dawn no vain, remorseful thought.<br> But all untroubled her sweet face<br> Passed neath the gate of that old place,<br> And there her bridegroom she abode.</p>  
 <p>   But scarce was she upon the road<br> Ere news unto the King was brought<br> That Peter, the old abbot, sought<br> To see him, having newly come<br> From the wild place that was his home<br> Across the forest; so the King<br> Bade him to enter, well willing<br> To hear what he might have to say;<br> Who, entering the hall straightway,<br> Had with him an old, reverend man,<br> The Sub-prior, father Adrian,<br> And five monks more, and therewithal<br> Ten of his folk, stout men and tall,<br> Who bore armed staves and coats of fence.<br>    So, when he came to audience,<br> He prayed the King of this or that,<br> Whereof my tale-teller forgat,<br> And graciously the King heard all,<br> And said at last, "Well, what may fall, <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a><br> Thou gost not hence, fair lord, to-day;<br> Unless in vain a king must pray,<br> Thou and thy monks shall eat with me;<br> While feast thine axe-men merrily."<br>    Withal, he eyed the abbot's folk<br> In careless mood, then once more spoke,<br> "Tall men thou feedest, by the rood!<br> Lord Abbot, come they from the wood?<br> Dwell many more such thereabout?<br> Fain were I such should swell the shout<br> When I am armed, and rank meets rank."<br>    But as he spoke his loud voice sank<br> Wavering, nor heard he aught at all<br> Of the faint noises of the hall,<br> Or what the monk in answer said;<br> For, looking from a steel-clad head,<br> Those eyes again did he behold,<br> That erst from neath the locks of gold<br> Kindly and bold, but soft with awe,<br> Beneath the apple-boughs he saw.<br>    But when for sure this thing he knew<br> Pale to the very lips he grew.<br> Till gathering heart within a while<br> With the faint semblance of a smile,<br> He seemed to note the Abbot's words<br> That he heard not; then from the lords<br> He turned, and facing Michael said,<br> "Raise up the steel cap from thine head,<br> That I may see if thou lookst bold; <a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a><br> Methinks, I know thy face of old,<br> Whence comst thou?<br>                            Michael lifted straight<br> From off his brow the steel cap's weight,<br> And showed the bright locks curling round<br> His fresh and ruddy face, sun-browned,<br> And in a voice clear as a bell,<br> Told all his story, till he fell<br> Sore wounded in that dismal vale;<br> And said withal, "My lord, the tale<br> Of what came after, none knoweth<br> Better than he, who, from ill death<br> Saved me that tide, and made me man,<br> My lord, the sub-prior Adrian."<br>    "Speak on then, father," quoth the King,<br> Making as he was still hearkening.<br> "My lord," said Adrian, "I, who then<br> Was but a server of poor men,<br> Outside our Abbey walls, one day<br> Was called by one in poor array,<br> A charcoal-burner's lad, who said.<br> That soon his father would be dead,<br> And that of all things he would have<br> His rights, that he his soul might save.<br> I made no tarrying at that word,<br> But took between mine hands the Lord,<br> And bade the boy bear forth the bell<br> For though few folk there were to tell.<br> Who passed that way, nathless, I trow <a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a><br> The beasts were glad that news to know.<br>    "Well, by the pinewood's skirts we went<br> While through its twilight the bell sent<br> A heavenly tinkling; but the lad<br> Gan telling me of fears he had<br> Of elves who dwell within the wood.<br> I chid him thereat, as was good,<br> Bidding him note Whom in mine hands<br> I held, The Ransom of all Lands.<br> But as the firwood's dim twilight<br> Waxed into day, and fair and bright<br> The evening sun showed through the trees,<br> Our ears fanned by the evening breeze,<br> The galloping of horse-hoofs heard,<br> Wherewith my page hung back afeard<br> Of elves and such-like; but I said,<br> 'Wilt thou thy father shouldst be dead<br> Ere we can reach him? Oh my son,<br> Fear not that aught can stay This One.'<br>    "Therewith I smote my mule, and he<br> Ran forward with me hastily<br> As fearing to be left behind.<br> Well, as we went, what should we find<br> Down by the stream, but this my son,<br> Who seemed as though his days were done;<br> For in his side a knife there stood<br> Wherefrom ran out a stream of blood,<br> Soaking the grass and water-mint;<br> Then, I dismounting, we by dint <a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 184</font></a><br> Of all our strength, the poor youth laid<br> Upon my mule, and down a glade<br> Of oaks and hollies then we passed,<br> And reached the woodman's home at last;<br> A poor hut, built of wattled wood,<br> And by its crooked gable stood<br> A ruinous shed, unroofed and old<br> That beasts of burden once did hold.<br> Thyself; my lord, mayst know it well,<br> Since thereabout the wild swine dwell;<br> And hart, and hind, and roe are there<br> So the lad's wounds I staunched with care<br> Forthwith, and then the man I shrived,<br> Who none the less got well and lived<br> For many a day: then back I went<br> And the next day our leech I sent<br> With drugs to tend upon the lad.<br> Who soon was as he neer had had<br> A hurt at all: and he being well<br> We took him in our house to dwell,<br> And taught him letters, and, indeed,<br> Before long, Latin could he read<br> As well as I; but hath no will<br> To turn unto religion still.<br> Yet is he good and doth no wrong;<br> And being thereto both hale and strong,<br> My lord, the Abbot, sayeth of him,<br> 'He shall serve God with heart and limb,<br> Not heart and voice.' Therefore, my lord, <a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a><br> Thou seest him armed with spear and sword<br> For their defence who feed him still,<br> Teach him, and guard his soul from ill.<br> Ho, Michael! hast thou there with thee<br> The fair-wrought knife I first did see<br> Deep in thy side?there, show it now<br> Unto the King, that he may know<br> Our tale is not a fabled thing."<br>    Withal the King, as one listening,<br> With his thin, anxious face and pale,<br> Sat leaning forward through this tale,<br> Scarce noting here and there a word.<br> But all being told, at last he heard<br> His own voice changed, and harsh, and low,<br> That said, "Fair lord, I fain would know,<br> Since this your man at arms seems true,<br> What thing will he be worth to you;<br> For better had he wear my rose<br> Than loiter in your Abbey-close,<br> Poring oer books no man can read."<br>    "O sire!" the monk said, "if your need<br> Be great of such men, let him go;<br> My men-at-arms need make no show<br> Of fairness, nor should ladies miss,<br> Een as thou sayst, such men as this."<br>    Laughing he spoke; the King the while,<br> His pale face puckering to a smile;<br> Then, as in some confused dream,<br> In Michael's hand he saw the gleam <a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186</font></a><br> Of that same steel remembered well,<br> The gift he gave to Samuel;<br> Drawn from his father's ancient chest<br> To do that morn his own behest.<br> And as he now beheld its sheen,<br> The twining stem of gold and green,<br> The white scroll with the letters black,<br> <i>Strike! for no dead man cometh back!</i><br> He hardened yet his heart once more,<br> And grown unhappy as before,<br> When last he had that face in sight,<br> Brought now the third time to the light,<br> Once more grew treacherous, fierce, and fell.<br>    Now was the Abbot feasted well<br> With all his folk, then went away,<br> But Michael clad in rich array<br> Became the king's man, and was thought.<br> By all most happy to be brought<br> Unto such hopeful fair estate.</p>  
 <p>   For ten days yet the King did wait,<br> Which past, for Michael did he send,<br> And he being come, said to him, "Friend,<br> Take now this letter from my hand<br> And go unto our southern land;<br> My captain Hugh shall go with thee<br> For one day's journey, then shall he<br> Tell thee which way thou hast to ride;<br> The third day thence about noontide <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a><br> If thou dost well, thou shouldst be close<br> Unto my Castle of the Rose<br> Where dwells my daughter; needs it is<br> That no man living should see this<br> Until that thou within my wall<br> Hast given it to the seneschal;<br> Be wise and wary then, that thou<br> Mayst think of this that happeneth now<br> As birthday to thine high estate."<br>    So said he, knowing not that fate<br> Was dealing otherwise than he.<br>    But Michael going, presently<br> Met Hugh, a big man rough and black,<br> And who of nought but words had lack,<br> With him he mounted, and set forth<br> And daylong rode on from the north.<br>    Now if the King had hope that Hugh<br> Some deed like Samuel's might do<br> I know not, certes nought he said<br> To that hard heart and narrow head,<br> Who knew no wiles but wiles of war,<br> And was as true as such men are;<br> Yet had there been a tale to tell<br> If Michael had not held him well,<br> And backward still the wrath had turned<br> Wherewith his heart not seldom burned<br> At scornful words his fellow said.<br>    At last they reached cross ways that led<br> One west, one southward still, whereat <a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a><br> Hugh, taking off his feathered hat,<br> Bowed low in scorn, and said, "Fair sir,<br> Unto the westward must I spur,<br> While you go southward, soon to get<br> I doubt not, an earl's coronet;<br> Farewell, my lord, and yet beware<br> Thou dost not at my lady stare<br> Too hard, lest thou shouldst plumb the moat,<br> Or have a halter round thy throat."<br>    But Michael to his scoff said nought,<br> But upon high things set his thought<br> As his departing hooves he heard.<br> And still betwixt the hedgerows spurred,<br> And when, the twilight was oerpast<br> At a small inn drew rein at last,<br> And slept that night as such folk can;<br> And while next morn the thrushes ran<br> Their first course through the autumn dew<br> The gossamers did he dash through,<br> And on his way rode steadily<br> The live-long day, nor yet was he<br> Alone, as well might be that day<br> Since a fair town was in his way,<br> Stout hinds he passed, and yeomen good,<br> Some friar in his heavy hood,<br> And well-coifed housewives mounted high<br> Above their maunds, while merrily<br> The well-shod damsel trudged along<br> Beside them, sending forth some song <a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a><br> As little taught as is a bird's;<br> And good men, good wives, priests, and herds,<br> And merry maids failed not to send<br> Good wishes for his journey's end<br> Unto him as still on he sped,<br> Free from all evil thoughts or dread.</p>  
 <p>   Withal again the day went by,<br> And in that city's hostelry<br> He slept, and by the dawn of day<br> Next morn again was on his way,<br> And leaving the scarce wakened street<br> The newly risen sun did greet<br> With cheerful heart. His way wound on<br> Still up and up till he had won<br> Up to a great hill's chalky brow,<br> Whence looking back he saw below<br> The town spread out, church, square, and street,<br> And baily, crawling up the feet<br> Of the long yew-besprinkled hill;<br> And in the fragrant air and still,<br> Seeming to gain new life from it,<br> The doves from roof to roof did flit:<br> The early fires sent up their smoke<br> That seemed to him to tell of folk<br> New wakened unto great delight:<br> For he upon that morning bright,<br> So joyous felt, so free from pain,<br> He seemed as he were born again <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a><br> Into some new immortal state<br> That knew no envy, fear, or hate.<br>    Now the road turned to his left hand<br> And led him through a table-land,<br> Windy and barren of all grain;<br> But where a hollow specked the plain<br> The yew-trees hugged the sides of it,<br> And mid them did the woodlark flit<br> Or sang well-sheltered from the wind,<br> And all about the sheep did find<br> Sweet grass, the while the shepherd's song<br> Rang clear as Michael sped along.<br>    Long time he rode, till suddenly,<br> When now the sun was broad and high,<br> From out a hollow where the yew<br> Still guarded patches of the dew,<br> He found at last that he had won<br> That highland's edge, and gazed upon<br> A valley that beneath the haze<br> Of that most fair of autumn days,<br> Showed glorious; fair with golden sheaves,<br> Rich with the darkened autumn-leaves,<br> Gay with the water-meadows green,<br> The bright blue streams that lay between,<br> The miles of beauty stretched away<br> From that bleak hill-side bare and grey,<br> Till white cliffs over slopes of vine,<br> Drew gainst the sky a broken line.<br> And twixt the vineyards and the stream <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a><br> Michael saw gilded spirelets gleam;<br> For, hedged with many a flowery close,<br> There lay the Castle of the Rose,<br> His hurried journey's aim and end.</p>  
 <p>   Then downward he began to wend,<br> And twixt the flowery hedges sweet<br> He heard the hook smite down the wheat,<br> And murmur of the unseen folk;<br> But when he reached the stream that broke<br> The golden plain, but leisurely<br> He passed the bridge, for he could see<br> The masters of that ripening realm,<br> Cast down beneath an ancient elm<br> Upon a little strip of grass,<br> From hand to hand the pitcher pass,<br> While on the turf beside them lay<br> The ashen-handled sickles grey,<br> The matters of their cheer between:<br> Slices of white cheese, specked with green,<br> And greenstriped onions and ryebread,<br> And summer apples faintly red,<br> Even beneath the crimson skin;<br> And yellow grapes, well ripe and thin,<br> Plucked from the cottage gable-end.</p>  
 <p>   And certes Michael felt their friend<br> Hearing their voices, nor forgot<br> His boyhood and the pleasant spot <a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a><br> Beside the well-remembered stream;<br> And friendly did this water seem<br> As through its white-flowered weeds it ran<br> Bearing good things to beast and man.<br>    Yea, as the parapet he passed,<br> And they a greeting toward him cast,<br> Once more he felt a boy again;<br> As though beneath the harvest wain<br> He was asleep, by that old stream,<br> And all these things were but a dream<br> The King, the squire, the hurrying ride<br> Unto the lonely quagmire side;<br> The sudden pain, the deadly swoon,<br> The feverish life from noon to noon;<br> The tending of the kind old man,<br> The black and white Dominican,<br> The hour before the abbot's throne,<br> The poring oer old books alone,<br> In summer morn; the King again,<br> The envious greetings of strange men,<br> This mighty horse and rich array,<br> This journey on an unknown way.<br>    Surely he thought to wake from it,<br> And once more by the waggon sit,<br> Blinking upon the sunny mill.<br>    But not for either good or ill<br> Shall he see one of all those days;<br> On through the quivering noontide haze<br> He rode, and now on either hand <a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a><br> Heavy with fruit the trees did stand;<br> Nor had he ridden long, ere he<br> The red towers of the house could see<br> Grey on the wind-beat southern side:<br> And soon the gates thrown open wide<br> He saw, the long-fixed drawbridge down,<br> The moat, with lilies overgrown,<br> Midst which the gold-scaled fishes lay:<br> Such peace was there for many a day.<br>    And deep within the archway's shade<br> The warder on his cloak was laid,<br> Dozing, one hand upon a harp.<br> And nigh him a great golden carp<br> Lay stiff with all his troubles done,<br> Drawn from the moat ere yet the sun<br> Was high, and nigh him was his bane,<br> An angling rod of Indian cane.<br>    Now hearing Michael's horse-hooves smite<br> The causeway, shading from the light<br> His eyes, as one scarce yet awake,<br> He made a shift his spear to take,<br> And, eyeing Michael's badge the while,<br> Rose up, and with a lazy smile,<br> Said, "Ho! fair sir, abide, abide,<br> And show why hitherward ye ride<br> Unto my lady's royal home."<br> Said Michael, "From the king I come,<br> As by my badge ye well may see;<br> And letters have I here with me <a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a><br> To give my lord the Seneschal."<br>    "Yea," said the man, "But in the hall<br> He feasteth now; what haste is there,<br> Certes full quickly cometh care;<br> And sure I am he will not read<br> Thy letters, or to aught give heed<br> Till he has played out all the play,<br> And every guest has gone away;<br> So thou, O damoiseau, must wait;<br> Tie up thine horse anigh the gate,<br> And sit with me, and thou shalt hear<br> <i>The Kaiser lieth on his bier</i>.<br> Thou laughesthast thou never heard<br> Of this same valorous Red Beard,<br> And how he died? well, I can sing<br> Of many another dainty thing,<br> Thou wilt not a long while forget,<br> The budget is not empty yet.<br> Peter! I think thou mockest me,<br> But thou art young and fair perdie,<br> I wish thee luckwell, thou mayest go<br> And feel the afternoon wind blow<br> Within Dame Bertha's pleasance here;<br> She who was held so lief and dear,<br> All this was built but for her sake,<br> Who made the hearts of men to ache;<br> And dying full of years and shame<br> Yet left an unforgotten name<br> God rest her soul!" <a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a><br>                     Michael the while<br> Hearkened his talking with a smile,<br> Then said, "O friend, I think to hear<br> Both '<i>The King lieth on his bier</i>'<br> And many another song of thee,<br> Ere I depart; but now show me<br> The pleasance of the ancient queen,<br> For these red towers above the green<br> Show like the gates of paradise,<br> That surely somewhere through them lies."<br>    Then said the warder, "That may be<br> If thou knowst what may come to thee<br> When past the drawbridge thou hast gone,<br> Upon the left three steps of stone<br> Lead to a path beneath the wall<br> Of the great court, that folk now call<br> The falconer's path, nor canst thou miss<br> Going thereby, to find the bliss<br> Thou lookst for, since the path ends there,<br> And through a wicket gilded fair<br> The garden lies where thou wouldst be<br> Nor will I fail to come to thee<br> Wheneer my Lord the Seneschal<br> Shall pass well fed from out the hall."<br>    Then Michael, thanking him, passed on,<br> And soon the gilded wicket won,<br> And entered that pleasance sweet,<br> And wandered there with wary feet<br> And open mouth, as though he deemed <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a><br> That in some lovely dream he dreamed,<br> And feared to wake to common day,<br> So fair was all; and een decay<br> Brought there but pensive loveliness,<br> Where autumn those old walls did bless<br> With wealth of fruit, and through the grass<br> Unscared the spring-born thrush did pass,<br> Who yet knew nought of winter-tide.<br>    So wandering, to a fountain's side<br> He came, and oer the basin hung,<br> Watching the fishes, as he sung<br> Some song remembered from of old,<br> Ere yet the miller won that gold.<br> But soon made drowsy with his ride,<br> And the warm hazy autumn-tide,<br> And many a musical sweet sound,<br> He cast him down upon the ground,<br> And watched the glittering water leap,<br> Still singing low, nor thought to sleep.<br>    But scarce three minutes had gone by<br> Before, as if in mockery,<br> The starling chattered oer his head,<br> And nothing he remembered,<br> Nor dreamed of aught that he had seen.</p>  
 <p>   Meanwhile unto that garden green<br> Had come the Princess, and with her<br> A maiden that she held right dear,<br> Who knew the inmost of her mind. <a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a><br> Now those twain, as the scented wind<br> Played with their raiment or their hair,<br> Had late been running here and there,<br> Chasing each other merrily,<br> As maids do, thinking no one by;<br> But now, well wearied therewithal,<br> Had let their gathered garments fall<br> About their feet, and slowly went:<br> And through the leaves a murmur sent,<br> As of two happy doves that sing<br> The soft returning of the spring.<br>    Now of these twain the Princess spoke<br> The less, but into laughter broke<br> Not seldom, and would redden oft,<br> As on her lips her fingers soft<br> She laid, as still the other maid,<br> Half grave, half smiling, follies said.<br>    So in their walk they drew anigh<br> That fountain in the midst, whereby<br> Lay Michael sleeping, dreaming nought<br> Of such fair things so nigh him brought;<br> They, when the fountain shaft was past,<br> Beheld him on the ground down-cast,<br> And stopped at first, until the maid<br> Stepped lightly forward to the shade,<br> And when she had gazed there awhile<br> Came running back again, a smile<br> Parting her lips, and her bright eyes<br> Afire with many fantasies; <a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a><br> And ere the Lady Cecily<br> Could speak a word, "Hush! hush!" said she;<br> "Did I not say that he would come<br> To woo thee in thy peaceful home<br> Before thy father brought him here?<br> Come, and behold him, have no fear!<br> The great bell would not wake him now,<br> Right in his ears."<br>                     "Nay, what dost thou?"<br> The Princess said; "Let us go hence;<br> Thou knowst I give obedience<br> To what my father bids; but I<br> A maid full fain would live and die,<br> Since I am born to be a queen."<br>    "Yea, yea, for such as thou hast seen,<br> That may be well," the other said.<br> "But come now, come; for by my head<br> This one must be from Paradise;<br> Come swiftly then, if thou art wise<br> Ere aught can snatch him back again."<br>    She caught her hand, and not in vain<br> She prayed; for now some kindly thought<br> To Cecily's brow fair colour brought,<br> And quickly gan her heart to beat<br> As love drew near those eyes to greet,<br> Who knew him not till that sweet hour.</p>  
 <p>   So over the fair, pink-edged flower,<br> Softly she stepped; but when she came <a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a><br> Anigh the sleeper, lovely shame<br> Cast a soft mist before her eyes<br> Full filled of many fantasies.<br> But when she saw him lying there<br> She smiled to see her mate so fair;<br> And in her heart did Love begin<br> To tell his tale, nor thought she sin<br> To gaze on him that was her own,<br> Not doubting he was come alone<br> To woo her, whom midst arms and gold<br> She deemed she should at first behold;<br> And with that thought love grew again<br> Until departing was a pain,<br> Though fear grew with that growing love;<br> And with her lingering footsteps strove<br> As from the place she turned to go,<br> Sighing and murmuring words full low.<br> But as her raiment's hem she raised,<br> And for her merry fellow gazed<br> Shamefaced and changed, she met her eyes<br> Turned grave and sad with ill surprise;<br> Who while the princess mazed did stand<br> Had drawn from Michael's loosened band<br> The king's scroll, which she held out now<br> To Cecily, and whispered low,<br> "Read, and do quickly what thou wilt,<br> Sad, sad! such fair life to be spilt:<br> Come further first."<br>                          With that they stepped <a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a><br> A pace or two from where he slept,<br> And then she read,<br>                     "Lord Seneschal,<br> On thee and thine may all good fall;<br> Greeting hereby the king sendeth,<br> And biddeth thee to put to death<br> His enemy who beareth this;<br> And as thou lovest life and bliss,<br> And all thy goods thou holdest dear,<br> Set thou his head upon a spear<br> A good half furlong from the gate,<br> Our coming hitherward to wait<br> So perish the King's enemies!"<br>    She read, and scarcely had her eyes<br> Seen clear her father's name and seal,<br> Ere all love's power her heart did feel,<br> That drew her back in spite of shame,<br> To him who was not een a name<br> Unto her a short hour agone.<br> Panting she said, "Wait thou alone<br> Beside him, watch him carefully<br> And let him sleep if none draw nigh:<br> If of himself he waketh, then<br> Hide him until I come again,<br> When thou hast told him of the snare<br> If thou betrayest me beware!<br> For death shall be the least of all<br> The ills that on thine head shall fall<br> What say I, thou art dear to me, <a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a><br> And doubly dear now shalt thou be,<br> Thou shalt have power and majesty,<br> And be more queen in all than I<br> Few words are best, be wise, be wise!"</p>  
 <p>   Withal she turned about her eyes<br> Once more, and swiftly as a man<br> Betwixt the garden trees she ran,<br> Until, her own bower reached at last,<br> She made good haste, and quickly passed<br> Unto her secret treasury.<br> There, hurrying since the time was nigh<br> For folk to come from meat, she took<br> From twixt the leaves of a great book<br> A royal scroll, signed, sealed, but blank,<br> Then, with a hand that never shrank<br> Or trembled, she the scroll did fill<br> With these words, writ with clerkly skill,<br> "Unto the Seneschal, Sir Rafe,<br> Who holdeth our fair castle safe,<br> Greeting and health! O well-beloved,<br> Know that at this time we are moved<br> To wed our daughter, so we send<br> Him who bears this, our perfect friend,<br> To be her bridegroom; so do thou<br> Ask nought of him, since well we know<br> His race and great nobility,<br> And how he is most fit to be<br> Our son; therefore snake no delay, <a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a><br> But wed the twain upon the day<br> Thou readest this: and see that all<br> Take oath to him, whateer shall fall<br> To do his bidding as our heir;<br> So doing still be lief and dear<br> As I have held thee yet to be."<br>    She cast the pen down hastily<br> At that last letter, for she heard<br> How even now the people stirred<br> Within the hall: nor dared she think<br> What bitter potion she must drink<br> If now she failed, so falsely bold<br> That life or death did she enfold<br> Within its cover, making shift<br> To seal it with her father's gift,<br> A signet of cornelian.</p>  
 <p>   Then swiftly down the stairs she ran<br> And reached the garden; but her fears<br> Brought shouts and thunder to her ears,<br> That were but lazy words of men<br> Full-fed, far off; nay, even when<br> Her limbs caught up her flying gown<br> The noise seemed loud enough to drown<br> The twitter of the autumn birds,<br> And her own muttered breathless words<br> That to her heart seemed loud indeed.<br>    Yet therewithal she made good speed<br> And reached the fountain seen of none <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a><br> Where yet abode her friend alone,<br> Watching the sleeper, who just now<br> Turned in his sleep and muttered low.<br> Therewith fair Agnes saying nought<br> From out her hand the letter caught;<br> And while she leaned against the stone<br> Stole up to Michael's side alone,<br> And with a cool, unshrinking hand<br> Thrust the new scroll deep in his band,<br> And turned about unto her friend;<br> Who having come unto the end<br> Of all her courage, trembled there<br> With face upturned for fresher air,<br> And parted lips grown grey and pale,<br> And limbs that now began to fail,<br> And hands wherefrom all strength had gone,<br> Scarce fresher than the blue-veined stone<br> That feeble still she strove to clutch.<br>    But when she felt her lady's touch,<br> Feebly she said, "Go! let me die<br> And end this sudden misery<br> That in such wise has wrapped my life,<br> I am too weak for such a strife,<br> So sick I am with shame and fear;<br> Would thou hadst never brought me here!"<br>    But Agnes took her hand and said,<br> "Nay, queen, and must we three be dead<br> Because thou fearest; all is safe<br> If boldly thou wilt face Sir Rafe." <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a><br>    So saying, did she draw her hence,<br> Past tree and bower, and high pleached fence<br> Unto the garden's further end,<br> And left her there and back did wend,<br> And from the house made haste to get<br> A gilded maund wherein she set<br> A flask of ancient island wine,<br> Ripe fruits and wheaten manchets fine,<br> And many such a delicate<br> As goddesses in old time ate,<br> Ere Helen was a Trojan queen;<br> So passing through the garden green<br> She cast her eager eyes again<br> Upon the spot where he had lain,<br> But found it empty, so sped on<br> Till she at last the place had won<br> Where Cecily lay weak and white<br> Within that fair bower of delight.<br>    Her straight she made to eat and drink,<br> And said, "See now thou dost not shrink<br> From this thy deed; let love slay fear<br> Now, when thy life shall grow so dear,<br> Each minute should seem loss to thee<br> If thou for thy felicity<br> Couldst stay to count them; for I say,<br> This day shall be thy happy day."<br>    Therewith she smiled to see the wine<br> Embraced by her fingers fine;<br> And her sweet face grow bright again <a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a><br> With sudden pleasure after pain.<br>    Again she spoke, "What is this word<br> That dreaming, I perchance, have heard,<br> But certainly remember well;<br> That some old soothsayer did tell<br> Strange things unto my lord, the King,<br> That on thy hand the spousal ring<br> No Kaiser's son, no King should set,<br> But one a peasant did beget<br> What sayst thou?"<br>                        But the Queen flushed red;<br> "Such fables I have heard," she said;<br> "And thouis it such scathe to me,<br> The bride of such a man to be?"<br>    "Nay," said she, "God will have him King;<br> How shall we do a better thing<br> With this or that one than He can;<br> God's friend must be a goodly man."<br>    But with that word she heard the sound<br> Of folk who through the mazes wound<br> Bearing the message; then she said,<br> "Be strong, pluck up thine hardihead,<br> Speak little, so shall all be well,<br> For now our own tale will they tell."</p>  
 <p>   And even as she spoke they came<br> And all the green place was aflame<br> With golden raiment of the lords;<br> While Cecily, noting not their words, <a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a><br> Rose up to go; and for her part<br> By this had fate so steeled her heart,<br> Scarce otherwise she seemed, than when<br> She passed before the eyes of men<br> At Tourney or high festival.<br> But when they now had reached the hall,<br> And up its very steps they went,<br> Her head a little down she bent;<br> Nor raised it till the dais was gained<br> For fear that love some monster feigned<br> To be a god, and she should be<br> Smit by her own bolt wretchedly.<br> But at the rustling, crowded dais<br> She gathered heart her eyes to raise,<br> And there beheld her love, indeed,<br> Clad in her father's serving weed,<br> But proud, and flushed, and calm withal,<br> Fearless of aught that might befal,<br> Nor too astonied, for he thought,<br> "From point to point my life is brought<br> Through wonders till it comes to this;<br> And trouble cometh after bliss,<br> And I will bear all as I may,<br> And ever as day passeth day,<br> My life will hammer from the twain,<br> Forging a long enduring chain."<br>    But midst these thoughts their young eyes met,<br> And every word did he forget<br> Wherewith men name unhappiness, <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a><br> As read again those words did bless<br> With double blessings his glad ears,<br> And if she trembled with her fears,<br> And if with doubt, and love, and shame,<br> The rosy colour went and came<br> In her sweet cheeks and smooth bright brow,<br> Little did folk think of it now,<br> But as of maiden modesty,<br> Shamefaced to see the bridegroom nigh.<br>    And now when Rafe the Seneschal<br> Had read the message down the Hall,<br> And turned to her, quite calm again,<br> Her face had grown, and with no pain<br> She raised her serious eyes to his<br> Grown soft and pensive with his bliss,<br> And said,<br>               "Prince, thou art welcome here,<br> Where all my father loves is dear,<br> And full trust do I put in thee,<br> For that so great nobility<br> He knoweth in thee; be as kind<br> As I would be to thee, and find<br> A happy life from day to day,<br> Till all our days are past away."<br>    What more than found the bystanders<br> He found within this speech of hers,<br> I know not; some faint quivering<br> In the last words; some little thing<br> That checked the cold words even flow. <a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a><br> But yet they set his heart aglow,<br> And he in turn said eagerly:<br>    "Surely I count it nought to die<br> For him who brought me unto this;<br> For thee, who givest me this bliss;<br> Yea, even dost me such a grace<br> To look with kind eyes in my face,<br> And send sweet music to my ears."<br>    But at his words she, mazed with tears,<br> Seemed faint, and failing quickly, when<br> Above the low hum of the men<br> Uprose the sweet bells sudden clang,<br> As men unto the chapel rang;<br> While just outside the singing folk<br> Into most heavenly carols broke.<br> And going softly up the hall<br> Boys bore aloft the verges tall<br> Before the bishop's gold-clad head.<br>    Then forth his bride young Michael led,<br> And nought to him seemed good or bad<br> Except the lovely hand he had;<br> But she the while was murmuring low,<br> "If he could know, if he could know,<br> What love, what love, his love should be!"</p>  
 <p>   But while mid mirth and minstrelsy<br> The ancient Castle of the Rose<br> Such pageant to the autumn shows<br> The King sits ill at ease at home, <a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a><br> For in these days the news is come<br> That he who in his line should wed,<br> Lies in his own town stark and dead,<br> Slain in a tumult in the street.<br>    Brooding on this he deemed it meet,<br> Since nigh the day was come, when she<br> Her bridegroom's visage looked to see,<br> To hold the settled day with her.<br> And bid her at the least to wear<br> Dull mourning guise for gold and white.<br> So on another morning bright,<br> When the whole promised month was past,<br> He drew anigh the place at last<br> Where Michael's dead head, looking down<br> Upon the highway with a frown,<br> He doubted not at last to see.<br> So twixt the fruitful greenery<br> He rode, scarce touched by care the while,<br> Humming a roundel with a smile.<br>    Withal, ere yet he drew anigh,<br> He heard their watch-horn sound from high<br> Nor wondered, for their wont was so,<br> And well his banner they might know<br> Amidst the stubble lands afar:<br> But now a distant point of war<br> He seemed to hear, and bade draw rein,<br> But listening cried, "Push on again!<br> They do but send forth minstrelsy<br> Because my daughter thinks to see <a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a><br> The man who lieth on his bier."<br> So on they passed, till sharp and clear<br> They heard the pipe and shrill fife sound;<br> And restlessly the King glanced round<br> To see that he had striven for,<br> The crushing of that sage's lore,<br> The last confusion of that fate.<br>    But drawn still nigher to the gate<br> They turned a sharp bend of the road,<br> And saw the pageant that abode<br> The solemn coming of the King.</p>  
 <p>   For first on each side, maids did sing,<br> Dressed in gold raiment; then there came<br> The minstrels in their coats of flame;<br> And then the many-coloured lords,<br> The knights spears, and the swordmen's swords,<br> Backed by the glittering wood of bills.<br>    So now, presaging many ills,<br> The King drew rein, yet none the less<br> He shrank not from his hardiness,<br> But thought, "Well, at the worst I die,<br> And yet perchance long life may lie<br> Before meI will hold my peace;<br> The dumb man's borders still increase."<br>    But as he strengthened thus his heart<br> He saw the crowd before him part,<br> And down the long melodious lane,<br> Hand locked in hand there passed the twain, <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a><br> As fair as any earth has found,<br> Clad as king's children are, and crowned.<br> Behind them went the chiefest lords,<br> And two old knights with sheathed swords<br> The banners of the kingdom bore.<br>    But now the King had pondered sore,<br> By when they reached him, though, indeed,<br> The time was short unto his need,<br> Betwixt his heart's first startled pang<br> And those old banner-bearers clang<br> Anigh his saddle-bow: but he<br> Across their heads scowled heavily,<br> Not saying aught awhile: at last,<br> Ere any glance at them he cast,<br> He said, "Whence come ye? what are ye?<br> What play is this ye play to me?"<br>    None answered,Cecily, faint and white,<br> The rather Michael's hand clutched tight,<br> And seemed to speak, but not one word<br> The nearest to her could have heard.<br> Then the King spoke again,"Sir Rafe,<br> Meseems this youngling came here safe<br> A week agone?"<br>                      "Yea, sir," he said;<br> "Therefore the twain I straight did wed,<br> Een as thy letters bound me to."<br> "And thus thou diddest well to do,"<br> The King said. "Tell me on what day<br> Her old life she did put away." <a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a><br>    "Sire, the eleventh day this is<br> Since that they gained their earthly bliss;"<br> Quoth old Sir Rafe. The King said nought,<br> But with his head bowed down in thought,<br> Stood a long while; but at the last<br> Upward a smiling face he cast,<br> And cried aloud above the folk,<br> "Shout for the joining of the yoke<br> Betwixt these twain; And thou, fair lord,<br> Who dost so well my every word,<br> Nor makest doubt of anything,<br> Wear thou the collar of thy King;<br> And a duke's banner, cut foursquare,<br> Henceforth shall men before thee bear<br> In tourney and in stricken field.<br>    "But this mine heir shall bear my shield,<br> Carry my banner, wear my crown,<br> Ride equal with me through my town,<br> Sit on the same step of the throne;<br> In nothing will I reign alone;<br> Nor be ye with him miscontent,<br> For that with little ornament<br> Of gold and folk to you he came;<br> For he is of an ancient name<br> That needeth not the clink of gold<br> The ancientest the world doth hold;<br> For in the fertile Asian land,<br> Where great Damascus now doth stand,<br> Ages agone his line was born, <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a><br> Ere yet men knew the gift of corn;<br> And there, anigh to Paradise,<br> His ancestors grew stout and wise;<br> And certes he from Asia bore<br> No little of their piercing lore.<br>    "Look then to have great happiness,<br> For every wrong shall he redress."</p>  
 <p>   Then did the people's shouting drown<br> His clatter as he leapt adown;<br> And taking in each hand a hand<br> Of the two lovers, now did stand<br> Betwixt them on the flower-strewn way,<br> And to himself meanwhile gan say,</p>  
 <p>   "How many an hour might I have been<br> Right merry in the gardens green;<br> How many a glorious day had I<br> Made happy with some victory;<br> What noble deeds I might have done,<br> What bright renown my deeds have won;<br> What blessings would have made me glad;<br> What little burdens had I had;<br> What calmness in the hope of praise;<br> What joy of well-accomplished days,<br> If I had let these things alone;<br> Nor sought to sit upon my throne<br> Like God between the cherubim.<br> But nowbut now, my days wax dim, <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a>.<br> And all this fairness have I tost<br> Unto the winds, and all have lost<br> For nought, for nought! yet will I strive<br> My little end of life to live;<br> Nor will I look behind me more,<br> Nor forward to the doubtful shore."</p>  
 <p>   With that he made the sign to turn,<br> And straight the autumn air did burn<br> With many a point of steel and gold;<br> And through the trees the carol rolled<br> Once more, until the autumn thrush<br> Far off gan twittering on his bush,<br> Made mindful of the long-lived spring.</p>  
 <p>   So mid sweet song and tabouring,<br> And shouts amid the apple-grove,<br> And soft caressing of his love,<br> Began the new King Michael's reign.<br> Nor will the poor folk see again<br> A king like him on any throne,<br> Or such good deeds to all men done:<br> For then, as saith the chronicle,<br> It was the time, as all men tell,<br> When scarce a man would stop to gaze<br> At gold crowns hung above the ways.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>  
 <p>HE ended; and midst those who heard were some<br> Who, midst his tale, half dreamed they were at home,<br> Round the great fire upon the winter night;<br> And, with the memory of the fresh delight<br> Wherewith they first had heard that story told,<br> Forgetting not they were grown weak and old,<br> Yet felt as if they had at least grown grey<br> Within the land left for so many a day.<br> He, with the gestures they were wont to see,<br> So told his tale, so strange with eld was he,<br> Just so he stammered, and in just such wise<br> He sighed, beginning fresh, as their young eyes,<br> Their ears, in happy days passed long ago,<br> Had ever noted other old men do,<br> When they, full filled with their quick-coming joys,<br> Would gaze on old folk as on carven toys.</p>  
 <p>   But he being silent, silently awhile<br> They mused on these things, masking with a smile<br> The vain regrets that in their hearts arose,<br> The while with eager talk the young folk chose<br> The parts that pleased them; but their elder hosts<br> Falling to talk, yet noted well the ghosts<br> Of old desires within their wasted eyes,<br> Till one by one the fresh-stirred memories,<br> So bitter-sweet, flickered and died away;<br> And as old men may do, whose hopes grew grey<br> Before their beards, they made a little mirth<br> Until the great moon rose upon the earth.</p>
