 <p>ACROSS the gap made by our English hinds,<br> Amidst the Roman's handiwork, behold<br> Far off the long-roofed church; the shepherd binds<br> The withy round the hurdles of his fold;<br> Down in the foss the river fed of old,<br> That through long lapse of time has grown to be<br> The little grassy valley that you see.</p>  
 <p>   Rest here awhile, not yet the eve is still,<br> The bees are wandering yet, and you may hear<br> The barley mowers on the trenched hill,<br> The sheep-bells, and the restless changing weir,<br> All little sounds made musical and clear<br> Beneath the sky that burning August gives,<br> While yet the thought of glorious Summer lives.</p>  
 <p>   Ah, love! such happy days, such days as these,<br> Must we still waste them, craving for the best,<br> Like lovers oer the painted images<br> Of those who once their yearning hearts have blessed?<br> Have we been happy on our day of rest?<br> Thine eyes say "yes,"but if it came again,<br> Perchance its ending would not seem so vain.</p>  
 <p> </p>

 <p>NOW came fulfillment of the year's desire,<br> The tall wheat, coloured by the August fire<br> Grew heavy-headed, dreading its decay,<br> And blacker grew the elm-trees day by day.<br> About the edges of the yellow corn,<br> And oer the gardens grown somewhat outworn<br> The bees went hurrying to fill up their store;<br> The apple-boughs bent over more and more;<br> With peach and apricot the garden wall,<br> Was odorous, and the pears began to fall<br> From off the high tree with each freshening breeze.<br>    So in a house bordered about with trees,<br> A little raised above the waving gold<br> The Wanderers heard this marvellous story told,<br> While twixt the gleaming flasks of ancient wine,<br> They watched the reapers slow advancing line.</p>
