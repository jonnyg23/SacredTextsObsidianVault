 <p>O FAIR midspring, besung so oft and oft,<br> How can I praise thy loveliness enow?<br> Thy sun that burns not, and thy breezes soft<br> That oer the blossoms of the orchard blow,<br> The thousand things that neath the young leaves grow,<br> The hopes and chances of the growing year,<br> Winter forgotten long, and summer near.</p>  
 <p>   When Summer brings the lily and the rose,<br> She brings us fear; her very death she brings<br> Hid in her anxious heart, the forge of woes;<br> And, dull with fear, no more the mavis sings.<br> But thou! thou diest not, but thy fresh life clings<br> About the fainting autumn's sweet decay,<br> When in' the earth the hopeful seed they lay.</p>  
 <p>   Ah! life of all the year, why yet do I<br> Amid thy snowy blossoms fragrant drift,<br> Still long for that which never draweth nigh,<br> Striving my pleasure from my pain to sift,<br> Some weight from off my fluttering mirth to lift?<br> Now, when far bells are ringing, "Come again,<br> Come back, past years! why will ye pass in vain?"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a></p>  
 <p>AND now the watery April sun lit up<br> Upon the fair board golden ewer and cup,<br> And over the bright silken tapestry<br> The fresh young boughs were gladdening every eye,<br> And round the board old faces you might see<br> Amidst the blossoms and their greenery.<br>    So when the flutes were silent, and the birds,<br> Rejoicing in their flood of unknown words,<br> Were heard again, a silken-fastened book<br> A certain elder from his raiment took,<br> And said, "O friends, few words are best to-day,<br> And no new thing I bring you; yet ye may<br> Be pleased to hear an ancient tale again,<br> That, told so long ago, doth yet remain<br> Fresh een mongst us, far from the Argive land:<br> Which tale this book, writ wholly by mine hand,<br> Holds gathered up as I have heard it told.<br>    "Surely I fear me, midst the ancient gold<br> Base metal ye will light on here and there,<br> Though I have noted everything with care,<br> And with good will have set down nothing new:<br> Nor holds the land another book for you<br> That has the tale in full with nought beside,<br> So unto me let your good word betide;<br> Though, take it as ye may, no small delight<br> I had, herein this well-loved tale to write."</p>
