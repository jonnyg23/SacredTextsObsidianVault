 This fantasy novel by William Morris is one of the first to have
 a central female character.
 The heroine, Birdalone, abducted and raised by a witch in the wood
 of Evilshaw, escapes her captivity with the assistance of a good witch.
 Habundia.
 Birdalone encounters three maidens held prisoner by another witch,
 and the quest to unite the maidens with their knightly lovers
 rounds out the tale.
