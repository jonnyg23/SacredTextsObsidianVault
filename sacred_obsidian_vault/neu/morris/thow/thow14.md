 <p align="center">CHAPTER XIII—THE HALL-SUN SAITH ANOTHER WORD</p>  
 <p>It was no later than the next night, and a many of what thralls were not with the host were about in the feast-hall with the elders and lads and weaklings of the House; for last night's tidings had drawn them thither. Gisli had gone back to his kindred and the wain-burg in the Upper-mark, and the women were sitting, most of them, in the Women's-Chamber, some of them doing what little summer work needed doing about the looms, but more resting from their work in field and acre.</p>  
 <p>Then came the Hall-Sun forth from her room clad in glittering raiment, and summoned no one, but went straight to her place on the dais under her namesake the Lamp, and stood there a little without speaking.  Her face was pale now, her lips a little open, her eyes set and staring as if they saw nothing of all that was round about her.</p>  
 <p>Now went the word through the Hall and the Women's-Chamber that the Hall- Sun would speak again, and that great tidings were toward; so all folk came flock-meal to the dais, both thralls and free; and scarce were all gathered there, ere the Hall-Sun began speaking, and said:</p>  
 <p>   "The days of the world thrust onward, and men are born therein<br>    A many and a many, and divers deeds they win<br>    In the fashioning of stories for the kindreds of the earth,<br>    A garland interwoven of sorrow and of mirth.<br>    To the world a warrior cometh; from the world he passeth away,<br>    And no man then may sunder his good from his evil day.<br>    By the Gods hath he been tormented, and been smitten by the foe:<br>    He hath seen his maiden perish, he hath seen his speech-friend go:<br>    His heart hath conceived a joyance and hath brought it unto birth:<br>    But he hath not carried with him his sorrow or his mirth.<br>    He hath lived, and his life hath fashioned the outcome of the deed,<br>    For the blossom of the people, and the coming kindreds' seed.</p>  
 <p>   "Thus-wise the world is fashioned, and the new sun of the morn<br>    Where earth last night was desert beholds a kindred born,<br>    That to-morrow and to-morrow blossoms all gloriously<br>    With many a man and maiden for the kindreds yet to be,<br>    And fair the Goth-folk groweth.  And yet the story saith<br>    That the deeds that make the summer make too the winter's death,<br>    That summer-tides unceasing from out the grave may grow<br>    And the spring rise up unblemished from the bosom of the snow.</p>  
 <p>   "Thus as to every kindred the day comes once for all<br>    When yesterday it was not, and to-day it builds the hall,<br>    So every kindred bideth the night-tide of the day,<br>    Whereof it knoweth nothing, e'en when noon is past away.<br>    E'en thus the House of the Wolfings 'twixt dusk and dark doth stand,<br>    And narrow is the pathway with the deep on either hand.<br>    On the left are the days forgotten, on the right the days to come,<br>    And another folk and their story in the stead of the Wolfing home.<br>    Do the shadows darken about it, is the even here at last?<br>    Or is this but a storm of the noon-tide that the wind is driving past?</p>  
 <p>   "Unscathed as yet it standeth; it bears the stormy drift,<br>    Nor bows to the lightening flashing adown from the cloudy lift.<br>    I see the hail of battle and the onslaught of the strong,<br>    And they go adown to the folk-mote that shall bide there over long.<br>    I see the slain-heaps rising and the alien folk prevail,<br>    And the Goths give back before them on the ridge o'er the treeless vale.<br>    I see the ancient fallen, and the young man smitten dead,<br>    And yet I see the War-duke shake Throng-plough o'er his head,<br>    And stand unhelmed, unbyrnied before the alien host,<br>    And the hurt men rise around him to win back battle lost;<br>    And the wood yield up her warriors, and the whole host rushing on,<br>    And the swaying lines of battle until the lost is won.<br>    Then forth goes the cry of triumph, as they ring the captives round<br>    And cheat the crow of her portion and heap the warriors' mound.<br>    There are faces gone from our feast-hall not the least beloved nor worst,<br>    But the wane of the House of the Wolfings not yet the world hath cursed.<br>    The sun shall rise to-morrow on our cold and dewy roof,<br>    For they that longed for slaughter were slaughtered far aloof."</p>  
 <p>She ceased for a little, but her countenance, which had not changed during her song, changed not at all now: so they all kept silence although they were rejoicing in this new tale of victory; for they deemed that she was not yet at the end of her speaking.  And in good sooth she spake again presently, and said:</p>  
 <p>   "I wot not what hath befallen nor where my soul may be,<br>    For confusion is within me and but dimly do I see,<br>    As if the thing that I look on had happed a while ago.<br>    They stand by the tofts of a war-garth, a captain of the foe,<br>    And a man that is of the Goth-folk, and as friend and friend they speak,<br>    But I hear no word they are saying, though for every word I seek.<br>    And now the mist flows round me and blind I come aback<br>    To the House-roof of the Wolfings and the hearth that hath no lack."</p>  
 <p>Her voice grew weaker as she spake the last words, and she sank backward on to her chair: her clenched hands opened, the lids fell down over her bright eyes, her breast heaved no more as it had done, and presently she fell asleep.</p>  
 <p>The folk were doubtful and somewhat heavy-hearted because of those last words of hers; but they would not ask her more, or rouse her from her sleep, lest they should grieve her; so they departed to their beds and slept for what was yet left of the night.</p>
