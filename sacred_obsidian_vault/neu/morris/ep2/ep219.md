 <p align="center"><i>The Sword comes back without the Scabbard</i>.</p>  
 <p>WHEN of this wedding first came tidings true<br> To Bathstead, then it was that Gudrun knew<br> How much of hope had been before that day<br> Within her heart; now, when a cast-away<br> Upon the lonely rocks of life, she was<br> With nought to help whateer might come to pass;<br> Deaf, dumb, and blind, long hours she went about<br> Her father's house, till folk began to doubt<br> If she would ever speak a word again;<br> Nay, scarce yet could she think about her pain,<br> Or een know what it was, but seemed to face<br> Some huge blank wall within a lonely place.<br> And Bodli watched her with a burning heart<br> Baffled and beaten back, yet for his part<br> Something like hope gan flit before his eyes,<br> Hope of some change een if new miseries<br> Wrapped it about.<br>                        As on a day she went<br> Slow-footed through the hall without intent,<br> Taking no heed of aught, of Kiartan's name<br> She heard one speak, and to her stunned heart came <a name="page_457"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 457</font></a><br> A flash of hope and pain, against her will<br> Her foot must stay her, and she stood there still,<br> And turning round she saw where Ospak stood,<br> And slowly talking in a sullen mood<br> Unto his brother Thorolf; but they made<br> As though they saw her not, and Ospak said:</p>  
 <p>   "Thou art young, Thorolf, and thy words are vain,<br> So it has been, so it shall be again,<br> One man shall deem all others made for him,<br> And neath his greatness shall all fame grow dim;<br> Till on a day men try if he is man<br> Eh! what then fallethlet him, if he can<br> Play Thor among the mannikins, and cast<br> The swords aback when he is caught at last."</p>  
 <p>   "Hist!" Thorolf said; "there sister Gudrun goes!<br> Kiartan has froze her heart up: stand we close!"</p>  
 <p>   Then Ospak laughed: "She will not hear us yet,<br> She hath a hope she cannot quite forget,<br> That he who twice has flung her love aside,<br> Will come some day to claim her as his bride,<br> When he has slain our long-faced champion there!<br> Good sooth, the house of Hauskuld waxeth fair,<br> We shall have kings in Iceland ere our day<br> Is quite gone by."<br>                     Slowly she gat away<br> Stung to the heart by those coarse words of hate, <a name="page_458"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 458</font></a><br> Wondering withal what new thought lay in wait<br> To change her life; she sat her down alone<br> And covered up her face, and one by one<br> Strove to recall the happy days past by,<br> And wondering why they past so happily<br> While yet none strove for happiness; at last<br> She raised her head up and a glance she cast<br> Unto the open door and down the hall<br> A streak of sun on Bodli's head did fall<br> As he turned round and saw her; then she said<br> Unto herself: 'Nay, then, love is not dead<br> Since Bodli lives: why should I hate him then<br> Because he heeded not the shame of men<br> Amidst his love? but thou, I once called love,<br> On whom I flung my heart, with whom I strove<br> For ever, thy weak measured love to make<br> Equal to mine, what didst thou for my sake?<br> Thy soul is saved, thy fame is won, and thou<br> Hast a fair damsel's arms about thee now<br> Not mineand thou art happy. Who can tell,<br> O Bodli Thorleikson, but down in hell<br> We twain shall love, and love, and love again,<br> When the first wave of the eternal pain<br> Has washed our folly from us, and I know<br> Why upon earth I loved a weak heart so<br> That loved me not, while I was ice to thee,<br> O loving lovesome traitor."<br>                                Wearily<br> She hung her head with parted lips awhile, <a name="page_459"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 459</font></a><br> Silent she sat, until a bitter smile<br> Bemocked her face: "Yet if I call thee love,<br> And kiss thee with sweet kisses, such as move<br> Great men to great deeds, trust me not too much,<br> But think of honied words and tremulous touch<br> As things that slay. If Kiartan lay there dead,<br> How I should love him!"<br>                             Once more sank her head,<br> And long she sat in silence, till at last<br> She heard how Bodli toward her bower passed,<br> And rose and met him coldly, with no sign<br> That anywise her vexed heart did incline<br> To ease the bitter burden that he bore.</p>  
 <p>   Unheeding all, the year moved as before,<br> And autumn came again. What hearts soeer<br> The younger folk each unto each might bear<br> Olaf and Oswif chose to shut their eyes,<br> And close their ears, as peaceful men and wise,<br> And make believe that nought amiss there was<br> Twixt the two houses; so it came to pass<br> That Bathstead to the Herdholt feast did go<br> At autumn-tide once more at least; and though<br> Kiartan was loth enow those folk to face,<br> Yet so hard Olaf prayed that he would grace<br> His father's house with his great fame, and sit,<br> Yet once again while he might look at it,<br> A glory to the feast, that he put by<br> His doubts once more, and there with troubled eye <a name="page_460"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 460</font></a><br> Noted the twain among the Bathstead crowd,<br> And Oswif's ill sons, insolent and loud,<br> And turned pale when the words of greeting came<br> From out his lips. Meanwhile, with shrinking shame<br> And anxious heart, did Refna gaze upon<br> Gudrun's great beauty, deeming she had won<br> A troublous lot; and Kiartan, noting that,<br> And how scarce like the mistress there she sat,<br> Yet to his eyes seemed fairer, because love<br> Had forged the fear that so her heart did move,<br> Grew wroth that still so many memories<br> Must vex his heart, and turn aside his eyes<br> To Gudrun, the world's wonder there, whose face,<br> Now coldly watchful, scanned the busy place.</p>  
 <p>   Men say that at this feast three things betid,<br> Whereby the flame the elders deemed well hid,<br> Showed through the heap of smouldering love and hate.<br> First, when the new-come guests did stand and wait<br> Till they were marshalled to their seats, the maid<br> Who did this for the women turned and said<br> To Kiartan, "Who the high-seat fills to-day<br> Beside the goodwife?"<br>                           In most bright array<br> Stood Gudrun, gazing ever at the bride,<br> As though she saw not anything beside;<br> And Kiartan noted her, and therewith deemed<br> That in her eyes a look of hate there gleamed,<br> And saw withal Refna's soft eyes fall down <a name="page_461"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 461</font></a><br> Before hers; then he spake out, with a frown:</p>  
 <p>   "Nay, thou art foolish, damsel: who shall sit<br> In the best place, if I may deal with it,<br> Saving my wife?" But as he said the word,<br> The struggling devil so his vexed heart stirred,<br> That he must look at Gudrun; their eyes met,<br> Paler she grew than he had seen her yet,<br> Then red as blood; but he waxed wroth and said:</p>  
 <p>   "Ah, wert thou een so foolish, then, O maid?<br> For such a guest belike we have got here<br> As thinketh everything of great or dear,<br> Honour, and hearts of men, and women's tears<br> Are but for her." Then tingling took the ears<br> Of those that stood thereby; as he strode off,<br> Gudrun's cold smile was bitterer than a scoff<br> Spoken aloud: but Ospak laughed, and said<br> In a loud whisper, close to Bodli's head:</p>  
 <p>   "Nay, thou shalt have to fight for Gudrun yet,<br> Even though Refna did the bride-bed get.<br> He deems our sister may not quench the thought<br> Of all the joy she erst to Herdholt brought.<br> Ah, we shall yet see Refna lie a-cold,<br> Brother-in-law, unless thou waxest bold."</p>  
 <p>   Such a beginning to the feast there was.</p>  
 <p>   Moreover, the next day it came to pass, <a name="page_462"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 462</font></a><br> As folk ere supper sported in the hall,<br> That unto her did goodwife Thorgerd call<br> The gentle Refna, bidding her as one<br> Who well might bid, to do the rich coif on,<br> The wonder of the Greeks, the fair queen's gift:<br> Then Refna reddened, and her eyes did lift<br> To Kiartan, een as asking him thereof;<br> But he spake nought, her soft look might not move<br> His heart from deep thought; so she went her ways,<br> Scarce happy neath his far-off moody gaze,<br> And came back glittering like a new-born star,<br> And sat upon the dais seen afar<br> Down the dusk hall. Then Ospak noted how<br> Gudrun turned pale, and he his teeth did show<br> Like a crossed hound, and muttered:<br>                                         "Past belief,<br> As men may deem it, sister, yet a thief<br> Asgeir begat; for longeth not that gold<br> To Bathstead, if the tale be rightly told?"</p>  
 <p>   Now Kiartan seemed to wake as from a dream,<br> When in the torches' flare that gold did gleam,<br> And went across to Refna's side, and said,<br> Smiling and whispering: "More I love thy head<br> Uncovered, O my love; yea, and withal,<br> Sharp swords thy helm from out their sheaths may call:<br> Look down there, how the sons of Oswif scowl<br> Around poor Bodli's face; the storm doth growl<br> Afar alreadynay, nay, fear thee nought! <a name="page_463"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 463</font></a><br> But good I deemed it thou shouldst know my thought."</p>  
 <p>   Sour and sick-hearted Gudrun turned away,<br> Noting how Kiartan's hand on Refna's lay,<br> And how their cheeks were close each unto each.<br> And Refna's eyes that love did so beseech,<br> Her soft mouth, tremulous with longing sore<br> For yet more kisses, long time hung before<br> Her weary eyes upon that weary night,<br> Yea, and till mirth of men was slain by light.</p>  
 <p>   Hearken once more: the morn the guests should go,<br> About the stead Kiartan went to and fro,<br> Busied in such things, as his father's son,<br> For honour's very sake, must see well done;<br> And as he ordered how the folk should ride,<br> His sword, 'The King's Gift' named, which by his side<br> Was ever wont to hang, upon his bed<br> He left awhile, and, when the guests were sped,<br> Came back to seek the same, and found it gone.<br> Then questioning there was of everyone,<br> And mighty trouble; An the Black meanwhile,<br> A sturdy house-carle, slipped out with a smile,<br> Just as old Olaf to his son gan talk<br> In such wise:<br>                   "Son, hate far abroad will walk<br> Een when new-born, although we nurse it not:<br> Now my heart tells me much must be forgot,<br> Many words hidden, many sights be seen <a name="page_464"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 464</font></a><br> By thine eyes only, son, if I, between<br> Death and the end of life shall see thee last;<br> And hold thy living hands as life goes past,<br> Mine eyes a-waxing dim: wait then, and hope:<br> Thou shalt grow stronger with the world to cope,<br> If thou sitst down with patience, casting not<br> Long days and sweet on drawing of a lot."<br>    Such things and more he spake, and Kiartan heard<br> With kind eyes, if his heart were little stirred.<br> But, as they sat and talked thereof, came back,<br> Smiling, but panting sorely, An the Black,<br> And in his cloak he carried something wrapped.</p>  
 <p>   "Well," Olaf said, "and what new thing hath happed?"</p>  
 <p>   "Soon told," said An; "I followed them afar,<br> Knowing what thieves those Bathstead skinkers are,<br> And at the peat moss where the road doth wind<br> About the dale, young Thorolf lagged behind;<br> I saw him take a something from his cloak,<br> And thrust it down just were the stream doth soak<br> The softest through the peat; then swift again<br> Ride on: so when they might not see me plain,<br> O ho, says I, and comes up to the place,<br> And here and there I peer with careful face<br> Until at last I draw this fair thing forth;<br> A pity though, the scabbard is of worth!<br> Clean gone it is." <a name="page_465"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 465</font></a><br>                    Then from his cloak he drew<br> 'The King's Gift' bright and naked. Olaf grew<br> Joyous thereover, praising An right well.<br> But Kiartan gan to gloom: "Ah, who can tell,"<br> He muttered, as he took the sword to him,<br> "But this shall end the troublous tale and dim?<br> Well, I at least cast not the sheath away;<br> Bewail not ye too much, who have to pay<br> For pleasure gained; his may the worst hap be,<br> Who best can bear the pain and misery."</p>
