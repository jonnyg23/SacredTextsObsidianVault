 <p align="center"><i>What Folk did at Herdholt after the Slaying</i>.</p>  
 <p>NOW in the hall next morn did Oswif bide<br> The while his messengers went far and wide<br> Asking for help; and all in hiding lay<br> Whose hapless hands had brought about that day,<br> Save Bodli; but for him, when back he came<br> That morn, affrighted, Oswif called his name,<br> Beholding him so worn and changed, and said:</p>  
 <p>   "Stout art thou, kinsman, not to hide thine head!<br> Yet think that Olaf is a mighty man,<br> And though thy coming life look ill and wan<br> Good reason whyYet will I ask of thee<br> The staff of mine old age at least to be,<br> And save thy life therefor."<br>                             Then Bodli smiled<br> A ghastly smile: "Nay, I am not beguiled<br> To hope for speedy death; is it not told<br> How that Cain lived till he was very old?"</p>  
 <p>   Therewith he sank adown into a seat<br> And hid his face. But sound of hurrying feet<br> Was in the porch withal; and presently<br> Came one who said:<br>                        "Oswif, all hail to thee!<br> From Holyfell I come with tidings true,<br> That little will the wily Snorri do <a name="page_512"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 512</font></a><br> To help us herein; for he saith the deed<br> Is most ill done, and that thy sons shall need<br> More help than they shall get within the land;<br> Yet saith withal, he will not hold his hand<br> From buying peace, if that may serve thy turn."</p>  
 <p>   "Well, well," said Oswif, "scarce now first I learn<br> That Snorri bides his time, and will not run<br> His neck into a noose for any one.<br> Go, get thee food, good fellow. Whence comst thou<br> Who followest, thy face is long enow?"</p>  
 <p>   "The bearer of a message back I am<br> From Whiteriver, where Audun Festargram<br> Has well-nigh done his lading, and, saith he,<br> That so it is he feareth the deep sea<br> But little, and the devil nought at all;<br> But he is liefer at hell's gate to call<br> With better men than are thy sons, he saith."</p>  
 <p>   "Good," Oswif said, "that little he fears death!<br> My sight clears, and I see his black bows strike<br> The hidden skerry. But thou next; belike<br> Thou hast ill tidings too: what saith my friend,<br> The son of Hauskuld? what shall be the end?"</p>  
 <p>   "Oswif," the man said, "be not wroth with me<br> If unto Herdholt nowise openly<br> I went last night; I fared with hidden head <a name="page_513"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 513</font></a><br> Een as a man who drifts from stead to stead<br> When things go ill: so shelter there I gat,<br> And mid the house-caries long enow I sat<br> To note men's bearing. Olafan old man<br> He looks now trulysat all worn and wan<br> Within the high-seat, and I deemed of him<br> That he had wept, from his red eyes and dim,<br> That scarce looked dry as yet; but down the board<br> Sat Thorgerd, and I saw a naked sword<br> Gleam from her mantle; round her sat her sons,<br> And unto Haldor did she whisper once<br> And looked toward Olaf; Haldor from its sheath<br> Half drew his sword, and then below his breath<br> Spake somewhat. Now looked Olaf round the hall,<br> But when his eyes on Kiartan's place did fall<br> His mouth twitched, though his eyes gazed steadily;<br> He set his hand unto a beaker nigh<br> And drank and cried out:<br>                              "Drink now all of you<br> Unto the best man Iceland ever knew!<br> Son, I am weary that thou hast not come<br> With gleesome tales this eve unto my home;<br> Yet well thou farest surely amid those<br> Who are the noblest there, and not so close<br> They sit, but there is room for thee beside;<br> Sure, too, with them this eve is merry tide<br> That thou art come amongst themwould that I<br> O son, O son, were of that company!' <a name="page_514"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 514</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "With outstretched hand and fixed eyes did he stare,<br> As though none other in the hall there were<br> But him he named; the while mid shout and clank<br> All folk unto the man departed drank,<br> And midst the noise, withal, I saw no few,<br> Who from their sheaths the glittering weapons drew,<br> And through the talk of Kiartan's deeds I heard,<br> Not lowly spoken, many a threatening word;<br> While with the tumult of the clattering place<br> So gathered white-hot rage in Thorgerd's face,<br> That long it held her silent: then I saw<br> A black form from the women's chamber draw<br> White-faced, white-handed; ever did she gaze<br> Upon the hall-door with an anxious face,<br> And once or twice as the stout door-planks shook<br> Beneath the wind's stroke, a half-hopeful look<br> Came oer her face, that faded presently<br> In anguish, as she looked some face to see<br> Come from the night, and then remembered all;<br> And therewith did great ruth upon me fall,<br> For this was Refna; and most quietly<br> She passed to Olaf's side, and with a sigh<br> Sat down beside him there; now and again<br> An eager look lit up her patient pain<br> As from the home-men Kiartan's name came loud,<br> And then once more her heavy head she bowed,<br> And strove to weep and might not. In a while<br> She raised her eyes, and met grey Thorgerd's smile <a name="page_515"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 515</font></a><br> Scornful and fierce, who therewithal rose up<br> And laid her hand upon a silver cup,<br> And drew from out her cloak a jewelled sword,<br> And cast it ringing on the oaken board,<br> And oer the hall's noise high her clear voice shrilled;</p>  
 <p>   If the old gods by Christ and mass are killed,<br> Or driven away, yet am I left behind,<br> Daughter of Egil, and with such a mind<br> As Egil had; wherefore if Asa Thor<br> Has never lived, and there are men no more<br> Within the land, yet by this king's gift here,<br> And by this cup Thor owned once, do I swear<br> That the false foster-brother shall be slain<br> Before three summers have come round again,<br> If but my hand must bring him to his end.'</p>  
 <p>   Therewith a stern shout did her tall sons send<br> Across the hall, and mighty din arose<br> Among the home-men. Refna shrank all close<br> To Olaf's side; but he at first said nought,<br> Until the cries and clash of weapons brought<br> Across his dream some image of past days;<br> And, turning, upon Refna did he gaze,<br> And on her soft hair laid his hand, and then<br> Faced round upon the drink-flushed clamorous men,<br> And in a mighty voice cried out and said:<br> 'Forbear, ye brawlers! now is Kiartan dead,<br> Nor shall I live long. Will it bring him back <a name="page_516"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 516</font></a><br> To let loose on the country war and wrack,<br> And slay the man I love next after him?<br> Leave me in peace at least! mine eyes wax dim,<br> And little pleasure henceforth shall I have,<br> Until my head hath rest within the grave.'</p>  
 <p>   Then did he rise and stretch across the board,<br> And took into his hand the noble sword,<br> And said, 'In good will wert thou given, O blade,<br> But not to save my son's heart wert thou made.<br> Help no man henceforth! harm no man henceforth!<br> Thou foolish glittering toy of little worth!'</p>  
 <p>   Therewith he brake the sword across his knee,<br> And cast it down; and then I minded me<br> How the dead man there bore not that fair blade<br> When unto grass of Swinedale he was laid.<br> But Olaf looked so great a man, that none<br> Durst say a word against him. Gone is gone,'<br> He said, 'nor yet on Bodli shall ye fall.<br> When all is ready Kiartan's voice shall call<br> For him he loved; but if it must be so,<br> Then unto Oswif's base sons shall ye show<br> That him they did to death left friends behind';<br> For this thing ever shall ye bear in mind,<br> That through their vile plots did all come to. pass,<br> And Bodli but the sword they fought with was.'<br>    And therewithal he sat down wearily,<br> And once again belike saw nought anigh. <a name="page_517"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 517</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "Well, Oswif, little more there happed that eve,<br> And I at dawn to-day their stead did leave,<br> To tell thee how things went."<br>                                 Now Bodli heard<br> The man speak, and some heart in him was stirred<br> When of the woman's oath was told, but when<br> The tale was ended, his head sank again<br> With a low moan; but Oswif said:<br>                                       "Yea, true<br> Did my heart tell me, when I thought I knew<br> The nobleness of Olaf Hauskuldson.<br> What shall be done now?"<br>                            As he spake came one<br> Panting and flushed into the hall, and cried:<br> Get to your arms in haste; Herdholt doth ride<br> Unto our stead in goodly company!"<br> Then was there tumult as was like to be,<br> And round the silent face of the dead man,<br> Hither and thither, half-armed tremblers ran<br> With poor hearts; but old Oswif to the door<br> Went forth unarmed, and Bodli scarce moved more<br> Than his dead foster-brother. Soon withal<br> Did quiet on the troubled homestead fall,<br> For there was nought come but a peaceful train<br> To bring back Kiartan to his home again;<br> And there upon the green slope did they bide,<br> Whence Kiartan on that other morn had cried<br> His scorn aloud; wherefrom were six men sent,<br> Who, entering now the thronged hall, slowly went, <a name="page_518"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 518</font></a><br> Looking around them, toward the bier; but as<br> They drew anear it, from the bower did pass<br> A black-clad figure, and they stood aghast,<br> For it was Gudrun, and wild eyes she cast<br> On this and that man, as if questioning<br> Mutely the meaning of some dreadful thing<br> She knew was doing there: her black gown's hem<br> She caught up wildly as she gazed at them,<br> Then shuddering cast it down, and seemed to seek<br> The face of Oswif; then as if to shriek<br> She raised her head, and clenched her hands, but nought<br> Of sound from out her parched lips was there brought,<br> Till at her breast she clutched, and rent adown<br> With trembling hands the bosom of her gown,<br> And cried out, panting as for lack of air;</p>  
 <p>   "Alas, what do ye? have ye come to bear<br> My love a second time from me, O men?<br> Do ye not know he is come back again<br> After a long time? Ah, but evil heart<br> Must be in you such love as ours to part!"</p>  
 <p>   Then, crying out, upon the corpse she fell,<br> And men's hearts failed them for pure ruth, and well<br> They deemed it, might she never rise again;<br> But strong are many hearts to bear all pain<br> And live, and hers was even such an one.<br> Softly they bore her back amidst her swoon; <a name="page_519"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 519</font></a><br> And then, while even men must weep, once more<br> Did Kiartan pass the threshold of the door,<br> That once had been the gate of Paradise<br> Unto his longing heart. But in nowise<br> Did Bodli move amidst all this, until<br> Slow wound the Herdholt men around the hill;<br> Then stealthily his white face did he raise,<br> And turned about unto the empty place<br> Where erst the bier had stood; then he arose,<br> And looked into the faces of all those<br> Who stood around, as asking what betid,<br> What dreadful thing the quivering silence hid;<br> And then he staggered back unto the wall,<br> And such a storm of grief on him did fall,<br> With sobs, and tears, and inarticulate cries,<br> That men for shame must turn away their eyes,<br> Nor seem to see a great man fallen so low.</p>  
 <p>   With such wild songs home to the stead came now<br> The last load of that bitter harvesting,<br> That from the seed of lust and lies did spring.</p>
