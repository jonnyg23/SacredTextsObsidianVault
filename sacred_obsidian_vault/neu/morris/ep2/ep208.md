 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Earthly Paradise, (September-November)</i>, by William Morris, [1870], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  
 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p>  <h1 align="center">NOVEMBER.</h1>  
 <p>ARE thine eyes weary? is thy heart too sick<br> To struggle any more with doubt and thought,<br> Whose formless veil draws darkening now and thick<br> Across thee, een as smoke-tinged mist-wreaths brought<br> Down a fair dale to make it blind and nought?<br> Art thou so weary that no world there seems<br> Beyond these four walls, hung with pain and dreams?</p>  
 <p>   Look out upon the real world, where the moon,<br> Half-way twixt root and crown of these high trees,<br> Turns the dead midnight into dreamy noon,,<br> Silent and full of wonders, for the breeze<br> Died at the sunset, and no images,<br> No hopes of day, are left in sky or earth<br> Is it not fair, and of most wondrous worth?</p>  
 <p>   Yea, I have looked and seen November there;<br> The changeless seal of change it seemed to be,<br> Fair death of things that, living once, were fair;<br> Bright sign of loneliness too great for me,<br> Strange image of the dread eternity,<br> In whose void patience how can these have part,<br> These outstretched feverish hands, this restless heart?</p>  
 <p> </p>

 <p>ON a clear eve, when the November sky<br> Grew red with promise of the hoar-frost nigh,<br> These ancient men turned from the outside cold,<br> With something like content that they, grown old,<br> Needed but little now to help the ease<br> Of those last days before the final peace.<br> The empty month for them left no regret<br> For sweet things gained and lost, and longed for yet,<br> Twixt spring-tide and this dying of the year.<br> Few things of small account the whole did bear,<br> Nor like a long lifetime of misery<br> Those few days seemed, as oft to such may be<br> As, seeing the patience of the world, whereby<br> Midst all its strife it falls not utterly<br> Into a wild, confused mass of pain,<br> Yet note it not, and have no will to gain,<br> Since they are young, a little time of rest,<br> Midst their vain raging for the hopeless best.</p>  
 <p>   Such thought, perchance, was in his heart, who broke<br> The silence of the fireside now, and spoke;<br> "This eve my tale tells of a fair maid born<br> Within a peaceful land, that peace to scorn,<br> In turn to scorn the deeds of mighty kings,<br> The council of the wise, and far-famed things,<br> And envied lives; so, born for discontent, <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a><br> She through the eager world of base folk went,<br> Still gaining nought but heavier weariness.<br> God grant that somewhere now content may bless<br> Her yearning heart; that she may look and smile<br> On the strange earth that wearied her awhile,<br> And now forgets her! Yet so do not we,<br> Though some of us have lived full happily!"</p>
