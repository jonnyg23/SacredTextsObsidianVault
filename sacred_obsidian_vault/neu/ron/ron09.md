 <h1 align="CENTER">THE SECOND ACT</h1>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">A open space on the shore in front of the Gibichungs' hall; to the right the open entrance to the hall, to the left the bank of the Rhine. From the latter, crossing the stage and mounting towards the back, rises a rocky height, cut by several mountain-paths. There an altar-stone to Fricka is visible, as well as one, higher up, to Wotan, and one at the side to Donner. It is night. Hagen, his arm round his spear and his shield by his side, sits against one of the pillars of the hall asleep. The moon shines out suddenly and throws a vivid light on Hagen and his immediate surroundings. Alberich is seen crouching in front of him, leaning his arms on Hagen's knees.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Alberich</p>
 <p>[<i>Softly</i>.]</p>
 <p>Hagen, son, art asleep?<br>
 Betrayed by drowsiness<br>
 And rest thou dost not hear?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>Softly, without moving, so that he seems to sleep on although his eyes are open</i>.]</p>
 <p>I hear thee, O baleful Niblung;<br>
 What wouldst thou tell me while I slumber?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Alberich</p>
 <p>Remember the might<br>
 Thou art endowed with,<br>
 If thou art valiant<br>
 As thy mother bore thee to me.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>Still as before</i>.]</p>
 <p>Though courage she bestowed,<br>
 I have no cause to thank her<br>
 For falling under thy spell;</p>
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>
 <p>Soon old, wan and pale,<br>
 Hating the happy,<br>
 Where is my joy?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Alberich</p>
 <p>[<i>As before</i>.]</p>
 <p>Hagen, my son,<br>
 Hate thou the happy;<br>
 This joyless and<br>
 Sorrow-laden one,<br>
 Him alone thou shalt love.<br>
 Be thou strong<br>
 And bold and wise!<br>
 Those whom with weapons<br>
 Of darkness we fight<br>
 Already our hate has dismayed.<br>
 And he who captured my ring,<br>
 Wotan, the ravening robber,<br>
 By one of his sons<br>
 In fight has been vanquished;<br>
 He has lost<br>
 Through the Wälsung power and might.<br>
 With the whole immortal race<br>
 He awaits in anguish his downfall.<br>
 Him I fear no more:<br>
 He and all his must perish!<br>
 Hagen, son, art asleep?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>Remains motionless as before</i>.]</p>
 <p>The might of the Gods<br>
 Who then shall wield?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Alberich</p>
 <p>I--and thou!<br>
 The world we shall own,<br>
 If in thy truth<br>
 I rightly trust,<br>
 Sharest thou my hate and wrath.<br>
 Wotan's spear<br>
 Was splintered by Siegfried,</p>

 <p>The hero who won<br>
 As booty the ring<br>
 When Fafner, the dragon, he slew.<br>
 Power supreme<br>
 He has attained to;</p>
 <p>[<i>Still mysteriously</i>.]</p>
 <p>Walhall and Nibelheim bow to his will.<br>
 On this hero undaunted<br>
 My curse falls in vain,<br>
 For he knows not<br>
 The ring's true worth,<br>
 Nor makes use<br>
 Of its wonderful spell;<br>
 Laughing he burns life away,<br>
 Caring only for love.<br>
 Nothing can serve us<br>
 But his undoing!</p>
 <p>Sleepest, Hagen, my son?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>As before</i>.]</p>
 <p>Already he speeds<br>
 Through me to his doom.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Alberich</p>
 <p>The golden ring--<br>
 'Tis that that we must capture!<br>
 The Wälsung<br>
 By a wise woman is loved.<br>
 If, urged by her,<br>
 To the Rhine's fair daughters<br>
 --Who bewitched me once<br>
 Below in the waves--<br>
 The stolen ring he restored,<br>
 Forever lost were the gold,<br>
 And no guile could win it again.<br>
 Wherefore with ardour<br>
 Aim for the ring.</p>
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p>
 <p>I gat thee<br>
 A stranger to fear,<br>
 That against heroes<br>
 Thou mightst uphold me.<br>
 I had not the strength,<br>
 Indeed, to despatch,<br>
 Like the Walsung, Fafner in fight;<br>
 But I reared Hagen<br>
 To deadly hatred,<br>
 And he shall avenge me--<br>
 Shall win the ring,<br>
 Putting Wälsung and Wotan to scorn!<br>
 Swear to me, Hagen, my son!</p>
 <p>[<i>From this point Alberich is covered by an ever-deepening shadow. At the same time day begins to dawn</i>.]</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>Still as before</i>.]</p>
 <p>The ring shall be mine yet;<br>
 Quietly wait!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Alberich</p>
 <p>Swear to me, Hagen, my son!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>To myself swear I;<br>
 Make thy mind easy!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Alberich</p>
 <p>[<i>Still gradually disappearing, and his voice, as he does so, becoming more and more inaudible</i>.]</p>
 <p>Be true, Hagen, my son!<br>
 Trusty hero, be true!<br>
 Be true!--True!</p>
 <p>[<i>Alberich has quite disappeared. Hagen, who has never changed position, looks with fixed eyes and without moving towards the Rhine, over which the light of dawn is spreading</i>.]</p>

 <i></i><p align="CENTER">The gradually brightening red of dawn is reflected in the Rhine. Siegfried<br>
 steps out suddenly from behind a bush close to the shore. He appears<br>
 in his own shape, but has the Tarnhelm on his head still; he takes<br>
 this off, and, as he comes forward, hangs it on his girdle.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Hoioh! Hagen!<br>
 Weary man!<br>
 Where is thy welcome?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>Rising in a leisurely fashion</i>.]</p>
 <p>Hei! Siegfried?<br>
 Swift-footed hero,<br>
 Whence stormest thou now?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>From Brünnhilde's rock.<br>
 'Twas there that I drew the breath<br>
 I called to thee with;<br>
 A quick passage I made!<br>
 Slower behind me a pair<br>
 On board a vessel come.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>Hast thou won Brünnhild'?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Wakes Gutrune?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>Calling towards the hall</i>.]</p>
 <p>Hoiho! Gutrune!<br>
 Haste and come!<br>
 Siegfried is here.<br>
 Why dost delay?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>[<i>Turning to the hall</i>.]</p>
 <p>How Brünnhild' yielded<br>
 Ye shall both be told.</p>
 <p>[<i>Gutrune comes from the hall to meet him</i>.]</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Give me fair greeting,<br>
 Gibich's child!<br>
 I come to thee with joyful news.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>Freia greet thee<br>
 To the honour of all women!</p>
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>To thy lover glad<br>
 Be gracious;<br>
 For wife I have won thee to-day.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>Comes then Brünnhild' with my brother?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>None ever wooed with more ease.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>Was he not scorched by the fire?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>It had not burnt him, I trow;<br>
 But I broke through it instead,<br>
 That I for wife might win thee.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>And no harm didst thou take?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>I laughed 'mid the surge of the flames.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>Did Brünnhild' think thee Gunther?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Like were we to a hair;<br>
 The Tarnhelm saw to that,<br>
 As Hagen truly foretold.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>I gave thee counsel good.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>And so the bold maid was tamed?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Her pride--Gunther broke.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>Did she give herself to thee?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Through the night the vanquished Brünnhild'<br>
 To her rightful husband belonged.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>For her husband thou didst pass?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>By Gutrune sojourned Siegfried.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>But 'twas Brünnhild' lay beside thee.</p>

 <p>But how got Gunther his wife from thee?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Through the flames of the fire as they faded,<br>
 When day dawned, through the mist<br>
 She followed me down the hill;<br>
 When near the shore,<br>
 None observing,<br>
 I gave Gunther my place,<br>
 And by the Tarnhelm's magic<br>
 Wished myself straight to thee.<br>
 A strong wind drives the lovers<br>
 Merrily down the Rhine;<br>
 Prepare to greet them with joy.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>Siegfried! Such is thy might,<br>
 I am afraid of thee!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Hagen</p>
 <p>[<i>Calling from the shore</i>.]</p>
 <p>I can see a sail in the distance.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Now be the envoy thanked!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Gutrune</p>
 <p>Let us give her gracious greeting,<br>
 That glad and gay she here may tarry!<br>
 Thou, Hagen, prithee<br>
 Summon the men<br>
 To the hall here for the wedding,<br>
 While blithe maids<br>
 To the feast I bid;<br>
 Our joy they will merrily share.</p>
 <p>[<i>As she goes towards the hall she turns round again</i>.]</p>
 <p>Wilt thou rest, wicked man?</p>

 Won me to wife.</p>

 <p>Siegfried? Gutrune's lord?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Brünnhilde</p>
 <p>He forced delight<br>
 And love from me.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Siegfried</p>
 <p>Dost thou so lightly<br>
 Hold thine honour,<br>
 The tongue that thus defames it<br>
 I must convict of its falsehood.<br>
 Hear whether faith I broke!<br>
 Blood-brotherhood<br>
 I have sworn unto Gunther;<br>
 Nothung, my trusty sword,<br>
 Guarded the sacred vow;<br>
 'Twixt me and this sad woman distraught<br>
 Its blade lay sharp.</p>

 <p align="CENTER">Brünnhilde</p>
 <p>Behold how thou liest,<br>
 Crafty man,<br>
 Vainly as witness<br>
 Citing thy sword!<br>
 Full well I know its keenness,<br>
 And also the scabbard<br>
 Wherein so snugly<br>
 Hung on the wall<br>
 Nothung, the faithful friend,<br>
 When its lord won the woman he loved.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Vassals and Women</p>

 Has he stained Gunther's honour?</p>

 Cast in her teeth!</p>

 <p>Siegfried faithless?<br>
 False to his vow?<br>
 Ah, prove thou that worthless<br>

 I solemnly swear!<br>
 Spear-point, mark thou my words!<br>
 Devoted be thy might<br>

 <p>Gunther, look to this woman<br>
 Who falsely slanders thy name.<br>
 Let her rest awhile,<br>
 The untamed mountain maid,<br>
 That the unbridled rage some demon<br>
 In malice has<br>
 Against us roused<br>
 May have the chance to subside.<br>
 Ye vassals, go ye your ways;<br>
 Let the womenfolk scold.<br>
 Like cravens gladly we yield,<br>
 Comes it to fighting with tongues.</p>
 <p>[<i>He goes up to Gunther</i>.]</p>
 <p>Thou art not so vexed as I<br>
 That I beguiled her ill;<br>
 The Tarnhelm must, I fear,<br>
 But half have hid my face.<br>
 Still, women's wrath<br>
 Soon is appeased:<br>
 That I won her for thee<br>
 Thankful thy wife will be yet.</p>
 <p>[<i>He turns again to the vassals</i>.]</p>
 <p>Follow me, men,<br>
 With mirth to the feast!</p>
 <p>[<i>To the women</i>.]</p>
 <p>Gaily, women,<br>
 Help at the wedding!<br>
 Joyfully laugh<br>
 Love and delight!<br>
 In hall and grove<br>

 This day more merry than I!<br>
 Ye whom love has blessed,</p>

 <p>Well know I Siegfried's<br>

 How hard in battle to slay him;<br>

 The arts I know,<br>
 To preserve his body from harm.</p>

 <p align="CENTER">Brünnhilde</p>
 <p>In battle none;--yet--<br>

 <p>[<i>As Gunther turns impetuously towards the hall with Brünnhilde they are met by the bridal procession coming out. Boys and girls, waving flower-wreathed staves, leap merrily in front. The vassals are carrying Siegfried on a shield and Gutrune on a seat. On the rising ground at the back men-servants and maids are taking implements and beasts for sacrifice, by the various mountain-paths, to the altars, which they deck with flowers. Siegfried and the vassals blow wedding-calls on their horns. The women invite Brünnhilde to accompany them to Gutrune's side. Brünnhilde stares blankly at Gutrune, who beckons her with a friendly smile. Is Brünnhilde is about to step back angrily Hagen comes quickly between them and presses her to wards Gunther, who takes her hand again, whereupon he allows himself to be raised on a shield by the men. Is the procession, scarcely interrupted, moves on quickly again towards the height, the curtain falls</i>.]</p>
