 This book is a ground-breaking study of the Greek institution of
 <i>paiderastia</i>.
 This was a custom by which adolescent men made alliances with
 older men of a romantic and sexual nature.
 The young men in question were the same age as contemporary teen pop stars
 (aproximately from puberty to the Athenian age of majority, 21).
 And they were treated similarly, as celebrities, showered with gifts
 and attention, and fought over by lovers.
 Philosophers such as Plato considered these same-sex unions as a remedy for
 tyranny, the bedrock of a cultured society, and the purest form of love.
 </p><p>
 The point of this essay is never made explicit,
 but it is still very relevant. 
 The ancient Greek civilization lasted for hundreds of years,
 invented democracy, built amazing monumental buildings,
 developed advanced philosophy, drama and literature,
 and defeated the Persian empire.
 And no small part of this success was due to the openly
 acknowledged contribution of gay people.
 This proves specious the argument (most recently advanced by a certain President
 of the United States) that homosexuals achieving parity in a society means
 the end of civilization "as we know it".

 Symonds, who also wrote
 <a href="../pme/index.htm">A Problem in Modern Ethics</a>,
 was an accomplished classicist, and a pioneering (if closeted)
 self-realized gay person.
 This book was originally published privately
 for the use of 'Medical Psychologists and Jurists';
 this figleaf was neccesary in the repressive climate of Victorian England.
 The number of copies supposedly
 was not to exceed 100; however, if the number of used 'first edition'
 copies available is any indication the print run far exceeded that number,
 or possibly this sensational tract had a number of pirate editions.</p>
