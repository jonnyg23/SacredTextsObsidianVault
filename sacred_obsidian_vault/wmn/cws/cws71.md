 <h4 align="CENTER">LAMBDA, OR THE LAST OF THE GODS[U]; BEING THE SECRET OF SATAN <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">1</font></a></h4>
 <p>AND on the seventh day there went forth from the presence of God a mighty angel, full of wrath and consuming, and God gave unto him the dominion of the outermost sphere.</p>
 <p>2. Eternity brought forth time; the boundless gave birth to limit; being descended into generation.</p>
 <p>3. As lightning I beheld Satan fall from heaven, splendid in strength and fury.</p>
 <p>4. Among the Gods is none like unto Him, into whose hand are committed the kingdoms, the power and the glory of the worlds:</p>
 <p>5. Thrones and empires, the dynasties of kings, the fall of nations, the birth of churches, the triumphs of time.</p>
 <p>6. They arise and pass, they were and are not; the sea and the dust and the immense mystery of space devour them.</p>
 <p>7. The tramp of armies, the voices of joy and of pain, the cry of the new-born babe, the shout of the warrior mortally smitten.</p>
 <p>8. Marriage, divorce, division, violent deaths, martyrdoms, tyrannous ignorances, the impotence of passionate protest, and the mad longing for oblivion:</p>
 <p>9. The eyes of the tiger in the jungle, the fang of the snake, the ftor of slaughter-houses, the wail of innocent beasts in pain:</p>
 <p>10. The innumerable incarnations of spirit, the strife towards manhood, the ceaseless pulse and current of desire:--</p>
 <p>11. These are his who beareth all the Gods on his shoulders;[V] who establisheth the pillars of necessity and fate.</p>
 <p>12. Many names hath God given him, names of mystery, secret and terrible.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 170</font></a></p>
 <p>13. God called him Satan the Adversary, because matter opposeth spirit, and time accuseth even the saints of the Lord.</p>
 <p>14. And the Destroyer, for his arm breaketh and grindeth to pieces; wherefore the fear and the dread of him are upon all flesh.</p>
 <p>15. And the Avenger, for he is the anger of God; his breath shall burn up all the souls of the wicked.</p>
 <p>16. And the Sifter, for he straineth all things through his sieve, dividing the husk from the grain; discovering the thoughts of the heart; proving and purifying the spirit of man.</p>
 <p>17. And the Deceiver, for he maketh the false appear true, and concealeth the real under the mask of illusion.</p>
 <p>18. And the Tempter, for he setteth snares before the feet of the elect: he beguileth with vain shows, and seduceth with enchantments.</p>
 <p>19. Blessed are they who withstand his subtlety: they shall be called the Sons of God, and shall enter in at the beautiful gates.</p>
 <p>20. For Satan is the doorkeeper of the temple of the King: he standeth in Solomon's porch; he holdeth. the keys of the sanctuary;</p>
 <p>21. That no man may enter therein save the Anointed, having the arcanum of Hermes.</p>
 <p>22. For Satan is the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom.</p>
 <p>23. He is the devourer of the unwise and the evil: they shall all be meat and drink to him.</p>
 <p>24. Whatsoever he devoureth, that shall never more return into being.</p>
 <p>25. Fear him, for after he hath killed, he hath power to cast into hell.</p>
 <p>26. But he is the servant of the Sons of God, and of the children of light.</p>
 <p>27. They shall go before him, and he shall follow the steps of the wise.</p>
 <p>28. Stand in awe of him and sin not: speak his name with trembling; and beseech God daily to deliver thee.</p>
 <p>29. For Satan is the magistrate of the justice of God: he beareth the balance and the sword,</p>
 <p>30. To execute judgment and vengeance upon all who come short of the commandments of God; to weigh their works, to measure their desire, and to number their days,</p>
 <p>31. For to him are committed weight and measure and number.</p>
 <p><a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 171</font></a></p>
 <p>32. And all things must pass under the rod and through the balance, and be fathomed by the sounding-lead.</p>
 <p>33. Therefore Satan is the minister of God, Lord of the seven mansions of Hades, the angel of the manifest worlds.</p>
 <p>34. And God hath put a girdle about his loins, and the name of the girdle is Death.</p>
 <p>35. Threefold are its coils, for threefold is the power of Death, dissolving the body, the ghost, and the soul.</p>
 <p>36. And that girdle is black within, but where Phoibos strikes it is silver.</p>
 <p>37. None of the Gods is girt save Satan, for upon him only is the shame of generation.</p>
 <p>38. He hath lost his virginal estate: uncovering heavenly secrets, he hath entered into bondage.</p>
 <p>39. He encompasseth with bonds and limits all things which are made: he putteth chains round about the worlds, and determineth their orbits.</p>
 <p>40. By him are creation and appearance; by him birth and transformation; the day of begetting and the night of death.</p>
 <p>41. The glory of Satan is the shadow of the Lord: the throne of Satan is the footstool of Adonai.</p>
 <p>42. Twain are the armies of God: in heaven the hosts of Michael; in the abyss the legions of Satan.</p>
 <p>43. These are the unmanifest and the manifest; the free and the bound; the virginal and the fallen.</p>
 <p>44. And both are the ministers of the Father, fulfilling the word divine.</p>
 <p>45. The legions of Satan are the creative emanations, having the shapes of dragons, of Titans, and of elemental gods;</p>
 <p>46. Forsaking the intelligible world, <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">1</font></a> seeking manifestation, renouncing their first estate;</p>
 <p>47. Which were cast out into chaos, neither was their place found any more in heaven.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(2)</p>
 <p>48. Evil is the result of limitation, and Satan is the Lord of limit.</p>
 <p>49. He is the father of lies, because matter is the cause of illusion.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 172</font></a></p>
 <p>50. To understand the secret of the kingdom of God, and to read the riddle of <i>Maya</i>, this is to have Satan under foot.</p>
 <p>51. He only can put Satan under foot who is released by thought from the bonds of desire.</p>
 <p>52. Nature is the allegory of spirit: all that appeareth to the sense is deceit: to know the truth,--this alone shall make men free.</p>
 <p>53. For the kingdom of Satan is the house of matter: yea, his mansion is the sepulchre of Golgotha, wherein on the seventh day the Lord lay sleeping, keeping the Sabbath of the unmanifest.</p>
 <p>54. For the day of Satan is the night of spirit: the manifestation of the worlds of form is the rest of the worlds informulate.</p>
 <p>55. Holy and venerable is the Sabbath of God: blessed and sanctified is the name of the angel of Hades;</p>
 <p>56. Whom the Anointed shall overcome, rising again from the dead on the first day of the week.</p>
 <p>57. For the place of Satan is the bourne of divine impulsion: there is the arrest of the outgoing force; Luza, the station of pause and slumber:</p>
 <p>58. Where Jacob lay down and dreamed, beholding the ladder which reached from earth to heaven.</p>
 <p>59. For Jacob is the planetary angel Iacchos, the Lord of the body;</p>
 <p>60. Who hath left his father's house, and is gone out into a far country.</p>
 <p>61. Yet is Luza none other than Bethel; the kingdom of Satan is become the kingdom of God and of His Christ.</p>
 <p>62. For there the Anointed awakeneth, arising from sleep, and goeth his way rejoicing;</p>
 <p>63. Having seen the vision of God, and beheld the secret of Satan;</p>
 <p>64. Even as the Lord arose from the dead and brake the seal of the sepulchre;[V]</p>
 <p>65. Which is the portal of heaven, Luza, the house of separation, the place of stony sleep;</p>
 <p>66. Where is born the centripetal force, drawing the soul upward and inward to God;</p>
 <p>67. Recalling Existence into Being, resuming the kingdoms of matter in spirit;[W]</p>
 <p>68. Until Satan return unto his first estate, and enter again into the heavenly obedience;</p>
 <p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a></p>
 <p>69. Having fulfilled the will of the Father, and accomplished his holy ministry,</p>
 <p>70. Which was ordained of God before the worlds, for the splendour of the manifest, and for the generation of Christ our Lord;[X]</p>
 <p>71. Who shall judge the quick and the dead, putting all things under his feet; whose are the dominion, the power, the glory, and the Amen.[A]</p>
