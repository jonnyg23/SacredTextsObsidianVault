 <h4 align="CENTER">GAMMA, OR THE MYSTERY OF REDEMPTION</h4>
 <p>ALL things are formed of the Divine Substance, which is the Divine idea.</p>
 <p>2. Therefore all things are one, as God is one.</p>
 <p>3. And every monad of the Divine Substance hath in itself the potency of twain, as God is twain in one.</p>
 <p>4. And every monad which is manifest, is manifest by the evolution of its Trinity.</p>
 <p>5. For thus only can it bear record of itself, and become cognisable as an entity.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a></p>
 <p>6. There are three which bear record in the Holy of Holies,--the Spirit, the Water, and the Word,--and these three are one,</p>
 <p>7. And there are three which bear record in the outer world, the life, the soul, and the body,--and these three agree in one.</p>
 <p>8. As is God, so is all which goes forth from God.</p>
 <p>9. From the imponderable particles of physical light, to the molecules of the lead of the outermost circle,[D]</p>
 <p>10. All things in heaven and in earth are of God, both the invisible and the visible.</p>
 <p>11. Such as is the invisible, is the visible also, for there is no boundary line betwixt spirit and matter.</p>
 <p>12. Matter is spirit made exteriorly cognisable by the force of the Divine Word.</p>
 <p>13. And when God shall resume all things by love, the material shall be resolved into the spiritual, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth.</p>
 <p>14. Not that matter shall be destroyed, for it came forth from God, and is of God indestructible and eternal.</p>
 <p>15. But it shall be indrawn and resolved into its true self.</p>
 <p>16. It shall put off corruption, and remain incorruptible.</p>
 <p>17. It shall put off mortality, and remain immortal.</p>
 <p>18. So that nothing be lost of the Divine substance.</p>
 <p>19. It was material entity: it shall be spiritual entity.</p>
 <p>20. For there is nothing which can go out from the presence of God.</p>
 <p>21. This is the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead: that is, the transfiguration of the body.[O]</p>
 <p>22. For the body, which is matter, is but the manifestation of spirit: and the Word of God shall transmute it into its inner being.</p>
 <p>23. The will of God is the alchemic crucible: and the dross which is cast therein is matter.</p>
 <p>24. And the dross shall become pure gold, seven times refined; even perfect spirit.</p>
 <p>25. It shall leave behind it nothing: but shall be transformed into the Divine image.</p>
 <p>26. For it is not a new substance: but its alchemic polarity is changed, and it is converted.</p>
 <p>27. But except it were gold in its true nature, it could not be resumed into the aspect of gold.</p>
 <p>28. And except matter were spirit, it could not revert to spirit.</p>
 <p>29. To make gold, the alchemist must have gold.</p>
 <p>30. But he knows that to be gold which others take to be dross.</p>

 <p>31. Cast thyself into the will of God, and thou shalt become as God.</p>
 <p>32. For thou art God, if thy will be the Divine will.</p>
 <p>33. This is the great secret: it is the mystery of redemption.</p>
