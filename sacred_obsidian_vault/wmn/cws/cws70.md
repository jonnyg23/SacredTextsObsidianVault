 <h4 align="CENTER">THETA, OR (MYSTICALLY) THE FOURTH OF THE GODS[L]</h4>
 <h5 align="CENTER">PART I</h5>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">The Hymn of Aphrodite <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">(1)</p>
 <p>I AM the dawn, daughter of heaven and of the deep: the sea-mist covers my beauty with a veil of tremulous light.</p>
 <p>2. I am Aphrodite, the sister of Phoibos, opener of heaven's gates, the beginning of wisdom, the herald of the perfect day.</p>
 <p>3. Long had darkness covered the deep: the soul of all things slumbered: the valleys were filled with shadows: only the mountains and the stars held commune together.</p>
 <p>4. There was no light on the ways of the earth: the rolling world moved outward on her axe <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">2</font></a>: gloom and mystery shrouded the faces of the Gods.</p>
 <p>5. Then from out the deep I arose, dispeller of night: the firmament of heaven kindled with joy beholding me.</p>
 <p>6. The secrets of the waters were revealed: the eyes of Zeus looked down into the heart thereof.</p>
 <p>7. Ruddy as wine were the depths: the raiment of earth was transfigured; as one arising from the dead She arose, full of favour and grace.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(2)</p>
 <p>8. Of God and the soul is love born: in the silence of twilight; in the mystery of sleep.</p>
 <p>9. In the fourth dimension of space; in the womb of the heavenly principle; in the heart of the man of God,--there is love enshrined.</p>
 <p>10. Yea, I am before all things: desire is born of me: I impel the springs of life inward unto God: by me the earth and heavens are drawn together.</p>
 <p>11. But I am hidden until the time of the day's appearing: I lie beneath the waters of the sea, in the deeps of the soul: the bird</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a></p>
 <p>of night seeth me not, the herds in the valleys, nor the wild goat in the cleft of the hill.</p>
 <p>12. As the fishes of the sea am I covered: I am secret and veiled from sight as the children of the deep.</p>
 <p>13. That which is occult hath the fish for a symbol; for the fish is hidden in darkness and silence: he knoweth the secret places of the earth, and the springs of the hollow sea.</p>
 <p>14. Even so love reacheth to the uttermost: so find I the secrets of all things; having my beginning and my end in the Wisdom of God.</p>
 <p>15. The Spirit of Counsel is begotten in the soul; even as the fish in the bosom of the waters.</p>
 <p>16. From the sanctuary of the deep love ariseth: salvation is of the sea.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(3)</p>
 <p>17. I am the crown of manifold births and deaths: I am the interpreter of mysteries and the enlightener of souls.</p>
 <p>18. In the elements of the body is love imprisoned: lying asleep in the caves of Iacchos; in the crib of the oxen of Demeter.[S]</p>
 <p>19. But when the day-star of the soul ariseth over the earth, then is the epiphany of love.</p>
 <p>20. Therefore until the labour of the third day be fulfilled, the light of love is unmanifest.</p>
 <p>21. Then shall I unlock the gates of dawn; and the glory of God shall ascend before the eyes of men.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(4)</p>
 <p>22. The secret of the angel Anael is at the heart of the world: the "Song of God" is the sound of the stars in their courses.</p>
 <p>23. O love, thou art the latent heat of the earth; the strength of the wine; the joy of the orchard and the cornfield: thou art the spirit of song and laughter, and of the desire of life.</p>
 <p>24. By thee, O goddess, pure-eyed and golden, the sun and the moon are revealed: love is the counsellor of heaven.</p>
 <p>25. Cloud and vapour melt before thee: thou unveilest to earth the rulers of the immeasurable skies.</p>
 <p>26. Thou makest all things luminous: thou discoverest all deeps;</p>
 <p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a></p>
 <p>27. From the womb of the sea to the heights of heaven; from the shadowy abyss to the throne of the Lord.</p>
 <p>28. Thy beloved is as a ring-dove, wearing the ensign of the spirit, and knowing the secrets thereof.</p>
 <p>29. Fly, fly, O Dove; the time of spring cometh; in the far east the dawn ariseth; she hath a message for thee to bear from earth to heaven![T]</p>
 <h5 align="CENTER">PART 2</h5>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">A Discourse of the Communion of Soules, and of the Uses of Love between Creature and Creature: being Part of the Goldene Booke of Venus. <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>1. Herein is Love's Secret, and the Mysterie of the Communion of Saintes.</p>
 <p>2. Love redeemeth, Love lifteth up, Love enlighteneth, Love advanceth Soules.</p>
 <p>3. Love dissolveth not, neither forgetteth; for she is of the Soule and hath everlasting Remembrance.</p>
 <p>4. Verilie Love is doubly blessed; for She enricheth both Giver and Receiver.</p>
 <p>5. Thou who lovest givest of thyself to thy Beloved, and he is dowered withal.</p>
 <p>6. And if any Creature whom thou lovest suffereth Death and departeth from thee;</p>
 <p>7. Fain wouldst thou give of thine Heartes Blood to have him live always; to sweeten the Changes before him, or to lift him to some happie Place.</p>
 <p>S. Thou droppest teares on the broken Body of thy Beloved; thy Desire goeth after him, and thou criest unto his Ghoste,--</p>
 <p>9. "O Dearest! would God that I might be with thee where now thou art, and know what now thou doest!</p>
 <p>10. "Would God that I might still guard and protect thee; that I might defend thee from all Pain, and Wrong, and Affliction!</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p>
 <p>11. "But what Manner of Change is before thee I know not; neither can mine Eyes follow thy Steppes.</p>
 <p>12. "Many are the Lives set before thee, and the Yeares, O Beloved, are long and weary that shall part us!</p>
 <p>13. "Shall I knowe thee again when I see thee, and will the Spirit of God say to thee in that day, 'This is thy Beloved'?</p>
 <p>14. "O Soule of my Soule! would God I were one with thee, even though it were in death!</p>
 <p>15. "Thou hast all of my Love, my Desire, and my Sorrowe; yea, my Life is mingled with thine, and is gone forth with thee!</p>
 <p>16. "Visit me in Dreames; comfort me in the Night-watches; let my Ghoste meet thine in the Land of Shadows and of Sleep!</p>
 <p>17. "Every nighte with fervent Longing will I seek thee; Persephone and Slumber shall give me back the Past.</p>
 <p>18. "Yea, Death shall not take thee wholly from me; for Part of me is in thee, and where thou goest, Dearest, there my Hearte followeth!"</p>
 <p>19. So weepest thou and lamentest, because the Soul thou lovest is taken from thy Sight.</p>
 <p>20. And Life seemeth to thee a Bitter Thing; yea, thou cursest the Destiny of all living Creatures.</p>
 <p>21. And thou deemest thy Love of no Avail, and thy Teares as idle Droppes.</p>
 <p>22. Behold, Love is a Ransome, and the Teares thereof are Prayeres.</p>
 <p>23. And if thou have lived purely, thy fervent Desire shall be counted Grace to the Soule of thy Dead.</p>
 <p>24. For the burning and continual Prayere of the juste availeth much.</p>
 <p>25. Yea, thy Love shall enfold the Soule which thou lovest; it shall be unto him a wedding Garment and a Vesture of Blessing.</p>
 <p>26. The Baptisme of thy Sorrowe shall baptize thy Dead, and he shall rise because of it.</p>
 <p>27. Thy Prayeres shall lift him up, and thy Teares shall encompasse his Steppes; thy Love shall be to him a Light shining upon the upward Waye.</p>
 <p>28. And the Angels of God shall say unto him, "O happie Soule, that art so well beloved; that art made so strong with all these Teares and Sighs.</p>
 <p>29. "Praise the Father of Spirits therefor, for this great Love shall save thee many Incarnations.</p>
 <p><a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a></p>
 <p>30. "Thou art advanced thereby; thou art drawn aloft and carried upward by Cordes of Grace."</p>
 <p>31. For in such wise do Soules profit one another and have Communion, and receive and give Blessing, the Departed of the Living, and the Living of the Departed.</p>
 <p>32. And so much the more as the Hearte within them is clean, and the Waye of their Intention is innocent in the Sight of God.</p>
 <p>33. Yea, the Saint is a strong Redeemer; the Spirit of God striveth within him.</p>
 <p>34. And God withstandeth not God; for Love and God are One.</p>
 <p>35. As the Love of Christ hath Power with the Elect, so hath Power in its degree the Love of a Man for his Friend.</p>
 <p>36. Yea, though the Soule beloved be little and mean, a Creature not made in the Likenesse of Men.</p>
 <p>37. For in the eyes of Love there is nothing little nor poor, nor unworthy of Prayere.</p>
 <p>38. O little Soule, thou art mighty if a Child of God love thee; yea, poor and simple Soule, thou art possessed of great Riches.</p>
 <p>39. Better is thy Portion than the Portion of Kings whom the Curse of the Oppressed pursueth.</p>
 <p>40. For as Love is strong to redeem and to advance a Soule, so is Hatred strong to torment and to detain.</p>
 <p>41. Blessed is the Soule whom the Juste commemorate before God; for whom the Poor and the Orphan and the dumb Creature weep.</p>
 <p>42. And thou, O Righteous Man, that with burning Love bewailest the Death of the Innocent, whom thou canst not save from the Hands of the Unjuste;</p>
 <p>43. Thou who wouldst freely give of thine own Blood to redeem thy Brother and to loosen the Bonds of his Paine;</p>
 <p>44. Know that in the Hour of thy supreme Desire, God accepteth thine Oblation.</p>
 <p>45. And thy Love shall not return unto thee! empty; according to the Greatnesse of her Degree, she shall accomplish thy Will.</p>
 <p>46. And thy Sorrowe and Teares, and the Travaile of thy Spirit, shall be Grace and Blessing to the Soule thou wouldst redeem.</p>
 <p>47. Count not as lost thy Suffering on behalf of other Soules; for every Cry is a Prayere, and all Prayere is Power.</p>
 <p>48. That thou willest to do is done; thine Intention is united to the Will of Divine Love.</p>
 <p><a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a></p>
 <p>49. Nothing is lost of that which thou layest out for God and for thy Brother.</p>
 <p>50. And it is Love alone who redeemeth, and Love hath nothing of her own.</p>
