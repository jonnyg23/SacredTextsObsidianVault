 <p>I BELIEVE in one God; the Father and Mother Almighty; of whose substance are the generations of Heaven and of earth: And in Christ Jesus the Son of God, our Lord; who is conceived of the Holy Ghost; born of the Virgin Mary; suffereth under the world-rulers; is crucified, dead, and buried; who descendeth into hell; who riseth again from the dead; who ascendeth into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God; by whose law the quick and the dead are judged. I believe in the Seven Spirits of God; the Kingdom of Heaven; the communion of the elect; the passing-through of souls; the redemption of the body; the life everlasting; and the Amen. <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="cws58.htm#fn_193"><font size="1">2</font></a> [A]</p>
