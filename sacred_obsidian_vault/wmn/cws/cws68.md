 <h4 align="CENTER">ZETA, OR THE SECOND OF THE GODS</h4>
 <h5 align="CENTER">PART I</h5>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Proem</p>
 <p>AND the Spirit of Wisdom gave counsel, whose is the angel of the innermost sphere, the brightest of the sons of heaven.</p>
 <p>2. Lord Adonai, who createst, remember the souls beneath Thine altar. <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>3. And put a firmament between them and Thee, to divide the upper from the nether, and the inner from the without.</p>
 <p>4. And whereas there hath been but one, let there henceforth be twain, the form and the substance, the apparent and the real;</p>
 <p>5. That they who are bound may remain in the outer element.</p>
 <p>6. But to me Thou committest thine only begotten, who shall enter within the veil.</p>
 <p>7. And God made a firmament in the midst of all being, and divided the spirit from the body.</p>
 <p>8. And the firmament is the gate of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
 <p>9. And God gave the keys thereof to the angel of the second sphere, whose spirit is the Spirit of Understanding.</p>
 <p>10. He is Hermes, the mediator, for he mediates between the outer and the inner.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a></p>
 <p>11. He is the transmuter and the healer, Raphael the physician of souls.</p>
 <p>12. There is no riddle he shall not solve for thee, nor any solid he shall not melt, nor any wall he shall not pass through.</p>
 <p>13. Many are his states and his aspects; his weight is as lead, he runneth like water, he is light as the mist of dawn.</p>
 <p>14. Yet he is as a rock between earth and heaven, and the Lord God shall build his Church thereon;[F]</p>
 <p>15. As a city upon a mountain of stone, whose windows look forth on either side.</p>
 <p>16. And upon the left are the kingdoms of the world and the shapes of illusion; and upon the right are the heights of heaven and the kingdom of spirit.</p>
 <p>17. And to him are committed the keys of the invisible, and of the Holy of Holies within the veil.</p>
 <p>18. Whatsoever soul he shall bind, shall be bound in the outer and the nether.</p>
 <p>19. And whatsoever soul he shall loose, shall be loosed in the inner and the upper.</p>
 <p>20. He shutteth and no man openeth; he setteth free and none shall bind again.</p>
 <p>21. And his number is the number of twain; he is the angel of the twofold states. <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>22. And the waters below and above the firmament, are the evening and the morning of the second day.[G]</p>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Hymn to Hermes <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>1. As a moving light between heaven and earth; as a white cloud assuming many shapes;</p>
 <p>2. He descends and rises, he guides and illumines, he transmutes himself from small to great, from bright to shadowy, from the opaque image to the diaphanous mist.</p>
 <p>3. Star of the East conducting the Magi: cloud from whose midst the holy voice speaketh: by day a pillar of vapour, by night a shining flame.</p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>
 <p>4. I behold thee, Hermes, Son of God, slayer of Argus,[H] archangel, who bearest the rod of knowledge, by which all things in heaven or on earth are measured.</p>
 <p>5. Double serpents entwine it, because as serpents they must be wise who desire God.'</p>
 <p>6. And upon thy feet are living wings, bearing thee fearless through space and over the abyss of darkness; because they must be without dread to dare the void and. the deep, who desire to attain and to achieve.</p>
 <p>7. Upon thy side thou wearest a sword of a single stone, two-edged, whose temper resisteth all things.</p>
 <p>8. For they who would slay or save must be armed with a strong and perfect will, defying and penetrating with no uncertain force.</p>
 <p>9. This is Herpe, the sword which destroyeth demons; by whose aid the hero overcometh, and the saviour is able to deliver.</p>
 <p>10. Except thou bind it upon thy thigh thou shalt be overborne, and blades of mortal making shall prevail against thee.</p>
 <p>11. Nor is this all thine equipment, Son of God; the covering of darkness is upon thine head, and none is able to strike thee.</p>
 <p>12. This is the magic hat, brought from Hades, the region of silence, where they are who speak not.</p>
 <p>13. He who bears the world on his shoulders shall give it to thee, lest the world fall on thee, and thou be ground into powder.[J]</p>
 <p>14. For he who has perfect wisdom and knowledge, he whose steps are without fear, and whose will is single and all-pervading;</p>
 <p>15. Even he must also know how to keep the divine secret, and not to expose the holy mysteries of God to the senses of the wicked.</p>
 <p>16. Keep a bridle upon thy lips, and, cover thy head in the day of battle.</p>
 <p>17. These are the four excellent things,--the rod, the wings, the sword, and the hat.</p>
 <p>18. Knowledge, which thou must gain with labour: the spirit of holy boldness, which cometh by faith in God; a mighty will, and a complete discretion.</p>
 <p>19. He who discovers <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">1</font></a> the holy mysteries is lost.</p>
 <p>20. Go thy way in silence, and see thou tell no man.</p>

 <h5 align="CENTER">PART 2</h5>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">An Exhortation of Hermes to his Neophytes <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>I. He whose adversaries fight with weapons of steel, must himself be armed in like manner, if he would not be ignominiously slain or save himself by flight.</p>
 <p>2. And not only so, but forasmuch as his adversaries may be many, while he is only one; it is even necessary that the steel he carries be of purer temper and of more subtle point and contrivance than theirs.</p>
 <p>3. 1, Hermes, would arm you with such, that bearing a blade with a double edge, ye may be able to withstand in the evil hour.</p>
 <p>4. For it is written that the tree of life is guarded by a sword which turneth every way.</p>
 <p>5. Therefore I would have you armed both with a perfect philosophy and with the power of the divine life.</p>
 <p>6. And first the knowledge; that you and they who hear you may know the reason of the faith which is in you.</p>
 <p>7. But knowledge cannot prevail alone, and ye are not yet perfected.</p>
 <p>8. When the fulness of the time shall come, I will add unto you the power of the divine life.</p>
 <p>9. It is the life of contemplation, of fasting, of obedience, and of resistance.</p>
 <p>10. And afterwards the chrism, the power, and the glory. But these are not yet.</p>
 <p>11. Meanwhile remain together and perfect your philosophy.</p>
 <p>12. Boast not, and be not lifted up; for all things are God's, and ye are in God, and God in you.</p>
 <p>13. But when the word shall come to you, be ready to obey.</p>
 <p>14. There is but one way to power, and it is the way of obedience.</p>
 <p>15. Call no man your master or king upon the earth, lest ye forsake the spirit for the form and become idolaters. <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a></p>
 <p>16. He who is indeed spiritual, and transformed into the divine image, desires a spiritual king.</p>
 <p>17. Purify your bodies, and eat no dead thing that has looked with living eyes upon the light of Heaven.</p>
 <p>18. For the eye is the symbol of brotherhood among you. Sight is the mystical sense.</p>
 <p>19. Let no man take the life of his brother to feed withal his own.</p>
 <p>20. But slay only such as are evil; in the name of the Lord.</p>
 <p>21. They are miserably deceived who expect eternal life, and restrain not their hands from blood and death.</p>
 <p>22. They are miserably deceived who look for wives from on high, and have not yet attained their manhood.</p>
 <p>23. Despise not the gift of knowledge; and make not spiritual eunuchs of yourselves.</p>
 <p>24. For Adam -was first formed, then Eve.</p>
 <p>25. Ye are twain, the man with the woman, <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="cws69.htm#fn_215"><font size="1">1</font></a> and she with him, neither man nor woman, but one creature.</p>
 <p>26. And the kingdom of God is within you.[K]</p>
