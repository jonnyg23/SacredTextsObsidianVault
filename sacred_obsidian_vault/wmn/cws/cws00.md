 <h4 align="CENTER">DEDICATION</h4>
 <p>To the numerous and world-wide circle of genuine students of Divine things, who recognised in Anna Kingsford a Seer, an Interpreter, and a Prophet of the rarest lucidity and inspiration, and a foremost herald of the dawning better age: and especially to the Friend whose instant and enthusiastic appreciation proved an invaluable support in a position of peculiar difficulty, and beneath whose roof some of the illuminations herein contained were received, but who desires to remain unnamed: and also to the "friend, disciple, and literary heir of the renowned magian, the late Abbé Constant ("Eliphas Levi")"--namely, to the Baron Giuseppe Spedalieri, for manifold tokens of high approbation and devoted friendship-this book is affectionately inscribed.</p>
 <p>"And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people; and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth, and sea and fountains of waters."</p>
