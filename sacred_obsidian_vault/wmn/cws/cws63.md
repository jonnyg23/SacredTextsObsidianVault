 <p>IN the beginning, the potentialities of all things were in Elohim.</p>
 <p>2. And Elohim. was twain, the Spirit and the Water,--that is, the heavenly deep.</p>
 <p>3. Now the spirit of Elohim is original life, and the heavenly waters are space and dimension.</p>
 <p>4. He is the line, and She is the circle.</p>
 <p>5. And without them is void and darkness.</p>
 <p>6. Now the Divine twain were from the beginning contained in the bosom of the One who was before the beginning:</p>
 <p>7. Even God the nameless, invisible, unfathomable, unspeakable, motionless:</p>
 <p>8. From whom proceeded the heavens--that is, the duality, spirit, and deep--and the earth--that is, spiritually, the beyond.</p>
 <p>9. Now the beyond was without form and void, and darkness covered the face of it.</p>
 <p>10. But the heavenly waters were covered by the Spirit of God.</p>
