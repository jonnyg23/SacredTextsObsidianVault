 <p>Sing now, my muse, of the Goddess of Chaos,<br> Arising from primeval Quantum foam born,<br> Goddess of Entropy, Goddess of Anarchy,<br> She who creates and destroys innumerable cosmos<br> In the gap between dawn and the rise of the sun,<br> She who dances between unseen fractal dimensions,<br> In a small still place all enfolded in storm,<br> Where tempests so huge, lighting rends open the quasars,<br> So massive no light escapes from her shroud,<br> She who sunders our soul from our sweet earthly flesh,<br> And brings us rebirth with her ghastly sweet breath,<br> Lover of Death and Lover of Life,<br> She dances a dance on the edge of a knife,<br> A gulf of ten thousand light years on each side,<br> And She never misses one step in the dark,<br> Singularity bound, in a teardrop of light,<br> Cocooned in the smallest, suffused in the largest,<br> Immortal Chaos wreathed with broken planets and dust,<br> Thy name is Eris, world shattering Goddess,<br> We ride your wave breathless and are towed under again.<br> Singularity Goddess, you approach inverse zero,<br> Still more drowned worlds loom in Thy billowing shroud.<br> Asleep and awake she dreams our creation,<br> The sound of a bell in an dark empty cavern,<br> The scent of a rose in a room long abandoned,<br> The dance of the motes in the eye of the Goddess,<br> The touch of a breeze in the heat of the noon,<br> The taste of wine from an ancient tomb offering<br> She is there always, and not there ever,<br> Look and you will miss her,<br> Close your eyes and she is before you.<br> Most terrible and most beautiful name of the Goddess, Eris!</p>
