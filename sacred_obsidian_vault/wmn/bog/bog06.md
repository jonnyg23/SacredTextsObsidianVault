 <p>By the Sun and Her brightness, <br> And the Moon when She follows Her, <br> And the day when it reveals Her,<br> And the Night when it enshrouds Her,<br> And the Sky and She who created it,<br> And the Earth and She who quickened it.<br> By the night enshrouding;<br> And the day resplendent;<br> And She Who hath created Orgasm<br> As for the lovers who are dutiful to the Goddess<br> And believe in her goodness;<br> Surely We will ease their way to the Grove of the Goddess<br> But as for they who are jealous, hateful and scorn knowledge,<br> And disbelieve in goodness;<br> Surely She will ease their way to adversity.<br> Their riches will not save them when they perish;<br> Lo! Hers it is to give the guidance.</p>
