 <h3 align="CENTER">ARES</h3>
 <p>The legend of the Amazons was not superficially rooted at Athens. This is proved by the fact that it found expression in cult practice at one of the greater festivals of the state. Before the <i>Thesea</i> the Athenians annually offered sacrifice to the Amazons, thus commemorating the victory of Theseus over the women. The decisive battle was said to have been fought on the day marked by the oblation of the <i>Boedromia</i>. <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">264</font></a> Plutarch <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">265</font></a> bases his belief in the reality of the invasion of Attica on three points: the place names, Amazonium and Horcomosium; the presence of graves of the fallen; the yearly sacrifice to the Amazons.</p>
 <p>The general view of ancient writers <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">266</font></a> is that the Amazons made the Areopagus the basis of their operations, having established their camp there in a spot thenceforth called the Amazonium <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">267</font></a> Aeschylus <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">268</font></a> derives the name of the hill itself from the fact that there the Amazons offered frequent sacrifice <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">269</font></a> to Ares while they held it as a citadel against the Acropolis. The statement is remarkable in view of two facts which seem to show Ares as the patron of Theseus rather</p>

 <p>than of the Amazons: Plutarch, <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">270</font></a> quoting Clidemus, says that before entering the critical battle with the Amazons Theseus sacrificed to Phobus, son of Ares, and hereby won the day; the tradition <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">271</font></a> at Troezen told that Theseus commemorated his victory over the Amazons there by dedicating a temple to Ares at the entrance to the Genethlium.</p>
 <p>It is therefore impossible to determine the exact relation in which Ares stood to the Amazons in the story of the invasion of Greece. All that may be said is that his name belongs to the saga of Theseus and the Amazons in the two accounts, the Attic and the Troezenian. It must be added that the saga bears the marks of great age. Herein Theseus is not an intruder, as he evidently is in the tales of the storm of Themiscyra, nor is he a substitute for Heracles. The story is primarily concerned with Theseus himself, the great hero of the two states. While in the former it is connected with ritual acts, in the latter it is hallowed by association with the Genethlium, the traditional birth-place of Theseus. <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">272</font></a> Moreover, on the tradition of the Amazons at Troezen rests the story of Hippolytus, whose sepulchre assured the safety of the nation. <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">273</font></a></p>
 <p>The Attic traditions about Theseus were concerned chiefly with his adventures in Crete. With retrospect toward these the Athenians celebrated the festivals of the <i>Oschophoria</i>, the <i>Pyanepsia</i>, and the <i>Thesea</i>. Ariadne, as it has been stated, <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">274</font></a> was probably a Cretan goddess, with whose worship at Athens are to be connected the rites of the Oschophoria, wherein two youths disguised as maidens led the girls' chorus. The implication</p>

 <p>is that the Oriental idea of sex confusion was associated with the festival. It seems therefore that the ceremonies instituted by Theseus reflect the Anatolian worship of Cybele. It accords with the customary restraint of Hellenic habits that the Oriental idea shown in the cults of Cybele, Ephesian Artemis, and the Syrian Goddess, manifested itself at Athens merely in a pleasing masque. The name of Theseus also connected Troezen with Crete. Phaedra, the wife with whom he lived at Troezen, is famous as the destroyer of the Amazon's son, Hippolytus, and as another princess of the house of Minos. Thus in its twofold aspect the tradition of Theseus suggests the time when "Minoan" Crete was pre-eminent. It maybe that the association of the Amazon legend with the tale of Theseus is to be ascribed to some such source. In that case Ares, a deity whose cult had slight prominence in Greece, might by reason of his place in the saga of Theseus and the Amazons, be connected with the cult of Aphrodite-Ariadne. There is this suggestion in a note from Olen which Pausanias <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">275</font></a> inserts in the account of his visit to the shrine of Hebe at Phlius. Olen connects Ares with Hebe as her own brother, born of Hera. Her shrine at Phlius is shown to be very old by the fact that her worship here was in the strictest sense aniconic. Her annual festival of the "Ivy-Cuttings" has al hint of Dionysus and even of the ivy-shaped shields of the Amazons. From other sources it may be gathered that she was akin to Aphrodite-Ariadne. <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">276</font></a> Pausanias says that Hebe was substituted for her more ancient name, Ganymeda. In this there is reminiscence of the Trojan youth caught tip to heaven by Zeus. The feminine form implies the appropriation by one sex of the characteristics of the other. This might belong naturally to a Phrygian legend.</p>
 <p>A search for parallels to the association which Aeschylus</p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a></p>
 <p>mentions between Ares and the Amazons discovers first of all, as most striking, the legend told of the statue of Ares Γυναικο-θοίνας in the market-place at Tegea. <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">277</font></a> The statue was explained as the dedication of a band of Tegeate women who had won a victory over the Spartans in the time of King Charillus of Sparta. After peace was established the women instituted a festival in honour of Ares. Since men were excluded from the sacrifice and sacred banquet, the god was called "Entertainer of Women." It is interesting to find such a tale in Arcadian Tegea, the home of Atalanta, herself similar to the Amazons. It is worth bearing in mind that Atalanta won the spoils of the Calydonian hunt in the country of the Aetolians and Curetes, the kindred of the folk of pre-historic Pyrrhichus. In the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea, which contained these spoils, <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">278</font></a> Marpessa, leader of the women who honoured Ares, dedicated her shield. <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">279</font></a></p>
 <p>In the immediate neighbourhood of Tegea there was a shrine of Ares Ἀφνειός, <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">280</font></a> situated on a mountain of which the name Cresium implies the worship of Cretan Dionysus. <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">281</font></a> The epithet was explained by the story that Ares enabled his child Aëropus to draw milk from the breasts of his mother after her death. The mother Aërope, grand-daughter of Aleus, was akin to Atalanta. The lifetime of her child by Ares was placed in the generation preceding the Dorian Invasion. <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">282</font></a></p>
 <p>Elsewhere in Arcadia,--at Megalopolis <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">283</font></a> and near Acacesium <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">284</font></a>--there were monuments attesting the foundation of the cult of Ares in this canton in early days. With this</p>

 <p>should be compared the statement of Arnobius, <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">285</font></a> that there was a legend of thirteen months' servitude exacted of Ares in Arcadia. The general tendency of all the evidence is in support of the theory that the cult of Ares Γυναικοθοίνας originated in primitive times.</p>
 <p>There were two other legends of armed women in Greece, both localised, like the Tegeate story, in the Peloponnese. A statue of Ares at Argos was explained as the dedication of a band of women under the poetess Telesilla who had won a victory over the Spartans. <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">286</font></a> The other legend belonged to Sparta. Here a troop of women commemorated their victory over the Messenians by founding a temple to Aphrodite. <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">287</font></a> The most obvious interpretation of the epithet is to derive it from Ares and to render it "Warlike." It is used of Athena in three oaths of alliance suggestive of the martial character of the goddess. <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">288</font></a> The Athenians built a temple to Athena Ἀρεία at Plataea, constructed from the spoils of Marathon. <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">289</font></a> After his acquittal on the Areopagus Orestes is said to have dedicated an altar to Athena Ἀρεία. <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">290</font></a> In this the reference is evidently to the name of the hill on which the court sat which the Greeks themselves, however mistaken they may have been in their etymology, certainly connected with Ares. <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">291</font></a> These instances of the use of the epithet favour the idea that it was derived from the name of Ares. It may be argued that Aphrodite Ἀρεία was a type of the goddess conceived as guardian of the state. In this aspect she was more frequently worshipped at Sparta than elsewhere in Greece. The probabilities are that she was</p>

 <p>represented armed. <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">292</font></a> This political goddess of Sparta was the Oriental Aphrodite, called Urania. The fact that one group of armed women gave special honour to Ares, another to Aphrodite Ἀρεία, is of importance to the investigation. The hint that the two deities were in some way associated suggests connection between Ares and the Anatolian cult of the warlike Mother whom the Amazons worshipped.</p>
 <p>It would seem that the connection between Ares and the Warlike Aphrodite was not slight. At Thebes the joint cult of the two as a conjugal pair was established at an early date, <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">293</font></a> and their union was said to have given rise to the Cadmean family and thence to Dionysus. Through marriage with Harmonia, daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, Cadmus obtained the throne, and from the teeth of the serpent sacred to Ares he raised up the famous crop of warriors. <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">294</font></a> Tümpell <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">295</font></a> believes that the joint cult of Ares and Aphrodite originated at Thebes, and that from this city it spread through Greece, acquiring prominence in Attica and Arcadia. He finds the goddess to be the Oriental Urania, yet, strangely enough, he is unwilling to believe that she was conceived as an armed goddess in the earliest times at Thebes.</p>
 <p>In Laconia, where Warlike Aphrodite, or Urania, was specially reverenced, the cult of Ares was more dignified and apparently more ancient than in other parts of Greece. Epicharmus is said to have claimed the deity as a Spartan. <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">296</font></a> Under the name Enyalius he was worshipped by the Spartan ephebes. <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">297</font></a> Each of the two bands into which the youths were</p>

 <p>divided sacrificed a puppy to him, performing the ceremony at night in the Phoebaeum near Therapne. The ritual bears throughout the marks of primitive times. The most striking detail is the sacrifice of dogs, in mentioning which Pausanias remarks that he knows of only one other instance, namely, to Enodia, or Hecate, at Colophon. There are, however, other records of the practice, <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">298</font></a> in which it is noteworthy that the custom belongs to the worship of Hecate. Ares was worshipped under his own name at Therapne in a temple which Pausanias <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">299</font></a> describes as one of the earliest monuments in the region. The cult legend was that the image was brought from Colchis by the Dioscuri. The god had a strange epithet, Theritas, supposedly derived from Thero, the name of his nurse. Pausanias is so dissatisfied with this etymology that he suggests that the word was learned from the Colchians and was unintelligible to the Greeks. Wide <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">300</font></a> states a plausible hypothesis, that the cult was of Boeotian origin, basing his theory on the affiliations of the word Theritas. It may, however, have been a very early indigenous cult, for Therapne was evidently an important pre-Dorian site, as excavations have proved. <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">301</font></a> Here the Dioscuri received special honours, and Helen was worshipped from old times as a nature goddess. <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">302</font></a> Pausanias <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">303</font></a> was told that the town was named from a daughter of Lelex. It is possible to infer that the cult of Ares Theritas, in which the temple was one of the oldest monuments in a region where pre-Dorian influence was strong, was "Lelegian." The people who established it would thus be akin to the Curetes of Aetolia and Acarnania. The connection with the Dioscuri favours the theory. <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">304</font></a></p>

 <p>There are two other examples of the Laconian worship of Ares. As Enyalius <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">305</font></a> he had a statue at Sparta near the <i>Dromos</i>, which represented him in fetters. In <i>Ancient Village</i>, a hamlet near Geronthrae, he had a sacred grove and temple. Here there was an annual festival from which women were excluded. <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">306</font></a></p>
 <p>It is, on the whole, safe to conclude that in Laconia Ares was revered in early times. The cult may have been indigenous among the pre-Dorians, or it may have been an importation from Boeotia, where he was worshipped with Aphrodite. Possibly the Fettered Ares of Sparta should be connected with a Fettered Aphrodite <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">307</font></a> in the same city. The two types may have given rise to a tale like that of Arcadia, of the servitude of Ares, <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">308</font></a> and the "lay of Demodocus" in the Odyssey could be referred to some such myth. Traditions of armed women in Tegea and in Sparta serve to connect Ares in Arcadia with Aphrodite Ἀρεία in Sparta.</p>
 <p>There are not many traces of the cult of Ares elsewhere in Greece. The mythical genealogies of northern Greece associated him with Minyan Orchomenus, <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">309</font></a> Minyan Thessaly, <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">310</font></a> Curetis, <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">311</font></a> and Aetolia. <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">312</font></a> Mention has already been made of Thebes. At Athens <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">313</font></a> he was said to have been the father of Alcippe by Aglaurus, a primitive goddess. In the Peloponnese he was connected by genealogical legends with</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Tegea, <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">314</font></a> Elis, <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">315</font></a> and Tritea in Achaea. <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">316</font></a> It is impossible to give much weight to such myths unsupported by further evidence, inasmuch as there was a tendency among Greek writers of all times to consider any famous warrior of the heroic age a son of Ares. The statement applies also to warlike races like the Phlegyae, mentioned by Homer and other poets.</p>
 <p>This investigation of the worship of Ares in Greece proper yields two important results: first, it tends to indicate that the god was worshipped in primitive times; secondly, in the relation between the cult of Ares and that of the Oriental Aphrodite at an early date in Thebes, and in the hints of a similar connection in Arcadia and Laconia, there is the suggestion of contact with the Amazons, who worshipped a goddess resembling this Aphrodite. This raises the question whether the period may be determined in which the joint cult originated in Greek lands.</p>
 <p>Farnell <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">317</font></a> conjectures that at Thebes the Oriental goddess was brought from the east by the "Cadmeans," while Ares was an ancient god of the land. He believes that "by the fiction of a marriage" her cult was reconciled to the older worship. The hostility of Cadmus toward the sacred serpent of Ares and the wrath of the god against the hero are legendary details which support some such theory as this. Cadmus seems to have been a late comer, for he is not mentioned in the Homeric poems, where Amphion and Zethus are named as the founders of Thebes. <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">318</font></a> It looks as if in Elis also a form of the Oriental Aphrodite was reconciled with an indigenous cult</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> of Ares. Here the genealogical myth is not the only evidence for the worship of Ares; an altar to Ares in the race-course at Olympia attests the cult. <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">319</font></a> By the legend Pelops married Hippodamia, granddaughter to Ares. Hesychius <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">320</font></a> identifies her with Aphrodite, and Pelops, like Cadmus, was conceived as coming from the east. <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">321</font></a> The parallel is practically exact. In the case of Pelops the legends which connect him with Lydia and Paphlagonia are more plausibly interpreted as reflexes of Hellenic settlement in Asia Minor than as the record of the planting of an Asiatic colony near Olympia. <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">322</font></a> Therefore the cult of Aphrodite-Hippodamia would seem to have come into Elis by means of religious influence flowing back from the stream of emigration to the cast. Thus the Elean parallel would be of service to Farnell's argument. The Attic myth of Theseus tends, however, to support the opposite theory. This saga certainly preserved flue memory of the predominance of Crete in the Aegean. <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">323</font></a> Thus Aphrodite-Ariadne probably belonged to the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of Attica. It may be stated as an hypothesis that Ares was also worshipped in very early times at Athens. The evidence is this: his connection with Aglaurus, who seems to have been a primitive goddess; <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">324</font></a> the invocation of Ares and Enyalius in the ephebes' oath, which associates him with Aglaurus, the Attic Charites, and Hegemone; <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">325</font></a> the well established cult of Ares in the fifth century on the lower slopes of the Areopagus. <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">326</font></a> The association with Hegemone is of special value, inasmuch as the epithet belongs to Aphrodite and to an Artemis similar to Astrateia.</p>

 <p>The only direct information so far given concerning the worship of Ares by the Amazons comes from Athens. <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">327</font></a> Therefore it is reasonable to lay stress on the legend of the Oriental Aphrodite in this state <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">328</font></a> Yet we have no explicit statement that she was related to Ares in his capacity of patron of the Amazons. The nearest approach to a solution of the problem is possibly to be found in the ancient association between Ares and Enyo <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">329</font></a> Enyo was apparently identified with the armed goddess of Cappadocia who was known as Mâ, who, in turn, was identified with Cybele as Mother of the Gods. <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">330</font></a> Aphrodite-Ariadne and the Armed Aphrodite are in a measure forms of the Mother. Hence by an equation Aphrodite under these two types becomes identical with Enyo, the companion of Ares.</p>
 <p>The evidence thus far gathered for a relation between Ares and the Amazons may be stated. (1) Aeschylus mentions their habitual worship of this god while they were besieging Athens; (2) Plutarch represents Theseus at this time sacrificing to Phobus, son of Ares; (3) Pausanias describes the temple of Ares at Troezen as a trophy of the victory of Theseus over the Amazons; (4) in the association between Ares and Aphrodite in several places, in similar association between Ares and Enyo, and in the identification both of this Aphrodite and of Enyo with the Mother whom the Amazons worshipped, there are obscure indications of his belonging to the rites of the Mother; (5) there are fairly good reasons for holding that Ares was an early, or pre-Hellenic god. According to this evidence it is presumable that the connection between Ares and the Amazons was indirect rather than direct. A striking</p>

 <p>fact should be added. Wherever there were memorials of the Amazons in Greece--at Athens, Troezen, Megara and Chaeronea in Boeotia, Chalcis in Euboea, <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">331</font></a> Thessaly <a name="fr_331"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">332</font></a>--there are some indications in each canton that the cult of Ares was there in early times.</p>
 <p>There are two other sets of records which belong to the discussion of the cult of Ares in its relation to the Amazons. Of these the first is a small group of ancient references to the Amazons as children of Ares. Euripides <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">333</font></a> terms them Ἀρείας κόρας, a phrase echoed in the Latin <i>Mavortia</i> applied to one of them. <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">334</font></a> The term is of no value toward establishing a theory of a cult relation with Ares, for it as colourless as are the familiar epic phrases, ὄζος Ἄρηος and θεράποντες Άρηος, applied to warriors. Elsewhere, however, the Amazons are conceived as actually daughters of the god. The stock genealogy assigned to the race made them the children of Ares and Harmonia <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">335</font></a> while Otrere is individually named as the child of these parents. <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">336</font></a> Harmonia's name is easily associated with that of Ares, since in Theban legends she appears as his daughter. It is therefore tempting to see in the mother of the race the goddess Aphrodite. But it is impossible to follow out the clue. The relationship is manifestly a stereotyped one,</p>

 <p>manufactured by logographers. Furthermore, the mother is not consistently called Harmonia. At times she appears as Armenia <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">337</font></a> from which it may be inferred that the name of the mother of the Amazons came from the study of geography, and that Harmonia's crept in as a corruption. Arctinus <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">338</font></a> called Penthesilea a Thracian and the daughter of Ares. Possibly the theory that the race in general were children of Ares may have originated thus, or in some other poem of the Cycle. If the Amazons had not been conspicuously warriors, and if it were not at first sight a figure of speech to term a band of women the children of the war-god, it would be easier to judge whether these statements are poetical or representations of the view of genealogists.</p>
 <p>The reference to Thrace is more valuable. Herodotus <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">339</font></a> shows that the cult of Ares was important here, for he says that the Thracians worshipped three gods, Ares, Dionysus, and Artemis. As it has been said, the sacrifice of dogs in the Spartan ritual of Enyalius finds its only parallels in the rites of Thracian Hecate. <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">340</font></a> Many modern authorities <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">341</font></a> believe that the cult of Ares was of Thracian origin. <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">342</font></a> The rites of Dionysus, to whom he was akin, <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">343</font></a> belong also to the orgiastic ceremonies of Phrygia. In general, as it has been noted, there is striking similarity between the cults of Phrygia and those of Thrace. This comes out strongly in the worship of the Mother. It is noteworthy that the custom of sacrificing dogs, a conspicuous and difficult feature in the rites of Ares and also</p>

 <p>of Hecate, belonged to the Carian worship of Ares. <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">344</font></a> It should be added that at Lagina in Caria the orgiastic worship of Hecate was established with the peculiar characteristic of the cult of Cybele at Pessinus and of Artemis at Ephesus. <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">345</font></a> Thus from all sides the theory finds support that the cult of Ares should be classed as Thracian-Phrygian and connected with that of the Mother. The inference is that the pre-Hellenic Ares of the Greek mainland was a god of the people who had a pre-historic culture allied to the "Minoan."</p>
 <p>Apollonius Rhodius <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">346</font></a> represents the Amazons engaged in a ritual as strange as the sacrifice of dogs which suggests Thrace and Caria. He relates that on "Ares island" in Pontus they sacrificed horses in the temple of Ares. An obscure record of this is apparently preserved by the Scholiast on a line in the <i>Lysistrata</i> of Aristophanes. <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">347</font></a> The scholium mentions no deity by name; it merely comments on the legend that Amazons sacrificed horses. Ares is not elsewhere than in the passage from Apollonius named as a god thus worshipped, and possibly here, even in the temple of Ares, the ritual is to be referred rather to the worship of Cybele under baetylic form than to that of Ares. The victim was a rare one among the Greeks, belonging to Apollo, Helios, the wind-gods, and especially to Poseidon. It may be that the words of Apollonius imply a connection between the cult of Ares and that of Poseidon Hippius. At Troezen the temple of Ares gave access to the Genethlium, probably a shrine of Poseidon; <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">348</font></a> at Athens there was the story of the murder of Halirrhothius, son of Poseidon; <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">349</font></a> at Olympia the altar of Ares was dedicated to</p>

 <p>Ares Hippius. <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">350</font></a> The cult of Poseidon Hippius at Athens seems to have been in some way connected with that of the pre-Ionic Semnae, or Eumenides, both at Colonus Hippius and on the Areopagus. <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">351</font></a> Possibly the Troezenian legend of the death of Hippolytus suggests jealousy between Ares, a divinity of the Amazons, and Poseidon, the reputed father of Theseus. The ritual of horse sacrifice among the Amazons may be the basis of the tradition that they were skilful horsewomen.</p>
 <p>The sacrifice of horses to Ares is recorded as a custom of the Scythians, <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">352</font></a> a people who apparently associated the horse with funerary oblations. <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">353</font></a></p>
 <p>The best example of this sacrifice in the rites of the war-god comes from Rome, <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">354</font></a> where on October fifteenth there was an annual race of bigae in the Campus Martius, after which the near horse of the winning pair was sacrificed to Mars, and his blood was allowed to drip on the hearth of the Regia. Probably the blood of this sacrifice was afterwards mixed with the ingredients of the sacred cakes. The rite evidently was in honour of Mars as a deity of fertility. He was undoubtedly worshipped by the primitive Romans in this capacity as well as in that of warrior. <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">355</font></a></p>
 <p>Apparently then the poetic legend of the Amazons' offering horses to Ares presents him in a very primitive aspect with the suggestion that he was a chthonic deity of fertility. As warrior and giver of increase he resembles Apollo Carneüs. A scholium <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">356</font></a> furnishes information which strengthens the supposition that he was in his primitive form a nature god. This tells of an obsolete custom in time of war, by which the</p>

 <p>signal for attack was given by priests of Ares called πυρφόροι, who hurled lighted torches between the two armies. This suggests the orgiastic cults of Thrace and Phrygia, in which the torch was a prominent feature. It belonged also to the ceremonies of fire in honour of Mars in primitive Rome. <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">357</font></a></p>
 <p>Even in ancient times there were conflicting theories concerning the provenience of the cult of Ares. Arnobius <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">358</font></a> says: "Quis Spartanum fuisse Martem (prodidit)? Non Epicharmus auctor vester? Quis is Thraciae finibus procreatum? Non Sophocles Atticus cunctis consentientibus theatris? Quis mensibus in Arcadia tribus et decem vinctum? Quis ei canes ab Caribus, quis ab Scythibus asinos immolari? Nonne principaliter cum ceteris Apollodorus?" The general tendency of the evidence is in the direction of the theory that Ares was an ancient god of the Thracians, of the pre-Hellenic peoples of Greece, and of the races who worshipped the Mother in Asia Minor and Crete.</p>
 <p>As a god whom the Amazons worshipped he does not appear to have been as important as the Mother. The records of his association with them are few and confused. The best evidence is doubtless that furnished by the extant accounts of the saga of Theseus and the Amazons, to which Ares belongs, although it is not possible to define his position. The saga is of special importance in being analogous to the Ephesian tales of Heracles and Dionysus.</p>
