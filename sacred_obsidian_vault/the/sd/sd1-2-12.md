 THE THEOGONY OF THE CREATIVE GODS.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>T</strong>O thoroughly comprehend the idea underlying
 every ancient cosmology necessitates the study, in a comparative
 analysis, of all the great religions of antiquity; as it is only
 by this method that the root idea will be made plain. Exact science
 -- could the latter soar so high, while tracing the operations
 of nature to their ultimate and original sources -- would call
 this idea the hierarchy of Forces. The original, transcendental
 and philosophical conception was one. But as systems began to
 reflect with every age more and more the idiosyncracies of nations;
 and as the latter, after separating, settled into distinct groups,
 each evolving along its own national or tribal groove, the main
 idea gradually became veiled with the overgrowth of human fancy.
 While in some countries the <strong>F</strong>ORCES, or rather
 the intelligent Powers of nature, received divine honours they
 were hardly entitled to, in others -- as now in Europe and the
 <em>civilized </em>lands -- the very thought of any such Force
 being endowed with intelligence seems absurd, and is proclaimed
 <em>unscientific. </em>Therefore one finds relief in such statements
 as are found in the <em>Introduction </em>to "Asgard and
 the Gods: Tales and Traditions of our Northern Ancestors,"
 by W. S. W. Anson. The author remarks, on p. 3: "Although
 in Central Asia, or on the banks of the Indus, in the land of
 the Pyramids, and in the Greek and Italian peninsulas, and even
 in the North, whither Kelts, Teutons and Slavs wandered, the religious
 conceptions of the people have taken different forms, <em>yet
 their common origin </em>is still perceptible. We point out this
 connection between the stories of the gods, and the deep thought
 contained in them, and their importance, in order that the reader
 may see that <em>it is not a magic world of erratic fancy </em>which
 opens out before him, but that . . . <em>Life and nature </em>formed
 the basis of the existence and action of these divinities."
 And though it is impossible for any Occultist or student of Eastern
 Esotericism to concur in the strange idea that "the religious
 con-</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 425 MYTH IS ORAL TRADITION.</h6>
 
 <p>
 ceptions of the most famous nations of antiquity are connected
 with the beginnings of civilization amongst the Germanic races,"
 he is yet glad to find such truths expressed as that: "These
 fairy tales are not senseless stories written for the amusement
 of the idle; they embody the profound religion of our forefathers
 . . . "
 </p><p>
 Precisely so. Not only their religion, but likewise their History.
 For a myth, in Greek [[<em>mythos</em>]], means oral tradition,
 passed from mouth to mouth from one generation to the other; and
 even in the modern etymology the term stands for a <em>fabulous
 </em>statement conveying some important truth; a tale of some
 extraordinary personage whose biography has become overgrown,
 owing to the veneration of successive generations, with rich popular
 fancy, but which is no <em>wholesale </em>fable. Like our ancestors,
 the primitive Aryans, we believe firmly in the personality and
 intelligence of more than one phenomenon-producing Force in nature.
 </p><p>
 As time rolled on, the archaic teaching grew dimmer; and those
 nations more or less lost sight of the highest and One principle
 of all things, and began to transfer the abstract attributes of
 the "causeless cause" to the caused effects -- become
 in their turn causative -- the creative Powers of the Universe:
 the great nations, out of the fear of profaning the IDEA, the
 smaller, because they either failed to grasp it or lacked the
 power of philosophic conception needed to preserve it in all its
 immaculate purity. But one and all, with the exception of the
 latest Aryans, now become Europeans and Christians, show this
 veneration in their Cosmogonies. As Thomas Taylor,* the most intuitional
 of all the translators of Greek Fragments, shows, no nation has
 ever conceived the One principle as the immediate creator of the
 visible Universe, for no sane man would credit a planner and architect
 with having built the edifice he admires with his own hands. On
 the testimony of Damascius ([[Peri<em> </em>archon]]) they referred
 to it as "the Unknown <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS." The
 Babylonians passed over this principle in silence: "To that
 god," says Porphyry, in [[<em>Peri apoches empsuchon</em>]],<em>
 </em>"who is above all things, neither external speech ought
 to be addressed, nor yet that which is inward. . . . ." Hesiod
 begins his theogony with: "Chaos of all things was the first
 produced,"** thus allowing the inference that its cause or
 producer must be passed over in reverential silence. Homer in
 his poems ascends no higher than <em>Night</em>,<em> </em>whom
 he represents Zeus as reverencing. According to all the ancient
 theologists, and to the doctrines of Pythagoras and Plato, Zeus,
 or the

 being considered in antiquity as meaning "Was <em>generated</em>"<em>
 </em>and not simply <em>was. </em>(<em>See </em>"<em>Taylor</em>'<em>s
 Introd. to the Parmenides of Plato</em>,"<em> </em>p. 260.

 <p>
 immediate artificer of the universe, <em>is not the highest god;
 </em>any more than Sir Christopher Wren in his physical, human
 aspect is the MIND in him which produced his great works of art.
 Homer, therefore, is not only silent with respect to the first
 principle, but likewise with respect to those two principles immediately
 posterior to the first, the <em>AEther </em>and<em> Chaos </em>of
 Orpheus and Hesiod, and the <em>bound </em>and infinity of Pythagoras
 and Plato.* . . . . Proclus says of this highest principle that
 it is. . . . "the Unity of Unities, and beyond the first
 adyte. . . . . more ineffable than all silence, and more occult
 than all Essence. . . . . concealed amidst the intelligible gods."
 (<em>Ibid.</em>)
 </p><p>
 To what was written by Thomas Taylor in 1797 -- namely, that the
 "Jews appear to have ascended no higher. . . . than the <em>immediate
 </em>artificer of the universe"; as "Moses introduces
 a darkness on the face of the deep, without even insinuating that
 there was any cause of its existence,"** one might add something
 more. Never have the Jews in their Bible (a purely esoteric, symbolical
 work) degraded so profoundly their metaphorical deity as have
 the Christians, by accepting Jehovah as their one living yet <em>personal
 </em>God<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 This first, or rather ONE, principle was called "the circle
 of Heaven," symbolized by the hierogram of a point within
 a circle or equilateral triangle, the point being the LOGOS. Thus,
 in the Rig Veda, wherein Brahma is not even named, Cosmogony is
 preluded with the <em>Hiranyagharha</em>,<em> </em>"the Golden
 Egg," and Prajapati (Brahma later on), from whom emanate
 all the hierarchies of "Creators." The Monad, or point,
 is the original and is the unit from which follows the entire
 numeral system. This Point is the First Cause, but THAT from which
 it emanates, or of which, rather, it is the expression, the Logos,
 is passed over in silence. In its turn, the universal symbol,
 the <em>point within the circle</em>,<em> </em>was not yet the
 Architect, but the cause of that Architect; and the latter stood
 to it in precisely the same relation as the point itself stood
 to the<em> circumference </em>of the Circle, which cannot be defined,
 according to Hermes Trismegistus. Porphyry shows that the Monad
 and the Duad of Pythagoras are identical with Plato's <em>infinite
 </em>and<em> finite </em>in "Philebus" -- or what Plato
 calls the [[<em>apeiron</em>]] and [[<em>peras</em>]]. It is the
 latter only (the mother) which is substantial, the former being
 the "<em>cause of all unity and measure of all things</em>"<em>
 </em>(<em>Vit. Pyth. p. </em>47); the Duad (Mulaprakriti, the
 <strong>V</strong>EIL) being thus shown to be the mother of the
 Logos and, at the same time, his <em>daughter</em> --<em> i.e.</em>,
 the object of his perception -- the produced

 producer and the secondary cause of it. With Pythagoras, the MONAD
 returns into silence and Darkness as soon as it has evolved the
 <em>triad</em>,<em> </em>from which emanate the remaining seven
 numbers of the 10 (ten) numbers which are at the base of the manifested
 universe.
 </p><p>
 In the Norse cosmogony it is again the same. "In the beginning
 was a great abyss (Chaos), neither day nor night existed; the
 abyss was Ginnungagap, the yawning gulf, without beginning, without
 end. <strong>A</strong>LL <strong>F</strong>ATHER, the Uncreated,
 the Unseen, dwelt in the depth of the 'Abyss' (<strong>S</strong>PACE)
 and <em>willed</em>,<em> </em>and what was willed came into being."
 (See<em> </em>"<em>Asgard and the Gods.</em>")<em> </em>As
 in the Hindu cosmogony, the evolution of the universe is divided
 into two acts: called in India the <em>Prakriti </em>and<em> Padma
 </em>Creations. Before the warm rays pouring from the "Home
 of Brightness" awake life in the Great Waters of Space, the
 Elements of the first creation come into view, and from them is
 formed the Giant Ymir (also Orgelmir) -- primordial matter differentiated
 from Chaos (literally <em>seething clay</em>)<em>. </em>Then comes
 the cow Audumla, the nourisher,* from whom is born Buri (the Producer)
 who, by Bestla, the daughter of the "Frost-Giants" (the
 sons of Ymir) had three sons, <em>Odin</em>,<em> Willi </em>and<em>
 We</em>,<em> </em>or "Spirit," "Will," and
 "Holiness." (<em>Compare the Genesis of the Primordial
 Races</em>,<em> in this work.</em>)<em> </em>This was when Darkness
 still reigned throughout Space, when the <em>Ases</em>,<em> </em>the
 creative Powers (Dhyan Chohans) were not yet evolved, and the
 Yggdrasil, the <em>tree </em>of the universe of Time and of Life,
 had not yet grown, and there was, as yet, no Walhalla, or Hall
 of Heroes. The Scandinavian legends of creation, of our earth
 and world, begin with <em>time </em>and human life. All that precedes
 it is for them "Darkness," wherein All-Father, the cause
 of all, dwells. As observed by the editor of "Asgard and
 the Gods," though these legends have in them the idea of
 that <strong>A</strong>LL-<strong>F</strong>ATHER, the original
 cause of all, "he is scarcely more than mentioned in the
 poems," not because, as he thinks, before the preaching of
 the gospel, the idea "could not rise to distinct conceptions
 of the Eternal," but on account of its great esoteric character.
 Therefore, all the creative gods, or <em>personal </em>Deities,
 begin at the secondary stage of Cosmic evolution. Zeus is born
 <em>in</em>, and<em> out </em>of<em> Kronos</em> --<em> </em>Time.
 So is Brahma the production and emanation of <em>Kala</em>,<em>
 </em>"eternity and time," Kala being one of the names
 of Vishnu. Hence we find Odin, the father <em>of the gods and
 of the Ases</em>,<em> </em>as Brahma is the father of <em>the
 gods and of the Asuras</em>,<em> </em>and hence also the androgyne
 character of all the chief creative gods, from the second <strong>M</strong>ONAD
 of the Greeks down to the Sephiroth Adam Kadmon, the Brahma or
 Prajapati-Vach of the Vedas, and the androgyne of Plato, which
 is but another version of the Indian symbol.

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 428 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The best metaphysical definition of primeval theogony in the spirit
 of the Vedantins may be found in the "Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita,"
 by Mr. T. Subba Row. (<em>See </em>"<em>Theosophist</em>"<em>
 for February</em>,<em> </em>1887.) Parabrahmam, the unknown and
 the incognisable, as the lecturer tells his audience:
 </p><blockquote>
 ". . . . . Is not Ego, it is not non-ego, nor is it consciousness
 . . . . . it is not even <i>Atma</i>" . . . . . "but
 though not itself an object of knowledge, it is yet capable of
 supporting and giving rise to every kind of object and every kind
 of existence which becomes an object of knowledge. It is the one
 essence from which starts into existence a centre of energy .
 . . . ." which he calls <i>Logos.</i> 
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 This Logos is the <em>Sabda Brahmam </em>of the Hindus, which
 he will not even call <em>Eswara </em>(the "lord" God),
 lest the term should create confusion in the people's minds. But
 it is the <em>Avalokiteswara </em>of the Hindus, the <em>Verbum
 </em>of the Christians in its real <em>esoteric </em>meaning,
 not in the theological disfigurement.
 </p><blockquote>
 "It is," he says, "the <i>Gnatha </i>or the Ego
 in the Kosmos, and every other Ego . . . . . . is but its reflection
 and manifestation. . . . . . It exists in a latent condition in
 the bosom of Parabrahmam at the time of <i>Pralaya. . </i>. ."
 (During Manvantara) "it has a consciousness and an individuality
 of its own . . . . ." (It is a centre of energy, but) . .
 . . . such centres of energy are almost innumerable in the bosom
 of Parabrahmam . . . . ." "It must not be supposed,
 that even the logos is <i>the</i> Creator, or that it is but a
 single centre of energy . . . . . . their number is almost infinite."
 "This Ego," he adds, "is the first that appears
 in Kosmos, and is the end of all evolution. It is the abstract
 Ego" . . . . . "this is the <i>first </i>manifestation
 (or aspect) of Parabrahmam." "When once it starts into
 conscious being . . . . . . from its objective standpoint, <i>Parabrahmam
 </i>appears to it as <i>Mulaprakriti.</i>"<i> </i>"Please
 bear this in mind," observes the lecturer, "for here
 is the root of the whole difficulty about <i>Purusha </i>and<i>
 Prakriti </i>felt by the various writers on Vedantic philosophy.
 This <i>Mulaprakriti </i>is material to it (the Logos), as any
 material object is material to us. This <i>Mulaprakriti </i>is
 no more <i>Parabrahmam </i>than the bundle of attributes of a
 pillar is the pillar itself; Parabrahmam is an unconditioned and
 absolute reality, and Mulaprakriti is a sort of veil thrown over
 it. Parabrahmam by itself cannot be seen as it is. It is seen
 by the <i>Logos </i>with a veil thrown over it, and that veil
 is the mighty expanse of Cosmic matter. . . ." "Parabrahmam,
 after having appeared on the one hand as the Ego, and on the other
 as Mulaprakriti, acts as the one energy through the <i>Logos</i>."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 And the lecturer explains what he means by this acting of something
 which is <em>nothing</em>,<em> </em>though it is the ALL, by a
 fine simile. He compares the Logos to the sun through which light
 and heat radiate, but whose energy, light and heat, exist in some
 unknown condition in Space and are diffused in Space only as <em>visible
 </em>light and heat, the sun being only the agent thereof. This
 is the first triadic hypostasis. The quaternary is made up by
 the <em>energizing light </em>shed by the Logos.
 </p><p>
 The Hebrew Kabalists give it in a shape which esoterically is
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 429 THE ONE IS KNOWN BY THE MANY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 identical with the Vedantic. <strong>A</strong>IN-<strong>S</strong>OPH,
 they taught, could not be comprehended, could not be located,
 nor named, though the causeless cause of all. Hence its name --
 <strong>A</strong>IN-<strong>S</strong>OPH -- is a term of negation,
 "the inscrutable, the incognizable, and the unnameable."
 They made of it, therefore, a boundless circle, a sphere, of which
 human intellect, with the utmost stretch, could only perceive
 the vault. In the words of one who has unriddled much in the Kabalistical
 system, in one of its meanings thoroughly, in its numerical and
 geometrical esotericism: -- "Close your eyes, and from your
 own consciousness of perception try and think outward to the extremest
 limits in every direction. You will find that equal lines or rays
 of perception extend out evenly in all directions, so that the
 utmost effort of perception will terminate in the <em>vault of
 a sphere. </em>The limitation of this sphere will, of necessity,
 be a great <em>Circle</em>,<em> </em>and the direct rays of thought
 in any and every direction must be <em>right line radii </em>of
 the circle. This, then, <em>must </em>be, humanly speaking, the
 extremest all-embracing conception of the Ain-Soph <em>manifest</em>,<em>
 </em>which formulates itself as a <em>geometrical figure</em>,<em>
 </em>viz., of a circle, with its elements of curved circumference
 and right line diameter divided into radii. Hence, a geometrical
 shape is the first recognisable means of connection between the
 Ain-Soph and the intelligence of man."*
 </p><p>
 This great circle (which Eastern Esotericism reduces to the point
 within the Boundless Circle) is the Avalokiteswara, the <em>Logos
 </em>or<em> Verbum </em>of which Mr. Subba Row speaks. But this
 circle or manifested God is as unknown to us, except through its
 <em>manifested </em>universe, as the ONE, though easier, or rather
 more possible to our highest conceptions. This Logos which sleeps
 in the bosom of Parabrahmam during Pralaya, as our "<em>Ego
 </em>is latent (in us) at the time <em>of sushupti</em>,<em> </em>sleep";
 which cannot cognize Parabrahmam otherwise than as <em>Mulaprakriti</em>
 --<em> </em>the latter being a cosmic veil which is "the
 mighty expanse of cosmic matter" -- is thus only an organ
 in cosmic creation, through which radiate the energy and wisdom
 of Parabrahmam, <em>unknown to the Logos</em>,<em> as it is to
 ourselves. </em>Moreover, as the Logos is as unknown to us as
 Parabrahmam is unknown in reality to the Logos, both Eastern Esotericism
 and the Kabala -- in order to bring the Logos within the range
 of our conceptions -- have resolved the abstract synthesis into
 concrete images; viz., into the reflections or multiplied aspects
 of that Logos or Avalokiteswara, Brahma, Ormazd, Osiris, Adam-Kadmon,
 call it by any of these names -- which aspects or Manvantaric
 emanations are the Dhyan Chohans, the Elohim, the Devas, the Amshaspends,
 &amp;c., &amp;c. Metaphysicians explain the root and germ of the
 latter, according to Mr. Subba Row, as the first manifestation
 of Parabrahmam, "the highest trinity that we

 <p>
 are capable of understanding," which is <em>Mulaprakriti
 </em>(the veil), the <em>Logos</em>,<em> </em>and the conscious
 energy "of the latter," or its power and light*; or
 -- "matter, force and the <em>Ego</em>,<em> </em>or the one
 root of self, of which every other kind of self is but a manifestation
 or a reflection." It is then only in this "light"
 (of consciousness) of mental and physical perception, that <em>practical
 </em>Occultism can throw this into visibility by geometrical figures;
 which, when closely studied, will yield not only a scientific
 explanation of the real, objective, existence** of the "Seven
 sons of the divine Sophia," which is this light of the Logos,
 but show by means of other yet undiscovered keys that, with regard
 to Humanity, these "Seven Sons" and their numberless
 emanations, centres of energy personified, are an absolute necessity.
 Make away with them, and the mystery of Being and Mankind <em>will
 never be unriddled</em>,<em> not even closely approached.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 It is through <em>this light </em>that everything is created.
 This ROOT of mental SELF is also the root of physical <em>Self</em>,
 for this light is the permutation, in our manifested world, of
 Mulaprakriti, called <em>Aditi </em>in the Vedas. In its third
 aspect it becomes <em>Vach</em>,*** the daughter and the mother
 of the Logos, as Isis is the daughter and the mother of Osiris,
 who is Horus; and<em> Mout</em>,<em> </em>the daughter, wife,
 and mother of Ammon, in the Egyptian Moon-glyph. In the Kabala,
 Sephira is the same as Shekinah, and is, in another synthesis,
 the wife, daughter, and mother of the "Heavenly man,"
 Adam Kadmon, and is even identical with him, just as Vach is identical
 with Brahma, and is called the female Logos. In the Rig-Veda,
 Vach is "mystic speech," by whom Occult Knowledge and
 Wisdom are communicated to man, and thus Vach is said to have
 "entered the Rishis." She is "generated by the
 gods;" she is the <em>divine </em>Vach -- the "Queen
 of gods"; and she is associated -- like Sephira with the
 Sephiroth -- with the Prajapati in their work of creation. Moreover,
 she is called "the mother of the Vedas," "since
 it is through her power (as mystic <em>speech</em>)<em> </em>that
 Brahma revealed them, and also owing to her power that he produced
 the universe" -- <em>i.e.</em>, through speech, and <em>words
 </em>(synthesized by the "WORD") and numbers.****
 </p><p>
 But Vach being also spoken of as the daughter of Daksha -- "the
 god who lives in all the Kalpas" -- her Mayavic character
 is thereby shown:

 </p><p>
 **<em> Objective</em> --<em> </em>in the world of Maya, of course;
 still as real as we are.
 </p><p>
 *** "In the course of cosmic manifestation, this <em>Daiviprakriti</em>,<em>
 </em>instead of being the mother of the Logos, should, strictly
 speaking, be called his daughter." ("<em>Notes on the
 Bhagavat-Gita</em>," <em>p</em>. 305, <em>Theosophist.</em>)

 invented the scheme which makes the incomprehensible assume a

 figures.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 431 THE FEMALE LOGOI.</h6>
 
 <p>
 during the <em>pralaya </em>she disappears, absorbed in the one,
 all-devouring Ray.
 </p><p>
 But there are two distinct aspects in universal Esotericism, Eastern
 and Western, in all those personations of the <em>female </em>Power
 in nature, or nature -- the<em> noumenal </em>and the <em>phenomenal.
 </em>One is its purely metaphysical aspect, as described by the
 learned lecturer in his "Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita;"
 the other terrestrial and physical, and at the same time <em>divine
 </em>from the stand-point of practical human conception and Occultism.
 They are all the symbols and personifications of <em>Chaos</em>,<em>
 </em>the "Great Deep" or the Primordial Waters of Space,
 the impenetrable VEIL between the INCOGNISABLE and the <strong>L</strong>OGOS
 of Creation. "Connecting himself through his mind with Vach,
 Brahma (the Logos) created the primordial waters." In the
 Kathaka Upanishad it is stated still more clearly: "Prajapati
 was this Universe. <em>Vach was a second to him. </em>He associated
 with her . . . she produced these creatures and again re-entered
 Prajapati."*
 </p><p>
 And here we may incidentally point out one of the many unjust
 slurs thrown by the pious and <em>good </em>missionaries in India
 on the religion of the land. This allegory -- in the "Satapatha
 Brahmana" -- namely, that Brahma, as the father of men, performed
 the work of procreation by incestuous intercourse with his own
 daughter Vach, also called Sandhya (twilight), and <em>Satarupa
 </em>(the hundred formed), is incessantly thrown into the teeth
 of the Brahmins, as condemning their "detestable, <em>false
 </em>religion." Besides the fact, conveniently forgotten
 by the Europeans, that the Patriarch Lot is shown guilty of the
 same crime under the <em>human form</em>,<em> </em>whereas Brahma,
 or rather Prajapati, accomplished the incest under the form of
 a buck with his daughter, who had that of a hind (<em>rohit</em>),<em>
 </em>the esoteric reading of Genesis (<em>ch. iii.</em>)<em> </em>shows
 the same. Moreover, there is certainly a <em>cosmic</em>,<em>
 </em>not a physiological meaning attached to the Indian allegory,
 since Vach is a permutation of Aditi and Mulaprakriti (Chaos),
 and Brahma a permutation of Narayana, the Spirit of God entering
 into, and fructifying nature; therefore, there is nothing <em>phallic
 </em>in the conception at all.
 </p><p>
 As already stated, Aditi-Vach is the female <em>Logos</em>,<em>
 </em>or the "word," <em>Verbum; </em>and Sephira in
 the Kabala is the same. These feminine Logoi are all correlations,
 in their <em>noumenal </em>aspect, of Light, and Sound, and Ether,
 showing how well-informed were the ancients both in
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * This connects Vach and Sephira with the goddess Kwan-Yin, the
 "merciful mother," the <em>divine </em>VOICE<em> of
 the soul </em>even in Exoteric Buddhism; and with the female aspect
 of <em>Kwan-Shai-yin</em>,<em> </em>the Logos, the <em>verbum
 </em>of Creation, and at the same time with the voice that speaks
 audibly to the Initiate, according to Esoteric Buddhism. Bath
 Kol, the <em>filia Vocis</em>,<em> </em>the daughter of the divine
 voice of the Hebrews, responding from the mercy seat within the
 veil of the temple is -- a result.</p><hr>

 <p>
 physical science (as now known to the moderns), and as to the
 birth of that science in the Spiritual and Astral spheres.
 </p><blockquote>
 "Our old writers said that <i>Vach </i>is of four kinds .
 . . . <i>para</i>,<i> pasyanti</i>,<i> madhyama</i>,<i> vaikhari
 </i>(a statement found in the Rig-Veda and the Upanishads) . .
 . . Vaikhari Vach is what we utter." It is sound, <i>speech</i>,<i>
 </i>that again which becomes comprehensive and objective to one
 of our physical senses and may be brought under the laws of perception.
 Hence: "Every kind of <i>Vaikhari-Vach </i>exists in its<i>
 Madhyama </i>. . . . <i>Pasyanti </i>and ultimately in its <i>Para
 </i>form. . . . . The reason why this <i>Pranava* </i>is called
 Vach is this, that these four principles of the great Kosmos correspond
 to these four forms of Vach. . . . . The whole Kosmos in its objective
 form is <i>Vaikhari </i>Vach; the light of the <i>Logos </i>is
 the <i>madhyama </i>form; and the <i>Logos </i>itself the <i>pasyanti
 </i>form; while Parabrahmam is the <i>para </i>(beyond the <i>noumenon
 </i>of all <i>Noumena</i>)<i> </i>aspect of that Vach." (<i>Notes
 on the Bhagavad-Gita</i>)<i>.</i> 
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Thus Vach, Shekinah, or the "music of the spheres" of
 Pythagoras, are one, if we take for our example instances in the
 three most (apparently) dissimilar religious philosophies in the
 world -- the Hindu, the Greek and the Chaldean Hebrew. These personations
 and allegories may be viewed under <em>four </em>(chief) and three
 (lesser) aspects or <em>seven </em>in all, as in Esotericism.
 The <em>para </em>form is the ever subjective and latent Light
 and Sound, which exist eternally in the bosom of the INCOGNISABLE;
 when transferred into the ideation of the Logos, or its latent
 <em>light</em>,<em> </em>it is called <em>pasyanti</em>,<em> </em>and
 when it becomes that light <em>expressed</em>,<em> </em>it is
 <em>madhyama.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Now the Kabala gives the definition thus: "There are three
 kinds of light, and that (fourth) which interpenetrates the others;
 (1) the clear and the penetrating, the <em>objective light</em>,<em>
 </em>(2)<em> </em>the<em> reflected </em>light, and (3) the<em>
 abstract </em>light. The ten Sephiroth, the <em>three </em>and
 the Seven, are called in the Kabala the 10 words, <b>D-BRIM </b>(Dabarim),
 the numbers and the Emanations of the heavenly light, which is
 both Adam Kadmon and Sephira, or (Brahma) Prajapati-Vach. Light,
 Sound, Number, are the three factors of creation in the Kabala.
 Parabrahmam cannot be known except through the luminous Point
 (the <strong>L</strong>OGOS), which knows not <em>Parabrahmam
 </em>but only <em>Mulaprakriti. </em>Similarly Adam Kadmon knew
 only Shekinah, though he was the <em>vehicle </em>of Ain-Soph.
 And, as Adam Kadmon, he is in the esoteric interpretation the
 total of the number ten, the Sephiroth (himself a trinity, or
 the three attributes of the

 <em>incognisable </em><strong>D</strong>EITY in One).* "When
 the Heavenly man (or <strong>L</strong>OGOS) first assumed the
 form of the Crown** (Kether) and identified himself with Sephira,
 he caused seven splendid lights to emanate from it (the Crown),"
 which made in their totality ten; so the Brahma-Prajapati, once
 he became separated from, yet identical with Vach, caused the
 seven Rishis, the seven Manus or Prajapatis to issue from that
 crown. In Exotericism one will always find 10 and 7, of either
 Sephiroth or Prajapati; in <em>Esoteric </em>rendering always
 3 and 7, which yield also 10. Only when divided in the manifested
 sphere into 3 and 7, they form <img src="sd1-5f.jpg" align="MIDDLE">,
 the androgyne, and <img src="sd1-5d.jpg" align="MIDDLE">, or the

 </p><p>
 This will help the student to understand why Pythagoras esteemed
 the Deity (the Logos) to be the <em>centre of unity </em>and "Source
 of Harmony." We say this Deity was the <em>Logos</em>,<em>
 </em>not the MONAD that dwelleth in Solitude and Silence, because
 Pythagoras taught that UNITY being indivisible is <em>no number.
 </em>And this is also why it was required of the candidate, who
 applied for admittance into his school, that he should have already
 studied as a preliminary step, the Sciences of Arithmetic, Astronomy,
 Geometry and <em>Music</em>,<em> </em>held as the four divisions
 of Mathematics.*** Again, this explains why the Pythagoreans asserted
 that the doctrine of Numbers -- the chief of all in Esotericism
 -- had been revealed to man by the celestial deities; that the
 world had been called forth out of Chaos by Sound or Harmony,
 and constructed according to the principles of musical proportion;
 that the seven planets which rule the destiny of mortals have
 a harmonious motion "and intervals corresponding to musical
 diastemes, rendering various sounds, so perfectly consonant, that
 they produce the sweetest melody, which is inaudible to us, only
 by reason of the greatness of the sound, which our ears are incapable
 of receiving." (<em>Censorinus.</em>)
 </p><p>
 In the Pythagorean Theogony the hierarchies of the heavenly Host
 and Gods were numbered and expressed numerically. Pythagoras had
 studied Esoteric Science in India; therefore we find his pupils
 saying "The monad (the manifested one) is the principle of
 all things. From the Monad and the indeterminate duad (Chaos),
 numbers; from

 * It is this <em>trinity </em>that is meant by the "three

 issued Mulaprakriti, Purusha (the Logos), and Prakriti: the four
 forms (with itself, the synthesis) of Vach. And in the Kabala
 -- Ain-Soph, Shekinah, Adam Kadmon and Sephirah, the four -- or
 the three emanations being distinct -- yet ONE.

 Water, Air, Earth; of all which transmuted (correlated), and totally
 changed, the world consists." -- (Diogenes Laertius <em>in
 Vit. Pythag.</em>)
 </p><p>
 And this may also, if it does not unriddle the mystery altogether,
 at any rate lift a corner of the veil off those wondrous allegories
 that have been thrown upon Vach, the most mysterious of all the
 Brahmanical goddesses, she who is termed "the <em>melodious
 </em>cow who milked forth sustenance and water" (the Earth
 with all her mystic powers); and again she "who yields us
 nourishment and sustenance" (physical Earth). <em>Isis </em>is
 also mystic Nature and also Earth; and her cow's horns identify
 her with Vach. The latter, after having been recognised in her
 highest form as <em>para</em>,<em> </em>becomes at the lower or
 material end of creation -- <em>Vaikhari. </em>Hence she is mystic,
 though physical, Nature, with all her magic ways and properties.
 </p><p>
 Again, as goddess of Speech and of Sound, and a permutation of
 Aditi -- she is <em>Chaos</em>,<em> </em>in one sense. At any
 rate, she is the "Mother of the gods," and it is from
 Brahma (Iswara, or the Logos) and Vach, as from Adam Kadmon and
 Sephira, that the real <em>manifested </em>theogony has to start.
 Beyond, all is darkness and abstract speculation. With the Dhyan
 Chohans, or the gods, the Seers, the Prophets and the adepts in
 general are on firm ground. Whether as Aditi, or the <em>divine</em>
 Sophia of the Greek Gnostics, she is the mother of the seven sons:
 the "Angels of the Face," of the "Deep," or
 the "Great Green One" of the "Book of the Dead."
 Says the Book of Dzyan (Knowledge through meditation) --
 </p><p>
 "<em>The great mother lay with <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="MIDDLE">,
 and the</em> |, <em>and the</em> <img src="sd1-114a.jpg" align="MIDDLE">,

 </p><p>
 At the beginning of every cycle of 4,320,000, the <em>Seven </em>(or,
 as some nations had it, eight) great gods, descended to establish
 the new order of things and give the impetus to the new cycle.
 That <em>eighth </em>god was the unifying <em>Circle </em>or <strong>L</strong>OGOS,
 separated and made distinct from its host, in exoteric dogma,
 just as the three divine hypostases of the ancient Greeks are
 now considered in the Churches as three distinct <em>personae.

 Commentary.* Thus we are taught that the great Pyramids were built
 under their direct supervision, "when <em>Dhruva </em>(the
 then Pole-star) was at his lowest culmination, and the Krittika
 (Pleiades) looked over his head (were on the same meridian but
 above) to watch the work of the giants." Thus, as the first
 Pyramids were built at the beginning of a Sidereal year, under
 Dhruva (Alpha Polaris), it must have been over 31,000 years (31,105)
 ago. Bunsen was right in admitting for Egypt an antiquity of over
 21,000 years, but this concession hardly exhausts truth and fact
 in this question. "The stories told by Egyptian priests and
 others of time-keeping in Egypt, are now beginning to look less
 like lies in the sight of all who have escaped from biblical bondage,"
 writes the author of "<em>The Natural Genesis.</em>"<em>
 </em>"Inscriptions have lately been found at Sakkarah, making
 mention of two Sothiac cycles . . . registered at that time, now
 some 6,000 years ago. Thus when Herodotus was in Egypt, the Egyptians
 had -- as now known -- observed at least five different Sothiac
 cycles of 1,461 years. The priests informed the Greek inquirer
 that time had been reckoned by them for so long that the sun had
 twice risen where it then set, and twice set where it then arose.
 This . . . can only be realized as a fact in nature by means of
 two cycles of Precession, or a period of 51,736 years," (vol.
 ii, p. 318. But see in our Book II., "<strong>C</strong>HRONOLOGY
 OF THE <strong>B</strong>RAHMINS.")
 </p><p>
 Mor Isaac (<em>See</em> Kircher's<em> OEdipus</em>,<em> vol. ii.</em>,<em>
 p. </em>425) shows the ancient Syrians defining their world of
 the "Rulers" and "active gods" in the same
 way as the Chaldeans. The lowest world was the <strong>S</strong>UBLUNARY
 -- our own -- watched by the "Angels" of the first or
 lower order; the one that came next in rank, was Mercury, ruled
 by the "<strong>A</strong>RCHANGELS"; then came Venus,
 whose gods were the <strong>P</strong>RINCIPALITIES; the fourth
 was that of the <strong>S</strong>UN, the domain and region of
 the highest and mightiest gods of our system, the solar gods of
 all nations; the fifth was Mars, ruled by the "<strong>V</strong>IRTUES";
 the sixth -- that of <em>Bel </em>or Jupiter -- was governed by
 the <strong>D</strong>OMINIONS; the seventh -- the world of Saturn
 -- by the <strong>T</strong>HRONES. These are the worlds of form.
 Above come the four higher ones, making seven again, since the
 three <em>highest </em>are "unmentionable and unpronounceable."
 The eighth, composed of 1,122 stars, is the domain of the <em>Cherubs;
 </em>the ninth, belonging to the <em>walking </em>and numberless
 stars on account of their distance, has the seraphs; as to the
 tenth -- Kircher, quoting Mor Isaac, says that it is composed
 "of invisible stars that could be taken, they said, for clouds
 -- so massed are they in the zone that we call <em>Via Straminis</em>,<em>

 * Appearing at the beginning of Cycles, as also of every sidereal
 year (of 25,868 years) therefore the Kabeiri or <em>Kabarim </em>received
 their name in Chaldea, as it means the<em> measures of Heaven

 <p>
 Milky Way"; and he hastens to explain that "these are
 the stars of Lucifer, engulfed with him in his terrible shipwreck."
 That which comes after and beyond the tenth world (our Quaternary,
 or the <em>Arupa </em>world), the Syrians could not tell. "All
 they knew was that it is there that begins the vast and incomprehensible
 ocean of the infinite, the abode of the true divinity without
 boundary or end."
 </p><p>
 Champollion shows the same belief among the Egyptians. Hermes
 having spoken of the Father-Mother and Son, whose spirit (collectively
 the DIVINE FIAT) shapes the Universe, says: -- "<em>Seven
 Agents </em>(mediums) were also formed, to contain the material
 (or manifested) worlds, within their respective <em>circles </em>and
 the action of these agents was named DESTINY." He further
 enumerates seven and ten and twelve orders, which would take too
 long to detail here.
 </p><p>
 As the "<em>Rig Vidhana</em>"<em> </em>together with
 the "<em>Brahmanda Purana</em>"<em> </em>and all such
 works, whether describing the magic efficacy of the Rig-Vedic
 <em>Mantras </em>or the future Kalpas, are declared by Dr. Weber
 and others to be<em> modern compilations </em>"belonging
 probably only to the time of the Puranas," it is useless
 to refer the reader to their mystic explanations; and one may
 as well quote simply from the archaic books utterly unknown to
 the Orientalists. These works explain that which so puzzles the
 scholars, namely that the <em>Saptarshi</em>,<em> </em>the "mind-born
 sons" of Brahma, are referred to in the <em>Satapatha Brahmana
 </em>under one set of names; in the <em>Mahabharata </em>under
 another set; and that the Vayu Purana makes even <em>nine</em>
 instead of <em>seven </em>Rishis, by adding the names of Bhrigu
 and Daksha to the list. But the same occurs in every exoteric
 Scripture. The secret doctrine gives a long genealogy of Rishis,
 but separates them into many classes. Like the Gods of the Egyptians,
 who were divided into seven, and even twelve, classes, so are
 the Indian Rishis in their Hierarchies. The first three groups
 are the Divine, the Cosmical and the Sub-lunary. Then come the
 Solar Gods of <em>our </em>system, the Planetary, the Sub-Mundane,
 and the purely human -- the heroes and the<em> Manoushi.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 At present, however, we are only concerned with the <em>pre</em>-cosmic,
 divine gods, the Prajapati or the "Seven Builders."
 This group is found unmistakably in every Cosmogony. Owing to
 the loss of Egyptian archaic documents -- since, according to
 M. Maspero, "the materials and historical data on hand to
 study the history of the religious evolution in Egypt are neither
 complete nor very often intelligible" -- in order to have
 the statements brought forward from the Secret Doctrine corroborated
 partially and indirectly, the ancient hymns and inscriptions on
 the tombs must be appealed to. One such, at any rate, shows that
 Osiris was, like Brahma-Prajapati, Adam Kadmon, Ormazd, and so
 many other Logoi, the chief and synthesis of the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 437 COSMIC GODS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 group of "Creators" or Builders. Before Osiris became
 the "One" and the <em>highest </em>god of Egypt he was
 worshipped at Abydos as the head or leader of the Heavenly Host
 of the Builders belonging to the higher of the three orders. The
 hymn engraved on the votive stela of a tomb from Abydos (3rd register)
 addresses Osiris thus: "Salutations to thee, Osiris, elder
 son of <em>Sib</em>;<em> </em>thou the greatest over the six gods
 issued from the goddess <em>Noo </em>(primordial Water), thou
 the great favourite of thy father <em>Ra</em>; father of fathers,
 King of Duration, master in the eternity . . . who, as soon as
 these issued from thy mother's bosom, gathered all the crowns
 and attached the <em>Uraeus </em>(serpent or naja)* on thy head;
 multiform god, <em>whose name is unknown </em>and who has many
 names in towns and provinces. . ." Coming out from the primordial
 water crowned with the <em>uraeus</em>,<em> </em>which is the
 serpent emblem of Cosmic fire, and himself the <em>seventh </em>over
 the six primary gods issued from Father-Mother, <em>Nou</em> and
 <em>Nout </em>(the sky), who can Osiris be, but the chief Prajapati,
 the chief Sephiroth, the chief Amshaspend-Ormazd! That this latter
 solar and cosmic god stood, in the beginning of religious evolution,
 in the same position as the archangel "whose name was secret,"
 is certain. This Archangel was the representative on earth of
 the <em>Hidden </em>Jewish God, Michael, in short: it is his "Face"
 that is said to have gone before the Jews like a "Pillar
 of Fire." Burnouf says, "The seven Amshaspends, who
 are most assuredly our archangels, designate also the personifications
 of the divine Virtues." (<em>Comment on the Yacna</em>,<em>
 p. </em>174.) And these archangels, therefore, are as "certainly"
 the <em>Saptarishi </em>of the Hindus, though it is next to impossible
 to class each with its pagan prototype and parallel, since, as
 in the case of Osiris, they have all so "many names in towns
 and provinces." Some of the most important, however, will
 be shown in their order.
 </p><p>
 One thing is thus undeniably proven. The more one studies their
 Hierarchies and finds out their identity, the more proofs one
 acquires that there is not one of the past and present <em>personal
 </em>gods, known to us from the earliest days of History, that
 does not belong to the third stage of Cosmic manifestation. In
 every religion we find the concealed deity forming the ground
 work; then the ray therefrom, that falls into primordial Cosmic
 matter (first manifestation); then the androgyne result, the dual
 Male and Female abstract Force, personified<em> </em>(<em>second
 </em>stage)<em> </em>; this separates itself finally, in the <em>third</em>,<em>
 </em>into seven Forces, called the creative Powers by all the
 ancient Religions, and the

 cyclic and cosmic character.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 438 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "Virtues of God" by the Christians. The later explanation
 and metaphysical abstract qualifications have never prevented
 the Roman and Greek Churches from worshipping these "Virtues"
 under the personifications and distinct names of the seven Archangels.
 In the Book of <em>Druschim </em>(<em>p. </em>59,<em> </em>1<em>st
 Treatise</em>)<em> </em>in the Talmud, a distinction between these
 groups is given which is the correct Kabalistical explanation.
 It says:
 </p><p>
 "There are three groups (or orders) of <em>Sephiroth. </em>1st.
 The Sephiroth called "the divine attributes" (abstract).
 2nd. The physical or <em>sidereal </em>Sephiroth (personal) --
 one group of <em>seven</em>,<em> </em>the other of <em>ten. </em>3rd.
 The metaphysical Sephiroth, or <em>periphrasis of Jehovah</em>,<em>
 </em>who are the first three Sephiroth (Kether, Chochma and Binah),
 the rest of the seven being the (personal) seven spirits of the
 Presence" (also of the planets).
 </p><p>
 The same division has to be applied to the primary, secondary
 and tertiary evolution of gods in every theogony, if one wishes
 to translate the meaning esoterically. We must not confuse the
 purely metaphysical personifications of the <em>abstract </em>attributes
 of Deity, with their reflection -- the sidereal gods. This reflection,
 however, is in reality the objective expression of the abstraction:
 <em>living</em> Entities and the models formed on that divine
 prototype. Moreover, the three metaphysical Sephiroth or "<em>the
 periphrasis of Jehovah</em>"<em> </em>are<em> not </em>Jehovah;
 it is the latter himself with the additional titles of Adonai,
 Elohim, Sabbaoth, and the numerous names lavished on him, who
 is the periphrasis of the Shaddai, <img src="sd1-384a.gif" align="MIDDLE">,
 the Omnipotent. The name is a circumlocution, indeed, a too abundant
 figure of Jewish rhetoric, and has always been denounced by the
 Occultists. To the Jewish Kabalists, and even the Christian Alchemists
 and Rosicrucians, Jehovah was a convenient <em>screen</em>,<em>
 </em>unified by the folding of its many flaps, and adopted as
 a substitute: one name of an individual Sephiroth being as good
 as another name, for those who had the secret. The Tetragrammaton,
 the Ineffable, the sidereal "<em>Sum Total</em>,"<em>
 </em>was invented for no other purpose than to mislead the profane
 and to symbolize life and generation.* The real secret and <em>unpronounceable</em>
 name --<em> </em>"the word that is no word" -- has to
 be sought in the seven names of the first seven emanations, or
 the "Sons of the Fire,"
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Says the translator of Avicebron's "<em>Qabbalah</em>"<em>
 </em>(Mr. Isaac Myer, <b>LL.B</b>., of Philadelphia) of this "Sum
 Total": "The letter of Kether is <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 (Yod), of Binah <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="MIDDLE">(Heh), together
 YaH, the feminine Name; the third letter, that of Hokhmah, is

 efficaciousness. The last <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="MIDDLE">(Heh)
 of this Ineffable Name <em>being always applied to the Six Lower
 and the last</em>,<em> together the Seven </em>remaining Sephiroth."
 . . . Thus the Tetragrammaton is holy only in its abstract synthesis.
 As a quaternary containing the lower Seven Sephiroth, <em>it is
 phallic.</em> </p><hr>

 in the secret Scriptures of all the great nations, and even in
 the <em>Zohar</em>,<em> </em>the Kabalistic lore of that smallest
 of all, the Jewish. This word, composed of seven letters in each
 tongue, is found embodied in the architectural remains of every
 grand building in the world; from the Cyclopean remains on Easter
 Island (part of a continent buried under the seas nearer four
 million years ago* than 20,000) down to the earliest Egyptian
 pyramids.
 </p><p>
 We shall have to enter more fully upon this subject, and bring
 practical illustrations to prove the statements made in the text.
 </p><p>
 For the present it is sufficient to show, by a few instances,
 the truth of what was asserted at the beginning of this Monograph,
 namely, that no Cosmogony, the world over, with the sole exception
 of the Christian, has ever attributed to the One Highest cause,
 the UNIVERSAL Deific Principle, the immediate creation of our
 Earth, man, or anything connected with these. This statement holds
 as good for the Hebrew or Chaldean Kabala as it does for <em>Genesis</em>,<em>
 </em>had the latter been ever thoroughly understood, and -- what
 is still more important -- correctly translated.** Everywhere
 there is either a LOGOS -- a<em> </em>"<em>Light </em>shining

 <p>
 * The statement will, of course, be found preposterous and absurd,
 and simply laughed at. But if one believes in the final submersion
 of Atlantis 850,000 years ago, as taught in "<em>Esoteric
 Buddhism</em>"<em> </em>(the gradual first sinking having
 begun during the Eocene age), one has to accept the statement
 for the so-called Lemuria, the continent of the Third Root Race,
 first nearly destroyed by combustion, and then submerged. This
 is what the Commentary says: "The first earth having been
 purified by the forty-nine fires, her people, born of Fire and
 Water, could not die . . . etc.; the Second Earth (with its race)
 disappeared as vapour vanishes in the air . . . the Third Earth
 had everything consumed on it after the <em>separation</em>,<em>
 </em>and went down into the lower Deep (the Ocean). This was <em>twice
 e</em>ighty-two cyclic years ago." Now a <em>cyclic </em>year
 is what we call a<em> sidereal </em>year, and is founded on the
 precession of the equinoxes, or 25,868 years each, and this is
 equal, therefore, in all to 4,242,352 years. More details will
 be found in the text of Book II. Meanwhile, this doctrine is embodied
 in the "Kings of Edom."
 </p><p>
 ** The same reserve is found in the Talmud and in every national
 system of religion whether monotheistic or exoterically polytheistical.
 From the superb religious poem by the Kabalist Rabbi Solomon Ben
 Gabirol in "the Kether Malchuth," we select a few definitions
 given in the prayers of Kippur. . . . "Thou art one, the
 beginning of all numbers, and the foundation of all edifices;
 Thou art One, and in the secret of Thy unity the wisest of men
 are lost, because they know it not. Thou art one, and Thy Unity
 is never diminished, never extended, and cannot be changed. Thou
 art one, but <em>not as an element of numeration; for Thy Unity
 admits not of multiplication</em>,<em> change or form. </em>Thou
 art existent; but the understanding and vision of mortals cannot
 attain to thy existence, nor determine for thee the Where, the
 How, and the Why. Thou art Existent, but in thyself alone, there
 being none other that can exist with thee. Thou art Existent,
 before all time and without Place. Thou art Existent, and thy
 existence is so profound and secret that none can penetrate and
 discover thy secrecy. Thou art Living, but within no time that
 can be fixed or known; Thou art Living, but not by a spirit or
 a soul, for <em>Thou art thyself</em>,<em> </em>THE SOUL OF ALL
 SOULS," etc., etc. There is [[Footnote continued on next

 in <strong>D</strong>ARKNESS," truly -- or the Architect
 of the Worlds is <em>esoterically</em> a<em> </em>plural number.
 The Latin Church, paradoxical as ever, while applying the epithet
 of Creator to Jehovah alone, adopts a whole <em>Kyriel </em>of
 names for the <em>working </em>FORCES<em> of the latter</em>,<em>
 </em>those names betraying the secret. For if the said Forces
 had nought to do with "Creation" so-called, why call
 them <em>Elohim </em>(Alhim) in plural; "divine workmen"
 and <em>Energies </em>([['<em>Energeia</em>]]),<em> </em>incandescent
 celestial stones (lapides igniti coelorum), and especially, "<em>supporters
 </em>of the World" ([[<em>Kosmokratores</em>]]), governors
 or RULERS of <em>the World </em>(<em>rectores mundi</em>),<em>
 </em>the "Wheels" of the World (<em>Rotae</em>), Ophanim,
 Flames and <strong>P</strong>OWERS, "Sons of God" (<em>B</em>'<em>ne
 Alhim</em>),<em> </em>"Vigilant COUNSELLORS," etc.,
 etc.
 </p><p>
 It was often premised (and as unjustly as usual) that China, nearly
 as old a country as India, had no cosmogony. "It was unknown
 to Confucius, and the Buddhists extended their Cosmogony without
 introducing a personal God,"* it is complained. The <em>Yi-King</em>,<em>
 </em>"the very essence of ancient thought and the combined
 work of the most venerated sages, fails to show a distinct cosmogony."
 Nevertheless, there is one, and a very distinct one. Only as Confucius
 did not admit of a future life** and the Chinese Buddhists reject
 the idea of <em>One</em> Creator, accepting one cause and its
 numberless effects, they are misunderstood by the believers in
 a <em>personal </em>God. The "great Extreme" as the
 commencement "of changes" (transmigrations) is the shortest
 and perhaps the most suggestive of all Cosmogonies, for those
 who, like the Confucianists, love virtue for its own sake, and
 try to do good unselfishly without perpetually looking to reward
 and profit. The "great Extreme" of Confucius produces
 "two figures." These "two" produce in their
 turn "the four images"; these again "the eight
 symbols." It is complained that though the Confucianists
 see in them "Heaven, Earth and man in miniature," .
 . . we can see in them anything we like. No doubt, and so it is
 with regard to many symbols, especially in those of the latest
 religions. But they who know something of Occult numerals, see
 in these "figures" the symbol, however rude, of a harmonious
 progressive Evolution of Kosmos and its beings, both the Heavenly
 and the Terrestrial. And any one who has studied the numerical
 evolution in the primeval cosmogony of Pythagoras (a contemporary
 of Confucius) can never fail to find in his <em>Triad</em>,<em>
 Tetractis </em>and

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 441 THE SAME IDEA IN CONFUCIANISM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>Decade </em>emerging from the ONE and solitary Monad, the
 same idea. Confucius is laughed at by his Christian biographer
 for "talking of divination" before and after this passage,
 and is represented as saying: "The eight symbols determine
 good and ill fortune, and these lead to great deeds. There are
 no imitable images greater than heaven and earth. There are no
 changes greater than the four seasons (meaning North, South, East
 and West, <em>et seq.</em>)<em>. </em>There are no suspended images
 brighter than the sun and moon. In preparing <em>things for use</em>,<em>
 there is none greater than the sage. </em>In determining good
 and ill-luck there is nothing greater than <em>the divining straws
 and the tortoise.</em>"*
 </p><p>
 Therefore, the "divining straws" and the "tortoise,"
 the "symbolic sets of lines," and the great sage who
 looks at them as they become one and two, and two become four,
 and four become eight, and the other sets "three and six,"
 are laughed to scorn, only because his wise symbols are misunderstood.
 </p><p>
 So the author and his colleagues will scoff no doubt at the <em>Stanzas
 </em>given in our text, for they represent <em>precisely the same
 idea. </em>The old archaic map of Cosmogony is full of <em>lines
 </em>in the Confucian style, of concentric circles and dots. Yet
 all these represent the most abstract and philosophical conceptions
 of the Cosmogony of our Universe. At all events it may answer,
 perhaps, better to the requirements and the scientific purposes
 of our age, than the cosmogonical essays of St. Augustine and
 the "Venerable Bede," though these were published over
 a millennium later than the Confucian.
 </p><p>
 Confucius, one of the greatest sages of the ancient world, believed
 in ancient magic, and practised it himself "if we take for
 granted the statements of <em>Kin-yu</em>" . . . . and "he
 praised it to the skies in <em>Yi-kin</em>,"<em> </em>we
 are told by his reverend critic. Nevertheless, even in his age
 -- <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>600 B.C., Confucius and his school
 taught the sphericity of the Earth and even the heliocentric system;
 while, at about thrice 600 years after the Chinese philosopher,
 the Popes of Rome threatened and even burnt "heretics"
 for asserting the same. He is laughed at for speaking of the "Sacred
 Tortoise." No unprejudiced person can see any great difference
 between a <em>tortoise </em>and a <em>lamb </em>as candidates
 for sacredness, as both are symbols and no more. The Ox, the Eagle,**
 the Lion, and occasionally

 * He may be laughed at by the Protestants; but the Roman Catholics
 have no right to mock him, without becoming guilty of blasphemy
 and sacrilege. For it is over 200 years since Confucius was canonized
 as a Saint in China by the Roman Catholics, who have thereby obtained
 many converts among the ignorant Confucianists.

 ** The animals regarded as <em>sacred </em>in the Bible are not
 few: the goat for one, the <em>Azaz-el</em>,<em> </em>or God of
 Victory. As Aben Ezra says: "If thou art capable of comprehending
 the mystery of Azazel, thou wilt learn the mystery of His (God's)
 name, for it has similar associates in Scriptures. I will tell
 thee by allusion one portion of the mystery; [[Footnote continued

 the Dove, are "the sacred animals" of the Western Bible,
 the first three being found grouped round the Evangelists; and
 the fourth (the human face) is a Seraph, <em>i.e.</em>, a fiery
 serpent, the Gnostic Agathodaemon probably.* As explained, the
 "sacred animals" and the Flames or "Sparks"
 within the "Holy Four" refer to the prototypes of all
 that is found in the Universe in the <em>Divine Thought</em>,<em>
 </em>in the <strong>R</strong>OOT, which is the perfect cube,
 or the foundation of the Kosmos collectively and individually.
 They have all an occult reference to primordial Cosmic forms and
 its first concretions, work, and evolution.
 </p><p>
 In the earliest Hindu exoteric cosmogonies, it is not even the
 Demiurge who creates. For it is said in one of the Puranas that:
 "The great Architect of the World gives the first impulse
 to the rotatory motion of our planetary system by stepping in
 turn over each planet and body." It is this action "that
 causes each sphere to turn around itself, and all around the Sun."
 After which action, "it is the <em>Brahmandica</em>,<em>
 </em>the Solar and Lunar Pitris (the Dhyani-Chohans)" who
 take charge of their respective spheres (earths and planets),
 to the end of the Kalpa." The Creators are the Rishis; most
 of whom are credited with the authorship of the mantras or Hymns
 of the Rig Veda. They are sometimes seven, sometimes ten, when
 they become <em>prajapati</em>,<em> </em>the<em> </em>"Lord
 of Beings"; then they rebecome the <em>seven </em>and the
 <em>fourteen </em>Manus, as the representatives of the seven and
 fourteen <em>cycles </em>of Existence ("Days of Brahma");
 thus answering to the seven <em>AEons</em>,<em> </em>when at the
 end of the first stage of Evolution they are transformed into
 the seven stellar Rishis, the Saptarishis; while their <em>human
 </em>doubles appear as heroes, Kings and Sages on this earth.

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] when thou shalt have
 <em>thirty three years of age </em>thou wilt comprehend me."
 So with the mystery of the <em>tortoise. </em>Rejoicing over the
 poetry of Biblical metaphors, associating with the name of Jehovah,
 "incandescent stones," "sacred animals," etc.,
 and quoting from the <em>Bible de Vence </em>(<em>Vol. XIX. p.
 </em>318) a French pious writer says: "Indeed all of them
 are <em>Elohim like their God; </em>for, these Angels assume,
 <em>through a holy usurpation</em>,<em> </em>the very divine name
 of Jehovah each time they represent him." (<em>Pneumatologie</em>,<em>
 Vol. II.</em>,<em> p</em>. 294). No one ever doubted that <em>the
 </em>NAME must have been <em>assumed</em>,<em> </em>when under
 the guise of the Infinite, One Incognizable, the <em>Malachim
 </em>(messengers) descended to eat and drink with men. But if
 the Elohim (and even lower Beings), <em>assuming </em>the god-name,
 were and are still worshipped, why should the same Elohim be called
 <em>devils</em>,<em> </em>when appearing under the names of other
 Gods?
 </p><p>
 * The choice is curious, and shows how paradoxical were the first
 Christians in their selections. For why should they have chosen
 these symbols of Egyptian paganism, when the eagle is never mentioned
 in the New Testament save once, when Jesus refers to it as a <em>carrion
 </em>eater?<em> </em>(<em>Matt. </em>xxiv. 28); and in the Old
 Testament it is called <em>unclean</em>;<em> </em>that the Lion
 is made a point of comparison with Satan, both roaring for men
 to devour; and the oxen are driven out of the Temple. On the other
 hand the Serpent, brought as an exemplar of wisdom to follow,
 is now regarded as the symbol of the Devil. The esoteric pearl
 of Christ's religion degraded into Christian theology, may indeed
 be said to have chosen a strange and unfitting <em>shell </em>to
 be born in and evolved from.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 443 THE MYSTERY OF BLACKNESS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The Esoteric doctrine of the East having thus furnished and struck
 the key-note -- which is as scientific as it is philosophical
 and poetical, as may be seen, under its allegorical garb -- every
 nation has followed its lead. It is from the exoteric religions
 that we have to dig out the root-idea before we turn to esoteric
 truths, lest the latter should be rejected. Furthermore, every
 symbol -- in <em>every</em> national religion -- may be read esoterically,
 and the proof furnished for its being correctly read by transliterating
 it into its corresponding numerals and geometrical forms -- by
 the extraordinary agreement of all -- however much the glyphs
 and symbols may vary among themselves. For in the origin those
 symbols were all identical. Take, for instance, the opening sentences
 in various cosmogonies: in every case it is either a <em>circle</em>,<em>
 </em>an<em> egg</em>, or a <em>head. </em><strong>D</strong>ARKNESS
 is always associated with this first symbol and surrounds it,
 -- as shown in the Hindu, the Egyptian, the Chaldeo-Hebrew and
 even the Scandinavian systems -- hence black ravens, black doves,
 black waters and even black flames; the <em>seventh </em>tongue
 of Agni, the <em>fire-god </em>being called "<em>Kali</em>,"<em>
 </em>"the black," as it was a black flickering flame.
 Two <em>black </em>doves flew from Egypt and settling on the oaks
 of Dodona, gave their names to the Grecian gods. Noah lets out
 a <em>black </em>raven after the deluge, which is a symbol for
 the Cosmic pralaya, after which began the real creation or evolution
 of our earth and humanity. Odin's black ravens fluttered around
 the Goddess Saga and "whispered to her of the past and of
 the future." What is the real meaning of all those black
 birds? They are all connected with the primeval wisdom, which
 flows out of the pre-cosmic Source of all, symbolised by the Head,
 the Circle, the Egg; and they all have an identical meaning and
 relate to the primordial Archetypal man (Adam Kadmon) the creative
 origin of all things, which is composed of the Host of Cosmic
 Powers -- the Creative Dhyan-Chohans, beyond which all is darkness.
 </p><p>
 Let us inquire of the wisdom of the Kabala -- even veiled and
 distorted as it now is, -- to explain in its numerical language
 an approximate meaning, at least of the word "raven."
 This is its number value as given in the "Source of Measures."
 </p><p>
 "The term <em>Raven </em>is used but once, and taken as <em>eth-h</em>'<em>orebv
 <img src="sd1-443a.gif" align="MIDDLE">, = 678, or 113 x 6; while
 the Dove is mentioned five times. Its value is 71, and 71 x 5
 = 355. Six diameters, or the raven</em>, crossing, would divide
 the circumference of a circle of 355 into 12 parts or compartments;
 and 355 subdivided for each unit by 6, would equal 213-0, or the<em>
 head </em>("beginning") in the first verse of Genesis.
 This divided or subdivided, after the same fashion, by 2, or the
 355 by 12, would give 213-2, or the word <em>B</em>'<em>rash</em>,
 <img src="sd1-443b.gif" align="MIDDLE">, or the first word of
 Genesis, with its prepositional prefix, signifying the same concreted
 general form</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 444 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 astronomically, with the one here intended." Now the secret
 reading of the first verse of Genesis being: "In Rash (B'rash)
 or head, developed gods, the Heavens and the Earth" -- it
 is easy to comprehend the esoteric meaning of the <em>raven</em>,<em>
 </em>once that the like meaning of the Flood (or Noah's Deluge)
 is ascertained. Whatever the many other meanings of this emblematical
 allegory may be, its <em>chief</em> meaning is that of a new cycle
 and a new Round (our <em>Fourth </em>Round.)* The "Raven,"
 or the <em>Eth-H</em>'<em>Orebv</em>,<em> </em>yields the same
 numerical value as the "Head," and returned not to the
 ark, while the dove returned, carrying the olive-branch, when
 Noah, the new man of the new Race (whose prototype is Vaivasvata
 Manu), prepared to leave the ark, the womb (or <em>Argha</em>)<em>
 </em>of terrestrial nature, is the symbol of the purely spiritual,
 sexless and androgyne man of the first three Races, who vanished
 from earth for ever. Numerically Jehovah, Adam, Noah, are one
 in the Kabala: at best, then, it is Deity descending on to Ararat
 (later on Sinai), to incarnate in man his <em>image</em>,<em>
 </em>through the natural process, henceforth: the mother's womb,
 whose symbols are the ark, the mount (Sinai), etc., in <em>Genesis.
 </em>The Jewish allegory is at once astronomical, and purely physiological
 rather than anthropomorphic.
 </p><p>
 And here lies the abyss between the two systems (Aryan and Semitic),
 though built on the same foundation. As shown by an expounder
 of the Kabala, "the basic idea underlying the philosophy
 of the Hebrews was that God contained all things within himself
 and that man was <em>his image; </em>man, including woman (as
 Androgynes);" and that "geometry and numbers (and measures
 applicable to astronomy) are contained in the terms <em>man </em>and<em>
 woman; </em>and the apparent incongruity of such a mode was eliminated
 by showing the connection of man and woman with a particular system
 of numbers and measures and geometry, by the parturient time-periods,
 which furnished the connecting link between the terms and the
 facts shown, and perfected the mode used." It is argued that,
 the primal cause being absolutely incognizable, "the symbol
 of its first<em> comprehensible manifestation </em>was the conception
 of a circle with its diameter line, so as at once to carry the
 idea of geometry, phallicism, and astronomy;" and this was
 finally applied to the "signification of simply human generative
 organs."** Hence the whole cycle of events
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 * Bryant is right in saying "Druid Bardesin says of Noah
 that when he came out of the ark (the birth of a new cycle), after
 a stay therein of a year and a day, that 364 + 1 = 365 days, he
 was congratulated by Neptune upon his birth from the waters of
 the Flood, who wished him a <em>happy New Year.</em>"<em>
 </em>The "Year," or cycle, esoterically, was the new<em>
 </em>race of men <em>born from woman </em>after the separation
 of the sexes, which is <em>the secondary </em>meaning of the allegory:
 its primary meaning being the beginning of the Fourth Round, or
 the <em>new </em>Creation.

 from Adam and the Patriarchs down to Noah is made to apply to
 phallic and astronomical uses, the one regulating the other, as
 the lunar periods, for instance. Hence, too, their <em>genesis
 </em>begins after their coming out of the Ark, and the close of
 the flood -- at the Fourth Race. With the Aryan people it is different.
 </p><p>
 Eastern Esotericism has never degraded the One Infinite Deity,
 the container of all things, to such uses; and this is shown by
 the absence of Brahma from the Rig Veda and the modest positions
 occupied therein by Rudra and Vishnu, who became the powerful
 and great Gods, the "Infinites" of the exoteric creeds,
 ages later. But even they, "Creators" as the three may
 be, are not the direct creators and "forefathers of men."
 The latter are shown occupying a still lower scale, and are called
 Prajapatis, the Pitris (our lunar ancestors), etc., etc. -- never
 the "One Infinite God." Esoteric philosophy shows only
 <em>physical </em>man as created <em>in the image </em>of the
 Deity: but the latter is but "the <em>minor gods.</em>"<em>
 </em>It<em> </em>is the <strong>H</strong>IGHER-<strong>S</strong>ELF,
 the real <strong>E</strong>GO who alone is divine and GOD.
