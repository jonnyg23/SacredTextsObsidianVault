 It seems, however, possible to calculate the <i>approximate </i>duration
 of the geological periods from the combined data of Science and
 Occultism now before us. Geology is, of course, able to determine
 almost with certainty one thing -- the thickness of the several
 deposits. Now, it also stands to reason that the time required
 for the deposition of any stratum on a sea-bottom must bear a
 strict proportion to the thickness of the mass thus formed. Doubtless
 the <i>rate </i>of erosion of land and the sorting out of matter
 on to ocean beds has varied from age to age, and cataclysmic changes
 of various kinds break the "uniformity" of ordinary
 geological processes. <i>Provided, however, we have some definite
 numerical basis on which to work, </i>our task is rendered less
 difficult than it might at first sight appear to be. Making due
 allowance for variations in the rate of deposit, Professor Lefevre
 gives us the <i>relative </i>figures which sum up geological time.
 He does not attempt to calculate the lapse of years since the
 first bed of the Laurentian rocks was deposited, but postulating
 that time as = X, he presents us with the relative proportions
 in which the various periods stand to it. Let us premise our estimate
 by stating that, roughly speaking, the Primordial rocks are 70,000
 ft., the Primary 42,000 ft., the Secondary 15,000 ft., the Tertiary
 5,000 ft., and the Quaternary some 500 ft. in thickness: --
 </p><p>
 "Dividing into an hundred parts the time, <i>whatever its
 actual length, </i>that has passed since the dawn of life on this
 earth (lower Laurentian strata), we shall be led to attribute
 to the primordial age more than half of the whole duration, say
 53.5; to the Primary 32.2; to the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 710 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Secondary 11.5; to the Tertiary 2.3; to the Quaternary 0.5 or
 one-half per cent." ("Philosophy," p. 481.)
 </p><p>
 Now, as it is certain, on occult data, that the time which has
 elapsed since the first sedimentary deposits = 320,000,000 years,
 we are able to infer that the: --
 </p><p>
 ROUGH APPROXIMATIONS.
 </p><p>
 Primordial lasted 171,200,000 years.<br>
 Laurentian<br>
 Cambrian<br>
 Silurian
 </p><p>
 Primary lasted 103,040,000 years<br>
 Devonian<br>
 Coal<br>
 Permian
 </p><p>
 Secondary lasted 36,800,000 years<br>
 Triassic<br>
 Jurassic<br>
 Cretaceous
 </p><p>
 Tertiary lasted 7,360,000 years (probably in excess)<br>
 Eocene<br>
 Miocene<br>
 Pliocene
 </p><p>
 Quaternary lasted 1,600,000 years (probably in excess).
 </p><p>
 Such estimates harmonise with the statements of Esoteric Ethnology
 in almost every particular. The <i>Tertiary </i>Atlantean part-cycle,
 from the "apex of glory" of that Race in the early Eocene
 to the great mid-Miocene cataclysm, would appear to have lasted
 some 3 1/2 to four million years. If the duration of the Quaternary
 is not rather (as seems likely) overestimated, the sinking of
 Ruta and Daitya would be post-Tertiary. It is probable that the
 results here given allow somewhat too long a period to both the
 Tertiary and Quaternary, as the <i>Third Race </i>goes very far
 back into the Secondary Age. Nevertheless, the figures are most
 suggestive.
 </p><p>
 But the argument from <i>geological evidence </i>being only in
 favour of 100,000,000 years, let us compare <i>our</i> claims
 and teachings with those of<i> exact </i>science.
 </p><p>
 Mr. Edward Clodd,* in reviewing M. de Mortillet's work "<i>Materiaux
 pour l</i>'<i>Histoire de Homme,</i>"<i> </i>which places
 man in the mid-Miocene period,** remarks that "it would be
 in defiance of all that the doctrine of evolu-

 ** And who yet, in another work, "<i>La Prehistorique Antiquite
 de l</i>'<i>Homme,</i>"<i> </i>some twenty years ago, generously
 allowed only 230,000 years to our mankind. Since we learn now
 that he places man "in the mid-Miocene period," we must
 say that the much respected Professor of Prehistoric Anthropology
 (in Paris) is somewhat contradictory and inconsistent, if not
 <i>naif</i> in his views.</p><hr>

 <p>
 tion teaches, and moreover, win no support from believers in special
 creation and the fixity of species, to seek for so highly specialized
 a mammalian as man at an early stage in the life-history of the
 globe." To this, one could answer: (<i>a</i>) the doctrine
 of evolution, as inaugurated by Darwin and developed by later
 evolutionists, is not only the reverse of<i> infallible, </i>but
 it is repudiated by several great men of science, <i>e.g</i>.,
 de Quatrefages, in France, and Dr. Weismann, an <i>ex</i>-evolutionist
 in Germany, and many others, the ranks of the <i>anti</i>-Darwinists
 growing stronger with every year;* and (<i>b</i>) truth to be
 worthy of its name, and remain truth and fact, hardly needs to
 beg for support from any class or sect. For were it to <i>win
 support </i>from believers in special creation, it would never
 gain the favour of the evolutionists, and <i>vice versa. </i>Truth
 must rest upon its own firm foundations of facts, and take its
 chances for recognition, when every prejudice in the way is disposed
 of. Though the question has been already fully considered in its
 main aspects, it is, nevertheless, advisable to combat every so-called
 "<i>scientific</i>"<i> </i>objection as we go along,
 when making what are regarded as heretical and "anti-scientific"
 statements.
 </p><p>
 Let us briefly glance at the divergences between orthodox and
 esoteric science, on the question of the age of the globe and
 of man. With the two respective synchronistic tables before him,
 the reader will be enabled to see at a glance the importance of
 these divergences; and to perceive, at the same time, that it
 is not impossible -- nay, it is most likely -- that further discoveries
 in geology and the finding of fossil remains of man will force
 science to confess that it is esoteric philosophy which is right
 after all, or, at any rate, nearer to the truth.

 Leaving the classification of the geological periods to Western
 Science, esoteric philosophy divides only the life-periods on

 is separated into seven Kalpas and seven great human races. Its

 have found lately very serious opponents in Germany. Du Bois-Reymond

 as eminent as any, find insuperable difficulties and even impossibilities
 in the doctrine.

 <strong>PRIMORDIAL</strong> <strong>E</strong>POCH (Laurentian
 System, Cambrian System, Silurian System)
 </p><p>
 The Primordial Epoch is, science tells us, by no means devoid
 of vegetable and animal life. In the Laurentian deposits are found
 specimens of the<i> Eozoon Canadense -</i>- a chambered shell.
 In the Silurian are discovered sea-weeds (<i>algae</i>), molluscs,
 crustacea, and lower marine organisms, also the first trace of
 fishes. The primordial Epoch shows algae, molluscs, crustacea,
 polyps, and marine organisms, etc., etc. Science teaches, therefore,
 that marine life was present from the very beginnings of time,
 leaving us, however, to speculate for ourselves as to <i>how </i>life
 appeared on earth. If it rejects the Biblical "Creation"
 (as we do), why does it not give us another, approximately plausible
 hypothesis?
 </p><p>
 <strong>PRIMARY</strong> (Devonian***, Coal, Permian)

 </p><p>
 [[Second Column continued from previous page]]
 </p><p>
 "<strong>PRIMEVAL</strong>"* (<i>Deva </i>or Divine
 men, the "Creators" and Progenitors.**)
 </p><p>
 The Esoteric Philosophy agrees with the statement made by science
 (see parallel column), demurring, however, in one particular.
 The 300,000,000 years of vegetable life (see "Brahminical
 Chronology") preceded the "Divine Men," or Progenitors.
 Also, no teaching denies that there were traces of life <i>within</i>
 the Earth besides the <i>Eozoon Canadense </i>in the Primordial
 Epoch. Only, whereas the said vegetation belonged to this Round,
 the zoological relics now found in the Laurentian, Cambrian, and
 Silurian systems, so called, <i>are the relics of </i>the<i> Third
 </i>Round. At first <i>astral </i>like the rest, they consolidated
 and materialized <i>pari passu </i>with the NEW vegetation.
 </p><p>
 "<strong>PRIMARY</strong>" -- Divine Progenitors, SECONDARY
 GROUPS, and the 2 1/2 races. "Fern-forests, Sigillaria, Coniferae,
 fishes, first trace of reptiles." Thus saith modern science;
 the esoteric doctrine repeats that which was said above. These
 are all relics of the preceding Round.**** Once, however, the
 prototypes are projected out of the astral envelope of the earth,
 an indefinite amount of modification ensues.

 <strong>S</strong>ECONDARY (Triassic. Jurassic. Chalk or Cretaceous.)
 </p><p>
 This is the age of Reptiles, of the gigantic Megalosauri, Ichthyosauri,
 Plesiosauri, etc., etc. Science denies the presence of man in
 that period. If so, it has to explain how men came to know of
 these monsters and describe them <i>before </i>the age of Cuvier?
 The old annals of China, India, Egypt, and even of Judea are full
 of them, as demonstrated elsewhere. In this period also appear
 the first (marsupial) mammals***** -- Insectivorous, carnivorous,
 phytophagous; and (as Prof. Owen thinks) an herbivorous hoofed
 mammal.
 </p><p>
 Science does not admit the appearance of man before <i>the close
 </i>of the

 </p><p>
 <strong>S</strong>ECONDARY -- According to every calculation the
 Third Race had already made its appearance, as during the Triassic
 there were already a few mammals, and it must have separated.
 </p><p>
 This, then, is the age of the Third Race, in which the origins
 of the early Fourth may be perhaps also discoverable. We are,
 however, here left entirely to conjecture, as no definite data
 are yet given out by the Initiates.
 </p><p>
 The analogy is but a poor one, still it may be argued that, as
 the early Mammalia and pre-mammalia are shown in their evolution
 merging from one kind into a higher one, anatomically, so are
 the human races in their procreative processes. A parallel might
 certainly be found between the Monotremata, the Didelphia (or
 Marsupialia) and the placental Mammals, divided in their turn
 into three orders******

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] <i>Primary-Age Man.
 </i>The parallelism of Races and geological periods here adopted,
 is, so far as the origin of 1<i>st and </i>2<i>nd </i>are concerned,
 purely tentative, no direct information being available. Having
 previously discussed the question of a possible Race in the <i>Carboniferous
 Age, </i>it is needless to renew the debate.
 </p><p>
 **** During the <i>interim</i> from one Round to another, the
 globe and everything on it remains <i>in statu quo. </i>Remember,
 Vegetation began in its ethereal form before what is called the
 Primordial, running through the Primary, and condensing in it,
 and reaching its full physical life in the Secondary.
 </p><p>
 ***** Geologists tell us that "in the secondary epoch, the
 only mammals which have been (hitherto) discovered <i>in Europe
 </i>are the fossil remains of a small marsupial or pouch-bearer."
 (<i>Knowledge, March </i>31, 1882, <i>p</i> 464.) Surely the marsupial
 or didelphis (the only surviving animal of the family of those
 who were on earth during the presence on it of androgyne man)
 cannot be the only animal that was then on earth? Its presence
 speaks loudly for that of other (though unknown) mammals, besides
 the monotremes and marsupials, and thus shows the appellation
 of "mammalian age" given only to the Tertiary period
 to be misleading and erroneous; as it allows one to infer that
 there were no mammals, but reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fishes
 alone in the Mesozoic times -- the Secondary.
 </p><p>
 ****** These <i>Placentalia </i>of the third sub-class are divided,
 it appears, into Villiplacentalia (placenta composed of many separate
 scattered tufts), the Zonoplacentalia (girdle-shaped placenta),
 and the discoplacentaIia (or discoid). Haeckel sees in the Marsupialia
 <i>Didelphia</i>, one of the connecting links <i>genealogically
 </i>between man and the Moneron!!</p><hr>

 Tertiary period.* Why? Because man has to be shown younger than
 the higher mammals. But Esoteric philosophy teaches us the reverse.
 And as science is quite unable to come to anything like an approximate
 conclusion as to the age of man, or even the geological periods,
 therefore, even accepted only as a hypothesis, the occult teaching
 is more logical and reasonable.
 </p><p>
 No man is yet allowed to have lived during this period: --

 Says Mr. E. Clodd, in <i>Knowledge</i>: -- "Although the
 placental mammals and the order of Primates to which man is related,
 appear in Tertiary times and the climate, tropical in the Eocene
 age, warm in the Miocene and temperate in the Pliocene, was favourable
 to his presence, the proofs of his existence <i>in Europe </i>before
 the close of the Tertiary epoch . . . . are not generally accepted
 here."

 would require more space than can be now allotted to the subject.

 Tertiary age -- The Third race has now almost utterly disappeared,
 carried away by the fearful geological cataclysms of the Secondary
 age, leaving behind it but a few hybrid races.
 </p><p>
 The Fourth, born millions of years before**** the said cataclysm
 took place, perishes during the Miocene period,****** when the
 Fifth (our Aryan race) had one million years of independent existence.

 who knows? As the "Historical" Period has begun, with
 the Indian Aryans, with their <i>Vedas, </i>for their multitudes,******
 and far earlier in the Esoteric Records, it is useless to establish
 here any parallels.

 * Those who feel inclined to sneer at that doctrine of Esoteric
 Ethnology, which pre-supposes the existence of Man in the <i>Secondary
 </i>Age, will do well to note the fact that one of the most distinguished
 anthropologists of the day, M. de Quatrefages, seriously argues
 in that direction. He writes: "There is nothing impossible
 in the supposition that he (Man) may have appeared on the globe
 <i>with</i> <i>the first representatives of the type to which
 he belongs in virtue of his organism.</i>"<i> </i>This statement
 approximates most closely to our fundamental assertion that man
 preceded the other mammalia.
 </p><p>
 Professor Lefevre admits that the "labours of Boucher de
 Perthes, Lartet, Christy, Bourgeois, Desnoyers, Broca, de Mortillet,
 Hamy, Gaudry, Capellini, and a hundred others, have overcome all
 doubts and clearly established the progressive development of
 the human organism and industries from the <i>Miocene epoch of
 the Tertiary age.</i>"<i> </i>("Philosophy," p.
 499, chapter on Organic Evolution.) Why does he reject the possibility
 of a Secondary-Age man? Simply because he is involved in the meshes
 of the Darwinian Anthropology!! "The origin of man is bound
 up with that of the higher mammals;" he appeared "only
 with the <i>last </i>types of his class"!! This is not [[Footnote

 ** This inclusion of the First Race in the Secondary is necessarily
 only a provisional working-hypothesis -- the actual chronology
 of the First, Second, and Early Third Races being closely veiled
 by the Initiates. For all that can be said on the subject, the
 First Root-Race may have been Pre-Secondary, as is, indeed, taught.
 (<i>Vide supra.</i>)
 </p><p>
 *** The above parallels stand good only if Professor Croll's earlier
 calculations are adopted, namely, of 15,000,000 years since the
 beginning of the Eocene period (see Charles Gould's "Mythical
 Monsters," p. 84), not those in his "Climate and Time,"
 which allow only 2 1/2 million years', or at the utmost three
 million years' duration to the Tertiary age. This, however, would
 make the whole duration of the incrusted age of the world only
 131,600,000 years according to Professor Winchell, whereas in
 the Esoteric doctrine, sedimentation began in <i>this Round </i>approximately
 over 320 million years ago. Yet his calculations do not clash
 much with ours with regard to the epochs of glacial periods in
 the Tertiary age, which is called in our Esoteric books the age
 of the "Pigmies." With regard to the 320 millions of
 years assigned to sedimentation, it must be noted that even a
 greater time elapsed during the preparation of this globe for
 the Fourth Round <i>previous to stratification.</i> 
 </p><p>
 **** Though we apply the term "truly human," only to
 the Fourth Atlantean Root-Race, yet the Third Race is almost human
 in its latest portion, since it is during its fifth sub-race that
 mankind <i>separated</i> sexually, and that the <i>first man was
 born </i>according to the now normal process. This "first
 man" answers in the Bible (<i>Genesis</i>)<i> </i>to Enos
 or Henoch, son of Seth (ch. iv.).
 </p><p>
 ***** Geology records the former existence of a universal ocean,
 sheets of marine sediments uniformly present everywhere testifying
 to it; but, it is not even the epoch referred to in the allegory
 of Vaivasvata Manu. The latter is a <i>Deva-Man </i>(or Manu)
 saving in an ark (the <i>female</i> principle) the germs of humanity,
 and also the seven Rishis -- who stand here as the symbols for
 the seven human principles -- of which allegory we have spoken
 elsewhere. The "Universal Deluge" is the watery abyss
 of the Primordial Principle of Berosus. (<i>See Stanzas from </i>2<i>
 to </i>8 in Part I.). How, if Croll allowed fifteen million years
 to have elapsed since the Eocene period (which we state on the
 authority of a Geologist, Mr. Ch. Gould) only 60 millions are
 assigned by him "since the beginning of the Cambrian period,
 in the <i>Primordial Age</i>"<i> -- </i>passes comprehension.
 The Secondary strata are twice the thickness of the Tertiary,
 and Geology thus shows the Secondary age alone to be of twice
 the length of the Tertiary. Shall we then accept only 15 million
 years for both the Primary and the Primordial? No wonder Darwin
 rejected the calculation.
 </p><p>
 ****** We hope that we have furnished all the Scientific data
 for it elsewhere.
 </p><p>
 ******* It is conceded by Geology to be "beyond doubt that
 a considerable period must have supervened after the departure
 of Palaeolithic man and before the arrival of his Neolithic successor."

 "Mythical Monsters," p. 98).</p><hr>

 <p>
 man is made out almost an abject savage, his lake dwellings notwithstanding.*
 For see what a learned geologist, Mr. Charles Gould, tells the
 reader in his "Mythical Monsters": --
 </p><p>
 "Palaeolithic men were unacquainted with pottery and the
 art of weaving, and apparently had no domesticated animals or
 system of cultivation; but the Neolithic lake-dwellers of Switzerland
 had looms, pottery, cereals, sheep, horses," etc., etc.
 </p><p>
 Yet, though "Implements of horn, bone, and wood were in common
 use among both races . . . those of the older are frequently distinguished
 <i>by their being sculptured with great ability, or ornamented
 with life-like engravings of the various animals living at the
 period</i>;<i> </i>whereas there appears to have been <i>a marked
 absence of any similar artistic ability** </i>on<i> </i>the part
 of Neolithic man." Let us give the reasons for it.
 </p><p>
 (1) The oldest fossil man, the primitive cave-men of the old Palaeolithic
 period, and of the Pre-glacial period (of whatever length, and
 however far back), is always the same genus man, and there are
 no fossil remains proving for him "what the Hipparion and
 Anchitherium have proved for the genus horse -- that is, gradual
 progressive specialization from a simple ancestral type to more
 complex existing forms" ("<i>Modern Science,</i>"<i>
 </i>p. 181).
 </p><p>
 (2) As to the so-called Palaeolithic <i>hatchet</i> . . . "when
 placed side by side with the rudest forms of stone hatchets actually
 used by the Australian and other savages, it is difficult to detect
 any difference" (<i>Ibid,</i> p<i>. </i>112). This goes to
 prove that there have been savages <i>at all times</i>;<i> </i>and
 the inference would be that there might have been civilized people
 in those days as well, cultured nations contemporary with those
 rude savages. We see such a thing in Egypt 7,000 years ago.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Resembling in a manner the <i>pile-villages </i>of Northern
 Borneo.
 </p><p>
 ** "The <i>most clever sculptor of modern times </i>would
 probably not succeed very much better, if his graver were a splinter
 of flint and stone and bone were the materials to be engraved"!!
 (Prof. Boyd Dawkins' "Cave-Hunting," p. 344.) It is
 needless after such a concession to further insist on Huxley's,
 Schmidt's, Laing's, and others' statements to the effect that
 Palaeolithic man cannot be considered to lead us back in any way
 to a pithecoid human race; thus demolishing the fantasies of many
 superficial evolutionists. The relic of artistic merit here <i>re-appearing
 </i>in the Chipped-Stone-Age men, is traceable to their <i>Atlantean</i>
 ancestry. Neolithic man was a fore-runner of the great <i>Aryan</i>
 invasion, and immigrated from quite another quarter -- Asia, and
 in a measure Northern Africa. (The tribes peopling the latter
 towards the North-West, were certainly of an Atlantean origin
 -- dating back hundreds of thousands of years before the Neolithic
 Period in Europe, -- but they had so diverged from the parent
 type as to present no longer any marked characteristic peculiar
 to it.) As to the contrast between Neolithic and Palaeolithic
 Man, it is <i>a remarkable fact that, as Carl Vogt remarks, the
 former was a cannibal, the much earlier man of the Mammoth era
 not. </i>Human manners and customs do not seem to improve with
 time, then? Not in this instance at any rate.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 717 ONE SALVATION FOR SCIENCE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 (3) An obstacle which is the direct consequence of the two preceding:
 Man, if no older than the Palaeolithic period, could not possibly
 have had the actual time to get transformed from the "missing
 link" into what he is known to have been even during that
 remote geological time, <i>i.e.</i>, even <i>a finer specimen
 than many of the now existing races.</i> 
 </p><p>
 The above lends itself naturally to the following syllogism: (1)
 The <i>primitive </i>man (known to Science) was, in some respects,
 even a finer man of his genus than he is now. (2) The earliest
 monkey known, the <i>lemur,</i> was<i> less </i>anthropoid than
 the modern pithecoid species. (3)<i> Conclusion</i>:<i> </i>even
 though a <i>missing link </i>were found, the balance of evidence
 would remain more in favour of the ape <i>being a degenerated
 man </i>made dumb by some fortuitous circumstances,* than tending
 to show that man descends from a pithecoid ancestor. The theory
 cuts both ways.
 </p><p>
 On the other hand, if the existence of Atlantis is accepted, and
 the statement is believed that in the Eocene Age "even in
 its very first part, the great cycle of the fourth race men, the
 Atlanteans had already reached its highest point . . . ."
 (Esoteric Buddhism, p. 64) then some of the present difficulties
 of science might be easily made to disappear. The rude workmanship
 of the Palaeolithic tools proves nothing against the idea that,
 side by side with their makers, there lived nations highly civilized.
 We are told that "only a very small portion of the earth's
 surface has been explored, and of this a very small portion consists
 of ancient land surfaces or fresh water formations, where alone
 we can expect to meet with traces of the higher forms of animal
 life," . . . and that "even these have been so imperfectly
 explored, that where we now meet with thousands and tens of thousands
 of undoubted human remains lying almost under our feet, it is
 only within the last thirty years that their existence has even
 been suspected" (p. 98). It is very suggestive also that
 along with the rude <i>haches </i>of the lowest savage, explorers
 meet with specimens of workmanship of such artistic merit as could
 hardly be found, or expected, in a modern peasant belonging to
 any European country -- unless in exceptional cases. The "portrait"
 of the "Reindeer feeding," from the Thayngin grotto
 in Switzerland, and those of the man running, with two horse's
 heads sketched close to him -- a work of the Reindeer period,
 <i>i.e., at least 50,000 years </i>ago -- are pronounced by Mr.
 Laing not only exceedingly well done, but, especially the reindeer

 born dumb -- might by breeding produce a dumb <i>Pastrana </i>species,

 -- by no means exaggerated praise, as anyone may see (<i>Vide
 infra</i>)<i>. </i>Now, since side by side with the modern Esquimaux,
 who also have a tendency, like their Palaeolithic ancestors of
 the Reindeer period, <i>the rude and savage human species, </i>to
 be constantly drawing with the point of their knives sketches
 of animals, scenes of the chase, etc., we have our greatest painters
 of Europe, why could not the same have happened in those days?
 Compared with the specimens of Egyptian drawing and sketching
 -- "7,000 years ago" -- the<i> </i>"<i>earliest
 </i>portraits" of men, horses' heads, and reindeer, made
 50,000 years ago, <i>are certainly superior. </i>Nevertheless,
 the Egyptians of those periods are known to have been a highly
 civilized nation, whereas the Palaeolithic men are called <i>savages
 </i>of the lower type. This is a small matter seemingly, yet extremely
 suggestive as showing that every new geological discovery is made
 to fit in with current theories, instead of the reverse. Yes;
 Mr. Huxley is right in saying, "Time will show." It
 will, and must vindicate Occultism.
 </p><p>
 Meanwhile, the most uncompromising materialists are driven by
 necessity into the most <i>occult-like </i>admissions. Strange
 to say, it is the most materialistic -- those of the German school
 -- who, with regard to<i> physical </i>development, come the nearest
 to the teachings of the Occultists. Thus, Professor Baumgartner,
 who believes that "the germs for the higher animals could
 only be the eggs of the lower animals"; who thinks that "besides
 the advance of the vegetable and animal world in development,
 there occurred in that period the formation of <i>new original
 germs,</i>"<i> </i>which formed the basis of new metamorphoses,
 etc. -- thinks also that "the first men who proceeded from
 the germs of animals beneath them, lived first in a <i>larva </i>state."
 </p><p>
 Just so, in a <i>larva</i> state, we say, too; only from no "animal"
 germ, and that "larva" was the soulless astral form
 of the pre-physical Races. And we believe, as the German professor
 does, with several other men of Science in Europe now, that the
 human races "have not descended from one pair, but appeared
 immediately in numerous races"; (<i>Anfange zu einer Physiologischen
 Schopfungs-geschichte der Pflanzen und Thierwelt, </i>1885). Therefore,
 when we read "Force and Matter," and find that Emperor
 of Materialists, Buchner, repeating after Manu and Hermes, that
 "the plant passes imperceptibly into the animal, and the
 animal into man" (p. 85), we need only add "and man
 into a spirit," to complete the Kabalistic axiom. The more
 so, since on page 82 of the same work we read the following admission:
 . . . "Produced in the way of spontaneous generation . .
 . it is by the aid of intense natural forces and<i> endless periods
 of time </i>(that) there has progressively arisen that rich and
 infinitely modified organic world by which we are at present surrounded."
 . . . And (page 84) "Spontaneous generation played, no doubt,
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 719 BETWEEN TWO VOIDS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <i>a more important part in the primeval epoch than at present</i>;<i>
 nor can it be denied that in this way beings of a higher organization
 </i>were produced than now,"* for this is the claim of Occultism.
 </p><p>
 The whole difference lies in this: Modern Science places her materialistic
 theory of primordial germs on earth, and the <i>last germ of </i>life
 on this globe, of man, and everything else, between <i>two voids.
 </i>Whence the <i>first </i>germ, if both spontaneous generation
 and the interference of external forces, are absolutely rejected
 now? Germs of organic life, we are told, by Sir W. Thomson, <i>came
 to our earth in some meteor? </i>This helps in no way and only
 shifts the difficulty from this earth to the supposed meteor.
 </p><p>
 These are our agreements and disagreements with Science. About
 the<i> endless periods </i>we are, of course, at one even with
 materialistic speculation; for we believe in Evolution, though
 on different lines. Professor Huxley very wisely says: "If
 <i>any form </i>of progressive development <i>is </i>correct,
 we must extend by long epochs the most liberal estimate that has
 yet been made of the antiquity of man." But when we are told
 that this man is a product of the natural forces inherent <i>in</i>
 matter, <i>force, </i>according to modern views, being but a quality
 of matter, a "mode of motion," etc.; and when we find
 Sir W. Thomson repeating in 1885 what was asserted by Buchner
 and <i>his </i>school thirty years ago, we fear all our reverence
 for real Science is vanishing into thin air! One can hardly help
 thinking that materialism is, in certain cases, a <i>disease.
 </i>For when men of Science, in the face of the magnetic phenomena
 and the attraction of iron particles through insulating substances,
 like glass, maintain that the said attraction is due to "molecular
 motion," or to the "rotation of the molecules of the
 magnet," then, whether the teaching comes from a "credulous"
 Theosophist innocent of any notion of physics, or from an eminent
 man of Science, it is equally ridiculous. The individual who asserts
 such a theory in the teeth of <i>fact, </i>is only one more proof
 that "When people have not a niche in their minds in which
 to shoot facts, so much the worse for the facts."
 </p><p>
 As present the dispute between the spontaneous generationists
 and their opponents is at rest, having ended in the provisional
 victory of the latter. But even they are forced to admit, as Buchner
 did, and Messrs. Tyndall and Huxley still do -- that spontaneous
 generation <i>must have occurred once, </i>under "special
 thermal conditions." Virchow refuses even to argue the question;
 it <i>must </i>have taken place sometime in the history of our
 planet: and there's an end of it. This seems to look more natural
 than Sir W. Thomson's hypothesis just quoted, that the germs of
 organic life fell on our earth in some meteor; or that other

 <i>scientific </i>hypothesis coupled to the recently adopted belief
 that there exists <i>no </i>"Vital principle" whatever,
 but only vital phenomena, which can all be traced to the molecular
 forces of the original protoplasm. But this does not help Science
 to solve the still greater problem -- the origin and <i>the descent

 </p><p>
 "While we can trace the skeletons of Eocene mammals through
 several directions of specialization in succeeding Tertiary times,
 man presents the phenomenon of an <i>unspecialized </i>skeleton

 </p><p>
 The secret could be soon told, not only from the esoteric but
 even from the standpoint of every religion the world over, without
 mentioning the Occultists. The "specialized skeleton"
 is sought for in the wrong place, where it can never be found.
 It is expected to be discovered in the physical remains of man,
 in some pithecoid "missing link," with a skull larger
 than that of the ape's, and with a cranial capacity smaller than
 in man, <i>instead </i>of looking for that <i>specialization </i>in<i>
 the super-physical essence of his inner astral constitution, which
 can hardly be excavated from any geological strata! </i>Such a
 tenacious, hopeful clinging to a self-degrading theory is the
 most wonderful feature of the day.

 Meanwhile, this is a specimen of an engraving made by a <i>Palaeolithic
 </i>"savage": Palaeolithic meaning the "earlier
 Stone-age" man, one supposed to have been as savage and brutal
 as the brutes he lived with.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 721 THE PALAEOLITHIC LANDSEER.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Leaving the modern South Sea Islander, or even any Asiatic race,
 aside, we defy any grown-up schoolboy, or even a European youth,
 one who has never studied drawing, to execute such an engraving
 or even a pencil sketch. Here we have the true artistic <i>raccourci,
 </i>and correct lights and shadows without any <i>plane </i>model
 before the artist, who copied direct from nature, thus exhibiting
 a knowledge of anatomy and proportion. The artist who engraved
 this reindeer belonged, we are asked to believe, to the primitive
 "semi-animal" savages (contemporaneous with the mammoth
 and the woolly rhinoceros), whom some over-zealous Evolutionists
 once sought to picture to us as distinct approximations to the
 type of their hypothetical "pithecoid man"!
 </p><p>
 This engraved antler proves as eloquently as any fact can that
 the evolution of the races has ever proceeded in a series of rises
 and falls, that man, perhaps, is as old as incrustated Earth,
 and -- if we can call his Divine ancestor "Man" -- far
 older still.
 </p><p>
 Even de Mortillet himself seems to experience a vague distrust
 of the conclusions of modern archaeologists, when he writes: --
 "The prehistoric is a new science, <i>far, very far, </i>from
 having said its last word." ("<i>Prehist. Antiq. of
 Man,</i>"<i> </i>1883.) According to Lyell, one of the highest
 authorities on the subject, and the "Father" of Geology:
 -- "The expectation of always meeting with a lower type of
 human skull, the older the formation in which it occurs, <i>is
 based on the theory of progressive development,</i> and it <i>may</i>
 prove to be sound; nevertheless we must remember that as yet <i>we
 have no distinct geological evidence that the appearance of what
 are called the inferior races of mankind has always preceded in
 chronological order that of the higher races.</i>"<i> </i>("<i>Antiq.
 of Man,</i>"<i> </i>p<i>. </i>25.) Nor has such evidence
 been found to this day. Science is thus offering for sale the
 skin of a bear, which has hitherto never been seen by mortal eye!
 </p><p>
 This concession of Lyell's reads most suggestively with the subjoined
 utterance of Professor Max Muller, whose attack on the Darwinian
 Anthropology from the standpoint of LANGUAGE has, by the way,
 never been satisfactorily answered: --
 </p><p>
 "What do we know of savage tribes beyond the <i>last chapter
 of their history?</i>"<i> </i>(Cf. this with the esoteric
 view of the Australians, Bushmen, as well as of Palaeolithic European
 man, the Atlantean offshoots retaining a relic of a lost culture,
 which throve when the parent Root-Race was in its prime.) "Do
 we ever get an insight into their antecedents. . . . <i>How have
 they come to be what they are? </i>. . . . Their language proves,
 indeed, that these so-called heathens, with their complicated
 systems of mythology, their artificial customs, their unintelligible
 whims and savageries, are not the creatures of to-day or yesterday.
 Unless we admit a special creation for these savages, they must
 be as old as the Hindus, the Greeks and Romans (far older). .
 . .</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 722 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 They may have passed through ever so many vicissitudes, and <i>what
 we consider as primitive, may be, for all we know, a </i>RELAPSE
 INTO SAVAGERY or a corruption of something that was more rational
 and intelligible in former stages." ("India," 1883,
 F. Max Muller.)
 </p><p>
 "The primeval savage is a familiar term in modern literature,"
 remarks Professor Rawlinson, "but there is no evidence that
 the primeval savage ever existed. Rather <i>all the evidence looks
 the other way.</i>"<i> </i>("<i>Antiq. of Man Historically
 Considered.</i>")<i> </i>In his "Origin of Nations,"
 pp. 10-11, he rightly adds: "<i>The mythical traditions of
 almost all nations place at the beginning of human history a time
 of happiness and perfection, </i>a 'golden age' which has no features
 of savagery or barbarism, but many of civilization and refinement."
 How is the modern evolutionist to meet this consensus of evidence?
 </p><p>
 We repeat the question asked in "Isis Unveiled": "Does
 the finding of the remains in the cave of Devon prove that there
 were no contemporary races then who were highly civilized? When
 the present population of the earth have disappeared, and some
 archaeologist belonging to the 'coming race' of the distant future
 shall excavate the domestic implements of one of our Indian or
 Andaman Island tribes, will he be justified in concluding that
 mankind in the nineteenth century was 'just emerging from the
 Stone Age'?"
 </p><p>
 Another strange inconsistency in scientific knowledge is that
 <i>Neolithic </i>man is shown as being far more of a primitive
 savage than the Palaeolithic one. Either Lubbock's "Pre-historic
 Man," or Evans' "Ancient Stone Implements" must
 be at fault, or -- both. For this is what we learn from these
 works and others: --
 </p><p>
 (1) As we pass from Neolithic to Palaeolithic Man, the stone implements
 become, from gracefully shaped and polished instruments, rude
 lumbering makeshifts. Pottery, etc., disappear as we descend the
 scale. And yet the latter could engrave such a reindeer!
 </p><p>
 (2) Palaeolithic Man lived in caves which he shared with hyaenas
 and lions also,* whereas Neolithic man dwelt in lake-villages
 and buildings.
 </p><p>
 Every one who has followed even superficially the geological discoveries
 of our day, knows that a gradual improvement in workmanship is
 found, from the clumsy chipping and rude chopping of the early
 Palaeolithic <i>haches, </i>to the relatively graceful stone celts
 of that part of the Neolithic period immediately preceding the
 use of metals. But this <i>is in Europe, </i>a few portions only
 of which were barely rising from the waters in the days
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * In such a case Palaeolithic man must have been endowed in his
 day with thrice Herculean force and magic invulnerability, or
 else the lion was as weak as a lamb at that period, for both to
 share the same dwelling. We may as well be asked to believe next
 that it is that lion or hyaena which has engraved the deer on
 the antler, as be told that this bit of workmanship was done by
 a savage of such a kind.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 723 ENTRAPPED BY THE REINDEER.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of the highest Atlantean civilizations. There were rude savages
 and highly civilized people then, as there are now. If 50,000
 years hence, pigmy Bushmen are exhumed from some African cavern
 together with far earlier pigmy elephants, such as were found
 in the cave deposits of Malta by Milne Edwards, will that be a
 reason to maintain that in our age all men and all elephants were
 pigmies? Or if the weapons of the Veddhas of Ceylon are found,
 will our descendants be justified in setting us all down as Palaeolithic
 savages? All the articles which geologists now excavate in Europe
 can certainly never date earlier than from the close of the Eocene
 age, since the lands of Europe were not even above water before
 that period. Nor can what we have said be in the least invalidated
 by theorists telling us that these quaint sketches of animals
 and men by Palaeolithic man, were executed only <i>toward the
 close of the Reindeer period -- </i>for this explanation would
 be a very lame one indeed, in view of the geologists' ignorance
 of even the approximate duration of periods.
 </p><p>
 The Esoteric Doctrine teaches distinctly the <i>dogma </i>of the
 risings and falls of civilization; and now we learn that: "It
 is a remarkable fact that cannibalism seems to have become more
 frequent as man advanced in civilization, and that while its traces
 are frequent in <i>Neolithic </i>times they . . . . altogether
 disappear in the age of the mammoth and the reindeer." ("<i>Mod.
 Science and Mod. Thought,</i>"<i> </i>p. 164.)
 </p><p>
 Another evidence of the cyclic law and the truth of our teachings.
 Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out
 with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races
 of the latter (Chinamen, African negroes, &amp;c.) gradually brought
 the worship back. The Vedas countenance no idols; all the modern
 Hindu writings do.
 </p><p>
 "In the early Egyptian tombs, and in the remains of the pre-historic
 cities excavated by Dr. Schliemann, images of owl and ox-headed
 goddesses, and other symbolical figures, or idols, are found in
 abundance. But when we ascend into Neolithic times, such idols
 are no longer found . . . . the only ones which may be said with
 some certainty to have been idols are one or two discovered by
 M. de Braye in some artificial caves of the Neolithic period .
 . . which appear to be intended for female figures of life size"
 . . . . (p. 199 <i>Ibid.</i>)
 </p><p>
 And these may have been simply statues. Anyhow, all this is one
 among the many proofs of the cyclic rise and fall of civilization
 and religion. The fact that no traces of human relics or skeletons
 are so far found beyond post-tertiary or "Quaternary"
 times -- though Abbe Bourgeois' flints may serve as a warning*
 -- seems to point to the truth of another esoteric statement,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * More than twenty specimens of fossil monkeys have been found
 in one locality alone, in Miocene strata (Pikermi, near Athens).
 If man was not then, the period is [[Footnote continued on next

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 724 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 which runs thus: "Seek for the remains of thy forefathers
 in the high places. The vales have grown into mountains and the
 mountains have crumbled to the bottom of the seas." . . .
 Fourth Race mankind, thinned after the last cataclysm by two-thirds
 of its population, instead of settling on the new continents and
 islands that <i>reappeared </i>while their predecessors formed
 the floors of new Oceans -- deserted that which is now Europe
 and parts of Asia and Africa for the summits of gigantic mountains,
 the seas that surrounded some of the latter having since "retreated"
 and made room for the table lands of Central Asia.
 </p><p>
 The most interesting example of this progressive march is perhaps
 afforded by the celebrated Kent's Cavern at Torquay. In that strange
 recess, excavated by water out of the Devonian limestone, we find
 a most curious record preserved for us in the geological memoirs
 of the earth. Under the blocks of limestone, which heaped the
 floor of the cavern, were discovered, embedded in a deposit of
 black earth, many implements of the Neolithic period of <i>fairly
 excellent workmanship, </i>with<i> </i>a few fragments of pottery
 -- possibly traceable to the era of the Roman colonization. There
 is no trace of Palaeolithic man here. No flints or traces of the
 extinct animals of the Quaternary period. When, however, we penetrate
 still deeper through the dense layer of stalagmite beneath the
 mould into the red earth, which, of course, itself once formed
 the pavement of the retreat, things assume a very different aspect.
 <i>Not one implement fit to bear </i>comparison <i>with the finely-chipped
 weapons found in the overlying stratum is to be seen</i>;<i> </i>only
 a host of the rude and lumbering little hatchets (with which the
 monstrous giants of the animal world were subdued and killed by
 little man, we have to think?) and scrapers of the Palaeolithic
 age, mixed up confusedly with the bones of species now either
 extinct or emigrated, driven away by change of climate. It is
 the artificer of these ugly little hatchets, you see, who sculptured
 the reindeer over the brook, on the antler as shown above. In
 all cases we meet with the same evidence that, from historic to
 Neolithic and from Neolithic to Palaeolithic man, things slope
 downwards on an inclined plane from the rudiments of civilization
 to the most abject barbarism -- <i>in Europe</i> <i>again. </i>We
 are made also to face the "mammoth age" -- the extreme
 or earliest division of the Palaeolithic age -- in which the great
 rudeness of implements reaches its maximum, and the <i>brutal
 </i>(?) appearance of contemporary skulls, such as the Neanderthal,
 point to a very low type of Humanity. But they may sometimes point
 also to something besides; to a race of men quite distinct from
 our (Fifth Race) Humanity.

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 725 STRANGE CONFESSIONS OF SCIENCE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 As said by an anthropologist in "<i>Modern Thought</i>"<i>
 </i>(art. "The <i>Genesis of Man</i>"):<i> </i>"The
 theory, scientifically based or not, of Peyrere may be considered
 to be equivalent to that which divided man in two species. Broca,
 Virey, and a number of the French anthropologists have recognised
 that the lower race of man, comprising the Australian, Tasmanian,
 and Negro race, excluding the Kaffirs and the Northern Africans,
 <i>should be placed apart. </i>The fact that in this species,
 or rather sub-species, the third lower molars are usually larger
 than the second, and the squamosal and frontal bones are generally
 united by suture, places the<i> Homo Afer </i>on the level of
 being as good a distinct species as many of the kinds of finches.
 I shall abstain on the present occasion from mentioning the facts
 of hybridity, whereon the late Professor Broca has so exhaustively
 commented. The history, in the past ages of the world, of this
 race is peculiar. It has <i>never originated a system of architecture
 or a religion of its own</i>"<i> </i>(Dr. C. Carter Blake).
 It is peculiar, indeed, as we have shown in the case of the Tasmanians.
 However it may be, <i>fossil </i>man in Europe can neither prove
 nor disprove the antiquity of man on this Earth nor the age of
 his earliest civilizations.
 </p><p>
 It is time the Occultists should disregard any attempts to laugh
 at them, scorning the heavy guns of the satire of the men of science
 as much as the pop-guns of the profane, since it is impossible,
 so far, to obtain either proof or disproof, while their theories
 can stand the test better than the hypotheses of the Scientists
 at any rate. As to the proof for the antiquity which they claim
 for man, they have, moreover, Darwin himself and Lyell. The latter
 confesses that they (the naturalists) "have already obtained
 evidence of the existence of man at so remote a period that there
 has been time for many conspicuous mammalia, once his contemporaries,
 to die out, and <i>this even before the era of the earliest </i>historical
 records."* This is a statement made by one of England's great
 authorities upon the question. The two sentences that follow are
 as suggestive, and may well be remembered by the students of Occultism,
 for with all others he says: "In spite of the long lapse
 of prehistoric ages during which he (Man) must have flourished
 on Earth, <i>there is no proof of any perceptible change in his
 bodily structure. </i>If, therefore, he ever diverged from some
 unreasoning brute ancestor, we must suppose him to have existed
 at a far more distant epoch, <i>possibly on some continents or
 islands now submerged </i>beneath the Ocean."
 </p><p>
 Thus lost continents are officially suspected. That worlds (also
 Races) are periodically destroyed by fire (volcanoes and earthquakes)
 and water, in turn, and renewed, is a doctrine as old as man.
 Manu, Hermes, the Chaldees, all antiquity believed in this. Twice
 already

 <p>
 has the face of the globe been changed by fire, and twice by water,
 since man appeared on it. As land needs rest and renovation, new
 forces, and a change for its soil, so does water. Thence arises
 a periodical redistribution of land and water, change of climates,
 etc., all brought on by geological revolution, and ending in a
 final change in the axis. Astronomers may pooh-pooh the idea of
 a periodical change in the behaviour of the globe's axis, and
 smile at the conversation given in the Book of Enoch between Noah
 and his "grandfather" Enoch; the allegory is, nevertheless,
 a geological and an astronomical fact: there is a secular change
 in the inclination of the earth's axis, and its appointed time
 is recorded in one of the great Secret Cycles. As in many other
 questions, Science is gradually moving toward our way of thinking.
 Dr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S., F.G.S., writes in the <i>Popular Science
 Review </i>(New Series in Vol. I. p. 115), Art.: "Evidences
 of the Age of Ice." . . . . "If it be necessary to call
 in extramundane causes to explain the great increase of ice at
 this glacial period, I would prefer the theory propounded by Dr.
 Robert Hooke in 1688; since, by Sir Richard Phillips and others;
 and lastly by Mr. Thomas Belt, <strong>C.E</strong>., <strong>F.G.S</strong>.;
 namely, a slight increase in the present obliquity of the ecliptic,
 a proposal in perfect accord with other known astronomical facts,
 and the introduction of which is essential to our cosmical condition
 as a unit in the great solar system."
 </p><p>
 The following, quoted from a Lecture by W. Pengelly, <strong>F.R.S.</strong>,
 <strong>F.G.S</strong>., delivered in March, 1885, on "The
 extinct Lake of Bovey Tracey" shows the hesitation, in the
 face of every evidence in favour of Atlantis, to accept the fact.
 It is a quotation in the body of the Lecture: --
 </p><p>
 "Evergreen Figs, Laurels, Palms, and Ferns having gigantic
 rhizomes have their existing congeners <i>in a sub-tropical climate,
 such, it cannot be doubted, as prevailed in Devonshire in Miocene
 times, </i>and are thus calculated to suggest caution when the
 <i>present climate </i>of any district is regarded as normal.
 </p><p>
 "When, moreover, Miocene plants are found in Disco Island,
 on the west coast of Greenland, lying between 69[[degrees]] 20'
 and 70[[degrees]] 30' N. lat.; when we learn that among them were
 two species found also at Bovey (<i>Sequoia couttsiae, Quercus
 Lyelli</i>);<i> </i>when, to quote Professor Heer, we find that
 "the 'splendid evergreen' (<i>Magnolia Inglefieldi</i>)<i>
 </i>'ripened its fruits so far north as on the parallel of 70
 [[degrees]] ' "<i> </i>(<i>Phil. Trans. </i>clix., 457, 1869);
 when also the number, variety, and luxuriance of the Greenland
 Miocene plants are found to have been such that, had land continued
 so far, some of them would in all probability have flourished
 at the Pole itself, the problem of changes of climate is brought
 prominently into view, but only to be dismissed apparently with
 the feeling that the <i>time for its solution has not yet arrived.</i>
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 727 NO "MISSING LINK" ANYWHERE.
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 "It seems to be admitted on all hands that the Miocene plants
 of Europe have their nearest and most numerous existing analogues
 in North America, and hence arises the question; How was the migration
 from one area to the other effected? Was there, as some have believed,
 an Atlantis? -- a continent, or an archipelago of large islands,
 occupying the area of the North Atlantic. There is perhaps nothing
 unphilosophical in this hypothesis; for since, as geologists state,
 'the Alps have acquired 4,000, and even in some places more than
 10,000 feet of their present altitude since the commencement of
 the Eocene period' (Lyell's<i> Principles, </i>11th ed., p. 256,
 1872), a Post-Miocene (?) depression might have carried the hypothetical
 Atlantis into almost abysmal depths. But an Atlantis is apparently
 unnecessary and uncalled for. According to Professor Oliver, 'A
 close and very peculiar analogy subsists between the Flora of
 Tertiary Central Europe and the recent Floras of the American
 States and of the Japanese region; an analogy much closer and
 more intimate than is to be traced between the Tertiary and Recent
 Floras of Europe. We find the Tertiary element of the Old World
 to be intensified towards its extreme eastern margin. . . . This
 accession of the Tertiary element is rather gradual and not abruptly
 assumed in the Japan islands only. Although it there attains a
 maximum, we may trace it from the Mediterranean, Levant, Caucasus,
 and Persia . . . then along the Himalaya and through China. .
 . . We learn also that during the Tertiary epoch, counterparts
 of Central European Miocene genera certainly grew in North-West
 America. . . . We note further that the present Atlantic Islands'
 Flora affords no substantial evidence of a former direct communication
 with the mainland of the New World. . . . The consideration of
 these facts leads me to the opinion that botanical evidence does
 not favour the hypothesis of an Atlantis. On the other hand, it
 strongly favours the view that at some period of the Tertiary
 epoch North-Eastern Asia was united to North-western America,
 perhaps by the line where the Aleutian chain of islands now extends.'
 " (<i>Nat. Hist. Rev. </i>ii. 164, 1862.) See, however, "Scientific
 and Geological Proofs of the Reality of Several Submerged Continents."
 </p><p>
 But nothing short of a pithecoid man, will ever satisfy the luckless
 searchers after the thrice hypothetical "missing link."
 Yet, if beneath the vast floors of the Atlantic, from the Teneriffe
 Pic to Gibraltar, the ancient emplacement of the lost Atlantis,
 all the submarine strata were to be broken up miles deep, no such
 skull as would satisfy the Darwinists would be found. As Dr. C.
 R. Bree remarks ("<i>Fallacies of Darwinism</i>")<i>,
 </i>no missing links between man and ape having been discovered
 in various gravels and formations above the tertiaries, if they
 had gone down with the continents now covered with the sea, they

 <p>
 might still be found "in those beds of contemporary geological
 strata which have <i>not</i> gone down to the bottom of the sea."
 Yet they are as fatally absent from the latter as from the former.
 Were not preconceptions to fasten vampire-like on man's mind,
 the author of "<i>Antiquity of Man</i>"<i> </i>would
 have found a clue to the difficulty in that same work of his,
 by going ten pages back (530) and reading over a quotation of
 his own from Professor G. Rolleston's work. This physiologist,
 he says, suggests that as there is considerable plasticity in
 the human frame, not only in youth and during growth, but even
 in the adult, we ought not always to take for granted, as some
 advocates of the development theory seem to do, that each advance
 in physical power depends on an improvement in bodily structure,
 for why may not <i>the soul, or the higher intellectual and moral
 faculties play the first instead of the second part in a progressive
 scheme.</i> 
 </p><p>
 This hypothesis is made in relation to Evolution <i>not being
 entirely due to </i>"<i>natural selection</i>";<i> </i>but
 it applies as well to our case in hand. For we, too, claim that
 it is the "Soul," or the <i>inner</i> man, that descends
 on Earth first, the psychic <i>astral, </i>the mould on which
 physical man is gradually built -- his Spirit, intellectual and
 moral faculties awakening later on as that physical stature grows
 and develops.
 </p><p>
 "Thus incorporeal Spirits to smaller forms reduced their
 shapes immense," . . . and became the men of the Third and
 the Fourth Races. Still later, ages after, appeared the men of
 our Fifth Race, reduced from the still gigantic (in our modern
 sense) stature of their primeval ancestors, to about half of that
 size at present.
 </p><p>
 Man is certainly <i>no</i> special creation, and he is the product
 of Nature's gradual perfective work, like any other living unit
 on this Earth. But this is only with regard to the human tabernacle.
 That which lives and thinks in man and survives that frame, the
 masterpiece of evolution -- is the "Eternal Pilgrim,"
 the Protean differentiation in space and time of the One Absolute
 "unknowable."
 </p><p>
 In his "Antiquity of Man," Sir C. Lyell quotes -- perhaps
 in rather a mocking spirit -- what Hallam says (in Vol. iv., p.
 162) in his "<i>Introduction to the Literature of Europe</i>":<i>
 </i>--
 </p><blockquote>
 "If man was made in the image of God, he was also made in
 the image of an ape. The framework of the body of him who has
 weighed the stars and made the lightning his slave, approaches
 to that of a speechless brute who wanders in the forest of Sumatra.
 Thus standing on the frontier land between animal and angelic
 natures, what wonder that he should partake of both?"
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 An Occultist would have put it otherwise. He would say that man
 was indeed made in the image of a type projected by his progenitor,
 the creating <i>Angel-Force, </i>or Dhyan Chohan; while the wanderer
 of the forest of Sumatra was made <i>in the image of man, </i>since
 the frame-</p><hr>

 <p>
 work of the ape, we say again, is the revival, the resuscitation
 by abnormal means of the actual form of the Third-Round, and of
 the Fourth-Round <i>Man</i> as well, later on. Nothing is lost
 in nature, <i>not an atom</i>:<i> </i>this latter is at least
 certain on scientific data. Analogy would appear to demand that
 <i>form </i>should be equally endowed with permanency.
 </p><p>
 And yet what do we find: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "It is significant," says Sir W. Dawson, <strong>F.R.S.</strong>,
 "that Professor Huxley in his lectures in New York, while
 resting his case as to the lower animals, mainly on the supposed
 genealogy of the horse, which has often been shown to amount to
 no certain evidence, <i>avoided altogether the discussion of the
 origin of men from the apes, </i>now obviously complicated with
 so many difficulties that both Wallace and Mivart are staggered
 by them. Professor Thomas in his recent lectures ('Nature,' 1876),
 admits that there is no lower man known than the Australian, and
 that there is no known link of connection with the monkeys; and
 that Haeckel has to admit that the penultimate link in his phylogeny,
 the ape-like man, <i>is absolutely unknown </i>('<i>History of
 Creation.</i>') .<i> </i>. . . The so-called '<i>tallies</i>'<i>
 </i>found with the bones of Palaeocosmic men in European caves,
 and illustrated in the admirable works of Christy and Lartet,
 show that the <i>rudiments even of writings were already in possession
 </i>of the oldest race of men known to archaeology or geology."
 (See Wilson's "<i>Prehistoric Man,</i>"<i> op. cit.,
 </i>vol. ii., p. 54. "<i>Origin of the World,</i>"<i>
 </i>p. 393.)

 <p>
 Again in Dr. C. R. Bree's "<i>Fallacies of Darwinism,</i>"<i>
 </i>on page 160, we read: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Mr. Darwin justly says that the difference physically and,
 more especially mentally, between the lowest form of man and the
 highest anthropomorphous ape, is enormous. Therefore, <i>the time
 -- </i>which in Darwinian evolution must be almost inconceivably
 slow -- must have been <i>enormous </i>also during man's development
 from the monkey.* The chance, therefore, of some of these variations
 being found in the different gravels or fresh-water formations
 above the tertiaries, must be very great. And yet <i>not one single
 variation, not one single specimen of a </i>being between a monkey
 and a man has ever been found. Neither in the gravel, nor the
 drift-clay, nor the fresh-water beds, nor in the tertiaries below
 them has there ever been discovered the remains of any member
 of the missing families between the monkey and the man, as <i>assumed
 </i>to have existed by Mr. Darwin. Have they gone down with the
 depression of the earth's surface and are they now covered with
 the sea? If so, it is beyond all probability that they should
 not, also be found in those beds of contemporary geological strata
 which have <i>not</i> gone down to the bottom of the sea; still
 more improbable that some portions should not be dredged from
 the ocean bed like the remains of the mammoth and the rhinoceros
 which are also found in fresh-water beds and gravels and drift!
 . . . . . . the celebrated Neanderthal skull, about which so much
 has been said, belongs confessedly to this remote epoch (bronze
 and stone ages), and yet presents, although it may have been the
 skull of an idiot, immense differences from the highest known
 anthropomorphous ape."

 Our globe being convulsed each time that it <i>reawakens </i>for
 a new period of activity, like a field which has to be ploughed
 and furrowed before fresh seed for its new crop is thrown into
 it -- it does seem quite hopeless that fossils belonging to its
 previous Rounds should be found in the beds of either its oldest
 or its latest geological strata. Every new Manvantara brings along
 with it the renovation of forms, types and species; every type
 of the preceding organic forms -- vegetable, animal and human
 -- changes and is perfected in the next, even to the mineral,
 which has received in this Round its final opacity and hardness;
 its softer portions having formed the present vegetation; the
 astral relics of previous vegetation and fauna having been utilized
 in the formation of the lower animals, and determining the structure
 of the primeval Root-Types of the highest mammalia. And, finally,
 the form of the gigantic Ape-Man of the former Round has been
 reproduced in this one by human bestiality and transfigured into
 the <i>parent </i>form in the modern Anthropoid.

 This doctrine, even imperfectly delineated as it is under our
 inefficient pen, is assuredly more logical, more consistent with
 facts, and <i>far more </i>probable than many "scientific"
 theories; that, for instance, of the first organic germ descending
 on a meteor to our Earth -- like Ain Soph on his Vehicle, Adam
 Kadmon. Only, the latter descent is allegorical, as every one
 knows, and the Kabalists have never offered this figure of speech
 for acceptance in its dead-letter garb. But the germ on the meteor
 theory, as coming from such high scientific quarters, is an eligible
 candidate for axiomatic truth and law, a theory people are in
 honour bound to accept, if they would be on a right level with
 modern Science. What the next theory necessitated by the materialistic
 premises will be -- no one can tell. Meanwhile, the <i>present
 </i>theories, as any one can see, clash together far more discordantly
 among themselves than even those of the Occultists outside the
 <i>sacred </i>precincts of learning. For what is there, next in
 order, now that exact Science has made even of the Life-principle
 an empty word, a meaningless term; and now insists that life is
 an effect <i>due to the molecular action of the primordial protoplasm!
 </i>The new doctrine of the Darwinists may be defined and summarized
 in a few words, in which Mr. Herbert Spencer has defined "special
 creation" . . . "it is worthless. Worthless, by its
 derivation; worthless, in its intrinsic incoherence; worthless,
 as absolutely without evidence; worthless, as not supplying an
 intellectual need; worthless, as not satisfying a moral want.
 We must, therefore, <i>consider it as counting for nothing in
 opposition to any other hypothesis respecting the origin of organic
 beings.</i>"<i> </i>(<i>Principles of Biology, Vol. I.,</i>
