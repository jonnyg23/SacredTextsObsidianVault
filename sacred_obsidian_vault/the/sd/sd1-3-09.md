 THE SOLAR THEORY.</h4>
 
 <p>
 A SHORT ANALYSIS OF THE COMPOUND AND SINGLE ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE
 AS AGAINST THE OCCULT TEACHINGS. HOW FAR SCIENTIFIC IS THIS THEORY,
 AS GENERALLY ACCEPTED.
 </p><p>
 <strong>I</strong>N his reply to Dr. Gull's attack on the theory
 of vitality (connected inseparably with the Elements of the ancients
 in the Occult philosophy), Professor Beale, the great physiologist,
 has a few words as suggestive as they are beautiful: --
 </p><p>
 "There is a mystery in life -- a mystery which has never
 been fathomed, and which appears greater, the more deeply the
 phenomena of life are studied and contemplated. In living centres
 -- far more central than the centres seen by the highest magnifying
 powers, in centres of living matter, where the eye cannot penetrate,
 but towards which the understanding may tend -- proceed changes
 of the nature of which the most advanced physicists and chemists
 fail to afford us the conception: <em>nor is there the slightest
 reason to think that the nature of these changes will ever be
 ascertained by physical investigation</em>,<em> </em>inasmuch
 as they are certainly of an order or nature <em>totally distinct
 </em>from that to which any other phenomenon known to us can be
 relegated."
 </p><p>
 This "mystery," or the origin of the LIFE ESSENCE, Occultism
 locates in the same centre as the nucleus of <em>prima materia
 </em>(for they are one) of our Solar system.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 541 THE HEART OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "<em>The Sun is the heart of the Solar World (System) and
 its brain is hidden behind the </em>(<em>visible</em>)<em> Sun.
 From thence</em>,<em> sensation is radiated into every nerve</em>-<em>centre
 of the great body</em>,<em> and the waves of the life</em>-<em>essence
 flow into each artery and vein</em>. . . . <em>The planets are
 its limbs and pulses. . . ." (Commentary.)</em> 
 </p><p>
 It was stated elsewhere (<em>in the Theosophist</em>)<em> </em>that
 Occult philosophy denies that the Sun is a globe in combustion,
 but defines it simply as a world, a glowing sphere, the <em>real
 </em>Sun being hidden behind, and the visible being only its reflection,
 its <em>shell. </em>The Nasmyth willow leaves, mistaken by Sir
 J. Herschell for "Solar inhabitants," are the reservoirs
 of solar vital energy, "the vital electricity that feeds
 the whole system. . . . . The Sun <em>in abscondito </em>being
 thus the storehouse of our little Kosmos, self-generating its
 vital fluid, and ever receiving as much as it gives out,"
 and the <em>visible </em>Sun only a <em>window cut into the real
 </em>Solar palace and presence, which reflects, however, faithfully
 the interior work.
 </p><p>
 Thus, there is a regular circulation of the vital fluid throughout
 our system, of which the Sun is the heart -- the same as the circulation
 of the blood in the human body -- during the manvantaric solar
 period, or life; the Sun contracting as rhythmically at every
 return of it, as the human heart does. Only, instead of performing
 the round in a second or so, it takes the solar blood ten of its
 years, and a whole year to pass through its <em>auricles </em>and<em>
 ventricles </em>before it washes the <em>lungs </em>and passes
 thence to the great veins and arteries of the system.
 </p><p>
 This, Science will not deny, since Astronomy knows of the fixed
 cycle of eleven years when the number of solar spots increases,*
 <em>which is due to the contraction </em>of the Solar HEART. The
 universe (our world in this case) breathes, just as man and every
 living creature, plant, and even mineral does upon the earth;
 and as our globe itself breathes every twenty-four hours. The
 dark region is <em>not </em>due "to the absorption exerted
 by the vapours issuing from the bosom of the sun and interposed
 between the observer and the photosphere," as Father Secchi
 would have it ("<em>Le Soleil</em>"<em> II.</em>,<em>
 </em>184), nor are the spots formed "by the matter (heated
 gaseous matter) which the irruption projects upon the solar disc"
 (<em>ibid</em>)<em>. </em>It is similar to the regular and healthy
 pulsation of the heart, as the life fluid passes through its hollow
 muscles. Could the human heart be made luminous, and the living
 and throbbing organ be made visible, so as to have it reflected
 upon a screen, such as
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Not only does it not deny the occurrence, though attributing
 it to a wrong cause, as always, each theory contradicting every
 other, (<em>see the theories of Secchi</em>,<em> of Faye</em>,<em>
 and of Young</em>),<em> </em>the spots depending on the superficial
 accumulation of vapours cooler than the photosphere (?), etc.,
 etc., but we have men of science who <em>astrologize </em>upon
 the spots. Professor Jevons attributes all the great periodical
 commercial crises to the influence of the Sun spots every eleventh
 cyclic year. (<em>See his </em>"<em>Investigations into Currency
 and Finance.</em>")<em> </em>This is worthy of praise and
 encouragement surely.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 542 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 used by the astronomers in their lectures -- say for the moon
 -- then every one would see the Sun-spot phenomenon repeated every
 second -- due to its contraction and the rushing of the blood.
 </p><p>
 It is said in a work on Geology that it is the <em>dream of Science
 </em>that "all the recognized chemical elements will one
 day be found <em>but modifications of a single material element.</em>"<em>
 </em>("<em>World</em>-<em>Life</em>,"<em> p. </em>48.)
 </p><p>
 Occult philosophy has taught this since the existence of human
 speech and languages, adding only, on the principle of the immutable
 law of analogy -- "as it is above, so it is below" --
 that other axiom, that there is neither Spirit nor matter, in
 reality, but only numberless aspects of the One ever-hidden IS
 (or <em>Sat</em>)<em>. </em>The homogeneous primordial Element
 is <em>simple </em>and<em> single only on the terrestrial plane
 </em>of consciousness and sensation, since matter, after all,
 is nothing else than the sequence of our own states of consciousness,
 and Spirit an idea of psychic intuition. Even on the next higher
 plane, that <em>single element </em>which is defined on our earth
 by current science, as the ultimate undecomposable constituent
 of some kind of matter, would be pronounced in the world of a
 higher spiritual perception as something very complex indeed.
 Our purest water would be found to yield, instead of its two declared
 <em>simple </em>elements of oxygen and hydrogen, many other constituents,
 undreamt of by our terrestrial modern chemistry. As in the realm
 of matter, so in the realm of Spirit, the shadow of that which
 is cognized on the plane of objectivity exists on that of pure
 subjectivity. The speck of the perfectly homogeneous substance,
 the sarcode of the Haeckelian <em>monera</em>,<em> </em>is now
 viewed as the <em>archebiosis </em>of terrestrial existence (Mr.
 Huxley's "protoplasm")*; and <em>Bathybius Haeckelii
 </em>has to be traced to its <i>pre</i>-terrestrial archebiosis.
 This is first perceived by the astronomers at its third stage
 of evolution, and in the "secondary creation," so-called.
 But the students of Esoteric philosophy understand too well the
 secret meaning of the stanza: "Brahma has essentially the
 <em>aspect of </em>prakriti, both evolved and unevolved . . .
 . Spirit, O twice-born, (Initiate) is the leading <em>aspect </em>of
 Brahma. The next is a two-fold aspect -- of Prakriti and Purusha,
 both evolved and unevolved; and <em>time </em>is the last! <em>Anu
 </em>is one of the names of Brahma (as distinct from Brahma neuter),
 and it means "atom": Aniyamsam aniyasam, "the most
 atomic of the atomic," the "immutable and imperishable
 (achyuta) Purushottama."
 </p><p>
 Surely, then, the elements now known to us -- be their number
 whatever it may -- as they are understood and defined at present,
 are not,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Unfortunately, as these pages are being written the "<em>archebiosis
 </em>of terrestrial existence" has turned, under a somewhat
 stricter chemical analysis, into a simple precipitate of sulphate
 of lime -- hence from the scientific standpoint not even an <em>organic
 </em>substance!!! <em>Sic transit gloria mundi!</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 543 THE QUINTESSENCE OF KOSMOS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 nor can they be, the <em>primordial </em>elements. Those were
 formed from "<em>the</em> <em>curds of the cold radiant mother</em>"<em>
 </em>and "the <em>fire</em>-<em>seed </em>of the hot Father"
 who "<em>are one</em>,"<em> </em>or, to express it in
 the plainer language of modern science, those elements had their
 genesis in the depths of the primordial fire-mist -- the masses
 of incandescent vapour of the <em>irresolvable </em>nebulae; for
 as Professor Newcomb shows (in his "<em>Popular Astronomy</em>,"<em>
 </em>on page 444), <em>resolvable </em>nebulae are not a class
 of proper nebulae.
 </p><p>
 More than half of those which were at first mistaken for nebulae
 -- he thinks -- are what he calls "starry clusters."
 The elements now known, have arrived at their state of permanency
 in this 4th Round and 5th Race. They have a short period of rest
 before they are propelled once more on their upward spiritual
 evolution; when the "living fire of Orcus" will dissociate
 the most irresolvable and scatter them into the primordial ONE
 -- again.
 </p><p>
 Meanwhile the Occultist goes further, as has been shown in the
 Commentaries on the Seven Stanzas. Hence he can hardly hope for
 any help or recognition from science, which will reject both his
 "aniyamsam aniyasam" (the absolutely spiritual atom)
 and his Manasaputras -- "mind-born men." By resolving
 the "single material element" into one absolute <em>irresolvable
 </em>element -- Spirit, or "Root-matter," thus placing
 it at once outside the reach and province of physical philosophy
 -- he has, of course but little in common with the orthodox men
 of science. He maintains that Spirit and Matter are two FACETS
 of the unknowable UNITY, their apparently contrasted aspects depending,
 (<em>a</em>) on the various degrees of differentiation of the
 latter, and (<em>b</em>) on the grades of consciousness attained
 by man himself. This is, however, metaphysics, and has little
 to do with physics -- however great in its own terrestrial limitation
 that physical <em>philosophy </em>may now be.
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, once that Science admits, if not the actual existence,
 at any rate, the possibility of the existence, of a Universe with
 its numberless forms, conditions, and aspects built out of a "single
 Substance,"* it has
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * In his "World-Life" -- page 48 -- in the appended
 foot notes, Professor Winchell says: -- "It is generally
 admitted that at excessively high temperatures matter exists in
 a state of dissociation -- that is, no chemical combination can
 exist;" and would appeal, to prove the unity of matter, to
 the spectrum, which in every case of homogeneity will show a <em>bright
 </em>line, whereas in the case of several molecular arrangements
 existing -- in the nebulae say, or a star -- "the spectrum
 should consist of two or three bright lines!" This would
 be no proof either way to the physicist-Occultist, who maintains
 that beyond a certain limit of <em>visible </em>matter, no spectrum,
 no telescope and no microscope are of any use. The unity of matter,
 of that which is real cosmic matter to the Alchemist, or "Adam's
 Earth" as the Kabalists call it, can hardly be proved or
 disproved, by either the French <em>savant</em> Dumas, who suggests
 "the composite nature of the "elements" on certain
 relations of atomic weights," or even by Mr. Crookes's "radiant
 matter," though his experiments may seem [[Footnote continued
 on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 544 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 to go further. Unless it also admits the possibility of One Element,
 or the ONE LIFE of the Occultists. It will have to hang up that
 "single substance," especially if limited to only the
 solar nebulae, like the coffin of Mahomet, in mid air, though
 minus the attractive magnet that sustains that coffin. Fortunately
 for the speculative physicists, if unable to state with any degree
 of precision what the nebular theory <em>does </em>imply, we have,
 thanks to Professor Winchell, and several disagreeing astronomers,
 been able to learn what <em>it does not </em>imply<em>.</em>*<em>
 </em>(<em>Vide Supra.</em>)
 </p><p>
 Unfortunately, this is far from clearing even the most simple
 of the problems that have vexed, and still do vex, the men of
 learning in their research after truth. We have to proceed with
 our inquiries, starting with the earliest hypotheses of modern
 science, if we would discover <em>where</em> and <em>why</em>
 it sins. Perchance it may be found that Stallo is right, after
 all. That the blunders, contradictions, and fallacies made by
 the most eminent men of learning are simply due to their abnormal
 attitude. They are, and want to remain materialistic <em>quand
 meme</em>,<em> </em>and yet "the general principles of the
 atomo-mechanical theory -- the basis of modern physics -- are<em>
 substantially identical </em>with the cardinal doctrines of ontological
 metaphysics." Thus, "the fundamental errors of ontology
 become apparent in proportion to the advance of physical Science."
 (Int. p. VI., "Concepts of Modern Physics.") Science
 is honeycombed with metaphysical conceptions, but the Scientists
 will not admit the charge and fight desperately to put atomo-mechanical
 masks on purely incorporeal and spiritual laws in nature, on our
 plane -- refusing to admit their substantiality even on other
 planes, the bare existence of which they reject <em>a priori.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 It is easy to show, however, how Scientists, wedded to their materialistic
 views, have endeavoured, ever since the day of Newton, to put
 false masks on fact and truth. But their task is becoming with
 every year more difficult; and with every year also, Chemistry,
 above all the other sciences, approaches nearer and nearer the
 realm of the Occult in nature. It is assimilating the very truths
 taught by the Occult Sciences
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] "to be best understood
 on the hypothesis of the homogeneity of the elements of matter,
 and the continuity of the states of matter." For all this
 does not go beyond MATERIAL matter, so to say, even in what is
 shown by the <em>spectrum</em>,<em> </em>that modern "eye
 of Siva" of physical experiments. It is of this matter only,
 that H. St. Claire Deville could say that "when bodies, deemed
 to be simple, combine with one another, they vanish, they are
 <em>individually annihilated</em>"<em>; </em>simply because
 he could not follow those bodies in their further transformation
 in the world of <em>spiritual </em>cosmic matter. Verily modern
 science will never be able to dig deep enough into the cosmological
 formations to find the <em>roots </em>of the world-stuff or matter,
 unless she works on the same lines of thought as the medieval
 alchemist did.

 for ages, but hitherto bitterly derided. "Matter is eternal,"
 says the Esoteric Doctrine. But the matter the Occultists conceive
 of in its <em>laya</em>,<em> </em>or<em> zero state</em>,<em>
 </em>is not the matter of modern science; not even in its most
 rarefied gaseous state. Mr. Crookes' "radiant matter"
 would appear matter of the grossest kind in the realm of the beginnings,
 as it becomes pure spirit before it has returned back even to
 its first point of differentiation. Therefore, when the adept
 or alchemist adds that, though matter is eternal, for it is <b>P</b>RADHANA,
 yet atoms <em>are born at every new manvantara</em>,<em> </em>or
 reconstruction of the universe, it is no such contradiction as
 a materialist, who believes in nothing beyond the atom, might
 think. There is a difference between <em>manifested </em>and<em>
 unmanifested </em>matter, between <em>pradhana</em>,<em> </em>the
 beginningless and endless cause, and <em>prakriti</em>,<em> </em>or
 the manifested effect. Says the sloka; --
 </p><p>
 "That which is the unevolved cause is emphatically called
 by the most eminent sages, <em>pradhana</em>,<em> original base</em>,<em>
 which is </em>subtile<em> prakriti</em>,<em> viz.</em>,<em> </em>that
 which is eternal, and which at once is, and is not, <em>a mere
 process.</em>"*
 </p><p>
 That which in modern phraseology is respectively referred to as
 Spirit and Matter, is ONE in eternity as the perpetual cause,
 and it is neither Spirit nor matter, but IT -- rendered in Sanskrit
 TAD ("that"), -- all that is, was, or will be, all that
 the imagination of man is capable of conceiving. Even the exoteric
 Pantheism of Hinduism renders it as no monotheistic philosophy
 ever did, for in superb phraseology its cosmogony begins with
 the well-known words: --
 </p><p>
 "There was neither day nor night, neither heaven nor earth,
 neither darkness nor light. And there was not ought else apprehensible
 by the senses or by the mental faculties. There was then one Brahma,
 essentially<em> prakriti </em>(Nature) and Spirit. For <em>the
 two aspects </em>of Vishnu which are other than his supreme essential
 aspect are prakriti and Spirit, and Brahman. <em>When these two
 other </em>ASPECTS<em> of his no longer subsist</em>,<em> but
 are dissolved</em>,<em> </em>then that aspect whence form and
 the rest, <em>i.e.</em>,<em> creation</em>,<em> </em>proceed <em>anew</em>,<em>
 </em>is denominated time, O twice-born."
 </p><p>
 It is that which is dissolved, or the illusionary <em>dual</em>
 aspect of That, the essence of which is eternally ONE, that we
 call eternal matter or Substance (Vide in Part II<em>.</em>,<em>
 </em>"<em>Primordial Substance and Divine Thought</em>"),<em>
 </em>formless, sexless, inconceivable, even to our <em>sixth </em>sense
 or mind,** in which, therefore, we refuse to see that which Monotheists
 call a <em>personal</em>,<em> </em>anthropomorphic God.
 </p><p>
 How are these two propositions -- "that matter is eternal,"
 and "the atom periodical, and not eternal" -- viewed
 by modern exact Science? The materialistic physicist will criticize
 and laugh them to scorn. The

 <p>
 liberal and progressive man of Science, however, the true and
 earnest scientific searcher after truth -- <em>e.g</em>., the
 eminent chemist, Mr. Crookes, will corroborate the <em>probability
 </em>of the two statements. For, hardly has the echo of his lecture
 on the "Genesis of the Elements" died away --the lecture
 which, delivered by him before the Chemical Section of the British
 Association, at the last Birmingham meeting, so startled every
 evolutionist who heard or read it -- than there came another one
 in March last, 1888. Once more the President of the Chemical Society
 brings before the world of Science and the public the fruits of
 some new discoveries in the realm of atoms, and these discoveries
 justify the occult teachings in every way. They are more startling
 even than the statements made by him in the first lecture (quoted
 later) and deserve well the attention of every Occultist, Theosophist,
 and Metaphysician. This is what he says in his "Elements
 and <em>Meta</em>-Elements," thus justifying Stallo's charges
 and prevision with the fearlessness of a scientific mind which
 loves science for truth's sake, regardless of any consequences
 to his own glory and reputation. We quote his own words:
 </p><blockquote>
 Permit me, gentlemen, now to draw your attention for a short time
 to a subject which concerns the fundamental principles of chemistry,
 a subject which may lead us to admit the possible existence of
 bodies which, though neither compounds nor mixtures, are not elements
 in the strictest sense of the word -- bodies which I venture to
 call "meta-elements." To explain my meaning it is necessary
 for me to revert to our conception of an element. What is the
 criterion of an element? Where are we to draw the line between
 distinct existence and identity? No one doubts that oxygen, sodium,
 chlorine, sulphur are separate elements; and when we come to such
 groups as chlorine, bromine, iodine, &amp;c., we still feel no
 doubt, although were degrees of "elementicity" admissible
 -- and to that we may ultimately have to come -- it might be allowed
 that chlorine approximates much more closely to bromine than to
 oxygen, sodium, or sulphur. Again, nickel and cobalt are near
 to each other, very near, though no one questions their claim
 to rank as distinct elements. Still I cannot help asking what
 would have been the prevalent opinion among chemists had the respective
 solutions of these bodies and their compounds presented identical
 colours, instead of colours which, approximately speaking, are
 mutually complementary. Would their distinct nature have even
 now been recognised? When we pass further and come to the so-called
 rare earths the ground is less secure under our feet. Perhaps
 we may admit scandium, ytterbium, and others of the like sort
 to elemental rank; but what are we to say in the case of praseo-
 and neo-dymium, between which there may be said to exist no well-marked
 chemical difference, their chief claim to separate individuality
 being slight differences in basicity and crystallizing powers,
 though their physical distinctions, as shown by spectrum observations,
 are very strongly marked? Even here we may imagine the disposition
 of the majority of chemists would incline toward the side of leniency,
 so that they would admit these two bodies within the charmed circle.
 Whether in so doing they would be able to appeal to any broad
 principle is an open question. If we admit these candidates 
 </blockquote>
 <hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 547 OCCULT CHEMISTRY.</h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 how in justice are we to exclude the series of elemental bodies
 or meta-elements made known to us by Kruss and Nilson? Here the
 spectral differences are well marked, while my own researches
 on didymium show also a slight difference in basicity between
 some at least of these doubtful bodies. In the same category must
 be included the numerous separate bodies into which it is probable
 that yttrium, erbium, samarium, and other "elements"
 -- commonly so-called -- have been and are being split up. Where
 then are we to draw the line? The different groupings shade off
 so imperceptibly the one into the other that it is impossible
 to erect a definite boundary between any two adjacent bodies and
 to say that the body on this side of the line is an element, while
 the one on the other side is non-elementary, or merely something
 which simulates or approximates to an element. Wherever an apparently
 reasonable line might be drawn it would no doubt be easy at once
 to assign most bodies to their proper side, as in all cases of
 classification the real difficulty comes in when the border-line
 is approached. Slight chemical differences, of course, are admitted,
 and, up to a certain point, so are well-marked physical differences.
 What are we to say, however, when the only chemical difference
 is an almost imperceptible tendency for the one body -- of a couple
 or of a group -- to precipitate before the other? Again, there
 are cases where the chemical differences reach the vanishing point,
 although well-marked physical differences still remain. Here we
 stumble on a new difficulty: in such obscurities what is chemical
 and what is physical? Are we not entitled to call a slight tendency
 of a nascent amorphous precipitate to fall down in advance of
 another a "physical difference?" And may we not call
 coloured reactions depending on the amount of some particular
 acid present and varying, according to the concentration of the
 solution and to the solvent employed, "chemical differences?"
 I do not see how we can deny elementary character to a body which
 differs from another by well-marked colour, or spectrum-reactions,
 while we accord it to another body whose only claim is a very
 minute difference in basic powers. Having once opened the door
 wide enough to admit some spectrum differences, we have to inquire
 how minute a difference qualifies the candidate to pass? I will
 give instances from my own experience of some of these doubtful
 candidates.
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 And here the great chemist gives several cases of the very extraordinary
 behaviour of molecules and earths, apparently the same, and which
 yet, when examined very closely, were found to exhibit differences
 which, however imperceptible, still show that none of them are
 <em>simple </em>bodies, and that the 60 or 70 elements accepted
 in chemistry, can no longer cover the ground. Their name, apparently,
 is legion, but as the so-called "periodic theory" stands
 in the way of an unlimited multiplication of elements, Mr. Crookes
 is obliged to find some means of reconciling the new discovery
 with the old theory. "That theory," he says: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Has received such abundant verification that we cannot lightly
 accept any interpretation of phenomena which fails to be in accordance
 with it. But if we suppose the elements reinforced by a vast number
 of bodies slightly differing from each other in their properties,
 and forming, if I may use the expression, 
 </blockquote>
 <hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 548 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 aggregations of nebulae where we formerly saw, or believed we
 saw, separate stars, the periodic arrangement can no longer be
 definitely grasped. No longer, that is, if we retain our usual
 conception of an element. Let us, then, modify this conception.
 For "element" read "elementary group" -- such
 elementary groups taking the place of the old elements in the
 periodic scheme -- and the difficulty falls away. In defining
 an element, let us take not an external boundary, but an internal
 type. Let us say, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>the smallest ponderable
 quantity of yttrium is an assemblage of ultimate atoms almost
 infinitely more like each other than they are to the atoms of
 any other approximating element. It does not necessarily follow
 that the atoms shall all be absolutely alike among themselves.
 The atomic weight which we ascribed to yttrium, therefore, merely
 represents a mean value around which the actual weights of the
 individual atoms of the "element" range within certain
 limits. But if my conjecture is tenable, could we separate atom
 from atom, we should find them varying within narrow limits on
 each side of the mean. The very process of fractionation implies
 the existence of such differences in certain bodies."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Thus fact and truth have once more forced the hand of "exact"
 Science, and compelled it to enlarge its views and change its
 terms which, masking the multitude, reduced them to one body --
 like the Septenary Elohim and their hosts transformed by the materialistic
 religionists into one Jehovah. Replace the chemical terms "Molecule,"
 "atom," "particle," etc., by the words "Hosts,"
 "Monads," "Devas," etc., and one might think
 the genesis of gods, the primeval evolution of manvantaric <i>intelligent
 </i>Forces, was being described. But the learned lecturer adds
 something still more suggestive to his descriptive remarks; whether
 consciously or unconsciously, who knoweth? For he says the following:
 --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Until lately such bodies passed muster as elements. They
 had definite properties, chemical and physical; they had recognised
 atomic weights. If we take a pure dilute solution of such a body,
 yttrium for instance, and if we add to it an excess of strong
 ammonia, we obtain a precipitate which appears perfectly homogeneous.
 But if instead we add very dilute ammonia in quantity sufficient
 only to precipitate one-half of the base present, we obtain no
 immediate precipitate. If we stir up the whole thoroughly so as
 to insure a uniform mixture of the solution and the ammonia, and
 set the vessel aside for an hour, carefully excluding dust, we
 may still find the liquid clear and bright, without any vestige
 of turbidity. After three or four hours, however, an opalescence
 will declare itself, and the next morning a precipitate will have
 appeared. Now let us ask ourselves, What can be the meaning of
 this phenomenon? The quantity of precipitant added was insufficient
 to throw down more than half the yttria present, therefore a process
 akin to selection has been going on for several hours. The precipitation
 has <i>evidently not been effected at random</i>,<i> </i>those
 molecules of the base being decomposed which happened to come
 in contact with a corresponding molecule of ammonia, for we have
 taken care that the liquids should be uniformly mixed, so that
 one molecule of the original salt would not be more exposed to
 decomposition 
 </blockquote>
 <hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 549 MONADS AND ATOMS.</h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 than any other. If, further, we consider the time which elapses
 before the appearance of a precipitate, we <i>cannot avoid coming
 to the conclusion that the action which has been going on for
 the first few hours is of a selective character</i>. The problem
 is not why a precipitate is produced, but what determines or directs
 some atoms to fall down and others to remain in solution. Out
 of the multitude of atoms present, <i>what power is it that directs
 each atom to choose the proper path? We may picture to ourselves
 some directive force passing the atoms one by one in review, selecting
 one for precipitation and another for solution till all have been
 adjusted</i>."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 The italics in the above passage are ours. Well may a man of science
 ask himself, "What power is it that directs each atom,"
 and what is it that its character should be <em>selective? </em>Theists
 would solve the question by answering "God"; and would
 solve nothing philosophically. Occultism answers on its own pantheistic
 grounds, and refers the reader to a subsequent section, "<em>Gods</em>,<em>
 Monads</em>,<em> and Atoms.</em>"<em> </em>The learned lecturer
 sees in it that which is his chief concern: the finger-posts and
 the traces of a path which may lead to the discovery, and the
 full and complete demonstration of an homogeneous element in nature.
 He remarks: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "In order that such a selection can be effected there evidently
 must be some slight differences between which it is possible to
 select, and this difference almost certainly must be one of basicity,
 so slight as to be imperceptible by any test at present known,
 but susceptible of being nursed and encouraged to a point when
 the difference can be appreciated by ordinary tests."
 </blockquote>

 Occultism, which knows of the existence and presence in Nature
 of the One eternal element at the first differentiation of which
 the roots of the tree of life are periodically struck, needs no
 scientific proofs. It says: -- Ancient Wisdom has solved the problem
 ages ago. Aye; earnest, as well as mocking reader, Science is
 slowly but as surely approaching our domains of the Occult. It
 is forced by its own discoveries to adopt <em>nolens volens </em>our
 phraseology and symbols. Chemical Science is now compelled, by
 the very force of things, to accept even our illustration of the
 evolution of the gods and atoms, so suggestively and undeniably
 figured in the caduceus of Mercury, the God of Wisdom, and in
 the allegorical language of the Archaic Sages. Says a commentary
 in the esoteric doctrine: --
 </p><p>
 . . . . <em>The trunk of the</em> <strong>A</strong>SVATTHA<em>
 </em>(<em>the tree of Life and Being</em>,<em> the </em>ROD <em>of
 the caduceus</em>)<em> grows from and descends at every Beginning
 </em>(<em>every new manvantara</em>)<em> from the two dark wings
 of the Swan </em>(<strong>H</strong>ANSA)<em> of Life. The two
 Serpents</em>,<em> the ever</em>-<em>living and its illusion </em>(<em>Spirit
 and matter</em>)<em> whose two heads grow from the one head between
 the wings</em>,<em> descend along the trunk</em>,<em> interlaced
 in close embrace. The two tails join on earth </em>(<em>the manifested
 Universe</em>)<em> into one</em>,<em> and this is the great illusion</em>,<em>
 O Lanoo!</em>" </p><hr>

 Every one knows what the caduceus is, already modified by the
 Greeks. The original symbol -- with the triple head of the serpent
 -- became altered into a rod with a knob, and the two lower heads
 were separated, thus disfiguring somewhat the original meaning.
 Yet it is as good an illustration as can be for our purpose, this
 laya rod entwined by two serpents. Verily the wonderful powers
 of the magic caduceus were sung by all the ancient poets, with
 a very good reason for those who understood the secret meaning.

 Now what says the learned President of the Chemical Society of
 Great Britain, in that same lecture, which has any reference to,
 or bearing upon, our above-mentioned doctrine. Very little; only
 this -- and nothing more: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "In the Birmingham address already referred to I asked my
 audience to picture the action of two forces on the original protyle
 --- one being time, accompanied by a lowering of temperature;
 the other, swinging to and fro like a mighty pendulum, having
 periodic cycles of ebb and swell, rest and activity, being intimately
 connected with the imponderable matter, essence, or source of
 energy we call electricity. Now, a simile like this effects its
 object if it fixes in the mind the particular fact it is intended
 to emphasize, but it must not be expected necessarily to run parallel
 with all the facts. Besides the lowering of temperature with the
 periodic ebb and flow of electricity, positive or negative, requisite
 to confer on the newly-born elements their particular atomicity,
 it is evident that a third factor must be taken into account.
 Nature does not act on a flat plane; she demands space for her
 cosmogenic operations, and if we introduce space as the third
 factor, all appears clear. Instead of a pendulum, which, though
 to a certain extent a good illustration, is impossible as a fact,
 let us seek some more satisfactory way of representing what I
 conceive may have taken place. Let us suppose the zigzag diagram
 not drawn upon a plane, but projected in space of three dimensions.
 What figure can we best select to meet all the conditions involved?
 Many of the facts can be well explained by supposing the projection
 in space of Professor Emerson Reynolds' zigzag curve to be a spiral.
 This figure is, however, inadmissible, inasmuch as the curve has
 to pass through a point neutral as to electricity and chemical
 energy twice in each cycle. We must, therefore, adopt some other
 figure. A figure of eight (8), or lemniscate, will foreshorten
 into a zigzag just as well as a spiral, and it fulfils every condition
 of the problem."

 <p>
 another form of a <em>spiral</em>,<em> </em>perhaps, in its <em>reinvolutionary
 </em>path onward, from matter into Spirit, and the necessary gradual
 and final reabsorption into the <em>laya</em> state, that which
 Science calls in her own way "the point neutral as to electricity"
 etc., or the <em>zero</em> point. Such are the Occult facts and
 statement. They may be left with the greatest security and confidence
 to Science, to be justified some day. Let us hear some more, however,
 about this primordial genetic type of the symbolical caduceus.
 </p><blockquote>
 "Such a figure will result from three very simple simultaneous
 motions. First, a simple oscillation backwards and forwards (suppose
 east and west); secondly, a simple oscillation at right angles
 to the former (suppose north and south) of half the periodic time
 -- <i>i.e.</i>, twice as fast; and thirdly, a motion at right
 angles to these two (suppose downwards), which, in its simplest
 form, would be with unvarying velocity. If we project this figure
 in space we find on examination that the points of the curves,
 where chlorine, bromine, and iodine are formed, come close under
 each other; so also will sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; again,
 phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony; and in like manner other series
 of analogous bodies. It may be asked whether this scheme explains
 how and why the elements appear in this order? Let us imagine
 a cyclical translation in space, each evolution witnessing the
 genesis of the group of elements which I previously represented
 as produced during one complete vibration of the pendulum. Let
 us suppose that one cycle has thus been completed, the centre
 of the unknown creative force in its mighty journey through space
 having scattered along its track the primitive atoms -- the seeds,
 if I may use the expression -- which presently are to coalesce
 and develop into the groupings now known as lithium, beryllium,
 boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sodium, magnesium,
 aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, and chlorine. What is
 most probably the form of track now pursued? Were it strictly
 confined to the same plane of temperature and time, the next elementary
 groupings to appear would again have been those of lithium, and
 the original cycle would have been eternally repeated, producing
 again and again the same 14 elements. The conditions, however,
 are not quite the same. Space and electricity are as at first,
 but temperature has altered, and thus, instead of the atoms of
 lithium being supplemented with atoms in all respects analogous
 with themselves, the atomic groupings which come into being when
 the second cycle commences form, not lithium, but its lineal descendant,
 potassium. Suppose, therefore, the <i>vis generatrix </i>travelling
 to and fro in cycles along a lemniscate path, as above suggested,
 while simultaneously temperature is declining and time is flowing
 on -- variations which I have endeavoured to represent by the
 downward sink -- each coil of the lemniscate track crosses the
 same vertical line at lower and lower points. Projected in space,
 the curve shows a central line neutral as far as electricity is
 concerned, and neutral in chemical properties -- positive electricity
 on the north, negative on the south. Dominant atomicities are
 governed by the distance east and west from the neutral centre
 line, monatomic elements being one remove from it, diatomic two
 removes, and so on. In every successive coil the same law holds
 good."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 And, as if to prove the postulate of Occult Science and Hindu
 philos-</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 552 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 ophy, that, at the hour of the Pralaya, the two <em>aspects </em>of
 the unknowable deity, "the Swan in darkness" -- Prakriti
 and Purusha, nature or matter in all its forms and Spirit -- "no
 longer subsist but are (<em>absolutely</em>)<em> </em>dissolved,"
 we learn the conclusive scientific opinion of the great English
 chemist, who caps his proofs by saying: -- "We have now traced
 the formation of the chemical elements from knots and voids in
 a primitive, formless fluid. We have shown the possibility, nay,
 the probability that the atoms are not eternal in existence, but
 share with all other created beings the attributes of decay and
 death."
 </p><p>
 Occultism says <em>amen </em>to this, as the Scientific "possibility"
 and "probability" are for it facts demonstrated beyond
 the necessity of further proof or any extraneous physical evidence.
 Nevertheless, it repeats with as much assurance as ever: "MATTER
 IS ETERNAL, becoming atomic (its aspect) only periodically."
 This is as sure as that the other proposition, which is almost
 unanimously accepted by astronomers and physicists -- namely,
 that the wear and tear of the body of the Universe is steadily
 going on, and that it will finally lead to the extinction of the
 Solar fires and the destruction of the Universe -- is quite erroneous
 on the lines traced by Men of Science. There will be, as there
 ever were in time and eternity, periodical dissolutions of the
 manifested Universe, but (<em>a</em>) a partial <em>pralaya </em>after
 every "Day of Brahma;" and (<em>b</em>) an Universal
 pralaya -- the <b>M</b>AHA-PRALAYA -- only after the lapse of
 every Brahma's age. But the scientific causes for such dissolution,
 as brought forward by exact Science, have nothing to do with the
 true causes. However that may be, Occultism is once more justified
 by Science, for Mr. Crookes said: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "We have shown, from arguments drawn from the chemical laboratory,
 that in matter which has responded to every test of an element,
 there are minute shades of difference which may admit of selection.
 We have seen that the time-honoured distinction between elements
 and compounds no longer keeps pace with the developments of chemical
 science, but must be modified to include a vast array of intermediate
 bodies -- "meta-elements." We have shown how the objections
 of Clerk-Maxwell, weighty as they are, may be met; and finally,
 we have adduced reasons for believing that primitive matter was
 formed by the act of a generative force, throwing off at intervals
 of time atoms endowed with varying quantities of primitive forms
 of energy. If we may hazard any conjectures as to the source of
 energy embodied in a chemical atom, we may, I think, premise that
 the heat radiations propagated outwards through the ether from
 the ponderable matter of the universe, by some process of nature
 not yet known to us, are transformed at the confines of the universe
 into the primary -- the essential -- motions of chemical atoms,
 which, the instant they are formed, gravitate inwards, and thus
 restore to the universe the energy which otherwise would be lost
 to it through radiant heat. If this conjecture be well founded,
 Sir William Thomson's <i>startling prediction of the final decrepitude
 of the universe through the dissipation of its energy falls to
 the ground. </i>In this

 <blockquote>
 fashion, gentlemen, it seems to me that the question of the elements
 may be provisionally treated. Our slender knowledge of these first
 mysteries is extending steadily, surely, though slowly."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 By a strong and curious coincidence even our "septenary"
 doctrine seems to force the hand of Science. If we understand
 rightly, Chemistry speaks of fourteen groupings of primitive atoms
 -- lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine,
 sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur and
 chlorine; and Mr. Crookes, speaking of the "dominant atomicities,"
 enumerates seven groups of these, for he says: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "As the mighty focus of creative energy goes round, we see
 it in successive cycles sowing in one tract of space seeds of
 lithium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium; in another tract, chlorine,
 bromine, and iodine; in a third, sodium, copper, silver, and gold;
 in a fourth, sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; in a fifth, beryllium,
 calcium, strontium, and barium; in a sixth, magnesium, zinc, cadmium,
 and mercury; in a seventh, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and
 bismuth" -- which makes seven groupings on the one hand.
 And after showing "in other tracts the other elements --
 namely, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium; silicon, germanium,
 and tin; carbon, titanium, and zirconium."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 He adds: "While a natural position near the neutral axis
 is found for the three groups of elements relegated by Professor
 Mendeleeff to a sort of Hospital for Incurables -- his eighth
 family." It might be interesting to compare these "seven
 of the eighth family of 'incurables'" with the allegories
 concerning the seven primitive sons of "Mother, Infinite
 Space," or Aditi, and the <em>eighth </em>son rejected by
 her. Many a strange coincidence may thus be found between "those
 intermediate links . . . named 'meta-elements or elementoids and
 those whom occult science names their <em>noumenoi</em>,'<em>
 </em>the intelligent minds and rulers of those groupings of Monads
 and Atoms. But this would lead us too far. Let us be content with
 finding the confession of the fact that "this deviation from
 absolute homogeneity should mark the constitution of these molecules
 or aggregations of matter which we designate elements and will
 perhaps be clearer if we return in imagination to the earliest
 dawn of our material universe, and, face to face with the Great
 Secret, try to consider the processes of elemental evolution."
 Thus finally Science, in the person of its highest representatives,
 in order to make itself clearer to the profane, adopts the phraseology
 of such old adepts as Roger Bacon, and returns to the "protyle."
 All this is hopeful and suggestive of the "signs of the times."
 </p><p>
 Indeed these "signs" are many and multiply daily; but
 none are more important than those just quoted. For now the chasm
 between the occult "superstitious and <em>unscientific</em>"<em>
 </em>teachings and "exact" science is completely bridged,
 and one, at least, of the few eminent chemists of the day is in
 the realm of the infinite possibilities of occultism. Every new

 step he will take will bring him nearer and nearer to that mysterious
 centre, from which radiate the innumerable paths that lead down
 Spirit into matter, and which transform the gods and the living
 monads into man and sentient nature.

 But we have something more to say on this subject in the following
