 <blockquote>
 <strong>M</strong>ODERN science insists upon the doctrine of evolution;
 so do human reason and the "Secret Doctrine," and the
 idea is corroborated by the ancient legends and myths, and even
 by the Bible itself when it is read between the lines. We see
 a flower slowly developing from a bud, and the bud from its seed.
 But whence the latter, with all its predetermined programme of
 physical transformation, and its invisible, therefore <i>spiritual
 </i>forces which gradually develop its form, colour, and odour?
 The word <i>evolution </i>speaks for itself. The germ of the present
 human race must have preexisted in the parent of this race, as
 the seed, in which lies hidden the flower of next summer, was
 developed in the capsule of its parent flower; the parent may
 be but <i>slightly </i>different, but it still differs from its
 future progeny. The antediluvian ancestors of the present elephant
 and lizard were, perhaps, the mammoth and the plesiosaurus; why
 should not the progenitors of our human race have been the "<i>giants</i>"
 of the <i>Vedas, </i>the<i> Voluspa, </i>and the Book of <i>Genesis?
 </i>While it is positively absurd to believe the "transformation
 of species" to have taken place according to some of the
 more materialistic views of the evolutionists, it is but natural
 to think that each genus, beginning with the molluscs and ending
 with man, had modified its own primordial and distinctive forms.

 <strong>T</strong>HE Stanzas, with the Commentaries thereon, in
 this Book, the second, are drawn from the same Archaic Records
 as the Stanzas on Cosmogony in Book I. As far as possible a verbatim
 translation is given; but some of the Stanzas were too obscure
 to be understood without explanation. Hence, as was done in Book
 I., while they are first given in full as they stand, when taken
 verse by verse with their Commentaries an attempt is made to make
 them clearer, by words added in brackets, in anticipation of the
 fuller explanation of the Commentary.

 As regards the evolution of mankind, the Secret Doctrine postulates
 three new propositions, which stand in direct antagonism to modern
 science as well as to current religious dogmas: it teaches<em>
 </em>(<em>a</em>) the simultaneous evolution of seven human groups
 on seven different portions of our globe; (<em>b</em>) the birth
 of the <em>astral, </em>before the <em>physical</em> body: the
 former being a model for the latter; and (<em>c</em>) that man,
 in this Round, preceded every mammalian -- the anthropoids included
 -- in the animal kingdom.*

 * See Genesis ch. ii., v. 19. Adam is formed in verse 7, and in
 verse 19 it is said: "Out of the <em>ground </em>the Lord
 God formed <em>every beast of the field, and every fowl of the
 air;</em> <em>and brought them unto Adam </em>to see what he would
 call them." Thus man was created <em>before </em>the animals;
 for the animals mentioned in chapter i. are the signs of the Zodiac,
 while the man, "male and female," is not <em>man, </em>but
 the Host of the Sephiroth; <strong>F</strong>ORCES, or Angels,
 "made in his (God's) image and after his likeness."
 The Adam, man, is not made in that likeness, nor is it so asserted
 in the Bible. Moreover, the Second Adam [[Footnote continued on

 The Secret Doctrine is not alone in speaking of primeval MEN born
 simultaneously on the seven divisions of our Globe. In the <em>Divine</em>
 "<em>Pymander</em>"<em> </em>of Hermes we find the same
 Seven primeval men* evolving from Nature and "Heavenly Man,"
 in the collective sense of the word, namely, from the Creative
 Spirits; and in the fragments (collected by George Smith) of Chaldean
 tablets on which is inscribed the Babylonian Legend of Creation,
 in the first column of the <em>Cutha </em>tablet, seven human
 beings with the faces of ravens (black, swarthy complexions),
 whom "the (Seven) great gods created," are mentioned.
 Or, as explained in lines 16 and 18 -- "In the midst of the
 Earth they grew up and became great . . . . Seven kings, brothers
 of the same family." These are the Seven Kings of Edom to
 whom reference is made in the Kabala; the first race, which was
 <em>imperfect, i.e., </em>was born before the "balance"
 (sexes) existed, and which was therefore destroyed. (Zohar, <em>Siphrah
 Dzeniouta, Idrah Suta,</em> 2928,<em> La Kabbale, </em>p. 205.)
 "<em>Seven Kings,</em> brethren, appeared and begat children,
 6,000 in number were their peoples" (Hibbert Lectures, p.
 372). The god Nergas (death) destroyed them. "How did he
 destroy them?" "By bringing into equilibrium (or balance)
 those who did not yet exist" (<em>Siphrah Dzeniouta</em>)<em>.
 </em>They were "destroyed," as a race, by being merged
 in their own progeny (by exudation); that is to say, the sexless
 race reincarnated in the bisexual

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] is esoterically a septenary
 which represents seven men, or rather groups of men. For the first
 Adam -- the Kadmon -- is the synthesis of the <em>ten</em> Sephiroth.
 Of these, the upper triad remains in the Archetypal World as the
 future "Trinity," while the seven lower Sephiroth create
 the manifested material world; and <em>this septenate is the second
 Adam. </em>Genesis, and the mysteries upon which it was fabricated,
 came from Egypt. The "God" of the 1st chapter of Genesis
 is the <em>Logos, </em>and the "Lord God" of the 2nd
 chapter the Creative <em>Elohim</em> -- the<em> lower</em> powers.
 </p><p>
 * Thus saith Pymander -- "This is the mystery that to this
 day was hidden. Nature being mingled with the Heavenly man (Elohim,
 or Dhyanis), brought forth a wonder . . . . <em>Seven men,</em>
 all males and females (Hermaphrodite) . . . according to the nature
 of the seven Governors" -- Book II. v. 29) -- or the seven
 Hosts of the <em>Pitris </em>or Elohim, who projected or created
 him. This is very clear, but yet, see the interpretations of even
 our modern theologians, men supposed to be intellectual and learned!
 In the "<em>Theological and philosophical works of Hermes
 Trismegistus, Christian </em>(<em>?</em>)<em> Neoplatonist,</em>"<em>
 </em>a work compiled by John David Chambers, of Oriel College,
 Oxford, the translator wonders "for whom these <em>seven
 men </em>are intended?" He solves the difficulty by concluding
 that, as "the original pattern man (<em>Adam Kadmon of ch.</em>
 i.<em> Genesis</em>)<em> </em>was masculine-feminine, the seven
 may signify the succeeding patriarchs named in Genesis" (p.
 9) . . . A truly theological way of cutting the Gordian knot.

 (potentially); the latter in the Androgynes; these again in the
 sexual, the later third Race; (for further explanation, <em>vide
 infra</em>)<em>. </em>Were the tablets less mutilated, they would
 be found to contain word for word the same account as given in
 the archaic records and in Hermes, at least as regards the fundamental
 facts, if not as regards minute details; for Hermes is a good
 deal disfigured by mistranslations.
 </p><p>
 It is quite certain that the seeming supernaturalism of these
 teachings, although allegorical, is so diametrically opposed to
 the dead-letter statements of the Bible* as well as to the latest
 hypotheses of science, that it will evoke passionate denial. The
 Occultists, however, know that the traditions of Esoteric Philosophy
 must be the right ones, simply because they are the most logical,
 and reconcile every difficulty. Besides, we have the Egyptian
 "<em>Books of Thoth,</em>"<em> </em>and "<em>Book
 of the Dead,</em>" and the Hindu Puranas with the seven Manus,
 as well as the Chaldeo-Assyrian accounts, whose tiles mention
 seven primitive men, or Adams, the real meaning of which name
 may be ascertained through the Kabala. Those who know anything
 of the Samothracian mysteries will also remember that the generic
 name of the Kabiri was the "Holy Fires," which created
 on seven localities of the island of <em>Electria </em>(or Samothrace)
 the "Kabir born of the Holy Lemnos" (the island sacred
 to<em> Vulcan</em>).
 </p><p>
 According to Pindar (<em>See </em>"<em>Philosophumena,</em>"<em>
 Miller</em>'<em>s edition, p. </em>98), this Kabir, whose name
 was Adamas, was, in the traditions of Lemnos, the type of the
 primitive man born from the bosom of the Earth. He was the Archetype
 of the first males in the order of generation, and was one of
 the seven autochthonous ancestors or progenitors of mankind (<em>ibid,
 p. </em>108). If, while coupling with this the fact that Samothrace
 was colonised by the Phoenicians, and before them by the mysterious
 Pelasgians who came from the East, one remembers also the identity
 of the<em> mystery </em>gods of the Phoenicians, Chaldeans, and
 Israelites, it will be easy to discover whence came also the confused
 account of the Noachian deluge. It has become undeniable of late
 that the Jews, who obtained their primitive ideas about creation
 from Moses, who had them from

 <p>
 * As it is now asserted that the Chaldean tablets, which give
 the allegorical description of Creation, the Fall, and the Flood,
 even to the legend of the Tower of Babel, were written "before
 the time of Moses" (<em>See G. Smith</em>'<em>s </em>"<em>Chaldean
 Account of Genesis,</em>" <em>p</em>. 86), how can the Pentateuch
 be called a <em>revelation? </em>It is simply another version
 of the same story.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 4 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 the Egyptians, compiled their Genesis and first Cosmogonic traditions
 -- when these were rewritten by Ezra and others -- from the Chaldeo-Akkadian
 account. It is, therefore, sufficient to examine the Babylonian
 and Assyrian cuneiform and other inscriptions to find also therein,
 scattered here and there, not only the original meaning of the
 name Adam, Admi, or Adami,* but also the creation of seven Adams
 or roots of men, born of Mother Earth, physically, and of the
 <em>divine fire </em>of the progenitors, spiritually or astrally.
 The Assyriologists, ignorant of the esoteric teachings, could
 hardly be expected to pay any greater attention to the mysterious
 and ever-recurring number seven on the Babylonian cylinders, than
 they paid to it on finding the same in Genesis and the Bible.
 Yet the number of the ancestral spirits and their seven groups
 of human progeny are there, notwithstanding the dilapidated condition
 of the fragments, as plainly as they are to be found in<em> </em>"<em>Pymander</em>"<em>
 </em>and in the "<em>Book of the Concealed Mystery</em>"<em>
 </em>of the Kabala. In the latter Adam Kadmon is the Sephirothal
 TREE, as also the "Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil."
 And that "<em>Tree,</em>"<em> </em>says verse 32, "hath
 around it seven columns," or palaces, of the seven creative
 Angels operating in the spheres of the seven planets on our Globe.
 As Adam Kadmon is a <em>collective </em>name, so also is the name
 of the man Adam. Says George Smith<em> </em>in his<em> </em>"<em>Chaldean
 Account of Genesis</em>:" --
 </p><p>
 "The word Adam used in these legends for the first human
 being is evidently <em>not a proper name, but is only used as
 a term for mankind. </em>Adam appears as a proper name in Genesis,
 but certainly in some passages is only used in the same sense
 as the Assyrian word" (<i>p.</i> 86).
 </p><p>
 Moreover, neither the Chaldean nor the Biblical deluge (the stories
 of Xisuthrus and Noah) is based on the universal or even on the
 Atlantean deluges, recorded in the Indian allegory of Vaivaswata
 Manu. They are the <em>exoteric allegories based on the esoteric
 mysteries </em>of Samothrace. If the older Chaldees knew the esoteric
 truth concealed in the Puranic legends, the other nations were
 aware only of the Samothracian mystery, and allegorised it. They
 adapted it to their astronomical and anthropological, or rather
 phallic, notions. Samothrace is known <em>historically </em>to
 have been famous in antiquity for a deluge, which submerged the
 country and reached the top of the highest mountains; an event
 which happened before the age of the Argonauts. It was overflowed

 suddenly by the waters of the Euxine, regarded up to that time
 as a lake.* But the Israelites had, moreover, another legend upon
 which to base their allegory: the "deluge," that transformed
 the present Gobi Desert into a sea <em>for the last time, </em>some
 10 or 12,000 years ago, and which drove many Noahs and their families
 on to the surrounding mountains. As the Babylonian accounts are
 now only restored from hundreds of thousands of broken fragments
 (the mound of <em>Kouyunjik </em>alone having yielded to Layard's
 excavations over twenty thousand fragments of inscriptions), the
 proofs here cited are comparatively scanty; yet such as they are,
 they corroborate almost every one of our teachings, certainly
 three, at least. These are: --
 </p><p>
 (1.) That the race which was the first to fall into generation
 was a <em>dark Race </em>(<em>Zalmat Gaguadi</em>)<em>, </em>which
 they call the <em>Adami </em>or dark Race, and that <em>Sarku,
 </em>or the light Race, remained pure for a long while subsequently.
 </p><p>
 (2.) That the Babylonians recognised <em>two principal Races </em>at
 the time of the Fall, the Race of the Gods (the Ethereal <em>doubles
 of the Pitris</em>), having preceded these two. This is Sir H.
 Rawlinson's opinion. These "Races" are our second and
 third Root-races.
 </p><p>
 (3) That these seven Gods, each of whom created a <em>man, </em>or
 group of men, were "the gods <em>imprisoned </em>or incarnated."
 These gods were: the god <em>Zi; </em>the god <em>Ziku </em>(noble
 life, Director of purity); the god <em>Mirku</em> (noble crown)
 "Saviour from death of the gods" (later on) imprisoned,
 and the creator of "the dark Race which his hand has made;"
 the god <em>Libzu </em>"wise among the gods"; the god
 <em>Nissi . </em>. . . and the god <em>Suhhab;</em> and <em>Hea</em>
 or <em>Sa, </em>their synthesis, the god of wisdom and of the
 Deep, identified with Oannes-Dagon, at the time of the fall, and
 called (collectively) the Demiurge, or Creator. (<em>See Chaldean
 Account Genesis, </em>p. 82.)
 </p><p>
 There are two "Creations" so called, in the Babylonian
 fragments, and <em>Genesis </em>having adhered to this, one finds
 its first two chapters distinguished as the Elohite and the Jehovite
 creations. Their proper order, however, is not preserved in these
 or in any other exoteric accounts. Now these "Creations,"
 according to the occult teachings, refer respectively to the formation
 of the primordial seven <em>men </em>by the progenitors (the Pitris,
 or Elohim): and to that of the human groups after the fall.

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 6 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 All this will be examined in the light of science and comparisons
 drawn from the scriptures of all the ancient nations, the Bible
 included, as we proceed. Meanwhile, before we turn to the <em>Anthropogenesis
 </em>of the prehistoric Races, it may be useful to agree upon
 the names to be given to the Continents on which the four great
 Races, which preceded our <em>Adamic</em> Race, were born, lived,
 and died. Their archaic and esoteric names were many, and varied
 with the language of the nationality which mentioned them in its
 annals and scriptures. That which in the Vendidad, for instance,
 is referred to as Airyanem Vaego (<em>see</em> <em>Bund. </em>79,
 12) wherein was born the original Zoroaster,* is called in the
 Puranic literature "Sveta-Dwipa," "Mount Meru,"
 the abode of Vishnu, etc., etc.; and in the Secret Doctrine is
 simply named the land of the "Gods" under their chiefs
 the "Spirits of this Planet."
 </p><p>
 Therefore, in view of the possible, and even very probable confusion,
 that may arise, it is considered more convenient to adopt, for
 each of the four Continents constantly referred to, a name more
 familiar to the cultured reader. It is proposed, then, to call
 the first continent, or rather the first <em>terra firma </em>on
 which the first Race was evolved by the divine progenitors: --
 </p><p>
 I. "The Imperishable Sacred Land."
 </p><p>
 The reasons for this name are explained as follows: This "Sacred
 Land" -- of which more later on -- is stated never to have
 shared the fate of the other continents; because it is the only
 one whose destiny it is to last from the beginning to the end
 of the Manvantara throughout each Round. It is the cradle of the
 first man and the dwelling of the last <em>divine </em>mortal,
 chosen as a <em>Sishta </em>for the future seed of humanity. Of
 this mysterious and sacred land very little can be said, except,
 perhaps, according to a poetical expression in one of the Commentaries,
 that the "pole-star has its watchful eye upon it, from the
 dawn to the close of the twilight of 'a day' of the GREAT BREATH."**
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * By "original" we mean the "Amshaspend,"
 called "Zarathustra, the lord and ruler of the Vara made
 by Yima in that land." There were several Zarathustra or
 Zertusts, the Dabistan alone enumerating thirteen; but these were
 all the reincarnations of the first one. The last Zoroaster was
 the founder of the Fire temple of Azareksh and the writer of the
 works on the primeval sacred Magian religion destroyed by Alexander.
 </p><p>
 ** In India called "The Day of Brahma." </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 7 HYPERBOREAS AND LEMURIA.</h6>
 
 <p>
 II. The "<strong>H</strong>YPERBOREAN" will be the name
 chosen for the Second Continent, the land which stretched out
 its promontories southward and westward from the North Pole to
 receive the Second Race, and comprised the whole of what is now
 known as Northern Asia. Such was the name given by the oldest
 Greeks to the far-off and mysterious region, whither their tradition
 made Apollo the "Hyperborean" travel every year. <em>Astronomically,
 </em>Apollo is of course the Sun, who, abandoning his Hellenic
 sanctuaries, loved to visit annually his far-away country, where
 the Sun was said never to set for one half of the year. [[<em>Eggus
 gar nuktos te kai ematos eisi keleuthoi</em>]], says a verse in
 the <em>Odyssey </em>(x. 86).
 </p><p>
 But<em> historically, </em>or better, perhaps, ethnologically
 and geologically, the meaning is different. The land of the Hyperboreans,
 the country that extended beyond Boreas, the frozen-hearted god
 of snows and hurricanes, who loved to slumber heavily on the chain
 of Mount Riphaeus, was neither an ideal country, as surmised by
 the mythologists, nor yet a land in the neighbourhood of Scythia
 and the Danube.* It was a real Continent, a <em>bona-fide </em>land
 which knew no winter in those early days, nor have its sorry remains
 more than one night and day during the year, even now. The nocturnal
 shadows never fall upon it, said the Greeks; for it is the <em>land
 of the Gods, </em>the favourite abode of Apollo, the god of light,
 and its inhabitants are his beloved priests and servants. This
 may be regarded as poetised <em>fiction</em> now; but it was poetised
 <em>truth</em> then.
 </p><p>
 III. The third Continent, we propose to call "Lemuria."
 The name is an invention, or an idea, of Mr. P. L. Sclater, who
 asserted, between 1850 and 1860, on zoological grounds the actual
 existence, in prehistoric times, of a Continent which he showed
 to have extended from Madagascar to Ceylon and Sumatra. It included
 some portions of what is now Africa; but otherwise this gigantic
 Continent, which stretched from the Indian ocean to Australia,
 has now wholly disappeared beneath the waters of the Pacific,
 leaving here and there only some of its highland tops which are
 now islands. Mr. A. R. Wallace, the naturalist, "extends
 the Australia of tertiary periods to New Guinea and the Solomon
 Islands, and perhaps to Fiji;" and from its Marsupial types
 he infers "a connection with the Northern Continent during
 the

 <p>
 Secondary period," writes Mr. C. Gould in "<em>Mythical
 Monsters,</em>"<em> </em>p. 47. The subject is treated at
 length elsewhere.*
 </p><p>
 IV. "Atlantis" is the Fourth Continent. It would be
 the first historical land, were the traditions of the ancients
 to receive more attention than they have hitherto. The famous
 island of Plato of that name was but a fragment of this great
 Continent. (<em>See </em>"<em>Esoteric</em> <em>Buddhism.</em>")
 </p><p>
 V. The Fifth Continent was America; but, as it is situated at
 the Antipodes, it is Europe and Asia Minor, almost coeval with
 it, which are generally referred to by the Indo-Aryan Occultists
 as the fifth. If their teaching followed the appearance of the
 Continents in their geological and geographical order, then this
 classification would have to be altered. But as the sequence of
 the Continents is made to follow the order of evolution of the
 Races, from the first to the fifth, our Aryan Root-race, Europe
 must be called the fifth great Continent. The Secret Doctrine
 takes no account of islands and peninsulas, nor does it follow
 the modern geographical distribution of land and sea. Since the
 day of its earliest teachings and the destruction of the great
 Atlantis, the face of the earth has changed more than once. There
 was a time when the delta of Egypt and Northern Africa belonged
 to Europe, before the formation of the Straits of Gibraltar, and
 a further upheaval of the continent, changed entirely the face
 of the map of Europe. The last serious change occurred some 12,000
 years ago,**
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * It is to be remarked, however, that Mr. Wallace does not accept
 Mr. Sclater's idea, and even opposes it. Mr. Sclater supposes
 a land or continent formerly uniting Africa, Madagascar, and India
 (but not Australia and India); and Mr. A. R. Wallace shows, in
 his "<em>Geographical Distribution of Animals</em>"<em>
 </em>and "<em>Island Life,</em>" that the hypothesis
 of such a land is quite uncalled for on the alleged zoological
 grounds. But he admits that a much closer proximity of India and
 Australia did certainly exist, and at a time so very remote that
 it was "certainly pre-tertiary," and he adds in a private
 letter that "no name has been given to this supposed land."
 Yet the land did exist, and was of course <em>pre-tertiary, </em>for
 "Lemuria" (accepting this name for the third Continent)
 had perished before Atlantis had fully developed; and the latter
 sunk and its chief portions had disappeared before the end of
 the Miocene period.
 </p><p>
 ** One more "coincidence" --
 </p><p>
 "Now it is proved that in geologically recent times, <em>this
 region of North Africa was in</em> <em>fact a peninsula of Spain,
 </em>and that its union with Africa (proper) was effected on the
 North by the rupture of Gibraltar, and on the South by an <em>upheaval
 to which the Sahara</em> <em>owes its existence. </em>The shores
 of this former sea of Sahara are still marked by the shells [[Footnote

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 9 PRE-TERTIARY GIANTS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 and was followed by the submersion of Plato's little Atlantic
 island, which he calls Atlantis after its parent continent. Geography
 was part of the mysteries, in days of old. Says the <em>Zohar
 </em>(iii., fol. 10<em>a</em>): "These secrets (of land and
 sea) were divulged <em>to the men of the secret science</em>,
 but not to the geographers."
 </p><p>
 The claim that physical man was originally a colossal pre-tertiary
 giant, and that he existed 18,000,000 years ago, must of course
 appear preposterous to admirers of, and believers in, modern learning.
 The whole <em>posse comitatis </em>of biologists will turn away
 from the conception of this third race Titan of the Secondary
 age, a being fit to fight as successfully with the then gigantic
 monsters of the air, sea, and land, as his forefathers -- the
 ethereal prototype of the Atlantean -- had little need to fear
 that which could not hurt him. The modern anthropologist is quite
 welcome to laugh at our Titans, as he laughs at the Biblical Adam,
 and as the theologian laughs at his pithecoid ancestor. The Occultists
 and their severe critics may feel that they have pretty well mutually
 squared their accounts by this time. Occult sciences claim less
 and give more, at all events, than either Darwinian Anthropology
 or Biblical Theology.
 </p><p>
 Nor ought the Esoteric Chronology to frighten any one; for, with
 regard to figures, the greatest authorities of the day are as
 fickle and as uncertain as the Mediterranean wave. As regards
 the duration of the geological periods alone, the learned men
 of the Royal Society are all hopelessly at sea, and jump from
 one million to five hundred millions of years with the utmost
 ease, as will be seen more than once during this comparison.
 </p><p>
 Take one instance for our present purpose -- the calculations
 of Mr. Croll. Whether, according to this authority, 2,500,000
 years represent the time since the beginning of the tertiary age,
 or the Eocene period, as an American geologist makes him say;*
 or whether again Mr. Croll "allows fifteen millions since
 the beginning of the Eocene period," as quoted by an English
 geologist,** both sets of figures cover the claims

 made by the Secret Doctrine.* For assigning as the latter does
 from four to five million years between the incipient and the
 final evolution of the Fourth Root-Race, on the Lemuro-Atlantean
 Continents; one million years for the Fifth, or Aryan Race, to
 the present date; and about 850,000 since the submersion of the
 last large peninsula of the great Atlantis -- all this may have
 easily taken place within the 15,000,000 years conceded by Mr.
 Croll to the Tertiary Age. But, <em>chronologically </em>speaking,
 the duration of the period is of secondary importance, as we have,
 after all, certain American scientists to fall back upon. These
 gentlemen, unmoved by the fact that their assertions are called
 not only dubious but absurd, yet maintain that man existed so
 far back as in the Secondary Age. They have found human footprints
 on rocks of that formation; and furthermore, M. de Quatrefages
 finds no valid <em>scientific </em>reason why man should not have
 existed during the Secondary Age.

 * Sir Charles Lyell, who is credited with having "<em>happily
 </em>invented the terms Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene," to
 mark the three divisions of the Tertiary age, ought really to
 have settled upon some approximate age for his "Mind-offspring."
 Having left the duration of these periods, however, to the speculations
 of specialists, the greatest confusion and perplexity are the
 result of that happy thought. It seems like a hopeless task to
 quote one set of figures from one work, without the risk of finding
 it contradicted by the same Author in an earlier or a subsequent
 volume. Sir W. Thomson, one of the most eminent among the modern
 authorities, has changed, about half-a-dozen times, his opinion
 upon the age of the Sun and the date of the consolidation of the
 Earth's crust. In Thomson and Tait's "<em>Natural Philosophy,</em>"<em>
 </em>one finds only ten million years allowed, since the time
 when the temperature of the Earth permitted vegetable life to
 appear on it; (<em>App. D et seq. also Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.
 </em>xxiii, <em>Pt.</em> 1, 157, 1862, where 847 is cancelled).
 Mr. Darwin gives Sir W. Thomson's estimate as "a minimum
 of 98 and a maximum of 200 millions of years since the consolidation
 of the crust" (See Ch. Gould). In the same work (<em>Nat.
 Phil.</em>)<em> </em>80 millions are given from the time of incipient
 incrustation to the present state of the world. And in his last
 lecture, as shown elsewhere, Sir W. Thomson declares (1887) that
 the Sun is not older than 15 <em>millions </em>of years! Meanwhile,
 basing his arguments as to the limits to the age of the Sun's
 heat, on figures previously established by Sir W. Thomson, Mr.
 Croll allows 60<em> millions </em>of years since the beginning
 of the Cambrian period. This is hopeful for the lovers of <em>exact
 </em>knowledge. Thus, whatever figures are given by Occult Science,
 they are sure to be corroborated by those of some one among the
 modern men of Science who are considered as authorities.</p><hr>

 no two geologists or naturalists agree as to the figures. Thus,
 there is a wide margin for choice offered to the Occultist by
 the learned fraternity. Shall we take for one of our supports
 Mr. T. Mellard Reade? This gentleman, in a paper on "Limestone
 as an Index of Geological Time," read by him in 1878 before
 the Royal Society, claims that the <em>minimum </em>time required
 for the formation of the sedimentary <em>strata</em> and the elimination
 of the calcareous matter is in round numbers 600 million years
 (<em>See </em>"<em>Proceedings of Royal Society,</em>"<em>
 London, </em>Vol.<strong> </strong><b>XXVIII</b>., p. 281); or
 shall we ask support for our chronology from Mr. Darwin's works,
 wherein he demands for the organic transformations according to
 his theory from 300 to 500 million years? Sir C. Lyell and Prof.
 Houghton were satisfied with placing the beginning of the Cambrian
 Age at 200 and 240 millions of years back respectively. Geologists
 and zoologists claim the maximum time, though Mr. Huxley, at one
 time, placed the beginning of the incrustation of the earth 1,000
 million years ago, and would not surrender a millennium of it.

 But the main point for us lies not in the agreement or disagreement
 of the Naturalists as to the duration of geological periods, but
 rather in their perfect accord on one point, for a wonder, and
 this a very important one. They all agree that during "The
 Miocene Age" -- whether one or ten million years ago -- Greenland
 and even Spitzbergen, the remnants of our Second or Hyperborean
 Continent, "had <em>almost a tropical climate.</em>"<em>
 </em>Now the pre-Homeric Greeks had preserved a vivid tradition
 of this "Land of the Eternal Sun," whither their Apollo
 journeyed yearly. "During the Miocene Age, Greenland (in
 N. Lat. 70 degrees) developed an abundance of trees, such as the
 Yew, the Redwood, the Sequoia, allied to the Californian species,
 Beeches, Planes, Willows, Oaks, Poplars and Walnuts, as well as
 a Magnolia and a Zamia," says Science; in short Greenland
 had Southern plants unknown to Northern regions.
 </p><p>
 And now this natural question rises. If the Greeks knew, in the
 days of Homer, of a Hyperborean land,<em> i.e.,</em> a blessed
 land beyond the reach of Boreas, the god of winter and of the
 hurricane, an ideal region which the later Greeks and their classics
 have vainly tried to locate by searching for it beyond Scythia,
 a country where nights were short and days long, and beyond that
 land a country where the sun never set and the palm grew freely
 -- if they knew of all this, who then told them of it? In</p><hr>

 <p>
 their day, and for ages previously, Greenland must certainly have
 been already covered with perpetual snows, with never-thawing
 ice, just as it is now. Everything tends to show that the land
 of the short nights and the long days was Norway or Scandinavia,
 <em>beyond </em>which was the blessed land of eternal light and
 summer; and to know of this, their tradition must have descended
 to the Greeks from some people more ancient than themselves, who
 were acquainted with those climatic details of which the Greeks
 themselves could know nothing. Even in our day, science suspects
 beyond the Polar seas, at the very circle of the Arctic Pole,
 the existence of a sea which never freezes and a continent which
 is ever green. The archaic teachings, and likewise the Puranas
 -- for one who understands the allegories of the latter -- contain
 the same statements. Suffice, then, to us the strong probability
 that a people, now unknown to history, lived during the Miocene
 period of modern science, at a time when Greenland was an almost
 tropical land.
