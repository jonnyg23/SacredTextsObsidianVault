 (<em>a</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) They threw off their "shadows" or <em>astral
 bodies </em>-<em>- </em>if such an ethereal being as a "lunar
 Spirit" may be supposed to rejoice in an astral, besides
 a hardly tangible body. In another Commentary it is said that
 the "Ancestors" <em>breathed </em>out the first man,
 as Brahma is explained to have breathed out the <em>Suras </em>(Gods),
 when they became "<em>Asuras</em>"<em> </em>(from <em>Asu,
 </em>breath). In a third it is said that they, the newly-created
 men, "were the shadows of the Shadows."
 </p><p>
 With regard to this sentence -- "They were the shadows of
 the Shadows" -- a few more words may be said and a fuller
 explanation attempted. This first process of the evolution of
 mankind is far easier to accept than the one which follows it,
 though one and all will be rejected and doubted even by some Kabalists,
 especially the Western, who study the present effects, but have
 neglected to study their primary causes. Nor does the writer feel
 competent to explain a mode of procreation so difficult of appreciation
 save for an Eastern Occultist. Therefore it is useless to enter
 here into details concerning the process, though it is minutely
 described in the Secret Books, as it would only lead to speaking
 of facts hitherto unknown to the profane world, and hence to their
 being misunderstood. An "Adam" made of the dust of the
 ground will always be found preferable, by a certain class of
 students, to one projected out of the ethereal body of his creator;
 though the former process has never been heard of, while the latter
 is familiar, as all know, to many Spiritualists in Europe and
 America, who, of all men, ought to understand it. For who of those
 who have witnessed the phenomenon of a materialising form oozing
 out of the pores of a medium or, at other times, out of his <em>left
 side, </em>can fail to credit the possibility, at least, of such
 a <em>birth? </em>If there are</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 87 MAN NOT CREATED PERFECT.</h6>
 
 <p>
 in the Universe such beings as Angels or Spirits, whose <em>incorporeal
 </em>essence may constitute an intelligent entity notwithstanding
 the absence of any (to us) solid organism; and if there are those
 who believe that a god made the first man out of dust, and breathed
 into him a living Soul -- and there are millions upon millions
 who believe both -- what does this doctrine of ours contain that
 is so impossible? Very soon the day will dawn, when the world
 will have to choose whether it will accept the miraculous creation
 of man (and Kosmos too) out of <em>nothing, </em>according to
 the dead letter of <em>Genesis, </em>or a first man born from
 a fantastic link -- absolutely "<em>missing</em>"<em>
 </em>so far -- the common ancestor of man, and of the "true
 ape."* Between these two fallacies,** Occult philosophy steps
 in. It teaches that the first human stock was projected by higher
 and semi-divine Beings out of their own essences. If the latter
 process is to be considered as abnormal or even inconceivable
 -- because obsolete in Nature at this point of evolution -- it
 is yet proven possible on the authority of certain "Spiritualistic"
 FACTS. Which, then, we ask of the three hypotheses or theories
 is the most reasonable and the least absurd? Certainly no one
 -- provided he is not a soul-blind materialist -- can ever object
 to the occult teaching.
 </p><p>
 Now, as shown, we gather from the latter that man was not "created"
 the complete being he is now, however imperfect he still remains.
 There was a spiritual, a psychic, an intellectual, and an animal
 evolution, from the highest to the lowest, as well as a physical
 development -- from the simple and homogeneous, up to the more
 complex and heterogeneous; though not quite on the lines traced
 for us by the modern evolutionists. This double evolution in two
 contrary directions, required various ages, of divers natures
 and degrees of spirituality and intellectuality, to fabricate
 the being now known as man. Furthermore, the one absolute, ever
 acting and never erring law, which proceeds on the

 * ". . . Huxley, supported by the most evident discoveries
 in Comparative Anatomy, could utter the momentous sentence that
 the anatomical differences between man and the highest apes are
 less than those between the latter and the lowest apes. In relation
 to our genealogical tree of man, the necessary conclusion follows
 that the human race has <em>evolved gradually from the true apes.</em>"<em>
 </em>("<em>The Pedigree of Man,</em>"<em> </em>by Ernest
 Haeckel, translated by Ed. B. Aveling, p. 49).
 </p><p>
 What may be the scientific and <em>logical</em> objections to
 the opposite conclusion -- we would ask? The anatomical resemblances
 between Man and the Anthropoids -- grossly exaggerated as they
 are by Darwinists, as M. de Quatrefages shows -- are simply enough
 "accounted for" when the origin of the latter is taken
 into consideration.

 "Nowhere, in the older deposits, is an ape to be found that
 approximates more closely to man, or a man that approximates more
 closely to an ape . . . . . ."

 Man and Ape, goes back with undiminished breadth and depth to
 the Tertiary period. This fact alone is enough to make its untenability
 clear," (Dr. F. Pfaff, Prof. of Natural Science in the University
 of Erlangen). </p><hr>

 <p>
 same lines from one eternity (or Manvantara) to the other -- ever
 furnishing an ascending scale for the manifested, or that which
 we call the great Illusion (<em>Maha-Maya</em>)<em>, </em>but
 plunging Spirit deeper and deeper into materiality on the one
 hand, and then <em>redeeming it through flesh </em>and liberating
 it -- this law, we say, uses for these purposes the Beings from
 other and higher planes, men, or <em>Minds </em>(Manus), in accordance
 with their Karmic exigencies.
 </p><p>
 At this juncture, the reader is again asked to turn to the Indian
 philosophy and religion. The Esotericism of both is at one with
 our Secret Doctrine, however much the form may differ and vary.
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 <strong>O</strong>N THE <strong>I</strong>DENTITY AND <strong>D</strong>IFFERENCES
 OF THE <strong>I</strong>NCARNATING <strong>P</strong>OWERS.
 </p><p>
 <strong>T</strong>HE Progenitors of Man, called in India "Fathers,"
 Pitara or Pitris, are the creators of our bodies and lower principles.
 They are ourselves, as the <em>first personalities,</em> and<em>
 we are they. </em>Primeval man would be "the bone of their
 bone and the flesh of their flesh," if they had body and
 flesh. As stated, they were "<em>lunar </em>Beings."
 </p><p>
 The Endowers of man with his conscious, immortal EGO, are the
 "Solar Angels" -- whether so regarded metaphorically
 or literally. The mysteries of the Conscious EGO or human Soul
 are great. The esoteric name of these "Solar Angels"
 is, literally, the "Lords" (<em>Nath</em>)<em> </em>of<em>
 </em>"persevering ceaseless devotion" (<em>pranidhana</em>)<em>.
 </em>Therefore they of the <em>fifth</em> principle<em> </em>(<em>Manas</em>)<em>
 </em>seem to be connected with, or to have originated the system
 of the Yogis who make of <em>pranidhana </em>their<em> fifth</em>
 observance (see <em>Yoga Shastra, </em>II., 32.) It has already
 been explained why the trans-Himalayan Occultists regard them
 as evidently identical with those who in India are termed <em>Kumaras,
 Agnishwattas, </em>and the <em>Barhishads.</em> 
 </p><p>
 How precise and true is Plato's expression, how profound and philosophical
 his remark on the (human) soul or EGO, when he defined it as "a
 compound of the <em>same </em>and the <em>other.</em>"<em>
 </em>And yet how little this hint has been understood, since the
 world took it to mean that the soul was the breath of God, of
 Jehovah. It is "the <em>same </em>and the <em>other,</em>"<em>
 </em>as the great Initiate-Philosopher said; for the EGO (the
 "Higher Self" when merged with and in the Divine Monad)
 is Man, and yet the <em>same </em>as the "OTHER," the
 Angel in him incarnated, as the same with the universal <strong>M</strong>AHAT.
 The great classics and philosophers felt this truth, when saying
 that "there must be something within us which produces our
 thoughts. Something very subtle; it is a breath; it is fire; it
 is ether;</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 89 PITRIS OF THE GODS AND DEMONS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 it is quintessence; it is a slender likeness; it is an intellection;
 it is a number; it is harmony. . . . . "<em> </em>(<em>Voltaire</em>)<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 All these are the <em>Manasam</em> and<em> Rajasas:</em> the<em>
 Kumaras, Asuras, </em>and<em> </em>other rulers and <em>Pitris,
 </em>who incarnated in the Third Race, and in this and various
 other ways endowed mankind with Mind.
 </p><p>
 There are seven classes of Pitris, as shown below, three incorporeal
 and four corporeal; and two kinds, the Agnishwatta and the Barhishad.
 And we may add that, as there are two kinds of Pitris, so there
 is a double and a triple set of Barhishad and Agnishwatta. The
 former, having given birth to their astral doubles, are reborn
 as <em>Sons of Atri, </em>and are the "Pitris of the Demons,"
 or corporeal beings, on the authority of Manu (III., 196); while
 the Agnishwatta are reborn as Sons of Marichi (a son of Brahma),
 and are the Pitris of the Gods (<em>Manu </em>again, <em>Matsya</em>
 and<em> Padma Puranas </em>and<em> Kulluka </em>in the Laws of
 the <em>Manavas, </em>III., 195).* Moreover, the <em>Vayu Purana
 </em>declares all the seven orders to have originally been the
 <em>first gods, </em>the<em> Vairajas, </em>whom Brahma "with
 the eye of Yoga, beheld in the eternal spheres, and who are the
 <em>gods of gods</em>";<em> </em>and the <em>Matsya </em>adds
 that the Gods worshipped them; while the <em>Harivansa </em>(<em>S.
 </em>1, 935) distinguishes the Virajas as one class of the Pitris
 only -- a statement corroborated in the Secret Teachings, which,
 however, identify the Virajas with the <em>elder Agnishwattas**
 </em>and the <em>Rajasas, </em>or<em> Abhutarajasas, </em>who
 are incorporeal without even an astral phantom. Vishnu is said,
 in most of the <b>MSS</b>., to have incarnated in and through
 them. "In the <em>Raivata Manvantara, </em>again, Hari, best
 of gods, was born of <em>Sambhuti, </em>as the divine Manasas
 -- originating with the deities called Rajasas." Sambhuti
 was a daughter of Daksha, and wife of Marichi, the father of the
 <em>Agnishwatta, </em>who, along with the Rajasas, are ever associated
 with <em>Manasas. </em>As remarked by a far more able Sanskritist
 than Wilson, Mr. Fitzedward Hall, "Manasa is no inappropriate
 name for a deity associated with the Rajasas. We appear to have
 in it Manasam -- the same as <em>Manas </em>-- with<em> </em>the
 change of termination required to express male personification"
 (<em>Vishnu Purana </em>Bk. III., ch. I., p. 17 footnote). All
 the sons of <em>Viraja </em>are<em> Manasa, </em>says<em> Nilakantha.
 </em>And
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * We are quite aware that the <em>Yayu</em> and<em> Matsya Puranas
 </em>identify (agreeably to Western interpretation) the Agnishwatta
 with the seasons, and the Barhishad Pitris with the months; adding
 a fourth class -- the Kavyas -- cyclic years. But do not Christian,
 Roman Catholics identify their Angels with planets, and are not
 the seven Rishis become the <em>Saptarshi </em>-- a constellation?
 They are deities presiding over all the cyclic divisions.
 </p><p>
 ** The Vayu Purana shows the region called Viraja-loka inhabited
 by the Agnishwattas.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 90 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Viraja is Brahma, and, therefore, the <em>incorporeal </em>Pitris
 are called Vairajas from being the sons of Viraja, says <em>Vayu
 Purana.</em> 
 </p><p>
 We could multiply our proofs <em>ad infinitum, </em>but it is
 useless. The wise will understand our meaning, the <em>unwise
 </em>are not required to. There are thirty-three crores, or 330
 millions, of gods in India. But, as remarked by the learned lecturer
 on the Bhagavad Gita, "they may be all devas, but are by
 no means all 'gods', in the high spiritual sense one attributes
 to the term." "This is an unfortunate blunder,"
 he remarks, "generally committed by Europeans. Deva is a
 kind of spiritual being, and because the same word is used in
 ordinary parlance to mean god, it by no means follows that we
 have to worship thirty-three crores of gods." And he adds
 suggestively: "These beings, as may be naturally inferred
 have a <em>certain affinity </em>with one of the three component
 <em>Upadhis </em>(basic principles) into which we have divided
 man." -- (<em>Vide Theosophist, </em>Feb.,<em> </em>1887,
 <em>et seq.</em>)
 </p><p>
 The names of the deities of a certain mystic class change with
 every Manvantara. Thus the twelve great gods, <em>Jayas, </em>created
 by Brahma to assist him in the work of creation in the very beginning
 of the Kalpa, and who, lost in Samadhi, neglected to create --
 whereupon they were cursed to be repeatedly born in each Manvantara
 till the seventh -- are respectively called <em>Ajitas, Tushitas,
 Satyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sadhyas, </em>and<em> Adityas: </em>they
 are <em>Tushitas </em>(in the second Kalpa), and <em>Adityas </em>in
 this <em>Vaivasvata </em>period (see <em>Vayu Purana</em>)<em>,
 </em>besides other names for each age. But they are identical
 with the <em>Manasa </em>or<em> Rajasas, </em>and these with our
 incarnating Dhyan Chohans. They are all classes of the <em>Gnana-devas.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Yes; besides those beings, who, like the Yakshas, Gandharvas,
 Kinaras, etc., etc., taken in their <em>individualities, </em>inhabit
 the astral plane, there are real <em>Devagnanams, </em>and to
 these classes of <em>Devas </em>belong the <em>Adityas,</em> the<em>
 Vairajas, </em>the<em> Kumaras,</em> the<em> Asuras, </em>and
 all those high celestial beings whom Occult teaching calls <em>Manaswin,
 </em>the Wise, foremost of all, and who would have made all men
 the <em>self-conscious </em>spiritually intellectual beings they
 will be, had they not been "cursed" to fall into generation,
 and to be reborn themselves as mortals for their neglect of duty.

 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> Manu, </em>as already remarked, comes from the
 root "<em>man</em>"<em> </em>to think, hence "a
 thinker." It is from this Sanskrit word very likely that
 sprung the Latin "mens," mind, the Egyptian "<em>Menes,</em>"<em>
 </em>the "Master-Mind," the Pythagorean <em>Monas, </em>or
 conscious "<em>thinking unit,</em>"<em> </em>mind also,
 and even our "Manas" or mind, the fifth principle in
 man. Hence these shadows are called <em>amanasa, </em>"mindless."
 </p><p>
 With the Brahmins the Pitris are very sacred, because they are
 the Progenitors,* or ancestors of men -- the first <em>Manushya
 </em>on this Earth -- and offerings are made to them by the Brahmin
 when a son is born unto him. They are more honoured and their
 ritual is more important than the worship of the gods (See the
 "<em>Laws of Manu,</em>"<em> </em>Bk. III., p. 203).
 </p><p>
 May we not now search for a philosophical meaning in this dual
 group of progenitors?
 </p><p>
 The Pitris being divided into <em>seven classes, </em>we have
 here the mystic number again. Nearly all the Puranas agree that
 three of these are <em>arupa, </em>formless, while four are corporeal;
 the former being intellectual and spiritual, the latter material
 and devoid of intellect. Esoterically, it is the <em>Asuras </em>who
 form the first three classes of Pitris -- "born in the body
 of night" -- whereas the other four were produced from the
 body of twilight. Their fathers, the gods, were doomed to be born
 fools on Earth, according to <em>Vayu Purana. </em>The legends
 are purposely mixed up and made very hazy: the Pitris being in
 one the sons of the gods, and, in another those of Brahma; while
 a third makes them instructors of their own fathers. It is the
 Hosts of the four material classes who create men simultaneously
 on the seven zones.
 </p><p>
 Now, with regard to the seven classes of Pitris, each of which
 is again divided into seven, a word to students and a query to
 the profane. That class of the "Fire Dhyanis," which
 we identify on undeniable grounds with the Agnishwattas, is called
 in our school the "Heart" of the Dhyan-Chohanic Body;
 and it is said to have incarnated in the third race of men and
 made them perfect. The esoteric Mystagogy speaks of the mysterious
 relation existing between the hebdomadic essence or substance
 of this angelic Heart and that of man, whose
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * This was hinted at in <em>Isis Unveiled, Vol. </em>I.<em>, p</em>.
 xxxviii., though the full explanation could not then be given:
 "The <em>Pitris </em>are not the ancestors of the present
 living men, but those of the first human kind or Adamic race;
 the spirits of <em>human</em> races, which, on the great scale
 of descending evolution, preceded our races of men, and were physically
 as well as spiritually, far superior to our modem pigmies. In
 <em>Manava-Dharma-Sastra </em>they are called the <em>Lunar</em>
 ancestors."</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 92 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 every physical organ, and psychic, and spiritual function, is
 a reflection, so to say, a copy on the terrestrial plane of the
 model or prototype <em>above. </em>Why, it is asked, should there
 be such a strange repetition of the number seven in the anatomical
 structure of man? Why should the heart have <em>four lower </em>"cavities
 and <em>three higher </em>divisions," answering so strangely
 to the septenary division of the human principles, separated into
 two groups, the higher and the lower; and why should the same
 division be found in the various classes of Pitris, and especially
 our Fire Dhyanis? For, as already stated, these Beings fall into
 four corporeal (or grosser) and three incorporeal (or subtler)
 "principles," or call them by any other name you please.
 Why do the seven nervous plexuses of the body radiate <em>seven</em>
 rays? Why are there these seven plexuses, and why seven distinct
 layers in the human skin?
 </p><p>
 "<em>Having projected their shadows and made men of one element
 </em>(ether), <em>the progenitors re-ascend to Maha-loka, whence
 they descend periodically, when the world is renewed, to give
 birth to new men.</em> 
 </p><p>
 "<em>The subtle bodies remain without understanding </em>(Manas)<em>
 until the advent of the Suras </em>(Gods)<em> now called Asuras
 </em>(not Gods)," says the Commentary.
 </p><p>
 "<em>Not-gods,</em>"<em> </em>for the Brahmins, perhaps,
 but the highest <em>Breaths, </em>for<em> </em>the Occultist;
 since those progenitors (Pitar), the formless and the intellectual,
 refuse to build man, but endow him with mind; the four corporeal
 classes creating only his body.
 </p><p>
 This is very plainly shown in various texts of the <em>Rig Veda</em>
 -- the highest authority for a Hindu of any sect whatever. Therein
 <em>Asura </em>means "spiritual divine," and the word
 is used as a synonym for Supreme Spirit, while in the sense of
 a "God," the term "Asura" is applied to Varuna
 and Indra and pre-eminently to Agni -- the three having been in
 days of old the <em>three highest gods, </em>before Brahmanical
 Theo-Mythology distorted the true meaning of almost everything
 in the Archaic Scriptures. But, as the key is now lost, the Asuras
 are hardly mentioned.
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Zendavesta </em>the same is found. In the Mazdean,
 or Magian, religion, "Asura" is the lord <em>Asura Visvavedas,
 </em>the "all-knowing" or "omniscient Lord";
 and <em>Asura-Mazdha, </em>become later <em>Ahura-Mazdha,</em>
 is, as Benfey shows, "the Lord who <em>bestows Intelligence</em>"<em>
 </em>-- Asura-Medha and Ahura-Mazdao. Elsewhere in this work it
 is shown, on equally good authority, that the Indo-Iranian Asura
 was always regarded as <em>sevenfold. </em>This fact, combined
 with the name Mazdha, as above, which makes of the sevenfold Asura
 the "Lord," or "Lords" collectively "who
 <em>bestow Intelligence,</em>"<em> </em>connects the <em>Amshaspends
 </em>with the Asuras and with our incarnating Dhyan Chohans, as
 well as with the Elohim, and the seven informing gods of Egypt,
 Chaldea, and every other country.
 </p><p>
 Why these "gods" refused to create men is not, as stated
 in exoteric</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 93 A GRAND APOCALYPTIC METAPHOR.</h6>
 
 <p>
 accounts, because their pride was too great to share the celestial
 power of their essence with the children of Earth, but for reasons
 already suggested. However, allegory has indulged in endless fancies
 and theology taken advantage thereof in every country to make
 out its case against these first-born, or the <em>logoi, </em>and
 to impress it as a truth on the minds of the ignorant and credulous.
 (Compare also what is said about Makara and the Kumaras in connection
 with the Zodiac.)
 </p><p>
 The Christian system is not the only one which has degraded them
 into demons. Zoroastrianism and even Brahmanism have profited
 thereby to obtain hold over the people's mind. Even in Chaldean
 exotericism, Beings who <em>refuse to create, i.e., </em>who are
 said to oppose thereby the <em>Demiurgos, </em>are also denounced
 as the Spirits of Darkness. The Suras, who win their intellectual
 independence, fight the Suras who are devoid thereof, who are
 shown as passing their lives in profitless ceremonial worship
 based on blind faith -- a hint now ignored by the <em>orthodox
 </em>Brahmins -- and forthwith the former become <em>A-Suras.
 The </em>first and <em>mind-born </em>Sons of the Deity refuse
 to create progeny, and are <em>cursed </em>by Brahma to be <em>born
 as men. </em>They are hurled <em>down to Earth, </em>which, later
 on, is transformed, in theological dogma, into the <em>infernal
 </em>regions. Ahriman destroys the Bull created by Ormazd -- which
 is the emblem of terrestrial <em>illusive </em>life, the "germ
 of sorrow" -- and, forgetting that the perishing finite seed
 must die, in order that the plant of immortality, the plant of
 spiritual, eternal life, should sprout and live, Ahriman is proclaimed
 the enemy, the opposing power, the devil. Typhon cuts Osiris into
 fourteen pieces, in order to prevent his peopling the world and
 thus creating misery; and Typhon becomes, in the exoteric, theological
 teaching, the Power of Darkness. But all this is the exoteric
 shell. It is the worshippers of the latter who attribute to disobedience
 and rebellion the effort and self-sacrifice of those who would
 help men to their original status of divinity through <em>self-conscious
 </em>efforts; and it is these worshippers of Form who have made
 demons of the Angels of Light.
 </p><p>
 Esoteric philosophy, however, teaches that <em>one third* </em>of
 the Dhyanis -- <em>i.e.</em>, the three classes of the <em>Arupa
 </em>Pitris, endowed with intelligence, "which is a formless
 breath, composed of <em>intellectual </em>not elementary substances"
 (see <em>Harivamsa, </em>932)<em> </em>-- was simply <em>doomed
 by the law of Karma and evolution to be reborn </em>(or incarnated)
 on Earth.** Some

 * Whence the subsequent assertions of St. John's vision, referred
 to in his Apocalypse, about "the great red Dragon having
 seven heads and <em>ten </em>horns, and seven crowns upon his
 heads," whose "tail drew the <em>third part </em>of
 the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth" (ch.
 xii.).
 </p><p>
 ** The verse "did cast them to the Earth," plainly shows
 its origin in the grandest and oldest allegory of the Aryan mystics,
 who, after the destruction of the Atlantean [[Footnote continued

 <p>
 of these were <em>Nirmanakayas </em>from other Manvantaras. Hence
 we see them, in all the Puranas, reappearing on this globe, in
 the <em>third Manvantara, </em>as Kings, Rishis and heroes (read
 Third Root-Race). This tenet, being too philosophical and metaphysical
 to be grasped by the multitudes, was, as already stated, disfigured
 by the priesthood for the purpose of preserving a hold over them
 through superstitious fear.
 </p><p>
 The supposed "rebels," then, were simply those who,
 compelled by Karmic law to drink the cup of gall to its last bitter
 drop, <em>had to incarnate </em>anew, and thus make responsible
 thinking entities of the astral statues projected by their inferior
 brethren. Some are said to have refused, because they had not
 in them the requisite materials -- <em>i.e.</em>, an astral body
 -- since they were <em>arupa. </em>The refusal of others had reference
 to their having been Adepts and Yogis of long past preceding Manvantaras;
 another mystery. But, later on, as <em>Nirmanakayas, </em>they
 sacrificed themselves for the good and salvation of the <em>Monads
 </em>which were waiting for their turn, and which otherwise would
 have had to linger for countless ages in irresponsible, animal-like,
 though in appearance human, forms. It may be a parable and an
 allegory <em>within an allegory. </em>Its solution is left to
 the intuition of the student, if he only reads that which follows
 with his <em>spiritual eye.</em> 
 </p><p>
 As to their fashioners or "Ancestors" -- those Angels
 who, in the exoteric legends, obeyed the law -- they must be identical
 with the Barhishad Pitris, or the Pitar-Devata, <em>i.e.</em>,
 <em>those possessed of the physical creative fire. </em>They could
 only create, or rather clothe, the human Monads with their own
 astral Selves, but they could not make man in their image and
 likeness. "Man must not be like one of us," say the
 <em>creative </em>gods, entrusted with the fabrication of the
 lower animal but higher; (see <em>Gen. </em>and<em> Plato</em>'<em>s
 Timaeus</em>)<em>. </em>Their creating the semblance of men out
 of their own divine Essence means, esoterically, that it is

 the <em>willing</em> and the <em>unwilling,</em> the <em>creators
 </em>and those who <em>refused to create, </em>being now mixed
 up most perplexingly by Christian Catholics, who forget that their
 highest Archangel, St. Michael, who is shown to conquer (to master
 and to assimilate) the <strong>D</strong>RAGON OF <strong>W</strong>ISDOM
 and of divine Self-sacrifice (now miscalled and calumniated as
 Satan), WAS THE FIRST TO REFUSE TO CREATE! This led to endless
 confusion. So little does Christian theology understand the paradoxical
 language of the East and its symbolism, that it even explains,
 in its <em>dead letter sense, </em>the Chinese Buddhist and Hindu
 exoteric rite of raising a noise during certain eclipses to scare
 away the "great red Dragon," which laid a plot to carry
 away the light! But here "Light" means esoteric Wisdom,
 and we have sufficiently explained the secret meaning of the terms
 <em>Dragon, Serpent, </em>etc., etc., all of which refer to Adepts
 and Initiates.</p><hr>

 they who became the first Race, and thus shared its destiny and
 further evolution. They <em>would </em>not, simply because they
 <em>could </em>not, give to man that sacred spark which burns
 and expands into the flower of human reason and self-consciousness,
 for they had it not to give. This was left to that class of Devas
 who became symbolised in Greece under the name of Prometheus,
 to those who had nought to do with the physical body, yet everything
 with the purely spiritual man. (<em>See Part II of this volume,
 </em>"<em>The Fallen Angels</em>";<em> also </em>"<em>The
 Gods of Light proceed from the Gods of Darkness.</em>")
 </p><p>
 Each class of Creators endows man with what it has to give: the
 one builds his external form; the other gives him its essence,
 which later on becomes the Human <em>Higher Self </em>owing to
 the <em>personal exertion of the individual</em>;<em> </em>but
 they could not make men as they were themselves -- perfect, because
 sinless; sinless, because having only the first, pale shadowy
 outlines of attributes, and these all perfect -- from the human
 standpoint -- white, pure and cold as the virgin snow. Where there
 is no struggle, there is no merit. Humanity, "of the Earth
 earthy," was not destined to be created by the angels of
 the first divine Breath: therefore they are said to <em>have refused
 </em>to do so, and man had to be formed by more material creators,*
 who, in their turn, could give only what they had in their own
 natures, and no more. Subservient to eternal law, the pure gods
 could only project out of themselves <em>shadowy </em>men, a little
 less ethereal and spiritual, less <em>divine and perfect </em>than
 themselves -- shadows still. The first humanity, therefore, was
 a pale copy of its progenitors; too material, even in its ethereality,
 to be a hierarchy of gods; too spiritual and pure to be MEN, endowed
 as it is with every <em>negative </em>(<em>Nirguna</em>)<em> </em>perfection.
 Perfection, to be fully such, must be born out of imperfection,
 the <em>incorruptible </em>must grow out of the corruptible, having
 the latter as its vehicle and basis and contrast. Absolute light
 is absolute darkness, and <em>vice versa. </em>In fact, there
 is neither light nor

 * In spite of all efforts to the contrary, Christian theology
 -- having burdened itself with the Hebrew esoteric account of
 the creation of man, which is understood <em>literally</em> --
 cannot find any reasonable excuse for its "<em>God, </em>the
 Creator," who produces a man devoid of mind and sense; nor
 can it justify the punishment following an act, for which Adam
 and Eve might plead <em>non compos. </em>For if the couple is
 admitted to be ignorant of good and evil before the eating of
 the forbidden fruit, how could it be expected to know that <em>disobedience
 was evil? </em>If primeval man was meant to remain a half-witted,
 or rather witless, being, then his creation was aimless and even
 <em>cruel, </em>if produced by an omnipotent and perfect God.
 But Adam and Eve are shown, even in Genesis, to be created by
 a class of lower divine Beings, the <em>Elohim, </em>who are so
 jealous of their personal prerogatives as reasonable and intelligent
 creatures, that they will not allow man to become "as one
 of us." This is plain, even from the dead-letter meaning
 of the Bible. The Gnostics, then, were right in regarding the
 Jewish God as belonging to a class of lower, material and not
 very holy denizens of the invisible World.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 96 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 darkness in the realms of truth. Good and Evil are twins, the
 progeny of Space and Time, under the sway of Maya. Separate them,
 by cutting off one from the other, and they will both die. Neither
 exists <em>per se, </em>since each has to be generated and created
 out of the other, in order to come into being; both must be known
 and appreciated before becoming objects of perception, hence,
 in mortal mind, they must be divided.
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, as the illusionary distinction exists, it requires
 a <em>lower order of creative angels </em>to "create"
 inhabited globes -- especially ours -- or to deal with matter
 on this earthly plane. The philosophical Gnostics were the first
 to think so, in the historical period, and to invent various systems
 upon this theory. Therefore in their schemes of creation, one
 always finds their <em>Creators </em>occupying a place at the
 very foot of the ladder of spiritual Being. With them, those who
 created our earth and its mortals were placed on the very limit
 of <em>mayavic </em>matter, and their followers were taught to
 think -- to the great disgust of the Church Fathers -- that for
 the creation of those wretched races, in a spiritual and moral
 sense, which grace our globe, no high divinity could be made responsible,
 but only angels of a <em>low hierarchy,* </em>to which class they
 relegated the Jewish God, Jehovah.
 </p><p>
 Mankinds different from the present are mentioned in all the ancient
 Cosmogonies. Plato speaks, in the <em>Phaedrus, </em>of a <em>winged
 race of men. </em>Aristophanes (<em>in Plato</em>'<em>s Banquet</em>)<em>,
 </em>speaks of a race androgynous and with round bodies. In <em>Pymander,
 </em>all the animal kingdom even is double-sexed. Thus in §
 18, it is said: "The circuit having been accomplished, <em>the
 knot was loosened</em>. . . . and all the animals, which were
 equally androgynous, were <em>untied</em> (separated)<em> together
 with man</em>. . . . ." for. . . . "the causes had to
 produce effects on earth."** Again, in the ancient Quiche
 Manuscript, the <em>Popol Vuh </em>-- published by the late Abbe
 Brasseur de Bourbourg -- the first men are described as a race
 "whose sight was unlimited, and who knew all things at once":
 thus showing the <em>divine knowledge of Gods, </em>not mortals.
 The Secret Doctrine, correcting the unavoidable exaggerations
 of popular fancy, gives the facts as they are recorded in the
 Archaic symbols.

 * In<em> Isis Unveiled </em>several of these Gnostic systems are
 given. One is taken from the <em>Codex Nazaraeus, </em>the Scriptures
 of the Nazarenes, who, although they existed long before the days
 of Christ, and even before the laws of Moses, were Gnostics, and
 many of them Initiates. They held their "Mysteries of Life"
 in Nazara (ancient and modern Nazareth), and their doctrines are
 a faithful echo of the teachings of the Secret Doctrine -- some
 of which we are now endeavouring to explain.

 (<em>b</em>) These "shadows" were born "each of
 his own colour and kind," each also "inferior to his
 creator," because the latter was a complete being of his
 kind. The Commentaries refer the first sentence to the colour
 or complexion of each human race thus evolved. In <em>Pymander,
 </em>the Seven primitive men, created by Nature from the "heavenly
 Man," all partake of the qualities of the "Seven <em>Governors,</em>"<em>
 </em>or Rulers, who loved Man -- their own reflection and synthesis.
 </p><p>
 In the Norse Legends, one recognizes in Asgard, the habitat of
 the gods, as also in the <em>Ases </em>themselves, the same mystical
 <em>loci </em>and personifications woven into the popular "myths,"
 as in our Secret Doctrine; and we find them in the Vedas, the
 Puranas, the Mazdean Scriptures and the Kabala. The <em>Ases </em>of
 Scandinavia, the rulers of the world which preceded ours, whose
 name means literally the "pillars of the world," its
 "supports," are thus identical with the Greek <em>Cosmocratores,
 </em>the "Seven Workmen or Rectors" of Pymander, the
 seven Rishis and Pitris of India, the seven Chaldean gods and
 seven evil spirits, the seven Kabalistic Sephiroth synthesised
 by the upper triad, and even the seven Planetary Spirits of the
 Christian mystics. The Ases create the earth, the seas, the sky
 and the clouds, the whole visible world, from the remains of the
 slain giant Ymir; but they do not create <strong>M</strong>AN,
 but only his form from the <em>Ask </em>or ash-tree. It is Odin
 who endows him with life and soul, after Lodur had given him blood
 and bones, and finally it is Honir who furnishes him with his
 intellect (<em>manas</em>)<em> </em>and with his conscious senses.
 The Norse Ask, the Hesiodic Ash-tree, whence issued the men of
 the generation of bronze, the Third Root-Race, and the <em>Tzite
 </em>tree of the <em>Popol-Vuh, </em>out of which the Mexican
 <em>third</em> race of men was created, are all one.* This may
 be plainly seen by any reader. But the Occult reason why the Norse
 Yggdrasil, the Hindu Aswatha, the Gogard, the Hellenic tree of
 life, and the Tibetan Zampun, are one with the Kabalistic Sephirothal
 Tree, and even with the Holy Tree made by Ahura Mazda, and the
 Tree of Eden -- who among the western scholars can tell?** Nevertheless,
 the fruits of all those "Trees," whether Pippala or
 Haoma or yet the more prosaic apple, are the "plants of life,"
 in fact and verity. The prototypes of our races were all enclosed
 in the microcosmic tree, which grew and developed <em>within and
 under </em>the great mundane macrocosmic tree***; and the mystery
 is half revealed in the <em>Dirghotamas, </em>where it is said:
 "Pippala, the sweet fruit of that tree upon which come <em>spirits
 who</em>

 <em>love the science, </em>and where the gods produce all marvels."
 As in the Gogard, among the luxuriant branches of all those mundane
 trees, the "Serpent" dwells. But while the Macroscosmic
 tree is the Serpent of Eternity and of absolute Wisdom itself,
 those who dwell in the Microcosmic tree are the Serpents of the
 manifested Wisdom. One is the One and All; the others are its
 <em>reflected </em>parts. The "tree" is man himself,
 of course, and the Serpents dwelling in each, the conscious <em>Manas,
 </em>the connecting link between Spirit and Matter, heaven and
 earth.
 </p><p>
 Everywhere, it is the same. The <em>creating </em>powers produce
 Man, but fail in their final object. All these logoi strive to
 endow man with <em>conscious </em>immortal spirit, reflected in
 the Mind (<em>manas</em>)<em> </em>alone; they fail, and they
 are all represented as being punished for the failure, if not
 for the attempt. What is the nature of the punishment? A sentence
 of imprisonment in the lower or nether region, which is <em>our
 earth</em>;<em> the lowest in its chain</em>;<em> </em>an "eternity"
 -- meaning the duration of the life-cycle -- in the <em>darkness
 </em>of matter, or <em>within animal Man. </em>It has pleased
 the half ignorant and half designing Church Fathers to disfigure
 the graphic symbol. They took advantage of the metaphor and allegory
 found in every old religion to turn them to the benefit of the
 new one. Thus man was transformed into the darkness of a material
 hell; his divine consciousness, obtained from his indwelling Principle
 (the Manasa), or the incarnated Deva, became the glaring flames
 of the infernal region; and our globe that Hell itself. <em>Pippala,
 Haoma, </em>the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, were denounced
 as the <em>forbidden </em>fruit, and the "Serpent of Wisdom,"
 the Voice of reason and consciousness, remained identified for
 ages with the Fallen Angel, which is the old Dragon, the Devil!
 (<em>Vide </em>Part II., "The Evil Spirit, who, or what?")
 </p><p>
 The same for the other high symbols. The <em>Svastica, </em>the
 most sacred and mystic symbol in India, the "Jaina-Cross"
 as it is now called by the Masons, notwithstanding its direct
 connection, and even identity with the Christian Cross, has become
 dishonoured in the same manner. It is the "devil's sign,"
 we are told by the Indian missionaries. "Does it not shine
 on the head of the great <em>Serpent </em>of Vishnu, on the thousand
 headed Sesha-Ananta, in the depths of Patala, the Hindu <em>Naraka
 </em>or Hell"? It does: but what is Ananta? As Sesha, it
 is the almost endless Manvantaric cycle of time, and becomes <em>infinite</em>
 Time itself, when called Ananta, the great seven-headed Serpent,
 on which rests Vishnu, the <em>eternal Deity,</em> during<em>
 Pralayic</em> inactivity. What has Satan to do with this highly
 metaphysical symbol? The <em>Svastica </em>is the most philosophically
 scientific of all symbols, as also the most comprehensible. It
 is the summary in a few lines of the whole work of <em>creation,
 </em>or evolution, as one should rather say, from Cosmo-theogony
 down to Anthro- </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 99 THE HAMMER OF THOR.</h6>
 
 <p>
 pogony, from the indivisible unknown Parabrahm to the humble <em>moneron
 </em>of materialistic science, whose <em>genesis is as unknown
 </em>to that science as is that of the All-Deity itself. The <em>Svastica
 </em>is found heading the religious symbols of every old nation.
 It is the "Worker's Hammer" in the Chaldean <em>Book
 of Numbers, </em>the "Hammer" just referred to in the
 "<em>Book of Concealed Mystery</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Ch.
 </em>I., §§ 1<em>, </em>2, 3, 4, etc.), "which
 striketh sparks from the flint" (Space), those sparks becoming
 worlds. It is "Thor's Hammer," the magic weapon forged
 by the dwarfs against the Giants, or the <em>pre-cosmic </em>Titanic
 forces of Nature, which rebel and, while alive in the region of
 matter, will not be subdued by the Gods, the Agents of Universal
 Harmony, but have first to be destroyed. This is why the world
 is formed out of the relics of the murdered Ymir. The Svastica
 is the Miolnir, the "storm-hammer"; and therefore it
 is said that when the Ases, the holy gods, after having been purified
 by fire (the fire of passions and suffering in their life-incarnations),
 become fit to dwell in Ida in eternal peace, then Miolnir will
 become useless. This will be when the bonds of Hel (the goddess-queen
 of the region of the Dead) will bind them no longer, for the kingdom
 of evil will have passed away. "Surtur's flames had not destroyed
 them, nor yet had the raging waters" of the several deluges.
 . . . . "Then came the sons of Thor. They brought <em>Miolnir</em>
 with them, no longer as a weapon of war, but as the hammer with
 which to consecrate the new heaven and the new Earth. . . . .
 "*
 </p><p>
 Verily many are its meanings! In the <em>Macrocosmic </em>work,
 the "<strong>H</strong>AMMER OF <strong>C</strong>REATION,"
 with its four arms bent at right angles, refers to the continual
 <em>motion</em> and revolution of the invisible Kosmos of Forces.
 In that of the manifested Kosmos and our Earth, it points to the
 rotation in the cycles of Time of the world's axes and their equatorial
 belts; the two lines forming the <em>Svastica</em> <img src="sd2-29a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 meaning Spirit and Matter, the four hooks suggesting the motion
 in the revolving cycles. Applied to the <em>Microcosm, </em>Man,
 it shows him to be a link between heaven and Earth: the right
 hand being raised at the end of a horizontal arm, the left pointing
 to the Earth. In the <em>Smaragdine Tablet of Hermes, </em>the
 uplifted right hand is inscribed with the word "<em>Solve,</em>"<em>
 </em>the left with the word "<em>Coagula.</em>"<em>
 </em>It is at one and the same time an Alchemical, Cosmogonical,
 Anthropological, and Magical sign, with seven keys to its inner
 meaning. It is not too much to say that the compound symbolism
 of this universal and most suggestive of signs contains the key
 to the seven great mysteries of Kosmos. Born in the mystical conceptions
 of the early Aryans, and by them placed at the very threshold
 of eternity, on the head of the serpent Ananta, it found

 its spiritual death in the scholastic interpretations of mediaeval
 Anthropomorphists. It is the <em>Alpha </em>and the <em>Omega
 </em>of universal creative Force, evolving from pure Spirit and
 ending in gross Matter. It is also the key to the cycle of Science,
 divine and human; and he who comprehends its full meaning is for
 ever liberated from the toils of <em>Mahamaya, </em>the great
 Illusion and Deceiver. The light that shines from under the divine
 hammer, now degraded into the mallet or gavel of the Grand Masters
 of Masonic Lodges, is sufficient to dissipate the darkness of
 any human schemes or fictions.
 </p><p>
 How prophetic are the songs of the three Norse Goddesses, to whom
 the ravens of Odin whisper of the past and the future, as they
 flutter around in their abode of crystal beneath the flowing river.
 The songs are all written down in the "<em>Scrolls </em>of
 Wisdom," of which many are lost but some still remain: and
 they repeat in poetical allegory the teachings of the archaic
 ages. To summarise from Dr. Wagner's "Asgard and the Gods,"
 the "renewal of the world," which is a prophecy about
 the seventh Race of our Round told in the past tense.
 </p><p>
 The Miolnir had done its duty in this Round, and: --
 </p><p>
 ". . . . on the field of Ida, the field of resurrection (for
 the Fifth Round), the sons of the highest gods assembled, and
 <em>in them their fathers rose again </em>(the<em> Egos </em>of
 all their past incarnations). They talked of the Past and the
 Present, and remembered the wisdom and prophecies of their ancestor
 which had all been fulfilled. Near them, but <em>unseen of them,
 </em>was the strong, the mighty One, who rules all things. . .
 . and ordains the eternal laws that govern the world. They <em>all
 knew he was there, they felt his presence and his power, but were
 ignorant of his name. At his command the new Earth rose out of
 the Waters of Space. </em>To the South above the Field of Ida,
 he made another heaven called Audlang, and further off, a third,
 Widblain. Over Gimil's cave, a wondrous palace was erected, covered
 with gold and shining bright in the sun." These are the three
 gradually ascending planets of our "Chain." There the
 Gods were enthroned, as <em>they used to be</em>. . . . From Gimil's
 heights (the<em> seventh </em>planet or globe, the highest and
 the purest), they looked down upon the happy descendants of LIF
 and LIFTHRASIR (the coming Adam and Eve of purified <em>humanity</em>)<em>,
 </em>and signed to them to CLIMB <em>up</em> <em>higher,</em>
 to<em> rise in knowledge and wisdom, </em>step by step, from one
 "heaven to another," until they were at last fit to
 be united to the Gods in the house of All-Father (p. 305).
 </p><p>
 He who knows the doctrines of Esoteric <em>Budhism, </em>(or Wisdom),
 though so imperfectly sketched hitherto, will see clearly the
 allegory contained in the above.
 </p><p>
 Its more philosophical meaning will be better understood if the
 reader thinks carefully over the myth of Prometheus. It is examined

 further on in the light of the Hindu <em>Pramantha. </em>Degraded
 into a <em>purely physiological </em>symbol by some Orientalists,
 and taken in connection with terrestrial fire only, their interpretation
 is an insult to every religion, including Christianity, whose
 greatest mystery is thus dragged down to matter. The "friction"
 of divine Pramantha and Arani could suggest itself under this
 image only to the brutal conceptions of the German materialists
 -- than whom there are none worse. It is true that the Divine
 babe, <em>Agni</em> with the Sanskrit-speaking Race, who became
 <em>Ignis </em>with the Latins, is born from the conjunction of
 Pramantha and Arani (Svastica) during the sacrificial ceremony.
 But what of that? <em>Twashtri </em>(Viswakarman) is the "divine
 artist and <em>carpenter</em>"<em>* </em>and is also the
 Father of the gods and of <em>creative fire </em>in the Vedas.
 So ancient is the symbol and so sacred, that there is hardly an
 excavation made on the sites of old cities without its being found.
 A number of such <em>terra cotta </em>discs, called <em>fusaiolos,</em>
 were found by Dr. Schliemann <em>under</em> the ruins of ancient
 Troy. Both these forms <img src="sd2-101a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 and <img src="sd2-101b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> were excavated in
 great abundance, their presence being one more proof that the
 ancient Trojans and their ancestors were pure Aryans.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) Chhaya, as already explained, is the astral image.
 It bears this meaning in Sanskrit works. Thus Sanjna (Spiritual
 Consciousness), the wife of Surya, the Sun, is shown retiring
 into the jungle to lead an ascetic life, and leaving behind to
 her husband her Chhaya, shadow or image.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * The "Father of the Sacred Fire," writes Prof. Jolly,
 "is Twashtri . . . his mother was Maya. He himself was styled
 <em>Akta</em> (anointed, [[<em>christos</em>]]), after the priest
 had poured upon his head the <em>spirituous </em>(?)<strong> S</strong>OMA,
 and on his body butter purified by sacrifice"; ("<em>Man
 before Metals,</em>"<em> </em>p. 190). The source of his
 information is not given by the French Darwinist. But the lines
 are quoted to show that light begins to dawn even upon the materialists.
 Adalbert Kuhn, in his "<em>Die Herabkunft des Feuers,</em>"
 identifies the two signs <img src="sd2-29a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 and <img src="sd2-101a.gif" align="BOTTOM"> with <em>Arani</em>,
 and designates them under this name. He adds: "This process
 of kindling fire naturally led men to the idea of sexual reproduction,"
 etc. Why could not a more dignified idea, and one more occult,
 have led man to invent that symbol, in so far as it is connected,
 in one of its aspects, with human reproduction? But its chief
 symbolism refers to Cosmogony.
 </p><p>
 "<em>Agni</em>, in the condition of <em>Akta, </em>or anointed,
 is suggestive of Christ," remarks Prof. Jolly. "<em>Maya,
 </em>Mary, his mother; <em>Twastri</em>, St. Joseph, the carpenter
 of the Bible." In the <em>Rig Veda, </em>Viswakarman is the
 highest and oldest of the Gods and their "Father." He
 is the "carpenter or builder," because God is called
 even by the monotheists, "the Architect of the Universe."
 Still, the original idea is purely metaphysical, and had no connection
 with the later Phallicism.</p><hr>

 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) Here an explanation again becomes necessary in the
 light, and with the help of the exoteric added to the esoteric
 scriptures. The "<em>Manushyas</em>"<em> </em>(men)
 and the <em>Manus </em>are here equivalent to the Chaldean "Adam"
 -- this term not meaning at all the first man, as with the Jews,
 or one solitary individual, but <em>mankind </em>collectively,
 as with the Chaldeans and Assyrians. It is the four orders or
 classes of Dhyan Chohans out of the seven, says the Commentary,
 "who were the progenitors of the <em>concealed </em>man<em>,</em>"<em>
 i.e</em>., the subtle inner man. The "Lha" of the Moon,
 the lunar spirits, were, as already stated, only the <em>ancestors
 of his form, i.e., </em>of the model according to which Nature
 began her external work upon him. Thus primitive man was, when
 he appeared, only a senseless Bhuta* or a "Phantom."
 This "creation" was a failure, the reason of which will
 be explained in the Commentary on Sloka 20.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) This attempt was again a failure. It allegorizes
 the vanity of <em>physical </em>nature's unaided attempts to construct
 even a perfect <em>animal</em> -- let alone man. For the "Fathers,"
 the lower Angels, are all Nature-Spirits and the higher Elementals
 also possess an intelligence of their own; but this is not enough
 to construct a THINKING man. "<em>Living</em> Fire"
 was needed, that fire which gives the human mind its self-perception
 and self-consciousness, or <em>Manas</em>;<em> </em>and the progeny
 of <em>Parvaka</em> and<em> Suchi </em>are the <em>animal electric
 </em>and solar fires, which create animals, and could thus furnish
 but a physical living constitution to that first astral model
 of man. The first creators, then, were the Pygmalions of primeval
 man: they failed to animate the statue -<em>- intellectually.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 This Stanza we shall see is very suggestive. It explains the mystery
 of, and fills the gap between, the informing principle in man
 -- the

 <p>
 * It is not clear why "<em>Bhutas</em>"<em> </em>should
 be rendered by the Orientalists as meaning "evil Spirits"
 in the Puranas. In the <em>Vishnu Purana, </em>Book I, ch. 5,
 the Sloka simply says: "Bhutas -- fiends, frightful from
 being monkey-coloured and carnivorous"; and the word in India
 now means <em>ghosts, </em>ethereal or <em>astral</em> phantoms,
 while in esoteric teaching it means <em>elementary</em> substances,
 something made of attenuated, noncompound essence, and, specifically,
 the astral <em>double </em>of any man or animal. In this case
 these primitive men are the <em>doubles </em>of the first ethereal
 Dhyanis or Pitris.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 103 THE DIVINE REBELS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 HIGHER SELF or human Monad -- and the animal Monad, both one and
 the same, although the former is endowed with <em>divine</em>
 intelligence, the latter with <em>instinctual </em>faculty alone.
 How is the difference to be explained, and the presence of that
 HIGHER SELF in man accounted for?
 </p><p>
 "<em>The Sons of </em>MAHAT <em>are the quickeners of the
 human Plant. They are the Waters falling upon the arid soil of
 latent life, and the Spark that vivifies the human animal. They
 are the Lords of Spiritual Life eternal.</em>"<em> </em>.
 . . .<em> </em>"<em>In the beginning </em>(in the Second
 Race) <em>some </em>(of the Lords) <em>only breathed of their
 essence into Manushya </em>(men);<em> and some took in man their
 abode.</em>"
 </p><p>
 This shows that not all men became incarnations of the "divine
 <em>Rebels,</em>"<em> </em>but only a few among them. The
 remainder had their fifth principle simply quickened by the spark
 thrown into it, which accounts for the great difference between
 the intellectual capacities of men and races. Had not the "sons
 of Mahat," speaking allegorically, skipped the intermediate
 worlds, in their impulse toward intellectual freedom, the animal
 man would never have been able to reach upward from this earth,
 and attain through self-exertion his ultimate goal. The cyclic
 pilgrimage would have to be performed through all the planes of
 existence half unconsciously, if not entirely so, as in the case
 of the animals. It is owing to this rebellion of intellectual
 life against the morbid inactivity of pure spirit, that we are
 what we are -- self-conscious, thinking men, with the capabilities
 and attributes of Gods in us, for good as much as for evil. Hence
 the REBELS are our saviours. Let the philosopher ponder well over
 this, and more than one mystery will become clear to him. It is
 only by the attractive force of the contrasts that the two opposites
 -- Spirit and Matter -- can be cemented on Earth, and, smelted
 in the fire of self-conscious experience and suffering, find themselves
 wedded in Eternity. This will reveal the meaning of many hitherto
 incomprehensible allegories, foolishly called "fables."

 It explains, to begin with, the statement made in Pymander: that
 the "heavenly MAN," the "Son of the Father,"
 who partook of the nature and essence of the Seven Governors,
 or <em>creators </em>and<em> Rulers </em>of the material world,
 "peeped through the <em>Harmony </em>and, breaking through
 the <em>Seven Circles of Fire, </em>made manifest the downward-born
 nature."* It explains every verse in that Hermetic narrative,
 as also the Greek allegory of Prometheus. Most important of all,
 it explains the many allegorical accounts about the "Wars
 in Heaven," including that of <em>Revelation </em>with respect
 to the Christian dogma of the <em>fallen angels.</em> It<em> </em>explains
 the "rebellion" of the oldest and highest Angels, and
 the meaning of their being cast down from Heaven into the depths
 of Hell,

 <em>i.e</em>., MATTER. It even solves the recent perplexity of
 the Assyriologists, who express their wonder through the late
 George Smith.
 </p><p>
 "My first idea of this part" (of the rebellion), he
 says, "was that the wars with the powers of Evil <em>preceded
 the Creation</em>;<em> </em>I<em> </em>now think it followed the
 account of the fall" (<em>Chaldean Account of Genesis, </em>p.
 92). In this work Mr. George Smith gives an engraving, from an
 early Babylonian cylinder, of the Sacred Tree, the Serpent, man
 and woman. The tree has seven branches: <em>three </em>on the
 man's side, <em>four </em>on that of the female. These branches
 are typical of the seven Root-Races, in the <em>third </em>of
 which, at its very close, occurred the separation of the sexes
 and the so-called FALL into generation. The three earliest Races
 were sexless, then hermaphrodite; the other four, male and female,
 as distinct from each other. "The Dragon," says Mr.
 G. Smith, "which in the Chaldean account of the creation
 leads man to sin, is the creation of Tiamat, the living principle
 of the Sea, or Chaos . . . which was opposed to the deities at
 the creation of the world." This is an error. The Dragon
 is the male principle, or Phallus, personified, or rather <em>animalized</em>;<em>
 </em>and Tiamat, "the embodiment of the Spirit of Chaos,"
 of the deep, or Abyss, is the female principle, the Womb. The
 "Spirit of<em> Chaos </em>and<em> Disorder</em>"<em>
 </em>refers to the mental perturbation which it led to. It is
 the sensual, attractive, magnetic principle which fascinates and
 seduces, the ever living active element which throws the whole
 world into disorder, chaos, and sin. The Serpent seduces the woman,
 but it is the latter who seduces man, and both are included in
 the Karmic curse, though only as a natural result of a cause produced.
 Says George Smith: "It is clear that the Dragon is included
 in the curse for the Fall, and that the Gods" (the Elohim,
 jealous at seeing the man of clay becoming a Creator in his turn,
 like all the animals,) "invoke on the head of the human Race
 all the evils which afflict humanity. Wisdom and knowledge shall
 injure him, he shall have family quarrels, he will anger the gods,
 he shall submit to tyranny. . . . he shall be disappointed in
 his desires, he shall pour out<em> useless prayers, </em>he shall
 commit future sin. . No doubt subsequent lines continue this topic,
 but again our narrative is broken, and it re-opens only where
 the gods are preparing for war with the powers of evil, which
 are led by Tiamat (the woman). . . . " (<em>Babylonian Legend
 of Creation, </em>p. 92.)
 </p><p>
 This account is omitted in <em>Genesis, </em>for monotheistic
 purposes. But it is a mistaken policy -- born no doubt of fear,
 and regard for dogmatic religion and its superstitions -- to have
 sought to restore the Chaldean fragments by <em>Genesis, </em>whereas
 it is the latter, far younger than any of the fragments, which
 ought to be explained by the former.

 As a full explanation is found in Stanza V. (<em>Vide</em> paragraph
 (<em>a</em>)), a few remarks will now suffice. The "Father"
 of primitive physical man, or of his body, is the vital electric
 principle residing in the Sun. The Moon is its Mother, because
 of that mysterious power in the Moon which has as decided an influence
 upon human gestation and generation, which it regulates, as it
 has on the growth of plants and animals. The "Wind"
 or Ether, standing in this case for the agent of transmission
 by which those influences are carried down from the two luminaries
 and diffused upon Earth, is referred to as the "nurse";
 while "Spiritual Fire" alone makes of man a divine and
 perfect entity.
 </p><p>
 Now what is that "Spiritual Fire"? In alchemy it is
 HYDROGEN, in general; while in esoteric actuality it is the emanation
 or the Ray which proceeds from its <em>noumenon, </em>the "Dhyan
 of the first Element." Hydrogen is <em>gas </em>only on our
 terrestrial plane. But even in chemistry hydrogen "would
 be the only existing form of matter, in our sense of the term,"*
 and is very nearly allied to <em>protyle, </em>which is our <em>layam.
 </em>It is the father and generator, so to say, or rather the
 <em>Upadhi </em>(basis), of both AIR and WATER, and is "fire,
 air and water," in fact: <em>one</em> under three aspects;
 hence the chemical and alchemical trinity. In the world of manifestation
 or matter it is the objective symbol and the material emanation
 from the subjective and purely spiritual entitative Being in the
 region of <em>noumena. </em>Well might Godfrey Higgins have compared
 Hydrogen to, and even identified it with, the To ON, the "One"
 of the Greeks. For, as he remarks, Hydrogen is <em>not</em> Water,
 though it generates it; Hydrogen is not fire, though it manifests
 or creates it; nor is it Air, though air may be regarded as a
 product of the union of Water and

 <p>
 Fire -- since Hydrogen is found in the aqueous element of the
 atmosphere. It is three in one.
 </p><p>
 If one studies comparative Theogony, it is easy to find that the
 secret of these "Fires" was taught in the <em>Mysteries
 </em>of every ancient people, pre-eminently in Samothrace. There
 is not the smallest doubt that the Kabeiri, the most arcane of
 all the ancient deities, gods and men, great deities and Titans,
 are identical with the Kumaras and Rudras headed by Kartikeya
 -- a Kumara also. This is quite evident even exoterically; and
 these Hindu deities were, like the Kabeiri, the<em> personified
 sacred Fires of the most occult powers of Nature. The </em>several
 branches of the Aryan Race, the Asiatic and the European, the
 Hindu and the Greek, did their best to conceal their true nature,
 if not their importance. As in the case of the Kumaras, the number
 of the Kabeiri is uncertain. Some say that there were three or
 four only; others say seven. Aschieros, Achiosersa, Achiochersus,
 and Camillus may very well stand for the <em>alter egos </em>of
 the four Kumaras -- Sanat-Kumara, Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanatana.
 The former deities, whose reputed father was Vulcan, were often
 confounded with the Dioscuri, Corybantes, Anaces, etc.; just as
 the Kumara, whose reputed father is Brahma, (or rather, the "Flame
 of his Wrath," which prompted him to perform the ninth or
 Kumara creation, resulting in Rudra or Nilalohita (Siva) and the
 Kumaras), were confounded with the Asuras, the Rudras, and the
 Pitris, for the simple reason that they are all one -- <em>i.e.</em>,
 correlative Forces and Fires. There is no space to describe these
 "fires" and their real meaning here, though we may attempt
 to do so if the third and fourth volumes of this work are ever
 published. Meanwhile a few more explanations may be added.
 </p><p>
 The foregoing are all mysteries which must be left to the personal
 intuition of the student for solution, rather than described.
 If he would learn something of the secret of the FIRES, let him
 turn to certain works of the Alchemists, who very correctly connect
 fire with every element, as do the Occultists. The reader must
 remember that the ancients considered religion, and the natural
 sciences along with philosophy, to be closely and inseparably
 linked together. AEsculapius was the Son of Apollo -- the Sun
 or FIRE of Life; at once <em>Helios, Pythios, </em>and the god
 of oracular Wisdom. In exoteric religions, as much as in esoteric
 philosophy, the Elements -- especially fire, water, and air --
 are made the progenitors of our <em>five</em> <em>physical senses,
 </em>and hence are directly connected (in an occult way) with
 them. These physical senses pertain even to a lower creation than
 the one called in the Puranas <em>Pratisarga, </em>or secondary
 Creation. "Liquid fire proceeds from indiscrete fire,"
 says an Occult axiom.
 </p><p>
 "The Circle is the THOUGHT; the diameter (or the line) is
 the WORD;</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 107 BATH-KOL, DAUGHTER OF THE VOICE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 and their union is LIFE." In the Kabala, Bath-Kol is the
 daughter of the <em>Divine Voice, </em>or primordial light, Shekinah.
 In the Puranas and Hindu exotericism, Vach (the Voice) is the
 female <em>Logos </em>of Brahma -- a permutation of Aditi, <em>primordial
 light. </em>And if Bath-Kol, in Jewish mysticism, is an articulate
 praeternatural voice from heaven, revealing to the "chosen
 people" the sacred traditions and laws, it is only because
 Vach was called, before Judaism, the "Mother of the Vedas,"
 who entered into the Rishis and inspired them by her revelations;
 just as Bath-Kol is said to have inspired the prophets of Israel
 and the Jewish High-Priests. And both exist to this day, in their
 respective sacred symbologies, because the ancients associated
 sound or Speech with the Ether of Space, of which Sound is the
 characteristic. Hence Fire, Water and Air are the primordial Cosmic
 Trinity. "I am thy Thought, thy God, more ancient than the
 moist principle, the <em>light that radiates within Darkness </em>(Chaos),
 and the shining <em>Word </em>of God (Sound) is the Son of the
 Deity." ("Pymander," § 6.)*
 </p><p>
 Thus we have to study well the "Primary creation," before
 we can understand the Secondary. The first Race had three <em>rudimentary
 </em>elements in it; and <em>no fire </em>as yet; because, with
 the Ancients, the evolution of man, and the growth and development
 of his spiritual and physical senses, were subordinate to the
 evolution of the elements on the Cosmic plane of this Earth. All
 proceeds from <em>Prabhavapyaya, </em>the evolution of the creative
 and sentient principles in the gods, and even of the so-called
 creative deity himself. This is found in the names and appellations
 given to Vishnu in exoteric scriptures. As the <em>Protologos
 </em>(the<em> </em>Orphic), he is called <em>Purvaja, </em>"pregenetic,"
 and then the other names connect him in their descending order
 more and more with matter.
 </p><p>
 The following order on parallel lines may be found in the evolution
 of the Elements and the Senses; or in Cosmic terrestrial "MAN"
 or "Spirit," and mortal physical man: --
 </p><blockquote>
 1. Ether ... Hearing ... Sound.<br>
 2. Air ... Touch ... Sound and Touch.<br>
 3. Fire, or Light ... Sight ... Sound, Touch and Colour.<br>
 4. Water ... Taste ... Sound, Touch, Colour and Taste.<br>
 <em>5.</em> Earth ... Smell ... Sound, Touch, Colour, Taste and
 Smell.
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 As seen, each Element adds to its own characteristics, those of
 its

 predecessor; as each Root-Race adds the characterizing sense of
 the preceding Race. The same is true in the <em>septenary </em>creation
 of man, who evolves gradually in seven stages, and on the same
 principles, as will be shown further on.
 </p><p>
 Thus, while Gods or Dhyan Chohans (Devas) proceed from the First
 Cause -- which is not Parabrahm, for the latter is the ALL CAUSE,
 and cannot be referred to as the "<em>First </em>Cause,"
 -- which First Cause is called in the Brahmanical Books Jagad-Yoni,
 "the womb of the world," mankind emanates from these
 active agents in Kosmos. But men, during the first and the second
 races, were not physical beings, but merely <em>rudiments </em>of
 the future men: <em>Bhutas, </em>which proceeded from Bhutadi,
 "origin," or the "original place whence sprung
 the Elements." Hence they proceeded with all the rest from
 <em>Prabhavapyaya, </em>"the place whence is the origination,
 and into which is the resolution of all things," as explained
 by the Commentator. Whence also our physical senses. Whence even
 the highest "created" deity itself, in our philosophy.
 As one with the Universe, whether we call him Brahma, Iswara,
 or Purusha, he is a manifested deity, -- hence created, or limited
 and conditioned. This is easily proven, even from the exoteric
 teachings.
 </p><p>
 After being called the <em>incognizable, </em>eternal Brahma (neuter
 or abstract), the Punda-Rikaksha, "supreme and imperishable
 glory," once that instead of <em>Sadaika-Rupa, </em>"changeless"
 or "immutable" Nature, he is addressed as <em>Ekanaka-Rupa,
 </em>"both single and manifold," he, the cause, becomes
 merged with his own effects; and his names, if placed in esoteric
 order, show the following descending scale: --
 </p><blockquote>
 1. Mahapurusha or Paramatman ... Supreme Spirit.<br>
 <em>2.</em> Atman or Purvaja (Protologos) ...The living Spirit
 of Nature. <br>
 3. Indriyatman, or Hrishikesa ..........Spiritual or intellectual
 soul (One with the senses).<br>
 5. Bhutatman ................................ . The living, or
 Life Soul.<br>
 6. Kshetrajna .................................. Embodied soul,
 or the Universe of Spirit and Matter. <br>
 7. Bhrantidarsanatah .........................False perception
 -- Material Universe.
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 The last name means something perceived or conceived of, owing
 to false and erroneous apprehension, as a material form; but,
 in fact, only <em>Maya, </em>illusion, as all is in our physical
 universe.
 </p><p>
 It is in strict analogy with ITS attributes in both the spiritual
 and material worlds, that the evolution of the Dhyan Chohanic
 Essences takes place; the characteristics of the latter being
 reflected, in their turn, in <em>Man, </em>collectively, and in
 each of his principles; <em>every one of which contains in itself,
 in the same progressive order, a portion of their various </em>"<em>fires</em>"<em>
 and elements.</em></p><hr>
