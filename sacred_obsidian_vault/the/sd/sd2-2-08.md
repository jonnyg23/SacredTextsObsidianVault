 <h4>ENOICHION-HENOCH.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>T</strong>HE history of the evolution of the Satanic myth
 would not be complete if we omitted to notice the character of
 the mysterious and Cosmopolitan Enoch, variously called Enos,
 Hanoch, and finally Enoichion by the Greeks. It is from his Book
 that the first notions of the Fallen Angels were taken by the
 early Christian writers.
 </p><p>
 The "Book of Enoch" is declared apocryphal. But what
 is an <em>Apocrypha? </em>The very etymology of the term shows
 that it is simply a <em>secret </em>book<em>, i.e.</em>, one that
 belonged to the catalogue of temple libraries under the guardianship
 of the Hierophants and initiated priests, and was never meant
 for the profane. <em>Apocrypha </em>comes from the verb <em>Crypto,
 [[krupto]], "to hide." </em>For ages the <em>Enoichion
 </em>(the Book of the <strong>S</strong>EER) was preserved in
 the "city of letters" and secret works -- the ancient
 Kirjath-Sepher, later on, Debir (see <em>Joshua</em> xv<em>.,
 </em>15).
 </p><p>
 Some of the writers interested in the subject -- especially Masons
 -- have tried to identify Enoch with Thoth of Memphis, the Greek
 Hermes, and even with the Latin Mercury. As individuals, all these
 are distinct one from the other; professionally -- if one may
 use this word, now so limited in its sense -- they belong one
 and all to the same category of sacred writers, of Initiators
 and Recorders of Occult and ancient Wisdom. Those who in the <em>Kuran
 </em>(see Surat <strong>XIX.</strong>) are generically termed
 the <em>Edris, </em>or the "Learned" (the Initiated),
 bore in Egypt the name of "Thoth," the inventor of arts,
 sciences, <em>writing</em> or letters, of music and astronomy.
 Among the Jews the <em>Edris </em>became "Enoch," who,
 according to Bar-Hebraeus, "was the first inventor of writing,"
 books, arts, and sciences, the first who reduced to a system the
 progress of the planets. In Greece he was called Orpheus, and
 thus changed his name with every nation. The number Seven being
 attached to, and connected with, each of those primitive Initiators,*
 as well as the number 365, of the days in the year, astronomically,
 it identifies the mission, character, and the sacred office of
 all those men, but certainly not their personalities. Enoch is
 the <em>seventh </em>Patriarch; Orpheus is the possessor of the
 <em>phorminx, </em>the 7-stringed lyre, which is the seven-fold
 mystery of initiation. Thoth, with the seven-rayed Solar Discus
 on his head, travels in the Solar boat, the 365 degrees, jumping
 out every fourth (leap) year for one day. Finally, Thoth-Lunus
 is the septenary

 * Khanoch, or Hanoch, or Enoch means the "Initiator"
 and "teacher," as well as the "Son of Man,"

 <p>
 god of the seven days, or the week. Esoterically and spiritually,
 <em>Enoichion </em>means the "Seer of the Open Eye."
 </p><p>
 The story about Enoch, told by Josephus, namely, that he had concealed
 under the pillars of Mercury or Seth his precious rolls or books,
 is the same as that told of Hermes, "the father of Wisdom,"
 who concealed his books of Wisdom under a pillar, and then, finding
 the two pillars of stone, found the science written thereon. Yet
 Josephus, notwithstanding his constant efforts in the direction
 of Israel's unmerited glorification, and though he does attribute
 that science (of Wisdom) to the <em>Jewish</em> Enoch<em> -- </em>writes<em>
 history. </em>He shows those pillars as still existing during
 his own time. He tells us that they were built by Seth; and so
 they may have been, only neither by the Patriarch of that name,
 the fabled son of Adam, nor by the Egyptian god of Wisdom -- Teth,
 Set, Thoth, Tat, Sat (the later <em>Sat-an</em>)<em>, </em>or
 Hermes, who are all one, -- but by the "sons of the Serpent-god,"
 or "Sons of the Dragon," the name under which the Hierophants
 of Egypt and Babylon were known before the Deluge, as were their
 forefathers, the Atlanteans.
 </p><p>
 What Josephus tells us, therefore, must be <em>allegorically </em>true,
 with the exception of the application made of it. According to
 his version the two famous pillars were entirely covered with
 hieroglyphics, which, after the discovery, were copied and reproduced
 in the most secret corners of the inner temples of Egypt, and
 have thus become the source of its Wisdom and exceptional learning.
 These two "pillars," however, are the prototypes of
 the two "tables of stones" hewn by Moses at the command
 of the "Lord." Hence, in saying that all the great adepts
 and mystics of antiquity -- like Orpheus, Hesiod, Pythagoras and
 Plato -- got the elements of their theology from those hieroglyphics,
 he is right in one sense, and wrong in another; for he errs in
 accuracy. The Secret Doctrine teaches us that the arts, sciences,
 theology, and especially the philosophy of every nation which
 preceded the last <em>universally known, </em>but not universal
 Deluge, had been recorded ideographically from the primitive oral
 records of the Fourth Race, and that these were the inheritance
 of the latter from the early Third Root-Race before the allegorical
 Fall. Hence, also, the Egyptian pillars, the tablets, and even
 the "white Oriental porphyry stone" of the Masonic legend
 -- which Enoch, fearing that the real and precious secrets would
 be lost, concealed before the Deluge in the bowels of the Earth
 -- were simply the more or less symbolical and allegorical copies
 from the primitive Records. The "Book of Enoch" is one
 of such copies and is a Chaldean, now very incomplete compendium.
 As already said, <em>Enoichion </em>means in Greek the "inner
 eye," or the Seer; in Hebrew, and with the <em>help of Masoretic
 </em>points it means the initiator and instructor, <img src="sd2-530.gif" align="BOTTOM">.
 It is a generic title; besides which his legend is</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 531 THE ADEPT DIES BUT TO LIVE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 that of several other prophets, Jewish and heathen, with changes
 of made-up details, the root-form being the same. Elijah is also
 taken up into Heaven <em>alive</em>; and the astrologer, at the
 court of Isdubar, the Chaldean <em>Hea</em>-bani, is likewise
 raised to heaven by the god Hea, who was <em>his </em>patron,
 as Jehovah was of Elijah (whose name means in Hebrew "God-Jah,"
 Jehovah, <img src="sd2-531.gif" align="BOTTOM">), and again of
 <em>Elihu, </em>which has the same meaning. This kind of easy
 death, or <em>euthanasia,</em> has an esoteric meaning. It symbolises
 the death of any adept who has reached the power and degree, as
 also the purification, which enable him to die only in the physical
 body and <em>still live and lead a conscious life </em>in his
 astral body. The variations on this theme are endless, but the
 secret meaning is ever the same. The Pauline expression (Hebrews
 xi. 5) "that he should not see death" -- <em>ut non
 videret mortem -- </em>has thus an esoteric meaning, but nothing
 <em>supernatural </em>in it. The mangled interpretation given
 of some Biblical hints to the effect that Enoch, "whose years
 will equal those of the world," (of the <em>Solar</em> year<em>,
 </em>365 days,) will share with Christ and the prophet Elijah
 the honours and bliss of the last advent and of the destruction
 of Antichrist -- signify, <em>esoterically, </em>that some of
 the great adepts will return in the Seventh Race, when all Error
 will be made away with, and the advent of <strong>T</strong>RUTH
 will be heralded by those <em>Sishta, </em>the holy "Sons
 of Light."
 </p><p>
 The Latin church is not always logical, nor prudent either. She
 declares the "Book of Enoch" an apocrypha, and has gone
 so far as to claim, through Cardinal Cajetan and other luminaries
 of the Church, the rejection from the Canon of even the Book of
 Jude, who, though an <em>inspired </em>apostle, quotes from and
 thus sanctifies the Book of Enoch, which is alleged to be an apocryphal
 work. Fortunately, some of the dogmatics perceived the peril in
 time. Had they accepted Cajetan's resolution, they would have
 been forced to reject likewise the fourth Gospel; as St. John
 borrows literally from Enoch, and places in the mouth of Jesus,
 <em>a whole sentence! </em>(<em>Vide supra, </em>ยง<em> </em><strong>XVIII</strong>.,
 sub-sect. A, about the sheep and the robbers.)
 </p><p>
 Ludolph, the "father of Ethiopic literature," commissioned
 to investigate the various Enochian <strong>MSS</strong>. presented
 by Pereisc, the traveller, to the Mazarine Library, declared that
 "no book of Enoch could exist among the Abyssinians"!
 Further researches and discoveries worsted his too dogmatic assertion,
 as all know. Bruce and Ruppel found and brought that same work
 from Abyssinia some years later, and Bishop Laurence translated
 it. But Bruce despised it, and scoffed at its contents; as did
 all the rest of the Scientists. He declared it "a <em>Gnostic
 </em>work," in which "the age of giants who devour "
 men -- is given . . . hence it is another <em>"Apocalypsis."
 </em>Giants! another <em>fairy-tale.</em> </p><hr>
 
 <p>
 [[Vol. 2, Page]] 532 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.
 </p><p>
 Such, however, was not the opinion of all the best critics. Dr.
 Hanneberg places the Book of Enoch along with the Third Book of
 the Maccabees, <em>at the head of the list of those whose authority
 stands the</em> <em>nearest to that of the canonical works.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Verily, "where doctors disagree . . ."
 </p><p>
 As usual, however, they were all right and all wrong. To accept
 Enoch as a Biblical character, a single living man, is like accepting
 Adam as the first one. Enoch was a generic title, applied to,
 and borne by, scores of individuals, at all times and ages, and
 in every race and nation. This may be easily inferred from the
 fact that the ancient Talmudists and the teachers of Midrashim
 are not agreed generally in their views about Hanokh, the Son
 of Yered. . . . Some say Enoch was a great Saint, beloved by God,
 and <em>taken alive to heaven </em>(<em>i.e., </em>one who reached
 <em>Mukti</em> or<em> Nirvana, </em>on earth, as Buddha did and
 others still do); and others maintain that he was a sorcerer,
 a wicked magician. This shows only that Enoch, or its equivalent,
 was a term, even during the days of the later Talmudists, which
 meant "Seer," "Adept in the <em>Secret Wisdom</em>,"<em>
 </em>etc., without any specification as to the character of the
 title-bearer. When Josephus, speaking of Elijah and Enoch (Antiquities,
 ix., 2), remarks that "it is written in the sacred books
 they (Elijah and Enoch) disappeared, but so that nobody knew that
 they died," it means simply that <em>they had died in their
 personalities, </em>as Yogis die to this day in India, or even
 some Christian monks to the world. They disappear from the sight
 of men and die -- on the terrestrial plane -- even for themselves.
 A seemingly figurative way of speaking, yet <em>literally true.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 "Hanokh transmitted the science of (astronomical) calculation
 and of computing the seasons to Noah," says the Midrash <em>Pirkah
 </em>R. Eliezar (cap. viii.), referring to Henoch that which others
 did to Hermes Trismegistus, because the two are identical in their
 esoteric meaning. "Hanokh" in this case, and his "Wisdom,"
 belong to the cycle of the Fourth Atlantean Race,* and Noah to
 that of the Fifth.** In this case both represent the Root-Races,
 the present one and the one that preceded it. In another sense,
 Enoch disappeared, "he walked with God, and he was not, for
 God took him," the allegory referring to the disappearance
 of the Sacred and Secret knowledge from among men; for "God"
 (or <em>Java Aleim -- </em>the high hierophants, the heads of
 the colleges of initiated priests***) took him; in other words,
 the Enochs or the <em>Enoichions, </em>the Seers and their knowledge
 and wisdom, became strictly

 * Says the <em>Zohar, </em>"Hanokh had a book which was one
 with the book of the generations of Adam; this is the Mystery
 of Wisdom."
 </p><p>
 ** Noah is heir to the Wisdom of Enoch; in other words, the Fifth
 is heir to the Fourth Race.

 <p>
 confined to the Secret Colleges of the Prophets, with the Jews,
 and to the temples with the Gentiles.
 </p><p>
 Interpreted with the help of merely the symbolical key, Enoch
 is the type of the dual nature of man -- spiritual and physical.
 Hence he occupies the centre of the astronomical cross (given
 by Eliphas Levi from a secret work), which is a six-pointed star,
 "the Adonai." In the upper triangle is the Eagle; in
 the left lower triangle stands the lion; in the right, the bull:
 while between the bull and the lion, over them and under the eagle,
 is the face of Enoch or man. (<em>Vide</em> illustrated diagram
 in <em>Isis Unveiled, </em>Vol. <strong>II</strong>., p. 452).
 Now the figures on the upper triangle represent the Four Races,
 leaving out the first -- the <em>Chhayas </em>or Shadows -- and
 the "Son of Man," <em>Enos </em>or<em> Enoch, </em>is
 in the centre, because he stands between the two (the Fourth and
 the Fifth) Races, as he represents the Secret Wisdom of both.
 These are the four animals of <em>Ezekiel </em>and of the <em>Revelation.
 </em>The same double triangle which in <em>Isis, </em>Vol. <strong>II</strong>,
 (p. 453), faces the Hindu <em>Adanari, </em>is by far the best.
 For there, only the three (for us) historical races are symbolized:
 the third, the androgynous, by Ada-nari; the fourth, symbolized
 by the strong, powerful lion; and the fifth -- the Aryan -- by
 that which is its most sacred symbol to this day, the bull (and
 the cow).
 </p><p>
 A man of great erudition -- a French savant -- M. de Sacy, finds
 several most singular statements in the Book of Enoch, "worthy
 of the most serious examination," he says. For instance,
 "the author (Enoch) makes the solar year consist of 364 days,
 and seems to know periods of three, of five, and of eight years,
 followed by <em>four</em> supplementary days, which, in his system,
 appear to be those of the equinoxes and solstices."* . .
 . . To which he adds, later on, "I see but one means to palliate
 them (these 'absurdities'), it is to suppose that the author expounds
 some <em>fanciful </em>system which <em>may have existed </em>BEFORE
 THE ORDER OF <strong>N</strong>ATURE HAD BEEN ALTERED AT THE PERIOD
 OF THE <strong>U</strong>NIVERSAL <strong>D</strong>ELUGE."
 </p><p>
 Precisely so; and the Secret Doctrine teaches that that "order
 of nature" has been thus altered, and the series of the Earth's
 humanities too. For, as the angel <em>Uriel </em>tells Enoch:
 "Behold, I have showed thee all things, O Enoch; and all
 things have I revealed to thee. Thou seest the Sun, the Moon,
 and <em>those which conduct the stars </em>in Heaven, which cause
 all their operations, seasons, and arrivals to return. In the
 <em>days</em> <em>of sinners </em>THE YEARS SHALL BE SHORTENED
 . . . . the moon shall change its laws, etc." (chap. lxxix).
 In those days also, years before the great Deluge that carried
 away the Atlanteans and changed the face of the whole earth --
 because "the <em>earth </em>(on its axis) <em>became inclined"
 </em>--
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * See Danielo's criticisms upon De Sacy, in the <em>Annales de
 Philosophic, </em>p. 393.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 534 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 nature, geologically, astronomically, and cosmically in general,
 could not have been the same, just because the Earth <em>had inclined.
 </em>See chap. 1xiv. (Sect. xi.) . . . . "And Noah cried
 with a bitter voice 'Hear me, hear me, hear me'; three times.
 And he said 'The earth labours and is violently inclined; surely,
 I shall perish with it.' "
 </p><p>
 This, by the way, looks like one of those many "inconsistencies,"
 if the Bible is read literally. For, to say the least, this is
 a very strange fear in one who had "found grace in the eyes
 of the Lord" and been told to build an ark! But here we find
 the venerable Patriarch expressing as much fear as if, instead
 of a "friend" of God, he had been one of the Giants
 doomed by the wrathful deity. The earth has already <em>inclined,
 </em>and the deluge of waters has become simply a question of
 time, and yet Noah seems to know nothing of his intended salvation.
 </p><p>
 A decree had come indeed; the decree of nature and the Law of
 Evolution, that the earth should change its race, and that the
 Fourth Race should be destroyed to make room for a better one.
 The Manvantara had reached its turning point of <em>three and
 a half </em>Rounds, and gigantic physical Humanity had reached
 the acme of gross materiality. Hence the apocalyptic verse that
 speaks of a commandment gone forth that they may be destroyed,
 "that <em>their end may be" </em>(of the race); for
 they <em>knew</em> truly "every secret of the angels, every
 oppressive and secret power of the <em>Satans, </em>and every
 power of those who commit sorcery, as well as of those who make
 molten images in the whole earth."
 </p><p>
 And now a natural question. Who could have informed the apocryphal
 author of this powerful vision (to whatever age he may be assigned
 before the day of Galileo) that <em>the Earth could occasionally</em>
 <em>incline her axis? </em>Whence has he derived such astronomical
 and geological knowledge if the Secret Wisdom, of which the ancient
 Rishis and Pythagoras had drunk, is but a fancy, an invention
 of the later ages? Has Enoch read prophetically perchance in Frederick
 Klee's work on the Deluge (p. 79) these lines: "The position
 of the terrestrial globe with reference to the Sun has evidently
 been, in primitive times, different from what it is now; and this
 difference must have been caused by a displacement of the axis
 of rotation of the Earth."?
 </p><p>
 This reminds one of that other <em>unscientific </em>statement
 made by the Egyptian priests to Herodotus, namely, that the Sun
 has not always risen where it arises <em>now,</em> and that in
 former times the ecliptic had cut the equator at right angles.*
 </p><p>
 There are many such "dark sayings" throughout Puranas,
 Bible and Mythology; and to the occultist they divulge two facts:
 (<em>a</em>) that the ancients knew as well, and better, perhaps,
 than the moderns

 <p>
 do, astronomy, geognosy and cosmography in general; and (<em>b</em>)
 that the globe and its behaviour have altered more than once since
 the primitive state of things. Thus, on the <em>blind</em> faith
 of <em>his</em> "ignorant" religion, which taught that
 Phaeton, in his desire to learn the <em>hidden </em>truth, made
 the Sun deviate from its usual course -- Xenophantes asserts somewhere
 that, "the Sun turned toward another country"; which
 is a parallel, however slightly more scientific, if as bold, of
 Joshua stopping the course of the Sun altogether. Yet it may explain
 the teaching of the Northern mythology (in Jeruskoven) that, before
 the <em>actual order</em> of things, the Sun arose in the South,
 and its placing the Frigid Zone in the East, whereas now it is
 in the North.
 </p><p>
 The Book of Enoch, in short, is a <em>resume, </em>a compound
 of the main features of the History of the Third, Fourth and Fifth
 Races; a very few prophecies from the present age of the world;
 a long retrospective, introspective and prophetic summary of universal
 and quite <em>historical</em> events -- geological, ethnological,
 astronomical, and psychic -- with a touch of theogony out of the
 antediluvian records. The Book of this mysterious personage is
 referred to and quoted copiously in the <em>Pistis</em> <em>Sophia,
 </em>and also in the <em>Zohar </em>and its most ancient Midrashim.
 Origen and Clement of Alexandria held it in the highest esteem.
 To say, therefore, that it is a post-Christian forgery is to utter
 an absurdity and to become guilty of an anachronism, since Origen,
 among others, lived in the second century of the Christian era,
 yet he mentions it as an ancient and venerable work. The secret
 and sacred name and its potency are well and clearly though allegorically
 described in the old volume. From the <strong>XVIII</strong>th
 to the Lth chapter, the Visions of Enoch are all descriptive of
 the Mysteries of Initiation, one of which is the Burning Valley
 of the "Fallen Angels."
 </p><p>
 Perhaps St. Augustine was quite right in saying that the Church
 rejected the <strong>B</strong>OOK OF <strong>E</strong>NOCH out
 of her canon owing to its too great antiquity, <em>ob nimiam antiquitatem.</em>*<em>
 </em>There was no room for the events noticed in it within the
 limit of the 4004 years <strong>B.C</strong>. assigned to the
 world from its "creation"!
