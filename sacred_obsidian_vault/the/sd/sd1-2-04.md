 CHAOS -- THEOS -- KOSMOS.</h4>

 <strong>T</strong>HESE three are the containment of Space; or,
 as a learned Kabalist has defined it, "Space, the all containing
 uncontained, is the primary embodiment of simply Unity. . . .
 boundless extension."* But, he asks again, "boundless
 extension of what?" -- and makes the correct reply -- "The<em>
 unknown container of all</em>,<em> the Unknown FIRST CAUSE.</em>"<em>
 </em>This is a most correct definition and answer, most esoteric
 and true, from every aspect of occult teaching.
 </p><p>
 <em>SPACE</em><b>,</b><em> </em>which, in their ignorance and
 iconoclastic tendency to destroy every philosophic idea of old,
 the modern wiseacres have proclaimed "an abstract idea"
 and a <em>void</em>,<em> </em>is, in reality, the container and
 <em>the body of the Universe </em>with its seven principles. It
 is a body of limitless extent, whose <em>PRINCIPLES</em>,<em>
 </em>in Occult phraseology -- each being in its turn a septenary
 -- manifest in our phenomenal world only the grossest fabric of
 <em>their sub-divisions. </em>"No one has ever seen the Elements
 in their fulness," the Doctrine teaches. We have to search
 for our Wisdom in the original expressions of the primeval people
 and in their synonyms. Even the latest of them -- the Jews --
 show in their Kabalistic teachings this idea, <em>e.g</em>., the
 seven-headed Serpent of Space, called "the great Sea."
 "In the beginning, the <em>Alhim </em>created the heavens
 and the earth; the 6 (Sephiroth). . . . They created six, and
 on these all things are based. And those (six) depend upon <em>the
 seven forms of the cranium </em>up<em> </em>to Dignity of all
 Dignities (<em>Siphrah Dzenioota</em>, i,<em> </em>ยง 16),
 see part ii., vol. ii. "Ancient Divisions and the Mystic
 Numbers."
 </p><p>
 Now <em>Wind</em>,<em> Air and Spirit </em>have ever been synonymous
 with every nation. Pneuma (Spirit) and Anemos (the wind) with
 the Greeks, <em>Spiritus </em>and<em> Ventus </em>with the Latins,
 were convertible terms even if dissociated from the original idea
 of the breath of life. In the "Forces" of Science we
 see but the <em>material effect of the spiritual affect </em>of
 one or the other of the four primordial Elements, transmitted
 to us by the 4th Race, as we shall transmit Ether (or rather the
 gross subdivision of it) in its fulness to the Sixth Root Race.
 This is explained in the text of this and the following Book.
 </p><p>
 "Chaos" is called <em>senseless </em>by the ancients,
 because it represented and contained in itself (Chaos and Space
 being synonymous) all the Elements in their rudimentary, undifferentiated
 State. They made of Ether, the fifth element, the synthesis of
 the other four; for the AEther of the Greek philosophers is not
 its dregs -- of which indeed they knew more

 <p>
 than science does now -- which are rightly enough supposed to
 act as an agent for many forces that manifest on Earth. Their
 AEther was the <em>Akasa </em>of the Hindus; the Ether accepted
 in physics is but one of its subdivisions, on our plane, -- the
 <em>Astral Light </em>of the Kabalists with all its <em>evil </em>as
 well as good effects.
 </p><p>
 On account of the Essence of AEther, or the Unseen Space, being
 held divine as the supposed veil of Deity, it was regarded as
 the medium between this life and the next one. The ancients considered
 that when the directing active "Intelligences" (the
 gods) retired from any portion of Ether <em>in our Space</em>
 --<em> </em>the four realms which they superintend -- then that
 particular place was left in the possession of evil, so called
 by reason of the absence of the <em>Good </em>from it.
 </p><blockquote>
 "The existence of spirit in the common mediator, the ether,
 is denied by materialism; while theology makes of it a personal
 god. But the Kabalist holds that both are wrong, saying that in
 ether, the elements represent but matter -- the blind cosmic forces
 of nature; while Spirit represents the intelligence which directs
 them. The Aryan, Hermetic, Orphic, and Pythagorean cosmogonical
 doctrines, as well as those of Sanchoniathon and Berosus, are
 all based upon one irrefutable formula, viz., that the aether
 and chaos, or, in the Platonic language, mind and matter, were
 the two primeval and eternal principles of the universe, utterly
 independent of anything else. The former was the all-vivifying
 intellectual principle; the chaos, a shapeless liquid principle,
 without 'form or sense,' from the union of which two sprung into
 existence the universe, or rather the universal world, the first
 androgynous deity -- the chaotic matter becoming its body, and
 ether its soul. According to the phraseology of a<i> Fragment
 of Hermias</i>,<i> </i>'chaos, from this union with spirit, obtaining
 <i>sense</i>,<i> </i>shone with pleasure, and thus was produced
 the <i>Protogonos </i>(the first-born) light.'* This is the universal
 trinity, based on the metaphysical conceptions of the ancients,
 who, reasoning by analogy, made of man, who is a compound of intellect
 and matter, the microcosm of the macrocosm, or great universe."
 (<i>Isis Unveiled.</i>)
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 "<em>Nature abhors Vacuum</em>"<em> </em>said the Peripatetics,
 who comprehended perhaps, though materialists in their way, why
 Democritus, with his instructor Leucippus, taught that the first
 principles of all things contained in the Universe were atoms
 and a <em>vacuum. </em>The latter means simply <em>latent </em>Deity
 or force; which, before its first manifestation when it became
 WILL -- communicating the first impulse to these atoms -- was
 the great <em>Nothingness</em>,<em> </em>Ain-Soph, or NO-THING;
 was, therefore, to every sense, a Void -- or <strong>C</strong>HAOS.
 </p><p>
 That Chaos, however, became the "Soul of the World,"
 according to Plato and the Pythagoreans. According to Hindu teaching,
 Deity in the shape of AEther (Akasa) pervades all things; and
 it was called there-

 <p>
 fore by the theurgists "the living fire," the "Spirit
 of Light," and sometimes <em>Magnes. </em>It was the highest
 Deity itself which, according to Plato, built the Universe in
 the geometrical form of the Dodecahedron; and its "first
 begotten" was born of Chaos and Primordial Light (the Central
 Sun). This "First-Born," however, was only the aggregate
 of the Host of the "Builders," the first constructive
 Forces, who are called in ancient Cosmogonies the <em>Ancients
 </em>(born of the Deep, or Chaos) and the "First Point."
 He is the Tetragrammaton, so-called, at the head of the Seven
 lower Sephiroth. This was the belief of the Chaldees. "These
 Chaldeans," writes Philo, the Jew, speaking very flippantly
 of the first instructors of his ancestors, "were of opinion
 that the Kosmos, <em>among the things that exist </em>(?)<em>
 </em>is a single point, either being itself God (Theos) or that
 in it is God, comprehending the soul of all things." (See
 his "<em>Migration of Abraham</em>," 32<em>.</em>)
 </p><p>
 Chaos-Theos-Kosmos are but the three aspects of their synthesis
 -- SPACE. One can never hope to solve the mystery of this <em>Tetraktis
 by </em>holding to the dead-letter even of the old philosophies,
 as now extant. But, even in these CHAOS-THEOS-KOSMOS = SPACE,
 are identified in all Eternity, as the One Unknown Space, the
 last word about which will, perhaps, never be known before our
 seventh Round. Nevertheless, the allegories and metaphysical symbols
 about the primeval and <em>perfect </em>CUBE, are remarkable even
 in the exoteric Puranas.
 </p><p>
 There, also, Brahma is the <em>Theos</em>,<em> </em>evolving out
 of <em>Chaos</em>,<em> </em>or the great "Deep," the
 waters, over which Spirit = SPACE, personified by <em>ayana </em>--
 the Spirit moving over the face of the future boundless Kosmos
 -- is silently hovering, in the first hour of re-awakening. It
 is also Vishnu, sleeping on Ananta-Sesha, the great Serpent of
 Eternity, of which Western theology, ignorant of the Kabala, the
 only key that opens the secrets of the Bible, has made -- the
 Devil. It is the first <em>triangle </em>or the Pythagorean <em>triad</em>,<em>
 </em>the "God of the <em>three </em>Aspects," before
 it is transformed through its perfect quadrature of the infinite
 Circle into the "four-faced Brahma."
 </p><p>
 "Of him who is and yet is not, from the not-being, Eternal
 Cause, is born the Being-Purusha," says Manu, the legislator.
 </p><p>
 In<em> Isis Unveiled</em>,<em> </em>it is said that: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "In the Egyptian mythology, Kneph, the Eternal <i>Unrevealed
 </i>God, is represented by a snake emblem of Eternity encircling
 a water urn, with its head hovering over the waters, which it
 incubates with its breath. In this case the serpent is the Agathodaemon,
 the good spirit: in its opposite aspect, it is the Kakodaemon
 -- the bad one. In the Scandinavian <i>Eddas</i>,<i> </i>the honey
 dew, the fruit of the gods and of the creative busy Yggdrasill
 (bees), falls during the hours of night, when the atmosphere is
 impregnated with humidity; and in the Northern mythologies, as
 the passive principle of creation, it typifies the

 creation of the universe <i>out of water; </i>this dew is the
 astral light in one of its combinations, and possesses creative
 as well as destructive properties. In the Chaldean legend of Berosus,
 Oannes or Dagon, the man-fish, instructing the people, shows the
 infant world created out of <i>water</i>,<i> </i>and all beings
 originating from this <i>prima materia. </i>Moses teaches that
 only earth and <i>water </i>can bring a living soul: and we read
 in the Scriptures that herbs could not grow until the Eternal
 caused it to <i>rain </i>upon earth. In the Mexican <i>Popol-Vuh</i>,<i>
 </i>man is created out of <i>mud </i>or clay (<i>terre glaise</i>),<i>
 </i>taken from under the water. Brahma creates the great Muni
 (or first man) seated on his lotus, only after having called into
 being <i>spirits </i>who thus enjoyed over mortals a priority
 of existence, and he creates him out of <i>water</i>,<i> air </i>and<i>
 earth. </i>Alchemists claim that the primordial or pre-Adamic
 earth, when reduced to its first substance, is in its <i>second
 </i>stage of transformation like clear water, the first being
 the <i>alkahest </i>proper. This primordial substance is said
 to contain within itself the essence of all that goes to make
 up man; it has not only all the elements of his physical being,
 but even the "breath of life" itself in a latent state,
 ready to be awakened. This it derives from the "incubation"
 of the "Spirit of God" upon the face of the waters --
 CHAOS: in fact, this substance is chaos itself. From this it was
 that Paracelsus claimed to be able to make his "homunculi;"
 and this is why Thales, the great natural philosopher, maintained
 that <i>water </i>was the principle of all things in nature.*
 . . . Job says, in chap. xxvi. 5, that "dead things are formed
 from under the waters, and inhabitants thereof." In the original
 text, instead of "dead things," it is written dead <i>Rephaim
 </i>(giants or mighty primitive men), from whom "Evolution"
 may one day trace our present race."

 "In the primordial state of the creation," says Polier's
 <em>Mythologie des Indous</em>,<em> </em>"the rudimental
 universe, submerged in water, reposed in the bosom of Vishnu.
 Sprung from this chaos and darkness, Brahma, the architect of
 the world, poised on a lotus-leaf, floated (moved) upon the waters,
 unable to discern anything but water and darkness." Perceiving
 such a dismal state of things, Brahma soliloquises in consternation:
 "Who am I? Whence came I?" Then he hears a voice:**
 "Direct your thoughts to Bhagavat." Brahma, rising from
 his natatory position, seats himself upon the lotus in an attitude
 of contemplation, and reflects upon the Eternal, who, pleased
 with this evidence of piety, disperses the primeval darkness and
 opens his understanding. "After this Brahma issues from the
 universal egg (infinite chaos) as <em>light</em>,<em> </em>for
 his understanding is now opened, and he sets himself to work:
 he <em>moves </em>on the eternal waters, with the spirit of God
 within himself; and in his capacity of <em>mover </em>of the waters
 he is Vishnu, or <em>Narayana.</em>"<em> </em>This is

 * With the Greeks, the "River-gods," all of them the
 Sons of the primeval ocean (Chaos in its masculine aspect), were
 the respective ancestors of the Hellenic races. For them the <strong>O</strong>CEAN
 was the father of the Gods; and thus they had anticipated in this
 connection the theories of Thales, as rightly observed by Aristotle
 (Metaph. I., 3, 5).

 exoteric, of course, yet in its main idea as identical as possible
 with the Egyptian cosmogony, which shows in its opening sentences
 Athtor,* or Mother Night (which represents illimitable darkness),
 as the primeval element which covered the infinite abyss, animated
 by water and the universal spirit of the Eternal, dwelling alone
 in Chaos. Similarly in the Jewish Scriptures, the history of the
 creation opens with the spirit of God and his creative emanation
 -- another Deity.**
 </p><p>
 The Zohar teaches that it is the primordial elements -- the trinity
 of Fire, Air and Water -- the four cardinal points, and all the
 Forces of Nature, which form collectively the <strong>V</strong>OICE
 of the <strong>W</strong>ILL <em>Memrab</em>,<em> </em>or<em>
 </em>the "Word," the Logos of the Absolute Silent ALL.
 "The indivisible point, limitless and unknowable" spreads
 itself over the endless space, and thus forms a veil (the Mulaprakriti
 of Parabraham) which conceals this Absolute point. (<em>Vide infra</em>)<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 In the cosmogonies of all the nations it is the "Architects"
 synthesized by Demiurgos (in the Bible the "Elohim"),
 who fashion Kosmos out of Chaos, and who are the collective <em>Theos</em>,
 "male-female," Spirit and matter. "By a series
 (<em>yom</em>)<em> </em>of foundations (<em>hasoth</em>)<em> </em>the
 Alhim caused earth and heaven to be" (Gen. ii., 4). In the
 Bible it is first <em>Alhim</em>,<em> </em>then Jahva-Alhim, and
 finally Jehovah --after the separation of the sexes in chapter
 iv. of Genesis. It is noticeable that nowhere, except in the later,
 the <em>last </em>Cosmogonies of our Fifth race, is the ineffable
 and unutterable <strong>N</strong>AME*** -- the symbol of the
 Unknown Deity, which was used only in the <strong>M</strong>YSTERIES
 -- used in connection with the "Creation" of the Universe.
 It is the "Movers," the "Runners," the <em>theoi
 </em>(from<em> </em>[[<em>theein</em>]], "to run"),
 who do the work of formation, the "Messengers" of the
 manvantaric law, who have now become in Christianity the "messengers"
 (malachim); and it seems the same in Hinduism or early Brahmanism.
 For it is not Brahma who creates in the <em>Rig Veda</em>,<em>
 </em>but the Prajapati, the "Lords of Being," who are
 the <em>Rishis; </em>the word <em>Rishi </em>(according to Professor
 Mahadeo Kunte) being connected with the word to move, to lead
 on, applied to them in their terrestrial character, when, as Patriarchs,
 they lead their hosts on the Seven Rivers.
 </p><p>
 Moreover, the very word "God" in the singular, embracing
 all the gods -- or <em>theos </em>from <em>theoi</em> -- came
 to the "superior" civilized nations from a strange source,
 one entirely and as pre-eminently <em>phallic</em> as the

 sincere, open-spoken <em>lingham </em>of India. The attempt to
 derive God from the Anglo-Saxon synonym "good" is an
 abandoned idea, for in no other language, in all of which the
 term varies more or less, from the Persian Khoda down to the Latin
 <em>Deus</em>,<em> </em>has an instance been found of a name of
 God being derived from the attribute of <em>Goodness. </em>To
 the Latin races it comes from the Aryan <em>Dyaus </em>(the Day);
 to the Slavonian, from the Greek Bacchus (<em>Bagh-bog</em>);<em>
 </em>and to the Saxon races directly from the Hebrew <em>Yodh
 </em>or<em> Jod. </em>The latter is <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="MIDDLE">,
 the number-letter 10, male and female, and Jod the phallic <em>hook:</em>
 --<em> </em>hence the Saxon <em>Godh</em>,<em> </em>the Germanic
 <em>Gott</em>,<em> </em>and the English <em>God. </em>This symbolic
 term may be said to represent the Creator of physical "Humanity,"
 on the <em>terrestrial </em>plane; but surely it had nothing to
 do with the formation or "Creation" of Spirit, gods,
 or Kosmos!
 </p><p>
 Chaos-Theos-Kosmos, the triple deity, is <em>all in all. </em>Therefore,
 it is said to be male and female, good and evil, positive and
 negative: the whole series of contrasted qualities. When latent
 (in pralaya) it is incognizable and becomes the <em>unknowable
 Deity. </em>It can be known only in its active functions; hence
 as <em>matter-Force </em>and<em> living Spirit</em>,<em> </em>the
 correlations and outcome, or the expression, on the visible plane,
 of the ultimate and ever-to-be unknown UNITY.
 </p><p>
 In its turn this triple unit is the producer of the four primary
 "Elements,"* which are known in our visible terrestrial
 nature as the seven (so far the <em>five</em>) Elements, each
 divisible into forty-nine (or seven times seven) sub-elements,
 with about seventy of which Chemistry is acquainted. Every Cosmical
 Element such as Fire, Air, Water, Earth, partaking of the qualities
 and defects of their Primaries, are in their nature Good and Evil,
 Force (or Spirit) and Matter, etc., etc.; and each, therefore,
 is at one and the same time Life and Death, Health and Disease,
 Action and Reaction. (<em>See Section XIV.</em>,<em> </em>"<em>The
 Four Elements.</em>")<em> </em>They are ever and constantly
 forming matter under the never-ceasing impulse of the <strong>O</strong>NE
 Element (the <em>incognizable</em>),<em> </em>represented in the
 world of phenomena by 'AEther, or "the immortal gods who
 give birth and life to all."
 </p><p>
 In "the Philosophical writings of Solomon Ben Yehudah Ibn
 Gebirol" (translated in Mr. Isaac Myer's <em>Kabbalah</em>,<em>
 </em>just published) it is said on the structure of the Universe,
 "R. Yehudah began, it is written: -- 'Elohim said: Let there
 be a firmament in the midst of the waters.' Come, see, at the
 time that the Holy. . . . created the World, He

 * The Cosmic Tabernacle of Moses, erected by him in the Desert,
 was <em>square</em>,<em> </em>representing the four cardinal points
 and the four Elements, as Josephus tells his readers (<em>Antiq.
 1</em>,<em> viii ch.</em>,<em> xxii.</em>)<em> </em>It is the
 idea taken from the pyramids in Egypt and in Tyre, where the pyramids
 became pillars, the Genii, or Angels have their abodes in the
 four respective points (See ยง<em> xiv.; </em>"<em>The
 Four Elements.</em>") </p><hr>

 created 7 heavens above, 7 earths below, 7 seas, 7 days, 7 rivers,
 7 weeks, 7 years, 7 times, and 7,000 years that the world has
 been. The Holy <em>is the seventh </em>of all," etc. (p.
 415).
 </p><p>
 This, besides showing a strange identity with the cosmogony of
 the Puranas (<em>e.g</em>., Vishnu Purana 1st Book), corroborates
 with regard to number seven, all our teachings as briefly given
 in "Esoteric Buddhism."
 </p><p>
 The Hindus have an endless series of allegories to express this
 idea. In the primordial Chaos, before it became developed into
 the <em>Seven Oceans </em>(Sapta Samudra) -- emblematical of the
 <em>seven gunas </em>(conditioned qualities) composed of <em>trigunas
 </em>(Satwa, Rajas and Tamas, see Puranas) -- lie latent both
 <em>Amrita</em> (immortality) and <em>Visha </em>(poison, death,
 evil). This allegory is found in the "Churning of the Ocean"
 by the gods. <em>Amrita </em>is beyond any guna, for it is UNCONDITIONED
 <em>per se; </em>yet when fallen into the phenomenal creation
 it got mixed up with <strong>E</strong>VIL, <em>Chaos</em>,<em>
 </em>with latent <em>theos </em>in it, and before <em>Kosmos </em>was
 evolved. Hence, one finds Vishnu -- standing here for eternal
 Law -- periodically calling forth Kosmos into activity -- "churning
 out of the <em>primitive </em>Ocean (boundless Chaos) the <em>Amrita
 </em>of Eternity, reserved only for the gods and devas; and he
 has to employ in the task <em>Nagas </em>and<em> Asuras</em> --<em>
 </em>demons in exoteric Hinduism. The whole allegory is highly
 philosophical, and we find it repeated in every philosophical
 System. Plato, having fully embraced the ideas of Pythagoras --
 who had brought them from India -- compiled and published them
 in a form more intelligible than the mysterious numerals of the
 Greek Sage. Thus the <em>Kosmos </em>is "the Son" with
 Plato, having for his father and mother the Divine Thought and
 Matter.*
 </p><p>
 "The Egyptians," says Dunlap,** "distinguish between
 an older and younger Horus; the former the <em>brother </em>of
 Osiris, the latter the <em>son </em>of<em> </em>Osiris and Isis."
 The first is the <em>Idea </em>of the world remaining in the Demiurgic
 Mind, "born in darkness before the creation of the world."
 The second Horus is this "Idea" going forth from the
 <em>Logos</em>,<em> </em>becoming clothed with matter, and assuming
 an actual existence.***
 </p><p>
 "The Mundane God, eternal, boundless, young and old, of winding
 form,"**** say the <em>Chaldean oracles.</em>

 This "winding form" is a figure to express the vibratory
 motion of the Astral Light, with which the ancient priests were
 perfectly well acquainted, though its name was invented by the
 Martinists.
