 ORGANIC EVOLUTION AND CREATIVE CENTRES.</h3>
 
 <p>
 <b>I</b>T is argued that the Universal Evolution, otherwise, the
 gradual development of species in all the kingdoms of nature,
 works by uniform laws. This is admitted, and the law enforced
 far more strictly in Esoteric than in modern Science. But we are
 told also, that it is equally a law that "development works
 from the less to the more perfect, and from the simpler to the
 more complicated, by incessant changes, small in themselves, but
 constantly accumulating in the required direction." It is
 from the infinitesimally small that the comparatively gigantic
 species are produced.
 </p><p>
 Esoteric Science agrees with it, but adds that this law applies
 only to what is known to it as the <i>Primary Creation </i>-<i>-
 </i>the evolution of worlds from primordial atoms, and the <i>pre-primordial
 </i><strong>A</strong>TOM, at the first differentiation of the
 former; and that during the period of cyclic evolution in space
 and time, this law is limited and works only in the lower kingdoms.
 It did so work during the first geological periods, from simple
 to complex, on the rough material surviving from the relics of
 the Third Round, which relics are projected into objectivity when
 terrestrial activity recommences.
 </p><p>
 No more than Science, does esoteric philosophy admit <i>design</i>
 or<i> "</i>special creation." It rejects every claim
 to the "miraculous," and accepts nothing outside the
 uniform and immutable laws of Nature. But it teaches a cyclic
 law, a double stream of force (or spirit) and of matter, which,
 starting from the <i>neutral centre </i>of Being, develops in
 its cyclic progress and incessant transformations. The primitive
 germ from which all vertebrate life has developed throughout the
 ages, being distinct from the primitive germ from which the vegetable
 and the animal life have evolved, there are side laws whose work
 is determined by the conditions in which the materials to be worked
 upon are found by them, and of which Science -- physiology and
 anthropology especially -- seems to be little aware. Its votaries
 speak of that "primitive germ," and maintain that it
 is shown beyond any doubt that the "design" and the
 "<i>designer,</i>"<i> </i>if there be any, in the case
 of man, with the wonderful structure of his limbs, and his hand
 especially, "must be placed very much farther back, and (the
 design) is, in fact, involved in the primitive germ," from
 which not only all vertebrate life, but, "probably all life,
 animal and vegetable, have been slowly developed" (<i>p</i>.
 94 <i>of </i>"<i>Modern Science and Modern Thought</i>")<i>.</i>
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 732 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 This is as true of the "primitive germ" as it is false
 that that "germ" is only "very much farther back"
 than man is; for it is at an immeasurable and inconceivable distance
 (<i>in time, </i>though not in space) from the origin even of
 our Solar system. As the Hindu philosophy very justly teaches,
 the "<i>Aniyamsam Aniyasam,</i>"<i> </i>can be known
 only through false notions. It is the "many" that proceed
 from the ONE -- the living spiritual germs <i>or centres of forces
 </i>-- each<i> </i>in a septenary form, which first generate,
 and then give the PRIMARY IMPULSE to the law of evolution and
 gradual slow development.
 </p><p>
 Limiting the teaching strictly to this, our earth, it may be shown
 that, as the ethereal forms of the first Men are first projected
 on seven zones by seven Dhyan-Chohanic <i>centres of </i>Force,
 so there are centres of creative power for every ROOT or parent
 species of the host of forms of vegetable and animal life. This
 is, again, no "special creation," nor is there any "Design,"
 except in the general "ground-plan" worked out by the
 universal law. But there are certainly "designers,"
 though these are neither omnipotent nor omniscient in the absolute
 sense of the term. They are simply <i>Builders, </i>or Masons,
 working under the impulse given them by the ever-to-be-unknown
 (on our plane) Master Mason -- the <strong>O</strong>NE <strong>L</strong>IFE
 and Law. Belonging to this sphere, they have no hand in, or possibility
 of working on any other, during the present Manvantara, at any
 rate. That they work in cycles and on a strictly geometrical and
 mathematical scale of progression, is what the extinct animal
 species amply demonstrate; that they act by <i>design </i>in the
 details of minor lives (of side animal issues, etc.) is what natural
 history has sufficient evidence for. In the <i>creation </i>of
 new species, departing sometimes very widely from the Parent stock,
 as in the great variety of the <i>genus Felis -- </i>like the
 lynx, the tiger, the cat, etc. -- it is the "designers"
 who direct the new evolution by adding to, or depriving the species
 of certain appendages, either needed or becoming useless in the
 new environments. Thus, when we say that <i>Nature </i>provides
 for every animal and plant, whether large or small, we speak correctly.
 For, it is those terrestrial spirits of Nature, who form the aggregated
 Nature; which, if it fails occasionally in its design, is neither
 to be considered blind, nor to be taxed with the failure; since,
 belonging to <i>a differentiated </i>sum of qualities and attributes,
 it is in virtue of that alone <i>conditioned and imperfect.</i>
 
 </p><p>
 Were there no such thing as evolutionary cycles, an eternal spiral
 progress into matter with a proportionate <i>obscuration </i>of
 spirit -- though the two are one -- followed by an inverse ascent
 into spirit and the defeat of matter -- active and passive by
 turn -- how explain the discoveries of zoology and geology? How
 is it that, on the dictum of authoritative science, one can trace
 the animal life from the mollusc up</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 733 THE "TO BE OR NOT TO BE" OF
 SCIENCE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 to the great Sea Dragon, from the smallest land-worm up again
 to the gigantic animals of the Tertiary Period; and that the latter
 were once crossed is shown by the fact of all those species <i>decreasing,
 dwindling down and being dwarfed. </i>If the seeming process of
 development working from the less to the more perfect, and from
 the simpler to the more complex, were a universal law indeed,
 instead of being a very imperfect generalization of a mere secondary
 nature in the great Cosmic process, and if there were no such
 cycles as those claimed, then the Mesozoic fauna and flora ought
 to change places with the latest Neolithic. It is the Plesiosauri
 and the Ichthyosauri that we ought to find developing from the
 present sea and river reptiles, instead of giving place to their
 dwarfed modern analogies. It is, again, our old friend, the good-tempered
 elephant, that would be the fossil antediluvian ancestor, and
 the mammoth of the Pliocene age who would be in the <i>menagerie</i>;<i>
 </i>the megalonyx and the gigantic megatherium would be found
 instead of the lazy sloth in the forests of South America, in
 which the colossal ferns of the carboniferous periods would take
 the place of moss and present trees -- dwarfs, even the giants
 of California, in comparison with the Titan-trees of past geological
 periods. Surely the organisms of the megasthenian world of the
 Tertiary and the Mesozoic Ages must have been <i>more complex
 and perfect </i>than those of the microsthenian plants and animals
 of the present age? The Dryopithecus, for instance, is found more
 perfect anatomically, more fit for a greater development of brain
 power, than the modern gorilla or gibbon? How is this, then? Are
 we to believe that the constitution of all those colossal land
 and sea-dragons, of the gigantic flying reptiles, was not far
 more developed and complex than the anatomy of the lizards, turtles,
 crocodiles, and even of the whales -- in short, all those animals
 we are acquainted with?
 </p><p>
 Let us admit, however, for argument's sake, that all those cycles,
 races, septenary forms of evolution and the <i>tutti quanti </i>of
 esoteric teaching, are no better than a delusion and a snare.
 Let us agree with Science and say that man, instead of being an
 imprisoned "Spirit," and his vehicle, the <i>shell </i>or
 body, a gradually perfected and now complete mechanism for material
 and terrestrial uses, as claimed by the Occultists -- is simply
 a more developed animal, whose primal form emerged from one and
 the same primitive germ on this earth, as the flying dragon and
 the gnat, the whale and the amoeba, the crocodile and the frog,
 etc., etc. In this case, he must have passed through the identical
 developments and through the same process of growth as all the
 other mammals? If man is an animal, <i>and</i> <i>nothing more,
 </i>a highly intellectual <i>ex-brute, </i>he should be privileged,
 at least, and allowed to have been a gigantic mammal of his kind,
 a</p><hr>

 <p>
 <i>meganthropos </i>in his day. It is just this, that esoteric
 science shows as having taken place in the first three rounds,
 and in this, as in most other things, it is more logical and consistent
 than modern science. It classifies the human body with the brute
 creation, and maintains it in the path of animal evolution, from
 first to last, while science leaves man a parentless orphan born
 of sires unknown, an "unspecialized skeleton" truly!
 And this mistake is due to a stubborn rejection of the doctrine
 of cycles.

 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 Having dealt almost exclusively with the question of the origin
 of Man in the foregoing criticism of Western Evolutionism, it
 may not be amiss to define the position of the Occultists with
 regard to the differentiation of species. The <i>pre-human </i>fauna
 and flora have been already generally dealt with in the Commentary
 on the Stanzas, and the truth of much of modern biological speculation
 admitted, <i>e.g.</i>, the derivation of birds from reptiles,
 the <i>partial </i>truth of "natural selection," and
 the transformation theory generally. It now remains to clear up
 the mystery of the origin of those first mammalian fauna which
 M. de Quatrefages so brilliantly endeavours to prove as contemporary
 with the Homo primigenius of the Secondary Age.
 </p><p>
 The somewhat complicated problem relating to the "Origin
 of Species," -- more especially of the varied groups of fossil
 or existing mammalian fauna -- will be rendered less obscure by
 the aid of a diagram. It will then be apparent to what extent
 the "Factors of Organic Evolution," relied upon by Western
 biologists,* are to be considered as
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The Darwinian theory has been so strained, that even Huxley
 was forced at one time to deprecate its occasional degeneration
 into "fanaticism." Oscar Schmidt presents a good instance
 of a thinker who unconsciously exaggerates the worth of an hypothesis.
 He admits ("The Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,"
 p. 158), that "natural selection" "is in some cases
 . . . <i>inadequate</i>, . . . in others . . . not requisite,
 as the solution of the formation of species is found in other
 natural conditions." He also asserts the "<i>intermediate
 grades are </i>. . . <i>wanting</i>, which would entitle us to
 infer with certainty the direct transition from unplacental to
 placental mammals" (p. 271); that "we are referred <i>entirely
 to conjecture and</i> <i>inference </i>for the origin of the mammals"
 (p. 268); and the repeated failures of the framers of "<i>hypothetical
 pedigrees,</i>"<i> </i>more especially of Haeckel. Nevertheless
 he asserts on p. 194, that "what we have gained by the Doctrine
 of Descent based on the theory of selection is the KNOWLEDGE of
 the connection of organisms as 'consanguineous beings.' "
 Knowledge in the face of the above-cited concessions, is, then,
 the synonym for conjecture and theory only?</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 735 CONJECTURES ARE NOT FACTS. </h6>
 
 <p>
 adequate to meet the facts. The line of demarcation between etherospiritual,
 astral and physical evolution must be drawn. Perhaps, if Darwinians
 deigned to consider the possibility of the second process, they
 would no longer have to lament the fact that "we are <i>referred
 to conjecture and inference </i>for the origin of the Mammals"!!
 (<i>The Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism, </i>p. 268, by Professor
 O. Schmidt.) At present the admitted chasm between the systems
 of reproduction of the oviparous vertebrates and mammalia, constitutes
 a hopeless crux to those thinkers who, with the Evolutionists,
 seek to link all existing organic forms in a continuous line of
 descent.
 </p><p>
 Let us take -- <i>exempli gratia</i> -- the case of the ungulate
 mammals. "In no other division," it is said, "do
 we possess such abundant fossil material." So much progress
 has been made in this direction, that in some instances the intermediate
 links between the modern and Eocene ungulates have been unearthed;
 a notable example being that of the complete proof of the derivation
 of the present one-toed horse from the three-toed Anchitherium
 of the old Tertiary. This standard of comparison between Western
 Biology and the Eastern doctrine could not, therefore, be improved
 upon. The pedigree here utilized, as embodying the views of scientists
 in general, is that of Schmidt based on the exhaustive researches
 of Rutimeyer. Its <i>approximate </i>accuracy -- from the standpoint
 of evolutionism -- leaves little to be desired: --

 <p>
 The midway point of evolution. Science comes to a standstill.
 "<i>The</i> <i>root to which these two families lead back
 </i>IS UNKNOWN" (Schmidt).
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-736.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 No. I. represents the realm explored by Western Evolutionists,
 the area in which climatic influences, "natural selection,"
 and all the other <i>physical </i>causes of organic differentiation
 are present. Biology and palaeontology find their province here
 in investigating the many physical agencies which contribute so
 largely, as shown by Darwin, Spencer and others, to the <i>segregation
 of species. </i>But even in this domain the sub-conscious workings
 of the <i>Dhyan-Chohanic wisdom </i>are at the root of all the
 "ceaseless striving towards perfection," though its
 influence is vastly modified by those purely material causes which
 de Quatrefages terms the "<i>milieux</i>"<i> </i>and
 Spencer the "Environment."
 </p><p>
 The "midway point of evolution" is that stage where
 the <i>astral </i>prototypes definitely begin to pass into the
 physical, and thus become subject to the differentiating agencies
 now operative around us. Physical causation supervenes immediately
 on the assumption of "coats of skin" -- <i>i.e.</i>,
 the physiological equipment in general. The forms of Men and mammalia
 previous to the separation of sexes* are woven out of astral matter,
 and possess a structure utterly unlike that of the physical organisms,
 which eat, drink, digest, etc., etc., etc. The known physiological
 contrivances in organisms were almost entirely evolved subsequently
 to the incipient physicalization of the 7 Root-Types out of the
 astral -- during the "midway halt" between the two planes
 of existence. Hardly had the "ground-plan" of evolution
 been limned out in these ancestral types, than the influence of
 the accessory terrestrial laws, familiar to us, supervened, resulting
 in the whole crop of mammalian species. AEons of slow differentiation
 were, however, required to effect this end.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Bear in mind, please, that though the animals -- mammalians
 included -- have all been evolved after and partially <i>from</i>
 man's cast-off tissues, still, as a far lower being, the mammalian
 animal became placental and separated far earlier than man.</p><hr>
 
 <p>
 [[Vol. 2, Page]] 737 THE UNITY OF TYPE.
 </p><p>
 No. <strong>II</strong>. represents the domain of the purely astral
 prototypes previous to their descent into (gross) matter. Astral
 matter, it must be noted, is fourth state matter, having, like
 our gross matter, its own "protyle." There are several
 "protyles" in Nature, corresponding to the various planes
 of matter. The two sub-physical elemental kingdoms, the plane
 of mind (<i>manas, </i>the fifth state matter), as also that of
 Buddhi (sixth state matter), are each and all evolved from one
 of the six "protyles" which constitute the basis of
 the Object-Universe. The three "states," so-called of
 our terrestrial matter, known as the "solid," "liquid,"
 and "gaseous," are only, in strict accuracy, SUB-states.
 As to the former reality of the descent into the physical, which
 culminated in physiological man and animal, we have a palpable
 testimony in the fact of the so-called spiritualistic "materializations."
 </p><p>
 In all these instances a complete temporary mergence of the astral
 into the physical takes place. The evolution of <i>physiological
 </i>Man out of the astral races of <i>early</i> Lemurian age --
 the Jurassic age of Geology -- is exactly paralleled by the "materialization"
 of "spirits" (?) in the seance-room. In the case of
 Professor Crookes' "Katie King," the presence of a <i>physiological
 </i>mechanism -- heart, lungs, etc. -- was indubitably demonstrated!!
 </p><p>
 This, in a way, is the <strong>A</strong>RCHETYPE of Goethe. Listen
 to his words: "Thus much we should have gained . . . all
 the nine perfect organic beings . . . (are) formed <i>according
 to an archetype </i>which merely fluctuates more or less in its
 very persistent parts and, moreover, day by day, completes and
 transforms itself by means of reproduction." This is a seemingly
 imperfect foreshadowing of the occult fact of the differentiation
 of species from the primal <i>astral root-types. </i>Whatever
 the whole posse comitatus of "natural selection," etc.,
 etc., may effect, the <i>fundamental unity of structural plan
 </i>remains practically unaffected by all subsequent modifications.
 The "Unity of Type" common, in a sense, to all the animal
 and human kingdoms, is not, as Spencer and others appear to hold,
 a proof of the consanguineity of <i>all </i>organic forms, but
 a witness to the essential unity of the "ground-plan"
 Nature has followed in fashioning her creatures.
 </p><p>
 To sum up the case, we may again avail ourselves of a tabulation
 of the actual <i>factors </i>concerned in the differentiation
 of species. The stages of the process itself need no further comment
 here, being the basic principles underlying organic development,
 than to enter on the domain of the biological specialist.

 <b>I</b>S Science against those who maintain that down to the
 Quaternary period the distribution of the human races was widely
 different from what it is now? Is Science against those who, further,
 maintain that the fossil men found in Europe -- although having
 almost reached a plane of sameness and unity from the fundamental
 physiological and anthropological aspects which continues till
 this day -- still differ, sometimes greatly, from the type of
 the now existing populations. The late Littre confesses it in
 an article published by him on the Memoir called <i>Antiquites
 Celtiques et Antediluviennes </i>by Boucher de Perthes (1849)
 -<i>-</i> in the<i> Revue des Deux Mondes</i> (<i>March </i>1,1859)<i>.
 </i>He says in it (<i>a</i>) that in these periods when the Mammoths,
 exhumed with the hatchets in Picardy, lived in the latter region,
 there must have been an eternal spring reigning over all the terrestrial
 globe*; nature was the contrary of what it is now -- thus leaving
 an <i>enormous margin for the antiquity of</i> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Scientists now admit that Europe enjoyed in the Miocene times
 a warm, in the Pliocene or later <i>Tertiary, </i>a temperate
 climate. Littre's contention as to the balmy spring of the <i>Quaternary
 -- </i>to which deposits M. de Perthes' discoveries of flint implements
 are traceable (since when the Somme has worn down its valley many
 scores of feet) -- must be accepted with much reservation. The
 Somme-valley relics are <i>post-glacial, </i>and possibly point
 to the immigration of savages during one of the more temperate
 periods intervening between <i>minor</i> ages of Ice.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 739 AFRICA IN EUROPE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <i>those </i>"<i>periods</i>"<i> </i>and then adds:
 (<i>b</i>) "Spring, professor of the Faculty of Medicine
 at Liege, found in a grotto near Namur, in the mountain of Chauvaux,
 numerous human bones '<i>of a race quite distinct from ours.</i>'<i>
 </i>"
 </p><p>
 Skulls exhumed in Austria offered a great analogy with those of
 African negro races, according to Littre, while others, discovered
 on the shores of the Danube and the Rhine, resembled the skulls
 of the Caribs and those of the ancient inhabitants of Peru and
 Chili. Still, the <i>Deluge, </i>whether Biblical or Atlantean,
 was denied. But further geological discoveries having made Gaudry
 write conclusively: "Our forefathers were positively contemporaneous
 with the <i>rhinoceros tichorrhinus,</i> the<i> hippopotamus major</i>";<i>
 </i>and add that the soil called <i>diluvial </i>in geology "was
 formed <i>partially </i>at least after man's apparition on earth"
 -- Littre pronounced himself finally. He then showed the necessity,
 before "the resurrection of so many old witnesses,"
 of <i>rehandling </i>all the origins, all the durations, and added
 that there was AN AGE hitherto unknown to study "either at
 the dawn of the actual epoch or, as I believe, at the beginning
 of the epoch <i>which preceded it.</i>"
 </p><p>
 The types of the skulls found in Europe are of two kinds, as is
 well known: the orthognathous and the prognathous, or the Caucasian
 and the negro types; such as are now found only in the African
 and the lower savage tribes. Professor Heer -- who argues that
 the facts of Botany necessitate the hypothesis of an Atlantis
 -- has shown that the plants of the Neolithic lake-villagers are
 mainly of <i>African </i>origin. How did the latter come to be
 in Europe if there was no former point of union between Africa
 and Europe? How many thousand years ago did the seventeen men
 live whose skeletons were exhumed in the Department of the Haute
 Garonne, in a squatting posture near the remains of a coal fire,
 with some amulets and broken crockery around them, and in company
 with the bear <i>spelaeus, </i>the<i> Elephas primigenius, </i>the<i>
 aurochs </i>(regarded by Cuvier as a distinct species), the <i>Megaceros
 hibernicus -- </i>all antediluvian mammals? Certainly at a most
 distant epoch, but not one which carries us further back than
 the Quaternary. A much greater antiquity for Man has yet to be
 proved. Dr. James Hunt, the late President of the Anthropological
 Society, makes it 9,000,000 years. This man of science, at any
 rate, makes some approach to our esoteric computation, if we leave
 the first two semi-human, ethereal races, and the early Third
 Race out of the computation.
 </p><p>
 The question, however, arises -- who were these Palaeolithic men
 of the European quaternary epoch? Were they aboriginal, or the
 outcome of some immigration dating back into the unknown past?
 The latter is the only tenable hypothesis, as all scientists agree
 in eliminating Europe from the category of possible "cradles
 of mankind." Whence, then, radiated the various successive
 streams of "primitive" men?</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 740 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The earliest Palaeolithic men in Europe -- about whose origin
 Ethnology is silent, and whose very characteristics are but imperfectly
 known, though expatiated on as "ape-like" by imaginative
 writers such as Mr. Grant Allen -- were of pure Atlantean and
 "Africo"-Atlantean stocks.* (It must be borne in mind
 that by this time the Atlantis continent itself was a dream of
 the past.) Europe in the quaternary epoch was very different from
 the Europe of to-day, being then only in process of formation.
 It was united to N. Africa -- or rather what is now N. Africa
 -- by a neck of land running across the present Straits of Gibraltar
 -- N. Africa thus constituting a species of extension of Spain,
 while a broad sea washed the great basin of the Sahara. Of the
 great Atlantis, the main bulk of which sank in the Miocene, there
 remained only Ruta and Daitya and a stray island or so. The Atlantean
 connections of the forefathers** of the Palaeolithic cave-men
 are evidenced by the upturning of fossil skulls (in Europe) reverting
 closely to the <i>West Indian </i>Carib and <i>ancient Peruvian
 </i>type -- a mystery indeed to all those who refuse to sanction
 the "hypothesis" of a former Atlantic continent to bridge
 the ocean (Cf. "Scientific and geological proofs of the reality
 of several submerged continents"). What are we also to make
 of the fact that while de Quatrefages points to that "<i>magnificent
 race,</i>"<i> </i>the TALL Cro-Magnon cave-men and the <i>Guanches
 </i>of<i> </i>the Canary Islands as representatives of one type
 -- Virchow also allies the<i> Basques </i>with the latter in a
 similar way? Professor Retzius independently proves the relationship
 of the aboriginal <i>American</i> dolichocephalous tribes and
 these same <i>Guanches. </i>The several links in the chain of
 evidence are securely joined together. Legions of similar facts
 could be adduced. As to the African tribes -- themselves diverging
 offshoots of Atlanteans modified by climate and conditions --
 they crossed into Europe over the peninsula which made the Mediterranean
 an inland sea. Fine races were many of these European cave-men;
 the Cro-Magnon, for instance. But, as was to be expected, <i>progress
 is almost non-existent </i>through the whole of the vast period
 allotted
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * "Whence they (the old cave-men) came, we <i>cannot tell</i>"<i>
 </i>(Grant Allen).
 </p><p>
 "<i>The palaeolithic hunters of the Somme Valley did not
 originate in that inhospitable climate, but moved into Europe
 from</i> <i>some more genial region -- </i>(Dr. Southall "<i>Epoch</i>
 <i>of the Mammoth</i>"<i> </i>p. 315).
 </p><p>
 ** The <i>pure</i> Atlantean stocks -- of which the tall quaternary
 cave-men were, in part, the direct descendants -- immigrated into
 Europe long prior to the Glacial Period; in fact as far back as
 the Pliocene and Miocene times in the Tertiary. <i>The worked
 Miocene flints of Thenay, and the traces of Pliocene man discovered
 by Professor Capellini in Italy, are witnesses to the fact. </i>These
 colonists were portions of the once glorious race, whose cycle
 from the <i>Eocene</i> downwards had been running down the scale.

 <p>
 by Science to the Chipped Stone-Age.* <i>The cyclic impulse downwards
 </i>weighs heavily on the stocks thus transplanted -- the incubus
 of the <i>Atlantean Karma </i>is upon them. Finally, Palaeolithic
 man makes room for his successor -- and disappears almost entirely
 from the scene. Professor Lefevre asks in this connection: --
 </p><p>
 "Has the Polished succeeded the Chipped Stone-Age by an imperceptible
 transition, or was it due to an invasion of brachycephalous Celts?
 But whether, again, the deterioration produced in the populations
 of La Vezere was the result of violent crossings, or of a general
 retreat northwards in the wake of the reindeer, is of little moment
 to us." He continues: --
 </p><p>
 "Meantime the bed of the ocean has been upheaved, Europe
 is now fully formed, her flora and fauna fixed. With the taming
 of the dog begins the pastoral life. <i>We enter on those polished
 stone and bronze periods, </i>which succeed each other at irregular
 intervals, which even overlap one another in the midst of ethnical
 fusions and migrations. . . . The primitive European populations
 are interrupted in their special evolution and, without perishing,
 become absorbed in other races, engulfed . . . by successive waves
 of migration overflowing from Africa, <i>possibly from a lost
 Atlantis </i>[?? far too late by aeons of years] and from prolific
 Asia . . . all FORERUNNERS OF THE GREAT <strong>A</strong>RYAN
 <strong>I</strong>NVASION" (Fifth Race).
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * The artistic skill displayed by the old cave-men renders the
 hypothesis which regards them as approximations to the "pithecanthropus
 alalus" -- that very mythical Haeckelian monster -- an absurdity
 requiring no Huxley or Schmidt to expose it. We see in their skill
 in engraving a <i>gleam</i> of Atlantean culture <i>atavistically
 </i>re-appearing. It will be remembered that Donnelly regards
 modern European as a <i>renaissance </i>of<i> </i>Atlantean civilization.
