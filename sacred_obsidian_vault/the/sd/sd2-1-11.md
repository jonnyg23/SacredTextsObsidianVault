 Whence the idea, and the true meaning of the term "Eden"?
 Christians will maintain that the Garden of Eden is the holy Paradise,
 the place <em>desecrated by the sin </em>of Adam and Eve; the
 Occultist will deny this dead-letter interpretation, and show
 the reverse. One need not believe and see in the Bible divine
 revelation in order to say that this ancient book, if read esoterically,
 is based upon the same universal traditions. What Eden was is
 partially shown in <em>Isis Unveiled.</em>*
 </p><p>
 It was said that: "The Garden of Eden as a locality is no
 myth at all; it belongs to those landmarks of history which occasionally
 disclose to the student that the <em>Bible </em>is not all mere
 allegory. Eden, or the Hebrew <img src="sd2-202a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 Gan-Eden, meaning the park or the garden of Eden, is an archaic
 name of the country watered by the Euphrates and its many branches,
 from Asia and Armenia to the Erythraean sea." (A. Wilder
 says that Gan-duniyas is a name of Babylonia.) In the Chaldean
 "<em>Book of Numbers,</em>"<em> </em>the location is
 designated in numerals, and in the cypher Rosicrucian manuscript,
 left by Count St. Germain, it is fully described. In the Assyrian
 <em>Tablets </em>it is rendered <em>Ganduniyas. </em>"Behold,"
 says the <img src="sd2-202b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> (<em>Elohim</em>)<em>
 </em>of Genesis, "the man is become as one of us." The
 <em>Elohim </em>may be accepted in one sense for <em>gods </em>or
 powers, and in another for <em>Aleim, </em>or priests -- the hierophants
 initiated into the good and evil of this world; for there was
 a college of priests called the <em>Aleim, </em>while the head
 of their caste, or the chief of the hierophants was known as <em>Java-Aleim.
 </em>Instead of becoming a neophyte, and gradually obtaining his
 esoteric knowledge through a regular initiation, an <em>Adam,
 </em>or Man, uses his intuitional faculties and, prompted by the
 serpent (<em>Woman </em>and matter), tastes of the Tree of Knowledge
 -- the esoteric or Secret Doctrine -- unlawfully. The priests
 of Hercules, or Mel-karth, the "Lord of the Eden," all
 wore "coats of skin." The text says: "And <em>Java-Aleim
 </em>made for Adam and his wife <img src="sd2-202c.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 'Chitonuth our.' " The first Hebrew word, "<em>chiton,</em>"<em>
 </em>is the Greek [[<em>Chiton</em>]], <em>Chiton. </em>It became
 a Slavonic word by adoption from the <em>Bible, </em>and means
 a <em>coat, </em>an upper garment.
 </p><p>
 "Though containing the same substratum of esoteric truth
 as does every early Cosmogony, the Hebrew Scripture wears on its
 face the marks of a double origin. Its Genesis is purely a reminiscence
 of the Babylonian captivity. The names of places, men and even
 objects, can be traced from the original text to the Chaldeans
 and the Akkadians, the progenitors and Aryan instructors of the
 former. It is strongly contested that the Akkad tribes of Chaldea,
 Babylonia and Assyria were in

 <p>
 any way cognate with the Brahmans of Hindostan; but there are
 more proofs in favour of this opinion than otherwise. The Shemite
 or Assyrian ought, perchance, to have been called the Turanian,
 and the Mongolians have been denominated Scyths. But if the Akkadians
 ever existed, otherwise than in the imagination of some ethnologists
 and philologists, they certainly would never have been a Turanian
 tribe, as some Assyriologists have striven to make us believe.
 They were simply emigrants on their way to Asia Minor from India,
 the cradle of humanity, and their sacerdotal adepts tarried to
 civilize and initiate a barbarian people. Halevy proved the fallacy
 of the Turanian mania in regard to Akkadian people, and other
 scientists have proved that the Babylonian civilization was neither
 born nor developed in that country. It was imported from India,
 and the importers were Brahminical Hindus."
 </p><p>
 And now, ten years after this was written, we find ourselves corroborated
 by Professor Sayce, who says in his first Hibbert lecture that
 the culture of the Babylonian city Eridu was of <em>foreign importation.
 It </em>came from India.
 </p><p>
 "Much of the theology was borrowed by the Semites from the
 non-Semitic Akkadians or proto-Chaldeans, whom they supplanted,
 and whose local cults they had neither the will nor the power
 to uproot. Indeed, throughout a long course of ages the two races,
 Semites and Akkadians, lived side by side, their notions and worship
 of the gods blending insensibly together."
 </p><p>
 Here, the Akkadians are called "non-Semitic," as we
 had insisted they were in "<em>Isis,</em>"<em> </em>which
 is another corroboration. And we are no less right in always maintaining
 that the Jewish Biblical history was a compilation of <em>historical
 </em>facts, arranged from other people's history in Jewish garb
 -- Genesis excluded, which is esotericism pure and simple. But
 it is really from the Euxine to Kashmir and beyond, that science
 has to search for the cradle -- or rather one of the chief cradles
 -- of mankind and the sons of Ad-ah; and especially in after times,
 when the Garden of Ed-en on the Euphrates became the college of
 the astrologers and magi, the Aleim.
 </p><p>
 But this "college" and this Eden belong to the Fifth
 Race, and are simply a faint reminiscence of the Adi-varsha, of
 the primeval Third Race. What is the etymological meaning of the
 word <em>Eden? </em>In Greek it is [<em>hedone</em>], signifying<em>
 voluptuousness. </em>In this aspect it is no better than the Olympus
 of the Greeks, Indra's heaven (Swarga) on Mount Meru, and even
 the paradise full of <em>Houris, </em>promised by Mahomet to the
 faithful. The Garden of Eden was never the property of the Jews;
 for China, which can hardly be suspected of having known anything
 of the Jews 2,000 <b>B.C</b>., has such a primitive garden in
 Central Asia inhabited by the "Dragons of Wisdom," the
 Initiates. And according to Klaproth,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 204 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the hieroglyphical chart copied from a Japanese Cyclopaedia in
 the book <em>of Fo-kone-ky, </em>places its "Garden of Wisdom"
 on the plateau of Pamir between the highest peaks of the Himalayan
 ranges; and describing it as the culminating point of Central
 Asia, shows the four rivers -- Oxus, Indus, Ganges, and Silo --
 flowing from a common source, the "<em>Lake of the Dragons.</em>"
 </p><p>
 But this is not the Genetic Eden; nor is it the Kabalistical Garden
 of Eden. For the former -- <em>Eden Illa-ah </em>-- means in one
 sense Wisdom, a state like that of Nirvana, a paradise of Bliss;
 while in another sense it refers to Intellectual man himself,
 the container of the Eden in which grows the tree of Knowledge
 of good and evil: man being the <em>Knower </em>thereof.
 </p><p>
 Renan and Barthelemy St. Hilaire, basing themselves "on the
 most solid inductions," think it impossible to doubt any
 longer, and both place the cradle of humanity "on the region
 of the Timaus." Finally, the Asiatic Journal* concludes that:
 "All the traditions of the human race gathering its primitive
 families at the region of their birth-place, show them to us grouped
 around the countries where Jewish tradition places the Garden
 of Eden; where the Aryans (Zoroastrians) established their Airyana-vaego
 or the Meru (?). They are hemmed in to the North by the countries
 which join the lake Aral, and to the South by Baltistan, or Little
 Tibet. Everything concurs in proving that there was the abode
 of that primitive humanity to which we have to be traced."
 </p><p>
 That "primitive humanity" was in its Fifth Race, when
 the "four-mouthed Dragon," the lake, of which very few
 traces are now left, was the abode of the "Sons of Wisdom,"
 the first mind-born sons of the Third Race. Yet it was neither
 the only one nor the primitive cradle of humanity, though it was
 the copy of the cradle, verily, of the first thinking <em>divine
 </em>man. It was the <em>Paradesa, </em>the highland of the first
 Sanskrit-speaking people, the <em>Hedone, </em>the country of
 delight of the Greeks, but it was not the "<em>bower </em>of
 voluptuousness" of the Chaldeans, for the latter was only
 the reminiscence of it; and also because it was not there that
 the <em>Fall of Man </em>occurred after the "separation."
 The Eden of the Jews was <em>copied </em>from the Chaldean <em>copy.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 That the Fall of man into generation occurred during the earliest
 portion of what science calls the Mesozoic times, or the age of
 the reptiles, is evidenced by the Bible phraseology concerning
 the serpent, the nature of which is explained in the <em>Zohar.
 </em>The question is not whether Eve's incident with the tempting
 reptile is allegorical or textual, for no one can doubt that it
 is the former, but to show the antiquity of the symbolism on the
 very face of it, and that it was not only a Jewish but an universal
 idea.

 <p>
 Now we find in the <em>Zohar </em>a very strange assertion, one
 that is calculated to provoke the reader to merry laughter by
 its ludicrous absurdity. It tells us that the serpent, which was
 used by <em>Shamael </em>(the supposed Satan), to seduce Eve,
 was a kind of <em>flying camel [[</em>kamelomorphon]].
 </p><p>
 A "flying camel" is indeed too much for the most liberal-minded
 <b>F.R.S</b>. Nevertheless, the <em>Zohar, </em>which can hardly
 be expected to use the language of a Cuvier, was right in its
 description:* for we find it called in the old Zoroastrian <strong>MSS</strong>.
 <em>Aschmogh, </em>which in the Avesta is represented as having
 lost after the Fall "its <em>nature and its name,</em>"<em>
 </em>and is described as a huge serpent with a camel's neck.
 </p><p>
 "There are no winged serpents, nor veritable dragons,"
 asserts Salverte,** " . . . grasshoppers are called by the
 Greeks <em>winged serpents, </em>and this metaphor may have created
 several narratives on the existence of winged serpents."
 </p><p>
 There are none <em>now</em>; but there is no reason why they should
 not have existed during the Mesozoic age; and Cuvier, who has
 reconstructed their skeletons, is a witness to "flying camels."
 Already, after finding simple fossils of certain saurians, the
 great naturalist has written, that, "if anything can justify
 the Hydra and other monsters, whose figures were so often repeated
 by mediaeval historians, it is incontestably the <em>Plesiosaurus.</em>"***
 </p><p>
 We are unaware if Cuvier had added anything in the way of a further
 <em>mea culpa. </em>But we may well imagine his confusion, for
 all his slanders against archaic veracity, when he found himself
 in the presence of a <em>flying </em>saurian, "the Pterodactyl"
 (found in Germany), "78 feet long, and carrying vigorous
 wings attached to its reptilian body." That fossil is described
 as a reptile, the <em>little fingers of whose hands </em>are so
 elongated as to bear a long membranous wing. Here, then, the "flying
 camel" of the Zohar is vindicated. For surely, between the
 long neck of the Plesiosaurus and the membranous wing of the Pterodactyl,
 or still better the Mosasaurus, there is enough scientific probability
 to build a "flying camel," or a long-necked dragon.
 Prof. Cope, of Philadelphia, has shown that the Mosasaurus fossil
 in the chalk was a <em>winged serpent of </em>this kind. There
 are characters in its vertebrae, which indicate union with the
 Ophidia rather than with the Lacertilia.
 </p><p>
 And now to the main question. It is well known that Antiquity
 has never claimed palaeontography and paleontology among its arts
 and sciences; and it never had its Cuviers. Yet on Babylonian
 tiles, and especially in old Chinese and Japanese drawings, in
 the oldest Pagodas

 <p>
 and monuments, and in the Imperial library at Pekin, many a traveller
 has seen and recognised perfect representations of Plesiosauri
 and Pterodactyls in the multiform Chinese dragons.* Moreover,
 the prophets speak in the Bible of the flying fiery serpents,**
 and Job mentions the Leviathan.*** Now the following questions
 are put very directly: --
 </p><p>
 I. How could the ancient nations know anything of the extinct
 monsters of the carboniferous and Mesozoic times, and even represent
 and describe them orally and pictorially, unless they had either
 <em>seen those monsters themselves or possessed descriptions of
 them in their traditions, </em>which descriptions necessitate
 <em>living and intelligent eye-witnesses?</em> 
 </p><p>
 II. And if such eye-witnesses are once admitted (unless retrospective
 clairvoyance is granted), how can humanity and the first palaeolithic
 men be no earlier than about the middle of the tertiary period?
 We must bear in mind that most of the men of science will not
 allow man to have appeared before the Quaternary period, and thus
 shut him out completely from the Cenozoic times. Here we have
 extinct species of animals, which disappeared from the face of
 the Earth millions of years ago, described by, and known to, nations
 whose civilization, it is said, could hardly have begun a few
 thousand years ago. How is this? Evidently either the Mesozoic
 time has to be made to overlap the Quaternary period, or man must
 be made the contemporary of the Pterodactyl and the Plesiosaurus.
 </p><p>
 It does not stand to reason, because the Occultists believe in
 and defend ancient wisdom and science, even though winged saurians
 are called "flying camels" in the translations of the
 <em>Zohar, </em>that we believe as readily in all the stories
 which the middle ages give us of such dragons. Pterodactyls and
 Plesiosauri ceased to exist with the bulk
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * We read in the "<em>Memoire a l</em>'<em>Academie</em>"<em>
 </em>of the "naive astonishment of Geoffrey St. Hilaire,
 when M. de Paravey showed to him in some old Chinese works and
 Babylonian tiles dragons, . . . . saurians and ornithorhynchuses
 (aquatic animals <em>found only in Australia</em>)<em>, </em>etc.,
 extinct animals that he had thought unknown on earth. . . . till
 his own day."
 </p><p>
 ** See <em>Isaiah, </em>xxx. 6: "The viper and the flying
 serpent unto the land of trouble and anguish," and the fiery
 serpents conquered by the brazen serpent of Moses.
 </p><p>
 *** The fossils reconstructed by science, which we know ought
 to be sufficient warrant for the possibility of even a <em>Leviathan,
 </em>let alone Isaiah's flying serpents, or <em>saraph mehophep,
 </em>which words are translated in all the Hebrew dictionaries
 as "saraph," enflamed or fiery venom, and "mehophep,"
 <em>flying</em>. But, although Christian theology has always connected
 both (<em>Leviathan and saraph mehophep</em>)<em> </em>with the
 devil, the expressions are metaphorical and have nought to do
 with the "evil one." But the word <em>Dracon </em>has
 become a synonym for the latter. In Bretagne the word <em>Drouk
 </em>now signifies "devil," whence, as we are told by
 Cambry ("<em>Monuments Celtiques,</em>"<em> </em>p.
 299), the devil's tomb in England, <em>Draghedanum sepulcrum.
 </em>In Languedoc the meteoric fires and <em>will-o</em>'<em>-the-wisps
 </em>are called <em>Dragg</em>, and in Bretagne Dreag, <em>Wraie

 devil's castle. </p><hr>

 <p>
 of the Third Race. When, therefore, we are gravely asked by Roman
 Catholic writers to credit Christopher Scherer's and Father Kircher's
 cock-and-bull stories of their having seen with their own eyes
 living fiery and flying dragons, respectively in 1619 and 1669,
 we may be allowed to regard their assertions as either dreams
 or fibs.* Nor shall we regard otherwise than as a <em>poetical
 license </em>that other story told of Petrarch, who, while following
 one day his Laura in the woods and passing near a cave, is credited
 with having found a dragon, whom he forthwith stabbed with his
 dagger and killed, thus preventing the monster from devouring
 the lady of his heart.** We would willingly believe the story
 had Petrarch lived in the days of Atlantis, when such antediluvian
 monsters may still have existed. We deny their existence in our
 present era. The sea-serpent is one thing, the dragon quite another.
 The former is denied by the majority because it exists and lives
 in the very depths of the ocean, is very scarce, and rises to
 the surface only when compelled, perhaps, by hunger. Thus keeping
 invisible, it may exist and still be denied. But if there was
 such a thing as a dragon of the above description, how could it
 have ever escaped detection? It is a creature contemporary with
 the earliest Fifth Race, and exists no more.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The ultramontane writers accept the whole series of draconian
 stories given by Father Kircher (<em>Edipus AEgyptiacus, </em>"<em>De
 Genere Draconum,</em>")<em> </em>quite seriously. According
 to that Jesuit, he himself saw a dragon which was killed in 1669
 by a Roman peasant, as the director of the Museo Barberini sent
 it to him, to take the beast's likeness, which Father Kircher
 did and had it published in one of his <em>in-folios. </em>After
 this he received a letter from Christopher Scherer, Prefect of
 the Canton of Soleure, Switzerland, in which that official certifies
 to his having seen himself <em>with his own eyes, </em>one fine
 summer night in 1619, a living dragon. Having remained on his
 balcony "to contemplate the perfect purity of the firmament,"
 he writes, "I saw a fiery, shining dragon rise from one of
 the caves of Mount Pilatus and direct itself rapidly towards Fluelen
 to the other end of the lake. Enormous in size, his tail was still
 longer and his neck very extended. His head and jaws were those
 of a serpent. In flying he emitted on his way numerous sparks
 (? !) . . . . I thought at first I was seeing a meteor, but soon
 looking more attentively, I was convinced by his flight and the
 conformation of his body that I saw a <em>veritable dragon. </em>I
 am happy to be thus able to enlighten your Reverence on the <em>very
 real </em>existence of those animals"; in <em>dreams, </em>the
 writer ought to have added, of long past ages.
 </p><p>
 ** As a convincing proof of the reality of the fact, a Roman Catholic
 refers the reader to the picture of that incident painted by Simon
 de Sienne, a friend of the poet, on the portal of the Church <em>Notre
 Dame du Don </em>at Avignon; notwithstanding the prohibition of
 the Sovereign Pontiff, who "would not allow this triumph
 of love to be enthroned in the holy place"; and adds: "Time
 has injured and rubbed out the work of art, but has not weakened
 its tradition." De Mirville's "Dragon-Devils" of
 our era seem to have no luck, as they disappear most mysteriously
 from the museums where they are said to have been. Thus the dragon
 embalmed by Ulysses Aldobranda and presented to the Musee du Senat,
 either in Naples or Bologna, "was there still in 1700, but
 is there no more." (<em>Vol. 2, p. 427, "Pneumatologie.</em>")
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 208 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The reader may inquire why we speak of dragons at all? We answer:
 <em>firstly, </em>because the knowledge of such animals is a proof
 of the enormous antiquity of the human race; and <em>secondly,
 </em>to show the difference between the zoological real meaning
 of the words "dragon," "<em>Naga,</em>"<em>
 </em>and "Serpent," and the metaphorical one, when used
 symbolically. The profane reader, who knows nothing of the mystery
 language, is likely, whenever he finds one of these words mentioned,
 to accept it literally. Hence, the <em>quid pro quos </em>and
 unjust accusations. A couple of instances will suffice.
 </p><p>
 <em>Sed et serpens? </em>aye: but what was the nature of the serpent?
 Mystics intuitionally see in the serpent of <em>Genesis </em>an
 animal emblem and a high spiritual essence: a cosmic force superintelligent,
 a "great fallen light," a spirit sidereal, aerial and
 tellurian at the same time, "whose influence circumambulates
 the globe (<em>qui circumambulat terram</em>)<em>, </em>as a Christian
 fanatic of the dead-letter (de Mirville) has it, and which only
 manifested itself under the physical emblem, which was the most
 convenient "with respect to its moral and intellectual <em>coils</em>"<em>:
 i.e. </em>under the ophidian form.
 </p><p>
 But what will Christians make of the Brazen Serpent, the "DIVINE
 HEALER," if the serpent is to be regarded as the emblem of
 cunning and evil? The "Evil One" itself? How can the
 line of demarcation ever be settled, when it is traced arbitrarily
 in a sectarian theological spirit. For, if the followers of the
 Roman Church are taught that Mercury and AEsculapius, or Asclepios,
 who are, in truth, one, are "devils and sons of devils,"
 and the wand and serpent of the latter were "the devil's
 wand"; how about the "brazen serpent" of Moses?
 Every scholar knows that both the <em>heathen </em>wand and the
 Jewish "serpent" are one and the same, namely, the <em>Caduceus
 of Mercury,</em> son of <strong>A</strong>POLLO-PYTHON. It is
 easy to comprehend why the Jews adopted the ophidian shape for
 their "seducer." With them it was purely <em>physiological
 and phallic</em>;<em> </em>and no amount of casuistical reasoning
 on the part of the Roman Catholic Church can give it another meaning,
 once that the mystery language is well studied, and that the Hebrew
 scrolls are read numerically. The Occultists know that the serpent,
 the <em>Naga, </em>and the dragon have each a septenary meaning;
 that the Sun, for instance, was the <em>astronomical </em>and
 cosmic emblem of the two contrasted lights, and the two serpents
 of the Gnostics, the good and the evil one; they also know that,
 when <em>generalised, </em>the conclusions of both science and
 theology present two most ridiculous extremes. For, when the former
 tells us that it is sufficient to trace the legends of the serpents
 to their primal source, the astrological legend, and to meditate
 seriously on the <em>Sun</em>, conqueror of Python, and the celestial
 virgin in the Zodiac forcing back the devouring dragon, if we
 would have the key of all the subsequent religious dogmas; it
 is easy to perceive that, instead of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 209 COBRAS AS SYMBOLS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 generalising, the author simply has his eye on Christian religion
 and <em>Revelation. </em>We call this one extreme. The other we
 see in this: when, repeating the famous decision of the Council
 of Trent, theology seeks to convince the masses that "from
 the fall of man until the hour of his baptism the devil has full
 power over him, and <em>possesses him by right </em>(<em>diabolum
 dominationem et potestatem super homines habere et jure cos possidere</em>)."<em>
 </em>To this Occult philosophy answers: Prove first the existence
 of the devil <em>as an entity, </em>and then we may believe in
 such congenital possession. A very small amount of observation
 and knowledge of human nature may be sufficient to prove the fallacy
 of this theological dogma. Had <strong>S</strong>ATAN any reality,
 in the objective or even subjective world (in the ecclesiastical
 sense), it is the poor devil who would find himself chronically
 obsessed and even possessed by the wicked -- hence by the bulk
 of mankind. It is humanity itself, and especially the clergy,
 headed by the haughty, unscrupulous and intolerant Roman Church,
 which have begotten, given birth to, and reared in love the evil
 one; but this is a digression.
 </p><p>
 "The whole world of thought is reproached by the Church with
 having adored the serpent. The whole of humanity 'incensed and
 at the same time stoned it.' The Zend Avesta speaks of it as the
 Kings and Vedas do, as the Edda and the Bible. . . . Everywhere
 the sacred serpent, the naga, and its shrine and its priest; in
 Rome it is the Vestal who prepares its meal with the same care
 as she bestows on the sacred fire. In Greece, AEsculapius cannot
 cure without its assistance, and delegates to it his powers. Everyone
 has heard of the famous Roman embassy sent by the Senate to the
 god of medicine and its return with the not less famous serpent,
 which proceeded of its own will and by itself toward its Master's
 temple on one of the islands of the Tiber. Not a Bacchante that
 did not wind it (the serpent) in her hair, not an Augur but questioned
 it oracularly, not a necromancer whose tomb is free from its presence!
 The Cainites and the Ophites call it Creator, while recognizing,
 as Schelling did, that the serpent is 'evil in substance and its
 personification.' "*
 </p><p>
 Yes, the author is right, and if one would have a complete idea
 of the prestige which the serpent enjoys to our own day, one ought
 to study the matter in India and learn all that is believed about,
 and still attributed to, the <em>Nagas </em>(Cobras) in that country;
 one should also visit the Africans of Whydah, the Voodoos of Port-au-Prince
 and Jamaica, the Nagals of Mexico, and the Pa, or men-serpents
 of China, &amp;c. But why wonder that the serpent is "adored"
 and at the same time cursed, since we

 know that from the beginning it was a symbol?* In every ancient
 language the word <em>dragon </em>signified what it now does in
 Chinese -- (<em>lang</em>) <em>i.e., </em>"<em>the being
 who excels in intelligence</em>"<em> </em>and in Greek [[<em>drakon</em>]],
 or "he who sees and watches." And is it to the animal
 of that name that any of these epithets can apply? Is it not evident,
 wherever superstition and oblivion of the primitive meaning may
 have led savages now, that the said qualifications were intended
 to apply to the human originals, who were symbolized by serpents
 and dragons? These "originals" -- called to this day
 in China "the Dragons of Wisdom" -- were the first disciples
 of the Dhyanis, who were their instructors; in short, the primitive
 adepts of the Third Race, and later, of the Fourth and Fifth Races.
 The name became universal, and no sane man before the Christian
 era would ever have confounded the man and the symbol.
 </p><p>
 The symbol of Chnouphis, or the soul of the world, writes Champollion,
 "is among others that of an enormous serpent standing on
 human legs; this reptile, the emblem of the good genius, is a
 <em>veritable Agathodaemon. </em>It is often represented bearded.
 . . . . That sacred animal, identical with the serpent of the
 Ophites, is found engraved on numerous Gnostic or Basilidean stones
 . . . . The serpent has various heads, but is constantly inscribed
 with the letters [[<em>CHNOUBIS</em>]]."** Agathodaemon was
 endowed "with the knowledge of good and evil," <em>i.e.</em>,
 with divine Wisdom, as without the former the latter is impossible.***
 Repeating Iamblichus, Champollion shows him to be "the deity
 called [[<em>Eichton]] </em>(or the fire of the celestial gods

 a fanatic of some future new creed, who was bent on glorifying
 <em>his</em> religion at the expense of <em>ancient </em>Christianity,
 were to say: "Everywhere the quadruped lamb was adored. The
 nun placed it, calling it the Agnus, on her bosom; the priest
 laid it on the altar. It figured in every paschal meal, and was
 glorified loudly in every temple. And yet the Christians dreaded
 it and hated it, for they slew and devoured it. . . ." Heathens,
 at any rate, do not eat their sacred symbols. We know of no serpent,
 or reptile-eaters except in Christian civilized countries, where
 they begin with frogs and eels, and must end with real snakes,
 as they have begun with lamb and ended with horse-flesh.

 seven are the seven planetary regents or genii. Therefore Chnouphis
 was the <em>spiritual Sun of Enlightenment,</em> of Wisdom, hence

 **** Hermes, or rather Thot, was a generic name. Abul Teda shows

 Hermes, and the names of Hermes, Nebo, Thot were given respectively
 in various countries to great Initiates. Thus <em>Nebo, </em>the
 son of Merodach and Zarpanitu (whom Herodotus calls Zeus-Belos),
 gave his name to all the great prophets, seers and Initiates.

 the Sun astronomically, and with Wisdom spiritually.</p><hr>

 Hermes), to whom Hermes Trismegistus attributes the invention
 of magic."*
 </p><p>
 The "<em>invention of</em> <em>magic!</em>" A strange
 term to use, as though the unveiling of the eternal and actual
 mysteries of nature could be <em>invented</em>! As well attribute,
 millenniums hence, the <em>invention </em>instead of the discovery
 of radiant matter to Prof. Crookes. Hermes was not the inventor,
 or even the discoverer, for, as said in the foot-note, Thot-Hermes
 is a generic name, as is Enoch (Enoichion, the "inner, spiritual
 eye")<em>, Nebo,</em> the prophet and seer, etc. It is not
 the proper name of any one living man, but a generic title of
 many adepts. Their connection in symbolic allegories with the
 serpent is due to their enlightenment by the solar and planetary
 gods during the earliest intellectual Race, the Third. They are
 all the representative patrons of the Secret Wisdom. Asclepios
 is the son of the Sun-god Apollo -- and he is Mercury; Nebo is
 the son of Bel-Merodach; Vaivasvata Manu, the great Rishi, is
 the son of Vivisvat -- the Sun or Surya, etc., etc. And while,
 astronomically, the Nagas along with the Rishis, the Gandharvas,
 Apsarasas, Gramanis (or Yakshas, minor gods) Yatudhanas and Devas,
 are the Sun's attendants throughout the twelve solar months; in
 theogony, and also in anthropological evolution, they are gods
 and men -- when incarnated in the <em>nether</em> world. Let the
 reader be reminded, in this connection, of the fact that Apollonius
 met in Kashmir Buddhist <em>Nagas -</em>- which are neither serpents
 zoologically, nor yet the <em>Nagas </em>ethnologically, but "wise
 men."
 </p><p>
 The Bible, from <em>Genesis </em>to <em>Revelations, </em>is but
 a series of historical records of the great struggle between white
 and black Magic, between the Adepts of the right path, the Prophets,
 and those of the left, the Levites, the clergy of the brutal masses.
 Even the students of Occultism, though some of them have more
 archaic <b>MSS</b>. and direct teaching to rely upon, find it
 difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the <em>Sodales
 </em>of the Right Path and those of the Left. The great schism
 that arose between the sons of the Fourth Race, as soon as the
 first Temples and Halls of Initiation had been erected under the
 guidance of "the Sons of God," is allegorized in the
 Sons of Jacob. That there were two schools of Magic, and that
 the orthodox Levites did not belong to the <em>holy </em>one,
 is shown in the words pronounced by the dying Jacob. And here
 it may be well to quote a few sentences from "<em>Isis Unveiled.</em>"
 </p><p>
 The dying Jacob thus describes his sons: "Dan," he says,
 "shall be a <em>serpent </em>by the way, an <em>adder </em>in
 the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall
 fall backwards (<em>i.e.,</em> he will teach candidates <em>black</em>
 magic) . . . . I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord!"
 Of Simeon and Levi the patriarch remarks that they" . . .

 <p>
 ments of <em>cruelty </em>are in their habitations. O my soul,
 come not thou into their <em>secret</em>; unto<em> their assembly.</em>"*<em>
 </em>Now in the original, the words "their secret" really
 are "their <strong>S</strong>OD."** And Sod was the
 name for the great mysteries of Baal, Adonis and Bacchus, who
 were all sun-gods and had serpents for symbols. The Kabalists
 explain the allegory of the fiery serpents by saying that this
 was the name given to the tribe of Levi, to all the <em>Levites,
 </em>in short, and that Moses was the chief of the <em>Sodales.</em>***<em>
 </em>It is to the mysteries that the original meaning of the "Dragon-Slayers"
 has to be traced, and the question is fully treated of hereafter.
 </p><p>
 Meanwhile it follows that, if Moses was the chief of the Mysteries,
 he was the Hierophant thereof, and further, if, at the same time,
 we find the prophets thundering against the "abominations"
 of the people of Israel, that there were two schools. "Fiery
 serpents" was, then, simply the epithet given to the Levites
 of the priestly caste, after they had departed from the <em>good
 law, </em>the traditional teachings of Moses: and to all those
 who followed <em>Black Magic. </em>Isaiah, when referring to the
 "rebellious children" who will have to carry their riches
 into the land whence come "the viper and <em>fiery </em>flying<em>
 serpent</em>"<em> </em>(<em>xxx. </em>6), or Chaldea and
 Egypt, whose Initiates had already greatly degenerated in his
 day (700 <strong>B.C</strong>.), meant the sorcerers of those
 lands.**** But these must be carefully distinguished from the
 "Fiery Dragons of Wisdom" and the "Sons of the
 Fire Mist."
 </p><p>
 In the "<em>Great Book of the Mysteries</em>"<em> </em>we
 are told that: "Seven Lords created Seven men; three Lords
 (Dhyan Chohans or Pitris) were holy and good, four less heavenly
 and full of passion. . . . The <em>chhayas </em>(phantoms) of
 the Fathers were as they."
 </p><p>
 This accounts for the differences in human nature, which is divided
 into seven gradations of good and evil. There were seven tabernacles
 ready to be inhabited by Monads under seven different Karmic conditions.
 The Commentaries explain on this basis the easy spread of evil,
 as soon as the human Forms had become real men. Some ancient

 <p>
 philosophers ignored the seven in their genetical accounts and
 gave only four. Thus the Mexican local <em>Genesis </em>has "four
 <em>good </em>men" described as the four real ancestors of
 the human race, "who were neither begotten by the gods nor
 born of woman"; but whose creation was a wonder wrought by
 the creative Powers, and who were made only after "three
 <em>attempts at manufacturing men had failed.</em>"<em> </em>The
 Egyptians had in their theology only "four sons of God,"
 whereas in <em>Pymander seven </em>are given -- thus avoiding
 any mention of the evil nature of man; though when Seth from a
 god sank into Set-Typhon, he began to be called "the seventh
 son." Whence probably arose the belief that "the seventh
 son of the seventh son" is always a natural-born magician,
 though, at first, only a <em>sorcerer </em>was meant. <strong>A</strong>PAP,
 the serpent symbolizing evil, is slain by Aker, Set's serpent;*
 therefore Set-Typhon could not be that evil. In the "<em>Book
 of the Dead</em>"<em> </em>it is commanded (<em>v</em>. 13)
 that chapter clxiii. should be read "in the presence of a
 serpent on two legs," which means a high Initiate, a Hierophant,
 for the discus and ram's horns** that adorn his "serpent's"
 head in the hieroglyphics of the title of the said chapter denote
 this. Over the "serpent" are represented the two mystic
 eyes of Ammon,*** the hidden "mystery god." This passage
 corroborates our assertion, and shows what the word "serpent"
 meant in antiquity.
 </p><p>
 But as to the Nagals and Nargals, whence came the similarity of
 names between the Indian Nagas and the American Nagals?
 </p><p>
 "The Nargal was the Chaldean and Assyrian chief of the Magi
 (Rab-Mag), and the Nagal was the chief sorcerer of the Mexican
 Indians. Both derive their names from Nergal-Serezer, the Assyrian
 god, and the Hindu Nagas. Both have the same faculties and the
 power to have an attendant <em>daemon</em>, with whom they identify
 themselves completely. The Chaldean and Assyrian Nargal kept his
 <em>daemon, </em>in the shape of some animal considered sacred,
 inside the temple; the Indian Nagal keeps his wherever he can
 -- in the neighbouring lake, or wood, or in the house in the shape
 of some household animal."****
 </p><p>
 Such similarity cannot be attributed to <em>coincidence. </em>A
 new world is discovered, and we find that, for our forefathers
 of the Fourth Race,

 are vertical instead of being bent down to the ears, but the emblem
 is the same; hence the Brazen Serpent.

 <p>
 it was already an old one. That Arjuna, Krishna's companion and
 <em>chela, </em>is said to have descended into <em>Patala, </em>the
 "antipodes," and therein married <em>Ulupi,</em>* a
 Naga (or Nagini rather), the daughter of the king of the Nagas,
 Kauravya.**
 </p><p>
 And now it may be hoped the full meaning of the serpent emblem
 is proven. It is neither that of evil, nor, least of all, that
 of the devil; but is <em>,</em> indeed, the [[SEMES EILAM ABRASAX]]
 ("the eternal Sun-Abrasax"), the central spiritual sun
 of all the Kabalists, represented in some diagrams by the circle
 of Tiphereth.
 </p><p>
 And here, again, we may quote from our earlier volumes and enter
 into further explanations.
 </p><p>
 "From this region of unfathomable depth (Bythos, Aditi, Shekinah,
 the veil of the unknown) issues forth a circle formed of spirals.
 This is Tiphereth; which, in the language of symbolism, means
 a grand cycle, composed of smaller ones. Coiled within, so as
 to follow the spirals, lies the serpent -- emblem of Wisdom and
 Eternity -- the dual Androgyne; the cycle representing <em>Ennoia</em>,
 or the divine mind (a power which does not create but which must
 assimilate), and the serpent, the Agathodaemon, the Ophis, <em>the
 Shadow of the Light </em>(non-eternal, yet the greatest divine
 light on our plane). Both were the <em>Logoi </em>of the Ophites:
 or the Unity as <em>Logos </em>manifesting itself as a double
 principle of Good and Evil."
 </p><p>
 Were it light alone, inactive and absolute, the human mind could
 not appreciate nor even realise it. Shadow is that which enables
 light to manifest itself, and gives it objective reality. Therefore,
 shadow is not evil, but is the necessary and indispensable corollary
 which completes Light or Good: <em>it is its creator on Earth.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 According to the views of the Gnostics, these two principles are
 immutable Light and Shadow, Good and Evil being virtually one
 and having existed through all eternity, as they will ever continue
 to exist so long as there are manifested worlds.
 </p><p>
 This symbol accounts for the adoration by this sect of the Serpent,
 as the Saviour, coiled either around the sacramental loaf, or
 a Tau, the phallic emblem. As a Unity, Ennoia and Ophis are the
 <em>Logos. </em>When separated, one is the Tree of Life (spiritual),
 the other, the Tree

 it is neither a Greek nor a Sanskrit name, but reminds one of
 Mexican names.
 </p><p>
 ** "Mahabharata," Adiparva, Sloka, 7788, 7789. The "Bhagavata
 Purana," ix., xx., 31, as explained by Sridhera, the commentator,
 makes Ulupi the daughter of the king of Manipura; but the late
 Pundit Dayanand Saraswati, certainly the greatest Sanskrit and
 Puranic authority in India on such questions, personally corroborated
 that Ulupi was daughter of the king of the Nagas at Patala, or
 America, 5000 years ago, and that the Nagas were Initiates.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 215 BUDDHA'S GREAT MOUNTAIN.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Therefore, we find Ophis urging
 the first human couple -- the material production of Ilda-Baoth,
 but which owed its spiritual principle to Sophia-Achamoth -- to
 eat of the forbidden fruit, although Ophis represents divine Wisdom.
 </p><p>
 The serpent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree
 of Life, are all symbols transplanted from the soil of India.
 The Arasa-Maram, the banyan tree, so sacred with the Hindus (since
 Vishnu during one of his incarnations, reposed under its mighty
 shade and there taught human philosophy and sciences), is called
 the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. Under the protecting
 foliage of this king of the forests, the Gurus teach their pupils
 their first lessons on immortality and initiate them into the
 mysteries of life and death. The Java-Aleim of the Sacerdotal
 College are said, in the Chaldean tradition, to have taught the
 sons of men to become like one of them. To the present day Foh-tchou,*
 who lives in his Foh-Maeyu, or temple of Buddha, on the top of
 the "Kouin-long-sang,"** the great mountain, produces
 his greatest religious miracles under a tree called in Chinese
 Sung-Ming-Shu, or the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life,
 for ignorance is death, and knowledge alone gives immortality.
 This marvellous display takes place every three years, when an
 immense concourse of Chinese Buddhists assembles in pilgrimage
 at the holy place.
 </p><p>
 Now it may become comprehensible why the earliest Initiates and
 Adepts, or the "Wise Men," for whom it is claimed that
 they were initiated into the mysteries of nature by the UNIVERSAL
 MIND, represented by the highest angels, were named the "Serpents
 of Wisdom" and "Dragons;" as also how the first
 physiologically complete couples -- after being initiated into
 the mystery of human creation through Ophis, <em>the manifested
 Logos </em>and the androgyne, by eating of the fruit of knowledge
 -- gradually began to be accused by the material spirit of posterity
 of having <em>committed Sin, </em>of having disobeyed the "Lord
 God," and of having been tempted by the Serpent.
 </p><p>
 So little have the first Christians (who despoiled the Jews of
 their Bible) understood the first four chapters of Genesis in
 their esoteric meaning, that they never perceived that not only
 was no sin intended in this disobedience, but that actually the
 "Serpent" was "the Lord God" himself, who,
 as the Ophis, the Logos, or the bearer of divine creative wisdom,
 taught mankind to become creators in their turn.*** They

 *** Let the reader be reminded that in the <em>Zohar, </em>and
 also in all the Kabalistic works, it is maintained that "Metatron
 united to <em>Shekinah</em>"<em> </em>(or Shekinah as the

 never realised that the <em>Cross was </em>an evolution from the
 "tree and the serpent," and thus <em>became the salvation
 of mankind. </em>By this it would become the very first fundamental
 symbol of Creative cause, applying to geometry, to numbers, to
 astronomy, to measure and to animal reproduction. According to
 the Kabala the <em>curse on man came with the formation of woman.</em>*<em>
 </em>The circle was separated from its diameter line. "From
 the possession of the double principle in one, that is the Androgyne
 condition, the separation of the dual principle was made, presenting
 two opposites, whose destiny it was, for ever after, to seek reunion
 into the original <em>one</em> condition. The curse was this,
 viz.: that nature, impelling the search, evaded the desired result
 by the production of a new being, distinct from that reunion or
 oneness desired, by which the natural longing to recover a lost
 state was and is for ever being cheated. It is by this tantalizing
 process of a continued curse that Nature lives."** (<em>Vide
 </em>"<em>Cross and Circle,</em>"<em> </em>Part II.)
 </p><p>
 The allegory of Adam being driven away from the "Tree of
 Life" means, esoterically, that the newly separated Race
 abused and dragged the mystery of Life down into the region of
 animalism and bestiality. For, as the <em>Zohar </em>shows, that
 Matronethah (Shekinah, the wife of Metatron symbolically) "is
 the way to the great Tree of Life, the Mighty Tree," and
 Shekinah is divine grace. As explained: This Tree reaches the
 heavenly vale and is hidden between three mountains (the upper
 triad of principles, in man). From these three mountains, the
 Tree ascends above (the adept's knowledge aspires heavenward)
 and then redescends below (into the adept's <em>Ego </em>on Earth).
 This Tree is revealed in the day time and is hidden during the
 night, <em>i.e</em>., revealed to an enlightened mind and hidden
 to Ignorance, which is night. (See <em>Zohar </em>I., 172, <em>a</em>
 and <em>b</em>.) "The Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and
 the Evil grows from the roots of the Tree of Life." (Comm.)
 But then also: "In the Kabala it is plainly to be found that
 "the '<em>Tree of Life</em>'<em> </em>was

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] of Ain-Soph), representing
 the Logos, is that very <em>Tree of Knowledge</em>;<em> </em>while
 Shamael -- the dark aspect of the Logos -- occupies only the rind
 of that tree, and has the knowledge of EVIL alone. As Lacour,
 who saw in the scene of the Fall (<em>chap. </em>iii., <em>Genesis</em>)<em>
 </em>an incident pertaining to Egyptian Initiation, says: -- "The
 Tree of the <em>Divination, </em>or of the <em>Knowledge </em>of
 Good and Evil . . . . is the science of <em>Tzyphon, </em>the
 genius of doubt, <em>Tzy</em> to teach, and <em>phon</em>, doubt.
 Tzyphon is one of the Aleim; we shall see him presently under
 the name of <em>Nach, </em>the tempter" (<em>Les OEloim,
 Vol. II.,</em> p. 218). He is now known to the symbologists under
 the name <strong>J</strong>EHOVAH.
 </p><p>
 * This is the view taken and adopted by all the Church Fathers,
 but it is not the real esoteric teaching. The <em>curse </em>did
 not begin with the formation of either man or woman, for their
 separation was a natural sequence of evolution, but for <em>breaking
 the law</em> (<em>See supra</em>).

 the ansated cross in its sexual aspect, and that the '<em>Tree
 of Knowledge</em>'<em> </em>was the separation and the coming
 together again to fulfil the fatal condition. To display this
 in numbers the values of the letters composing the word Otz (
 <img src="sd2-217.gif" align="BOTTOM">), tree, are 7 and 9, the
 seven being the holy feminine number and the nine the number of
 the phallic or male energy. This ansated cross is the symbol of
 the Egyptian <em>female-male, Isis-Osiris, </em>the germinal principle
 in all forms, based on the primal manifestation applicable in
 all directions and in all senses."*
 </p><p>
 This is the Kabalistic view of the Western Occultists, and it
 differs from the more philosophical Eastern or Aryan views upon
 this subject.** The separation of the sexes was in the programme
 of nature and of natural evolution; and the creative faculty in
 male and female was a gift of Divine wisdom. In the truth of such
 traditions the whole of antiquity, from the patrician philosopher
 to the humblest spiritually inclined plebeian, has believed. And
 as we proceed, we may successfully show that the <em>relative
 </em>truth of such legends, if not their absolute exactness --
 vouched for by such giants of intellect as were Solon, Pythagoras,
 Plato, and others -- begins to dawn upon more than one modern
 scientist. He is perplexed; he stands startled and confused before
 proofs that are being daily accumulated before him; he feels that
 there is no way of solving the many historical problems that stare
 him in the face, unless he begins by accepting ancient traditions.
 Therefore, in saying that we believe absolutely in ancient records
 and <em>universal </em>legends, we need hardly plead guilty before
 the impartial observer, for other and far more learned writers,
 among those who belong to the modern scientific school, evidently
 believe in much that the Occultists do: <em>e.g., </em>in "Dragons,"
 not only symbolically, but also in their actual existence at one
 time.
 </p><p>
 "It would have indeed been a bold step for anyone, some thirty
 years ago, to have thought of treating the public to a collection
 of stories ordinarily reputed fabulous, and of claiming for them
 the consideration due to genuine realities, or to have advocated
 tales, believed to be time-honoured fictions, as actual facts;
 and those of the nursery as being, in many instances, legends,
 more or less distorted, descriptive of real beings or events.
 Nowadays it is a less hazardous proceeding . . . . . "
 </p><p>
 Thus opens the introduction to a recent (1886) and most interesting
 work by Mr. Charles Gould, called "Mythical Monsters."
 He boldly states his belief in most of these monsters. He submits
 that: -- "Many of the so-called mythical animals, which,
 throughout long ages and in all nations, have been the fertile
 subjects of fiction and fable, come

 legitimately within the scope of plain matter-of-fact natural
 history; and that they may be considered, not as the outcome of
 exuberant fancy, but as creatures which really once existed, and
 of which, unfortunately, only imperfect and inaccurate descriptions
 have filtered down to us, probably very much refracted, through
 the mists of time. . . . Traditions of creatures <em>once co-existing
 with man, some of which are so weird and terrible as to appear
 at first sight to be impossible. </em>For me the major part of
 those creatures are not chimeras but objects of rational study.
 The dragon, in place of being a creature evolved out of the imagination
 of an Aryan man by the contemplation of lightning flashing through
 the caverns which he tenanted, as is held by some mythologists,
 is an animal which once lived and dragged its ponderous coils
 and perhaps flew. . . . . To me the specific existence of the
 Unicorn seems not incredible, and in fact, more probable than
 that theory which assigns its origin to a lunar myth* . . . For
 my part I doubt the general derivation of myths from 'the contemplation
 of the visible workings of external nature.' It seems to me easier
 to suppose that the palsy of time has enfeebled the utterance
 of these oft-told tales until their original appearance is almost
 unrecognisable, than that <em>uncultured savages should possess
 powers of imagination and poetical invention far beyond those
 enjoyed by the most instructed nations of the present day</em>;<em>
 </em>less hard to believe that these wonderful stories of gods
 and demigods, of giants and dwarfs, of dragons and monsters of
 all descriptions are <em>transformations than to believe </em>them
 to be inventions."**
 </p><p>
 It is shown by the same geologist that man, "successively
 traced to periods <em>variously estimated from thirty thousand
 to one million years . </em>. . . . , co-existed with animals
 which have long since become extinct (<em>p</em>. 20)."<em>
 </em>These animals, "weird and terrible," were, to give
 a few instances -- (1) "Of the <em>genus Cidastes, </em>whose
 huge bones and vertebrae show them to have attained a length of
 nearly two hundred feet . . . . . . " The remains of such
 monsters, no less than ten in number, were seen by Professor Marsh
 in the Mauvaises Terres of Colorado, strewn upon the plains. (2)
 The <em>Titanosaurus montanus, </em>reaching fifty or sixty feet
 in length; (3) the <em>Dinosaurians </em>(in the Jurassic beds
 of the Rocky Mountains), of still more gigantic proportions; (4)
 the <em>Atlanto-Saurus immanis, </em>a<em> femur </em>of which
 alone is over six feet in length, and which would be thus over
 one hundred feet in length! But even yet the line has not been
 reached, and we hear of the discovery of remains of such titanic
 proportions as to possess a thigh-bone over twelve feet in length
 (<em>p</em>. 37). Then we read of the monstrous <em>Sivatherium
 </em>in the Himalayas, the four-horned stag, as large as an elephant,
 and exceeding the latter in height; of the gigantic <em>Megatherium:
 </em>of colossal flying lizards, <em>Pterodactyli, </em>with

 crocodile jaws on a duck's head, etc., etc. <em>All these were

 that, surrounded in Nature with such monstrous creatures, man,
 unless himself a colossal giant, could have survived, while all
 his foes have perished? Is it with his stone hatchet that he had
 the best of a <em>Sivatherium </em>or a gigantic flying saurian?
 Let us always bear in mind that at least one great man of science,
 de Quatrefages, sees no good scientific reasons why man should
 not have been "contemporaneous with the earliest mammalia
 and go back as <em>far as the</em> <em>Secondary Period.</em>"*
 </p><p>
 "It appears," writes the very conservative Professor
 Jukes, "that the flying dragons of romance had something
 like a real existence in former ages of the world."** "Does
 the written history of man," the author goes on to ask, "comprising
 a few thousand years, embrace the whole course of his intelligent
 existence? Or have we in the long mythical eras, extending over
 hundreds of thousands of years, and recorded in the chronologies
 of Chaldea and China, shadowy mementoes of prehistoric man, handed
 down by tradition, and perhaps transported by a few survivors
 to existing lands, from others which, like the fabled Atlantis
 of Plato, may have been submerged, or the scene of some great
 catastrophe which destroyed them with all their civilization;"
 (p. 17).
 </p><p>
 The few remaining giant animals, such as elephants, themselves
 smaller than their ancestors the Mastodons, and Hippopotami, are
 the only surviving relics, and tend to disappear more entirely
 with every day. Even they have already had a few pioneers of their
 future genus, and have decreased in size in the same proportion
 as men did. For the remains of a pigmy elephant were found (<em>E.
 Falconeri</em>)<em> </em>in the cave deposits of Malta; and the
 same author asserts that they were associated with the remains
 of pigmy Hippopotami, the former being "only two feet six
 inches high; or the still-existing <em>Hippopotamus </em>(<em>Choeropsis</em>)<em>
 Liberiensis, </em>which M. Milne-Edwards figures as little more
 than two feet in height."***

 Sceptics may smile and denounce our work as full of nonsense or
 fairy-tales. But by so doing they only justify the wisdom of the
 Chinese philosopher Chuang, who said that "the things that
 men do know can in no way be compared, numerically speaking, to
 the things that are unknown";**** and thus they laugh only
 at their own ignorance.
