 <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>R</strong>ACES WITH THE "<strong>T</strong>HIRD
 <strong>E</strong>YE."
 </p><p>
 The subject is so unusual, the paths pursued so intricate, so
 full of dangerous pitfalls prepared by adverse theories and criticism,
 that good reasons have to be given for every step taken. While
 turning the light of the bull's eye called esotericism on almost
 every inch of the occult grounds travelled over, we have also
 to use its lens to throw into stronger objectivity the regions
 explored by exact science; this, not only in order to contrast
 the two, but to defend our position.*
 </p><p>
 It may be complained by some that too little is said of the physical,
 <em>human </em>side of the extinct races, in this history of their
 growth and evolution. Much more might be said assuredly, if simple
 prudence did not make us hesitate at the threshold of every new
 revelation. That, which finds its possibility and landmarks in
 the discoveries of modern science, is given; all that of which
 exact knowledge knows nothing and upon which it is unable to speculate
 -- and therefore denies as facts in nature -- is withheld.
 </p><p>
 But even such statements as these -- <em>e.g</em>., that of all
 the mammalians, man was the earliest; that it is man who is the
 indirect ancestor of the Ape; and that he was a kind of a Cyclops
 in days of old -- will all be contested, yet, scientists will
 never be able to prove -- except to their own satisfaction --
 that <em>it was not so. </em>Nor can they admit that the first
 two races of men were too ethereal and phantom-like in their constitution,
 organism, and <em>shape, </em>even to be called physical men.
 For, if they do, it will be found that this is one of the reasons
 why their relics can never be expected to be exhumed among other
 fossils. Nevertheless all this is maintained. Man was the store-house,
 so to speak, of <em>all the seeds of life</em>

 * For suggestiveness, we would recommend a short article in the
 <em>Theosophist of </em>August, 1887, "Esoteric Studies."
 Its author expounds therein quite an occult theory, though to
 the world a new idea: "the <em>progress of the Monad </em>concurring
 with the <em>retrogression </em>of Form" (666), <em>i.e</em>.,
 "with decrease of the <em>vis formativa.</em>"<em> </em>He
 says, "Who knows what shape vehicled the Ego in remote <em>rings</em>
 (Rounds, or races?) . . . ? May not man's type have been that
 of the <em>Simiadae </em>in its variety? Might not the monkey-kingdom
 of Ramayana fame rest on some far-off tradition relating to a
 period when that was the common lot, or rather aspect, of man?"
 . . . and winds up a very clever, though too short, exposition
 of his theory by saying that which every true occultist will endorse:
 "With physico-ethereal man there must be <em>involution </em>of
 sex. As physico-astral man depended on entities of the sub-human
 class (evolved from animal prototypes) for rebirth, so will physico-ethereal
 man find among the graceful, shapely orders issuing from the <em>air</em>-plane,
 one or more which will be developed for his successive embodiments
 <em>when procreated forms are given </em>-- a process which will
 include all mankind only very gradually. The (<em>pre</em>?) Adamic
 and post-Adamic races were giants; their ethereal counterparts
 may possibly be liliputians -- beauteous, luminous, diaphanous
 -- but will assuredly be giants in mind" (p. 671, art. by
 Visconde de Figaniere, <strong>F.T.S.</strong>).</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 290 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 for this Round, vegetable and animal alike.* As En-Soph is "One,
 <em>notwithstanding the innumerable forms which are in him</em>"<em>
 </em>(<em>Zohar,</em>" i. 2l<em>a</em>)<em>, </em>so is man,
 on Earth the microcosm of the macrocosm. "As soon as man
 appeared, everything was complete. . . . for everything is comprised
 in man. He <em>unites in himself all forms</em> (<em>Ibid., iii.
 </em>48<em>a</em>)." "The mystery of the <em>earthly
 </em>man is after the mystery of the Heavenly Man" (<em>ii.
 </em>76<em>a</em>). The human form -- so called, because it is
 the vehicle (under whatever shape) of the <em>divine </em>man
 -- is, as so intuitionally remarked by the author of "Esoteric
 Studies,"** the <em>new type, </em>at the beginning of every
 Round, "as man never can be, so he never has been, manifested
 in a shape belonging to the animal kingdom <em>in esse.</em>"<em>
 </em>The author proceeds, "he never formed part of that kingdom.
 Derived, only derived, from the most finished class of the latter,
 a new human form must always have been the <em>new </em>type of
 the cycle. The human shape, in one ring (?), as I imagine, becomes
 cast-off clothes in the next; it is then appropriated by the highest
 order in the servant-kingdom below."
 </p><p>
 If the idea is what we understand it to mean -- for the "rings"
 spoken of throw some confusion upon it -- then it is the correct
 esoteric teaching. Having appeared at the very beginning, and
 at the head of sentient and conscious life, man (the astral, or
 the "Soul," for the Zohar, repeating the archaic teaching,
 distinctly says that "the <em>real </em>man is the Soul,
 and his material frame no part of him") -- man became the
 living and animal <strong>U</strong>NIT, from which the "cast-off
 clothes" determined the shape of every life and animal in
 this Round.***
 </p><p>
 Thus, he "created" for ages the insects, reptiles, birds,
 and animals, unconsciously to himself, from his remains and relics
 from the Third and the Fourth Rounds. The same idea and teaching
 are as distinctly given in the <em>Vendidad </em>of the Mazdeans,
 as they are in the Chaldean and the Mosaic allegory of the Ark,
 all of which are the many national versions of the original legend
 given in the Hindu Scriptures. It is found in the allegory of
 Vaivasvata Manu and <em>his </em>Ark with the Seven Rishis, as
 in that of the Rishis, each of whom is shown the father and
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * It may be objected that this is a contradiction. That, as the
 first Root-Race appeared 300,000,000 years after the vegetation
 had evolved, the seed of vegetable life could not be in the First
 Race. We say it could; for up to man's appearance in this Round,
 the vegetation was of quite another kind than it is now, and quite
 ethereal, this for the simple reason that no grass or plants could
 have been physical, before there were animal or other organisms
 to breathe out the carbonic acid which vegetation has to imbibe
 for its development, its nutrition and growth. They are inter-dependent
 in their <em>physical </em>and achieved forms.

 *** It is stated in the Zohar that the "primordial worlds"
 (sparks) could not continue because <em>man</em> <em>was not as
 yet. </em>"<em>The human</em> form contains everything; and
 as it did not as yet exist, the worlds were destroyed."

 <p>
 progenitor of specified animals, reptiles, and even monsters (<em>See
 Vishnu</em> and other <em>Puranas</em>)<em>. </em>Open the Mazdean
 <em>Vendidad, </em>at Fargard ii., at verse 27 (73) and read the
 command of Ormazd to Yima, a Spirit of the Earth, who symbolizes
 the three races, after telling him to build a <em>vara </em>("an
 enclosure," an <em>argua </em>or vehicle) . . . .
 </p><p>
 "Thither (into the <em>vara</em>) thou shalt bring <em>the
 seeds of men and</em> <em>women, </em>of the greatest, best, and
 finest kinds on this earth; thither thou shalt bring the seeds
 of every kind of cattle," etc., etc.; and v. 28 (74) . .
 . ."all those seeds shalt thou bring, two of every kind,
 <em>to be kept inexhaustible there, </em>so long <em>as those
 men shall stay in the vara.</em>"<em> </em>Those "men"
 in the "Vara" are the "Progenitors," the heavenly
 men or Dhyani, the future <em>Egos </em>who are commissioned to
 inform mankind. For "Vara," or the "Ark" (or
 again the Vehicle) simply means MAN.* Verse 30 says: . . . . "thou
 shalt seal up the vara (after filling it up with the seeds), and
 thou shalt make a door and a <em>window self-shining within,</em>"<em>
 </em>which is the Soul. And when Yima inquires of Ahura Mazda
 how he shall manage to make that <em>vara</em>, he is answered:
 "Crush the earth . . . and knead it with thy hands, as the
 potter does when kneading the potter's clay" (31).
 </p><p>
 The Egyptian ram-headed god makes man of clay on a potter's wheel,
 and so in Genesis do the Elohim fashion him out of the same material.
 </p><p>
 When the "Maker of the material world" (Ahura Mazda)
 is asked, furthermore, what is to give light "to the <em>Vara
 </em>which Yima made," he is told that "There are <em>uncreated
 </em>lights and <em>created </em>lights" and that "there"
 (in Airyana Vaego, where <em>Vara </em>is built), "the stars,
 the moon, and the Sun are only once (a year) seen to rise and
 set" and a year seems only as a day (and night) a clear reference
 to the "land of the Gods" or the (now) polar regions.
 Moreover another hint is contained in this verse: a distinct allusion
 to the "uncreated lights" which enlighten man within
 -- his principles. Otherwise, no sense or reason could be found
 in Ahura Mazda's answer (<em>V.</em> 40), which is forthwith followed
 by Verse 41 saying that "Every fortieth year, to every couple
 (hermaphrodite) <em>two are born, a male and female,"** </em>the
 latter being a distinct echo of the Secret Doctrine, of a Stanza
 which says --
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * This is the meaning when the allegory and symbol are opened
 and read by means of the <em>human </em>key, or the key to terrestrial
 anthroposophy. This interpretation of the "ark" symbolism
 does not in the least interfere with its astronomical, or even
 theogonic keys; nor with any of the other six meanings. Nor does
 it seem less scientific than the modern theories about the origin
 of man. As said, it has seven keys to it, like the rest.
 </p><p>
 ** Vendidad Sadah, See also Bund. <strong>XV</strong>.; and J.
 Darmesteter's translation of the <em>Vendidad. </em>"Sacred
 Books of the East." </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 292 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "<em>At the expiration of every forty </em>(<em>annual</em>)<em>
 Suns, at the end of every</em> <em>fortieth Day, the double one
 becomes four</em>;<em> male and female in one, in the</em> <em>first
 and second and the third</em>. . . . . ."
 </p><p>
 Which is clear, since "every sun" meant a whole year,
 the latter being composed of one day then, as in the arctic circle
 it is now composed of six months. According to the old teaching,
 the axis of the earth gradually changes its inclination to the
 ecliptic, and at the period referred to, this inclination was
 such that a polar day lasted during the whole period of the earth's
 revolution about the sun, when a kind of twilight of very short
 duration intervened; after which the polar land resumed its position
 directly under the solar rays. This may be contrary to astronomy
 as now taught and understood: but who can say that changes in
 the motion of the earth, which do not take place now, did not
 occur millions of years back?
 </p><p>
 Returning once more to the statement that <em>Vara </em>meant
 the MAN of the Fourth Round, as much as the Earth of those days,
 the moon, and even Noah's ark, if one will so have it -- this
 is again shown in the dialogue between Ahura Mazda and Zarathustra.
 Thus when the latter asks --
 </p><p>
 <em>V. </em>42. "O Maker of the Material World, thou Holy
 One! Who is he who brought the law of Mazda into the <em>Vara
 </em>which Yima made?"
 </p><p>
 "Ahura Mazda answered: 'It was the bird Karshipta, O holy
 Zarathustra.' . . . ."
 </p><p>
 "The bird Karshipta dwells in the heavens: were he living
 on the earth he would be king of birds. He brought into the var
 of Yima, and recites the Avesta <em>in the language of birds.</em>"<em>
 </em>(<em>Bund. xix and xxiv.</em>)
 </p><p>
 This again is an allegory and a symbol misunderstood by the Orientalists
 only, who see in this bird "an incarnation of lightning,"
 and say its song was "often thought to be the utterance of
 a god and a revelation," and what not. Karshipta is the human
 mind-soul, and the deity thereof, symbolized in ancient Magianism
 by a bird, as the Greeks symbolized it by a butterfly. No sooner
 had Karshipta entered the <em>Vara </em>or man, than he understood
 the law of Mazda, or Divine Wisdom. In the "Book of Concealed
 Mystery" it is said of the tree, which is the tree of knowledge
 of good and evil: "In its branches (of the tree) the birds
 lodge and build their nests," or <em>the Souls </em>and the
 Angels have their place!.* Therefore, with the Kabalists it was
 a like symbol. "Bird" was a Chaldean, and has become
 a Hebrew synonym and symbol for Angel, a Soul, a Spirit, or Deva;
 and the "Bird's Nest" was with both Heaven, and is God's
 bosom in the <em>Zohar. </em>The perfect Messiah enters Eden "into
 that place which is called the Bird's Nest" (Zohar, ii.,
 8<em>b</em>).

 <p>
 "Like a bird that is flying from its nest, and that is the
 Soul from which the Shekeenah (divine wisdom or grace) does not
 move away" (Zohar, iii., 278<em>a</em>; Myer's Qabbalah,
 217). "The Nest of the eternal Bird, the flutter of whose
 wings produces life, is boundless space," says the Commentary,
 meaning Hansa, the bird of Wisdom.
 </p><p>
 It is Adam Kadmon who is the (Sephirothal) tree, and it is he
 who becomes the "Tree of knowledge of good and evil"
 esoterically. And that "tree hath around it seven columns
 (seven pillars) of the world, or <em>Rectores</em>";<em>
 </em>the same "<em>Progenitors</em>" or<em> </em>"<em>Sephiroth</em>"<em>
 </em>again "operating through the respective orders of Angels
 in the spheres of the seven planets," etc., one of which
 orders begets giants (<em>Nephilim</em>) on Earth.
 </p><p>
 It was the belief of entire antiquity, Pagan and Christian, that
 the earliest mankind was a race of giants. Certain excavations
 in America in mounds and in caves, have already yielded in isolated
 cases groups of skeletons of nine and twelve feet high.* These
 belong to tribes of the early Fifth Race, now degenerated to an
 average size of between five and six feet. But we can easily believe
 that the Titans and Cyclopes of old really belonged to the Fourth
 (Atlantean) Race, and that all the subsequent legends and allegories
 found in the Hindu Puranas and the Greek Hesiod and Homer, were
 based on the hazy reminiscences of real Titans -- men of a superhuman
 tremendous physical power, which enabled them to defend themselves,
 and hold at bay the gigantic monsters of the Mesozoic and early
 Cenozoic times -- and of actual Cyclopes -- three-eyed mortals.
 </p><p>
 It has been often remarked by observant writers, that the "origin
 of nearly every popular myth and legend could be traced invariably
 to a fact in Nature."
 </p><p>
 In these fantastic creations of an exuberant subjectivism, there
 is always an element of the objective and real. The imagination
 of the masses, disorderly and ill-regulated as it may be, could
 never have conceived and fabricated <em>ex nihilo </em>so many
 monstrous figures, such a wealth of extraordinary tales, had it
 not had, to serve it as a central nucleus, those floating reminiscences,
 obscure and vague, which unite the broken links of the chain of
 time to form with them the mysterious, dream foundation of our
 collective consciousness.**

 * Darwinian Evolutionists who are so wont to refer to the evidence
 of <em>reversion to</em> <em>type </em>-- the full meaning of
 which, in the case of human monsters, is embraced in the esoteric
 solution of the embryological problem -- as proof of their arguments,
 would do well to inquire into those instances of <em>modern giants
 </em>who are often 8, 9, and even 11 feet high. Such <em>reversions
 </em>are imperfect, yet undeniable reproductions of the original
 towering man of primeval times.
 </p><p>
 ** See "<em>Mythical Monsters,</em>"<em> </em>by Ch.
 Gould, from whose interesting and scientific volume a few passages
 are quoted further on. See in Mr. Sinnett's "<em>Occult World,</em>"<em>
 </em>the description of a cavern in the Himalayas filled with
 relics of human and animal giant bones.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 294 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The evidence for the Cyclopes -- a race of giants -- will be pointed
 out in forthcoming Sections, in the Cyclopean remnants, so called
 to this day. An indication that, during its evolution and before
 the final adjustment of the human organism -- which became perfect
 and symmetrical only in the Fifth Race -- the early Fourth Race
 may have been three-eyed, without having necessarily a third eye
 in the middle of the brow, like the legendary Cyclops, is also
 furnished by Science.
 </p><p>
 To the Occultists who believe that spiritual and psychic <em>involution</em>
 proceeds on parallel lines with physical <em>evolution</em>;<em>
 </em>that the <em>inner</em> senses -- innate in the first human
 races -- atrophied during racial growth and the material development
 of the outer senses; to the student of Esoteric symbology, finally,
 this statement is no conjecture or possibility, but simply <em>a
 phase of the law of growth, a proven fact, </em>in short. They
 understand the meaning of this passage in the <em>Commentaries
 </em>which says: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>There were four-armed human creatures in those early
 days of the</em> <em>male-females </em>(hermaphrodites); <em>with
 one head, yet three eyes. They</em> <em>could see before them
 and behind them.* A </em><strong>K</strong>ALPA<em> later </em>(after
 the separation of the sexes) <em>men having fallen into matter,
 their spiritual vision</em> <em>became dim</em>;<em> and coordinately
 the third eye commenced to lose its power.</em> . . . <em>When
 the Fourth </em>(<em>Race</em>)<em> arrived at its middle age,
 the inner vision</em> <em>had to be awakened, and </em>acquired
 by artificial stimuli, <em>the process of</em> <em>which was known
 to the old sages.** </em>. . . <em>The third eye, likewise, getting</em>
 <em>gradually </em>PETRIFIED<em>,*** soon disappeared. The double-faced
 became the</em> <em>one-faced, and the eye was drawn deep into
 the head and is now buried</em> <em>under the hair. During the
 activity of the inner man </em>(during trances and spiritual visions)
 <em>the eye swells and expands. The Arhat sees and feels</em>
 <em>it, and regulates his action accordingly</em>. . . . . . .
 . . . . . . .
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Viz., the third eye was at the back of the head. The statement
 that the latest hermaphrodite humanity was "four-armed,"
 unriddles probably the mystery of all the representations and
 idols of the exoteric gods of India. On the Acropolis of Argos,
 there was a [[<em>Zoanon</em>]],<em> </em>a rudely carved wooden
 statue (attributed to Daedalus), representing a three-eyed colossus,
 which was consecrated to Zeus <em>Triopas </em>(three-eyed). The
 head of the "god" has two eyes in its face and one above
 on the top of the forehead. It is considered the most archaic
 of all the ancient statues (<em>Schol. Vatic. ad Eurip. Troad.</em>
 14).
 </p><p>
 ** The <em>Inner</em> <em>sight </em>could henceforth be acquired
 only through training and initiation, save in the cases of "natural
 and born magicians," sensitives and mediums, as they are
 called now.
 </p><p>
 *** This expression "petrified" instead of "ossified"
 is curious. The "back eye," which is of course the <em>pineal
 gland, </em>now so-called, the small pea-like mass of grey nervous
 matter attached to the back of the third ventricle of the brain,
 is said to almost invariably contain <em>mineral concretions </em>and
 <em>sand</em>, and "nothing more." (<em>Vide Infra.</em>)
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 295 OCCULT PHYSIOLOGY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>The undefiled </em>Lanoo (disciple, chela) <em>need fear no
 danger</em>;<em> he who keeps</em> <em>himself not in purity </em>(who
 is not chaste) <em>will receive no help from the</em> '<em>deva
 eye.</em>'<em> </em>"
 </p><p>
 Unfortunately not. The "deva-eye" exists no more for
 the majority of mankind. The <em>third eye is dead, </em>and acts
 no longer; but it has left behind a witness to its existence.
 This witness is now the PINEAL GLAND. As for the "four-armed"
 men, it is they who become the prototypes of the four-armed Hindu
 gods, as shown in a preceding footnote.
 </p><p>
 Such is the mystery of the human eye that, in their vain endeavours
 to explain and account for all the difficulties surrounding its
 action, some scientists have been forced to resort to occult explanations.
 The development of the <em>Human eye </em>gives more support to
 the occult anthropology than to that of the materialistic physiologists.
 "The eyes in the human embryo <em>grow from within without</em>"<em>
 </em>out of the brain, instead of being part of the skin, as in
 the insects and cuttlefish. Professor Lankester, thinking the
 brain a queer place for the eye, and attempting to explain the
 phenomenon on <em>Darwinian lines, </em>suggests the curious view
 that "our" earliest vertebrate ancestor was a <em>transparent
 </em>creature and hence did not mind where the eye was! And so
 was man "a transparent creature" once upon a time, we
 are taught, hence our theory holds good. But how does the Lankester
 hypothesis square with the Haeckelian view that the vertebrate
 eye originated by changes <em>in the epidermis? </em>If it started
 <em>inside, </em>the theory goes into the waste-basket. This seems
 to be proved by embryology. Moreover, Professor Lankester's extraordinary
 suggestion -- or shall we say admission? -- is rendered perhaps
 necessary by evolutionist necessities. Occultism with its teaching
 as to the gradual development of senses "FROM WITHIN WITHOUT,"
 from astral prototypes, is far more satisfactory: The <em>third
 eye retreated</em> <em>inwards </em>when its course was run --
 another point in favour of Occultism.
 </p><p>
 The allegorical expression of the Hindu mystics when speaking
 of the "eye of Siva," the <em>Tri-bochana </em>("three-eyed"),
 thus receives its justification and <em>raison d</em>'<em>etre
 -- the </em>transference of the pineal gland (once that "third
 eye") to the forehead, being an exoteric licence. This throws
 also a light on the mystery -- incomprehensible to some -- of
 the connection between <em>abnormal, </em>or Spiritual Seership,
 and the physiological purity of the Seer. The question is often
 asked, "Why should celibacy and chastity be a <em>sine qua
 non </em>rule and condition of regular <em>chelaship, or </em>the
 development of psychic and occult powers" The answer is contained
 in the Commentary. When we learn that the "third eye"
 was once a physiological organ, and that later on, owing to the
 gradual</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 296 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 disappearance of spirituality and increase of materiality (Spiritual
 nature being extinguished by the physical), it became an atrophied
 organ, as little understood now by physiologists as the spleen
 is -- when we learn this, the connection will become clear. During
 human life the greatest impediment in the way of spiritual development,
 and especially to the acquirement of <em>Yoga </em>powers, is
 the activity of our physiological senses. Sexual action being
 closely connected, by interaction, with the spinal cord and the
 grey matter of the brain, it is useless to give any longer explanation.
 Of course, the normal and abnormal state of the brain, and the
 degree of active work in the <em>medulla oblongata, </em>reacts
 powerfully on the pineal gland, for, owing to the number of "centres"
 in that region, which controls by far the greater majority of
 the physiological actions of the animal economy, and also owing
 to the close and intimate neighbourhood of the two, there must
 be exerted a very powerful "inductive" action by the
 <em>medulla </em>on the pineal gland.
 </p><p>
 All this is quite plain to the Occultist, but is very vague in
 the sight of the general reader. The latter must then be shown
 the possibility of a three-eyed man in nature, in those periods
 when his formation was yet in a comparatively chaotic state. Such
 a possibility may be inferred from anatomical and zoological knowledge,
 first of all; then it may rest on the assumptions of materialistic
 science itself.
 </p><p>
 It is asserted upon the authority of Science, and upon evidence,
 which is not merely a fiction of theoretical speculation this
 time, that many of the animals -- especially among the lower orders
 of the vertebrata -- have a <em>third </em>eye, now atrophied,
 but necessarily active in its origin.* The Hatteria species, a
 lizard of the order <em>Lacertilia, </em>recently discovered in
 New Zealand (<em>a part of ancient Lemuria so called, mark</em>
 <em>well</em>)<em>,</em> presents this peculiarity in a most extraordinary
 manner; and not only the <em>Hatteria punctata, </em>but the chameleon,
 certain reptiles, and even fishes. It was thought, at first, that
 it was no more than the prolongation of the brain ending with
 a small protuberance, called epiphysis, a little bone separated
 from the main bone by a cartilage, and found in every animal.
 But it was soon found to be more than this. It offered -- as its
 development and anatomical structure showed -- such an analogy
 with that of the eye, that it was found impossible to see in it
 any-
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * "Deeply placed within the head, covered by thick skin and
 muscles, true eyes that cannot see are found in certain animals,"
 also, says Haeckel: "Vertebrate . . . blind moles and field
 mice, blind snakes and lizards. . . . They shun daylight . . .
 dwelling under the ground. <em>They were not originally blind
 </em>but have evolved from ancestors that lived in the light and
 had well-developed eyes. The atrophied eye beneath the opaque
 skin may be found in these blind beings in every stage of reversion."
 ("<em>Sense Organs,</em>"<em> Haeckel</em>.)<em> </em>And
 if <em>two </em>eyes could become so atrophied in lower animals,
 why not one eye -- the pineal gland -- in man, who is but a higher
 animal in his physical aspect?</p><hr>

 <p>
 thing else. There were and are paleontologists who feel convinced
 to this day that this "third eye" has functioned in
 its origin, and they are certainly right. For this is what is
 said of the pineal gland in Quain's Anatomy (<em>Vol. II. ninth
 edit., pp. </em>830-851. "<em>Thalamencephalon</em>"
 <em>Interbrain</em>)<em>: -</em>-
 </p><blockquote>
 "It is from this part, constituting at first the whole and
 subsequently the hinder part of the anterior primary encephalic
 vesicle, that the optic vesicles are developed in the earliest
 period, and the fore part is that in connection with which the
 cerebral hemispheres and accompanying parts are formed. The <i>thalamus
 opticus </i>of each side is formed by a lateral thickening of
 the medullary wall, while the interval between, descending towards
 the base, constitutes the cavity of the third ventricle with its
 prolongation in the infundibulum. The grey commissure afterwards
 stretches across the ventricular cavity. . . . . The hinder part
 of the roof is developed by a peculiar process, to be noticed
 later, into the pineal gland, which remains united on each side
 by its pedicles to the <i>thalamus, </i>and behind these a transverse
 band is formed as posterior commissure.
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "The lamina <i>terminalis </i>(<i>lamina cinerea</i>) continues
 to close the third ventricle in front, below it the optic commissure
 forms the floor of the ventricle, and further back the infundibulum
 descends to be united in the <i>sella turcica </i>with the tissue
 adjoining the posterior lobe of the pituitary body.
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "The two <i>optic thalami </i>formed from the posterior and
 outer part of the anterior vesicle, consist at first of a single
 hollow sac of nervous matter, the cavity of which communicates
 on each side in front with that of the commencing cerebral hemispheres,
 and behind with that of the middle cephalic vesicle<i> (corpora</i>
 <i>quadrigemina</i>).<i> </i>Soon, however, by increased deposit
 taking place in their interior, behind, below, and at the sides,
 the<i> thalami</i> become solid, and at the same time a cleft
 or fissure appears between them above, and penetrates down to
 the internal cavity, which continues open at the back part opposite
 the entrance of the Sylvian aqueduct. This cleft or fissure is
 the <i>third ventricle. </i>Behind, the two thalami continue united
 by the <i>posterior commissure, </i>which is distinguishable about
 the end of the third month, and also by the peduncles of the pineal
 gland. . . . .

 <blockquote>
 "At an early period the <i>optic tracts </i>may be recognised
 as hollow prolongations from the outer part of the wall of the

 these tracts are distinctly formed. They subsequently are prolonged
 backwards into connection with the <i>corpora quadrigemina.</i>

 <p>
 The above is specially interesting when it is remembered that,
 were it not for the development of the hinder part of the cerebral
 hemispheres backwards, the pineal gland would be perfectly visible
 on the removal of the parietal bones. It is very interesting also
 to note the obvious connection to be traced between the (originally)
 hollow optic tracts and the eyes anteriorly, the pineal gland
 and its peduncles behind, and all</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 298 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of these with the optic thalami. So that the recent discoveries
 in connection with the third eye of <em>Hatteria punctata </em>have
 a very important bearing on the developmental history of the human
 senses, and on the occult assertions in the text.
 </p><p>
 It is well known, (and also regarded as a fiction now, by those
 who have ceased to believe in the existence of an immortal principle
 in man,) that Descartes saw in the pineal gland the <em>Seat of
 the Soul. </em>Although it is joined to every part of the body,
 he said, there is one special portion of it in which the Soul
 exercises its functions more specially than in any other. And,
 as neither the heart, nor yet the brain could be that "special"
 locality, he concluded that it was that little gland tied to the
 brain, yet having an action independent of it, as it could easily
 be put into a kind of swinging motion "<em>by the animal</em>
 <em>Spirits* which cross </em>the cavities of the skull in every
 sense."
 </p><p>
 Unscientific as this may appear in our day of exact learning,
 Descartes was yet far nearer the occult truth than is any Haeckel.
 For the pineal gland, as shown, is far more connected with Soul
 and Spirit than with the physiological senses of man. Had the
 leading Scientists a glimmer of the <em>real </em>processes employed
 by the Evolutionary Impulse, and the winding <em>cyclic </em>course
 of this great law, they would <em>know </em>instead of conjecturing;
 and feel as certain of the future physical transformations of
 the human kind by the knowledge of its past forms. Then, would
 they see the fallacy and all the absurdity of their modern "blind-force"
 and mechanical processes of nature; realizing, in consequence
 of such knowledge, that the said pineal gland, for instance, could
 not but be disabled for <em>physical </em>use at this stage of
 our cycle. If the odd "eye" in man is now atrophied,
 it is a proof that, as in the lower animal, it has once been active;
 for nature never creates the smallest, the most insignificant
 form without some definite purpose and use. It was an <em>active
 </em>organ, we say, at that stage of evolution when the spiritual
 element in man reigned supreme over the hardly nascent intellectual
 and psychic elements. And, as the cycle ran down toward that point
 when the physiological senses were developed by, and went <em>pari
 passu </em>with, the growth and consolidation of the physical
 man, the interminable and complex vicissitudes and tribulations
 of zoological development, that median "eye" ended by
 atrophying along with the early spiritual and purely psychic characteristics
 in man. The eye is the mirror and also the window of the soul,
 says popular wisdom,** and <em>Vox populi Vox Dei.</em>

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 299 THE EVOLUTION OF THE EYE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 In the beginning, every class and family of living species was
 hermaphrodite and objectively one-eyed. In the animal, whose form
 was as ethereal (astrally) as that of man, before the bodies of
 both began to evolve their coats of skin, viz., to evolve from
 <em>within without </em>the thick coating of physical substance
 or matter with its internal physiological mechanism -- the third
 eye was primarily, as in man, the only seeing organ. The two physical
 front eyes developed* later on in both brute and man, whose organ
 of physical sight was, at the commencement of the Third Race,
 in the same position as that of some of the blind vertebrata,
 in our day, <em>i.e</em>., beneath an opaque skin.** Only the
 stages of the <em>odd, </em>or primeval eye, in man and brute,
 are now inverted, as the former has already passed that animal
 <em>non-rational </em>stage in the Third Round, and is ahead of
 mere brute creation by a whole plane of consciousness. Therefore,
 while the "Cyclopean" eye was, and still <em>is, </em>in
 man the organ of <em>spiritual </em>sight, in the animal it was
 that of objective vision. And this eye, having performed its function,
 was replaced, in the course of physical evolution from the simple
 to the complex, by two eyes, and thus was stored and laid aside
 by nature for further use in AEons to come.
 </p><p>
 This explains why the pineal gland reached its highest development
 proportionately with the lowest physical development. It is the
 vertebrata in which it is the most prominent and objective, and
 in man it is

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] and ethereal without;
 the <em>second, </em>psycho-spiritual mentally, and ethero-physical
 bodily; the <em>third, </em>still bereft of intellect in its beginning,
 is astro-physical in its body, and lives an inner life, in which
 the psycho-spiritual element is in no way interfered with as yet
 by the hardly nascent physiological senses. Its two front eyes
 look before them without seeing either past or future. But the
 "third eye" "<em>embraces ETERNITY.</em>"
 </p><p>
 * But in a very different manner to that pictured by Haeckel as
 an "<em>evolution by</em> <em>natural selection in the struggle
 for existence</em>"<em> </em>("<em>Pedigree of Man.</em>"<em>
 </em>"<em>Sense Organs,</em>" p. 335). The mere "thermal
 sensibility of the skin," to hypothetical light-waves, is
 absurdly incompetent to account for the beautiful combination
 of adaptations present in the eye. It has, moreover, been previously
 shown that "natural Selection" is a pure myth when credited
 with the <em>origination </em>of variations (<em>vide infra, Part
 III., on Darwinian mechanical causation</em>);<em> </em>as the
 "survival of the fittest" can only take place after
 useful variations have sprung up, together with improved organisms.
 Whence came the "useful variations," which developed
 the eye? Only from "blind forces . . . without aim, without
 design?" The argument is puerile. The true solution of the
 mystery is to be found in the impersonal Divine Wisdom, in its
 <strong>I</strong>DEATION -- reflected through matter.
 </p><p>
 ** Palaeontology has ascertained that in the animals of the Cenozoic
 age -- the Saurians especially, such as the antediluvian <em>Labyrinthodon,
 </em>whose fossil skull exhibits a perforation otherwise inexplicable
 -- the third, or odd eye must have been much developed. Several
 naturalists, among others E. Korscheldt, feel convinced that whereas,
 notwithstanding the opaque skin covering it, such an eye in the
 reptiles of the present period can only distinguish light from
 darkness (as the human eyes do when bound with a handkerchief,
 or even tightly closed), in the now extinct animals that eye functioned
 and was a real organ of vision.</p><hr>

 <p>
 most carefully hidden and inaccessible, except to the anatomist.
 No less light is thrown thereby on the future physical, spiritual,
 and intellectual state of mankind, in periods corresponding on
 parallel lines with other past periods, and always on the lines
 of ascending and descending cyclic evolution and development.
 Thus, a few centuries before the <em>Kali yuga -- </em>the black
 age which began nearly 5,000 years ago -- it was said (paraphrased
 into comprehensible sentences):
 </p><p>
 "<em>We </em>(the Fifth Root-Race) <em>in our first half
 </em>(of duration) <em>onward</em> (on the now ASCENDING arc of
 the cycle) <em>are on the mid point of </em>(or between) <em>the
 First and the Second Races -- falling downward </em>(<em>i.e.,
 </em>the races were then on the descending arc of the cycle).
 . . . . <em>Calculate for thyself,</em> Lanoo, <em>and see.</em>"<em>
 </em>(Commentary xx.).
 </p><p>
 Calculating as advised, we find that during that transitional
 period -- namely, in the second half of the First Spiritual ethero-astral
 race -- nascent mankind was devoid of the intellectual brain element.
 As it was on its <em>descending </em>line, and as we are parallel
 to it, on the <em>ascending, </em>we are,
 </p><blockquote>
 EVOLUTION OF ROOT RACES IN THE FOURTH ROUND
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 <img src="sd2-300.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 therefore devoid of the Spiritual element, which is now replaced
 by the intellectual. For, remember well, as we are in the <em>manasa
 </em>period of our cycle of races, or in the Fifth, we have, therefore,
 crossed the meridian point of the perfect adjustment of Spirit
 and Matter -- or that equilibrium between brain intellect and
 Spiritual perception. One important point has, however, to be
 borne in mind. </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 301 THE ODD EYE IS NOW A GLAND.</h6>
 
 <p>
 We are only in the Fourth Round, and it is in the Fifth that the
 full development of <em>Manas, </em>as a direct ray from the Universal
 MAHAT -- a ray unimpeded by matter -- will be finally reached.
 Nevertheless, as every sub-race and nation have their cycles and
 stages of developmental evolution repeated on a smaller scale,
 it must be the more so in the case of a Root-Race. Our race then
 has, as a Root-race, crossed the equatorial line and is cycling
 onward on the Spiritual side; but some of our sub-races still
 find themselves on the shadowy descending arc of their respective
 national cycles; while others again -- the oldest -- having crossed
 their crucial point, which alone decides whether a race, a nation,
 or a tribe will live or perish, are at the apex of spiritual development
 as sub-races.
 </p><p>
 It becomes comprehensible now why the "odd eye" has
 been gradually transformed into a simple gland, after the physical
 Fall of those we have agreed to call the "Lemurians."
 </p><p>
 It is a curious fact that it is especially in human beings that
 the cerebral hemispheres and the lateral ventricles have been
 developed, and that the <em>optic thalami, corpora quadrigemina,
 </em>and <em>corpora striata</em> are the principal parts which
 are developed in the mammalian brain. Moreover it is asserted
 that the intellect of any man may to some extent be gauged by
 the development of the central convolutions and the fore part
 of the cerebral hemispheres. It would seem a natural corollary
 that if the development and increased size of the pineal gland
 may be considered to be an index of the astral capacities and
 spiritual proclivities of any man, there will be a corresponding
 development of that part of the cranium, or an increase in the
 size of the pineal gland at the expense of the hinder part of
 the cerebral hemispheres. It is a curious speculation which would
 receive a confirmation in this case. We should see, below and
 behind, the cerebellum which has been held to be the seat of all
 the animal proclivities of a human being, and which is allowed
 by science to be the great centre for all the physiologically
 co-ordinated movements of the body, such as walking, eating, etc.,
 etc.; in front, the fore-part of the brain -- the cerebral hemispheres
 -- the part especially connected with the development of the intellectual
 powers in man; and in the middle, dominating them both, and especially
 the animal functions, the developed pineal gland, in connection
 with the more highly evolved, or spiritual man.
 </p><p>
 It must be remembered that these are only physical correspondences;
 just as the ordinary human brain is the registering organ of memory,
 but not memory itself.
 </p><p>
 This is, then, the organ which gave rise to so many legends and
 traditions, among others to that of man with one head but two
 faces. These may be found in several Chinese works, besides being
 referred to in the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 302 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Chaldean fragments. Apart from the work already cited -- the Shan
 Hai King, compiled by King Chia from engravings on nine urns made
 2,255 <strong>B.C</strong>., by the Emperor Yu, they may be found
 in another work, called the "Bamboo Books," and in a
 third one, the "Rh Ya" -- "initiated according
 to tradition by Chow Kung, uncle of Wu Wang, the first Emperor
 of the Chow Dynasty, <strong>B.C</strong>., 1,122": -- says
 Mr. Ch. Gould in his "<em>Mythical Monsters.</em>"<em>
 </em>The Bamboo Books contain the ancient annals of China, found
 <strong>A.D</strong>. 279 at the opening of the grave of King
 Seang of Wai, who died <strong>B.C</strong>. 295. Both these works
 mention men with two faces on one head -- one in front and one
 behind (<em>p</em>. 27).
 </p><p>
 Now that which the students of Occultism ought to know is that
 THE "THIRD EYE" IS INDISSOLUBLY CONNECTED WITH <strong>K</strong>ARMA.
 The tenet is so mysterious that very few have heard of it.
 </p><p>
 The "eye of Siva" did not become entirely atrophied
 before the close of the Fourth Race. When spirituality and all
 the divine powers and attributes of the deva-man of the Third
 had been made the hand-maidens of the newly-awakened physiological
 and psychic passions of the physical man, instead of the reverse,
 the eye lost its powers. But such was the law of Evolution, and
 it was, in strict accuracy, no FALL. The sin was not in using
 those newly-developed powers, but in <em>misusing </em>them; in
 making of the tabernacle, designed to contain a god, the fane
 of every <em>spiritual </em>iniquity. And if we say "sin"
 it is merely that everyone should understand our meaning; as the
 term <em>Karma* </em>would be the right one to use in this case;
 while the reader who would feel perplexed at the use of the term
 "spiritual" instead of "physical" iniquity,
 is reminded of the fact that there can be no physical iniquity.
 The body is simply the irresponsible organ, the tool of the <em>psychic,
 </em>if not of the "Spiritual man." While in the case
 of the Atlanteans, it was precisely the Spiritual being which
 sinned, the Spirit element being still the "Master"
 principle in man, in those days. Thus it is in those days that
 the heaviest Karma of the Fifth Race was generated by our Monads.
 </p><p>
 As this sentence may again be found puzzling, it is better that
 it should be explained for the benefit of those who are ignorant
 of the theosophical teachings.
 </p><p>
 Questions with regard to <em>Karma </em>and <em>re-births </em>are
 constantly offered, and a great confusion seems to exist upon
 this subject. Those who are born and bred in the Christian faith,
 and have been trained in the idea
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Karma is a word of many meanings, and has a special term for
 almost every one of its aspects. It means, as a synonym of sin,
 the performance of some action for the attainment of an object
 of <em>worldly</em>, hence<em> selfish, </em>desire, which cannot
 fail to be hurtful to somebody else. Karman is action, the Cause;
 and Karma again is "the law of ethical causation"; the
 <em>effect </em>of an act produced egotistically, when the great
 law of harmony depends on altruism.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 303 THE NUMBER OF MONADS IS LIMITED.</h6>
 
 <p>
 that a new soul is created by God for every newly-born infant,
 are among the most perplexed. They ask whether in such case the
 number of incarnating Monads on earth is limited; to which they
 are answered in the affirmative. For, however countless, in our
 conceptions, the number of the incarnating monads -- even if we
 take into account the fact that ever since the Second Race, when
 their respective seven groups were furnished with bodies, several
 births and deaths may be allowed for every second of time in the
 aeons already passed -- still, there must be a limit. It was stated
 that Karma-Nemesis, whose bond-maid is Nature, adjusted everything
 in the most harmonious manner; and that, therefore, the fresh
 pouring-in, or arrival of new Monads, had ceased as soon as Humanity
 had reached its full physical development. No fresh Monads have
 incarnated since the middle-point of the Atlanteans. Hence, remembering
 that, save in the case of young children, and of individuals whose
 lives were violently cut off by some accident, no Spiritual Entity
 can re-incarnate before a period of many centuries has elapsed,
 such gaps alone must show that the number of Monads is necessarily
 finite and limited. Moreover, a reasonable time must be given
 to other animals for their evolutionary progress.
 </p><p>
 Hence the assertion that many of us are now working off the effects
 of the evil Karmic causes produced by us in Atlantean bodies.
 The Law of <strong>K</strong>ARMA is inextricably interwoven with
 that of Re-incarnation.
 </p><p>
 It is only the knowledge of the constant re-births of one and
 the same individuality throughout the life-cycle; the assurance
 that the same <strong>M</strong>ONADS -- among whom are many Dhyan-Chohans,
 or the "Gods" themselves -- have to pass through the
 "Circle of Necessity," rewarded or punished by such
 rebirth for the suffering endured or crimes committed in the former
 life; that those very Monads, which entered the empty, senseless
 shells, or astral figures of the First Race emanated by the Pitris,
 are the same who are now amongst us -- nay, ourselves, perchance;
 it is only this doctrine, we say, that can explain to us the mysterious
 problem of Good and Evil, and reconcile man to the terrible and
 <em>apparent</em> injustice of life. Nothing but such certainty
 can quiet our revolted sense of justice. For, when one unacquainted
 with the noble doctrine looks around him, and observes the inequalities
 of birth and fortune, of intellect and capacities; when one sees
 honour paid fools and profligates, on whom fortune has heaped
 her favours by mere privilege of birth, and their nearest neighbour,
 with all his intellect and noble virtues ---far more deserving
 in every way --perishing of want and for lack of sympathy; when
 one sees all this and has to turn away, helpless to relieve the
 undeserved suffering, one's ears ringing and heart aching with
 the cries of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 304 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 pain around him -- that blessed knowledge of Karma alone prevents
 him from cursing life and men, as well as their supposed Creator.*
 </p><p>
 Of all the terrible blasphemies and accusations virtually thrown
 on their God by the Monotheists, none is greater or more unpardonable
 than that (almost always) false humility which makes the presumably
 "pious" Christian assert, in connection with every evil
 and undeserved blow, that "such <em>is the will </em>of God."
 </p><p>
 Dolts and hypocrites! Blasphemers and impious Pharisees, who speak
 in the same breath of the endless merciful love and care of their
 God and creator for helpless man, and of that God <em>scourging
 the good, the</em> <em>very best of his creatures, bleeding them
 to death like an insatiable</em> <em>Moloch! </em>Shall we be
 answered to this, in Congreve's words: --
 </p><p>
 "But who shall dare to tax Eternal Justice?" <em>Logic
 and simple</em> <em>common sense, </em>we answer: if we are made
 to believe in the "original Sin," in <em>one </em>life,
 on this Earth only, for every Soul, and in an anthropomorphic
 Deity, who seems to have created some men only for the pleasure
 of condemning them to eternal hell-fire (and this whether they
 are good or bad, says the Predestinarian),** why should not every
 man endowed with reasoning powers condemn in his turn such a villainous
 Deity? Life would become unbearable, if one had to believe in
 the God created by man's unclean fancy. Luckily he exists only
 in human dogmas, and in the unhealthy imagination of some poets,
 who believe they have solved the problem by addressing him as
 --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Thou great Mysterious Power, who hast <i>involved</i> <br>
 The pride of human wisdom, <i>to confound</i> <br>
 The <i>daring scrutiny </i>and prove <i>the faith</i> <br>
 Of thy <i>presuming</i> creatures! . . . ."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Truly a robust "faith" is required to believe that it
 is "presumption" to question the justice of one, who
 creates helpless little man but to "perplex" him, and
 to test a "faith" with which that "Power,"
 moreover, may have forgotten, if not neglected, to endow him,
 as happens sometimes.
 </p><p>
 Compare this blind faith with the philosophical belief, based
 on every reasonable evidence and life-experience, in Karma-Nemesis,
 or the Law of Retribution. This Law -- whether Conscious or Uncon-

 * Objectors to the doctrine of Karma should recall the fact that
 it is absolutely <em>out of the question </em>to attempt a reply
 to the Pessimists on other data. A firm grasp of the principles
 of Karmic Law knocks away the whole basis of the imposing fabric
 reared by the disciples of Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann.

 scious -- predestines nothing and no one. It exists from and in
 Eternity, truly, for it is <strong>E</strong>TERNITY itself; and
 as such, since no act can be co-equal with eternity, it cannot
 be said to act, for it is ACTION itself. It is not the Wave which
 drowns a man, but the <em>personal </em>action of the wretch,
 who goes deliberately and places himself under the <em>impersonal
 </em>action of the laws that govern the Ocean's motion. Karma
 creates nothing, nor does it design. It is man who plans and creates
 causes, and Karmic law adjusts the effects; which adjustment is
 not an act, but universal harmony, tending ever to resume its
 original position, like a bough, which, bent down too forcibly,
 rebounds with corresponding vigour. If it happen to dislocate
 the arm that tried to bend it out of its natural position, shall
 we say that it is the bough which broke our arm, or that our own
 folly has brought us to grief? Karma has never sought to destroy
 intellectual and individual liberty, like the God invented by
 the Monotheists. It has not involved its decrees in darkness purposely
 to perplex man; nor shall it punish him who dares to scrutinise
 its mysteries. On the contrary, he who unveils through study and
 meditation its intricate paths, and throws light on those dark
 ways, in the windings of which so many men perish owing to their
 ignorance of the labyrinth of life, is working for the good of
 his fellow-men. <strong>K</strong>ARMA is an Absolute and Eternal
 law in the World of manifestation; and as there can only be one
 Absolute, as One eternal ever present Cause, believers in Karma
 cannot be regarded as Atheists or materialists -- still less as
 fatalists:"
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Some theosophists, in order to make Karma more comprehensible
 to the Western mind, as being better acquainted with the Greek
 than with Aryan philosophy, have made an attempt to translate
 it by <em>Nemesis. </em>Had the latter been known to the profane
 in antiquity, as it was understood by the Initiate, this translation
 of the term would be unobjectionable. As it is, it has been too
 much anthropomorphised by Greek fancy to permit our using it without
 an elaborate explanation. With the early Greeks, "from Homer
 to Herodotus, she was no goddess, but a <em>moral feeling </em>rather,"
 says Decharme; the barrier to evil and immorality. He who transgresses
 it, commits a sacrilege in the eyes of the gods, and is pursued
 by Nemesis. But, with time, that "feeling" was deified,
 and its personification became an ever-fatal and punishing goddess.
 Therefore, if we would connect Karma with Nemesis, it has to be
 done in the triple character of the latter, viz., as Nemesis,
 Adrasteia and Themis. For, while the latter is the goddess of
 Universal Order and Harmony, who, like Nemesis, is commissioned
 to repress every excess, and keep man within the limits of Nature
 and righteousness under severe penalty, <em>Adrasteia -- </em>"the
 inevitable" -- represents Nemesis as the immutable effect
 of causes created by man himself. Nemesis, as the daughter of
 <em>Dike, </em>is the equitable goddess reserving her wrath for
 those alone who are maddened with pride, egoism, and impiety.
 (<em>See Mesomed. Hymn. Nemes., V. 2. Brunck, Analecta II.</em>
 <em>p</em>. 292;<em> Mythol. de la Grece Antique, p. </em>304.)
 In short, while Nemesis is a mythological, exoteric goddess, or
 Power, personified and anthropomorphised in its various aspects,
 <em>Karma </em>is a highly philosophical truth, a most divine
 noble expression of the primitive intuition of man concerning
 Deity. It is a doctrine which explains the origin of Evil, and
 [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 306 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 for Karma is one with the Unknowable, of which it is an aspect
 in its effects in the phenomenal world.
 </p><p>
 Intimately, or rather indissolubly, connected with Karma, then,
 is the law of re-birth, or of the re-incarnation of the same spiritual
 individuality in a long, almost interminable, series of personalities.
 The latter are like the various costumes and characters played
 by the same actor, with each of which that actor identifies himself
 and is identified by the public, for the space of a few hours.
 The <em>inner, </em>or real man, who personates those characters,
 knows the whole time that he is Hamlet for the brief space of
 a few acts, which represent, however, on the plane of human illusion
 the whole life of Hamlet. And he knows that he was, the night
 before, King Lear, the transformation in his turn of the Othello
 of a still earlier preceding night; but the outer, visible character
 is supposed to be ignorant of the fact. In actual life that ignorance
 is, unfortunately, but too real. Nevertheless, the <em>permanent
 </em>individuality is fully aware of the fact, though, through
 the atrophy of the "spiritual" eye in the physical body,
 that knowledge is unable to impress itself on the consciousness
 of the false personality.
 </p><p>
 The possession of a physical <em>third </em>eye, we are told,
 was enjoyed by the men of the Third Root-Race down to nearly the
 middle period of Third <strong>S</strong>UB-race of the Fourth
 Root-Race, when the consolidation and perfection of the human
 frame made it disappear from the outward anatomy of man. Psychically
 and spiritually, however, its mental and visual perceptions lasted
 till nearly the end of the Fourth Race, when its functions, owing
 to the materiality and depraved condition of mankind, died out
 altogether before the submersion of the bulk of the Atlantean
 continent. And now we may return to the Deluges and their many
 "Noahs."
 </p><p>
 The student has to bear in mind that there were many such deluges
 as that mentioned in Genesis, and three far more important ones,
 which will be mentioned and described in the Section devoted to
 the subject of pre-historic continents. To avoid erroneous conjectures,
 however, with regard to the claim that the esoteric doctrine has
 much in it of the legends contained in the Hindu Scriptures; that,
 again, the chronology of the latter is almost that of the former
 -- only explained and made clear; and that finally the belief
 that "Vaivasvata Manu" -- a generic name indeed! --
 was the Noah of the Aryans and his prototype, all this, which
 is also the belief of the Occultists, necessitates at this juncture
 a new explanation. (<em>Vide</em> Part III. <em> </em>"<em>Submerged
 Continents.</em>")
