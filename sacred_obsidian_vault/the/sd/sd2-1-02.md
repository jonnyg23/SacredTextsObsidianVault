 (<em>a</em>) Lha is the ancient word in trans-Himalayan regions
 for "Spirit," any celestial or <em>superhuman </em>Being,
 and it covers the whole series of heavenly hierarchies, from Archangel,
 or Dhyani, down to an angel of darkness, or terrestrial Spirit.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) This expression shows in plain language that the
 Spirit-Guardian of our globe, which is the fourth in the chain,
 is subordinate to the chief Spirit (or God) of the Seven Planetary
 Genii or Spirits. As already explained, the ancients had, in their
 Kyriel of gods, seven chief Mystery-gods, whose chief was, <em>exoterically,
 </em>the visible Sun, or the eighth, and,<em> esoterically, </em>the<em>
 second Logos, </em>the Demiurge. The seven (who have now become
 the "Seven Eyes of the Lord" in the Christian religion)
 were the regents of the seven <em>chief </em>planets; but these
 were not

 * All the words and sentences placed in brackets in the Stanzas
 and Commentaries are the writer's. In some places they may be
 incomplete and even inadequate from the Hindu standpoint; but
 in the meaning attached to them in Trans-Himalayan Esotericism
 they are correct. In every case the writer takes any blame upon
 herself. Having never claimed personal infallibility, that which
 is given on her own authority may leave much to be desired, in
 the very abstruse cases where too deep metaphysics is involved.
 The teaching is offered as it is understood; and as there are
 seven keys of interpretation to every symbol and allegory, that
 which may not fit a meaning, say from the psychological or astronomical
 aspect, will be found quite correct from the physical or metaphysical.

 <p>
 reckoned according to the enumeration devised later by people
 who had forgotten, or who had an inadequate notion of, the real
 <em>Mysteries, </em>and included neither the sun, the moon, nor
 the earth. The sun was the chief, exoterically, of the twelve
 great gods, or zodiacal constellations; and, esoterically, the
 Messiah, the Christos (the subject <em>anointed </em>by the <strong>G</strong>reat
 <strong>B</strong>REATH, or the <strong>O</strong>NE) surrounded
 by his twelve subordinate powers, also subordinate, in turn, to
 each of the seven "Mystery-gods" of the planets.
 </p><p>
 "The seven higher make the Seven Lhas create the world,"
 states a Commentary; which means that our Earth, leaving aside
 the rest, was <em>created </em>or fashioned by terrestrial spirits,
 the "Regents" being simply the supervisors. This is
 the first germ, the seed of that which grew later into the Tree
 of Astrology and Astrolatry. The Higher ones were the <em>Kosmocratores,
 </em>the fabricators of our solar system. This is borne out by
 all the ancient Cosmogonies: that of Hermes, of the Chaldees,
 of the Aryans, of the Egyptians, and even of the Jews. Heaven's
 belt, the signs of the Zodiac (the <em>Sacred animals</em>)<em>,
 </em>are as much the Bne' Alhim (Sons of the Gods or the Elohim)
 as the Spirits of the Earth; but they are prior to them. Soma
 and Sin, Isis and Diana, are all lunar gods or goddesses, called
 the fathers and mothers of our Earth, which is subordinate to
 them. But these, in their turn, are subordinate to their "Fathers"
 and "Mothers" -- the latter interchangeable and varying
 with each nation -- the gods and their planets, such as Jupiter,
 Saturn Bel, Brihaspati, etc.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) "His breath gave life to the seven," refers
 as much to the sun, who gives life to the Planets, as to the "High
 One," the <em>Spiritual Sun, </em>who gives life to the whole
 Kosmos. The astronomical and astrological keys opening the gate
 leading to the mysteries of Theogony can be found only in the
 later glossaries, which accompany the Stanzas.
 </p><p>
 In the apocalyptic Slokas of the Archaic Records, the language
 is as symbolical, if less mythical, than in the Puranas. Without
 the help of the later <em>commentaries,</em>compiled by generations
 of adepts, it would be impossible to understand the meaning correctly.
 In the ancient Cosmogonies, the visible and the invisible worlds
 are the double links of one and the same chain. As the invisible
 <em>Logos, </em>with its seven hierarchies (represented or personified
 each by its chief angel or rector), form one POWER, the inner
 and the invisible; so, in the world of Forms, the Sun and the
 seven chief Planets constitute the visible and active potency;
 the latter "Hierarchy" being, so to speak, the visible
 and objective <em>Logos </em>of the invisible and (except in the
 lowest grades) ever-subjective angels.
 </p><p>
 Thus -- to anticipate a little by way of illustration -- every
 Race in its</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 24 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 evolution is said to be born under the direct influence of one
 of the Planets: Race the first receiving its breath of life from
 the Sun, as will be seen later on; while the third humanity --
 those who fell into generation, or from androgynes became separate
 entities, one male and the other female -- are said to be under
 the direct influence of Venus, "<em>the little sun </em>in
 which the solar orb stores his light."
 </p><p>
 The summation of the Stanzas in Book I. showed the genesis* of
 Gods and men taking rise in, and from, one and the same Point,
 which is the One Universal, Immutable, Eternal, and absolute <strong>U</strong>NITY.
 In its primary manifested aspect we have seen it become: (1) in
 the sphere of objectivity and Physics, Primordial Substance and
 Force (centripetal and centrifugal, positive and negative, male
 and female, etc., etc.); (2) in the world of Metaphysics, the
 <strong>S</strong>PIRIT OF THE <strong>U</strong>NIVERSE, or Cosmic
 Ideation, called by some the <strong>L</strong>OGOS.
 </p><p>
 This <strong>L</strong>OGOS is the apex of the Pythagorean triangle.
 When the triangle is complete it becomes the Tetraktis, or the
 Triangle in the Square, and is the dual symbol of the four-lettered
 <em>Tetragrammaton</em> in the manifested Kosmos, and of its radical
 triple RAY in the unmanifested, or its <em>noumenon.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Put more metaphysically, the classification given here of Cosmic
 Ultimates, is more one of convenience than of absolute philosophical
 accuracy. At the commencement of a great Manvantara, Parabrahm
 manifests as Mulaprakriti and then as the Logos. This Logos is
 equivalent to the "Unconscious Universal Mind," etc.,
 of Western Pantheists. It constitutes the Basis of the SUBJECT-side
 of manifested Being, and is the source of all manifestations of
 individual consciousness. Mulaprakriti or Primordial Cosmic Substance,
 is the foundation of the OBJECT-side of things -- the basis of
 all objective evolution and Cosmogenesis. Force, then, does not
 emerge with Primordial Substance from Parabrahmic Latency. It
 is <em>the transformation into energy of the supra-conscious thought
 of the Logos, </em>infused, so to speak, into the objectivation
 of the latter out of potential latency in the One Reality. Hence
 spring the wondrous laws of matter: hence the "primal impress"
 so vainly discussed by Bishop Temple. Force thus is <em>not synchronous
 with the first objectivation of Mulaprakriti. </em>But as, apart
 from it, the latter is absolutely and necessarily inert -- <em>a
 mere abstraction</em> -- it is unnecessary to weave too fine a
 cobweb of subtleties as to the order of succession of
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 * According to Dr. A. Wilder's learned definition, Genesis, [[<em>genesis</em>]],
 is not generation, but "<em>a coming out of the eternal </em>into
 the Kosmos and Time": "a coming from <em>esse </em>into
 <em>exsistere,</em>"<em> </em>or "from <strong>B</strong>E-NESS
 into 'being' " -- as a Theosophist would say.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 25 MAN, THE THIRD LOGOS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the Cosmic Ultimates. Force <em>succeeds </em>Mulaprakriti; but,
 <em>minus </em>Force, Mulaprakriti is for all practical intents
 and purposes non-existent.*
 </p><p>
 The "Heavenly Man" (Tetragrammaton) who is the Protogonos,
 Tikkoun, the firstborn from the passive deity and the first manifestation
 of that deity's shadow, is the universal form and idea, which
 engenders the manifested Logos, Adam Kadmon, or the four-lettered
 symbol, in the Kabala, of the <em>Universe itself, </em>also called
 the <em>second Logos</em>. The<em> </em>second springs from the
 first and develops the third triangle (see the Sephirothal Tree);
 from the last of which (the lower host of Angels) MEN are generated.
 It is with this third aspect that we shall deal at present.
 </p><p>
 The reader must bear in mind that there is a great difference
 between the <strong>L</strong>OGOS and the <em>Demiurgos, </em>for
 one is <em>Spirit </em>and the other is <em>Soul; </em>or as Dr.
 Wilder has it: "<em>Dianoia</em> and<em> Logos </em>are synonymous,
 <em>Nous </em>being superior and closely in affinity with [[<em>T</em>o<em>
 agathon</em>]], one being the superior apprehending, the other
 the comprehending -- one noetic and the other phrenic."
 </p><p>
 Moreover, Man was regarded in several systems as the <em>third
 Logos. </em>The esoteric meaning of the word <em>Logos </em>(speech
 or word, <em>Verbum</em>)<em> </em>is the rendering in objective
 expression, as in a photograph, of the concealed thought. The
 <em>Logos </em>is the mirror reflecting DIVINE MIND, and the Universe
 is the mirror of the Logos, though the latter is the <em>esse
 </em>of that Universe. As the <em>Logos</em> reflects <em>all</em>
 in the Universe of Pleroma, so man reflects in himself all that
 he sees and finds in <em>his </em>Universe, the Earth. It is the
 three Heads of the Kabala: "<em>Unum intra alterum, et alterum
 super alterum</em>" (<em>Zohar, Idra Suta, </em>sec. <strong>VII</strong>).
 "Every Universe (world or planet) has its own Logos,"
 says the doctrine. The Sun was always called by the Egyptians
 "the eye of Osiris," and was himself the <em>Logos,
 </em>the first-begotten, or light made manifest to the world,
 "which is the Mind and divine intellect of the Concealed."
 It is only by the sevenfold Ray of this light that we can become
 cognizant of the Logos through the Demi-urge, regarding the latter
 as the <em>creator </em>of our planet and everything pertaining
 to it, and the former as the guiding Force of that "Creator"
 -- good and bad at the same time, the origin of good and the origin
 of evil. This "Creator" is neither good nor bad <em>per
 se, </em>but its differentiated aspects in nature make it assume
 one or the other character. With the invisible and the unknown
 Universes disseminated through space, none of the sun-gods had
 anything to do. The idea is expressed very clearly in the "Books
 of Hermes," and in every ancient folk lore. It is symbolised
 generally by the Dragon and the Serpent -- the Dragon of Good
 and the Serpent of Evil, represented on Earth by

 the right and the left-hand Magic. In the epic poem of Finland,
 the Kalewala,* the origin of the Serpent of Evil is given: it
 is born from the "spittle of Suoyatar . . . . and endowed
 with a living Soul by the Principle of Evil," Hisi. A strife
 is described between the two, the "thing of Evil" (the
 Serpent or Sorcerer), and Ahti, the Dragon; "Magic Lemminkainen."
 The latter is one of the seven sons of Ilmatar, the virgin "daughter
 of the air," she "who fell from heaven into the sea,"
 before Creation, <em>i.e</em>., Spirit transformed into the matter
 of sensuous life. There is a world of meaning and Occult thought
 in these few lines, admirably rendered by Dr. J. M. Crawford,
 of Cincinnati. The hero Lemminkainen, the good magician,
 </p><blockquote>
 "Hews the wall with might of magic,<br>
 Breaks the palisade in pieces,<br>
 Hews to atoms <em>seven</em> pickets,<br>
 Chops the <em>Serpent wall</em> to fragments.

 are called the twelve <em>Tien-Hoang, </em>the twelve hierarchies
 of Dhyanis or Angels, with human Faces, and Dragon bodies; the

 create men by incarnating themselves in

 ** It has been repeatedly stated that the Serpent is the symbol
 of wisdom and of Occult knowledge. "The Serpent has been
 connected with the god of wisdom from the earliest times of which
 we have any historical notice," writes Staniland Wake. "This
 animal was the especial symbol of Thot or Taut . . . and of all
 those <em>gods, </em>such as Hermes (?) and Seth who can be connected
 with him. This is also the primitive Chaldean triad Hea or Hoa."
 According to Sir Henry Rawlinson, the most important titles of
 this deity refer to "his functions as the source of all knowledge
 and science." Not only is he "the intelligent fish,"
 but his name may be read as signifying both "life" and
 a serpent (an initiated adept), and he may be considered as "figured
 by the great serpent which occupies so conspicuous a place among
 the symbols of the gods on the black stones recording Babylonian
 benefactions." Esculapius, Serapis, Pluto, Knoum and Kneph,
 are all deities with the attributes of the serpent. Says Dupuis,
 "They are all<em> healers, </em>givers of health, spiritual
 and physical, and of <em>enlightenment.</em>"<em> </em>The
 crown formed of an asp, the <em>Thermuthis, </em>belongs to Isis,
 goddess of Life and Healing. The Upanishads have a treatise on
 the <em>Science of Serpents</em> -- in other words, the Science
 of Occult knowledge; and the <em>Nagas </em>of the exoteric Buddhist
 are not "the fabulous <em>creatures </em>of the nature of
 serpents . . . beings superior to men and the protectors of the

 <p>
 seven figures of clay -- earth and water -- made in the shape
 of those <em>Tien-hoang,</em>a third allegory; (compare the "<em>Symbols
 of the Bonzes</em>")<em>. </em>The twelve <strong>AE</strong>SERS
 of the Scandinavian Eddas do the same. In the Secret Catechism
 of the Druses of Syria -- a legend which is repeated word for
 word by the oldest tribes about and around the Euphrates -- men
 were created by the "Sons of God" descending on Earth,
 where, after culling seven <em>Mandragoras, </em>they animated
 these roots, which became forthwith men.*
 </p><p>
 All these allegories point to one and the same origin -- to the
 dual and the triple nature of man; dual, as male and female; triple
 -- as being of spiritual and psychic essence <em>within, </em>and
 of a material fabric without.

 as Schlagintweit believes, but real living men, some superior
 to men by virtue of their Occult knowledge, and the <em>protectors

 his metaphysical tenets correctly, </em>others inferior morally
 as being <em>black</em> magicians. Therefore it is truly declared
 that Gautama Buddha "is said to have taught them a more philosophical

 to understand it at the time of his appearance." (Schlagintweit's
 "<em>Tibetan Buddhism.</em>")
 </p><p>
 * The Mandragora is the <em>mandrake</em> of the Bible, of Rachel
 and Leah. They are the roots of a plant, fleshy, hairy, and forked
 below, representing roughly the limbs of a man, the body and even
 a head. Its magical and mysterious properties have been proclaimed
 in fable and play from the most archaic ages. From Rachel and
 Leah, who indulged in witchcraft with them, down to Shakespeare,
 who speaks of <em>shrieking </em>--
 </p><blockquote>
 . . . . "Like mandrakes torn out of the earth<br>
 That living mortals, hearing them, run mad"
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 -- the mandragora was the magic plant <em>par excellence.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 These roots, without any stalk, and with large leaves growing
 out of the head of the root, like a gigantic crop of hair, present
 little similitude to man when found in Spain, Italy, Asia Minor,
 or Syria. But on the Isle of Candia, and in Karamania near the
 city of Adan, they have a wonderfully human form; being very highly
 prized as amulets. They are also worn by women as a charm against
 sterility, and for other purposes. They are especially effective
 in <em>Black Magic.</em></p><hr>

 light and heat from the Sun than Earth, or even the beautiful
 Venus, which receives but twice that amount more than our insignificant
 Globe." Whether the fact was known in antiquity may be inferred
 from the prayer of the "Earth Spirit" to the Sun as
 given in the text.* The Sun however, refuses to people the globe,
 as it is not ready to receive life as yet.
 </p><p>
 Mercury is, as an astrological planet, still more occult and mysterious
 than Venus. It is identical with the Mazdean Mithra, the genius,
 or god, "established between the Sun and the Moon, the perpetual
 companion of 'Sun' of Wisdom." Pausanias shows him as having
 an altar in common with Jupiter (Book V). He had wings to express
 his attendance upon the Sun in its course; and he was called the
 <em>Nuntis, </em>or Sun-wolf, "<em>solaris luminis particeps.</em>"
 He was the leader of and the evocator of Souls, the "great
 Magician" and the Hierophant. Virgil depicts him as taking
 "his wand to evoke from Orcus the souls plunged therein"
 -- <em>tum virgam capit, hac animas ille evocat Orco. </em>(See
 also the 21st Fargard of the <em>Vendidad </em>on the celestial
 militia.) He is the golden-coloured Mercury, the [[<em>chrusophaes</em>
 <em>Hermes</em>]] whom the Hierophants forbade to name. He is
 symbolised in Grecian mythology by one of the <em>dogs </em>(vigilance),
 which watch over the celestial flock (occult wisdom), or Hermes
 Anubis, or again Agathodaemon. He is the Argus watching over the
 Earth, and which the latter mistakes for the Sun itself. It is
 through the intercession of Mercury that the Emperor Julian prayed
 to the Occult Sun every night; for, as says Vossius: "All
 the theologians agree to say that <em>Mercury and the Sun are
 one</em>. . . . He was the most eloquent and the most wise of
 all the gods, which is not to be wondered at, since <em>Mercury
 is in such close proximity to the Wisdom and the Word of God </em>(the
 Sun) that he was confused with both." (<em>Idolatry,</em>
 Vol. II., p. 373.) Vossius utters here a greater occult truth
 than he suspected. The <em>Hermes-Sarameyas </em>of the Greeks
 is closely related to the Hindu <em>Saram and Sarameya, the </em>divine
 watchman, "who watches over the golden flock of stars and
 solar rays."

 * Copernicus wrote his theories on the "Revolution of the
 Heavenly Bodies" in the <strong>XVI</strong>th century, and
 the Zohar, even if compiled by Moses de Leon in the <strong>XIII</strong>th
 century, states that: "In the book of Hammannunah, the Old,
 we learn . . . that the earth turns upon itself in the form of
 a circle; that some are on top, the others below, . . . . that
 there are some countries which are lightened, whilst others are
 in darkness; these have the day, when for the former it is night;
 and there are countries in which it is constantly day, or in which
 at least the night continues only some instants." (<em>Zohar

 <em>gets all its vital forces, life, and powers through the medium
 of the seven planetary Dhyanis from the Spirit of the Sun. They
 are his messengers of Light and Life.</em>"
 </p><p>
 "<em>Like each of the seven regions of the Earth, each of
 the seven* Firstborn </em>(the primordial human groups) <em>receives
 its light and life from its own especial Dhyani -- spiritually,
 and from the palace </em>(house, the planet)<em> of that Dhyani
 physically; so with the seven great Races to be born on it. The
 first is born under the Sun; the second under Brihaspati </em>(Jupiter);
 <em>the third under Lohitanga </em>(the "fiery-bodied,"
 Venus, or Sukra); <em>the fourth, under Soma </em>(the Moon, our
 Globe also, the Fourth Sphere being born under and from the Moon)
 <em>and Sani, Saturn** the Krura-lochana </em>(evil-eyed) <em>and
 the Asita </em>(the dark); <em>the fifth, under Budha </em>(Mercury)."
 </p><p>
 "<em>So also with man and every </em>'<em>man</em>'<em> in
 man </em>(every principle).<em> Each gets its specific quality
 from its primary </em>(the planetary spirit), <em>therefore every
 man is a septenate </em>(or a combination of principles, each
 having its origin in a quality of that special Dhyani). <em>Every
 active power or force of the earth comes to her from one of the
 seven Lords. Light comes through Sukra </em>(Venus)<em>, who receives
 a triple supply, and gives one-third of it to the Earth. Therefore
 the two are called</em> '<em>Twin-sisters,</em>'<em> but the Spirit
 of the Earth is subservient to the </em>'<em>Lord</em>'<em> of
 Sukra. Our wise men represent the two Globes, one over, the other
 under the double Sign </em>(the primeval Svastica bereft of its
 four arms, or the cross <img src="sd1-5b.jpg" align="BOTTOM">)."***
 </p><p>
 The "double sign" is, as every student of Occultism
 knows, the symbol of the male and the female principles in Nature,
 of the positive and the negative, for the Svastica or <img src="sd2-29a.gif" align="BOTTOM">

 kings of the Divine Dynasty -- and

 * Science teaches that Venus receives from the sun twice as much
 light and heat as the earth. Thus the planet, precursor of the
 dawn and the twilight, the most radiant of all the planets, said
 to give the earth one-third of the supply she receives, has two
 parts left for herself. This has an occult as well as an astronomical
 meaning.
 </p><p>
 ** "As it is above so it is below" is the fundamental
 axiom of occult philosophy. As the logos is seven-fold, <em>i.e</em>.,
 throughout Kosmos it appears as seven logoi under seven different
 forms, or, as taught by learned Brahmins, "each of these
 is the central figure of one of the seven main branches of the
 ancient wisdom religion;" and, as the seven principles which
 correspond to the seven distinct states of <em>Pragna</em>, or
 consciousness, are allied to seven states of matter and the seven
 forms of force, the division must be the same in all that concerns
 the earth.

 also of Astrology, represented Venus in its astronomical tables
 as a <em>Globe poised over a Cross, </em>and the Earth, as a <em>Globe
 under a Cross</em>. The esoteric meaning of this is: "Earth
 fallen into generation, or into the production of its species
 through sexual union." But the later Western nations did
 not fail to give quite a different interpretation. They explained
 this sign through their mystics -- guided by the light of the
 Latin Church -- as meaning that our Earth and all on it were redeemed<em>
 by the Cross, </em>while Venus (otherwise <em>Lucifer </em>or
 Satan) was trampling upon it. Venus is the most occult, powerful,
 and mysterious of all the planets; the one whose influence upon,
 and relation to the Earth is most prominent. In exoteric Brahmanism,
 Venus or <em>Sukra -- </em>a male deity* -- is the son of Bhrigu,
 one of the Prajapati and a Vedic sage, and is Daitya-Guru, or
 the priest-instructor of the primeval giants. The whole history
 of "Sukra" in the Puranas, refers to the Third and to
 the Fourth Races.
 </p><p>
 "<em>It is through Sukra that the </em>'<em>double ones</em>'<em>
 </em>(<em>the Hermaphrodites</em>)<em> of the Third </em>(Root-Race)<em>
 descended from the first </em>'<em>Sweat-born,</em>'"<em>
 says the Commentary. Therefore it is represented under the symbol
 of <img src="sd1-4c.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> (the circle and diameter)
 during the Third </em>(<em>Race</em>)<em> and of</em> <img src="sd1-5c.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 <em>during the Fourth.</em> 
 </p><p>
 This needs explanation. The <em>diameter, </em>when found isolated
 in a circle, stands for female nature, for the first <em>ideal
 </em>World,<em> self-generated and self-impregnated </em>by the
 universally diffused Spirit of Life -- referring thus to the primitive
 Root-Race also. It becomes androgynous as the Races and all on
 Earth develop into their physical forms, and the symbol is transformed
 into a circle with a diameter from which runs a vertical line:
 expressive of male and female, not separated as yet -- the first
 and earliest Egyptian <em>Tau</em> <img src="sd1-5e.jpg" align="BOTTOM">;
 after which it becomes <img src="sd1-5b.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> or
 male-female separated** (See first pp. of Book I) and fallen into
 generation. Venus (the planet) is symbolised by the sign of a
 globe over the cross, which shows it as presiding over the natural

 by the ansated cross, or <img src="sd1-5g.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,
 which is only another form of Venus (Isis) <img src="sd1-5h.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,

 stepped out of the divine spiritual circle and fallen into physical
 male and female generation. This sign, from the end of the Third
 Race, has the same phallic significance as the "<em>tree</em>

 of life" in Eden <em>Anouki, </em>a form of Isis, is the
 goddess of life; and <em>Ank </em>was taken by the Hebrews from
 the Egyptians and introduced by Moses, one learned in the Wisdom
 of the priests of Egypt, with many other mystical words. The word
 <em>Ank </em>in Hebrew, with the personal suffix, means "my
 life," my being, which "is the personal pronoun Anochi,"
 from the name of the Egyptian goddess <em>Anouki.*</em> 
 </p><p>
 In one of the most ancient Catechisms of Southern India, Madras
 Presidency, the hermaphrodite goddess Adanari (see also "<em>Indian
 Pantheon</em>")<em> </em>has the ansated cross, the Svastica,
 the "male and female sign," right in the central part,
 to denote the pre-sexual state of the Third Race. Vishnu, who
 is now represented with a lotus growing out of his navel -- or
 the Universe of Brahma evolving out of the central point <em>Nara
 -- </em>is shown in one of the oldest carvings as double-sexed
 (Vishnu and Lakshmi) standing on a lotus-leaf floating on the
 water; which water rises in a semicircle and pours through the
 Svastica, "the source of generation" or of the descent
 of man.

 Pythagoras calls Sukra-Venus the <em>Sol alter, </em>"the
 other Sun." Of the "seven palaces of the Sun,"
 that of Lucifer Venus is the <em>third </em>one in Christian and
 Jewish Kabala, the Zohar making of it the abode of <em>Samael.
 </em>According to the Occult Doctrine, this planet is our Earth's
 <em>primary, </em>and its spiritual prototype. Hence, Sukra's
 car (Venus-Lucifer's) is said to be drawn by an <em>ogdoad of
 </em>"<em>earth-born horses,</em>" while the steeds
 of the chariots of the other planets are different.
 </p><p>
 "<em>Every sin committed on Earth is felt by Usanas-Sukra.
 The Guru of the Daityas is the Guardian Spirit of the Earth and
 Men. Every change on Sukra is felt on, and reflected by, the Earth.</em>"
 </p><p>
 Sukra, or Venus, is thus represented as the preceptor of the Daityas,
 the giants of the Fourth Race, who, in the Hindu allegory, obtained
 at one time the sovereignty of all the Earth, and defeated the
 minor gods. The <em>Titans </em>of the Western allegory are as
 closely connected with Venus-Lucifer, identified by later Christians
 with Satan. Therefore, as Venus, equally with Isis, was represented
 with Cow's horns on her head, the symbol of mystic Nature, and
 one that is convertible with, and significant of, the moon, since
 all these were lunar goddesses, the configuration of this planet
 is now placed by theologians between the horns of the mystic Lucifer.**
 It is owing to the fanciful interpretation of the

 * The ansated Cross is the astronomical planetary sign of Venus,
 "signifying the existence of <em>parturient energy </em>in
 the sexual sense, and this was one of the attributes of Isis,
 the <em>Mother, </em>of Eve, <em>Hauvah, </em>or Mother-Earth,
 and was so recognised among all the ancient peoples in one or
 another mode of expression." (From a modern Kabalistic <strong>MS</strong>.)
 </p><p>
 ** Athenaeus shows that the first letter of Satan's name was represented
 in days of old by an arc and crescent; and some Roman Catholics,
 good and kind men, would persuade the public that it is in honour
 of Lucifer's crescent-like horns that Mussulmen [[Footnote continued

 <p>
 archaic tradition, which states that Venus changes simultaneously
 (geologically) with the Earth; that whatever takes place on the
 one takes place on the other; and that many and great were their
 common changes -- it is for these reasons that St. Augustine repeats
 it, applying the several changes of configuration, colour, and
 even of the orbital paths, to that theologically-woven character
 of Venus-Lucifer. He even goes so far in his pious fancy as to
 connect the last changes of the planet with the Noachian and mythical
 Deluge alleged to have taken place 1796 years B.C. (See "<em>City
 of God</em>" lxxi., ch. viii.).
 </p><p>
 As Venus has no satellites, it is stated allegorically, that "Asphujit"
 (this "planet") adopted the Earth, the progeny of the
 Moon, "who overgrew its parent and gave much trouble,"
 a reference to the occult connection between the two. The Regent
 (of the planet) Sukra* loved his adopted child so well that he
 incarnated as Usanas and gave it perfect laws, which were disregarded
 and rejected in later ages. Another allegory, in Harivansa, is
 that Sukra went to Siva asking him to protect his pupils, the
 Daityas and Asuras, from the fighting gods; and that to further
 his object he performed a Yoga rite "imbibing the <em>smoke
 </em>of chaff with his <em>head downwards</em> for 1,000 years."
 This refers to the great inclination of the axis of Venus (amounting
 to 50 degrees), and to its being enveloped in eternal clouds.
 But it relates only to the physical constitution of the planet.

 for their national arms. Venus has always been identified, since
 the establishment of Roman Catholic dogmatism, with Satan and
 Lucifer, or the great Dragon, contrary to all reason and logic.
 As shown by the symbologists and astronomers, the association
 between the serpent and the idea of darkness had an astronomical
 foundation. The position which the constellation of Draco at one
 time occupied showed that the great serpent was the ruler of the
 night. This constellation was formerly at the very centre of the
 heavens, and is so extensive that it was called the Great Dragon.
 Its body spreads over seven signs of the Zodiac; and Dupuis, "who,"
 says Staniland Wake, "sees in the Dragon of the Apocalypse
 a reference to the celestial serpent," remarks that "it
 is not astonishing that a constellation so extended should be
 represented by the author of that book as a Great Dragon with
 seven heads, who drew the third part of the stars from heaven
 and cast them to Earth"; (Dupuis, tome <strong>III</strong>.,
 p. 255). Only Dupuis never knew <em>why </em>Draco, once the <em>pole-star
 </em>-- the symbol of "Guide," Guru and director --
 had been thus degraded by posterity. "The gods of our fathers
 are our devils," says an Asiatic proverb. When Draco ceased
 to be the <em>lode-star, </em>the guiding sidereal divinity, it
 shared the fate of all the fallen gods. Seth and Typhon was at
 one time, Bunsen tells us, "a great god universally adored
 throughout Egypt, who conferred on the sovereigns of the 18th
 and 19th Dynasties the symbols of life and power. But subsequently,
 in the course of the 20th Dynasty, he is suddenly treated as an
 evil Demon, insomuch that his effigies and name are obliterated
 on all the monuments and inscriptions that could be reached."
 The real occult reason will be given in these pages.

 that Occult mysticism has to deal. The allegory which states that
 for killing Sukra's mother, Vishnu was cursed by him to be <em>reborn
 seven times </em>on the Earth, is full of occult philosophical
 meaning. It does not refer to Vishnu's Avatars, since these number
 nine, the tenth being still to come, but to the Races on Earth.
 Venus, or Lucifer (also Sukra and Usanas) the planet, is the light-bearer
 of our Earth, in both its physical and mystic sense. The Christians
 knew it well in early times, since one of the earliest popes of
 Rome is known by his Pontiff name as Lucifer.

 "<em>Every world has its parent star and sister planet. Thus
 Earth is the adopted child and younger brother of Venus, but its
 inhabitants are of their own kind</em>. . . . <em>All sentient
 complete beings </em>(full septenary men or higher beings) <em>are
 furnished, in their beginnings, with forms and organisms in full
 harmony with the nature and state of the sphere they inhabit.</em>"<em>*</em>
 
 </p><p>
 "<em>The Spheres of Being, or centres of life, which are
 isolated nuclei breeding their men and their animals, are numberless;
 not one has any resemblance to its sister-companion or to any
 other in its own special progeny.</em>"<em>**</em> 
 </p><p>
 "<em>All have a double physical and spiritual nature.</em>"
 </p><p>
 "<em>The nucleoles are eternal and everlasting; the nuclei
 periodical and finite. The nucleoles form part of the absolute.
 They are the embrasures of that black impenetrable fortress, which
 is for ever concealed from human or even Dhyanic sight. The nuclei
 are the light of eternity escaping therefrom.</em>"

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 35 THE "SEVEN" MYSTERY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "Seven seems to have been the sacred number <em>par excellence
 </em>among all civilised nations of antiquity. Why? Each separate
 people has given a different explanation, according to the peculiar
 tenets of their (<em>exoteric</em>)<em> </em>religion. That it
 was the <em>number of numbers for those initiated into the sacred
 mysteries, there can be no doubt. </em>Pythagoras . . . calls
 it the 'Vehicle of Life' containing body and soul, since it is
 formed of a Quaternary, that is Wisdom and intellect, and of a
 <em>Trinity</em> or <em>action and matter. </em>The Emperor Julian,
 '<em>In matrem, etc.,' </em>expresses himself thus: 'Were I to
 touch upon the initiation into our Sacred Mysteries, which the
 Chaldees Bacchized, respecting the <em>seven-rayed </em>god, lighting
 up the soul through him, I should say things unknown to the rabble,
 very unknown, but well known to the blessed Theurgists.' "
 (p. 141).
 </p><p>
 And who, acquainted with the Puranas, the Book of the Dead, the
 Zendavesta, the Assyrian tiles, and finally the Bible, and who
 has observed the constant occurrence of the number seven, in these
 records of people living from the remotest times unconnected and
 so far apart, can regard as a coincidence the following fact,
 given by the same explorer of ancient Mysteries? Speaking of the
 prevalence of seven as a mystic number, among the inhabitants
 of the "Western continent" (of America), he adds that
 it is not less remarkable. For: --
 </p><p>
 "It frequently occurs in the <em>Popul-vuh </em>. . . we
 find it besides in the <em>seven families </em>said by Sahagun
 and Clavigero to have accompanied the mystical personage named
 <em>Votan, </em>the reputed founder of the great city of Nachan,
 identified by some with Palenque. In the <em>seven caves* </em>from
 which the ancestors of the Nahuatl are reported to have emerged.
 In the <em>seven cities </em>of Cibola, described by Coronado
 and Niza. . . . In the <em>seven Antilles; </em>in the <em>seven
 heroes </em>who, we are told, escaped the Deluge . . . ."
 </p><p>
 "Heroes," moreover, whose number is found the same in
 every "Deluge" story -- from the seven Rishis who were
 saved with Vaivasvata Manu, down to Noah's ark, into which beasts,
 fowls, and living creatures were taken by "Sevens."
 Thus we see the figures 1, 3, 5, 7, as perfect, because thoroughly
 mystic, numbers playing a prominent part in every Cosmogony and
 evolution of living Beings. In China, 1, <em>3, 5, 7,</em> are
 called "celestial numbers" in the canonical "<em>Book
 of Changes.</em>" (<em>Yi King</em>, or <em>transformation,
 </em>as in "Evolution").

 to seek to prove that the esoteric learning of the Aryans and

 Symbols: all these are based upon and start from the figures given
 from the Archaic Manuscript in the proem of Book I. <img src="sd1-5c.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,
 the symbol of evolution and fall into generation or matter, is
 reflected in the old Mexican sculptures or paintings, as it is
 in the Kabalistic Sephiroth, and the Egyptian <em>Tau.</em> Examine
 the Mexican <strong>MSS</strong> (<em>Add. MSS. </em>Brit. Mus.
 9789)*; you will find in it a tree whose trunk is covered with
 <em>ten</em> fruits ready to be plucked by a male and female,
 one on each side of it, while from the top of the trunk two branches
 shoot horizontally to the right and left, thus forming a perfect
 <img src="sd1-5e.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> (tau), the ends of the two
 branches, moreover, each bearing a triple bunch, with a bird --
 the bird of immortality, Atman or the divine Spirit -- sitting
 between the two, and thus making the <em>seventh. </em>This represents
 the same idea as the Sephirothal Tree,<em>ten in all, </em>yet,
 when separated from its upper triad, leaving <em>Seven</em>. These
 are the celestial fruits, the ten or <img src="sd1-333.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 10, born out of the two invisible male and female seeds, making
 up the 12, or the Dodecahedron of the Universe. The mystic system
 contains the <img src="sd2-36c.gif" align="BOTTOM">, the central
 point; the 3 or <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="BOTTOM">; the five,
 <img src="sd1-434b.jpg" align="BOTTOM">, and the seven or <img src="sd2-36a.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 or again <img src="sd2-36b.gif" align="BOTTOM">; the triangle
 in the square and the synthesizing point in the interlaced double
 triangles. This for the world of the archetypes. The phenomenal
 world receives its culmination and the reflex of all in <strong>M</strong>AN.
 Therefore he is the mystic square -- in his metaphysical aspect
 -- the <em>Tetraktis; </em>and becomes the <em>Cube</em>on the
 creative plain. His symbol is the cube unfolded** and 6 becoming
 7, or the <img src="sd2-36d.gif" align="BOTTOM"> <em>three</em>
 crossways (the female) and <em>four </em>vertically; and this
 is man, the culmination of the deity on Earth, whose body is the
 cross of flesh, <em>on, through,</em>and<em> in</em> which he
 is ever crucifying and putting to death the divine Logos or his

 "The universe," says every Philosophy and Cosmogony,
 "hath a Ruler (Rulers collectively) set over it, which is
 called the <strong>W</strong>ORD (Logos); the fabricating Spirit
 is its Queen: which two are the <em>First Power </em>after the
 <strong>O</strong>NE."
 </p><p>
 These are the Spirit and Nature, which two form our illusory universe.
 The two inseparables remain in the <em>Universe of Ideas </em>so
 long as it lasts, and then merge back into Parabrahm, the One
 ever changeless. "The Spirit, whose essence is eternal, one
 and self-existent," emanates a pure ethereal LIGHT -- a dual
 light not perceptible to the elementary senses -- in the Puranas,

 <p>
 Jezirah, the Greek and Latin hymns, in the Book of Hermes, in
 the Chaldean Book of Numbers, in the esotericism of Lao-tse, everywhere.
 In the Kabala, which explains the secret meaning of Genesis, this
 light is the DUAL-MAN, or the Androgyne (rather the sexless) angels,
 whose generic name is <strong>A</strong>DAM <strong>K</strong>ADMON.
 It is they who complete man, whose ethereal form is emanated by
 other divine, but far lower beings, who solidify the body with
 clay, or the "dust of the ground" -- an allegory indeed,
 but as scientific as any Darwinian evolution and more <em>true</em>.
 </p><p>
 The author of the "<em>Source of Measures</em>" says
 that the foundation of the Kabala and all its mystic books is
 made to rest upon the <em>ten Sephiroth; </em>which is a fundamental
 truth.* He shows these ten Sephiroth or the ten numbers in the
 following diagram: --
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-37.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 wherein the circle is the <em>naught, </em>its vertical diameter
 line is the first or primal ONE (the <em>Word</em> or<em> Logos</em>)<em>,
 </em>from which springs the series of the other numbers up to
 9, the limit of the digits. The 10 is the first Divine Manifestation**
 containing "every possible power of exact expression of proportion."
 By this Kabalistic speculation we are taught that the Sephiroth
 "were the numbers or emanations of the Heavenly Light (figures
 20612 to 6561), they were the 10 'Words,' DBRIM, 41224, the light,
 of which they were the flux, was the Heavenly Man, the Adam KDM
 (the 144- 144); and the Light, by the New Testament or Covenant
 (or 41224) created God; just as, by the Old Testament God (Alhim,
 31415) creates light (20612 to 6561)."
 </p><p>
 Now there are three kinds of light in Occultism, as in the Kabala.
 (1) The Abstract and Absolute Light, which is Darkness; (2) The
 Light of the Manifested-Unmanifested, called by some the Logos;
 and (3) The latter light reflected in the Dhyan Chohans, the minor
 <em>logoi </em>(the Elohim, collectively), who, in their turn,
 shed it on the objective Universe. But in the Kabala -- re-edited
 and carefully adjusted to fit the Christian tenets by the Kabalists
 of the <strong>XIII</strong>. century -- the three lights are
 described as: -- (1) The clear and penetrating, that of Jehovah;
 (2) reflected light; and (3) light in the <em>abstract.</em>"
 This light abstractly taken (in a metaphysical or symbolical sense)
 is Alhim (Elohim God),

 <p>
 while the clear penetrating light is Jehovah. The light of Alhim
 belongs to the world in general, in its allness and general fulness,
 but the light of Jehovah is that pertaining to the chiefest production,
 man, whom this light penetrated and made." The author of
 the "<em>Source of Measures</em>"<em> </em>pertinently
 refers the reader to Inman's "<em>Ancient Faiths embodied
 in Ancient Names,</em>" vol. ii., p. 648. There, an engraving
 of "the <em>vesica piscis, </em>Mary and the female emblem,
 copied from a rosary of the blessed Virgin . . . . printed at
 Venice, 1542," and therefore, as Inman remarks, "with
 a license from the Inquisition, consequently orthodox," will
 show the reader what the Latin Church understood by this "<em>penetrating
 power of light and its effects </em>" How sadly disfigured
 -- applied as they were to the grossest anthropomorphic conceptions
 -- have become, under Christian interpretation, the noblest and
 grandest, as the most exalted, ideas of deity of the Eastern philosophy!
 </p><p>
 The Occultists call this light <em>Daiviprakriti </em>in the East,
 and light of <em>Christos </em>in the West. It is the light of
 the LOGOS, the direct reflection of the ever Unknowable on the
 plane of Universal manifestation. But here is the interpretation
 thereof given by the modern Christians from the Kabala. As declared
 by the author just cited: --
 </p><p>
 "To the fulness of the world in general with its chiefest
 content, man, the term Elohim-Jehovah applies. In extracts from
 the <em>Zohar, </em>the Rev. Dr. Cassell (a Kabalist), to prove
 that the Cabbalah sets forth the doctrine of the Trinity, among
 other things says: 'Jehovah is Elohim (Alhim) . . . by three steps
 God (Alhim), and Jehovah become the same, and though separated
 each and together, they are of the same one.'" Similarly,
 Vishnu becomes the Sun, the visible symbol of the impersonal deity.
 Vishnu is described as "striding through the seven regions
 of the Universe in <em>three steps.</em>"<em> </em>But with
 the Hindus this is an <em>exoteric </em>account, a surface tenet
 and an allegory, while the Kabalists give it out as the esoteric
 and final meaning. But to proceed: --
 </p><p>
 "Now light," explains the author, "as shown, is
 20612 to 6561, as the proper enunciation of the integral and numerical
 relation of diameter to circumference of a circle. God (Alhim,<em>
 i.e</em>., 3.1415 to one, a modified form of the above) is the
 reduction of this, so as to obtain a standard unit<em>one,</em>as
 the basis, in general, of all calculation and all mensuration.
 But, for the production of animal life, and for especial <em>time
 measure </em>or the lunar year, that influence which causes conception
 and embryotic development, the numbers of the Jehovah measure
 ('<em>man even Jehovah</em>' measure), viz. 113 to 355, have to
 be specialised.* But this last ratio is but a modified form of
 light or 20612 to 6561, as a '[[<em>pi</em>]]' <em>value, </em>being
 only a variation of the same (that is 20612 to 6561 is 31415 to
 one, or Alhim or God) -- and in such a manner that one can be
 made

 <p>
 to flow into and be derived from the other, and these are the
 three steps by which the <em>Unity </em>and sameness can be shown
 of the divine names. That is, the two are but variations of the
 same ratio, viz., that of '[[pi]].' The object of this comment
 is to show the same measuring use for the Cabbalah as was employed
 in the three Covenants of the Bible, and in the symbols of Masonry,
 as just noticed."

 "First then, the Sephiroth are described as <em>Light, </em>that
 is, they themselves are a function of, indeed, the same as, the
 manifestation of Ain Soph; and they are so from the fact that
 <em>Light </em>represents the ratio of 20612 to 6561, as part
 of the 'Words,' DBRIM, 41224, or as to the Word, Debar, 206 (=
 10 cubits). <em>Light </em>is so much the burden of the Kabbalah,
 in explaining the Sephiroth, that the most famous book on the
 Kabbalah is called <em>Zohar</em> or <em>Light. </em>In this we
 find expressions of this kind: -- 'The Infinite was entirely unknown
 and diffused no light before the luminous point violently broke
 through into vision . . . .' 'When he first assumed the form (of
 the Crown, or the first Sephira), he caused 9 splendid lights
 to emanate from it, which, shining through it, diffused a bright
 light in all directions': that is, these 9 with his one (which
 was the origin, as above, of the nine), together made the 10,
 that is <img src="sd1-5f.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> or <img src="sd2-39.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 or <em>the sacred Ten</em> (<em>numbers or Sephiroth</em>)<em>,
 </em>or<em> Jod -</em>- and these numbers were '<em>the Light.</em>'
 Just as in the Gospel of St. John, God (Alhim, 31415 to one) was
 that light (20612 to 6561) by which (Light) all things were made."
 </p><p>
 In <em>Sepher Jezirah, </em>or Numbers of Creation, the whole
 process of evolution is given out in Numbers. In its "32
 paths of Wisdom" the number 3 is repeated four times, and
 the number 4 five times. Therefore, the Wisdom of God is contained
 in numbers (Sephrim or Sephiroth), for Sepher (or S-ph-ra when
 unvowelled) means "to cipher." And therefore, also,
 we find Plato stating that the deity <em>geometrizes </em>in fabricating
 the Universe.
 </p><p>
 The Kabalistic book, the Sepher Jezirah, opens with a statement
 of the hidden wisdom of <em>Alhi </em>in<em> Sephrim, i.e , </em>the
 Elohim in the Sephiroth.
 </p><p>
 "In thirty and two paths, hidden wisdom, established Jah,
 JHVH, Tzabaoth, Elohi of Israel, Alhim of Life, El of Grace and
 Mercy -- exalted, uplifted Dweller on high, and King of Everlasting,
 and his name -- Holy! in three Sephrim: viz: -- B-S'ph-r, V-S'ph-r,
 V-Siph-o-r."
 </p><p>
 "This Comment sets forth 'the <em>Hidden Wisdom</em>' of
 the original text by hidden Wisdom, that is, by the use of words
 carrying a special set of Numbers and a special phraseology, which
 will set forth the very explanatory system which we find to fit
 so accurately in the Hebrew Bible. . . . . In setting forth his

 <em>Sephrim </em>(<em>Sephiroth</em>) of the Number Jezirah, the
 author explains the separation of this word in the three subordinate
 ones, a play upon a common word <em>s-ph-r, </em>or number."
 </p><p>
 The prince Al-Chazari says to the Rabbi*: -- "I wish now
 that thou wouldest impart to me some of the chiefest or leading
 principles of Natural Philosophy, which as thou sayest were in
 former times worked out by them (the Ancient Wise Ones)";
 to which the Rabbi makes answer: -- "To such principles appertains
 the Number of Creation of our Race-father Abraham" (that
 is Abram and Abraham, or numbers 41224 and 41252). He then says
 that this book of Number treats of teaching the <em>Alhim-ness
 </em>and<em> One-ness </em>through, "DBRIM," viz., the
 numbers of the Word "<em>Words.</em>"<em> </em>That
 is, it teaches the use of the ratio 31415 to one, through 41224,
 which last, in the description of the Ark of the Covenant, was
 divided into two parts by two tables of stone, on which these,
 DBRIM or 41224, were written or engraved -- or 20612 by 2. He
 then comments on these three subordinately used words, and takes
 care as to one of them to make the comment: -- "And <em>Alhim
 </em>(31415 to 1) said: Let there be Light (20612 to 6561)."
 </p><p>
 The three words as given in the text are: <img src="sd2-40a.gif" align="BOTTOM">.
 And the Rabbi in commenting upon them says: "It teaches the
 <em>Alhim-ness </em>(31415)<em> </em>and One-ness (the diameter
 to Alhim) through Words (<strong>DBRIM,</strong> 41224), by which
 on the one side there is infinite expression in heterogeneous
 creations, and on the other a final harmonic tendency to <em>One-ness</em>"
 (which as everyone knows is the mathematical function of "[[<em>pi</em>]]"
 of the schools, which measures, and weighs and numbers the stars
 of heaven, and yet resolves them back into the final Oneness of
 the Universe through Words). "Their final accord perfects
 itself in that Oneness that ordains them and which consists in
 <img src="sd2-40b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> (Book of Al-Chazari), that
 is the Rabbi, in his first comment, leaves the jod, or <em>i</em>,
 out of one of the words, whereas afterwards he restores it again.
 If we take the values of those subordinate words, we find them
 to be 340, 340, 346; together these are 1026, and the division
 of the general word into these has been to produce these numbers,
 which by Temurah may be changed in various ways for various purposes."

 The reader is asked to turn to Stanza <strong>IV</strong>. of
 Book I. and its fourth commentary to find that the 3, 4 -- (7),
 and the thrice seven, or 1065, the number of Jehovah, is the number
 of the 21 Prajapati mentioned in the Mahabharata, or the three
 <em>Sephrim </em>(words in cipher or figures). And this comparison
 between the Creative Powers of Archaic philosophy and the anthropomorphic
 Creator of <em>exoteric </em>Judaism (since their esotericism
 shows its identity with the Secret Doctrine) will lead the student
 to perceive and discover that, in truth, Jehovah is but a <em>lunar

 <p>
 "generation" god. (See Book I, Part 2<em>, </em>"<em>Deus
 Lunus.</em>") It is a fact well known to every conscientious
 student of the Kabala, that the deeper he dives into it, the more
 he feels convinced that unless the Kabala -- or what is left of
 it -- is read by the light of the Eastern esoteric philosophy,
 its study leads only to the discovery that, on the lines traced
 by exoteric Judaism and Christianity, the monotheism of both is
 nothing more exalted than ancient Astrolatry, now vindicated by
 modern Astronomy. The Kabalists never cease to repeat that <em>primal
 intelligence </em>can never be understood. It cannot be comprehended,
 nor can it be located, therefore it has to remain nameless and
 negative. Hence the Ain-Soph -- the "UNKNOWABLE" and
 the "UNNAMEABLE" -- which, as <em>it</em> could not
 be made manifest, was conceived to emanate manifesting Powers.
 It is then with its <em>emanations alone that human intellect
 has to, and can deal. </em>Christian theology, having rejected
 the doctrine of emanations and replaced them with direct, conscious
 creations of angels and the rest out of <em>nothing, </em>now
 finds itself hopelessly stranded between Supernaturalism, or miracle,
 and materialism. An <em>extra</em>-cosmic god is fatal to philosophy,
 an <em>intra</em>-cosmic Deity -- <em>i.e.</em> Spirit and matter
 inseparable from each other -- is a philosophical necessity. Separate
 them and that which is left is a gross superstition under a mask
 of emotionalism. But why "geometrize," as Plato has
 it, why represent these emanations under the form of an immense
 arithmetical table? The question is well answered by the author
 just cited. His remarks are quoted in Part II., § "<em>The
 Theogony of the Creative Gods.</em>"
 </p><p>
 "Mental perception," he says, "to become physical
 perception, must have the Cosmic principle of <em>light</em>:
 and by this, our mental circle must become visible through light;
 or, for its complete manifestation, the Circle must be that of
 physical visibility, or Light itself. Such conceptions, thus formulated,
 became the groundwork of the philosophy of the divine manifesting
 in the Universe."
 </p><p>
 This is philosophy. It is otherwise when we find the Rabbi in
 <em>Al-Chazari </em>saying that "under s'ph-r is to be understood
 <em>calculation </em>and <em>weighing </em>of created bodies.
 For the <em>calculation, </em>by means of which a body must be
 constructed in harmony or symmetry, by which it must be in construction
 rightly arranged and made to correspond to the object in design,
 consists at last in <em>number, extension, mass, weight; </em>co-ordinate
 relation of movements, then harmony of music, must consist altogether
 by number, that is (S'ph-r). . . By Sippor (s'phor) is to be understood
 the words of Alhim whereunto joins or adapts itself the design
 of the frame or form of construction; for example, it was said
 'Let Light be.' The <em>work became as the </em>WORDS <em>were
 spoken, </em>that is, as the numbers of the work came forth. .
 . . ."
 </p><p>
 This is <em>materialising the Spiritual </em>without scruple.
 But the Kabala</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 42 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 was not always so well adapted to anthropo-monotheistic conceptions.
 Compare this with any of the six schools of India. For instance,
 in Kapila's "Sankhya" Philosophy, unless, allegorically
 speaking, Purusha mounts on the shoulders of Prakriti, the latter
 remains irrational, while the former remains inactive without
 her. Therefore Nature (in man) must become a compound of Spirit
 and Matter before he becomes what he is; and the Spirit latent
 in Matter must be awakened to life and consciousness gradually.
 The Monad has to pass through its mineral, vegetable and animal
 forms, before the Light of the Logos is awakened in the animal
 man. Therefore, till then, the latter cannot be referred to as
 "MAN," but has to be regarded as a Monad imprisoned
 in ever changing forms. <em>Evolution, </em>not<em> creation,
 </em>by means of WORDS is recognized in the philosophies of the
 East, even in their exoteric records. <em>Ex oriente lux</em>.
 Even the name of the first man in the Mosaic Bible had its origin
 in India, Professor Max Muller's negation notwithstanding. The
 Jews got their Adam from Chaldea; and Adam-Adami is a compound
 word and therefore a manifold symbol, and proves the occult dogmas.
 </p><p>
 This is no place for philological disquisitions. But the reader
 may be reminded that the words <em>Ad</em> and<em> Adi</em> mean
 in Sanskrit "the first"; in Aramaean, "One"
 (<em>Ad-ad, </em>"the only one"); in Assyrian, "father"
 whence <em>Ak-Ad </em>or "father-creator."* And once
 the statement is found correct it becomes rather difficult to
 confine Adam to the Mosaic Bible alone, and to see therein simply
 a Jewish name. <em>Vide</em> Part II. of this Volume, § "Adam-Adami."
 </p><p>
 There is frequent confusion in the attributes and genealogies
 of the gods in their theogonies, as given to the world by the
 half-initiated writers, Brahmanical and Biblical, the Alpha and
 the Omega of the records of that symbolical science. Yet there
 could be no such confusion made by the earliest nations, the descendants
 and pupils of the divine instructors: for both the attributes
 and the genealogies were inseparably linked with cosmogonical
 symbols, the "gods" being the life and animating "soul-principle"
 of the various regions of the Universe. Nowhere and by no people
 was speculation allowed to range <em>beyond </em>those<em> manifested
 </em>gods. The boundless and infinite UNITY remained with every
 nation a virgin forbidden soil, untrodden by man's thought,
 </p><p>
 [[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </p><p>
 * The appellation <em>Ak-ad</em> (or Akkadians) is of the same
 class as <em>Ad-m, Ha-va </em>(Eve), <em>AEd-en</em> (Eden); Ak-Ad
 meaning "Son of <em>Ad</em>" (like the sons of Ad in
 Ancient Arabia). <em>Ad-ad, </em>the "Only One" and
 the First, was the <em>Ad-on </em>or "Lord" of Syria
 and consort of <em>Ad-ar-gat </em>or Aster't, the Syrian goddess.
 And Gan-AEden (Eden) or Gandunia was Babylonia and Mesopotamia.
 In Assyrian <em>Ak</em> meant Creator, the letter K pronounced
 Kh (Ah) gutturally. According to Swedenborg's mysticism Adam was
 not a man but a church (?) of primitive light. In the Vedas <em>Ad</em>-iti
 is the primitive light, the Akasa of the phenomenal world.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 43 ADAM-ADAMI.</h6>
 
 <p>
 untouched by fruitless speculation. The only reference made to
 it was the brief conception of its diastolic and systolic property,
 of its periodical expansion or dilatation, and contraction. In
 the Universe with all its incalculable myriads of systems and
 worlds disappearing and re-appearing in eternity, the anthropomorphised
 powers, or gods, their Souls, had to disappear from view with
 their bodies: -- "The breath returning to the eternal bosom
 which exhales and inhales them," says our Catechism.
 </p><p>
 "<em>Ideal nature,</em>" the abstract Space in which
 everything in the Universe is mysteriously and invisibly generated,
 is the same female side of procreative power in Nature in the
 Vedic as in every other Cosmogony. Aditi is Sephira, and the Sophia-Achamoth
 of the Gnostics, and Isis, the virgin Mother of Horus. In every
 Cosmogony, behind and higher than the <em>creative </em>deity,
 there is a superior deity, a planner, an Architect, <em>of whom
 </em>the Creator is but the executive agent. And still higher,
 <em>over</em> and<em> around, within</em> and<em> without, </em>there
 is the UNKNOWABLE and the <em>unknown, </em>the Source and Cause
 of all these Emanations. . . . .
 </p><p>
 It thus becomes easy to account for the reason why "<em>Adam-Adami</em>"<em>
 </em>is found in the Chaldean scripture, certainly earlier than
 the Mosaic Books. In Assyrian <em>Ad </em>is the father, and in
 Aramaean <em>Ad </em>is<em> </em>"One," and <em>Ad-ad
 </em>the "only one," while <em>Ak </em>is in Assyrian
 "creator." Thus <em>Ad-am-ak-ad-mon </em>became Adam
 Kadmon in the Kabala (<em>Zohar</em>)<em>, </em>meaning as it
 did, the "One (Son) of the divine Father, or the creator,"
 for the words "<em>am</em>" and "<em>om</em>"
 meant at one time in nearly every language the <em>divine, </em>or
 the <em>deity. </em>Thus Adam Kadmon and Adam-Adami came to mean:
 -- "The first emanation of the Father-Mother or divine nature,"
 and literally "the first divine one." And it is easy
 to see that <em>Ad</em>-Argat (or<em> Aster</em>'<em>t, </em>the
 Syrian goddess, the consort of <em>Ad-on, </em>the lord god of
 Syria or the Jewish Adonai), and Venus, Isis, Ishtar, Mylitta,
 Eve, etc., etc., are identical with the <em>Aditi </em>and Vach
 of the Hindus. They are all the "Mothers of all living"
 and "of the gods." On the other hand -- cosmically and
 astronomically -- all the male gods became at first "Sun-gods,"
 then, theologically, the "Suns of Righteousness" and
 the Logoi, all symbolised by the Sun.* They are all <em>Protogonoi
 </em>(the first-born) and
 </p><p>
 [[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </p><p>
 * Adam-Jehovah, Brahma and Mars are, in one sense, identical;
 they are all symbols for primitive or initial <em>generative powers
 </em>for the purposes of human procreation. Adam is red, and so
 also are Brahma-Viraj and Mars -- god and planet. Water is the
 blood of the Earth; therefore, all these names are connected with
 Earth and Water. "It takes <em>earth and water </em>to create
 a <em>human</em> soul," says Moses. Mars is identical with
 <em>Kartikeya </em>God of War (in one sense) -- which god is born
 of the Sweat of Siva, <em>Siva Gharmaja </em>and the Earth. In
 the Mahabharata he is shown as born without the intervention of
 a woman. And he is also called "Lohita," the <em>red</em>,
 like Adam, and the other "first men." Hence, the author
 of "<em>The Source of Measures</em>" is quite right
 in thinking that Mars (and all the other gods of like attributes),
 "being the <em>god of war </em>and of [[Footnote continued

 <em>Mikroprosopoi. </em>With the Jews Adam Kadmon was the same
 as Athamaz, Tamaz, or the Adonis of the Greeks -- "the One
 <em>with, </em>and<em> of </em>his father" -- the "Father"
 becoming during the later Races <em>Helios, </em>the Sun, as Apollo
 <em>Karneios,* </em>for instance, who was the "Sun born";
 Osiris, Ormazd, and so on, were all followed by, and found themselves
 transformed later on into still more earthly types: such as Prometheus,
 the crucified of Mount Kajbee, Hercules, and so many others, sun-gods
 and heroes, until all of them came to have no better significance
 than phallic symbols.
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Zohar</em> is <em>i</em>t said "Man was created
 by the Sephiroth (Elohim-Javeh, also) and they engendered by common
 power the <em>earthly </em>Adam." Therefore in <em>Genesis
 </em>the Elohim say: -- "Behold Man is become <em>as one
 of us.</em>" But in Hindu Cosmogony or "Creation,"
 Brahma-Prajapati <em>creates </em>Viraj and the Rishis, spiritually;
 therefore the latter are distinctly called "the Mind-born
 Sons of Brahma"; and this specified mode of <em>engendering
 </em>precluded every idea of <em>Phallicism, </em>at any rate
 in the earlier human nations. This instance well illustrates the
 respective <em>spirituality </em>of the two nations.

 metaphorically <em>immortal </em>through their Wisdom. Such is
 the common belief of those who credit every star or planet with
 being inhabited. (And there are men of science -- M. Flammarion
 among others -- who believe in this fervently, on logical as well
 as on astronomical data). The Moon being an inferior body to the
 Earth even, to say nothing of other planets, the terrestrial men
 produced by her sons -- the lunar men or "ancestors"
 -- from her shell or body, cannot be immortal. They cannot hope
 to become real, self-conscious and intelligent men, unless they
 are <em>finished, </em>so to say, by other creators. Thus in the
 Puranic legend, the son of the Moon (<em>Soma</em>)<em> </em>is<em>
 Budha </em>(Mercury), "the intelligent" and the Wise,
 because he is the offspring of Soma, the "regent" of
 the visible Moon, not of Indu, the physical Moon. Thus Mercury
 is the elder brother of the Earth, metaphorically -- his step-brother,
 so to say, the offspring of <em>Spirit </em>-- while she (the
 Earth) is the progeny of the <em>body. </em>These allegories have
 a deeper and more scientific meaning (astronomically and geologically)
 thA
 </p><p>
 n our modern physicists are willing to admit. The whole cycle
 of the "first War in Heaven," the Taraka-maya, is as
 full of philosophical as of Cosmogonical and astronomical truths.
 One can trace therein the biographies of all the planets by the
 history of their gods and rulers. Usanas (Sukra, or Venus), the
 bosom-friend of Soma and the foe of Brihaspati (Jupiter) the instructor
 of the gods, whose wife Tara (or Taraka) had been carried away
 by the Moon, <em>Soma -- </em>"of whom he begat Budha"
 -- took also an active part in this war against "the gods"
 and forthwith was degraded into a <em>demon </em>(Asura) deity,
 and so he remains to this day.*

 what are called in India the PITAR or <em>pitris, </em>the Fathers,
 the progenitors of men. This

 [[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </p><p>
 * Usanas-Sukra or Venus is our "Lucifer," the morning
 star, of course. The ingenuity of this allegory in its manifold
 meanings is great indeed. Thus <em>Brihaspati </em>(the planet
 Jupiter) or Brahmanaspati is, in the Rig Veda, a deity who is
 the symbol and the prototype of the <em>exoteric </em>or ritualistic
 worship. He is priest sacrificer, suppliant, and the medium through
 which the prayers of mortals reach the gods. He is the <em>Purohita
 </em>(family priest, or Court Chaplain) of the Hindu Olympus and
 the spiritual <em>Guru </em>of the Gods. Soma is the mystery god
 and presides over the mystic and occult nature in man and the
 Universe. Tara, the priest's wife, who symbolizes the worshipper,
 prefers esoteric truths to their mere shell, exotericism; hence
 she is shown as carried off by Soma. Now Soma is the sacred juice
 of that name, giving mystic visions and trance revelations, the
 <em>result of which union is Budha</em> (Wisdom), Mercury, Hermes,
 etc., etc.; that science in short which to this day is proclaimed
 by the Brihaspatis of Theology as devilish and <em>Satanic. </em>What
 wonder that by expanding the cycle of this allegory we find Christian
 theology espousing the quarrel of the Hindu gods, and regarding
 <em>Usanas</em> (Lucifer), who helped Soma against that ancient
 personification of ritualistic worship (Brahmanaspati, the lord
 of the Brahmans, now become "Jupiter-Jehovah") as <strong>S</strong>ATAN,
 the "enemy of God"!</p><hr>

 does not remove the seeming difficulty, in view of modern hypotheses,
 of the teaching, which shows these progenitors or ancestors creating
 the first human Adams out of their sides: as astral shadows. And
 though it is an improvement on Adam's rib, still geological and
 climatic difficulties will be brought forward. Such, however,
 is the teaching of Occultism.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) Man's organism was adapted in every race to its surroundings.
 The first Root-Race was as ethereal as ours is material. The progeny
 of the seven Creators, who evolved the seven primordial Adams,*
 surely required no purified gases to breathe and live upon (see
 Part <strong>III</strong>. of this Volume). Therefore, however
 strongly the impossibility of this teaching may be urged by the
 devotees of modern science, the Occultist maintains that the case
 was as stated <em>aeons of years </em>before even the evolution
 of the Lemurian, the first physical man, which itself took place
 18,000,000 years ago.**
 </p><p>
 Preliminary evolution is described in one of the <strong>B</strong>OOKS
 OF <strong>D</strong>ZYAN and the Commentaries thereon in this
 wise: --
 </p><p>
 Archaic Scripture teaches that at the commencement of every local
 Kalpa, or Round, the earth is reborn; "as the human <em>Jiva</em>
 (monad), when passing into a new womb, gets re-covered with a
 new body, so does the Jiva of the Earth; it gets a more perfect
 and solid covering with each Round after re-emerging once more
 from the matrix of space into objectivity" (Comment). This
 process is attended, of course, by the throes of the new birth
 or geological convulsions.

 Thus the only reference to it is contained in one verse of the
 volume of the <em>Book of Dzyan </em>before us, where it says:

 divine likeness, before he ate of the forbidden fruit. The former
 Adam is the Sephirothal Host; the second Adam is the Mindless
 first human Root-race; the third Adam is the race that separated,

 The Earth is said to cast off her old <em>three </em>skins, because
 this refers to the three preceding Rounds she has already passed
 through; the present being the <em>fourth </em>Round out of the
 seven. At the beginning of every new <strong>R</strong>OUND, after
 a period of "obscuration," the earth (as do also the
 other six "earths") casts off, or is supposed to cast
 off, her old skins as the Serpent does: therefore she is called
 in the <em>Aitareya-Brahmana </em>the<em> Sarpa Rajni, </em>"the
 Queen of the Serpents," and "the mother of all that
 moves." The "Seven Skins," in the first of which
 she now stands, refer to the seven geological changes which accompany
 and correspond to the evolution of the Seven Root-Races of Humanity.

 To the mind of the Eastern student of Occultism, two figures are
 indissolubly connected with mystic astronomy, chronology, and
 their cycles. Two grand and mysterious figures, towering like
 two giants in the Archaic Past, emerge before him, whenever he
 has to refer to Yugas and Kalpas. When, at what period of pre-history
 they lived, none save a few men in the world know, or ever can
 know with that certainty which is required by exact chronology.
 It may have been 100,000 years ago, it may have been 1,000,000,
 for all that the outside world will ever know. The mystic West
 and Freemasonry talk loudly of Enoch and Hermes. The mystic East
 speaks of <strong>N</strong>ARADA, the old Vedic Rishi, and of<strong>
 ASU</strong>RAMAYA, the Atlantean.
 </p><p>
 It has already been hinted that of all the incomprehensible characters
 in the Mahabharata and the Puranas, Narada, the son of Brahrna
 in Matsya Purana, the progeny of Kasyapa and the daughter of Daksha

 * Achyuta is an almost untranslatable term. It means that which
 is not subject to fall or change for the worse: the <em>Unfalling;
 </em>and it is the reverse of <em>chyuta, </em>"the Fallen."
 The Dhyanis who incarnate in the human forms of the <em>Third</em>
 Root-Race and endow them with intellect (Manas) are called the
 <em>chyuta, </em>for they fall into generation.</p><hr>

 in the Vishnu Purana, is the most mysterious. He is referred to
 by the honourable title of Deva Rishi (divine Rishi, more than
 a demi-god) by Parasara, and yet he is cursed by Daksha and even
 by Brahma. He informs Kansa that Bhagavat (or Vishnu in exotericism)
 would incarnate in the eighth child of Devaki, and thus brings
 the wrath of the Indian <em>Herod </em>upon Krishna's mother;
 and then, from the cloud on which he is seated -- invisible as
 a true <em>Manasaputra -- he </em>lauds Krishna, in delight at
 the Avatar's feat of killing the monster Kesim. Narada is here,
 there, and everywhere; and yet, none of the Puranas gives the
 true characteristics of this great enemy of physical procreation.
 Whatever those characteristics may be in Hindu Esotericism, Narada
 -- who is called in Cis-Himalayan Occultism <em>Pesh-Hun, </em>the
 "Messenger," or the Greek <em>Angelos -- </em>is the
 sole confidant and the executor of the universal decrees of Karma
 and <em>Adi-Budh: </em>a kind of active and ever incarnating logos,
 who leads and guides human affairs from the beginning to the end
 of the Kalpa.
 </p><p>
 "Pesh-Hun" is a general not a special Hindu possession.
 He is the mysterious guiding intelligent power, which gives the
 impulse to, and regulates the impetus of cycles, Kalpas and universal
 events.* He is Karma's visible adjuster on a general scale; the
 <em>inspirer </em>and the leader of the greatest heroes of this
 Manvantara. In the exoteric works he is referred to by some very
 uncomplimentary names; such as "Kali-Karaka," <em>strife-maker,
 </em>"Kapi-vaktra," <em>monkey-faced, </em>and even
 "Pisuna," the spy, though elsewhere he is called Deva-Brahma.
 Even Sir W. Jones was strongly impressed with this mysterious
 character from what he gathered in his Sanskrit Studies. He compares
 him to Hermes and Mercury, and calls him "the eloquent messenger
 of the gods" (see <em>Asiat. Res. </em>I. p. 264). All this
 led the late Dr. Kenealy ("<em>Book of God</em>")<em>,
 </em>on the ground that the Hindus believe him to be a great Rishi,
 "who is for ever wandering about the earth, giving good counsel,"
 to see in him one of his twelve <em>Messiahs. </em>He was, perhaps,
 not so far off the real track as some imagine.
 </p><p>
 What Narada <em>really is, </em>cannot be explained in print;
 nor would the modern generations of the profane gather much from
 the information. But it may be remarked, that if there is in the
 Hindu Pantheon a deity which resembles Jehovah, in, tempting by
 "suggestion" of thoughts and "hardening" of
 the hearts of those whom he would make his tools and victims,
 it is Narada. Only with the latter it is no desire to obtain a
 pretext for "plaguing," and thus showing that "<em>I
 am </em>the Lord God."
 </p><p>
 [[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </p><p>
 * This is perhaps the reason why, in the Bhagavad Gita, we are
 told that Brahma had communicated to Narada in the beginning that
 all men whatsoever, even <em>Mlechchhas, </em>outcasts and barbarians,
 might know the true nature of Vasudeva and learn to have faith
 in that deity.</p><hr>

 Nor is it through any ambitious or selfish motive; but, verily,
 to serve and guide universal progress and evolution.
 </p><p>
 Narada is one of the few prominent characters, save some gods,
 in the Puranas, who visits the so-called nether or infernal regions,
 Patala. Whether or not it was from his intercourse with the thousand-headed
 Sesha, the serpent who bears the seven Patalas and the entire
 world like a diadem upon his heads, and who is the great teacher
 of astronomy,* that Narada learned all that he knew, certain it
 is that he surpasses Garga's Guru in his knowledge of cyclic intricacies.
 It is he who has charge of our progress and national weal or woe.
 It is he who brings on wars and puts an end to them. In the old
 Stanzas Pesh-Hun is credited with having calculated and recorded
 all the astronomical and cosmic cycles to come, and with having
 taught the Science to the first gazers at the starry vault. And
 it is Asuramaya, who is said to have based all his astronomical
 works upon those records, to have determined the duration of all
 the past geological and cosmical periods, and the length of the
 all the cycles to come, till the end of this life-cycle, or the
 end of the seventh Race.
 </p><p>
 There is a work among the Secret Books, called the "Mirror
 of Futurity," wherein all the Kalpas within Kalpas and cycles
 within the bosom of Sesha, or infinite Time, are recorded. This
 work is ascribed to <em>Pesh-Hun </em>Narada. There is another
 old work which is attributed to various Atlanteans. It is these
 two Records which furnish us with the figures of our cycles, and
 the possibility of calculating the date of cycles to come. The
 chronological calculations which will presently be given are,
 however, those of the Brahmins as explained further on; but most
 of them are also those of the Secret Doctrine.
 </p><p>
 The chronology and computations of the Brahmin Initiates are based
 upon the Zodiacal records of India, and the works of the above-mentioned
 astronomer and magician -- Asuramaya. The Atlantean zodiacal records
 cannot err, as they were compiled under the guidance of those
 who first taught astronomy, among other things, to mankind.
 </p><p>
 But here again we are deliberately and recklessly facing a new
 difficulty. We shall be told that our statement is contradicted
 by <em>science, </em>in the person of a man regarded as a great
 authority (in the West) upon all subjects of Sanskrit literature
 -- Professor Albrecht Weber, of Berlin. This, to our great regret,
 cannot be helped; and we are ready to maintain what is now stated.
 Asuramaya, to whom the epic tradition points as the earliest astronomer
 in Aryavarta, one to whom "the

 * Sesha, who is also Ananta, the infinite, and the "Cycle
 of Eternity" in esotericism, is credited with having given
 his astronomical knowledge to Garga, the oldest astronomer of
 India, who propitiated him, and forthwith knew all about the planets
 and how to read omens.</p><hr>

 <p>
 Sun-god imparted the knowledge of the stars," <em>in propria
 persona, </em>as Dr. Weber himself states, is identified by him,
 in some very mysterious way, with the "Ptolemaios" of
 the Greeks. No more valid reason is given for this identification
 than that "this latter name (Ptolemaios), as we see from
 the inscription of Piyadasi, became the Indian 'Turamaya,' out
 of which the name 'Asuramaya' <em>might </em>very easily grow."
 No doubt it "<em>might,</em>"<em> </em>but the vital
 question is -- Are there any good proofs that it <em>has </em>thus<em>
 grown? </em>The only evidence that is given for it is, that it
 <em>must </em>be so: "since this Maya is distinctly assigned
 to Romaka-pura in the West."* The Maya is evident, since
 no Sanskritist among Europeans can tell where that locality of
 "Romaka-pura" was, except, indeed, that it was somewhere
 "in the West." Anyhow, as no member of the Asiatic Society,
 or Western Orientalist, will ever listen to a Brahmanical teaching,
 it is useless to take the objections of European Orientalists
 into consideration. "Romakapura" was in "the West,"
 certainly, since it was part and parcel of the last continent
 of <strong>A</strong>TLANTIS. And it is equally certain that it
 is Atlantis, which is assigned in the Hindu Puranas as the birth-place
 of Asuramaya, "as great a magician as he was an Astrologer
 and an Astronomer." Moreover, Prof. Weber refuses to assign
 any great antiquity to the Indian Zodiac, and feels inclined to
 think that the Hindus never knew of a Zodiac at all till "they
 had borrowed one from the Greeks."** This statement clashes
 with the most ancient traditions of India, and must therefore
 be ignored. (Vide "<em>The Zodiac and its Antiquity</em>")<em>.
 </em>We are the more justified in ignoring it, as the learned
 German Professor himself tells us in the introduction to his work
 (<em>History of Sanskrit Literature</em>)<em> </em>that "in
 addition to the natural obstacles which impede investigation (in
 India), there still prevails a dense mist of prejudices and preconceived
 opinions hovering over the land, and enfolding it as with a veil."
 Caught in that veil, it is no wonder that Dr. Weber should himself
 have been led into involuntary errors. Let us hope that he knows
 better now.
 </p><p>
 Now whether Asuramaya is to be considered a modern myth, a personage
 who flourished in the day of the Macedonian Greeks, or as that
 which he is claimed to be by the Occultists, in any case his calculations
 agree entirely with those of the Secret Records.
 </p><p>
 From fragments of immensely old works attributed to the Atlantean
 astronomer, and found in Southern India, the calendar elsewhere
 men-

 tioned was compiled by two very learned Brahmins* in 1884 and
 1885. The work is proclaimed by the best Pundits as faultless
 -- from the Brahmanical standpoint -- and thus far relates to
 the chronology of the orthodox teachings. If we compare its statements
 with those made several years earlier in "Isis Unveiled,"
 with the fragmentary teachings published by some Theosophists,
 and with the present data derived from the Secret Books of Occultism,
 the whole will be found to agree perfectly, save in some details
 which may not be explained; for secrets of higher Initiation --
 as unknown to the writer as they are to the reader -- would have
 to be revealed, and that <em>cannot be done.</em> (But see "<em>Chronology
 of the Brahmins</em>" at the close of Stanza <strong>II</strong>.)
