 <h4>THE MYSTERIES OF THE HEBDOMAD.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>W</strong>E must not close this Part on the Symbolism
 of Archaic History, without an attempt to explain the perpetual
 recurrence of this truly mystic number in every scripture known
 to the Orientalists. As every religion, from the oldest to the
 latest, claims its presence, and explains it on its own grounds
 agreeably with its own special dogmas, this is no easy task. We
 can, therefore, do no better or more explanatory work than to
 give a bird's-eye view of all. These sacred numbers (3, 4, 7)
 are the sacred numbers of <em>Light, Life,</em> and<em> Union
 </em>-- especially in this present manvantara, our Life-cycle;
 of which number seven is the special representative, or the <em>Factor
 </em>number. This has now to be demonstrated.
 </p><p>
 If one happened to ask a Brahmin learned in the Upanishads --
 so full of the secret wisdom of old, why "he, of whom seven
 forefathers have drunk the juice of the moon-plant, is <em>trisuparna,</em>"<em>
 </em>as Bopaveda is credited with saying; and why the Somapa Pitris
 should be worshipped by the Brahmin <em>trisuparna</em> -- very
 few could answer the question; or, if they knew, they would still
 less satisfy one's curiosity. Let us, then, hold to what the old
 Esoteric doctrine teaches.
 </p><p>
 "<em>When the first </em>'<em>Seven</em>'<em> appeared on
 earth, they threw the seed of</em> <em>everything that grows on
 the land into the soil. First came three, and</em> <em>four were
 added to these as soon as stone was transformed into plant.</em>
 <em>Then came the second </em>'<em>Seven,</em>'<em> who, guiding
 the </em>Jivas <em>of the plants,</em> <em>produced the middle
 </em>(<em>intermediate</em>)<em> natures between plant and moving</em>
 <em>living animal. The third </em>'<em>Seven</em>'<em> evolved</em>
 <em>their</em> Chhayas. . . . <em>The fifth</em> '<em>Seven</em>'<em>
 imprisoned their </em><strong>E</strong>SSENCE. . . . <em>Thus
 man became a Saptaparna.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Commentary.</em>)

 <h4><strong>S</strong>APTAPARNA.</h4>
 
 <p>
 Such is the name given in Occult phraseology to man. It means
 as shown elsewhere, a seven-leaved plant, and the name has a great
 significance in the Buddhist legends. So it had, also, under disguise,
 in the Greek "myths." The T, or <img src="sd1-5e.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 (<em>tau</em>)<i>, </i>formed from the figure 7, and the Greek
 letter [[<i>G</i>]] (<em>gamma</em>)<em>, </em>was<em> </em>(<em>see
 </em>ยง<em> </em>"<em>Cross and Circle</em>")<em>
 </em>the symbol of life,

 <p>
 and of life eternal: of earthly life, because [[<i>G</i>]] (<em>gamma</em>)<em>
 </em>is the symbol of the Earth (<em>gaia</em>)*; and of "life
 eternal," because the figure 7 is the symbol of the same
 life <em>linked with divine life, </em>the double glyph expressed
 in geometrical figures being: --
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-591a.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 a triangle and a quaternary, the symbol of <em>septenary </em>MAN.
 </p><p>
 Now, the number <em>six </em>has been regarded in the ancient
 mysteries as an emblem of <em>physical nature. </em>For six is
 the representation of the <em>six</em> dimensions of all bodies:
 the <em>six </em>lines which compose their form, namely, the four
 lines extending to the four cardinal points, North, South, East,
 and West, and the two lines of height and thickness that answer
 to the Zenith and the Nadir. Therefore, while the <em>senary </em>was
 applied by the sages to <em>physical </em>man, the <em>septenary
 </em>was for them the symbol of that man <em>plus </em>his immortal
 soul.
 </p><p>
 Ragon gives in his <em>Maconnerie Occulte </em>a very good illustration
 of the "hieroglyphical senary," as he calls our double
 equilateral triangle, <img src="sd2-591b.gif" align="BOTTOM">.
 He shows it as the symbol of the commingling of the "<em>philosophical
 three </em>fires and the <em>three </em>waters, whence results
 the procreation of the elements of all things. The same idea is
 found in the Indian equilateral double triangle. For, though it
 is called in that country the sign of Vishnu, yet in truth it
 is the symbol of the Triad (or the Trimurti). For, even in the
 exoteric rendering, the lower triangle <img src="sd2-591c.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 with the apex downward, is the symbol of Vishnu, the god of the
 moist principle and water ("<em>Nara</em>-yana," or
 the moving Principle in <em>Nara, </em>water;**) while the triangle,
 with its apex upward, <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> is
 Siva, the Principle of Fire, symbolized by the triple flame in
 his hand. (See the bronze statue of Tripurantika Siva, "Mahadeva
 destroying Tripurasura," at the museum of the India House).
 It is these two interlaced triangles -- wrongly called "Solomon's
 seal," which also form the emblem of our

 * Hence the Initiates in Greece called the <em>Tau</em> [[<i>I</i>]]<em>,
 </em>son of <em>gaia</em>, "sprung from earth," like
 <em>Tityos </em>in Odyssey 7, 324.
 </p><p>
 ** See the <em>Mahabharata, e.g.,</em><strong> III</strong>.,
 189, 3, where Vishnu says, "I called the name of water <em>nara</em>
 in ancient times, and am hence called <em>Narayana</em>, for that
 was always the abode I moved in" (<em>Ayana</em>). It is
 into the water (or chaos, the "moist principle" of the
 Greeks and Hermes), that the first seed of the Universe is thrown.
 "The 'Spirit of God' moves on the dark waters of Space";
 hence Thales makes of it the primordial element and prior to Fire,
 which was yet latent in that Spirit.</p><hr>

 <p>
 Society -- that produce the Septenary and the Triad at one and
 the same time, and are the <em>Decad, </em>whatever way this sign
 <img src="sd2-591b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> is examined, as all the
 ten numbers are contained therein. For with a point in the middle
 or centre, thus <img src="sd2-36b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> it is a
 sevenfold sign; its triangles denote number 3; the <em>two</em>
 triangles show the presence of the binary; the triangles with
 the central point common to both yield the quaternary; the six
 points are the senary; and the central point, the unit; the <em>quinary
 </em>being traced by combination, as a compound of <i>two</i>
 triangles, the even number, and of <em>three </em>sides in each
 triangle, the first odd number. This is the reason why Pythagoras
 and the ancients made the number <em>six </em>sacred to Venus,
 since "the union of the two sexes, and the spagyrisation
 of matter by triads are necessary to develop the generative force,
 that prolific virtue and tendency to reproduction which is inherent
 in all bodies."*
 </p><p>
 Belief in "Creators," or the personified Powers of Nature,
 is in truth no polytheism, but a philosophical necessity. Like
 all the other planets of our system, the Earth has seven Logoi
 -- the emanating rays of the one "Father-Ray" -- the
 PROTOGONOS, or the manifested "Logos" -- he who sacrifices
 his Esse (or flesh, the Universe) that the world may live and
 every creature therein have conscious being.
 </p><p>
 Numbers 3 and 4 are respectively male and female, Spirit and Matter,
 and their union is the emblem of life eternal in spirit on its
 ascending arc, and in matter as the ever resurrecting element
 -- by procreation and reproduction. The spiritual male line is
 vertical <img src="sd2-592a.gif" align="BOTTOM">; the differentiated
 matter-line is horizontal; the two forming the cross or <img src="sd2-592b.gif" align="BOTTOM">.
 The former (the 3), is invisible; the latter (the 4), is on the
 plane of objective perception. This is why all the matter of the
 Universe, when analyzed by science to its ultimates, can be reduced
 to four elements only -- carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen:
 and why the three primaries, the noumenoi of the four, or graduated
 Spirit or Force, have remained a <em>terra incognita </em>and
 mere speculations, names, to exact Science. Her servants must
 believe in and study first the primary causes, before they can
 hope to fathom the nature and acquaint themselves with the potentialities
 of the effects. Thus, while the men of Western learning had, and
 still have, the four, or matter to toy with, the Eastern Occultists
 and their disciples, the great alchemists the world over, have
 the whole septenate to study from.** As those Alche-

 mists have it: -- "When the Three and the Four kiss each
 other, the Quaternary joins its middle nature with that of the
 Triangle," (or Triad, <em>i.e.</em>, the face of one of its
 plane surfaces becoming the middle face of the other), "and
 becomes a cube; then only does it (the cube unfolded) become the
 vehicle and the number of <strong>L</strong>IFE, the Father-Mother
 <strong>S</strong>EVEN."

 these parallelisms.

 <em>Upadhis</em> (bases) including the Ego -- the reflected image
 of the Logos in the "Karana Sarira" -- and even "strictly
 speaking . . . . only three Upadhis." For purely theoretical
 metaphysical philosophy, or purposes of meditation, these three
 may be sufficient, as shown by the Taraka Yoga system; but for
 <em>practical occult teaching </em>our septenary division is the
 best and easiest. It is, however, a matter of school and choice.

 stones that hardened" (Stanza) followed by the "hard
 plants that softened," which are the product of the mineral,
 for "it is from the bosom of the stone that vegetation is
 born" (<em>Commentary, Book IX., F. </em>19); and then to
 man -- all the primitive models in every kingdom of nature begin
 by being ethereal, transparent, films. This, of course, takes
 place only in the first beginning of life. With the next period
 they consolidate, and at the <em>seventh </em>begin to branch
 off into species, <em>all except men, </em>the first of the mammalian
 animals* in the Fourth Round.

 Virgil, versed as every ancient poet was, more or less, in esoteric
 philosophy, sang evolution in the following strains: --
 </p><blockquote>
 Principio coelum ac terras, camposque liquentes<br>
 Lucentemque globum lunae, Titaniaque astra*<br>
 <strong>S</strong>PIRITUS intus alit; totamque infusa per artus
 <br>
 <strong>M</strong>ENS agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet
 <br>
 Inde Hominum pecudumque genus, etc.** (AEneid <strong>VI</strong>.
 )
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 "First came three, or the triangle." This expression
 has a profound meaning in Occultism, and the fact is corroborated
 in mineralogy, botany, and even in geology, as was demonstrated
 in the section on "Ancient Chronology," by the compound
 number seven, the three and the four being in it. Salt in solution
 proves it. For when its molecules, clustering together, begin
 to deposit themselves as a solid, the first shape they assume
 is that of triangles, of small pyramids and cones. It is the figure
 of <em>fire</em>, whence the word "<em>pyramids</em>"<em>;
 </em>while the second geometrical figure in <em>manifested </em>Nature
 is a square or a cube, 4 and 6; for, "the particles of earth
 being cubical, those of fire are pyramidal" truly -- (Enfield).
 The pyramidal shape is that assumed by the pines -- the most primitive
 tree after the fern period. Thus the two opposites in cosmic nature
 -- fire and water, heat and cold -- begin their metrographical
 manifestations, one by a trimetric, the other by a hexagonal system.
 For the stellate crystals of snow, viewed under a microscope,
 are all and each of them a double or a treble six-pointed star,
 with a central nucleus, like a miniature star within the larger
 one. Says Mr.

 <em>* Protista </em>are not animals. The reader is asked to bear
 in mind that when we speak of "animals," the mammalians
 alone are meant. Crustacea, fishes, and reptiles are contemporary
 with, and most have preceded <em>physical </em>man in this Round.
 All were bisexual, however, before the age of mammalia in the
 closing portion of the secondary or Mesozoic ages, <em>yet nearer
 to the Palaeozoic than the Cenozoic ages. </em>Smaller marsupial
 mammalia are contemporary with the huge reptilian monsters of
 the Secondary.

 Darwin, in his "Descent of Man," p. 164. showing that
 the inhabitants of the sea-shore are greatly affected by the tides:
 --
 </p><blockquote>
 "The most ancient progenitors in the Kingdom of the Vertebrata
 . . . apparently consisted of a group of marine animals. . . .
 Animals living either about the <em>mean </em>high-water mark,
 or about the <em>mean</em> low-water mark, pass through a complete
 cycle of tidal changes in a fortnight. . . . Now it is a mysterious
 fact that in the higher and now terrestrial Vertebrata . . . many
 normal and abnormal processes have one or more weeks (septenates)
 as their periods . . . such as gestation of mammals, the duration
 of fevers," etc. . . "The eggs of the pigeon are hatched
 in two weeks (or 14 days); those of the fowl in three; those of
 the duck in four: those of the goose in five; and those of the
 ostrich in seven." (Bartlett's "Land and Water.")
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 This number is closely connected with the moon, whose occult influence
 is ever manifesting itself in septenary periods. It is the moon
 which is the guide of the occult side of terrestrial nature, while
 the Sun is the regulator and factor of manifested life; (See also
 Vol. I., Part<strong> II</strong>.), and this truth was ever evident
 to the Seers and the adepts. Jacob Boehme, by insisting on the
 fundamental doctrine of the seven properties of everlasting mother
 Nature, proved himself thereby a great Occultist.
 </p><p>
 But to return to the consideration of the septenary in ancient
 religious symbolism. To the metrological key to the symbolism
 of the Hebrews, which reveals numerically the geometrical relations
 of the Circle (All-Deity) to the Square, Cube, Triangle, and all
 the integral emanations of the divine area, may be added the theogonic
 Key. This Key explains that Noah, the deluge-Patriarch, is in
 one aspect the permutation of the Deity (the Universal Creative
 Law), for the purpose of the formation of our Earth, its population,
 and the propagation of life on it, in general.
 </p><p>
 Now bearing in mind the Septenary division in divine Hierarchies,
 as in Cosmic and human constitutions, the student will readily
 understand that Jah-Noah is at the head of, and is the synthesis
 of the lower Cosmic Quaternary. The upper Sephirothal <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,
 triad -- of which Jehovah-Binah (Intelligence) is the left, female
 angle -- emanates the <img src="sd1-114a.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 Quaternary. The latter symbolizing by itself the "Heavenly
 Man," the sexless Adam-Kadmon viewed as Nature in the abstract,
 becomes a septenate again by emanating from itself the additional
 three principles, the lower terrestrial or manifested physical
 Nature, Matter and our Earth (the seventh being Malkuth, the "Bride
 of the Heavenly Man"), thus forming, with the higher triad,
 or Kether, the Crown, the full number of the Sephirothal Tree
 -- the 10, the Total in Unity, or the Universe. Apart from the
 higher Triad, the lower creative Sephiroth are seven.
 </p><p>
 The above is not directly to our point, though it is a necessary
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 596 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 reminder to facilitate the comprehension of what follows. The
 question at issue is to show that Jah-Noah, or the Jehovah of
 the Hebrew Bible, the alleged Creator of our Earth, of man and
 all upon it, is: --
 </p><p>
 (<i>a</i>) The lowest Septenary, the Creative Elohim -- in his
 Cosmic aspect.
 </p><p>
 (<i>b</i>) The Tetragrammaton or the Adam-Kadmon, "the Heavenly
 Man" of the Four letters -- in his theogonic and Kabalistic
 aspects.
 </p><p>
 (<i>c</i>) Noah -- identical with the Hindu <em>Sishta, </em>the
 human seed, left for the peopling of the Earth from a previous
 creation or Manvantara, as expressed in the Puranas, or the pre-diluvian
 period as rendered allegorically in the Bible -- in his Cosmic
 character.
 </p><p>
 But whether a Quaternary (Tetragrammaton) or a Triad, the Bible
 Creative God is not the Universal 10, unless blended with <strong>A</strong>IN-<strong>S</strong>OPH
 (as Brahma with Parabrahm), but a septenary, one of the many Septenaries
 of the Universal Septenate. In the explanation of the question
 now in hand, his position and status as Noah may best be shown
 by placing the 3, <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,and 4,
 <img src="sd1-114a.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> on parallel lines with
 the "Cosmic" and "Human" principles. For the
 latter, the old familiar classification is made use of. Thus:

 the infinite field or plane of Universal Consciousness; and Asath

 65. The author explains, "Note that in Hebrew, <em>Jared</em>,
 the father of Enoch, is construed to be '<em>the mount of descent,</em>'<em>
 </em>and it is said to be the same with <em>Ararat </em>on which
 the cubical structure of <em>Noah, </em>or<em> foundation measure
 </em>rested. <em>Jared, </em>in Hebrew, is <img src="sd2-597b.gif" align="BOTTOM">.
 The root derivations are the same with those of <em>Ararat, </em>of
 <em>acre, </em>of earth." As by Hebrew metrology "Jared,
 <img src="sd2-597b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> is, <em>literally in British
 </em>Y R D; hence in <em>Jared </em>is to be found <em>literally
 </em>our English word <em>yard</em> (and also <img src="sd2-597b.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 for <em>Jah, </em>or <em>Jehovah, is rod</em>)<em>. </em>It is
 noteworthy that the son of <em>Jared, </em>viz<em>., Enoch, </em>lived
 365 years, and it is said of him by rabbinical commentators, that
 the year period of 365 days was discovered by him, thus bringing,
 again, <em>time and distance </em>values together, <em>i.e., year</em>
 <em>time</em> descended by co-ordination, through the <em>yard,</em>
 or<em> jared, </em>who<em> thus was its father,</em> in or through
 <em>Enoch</em>; and truly enough, 1296 = <em>yard </em>(or <em>jared</em>)<em>

 65). This, however, by the astronomical and numerical Kabalistic
 methods. Esoterically, Jared is the Third race and Enoch the Fourth
 -- but as he is taken away alive he symbolizes also the Elect
 saved in the Fourth, while Noah is the Fifth from the beginning
 -- the family saved from the waters, eternally and <em>physically.</em>

 Thus Number Seven, as a compound of 3 and 4, <em>is </em>the factor
 element in every ancient religion, because <em>it is the factor
 element in nature. </em>Its adoption must be justified, and it
 must be shown to <i>be</i> the number <em>par</em> <em>excellence,
 </em>for, since the appearance of "Esoteric Buddhism,"
 frequent objections have been made, and doubts expressed as to
 the correctness of these assertions.

 And here let the student be told at once, that in all such numerical
 divisions the <strong>O</strong>NE universal Principle, -- although
 referred to as (the) one, because the <em>Only One -- </em>never
 enters into the calculations.<strong> I</strong>T stands, in its
 character of the Absolute, the Infinite, and the universal abstraction,
 entirely by <strong>I</strong>TSELF and independent of every other
 Power whether noumenal or phenomenal. <strong>I</strong>T "is
 neither matter nor spirit; <strong>I</strong>T is neither Ego
 nor non-Ego; and <strong>I</strong>T is neither object nor subject,"
 says the author of "<em>Personal and Impersonal God,</em>"<em>
 </em>and adds: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "In the language of Hindu philosophers it is the original
 and eternal combination of Purusha (Spirit) and Prakriti (matter).
 As the Adwaitees hold that an external object is merely the product
 of our mental states, Prakriti is nothing more than an illusion,
 and Purusha is the only reality; it is the <strong>O</strong>NE
 existence which remains in the universe of Ideas. This . . . then,
 is the Parabrahm of the Adwaitees. . . . ."
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "Even if there were to be a personal God with anything like
 a material <em>upadhi</em> (physical basis of whatever form),
 from the standpoint of an Adwaitee there will be as much reason
 to doubt his noumenal existence, as there would be in the case
 of any other object. In their opinion, a conscious God cannot
 be the origin of the Universe, as his Ego would be the effect
 of a previous cause, if the word conscious conveys but its ordinary
 meaning. They cannot admit that <em>the grand total of all the
 states of consciousness in the Universe </em>is their deity, as
 these states are constantly changing, and as cosmic ideation ceases
 during <em>Pralaya</em>. There is only one permanent condition
 in the Universe, which is the state of perfect unconsciousness,
 bare <em>Chidakasam </em>(the field of consciousness) in fact.
 When my readers once realize the fact that this grand universe
 is in reality but a huge aggregation of various states of consciousness,
 they will not be surprised to find that the ultimate state of
 unconsciousness is considered as Parabrahmam by the Adwaitees."*

 <p>
 Being itself entirely out of human reckoning or calculation, yet
 this "huge aggregation of various states of consciousness"
 is a Septenate,

 in <em>its</em> totality entirely composed of Septenary groups;
 simply because "the capacity of perception <em>exists in
 seven different aspects corresponding</em> <em>to the seven conditions
 of matter</em>"<em> </em>(<em>ibid</em>)<em>, </em>or the
 seven properties, or states, or conditions of matter. And, therefore,
 number 1 down to number 7 begins in the esoteric calculations
 with the first manifested principle, which is number one if we
 commence from above, and the <em>seventh </em>when reckoning from
 below, or from the lowest Principle.
 </p><p>
 The <em>Tetrad </em>is esteemed in the Kabala, as it was by Pythagoras,
 the most perfect, or rather <em>sacred</em> number, because it
 emanated from the <em>one,</em> the first manifested Unit, or
 rather <em>the three in one. </em>Yet the latter has been ever
 impersonal, sexless, incomprehensible, though within the possibility
 of the higher mental perceptions.

 is the <em>Second logos, </em>the Demiurgos. The Tetrad, as Thomas
 Taylor thought (<em>vide</em> the<em> </em>"<em>Pythagorean
 Triangle</em>")<em>, </em>"is the <em>animal itself
 </em>of Plato, who, as Syrianus justly observes, was the best
 of the Pythagoreans; it subsists at the extremity of the intelligible
 triad, as is most satisfactorily shown by Proclus in the third
 book of his treatise on the theology of Plato. And between these
 two triads (the double triangle), the one intelligible, and the
 other intellectual, another order of gods exists which partakes
 of both extremes." "The Pythagorean world," Plutarch
 tells us (in <em>De anim. procr.,</em> 1027)<em> </em>"<em>consisted
 of a double</em> <em>quaternary.</em>"<em> </em>This statement
 corroborates what is said about the choice, by the exoteric theologies,
 <em>of the lower </em>Tetraktis. For: -- "The quaternary
 of the intellectual world (the world of <em>Mahat</em>)<em> </em>is
 T'Agathon, Nous, Psyche, Hyle; while that of the sensible world
 (of matter), which is properly what Pythagoras meant by the word
 Kosmos -- is Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. The four elements are
 called by the name of <em>rizomata, </em>the roots or principles
 <em>of all mixed bodies,</em>"<em> i.e., </em>the lower Tetraktis
 is the root of <em>illusion </em>of the world of matter; and this
 is the tetragrammaton of the Jews, and the "mysterious deity,"
 over which the modern Kabalists make such a fuss!

 "Thus number <em>four</em> forms the arithmetical mean between
 the monad and the <em>heptad, </em>as this contains all powers,
 both of the productive and produced numbers; for this of all numbers
 under ten, is made of a certain number; the duad doubled makes
 a tetrad, and the tetrad doubled or unfolded makes the <em>hebdomad
 </em>(the septenary). Two multiplied into itself produces four;
 and retorted into itself makes the first cube. This first cube
 <em>is a fertile number, </em>the ground of multitude and variety,
 constituted of two and four (depending on the monad, the <em>seventh</em>)<em>.
 </em>Thus the two principles of temporal things, the <em>pyramis
 </em>and</p><hr>

 <p>
 cube, form and matter, flow from one fountain, the tetragon (on
 earth) the<em> monad </em>(in heaven) . . . . " (See Reuchlin,
 "<em>Cabala</em>"<em> </em>1<em>, </em>ii.).
 </p><p>
 Here Reuchlin, the great authority on the Kabala, shows the cube
 to be <em>matter, </em>whereas the pyramid or the <em>triad </em>is
 "form." With the Hermesians the number four becomes
 the symbol of truth <em>only when amplified into a cube, </em>which,
 unfolded, makes seven, as symbolizing the male and female elements
 and the element of <strong>L</strong>IFE.*
 </p><p>
 Some students have been puzzled to account for the vertical line,
 which is male, becoming (<em>vide infra</em>)<em> </em>in the
 cross a four-partitioned line <em>-- four </em>being a female
 number, while the horizontal (the line of matter) becomes three-divisioned.
 But this is easy of explanation. Since the middle face of the
 cube unfolded <em>is common </em>to both the vertical and the
 horizontal bar, or double-line, it becomes <em>neutral</em> ground
 so to say, and belongs to neither. The spirit line remains triadic,
 and the matter line two-fold -- two being an even and therefore
 a female number also. Moreover, according to Theon, the Pythagoreans
 who gave the name of Harmony to the Tetraktis, "because it
 is a diatessaron in sesquitertia" -- were of opinion that
 "the division of the canon of the monochord was made by the
 tetraktis in the <em>duad, triad, </em>and<em> tetrad;</em> for
 it comprehends a sesquitertia, a sesquialtera, a double, a triple,
 and a quadruple proportion, the section of which is 27."
 "In the ancient musical notation, the tetrachord consisted
 of <em>three </em>degrees or intervals, and <em>four </em>terms
 of sounds called by the Greeks diatessaron, and by us a fourth."
 Moreover, the quaternary though an even, therefore a female ("infernal")
 number, varied according to its form. This is shown by Stanley
 (in <em>Pythag. </em>p. 61). The 4 was called by the

 "Here we have the famous 4, and 3, and 7." Esoteric
 philosophy explains that <em>four</em> is the symbol of the Universe
 in its potential state, or <em>chaotic matter,</em> and that it
 requires Spirit to permeate it actively, <em>i.e.</em>, the primordial
 <em>abstract </em>triangle has to quit its one dimensional quality
 and spread across that matter, thus forming a <em>manifested</em>
 basis on the three dimensional space, in order that the Universe
 should manifest intelligibly. This is achieved by the cube unfolded.
 Hence the <em>ansated </em>cross <img src="sd2-29b.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 as the symbol of man, generation and life. In Egypt <em>ank</em>
 signified soul, life and blood. It is the <em>ensouled,</em> <em>living</em>
 man, the Septenary. </p><hr>

 <p>
 Pythagoreans the Key-Keeper of Nature; but in union with the 3,
 which made it seven, it became the most perfect and harmonious
 number -- <em>nature</em> <em>herself. </em>The four was "the
 Masculine of Feminine Form," when forming the Cross; and
 Seven is "the Master of the Moon," for this planet is
 forced to alter her appearance every seven days. It is on number
 seven that Pythagoras composed his doctrine on the Harmony and
 Music of the Spheres, calling "a tone" the distance
 of the Moon from the Earth; from the Moon to Mercury half a tone,
 from thence to Venus the same; from Venus to the Sun l 1/2 tones;
 from the Sun to Mars a tone; from thence to Jupiter 1/2 a tone;
 from Jupiter to Saturn 1/2 a tone; and thence to the Zodiac a
 tone; thus making seven tones -- the diapason harmony. All the
 melody of nature is in those seven tones, and therefore is called
 "the Voice of Nature."
 </p><p>
 Plutarch explains (<em>de Plac. Phil., </em>p. 878) that the Achaean
 Greeks regarded the tetrad as the root and principle of all things,
 since it was the number of the elements which gave birth to all
 visible and invisible <em>created</em> things. With the brothers
 of the Rosy Cross, the figure of the Cross, or <em>Cube unfolded,
 </em>formed the subject of a disquisition in one of the theosophic
 degrees of Peuret, and was treated according to the fundamental
 principles of light and darkness, <em>or good and evil.</em> 
 </p><blockquote>
 "The intelligible world proceeds out of the divine mind (or
 unit) after this manner. The Tetraktis reflecting upon its own
 essence, <em>the first unit, productrix</em> <em>of all things,
 </em>and on its own beginning, saith thus: Once one, twice two,
 immediately ariseth a tetrad, having on its top the highest unit,
 <em>and becomes a Pyramis,</em> <em>whose base </em>is a plain
 tetrad, answerable to a superficies, upon which the radiant light
 of the divine unity produceth the form of incorporeal fire, by
 reason of the descent of Juno (matter) to inferior things. Hence
 ariseth essential light, not burning but illuminating. This <em>is
 the creation of the middle world, </em>which the Hebrews <em>call
 the Supreme, </em>the world of the (<em>their</em>)<em> </em>deity.
 It is termed Olympus, entirely light, and replete with separate
 forms, where is the seat of the immortal gods, '<em>deum domus
 alta,</em>'<em> </em>whose top is UNITY, its wall <em>trinity,</em>
 and its superficies <em>quaternity.</em>"<em> </em>(Reuchlin,<em>
 Cabala, </em>p. 689).
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 The "superficies" has thus to remain a <em>meaningless
 surface, </em>if left by itself. <strong>U</strong>NITY only "illuminating"
 <em>quaternity; </em>the famous lower four has to build for itself
 also a wall from <em>trinity, </em>if it would be manifested.
 Moreover, the <em>tetragrammaton, </em>or Microprosopus, is "Jehovah"
 arrogating to himself very improperly the "Was, Is, Will
 be," now translated into the "<em>I am that I am,</em>"<em>
 </em>and interpreted as referring to the highest abstract Deity,
 while esoterically and in plain truth, it means only periodically
 chaotic, turbulent, and eternal MATTER with all its potentialities.
 For the Tetragrammaton is one with Nature or Isis, and is the
 exoteric series of androgyne gods such as Osiris-Isis, Jove-Juno,
 Brahma-Vach, or the Kabalistic <em>Jah-hovah; </em>all male-females.
 Every <em>anthropomorphic </em>god, in old nations, as Marcelinus
 Vicinus well observed,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 602 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 has his name written with four letters. Thus with the Egyptians,
 he was <em>Teut; </em>the Arabs, <em>Alla</em>; the Persians,
 <em>Sire</em>; the Magi, <em>Orsi; </em>the Mohammedans, <em>Abdi</em>;
 the Greeks, <em>Theos; </em>the ancient Turks, <em>Esar; </em>the
 Latins, <em>Deus; </em>to which J. Lorenzo Anania adds the German
 <em>Gott; </em>the Sarmatian, <em>Bouh</em>, etc., etc.
 </p><p>
 The Monad being one, and an <em>odd</em> number, the ancients
 therefore called the odd, the only perfect numbers; and -- selfishly,
 perhaps, yet as a fact -- considered them all as masculine and
 perfect, being applicable to the celestial gods, while even numbers,
 such as two, <em>four, </em>six, and especially eight, as being
 female, were regarded as imperfect, and given only to the <em>terrestrial</em>
 <em>and infernal deities. </em>In his eighth eclogue, Virgil records
 the fact by saying, "<em>Numero deus impare gaudet,</em>"<em>
 </em>"Unequal numbers please the gods."
 </p><p>
 But number <em>seven, </em>or the <em>heptagon, </em>the Pythagoreans
 considered to be a <em>religious and perfect </em>number. It was
 called "<em>Telesphoros,</em>" because <em>by it all
 in the Universe and mankind is led to its end, i.e., </em>its
 culmination (<em>Philo. de Mund. opif.</em>)<em>. </em>Being under
 the rule of seven sacred planets,* the doctrine of the Spheres
 shows, from Lemuria to Pythagoras, the seven powers of terrestrial
 and sublunary nature, as well as the seven great Forces of the
 Universe, proceeding and evolving in seven tones, which are the
 seven notes of the musical scale. The <em>heptad</em> (our Septenary)
 was regarded "<em>as the number of a virgin, because it is</em>
 <em>unborn</em>"<em> </em>(like the Logos or the "Aja"
 of the Vedantins); "without a father or a mother, <em>but
 proceeding directly from the Monad, </em>which is the origin and
 crown of all things." (<em>Pythag. Triangle, </em>p. 174.)
 And if the <em>heptad </em>is made to proceed from the Monad directly,
 then it is, as taught in the Secret Doctrine of the oldest schools,
 the perfect and sacred number of this Maha-Manvantara of ours.
 </p><p>
 The septenary, or <em>heptad, </em>was sacred indeed to several
 gods and goddesses; to Mars, with his seven attendants, to Osiris,
 whose body was divided into seven and twice seven parts; to Apollo
 (the Sun), between his seven planets, and playing the hymn to
 the seven-rayed on his seven-stringed harp; to Minerva, the fatherless
 and the motherless, and others.
 </p><p>
 Cis-Himalayan Occultism with its <em>sevening, </em>and because
 of such sevening, must be regarded as the most ancient, the original
 of all. It is opposed by <em>some </em>fragments left by Neo-Platonists;
 and the admirers of the latter, who hardly understand what they
 defend, say to us: "See, your forerunners believed only in
 <em>triple </em>man, composed of

 * The seven planets are not limited to this number because the
 ancients knew of no others, but simply because they were the primitive
 or primordial <em>houses </em>of the seven <em>Logoi. </em>There
 may be nine and ninety-nine other planets discovered -- this does
 not alter the fact of these seven alone being sacred.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 603 THE SEPTENARY DEMONSTRATED. </h6>
 
 <p>
 Spirit, Soul, and body. Behold, the Taraka Raja Yoga of India
 limits that division to 3, we, to 4, and the Vedantins to 5 (koshas)."
 To this, we of the Archaic school, ask: --
 </p><p>
 Why then does the Greek poet say that "<em>it is not four
 </em>but SEVEN who sing the praise of the Spiritual Sun,"
 [[<i>HEPTA ME</i>]]? He says--
 </p><blockquote>
 "Seven sounding letters sing the praise of me,<br>
 The immortal God, the Almighty deity." <br>
 . . .
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Why again is the <em>triune </em><strong>I</strong>AO (the Mystery
 God) called the "fourfold," and yet the triad and tetradic
 symbols come under one unified name with the Christians -- the
 Jehovah of the seven letters? Why again in the Hebrew Sheba is
 the Oath (the Pythagorean <em>Tetraktis</em>)<em> </em>identical
 with number 7; or, as Mr. G. Massey has it, "taking an oath
 was synonymous with 'to seven,' and the 10 expressed by the letter
 <em>Yod, </em>was the full number of <strong>I</strong>AO-<strong>S</strong>ABAOTH,
 the ten-lettered God"? In Lucian's <em>Auction,</em> Pythagoras
 asks, "How do you reckon?" The reply is, "One,
 Two, Three, Four." "Then, do you see," says Pythagoras,
 "in <em>what you</em> <em>conceive </em><strong>F</strong>OUR
 there are Ten; then, <em>a perfect triangle and our Oath</em>
 (tetraktis, <em>four!</em>)<em>,</em>"<em> </em>or Seven.
 Why does Proclus say in <em>Timaeus,</em> c<em>. iii.</em> -<em>-</em>
 "The Father of the golden verses celebrates the Tetractys
 as the fountain of perennial nature"?
 </p><p>
 Simply because those Western Kabalists who quote the <em>exoteric
 </em>proofs against us have no idea of the real <em>esoteric </em>meaning.
 Because all the ancient Cosmologies -- the oldest Cosmographies
 of the two most ancient people of the Fifth Root Race, the Hindu
 Aryans and the Egyptians, adding to them the early Chinese races
 (the remnants of the Fourth or Atlantean Race) -- based the whole
 of their mysteries on number 10: the higher triangle standing
 for the invisible and metaphysical world, the lower three and
 four, or the <em>Septenate, </em>for the physical realm. It is
 not the Jewish Bible that brought number seven into prominence.
 Hesiod used the words "The seventh is the sacred day,"
 before the Sabbath of "Moses" was ever heard of. The
 use of number seven was never confined to any one nation. This
 is well testified by the seven vases in the temple of the Sun,
 near the ruins of Babion in Upper Egypt; the seven fires burning
 continually for ages before the altars of Mithra; the seven holy
 fanes of the Arabians; the seven peninsulas, the seven islands,
 seven seas, mountains, and rivers of India; and of the <em>Zohar
 </em>(See<em> Ibn Gebirol</em>)<em>; </em>the Jewish Sephiroth
 of the <em>Seven </em>splendours; the seven Gothic deities, the
 seven worlds of the Chaldeans and their seven Spirits; the seven
 constellations mentioned by Hesiod and Homer; and all the interminable
 sevens which the Orientalists find in every <strong>MS</strong>.
 they discover.
 </p><p>
 What we have to say finally is this: Enough has been brought forward
 to show why the human principles were and are divided in the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 604 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 esoteric schools into seven. Make it <em>four </em>and it will
 either leave man <em>minus </em>his lower terrestrial elements,
 or, if viewed from a physical stand-point, make of him a soulless
 animal. The Quaternary must be the higher or the lower -- the
 celestial or terrestrial Tetraktis: to become comprehensible,
 according to the teachings of the esoteric <em>ancient</em> school
 man must be regarded as a Septenary. This was so well understood,
 that even the so-called Christian Gnostics had adopted this time-honoured
 system (<em>Vide </em>ยง on "<em>The Seven Souls</em>")<em>.
 </em>This remained for a long time secret as, though suspected,
 no <strong>MSS</strong>. of that time spoke of it clearly enough
 to satisfy the sceptic. But there comes to our rescue the literary
 curiosity of our age -- the oldest and best preserved gospel of
 the Gnostics, <em>Pistis Sophia </em>[[<i>Pictic Cophia</i>]].
 To make the proof absolutely complete, we shall quote from an
 authority (C. W. King) -- the only archaeologist who had a faint
 glimmer of this elaborate doctrine, and the best writer of the
 day on the Gnostics and their gems.
 </p><p>
 According to this extraordinary piece of religious literature
 -- a true Gnostic fossil -- the human Entity is the Septenary
 ray from the One,* just as our school teaches. It is composed
 of seven elements, four of which are borrowed from the four Kabalistical
 manifested worlds. Thus "from Asia it gets the <em>Nephesh
 </em>or seat of the physical appetites (vital breath, also); from
 Jezirah, the Ruach, or seat of the passions (? !); from Briah,
 the <em>Neshamah, </em>and from Aziluth it obtains the <em>Chaiah,</em>
 or principle of spiritual life;" (King). "This looks
 like an adaptation of the Platonic theory of the Soul's obtaining
 its respective faculties from the Planets in its downward progress
 through their Spheres. But the <em>Pistis-Sophia, </em>with its
 accustomed boldness, puts this theory into a much more poetical
 shape (ยง 282)." The <em>Inner Man </em>is similarly
 made up of <em>four </em>constituents, <em>but these are supplied
 by the rebellious AEons of</em> <em>the Spheres, </em>being the
 <em>Power -- </em>a particle of the Divine light ("<em>Divinae</em>
 <em>particula aurae</em>")<em> </em>yet left in themselves;
 the <em>Soul </em>(the fifth) "formed out of the tears of
 their eyes, and the sweat of their torments; the [[<i>Antimimon
 Prieumatos</i>]]<em>, Counterfeit of the Spirit </em>(seemingly
 answering to our Conscience), (<em>the sixth</em>)<em>; </em>and
 lastly the [[<i>Moira</i>]], <em>Fate** </em>(Karmic Ego), whose

 * The Seven Centres of Energy evolved, or rendered objective by
 the action of Fohat upon the one element; or, in fact, the "<em>Seventh</em>
 Principle" of the Seven Elements which exist throughout manifested
 Kosmos. We may here point out that they are in truth the Sephiroth
 of the Kabalists; the "Seven gifts of the Holy Ghost"
 in the Christian system; and in a mystical sense, the seven children
 or sons of Devaki killed before the birth of Krishna by Kamsa.
 Our seven principles symbolize all of these. We have to part or
 separate from them before we reach the <em>Krishna or Christ-state,
 </em>that of a <em>Jivanmukta</em>, and centre ourselves entirely
 in the highest, the Seventh or the <strong>O</strong>NE.
