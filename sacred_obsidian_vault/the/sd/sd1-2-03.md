 Ether, this <em>hypothetical </em>Proteus, one of the "representative
 <em>Fictions</em>"<em> </em>of modern Science -- which, nevertheless,
 was so long <em>accepted</em> --<em> </em>is one of the lower
 "principles" of what we call PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE (Akasa,
 in Sanskrit), one of the <em>dreams </em>of old, and which has
 now become again the dream of modern science. It is the greatest,
 just as it is the boldest, of the surviving speculations of ancient
 philosophers. For the Occultists, however, both ETHER and the
 Primordial Substance are a reality. To put it plainly, ETHER is
 the Astral Light, and the Primordial Substance is <strong>A</strong>KASA,
 the <em>Upadhi </em>of DIVINE THOUGHT.
 </p><p>
 In modern language, the latter would be better named COSMIC IDEATION
 -- Spirit; the former, COSMIC SUBSTANCE, Matter. These, the Alpha
 and the Omega of Being, are but the two <em>facets </em>of the
 one Absolute Existence. The latter was never addressed, or even
 mentioned, by any name in antiquity, except allegorically. In
 the oldest Aryan race, the Hindu, the worship of the intellectual
 classes never consisted (as with the Greeks) in a fervent adoration
 of marvellous form and art, which led later on to anthropomorphism.
 But while the Greek philosopher adored form, and the Hindu sage
 alone "perceived the true relation of earthly beauty and
 eternal truth" -- the uneducated of every nation understood
 neither, at any time.
 </p><p>
 They do not understand it even now. The evolution of the <strong>G</strong>OD-IDEA
 proceeds apace with man's own intellectual evolution. So true
 it is that the noblest ideal to which the religious Spirit of
 one age can soar, will appear but a gross caricature to the philosophic
 mind in a succeeding epoch! The philosophers themselves had to
 be <em>initiated into perceptive mysteries</em>,<em> </em>before
 they could grasp the correct idea of the ancients in relation
 to this most metaphysical subject. Otherwise -- outside such initiation
 -- for every thinker there will be a "Thus far shalt thou
 go and no farther," mapped out by his intellectual capacity,
 as clearly and as unmistakeably as there is for the progress of
 any nation or race in its cycle by the law of Karma. Outside of
 initiation, the ideals of contemporary religious thought must
 always have their wings clipped and remain unable to soar higher;
 for idealistic as well as realistic thinkers, and even free-thinkers,
 are but the outcome and the natural product of their respective
 environments and periods. The ideals of both are only</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 327 DIVINE THOUGHT, OR CINERITIOUS MATTER.
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 the necessary results of their temperaments, and the outcome of
 that phase of intellectual progress to which a nation, in its
 collectivity, has attained. Hence, as already remarked, the highest
 flights of modern (Western) metaphysics have fallen far short
 of the truth. Much of current Agnostic speculation on the existence
 of the "First Cause" is little better than veiled materialism
 -- the terminology alone being different. Even so great a thinker
 as Mr. Herbert Spencer speaks of the "Unknowable" occasionally
 in terms that demonstrate the lethal influence of materialistic
 thought, which, like the deadly Sirocco, has withered and blighted
 all current ontological speculation.*
 </p><p>
 From the early ages of the Fourth Race, when Spirit alone was
 worshipped and the mystery was made manifest, down to the last
 palmy days of Grecian art at the dawn of Christianity -- the Hellenes
 alone had dared to raise publicly an altar to the <strong>U</strong>NKNOWN
 <strong>G</strong>OD. Whatever St. Paul may have had in his profound
 mind when declaring to the Athenians that this "unknown,"
 ignorantly worshipped by them, was the true God announced by himself
 -- that Deity <em>was not </em>"Jehovah" (<em>see </em>"<em>The
 Holy of Holies</em>"),<em> </em>nor was he "The Maker
 of the world and all things." For it is not the "God
 of Israel" but the "Unknown" of the ancient and
 modern Pantheist that "dwelleth not in temples <em>made with
 hands</em>"<em> </em>(Acts xviii., 23-4).
 </p><p>
 Divine thought cannot be defined, or its meaning explained, except
 by the numberless manifestations of Cosmic Substance in which
 the former <em>is sensed </em>spiritually by those who can do
 so. To say this, after having defined it as the Unknown Deity,
 abstract, impersonal, sexless, which must be placed at the root
 of every Cosmogony and its subsequent evolution, is equivalent
 to saying nothing at all. It is like attempting a transcendental
 equation of conditions for the true values of a set, having in
 hand for deducing them only a number of <em>unknown</em> quantities.
 Its place is found in the old primitive Symbolic charts, in which,
 as shown in the text, it is represented by a boundless darkness,
 on the ground of which appears the first central point in white
 -- thus symbolising coeval and co-eternal <strong>S</strong>PIRIT-<strong>M</strong>ATTER
 making its appearance in the phenomenal world, before its first
 differentiation. When "the one becomes two," it may
 then be

 <p>
 * For instance, when he terms the "First Cause" -- the
 <strong>U</strong>NKNOWABLE -- a "power <em>manifesting </em>through
 phenomena," and "an infinite eternal <em>Energy</em>"
 (?) it is clear that he has grasped solely the <em>physical </em>aspect
 of the mystery of Being -- the Energies of Cosmic Substance only.
 The co-eternal aspect of the <strong>O</strong>NE <strong>R</strong>EALITY
 -- Cosmic Ideation -- (as to its <em>noumenon</em>,<em> </em>it
 seems <em>non-existent </em>in the mind of the great thinker)
 is absolutely omitted from consideration. Without doubt, this
 <em>one-sided </em>mode of dealing with the problem is due largely
 to the pernicious Western practice of subordinating consciousness,
 or regarding it as a "by-product" of molecular motion.
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 328 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 referred to as Spirit <em>and</em> matter. To "Spirit"
 is referable every manifestation of consciousness, reflective
 or direct, and of <em>unconscious purposiveness </em>(to adopt
 a modern expression used in Western <em>philosophy</em>,<em> </em>so-called)
 as evidenced in the Vital Principle, and Nature's submission to
 the majestic sequence of immutable law. "Matter" must
 be regarded as objectivity in its purest abstraction -- the self-existing
 basis whose septenary manvantaric differentiations constitute
 the objective reality underlying the phenomena of each phase of
 conscious existence. During the period of Universal Pralaya, Cosmic
 Ideation is nonexistent; and the variously differentiated states
 of Cosmic Substance are resolved back again into the primary state
 of abstract potential objectivity.
 </p><p>
 Manvantaric impulse commences with the re-awakening of Cosmic
 Ideation (the "Universal Mind") concurrently with, and
 parallel to the primary emergence of Cosmic Substance -- the latter
 being the manvantaric vehicle of the former -- from its undifferentiated
 <em>pralayic </em>state. Then, absolute wisdom mirrors itself
 in its Ideation; which, by a transcendental process, superior
 to and incomprehensible by human Consciousness, results in Cosmic
 Energy (<em>Fohat</em>)<em>. </em>Thrilling through the bosom
 of inert Substance, <em>Fohat </em>impels it to activity, and
 guides its primary differentiations on all the Seven planes of
 Cosmic Consciousness. There are thus <em>Seven Protyles </em>(as
 they are now called), while Aryan antiquity called them the Seven
 Prakriti, or Natures, serving, severally, as the <em>relatively
 </em>homogeneous basis, which in the course of the increasing
 heterogeneity (in the evolution of the Universe) differentiate
 into the marvellous complexity presented by phenomena on the planes
 of perception. The term "relatively" is used designedly,
 because the very existence of such a process, resulting in the
 primary segregations of undifferentiated Cosmic Substance into
 its septenary bases of evolution, compels us to regard the <em>protyle*
 </em>of<em> </em>each plane as only a <em>mediate </em>phase assumed
 by Substance in its passage from abstract, into full objectivity.
 </p><p>
 Cosmic Ideation is said to be non-existent during Pralayic periods,
 for the simple reason that there is no one, and nothing, to perceive
 its effects. There can be no manifestation of Consciousness, semi-consciousness,
 or even "unconscious purposiveness," except through
 the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The term <em>Protyle </em>is due to Mr. Crookes, the eminent
 chemist, who has given that name to <em>pre-Matter</em>,<em> </em>if
 one may so call primordial and purely homogeneous substances,
 suspected, if not actually yet found, by Science in the ultimate
 composition of the atom. But the incipient segregation of primordial
 matter into atoms and molecules takes its rise subsequent to the
 evolution of the Seven <em>Protyles. </em>It is the last of these
 -- having recently detected the possibility of its existence on
 our plane -- that Mr. Crookes is in search of.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 329 THE UNIVERSAL ILLUSION.</h6>
 
 <p>
 vehicle of matter; that is to say, on this our plane, wherein
 human consciousness <em>in its normal state </em>cannot soar beyond
 what is known as transcendental metaphysics, it is only through
 some molecular aggregation or fabric that Spirit wells up in a
 stream of individual or sub-conscious subjectivity. And as Matter
 existing apart from perception is a mere abstraction, both of
 these aspects of the <strong>A</strong>BSOLUTE -- Cosmic Substance
 and Cosmic Ideation -- are mutually inter-dependent. In strict
 accuracy -- to avoid confusion and misconception -- the term "Matter"
 ought to be applied to the aggregate of objects of possible perception,
 and "Substance" to <em>noumena; </em>for inasmuch as
 the phenomena of <em>our </em>plane are the creation of the perceiving
 Ego -- the modifications of its own subjectivity -- all the "states
 of matter representing the aggregate of perceived objects"
 can have but a relative and purely phenomenal existence for the
 children of our plane. As the modern Idealists would say, the
 co-operation of Subject and Object results in the Sense-object
 or phenomenon. But this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion
 that it is the same on all other planes; that the co-operation
 of the two on the planes of their septenary differentiation results
 in a septenary aggregate of phenomena which are likewise non-existent
 <em>per se</em>,<em> </em>though concrete realities for the Entities
 of whose experience they form a part, in the same manner as the
 rocks and rivers around us are real from the stand-point of a
 physicist, though unreal illusions of sense from that of the metaphysician.
 It would be an error to say, or even conceive such a thing. From
 the stand-point of the highest metaphysics, the whole Universe,
 gods included, is an illusion; but the illusion of him who is
 in himself an illusion differs on every plane of consciousness;
 and we have no more right to dogmatise about the possible nature
 of the perceptive faculties of an Ego on, say, the sixth plane,
 than we have to identify our perceptions with, or make them a
 standard for, those of an ant, in <em>its </em>mode of consciousness.
 The pure object apart from consciousness* is unknown to us, while
 living on the plane of our three-dimensional World; as we know
 only the mental states it excites in the perceiving Ego. And,
 so long as the contrast of Subject and Object endures -- to wit,
 as long as we enjoy our five senses and no more, and do not know
 how to divorce our all-perceiving <em>Ego</em> (the Higher Self)
 from the thraldom of these senses -- so long will it be impossible
 for the <em>personal </em>Ego to break through the barrier which
 separates it from a
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Cosmic Ideation focussed in a principle or <em>upadhi</em> (basis)
 results as the consciousness of the individual Ego. Its manifestation
 varies with the degree of <em>upadhi</em>,<em> e.g.</em>,<em>
 </em>through that known as <em>Manas </em>it wells up as Mind-Consciousness;
 through the more finely differentiated fabric (sixth state of
 matter) of the <em>Buddhi </em>resting on the experience of Manas
 as its basis -- as a stream of spiritual INTUITION.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 330 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 knowledge of <em>things in themselves </em>(<em>or Substance</em>)<em>.
 </em>That Ego, progressing in an arc of ascending subjectivity,
 must exhaust the experience of every plane. But not till the Unit
 is merged in the ALL, whether on this or any other plane, and
 Subject and Object alike vanish in the absolute negation of the
 Nirvanic State (negation, again, only <em>from our plane</em>),<em>
 </em>is<em> </em>scaled that peak of Omniscience -- the Knowledge
 of things-in-themselves; and the solution of the yet more awful
 riddle approached, before which even the highest Dhyan Chohan
 must bow in silence and ignorance -- the unspeakable mystery of
 that which is called by the Vedantins, the <strong>P</strong>ARABRAHMAM.
 </p><p>
 Therefore, such being the case, all those who sought to give a
 name to the incognizable Principle have simply degraded it. Even
 to speak of Cosmic Ideation -- save in its <em>phenomenal </em>aspect
 --<em> </em>is like trying to bottle up primordial Chaos, or to
 put a printed label on <strong>E</strong>TERNITY.
 </p><p>
 What, then, is the "primordial Substance," that mysterious
 object of which Alchemy was ever talking, and which became the
 subject of philosophical speculation in every age? What can it
 be finally, even in its phenomenal pre-differentiation? Even <em>that
 </em>is ALL in manifested Nature and -- <em>nothing </em>to our
 senses. It is mentioned under various names in every Cosmogony,
 referred to in every philosophy, and shown to be, to this day,
 the ever grasp-eluding <strong>P</strong>ROTEUS in Nature. We
 touch and do not feel it; we look at it without seeing it; we
 breathe it and do not perceive it; we hear and smell it without
 the smallest cognition that it is there; for it is in every molecule
 of that which in our illusion and ignorance we regard as Matter
 in any of its states, or conceive as a feeling, a thought, an
 emotion. . . . In short, it is the "<em>upadhi</em>,"<em>
 </em>or vehicle, of every possible phenomenon, whether physical,
 mental, or psychic. In the opening sentences of <em>Genesis</em>,<em>
 </em>as in the Chaldean Cosmogony; in the <em>Puranas </em>of
 India, and in the <em>Book of the Dead </em>of Egypt, it opens
 everywhere the cycle of manifestation. It is termed "Chaos,"
 and the face of the waters, incubated by the Spirit proceeding
 from the Unknown, under whatever name. (<em>See </em>"<em>Chaos</em>,<em>
 Theos</em>,<em> Kosmos.</em>")
 </p><p>
 The authors of the sacred Scriptures in India go deeper into the
 origin of things evolved than Thales or Job, for they say: --
 </p><p>
 "From <strong>I</strong>NTELLIGENCE (called <strong>M</strong>AHAT
 in the Puranas) associated with <strong>I</strong>GNORANCE (Iswar,
 as a <em>personal </em>deity)<em> attended by its projective power</em>,<em>
 </em>in which the quality of dulness (<em>tamas</em>,<em> </em>insensibility)
 predominates, proceeds <em>Ether </em>-- from ether, air; from
 air, heat; from heat, water; and from water, earth "with
 everything on it." "From THIS, from this same SELF,
 was the Ether produced," says the Veda. (<em>Taittiriya Upanishad
 II</em>. 1).
 </p><p>
 It becomes thus evident that it is not <em>this </em>Ether --
 sprung at the fourth</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 331 ETHER, AS ITS NOUMENON.</h6>
 
 <p>
 remove from an <em>Emanation </em>of Intelligence "associated
 with Ignorance" -- which is the high principle, the <em>deific
 </em>Entity worshipped by the Greeks and Latins under the name
 of "<em>Pater omnipotens AEther</em>,"<em> </em>and
 "<em>Magnus AEther</em>"<em> </em>in its collective
 aggregates. The septenary gradation, and the innumerable subdivisions
 and differences, made by the ancients between the powers of <em>Ether
 </em>collectively, from its outward fringe of effects, with which
 our Science is so familiar, up to the "Imponderable Substance,"
 once admitted as the "Ether of Space," now about to
 be rejected, has been ever a vexing riddle for every branch of
 knowledge. The mythologists and symbologists of our day, confused
 by this incomprehensible glorification, on the one hand, and degradation
 on the other, of the same deified entity and in the same religious
 systems, are often driven to the most ludicrous mistakes. The
 Church, firm as a rock in each and all of her early errors of
 interpretation, has made of Ether the abode of her Satanic legions.*
 The whole hierarchy of the "Fallen" angels is there;
 the <em>Cosmocratores </em>-- or the "world bearers,"
 (according to Bossuet);<em> Mundi Tenentes</em> --<em> </em>the
 "world holders," as Tertullian calls them; and <em>Mundi
 Domini </em>"world dominations," or rather <em>dominators</em>,<em>
 </em>the <em>Curbati</em>,<em> </em>or "Curved," etc.,
 who thus make of the stars and celestial orbs in their course
 -- Devils!
 </p><p>
 The difference made between the seven states of Ether (itself
 one of the Seven Cosmic principles), while the AEther of the Ancients
 is <em>universal Fire</em>,<em> </em>may be seen in the injunctions
 by Zoroaster and Psellus, respectively. The former said: "Consult
 it only when it is without form or figure," <em>absque forma
 et figura</em>,<em> </em>which means without flames or burning
 coals. "When it has a form -- <em>heed it not</em>,"<em>
 </em>teaches Psellus; "but when it is formless, obey it,
 for it is then <em>sacred fire</em>,<em> </em>and all it will
 reveal thee, shall be true."** This proves that Ether, itself
 an aspect of Akasa, has in its turn several aspects or "principles."
 </p><p>
 All the ancient nations deified AEther in its imponderable aspect
 and potency. Virgil calls Jupiter, <em>Pater omnipotens AEther</em>,<em>
 </em>"the great AEther."*** The Hindus have also placed
 it among their deities; under the name of Akasa (the synthesis
 of AEther). And the author of the <em>Homoiomerian</em> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * For it is thus that the Church has interpreted verse 12 in the
 VI. Chapter to the Ephesians. "For we wrestle not against
 flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
 the rulers of the darkness of this world." Further on St.
 Paul mentions the spiritual <em>malices</em> ("wickedness"
 in English texts) SPREAD IN THE AIR -- "<em>Spiritualia nequitiae
 coelestibus</em>,"<em> </em>the Latin texts giving various
 names to these "malices," the innocent "Elementals."
 But the Church is right this time, though wrong in calling them
 all devils. The ASTRAL LIGHT or lower Ether <em>is </em>full of
 conscious and semi-conscious and unconscious entities; only the
 church has less <em>power </em>over them than over invisible microbes
 or mosquitoes.
 </p><p>
 **<em> Effatum </em><b>XVI</b>. "Oracles of Zoroaster."

 <p>
 System of philosophy, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, firmly believed
 that the spiritual prototypes of all things, as well as their
 elements, were to be found in the boundless Ether where they were
 generated, whence they evolved, and whither they returned -- an
 Occult teaching.
 </p><p>
 It thus becomes clear that it is from Ether in its highest synthetic
 aspect, once anthropomorphised, that sprung the first idea of
 a personal creative deity. With the philosophical Hindus the elements
 are <em>Tamas</em>,<em> i.e.</em>, "unenlightened by <em>intellect</em>,<em>
 </em>which they obscure."
 </p><p>
 We have now to exhaust the question of the mystical meaning of
 "Primordial Chaos" and of the Root-Principle, and show
 how they were connected in the ancient philosophies with Akasa,
 wrongly translated AEther, and also with <em>Maya </em>(illusion)
 -- of which <em>Ishwara </em>is the male aspect. We shall speak
 further on of the <em>intelligent </em>"principle,"
 or rather of the invisible <em>immaterial </em>properties, in
 the visible and material elements, that "sprung from the
 <em>primordial </em>Chaos."
 </p><p>
 For, "What is the primordial Chaos but AEther?" it is
 asked in "ISIS UNVEILED." Not the <em>modern </em>Ether;
 not such as is recognised now, but such as <em>was </em>known
 to the ancient philosophers long before the time of Moses; but
 AEther, with all its mysterious and occult properties, containing
 in itself the germs of universal creation. <em>Upper A</em>Ether
 or Akasa, is the celestial virgin and mother of every existing
 form and being, from whose bosom, as soon as "incubated"
 by the Divine Spirit, are called into existence Matter and Life,
 Force and Action. AEther is the Aditi of the Hindus, and it is
 Akasa. Electricity, magnetism, heat, light, and chemical action
 are so little understood even now that fresh facts are constantly
 widening the range of our knowledge. Who knows where ends the
 power of this protean giant -- AEther; or whence its mysterious
 origin? Who, we mean, that denies the spirit that works in it,
 and evolves out of it all visible forms?
 </p><p>
 It will be an easy task to show that the cosmogonical legends
 all over the world are based on a knowledge by the ancients of
 those sciences, which have allied themselves in our days in support
 of the doctrine of evolution; and that further research may demonstrate
 that those ancients were far better acquainted with the fact of
 evolution itself, embracing both its physical and spiritual aspects,
 than we are now. "With the old philosophers, evolution was
 a universal theorem, a doctrine embracing the <em>whole</em>,<em>
 </em>and an established principle; while our modern evolutionists
 are enabled to present us merely with speculative theoretics;
 with <em>particular</em>,<em> </em>if not wholly <em>negative
 </em>theorems. It is idle for the representatives of our modern
 wisdom to close the debate and pretend that the question is settled,
 merely because the obscure phraseology of the Mosaic, far later,
 account clashes with the definite exegesis of 'Exact Science'"<em>
 </em>("<em>Isis Unveiled</em>")<em>.</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 333 WHAT MANU SAYS OF THIS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 If one turns to the "Laws (or Ordinances) of Manu,"
 one finds the prototype of all these ideas. Mostly lost (to the
 Western world) in their original form, disfigured by later interpolations
 and additions, they have, nevertheless, preserved quite enough
 of their ancient Spirit to show its character. "Removing
 the darkness, the Self-existent Lord" (<em>Vishnu</em>,<em>
 Narayana</em>,<em> etc.</em>)<em> </em>becoming manifest, and
 "wishing to produce beings from his Essence, created, in
 the beginning, water alone. In that he cast seed. . . . . That
 became a golden Egg." (V. 6, 7, 8, 9.) Whence this Self-existent
 Lord? It is called THIS, and is spoken of as "Darkness, imperceptible,
 without definite qualities, undiscoverable as if wholly in sleep."
 (V. 5.) Having dwelt in that Egg for a whole divine year, he "who
 is called in the world Brahma," splits that Egg in two, and
 from the upper portion he forms the heaven, from the lower the
 earth, and from the middle the sky and "the perpetual place
 of waters." (12, 13.)
 </p><p>
 But there is, directly following these verses, something more
 important for us, as it corroborates entirely our esoteric teachings.
 From verse 14 to 36, evolution is given in the order described
 in the Esoteric philosophy. This cannot be easily gainsaid. Even
 Medhatithi, the son of Viraswamin, and the author of the Commentary,
 "the Manubhasya," whose date, according to the western
 Orientalists, is 1,000 A.D., helps us with his remarks to the
 elucidation of the truth. He showed himself either unwilling to
 give out more, because he knew that truth which has to be kept
 from the profane, or else he was really puzzled. Still, what he
 does give out makes the septenary principle in men and nature
 plain enough.
 </p><p>
 Let us begin with Chapter 1. of the "Ordinances" or
 "Laws" after the Self-existent Lord, the <em>unmanifesting
 </em>Logos of the Unknown "Darkness," becomes manifested
 in the golden Egg. It is from this "Egg," from ----
 </p><p>
 (11.) That which is the undiscrete (undifferentiated) cause, eternal,
 which <em>Is and Is not</em>,<em> </em>from It issued that male
 who is called in the world Brahma. . . . .
 </p><p>
 Here we find, as in all genuine philosophical systems, even the
 "Egg" or the Circle (or Zero), boundless Infinity, referred
 to as <strong>I</strong>T,* and Brahma, the first <em>unit </em>only,
 referred to as the <em>male </em>god,<em> i.e.</em>, the fructifying
 Principle. It is <img src="sd1-333.jpg" align="MIDDLE"> or 10
 (ten) the Decade. On the plane of the Septenary <em>or our World
 </em>only, it is called Brahma. On that of the <em>Unified Decade
 </em>in the realm of Reality, this male Brahma is an illusion.
 </p><p>
 (14.) "From Self (<em>atmanah</em>)<em> </em>he created mind,
 (1)<em> which is and is not;</em>

 <p>
 (2) and from mind, Ego-ism (Self-Consciousness) the ruler; (3)
 the Lord."
 </p><p>
 (1.) The mind is <em>Manas. </em>Medhatithi, the commentator,
 justly observes here that it is the reverse of this and shows
 already interpolation and rearranging; for it is <em>Manas </em>that
 springs from <em>Ahamkara </em>or<em> </em>(Universal) Self-Consciousness,
 as <em>Manas </em>in the microcosm springs from Mahat, <em>or
 Maha-Buddhi </em>(Buddhi, in man). For Manas is dual, and as shown
 and translated by Colebrooke, "is <em>serving both for sense
 and action</em>,<em> </em>is an organ by affinity, being cognate
 with the rest." "The rest" means, here, that Manas,
 our <em>fifth</em> principle (the fifth, because the body was
 named the <em>first</em>,<em> </em>which is the reverse of the
 true philosophical order)* is in affinity both with Atma-Buddhi
 and with the lower four principles. Hence, our teaching: namely,
 that Manas follows Atma-Buddhi to Devachan, and that the lower
 (dregs, the residue of) Manas remains with Kama rupa, in <em>Limbus</em>,<em>
 </em>or Kama-loka, the abode of the "Shells."
 </p><p>
 (2.) Such is the meaning of <em>Manas</em>,<em> </em>which<em>
 </em>"<em>is</em>,<em> and is not.</em>"
 </p><p>
 (3.) Medhatithi translates it as "the one conscious of the
 I," or Ego, not "ruler," as the Orientalists do.
 Thus they translate verse 16: "He also, having made the subtile
 parts of those six (the Great Self and the five organs of sense)
 of unmeasured brightness, to enter into the elements of Self (<em>Atmamatrasu</em>)<em>
 </em>created all beings."
 </p><p>
 When, according to Medhatithi, it ought to read <em>matra-Chit
 </em>instead of "Atmamatrasu," and thus be made to say:
 --
 </p><p>
 "He having pervaded the subtile parts of those six, of unmeasured
 brightness, by elements of self, created all beings."
 </p><p>
 This latter reading must be the correct one, since he, the <em>Self</em>,<em>
 </em>is what we call Atma, and thus constitutes the seventh principle,
 the synthesis of the "<em>six.</em>"<em> </em>Such is
 also the opinion of the editor of <em>Manava-dharma Shastra</em>,<em>
 </em>who seems to have intuitionally entered far deeper into the
 spirit of the philosophy than has the translator of the "Ordinances
 of Manu," the late Dr. Burnell. For he hesitates little between
 the text of Kulluka and the Commentaries of Medhatithi. Rejecting
 the <em>tanmatra</em>,<em> </em>or subtile elements, and the <em>atmamatrasu
 </em>of Kulluka, he says, applying the principles to the Cosmic
 <em>Self:</em> "The six appear rather to be the <em>manas
 </em>plus the five principles of Ether, air, fire, water, earth";

 parts (or principles), which reading is borne out by verse 19,
 which says: --

 "19. This non-eternal (Universe) arises then from the Eternal,
 by means of the subtile elements of forms of <em>those seven </em>very
 glorious principles" (<em>purusha</em>)<em>.</em>

 Commenting upon which, according to Medhatithi, the Editor remarks
 that "the five elements plus mind (<em>Manas</em>)<em> </em>and
 Self-Consciousness (Ahamkara)* are meant;" "subtile
 elements," as before (meaning) "five portions of form"
 (or principles). For verse 20 shows it, when saying of these (five
 elements, or "five portions of form" (<em>rupa</em>,<em>
 plus Manas </em>and Self-Consciousness) that they constitute the
 "<em>seven purusha</em>,"<em> </em>or<em> principles</em>,<em>
 </em>called in the Puranas the "Seven Prakritis."
 </p><p>
 Moreover, these "five elements" or "five portions"
 are spoken of in verse 27 as "those which are called the
 atomic destructible portions" -- therefore "distinct
 from the atoms of the <em>nyaya.</em>"

 This creative Brahma, issuing from the mundane or golden egg,
 unites in himself both the male and the female principles. He
 is, in short, the same as all the creative Protologoi. Of Brahma,
 however, it could not be said, as of Dionysos: "[[<em>protogonon
 diphue trigonon Baccheion Hanakta Hagrion arreton kruphion dikerota
 dimorphon</em>]]" --<em> </em>a lunar Jehovah -- Bacchus
 truly, with David dancing nude before his <em>symbol </em>in the
 ark -- because no licentious Dionysia were ever established in
 his name and honour. All such public worship was exoteric, and
 the great universal symbols were distorted universally, as those
 of Krishna are now by the Vallabacharyas of Bombay, the followers
 of the <em>infant </em>god. But are these popular gods the <em>true
 Deity? </em>Are<em> they </em>the Apex and synthesis of the sevenfold
 creation, man included? Never! Each and all are one of the rungs
 of that septenary ladder of Divine Consciousness, pagan as Christian.
 For Ain-Soph also is said to manifest through the <em>Seven Letters
 of Jehovah</em>'<em>s name </em>who, having usurped the place
 of the Unknown Limitless, was given by his devotees his Seven
 Angels of the Presence -- his<em> Seven Principles. </em>Yet they
 are mentioned in almost every school. In the pure Sankhya philosophy
 <em>mahat</em>,<em> ahamkara </em>and the five <em>tanmatras </em>are<em>
 </em>called the <em>seven Prakritis </em>(or Natures), and they
 are counted from <em>Maha-Buddhi </em>or Mahat down to Earth.

 <em>esoteric </em>meaning in the Hebrew scrolls, which is far
 more so than its outward <em>veil</em> or<em> cloaking </em>may
 be* -- once the <em>Jehovistic </em>portions are eliminated, the
 Mosaic books are found full of purely occult and priceless knowledge,
 especially in the first six chapters.
 </p><p>
 Read by the aid of the Kabala one finds a matchless temple of
 occult truths, a well of deeply concealed beauty hidden under
 a structure, the <em>visible </em>architecture of which, its apparent
 symmetry notwithstanding, is unable to stand the criticism of
 cold reason, or to reveal its age, for it belongs to all the ages.
 There is more wisdom concealed under the exoteric <em>fables </em>of
 Puranas and Bible than in all the exoteric <em>facts </em>and
 science in the literature of the world, and more OCCULT true Science,
 than there is of exact knowledge in all the academies. Or, in
 plainer and stronger language, there is as much esoteric wisdom
 in some portions of the<em> exoteric </em>Puranas and Pentateuch,
 as there is of nonsense and of designed childish fancy in it,
 when read only in the dead-letter murderous interpretations of
 great dogmatic religions, and especially of sects.
 </p><p>
 Let anyone read the first verses of chapter i. of <em>Genesis
 </em>and reflect upon them. There "God" commands to
 <em>another </em>"god,"<em> who does his bidding</em>
 -- even in the <em>cautious </em>English Protestant translation
 of James the First's authorised edition.
 </p><p>
 In the "beginning," the Hebrew language having no word
 to express the idea of Eternity,** "God" fashions the
 <em>heaven </em>and the <em>Earth</em>;<em> </em>and the latter
 is "without form and void," while the former is no Heaven
 in fact, but the "Deep," <em>Chaos</em>,<em> </em>with
 darkness upon its face.***
 </p><p>
 "And the <em>Spirit </em>of <b>G</b>OD moved upon the face
 of the Waters" (v. 2), or the great Deep of the Infinite
 Space. And this Spirit is <em>Nara-yana</em>,<em> </em>or Vishnu.

 ** The word "eternity," by which Christian theologians
 interpret the term "for ever and ever," does not exist
 in the Hebrew tongue -- either as a word or meaning. <em>Oulam</em>,
 says Le Clerc, only imports a time when beginning or end is not
 known. It does not mean "<em>infinite</em> duration,"
 and the word <em>for ever </em>in the Old Testament, only signifies
 a "long time." Nor is the term "eternity"
 used in the Christian sense in the Puranas. For in Vishnu Purana,
 it is clearly stated that by Eternity and Immortality only "existence
 to the end of the Kalpa" is meant (Book II. chap. viii.).

 *** Orphic theogony is purely Oriental and Indian in its Spirit.
 The successive transformations it has undergone, have now separated
 it widely from the spirit of ancient Cosmogony, as may be seen
 by comparing it even with Hesiod's theogony. Yet the truly Aryan
 Hindu spirit breaks forth everywhere in both Hesiod's and the
 Orphic theogony. (See the remarkable work of James Darmesteter,
 <em>Cosmogonies Aryennes</em>,<em> </em>in his <em>Essais Orientaux.</em>)<em>
 </em>Thus the original Greek conception of Chaos is that of the
 Secret Wisdom Religion. In Hesiod, therefore, Chaos is infinite,
 boundless, endless and beginningless in duration, an abstraction
 at the same time as a visible presence. <strong>S</strong>PACE
 filled with darkness, which is primordial matter in its <em>precosmic
 </em>state. For in its etymological sense, Chaos is Space, according
 to Aristotle, and Space is <em>the </em>ever Unseen and Unknowable
 Deity in our philosophy. </p><hr>

 "And God said, Let there be a firmament. . ." (v. 6),
 and "God," the second, obeyed and "<em>made </em>the
 firmament" (v. 7). "And God said let there be light,"
 and "there was light." Now the latter does not mean
 light at all, but in the Kabala, the androgyne "Adam Kadmon,"
 or Sephira (<em>Spiritual light</em>),<em> </em>for they are one;
 or, according to the Chaldean "Book of Numbers," the
 <em>secondary </em>angels, the first being the Elohim who are
 the <em>aggregate </em>of that "fashioning" <em>god</em>.
 For to whom are those words of command addressed? And who is it
 who commands? That which commands is the <em>eternal Law</em>,<em>
 </em>and he who obeys, the <em>Elohim</em>,<em> </em>the known
 quantity acting in and with <em>x</em>, or the coefficient of
 the unknown quantity, the <em>Forces </em>of the ONE Force. All
 this is Occultism, and is found in the archaic STANZAS. It is
 perfectly immaterial whether we call these "Forces"
 the Dhyan Chohans, or the <em>Ophanim</em>,<em> </em>as St. John
 does.
 </p><p>
 "The one Universal Light, which to Man is <em>Darkness</em>,<em>
 </em>is ever existent," says the Chaldean "Book of Numbers."
 From it proceeds periodically the <strong>E</strong>NERGY, which
 is reflected in the "Deep" or Chaos, the store-house
 of future worlds, and, once awakened, stirs up and fructifies
 the latent Forces, which are the ever present eternal potentialities
 in it. Then awake anew the Brahmas and Buddhas -- the co-eternal
 Forces -- and a new Universe springs into being. . . . .
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Sepher Jezireh</em>,<em> </em>the Kabalistic Book of
 Creation, the author has evidently repeated the words of Manu.
 In it, the Divine Substance is represented as having alone existed
 from the eternity, boundless and absolute; and as having emitted
 from itself the Spirit.* "One is the Spirit of the living
 God, blessed be <strong>I</strong>TS name, which liveth for ever!
 Voice, Spirit, and Word, this is the Holy Spirit;"** and
 this is the Kabalistic abstract Trinity, so unceremoniously anthropomorphised
 by the Christian Fathers. From this triple <strong>O</strong>NE
 emanated the whole Kosmos. First from <strong>O</strong>NE emanated
 number <strong>T</strong>WO, or Air (the Father), the creative
 element; and then number <strong>T</strong>HREE, <em>Water </em>(the
 Mother), proceeded from the air; <em>Ether </em>or<em> Fire </em>completes
 the mystic four, the Arba-il.*** "When the Concealed of the
 Concealed wanted to reveal Himself, he first made a point (primordial
 point, or the first Sephiroth, air, or Holy Ghost), shaped into
 a sacred form (the ten Sephiroth, or the Heavenly man), and covered
 it with a rich and splendid garment, <em>that is the world.</em>"****

 "He maketh the wind His messengers, flaming Fire His servants,"
 says the Jezireh, showing the cosmical character of the later
 euhemerised Elements,* and that the Spirit permeates every atom
 in Kosmos.
 </p><p>
 This "primordial Substance" is called by some <em>Chaos:
 </em>Plato and the Pythagoreans named it the <em>Soul of the World
 </em>after it had been impregnated by the Spirit of <em>that </em>which
 broods over the Primeval Waters, or <em>Chaos. </em>It is by being
 reflected in it, say the Kabalists, that the brooding Principle
 <em>created </em>the phantasmagoria of a visible, manifested Universe.
 <em>Chaos</em>,<em> </em>before -- Ether, after, the "reflection;"
 it is still the deity that pervades all Space and things. It is
 the invisible, imponderable Spirit of things and the invisible,
 but too tangible fluid that radiates from the fingers of the healthy

 itself. Called in derision by the Marquis de Mirville "the

 to this day "the living Fire"; and there is not a Hindu
 who practises at dawn a certain kind of meditation but knows its
 effects.** It is the "Spirit of

 * "Sepher Jezireh," Mishna ix., 10. Everywhere throughout
 the Acts, Paul calls the invisible Kosmic Beings the "Elements."
 (<em>See Greek Texts.</em>) But now the Elements are degraded
 into and limited to atoms of which nothing is known, so far, and
 which are only "children of necessity" as Ether is too
 --
 </p><p>
 as we said in "<strong>I</strong>SIS." "The poor
 primordial elements have long been exiled, and our ambitious physicists
 run races to determine who shall add one more to the fledgling
 brood of the sixty and odd elementary substances." Meanwhile
 there rages a war in modern chemistry about terms. We are denied
 the right to call these substances "chemical elements,"
 for they are not "primordial principles of self-existing
 essences out of which the universe was fashioned," according
 to Plato. Such ideas associated with the word <em>element </em>were
 good enough for the "old Greek philosophy," but modern
 science rejects them; for, as Professor Crookes says, "they
 are unfortunate terms," and experimental science will have
 "nothing to do with any kind of essences except those which
 it can see, smell, or taste. It leaves others to the metaphysicians.

 <em>Magus </em>and <em>magnes </em>are two branches growing from
 the same trunk and shooting forth the same resultants. And in
 this appellation of "living fire" we may also discover
 the meaning of the puzzling sentence in the <em>Zend-Avesta </em>saying
 that there is "a fire that gives knowledge of the future.
 Science and amiable speech," <em>i.e.</em>, develops an extraordinary
 eloquence in the sybil, the sensitive, and even some orators.
 </p><p>
 This "fire" is spoken of in all the Hindu Books, as
 also in the Kabalistic works. The <em>Zohar </em>explains it as
 the "white hidden fire, in the<em> Resha trivrah</em>"<em>
 </em>(the White Head), whose Will causes the fiery fluid to flow
 in 370 currents in every direction of the universe. It is identical
 with the "Serpent that runs with 370 leaps" of the <em>Siphrah
 Dzenioota</em>,<em> </em>which, when the "Perfect Man,"
 the Metatron, <em>is raised</em>,<em> i.e.</em>,<em> </em>when
 the <em>divine </em>man indwells in the <em>animal </em>man, it,
 the Serpent, becomes <em>three spirits</em>,<em> </em>that is
 to say, is Atma-Buddhi-Manas, in our theosophical phraseology.

 </p><p>
 Spirit, then, or Cosmic Ideation, and Cosmic Substance -- one
 of whose<em> principles </em>is Ether -- are <em>one</em>,<em>
 </em>and include the ELEMENTS, in the sense St. Paul attaches
 to them. These Elements are the veiled Synthesis standing for
 Dhyan Chohans, Devas, Sephiroth, Amshaspends, Archangels, etc.,
 etc. The Ether of science -- the <em>Ilus </em>of Berosus, or
 the <em>Protyle </em>of Chemistry -- constitutes, so to speak,
 the <em>rude</em> material (relatively) out of which the above-named
 "Builders," following the plan traced out for them eternally
 in the DIVINE THOUGHT, fashion the systems in the Cosmos. They
 are "myths," we are told. "No more so than Ether
 and the Atoms," we answer. The two latter are <em>absolute
 </em>necessities of physical science; the "Builders"
 are as absolute a necessity of metaphysics. We are twitted with:
 "You <em>never saw them.</em>"<em> </em>We ask the materialists:
 "Have you ever seen Ether, <em>or your Atoms</em>,<em> </em>or,
 again, your FORCE?" Moreover, one of the greatest Western
 Evolutionists of our modern day, the coadjutor of Darwin, Mr.
 A. R. Wallace, when discussing the inadequacy of Natural Selection
 alone to account for the physical form of Man, admits the guiding
 action of "higher intelligences" as a "<em>necessary
 </em>part of the great laws which govern the material Universe"
 ("<em>Contributions to Theory of Natural Selection</em>")<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 These "higher intelligences" are the Dhyan Chohans of
 the <em>Occultists.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Indeed, there are few Myths in any religious system worthy of
 the name, but have an <em>historical </em>as well as a <em>scientific
 </em>foundation. "Myths," justly observes Pococke, "are
 now proved to be fables, <em>just in proportion as we misunderstand
 </em>them;<em> truths</em>,<em> </em>in proportion as <em>they
 were once understood.</em>"
 </p><p>
 The one prevailing, most distinct idea -- found in all ancient
 teaching,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 340 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 with reference to Cosmic Evolution and the first "creation"
 of our Globe with all its products, organic and <em>inorganic
 </em>(strange word for an Occultist to use) -- is that the whole
 Kosmos has sprung from the DIVINE THOUGHT. This thought impregnates
 matter, which is co-eternal with the ONE REALITY; and all that
 lives and breathes evolves from the emanations of the ONE <em>Immutable
 </em>-- Parabrahm = Mulaprakriti, the eternal one-root. The former
 of these is, so to say, the aspect of the central point turned
 inward into regions quite inaccessible to human intellect, and
 is absolute abstraction; whereas, in its aspect as <em>Mulaprakriti</em>
 --<em> </em>the eternal root of all, -- it gives one some hazy
 comprehension at least of the Mystery of Being.
 </p><blockquote>
 "Therefore, it was taught in the <i>inner</i> temples that
 this visible universe of spirit and matter is but the concrete
 image of the ideal abstraction; it was built on the model of the
 first DIVINE IDEA. Thus our universe existed from Eternity in
 a latent state. The soul animating this purely spiritual universe
 is the central sun, the highest deity itself. It was not the <i>One</i>
 who built the concrete form of the idea, but the first-begotten;
 and as it was constructed on the geometrical figure of the dodecahedron,*
 the first-begotten 'was pleased to employ twelve thousand years
 in its creation.' The latter number is expressed in the Tyrrhenian
 cosmogony,** which shows man created in the sixth millennium.
 This agrees with the Egyptian theory of 6,000 'years'*** and with
 the Hebrew computation. But it is the exoteric form of it. The
 <i>secret </i>computation explains that the 'twelve thousand and
 the 6,000 years' are YEARS OF <strong>B</strong>RAHMA -- one <i>day</i>
 of Brahma being equal to 4,320,000,000 years. Sanchoniathon****
 in his <i>Cosmogony</i>,<i> </i>declares that when the wind (spirit)
 became enamoured of its own principles (the chaos), an intimate
 union took place, which connection was called <i>pothos</i>,<i>
 </i>and from this sprang the seed of all. And the chaos knew not
 its own production, for it was <i>senseless; </i>but from its
 embrace with the wind was generated Mot, or the ilus (mud).*****
 From this proceeded the spores of creation and the generation
 of the universe.

 water again; Mithras,****** the rock-born god, the symbol of the

 The fragments of the systems that have now reached us are rejected
 as absurd fables. Nevertheless, occult Science -- having survived
 even the great Flood that submersed the antediluvian giants and
 with them their very memory, save in the Secret Doctrine, the
 Bible and other Scriptures -- still holds the Key to all the world
 problems.
 </p><p>
 Let us apply that Key to the rare fragments of long-forgotten
 cosmogonies and try by their scattered parts to re-establish the
 once Universal Cosmogony of the Secret Doctrine. The Key fits
 them all. No one can study ancient philosophies seriously without
 perceiving that the striking similitude of conception between
 all -- in their exoteric form very often, in their hidden spirit
 invariably -- is the result of no mere coincidence, but of a concurrent
 design: and that there was, during the youth of mankind, one languages,
 one knowledge, one universal religion, when there were no churches,
 no creeds or sects, but when every man was a priest unto himself.
 And, if it is shown that already in those ages which are shut
 out from our sight by the exuberant growth of tradition, human
 religious thought developed in uniform sympathy in every portion
 of the globe; then, it becomes evident that, born under whatever
 latitude, in the cold North or the burning South, in the East
 or West, that thought was inspired by the same revelations, and
 man was nurtured under the protecting shadow of the same TREE
 OF KNOWLEDGE.
