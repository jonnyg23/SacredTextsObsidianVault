 PAGES FROM A PRE-HISTORIC PERIOD.
 </p><p>
 <strong>A</strong>N Archaic Manuscript -- a collection of palm
 leaves made impermeable to water, fire, and air, by some specific
 unknown process -- is before the writer's eye. On the first page
 is an immaculate white disk within a dull black ground. On the
 following page, the same disk, but with a central point. The first,
 the student knows to represent Kosmos in Eternity, before the
 re-awakening of still slumbering Energy, the emanation of the
 Word in later systems. The point in the hitherto immaculate Disk,
 Space and Eternity in Pralaya, denotes the dawn of differentiation.
 It is the Point in the Mundane Egg (see Part II., "The Mundane
 Egg"), the germ within the latter which will become the Universe,
 the ALL, the boundless, periodical Kosmos, this germ being latent
 and active, periodically and by turns. The one circle is divine
 Unity, from which all proceeds, whither all returns. Its circumference
 -- a forcibly limited symbol, in view of the limitation of the
 human mind -- indicates the abstract, ever incognisable PRESENCE,
 and its plane, the Universal Soul, although the two are one. Only
 the face of the Disk being white and the ground all around black,
 shows clearly that its plane is the only knowledge, dim and hazy
 though it still is, that is attainable by man. It is on this plane
 that the Manvantaric manifestations begin; for it is in this SOUL
 that slumbers, during the Pralaya, the Divine Thought,* wherein
 lies concealed the plan of every future Cosmogony and Theogony.

 * It is hardly necessary to remind the reader once more that the
 term "Divine Thought," like that of "Universal
 Mind," must not be regarded as even vaguely shadowing forth
 an intellectual process akin to that exhibited by man. The "Unconscious,"
 according to von Hartmann, arrived at the vast creative, or rather
 Evolutionary Plan, "by a clairvoyant wisdom superior to all
 consciousness," which in the Vedantic language would mean
 absolute Wisdom. Only those who realise how far Intuition soars
 above the tardy processes of ratiocinative thought can form the
 faintest conception of [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>

 <p>
 It is the ONE LIFE, eternal, invisible, yet Omnipresent, without
 beginning or end, yet periodical in its regular manifestations,
 between which periods reigns the dark mystery of non-Being; unconscious,
 yet absolute Consciousness; unrealisable, yet the one self-existing
 reality; truly, "a chaos to the sense, a Kosmos to the reason."
 Its one absolute attribute, which is ITSELF, eternal, ceaseless
 Motion, is called in esoteric parlance the "Great Breath,"*
 which is the perpetual motion of the universe, in the sense of
 limitless, ever-present SPACE. That which is motionless cannot
 be Divine. But then there is nothing in fact and reality absolutely
 motionless within the universal soul.
 </p><p>
 Almost five centuries B.C. Leucippus, the instructor of Democritus,
 maintained that Space was filled eternally with atoms actuated
 by a ceaseless motion, the latter generating in due course of
 time, when those atoms aggregated, rotatory motion, through mutual
 collisions producing lateral movements. Epicurus and Lucretius
 taught the same, only adding to the lateral motion of the atoms
 the idea of affinity -- an occult teaching.
 </p><p>
 From the beginning of man's inheritance, from the first appearance
 of the architects of the globe he lives in, the unrevealed Deity
 was recognised and considered under its only philosophical aspect
 -- universal motion, the thrill of the creative Breath in Nature.
 Occultism sums up the "One Existence" thus: "Deity
 is an arcane, living (or moving) FIRE, and the eternal witnesses
 to this unseen Presence are Light, Heat, Moisture," -- this
 trinity including, and being the cause of, every

 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] that absolute Wisdom
 which transcends the ideas of Time and Space. Mind, as we know
 it, is resolvable into states of consciousness, of varying duration,
 intensity, complexity, etc. -- all, in the ultimate, resting on
 sensation, which is again Maya. Sensation, again, necessarily
 postulates limitation. The personal God of orthodox Theism perceives,
 thinks, and is affected by emotion; he repents and feels "fierce
 anger." But the notion of such mental states clearly involves
 the unthinkable postulate of the externality of the exciting stimuli,
 to say nothing of the impossibility of ascribing changelessness
 to a Being whose emotions fluctuate with events in the worlds
 he presides over. The conceptions of a Personal God as changeless
 and infinite are thus unpsychological and, what is worse, unphilosophical.
 </p><p>
 * Plato proves himself an Initiate, when saying in Cratylus that
 [[<em>theos</em>]] is derived from the verb [[<em>theein</em>]],
 "to move," "to run," as the first astronomers
 who observed the motions of the heavenly bodies called the planets
 [[<em>theoi</em>]], the gods. (See Book II., "Symbolism of
 the Cross and Circle.") Later, the word produced another
 term, [[<em>aletheia</em>]] -- "the breath of God."

 phenomenon in Nature.* Intra-Cosmic motion is eternal and ceaseless;
 cosmic motion (the visible, or that which is subject to perception)
 is finite and periodical. As an eternal abstraction it is the
 EVER-PRESENT; as a manifestation, it is finite both in the coming
 direction and the opposite, the two being the alpha and omega
 of successive reconstructions. Kosmos -- the NOUMENON -- has nought
 to do with the causal relations of the phenomenal World. It is
 only with reference to the intra-cosmic soul, the ideal Kosmos
 in the immutable Divine Thought, that we may say: "It never
 had a beginning nor will it have an end." With regard to
 its body or Cosmic organization, though it cannot be said that
 it had a first, or will ever have a last construction, yet at
 each new Manvantara, its organization may be regarded as the first
 and the last of its kind, as it evolutes every time on a higher
 plane . . . .

 A few years ago only, it was stated that: --

 "The esoteric doctrine teaches, like Buddhism and Brahminism,
 and even the Kabala, that the one infinite and unknown Essence
 exists from all eternity, and in regular and harmonious successions
 is either passive or active. In the poetical phraseology of Manu
 these conditions are called the "Days" and the "Nights"
 of Brahma. The latter is either "awake" or "asleep."
 The Svabhavikas, or philosophers of the oldest school of Buddhism
 (which still exists in Nepaul), speculate only upon the active
 condition of this "Essence," which they call Svabhavat,
 and deem it foolish to theorise upon the abstract and "unknowable"
 power in its passive condition. Hence they are called atheists
 by both Christian theologians and modern scientists, for neither

 * Nominalists, arguing with Berkeley that "it is impossible
 . . . to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body
 moving" ("<em>Prin. of Human Knowledge,</em>"<em>
 Introd</em>.,<em> par. </em>10), may put the question, "What
 is that body, the producer of that motion? Is it a substance?
 Then you are believers in a Personal God?" etc., etc. This
 will be answered farther on, in the Addendum to this Book; meanwhile,
 we claim our rights of Conceptionalists as against Roscelini's
 materialistic views of Realism and Nominalism. "Has science,"
 says one of its ablest advocates, Edward Clodd, "revealed
 anything that weakens or opposes itself to the ancient words in
 which the Essence of all religion, past, present, and to come,
 is given; to do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly before thy
 God?" Provided we connote by the word God, <em>not the crude
 anthropomorphism which is still the backbone of our current theology,
 but the symbolic conception of that which is Life and Motion of
 the Universe</em>, to know which in physical order is to know
 time past, present, and to come, in the existence of successions
 of phenomena; to know which, in the moral, is to know what has
 been, is, and will be, within human consciousness. (<em>See </em>"<em>Science
 and the Emotions.</em>"<em> A Discourse delivered at South
 Place Chapel, Finsbury, London, Dec. </em>27<em>th, </em>1885.)

 two are able to understand the profound logic of their philosophy.
 The former will allow of no other God than the personified secondary
 powers which have worked out the visible universe, and which became
 with them the anthropomorphic God of the Christians -- the male
 Jehovah, roaring amid thunder and lightning. In its turn, rationalistic
 science greets the Buddhists and the Svabhavikas as the "positivists"
 of the archaic ages. If we take a one-sided view of the philosophy
 of the latter, our materialists may be right in their own way.
 The Buddhists maintained that there is no Creator, but an infinitude
 of creative powers, which collectively form the one eternal substance,
 the essence of which is inscrutable -- hence not a subject for
 speculation for any true philosopher. Socrates invariably refused
 to argue upon the mystery of universal being, yet no one would
 ever have thought of charging him with atheism, except those who
 were bent upon his destruction. Upon inaugurating an active period,
 says the Secret Doctrine, an expansion of this Divine essence
 from without inwardly and from within outwardly, occurs in obedience
 to eternal and immutable law, and the phenomenal or visible universe
 is the ultimate result of the long chain of cosmical forces thus
 progressively set in motion. In like manner, when the passive
 condition is resumed, a contraction of the Divine essence takes
 place, and the previous work of creation is gradually and progressively
 undone. The visible universe becomes disintegrated, its material
 dispersed; and 'darkness' solitary and alone, broods once more
 over the face of the 'deep.' To use a Metaphor from the Secret
 Books, which will convey the idea still more clearly, an out-breathing
 of the 'unknown essence' produces the world; and an inhalation
 causes it to disappear. This process has been going on from all
 eternity, and our present universe is but one of an infinite series,
 which had no beginning and will have no end." -- (<em>See
 </em>"<em>Isis Unveiled</em>"<em>; also </em>"<em>The
 Days and Nights of Brahma</em>"<em> in Part II.</em>)
 </p><p>
 This passage will be explained, as far as it is possible, in the
 present work. Though, as it now stands, it contains nothing new
 to the Orientalist, its esoteric interpretation may contain a
 good deal which has hitherto remained entirely unknown to the
 Western student.
 </p><p>
 The first illustration being a plain disc <img src="sd1-4a.jpg" align="MIDDLE">
 the second one in the Archaic symbol shows <img src="sd1-4b.jpg" align="MIDDLE">,
 a disc with a point in it -- the first differentiation in the
 periodical manifestations of the ever-eternal nature, sexless
 and infinite "Aditi in THAT" (Rig Veda), the point in
 the disc, or potential Space within abstract Space. In its third
 stage the point is transformed into a diameter, thus <img src="sd1-4c.jpg" align="MIDDLE">
 It now symbolises a divine immaculate Mother-Nature within the
 all-embracing absolute Infinitude.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 5 PROEM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 When the diameter line is crossed by a vertical one <img src="sd1-5a.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,
 it becomes the mundane cross. Humanity has reached its third root-race;
 it is the sign for the origin of human life to begin. When the
 circumference disappears and leaves only the <img src="sd1-5b.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 it is a sign that the fall of man into matter is accomplished,
 and the FOURTH race begins. The Cross within a circle symbolises
 pure Pantheism; when the Cross was left uninscribed, it became
 phallic. It had the same and yet other meanings as a TAU inscribed
 within a circle <img src="sd1-5c.jpg" align="MIDDLE"> or as a
 "Thor's hammer," the Jaina cross, so-called, or simply
 Svastica within a circle <img src="sd1-5d.jpg" align="MIDDLE">
 
 </p><p>
 By the third symbol -- the circle divided in two by the horizontal
 line of the diameter -- the first manifestation of creative (still
 passive, because feminine) Nature was meant. The first shadowy
 perception of man connected with procreation is feminine, because
 man knows his mother more than his father. Hence female deities
 were more sacred than the male. Nature is therefore feminine,
 and, to a degree, objective and tangible, and the spirit Principle
 which fructifies it is concealed. By adding to the circle with
 the horizontal line in it, a perpendicular line, the tau was formed
 -- -- <img src="sd1-5e.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> -- the oldest form
 of the letter. It was the glyph of the third root-race to the
 day of its symbolical Fall -- <em>i.e.</em>, when the separation
 of sexes by natural evolution took place -- when the figure became
 <img src="sd1-5f.jpg" align="MIDDLE">, the circle, or sexless
 life modified or separated -- a double glyph or symbol. With the
 races of our Fifth Race it became in symbology the sacr', and
 in Hebrew n'cabvah, of the first-formed races;* then it changed
 into the Egyptian <img src="sd1-5g.jpg" align="MIDDLE"> (emblem
 of life), and still later into the sign of Venus, <img src="sd1-5h.jpg" align="MIDDLE">
 Then comes the Svastica (Thor's hammer, or the "Hermetic
 Cross" now), entirely separated from its Circle, thus becoming
 purely phallic. The esoteric symbol of Kali Yuga is the five-pointed
 star reversed, thus <img src="sd1-5i.gif" align="MIDDLE"> -- the
 sign of human sorcery, with its two points (horns) turned heavenward,

 Occultist will recognise as one of the "left-hand,"
 and used in ceremonial magic.*
 </p><p>
 It is hoped that during the perusal of this work the erroneous
 ideas of the public in general with regard to Pantheism will be
 modified. It is wrong and unjust to regard the Buddhists and Advaitee
 Occultists as atheists. If not all of them philosophers, they
 are, at any rate, all logicians, their objections and arguments
 being based on strict reasoning. Indeed, if the Parabrahmam of
 the Hindus may be taken as a representative of the hidden and
 nameless deities of other nations, this absolute Principle will
 be found to be the prototype from which all the others were copied.
 Parabrahm is not "God," because It is not a God. "It
 is that which is supreme, and not supreme (paravara)," explains
 Mandukya Upanishad (2.28). IT is "Supreme" as CAUSE,
 not supreme as effect. Parabrahm is simply, as a "Secondless
 Reality," the all-inclusive Kosmos -- or, rather, the infinite
 Cosmic Space -- in the highest spiritual sense, of course. Brahma
 (neuter) being the unchanging, pure, free, undecaying supreme
 Root, "the ONE true Existence, Paramarthika," and the
 absolute Chit and Chaitanya (intelligence, consciousness) cannot
 be a cogniser, "for THAT can have no subject of cognition."
 Can the flame be called the essence of Fire? This Essence is "the
 LIFE and LIGHT of the Universe, the visible fire and flame are
 destruction, death, and evil." "Fire and Flame destroy
 the body of an Arhat, their essence makes him immortal."
 (<em>Bodhi-mur, Book II.</em>)<em> </em>"The knowledge of
 the absolute Spirit, like the effulgence of the sun, or like heat
 in fire, is naught else than the absolute Essence itself,"
 says Sankaracharya.<strong> IT</strong> -- is "the Spirit
 of the Fire," not fire itself; therefore, "the attributes
 of the latter, heat or flame, are not the attributes of the Spirit,
 but of that of which that Spirit is the unconscious cause."
 Is not the above sentence the true key-note of later Rosicrucian

 <p>
 * We are told by the Western mathematicians and some American
 Kabalists, that in the Kabala also "the value of the Jehovah
 name is that of the diameter of a circle." Add to this the
 fact that Jehovah is the third Sephiroth, <em>Binah, </em>a feminine
 word, and you have the key to the mystery. By certain Kabalistic
 transformations this name, <em>androgynous </em>in the first chapters
 of Genesis, becomes in its transformations entirely masculine,
 Cainite and phallic. The fact of choosing a deity among the pagan
 gods and making of it a special national God, to call upon it
 as the "One living God," the "God of Gods,"
 and then proclaim this worship Monotheistic, does not change it
 into the ONE Principle whose "Unity admits not of multiplication,
 change, or form," especially in the case of a priapic deity,
 as Jehovah now demonstrated to be.</p><hr>

 <p>
 philosophy? Parabrahm is, in short, the collective aggregate of
 Kosmos in its infinity and eternity, the "THAT" and
 "THIS" to which distributive aggregates can not be applied.*
 "In the beginning THIS was the Self, one only"<em> </em>(<em>Aitareya
 Upanishad</em><i>)</i><em>; </em>the great Sankaracharya, explains
 that "THIS" referred to the Universe (Jagat); the sense
 of the words, "In the beginning," meaning before the
 reproduction of the phenomenal Universe.
 </p><p>
 Therefore, when the Pantheists echo the Upanishads, which state,
 as in the Secret Doctrine, that "this" cannot create,
 they do not deny a Creator, or rather a <em>collective aggregate
 </em>of creators, but only refuse, very logically, to attribute
 "creation" and especially formation, something finite
 to an Infinite Principle. With them, Parabrahmam is a passive
 because an Absolute Cause, the unconditioned <em>Mukta. </em>It
 is only limited Omniscience and Omnipotence that are refused to
 the latter, because these are still attributes (as reflected in
 man's perceptions); and because Parabrahm, being the "Supreme
 ALL," the ever invisible spirit and Soul of Nature, changeless
 and eternal, can have no attributes; absoluteness very naturally
 precluding any idea of the finite or conditioned from being connected
 with it. And if the Vedantin postulates attributes as belonging
 simply to its emanation, calling it "Iswara <em>plus </em>Maya,"
 and Avidya (Agnosticism and Nescience rather than ignorance),
 it is difficult to find any Atheism in this conception.** Since
 there can be neither two INFINITES nor two ABSOLUTES in a Universe
 supposed to be Boundless, this Self-Existence can hardly be conceived
 of as creating personally. In the sense and perceptions of finite
 "Beings," THAT is Non-"being," in the sense
 that it is the one BE-NESS; for, in this ALL lies concealed its
 coeternal and coeval emanation or inherent radiation, which, upon
 becoming periodically Brahma (the male-female Potency) becomes
 or expands itself into the manifested Universe. Narayana moving
 on the (abstract) waters of Space, is transformed into the Waters
 of concrete substance moved by him, who now becomes the manifested
 WORD or Logos.

 "The Aphorisms of S'andilya," translated by Cowell,

 </p><p>
 ** Nevertheless, prejudiced and rather fanatical Christian Orientalists
 would like to prove this pure Atheism. For proof of this, see
 about Major Jacob's "Vedanta Sara." Yet, the whole Antiquity
 echoes this Vedantic thought: --

 <p>
 The orthodox Brahmins, those who rise the most against the Pantheists
 and Adwaitees, calling them Atheists, are forced, if Manu has
 any authority in this matter, to accept the death of Brahma, the
 creator, at the expiration of every "Age" of this (creative)
 deity (100 Divine years -- a period which in our years requires
 fifteen figures to express it). Yet, no philosopher among them
 will view this "death" in any other sense than as a
 temporary disappearance from the manifested plane of existence,
 or as a periodical rest.
 </p><p>
 The Occultists are, therefore, at one with the Adwaita Vedantin
 philosophers as to the above tenet. They show the impossibility
 of accepting on philosophical grounds the idea of the absolute
 ALL creating or even evolving the "Golden Egg," into
 which it is said to enter in order to transform itself into Brahma
 -- the Creator, who expands himself later into gods and all the
 visible Universe. They say that Absolute Unity cannot pass to
 infinity; for infinity presupposes the limitless extension of
 <em>something, </em>and the duration of that "something";
 and the One All is like Space -- which is its only mental and
 physical representation on this Earth, or our plane of existence
 -- neither an object of, nor a subject to, perception. If one
 could suppose the Eternal Infinite All, the Omnipresent Unity,
 instead of being in Eternity, becoming through periodical manifestation
 a manifold Universe or a multiple personality, that Unity would
 cease to be one. Locke's idea that "pure Space is capable
 of neither resistance nor Motion" -- is incorrect. Space
 is neither a "limitless void," nor a "conditioned
 fulness," but both: being, on the plane of absolute abstraction,
 the ever-incognisable Deity, which is void only to finite minds,*
 and on that of <em>mayavic </em>perception, the Plenum, the absolute
 Container of all that is, whether manifested or unmanifested:
 it is, therefore, that ABSOLUTE ALL. There is no difference between
 the Christian Apostle's "In Him we live and move and have
 our being," and the Hindu Rishi's "The Universe lives

 * The very names of the two chief deities, Brahma and Vishnu,
 ought to have long ago suggested their esoteric meanings. For
 the root of one, Brahmam, or Brahm, is derived by some from the
 word Brih, "to grow" or "to expand" (see <em>Calcutta
 Review, </em>vol. lxvi., p. 14); and of the other, Vishnu, from
 the root Vis, "to pervade," to enter in the nature of
 the essence; Brahma-Vishnu being this infinite SPACE, of which
 the gods, the Rishis, the Manus, and all in this universe are
 simply the potencies, Vibhutayah.</p><hr>

 is that Universe <em>in abscondito, </em>and Brahma, the manifested,
 is the Logos, made male-female* in the symbolical orthodox dogmas.
 The God of the Apostle-Initiate and of the Rishi being both the
 Unseen and the Visible SPACE. Space is called in the esoteric
 symbolism "the Seven-Skinned Eternal Mother-Father."
 It is composed from its undifferentiated to its differentiated
 surface of seven layers.

 "What is that which was, is, and will be, whether there is
 a Universe or not; whether there be gods or none?" asks the
 esoteric Senzar Catechism. And the answer made is -- SPACE.

 It is not the One Unknown ever-present God in Nature, or Nature
 <em>in abscondito, </em>that is rejected, but the God of human
 dogma and his <em>humanized </em>"Word." In his infinite
 conceit and inherent pride and vanity, man shaped it himself with
 his sacrilegious hand out of the material he found in his own
 small brain-fabric, and forced it upon mankind as a direct revelation
 from the one unrevealed SPACE.** The Occultist

 ** Occultism is indeed in the air at the close of this our century.
 Among many other works recently published, we would recommend
 one especially to students of theoretical Occultism who would
 not venture beyond the realm of our special human plane. It is
 called "New Aspects of Life and Religion," by Henry
 Pratt, M.D. It is full of esoteric dogmas and philosophy, the
 latter rather limited, in the concluding chapters, by what seems
 to be a spirit of conditioned positivism. Nevertheless, what is
 said of Space as "the Unknown First Cause," merits quotation.
 "This unknown something, thus recognised as, and identified
 with, the primary embodiment of Simple Unity, is invisible and
 impalpable" -- (<em>abstract </em>space, granted); "and
 because invisible and impalpable, therefore incognisable. And
 this incognisability has led to the error of supposing it to be
 a simple void, a mere receptive capacity. But, even viewed as
 an absolute void, space must be admitted to be either Self-existent,
 infinite, and eternal, or to have had a first cause outside, behind,
 and beyond itself.
 </p><p>
 "And yet could such a cause be found and defined, this would
 only lead to the transferring thereto of the attributes otherwise
 accruing to space, and thus merely throw the difficulty of origination
 a step farther back, without gaining additional light as to primary
 causation." (p. 5.)
 </p><p>
 This is precisely what has been done by the believers in an anthropomorphic
 Creator, an extracosmic, instead of an intracosmic God. Many --
 most of Mr. Pratt's subjects, we may say -- are old Kabalistic
 ideas and theories which he presents in quite a new garb: "New
 Aspects" of the Occult in Nature, indeed. Space, however,
 viewed as a "Substantial Unity" -- the "living
 Source of Life" -- is as the "Un- [[Footnote continued

 accepts revelation as coming from divine yet still finite Beings,
 the manifested lives, never from the Unmanifestable ONE LIFE;
 from those entities, called Primordial Man, Dhyani-Buddhas, or
 Dhyan-Chohans, the "Rishi-Prajapati" of the Hindus,
 the Elohim or "Sons of God," the Planetary Spirits of
 all nations, who have become Gods for men. He also regards the
 Adi-Sakti -- the direct emanation of Mulaprakriti, the eternal
 Root of THAT, and the female aspect of the Creative Cause Brahma,
 in her A'kasic form of the Universal Soul -- as philosophically
 a Maya, and cause of human Maya. But this view does not prevent
 him from believing in its existence so long as it lasts, to wit,
 for one Mahamanvantara; nor from applying Akasa, the radiation
 of Mulaprakriti,* to practical purposes, connected as the World-Soul
 is with all natural phenomena, known or unknown to science.
 </p><p>
 The oldest religions of the world -- exoterically, for the esoteric
 root or foundation is one -- are the Indian, the Mazdean, and
 the Egyptian. Then comes the Chaldean, the outcome of these --
 entirely lost to the world now, except in its disfigured Sabeanism
 as at present rendered by the archaeologists; then, passing over
 a number of religions that will be mentioned later, comes the
 Jewish, esoterically, as in the Kabala, following in the line
 of Babylonian Magism; exoterically, as in Genesis and the Pentateuch,
 a collection of allegorical legends. Read by the light of the
 Zohar, the initial four chapters of Genesis are the fragment

 is the oldest dogma in Occultism, millenniums earlier than the<em>
 Pater-AEther </em>of the Greeks and Latins. So are the "Force
 and Matter, as Potencies of Space, inseparable, and the Unknown
 revealers of the Unknown." They are all found in Aryan philosophy
 personified by Visvakarman, Indra, Vishnu, etc., etc. Still they
 are expressed very philosophically, and under many unusual aspects,
 in the work referred to.

 * In contradistinction to the manifested universe of matter, the
 term <em>Mulaprakriti </em>(from <em>Mula</em>, "the root,"
 and <em>prakriti</em>,<em> </em>"nature"), or the unmanifested
 primordial matter -- called by Western alchemists Adam's Earth
 -- is applied by the Vedantins to <em>Parabrahmam. </em>Matter
 is dual in religious metaphysics, and septenary in esoteric teachings,
 like everything else in the universe. As <em>Mulaprakriti, </em>it
 is undifferentiated and eternal; as Vyakta, it becomes differentiated
 and conditioned, according to <em>Svetasvatara Upanishad</em>,
 <i>I</i>.<em> </em>8, and <em>Devi Bhagavata Purana. </em>The
 author of the Four Lectures on the Bhagavad Gita, says, in speaking
 of <em>Mulaprakriti: </em>"From its (the Logos') objective
 standpoint, <em>Parabrahmam </em>appears to it as <em>Mulaprakriti</em>.
 . . . Of course this <em>Mulaprakriti </em>is material to it,
 as any material object is material to us. . . . <em>Parabrahmam
 </em>is an unconditioned and absolute reality, and <em>Mulaprakriti
 </em>is a sort of veil thrown over it." (<em>Theosophist</em>,<em>

 The Occult Catechism contains the following questions and answers:

 the eternal Anupadaka.</em>"<em>* </em>"<em>What is
 it that ever was?</em>"<em> </em>"<em>The Germ in the

 </em>"<em>Then, there are three Eternals?</em>"<em>
 </em>"<em>No, the three are one. That which ever is is one,
 that which ever was is one, that which is ever being and becoming

 everywhere during those periods; it is the Vertical and the Horizontal,
 the Father and the Mother, the summit and base of the Father,
 the two extremities of the Mother, reaching in reality nowhere,

 ** Esoteric philosophy, regarding as Maya (or the illusion of
 ignorance) every finite thing, must necessarily view in the same
 light every intra-Cosmic planet and body, as being something organised,
 hence finite. The expression, therefore, "it proceeds from
 without inwardly, etc." refers in the first portion of the
 sentence to the dawn of the Mahamanvantaric period, or the great
 re-evolution after one of the complete periodical dissolutions
 of every compound form in Nature (from planet to molecule) into
 its ultimate essence or element; and in its second portion, to
 the partial or local manvantara, which may be a solar or even
 a planetary one.

 of a planet, is accomplished by that force which is designated

 is cool; but during Evolution and Manwantara her garment is cold
 and radiant. Hot Breath is the Father who devours the progeny

 For clearer understanding on the part of the general reader, it
 must be stated that Occult Science recognises <i>Seven </i>Cosmical
 Elements -- four entirely physical, and the fifth (Ether) semi-material,
 as it will become visible in the air towards the end of our Fourth
 Round, to reign supreme over the others during the whole of the
 Fifth. The remaining two are as yet absolutely beyond the range
 of human perception. These latter will, however, appear as presentments
 during the 6th and 7th Races of this Round, and will become known
 in the 6th and 7th Rounds respectively.* These seven elements

 the divine breath. Hence, whereas after an absolute pralaya, or
 when the pre-existing material consists but of ONE Element, and
 BREATH "is everywhere," the latter acts from without
 inwardly: after a minor pralaya, everything having remained in
 <em>statu quo -- </em>in a refrigerated state, so to say, like
 the moon -- at the first flutter of manvantara, the planet or
 planets begin their resurrection to life from within outwardly.

 * It is curious to notice how, in the evolutionary cycles of ideas,
 ancient thought seems to be reflected in modern speculation. Had
 Mr. Herbert Spencer read and studied ancient Hindu philosophers
 when he wrote a certain passage in his "First Principles"
 (p. 482), or is it an independent flash of inner perception that
 made him say half correctly, half incorrectly, "motion as
 well as matter, being fixed in quantity (?), it would seem that
 the change in the distribution of Matter which Motion effects,
 coming to a limit in whichever direction it is carried (?), the
 indestructible Motion thereupon necessitates a reverse distribution.
 Apparently, the universally co-existent forces of attraction and
 repulsion which, as we have seen, necessitate rhythm in all minor
 changes throughout the Universe, also necessitate rhythm in the
 totality of its changes -- produce now an immeasurable period
 during which the attracting forces predominating, cause universal
 concentration, and then an immeasurable period, during which the
 repulsive forces predominating, cause universal diffusion -- alternate
 eras of Evolution and dissolution."</p><hr>

 far more numerous than those known to Science) are simply <em>conditional
 </em>modifications and aspects of the ONE and only Element. This
 latter is not <em>Ether,* </em>not even <em>A'kasa </em>but the
 <em>Source </em>of these. The Fifth Element, now advocated quite
 freely by Science, is not the Ether hypothesised by Sir Isaac
 Newton -- although he calls it by that name, having associated
 it in his mind probably with the AEther, "Father-Mother"
 of Antiquity. As Newton intuitionally says, "Nature is a
 perpetual circulatory worker, generating fluids out of solids,
 fixed things out of volatile, and volatile out of fixed, subtile
 out of gross, and gross out of subtile. . . . . Thus, perhaps,
 may all things be originated from Ether," (Hypoth, 1675).
 </p><p>
 The reader has to bear in mind that the Stanzas given treat only
 of the Cosmogony of our own planetary System and what is visible
 around it, after a Solar Pralaya. The secret teachings with regard
 to the Evolution of the Universal Kosmos cannot be given, since
 they could not be understood by the highest minds in this age,
 and there seem to be very few Initiates, even among the greatest,
 who are allowed to speculate upon this subject. Moreover the Teachers
 say openly that not even the highest Dhyani-Chohans have ever
 penetrated the mysteries beyond those boundaries that separate
 the milliards of Solar systems from the "Central Sun,"
 as it is called. Therefore, that which is given, relates only
 to our visible Kosmos, after a "Night of Brahma."
 </p><p>
 Before the reader proceeds to the consideration of the Stanzas
 from the Book of Dzyan which form the basis of the present work,
 it is absolutely necessary that he should be made acquainted with
 the few fundamental conceptions which underlie and pervade the
 entire system of thought to which his attention is invited. These
 basic ideas are few in number, and on their clear apprehension
 depends the understanding of all that follows; therefore no apology
 is required for asking the reader to make himself familiar with
 them first, before entering on the perusal of the work itself.

 * Whatever the views of physical Science upon the subject, Occult
 Science has been teaching for ages that A'kasa -- of which Ether
 is the grossest form -- the fifth universal Cosmic Principle (to
 which corresponds and from which proceeds human Manas) is, cosmically,
 a radiant, cool, diathermanous plastic matter, creative in its
 physical nature, correlative in its grossest aspects and portions,
 immutable in its higher principles. In the former condition it
 is called the Sub-Root; and in conjunction with radiant heat,
 it recalls "dead worlds to life." In its higher aspect
 it is the Soul of the World; in its lower -- the DESTROYER.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 14 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The Secret Doctrine establishes three fundamental propositions:
 --
 </p><p>
 <i>(</i><em>a</em><i>)</i> An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless,
 and Immutable <strong>P</strong>RINCIPLE on which all speculation
 is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception
 and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude.
 It is beyond the range and reach of thought -- in the words of
 Mandukya, "unthinkable and unspeakable."
 </p><p>
 To render these ideas clearer to the general reader, let him set
 out with the postulate that there is one absolute Reality which
 antecedes all manifested, conditioned, being. This Infinite and
 Eternal Cause -- dimly formulated in the "Unconscious"
 and "Unknowable" of current European philosophy -- is
 the rootless root of "all that was, is, or ever shall be."
 It is of course devoid of all attributes and is essentially without
 any relation to manifested, finite Being. It is "Be-ness"
 rather than Being (in Sanskrit, <em>Sat</em>), and is beyond all
 thought or speculation.
 </p><p>
 This "Be-ness" is symbolised in the Secret Doctrine
 under two aspects. On the one hand, absolute abstract Space, representing
 bare subjectivity, the one thing which no human mind can either
 exclude from any conception, or conceive of by itself. On the
 other, absolute Abstract Motion representing Unconditioned Consciousness.
 Even our Western thinkers have shown that Consciousness is inconceivable
 to us apart from change, and motion best symbolises change, its
 essential characteristic. This latter aspect of the one Reality,
 is also symbolised by the term "The Great Breath," a
 symbol sufficiently graphic to need no further elucidation. Thus,
 then, the first fundamental axiom of the Secret Doctrine is this
 metaphysical <strong>O</strong>NE <strong>A</strong>BSOLUTE --
 <strong>B</strong>E-NESS -- symbolised by finite intelligence
 as the theological Trinity.
 </p><p>
 It may, however, assist the student if a few further explanations
 are given here.
 </p><p>
 Herbert Spencer has of late so far modified his Agnosticism, as
 to assert that the nature of the "First Cause,"* which
 the Occultist more logically derives from the "Causeless
 Cause," the "Eternal," and the "Unknowable,"
 may be essentially the same as that of the Consciousness which
 wells up within us: in short, that the impersonal reality pervading

 is the "first brought forth, the first in time, space, and
 rank" -- and therefore finite and conditioned. The "first"

 <p>
 the Kosmos is the pure noumenon of thought. This advance on his
 part brings him very near to the esoteric and Vedantin tenet.*
 </p><p>
 Parabrahm (the One Reality, the Absolute) is the field of Absolute
 Consciousness, <em>i.e.,</em> that Essence which is out of all
 relation to conditioned existence, and of which conscious existence
 is a conditioned symbol. But once that we pass in thought from
 this (to us) Absolute Negation, duality supervenes in the contrast
 of Spirit (or consciousness) and Matter, Subject and Object.
 </p><p>
 Spirit (or Consciousness) and Matter are, however, to be regarded,
 not as independent realities, but as the two facets or aspects
 of the Absolute (Parabrahm), which constitute the basis of conditioned
 Being whether subjective or objective.
 </p><p>
 Considering this metaphysical triad as the Root from which proceeds
 all manifestation, the great Breath assumes the character of precosmic
 Ideation. It is the<em> fons et origo </em>of force and of all
 individual consciousness, and supplies the guiding intelligence
 in the vast scheme of cosmic Evolution. On the other hand, precosmic
 root-substance (<em>Mulaprakriti</em>) is that aspect of the Absolute
 which underlies all the objective planes of Nature.
 </p><p>
 Just as pre-Cosmic Ideation is the root of all individual consciousness,
 so pre-Cosmic Substance is the substratum of matter in the various
 grades of its differentiation.
 </p><p>
 Hence it will be apparent that the contrast of these two aspects
 of the Absolute is essential to the existence of the "Manifested
 Universe." Apart from Cosmic Substance, Cosmic Ideation could
 not manifest as individual consciousness, since it is only through
 a vehicle<a name="t3">**</a> of matter that consciousness wells
 up as "I am I," a physical basis being necessary to
 focus a ray of the Universal Mind at a certain stage of complexity.
 Again, apart from Cosmic Ideation, Cosmic Substance would remain
 an empty abstraction, and no emergence of consciousness could
 ensue.
 </p><p>
 The "Manifested Universe," therefore, is pervaded by
 duality, which is, as it were, the very essence of its EX-istence
 as "manifestation."
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] <em>cannot be the absolute</em>,
 for it is a manifestation. Therefore, Eastern Occultism calls
 the Abstract All the "Causeless One Cause," the "Rootless
 Root," and limits the "First Cause" to the <em>Logos,
 </em>in the sense that Plato gives to this term.

 <p>
 But just as the opposite poles of subject and object, spirit and
 matter, are but aspects of the One Unity in which they are synthesized,
 so, in the manifested Universe, there is "that" which
 links spirit to matter, subject to object.
 </p><p>
 This something, at present unknown to Western speculation, is
 called by the occultists Fohat. It is the "bridge" by
 which the "Ideas" existing in the "Divine Thought"
 are impressed on Cosmic substance as the "laws of Nature."
 Fohat is thus the dynamic energy of Cosmic Ideation; or, regarded
 from the other side, it is the intelligent medium, the guiding
 power of all manifestation, the "Thought Divine" transmitted
 and made manifest through the Dhyan Chohans,* the Architects of
 the visible World. Thus from Spirit, or Cosmic Ideation, comes
 our consciousness; from Cosmic Substance the several vehicles
 in which that consciousness is individualised and attains to self
 -- or reflective -- consciousness; while Fohat, in its various
 manifestations, is the mysterious link between Mind and Matter,
 the animating principle electrifying every atom into life.
 </p><p>
 The following summary will afford a clearer idea to the reader.
 </p><p>
 (1.) The <strong>A</strong>BSOLUTE; the <em>Parabrahm </em>of
 the Vedantins or the one Reality, <strong>S</strong>AT, which
 is, as Hegel says, both Absolute Being and Non-Being.
 </p><p>
 (2.) The first manifestation, the impersonal, and, in philosophy,
 <em>unmanifested</em> Logos, the precursor of the "manifested."
 This is the "First Cause," the "Unconscious"
 of European Pantheists.
 </p><p>
 (3.) Spirit-matter, <strong>L</strong>IFE; the "Spirit of
 the Universe," the Purusha and Prakriti, or the <em>second
 </em>Logos.
 </p><p>
 (4.) Cosmic Ideation, <strong>M</strong>AHAT or Intelligence,
 the Universal World-Soul; the Cosmic Noumenon of Matter, the basis
 of the intelligent operations in and of Nature, also called <strong>M</strong>AHA-<strong>B</strong>UDDHI.
 </p><p>
 The <strong>O</strong>NE <strong>R</strong>EALITY; its <em>dual</em>
 aspects in the conditioned Universe.
 </p><p>
 Further, the Secret Doctrine affirms: --
 </p><p>
 <i>(</i><em>b.</em><i>)</i> The Eternity of the Universe <em>in
 toto </em>as a boundless plane; periodically "the playground
 of numberless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappearing,"
 called "the manifesting stars," and the "sparks
 of Eternity." "The Eternity of the Pilgrim"*<a name="t5">*</a>
 is like a wink
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Called by Christian theology: Archangels, Seraphs, etc., etc.
 </p><p>
 <a name="n5">**</a> "Pilgrim" is the appellation given
 to our <em>Monad </em>(the two in one) during its cycle of incarnations.
 It is the only immortal and eternal principle in us, being an
 indivisible part of the integral whole -- the Universal Spirit,
 from which it emanates, and into which it is absorbed at the end
 of the cycle. When it is said to emanate from the one [[Footnote
 continued on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 17 PROEM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of the Eye of Self-Existence (Book of Dzyan.) "The appearance
 and disappearance of Worlds is like a regular tidal ebb of flux
 and reflux." (See Part II., "Days and Nights of Brahma.")
 </p><p>
 This second assertion of the Secret Doctrine is the absolute universality
 of that law of periodicity, of flux and reflux, ebb and flow,
 which physical science has observed and recorded in all departments
 of nature. An alternation such as that of Day and Night, Life
 and Death, Sleeping and Waking, is a fact so common, so perfectly
 universal and without exception, that it is easy to comprehend
 that in it we see one of the absolutely fundamental laws of the
 universe.
 </p><p>
 Moreover, the Secret Doctrine teaches: --
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>)<em> </em>The fundamental identity of all Souls with
 the Universal Over-Soul, the latter being itself an aspect of
 the Unknown Root; and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul
 -- a spark of the former -- through the Cycle of Incarnation (or
 "Necessity") in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic law,
 during the whole term. In other words, no purely spiritual Buddhi
 (divine Soul) can have an independent (conscious) existence before
 the spark which issued from the pure Essence of the Universal
 Sixth principle, -- or the OVER-SOUL, -- has (a) passed through
 every elemental form of the phenomenal world of that Manvantara,
 and (b) acquired individuality, first by natural impulse, and
 then by self-induced and self-devised efforts (checked by its
 Karma), thus ascending through all the degrees of intelligence,
 from the lowest to the highest Manas, from mineral and plant,
 up to the holiest archangel (Dhyani-Buddha). The pivotal doctrine
 of the Esoteric philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts
 in man, save those won by his own Ego through personal effort
 and merit throughout a long series of metempsychoses and reincarnations.
 This is why the Hindus say that the Universe is Brahma and Brahmâ,
 for Brahma is in every atom of the universe, the six principles
 in Nature being all the outcome -- the variously differentiated
 aspects -- of the SEVENTH and ONE, the only reality in the Universe
 whether Cosmical or micro-cosmical; and also why the permutations
 (psychic, spiritual and physical), on the plane of manifestation
 and form, of the sixth (Brahmâ the vehicle of Brahma) are
 viewed by metaphysical

 incorrect expression has to be used, for lack of appropriate words
 in English. The Vedantins call it Sutratma (Thread-Soul), but
 their explanation, too, differs somewhat from that of the occultists;
 to explain which difference, however, is left to the Vedantins
 themselves.</p><hr>

 <p>
 antiphrasis as illusive and Mayavic. For although the root of
 every atom individually and of every form collectively, is that
 seventh principle or the one Reality, still, in its manifested
 phenomenal and temporary appearance, it is no better than an evanescent
 illusion of our senses. (See, for clearer definition, Addendum
 "Gods, Monads and Atoms," and also "Theophania,"
 "Bodhisatvas and Reincarnation," etc., etc.)
 </p><p>
 In its absoluteness, the One Principle under its two aspects (of
 Parabrahmam and Mulaprakriti) is sexless, unconditioned and eternal.
 Its periodical (manvantaric) emanation -- or primal radiation
 -- is also One, androgynous and phenomenally finite. When the
 radiation radiates in its turn, all its radiations are also androgynous,
 to become male and female principles in their lower aspects. After
 Pralaya, whether the great or the minor Pralaya (the latter leaving
 the worlds in <em>statu quo*</em>)<em>, </em>the first that re-awakes
 to active life is the plastic A'kasa, Father-Mother, the Spirit
 and Soul of Ether, or the plane on the surface of the Circle.
 Space is called the "Mother" before its Cosmic activity,
 and Father-Mother at the first stage of re-awakening. (See Comments,
 Stanza II.) In the Kabala it is also Father-Mother-Son. But whereas
 in the Eastern doctrine, these are the Seventh Principle of the
 manifested Universe, or its "Atma-Buddhi-Manas" (Spirit,
 Soul, Intelligence), the triad branching off and dividing into
 the seven cosmical and seven human principles, in the Western
 Kabala of the Christian mystics it is the Triad or Trinity, and
 with their occultists, the male-female Jehovah, Jah-Havah. In
 this lies the whole difference between the esoteric and the Christian
 trinities. The Mystics and the Philosophers, the Eastern and Western
 Pantheists, synthesize their pregenetic triad in the pure divine
 abstraction. The orthodox, anthropomorphize it. <em>Hiranyagarbha,
 Hari, </em>and<em> Sankara</em> -- the<em> </em>three hypostases
 of the manifesting "Spirit of the Supreme Spirit" (by
 which title Prithivi -- the Earth -- greets Vishnu in his first
 Avatar) -- are the purely metaphysical abstract qualities of formation,
 preservation, and destruction, and are the three divine Avasthas
 (lit. hypostases) of that which "does

 "photographs." But during the minor pralayas, once over-taken
 by the "Night," the planets remain intact, though dead,

 the same for ages.</p><hr>

 not perish with created things" (or Achyuta, a name of Vishnu);
 whereas the orthodox Christian separates his personal creative
 Deity into the three personages of the Trinity, and admits of
 no higher Deity. The latter, in Occultism, is the abstract Triangle;
 with the orthodox, the perfect Cube. The creative god or the aggregate
 gods are regarded by the Eastern philosopher as <em>Bhrantidarsanatah</em>
 --<em> </em>"<em>false </em>apprehension," something
 "conceived of, by reason of erroneous appearances, as a material
 form," and explained as arising from the illusive conception
 of the Egotistic personal and human Soul (lower fifth principle).
 It is beautifully expressed in a new translation of Vishnu Purana.
 "That Brahma in its totality has essentially the aspect of
 Prakriti, both evolved and unevolved (Mulaprakriti), and also
 the aspect of Spirit and the aspect of Time. Spirit, O twice born,
 is the leading aspect of the Supreme Brahma.* The next is a twofold
 aspect, -- Prakriti, both evolved and unevolved, and is the time
 last." Kronos is shown in the Orphic theogony as being also
 a generated god or agent.
 </p><p>
 At this stage of the re-awakening of the Universe, the sacred
 symbolism represents it as a perfect Circle with the (root) point
 in the Centre. This sign was universal, therefore we find it in
 the Kabala also. The Western Kabala, however, now in the hands
 of Christian mystics, ignores it altogether, though it is plainly
 shown in the Zohar. These sectarians begin at the end, and show
 as the symbol of pregenetic Kosmos this sign <img src="sd1-5a.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,
 calling it "the Union of the Rose and Cross," the great
 mystery of occult generation, from whence the name -- Rosicrucians
 (Rose Cross)!
 </p><p>
 As may be judged, however, from the most important, as the best
 known of the Rosicrucians' symbols, there is one which has never
 been hitherto understood even by modern mystics. It is that of
 the "Pelican" tearing open its breast to feed its seven
 little ones -- the real creed of the Brothers of the Rosie-Cross
 and a direct outcome from the Eastern

 only reflects an aspect of the old esoteric philosophers, and
 hence lands his readers on the bleak shore of Agnostic despair
 -- reverently formulates the grand mystery; "that which persists
 unchanging in quantity, but ever changing in form, under these
 sensible appearances which the Universe presents to us, is an
 unknown and unknowable power, which we are obliged to recognise
 as without limit in Space and without beginning or end in time."
 It is only daring Theology -- never Science or philosophy -- which
 seeks to gauge the Infinite and unveil the Fathomless and Unknowable.

 <p>
 Secret Doctrine. Brahma (neuter) is called Kalahansa, meaning,
 as explained by Western Orientalists, the Eternal Swan or goose
 (see Stanza III., Comment. 8), and so is Brahma, the Creator.
 A great mistake is thus brought under notice; it is Brahma (neuter)
 who ought to be referred to as Hansa-vahana (He who uses the swan
 as his Vehicle) and not Brahma the Creator, who is the real Kalahansa,
 while Brahma (neuter) is hamsa, and "A-hamsa," as will
 be explained in the Commentary. Let it be understood that the
 terms Brahma and Parabrahmam are not used here because they belong
 to our Esoteric nomenclature, but simply because they are more
 familiar to the students in the West. Both are the perfect equivalents
 of our one, three, and seven vowelled terms, which stand for the
 <strong>O</strong>NE <strong>A</strong>LL, and the One "All
 in all."
 </p><p>
 Such are the basic conceptions on which the Secret Doctrine rests.
 </p><p>
 It would not be in place here to enter upon any defence or proof
 of their inherent reasonableness; nor can I pause to show how
 they are, in fact, contained -- though too often under a misleading
 guise -- in every system of thought or philosophy worthy of the
 name.
 </p><p>
 Once that the reader has gained a clear comprehension of them
 and realised the light which they throw on every problem of life,
 they will need no further justification in his eyes, because their
 truth will be to him as evident as the sun in heaven. I pass on,
 therefore, to the subject matter of the Stanzas as given in this
 volume, adding a skeleton outline of them, in the hope of thereby
 rendering the task of the student more easy, by placing before
 him in a few words the general conception therein explained.
 </p><p>
 Stanza I. The history of cosmic evolution, as traced in the Stanzas,
 is, so to say, the abstract algebraical formula of that Evolution.
 Hence the student must not expect to find there an account of
 all the stages and transformations which intervene between the
 first beginnings of "Universal" evolution and our present
 state. To give such an account would be as impossible as it would
 be incomprehensible to men who cannot even grasp the nature of
 the plane of existence next to that to which, for the moment,
 their consciousness is limited.
 </p><p>
 The Stanzas, therefore, give an abstract formula which can be
 applied, <em>mutatis mutandis, </em>to all evolution: to that
 of our tiny earth, to</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 21 PROEM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 that of the chain of planets of which that earth forms one, to
 the solar Universe to which that chain belongs, and so on, in
 an ascending scale, till the mind reels and is exhausted in the
 effort.
 </p><p>
 The seven Stanzas given in this volume represent the seven terms
 of this abstract formula. They refer to, and describe the seven
 great stages of the evolutionary process, which are spoken of
 in the Puranas as the "Seven Creations," and in the
 Bible as the "Days" of Creation.
 </p><p>
 ---------------------
 </p><p>
 The First Stanza describes the state of the ONE ALL during Pralaya,
 before the first flutter of re-awakening manifestation.
 </p><p>
 A moment's thought shows that such a state can only be symbolised;
 to describe it is impossible. Nor can it be symbolised except
 in negatives; for, since it is the state of Absoluteness <em>per
 se, </em>it can possess none of those specific attributes which
 serve us to describe objects in positive terms. Hence that state
 can only be suggested by the negatives of all those most abstract
 attributes which men feel rather than conceive, as the remotest
 limits attainable by their power of conception.
 </p><p>
 The stage described in Stanza II. is, to a western mind , so nearly
 identical with that mentioned in the first Stanza, that to express
 the idea of its difference would require a treatise in itself.
 Hence it must be left to the intuition and the higher faculties
 of the reader to grasp, as far as he can, the meaning of the allegorical
 phrases used. Indeed it must be remembered that all these Stanzas
 appeal to the inner faculties rather than to the ordinary comprehension
 of the physical brain.
 </p><p>
 Stanza III. describes the Re-awakening of the Universe to life
 after Pralaya. It depicts the emergence of the "Monads"
 from thei[[r]] state of absorption within the ONE; the earliest
 and highest stage in the formation of "Worlds," the
 term Monad being one which may apply equally to the vastest Solar
 System or the tiniest atom.
 </p><p>
 Stanza IV. shows the differentiation of the "Germ" of
 the Universe</p><hr>

 into the septenary hierarchy of conscious Divine Powers, who are
 the active manifestations of the One Supreme Energy. They are
 the framers, shapers, and ultimately the creators of all the manifested
 Universe, in the only sense in which the name "Creator"
 is intelligible; they inform and guide it; they are the intelligent
 Beings who adjust and control evolution, embodying in themselves
 those manifestations of the ONE LAW, which we know as "The
 Laws of Nature."
 </p><p>
 Generically, they are known as the Dhyan Chohans, though each
 of the various groups has its own designation in the Secret Doctrine.
 </p><p>
 This stage of evolution is spoken of in Hindu mythology as the
 "Creation" of the Gods.
 </p><p>
 In Stanza V. the process of world-formation is described: ---
 First, diffused Cosmic Matter, then the fiery "whirlwind,"
 the first stage in the formation of a nebula. That nebula condenses,
 and after passing through various transformations, forms a Solar
 Universe, a planetary chain, or a single planet, as the case may
 be.
 </p><p>
 The subsequent stages in the formation of a "World"
 are indicated in Stanza VI., which brings the evolution of such
 a world down to its fourth great period, corresponding to the
 period in which we are now living.
 </p><p>
 Stanza VII. continues the history, tracing the descent of life
 down to the appearance of Man; and thus closes the first Book
 of the Secret Doctrine.
 </p><p>
 The development of "Man" from his first appearance on
 this earth in this Round to the state in which we now find him
 will form the subject of Book II.

 than useless to make the subject still more difficult by introducing
 the archaic phraseology of the original, with its puzzling style
 and words. Extracts are given from the Chinese Thibetan and Sanskrit
 translations of the original Senzar Commentaries and Glosses on
 the Book of <strong>D</strong>ZYAN -- these being now rendered
 for the first time into a European language. It is almost unnecessary
 to state that only portions of the seven Stanzas are here given.
 Were they published complete they would remain incomprehensible
 to all save the few higher occultists. Nor is there any need to
 assure the reader that, no more than most of the profane, does
 the writer, or rather the humble recorder, understand those forbidden
 passages. To facilitate the reading, and to avoid the too frequent
 reference to foot-notes, it was thought best to blend together
 texts and glosses, using the Sanskrit and Tibetan proper names
 whenever those cannot be avoided, in preference to giving the
 originals. The more so as the said terms are all accepted synonyms,
 the former only being used between a Master and his chelas (or
 disciples).
 </p><p>
 Thus, were one to translate into English, using only the substantives
 and technical terms as employed in one of the Tibetan and Senzar
 versions, Verse I would read as follows: --- "Tho-ag in Zhi-gyu
 slept seven Khorlo. Zodmanas zhiba. All Nyug bosom. Konch-hog
 not; Thyan-Kam not; Lha-Chohan not; Tenbrel Chugnyi not; Dharmakaya
 ceased; Tgenchang not become; Barnang and Ssa in Ngovonyidj; alone
 Tho-og Yinsin in night of Sun-chan and Yong-grub (Parinishpanna),
 &amp;c., &amp;c.," which would sound like pure <em>Abracadabra.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 As this work is written for the instruction of students of Occultism,
 and not for the benefit of philologists, we may well avoid such
 foreign terms wherever it is possible to do so. The untranslateable
 terms alone, incomprehensible unless explained in their meanings,
 are left, but all such terms are rendered in their Sanskrit form.
 Needless to remind the reader that these are, in almost every
 case, the late developments of the later language, and pertain
 to the Fifth Root-Race. Sanskrit, as now known, was not spoken
 by the Atlanteans, and most of the philosophical terms used in
 the systems of the India of the post-Mahabharatan period are not
 found in the Vedas, nor are they to be met with in the original
 Stanzas, but only their equivalents. The reader who is not a Theosophist,
 is once more invited to regard all that which follows as a fairy
 tale, if he likes; at best as one of the yet unproven speculations
 of</p><hr>

 <p>
 <em>dreamers; </em>and, at the worst, as an additional hypothesis
 to the many Scientific hypotheses past, present and future, some
 exploded, others still lingering. It is not in any sense worse
 than are many of the so called Scientific theories; and it is
 in every case more philosophical and probable.
 </p><p>
 In view of the abundant comments and explanations required, the
 references to the footnotes are given in the usual way, while
 the sentences to be commented upon are marked with figures. Additional
 matter will be found in the Chapters on Symbolism forming Part
 II., as well as in Part III., these being often more full of information
 than the text.
