 THE SEVEN CREATIONS.</h4>
 
 <p>
 "<strong>T</strong>HERE was neither day nor night, nor sky
 nor earth, nor darkness nor light, nor any other thing save only
 ONE, unapprehensible by intellect, or THAT which is Brahma and
 Pumis (Spirit) and Pradhana (crude matter)" (<em>Veda: </em>"<em>Vishnu
 Purana Commentary</em>");<em> </em>or literally: "One
 Pradhanika Brahma Spirit: THAT was." The "Pradhanika
 Brahma Spirit" is Mulaprakriti and Parabrahmam.
 </p><p>
 In Vishnu Purana, Parasara says to Maitreya, his pupil: -- "I
 have thus explained to you, excellent Muni, six creations. . .
 . the creation of the Arvaksrotas beings was the seventh, and
 was that of man." Then he proceeds to speak of two additional
 and very mysterious creations, variously interpreted by the commentators.
 </p><p>
 Origen, commenting upon the books written by Celsus, his opponent
 -- books which were all destroyed by the prudent Church Fathers
 -- evidently answers the objections of his contradictor and reveals
 his system at the same time. This was evidently <em>septenary.
 </em>But his theogony, the genesis of the stars or planets, that
 of sound and colour, all found as an answer satire, and no better.
 Celsus, you see, "desiring to exhibit his learning,"
 speaks of a ladder of creation with <em>seven gates</em>,<em>
 </em>and on the top</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 446 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of it the eighth -- ever closed. The mysteries of the Persian
 Mithras are explained and "musical reasons, moreover, are
 added." . . . . And to these again he strives "to add
 a second explanation connected also with musical considerations,"*
 -- <em>i.e.</em>, with the seven notes of the scale, the Seven
 Spirits of the Stars, &amp;c., &amp;c.
 </p><p>
 Valentinus expatiates upon the power of the great <em>Seven</em>,
 who were called to bring forth this universe after <em>Ar</em>(<em>r</em>)<em>hetos</em>,<em>
 </em>or the Ineffable, whose name is composed of seven letters,
 had represented the first <em>hebdomad. </em>This name (Ar(r)hetos)
 is one to indicate the Sevenfold nature of the One (the <em>logos</em>)<em>.
 </em>"The goddess Rhea," says Proclus in <em>Timaeus
 </em>(p.<em> </em>121), "is a Monad, Duad, and Heptad,"
 comprehending in herself all the <em>Titanidae</em>,<em> </em>"who
 are seven."
 </p><p>
 The <em>Seven Creations </em>are found in almost every Purana.
 They are all preceded by what Wilson translates -- "the indiscrete
 Principle," absolute Spirit independent of any relation with
 objects of sense. They are -- (1)<em> Mahattattwa</em>,<em> </em>the
 Universal Soul, Infinite Intellect, or Divine Mind; (2)<em> Bhuta
 </em>or<em> Bhutasarga</em>,<em> </em>elemental creation, the
 first differentiation of Universal indiscrete Substance; (3) <em>Indriya
 </em>or<em> Aindriyaka</em>,<em> </em>organic evolution. "These
 three were the Prakrita creations, the <em>developments of indiscrete
 nature </em>preceded by indiscrete principle"; (4) <em>Mukhya</em>,<em>
 </em>the fundamental creation of perceptible things, was that
 of inanimate bodies**; (5) <em>Tairyagyonya</em>,<em> </em>or<em>
 Tiryaksrotas</em>,<em> </em>was that of animals; (6) <em>Urdhwasrotas</em>,<em>
 </em>or that of divinities*** (?); (7) <em>Arvaksrotas</em>,<em>
 </em>was that of man. (<em>See Vishnu Purana.</em>)
 </p><p>
 This is the order given in the <em>exoteric </em>texts. According
 to esoteric teaching there are seven primary, and seven secondary
 "creations;" the former being the Forces <em>self-evolving
 </em>from the one <em>causeless </em>FORCE; the latter, showing
 the manifested Universe emanating from the already differentiated
 <em>divine</em> elements.
 </p><p>
 Esoterically, as well as exoterically, all the above enumerated
 Creations stand for the (7) periods of Evolution, whether after
 an "Age" or a "Day" of Brahma. This is the
 teaching <em>par excellence </em>of Occult Philosophy, which,
 however, never uses the term "creation," nor even that
 of evolution, "with regard to <em>primary </em>'Creation':"
 but calls all such <em>forces </em>"the<em> aspects </em>of
 the Causeless Force." In the Bible
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * Origen <em>contra </em>Celsum, b. vi., chap. xxii.
 </p><p>
 ** The text says: "And the fourth creation is <em>here </em>the
 primary, for <em>things </em>immovable are emphatically known
 as primary." (<em>See Fitzedward Hall</em>'<em>s Corrections.</em>)
 </p><p>
 *** How can "divinities" have been created <em>after</em>
 the animals? The esoteric meaning of the expression "animals"
 is the <em>germs of all animal</em> <em>life </em>including man.
 Man is called a <em>sacrificial animal</em>,<em> </em>and an animal
 that is the only one among animal creation who sacrifices to the
 gods. <em>Moreover</em>,<em> </em>by the "sacred animals,"
 the 12 signs of the zodiac are often meant in the sacred texts,
 as already stated.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 447 THE ORDER OF THE EVOLUTION.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the seven periods are dwarfed into the six days of creation and
 the seventh <em>day </em>of rest, and the Westerns adhere to the
 letter. In the Hindu philosophy, when the active Creator has produced
 the world of gods, the <em>germs </em>of all the undifferentiated
 elements and the rudiments of future senses (the world of noumena,
 in short), the Universe remains unaltered for a "Day of Brahma,"
 a period of 4,320,000,000 years. This is the <em>seventh </em>passive
 period or the "Sabbath day" of Eastern philosophy, that
 follows six periods of active evolution. In the <em>Satapatha
 Brahmana </em>"Brahma" (neuter), the <em>absolute Cause
 </em>of all Causes, <em>radiates </em>the gods. Having radiated
 the gods (through its inherent nature) the work is interrupted.
 In the 1st Book of Manu it is said, "At the expiration of
 each night (pralaya) Brahma, having been asleep, awakes, and,
 <em>through the sole energy of the motion</em>,<em> </em>CAUSES
 to emanate from <em>itself </em>the spirit, which in its essence
 is, and yet is not."
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Sepher Jezirah</em>,<em> </em>the Kabalistic Book of
 Creation, the author has evidently repeated the words of Manu.
 In it the Divine Substance is represented as having alone existed
 from the eternity, boundless and absolute; and as having emitted
 from itself the Spirit. "One is the Spirit of the living
 God, blessed be his Name, who liveth for ever! Voice, Spirit,
 and Word, this is the Holy Spirit." (<em>Sepher Jezireh</em>,<em>
 chap.</em> 1,<em> Mishna IX.</em>)<em> </em>And this is the Kabalistic
 abstract Trinity, so unceremoniously anthropomorphized by the
 Fathers. From this triple ONE emanated the whole Kosmos. First
 from ONE emanated number TWO, or Air, the creative element; and
 then number THREE, <em>Water</em>,<em> </em>proceeded from the
 air; <em>Ether </em>or<em> Fire</em> complete the mystic four,
 the Arba-il. (Ibid.) In the Eastern doctrine Fire is the first
 Element -- <em>Ether</em>, synthesizing the whole (since it contains
 all of them).
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Vishnu Purana</em>,<em> </em>the whole seven periods
 are given, and the progressive Evolution of "Spirit-Soul,"
 and of the seven forms of matter (or principles) are shown. It
 is impossible to enumerate them in this work. The reader is asked
 to peruse one of the Puranas.
 </p><p>
 "R. Yehudah began, it is written: 'Elohim said: Let there
 be a firmament, in the midst of waters. . . . . At the time that
 the Holy . . . created the world, He (they) created seven heavens
 Above. He created seven earths Below, seven seas, seven days,
 seven rivers, seven weeks, seven years, seven times, and 7,000
 years that the world has been. . . . . the seventh of all the
 millennium. So here are seven earths Below, they are all inhabited
 except those which are above, and those . . . . below. And . .
 . . between each earth, a heaven (firmament) is spread out between
 each other. . . . . And there are in them (these earths) creatures
 who look different from each other . . . . but if you object and
 say that all the children of the world came out from Adam,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 448 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 it is not so. . . . . And the lower earths, where do they come
 from? They are <em>from the chain of the earth</em>,<em> </em>and
 from the heaven below," etc., etc.*
 </p><p>
 Irenaeus is our witness (and a very unwilling one, too) that the
 Gnostics taught the same system, veiling very carefully the true
 esoteric meaning. This "veiling," however, is identical
 with that of the Vishnu Purana and others. Thus Irenaeus writes
 of the Marcosians: "They maintain that first of all the four
 elements, fire, water, earth and air, were produced after the
 image of the primary <em>tetrad </em>above, and that then if we
 add their operations, namely, heat, cold, dryness and moisture,
 an exact likeness of the ogdoad is presented." (B. i. ch.
 xvii.)
 </p><p>
 Only this "likeness" and the <em>ogdoad </em>itself
 is a blind, just as in the seven creations of the Vishnu Puranas,
 to which two more are added of which the eighth, termed Anugraha,
 "possesses both the qualities of goodness and darkness,"
 a Sankhyan more than a Puranic idea. For Irenaeus says again (b.
 I. xxx. 6) that "they (the Gnostics) had a like eighth creation
 which was good and bad, divine and human. They affirm that man
 was formed <em>on the eighth day</em>. Sometimes they affirm that
 he was made on the <em>sixth day</em>,<em> </em>and at others
 on the eighth; unless, perchance, they mean that his earthly part
 was formed on the sixth day and his fleshly part (?) on the eighth
 day; these two being distinguished by them."
 </p><p>
 They were so "distinguished," but not as Irenaeus gives
 it. The Gnostics had a superior <em>Hebdomad</em>,<em> </em>and
 an inferior one, in Heaven; and a third terrestrial <em>Hebdomad</em>,<em>
 </em>on the plane of matter. <strong>I</strong>AO, the mystery
 god and the Regent of the Moon, as given in Origen's chart, was
 the chief of these superior "<em>Seven Heavens</em>,"**<em>
 </em>hence identical with the chief of the lunar Pitris, that
 name being given by them to the lunar Dhyan-Chohans. "They
 affirm that these seven heavens are intelligent, and <em>speak
 of them as being angels</em>,"<em> </em>writes the same Irenaeus;
 and adds that on this account they termed Iao Hebdomas, while
 his mother was called "<em>Ogdoas</em>,"<em> </em>because,
 as he explains, "she preserved the number of <em>the first
 begotten and primary Ogdoad of the Pleroma.</em>"<em> </em>(Ibid.
 b. I, v. 2).
 </p><p>
 This "first begotten <em>Ogdoad</em>"<em> </em>was<em>
 </em>(<em>a</em>) in theogony the <em>second Logos </em>(the manifested)
 because he was born of the Seven-fold <em>first Logos</em>,<em>
 </em>hence he is the eighth on this manifested plane; and (<em>b</em>)
 in astrolatry, it was the <em>Sun</em>, Marttanda -- the eighth
 son of Aditi, whom she rejects while preserving her Seven Sons,
 <em>the planets. </em>For the ancients have never regarded the
 Sun as a planet, but <em>as a central and fixed Star. </em>This,
 then, is the second Hebdomad born of the <em>Seven-rayed </em>one,
 Agni, the Sun

 <p>
 and what not, only not the seven planets, which are Surya's <em>brothers</em>,<em>
 </em>not his <em>Sons. </em>These<em> Astral </em>gods, whose
 chief with the Gnostics was Ildabaoth* (from <em>Ilda</em> "child,"
 and <em>Baoth </em>"the egg"), the son of Sophia Achamoth,
 the daughter of Sophia (Wisdom), whose region is the Pleroma,
 were his (Ildabaoth's) sons. He produces from himself these six
 stellar spirits: <em>Jove</em> (Jehovah),<em> Sabaoth</em>,<em>
 Adonai</em>,<em> Eloi</em>,<em> Osraios</em>,<em> Astaphaios</em>,<em>**
 </em>and it is they who are the second, or inferior <em>Hebdomad.
 </em>As<em> </em>to the third, it is composed of the seven primeval
 men, the shadows of the lunar gods, projected by the first Hebdomad.
 In this the Gnostics did not, as seen, differ much from the esoteric
 doctrine except that they veiled it. As to the charge made by
 Irenaeus, who was evidently ignorant of the true tenets of the
 "Heretics," with regard to man being created on the
 <em>sixth </em>day, and man being created on the <em>eighth</em>,<em>
 </em>this relates to the mysteries of the <em>inner </em>man.
 It will become comprehensible to the reader only after he has
 read Book II., and understood well the <em>Anthropogenesis </em>of
 the Esoteric doctrine.
 </p><p>
 Ildabaoth is a copy of Manu. The latter boasts, "Oh, best
 of twice-born men! Know that I (Manu) am he, the creator of all
 this world, whom that male Viraj . . . spontaneously produced"
 (I., 33). He first creates the ten lords of Being, the Prajapatis,
 who, as verse 36 says . . . "produce seven other Manus."
 (<em>The Ordinances of Manu.</em>)<em> </em>Ildabaoth does likewise:
 "I am Father and God, and there is no one above me,"
 he exclaims. For which his mother coolly puts him down by saying,
 "Do not lie, Ildabaoth, for the father of all, the <em>first
 </em>man<em> </em>(<em>Anthropos</em>)<em> is above thee</em>,<em>
 and so is Anthropos</em>,<em> the Son of Anthropos</em>"<em>
 </em>(Irenaeus, b. I, ch. xxx., 6). This is a good proof that
 there were three Logoi (besides the Seven born of the First),
 one of these being the <em>Solar Logos. </em>And, again, who was
 that "Anthropos" himself, so much higher than Ildabaoth?
 The Gnostic records alone can solve this riddle. In <em>Pistis
 Sophia </em>the four-vowelled name <strong>I</strong>EOV is in
 each case accompanied by the epithet of "the Primal, or First
 man." This shows again that the gnosis was but an echo of
 our archaic doctrine. The names answering to Parabrahm, to Brahm,
 and Manu (the first <em>thinking </em>man) are composed of one-vowelled,
 three-vowelled and seven-vowelled sounds. Marcus, whose philosophy
 was certainly more Pythagorean than anything else, speaks of a
 revelation to him of the seven heavens sounding each one vowel
 as they pronounced the seven names of the seven (angelic) hierarchies.
 </p><p>
 When spirit has permeated every minutest atom of the seven principles
 of Kosmos, then the <em>secondary </em>creation, after the above-mentioned
 period of rest, begins.

 "The creators (Elohim) outline in the <em>second </em>'hour'
 the shape of man," says Rabbi Simeon (<em>The Nuctameron
 of the Hebrews</em>)<em>. </em>"There are twelve hours in
 the day," says the <em>Mishna</em>,<em> </em>"and it
 is during these that creation is accomplished." The "twelve
 hours of the day" are again the dwarfed copy, the faint,
 yet faithful, echo of primitive Wisdom. They are like the 12,000
 divine years of the gods, a cyclic blind. Every "Day of Brahma"
 has 14 Manus, which the Hebrew Kabalists, following, however,
 in this the Chaldeans, have disguised into 12 "Hours."*
 The <em>Nuctameron </em>of Apollonius of Tyana is the same thing.
 "The Dodecahedron lies concealed in the perfect Cube,"
 say the Kabalists. The mystic meaning of this is, that the twelve
 great transformations of Spirit into matter (the 12,000 divine
 years) take place during the four great ages, or the first<em>
 Mahayuga. </em>Beginning with the metaphysical and the supra-human,
 it ends in the physical and purely human natures of Kosmos and
 man. Eastern philosophy can give the number of mortal years that
 run along the line of spiritual and physical evolutions of the
 seen and the unseen, if Western science fails to do so.
 </p><p>
 <em>Primary </em>Creation is called the <em>Creation of Light
 </em>(Spirit); and the <em>Secondary</em> --<em> </em>that of
 Darkness (matter).** Both are found in <em>Genesis</em>,<em> </em>chap.
 i., v. 2, and at the beginning of chapter ii. The first is the
 emanation of <em>self</em>-born gods (Elohim); the second of physical
 nature.
 </p><p>
 This is why it is said in the Zohar: -- "Oh, companions,
 companions, man as emanation was both man and woman; as well on
 the side of the <strong>F</strong>ATHER as on the side of the
 <strong>M</strong>OTHER. And this is the sense of the words: --
 And Elohim spoke: 'Let there be Light and it was Light!' . . .
 And this is the 'two-fold man'" Light, moreover, on our plane,
 is<em> darkness </em>in the higher spheres.
 </p><p>
 "Man and woman on the side of the FATHER" (Spirit) refers
 to Primary Creation; and on the side of the <em>Mother </em>(matter)
 to the secondary. The two-fold man is Adam Kadmon, the male and
 female abstract prototype and the <em>differentiated </em>Elohim<em>.
 Man </em>proceeds from the Dhyan Chohan, and is a "Fallen
 Angel," a god in exile, as will be shown.
 </p><p>
 In India these creations were described as follows: --
 </p><p>
 (I.) Mahat-tattwa creation -- so-called because it was the primordial
 self-evolution of that which had to become <em>Mahat </em>-- the
 "divine <strong>M</strong>IND, conscious and intelligent";
 esoterically, "the <em>spirit </em>of the Universal soul."
 . . . "Worthiest of ascetics, through its potency (<em>the
 potency of that cause</em>);<em> </em>every <em>produced </em>cause
 comes by its proper nature." (<em>Vishnu Purana.</em>)<em>
 </em>"Seeing that the potencies of all beings are under-

 * Elsewhere, however, the identity is revealed. <em>See supra</em>,<em>
 </em>the quotation from Ibn-Gabirol and his 7 heavens, 7 earths,
 etc.
 </p><p>
 ** This must not be confused with <em>precosmic </em>"<strong>D</strong>ARKNESS,"
 the Divine ALL.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 451 MANY VERSIONS OF THE ONE TRUTH.</h6>
 
 <p>
 stood <em>only </em>through the knowledge of <em>That </em>(Brahma),
 which is beyond reasoning, creation, and the like, such potencies
 are referable to Brahma." <strong>T</strong>HAT, then, precedes
 the manifestation. "The first was <em>Mahat</em>,"<em>
 </em>says<em> Linga Purana; </em>for the ONE (the <em>That</em>)<em>
 </em>is neither <em>first </em>nor<em> last</em>,<em> </em>but
 ALL. Exoterically, however, this manifestation is the <em>work
 </em>of the "Supreme One" (a natural <em>effect</em>,<em>
 </em>rather, of an Eternal Cause); or, as the Commentator says,
 it might have been understood to mean that Brahma was then <em>created
 </em>(?),<em> </em>being identified with Mahat, active intelligence
 or the operating will of the Supreme. Esoteric philosophy renders
 it "the operating LAW."
 </p><p>
 It is on the right comprehension of this tenet in the Brahmanas
 and Puranas that hangs, we believe, the apple of discord between
 the three Vedantin Sects: the Advaita, Dwaita, and the Visishtadvaitas.
 The first arguing rightly that Parabrahman, having no relation,
 as the absolute <em>all</em>, to the manifested world -- the Infinite
 having no connection with the finite -- can neither <em>will</em>
 nor<em> create; </em>that, therefore, Brahma, Mahat, Iswara, or
 whatever name the creative power may be known by, creative gods
 and all, are simply an illusive aspect of Parabrahmam in the conception
 of the conceivers; while the other sects identify the impersonal
 Cause with the Creator, or Iswara.
 </p><p>
 <em>Mahat </em>(or Maha-Buddhi) is, with the Vaishnavas, however,
 divine mind <em>in active operation</em>,<em> </em>or, as Anaxagoras
 has it, "an ordering and disposing mind, which was the cause
 of all things," -- [[<em>Nous o diakosmonte kai panton aitios</em>]].
 </p><p>
 Wilson saw at a glance the suggestive connection between <em>Mahat
 </em>and the Phoenician Mot, or <em>Mut</em>,<em> </em>who was
 female with the Egyptians -- the Goddess Mout, the "Mother"
 -- "which, like Mahat," he says, "was the first
 product of the mixture (?) of Spirit and matter, and the first
 rudiment of Creation": "Ex connexione autem ejus spiritus
 prodidit Mot . . . . . From whose seed were created all living
 things" -- repeats Brucker (I., 240) -- giving it a still
 more materialistic and anthropomorphic colouring.
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, the esoteric sense of the doctrine is seen through
 every exoteric sentence on the very face of the old Sanscrit texts
 that treat of primordial Creation. "The Supreme Soul, the
 <em>all permeant </em>(Sarvaga) Substance of the World, having
 entered (<em>been drawn</em>)<em> </em>into matter (prakriti)
 and Spirit (purusha), <em>agitated</em> the <em>mutable and the
 immutable principles </em>the season of Creation (manvantara)
 having arrived."* . . .
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The <em>nous </em>of the Greeks, which is (spiritual or divine)
 mind, or<em> mens</em>, "Mahat," operates upon matter
 in the same way; it "enters into" and <em>agitates</em>
 it:
 </p><blockquote>
 "Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus,<br>
 Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet."
 </blockquote>

 In the Phoenician Cosmogony, "Spirit mixing with its own
 principles gives rise to [[Footnote continued on next page]]

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 452 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Esoteric doctrine teaches that the Dhyan Chohans are the collective
 aggregate of divine Intelligence or primordial <em>mind</em>,
 and that the first Manus -- the seven "mind-born" Spiritual
 Intelligences -- are identical with the former. Hence the "Kwan-shi-yin"
 -- "the golden Dragon in whom are the seven," of Stanza
 III. -- is the primordial Logos, or Brahma, the first manifested
 creative Power; and the Dhyani-Energies are the Manus, or <em>Manu-Swayambhuva
 collectively. </em>The direct connection, moreover, between the
 "Manus" and "Mahat" is easy to see. <em>Manu
 </em>is from the root <em>man</em>,<em> </em>"to think";
 and thinking proceeds from the mind. It is, in Cosmogony, the
 pre-nebular period.
 </p><p>
 (II.) "The<em> second </em>Creation," "Bhuta,"
 was of the rudimental principles (Tanmatras), thence termed the
 elemental creation (<em>Bhuta-sarga</em>)<em>.* </em>It is the
 period of the first breath of the differentiation of the <em>pre-Cosmic
 </em>Elements or matter. <em>Bhutadi</em> means literally "the
 origin of the Elements," and precedes <em>Bhuta-sarga</em>
 --<em> </em>the "creation" or differentiation of those
 Elements in primordial "Akasa" (Chaos or Vacuity).**
 In the "Vishnu Purana" it is said to proceed along,
 and belong to, the triple aspect of <em>Ahankara</em>,<em> </em>translated
 Egotism, but meaning rather that untranslateable term the "<strong>I</strong>-AM-NESS,"
 that which first issues from "Mahat," or divine mind;
 the first shadowy outline of Self-hood, for "pure" Ahankara
 becomes "passionate" and finally "rudimental"

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] creation" also;
 (<em>Brucker</em>, I.,<em> </em>240); the Orphic triad shows an
 identical doctrine: for there <em>Phanes </em>(or Eros), <em>Chaos</em>,<em>
 </em>containing crude <em>undifferentiated </em>Cosmic matter,
 and <em>Chronos </em>(time), are the three co-operating principles,
 emanating from the Unknowable and concealed <em>point</em>, which
 produce the work of "Creation." And they are the Hindu
 <em>Purusha </em>(phanes), <em>Pradhana</em> (chaos), and <em>Kala</em>
 (Chronos) or <em>time. </em>The good Professor Wilson does not
 like the idea, as no Christian clergyman, however liberal, would.
 He remarks that "as presently explained,. the <em>mixture
 </em>(of the <em>Supreme </em>Spirit or Soul) <em>is not mechanical;
 </em>it is <em>an influence or effect exerted upon intermediate
 agents </em>which produce effects." The sentence in <em>Vishnu
 Purana: </em>"As fragrance affects the mind from its proximity
 merely, <em>and not from any immediate operation upon mind itself</em>,<em>
 </em>so the Supreme influenced the elements of creation,"
 the reverend and erudite Sanscritist correctly explains . . .
 : "As perfumes do not delight the mind by actual contact,
 but by the impression they make upon the sense of smelling, which
 communicates it to the mind," adding: "The entrance
 of the <em>Supreme </em>into spirit, as well as matter, <em>is
 less intelligible </em>than the view elsewhere taken of it, as
 the <em>infusion </em>of spirit, identified with the supreme,
 into Prakriti or matter alone." He prefers the verse in <em>Padma
 Purana: </em>"He who is called the <em>male</em> (spirit)
 of Prakriti . . . that same divine Vishnu entered into Prakriti."
 This "view" is certainly more akin to the plastic character
 of certain verses in the Bible concerning the Patriarchs, such
 as Lot (<em>Gen. xix.</em>,<em> </em>34-38) and even Adam (<em>iv</em>.,
 <em>v. </em>1), and others of a still more anthropomorphic nature.
 But it is just that which led Humanity to <em>Phallicism</em>,<em>
 </em>Christian religion being honeycombed with it, from the first
 chapter of <em>Genesis </em>down to the <em>Revelation.</em>

 <p>
 (initial); it is "the origin of conscious as of all <em>unconscious
 </em>being," though the Esoteric school rejects the idea
 of anything being "unconscious" -- save on this (our)
 plane of illusion and ignorance. At this stage of the Second Creation,
 the second hierarchy of the Manus appear, the Dhyan Chohans or
 Devas, who are the origin of Form (rupa): the <em>Chitrasikhandina
 </em>(bright-crested) or the <em>Riksha</em> --<em> </em>those
 Rishis who have become the informing souls of the seven stars
 (of the Great Bear).* In astronomical and Cosmogonical language
 this Creation relates to the first stage of Cosmic-life, the <em>Fire-Mist
 </em>Period after its Chaotic stage,** when atoms issue from <em>Laya.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 (III.) The third (the <em>Indriya</em>)<em> </em>was the modified
 form of <em>Ahankara</em>, the conception of "I," (from
 "<em>Aham</em>,"<em> </em>"I") termed the
 organic Creation, or creation of the senses (<em>Aindriyaka</em>)<em>.
 </em>"These three were the Prakrita creation, the (discrete)
 developments of indiscrete nature preceded by the indiscrete principle."
 "Preceded by," ought to be replaced here with "beginning
 by," Buddhi; for the latter is neither a discrete nor an
 <em>indiscrete quantity</em>,<em> </em>but partakes of the nature
 of both, in man as in Kosmos: a unit -- a human MONAD on the plane
 of illusion -- when once freed from the three forms of Ahankara
 and liberated from its terrestrial manas, Buddhi becomes truly
 a continued quantity, both in duration and extension, because

 Creation "abounding with the quality of goodness, is termed
 <em>Urdhvasrotas</em>";<em> </em>and a page or two further
 the <em>Urdhvasrotas </em>creation<em> </em>is referred to as
 "the sixth creation . . . that of the divinities" (p.

 have been purposely confused, to prevent the pro-

 ** From the first, the Orientalists have found themselves beset
 by great difficulties with regard to any possible order in the
 Puranic <em>Creations. </em>Brahma is very often confused with
 Brahm, by Wilson, for which he is criticised by his successors.
 The "<em>Original Sanscrit Texts</em>"<em> </em>are
 preferred by Mr. Fitzedward Hall for the translation of <em>Vishnu
 Purana </em>and texts, to those used by Wilson. "Had Professor
 Wilson enjoyed the advantages which are now at the command of
 the student of Indian philosophy, unquestionably he would have
 expressed himself differently," as said by the editor of
 his works. This reminds one of the answer given by one of Thomas
 Taylor's admirers to those scholars who criticised his translations
 of Plato. "Thomas Taylor may have had less knowledge of the
 Greek than his critics have, but he understood Plato far better
 than they do," he said. Our present Orientalists disfigure
 the <em>mystic </em>sense of the Sanskrit texts far more than
 Wilson ever did, though the latter is undeniably guilty of very
 gross errors.</p><hr>

 <p>
 fane from perceiving the truth. This is called "incongruity"
 and "contradictions" by the Orientalists.*
 </p><p>
 This "creation" of the immortals, the "<em>Deva-Sarga</em>,"<em>
 </em>is the last of the first series, and has a universal reference;
 namely, to Evolutions in general, not specifically to our <em>Manvantara</em>;
 but the latter begins with the same over and over again, showing
 that it refers to several distinct Kalpas. For it is said "at
 the close of the past (<em>Padma</em>)<em> </em>Kalpa the divine
 Brahma awoke from his night of sleep and beheld the universe void."
 Then Brahma is shown going once more over the "seven creations"
 in the secondary stage of evolution, repeating the first three
 on the objective plane.
 </p><p>
 (IV.) The <em>Mukhya</em>,<em> </em>the Primary as it begins the
 series of four. Neither the word "inanimate" bodies
 nor yet <em>immovable </em>things, as translated by Wilson, gives
 a correct idea of the Sanskrit terms used. Esoteric philosophy
 is not the only one to reject the idea of any atom being <em>inorganic</em>,<em>
 </em>for it is found also in orthodox Hinduism. Moreover, Wilson
 himself says (<em>in his collected Works</em>,<em> vol. iii.</em>,<em>
 p. </em>381): "All the Hindu systems consider vegetable bodies
 as endowed with life . . . "<em> Charachara</em>,<em> </em>or
 the synonymous <em>sthavara </em>and<em> jangama</em>,<em> </em>is,
 therefore, inaccurately rendered by "animate and inanimate,"
 "sentient beings," and "unconscious," or "conscious
 and unconscious beings," etc., etc. "Locomotive and
 fixed" would be better, since trees are considered to possess
 souls." <em>Mukhya </em>is the "creation" or organic
 evolution of the vegetable kingdom. In this <em>secondary </em>Period,
 the three degrees of Elemental or Rudimental Kingdoms are evolved
 in this world, corresponding <em>inversely </em>in order to the
 three Prakritic creations during the Primary period of Brahma's
 activity. As in that period, in the words of "Vishnu Purana":
 "The first creation was that of <em>Mahat </em>(Intellect),
 the second, of<em> Tanmatras </em>(rudimental principles), and
 the third, that of the senses (Aindriyaka)"; in this one,
 the order of the Elemental Forces stands thus: (1) The<em> nascent
 </em>centres of Force (intellectual and physical); (2) the rudimental
 principles -- <em>nerve force</em>,<em> </em>so to say; and (3)
 nascent <em>apperception</em>,<em> </em>which is the <em>Mahat
 </em>of the lower kingdoms, especially developed in the third
 order of Elementals; these are succeeded by the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * "The three Creations beginning with Intelligence are elemental,
 but the six creations which proceed from the series of which Intellect
 is the first are the work of Brahma" (<em>Vayu-Purana</em>).
 Here "creations" mean everywhere <em>stages </em>of
 Evolution. <em>Mahat</em>,<em> </em>"Intellect" or <em>mind</em>
 (which corresponds with Manas, the former being on the Cosmic,
 and the latter on the human plane) stands here, too, lower than
 <em>Buddhi </em>or Supra-divine Intelligence. Therefore, when
 we read in <em>Linga Purana </em>that "the first Creation
 was that of Mahat, Intellect being the first in manifestation,"
 we must refer that (specified) creation to the first evolution
 of our system or even our Earth, none of the preceding ones being
 discussed in the <em>Puranas</em>,<em> </em>but only occasionally
 hinted at.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 455 CREATIONS CONTINUED.</h6>
 
 <p>
 objective kingdom of minerals, in which latter that apperception
 is entirely latent, to re-develop only in the plants). The <em>mukhya
 </em>"Creation," then, is the middle point between the
 three lower and the three higher kingdoms, which represent the
 seven esoteric kingdoms of Kosmos, as of Earth.
 </p><p>
 (V.) The <em>Tiryaksrotas </em>(or Tairyagyonya) creation,* that
 of the "(<em>sacred</em>)<em> </em>animals," corresponding
 only on Earth, to the dumb animal creation. That which is meant
 by "animals," in <em>primary </em>Creation, is the germ
 of awakening consciousness or of <em>apperception</em>,<em> </em>that
 which is faintly traceable in some sensitive plants on Earth and
 more distinctly in the <em>protistic </em>monera.** On our globe,
 during the first round, animal "creation" precedes that
 of man, while the former (or mammal) evolves from the latter in
 our fourth round -- on the physical plane: in Round I. the animal
 atoms are drawn into a cohesion of human physical form; while
 in Round IV. the reverse occurs according to magnetic conditions
 developed during life. And this is <em>metempsychosis </em>(<em>See
 </em>"<em>Mineral Monad</em>"<em> in </em>"<em>Five
 Years of Theosophy</em>,"<em> p. </em>276). This fifth stage
 of evolution, called exoterically "Creation," may be
 viewed in both the <em>Primary </em>and<em> Secondary </em>periods,
 one as the Spiritual and Cosmic, the other as the material and
 <em>terrestrial. </em>It is <em>Archibiosis</em>,<em> </em>or
 life-origination -- "origination," so far, of course,
 as the <em>manifestation </em>of life on all the seven planes
 is concerned. It is at this period of Evolution that the <em>absolutely
 eternal </em>universal motion, or vibration, that which is called
 in Esoteric language "the GREAT BREATH," differentiates
 in the primordial, first manifested ATOM. More and more, as chemical
 and physical sciences progress, does this occult axiom find its
 corroboration in the world of knowledge: the scientific hypothesis,
 that even the simplest elements of matter are identical in nature
 and differ from each other only owing to the variety of the distributions
 of <em>atoms </em>in the molecule or speck of substance, or by
 the modes of its <em>atomic vibration</em>,<em> </em>gains every
 day more ground.
 </p><p>
 Thus, as the differentiation of the primordial germ of life has
 to precede the evolution of the Dhyan Chohan of <em>the third
 </em>group or hierarchy of Being in Primary Creation, before those
 "gods" can become rupa (embodied in their first ethereal
 form), so animal creation has to <em>precede</em>,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Professor Wilson translates it, as though animals were higher
 on the scale of "creation" than divinities, or angels,
 although the truth about the devas is very plainly stated further
 on. This "creation," says the text, is both primary
 (<em>Prakrita</em>) and secondary (<em>Vaikrita</em>)<em>. </em>It
 is the latter, as regards the origin of the gods from Brahma (the<em>
 personal</em> anthropomorphic <em>creator</em> of our material
 universe); it is the former (<em>primary</em>)<em> </em>as affecting
 Rudra, who is the immediate production of the first principle.
 Rudra is not alone a title of Siva, but embraces agents of creation,
 angels and men, as will be shown further on.

 why we find in the Puranas: "The fifth, the Tairyagyonya
 creation, was that of animals, and --

 (VI). The Urdhvasrotas creation, or that of divinities (<em>Vishnu
 Purana Book I. chap. i.</em>)<em>. </em>But these (divinities)
 are simply the prototypes of the First Race, the fathers of their
 "mind-born" progeny with the <em>soft </em>bones.* It
 is these who became the <em>Evolvers </em>of the "Sweat-born"
 -- an expression explained in Book II. Finally, the sixth "Creation"

 (VII.) The evolution of the "<em>Arvaksrotas </em>beings,
 which was the seventh, and was that of man" (<em>Vishnu Purana</em>,<em>

 </p><p>
 The "eighth creation" mentioned is no <em>Creation </em>at
 all; it is a <em>blind </em>again, for it refers to a purely mental
 process: the cognition of the "ninth" creation, which,
 in its turn, is an effect, manifesting in the <em>secondary </em>of
 that which was a "Creation" in the <em>Primary </em>(<em>Prakrita</em>)<em>
 </em>Creation.** The <em>Eighth</em>,<em> </em>then, called <em>Anugraha
 </em>(the<em> Pratyayasarga </em>or the <em>intellectual </em>creation
 of the Sankhyas, explained in <em>Karika</em>,<em> </em>v. 46,
 p. 146), is "that creation of which <em>we have a perception</em>"
 -- in its esoteric aspect -- and "to which we give intellectual
 assent (Anugraha) in contradistinction to <em>organic creation.</em>"<em>
 </em>It is the correct perception of our relations to the whole
 range of "gods" and especially of those we bear to the
 <em>Kumaras</em> --<em> </em>the so-called "Ninth Creation"
 -- which is in reality an aspect of or reflection of the sixth
 in our manvantara (the Vaivasvata). "There is a <em>ninth</em>,<em>
 </em>the Kumara Creation, which is both primary and secondary,"
 says <em>Vishnu Purana</em>,<em> </em>the oldest of such texts.***
 "The <em>Kumaras</em>,"<em> </em>explains an <em>esoteric</em>
 text,

 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * "Created beings" -- explains <em>Vishnu Purana</em>
 --<em> </em>"although they are destroyed (in their individual
 forms) at the periods of dissolution, yet being affected by the
 good or evil acts of former <em>existences</em>,<em> </em>are
 never exempted from their consequences. And when Brahma produces
 the world anew, they are the progeny of his will . . ." "<em>Collecting
 his mind into itself </em>(<em>Yoga </em>willing), Brahma creates
 the four orders of beings, termed gods, demons, <em>progenitors</em>,<em>
 </em>and<em> MEN</em>"<em> . </em>. . "progenitors"
 meaning the prototypes and Evolvers of the first Root Race of
 men. The progenitors are the Pitris, and are of seven classes.
 They are said in <em>exoteric </em>mythology to be born of <em>Brahma</em>'<em>s
 side</em>,<em> </em>like Eve from the rib of Adam.
 </p><p>
 ** "These notions," remarks Dr. Wilson, "the birth
 of Rudra and the saints, seem to have been <em>borrowed </em>from
 the Saivas, and to have been awkwardly engrafted upon the Vaishnava
 system." The esoteric meaning ought to have been consulted
 before venturing such a hypothesis.

 from Pulastya and taught it to Maitreya, is placed by the Orientalists
 at various epochs. As correctly observed, in the <em>Hindu Class.

 575 <b>B.C.</b> to 1391 <b>B.C</b>., and <em>cannot be trusted.</em>"<em>
 </em>Quite so; but no less, however, than any other date as assigned
 by the Sanskritists, so famous in this department of arbitrary
 fancy.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 457 WHO THE KUMARAS ARE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "are the Dhyanis, derived immediately from the supreme Principle,
 who reappear in the Vaivasvata Manu period, for the progress of
 mankind."* The commentator of the <em>Vishnu Purana </em>corroborates
 it, by remarking that "these <em>sages </em>live as long
 as Brahma; and they are only created by him in the <em>first </em>Kalpa,
 although their generation is very commonly and inconsistently
 introduced in the <em>Varaha</em>,<em> </em>or<em> Padma </em>Kalpa"
 (the secondary). Thus, the Kumaras are, exoterically, "the
 creation of Rudra or Nilalohita, a form of Siva, by Brahma, and
 of certain other mind-born sons of Brahma. But, in the esoteric
 teaching, they are the progenitors of the true spiritual SELF
 in the physical man -- the higher Prajapati, while the Pitris,
 or lower Prajapati, are no more than the <em>fathers </em>of the
 model, or type of his physical form, made "in <em>their </em>image."
 Four (and occasionally <em>five</em>) are mentioned freely in
 the exoteric texts, three Kumaras being secret.** (Compare what
 is said of "The Fallen Angels" in Book II.).
 </p><p>
 The Exoteric four are: Sanat-Kumara, Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanatana;
 and the esoteric three are: Sana, Kapila, and Sanat-sujata. Special
 attention is once more drawn to this class of Dhyan Chohans, for
 herein lies the mystery of generation and heredity hinted at in
 Book I. (<em>See the four Orders of Angelic Beings; Comment on
 Stanza VII.</em>)<em>. </em>Book II. explains their position in
 the divine Hierarchy. Meanwhile, let us see what the <em>exoteric
 </em>texts say about them.
 </p><p>
 They do not say much; nothing to him who fails to read between
 the lines. "We must have recourse, here, to other Puranas
 for the elucidation of this term," remarks Wilson, who does
 not suspect for one moment that he is in the presence of the "Angels
 of Darkness," the mythical "great enemy" of his
 Church. Therefore, he contrives to <em>elucidate </em>no more
 than that these (divinities) DECLINING TO CREATE PROGENY*** (and
 thus rebelling against Brahma), remained, as the name

 <p>
 * They may indeed mark a "special" or extra <em>creation</em>,<em>
 </em>since it is they who, by incarnating themselves within the
 senseless human shells of the two first Root-races, and a great
 portion of the Third Root-race -- create, so to speak, a <em>new
 race: </em>that of thinking, self-conscious and <em>divine </em>men.
 </p><p>
 ** "The four Kumaras (are) the mind-born Sons of Brahma.
 Some <em>specify seven</em>"<em> </em>(<em>H. Class. Dict.</em>)<em>.
 </em>All these seven Vaidhatra, the patronymic of the Kumaras,
 "the Maker's Sons," are mentioned and described in Iswara
 Krishna's "Sankhya Karika" with the Commentary of Gaudapadacharya
 (Sankaracharya's <em>Paraguru</em>) attached to it. It discusses
 the nature of the Kumaras, though it refrains from mentioning
 <em>by name </em>all the seven Kumaras, but calls them instead
 "the seven sons of Brahma," which they are, as they
 are created by Brahma in Rudra. The list of names it gives us
 is: Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, Kapila, Ribhu, and Panchasikha.
 But these are again all <em>aliases.</em> 
 </p><p>
 *** So untrustworthy are some translations of the Orientalists
 that in the French Translation of <em>Hari-Vamsa</em>,<em> </em>it
 is said "The seven Prajapati, Rudra, Skanda (his son) [[Footnote

 of the first implies, ever boys, Kumaras: that is, ever pure and
 innocent, whence their creation is also called the "Kumara."
 (<em>Book I. chap. v.</em>,<em> Vishnu Purana.</em>)<em> </em>The
 Puranas, however, may afford a little more light. "Being
 ever as he was born, he is here called a youth; and hence his
 name is well known as Sanat-Kumara" (<em>Linga purana</em>,<em>
 prior section LXX. </em>174.) In the <em>Saiva Purana</em>,<em>
 </em>the Kumaras are always described as Yogins. The Kurma Purana,
 after enumerating them, says: "These five, O Brahmans, were
 Yogins, who acquired entire exemption from passion." They
 are <em>five</em>, because two of the Kumaras <em>fell</em>.
 </p><p>
 Of all the seven great divisions of Dhyan-Chohans, or Devas, there
 is none with which humanity is more concerned than with the Kumaras.
 Imprudent are the Christian Theologians who have degraded them
 into <em>fallen </em>Angels, and now call them "Satan"
 and Demons; as among these heavenly denizens who <em>refuse to
 create</em>,<em> </em>the Archangel Michael -- the greatest patron
 Saint of Western and Eastern Churches, under his double name of
 St. Michael and his supposed copy on earth, St. George conquering
 the <strong>D</strong>RAGON -- has to be allowed one of the most
 prominent places. (See Book II., "The Sacred Dragons and
 their Slayers.")

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] and Sanat-Kumara proceeded
 to create beings." Whereas, as Wilson shows, the original
 is: "These seven . . . created progeny; and so did Rudra,
 but Skanda and Sanat Kumara, <em>restraining their power</em>,<em>
 abstained </em>from creation." The "four orders of beings"
 are referred to sometimes as "Ambhamsi," which Wilson
 renders: "literally Waters," and believes it "a
 mystic term." It is one, no doubt; but he evidently failed
 to catch the <em>real </em>esoteric meaning. "Waters"
 and "water" stand as the symbol for Akasa, the "primordial
 Ocean of Space," on which Narayana, the self-born Spirit,
 moves: reclining on that <em>which is its progeny </em>(<em>See
 Manu</em>)<em>. </em>"Water is the body of Nara; thus we
 have heard the name of water explained. Since <em>Brahma </em>rests
 on the water, therefore he is termed <em>Narayana</em>"<em>
 </em>(<em>Linga</em>,<em> Vayu</em>,<em> and Markandeya Puranas</em>)<em>
 </em>". . . Pure, Purusha created the Waters pure . . ."
 at the same time Water is the third principle in material Kosmos,
 and the third in the realm of the Spiritual: <em>Spirit </em>of
 Fire, Flame, Akasa, Ether, Water, Air, Earth, are the cosmic,
 sidereal, psychic, spiritual and mystic principles, <em>pre-eminently
 occult</em>,<em> </em>in every <em>plane </em>of being. "Gods,
 Demons, Pitris and men," are the four orders of beings to
 whom the term Ambhamsi is applied (in the Vedas it is a synonym
 of gods): because they are all the product of WATERS (mystically),
 of the Akasic Ocean, and of the Third Principle in nature. Pitris
 and men on earth are the transformations (rebirths) of gods and
 demons (Spirits) on a higher plane. Water is, in another sense,
 the feminine principle. Venus Aphrodite is the personified Sea,
 and the mother of the god of love, the generator of all the gods
 as much as the Christian Virgin Mary is Mare (the sea), the mother
 of the Western God of Love, Mercy and Charity. If the student
 of Esoteric philosophy thinks deeply over the subject he is sure
 to find out all the suggestiveness of the term Ambhamsi, in its
 manifold relations to the Virgin in Heaven, to the Celestial Virgin
 of the Alchemists, and even to the "Waters of Grace"
 of the modern Baptist.</p><hr>

 the howling and terrific <em>destroyer of human passions and physical
 senses</em>,<em> </em>which are ever in the way of the development
 of the higher spiritual perceptions and the growth of the <em>inner</em>
 eternal man -- mystically,* are the progeny of Siva, the <em>Mahayogi</em>,<em>
 </em>the great patron of all the Yogis and mystics of India. They
 themselves, being the "Virgin-Ascetics," refuse to create
 the <em>material </em>being MAN. Well may they be suspected of
 a direct connection with the Christian Archangel Michael, the
 "Virgin Combatant" of the Dragon <em>Apophis</em>,<em>
 </em>whose<em> </em>victim is every soul united too loosely to
 its immortal Spirit, the Angel who, as shown by the Gnostics,
 <em>refused to create </em>just as the Kumaras did. (<em>See Book
 II.</em>,<em> </em>"<em>The Mystic Dragons and their Slayers.</em>")<em>
 . </em>. . Does not that patron-Angel of the Jews <em>preside
 </em>over Saturn (Siva or Rudra), and the Sabbath, the day of
 Saturn? Is he not shown of the same essence with his father (Saturn),
 and called the "Son of Time,"<em> Kronos</em>,<em> or
 Kala </em>(time), a form of Brahma (Vishnu and Siva)?" And
 is not "Old Time" of the Greeks, with its scythe and
 sand-glass, identical with the "Ancient of Days" of
 the Kabalists, the latter "Ancient" being one with the
 Hindu "Ancient of Days," Brahma (in his<em> triune </em>form),
 whose name is also "Sanat," the Ancient? Every Kumara
 bears the prefix of <em>Sanat </em>and<em> Sana; </em>and Sanaischara
 is Saturn, the planet (Sani and Sarra), the King Saturn whose
 Secretary in Egypt was Thot-Hermes the first. They are thus identified
 both with the planet and the god (Siva), who are, in their turn,
 shown the prototypes of Saturn, who is the same as Bel, Baal,
 Siva, and Jehovah Sabbaoth, <em>The angel of whose face is </em>MIKAEL
 (<img src="sd1-434a.gif" align="MIDDLE"> "who is as God").
 He is the patron, and guardian Angel of the Jews, as Daniel tells
 us (v. 21); and, before the Kumaras were degraded, by those who
 were ignorant of their very name, into demons and fallen angels,
 the Greek Ophites, the occultly inclined predecessors and precursors
 of the Roman Catholic Church after its secession and separation
 from the primitive Greek Church, had identified Michael with their
 <em>Ophiomorphos</em>,<em> </em>the rebellious and opposing spirit.
 This means nothing more than the reverse aspect (symbolically)
 of Ophis -- divine Wisdom or Christos. In the <em>Talmud</em>,<em>
 Mikael </em>(Michael) is "Prince of <em>Water</em>"<em>
 </em>and the chief of the seven Spirits, for the same reason that

 * Siva-Rudra is the Destroyer, as Vishnu is the preserver; and
 both are the regenerators of spiritual as well as of physical
 nature. To live as a plant, the <em>seed </em>must die. To live
 as a conscious entity in the Eternity, the passions and senses
 of man must first DIE before his body does. "To live is to
 die and to die is to live," has been too little understood
 in the West. Siva, the <em>destroyer</em>,<em> </em>is the <em>creator

 -- the chief of the Kumaras -- is called Ambhamsi, "Waters,"
 -- according to the commentary on <em>Vishnu Purana. </em>Why?
 Because the "Waters" is another name of the "Great
 Deep," the primordial Waters of space or <em>Chaos</em>,<em>
 </em>and also means "Mother," <em>Amba</em>,<em> </em>meaning
 Aditi and Akasa, the Celestial Virgin-Mother of the visible universe.
 Furthermore, the "Waters of the flood" are also called
 "the <strong>G</strong>REAT <strong>D</strong>RAGON,"
 or Ophis, Ophio-Morphos.

 The Rudras will be noticed in their Septenary character of "Fire-Spirits"
 in the "Symbolism" attached to the Stanzas in Book II.
 There we shall also consider the Cross (3 + 4) under its primeval
 and later forms, and shall use for purposes of comparison the
 Pythagorean numbers side by side with Hebrew Metrology. The immense
 importance of the number <em>seven </em>will thus become evident,
 as the root number of nature. We shall examine it from the standpoints
 of the Vedas and the Chaldean Scriptures, as it existed in Egypt
 thousands of years <b>B.C</b>., and as treated in the Gnostic
 records; we shall show how its importance as a basic number has
 gained recognition in physical Science; and we shall endeavour
 to prove that the importance attached to the number <em>seven</em>
 throughout all antiquity was due to no fanciful imaginings of
 uneducated priests, but to a profound knowledge of natural law.
