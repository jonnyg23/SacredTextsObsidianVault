 <h4>THE SYMBOLISM OF THE MYSTERY-NAMES IAO AND <br>
 JEHOVAH, WITH THEIR RELATION TO THE CROSS <br>
 AND CIRCLE.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>W</strong>HEN the Abbe Louis Constant -- known as Eliphas
 Levi -- said in his<em> Histoire de la Magie </em>that the <em>"Sepher
 Jezirah, </em>the <em>Zohar, </em>and the Apocalypse (of St. John)
 are the master-pieces of the Occult Sciences," he ought,
 if he wanted to be correct and clear, to have added, "in
 Europe." It is quite true that these works contain "more
 <em>significance</em> than words"; and that "its expression
 is poetical, while in numbers it is exact." Unfortunately,
 before any one can appreciate the <em>poetry </em>of the expressions,
 or the <em>exactness </em>of the numbers, he will have to learn
 the real significance and meaning of the terms and symbols used.
 And man will never learn this so long as he remains ignorant of
 the fundamental principle of the <em>Secret </em>Doctrine, whether
 in Oriental Esotericism, or in the Kabalistical symbology: --
 the <em>key, or value, in all their aspects,</em> <em>of the "God"-names,
 "Angel"-names, and "Patriarchal" names in
 the</em> <em>Bible </em>--<em> </em>their mathematical or geometrical
 value, and their relations to manifested nature.
 </p><p>
 Therefore, if, on the one hand, the <em>Zohar </em>"astonishes
 (the mystic) by the profundity of its views and the great simplicity
 of its images," on the other hand, that work misleads the
 student by such expressions as those used with respect to <strong>A</strong>IN-<strong>S</strong>OPH
 and <em>Jehovah, </em>notwithstanding the assurance that "the
 book is careful to explain that the human form with which it clothes
 God is but <em>an image of the word, </em>and that God should
 not be expressed by any thought, or any form." It is well
 known that Origen, Clemens, and the Rabbis confessed, with regard
 to the Kabala and the Bible, to their being <em>veiled</em> and<em>
 secret Books;</em> but few know that the esotericism of the Kabalistic
 books in their present <em>re-edited </em>form<em> </em>is simply
 another and still more cunning veil thrown upon the primitive
 symbolism of these secret volumes.
 </p><p>
 The idea of representing the <em>hidden </em>deity by the circumference
 of a Circle, and the Creative Power (male and female, or the Androgynous
 <strong>W</strong>ORD), by the diameter across it, is one of the
 oldest symbols. It is upon this conception that every great Cosmogony
 was built. With the old Aryans, the Egyptians, and the Chaldeans,
 it was complete, as it embraced the idea of the eternal and immovable
 <em>Divine Thought </em>in its absoluteness, separated entirely
 from the incipient stage of (the so-called)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 537 THE JEWS ALONE THE HEIRLOOM OF JEHOVAH.
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>creation; </em>and comprised psychological and even Spiritual
 evolution, and its mechanical work, or cosmogonical construction.
 With the Hebrews, however, though the former conception is to
 be distinctly found in the Zohar, and the Sepher Jezirah -- or
 what remains of the latter -- that which has been embodied subsequently
 in the <em>Pentateuch </em>proper, and especially in <em>Genesis,
 </em>is simply this secondary stage, to wit, the mechanical law
 of creation, or rather of construction; while theogony is hardly,
 if at all, outlined.
 </p><p>
 It is only in the first six chapters of <em>Genesis, </em>in the
 rejected <em>Book of</em> <em>Enoch, </em>and the misunderstood
 and mistranslated poem of <em>Job, </em>that true echoes of the
 archaic doctrine may now be found. The key to it is lost, even
 among the most learned Rabbis, whose predecessors in the early
 period of the middle ages have preferred, in their national exclusiveness
 and pride, and especially in their profound hatred of Christianity,
 to cast it into the deep sea of oblivion, rather than to share
 their knowledge with their relentless and fierce persecutors.
 Jehovah was their own tribal property, inseparable from, and unfit
 to play a part in, any other but the Mosaic Law. Violently torn
 out of his original frame, which he fitted and which fitted him,
 the "lord god of Abraham and Jacob" could hardly be
 crammed without damage and breakage into the new Christian Canon.
 Being the weakest, the Judeans could not help the desecration;
 but they kept the secret of the origin of their Adam Kadmon, or
 male-female Jehovah; and the new tabernacle proved a complete
 misfit for the old god: they were, indeed, avenged!
 </p><p>
 The statement that Jehovah was the tribal god of the Jews and
 no higher, will be denied like many other things. Yet the theologians
 are not in a position to tell us, in that case, the meaning of
 verses 8 and 9 in Deuteronomy, chapter xxxii. These verses say
 quite plainly: "When the <strong>M</strong>OST <strong>H</strong>IGH
 (not the "Lord," or "Jehovah" either) divided
 to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the Sons of
 Adam he set the bounds . . . according to the number of the children
 of Israel. . . . <em>The Lord's </em>(Jehovah's)<em> portion is
 his people; Jacob is the lot of his</em> <em>inheritance."
 </em>This settles the question. So impudent were the modern translators
 of Bibles and Scriptures and so damaging are these verses, that,
 following in the steps traced for them by their worthy Church
 Fathers, each translator rendered these verses in his own way.
 While the above-cited quotation is taken <em>verbatim </em>from
 the authorized English version, in the French Bible (of the <em>Protestant
 Biblical Society </em>of Paris, according to the version revised
 in 1824 by J. E. Ostervald) one finds the "Most High"
 translated by <em>Souverain </em>(a Sovereign!!), the "sons
 of Adam" rendered by "the children of men," and
 the "Lord" changed into the "Eternal." For
 impudent sleight-of-hand, the French Protestant Church seems thus
 to have surpassed even English ecclesiasticism.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 538 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Nevertheless, one thing is patent: the "Lord's ("Jehovah's")
 portion" is his "chosen people" and none else,
 for, <em>Jacob alone is the lot of his</em> <em>inheritance. </em>What,
 then, have other nations, who call themselves Aryans, to do with
 this Semitic deity, the tribal god of Israel? Astronomically,
 the "Most High" is the Sun, and the "Lord"
 is one of his seven planets, whether it be <em>Iao, </em>the genius
 of the moon, or Ilda-Baoth-Jehovah, that of Saturn, according
 to Origen and the Egyptian Gnostics.* Let the "Angel Gabriel,"
 the "Lord" of Iran, watch over his people; and Michael-Jehovah,
 over his Hebrews. These are not the gods of other nations, nor
 were they ever those of Jesus. As each Persian<em> Dev</em> is
 chained to his planet (see Origen's Copy of the Chart), so each
 Hindu Deva (a "Lord") has its allotted portion, a world,
 a planet, a nation or a race. Plurality of worlds implies plurality
 of gods. We believe in the former, and may recognize, but will
 never worship, the latter. (<em>Vide </em>Part <strong>III</strong>.,
 "On Chains of Worlds and their Plurality.")
 </p><p>
 It has been repeatedly stated in this work that every religious
 and philosophical symbol had seven meanings attached to it, each
 pertaining to its legitimate plane of thought,<em> i.e.</em>,
 either purely metaphysical or astronomical; psychic or physiological,
 etc., etc. These seven meanings and their applications are hard
 enough to learn when taken by themselves; but the interpretation
 and the right comprehension of them become tenfold more puzzling,
 when, instead of being correlated, or made to flow consecutively
 out of and to follow each other, each, or any one of these meanings
 is accepted as the one and sole explanation of the whole symbolical
 idea. An instance may be given, as it admirably illustrates the
 statement. Here are two interpretations given by two learned Kabalists
 and scholars, of one and the same verse in <em>Exodus, </em>xxxiii,
 18-23. Moses beseeches the Lord to show him his "glory."
 Evidently it is not the crude dead letter phraseology as found
 in the Bible that is to be accepted. There are <em>seven</em>
 meanings in the Kabala, of which we may give two as interpreted
 by the said two scholars. One of them quotes, while explaining:
 "Thou canst not see my face . . . I will put thee in the
 cleft of the rock . . . cover thee with my hand while I pass by.
 And then I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my <em>a'hoor,
 </em>my back; . . " and tells us in a gloss, "That is,
 I will show you 'My back,'<em> i.e.</em>, my visible universe,
 my lower manifestations, but, as a man still in the flesh, thou
 canst not

 <p>
 * With the Egyptian Gnostics it was Thoth (Hermes), who was chief
 of the Seven (<em>Vide</em> "Book of the Dead"). Their
 names are given by Origen, as <em>Adonai</em> (of the Sun) <em>Iao
 </em>(of the Moon),<em> Eloi</em> (Jupiter)<em>, Sabao </em>(Mars)<em>,
 Orai </em>(Venus), <em>Astapkoi </em>(Mercury), and, finally,
 <em>Ildabaoth </em>(Saturn).</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 539 A GROTESQUE VERSE EXPLAINED. </h6>
 
 <p>
 see my invisible nature. So proceeds the Qabbalah." This
 is correct, and is the cosmo-metaphysical explanation. And now
 speaks the other Kabalist, giving the numerical meaning. As it
 involves a good many suggestive ideas, and is far more fully given,
 we may allow it more space. This synopsis is from an unpublished
 <strong>MS</strong>., and explains more fully what was given in
 ยง <strong>XVII</strong>, "The Holy of Holies,"
 page 467.
 </p><p>
 The numbers of the name Moses are those of "<strong>I</strong>
 AM THAT <strong>I</strong> AM," so that the names Moses and
 Jehovah are at one in numerical harmony.
 </p><p>
 The word Moses is <img src="sd2-539.gif" align="BOTTOM"> and the
 sum of the values of its letters is 345; Jehovah -- the genius
 <em>par excellence </em>of the lunar year -- assumes the value
 of 543, or the reverse of 345. . . . In the third chapter of Exodus,
 in the 13th and 14th verses, it is said: And Moses said . . .
 Behold when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say
 unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and
 they shall say, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?
 and God said unto Moses -- "I am that I am."
 </p><p>
 The Hebrew words for this expression are <em>ahiye asher ahiye,
 </em>and in the value of the sums of their letters stand thus:--
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-468e.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 . . . This being his (God's) name, the sum of the values composing
 it are 21, 501, 21<em> </em>are 543, or simply a use of the simple
 digit numbers in the name of Moses . . . but now so ordered that
 the name of 345 is reversed, and reads 543. . . . So that when
 Moses asks "Let me see Thy face or glory," the other
 rightly and truly replies "Thou canst not see my face"
 . . . but thou <em>shalt see me behind -- </em>(the true sense,
 though not the precise words); because the comer and the <em>behind
 </em>of 543 is the <em>face </em>of 345 -- "for check and
 to keep a <em>strict use </em>of a set of numbers to develop certain
 <em>grand</em> results, for the object of which they are specifically
 employed." "In other uses," adds the learned Kabalist,
 "of the number they saw each other face to face. It is strange
 that if we add 345 to 543 we have 888, which was the gnostic Kabalistic
 value of the name Christ, who was Jehoshua or Joshua. And so also
 the division of the 24 hours of the day gives three eights as
 quotient. . . . The chief end of all this system of number checks
 was to preserve in perpetuity the exact value of the Lunar year
 in the natural measure of days."
 </p><p>
 This is the astronomical and numerical meaning in the secret theogony
 of sidereo-cosmical gods invented by the Chaldeo-Hebrews,

 <p>
 and two meanings out of seven. The other five would astonish the
 Christians still more.
 </p><p>
 The series of OEdipuses who have endeavoured to interpret the
 riddle of the Sphinx, is long indeed. For many ages she has been
 devouring the brightest and the noblest intellects of Christendom;
 but now the Sphinx is conquered. In the great intellectual struggle
 which has ended in the complete victory of the OEdipuses of Symbolism,
 it is not the Sphinx, however, who, burning with the shame of
 defeat, has had to bury herself in the sea, but verily the many-sided
 symbol, named Jehovah, whom Christians -- the <em>civilized </em>nations
 -- have accepted for their God. The latter has collapsed under
 the too close analysis, and is -- drowned. Symbologists have discovered
 with dismay that their adopted deity was only a mask for many
 other gods, an <em>Euhemerized </em>extinct planet, at best, the
 genius of the Moon and Saturn with the Jews, of the Sun and Jupiter,
 with early Christians; that the Trinity was, in truth, only an
 astronomical triad -- unless they accepted the more abstract and
 metaphysical meanings given to it by the Gentiles -- composed
 of the Sun (the Father), and the two planets Mercury (the Son)
 and Venus (the Holy Ghost<em>, Sophia, </em>the Spirit of Wisdom,
 Love and Truth, and Lucifer, as Christ, the bright and morning
 Star; <em>vide "Revelation," ch. </em>xxii., 15). Because,
 if the Father is the Sun (the elder Brother in the Eastern <em>inner</em>
 philosophy), the nearest planet to it is Mercury (Hermes, Budha,
 Thot), the name of whose mother on Earth was Maia; the planet
 which receives seven times more light than any other: which fact
 led the Gnostics to call their Christos, and the Kabalists their
 Hermes (in the astronomical meaning), the "seven-fold light"
 (<em>vide at end of this </em>ยง)<em>. </em>Finally, <em>this
 </em>God was Bel; the Sun being "Bel," with the Gauls,
 "Helios" with the Greeks, "Baal," with the
 Phoenicians; "El" in Chaldean, hence "EL-ohim,"
 "Emanu-EL,"<em> El</em>, "god," in Hebrew.
 But even the Kabalistic god has vanished in the rabbinical workmanship,
 and one has now to turn to the innermost metaphysical sense of
 the <em>Zohar </em>to find in it anything like Ain-Soph, the nameless
 deity and the Absolute, so authoritatively and loudly claimed
 by the Christians. But it is certainly not to be found in the
 Mosaic books, by those who try to read without a Key to them.
 Ever since it was lost Jews and Christians have tried their best
 to blend these two conceptions, but in vain. They have only succeeded
 in finally robbing even the Universal Deity of <strong>I</strong>TS
 majestic character and primitive meaning.
 </p><p>
 This is what was said in <em>"Isis Unveiled"</em><i>:</i><em>
 -</em>-
 </p><blockquote>
 It would seem, therefore, but natural to make a difference between
 the mystery-god [[<i>Iao</i>]], adopted from the highest antiquity
 by all who participated in the esoteric knowledge of the priests,
 and his phonetic counterparts, whom we find treated with so little
 reverence by the Ophites and other Gnostics. 
 </blockquote>
 <hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 541 THE ANTIQUITY OF THE CROSS. </h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 In the Ophite gems of King ("Gnostics") we find the
 name of <strong>IAO </strong>repeated, and often confounded with
 that of <em>Jevo, </em>while the latter simply represents one
 of the genii antagonistic to Abraxas. But the name <strong>IAO</strong>
 neither originated with, nor was it the sole property of the Jews.
 Even if it had pleased Moses to bestow the name upon the tutelary
 "Spirit," the alleged protector and national deity of
 the "chosen people of Israel," there is yet no possible
 reason why other nationalities should receive Him as the Highest
 and One-living God. But we deny the assumption altogether. Besides,
 there is the fact that Jaho or Iao was a "Mystery name"
 from the beginning, for <img src="sd2-541a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 and <img src="sd1-355a.gif" align="BOTTOM"> never came into use
 before King David. Anterior to his time, few or no proper names
 were compounded with <em>Iah </em>or Jah. It looks rather as though
 David, being a sojourner among the Tyrians and Philistines (2
 Samuel), brought thence the name of Jehovah. He made Zadok high
 priest, from whom came the Zadokites or Sadducees. He lived and
 ruled first at Hebron <img src="sd2-541b.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 Habir-on or Kabeir-town, where the rites of the four (mystery-gods)
 were celebrated. Neither David nor Solomon recognized either Moses
 or the law of Moses. They aspired to build a temple to <img src="sd1-355b.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 like the structures erected by Hiram to Hercules and Venus, Adon
 and Astarte.
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 Says Furst: "The very ancient name of God, Yaho, written
 in the Greek law, appears, apart <em>from its derivation, </em>to
 have been an old mystic name of the Supreme deity of the Shemites.
 Hence it was told to Moses when he was initiated at Hor-eb --
 the <em>cave </em>-- under the direction of Jethro, the Kenite
 (or Cainite) priest of Midian. In an old religion of the Chaldeans,
 whose remains are to be found among the Neo-Platonists, the highest
 divinity, enthroned above the seven heavens, representing the
 Spiritual Light-Principle . . . . and also conceived of as Demiurgus,*
 was called [[<em>Iao</em>]](<img src="sd2-541c.gif" align="BOTTOM">),
 who was, like the Hebrew Yaha, mysterious and unmentionable, and
 whose name was communicated to the Initiated. The Phoenicians
 had a Supreme God, whose name was trilateral and <em>secret, </em>and
 he was [[<em>Iao</em>]]."** (<em>Isis Unveiled</em>)<em>,
 </em>Vol.<strong> II</strong>., p. 298.)
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 The Cross, say the Kabalists, repeating the lesson of the Occultists,
 is one of the most ancient -- nay, perhaps, the <em>most </em>ancient
 of symbols. This is demonstrated at the very beginning of the
 <em>Proem </em>(Vol. I.). The Eastern Initiates show it coeval
 with the circle of Deific infinitude and the first differentiation
 of the Essence, the union of spirit and matter. This was rejected,
 and the astronomical allegory alone was accepted and made to fit
 into cunningly imagined terrestrial events.
 </p><p>
 Let us demonstrate this statement. In astronomy, as said, Mercury
 is the son of Coelus and Lux -- of the sky and light, or the Sun;
 in mythology he is the progeny of Jupiter and Maia. He is the
 "messenger" of his Father Jupiter, the Messiah of the
 Sun; in Greek, his name "Hermes," means, among other
 things, the "Interpreter" -- the "Word" by
 mouth; the LOGOS, or VERBUM. Now, Mercury, besides being born
 on Mount Cyllene among shepherds, is the patron of the

 * By very few though, for the creators of the material universe
 were always considered as subordinate gods to the Most High Deity.

 <p>
 latter. A psychopompic genius, he conducted the souls of the dead
 to Hades and brought them back, an office attributed to Jesus,
 after his death and resurrection. The symbols of Hermes-Mercury
 (<em>Dii</em> <em>Termini</em>)<em> </em>were placed along and
 at the turning points of highways (as crosses are now placed in
 Italy) and <em>they were cruciform.* </em>Every seventh day the
 priests anointed these <em>termini </em>with oil, and once a year
 hung them with garlands, hence they were the <em>anointed. </em>Mercury,
 when speaking through his oracles said, "I am he whom you
 call the Son of the Father (Jupiter) and Maia. Leaving the King
 of Heaven (the Sun) I come to help you, mortals." Mercury
 heals the blind and restores sight, mental and physical.** He
 was often represented as three-headed and called "Tricephalos,"
 "Triplex," as one with the Sun and Venus. Finally, Mercury,
 as Cornutus*** shows, was sometimes figured under a cubic form,
 without arms, because "the power of speech and eloquence
 can prevail without the assistance of arms or feet." It is
 this cubic form which connects the <em>termini </em>directly with
 the cross, and the eloquence or the power of speech of Mercury,
 which made the crafty Eusebius say "Hermes is the emblem
 of the Word which creates and interprets all," for it is
 the <em>creative </em>word; and he shows Porphyry teaching that
 the speech of Hermes, (now interpreted<i> </i><em>"Word of</em>
 <em>God"</em> (!)<em> </em>in Pymander) a creative speech
 (<em>Verbum</em>)<em>, </em>is the seminal principle scattered
 throughout the Universe.**** In Alchemy "Mercury" is
 the radical <em>Moyst, </em>primitive or elementary water, containing
 the seed of the Universe, fecundated by the solar fires. To express
 this fecundating principle, a phallus was often added to the cross
 (the male and female, or the vertical and the horizontal united)
 by the Egyptians (<em>Vide</em> Egyptian Museums). The cruciform
 <i>termini </i>also represented this dual idea, which was found
 in Egypt in the <em>cubic </em>Hermes. The author of "Source
 of Measures" tells us why. (But see the last page of ยง
 <strong>XVI</strong>., about the Gnostic Priapus).
 </p><p>
 As shown by him, the cube unfolded becomes in display a cross
 of the <em>tau, </em>or the Egyptian, form; or again, "the
 circle attached to the <em>tau </em>gives the ansated cross"
 of the old Pharaohs. They had known this from their priests and
 their "Kings Initiates" for ages, and also what was
 meant by "the attachment of a man to the cross," which
 idea "was made to co-ordinate with that of the origin of
 human life, and hence the <em>phallic form." </em>Only the
 latter came into action aeons and ages after the idea of the carpenter
 and artificer of the Gods,

 Visvakarma, crucifying the "Sun-Initiate" on the cruciform
 lathe. As the same author writes: <em>"the attachment of
 a man to the cross </em>. . . was made use of in this very form
 of display by the Hindus"; but, made "to co-ordinate"
 with the idea of the new rebirth of man by <em>spiritual,</em>
 not physical regeneration. The candidate for initiation was attached
 to the <em>tau</em> or astronomical cross with a far grander and
 nobler idea than that of the origin of mere <em>terrestrial</em>
 life<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 On the other hand, the Semites seem to have had no other or higher
 purpose in life than that of procreating their species. Thus,
 geometrically, and according to the reading of the Bible by means
 of the numerical method, the author of the "Hebrew-Egyptian
 Mystery" is quite correct. <em>Their </em>(the Jewish) entire
 system --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Seems to have been anciently regarded as one resting in
 nature, and one which was adopted by nature, or God, as the <em>basis
 of law </em>of the exertion practically of creative power -- <em>i.e</em>.,
 it was the <em>creative design, </em>of which creation was practically
 the application. This seems to be established by the fact that,
 under the system set forth, measures of <em>planetary times </em>serve
 coordinately as measures of the <em>size </em>of planets, and
 of the peculiarity of their shapes -- <em>i.e., </em>in the extension
 of their equatorial and polar diameters" . . . etc., etc.
 (p. 3). . . . "This system seems to underlie the whole Biblical
 structure (that of creative design), as a foundation for its <em>ritualism
 </em>and for its display of the works of the Deity in the way
 of <em>architecture, </em>by use of the sacred unit of measure
 in the Garden of Eden, the Ark of Noah, the Tabernacle, and the
 Temple of Solomon."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Thus, on the very showing of the defenders of this system the
 Jewish Deity is proved to be, at best, only the manifested <em>duad</em>,
 never the One absolute <strong>A</strong>LL. Geometrically demonstrated,
 he is a NUMBER; symbolically, an <em>euhemerized </em>Priapus;
 and this can hardly satisfy a mankind thirsting after the demonstration
 of real spiritual truths, and the possession of a god with a divine,
 not anthropomorphic, nature. It is strange that the most learned
 of modem Kabalists can see in the cross and circle nothing but
 a symbol of the manifested <em>creative </em>and <em>androgyne
 </em>deity in its relation to, and interference with, this phenomenal
 world.* One author believes that "man (read the Jew and Rabbi)
 obtained knowledge of the practical measure . . . . by which nature
 was thought to adjust the planets in size to harmonize with the
 notation of their movements" . . . . and adds: "it seems
 he did obtain it, and esteemed its possession as the means of
 his realization of the Deity -- that is, he approached <em>so
 nearly to a conception of a Being having a mind like his own,
 </em>only infinitely more powerful, as to be able to realize <em>a
 law of creation</em> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * See the <em>Zohar </em>and the two Qabbalahs (by Messrs. I.
 Myer and Mathers), with interpretations, if the reader would satisfy
 himself of this.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 544 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 established by that Being, which must have existed prior to any
 creation (Kabalistically called the <em>Word</em>)<em> "</em><i>
 </i>(<em>"Source of Measures,"</em> p<em>. </em>5).
 </p><p>
 This may have satisfied the practical <em>Semite</em> mind, but
 the Eastern Occultist has to decline the offer of <em>such </em>a
 God; indeed, a Deity, a Being, "having a mind like that of
 man, only infinitely more powerful," is <em>no</em> God that
 has any room <em>beyond </em>the cycle of creation. He has nought
 to do with the<em> ideal</em> conception of the eternal universe.
 He is, at best, one of the <em>creative subordinate </em>powers,
 the Totality of which is called the "Sephiroth," the
 "Heavenly Man," and Adam Kadmon, the <em>second</em>
 <em>logos </em>of the Platonists.
 </p><p>
 This very same idea is clearly found at the bottom of the ablest
 definitions of the Kabala and its mysteries, <em>e.g</em>., by
 John A. Parker, as quoted in the same work: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "The key of the Kabala is <em>thought to be the geometrical
 relation of the area of</em> <em>the circle inscribed in the square,
 </em>or, of the cube to the sphere, giving rise to the relation
 of diameter to circumference of a circle with the numerical value
 of this relation expressed in integrals. The relation of diameter
 to circumference, being a supreme one connected with the god-names
 of Elohim and Jehovah (which terms are expressions numerically
 of these relations respectively, the first being of circumference,
 the latter of diameter), embraces all. Two expressions of circumference
 to diameter in integrals are used in the Bible: (1) The perfect,
 and (2) the imperfect. One of the relations between these is such
 that (2) subtracted from (1) will leave a <em>unit</em> of a diameter
 value in terms, or in the denomination of the circumference value
 of the perfect circle, or a unit straight line having a perfect
 circular value, or a factor of circular value" (p. 22).
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Such calculations can lead one no further than to unriddle the
 mysteries of the <em>third </em>stage of Evolution, or the "third
 creation of Brahma." The initiated Hindus know how to "square
 the circle" far better than any European. But of this more
 anon. The fact is that the Western Mystics commence their speculation
 only at that stage when the universe "falls into matter,"
 as the occultists say. Throughout the whole series of Kabalistic
 books we have not met with one sentence that would hint in the
 remotest way at the psychological and spiritual, as well as at
 the mechanical and <em>physiological </em>secrets of "creation."
 Shall we, then, regard the evolution of the Universe as simply
 a prototype, on a gigantic scale, of the act of procreation? as
 "divine" <em>Phallicism, </em>and rhapsodize on it as
 the evilly-inspired author of a late work of this name has done?
 The writer does not think so. And she feels justified in saying
 so, since the most careful reading of the Old Testament -- esoterically,
 as well as exoterically -- seems to have carried the most enthusiastic
 enquirers no further than a certainty on mathematical grounds

 <p>
 brutal form. Thus, however interesting and ingenious the rabbinical
 methods, the writer, in common with other Eastern Occultists,
 must prefer those of the Pagans.
 </p><p>
 It is not, then, in the Bible that we have to search for the origin
 of the Cross and Circle, but beyond the Flood. Therefore, returning
 to Eliphas Levi and the Zohar, we answer for the Eastern Occultists
 and say that, applying practice to principle, they agree entirely
 with Pascal, who says that "God is a circle, the centre of
 which is everywhere and the circumference nowhere," whereas
 the Kabalists say the reverse, and maintain it solely out of their
 desire to veil their doctrine. By the way, the definition of Deity
 by the Circle is not Pascal's at all, as E. Levi thought. It was
 <em>borrowed </em>by the French philosopher from either Mercury
 Trismegistus or Cardinal Cusa's Latin work, <em>De Docta</em>
 <em>Ignorantia, </em>in which he makes use of it. It is, moreover,
 disfigured by Pascal, who replaces the words "Cosmic Circle,"
 which stand symbolically in the original inscription, by the word
 <em>Theos. </em>With the ancients both words were synonymous.

 Something of the divine and the mysterious has ever been ascribed,
 in the minds of the ancient philosophers, to the shape of the
 circle. The old world, consistent in its symbolism with its pantheistic
 intuitions, uniting the visible and the invisible Infinitudes
 into one, represented Deity and its outward VEIL alike -- by a
 circle. This merging of the two into a unity, and the name <em>theos
 </em>given indifferently to both, is explained, and becomes thereby
 still more <em>scientific </em>and philosophical. Plato's etymological
 definition of the word <em>theos </em>has been shown elsewhere.
 He derives it from the verb [[<i>theein</i>]] (see <em>Cratylus</em>)<em>,
 </em>"to move," as suggested by the motion of the heavenly
 bodies which he connects with deity. According to the Esoteric
 philosophy, this Deity is during its <em> </em>"nights"
 and its "days" (<em>i.e.</em>, cycles of rest or activity)
 "the <em>eternal</em> <em>perpetual motion," </em>"the
 EVER-BECOMING, as well as the ever universally present, and the
 ever Existing." The latter is the root-abstraction, the former
 -- the only possible conception in human mind, if it disconnects
 this deity from any shape or form. It is a perpetual, never-ceasing
 evolution, circling back in its incessant progress through aeons
 of duration into its original status -- <strong>A</strong>BSOLUTE
 <strong>U</strong>NITY.

 It was only the minor gods, who were made to carry the symbolical
 attributes of the higher ones. Thus, the god <em>Shoo, </em>the
 personification of <em>Ra, </em>who appears as "the great
 Cat of the Basin of Persea, in An"</p><hr>

 <p>
 (<em>See "Book of the Dead," Ritual </em><strong>XVII</strong>,
 45-47), was often represented in the Egyptian monuments seated,
 and holding a cross, symbol of the four quarters, or the Elements,
 attached to a Circle.
 </p><p>
 In that very learned work, "The Natural Genesis," by
 Mr. Gerald Massey, on pp. 408-455 (Vol. I.), under the heading,
 "Typology of the Cross," there is more information to
 be had on the cross and circle than in any other work we know
 of. He who would fain have proofs of the antiquity of the Cross
 is referred to these two volumes. The author shows that "the
 circle and the cross are inseparable. . . . The crux ansata unites
 the circle and cross of the four corners. From this origin they
 came to be interchangeable at times. For example, the Chakra,
 or Disk of Vishnu, is a circle. The names denote the circling,
 wheeling round, periodicity, the wheel of time. This the god uses
 as a weapon to hurl at the enemy. In like manner, Thor throws
 his weapon, the Fylfot, a form of the four-footed cross (Swastica)
 and a type of the four quarters. Thus the cross is equivalent
 to the circle of the year. . . . The wheel emblem unites the cross
 and circle in one, as does the hieroglyphic cake and the Ankh-te
 <img src="sd2-547b.gif" align="BOTTOM">."
 </p><p>
 Nor was the double glyph sacred with the profane, but only with
 the Initiates. For Raoul-Rochette shows (<em>ibid</em>)<em> </em>"the
 sign <img src="sd2-29b.gif" align="BOTTOM">, occurring as the
 <em>reverse </em>of a Phoenician coin, with a Ram as the obverse.
 . . . .The same sign, sometimes called Venus' Looking-Glass, because
 it typified reproduction, was employed to mark the hind-quarters
 of valuable brood mares of Corinthian and other beautiful breeds
 of horses" (Raoul-Rochette, loc. cit. <em>De La Croix Ansee,
 Mem. de l'Academie des</em> <em>Sciences, </em>pl.<em> </em>2,
 Nos. 8, 9, also 16, 2, p. 320, quoted in <em>"Nat. Gen."</em>)<em>,</em>
 which proves that so far back as those early days the cross had
 already become the symbol of human procreation, and that oblivion
 of the <em>divine</em> origin of Cross and Circle had been forgotten.
 </p><p>
 Another form of the cross is given from the <em>Journal of the
 Royal</em> <em>Asiatic Society </em>(vol. xviii., p. 393, pl.
 4): --
 </p><blockquote>
 "At each of the four corners is placed a quarter arc of an
 oviform curve, and when the four are put together they form an
 oval; thus the figure combines the cross with the circle round
 in four parts, corresponding to the four corners of the cross.
 The four segments answer to the four feet of the Swastica cross
 and the Fylfot of Thor. The four-leaved lotus flower of Buddha,
 is likewise figured at the centre of this cross, the lotus being
 an Egyptian and Hindu type of the four quarters. The four quarter
 arcs, if joined together, would form an ellipse, and the ellipse
 is also figured on each arm of the cross. This ellipse therefore
 denotes the path of the earth . . . . Sir J. Y. Simpson copied
 the following specimen <img src="sd2-546.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 which is here presented, as the cross of the two equinoxes and
 the two solstices placed within the figure of the earth's path.

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 547 VARIATIONS OF THE SYMBOLISM. </h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 The same ovoid or boat-shaped figure appears at times in the Hindu
 drawings with seven steps at each end as a form or a mode of Meru."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 This is the astronomical aspect of the double glyph. There are
 six more aspects, however, and an attempt may be made to interpret
 a few of these. The subject is so vast that it would require in
 itself alone many volumes.
 </p><p>
 But the most curious of these Egyptian symbols of Cross and Circle,
 spoken of in the above cited work, is one which receives its full
 explanation and final colour from Aryan symbols of the same nature.
 Says the author: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "The four-armed Cross is simply the cross of the four quarters,
 but the cross sign is not always simple.* This is a type that
 was developed from an identifiable beginning, which was adapted
 to the expression of various ideas afterwards. The most sacred
 cross of Egypt that was carried in the hands of the gods, the
 Pharaohs, and the mummied dead, is the <em>Ankh</em> <img src="sd1-5g.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 the sign of life, the living, an oath, the covenant . . . The
 top of this is the hieroglyphic Ru <img src="sd2-547a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 set upright on the Tau-Cross. The Ru is the door, gate, mouth,
 the place of outlet. This denotes the <em>birth-place </em>in
 the northern quarter of the heavens, from which the Sun is reborn.
 Hence the Ru of the <em>Ankh sign is the</em> <em>feminine type
 of the birth-place, representing the north. </em>It was in the
 <strong>N</strong>ORTHERN <strong>Q</strong>UARTER that the <strong>G</strong>ODDESS
 OF THE <strong>S</strong>EVEN <strong>S</strong>TARS, called the
 "Mother of the Revolutions," gave birth to time in the
 earliest cycle of the year. The first sign of this primordial
 circle and cycle made in heaven is the earliest shape of the Ankh-cross
 <img src="sd2-547b.gif" align="BOTTOM">, a mere loop which contains
 both a circle and the cross in one image. This loop or noose is
 carried in front of the oldest genitrix<em>,</em> <em>Typhon of
 the great Bear, </em>as her <em>Ark, </em>the ideograph <em>of
 a period, an ending, a time,</em> shown to mean one revolution.
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "This then represents the circle made in the northern heaven
 by the Great Bear, which constituted the earliest year of time,
 from which we infer that the loop or Ru of the North represents
 that quarter, the birth-place of time when figured as the Ru of
 the Ankh symbol. Indeed this can be proved. The noose is an Ark
 or Rak type of reckoning. The Ru of the Ankh-cross was continued
 in the Cypriote <img src="sd2-547c.gif" align="BOTTOM"> and the
 Coptic Ro, P.** The Ro, was carried into the Greek cross <img src="sd2-547d.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 which is formed of the Ro and Chi or R-K. . . . The Rak, or Ank,
 was the sign of all beginning (<em>Arche</em>) on this account,
 and the Ank-tie is the cross of the North, the hind part of Heaven.
 . . ."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Now this, again, is entirely astronomical and phallic. The Puranic
 version in India gives the whole another colour; and without,
 however,

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 548 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 destroying the above interpretation it is made to reveal a portion
 of its mysteries with the help of the astronomical key, and thus
 offers a more metaphysical rendering. The "Ankh-tie"
 <img src="sd2-547b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> does not belong to Egypt
 alone. It exists under the name of pasa, a cord which Siva holds
 in the hand of his right back arm* (Siva having four arms). The
 Mahadeva is represented in the posture of an ascetic, as Maha-Yogi,
 with his third eye <img src="sd2-548a.gif" align="BOTTOM">, which
 is "the Ru, <img src="sd2-548c.gif" align="BOTTOM">,set upright
 on the Tau-Cross" in another form. The pasa is held in the
 hand in such a way that it is the first finger and hand near the
 thumb which make the cross, or loop and crossing. <img src="sd2-548b.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 Our Orientalists would have it to represent a cord to bind refractory
 offenders with, because, forsooth, Kali, Siva's consort, has the
 same as an attribute!
 </p><p>
 The <em>pasa </em>has here a double significance, as also has
 Siva's <em>trisula </em>and every other divine attribute. This
 significance lies in Siva, as Rudra has certainly the same meaning
 as the Egyptian ansated cross in its cosmic and mystic meaning.
 In the hand of Siva it becomes <em>linga</em> and <em>yonic. </em>That
 which is meant is this: Siva, as said before, is unknown by that
 name in the Vedas; and it is in the white <em>Yajur </em>Veda
 that he appears for the first time as the great god -- <strong>M</strong>AHADEVA
 -- whose symbol is the lingham. In Rig Veda he is called Rudra,
 the "howler," the beneficent and the maleficent Deity
 at the same time, the Healer and the Destroyer. In the Vishnu
 Purana, he is the god who springs from the forehead of Brahma,
 who separates into male and female, and he is the parent of the
 Rudras or Maruts, half of whom are brilliant and gentle, others,
 black and ferocious. In the Vedas, he is the divine Ego aspiring
 to return to its pure, deific state, and at the same time that
 divine ego imprisoned in earthly form, whose fierce passions make
 of him the "roarer," the "terrible." This
 is well shown in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, wherein the Rudras,
 the progeny of Rudra, god of fire, are called the "ten vital
 breaths" (<em>prana,</em> life) with <em>manas,</em> as eleventh,
 whereas as Siva, he is the <em>Destroyer </em>of that life. Brahma
 calls him Rudra, and gives him, besides, seven other names, which
 names are his seven forms of manifestation, also the seven powers
 of nature which destroy but to recreate or regenerate.
 </p><p>
 Hence the cruciform noose (<em>pasa</em>)<em> </em>in his hand,
 when he is represented as an ascetic, the <em>Mahayogin, </em>has
 no phallic signification, and it, indeed, requires a strong imagination
 bent in this direction to find such even in

 <p>
 an astronomical symbol. As an emblem of "door, gate, mouth,
 the place of outlet" it signifies the "strait gate"
 that leads to the kingdom of heaven, far more than the "birth-place"
 in a physiological sense.
 </p><p>
 It is a <em>Cross in a Circle</em> and<em> Crux Ansata, </em>truly;
 but it is a Cross on which all the human passions have to be crucified
 before the Yogi passes through the "strait gate," the
 narrow circle that widens into an infinite one, as soon as the
 <em>inner </em>man has passed the threshold.
 </p><p>
 As to the mysterious constellation of the Seven Rishis in the
 great Bear, if Egypt made them sacred to "the oldest genitrix,
 Typhon" -- India has connected all these symbols ages ago
 with time or <em>Yuga</em> revolutions, and the Saptarishis are
 intimately connected with our present age -- the Dark <em>Kali
 Yug.* </em>The great Circle of Time, on the face of which fancy
 in India has represented the Tortoise (Kurma, or Sisumara, one
 of the Avatars of Vishnu), has the Cross placed on it by nature
 in its division and localisation of stars, planets and constellations.
 Thus in <em>Bhagavata Purana V., xxx., </em>it is said that "at
 the <em>extremity of the tail of that animal, whose head is directed
 toward the</em> <em>South </em>and whose body is <em>in the shape
 of a ring </em>(Circle), Dhruva (the ex-pole star) is placed;
 and <em>along that tail </em>are the Prajapati, Agni, Indra, Dharma,
 etc.; and <em>across its loins </em>the Seven Rishis." This
 is then the first and earliest Cross and Circle, into the formation
 of which enters the Deity (symbolized by Vishnu), the Eternal
 Circle of Boundless Time, <em>Kala, </em>on whose plane lie crossways
 all the gods, creatures, and creations born in Space and Time;
 -- who, as the philosophy has it, all die at the Mahapralaya.
 </p><p>
 Meanwhile it is they, the Seven Rishis, who mark the time and
 the duration of events in our septenary life cycle. They are as
 mysterious as their supposed wives, the Pleiades, of whom only
 one -- she who hides -- has proven virtuous. The Pleiades (Krittika)
 are the nurses of Karttikeya, the God of War (Mars of the Western
 Pagans), who is called the Commander of the celestial armies --
 or rather of the Siddhas (translated Yogis in heaven, and holy
 sages on the earth) -- "Siddha-sena," which would make
 Karttikeya identical with Michael, the "leader of the celestial
 hosts" and, like himself, a virgin <em>Kumara.**</em> Verily
 he is the "Guha," the <em>mysterious one, </em>as much
 so as are the Saptarshis and the Krittika (seven Rishis and the
 Pleiades), for the interpretation of all these combined, reveal
 to the adept the greatest mysteries of occult nature. One point
 is worth mention in this question of cross and

 <p>
 circle, as it bears strongly upon the elements of fire and water,
 which play such an important part in the circle and cross Symbolics.
 Like Mars, who is alleged by Ovid to have been born of a mother
 alone (Juno), without the participation of a father, or like the
 Avatars (Krishna, for instance), in the West as in the East --
 Karttikeya is born, but in a still more miraculous manner -- begotten
 by neither father nor mother, but out of a seed of Rudra Siva,
 <em>via</em> <em>Agni, </em>who dropped it into the Ganges. Thus
 he is born from <em>fire and water</em> -- a "boy bright
 as the Sun and beautiful as the moon." Hence he is called
 <em>Agnibhuva</em> (Agni's son) and <em>Ganga-putra </em>(Son
 of Ganges). Add to this the fact that the Krittika, his nurses,
 as Matsya Purana shows, are presided over by Agni, or, in the
 authentic words -- "The seven Rishis are on a line with the
 brilliant Agni," and hence are called Agneya -- and the connection
 is easy to follow.
 </p><p>
 It is, then, the Rishis who mark the time and the periods of Kali-yuga,
 the age of sin and sorrow. See in the Bhagavata Purana <strong>XII</strong>.,
 II, <em>2, </em>6, 32, and Vishnu Purana. Says the latter: "When
 the splendour of Vishnu (Krishna) departed for heaven, then did
 the Kali Yug, during which men delight in sin, invade the world.
 . . . . When the Seven Rishis were in Magha, the Kali Yug, comprising
 1,200 (divine) years (432,000 years of mortals), began; and when
 from Magha, they shall reach Purvashadha, then will this Kali
 age attain its growth, under Nanda and his successors."*
 This is the revolution of the Rishis "when the two first
 stars of the Seven Rishis (of the Great Bear) rise in the heavens,
 and some lunar asterism is seen at night, at an equal distance
 between them, then the Seven Rishis continue stationary in that
 conjunction for a hundred years," a hater of Nanda makes
 Parasara say. According to Bentley, it is in order to show the
 quantity of the precession of the equinoxes that this notion originated
 among the astronomers. It was done "by assuming an imaginary
 line, or great circle, passing through the poles of the ecliptic
 and the beginning of the fixed Magha, which circle was supposed
 to cut some of the stars in the Great Bear. . . . The seven stars
 being called the Rishis, the Circle so assumed was called the
 line of the Rishis . . . . and being invariably fixed to the beginning
 of the lunar asterism Magha, the precession would be noted by
 stating the degree . . . of any moveable lunar mansion cut by
 that line or circle as an index" ("Historical View of
 the Hindu Astronomy," p. 65).

 * Nanda is the first Buddhist Sovereign, Chandragupta, against
 whom all the Brahmins were so arrayed; he of the Morya Dynasty,
 and the grandfather of Asoka. This is one of those passages that
 do not exist in the earlier Puranic <strong>MSS</strong>. They
 were added by the Vaishnavas, who interpolated almost as much,
 out of Sectarian spite, as the Christian Fathers did.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 551 THE RISHIS AND THE PLEIADES. </h6>
 
 <p>
 There was, and still exists, a seemingly endless controversy about
 the chronology of the Hindus. Here is a point that could help
 to determine -- approximately at least -- the age when the symbolism
 of the Seven Rishis and their connection with the Pleiades began.
 When Karttikeya was delivered to them by the gods to be nursed,
 the Krittika were only six -- whence Karttikeya is represented
 with <em>six heads; </em>but when the poetical fancy of the early
 Aryan symbologists made of them the consorts of the Seven Rishis,
 they <em>were seven. </em>Their names are given, and these are
 Amba, Dula, Nitatui, Abrayanti, Maghayanti, Varshayanti, and Chupunika.
 There are other sets of names which differ, however. Anyhow, the
 Seven Rishis were made to marry the Seven Krittika before the
 disappearance of the seventh Pleiad. Otherwise, how could the
 Hindu astronomers speak of that which, without the help of the
 strongest telescopes, no one can see? This is why, perhaps, in
 every such case the majority of the events described in the Hindu
 allegories is fixed upon as "a very recent invention, certainly
 <em>within</em> the Christian era"?
 </p><p>
 The oldest <strong>MSS</strong>. in Sanskrit on astronomy, begin
 their series of <em>Nakshatras </em>(the 27 lunar asterisms) with
 the sign of <em>Krittika, </em>and this can hardly make them earlier
 than 2780 <strong>B.C</strong>., (see the "Vedic Calendar,"
 accepted even by the Orientalists); though they get out of the
 difficulty by saying that the said Calendar does not <em>prove</em>
 that the Hindus knew anything of astronomy at that date, and assure
 their readers that, Calendars notwithstanding, the Indian <em>pundits
 </em>may have acquired their knowledge of the lunar mansions headed
 by Krittika from the Phoenicians, etc. However that may be, the
 Pleiades are the central group of the system of sidereal symbology.
 They are situated in the neck of the constellation of <em>Taurus,
 </em>regarded by Madler and others, in astronomy, <em>as</em>
 <em>the central group </em>of the system of The Milky Way, and
 in the Kabala and Eastern Esotericism, as the <em>sidereal septenate
 </em>born from the first manifested side of the upper triangle,
 the concealed <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="BOTTOM">. This manifested
 side is <em>Taurus, </em>the Symbol of <strong>O</strong>NE (the
 figure 1), or of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, <em>Aleph</em>
 <img src="sd1-78b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> (bull or ox) whose synthesis
 is ten (10), or <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="BOTTOM"> <em>Yodh,
 </em>the perfect letter and number. The Pleiades (Alcyone, especially),
 are thus considered, even in astronomy, as the central point around
 which <em>our Universe of fixed stars revolves, </em>the focus
 from which, and into which the <em>divine breath, </em><strong>M</strong>OTION,
 works incessantly during the Manvantara. Hence -- in the Occult
 philosophy and its sidereal symbols -- it is this Circle and the
 starry cross on its face, which play the most prominent part.
 </p><p>
 The Secret Doctrine teaches us that everything in the universe,
 as well as the universe itself, is formed (created) during its
 periodical manifestations -- by accelerated <strong>M</strong>OTION
 set into activity by the <strong>B</strong>REATH of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 552 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the ever-to-be-unknown power (unknown to present mankind, at any
 rate) within the phenomenal world. The Spirit of Life and Immortality
 was everywhere symbolized by a circle: hence the serpent biting
 his tail, represents the circle of Wisdom in infinity; as does
 the astronomical cross -- the cross within a circle, and the globe,
 with two wings added to it, which then became the sacred <em>Scarabaeus
 </em>of the Egyptians, its very name being suggestive of the secret
 idea attached to it. For the Scarabaeus is called in Egypt (in
 the <em>papyri</em>)<em> Khopirron </em>and<em> Khopri</em> from
 the verb <em>Khopron </em>"to become," and has thus
 been made a symbol and an emblem of human life and of the successive
 <em>becomings </em>of man, through the various peregrinations
 and metempsychoses (reincarnations) of the liberated Soul. This
 mystical symbol shows plainly that the Egyptians believed in reincarnation
 and the successive lives and existences of the Immortal entity.
 Being, however, an esoteric doctrine, revealed only during the
 mysteries by the priest-hierophants and the Kings-Initiates to
 the candidates, it was kept secret. The incorporeal intelligences
 (the Planetary Spirits, or Creative Powers) were always represented
 under the form of circles. In the primitive philosophy of the
 Hierophants these <em>invisible </em>circles were the prototypic
 causes and builders of all the heavenly orbs, which were their
 <em>visible </em>bodies or coverings, and of which they were the
 souls. It was certainly a universal teaching in antiquity. (See
 <em>Ezekiel, </em>ch. 1.)

 "Before the mathematical numbers," says Proclus (<em>in
 Quinto Libro,</em> <strong>E</strong>UCLID), "there are the
 <em>Self-moving </em>numbers; before the figures apparent -- the
 vital figures, and before producing the material worlds <em>which
 move</em> <em>in a Circle, </em>the Creative Power produced the
 <em>invisible </em>Circles."

 <em>Deus enim et circulus est, </em>says Pherecydes, in his hymn
 to Jupiter. It was a Hermetic axiom, and Pythagoras prescribed
 such a circular prostration and posture during the hours of contemplation.
 "The devotee must approach as much as possible the form of
 a perfect circle," prescribes the Secret Book. Numa tried
 to spread among the people the same custom, Pierius* tells his
 readers; and Pliny says: "During our worship, we roll up,
 so to say, our body in a ring, <em>totum</em> <em>corpus circumagimur."**

 ** The goddess Basht (or Pasht) was represented with the head
 of a cat. This animal was sacred in Egypt for several reasons:
 as a symbol of the Moon "the eye of Osiris" or the "Sun,"
 during night. The cat was also sacred to Sokhit. One of the mystic
 reasons was because of its body being rolled up in a <em>circle
 </em>when asleep. The posture is prescribed for occult and magnetic
 purposes, in order to regulate in a certain way the circulation
 of the vital fluid, with which the cat is pre-eminently endowed.
 "The nine lives of a cat" is a popular saying based
 on good physiological and occult reasons. Mr. G. Massey gives
 also an astronomical reason for it which may be found in ยง

 refer both to the <em>Spirit </em>and the <em>Sun. </em>But the
 <em>Zohar, </em>the only true glossary of the Kabalistic <em>Preacher,
 </em>in explanation of this verse, which is, perhaps, rather hazy
 and difficult to comprehend, says that "it seems to say that
 the sun moves in circuits, whereas it refers to the Spirit <em>under
 the</em> <em>Sun, </em>called the holy Spirit, that moves circularly,
 toward both sides, that they (It and the Sun) <em>should be united

 The Brahmanical "Golden Egg," from within which emerges
 Brahma, the creative deity, is the "circle with the Central
 Point" of Pythagoras, and its fitting symbol. In the Secret
 Doctrine the concealed <strong>U</strong>NITY -- whether representing
 <strong>P</strong>ARABRAHMAM, or the "<strong>G</strong>REAT
 <strong>E</strong>XTREME" of Confucius, or the Deity concealed
 by <strong>P</strong>HTA, the Eternal Light, or again the Jewish
 <strong>E</strong>N-<strong>S</strong>OPH, is always found to
 be symbolized by a circle or the "nought" (absolute
 <em>No-Thing </em>and Nothing, because it is <em>infinite </em>and
 the <strong>A</strong>LL); while the god-manifested (by its works)
 is referred to as the <em>diameter of that circle. </em>The symbolism
 of the underlying idea is thus made evident: the right line passing
 through the centre of a circle has, in the geometrical sense,
 length, but neither breadth or thickness: it is an imaginary and
 feminine symbol, crossing eternity and made to rest on the plane
 of existence <em>of the phenomenal</em> <em>world. </em>It is
 <em>dimensional, </em>whereas its circle is dimensionless, or,
 to use an algebraical term, it is the dimension of an equation.
 Another way of symbolizing the idea is found in the Pythagorean
 sacred <em>Decade</em> which synthesizes, in the dual numeral
 Ten (the 1 and a circle or cipher), the absolute <strong>A</strong>LL
 manifesting itself in the <strong>W</strong>ORD or generative
 Power of Creation.

 Admitting for argument's sake that the ancient world was not acquainted
 with our modes of calculation or Arabic figures -- though we know
 it was -- yet the <em>circle</em> and<em> diameter </em>idea is
 there to show that it was the <em>first </em>symbol in cosmogony.

 Levi thus (<em>Dogme et Rituel, </em>Vol. I., p. 124): -- China
 had her Confucius, and her Tau-ists.* The former circumscribes
 the "great extreme" within a circle with a horizontal
 line across; the latter place three concentric circles beneath
 the great circle, while the <em>Sung </em>Sages showed the "great
 Extreme" in an upper circle, and Heaven and Earth in two
 lower and smaller circles. The <em>Yangs </em>and the <em>Yins
 </em>are a far later invention.

 Plato and his school never understood the Deity otherwise, many
 epithets of his applied to the "God over all" ([[<i>ho
 epi pasi theos</i>]]) notwithstanding. Plato having been initiated,
 could not believe in a personal God -- a gigantic Shadow of Man.
 His epithets of "monarch" and "Law-giver of the
 Universe" bear an abstract meaning well understood by every
 Occultist, who, no less than any Christian, believes in the One
 Law that governs the Universe, recognizing it at the same time
 as immutable. "Beyond all <em>finite</em> existences,"
 he says, "and <em>secondary </em>causes, all laws, ideas
 and principles, there is an <strong>I</strong>NTELLIGENCE or <strong>M</strong>IND
 ([[<i>nous</i>]]), the first principle of all principles, the
 Supreme Idea on which all other ideas are grounded . . . <em>the
 ultimate</em> substance <em>from which all things derive their
 being and essence,</em> the first and efficient cause of all the
 order, and harmony, and beauty and excellency, and goodness, which
 pervades the Universe" -- who is called, by way of preeminence
 and excellence, the Supreme** good "the god" ([[<i>Theos</i>]]),
 and "the god over all." These words apply, as Plato
 himself shows, neither to the "Creator" nor to the "Father"
 of our modern Monotheist, but to the <em>ideal </em>and abstract
 cause. For, as he says, "this [gk char], the god over all,
 <em>is not the truth or the intelligence,</em> but the <strong>F</strong>ATHER
 of it," and its Primal cause. Is it Plato, the greatest pupil
 of the archaic Sages, a sage himself, for whom there was but a
 single object of attainment in this life -- <strong>R</strong>EAL
 <strong>K</strong>NOWLEDGE -- who would have ever believed in
 a deity that curses and damns men for ever, on the slightest provocation?***

 genuine philosophers and students of truth who possessed the knowledge
 of the <em>really existing </em>in opposition to mere seeming;
 of the <em>always</em> existing in opposition to the transitory;
 and of that which exists <em>permanently </em>in opposition to
 that which waxes, wanes, and is developed and destroyed alternately.*
 Speusippus and Xenocrates followed in his footsteps. The <strong>O</strong>NE,
 the original, had no existence, in the sense applied to it by
 mortal men. "The [[<i>timion</i>]]<em> </em>(<em>honoured
 </em>one) dwells in the centre as in the circumference, but <em>it
 is only the reflection</em> <em>of the</em> <em>Deity</em> --
 the world Soul"** -- the plane of the surface of the circle.
 The Cross and Circle are a universal conception -- as old as human
 mind itself. They stand foremost on the list of the long series
 of, so to say, international symbols, which expressed very often
 great scientific truths, besides their direct bearing upon psychological,
 and even physiological mysteries; and this symbol is precisely
 one of this kind, and is based upon the oldest esoteric cosmogony.
 </p><p>
 It is no explanation to say, as Eliphas Levi does, that God, the
 universal Love, having caused the male <em>unit</em> to dig an
 abyss in the female <em>Binary, </em>or chaos, produced thereby
 the world. Besides being as gross a conception as any, it does
 not remove the difficulty of conceiving it without losing one's
 veneration for the rather too human-like ways of the Deity. It
 is to avoid such anthropomorphic conceptions that the Initiates
 never use the epithet "God" to designate the One and
 Secondless Principle in the Universe; and that -- faithful in
 this to the oldest traditions of the Secret Doctrine the world
 over -- they deny that such imperfect and often not very clean
 work could ever be produced by Absolute Perfection. There is no
 need to mention here other still greater metaphysical difficulties.
 Between speculative Atheism and idiotic anthropomorphism there
 must be a philosophical mean, and a reconciliation. The Presence
 of the Unseen Principle throughout all nature, and the highest
 manifestation of it on Earth -- MAN, can alone help to solve the
 Problem, which is that of the mathematician whose <em>x</em> must
 ever elude the grasp of our terrestrial algebra. The Hindus have
 tried to solve it by their <em>avatars, </em>the Christians <em>think</em>

 they did it -- by their one divine Incarnation. Exoterically --
 both are wrong<em>; esoterically </em>both of them are very near
 the truth. Alone, among the Apostles of the Western religion,
 Paul seems to have fathomed -- if not actually revealed -- the
 archaic mystery of the Cross. As for the rest of those who, by
 unifying and individualizing the Universal Presence, have thus
 synthesized it into one symbol -- the central Point in the Crucifix
 -- they have shown thereby that they have never seized the true
 Spirit of the teaching of Christ, and by their interpretations
 they have degraded it in more than one way. They have forgotten
 the Spirit of that universal symbol and have selfishly monopolized
 it -- as though the Boundless and the Infinite can ever be limited
 and conditioned to one manifestation individualized in one man,
 or even in a nation!
 </p><p>
 The four arms of the "<img src="sd2-556.gif" align="BOTTOM">,"
 the decussated cross, and of the "Hermetic," pointing
 to the four cardinal points -- were well understood by the mystical
 minds of the Hindus, Brahmins and Buddhists, thousands of years
 before it was heard of in Europe; and that symbol was and is found
 all over the world. They bent the ends of that cross and made
 of it their <em>Swastica</em> <img src="sd2-101a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 now the <em>Wan </em>of the Buddhist Mongolian.* It implies that
 the "Central point" is not limited to one individual,
 however perfect. That <em>the</em> Principle (God) is in Humanity,
 and Humanity, as all the rest, is in it, like drops of water are
 in the Ocean, the four ends being toward the four cardinal points,
 hence losing themselves in infinity.

 Again: -- The <img src="sd1-5e.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> (Tau), and
 the astronomical cross of Egypt <img src="sd2-557a.jpg" align="BOTTOM">
 are conspicuous in several apertures of the remains of Palenque.
 In one of the<em> basso-relievos </em>of the Palace of Palenque,
 on the west side, sculptured as a hieroglyphic right under the
 seated figure, is a <em>Tau. </em>The standing figure, which leans
 over the first one, is in the act of covering its head with the
 left hand with the veil of initiation; while it extends its right
 with the index and middle finger pointing to heaven. The position
 is precisely that of a Christian bishop giving his blessing, or
 the one in which Jesus is often represented while at the Last
 Supper. . . . The Egyptian Hierophant had a square head-dress
 which he had to wear always during his functions. . . . The perfect
 <em>Tau</em>, formed of the perpendicular (descending male ray),
 and a horizontal line (matter, female principle), and the mundane
 circle was an attribute of Isis, and it is but at death that the
 Egyptian cross was laid on the breast of the mummy." These
 square hats are worn unto this day by the Armenian priests. The
 claim that the cross is purely a Christian symbol introduced after
 our era, is strange indeed, when we find Ezekiel stamping the
 foreheads of the men of Judah, who feared the Lord (<em>Ezekiel
 </em>ix. 4), with the <em>signum</em> <em>Thau, </em>as it is
 translated in the Vulgate. In the ancient Hebrew this sign was
 formed thus <img src="sd2-557b.gif" align="BOTTOM">, but in the
 original Egyptian hieroglyphics as a perfect Christian cross 
 <img src="sd2-557c.gif" align="BOTTOM"> (<em>Tat, </em>the emblem
 of stability). In the <em>Revelation, </em>also, the "Alpha
 and Omega" (spirit and matter), the first and the last, stamps
 the name of his Father in the foreheads of the <em>elect, </em>(p<em>.
 </em>323, Vol.<strong> II.</strong>) Moses, in <em>Exodus</em>
 xii<em>. </em>22, orders his people to mark their <em>door-posts
 and lintels </em>with blood, lest the "Lord God" should
 make a mistake and smite some of his chosen people, instead of
 the doomed Egyptians. And this mark is a tau! The identical Egyptian
 handled <em>cross, </em>with the half of which talisman Horus
 raised the dead, as is shown on a sculptured ruin at Philoe.
 </p><p>
 Enough was said in the text about the <em>Swastica </em>and the
 <em>Tau. </em>Verily may the Cross be traced back into the very
 depths of the unfathomable Archaic Ages! Its Mystery deepens rather
 than clears, as we find it on the statues of Easter Island --
 in old Egypt, in Central Asia, engraved on rocks as Tau and Swastica,
 in pre-Christian Scandinavia,</p><hr>

 <p>
 everywhere! The author of the "Hebrew Egyptian Mystery"
 stands perplexed before the endless shadow it throws back into
 antiquity, and is unable to trace it to any particular nation
 or man. He shows the <em>Targums </em>handed down by the Hebrews,
 obscured by translation. In Joshua (viii. 29) read in <em>Arabic,
 </em>and in the <em>Targum </em>of<em> Jonathan, </em>it is said:
 <em>"The king of Ai he crucified upon a tree." </em>The<em>
 Septuagint </em>rendering is of suspension from a <em>double word
 </em>(Wordsworth on Joshua.) . . . The strangest expression of
 this kind is in Numbers xxv. 4, where, by Onkalos (?) it is read:
 "Crucify them before the Lord (Jehovah) <em>against the Sun."
 </em>"The word here <img src="sd2-558.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 <em>to nail to, </em>is rendered properly (Fuerst) by the Vulgate
 <em>to crucify. </em>The very construction of this sentence is
 mystic."
 </p><p>
 So it is, but the spirit of it has been ever misunderstood. "To
 crucify before (not against) the sun" is a phrase used of
 initiation. It comes from Egypt, and primarily from India. The
 enigma can be unriddled only by searching for its key in the Mysteries
 of Initiation. The initiated adept, who had successfully passed
 through all the trials, <em>was attached,</em> not<em> nailed,
 </em>but simply tied on a couch in the form of a <em>tau</em>
 <img src="sd1-5e.jpg" align="BOTTOM"> (in Egypt) of a <em>Svastika
 </em>without the four additional prolongations (thus: <img src="sd1-5b.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,
 not <img src="sd2-29a.gif" align="BOTTOM">) plunged in a deep
 sleep (the "Sleep of Siloam" it is called to this day
 among the Initiates in Asia Minor, in Syria, and even higher Egypt).
 He was allowed to remain in this state for three days and three
 nights, during which time his Spiritual Ego was said to confabulate
 with the "gods," descend into Hades, Amenti, or Patala,
 (according to the country), and do works of charity to the invisible
 beings, whether souls of men or Elemental Spirits; his body remaining
 all the time in a temple crypt or subterranean cave. In Egypt
 it was placed in the Sarcophagus in the King's Chamber of the
 Pyramid of Cheops, and carried during the night of the approaching
 third day to the entrance of a gallery, where at a certain hour
 the beams of the rising Sun struck full on the face of the entranced
 candidate, who awoke to be initiated by Osiris, and Thoth the
 God of Wisdom.
 </p><p>
 Let the reader who doubts the statement consult the Hebrew originals
 before he denies. Let him turn to some most suggestive Egyptian
 <em>bas</em> <em>reliefs. </em>One especially from the temple
 of Philoe, represents a <em>scene of</em> <em>initiation. </em>Two
 Gods-Hierophants, one with the head of a hawk (the Sun), the other
 <em>ibis</em>-headed (Mercury, Thoth, the god of Wisdom and secret
 learning, the assessor of Osiris-Sun), are standing over the body
 of a candidate just initiated. They are in the act of pouring
 on his head a double stream of water (the water of life and new
 <em>birth</em>)<em>,</em> which stream is interlaced in the shape
 of a cross and full of small ansated crosses. This is allegorical
 of the awakening of the candidate</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 559 ITS EARLY SIGNIFICANCE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 (now an Initiate), when the beams of the morning sun (Osiris)
 strike the crown of his head (<em>his entranced body being placed
 </em>on its wooden <em>tau so as to receive the rays</em>)<em>.
 </em>Then appeared the Hierophants-Initiators, and the sacramental
 words were pronounced, ostensibly, to the Sun-Osiris, addressed
 in reality to the Spirit Sun within, enlightening the newly-born
 man. Let the reader meditate on the connection of the Sun with
 the Cross in both its generative and spiritually regenerative
 capacities -- from the highest antiquity. Let him examine the
 tomb of Bait-Oxly, in the reign of Ramses <strong>II</strong>.,
 where he will find the crosses in every shape and position. So
 again, on the throne of that sovereign, and finally on a fragment
 from the Hall of the ancestors of Totmes <strong>III</strong>.,
 preserved in the National Library of Paris, which represents the
 adoration of Bakhan-Aleare.
 </p><p>
 In this extraordinary sculpture and painting one sees the disc
 of the Sun beaming upon an ansated cross placed upon a cross of
 which those of the Calvary were perfect copies. The ancient <strong>MSS</strong>.
 mention these as the "hard couches of those who were in (spiritual)
 travail, the <em>act</em> <em>of giving birth to themselves.</em>"<em>
 </em>A quantity of such cruciform "couches," on which
 the candidate, thrown into a dead trance at the end of his supreme
 initiation, was placed and secured, were found in the underground
 halls of the Egyptian temples after their destruction. The worthy
 and holy Fathers of the Cyril and Theophilus types used them freely,
 believing they had been brought and concealed there by some new
 converts. Alone Origen, and after him Clemens Alexandrinus and
 other ex-initiates, knew better. But they preferred to keep silent.
 </p><p>
 Again, let the reader read the Hindu "fables," as the
 Orientalists call them, and remember the allegory of Visvakarma,
 the creative power, the great architect of the world, called in
 the Veda "the all-seeing god," who "sacrifices
 himself to himself" (the Spiritual Egos of mortals are his
 own essence, <em>one with him, </em>therefore). Remember that
 he is called <em>Deva Vardhika </em>"the builder of the gods"
 and that it is he who ties (the Sun) Surya, his son-in-law, on
 his lathe, in the exoteric allegory; on the Swastika, in esoteric
 tradition, as on earth he is the Hierophant Initiator, and cuts
 away a portion of his brightness. Visvakarma, remember again,
 is the Son of Yoga-Siddha, <em>i.e</em>., the holy power of Yoga,
 and the fabricator of the "fiery weapon," the magic
 Agneyastra. The narrative is given more fully elsewhere. The author
 of the Kabalistic work so often quoted from, asks: --
 </p><p>
 "The theoretical use of crucifixion must have been somehow
 connected with the personification of this symbol (the structure
 of the garden of Paradise symbolized by a crucified man). But
 how? And as showing what? The symbol was of the origin of measures,
 shadowing forth <em>creative law </em>or<em> design. </em>What
 practically, as regards humanity,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 560 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 could actual crucifixion betoken? Yet, that it was held as the
 effigy of some mysterious working of the same system, is shown
 from the very fact of the use. There seems to be deep below deep
 as to the mysterious workings of these number values -- (the symbolization
 of the connection of 113 : 355, with 20612 : 6561, <em>by a crucified
 man</em>)<em>. </em>Not only are they shown to work in the Kosmos
 . . . . but by sympathy, they seem to work out conditions relating
 to an unseen and spiritual world, and the prophets seem to have
 held knowledge of the connecting link. . . . Reflection becomes
 more involved when it is considered that the power of expression
 of the law, <em>exactly,</em> by<em> numbers, </em>clearly defining
 a system, was not the <em>accident </em>of the language, but was
 its very <em>essence, </em>and of its <em>primary organic construction;
 </em>therefore, neither the language, nor the mathematical system
 attaching to it, <em>could be of man's invention, </em>unless
 both were <em>founded upon a prior language, which afterwards
 became</em> <em>obsolete . </em>. . " (p. 205).
 </p><p>
 The author proves these points by further elucidation, and reveals
 the secret meaning of more than one <em>dead-letter </em>narrative,
 by showing that probably <img src="sd2-560.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 <em>man </em>was the <em>primordial </em>word -- "the very
 first word possessed by the Hebrews, whoever they were, to carry
 the idea by sound of a <em>man. </em>The essential of this word
 was 113 (the numerical value of that word) from the beginning,
 and carried with it the elements of the cosmical system displayed."
 </p><p>
 This is demonstrated by the Hindu Wittoba -- a form of Vishnu
 -- as said already. The figure of Wittoba, even to the nail-marks
 on the feet,* <em>is that of Jesus crucified, in all its details
 </em>save the Cross; and that MAN was meant is proved to us further
 by the fact of the <em>Initiate being</em> <em>reborn after his
 crucifixion on the </em>TREE OF LIFE. This "tree" has
 now become exoterically, through its use by the Romans as an instrument
 of torture, and the ignorance of the early Christian schemers,
 the <em>tree of</em> <em>death!</em> 
 </p><p>
 Thus, one of the <em>seven esoteric meanings </em>implied in this
 mystery of Crucifixion by the mystic inventors of the system --
 the original elaboration and adoption of which dates back to the
 very establishment of the MYSTERIES -- is discovered in the geometrical
 symbols containing the history of the evolution of man. The Hebrews,
 whose prophet Moses was so learned in the esoteric Wisdom of Egypt,
 and who adopted their numerical system from the Phoenicians, and
 later from the Gentiles, from whom they borrowed most of their
 Kabalistic Mysticism, adapted, most ingeniously, the Cosmic and
 anthropological symbols of the "heathen" nations to
 their peculiar <em>secret </em>records. If Christian

 <p>
 sacerdotalism has lost the key of it to-day, the early compilers
 of the Christian Mysteries were well versed in Esoteric philosophy
 and the Hebrew occult metrology, and used it dexterously. Thus
 they took the word <em>aish </em>(one of the Hebrew word forms
 for MAN) and used it in conjunction with that of <em>Shanah </em>"lunar
 year," so mystically connected with the name of Jehovah,
 the supposed "father" of Jesus, and embosomed the mystic
 idea in an astronomical value and formula.
 </p><p>
 The original idea of "Man Crucified" in Space belongs
 certainly to the ancient Hindus, and Muir shows it in his "Hindu
 Pantheon" in the engraving that represents Wittoba. Plato
 adopted it in his decussated Cross in Space, the <img src="sd2-556.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 , "the Second God who impressed himself on the Universe in
 the form of the Cross"; Krishna is likewise shown "crucified."
 (See Dr. Lundy's <em>Monumental Christianity, </em>fig. 72.) Again
 it is repeated in the Old Testament in the queer injunction <em>to
 crucify men</em> before the Lord, <em>the Sun -- </em>which is
 no prophecy at all, but has a direct phallic significance. In
 ยง <strong>II</strong>. of that same most suggestive work
 on the Kabalistic meanings -- "The Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery,"
 we read again: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "In symbol, the nails of the cross have for the shape of
 the heads thereof a solid pyramid, and a tapering square obeliscal
 shaft, or phallic emblem, for the nail. Taking the position of
 the <em>three </em>nails in the Man's extremities and on the cross,
 they form or mark a <em>triangle </em>in shape, one nail being
 at each corner of the triangle. The wounds or <em>stigmata </em>in
 the extremities are necessarily <i>four </i>designative of the
 <em>square</em>. . . . The <em>three </em>nails with the <em>three</em>
 wounds are in number 6, which denotes the 6 faces of the cube
 <em>unfolded </em>(which make the cross or man-form, or 7, counting
 three horizontal and four vertical bars) on which the man is placed;
 and this in turn points to the circular measure transferred on
 to the edges of the cube. The <em>one</em> wound of the feet separates
 into <em>two</em> when the feet are separated, making <em>three</em>
 together<em> for all, </em>and <em>four when</em> <em>separated,
 </em>or 7 in all -- another <em>most holy </em>(and<em> with the
 Jews</em>)<em> </em>feminine base number."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Thus, while the phallic or sexual meaning of the "Crucifixion
 Nails" is proven by the geometrical and numerical reading,
 its mystical meaning is indicated by the short remarks upon it,
 as given above, in its connection with, and bearing upon, Prometheus.
 He is another victim, for he is crucified on the Cross of Love,
 on the rock of human passions, a sacrifice to his devotion to
 the cause of the spiritual element in Humanity.
 </p><p>
 Now, the primordial system, the double glyph that underlies the
 idea of the Cross, is not "of human invention," for
 Cosmic ideation and the Spiritual representation of the divine
 Ego-man are at its basis. Later, it expanded in the beautiful
 idea adopted by and represented in the Mysteries, that of regenerated
 man, the mortal, who, by crucifying the man of flesh and his passions
 on the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 562 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Procrustean bed of torture, became reborn as an Immortal. Leaving
 the body, the animal-man, behind him, tied on the Cross of Initiation
 like an empty chrysalis, the Ego Soul became as free as a butterfly.
 Still later, owing to the gradual loss of spirituality, the cross
 became in Cosmogony and Anthropology no <em>higher than a phallic
 symbol.</em> 
 </p><p>
 With the Esotericists, from the remotest times the Universal Soul
 or <em>anima mundi, </em>the material reflection of the Immaterial
 Ideal, was the Source of Life of all beings and of the life principle
 of the three kingdoms; and it was <em>Septenary </em>with the
 Hermetic philosophers, as with all ancients. For it is represented
 as a Sevenfold cross, whose branches are respectively, <em>light,
 heat, electricity, terrestrial magnetism, astral</em> <em>radiation,
 motion, </em>and<em> Intelligence, </em>or what some call self-consciousness.
 </p><p>
 We have said it elsewhere. Long before the cross or its sign were
 adopted as symbols of Christianity, the sign of the cross was
 used as a sign of recognition among adepts and neophytes, the
 latter being called<em> Chrests </em>(from Chrestos, man of tribulation
 and sorrow). Says E. Levi: "The sign of the cross adopted
 by the Christians does not belong exclusively to them. It is Kabalistic,
 and represents the opposition and quaternary equilibrium of the
 elements. We see by the Occult verse of the <em>Paternoster </em>that
 there were originally two ways of making it, or, at least <em>two
 </em>very different formulas to express its meaning -- one reserved
 for <em>priests-initiates, </em>the other given to neophites and
 the profane. Thus, for example, the <em>initiate, </em>carrying
 his hand to his forehead, said: <em>To thee; </em>then he added,
 <em>belong: </em>and continued, while carrying his hand to the
 breast -- <em>the kingdom; </em>then, to the left shoulder --
 <em>justice: </em>to the right shoulder -- <em>and mercy. </em>Then
 he joined the two hands, adding: <em>throughout the generating
 cycles: 'Tibi sunt Malchut et</em> <em>Geburah et Chassed per
 Aeonas' -- </em>a sign of the Cross, <em>absolutely</em> and magnificently
 kabalistic, which the profanations of Gnosticism made the militant
 and official Church completely <em>lose." </em>(<em>Dogma
 et Ritual, </em>etc., Vol. II., p. 88.)

 The "militant and official Church" did more: having
 helped herself to what had never belonged to her, she took only
 that which the "profane" had, the Kabalistic meaning
 of the <em>male </em>and<em> female</em> Sephiroth. She never
 lost the <em>inner </em>and higher meaning since she never had
 it -- E. Levi's pandering to Rome, notwithstanding. The sign of
 the cross adopted by the Latin Church was <em>phallic </em>from
 the beginning, while that of the Greeks was the cross of the <em>neophytes,
 </em>the <strong>C</strong>HREST.
