 (<em>a</em>) Here tradition falls again into the Universal. As
 in the earliest version, repeated in the Puranas, so in the latest,
 the Mosaic account. In the first it is said: "He the Lord"
 (the god who has the form of Brahma) "when the world had
 become one ocean (<em>Harivamsa I. </em>36) concluding that within
 the waters lay the earth, and desirous to raise it up," to
 separate it, "created himself in another form. As in the
 preceding Kalpa (Manvantara) he had assumed the shape of a tortoise,
 so in this one he took the shape of a boar, etc. etc." In
 the Elohistic "creation" (<em>Genesis, </em>verses 6,
 7, 8, and 9) "God" creates a firmament in the midst
 of the waters . . . . . and says "let <em>dry land </em>appear."
 And now comes the traditional peg whereunto is hung the esoteric
 portion of the Kabalistic interpretation.

 (<em>a</em>) Who are the Lords of the Moon? In India they are
 called <em>Pitris </em>or "lunar ancestors," but in
 the Hebrew scrolls it is Jehovah himself who is the "Lord
 of the Moon," collectively as the Host, and also as one of
 the Elohim. The astronomy of the Hebrews and their observance
 of<em> times </em>was regulated by the moon. A Kabalist, having
 shown that "Daniel . . . told off God's providence by <em>set
 times," </em>and that the "Revelation" of John
 "speaks of a carefully measured <em>cubical </em>city descending
 out of the heavens," etc., adds --</p><hr>

 "But the vitalizing power of heaven lay chiefly <em>with
 the moon</em>. . . . It was the Hebrew <img src="sd1-355b.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 (Jehovah), and St. Paul enjoins: 'Let no man judge you for your
 observance of the seventh day, and the <em>day of the new moon,
 which are a shadow of things to come; </em>but the body (or substance)
 is of Christ" or Jehovah, that function of this power that
 "made the barren woman . . . a mother . . . for they are
 the gift of Jehovah" . . . which is a key to the objection
 which her husband made to the Shunamite, as to her going to the
 man of God -- "for it is neither the seventh day nor the
 <em>day of the new moon. .</em> . . (2<em> Kings</em>, iv., 23.)
 The living spiritual powers of the constellations had mighty wars,
 marked by the movements and positions of the stars and planets,
 and especially as the result of the conjunction of the moon, earth,
 and sun. Bentley comments on the Hindu "War between the gods
 and the giants," as marked by the eclipse of the Sun at the
 ascending node of the Moon, 945 <b>B.C</b>. (! !), at which time
 was born* or produced from the sea, <strong>S</strong>RI (Sarai,
 S-r-i, the wife of the Hebrew A-bram**). Sri is also Venus-Aphrodite
 the Western emblem "of the luni-solar year or the moon (as
 Sri is the wife of the moon; <em>vide</em> foot-note), the goddess
 of increase*** . . . " Therefore . . . "the grand monument
 and landmark of the exact period of the lunar year and month,
 by which this cycle (of 19 tropical years and 235 revolutions
 of the moon) could be calculated, was Mount Sinai -- the Lord
 Jehovah coming down thereon. . . . Paul speaks (then) as a mystagogue,
 when he says concerning the freed woman and bond woman of Abraham:
 'For this Hagar (the bond-woman) is Mount Sinai in Arabia.' How
 could a woman be a mountain? and such a mountain! Yet . . . she
 was. . . . Her name was Hagar, Hebrew <img src="sd2-76.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 whose numbers re-read 235, or in exact measure, the very number
 of lunar months to equal nineteen tropical years to complete this
 cycle. . . . Mount Sinai being, in the esoteric language of the
 wisdom, the monument of the exact time of the lunar

 ** Now <em>Sri </em>is the daughter of Bhrigu, one of the Prajapatis
 and Rishis, the chief of the Bhrigus, "the Consumers,"
 the aerial class of gods. She is Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu,
 and she is "the bride of Siva" (Gauri), and she is Sarasvati,
 "the watery," the wife of Brahma, because the three
 gods and goddesses are one, under three aspects. Read the explanation
 by Parasara, in <em>Vishnu Purana</em> in Bk. I., ch. viii. (Vol.
 I., Wilson's trans., p. 119), and you will understand. "The
 Lord of Sri" is the moon, he says, and "Sri is the wife
 of Narayana, the God of Gods"; Sri or Lakshmi (Venus) is
 Indrani, as she is Sarasvati, for in the words of Parasara: "Hari
 (or Iswara, "the Lord") is all that is called male in
 the Universe; Lakshmi is all that is termed female. There is nothing
 else than they." Hence she is "female," and "God"
 is male Nature.

 years and months, by which this spiritual vitalizing cycle could
 be computed -- and which mountain, indeed, was called (see Fuerst),
 "the Mountain of the Moon (Sin). So also Sarai (<strong>SRI</strong>),
 the wife of Abram, could have no child until her name was changed
 to Sarah, <img src="sd2-77.gif" align="BOTTOM">, giving to her
 the property of this lunar influence."*
 </p><p>
 This may be regarded as a digression from the main subject; but
 it is a very necessary one with a view to Christian readers. For
 who, after studying dispassionately the respective legends of
 Abram or Abraham, Sarai or Sarah, who was "fair to look upon,"
 and those of Brahma and Sarasvati, or Sri, Lakshmi-Venus, with
 the relations of all these to the Moon and Water; -- and especially
 one who understands the real Kabalistic meaning of the name Jehovah
 and its relation to, and connection with, the moon -- who can
 doubt that the story of Abram is based upon that of Brahma, or
 that Genesis was written upon the old lines used by every ancient
 nation? All in the ancient Scriptures is allegorical -- all based
 upon and inseparably connected with Astronomy and Cosmolatry.

 13. <strong>T</strong>HEY (<em>the Moon-gods</em>)<em> </em>WENT,
 EACH ON HIS ALLOTTED LAND: SEVEN OF THEM, EACH ON HIS LOT. <strong>T</strong>HE
 <strong>L</strong>ORDS OF THE <strong>F</strong>LAME REMAINED
 BEHIND. <strong>T</strong>HEY WOULD NOT GO, THEY WOULD NOT CREATE
 (<em>a</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) The Secret teachings show the divine Progenitors
 creating men on seven portions of the globe "each on his
 lot" -- <em>i.e.</em>, each a different race of men externally
 and internally, and on different zones. This polygenistic claim
 is considered elsewhere (<em>vide</em> Stanza <strong>VII.</strong>).
 But who are "They" who create, and the "Lords of
 the Flame," "who do not"? Occultism divides the
 "Creators" into twelve classes; of which four have reached
 <em>liberation </em>to the end of the "Great Age," the
 fifth is ready to reach it, but still remains active on the intellectual
 planes, while seven are still under direct Karmic law. These last
 act on the man-bearing globes of our chain.
 </p><p>
 Exoteric Hindu books mention seven classes of Pitris, and among
 them two distinct kinds of Progenitors or Ancestors: the <em>Barhishad</em>
 and the<em> Agnishwatta; </em>or those possessed of the "sacred
 fire" and those devoid of it. Hindu ritualism seems to connect
 them with sacrificial fires, and with <em>Grihasta </em>Brahmins
 in earlier incarnations: those who have, and those who have <b>not
 </b>attended as they should to their household sacred fires in
 their previous births. The distinction, as said, is derived from
 the<em> Vedas. </em>The first and highest class (esoterically)
 the <em>Agnishwatta,</em>

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 78 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 are represented in the exoteric allegory as <em>Grihasta </em>(Brahman-householders)
 who, in their past births in other Manvantaras having failed to
 maintain their domestic fires and to offer burnt sacrifices, have
 lost every right to have oblations with fire presented to them.
 Whereas the Barhishad, being Brahmins who have kept up their household
 sacred fires, are thus honoured to this day. Thence the <em>Agnishwatta
 </em>are represented as devoid of, and the <em>Barhishad </em>as
 possessed of, fires.
 </p><p>
 But esoteric philosophy explains the original qualifications as
 being due to the difference between the natures of the two classes:
 the <em>Agnishwatta </em>Pitris are devoid of fire (<em>i.e.</em>,
 of creative passion), because too divine and pure (<em>vide supra,
 </em>Sloka 11th); whereas the Barhishad, being the lunar spirits
 more closely connected with Earth, became the creative Elohim
 of form, or the Adam of dust.
 </p><p>
 The allegory says that Sanandana and other <em>Vedhas, </em>the
 Sons of Brahma, <em>his first progeny, </em>"were without
 desire or passion, inspired with the holy wisdom, estranged from
 the Universe and <em>undesirous of progeny" </em>(<em>Vishnu
 Purana, </em>Book I. vii.). This also is what is meant in Sloka
 11 by the words: "They would not create," and is explained
 as follows: -- "The primordial Emanations from the creative
 Power are too near the absolute Cause. They are transitional and
 latent forces, which will develop only in the next and subsequent
 removes." This makes it plain. Hence Brahma is said to have
 felt wrathful when he saw that those "embodied spirits, produced
 from his limbs (<em>gatra</em>), would not multiply themselves."
 After which, in the allegory, he creates other seven <em>mind-born
 </em>Sons (see <em>"Moksha-Darma" </em>and<em> "Mahabharata"</em>)<em>,
 </em>namely<em>, Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu</em>
 and<em> Vasishta, </em>the latter being often replaced by <em>Daksha,
 </em>the most prolific of the creators. In most of the texts these
 Seven Sons of <em>Vasishta-Daksha </em>are called the seven Rishis
 of the <em>Third</em> Manvantara; the latter referring both to
 the Third Round and also to the third Root-Race and its branch-Races
 in the Fourth Round. These are all the creators of the various
 beings on this Earth, the Prajapati, and at the same time they
 appear as divers reincarnations in the early Manvantaras or races.
 </p><p>
 It thus becomes clear why the <em>Agnishwatta, </em>devoid of
 the grosser <em>creative fire, </em>hence unable to create physical
 man, having no <em>double, </em>or astral body, to project, since
 they were without any <em>form</em>, are shown in exoteric allegories
 as Yogis, Kumaras (chaste youths), who became "rebels,"
 <em>Asuras, </em>fighting and opposing gods,* etc., etc. Yet it
 is they
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * Because, as the allegory shows, the Gods who had no personal
 merit of their own, dreading the sanctity of those self-striving
 incarnated Beings who had become <em>ascetics </em>and Yogis,
 and thus threatened to upset the power of the former by their
 <em>self-acquired </em>powers -- renounced them. All this has
 a deep philosophical meaning and refers to the evolution and acquirement
 of divine powers through <em>self-exertion. </em>Some Rishi- [[Footnote

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 79 THE LIVING SPIRITUAL FIRE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 alone who could complete man, <em>i.e.</em>, make of him a self-conscious,
 almost a divine being -- god on Earth. The <em>Barhishad, </em>though
 possessed of creative fire, were devoid of the higher <strong>M</strong>AHAT-mic
 element. Being on a level with the lower principles -- those which
 precede gross objective matter -- they could only give birth to
 the outer man, or rather to the model of the physical, the astral
 man. Thus, though we see them intrusted with the task by Brahma
 (the collective <em>Mahat </em>or Universal Divine Mind), the
 "Mystery of Creation" is repeated on Earth, only in
 an inverted sense, as in a <em>mirror. </em>It is those who are
 unable to create the spiritual immortal man, who project the senseless
 model (the <em>Astral</em>)<em> </em>of the physical Being; and,
 as will be seen, it was those who would not multiply, who sacrificed
 themselves to the good and salvation of <em>Spiritual Humanity.
 </em>For, to complete the <em>septenary man, </em>to add to his
 three lower principles and cement them with the spiritual Monad
 -- which could never dwell in such a form otherwise than in an
 <em>absolutely latent state</em> -- two<em> </em>connecting principles
 are needed: <em>Manas </em>and<em> Kama. </em>This requires a
 living <em>Spiritual Fire </em>of the middle principle from the
 <em>fifth</em> and<em> third states </em>of Pleroma. But this
 fire is the possession of the <em>Triangles, </em>not of the (perfect)
 <em>Cubes, </em>which symbolize the Angelic Beings:* the former
 having from the first creation got hold of it and being said to
 have appropriated it for themselves, as in the allegory of Prometheus.
 These are the active, and therefore -- in Heaven -- no longer
 "pure" Beings. They have become the independent and
 free Intelligences, shown in every Theogony as fighting for that
 independence and freedom, and hence -- in the ordinary sense --
 "rebellious to the divine passive law." These are then
 those "Flames" (the <em>Agnishwatta</em>)<em> </em>who,
 as shown in Sloka 13, "remain behind" instead of going
 along with the others to create men on Earth. But the true esoteric
 meaning is that most of them were destined to incarnate as the
 <em>Egos </em>of the forthcoming crop of Mankind. The human <em>Ego
 </em>is neither Atman nor Buddhi, but the higher <em>Manas: </em>the
 intellectual fruition and the efflorescence of the intellectual
 self-conscious <em>Egotism</em> -- in<em> </em>the higher spiritual
 sense. The ancient works refer to it as <em>Karana Sarira </em>on
 the plane of <em>Sutratma, </em>which is the golden thread on
 which, like beads, the various personalities of this higher <em>Ego</em>
 are strung. If the reader were told, as in the<em> semi-esoteric
 </em>allegories, that these Beings were returning <em>Nirvanees,
 </em>from preceding <em>Maha-Manvantaras --</em> ages<em> </em>of
 incalculable dura-

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] Yogis are shown in the
 Puranas to be far more powerful than the gods. Secondary gods
 or temporary powers in Nature (the Forces) are doomed to disappear;
 it is only the spiritual potentiality in man which can lead him
 to become one with the INFINITE and the ABSOLUTE.

 <p>
 tion which have rolled away in the Eternity, a still more incalculable
 time ago -- he would hardly understand the text correctly; while
 some Vedantins might say: "This is not so; the Nirvanee can
 never return"; which is true during the Manvantara he belongs
 to, and erroneous where Eternity is concerned. For it is said
 in the Sacred Slokas:
 </p><p>
 <em>"The thread of radiance which is imperishable and dissolves
 only in Nirvana, re-emerges from it in its integrity on the day
 when the Great Law calls all things back into action</em>. . .
 ."
 </p><p>
 Hence, as the higher "Pitris or Dhyanis" had no hand
 in his physical creation, we find primeval man, issued from the
 bodies of his <em>spiritually fireless </em>progenitors, described
 as aeriform, devoid of compactness, and <strong>M</strong>INDLESS.
 He had no middle principle to serve him as a medium between the
 <em>highest </em>and the <em>lowest, </em>the spiritual man and
 the physical brain, for he lacked <em>Manas. </em>The Monads which
 incarnated in those empty <strong>S</strong>HELLS, remained as
 unconscious as when separated from their previous incomplete forms
 and vehicles. There is no potentiality for creation, or self-Consciousness,
 in a <em>pure</em> Spirit on this our plane, unless its too homogeneous,
 perfect, because divine, nature is, so to say, mixed with, and
 strengthened by, an essence already differentiated. It is only
 the lower line of the Triangle -- representing the first triad
 that emanates from the Universal <strong>M</strong>ONAD -- that
 can furnish this needed consciousness on the plane of differentiated
 Nature. But how could these pure Emanations, which, on this principle,
 must have originally been themselves<em> unconscious </em>(in
 our sense), be of any use in supplying the required principle,
 as they could hardly have possessed it themselves? The answer
 is difficult to comprehend, unless one is well acquainted with
 the philosophical metaphysics of a beginningless and endless series
 of Cosmic Re-births; and becomes well impressed and familiarised
 with that immutable law of Nature which is <strong>E</strong>TERNAL
 <strong>M</strong>OTION, cyclic and spiral, therefore progressive
 even in its seeming retrogression. The one divine Principle, the
 nameless <strong>T</strong>HAT of the Vedas, is the universal
 Total, which, neither in its spiritual aspects and emanations,
 nor in its physical atoms, can ever be at <em>"absolute rest"
 </em>except during the "Nights" of Brahma. Hence, also,
 the "first-born" are those who are first set in motion
 at the beginning of a Manvantara, and thus the first to fall into
 the lower spheres of materiality. They who are called in Theology
 "the Thrones," and are the "Seat of God,"
 must be the first incarnated men on Earth; and it becomes comprehensible,
 if we think of the endless series of past Manvantaras, to find
 that the last had to come first, and the first last. We find,
 in short, that the higher Angels had broken, countless aeons before,
 through the "Seven Circles," and thus <em>robbed </em>them
 of the Sacred fire;</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 81 MAN, A GOD IN ANIMAL FORM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 which means in plain words, that they had assimilated during their
 past incarnations, in lower as well as in higher worlds, all the
 wisdom therefrom -- the reflection of <strong>M</strong>AHAT in
 its various degrees of intensity. No Entity, whether angelic or
 human, can reach the state of Nirvana, or of absolute purity,
 except through aeons of suffering and the <em>knowledge </em>of<em>
 </em>EVIL as well as of good, as otherwise the latter remains
 incomprehensible.
 </p><p>
 Between man and the animal -- whose Monads (or Jivas) are fundamentally
 identical -- there is the impassable abyss of Mentality and Self-consciousness.
 What is human mind in its higher aspect, whence comes it, if it
 is not a portion of the essence -- and, in some rare cases of
 incarnation, the <em>very essence </em>-<em>- </em>of a higher
 Being: one from a higher and divine plane? Can man -- a god in
 the animal form -- be the product of Material Nature by evolution
 alone, even as is the animal, which differs from man in external
 shape, but by no means in the materials of its physical fabric,
 and is informed by the same, though undeveloped, Monad -- seeing
 that the intellectual potentialities of the two differ as the
 Sun does from the Glow-worm? And what is it that creates such
 difference, unless man is an animal <em>plus</em> <em>a living
 god </em>within his physical shell? Let us pause and ask ourselves
 seriously the question, regardless of the vagaries and sophisms
 of both the materialistic and the psychological modern sciences.
 </p><p>
 To some extent, it is admitted that even the esoteric teaching
 is allegorical. To make the latter comprehensible to the average
 intelligence, requires the use of symbols cast in an intelligible
 form. Hence the allegorical and semi-mythical narratives in the
 exoteric, and the (only) <em>semi</em>-metaphysical and objective
 representations in the esoteric teachings. For the purely and
 transcendentally spiritual conceptions are adapted only to the
 perceptions of those who "see without eyes, hear without
 ears, and sense without organs," according to the graphic
 expression of the Commentary. The too puritan idealist is at liberty
 to spiritualise the tenet, whereas the modern psychologist would
 simply try to spirit away our "fallen," yet still divine,
 human Soul in its connection with <em>Buddhi.</em> 
 </p><p>
 The mystery attached to the highly spiritual ancestors of the
 <em>divine </em>man within the earthly man is very great. His
 dual creation is hinted at in the Puranas, though its esoteric
 meaning can be approached only by collating together the many
 varying accounts, and reading them in their symbolical and allegorical
 character. So it is in the Bible, both in <em>Genesis </em>and
 even in the <em>Epistles </em>of Paul. For that <em>creator, </em>who
 is called in the second chapter of Genesis the "Lord God,"
 is in the original the <em>Elohim, </em>or<em> Gods </em>(the
 Lords), in the plural; and while one of them makes the earthly
 Adam of dust, the other breathes into him the breath of life,
 and the third makes of him a <em>living soul </em>(ii. 7), all
 of which readings </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 82 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 are implied in the plural number of the Elohim.* "The first
 man is of the Earth, the second (the last, or rather highest)
 is from heaven," says Paul in I. <em>Corinthians </em>xv.
 47.
 </p><p>
 In the Aryan allegory the rebellious Sons of Brahma are all represented
 as holy ascetics and Yogis. Re-born in every Kalpa, they generally
 try to impede the work of human procreation. When Daksha, the
 chief of the <em>Prajapati </em>(creators), brings forth 10,000
 sons for the purpose of peopling the world, Narada -- a son of
 Brahma, the great Rishi, and <em>virtually </em>a "Kumara,"
 if not so in name -- interferes with, and twice frustrates Daksha's
 aim, by persuading those Sons to remain holy ascetics and eschew
 marriage. For this, Daksha curses Narada to be <em>re-born as
 a man, </em>as Brahma had cursed him before for refusing to marry,
 and obtain progeny, saying: -- "Perish in thy present (<em>Deva</em>
 or angelic) form and take up thy abode in the womb," <em>i.e.</em>,
 become a man (<em>Vayu Purana; Harivamsa, </em>170). Notwithstanding
 several conflicting versions of the same story, it is easy to
 see that Narada belongs to that class of Brahma's, "first-born,"
 who have all proven rebellious to the law of animal procreation,
 for which they had to incarnate as <em>men. </em>Of all the Vedic
 Rishis, Narada, as already shown, is the most incomprehensible,
 because the most closely connected with the occult doctrines --
 especially with the secret cycles and Kalpas (<em>vide supra</em>)<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Certain contradictory statements about this Sage have much distracted
 the Orientalists. Thus he is shown as refusing positively to <em>create
 </em>(have progeny), and even as calling his father Brahma "a
 false teacher" for advising him to get married (<em>"Narada-Pancha-Ratra</em>");
 nevertheless, he is referred to as one of the Prajapati, "progenitors"!
 In <em>Naradiya Purana, </em>he describes the laws and the duties
 of the celibate adepts; and as these occult duties do not happen
 to be found in the fragment of about 3,000 Stanzas in the possession
 of European museums, the Brahmins are proclaimed liars;
 </p><p>
 the Orientalists forgetting that the <em>Naradiya </em>is credited
 with containing 25,000 Stanzas, and that it is not very likely
 that such <b>MSS.</b> should be found in the hands of the Hindu
 profane, those who are ready to sell any precious olla for a red
 pottage. Suffice it to say, that Narada is

 * Seth, as Bunsen and others have shown, is not only the <em>primitive
 god </em>of the Semites -- early Jews included -- but also their
 "semi-divine ancestor." For, says Bunsen (<em>"God
 in History," </em>vol. i, pp. 233, 234), "the Seth of
 Genesis, the father of Enoch (<em>the</em> man) must be considered
 as originally running parallel with that derived from the Elohim,
 Adam's father." "According to Bunsen, the Deity (the
 god Seth) was the <em>primitive god </em>of Northern Egypt and
 Palestine" (Staniland Wake, "The Great Pyramid").
 And Seth became considered in the later Theology of the Egyptians
 as "AN EVIL DAEMON," says the same Bunsen, for he is
 one with Typhon and one with the Hindu demons as a logical sequel.

 <em>the</em> Deva-Rishi of Occultism <em>par excellence; </em>and
 that the Occultist who does not ponder, analyse, and study Narada
 from his seven esoteric facets, will never be able to fathom certain
 anthropological, chronological, and even Cosmic Mysteries. He
 is one of the <em>Fires</em> above-mentioned, and plays a part
 in the evolution of this Kalpa from its incipient, down to its
 final stage. He is an actor who appears in each of the successive
 acts (Root-Races) of the present Manvantaric drama, in the world
 allegories which strike the key-note of esotericism, and are now
 becoming more familiar to the reader. But shall we turn to other
 ancient Scriptures and documents for the corroboration of the
 "Fires," "Sparks," and "Flames?"
 They are plentiful, if one only seeks for them in the right places.
 In the <em>"Book of the Concealed Mystery," </em>they
 are clearly enunciated, as also in the <em>"Ha Idra Zuta
 Qadisha," </em>or the lesser holy Assembly. The language
 is very mystical and veiled, yet still comprehensible. Therein,
 among the sparks of Prior Worlds, "vibrating Flames and Sparks,"
 from the divine flint, the <em>workmen </em>proceed to create
 man, "male and female" (427); which "Flames and
 Sparks" (Angels and their Worlds, Stars and Planets) are
 said, figuratively, to "become extinct and die," that
 is to say, remain <em>unmanifested </em>until a certain process
 of nature is accomplished. To show how thickly veiled from public
 view are the most important facts of anthropogenesis, two passages
 are now quoted from two Kabalistic books. The first is from the
 <em>Book of the Concealed Mystery: </em>--
 </p><p>
 (429.) From a Light-Bearer (one of the seven sacred planets) of
 insupportable brightness proceeded a radiating Flame, dashing
 off, like a vast and mighty hammer, those sparks which were the
 prior worlds.
 </p><p>
 (430.) And with most subtle ether were these intermingled and
 bound mutually together, but <em>only when they were conjoined
 together, </em>even the great Father and great Mother.
 </p><p>
 (431.) From <em>Hoa</em>, himself, is AB, the Father; and from
 Hoa, himself, is RUACH, the Spirit; who are hidden in the Ancient
 of Days, and therein is that Ether concealed.
 </p><p>
 (432.) And it was connected with a Light-Bearer (a planet and
 its angel or regent), which went forth from that Light-Bearer
 of insupportable brightness, which is hidden in the bosom of <em>Aima,
 </em>the Great Mother.*
 </p><p>
 Now the following extract from the Zohar** also deals with the
 same mystery: -- "The Pre-Adamite Kings. 'We have learned
 in the Siphrah D'Tzniootha: That the <em>At-tee'kah DAt-tee'keen,
 </em>Ancient of Ancients, before He prepared his Form, built Kings,

 Kings, and sketched out Kings (men, the Kings of the animals),
 and they could not exist: till he overthrew them <em>and hid them
 until after a time, </em>therefore it is written: 'And these are
 the Kings which reigned in the land of Edom' . . . . And they
 could not exist till <em>Resha'Hiv'rah, </em>the White Head, the
 <em>At'-tee-'kah D'At-tee'keen, </em>Ancient of Ancients, arranged
 Himself . . . . and formed all forms above and below. . . . Before
 He arranged himself in his Form had not been formed all those
 whom he desired to form, and all worlds have been destroyed .
 . . . they did not remain in their places, because the form of
 the Kings had not been formed as it ought to be, and <em>the Holy
 City had not been prepared." </em>(<em>Zohar </em>iii., 135<em>a;
 292a Idra Zootah. </em>Brody, etc.)
 </p><p>
 Now the plain meaning of these two allegorical and metaphysical
 disquisitions is simply this: Worlds and men were in turn formed
 and destroyed, <em>under the law of evolution </em>and<em> from
 pre-existing material, </em>until both the planets and their men,
 in our case our Earth and its animal and human races, became what
 they are now in the present cycle: opposite polar forces, an equilibrized
 compound of Spirit and Matter, of the positive and the negative,
 of the male and the female. Before man could become male and female
 <em>physically, </em>his prototype, the creating Elohim, had to
 arrange his Form on this sexual plane <em>astrally. </em>That
 is to say, the atoms and the organic forces, descending into the
 plane of the given differentiation, had to be marshalled in the
 order intended by Nature, so as to be ever carrying out, in an
 immaculate way, that law which the Kabala calls the <em>Balance,
 </em>through which everything that exists does so as male and
 female in its final perfection, in this present stage of materiality.
 <em>Chochmah, </em>Wisdom, the Male Sephiroth, had to diffuse
 itself <em>in</em>, and<em> through, Binah, </em>intelligent Nature,
 or Understanding. Therefore the First Root-race of men, sexless
 and mindless, had to be overthrown and "hidden until after
 a time"; <em>i.e.</em>, the first race, instead of dying,
 disappeared <em>in the second race, </em>as certain lower lives
 and plants do in their progeny. It was a wholesale transformation.
 The First became the Second Root-race, without either begetting
 it, procreating it, or dying. <em>"They passed by </em>together,"
 as it is written: "And he died and another reigned in his
 stead" (<em>Genesis</em> xxvi. 31<em> et seq. Zohar </em>iii.,
 292<em>a</em>). Why? Because "the <em>Holy City </em>had
 not been prepared." And what is the "Holy City"?
 The <em>Maquom </em>(the Secret <em>Place </em>or the Shrine)
 on Earth: in other words, the human womb, the microcosmic copy
 and reflection of the <em>Heavenly Matrix, </em>the female space
 or primeval Chaos, in which the male Spirit fecundates the germ
 of the Son, or the visible Universe.* So much so, that in the
 paragraph on "the Emanation of the Male and Female Principles"
 in the Zohar

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 85 THE SON OF YAH.</h6>
 
 <p>
 (<em>ibid.</em>)<em>, </em>it is said that, on this earth, the
 <strong>W</strong>ISDOM from the "Holy Ancient" "does
 not shine except in male and female." "<em>Hohmah, </em>Wisdom,
 is the Father, and <strong>B</strong>INAH, understanding, is the
 Mother . . . . and when they connect one with the other they bring
 forth and diffuse and emanate truth. In the sayings of Rabbi Je-yeva
 Sabah, <em>i.e.</em>, the Old, we learned this: What is Binah
 Understanding? But when they connect in one another, the [[diagram]]
 (Yod) in the [[diagram]] (Heh), they become impregnated and produce
 a Son. And, therefore, it is called <em>Binah, </em>Understanding.
 It means BeN YaH, <em>i.e.</em>, Son of YaH. This is the completeness
 of the whole."*
 </p><p>
 This is also the "completeness" of phallicism by the
 Rabbis, its perfect apotheosis, the divine being dragged into
 the animal, the sublime into the grossness of the terrestrial.
 Nothing so graphically gross exists in Eastern Occultism, nor
 in the primitive Kabala -- the "Chaldean Book of Numbers."
 We have said so in "Isis Unveiled": --
 </p><p>
 "We find it rather unwise on the part of Catholic writers
 to pour out their vials of wrath in such sentences as these: 'In
 a multitude of pagodas, the phallic stone, ever and always assuming,
 like the Grecian <em>batylos, </em>the brutally indecent form
 of the <em>lingham </em>. . . the Maha Deva.' Before casting slurs
 on a symbol whose profound metaphysical meaning is too much for
 the modern champions of that religion of sensualism <em>par excellence,
 </em>Roman Catholicism, to grasp, they are in duty bound to destroy
 their oldest churches, and change the form of the cupolas of their
 own temples. The Mahody of Elephanta, the Round Tower of Bhangulpore,
 the minarets of Islam -- either rounded or pointed -- are the
 originals of the <em>Campanile </em>column of San Marco, at Venice,
 of the Rochester Cathedral, and of the modern Duomo of Milan.
 All of these steeples, turrets, domes, and Christian temples,
 are the reproductions of the primitive idea of the <em>lithos,
 </em>the upright phallus." (Vol. II., p. 5.)
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, and however it may be, the fact that all these Hebrew
 Elohim, Sparks, and Cherubs are identical with the Devas, Rishis
 and the Fires and Flames, the Rudras and the forty-nine Agnis
 of the ancient Aryas, is sufficiently proven by and in the Kabala.
