 <h4>ADAM-ADAMI.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>N</strong>AMES such as Adam-Adami, used by Mr. Chwolsohn
 in his "Nabathean Agriculture"* and derided by M. Renan,
 may prove little to the profane. To the Occultist, however, once
 that the term is found in a work of such immense antiquity as
 the above cited, it proves a good deal: for instance that <em>Adami
 </em>was a manifold symbol, originating with the Aryan people,
 as the root word shows, and having been taken from them by the
 Semites and the Turanians -- as many other things were.
 </p><p>
 "Adam-Adami" is a generic compound name as old as languages
 are. The Secret Doctrine teaches that <em>Ad</em>-i was the name
 given to the first <em>speaking </em>race of mankind -- in this
 Round -- by the Aryans. Hence the <em>Adonim </em>and <em>Adonai
 </em>(the ancient plural form of the word <em>Adon</em>)<em>,
 </em>which the Jews applied to their Jehovah and angels, who were
 simply the first spiritual and ethereal sons of the earth; and
 the god Adonis, who in his many variations stood for the "First
 Lord." Adam is the Sanskrit <em>Ada-Nath, </em>also meaning
 first Lord, as <em>Ad</em>-Iswara, or any <em>Ad </em>(the first)
 followed by any adjective or substantive. The reason for this
 is that such truths were a common inheritance. It was a revelation
 received by the <em>first</em> mankind before that time which,
 in Biblical phraseology, is called "the period of one <i>lip
 </i>and word," or speech; knowledge expanded by man's own
 intuition later on, but still later hidden from profanation under
 an adequate symbology. The author of the "Qabbalah, (according
 to), the philosophical writings of Ibn Gebirol," shows the
 Israelite using "<em>Ad</em>onai," (Lord) instead of
 <em>Eh</em>'<em>yeh </em>(<em>I am</em>)<em> </em>and <i>YHVH</i>,
 and adds that, while <em>Ad</em>onai is rendered "Lord"
 in the Bible, "the lowest designation, or the Deity in Nature,
 the more general term Elohim, is translated God." (p. 175.)
 </p><p>
 A curious work was translated in 1860 or thereabout, by the Orientalist
 Chwolsohn, and presented to ever-incredulous and flippant Europe
 under the innocent title of <em>Nabathean Agriculture. </em>In
 the opinion of the translator that archaic volume <em>is </em>"<em>a
 complete initiation </em>into the mysteries of the pre-Adamite
 nations, on the authority of <em>undeniably authentic</em> <em>documents.</em>"<em>
 </em>It is "an invaluable compendium, the full epitome of
 the Doctrines held, of the arts and sciences, not only of the
 Chaldeans, but also of the Assyrians and Canaanites of the prehistoric
 ages." These

 <p>
 "<em>Nabatheans</em>"<em> -- </em>as some critics thought
 -- were simply the Sabeans, or Chaldean star-worshippers. The
 work is a retranslation from the Arabic, into which language it
 was at first translated from the Chaldean.
 </p><p>
 Masoudi, the Arabic Historian, speaks of those <em>Nabatheans,
 </em>and explains their origin in this wise: "After the Deluge
 (?) the nations established themselves in various countries. Among
 these were the Nabatheans, who founded the city of Babylon, and
 were those descendants of Ham who settled in the same province
 under the leadership of Nimrod, the son of Cush, who was the son
 of Ham, and great-grandson of Noah. . . . . This took place at
 the time when Nimrod received the governorship of Babylonia as
 the delegate of Dzahhak named Biurasp."
 </p><p>
 The translator, Chwolsohn, finds that the assertions of this historian
 are in perfect accord with those of Moses in <em>Genesis; </em>while
 more irreverent critics might express the opinion that for this
 very reason their truth should be suspected. It is useless to
 argue this point, which is of no value in the present question.
 The weather-beaten, long-since-buried problem, and the difficulty
 of accounting, on any logical ground, for the phenomenal derivation
 of millions of people of various races, of many civilized nations
 and tribes, from <em>three </em>couples (Noah's sons) in 346 years*
 after the Deluge, may be left to the Karma of the author of <em>Genesis,
 </em>whether he is called Moses or Ezra. That which is interesting
 in the work noticed is its contents, the doctrines enunciated
 in it, which are again, if read esoterically, almost all of them
 identical with the Secret Teachings.
 </p><p>
 Quatremere suggested that this book might have been simply a copy
 made under Nebuchadnezzar <strong>II</strong>., from some Hamitic
 treatise, "infinitely more ancient," while the author
 maintains, on "internal and external evidence," that
 its Chaldean original was written out from the oral discourses
 and teachings of a wealthy Babylonian landowner, named Qu-tamy,
 who had used for those lectures still more ancient materials.
 The first Arabic translation is placed by Chwolsohn so far back
 as the <strong>XIII</strong>. cent. <strong>B</strong>.<strong>C</strong>.
 On the first page of this "revelation," the author,
 or <em>amanuensis, </em>Qu-tamy, declares that "the doctrines
 propounded therein, were originally told by <em>Saturn to the
 Moon, who</em> <em>communicated them to her idol, which idol revealed
 them to her devotee,</em> <em>the writer </em>-- the adept Scribe
 of that work -- Qu-tamy.
 </p><p>
 The details given by the God for the benefit and instruction of
 mortals, show periods of incalculable duration and a series of
 numberless kingdoms and <em>Dynasties </em>that preceded the appearance
 on Earth of

 <em>Adami </em>(the "red-earth"). These periods have
 aroused, as might have been expected, the defenders of the chronology
 of the Biblical dead-letter meaning almost to fury. De Rougemont
 was the first to make a <em>levee</em>-in-arms against the translator.
 He reproaches him* with "<em>sacrificing </em>Moses to an
 anonymous author." Berosus, he urges, "however great
 were <em>his chronological errors, </em>was at least in perfect
 accord with the prophet with regard to the first men, since he
 speaks of <em>Alorus-Adam, </em>of <em>Xisuthrus-Noah, </em>and
 of <em>Belus-Nimrod,</em>"<em> </em>etc. "Therefore,"
 he adds, "the work <em>must be </em>an <strong>A</strong>POCRYPHA
 to be ranged with its contemporaries -- <em>the</em> <em>fourth
 book of Esdras, that of Enoch, </em>the <em>Sibylline Oracles,
 </em>and the <em>Book of Hermes -- every one of these dating</em>
 <em>no further back than two or three centuries </em><strong>B</strong><em>.</em><strong>C</strong><em>.</em>"<em>
 </em>Ewald came down still harder on Chwolsohn, and finally M.
 Renan. In the "<em>Revue</em> <em>Germanique,</em>"<em>**
 </em>the ex-pupil pulls down the authority of his master, by asking
 him to show a reason why his <em>Nabathean Agriculture </em>should
 not be the fraudulent work of some Jew of the third or fourth
 century of our era? It can hardly be otherwise -- argues the romancer
 of the "Life of Jesus." Since, in this <em>in-folio
 </em>on astrology and Sorcery we recognise in the personages introduced
 by Qu-tamy, all the patriarchs of the Biblical legends, such as
 <em>Adam-Adami, Anouka-Noah,</em> and his <em>Ibrahim-Abraham
 </em>etc., etc."
 </p><p>
 This is no reason, since Adam and others are generic names. Meanwhile
 it is humbly submitted that, all things considered, an <em>apocrypha
 -- </em>if even of the third century <strong>A</strong>.<strong>D</strong>.,
 instead of the thirteenth century <strong>B.C</strong>., as suggested
 by Quatremere -- is old enough to appear <em>genuine </em>as a
 document, and so satisfy the demands of the most exacting archaeologist
 and critic. For, even admitting, for argument's sake, that this
 literary relic has been compiled by "some Jew of the third
 century of our era" -- what of that? Leaving the credibility
 of its doctrines for a moment aside, why should it be less entitled
 to a hearing, or less instructive as reflecting older opinions,
 than any other religious work, also a "compilation from old
 texts" or oral tradition -- of the same or even a later age?
 In such case we should have to reject and call "apocryphal"
 the Quran -- two centuries older, though we know it to have sprung,
 Minerva-like, direct from the brain of the Arabian prophet; and
 we should have to pooh-pooh all the information we can get from
 the <em>Talmud, </em>which, in its present form, was also compiled
 from older materials, and is not earlier than the <strong>IX</strong>.
 century of our era.
 </p><p>
 The curious "Bible" of the Chaldean adept, and the various
 criticisms upon it (as in the Chwolsohn's translation), are noticed,
 because it has an important bearing upon a great portion of the
 present work.

 <p>
 With the exception of M. Renan, an iconoclast by principle --
 so pointedly called by Jules Lemaitre "<em>le Paganini du
 Neant</em>"<em> -- </em>the worst fault found with the work
 is, it would seem, that the "apocrypha" pretends to
 have been communicated <em>as a revelation </em>to an adept by,
 and from, the "idol of the moon," who received it from
 "Saturn." Hence, very naturally, it is "a fairy
 tale all round." To this there is but one answer: it is no
 more a fairy tale than the Bible, and if one falls, the other
 must follow it. Even the mode of divination through "the
 idol of the moon" is the same as practised by David, Saul,
 and the High Priests of the Jewish Tabernacle by means of the
 Teraphim. In Volume <strong>III</strong>., Part <strong>II</strong>.
 of this present work, the practical methods of such ancient divination
 will be found.
 </p><p>
 The "Nabathean Agriculture" is a compilation indeed;
 it is no apocrypha, but the repetition of the tenets of the Secret
 Doctrine under the exoteric Chaldean form of national symbols,
 for the purpose of "cloaking" the tenets, just as the
 Books of Hermes and the Puranas are Egyptian and Hindu attempts
 at the same. The work was as well known in antiquity as it was
 during the Middle Ages. Maimonides speaks of it, and refers more
 than once to this Chaldeo-Arabic <strong>MS</strong>., calling
 the Nabatheans by their co-religionary name, <em>i.e</em>., "star-worshippers,"
 or Sabeans, but yet failing to see in this disfigured word "Nabatheans"
 the mystic name of the caste devoted to <em>Nebo </em>(god of
 <em>secret </em>wisdom), which shows on its face that the <em>Nabatheans
 </em>were an occult Brotherhood.* The Nabatheans who, according
 to the Persian Yezidi, originally came to Syria from Busrah, were
 the degenerate members of that fraternity; still their religion,
 even at that late day, was purely Kabalistic.** Nebo is the deity
 of the planet Mercury, and Mercury is the god of Wisdom or Hermes,
 and <em>Budha,</em> which the Jews called <img src="sd2-455.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 "the Lord on high, the aspiring," . . . and the Greeks
 Nabo, [[<em>Nabo</em>]], hence Nabatheans. Notwithstanding that
 Maimonides calls their doctrines "heathenish foolishness"
 and their archaic literature "<em>Sabaeorum foetum,</em>"<em>
 </em>he places their "agriculture," the Bible of Qu-tamy,
 in the first rank of Archaic literature; and Abarbinel

 * "I will mention to thee the writings . . . respecting <em>the
 belief of the Sabeans,</em>" he says. "The most famous
 is the Book 'The <em>Agriculture of the Nabatheans,</em>'<em>
 which</em><i> </i>has been translated by <em>Ibn Wahohijah. </em>This
 book is full of heathenish foolishness. . . . It speaks of preparations
 of <strong>T</strong>ALISMANS, the drawing down of the powers
 of the <strong>S</strong>PIRITS, <strong>M</strong>AGIC, <strong>D</strong>EMONS,
 and ghouls, which make their abode in the desert." (Maimonides,
 quoted by Dr. D. Chwolsohn, "Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus,"
 <strong>II</strong>., p. 458.) The Nabatheans of Mount Lebanon
 believed in the Seven Archangels, as their forefathers had believed
 in the Seven Great Stars, the abodes and bodies of these Archangels,
 believed in to this day by the Roman Catholics, as is shown elsewhere.

 <p>
 praises it in unmeasured terms. Spencer, quoting the latter, speaks
 of it as that "most excellent Oriental work," adding
 (vol. 1., p. 354) that by Nabatheans, the Sabeans, the Chaldeans,
 and the Egyptians, in short all those nations <em>against whom
 the laws of Moses were most</em> <em>severely enacted, </em>have
 to be understood.
 </p><p>
 Nebo, the oldest God of Wisdom of Babylonia and Mesopotamia, was
 identical with the Hindu Budha and Hermes-Mercury of the Greeks.
 A slight change in the sexes of the parents is the only alteration.
 As Budha was the Son of Soma (the Moon) in India, and of the wife
 of Brihaspati (Jupiter), so Nebo was the son of Zarpa-nitu (the
 Moon deity) and of Merodach, who had become Jupiter, after having
 been a Sun God. As Mercury the planet, Nebo was the "overseer"
 among the seven gods of the planets; and as the personification
 of the Secret Wisdom he was <em>Nabin, </em>a seer and a prophet.
 The fact that Moses is made to die and disappear on the mount
 sacred to Nebo, shows him an initiate and a priest of that god
 under another name; for this God of Wisdom was the great creative
 deity, and was worshipped as such, not alone at Borsippa in his
 gorgeous Temple, or planet-tower. He was likewise adored by the
 Moabites, the Canaanites, the Assyrians, and throughout the whole
 of Palestine: then why not by the Israelites? "The planetary
 temple of Babylon" had "its holy of holies" within
 the shrine of Nebo, the prophet god of Wisdom. We are told in
 the Hibbert Lectures, "The ancient Babylonians had an intercessor
 between men and the gods . . . and Nebo, was the 'proclaimer'
 or 'prophet,' as he made known the desire of his father Merodach."
 </p><p>
 Nebo is a creator, like Budha, of the Fourth and also of the Fifth
 Race. For the former starts a new race of Adepts, and the latter,
 the <em>Solar-Lunar </em>Dynasty, or the men of these Races and
 Round. Both are the Adams of their respective creatures. Adam-Adami
 is a personation of the <em>dual </em>Adam: of the paradigmic
 Adam-Kadmon, the creator, and of the lower Adam, the terrestrial,
 who, as the Syrian Kabalists have it, had only <em>nephesh, </em>"the
 breath of life," but <em>no living</em> <em>soul, </em>until
 after his Fall.
 </p><p>
 If, therefore, Renan persists in regarding the Chaldean Scriptures
 -- or what remains of them -- as apocryphal, it is quite immaterial
 to truth and fact. There are other Orientalists who may be of
 a different opinion; and even were they not, it would still really
 matter very little. These doctrines contain the teachings of Esoteric
 philosophy, and this must suffice. To those who understand nothing
 of symbology it may appear astrolatry, pure and simple, or to
 him who would conceal the esoteric truth, even "heathenish
 foolishness." Maimonides, however, while expressing scorn
 for the esotericism in the religion of other nations, confessed
 esotericism and symbology in his own, preached</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 457 THE KABALISTIC FOUR ADAMS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 silence and secresy upon the true meaning of Mosaic sayings, and
 thus came to grief. The Doctrines of Qu-tamy, the Chaldean, are,
 in short, the allegorical rendering of the religion of the earliest
 nations of the Fifth Race.
 </p><p>
 Why then should M. Renan treat the name "Adam-Adami"
 with such academical contempt? The author of the "Origins
 of Christianity" evidently knows nothing of the "<em>origins
 of pagan </em>symbolism" or of Esotericism either, otherwise
 he would have known that the name was a form of universal symbol,
 referring, <em>even with the Jews, </em>not to one man, but to
 four distinct humanities or mankinds. This is very easily proven.
 </p><p>
 The Kabalists teach the existence of four distinct Adams, or the
 transformation of four consecutive Adams, the emanations from
 the <em>Dyooknah </em>(divine phantom) of the Heavenly Man, an
 ethereal combination of Neschamah, the highest Soul or Spirit:
 this Adam having, of course, neither a gross human body, nor a
 <em>body of desire. </em>This "Adam" is the prototype
 (<em>tzure</em>) of the second Adam. That they represent our Five
 Races is certain, as everyone can see by their description in
 the Kabala: the first being the "perfect, Holy Adam";
 . . . "a shadow that disappeared" (the Kings of Edom)
 produced from the divine <em>Tzelem </em>(Image); the second is
 called the protoplastic androgyne Adam of the future terrestrial
 and separated Adam; the third Adam is the man made of "dust"
 (the first, innocent Adam); and the fourth, is the supposed forefather
 of our own race -- the Fallen Adam. See, however, the admirably
 clear description of these in Mr. Isaac Myer's "Qabbalah,"
 p. 418, <em>et seq. </em>He gives only four Adams, because of
 the Kings of Edom, no doubt. "The fourth Adam," he writes,
 " . . . . was clothed with skin, flesh, nerves, etc. This
 answers to the Lower <em>Nephesch</em> and <em>Guff, i.e., </em>body,
 united. He has the animal power of reproduction and continuance
 of species," and this is the <em>human</em> Root-Race.
 </p><p>
 It is just at this point that the modern Kabalists -- led into
 error by the long generations of Christian mystics who have tampered
 with the Kabalistic records wherever they could -- diverge from
 the Occultists in their interpretations, and take the later thought
 for the earlier idea. The original Kabala was entirely metaphysical,
 and had no concern with animal, or terrestrial sexes; the later
 Kabala has suffocated the divine ideal under the heavy phallic
 element. The Kabalists say: -- "God made man male and female."
 "Among the Qabbalists, the necessity to continued creation
 and existence is called the Balance," says the author of
 <em>Qabbalah; </em>and being without this "Balance,"
 connected with <em>Ma-qom </em>(mysterious place),* even the First
 Race is not,

 <p>
 as we have seen, recognized by the Sons of the Fifth Adam. From
 the highest Heavenly Man, the upper Adam who is "male female"
 or Androgyne, down to the Adam of dust, these personified symbols
 are all connected with sex and procreation. With the Eastern Occultists
 it is entirely the reverse. The sexual relation they consider
 as a "Karma" pertaining only to the mundane relation
 of man, who is dominated by Illusion, a thing to be put aside,
 the moment that the person becomes "wise." They considered
 it a most fortunate circumstance if the Guru (teacher) found in
 his pupil an aptitude for the pure life of Brahmacharya. Their
 dual symbols were to them but the poetical imagery of the sublime
 correlation of creative Cosmic forces. And this ideal conception
 is found beaming like a golden ray upon each idol, however coarse
 and grotesque, in the crowded galleries of the sombre fanes of
 India and other Mother lands of cults.
 </p><p>
 This will be demonstrated in the following Section.
 </p><p>
 Meanwhile, it may be added that, with the Gnostics, the second
 Adam also emanates from the Primeval Man, the Ophite <em>Adamas,
 </em>in "whose image he is made"; the third, from this
 second -- an Androgyne. The latter is symbolized in the 6th and
 7th pairs of the male-female AEons, --Amphian-Essumene, and Vannanin-Lamer
 (Father and Mother; <em>vide</em> Valentinian Table, in Epiphanius)
 -- while the fourth Adam, or Race, is represented by a Priapean
 monster. The latter -- a post-Christian fancy -- is the degraded
 copy of the ante-Christian Gnostic symbol of the "Good One,"
 or "He, <em>who created before anything existed</em>,"
 the Celestial Priapus -- truly born from Venus and Bacchus <em>when</em>
 <em>that</em> <em>God returned from his expedition into India,
 </em>for Venus and Bacchus are the post-types of Aditi and the
 Spirit. The later Priapus, one, however, with Agathodaemon, the
 Gnostic Saviour, and even with Abraxas, is no longer the glyph
 for <em>abstract creative </em>Power, but symbolizes the four
 Adams, or Races, the fifth being represented by the <em>five</em>
 branches cut off from the Tree of Life on which the old man stands
 in the Gnostic gems. The number of the Root-Races was recorded
 in the ancient Greek temples by the seven vowels, of which <em>five</em>
 were framed in a panel in the Initiation halls of the Adyta. The
 Egyptian glyph for it was a hand with five fingers spread, the
 fifth or little finger being only half-grown, and also <em>five</em>
 "<strong>N</strong>'s" -- hieroglyphs standing for that
 letter. The Romans used the five vowels <strong>A E I O V</strong>
 in their fanes; and this archaic symbol was adopted during the
 middle ages as a motto by the House of the Hapsburgs. <em>Sic
 transit gloria!</em>
