 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>The phrase "through the seven Worlds
 of Maya" refers here to the seven globes of the planetary
 chain and the seven rounds, or the 49 stations of active existence
 that are before the "Spark" or Monad, at the beginning
 of every "Great Life-Cycle" or Manvantara. The "thread
 of Fohat" is the thread of life before referred to.
 </p><p>
 This relates to the greatest problem of philosophy -- the physical
 and substantial nature of life, the independent nature of which
 is denied by modern science because that science is unable to
 comprehend it. The reincarnationists and believers in Karma alone
 dimly perceive that the whole secret of Life is in the unbroken
 series of its manifestations: whether in, or apart from, the physical
 body. Because if --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,<br>
 Stains the white radiance of Eternity" --
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 yet it is itself part and parcel of that Eternity; for life alone
 can understand life.
 </p><p>
 What is that "Spark" which "hangs from the flame?"
 It is <strong>J</strong>IVA, the MONAD in conjunction with MANAS,
 or rather its aroma -- that which remains from each personality,
 when worthy, and hangs from Atma-Buddhi, the Flame, by the thread
 of life. In whatever way interpreted, and into whatever number
 of principles the human being is divided, it may easily be shown
 that this doctrine is supported by all the ancient</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 239 CHALDEAN METAPHYSICS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 religions, from the Vedic to the Egyptian, from the Zoroastrian
 to the Jewish. In the case of the last-mentioned, the Kabalistic
 works offer abundant proof of this statement. The entire system
 of the Kabalistic numerals is based on the divine septenary hanging
 from the Triad (thus forming the <em>Decade</em>)<em> </em>and
 its permutations 7, 5, 4, and 3, which, finally, all merge into
 the ONE itself: an endless and boundless Circle.
 </p><p>
 "The Deity (the ever Invisible Presence)," says the
 Zohar, "manifests itself through the <em>ten</em> Sephiroth
 which are its radiating witnesses. The Deity is like the Sea from
 which outflows a stream called WISDOM, the waters of which fall
 into a lake named Intelligence. From the basin, like seven channels,
 issue the Seven Sephiroth. . . . . For <em>ten equal seven: </em>the
 Decade contains <em>four </em>Unities and <em>three </em>Binaries."
 The ten Sephiroth correspond to the limbs of MAN. "When I
 framed Adam Kadmon," the Elohim are made to say, "the
 Spirit of the Eternal shot out of his Body like a sheet of lightning
 that radiated at once on the billows of the <i>Seven </i>millions
 of skies, and my <em>ten</em> splendours were his limbs."
 But neither the Head nor the shoulders of Adam-Kadmon can be seen;
 therefore we read in the <em>Sephra Dzenioutha </em>(the "Book
 of the Concealed Mystery"): --
 </p><p>
 "In the beginning of Time, after the Elohim (the "Sons
 of Light and Life," or the "Builders") had shaped
 out of the eternal Essence the Heavens and the Earth, they formed
 the worlds six by six, the seventh being <em>Malkuth</em>,<em>
 </em>which is our Earth (see <em>Mantuan Codex</em>)<em> </em>on
 its plane, and the lowest on all the other planes of conscious
 existence. The Chaldean <em>Book of Numbers </em>contains a detailed
 explanation of all this. "The first triad of the body of
 Adam Kadmon (the three upper planes of the seven*) cannot be seen
 before the soul stands in the presence of the Ancient of Days."
 The Sephiroth of this upper triad are: -- "1,<em> Kether
 </em>(the Crown) represented by the brow of Macroprosopos; 2,<em>
 Chochmah </em>(Wisdom, a male Principle) by his right shoulder;
 and 3, <em>Binah </em>(Intelligence, a female Principle) by the
 left shoulder." Then come the <em>seven </em>limbs (or Sephiroth)
 on the planes of manifestation, the totality of these four planes
 being represented by <em>Microprosopus</em> (the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The formation of the "living Soul" or man, would render
 the idea more clearly. "A Living Soul" is a synonym
 of man in the Bible. These are our seven "Principles."
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 240 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 lesser Face) or Tetragrammaton, the "four-lettered"
 Mystery. "The seven manifested and the <em>three</em> concealed
 limbs are the Body of the Deity."
 </p><p>
 Thus our Earth, <em>Malkuth</em>,<em> </em>is both the <em>Seventh
 </em>and the <em>Fourth </em>world, the former when counting from
 the first globe above, the latter if reckoned by the planes. It
 is generated by the sixth globe or Sephiroth called <em>Yezod</em>,
 "foundation," or as said in the Book of Numbers "by
 Yezod, He (Adam Kadmon) fecundates the primitive Heva" (Eve
 or our Earth). Rendered in mystic language this is the explanation
 why Malkuth, called "the inferior Mother," Matrona,
 Queen, and the Kingdom of the Foundation, is shown as the <em>Bride
 </em>of Tetragrammaton or Microprosopus (the 2nd Logos) the Heavenly
 Man. When free from all impurity she will become united with the
 Spiritual <em>Logos</em>,<em> i.e.</em>,<em> </em>in the 7th Race
 of the 7th Round -- after the regeneration, on the day of "<strong>S</strong>ABBATH."
 For the "<em>seventh </em>day" has again an occult significance
 undreamt of by our theologians.
 </p><p>
 "When Matronitha, the Mother, is separated and brought face
 to face with the King, in the excellence of the Sabbath, all things
 become one body," says verse 746, in chapter xxii. of "Ha
 Idra Zuta Kadisha." "Becomes one body" means that
 all is reabsorbed once more into the one element, the spirits
 of men becoming <em>Nirvanees </em>and the elements of everything
 else becoming again what they were before -- <em>protyle</em>
 or undifferentiated substance. "Sabbath" means <em>rest
 </em>or Nirvana. It is not the <em>seventh </em>day after <em>six
 </em>days but a period the duration of which equals that of the
 seven "days" or any period made up of seven parts. Thus
 a <em>pralaya </em>is equal in duration to the manwantara, or
 a night of Brahma is equal to this "day." If the Christians
 will follow Jewish customs they ought to adopt the spirit and
 not the dead letter thereof: <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>to work one
 week of seven days and <em>rest </em>seven days. That the word
 "Sabbath" had a mystic significance is shown in the
 contempt shown by Jesus for the Sabbath day, and by what is said
 in Luke xviii. 12. Sabbath is there taken <em>for the whole week.
 </em>(See Greek text where the week is called <em>Sabbath. </em>"I
 fast twice in the Sabbath.") Paul, an Initiate, knew it well
 when referring to the eternal rest and felicity in heaven, as
 Sabbath; "and their happiness will be eternal, for they will
 ever be (<em>one</em>)<em> </em>with the Lord and will enjoy <em>an
 eternal Sabbath.</em>"<em> </em>(Hebrew iv. 2.)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 241 THE TRUE AND THE FALSE KABALA.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The difference between the two systems, taking the Kabala as contained
 in the Chaldean <em>Book of Numbers</em>,<em> </em>not as misrepresented
 by its now disfigured copy, the Kabala of the Christian mystics
 --the Kabala and the archaic esoteric Vidya, is very small indeed,
 being confined to unimportant divergences of form and expression.
 Thus Eastern occultism refers to our earth as the fourth world,
 the lowest of the chain, above which run upward on both its sides
 the six globes, three on each side. <em>The Zohar</em>,<em> </em>on
 the other hand, calls the earth the lower, or the <em>Seventh</em>,<em>
 </em>adding that upon the six depend all things which are in it,
 "Microprosopus." The "smaller face," smaller
 because manifested and finite, "is formed of <em>six Sephiroth</em>,"<em>
 </em>says the same work. "Seven kings come and <em>die in
 the thrice</em>-<em>destroyed world</em>" --<em> </em>(Malkuth
 our earth, destroyed after each of the three rounds which it has
 gone through). "And their reign (of the seven kings) will
 be broken up." (<em>Book of Numbers</em>,<em> </em>1.<em>
 </em>viii., 3.) This relates to the Seven Races, five of which
 have already appeared, and two more have still to appear in this
 Round.
 </p><p>
 The Shinto allegorical accounts of Cosmogony and the origin of
 man in Japan hint at the same belief.
 </p><p>
 Captain C. Pfoundes studied for nearly nine years in the monasteries
 of Japan the religion underlying the various sects of the land.
 . . . . . "The Shinto idea of creation," he says, "is
 as follows: Out of chaos (<em>Konton</em>)<em> </em>the earth
 (<i>in</i>) was the sediment precipitated, and the Heavens (<em>yo</em>)<em>
 </em>the ethereal essences which ascended: <em>Maa </em>(<em>jin</em>)<em>
 </em>appeared between the two. The first man was called Kuni-to
 ko tatchi-no-mikoto, and <em>five other names were given to him</em>,<em>
 </em>and then the human race appeared, male and female. Isanagi
 and Isanami begat <em>Tenshoko doijin</em>,<em> </em>the first
 of the five gods of the Earth." These "gods" are
 simply our five races, Isanagi and Isanami being the two kinds
 of the "ancestors," the two preceding races which give
 birth to animal and to rational man.
 </p><p>
 It will be shown (Vol. II. Pt. II.) that the number seven, as
 well as the doctrine of the septenary constitution of man, was
 pre-eminent in all the secret systems. It plays as important a
 part in Western Kabala as in Eastern Occultism. Eliphas Levi calls
 the number seven "the key to the Mosaic creation and the
 symbols of every religion." He shows the Kabala following
 faithfully even the septenary division of man, as the diagram
 he gives in his "<em>Clef des Grands Mysteres</em>"<em>
 </em>is septenary. This</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 242 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 may be seen at a glance on page 389, "<em>Une prophetic et
 diverses pensees de Paracelse</em>,"<em> </em>however cleverly
 the correct thought is veiled. One needs also only to look at
 the diagram (Plate VII. in Mr. Mathers' Kabala) "the formation
 of the Soul"* from the same "Key of the Great Mysteries"
 by Levi to find the same, though with a different interpretation.
 </p><p>
 Thus it stands with both the Kabalistic and the Occult names attached:

 * Nephesch is the "breath of (animal) life" breathed
 into Adam, the man of dust; it is consequently the <em>Vital Spark</em>,<em>
 </em>the informing element. Without <em>Manas</em>,<em> </em>or
 what is miscalled in Levi's diagram Nephesch instead of Manas,
 "the reasoning Soul," or mind, Atma-Buddhi are irrational
 on this plane and cannot act. It is Buddhi which is the plastic
 mediator, not Manas, "the intelligent medium between the
 upper Triad and the lower Quaternary." But there are many
 such strange and curious transformations to be found in the Kabalistic
 works -- a convincing proof that its literature has become a sad
 jumble. We do not accept the classification except in this one
 particular, in order to show the points of agreement.</p><hr>

 We will now give in tabular form what the very cautious Eliphas
 Levi says in explanation of his diagram, and what the Esoteric
 Doctrine teaches -- and compare the two. Levi, too, makes a distinction
 between Kabalistic and Occult Pneumatics. (See "<em>Histoire

 * Eliphas Levi has, whether purposely or otherwise, confused the
 numbers: with us his No. 2 is No. 1. (Spirit); and by making of
 Nephesch both the plastic mediator and Life, he thus makes in
 reality only six principles, because he repeats the first two.
 </p><p>
 ** Esotericism teaches the same. But Manas is not Nephesch; nor
 is the latter the astral, but the 4th principle, if also the 2nd
 <em>prana</em>,<em> </em>for Nephesch is the "breath of life"
 in man, as in beast or insect, of physical, material life, which
 has no spirituality in it.</p><hr>

 It is very evident that the French Kabalist either did not know
 sufficiently the real tenet, or distorted it to suit himself and
 his object. Thus he says again, treating upon the same subject,
 and we, Occultists, answer the late Kabalist and his admirers:
 --
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 1. The body is the mould of Nephesch; Nephesch the mould of Ruach;
 Ruach the mould <em>of</em> <em>the garments of Neschamah.</em>
 <br>
 2. Light (the Soul) personifies in clothing itself (with a body);
 and personality endures only when the garment is perfect. <br>
 3. The angels aspire to become men; a perfect man, a man-god is
 above all the angels.<br>
 4. Every 14,000 years the soul rejuvenates and rests in the jubilean
 sleep of oblivion.
 </p><p>
 [[second column]]
 </p><p>
 1. The body follows the whims, good or bad, of <em>Manas; </em>Manas
 tries to follow the light of Buddhi, but often fails. Buddhi is
 the mould of the "garments" of Atma, because Atma is
 no body, or shape, or anything, and because Buddhi is its vehicle
 only <em>figuratively.</em> <br>
 2<em>.</em> The Monad becomes a personal ego when it incarnates;
 and something remains of that personality through Manas, when
 the latter is perfect enough to assimilate Buddhi.<br>
 3. Correct.<br>
 4. Within a period, "a great age" or a day of Brahrna,
 14 Manus reign; after which comes Pralaya when all the Souls rest
 in Nirvana. (Souls = Egos).</p><hr>

 Such are the distorted copies of the esoteric doctrine in the
 Kabala. But see also "The Primeval Manus of Humanity"
 in Book II.
 </p><p>
 To return to Stanza VII.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>The well-known Kabalistic aphorism runs:
 -- "A stone becomes a plant; a plant, a beast; the beast,
 a man; a man a spirit; and the spirit a god." The "spark"
 animates all the kingdoms in turn before it enters into and informs
 divine man, between whom and his predecessor, animal man, there
 is all the difference in the world. Genesis begins its anthropology
 at the wrong end (evidently for a blind) and lands nowhere.* Had
 it begun as it ought, one would have found in it, first, the celestial
 Logos, the "Heavenly Man," which evolves as a Compound
 Unit of Logoi, out of whom after their pralayic sleep -- a sleep
 that gathers the cyphers scattered on the Mayavic plane into One,
 as the separate globules of quicksilver on a plate blend into
 one mass -- the Logoi appear in their totality as the first "male
 and female" or Adam Kadmon, the "Fiat Lux" of the
 Bible, as we have already seen. But this transformation did not
 take place on our Earth, nor on any material plane, but in the
 Spacial Depths of the first differentiation of the eternal Root-matter.
 On our nascent globe things proceed differently. The Monad or
 Jiva, as said in "Isis Unveiled," vol. i., p. 302, is,
 first of all, shot down by the law of Evolution into the lowest
 form of matter -- the mineral. After a sevenfold gyration encased
 in the stone (or that which will become mineral and stone in the
 Fourth Round), it creeps out of it, say, as a lichen. Passing
 thence, through all the forms of vegetable matter, into what is
 termed animal matter, it has now reached the point in which it
 has become the germ, so to speak, of the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The introductory chapters of Genesis were never meant to represent
 even a remote allegory of the creation of our Earth. They embrace
 a metaphysical conception of some indefinite period in the eternity,
 when successive attempts were being made by the law of evolution
 at the formation of universes. The idea is plainly stated in the
 Zohar: "There were old worlds, which perished as soon as
 they came into existence, were formless, and were called Sparks.
 Thus, the smith, when hammering the iron, lets the sparks fly
 in all directions. The sparks are the primordial worlds, which
 could not continue because the <em>Sacred Aged </em>(Sephira)
 had not as yet assumed its form (of androgyne, or opposite sexes)
 of King and Queen (Sephira and Kadmon), and the Master was not
 yet at his work." See Zohar, "Idra Suta," Book
 iii., p. 292, <em>b. </em>The Supreme consulting with the Architect
 of the world -- his Logos -- about creation. ("Isis Unveiled,"
 vol. ii., p. 421.)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 247 SPIRIT ALONE IS HELPLESS ON EARTH.</h6>
 
 <p>
 animal, that will become the physical man. All this, up to the
 Third Round, is formless, as matter, and senseless, as consciousness.
 For the Monad or Jiva <em>per se </em>cannot be even called spirit:
 it is a ray, a breath of the <strong>A</strong>BSOLUTE, or the
 Absoluteness rather, and the Absolute Homogeneity, having no relations
 with the conditioned and relative finiteness, is unconscious on
 our plane. Therefore, besides the material which will be needed
 for its future human form, the monad requires (<em>a</em>) a spiritual
 model, or prototype, for that material to shape itself into; and
 (<em>b</em>) an intelligent consciousness to guide its evolution
 and progress, neither of which is possessed by the homogeneous
 monad, or by senseless though living matter. The Adam of dust
 requires the <em>Soul of Life </em>to be breathed into him: the
 two middle principles, which are the <em>sentient </em>life of
 the irrational animal and the Human Soul, for the former is irrational
 without the latter. It is only when, from a potential androgyne,
 man has become separated into male and female, that he will be
 endowed with this conscious, rational, individual Soul, (<em>Manas</em>)<em>
 </em>"the principle, or the intelligence, of the Elohim,"
 to receive which, he has to eat of the fruit of Knowledge from
 the Tree of Good and Evil. How is he to obtain all this? The Occult
 doctrine teaches that while the monad is cycling on downward into
 matter, these very Elohim -- or Pitris, the lower Dhyan-Chohans
 -- are evolving <em>pari passu </em>with it on a higher and more
 spiritual plane, descending also relatively into matter on their
 own plane of consciousness, when, after having reached a certain
 point, they will meet the incarnating senseless monad, encased
 in the lowest matter, and blending the two potencies, Spirit and
 Matter, the union will produce that terrestrial symbol of the
 "Heavenly Man" in space -- PERFECT MAN. In the Sankhya
 philosophy, Purusha (spirit) is spoken of as something impotent
 unless he mounts on the shoulders of Prakriti (matter), which,
 left alone, is -- senseless. But in the secret philosophy they
 are viewed as graduated. Though one and the same thing in their
 origin, Spirit and Matter, when once they are on the plane of
 differentiation, begin each of them their evolutionary progress
 in contrary directions -- Spirit falling gradually into matter,
 and the latter ascending to its original condition, that of a
 pure spiritual substance. Both are inseparable, yet ever separated.
 In polarity, on the physical plane, two like poles will always
 repel each other, while the negative and the positive are mutually
 attracted, so do Spirit and Matter stand to each other -- the
 two poles of the same homogeneous substance, the root-principle
 of the universe.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 248 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Therefore, when the hour strikes for Purusha to mount on Prakriti's
 shoulders for the formation of the Perfect Man -- rudimentary
 man of the first 2 1/2 Races being only the <em>first</em>,<em>
 </em>gradually evolving into <em>the most perfect of mammals </em>--<em>
 </em>the Celestial "Ancestors" (Entities from preceding
 worlds, called in India the Sishta) step in on this our plane,
 as the Pitris had stepped in before them for the formation of
 the physical or animal-man, and incarnate in the latter. Thus
 the two processes -- for the two <em>creations: </em>the animal
 and the divine man -- differ greatly. The Pitris shoot out from
 their ethereal bodies, still more ethereal and shadowy similitudes
 of themselves, or what we should now call "doubles,"
 or "astral forms," in their own likeness.* This furnishes
 the Monad with its first dwelling, and blind matter with a model
 around and upon which to build henceforth. But <em>Man is still
 incomplete. </em>From Swayambhuva Manu (in Manu, Book I.), from
 whom descended the seven primitive Manus or Prajapati, each of
 whom gave birth to a primitive race of men, down to the Codex
 Nazareus, in which Karabtanos or Fetahil (blind concupiscent matter)
 begets on his Mother, "Spiritus," seven figures, each
 of which stands as the progenitor of one of the primaeval seven
 races -- this doctrine has left its impress on every Archaic Scripture.
 </p><p>
 "Who forms Manu (the Man) and who forms his body? The <strong>L</strong>IFE
 and the <strong>L</strong>IVES. Sin** and the MOON." Here
 Manu stands for the spiritual, heavenly man, the real and non-dying
 <strong>E</strong>GO in us, which is the direct emanation of the
 "One Life" or the Absolute Deity. As to our outward
 physical bodies, the house of the tabernacle of the Soul, the
 Doctrine teaches a strange lesson; so strange that unless thoroughly
 explained and as rightly comprehended, it is only the exact Science
 of the future that is destined to vindicate the theory fully.
 </p><p>
 It has been stated before now that Occultism does not accept anything
 inorganic in the Kosmos. The expression employed by Science, "inorganic
 substance," means simply that the latent life slumbering
 in the molecules of so-called "inert matter" is incognizable.
 <strong>A</strong>LL IS <strong>L</strong>IFE, and every atom
 of even mineral dust is a <strong>L</strong>IFE, though beyond
 our comprehension and perception, because it is outside the range

 says Tyndall, "seem instinct with a desire for life."
 Whence, then, we would ask, comes the tendency "to run into
 organic form"? Is it in any way explicable except according
 to the teachings of Occult Science?

 * Is Pasteur unconsciously taking the first step toward Occult
 Science in declaring that, if he dared express his full idea upon
 this subject, he would say that the Organic cells are endowed
 with a vital potency that does not cease its activity with the
 cessation of a current of Oxygen towards them, and does not, on
 that account, break off its relations with life itself, which
 is supported by the influence of that gas? "I would add,"
 goes on Pasteur, "that the evolution of the germ is accomplished
 by means of complicated phenomena, among which we must class processes
 of fermentation"; and life, according to Claude Bernard and
 Pasteur, is nothing else than a process of fermentation. That
 there exist in Nature Beings or Lives that can live and thrive
 without air, even on our globe, was demonstrated by the same men
 of science. Pasteur found that many of the lower lives, such as
 Vibriones, and some microbes and bacteria, could exist without
 air, which, on the contrary, killed them. They derived the oxygen
 necessary for their multiplication from the various substances
 that surround them. He calls them <em>AErobes</em>,<em> </em>living
 on the tissues of our matter when the latter has ceased to form
 a part of an integral and living whole (then called very unscientifically
 by science "dead matter"), and <em>Anaerobes. </em>The
 one kind binds oxygen, and contributes vastly to the destruction
 of animal life and vegetable tissues, furnishing to the atmosphere
 materials which enter later on into the constitution of other
 organisms; the other destroys, or rather annihilates finally,
 the so-called organic substance; ultimate decay being impossible
 without their participation. Certain germ-cells, such as those
 of yeast, develop and multiply in air, but when deprived of it,
 they will adapt themselves to life without air and become ferments,
 absorbing oxygen from substances coming in contact with them,
 and thereby ruining the latter. The cells in fruit, when lacking
 free oxygen, act as ferments and stimulate fermentation. "Therefore
 the vegetable cell manifests in this case its life as an anaerobic
 being. Why, then, should an organic cell form in this case an
 exception"? asks Professor Bogolubof. Pasteur shows that
 in the substance of our tissues and organs, the cell, not finding
 sufficient oxygen for itself, stimulates fermentation in the same
 way as the fruit-cell, and Claude Bernard thought that Pasteur's
 idea of the formation of ferments found its application and corroboration
 in the fact that Urea increases in the blood during strangulation:
 <strong>L</strong>IFE therefore is everywhere in the Universe,
 and, Occultism teaches us, it is also in the atom. Also see <em>infra</em>,<em>

 This means that every new Round develops one of the Compound Elements,
 as now known to Science, -- which rejects the primitive nomenclature,
 preferring to subdivide them into constituents. If Nature is the
 "Ever-becoming" on the manifested plane, then those
 Elements are to be regarded in the same light: they have to evolve,
 progress, and increase to the Manvantaric end. Thus the First
 Round, we are taught, developed but one Element, and a nature
 and humanity in what may be called one aspect of Nature -- called
 by some, very unscientifically, though it may be so <em>de facto</em>,<em>
 </em>"One-dimensional Space."

 * It is a Vedic teaching that "there are three Earths corresponding
 to three Heavens, and our Earth (the fourth) is called Bhumi."
 This is the explanation given by our exoteric Western Orientalists.
 But the esoteric meaning and allusion to it in the Vedas is that
 it refers to our planetary chain, three "Earths" on
 the descending arc, and three "heavens" which are the
 three Earths or globes also, only far more ethereal, on the ascending
 or spiritual arc: by the first three we descend into matter, by
 the other three we ascend into Spirit; the lower one, <em>Bhumi</em>,
 our Earth, forming the turning point, so to say, and containing
 <em>potentially </em>as much of Spirit as it does of Matter. We
 shall treat of this hereafter.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 251 THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF SPACE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The Second Round brought forth and developed two Elements -- Fire
 and Earth -- and <em>its</em> humanity, adapted to this condition
 of Nature, if we can give the name Humanity to beings living under
 conditions unknown to men, was -- to use again a familiar phrase
 in a strictly figurative sense (the only way in which it can be
 used correctly) -- "a two-dimensional species." The
 processes of natural development which we are now considering
 will at once elucidate and discredit the fashion of speculating
 on the attributes of the <em>two</em>,<em> three</em>,<em> </em>and<em>
 four </em>or more "dimensional Space;" but in passing,
 it is worth while to point out the real significance of the sound
 but incomplete intuition that has prompted -- among Spiritualists
 and Theosophists, and several great men of Science, for the matter
 of that* -- the use of the modern expression, "the fourth
 dimension of Space." To begin with, of course, the superficial
 absurdity of assuming that Space itself is measurable in any direction
 is of little consequence. The familiar phrase can only be an abbreviation
 of the fuller form -- <em>the </em>"<em>Fourth dimension
 of </em>MATTER <em>in Space.</em>"**<em> </em>But it is an
 unhappy phrase even thus expanded, because while it is perfectly
 true that the progress of evolution may be destined to introduce
 us to new characteristics of matter, those with which we are already
 familiar are really more numerous than the three dimensions. The
 faculties, or what is perhaps the best available term, the characteristics
 of matter, must clearly bear a direct relation always to the senses
 of man. Matter has extension, colour, motion (molecular motion),
 taste, and smell, corresponding to the existing senses of man,
 and by the time that it fully develops the next characteristic
 -- let us call it for the moment <strong>P</strong>ERMEABILITY
 -- this will correspond to the next sense of man -- let us call
 it "<strong>N</strong>ORMAL <strong>C</strong>LAIRVOYANCE;"
 thus, when some bold thinkers have been thirsting for a fourth
 dimension to explain the passage of matter through matter, and
 the production of knots upon an endless cord, what they were really
 in want of, was a <em>sixth characteristic of matter. </em>The
 three dimensions belong really but to one attribute or characteristic
 of matter -- extension; and

 <p>
 popular common sense justly rebels against the idea that under
 any condition of things there can be more than three of such dimensions
 as length, breadth, and thickness. These terms, and the term "dimension"
 itself, all belong to one plane of thought, to one stage of evolution,
 to one characteristic of matter. So long as there are foot-rules
 within the resources of Kosmos, to apply to matter, so long will
 they be able to measure it three ways and no more; and from the
 time the idea of measurement first occupied a place in the human
 understanding, it has been possible to apply measurement in three
 directions and no more. But these considerations do not militate
 in any way against the certainty that in the progress of time
 -- as the faculties of humanity are multiplied -- so will the
 characteristics of matter be multiplied also. Meanwhile, the expression
 is far more incorrect than even the familiar one of the "Sun
 rising or setting."
 </p><p>
 We now return to the consideration of material evolution through
 the Rounds. Matter in the <em>second </em>Round, it has been stated,
 may be figuratively referred to as two-dimensional. But here another
 <em>caveat</em> must be entered. That loose and figurative expression
 may be regarded -- in one plane of thought, as we have just seen
 -- as equivalent to the second characteristic of matter corresponding
 to the second perceptive faculty or sense of man. But these two
 linked scales of evolution are concerned with the processes going
 on within the limits of a single Round. The succession of primary
 aspects of Nature with which the succession of Rounds is concerned,
 has to do, as already indicated, with the development of the "Elements"
 (in the Occult sense) -- Fire, Air, Water,* Earth. We are only
 in the fourth Round, and our catalogue so far stops short. The
 centres of consciousness (destined to develop into humanity as
 we know it) of the third Round arrived at a perception of the
 third Element Water.** Those of the fourth Round have added

 * The order in which these Elements are placed above is the correct
 one for esoteric purposes and in the Secret Teachings. Milton
 was right when he spoke of the "Powers of Fire, Air, Water,
 Earth"; the Earth, such as we know it now, had no existence
 before the 4th Round, hundreds of million years ago, the commencement
 of our geological Earth. The globe was "<em>fiery</em>,<em>
 cool and radiant </em>as its ethereal men and animals during the
 first Round," says the Commentary, uttering a contradiction
 or paradox in the opinion of our present Science; "<em>luminous
 </em>and more dense and heavy during the second Round; watery
 during the Third!" Thus are the elements reversed.

 none of the so-called elements were, in the three preceding Rounds,

 would say that there was no real water -- even during the Carboniferous
 period. We are told that gigantic masses of carbon, which existed
 formerly spread in the atmosphere as Carbonic Acid, were absorbed
 by plants, while a large proportion of that gas was mixed in the
 water. Now, if this be so, and we have to believe that all the
 Carbonic Acid which went to compose those plants that formed bituminous
 coal, lignite, etc., and went towards the formation of limestone,
 and so on, that all this was at that period in the atmosphere
 in gaseous form, then, there must have been seas and oceans of
 liquid carbonic acid? But how then could the carboniferous period
 be preceded by the Devonian and Silurian ages -- those of Fishes
 and Molluscs -- on that assumption? Barometric pressure, moreover,
 must have exceeded several hundred times the pressure of our present
 atmosphere. How could organisms, even so simple as those of certain
 fishes and molluscs, stand that? There is a curious work by Blanchard,
 on the Origin of Life, wherein he shows some strange contradictions
 and confusions in the theories of his colleagues, and which we
 recommend to the reader's attention.

 * Eliphas Levi shows it very truly "a force in Nature,"
 by means of which "a single man who can master it . . . might
 throw the world into confusion and transform its face"; for
 it is the "great Arcanum of transcendent Magic." Quoting
 the words of the great Western Kabalist in their translated form
 (see <em>The Mysteries of Magic</em>,<em> </em>by<em> </em>A.
 E. Waite), we may explain them perhaps the better by the occasional
 addition of a word or two to show the difference between Western
 and Eastern explanations of the same subject. The Author says
 of the great Magic Agent -- "This ambient and all-penetrating
 fluid, this ray detached from the (Central or 'Spiritual') Sun's
 splendour . . . fixed by the weight of the atmosphere (?!) and
 the power of central attraction . . . the Astral Light, this electromagnetic
 ether, this vital and luminous caloric, is represented on ancient
 monuments by the girdle of Isis which twines round two poles and
 in ancient theogonies by the serpent devouring its own tail, emblem
 of prudence and of Saturn" -- emblem of infinity, immortality,
 and Kronos -- "Time" -- not the god Saturn or the planet.
 "It is the winged dragon of Medea, the double serpent of
 the caduceus, and the tempter of Genesis; but it is also the brazen
 snake of Moses encircling the Tau lastly, it is the devil of exoteric
 dogmatism, and is really the blind force (it is not blind, and
 Levi knew it), which souls must conquer in order to detach themselves
 from the chains of Earth; 'for if they should not,' they will
 be absorbed by the same power which first produced them and will
 return to the central and eternal fire." This great <em>archaeus
 </em>is now discovered by, and only <em>for one man </em>-- Mr.
 J. W. Keeley, of [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>

 Nitrogen, "the breath of the Supporters of the Heavenly Dome,"
 as the Mohammedan mystics call it; WATER, that primordial fluid
 which was required, according to Moses, to make <em>a living soul
 </em>with. And this may account for the flagrant discrepancies
 and unscientific statements found in Genesis. Separate the first
 from the second chapter; read the former as a scripture of the
 Elohists, and the latter as that of the far younger Jehovists;
 still one finds, if one reads between the lines, the same order
 in which things created appear -- namely, Fire (light), Air, Water,
 and MAN (or the Earth). For the sentence: "In the beginning
 God created Heaven and Earth" is a mistranslation; it is
 not "Heaven and Earth," but the <em>duplex </em>or dual
 Heaven, the <em>upper </em>and the <em>lower </em>Heavens, or
 the separation of primordial substance that was light in its upper
 and dark in its lower portions -- or the manifested Universe --
 in its duality of the <em>invisible </em>(to the senses) and the
 <em>visible </em>to our perceptions. God divided the light from
 the Darkness (v. 4); and then made the firmament, air (5), "a
 firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters
 from the waters," (6), <em>i.e.</em>, "the waters which
 were under the firmament (our manifested visible Universe) from
 the waters <em>above </em>the firmament," or the (to us)
 invisible planes of being. In the second chapter (the Jehovistic),
 plants and herbs are created before water, just as in the first,
 <em>light is produced before the Sun. </em>"God made the
 Earth and the Heavens and every plant of the field <em>before
 it was in the Earth </em>and every herb of the field <em>before
 it grew; </em>for the Elohim ('gods') had not caused it to rain
 upon the earth, etc." (v. 5) -- an absurdity unless the esoteric
 explanation is accepted. The plants <i>were </i>created before
 they were in the earth -- <em>for there was no earth then such
 as it is now; </em>and the herb of the field was in existence
 before it grew as it does now in the fourth Round.
 </p><p>
 Discussing and explaining the nature of the invisible Elements
 and the "primordial fire" mentioned above, Eliphas Levi
 calls it invariably the "Astral Light." It is the "grand
 Agent Magique" with him; undeniably it is so, but -- only
 so far as <em>Black </em>Magic is concerned, and

 however, it is discovered, yet must remain almost useless. "So

 </p><p>
 All the above is as practical as it is correct, save one error,
 which we will explain in the text further on. Eliphas Levi commits
 a great blunder in always identifying the Astral Light with what
 we call Akasa. What it really is will be given in Part II. of
 Vol. II.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 255 BUT WHY SLANDER THE INDIAN HIEROPHANTS?
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 on the lowest planes of what we call Ether, the noumenon of which
 is Akasa; and even this would be held incorrect by orthodox Occultists.
 The "Astral Light" is simply the older "<em>sidereal
 </em>Light" of Paracelsus; and to say that "everything
 which exists has been evolved from it, and it preserves and reproduces
 all forms," as he writes, is to enunciate truth only in the
 second proposition. The first is erroneous; for if all that exists
 was evolved <em>through </em>(or<em> via</em>)<em> </em>it, it
 is not the astral light. The latter is not the container of <i>all
 </i>things but only the reflector, at best, of this <i>all.</i>
 Eliphas Levi writes: --
 </p><p>
 "The great Magic agent is the fourth emanation of the life
 principle (we say -- it is the first in the inner, and the second
 in the outer (our) Universe), of which the Sun is the third form
 . . . for the day-star (the sun) is only the reflection and material
 shadow of the Central Sun of truth, which illuminates the intellectual
 (invisible) world of Spirit and which itself is but a gleam borrowed
 from the <strong>A</strong>BSOLUTE."
 </p><p>
 So far he is right enough. But when the great authority of the
 Western Kabalists adds that nevertheless, "it is not the
 immortal Spirit as the Indian Hierophants have imagined"
 -- we answer that he slanders the said Hierophants, as they have
 said nothing of the kind; while even the Puranic exoteric writings
 flatly contradict the assertion. No Hindu has ever mistaken <em>Prakriti
 </em>-- the<em> </em>Astral Light being only above the lowest
 plane of Prakriti, the material Kosmos -- for the "immortal
 Spirit." Prakriti is ever called <em>Maya</em>,<em> </em>illusion,
 and is doomed to disappear with the rest, the gods included, at
 the hour of the Pralaya; for it is shown that Akasa is not even
 the Ether, least of all then, we imagine, can it be the Astral
 Light. Those unable to penetrate beyond the dead letter of the
 Puranas, have occasionally confused Akasa with Prakriti, with
 Ether, and even with the visible Sky! It is true also that those
 who have invariably translated the term Akasa by "Ether"
 (Wilson, for instance), finding it called "the material cause
 of sound" possessing, moreover, this <em>one single property
 </em>(Vishnu Purana), have ignorantly imagined it to be "material,"
 in the physical sense. True, again, that if the characteristics
 are accepted literally, then, since nothing material or physical,
 and therefore conditioned and temporary can be immortal -- according
 to metaphysics and philosophy -- it would follow that Akasa is
 neither infinite nor immortal. But all this is erroneous, since
 both the words <em>Pradhana</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 256 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 (primeval matter) and <em>sound</em>,<em> </em>as a property,
 have been misunderstood; the former term (Pradhana) being certainly
 synonymous with <em>Mulaprakriti </em>and Akasa, and the latter
 (sound) with the Verbum, the Word or the Logos. This is easy to
 demonstrate; for it is shown in the following sentences in Vishnu
 Purana: "In the beginning there was neither day nor night,
 nor sky, nor earth, nor darkness, nor light. . . . . Save only
 <strong>O</strong>NE, unapprehensible by intellect, or that which
 is Brahma and Pums (Spirit) and Pradhana (primordial matter)."
 . . . . (Book I., ch. ii.).
 </p><p>
 Now, what is Pradhana, if it is not Mulaprakriti, the root of
 all, in another aspect? For Pradhana, though said further on to
 merge into the Deity as everything else does, in order to leave
 the ONE absolute during the Pralaya, yet is held as infinite and
 immortal. The Commentator describes the Deity as: "One <em>Pradhanika
 </em>Brahma Spirit: THAT, was," and interprets the compound
 term as a substantive, not as a derivative word used attributively,
 <em>i.e.</em>, like something conjoined with Pradhana.* Hence
 Pradhana even in the Puranas is an aspect of Parabrahmam, not
 an evolution, and must be the same as the Vedantic Mulaprakriti.
 "Prakriti in its <em>primary </em>state is Akasa," says
 a Vedantin scholar (see "Five Years of Theosophy," p.
 169). It is almost abstract Nature.
 </p><p>
 Akasa, then, is Pradhana in another form, and as such cannot be
 Ether, the ever-invisible agent, courted even by physical Science.
 Nor is it Astral Light. It is, as said, the <em>noumenon </em>of
 the seven-fold differentiated Prakriti** -- the ever immaculate
 "Mother" of the <em>fatherless </em>Son,<em> </em>who
 becomes "Father" on the lower manifested plane. For
 MAHAT is the first product of Pradhana, or Akasa, and Mahat --
 Universal intelligence "whose <em>characteristic property
 </em>is Buddhi" -- is no other than the <em>Logos</em>,<em>
 </em>for he is called "Eswara" Brahma, Bhava, etc. (<em>See
 Linga Purana</em>,<em> </em>sec. lxx. 12<em> et seq.; </em>and
 Vayu Purana, but especially the former Purana -- prior, section
 viii., 67-74). He is, in short, the "Creator" or the
 divine mind in creative operation, "the cause of all things."
 He is

 * The student has to note, moreover, that the Purana is a dualistic
 system, not evolutionary, and that, in this respect, far more
 will be found, from an esoteric standpoint, in Sankhya, and even
 in the <em>Manava</em>-<em>dharma</em>-<em>Sastra</em>,<em> </em>however
 much the latter differs from the former.
 </p><p>
 ** In the Sankhya philosophy, the seven Prakritis or "productive
 productions" are <em>Mahat</em>,<em> Ahamkara</em>,<em> </em>and
 the <em>five</em> <em>tanmatras. </em>See<em> </em>"<em>Sankhya</em>-<em>karika</em>,"<em>
 </em>III., and the Commentary thereon.</p><hr>

 <p>
 the "first-born" of whom the Puranas tell us that "Mahat
 and matter are the inner and outer boundaries of the Universe,"
 or, in our language, the negative and the positive poles of dual
 nature (abstract and concrete), for the Purana adds: "In
 this manner -- as were the <em>seven </em>forms (principles) of
 Prakriti reckoned from Mahat to Earth -- so at the time of pralaya
 (pratyahara) these seven successively re-enter into each other.
 The egg of Brahma (Sarva-mandala) is dissolved with its seven
 zones (dwipa), seven oceans, seven regions, etc." (Vishnu
 Purana, Book vi., ch. iv.)*
 </p><p>
 These are the reasons why the Occultists refuse to give the name
 of Astral Light to Akasa, or to call it Ether. "In my Father's
 house are many mansions," may be contrasted with the occult
 saying, "In our Mother's house there are seven mansions,"
 or planes, the lowest of which is above and around us -- the Astral
 Light.
 </p><p>
 The elements, whether simple or compound, could not have remained
 the same since the commencement of the evolution of our chain.
 Everything in the Universe progresses steadily in the Great Cycle,
 while incessantly going up and down in the smaller cycles. Nature
 is never stationary during manvantara, as it is ever <em>becoming</em>,**
 not simply <em>being; </em>and mineral, vegetable, and human life
 are always adapting their organisms to the then reigning Elements,
 and therefore <em>those </em>Elements were then fitted for them,
 as they are now for the life of present humanity. It will only
 be in the next, or fifth, Round that the fifth Element, <em>Ether
 </em>--<em> </em>the gross body of Akasa, if it can be called
 even that --

 * No use to say so to the Hindus, who know their Puranas by heart,
 but very useful to remind our Orientalists and those Westerns
 who regard Wilson's translations as authoritative, that in his
 English translation of the Vishnu Purana he is guilty of the most
 ludicrous contradictions and errors. So on this identical subject
 of the seven Prakritis or the seven zones of Brahma's egg, the
 two accounts differ totally. In Vol. 1, page 40, the egg is said
 to be externally invested by seven envelopes -- Wilson comments:
 "by Water, Air, Fire, Ether, and Ahamkara" (which last
 word does not exist in the Sanskrit texts); and in vol. v., p.
 198, of the same Vishnu Purana it is written, "in this manner
 were the seven forms of nature (Prakriti) reckoned from Mahat
 to Earth" (?). Between Mahat or Maha-Buddhi and "Water,
 etc.," the difference is very considerable.
 </p><p>
 ** According to the great metaphysician Hegel also. For him Nature
 was a <em>perpetual becoming. </em>A purely esoteric conception.
 Creation or Origin, in the Christian sense of the term, is absolutely
 unthinkable. As the above-quoted thinker said: "God (the
 Universal Spirit) <em>objectivises himself as Nature</em>,<em>
 </em>and again rises out of it."</p><hr>

 will, by becoming a familiar fact of Nature to all men, as air
 is familiar to us now, cease to be as at present hypothetical,
 and also an "agent" for so many things. And only during
 that Round will those higher senses, the growth and development
 of which Akasa subserves, be susceptible of a complete expansion.
 As already indicated, a <em>partial </em>familiarity with the
 characteristic of matter -- permeability -- which should be developed
 concurrently with the sixth sense, may be expected to develop
 at the proper period in this Round. But with the next element
 added to our resources in the next Round, <em>permeability </em>will<em>
 </em>become so manifest a characteristic of matter, that the densest
 forms of this will seem to man's perceptions as obstructive to
 him as a thick fog, and no more.
 </p><p>
 Let us return to the life-cycle now. Without entering at length
 upon the description given of the <em>higher </em>LIVES, we must
 direct our attention at present simply to the earthly beings and
 the earth itself. The latter, we are told, is built up for the
 first Round by the "Devourers" which disintegrate and
 differentiate the germs of other lives in the Elements; pretty
 much, it must be supposed, as in the present stage of the world,
 the <em>aerobes </em>do, when, undermining and loosening the chemical
 structure in an organism, they transform animal matter and generate
 substances that vary in their constitutions. Thus Occultism disposes
 of the so-called Azoic age of Science, for it shows that there
 never was a time when the Earth was without life upon it. Wherever
 there is an atom of matter, a particle or a molecule, even in
 its most gaseous condition, there is life in it, however latent
 and unconscious. "<em>Whatsoever quits the Laya State</em>,<em>
 becomes active life; it is drawn into the vortex of </em><strong>MOTION</strong><em>
 </em>(<em>the alchemical solvent of Life</em>)<em>; Spirit and
 Matter are the two States of the </em><strong>ONE</strong>,<em>
 which is neither Spirit nor Matter</em>,<em> both being the absolute
 life</em>,<em> latent.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Book of Dzyan</em>,<em>
 Comm. III.</em>,<em> par. </em><strong>18</strong>). . . <em>.
 </em>"<em>Spirit is the first differentiation of </em>(<em>and
 in</em>)<em> </em><strong>SPACE</strong><em>; and Matter the first
 differentiation of Spirit. That, which is neither Spirit nor matter

 Causeless </em><strong>CAUSE</strong><em> of Spirit and Matter</em>,<em>
 which are the Cause of Kosmos. And </em><strong>THAT</strong><em>
 we call the </em><strong>ONE LIFE</strong><em> or the Intra</em>-<em>Cosmic
 Breath.</em>"
 </p><p>
 Once more we will say -- <em>like must produce like</em>. Absolute
 Life cannot produce an inorganic atom whether single or complex,
 and there is life</p><hr>

 <p>
 even in <em>laya </em>just as a man in a profound cataleptic state
 -- to all appearance a corpse -- is still a living being.
 </p><p>
 When the "Devourers" (in whom the men of science are
 invited to see, with some show of reason, atoms of the Fire-Mist,
 if they will, as the Occultist will offer no objection to this);
 when the "Devourers," we say, have differentiated "the
 fire-atoms" by a peculiar process of segmentation, the latter
 become life-germs, which aggregate according to the laws of cohesion
 and affinity. Then the life-germs produce lives of another kind,
 which work on the structure of our globes. * * * *
 </p><p>
 Thus, in the first Round, the globe, having been built by the
 primitive fire-lives, <em>i.e.</em>, formed into a sphere -- had
 no solidity, nor qualifications, save a cold brightness, nor form
 nor colour; it is only towards the end of the First Round that
 it developed one Element which from its inorganic, so to say,
 or simple Essence became now in our Round the fire we know throughout
 the system. The Earth was in her first rupa, the essence of which
 is the Akasic principle named *** "that which is now known
 as, and very erroneously termed, Astral Light, which Eliphas Levi
 calls "the imagination of Nature,"|| probably to avoid
 giving it its correct name, as others do.
 </p><p>
 "<em>It is through and from the radiations of the seven bodies
 of the seven orders of Dhyanis</em>,<em> that the seven discrete
 quantities </em>(<em>Elements</em>),<em> whose motion and harmonious
 Union produce the manifested Universe of Matter</em>,<em> are
 born.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Commentary.</em>)
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 || Speaking of it in his Preface to the "History of Magic"
 Eliphas Levi says: "It is through this Force that all the
 nervous centres secretly communicate with each other; from it
 -- that sympathy and antipathy are born; from it -- that we have
 our dreams; and that the phenomena of second sight and extra-natural
 visions take place. . . . . Astral Light, acting under the impulsion
 of powerful wills, destroys, coagulates, separates, breaks, gathers
 in all things. . . . God created it on that day when he said:
 <em>Fiat Lux</em>,<em> </em>and it is directed by the <em>Egregores</em>,<em>
 i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the chiefs of the souls who are the spirits
 of energy and action." Eliphas Levi ought to have added that
 the astral light, or primordial substance, if matter at all, is
 that which, called <em>Light</em>,<em> </em><strong>L</strong>UX,
 esoterically explained, <em>is the body of those Spirits themselves</em>,<em>
 and their very essence. Our physical light is the manifestation
 on our plane </em>and the reflected radiance of the <em>Divine
 </em>Light emanating from the collective body of those who are
 called the "<strong>L</strong>IGHTS" and the "<strong>F</strong>LAMES."
 But no other Kabalist has ever had the talent of heaping up one
 contradiction on the other, of making one paradox chase another
 in the same sentence and in such flowing language, as Eliphas
 Levi. He leads his reader through the most lovely, gorgeously
 blooming valleys, to strand him after all on a desert and barren
 rocky island.</p><hr>

 <p>
 The Second Round brings into manifestation the second element
 <strong>A</strong>IR, that element, the purity of which would
 ensure continuous life to him who would use it. There have been
 two occultists only in Europe who have discovered and even partially
 applied it in practice, though its composition has always been
 known among the highest Eastern Initiates. The ozone of the modern
 chemists is poison compared with the real universal solvent which
 could never be thought of unless it existed in nature. "<em>From
 the second Round</em>,<em> Earth -</em>- <em>hitherto a foetus
 in the matrix of Space </em>--<em> began its real existence: it
 had developed individual sentient life</em>,<em> its second principle.
 The second corresponds to the sixth </em>(<em>principle</em>)<em>;
 the second is life continuous</em>,<em> the other</em>,<em> temporary.</em>"
 </p><p>
 The<em> Third </em>Round developed the <em>third </em>Principle
 -- <strong>W</strong>ATER; while the Fourth transformed the gaseous
 fluids and plastic form of our globe into the hard, crusted, grossly
 material sphere we are living on. "Bhumi" has reached
 her <em>fourth </em>principle. To this it may be objected that
 the law of analogy, so much insisted upon, is broken. Not at all.
 Earth will reach her true ultimate form -- (inversely in this
 to man) -- her body shell -- only toward the end of the manvantara
 after the Seventh Round. Eugenius Philalethes was right when he
 assured his readers <em>on his word of honour </em>that no one
 had yet seen <em>the Earth </em>(<em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em><strong>M</strong>ATTER
 in its essential form). Our globe is, so far, in its <em>Kamarupic
 </em>state<em> </em>--<em> </em>the astral body of desires of
 <em>Ahamkara</em>,<em> </em>dark Egotism, the progeny of Mahat,
 on the lower plane. . . .
 </p><p>
 It is not molecularly constituted matter -- least of all the human
 body (<em>sthulasarira</em>)<em> </em>--<em> </em>that is the
 grossest of all our "principles," but verily the <em>middle</em>
 principle, the real animal centre; whereas our body is but its
 shell, the irresponsible factor and medium through which the beast
 in us acts all its life. Every intellectual theosophist will understand
 my real meaning. Thus the idea that the human tabernacle is built
 by countless <em>lives</em>, just in the same way as the rocky
 crust of our Earth was, has nothing repulsive in it for the true
 mystic. Nor can Science oppose the occult teaching, for it is
 not because the microscope will ever fail to detect the ultimate
 living atom or life, that it can reject the doctrine.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) Science teaches us that the living as well as the
 dead organism of both man and animal are swarming with bacteria
 of a hundred various</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 261 THE OCCULT CHEMISTRY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 kinds; that from without we are threatened with the invasion of
 microbes with every breath we draw, and from within by leucomaines,
 aerobes, anaerobes, and what not. But Science never yet went so
 far as to assert with the occult doctrine that our bodies, as
 well as those of animals, plants, and stones, are themselves altogether
 built up of such beings; which, except larger species, no microscope
 can detect. So far, as regards the purely animal and material
 portion of man, Science is on its way to discoveries that will
 go far towards corroborating this theory. Chemistry and physiology
 are the two great magicians of the future, who are destined to
 open the eyes of mankind to the great physical truths. With every
 day, the identity between the animal and physical man, between
 the plant and man, and even between the reptile and its nest,
 the rock, and man -- is more and more clearly shown. The physical
 and chemical constituents of all being found to be identical,
 chemical science may well say that there is no difference between
 the matter which composes the ox and that which forms man. But
 the Occult doctrine is far more explicit. It says: --- Not only
 the chemical compounds are the same, but the same infinitesimal
 <em>invisible lives </em>compose the atoms of the bodies of the
 mountain and the daisy, of man and the ant, of the elephant, and
 of the tree which shelters him from the sun. Each particle --
 whether you call it organic or inorganic -- <em>is a life. </em>Every
 atom and molecule in the Universe is both <em>life</em>-<em>giving
 </em>and<em> death-giving </em>to that form, inasmuch as it builds
 by aggregation universes and the ephemeral vehicles ready to receive
 the transmigrating soul, and as eternally destroys and changes
 the <em>forms </em>and expels those souls from their temporary
 abodes. It creates and kills; it is self-generating and self-destroying;
 it brings into being, and annihilates, that mystery of mysteries
 -- the <em>living body </em>of man, animal, or plant, every second
 in time and space; and it generates equally life and death, beauty
 and ugliness, good and bad, and even the agreeable and disagreeable,
 the beneficent and maleficent sensations. It is that mysterious
 <strong>L</strong>IFE, represented collectively by countless myriads
 of lives, that follows in its own sporadic way, the hitherto incomprehensible
 law of Atavism; that copies family resemblances as well as those
 it finds impressed in the aura of the generators of every future
 human being, a mystery, in short, that will receive fuller attention
 elsewhere. For the present, one instance may be cited in illustration.
 Modern science begins to find out that ptomaine (the alkaloid
 poison generated by decaying matter and corpses -- a<em> life
 </em>also) extracted </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 262 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 with the help of volatile ether, yields a smell as strong and
 equal to that of the freshest orange-blossoms; but that free from
 oxygen, these alkaloids yield either a most sickening, disgusting
 smell, or the most agreeable aroma which recalls that of the most
 delicately scented flowers. And it is suspected that such blossoms
 owe their agreeable smell to the poisonous ptomaine; the venomous
 essence of certain mushrooms (fungi) being nearly identical with
 the venom of the cobra of India, the most deadly of serpents.*
 Thus, having discovered the effects, Science has to find their
 PRIMARY CAUSES; and this it can never do without the help of the
 old sciences, of alchemy, occult botany and physics. We are taught
 that every physiological change, in addition to pathological phenomena;
 diseases -- nay, life itself -- or rather the objective phenomena
 of life, produced by certain conditions and changes in the tissues
 of the body which allow and force life to act in that body; that
 all this is due to those unseen CREATORS and DESTROYERS that are
 called in such a loose and general way, microbes.** Such
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 *The French savants Arnaud, Gautier, and Villiers, have found
 in the saliva of living men the same venomous alkaloid as in that
 of the toad, the salamander, the cobra, and the trigonocephalus
 of Portugal. It is proven that venom of the deadliest kind, whether
 called ptomaine, or leucomaine, or alkaloid, is generated by living
 men, animals, and plants. The same savant, Gautier, discovered
 an alkaloid in the fresh meat of an ox and in its brains, and
 a venom which he calls Xanthocreatinine similar to the substance
 extracted from the poisonous saliva of reptiles. It is the muscular
 tissues, as being the most active organ in the animal economy,
 that are suspected of being the generators or factors of venoms,
 having the same importance as carbonic acid and urea in the functions
 of life, which venoms are the ultimate products of inner combustion.
 And though it is not yet fully determined whether poisons can
 be generated by the animal system of living beings without the
 participation and interference of microbes, it is ascertained
 that the animal does produce venomous substances in its physiological
 or living state.
 </p><p>
 ** It might be supposed that these "fiery lives" and
 the microbes of science are identical. This is not true. The "fiery
 lives" are the seventh and highest subdivision of the plane
 of matter, and correspond in the individual with the One Life
 of the Universe, though only on that plane. The microbes of science
 are the first and lowest sub-division on the second plane -- that
 of material <em>prana</em> (or life). The physical body of man
 undergoes a complete change of structure every seven years, and
 its destruction and preservation are due to the alternate function
 of the fiery lives as "destroyers" and "builders."
 They are "builders" by sacrificing themselves in the
 form of vitality to restrain the destructive influence of the
 microbes, and, by supplying the microbes with what is necessary,
 they compel them under that restraint to build up the material
 body and its cells. They are "destroyers" also when
 that restraint is [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 263 PARACELSUS DIED TOO EARLY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 experimenters as Pasteur are the best friends and helpers of the
 Destroyers and the worst enemies of the Creators -- if the latter
 were not at the same time destroyers too. However it may be, one
 thing is sure in this: The knowledge of these primary causes and
 of the ultimate essence of every element, of its lives, their
 functions, properties, and conditions of change -- constitutes
 the basis of MAGIC. Paracelsus was, perhaps, the only Occultist
 in Europe, during the last centuries since the Christian era,
 who was versed in this mystery. Had not a criminal hand put an
 end to his life, years before the time allotted him by Nature,
 physiological Magic would have fewer secrets for the civilized
 world than it now has.
 </p><p>
 (<em>d</em>) But what has the Moon to do in all this? we may be
 asked. What have "Fish, Sin and Moon" in the apocalyptic
 saying of the Stanza to do in company with the "Life-microbes"?
 With the latter nothing, except availing themselves of the tabernacle
 of clay prepared by them; with divine perfect man everything,
 since "Fish, Sin and Moon" make conjointly the three
 symbols of the immortal Being.
 </p><p>
 This is all that can be given. Nor does the writer pretend to
 know more of this strange symbol than may be inferred about it
 from exoteric religions; from the mystery perhaps, which underlies
 the <em>Matsya</em> (fish)
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] removed and the microbes,
 unsupplied with vital constructive energy, are left to run riot
 as destructive <em>agents</em>. Thus, during the first half of
 a man's life (the first <em>five</em> periods of seven years each)
 the "fiery lives" are indirectly engaged in the process
 of building up man's material body; life is on the ascending scale,
 and the force is used in construction and increase. After this
 period is passed the age of retrogression commences, and, the
 work of the "fiery lives" exhausting their strength,
 the work of destruction and decrease also commences.
 </p><p>
 An analogy between cosmic events in the descent of spirit into
 matter for the first half of a manvantara (planetary as human)
 and its ascent at the expense of matter in the second half, may
 here be traced. These considerations have to do solely with the
 plane of matter, but the restraining influence of the "fiery
 lives" on the lowest sub-division of the second plane --
 the microbes -- is confirmed by the fact mentioned in the foot-note
 on Pasteur (<em>vide supra</em>)<em> </em>that the cells of the
 organs, when they do not find sufficient oxygen for themselves,
 adapt themselves to that condition and form <em>ferments</em>,
 which, by absorbing oxygen from substances coming in contact with
 them, ruin the latter. Thus the process is commenced by one cell
 robbing its neighbour of the source of its vitality when the supply
 is insufficient; and the ruin so commenced steadily progresses.

 recorded in the imperishable sign of the Zodiac, <em>Pisces</em>,<em>
 </em>and running throughout the two Testaments in the personages
 of Joshua "Son of the Fish (Nun)" and Jesus; the allegorical
 "Sin" or Fall of Spirit into matter, and the Moon --
 in so far as it relates to the "Lunar" ancestors, the
 Pitris.
 </p><p>
 For the present it may be as well to remind the reader that while
 the Moon-goddesses were connected in every mythology, especially
 the Grecian, with child-birth, because of the lunar influence
 on women and conception, the occult and actual connection of our
 satellite with fecundation is to this day unknown to physiology,
 which regards every popular practice in this reference as gross
 superstition. As it is useless to discuss them in detail, we may
 only stop at present to discuss the lunar symbology casually,
 to show that the said superstition belongs to the most ancient
 beliefs, and even to Judaism -- the basis of Christianity. With
 the Israelites, the chief function of Jehovah was child-giving,
 and the esotericism of the Bible, interpreted Kabalistically,
 shows undeniably the Holy of Holies in the temple to be only the
 symbol of the womb. This is now proven beyond doubt and cavil,
 by the <em>numerical </em>reading of the Bible in general, and
 of Genesis especially. This idea must certainly have been borrowed
 by the Jews from the Egyptians and Indians, whose Holy of Holies
 was, and with the latter is to this day, symbolised by the King's
 chamber in the Great Pyramid (see "<em>Source of Measures</em>")<em>
 </em>and the Yoni symbols of exoteric Hinduism. To make the whole
 clearer and to show at the same time the enormous difference in
 the spirit of interpretation and the original meaning of the same
 symbols between the ancient Eastern Occultists and the Jewish
 Kabalists we refer the reader to Book II., "The Holy of Holies."*

 STRONG AND RADIANT WITH EVERY CHANGE (<em>re</em>-<em>incarnation</em>)<em>

 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) This sentence: "The thread between the <em>silent
 watcher </em>and his <em>shadow </em>(man) becomes stronger"
 -- with every re-incarnation -- is another psychological mystery,
 that will find its explanation in Book II. For the present it
 will suffice to say that the "Watcher" and his "Shadows"
 -- the latter numbering as many as there are re-incarnations for
 the monad -- are one. The Watcher, or the divine prototype, is
 at the upper rung of the ladder of being; the shadow, at the lower.
 Withal, the <em>Monad </em>of every living being, unless his moral
 turpitude breaks the connection and runs loose and "astray
 into the lunar path" -- to use the Occult expression -- <em>is
 an individual Dhyan Chohan</em>,<em> distinct from others</em>,<em>
 a kind of spiritual individuality of its own</em>,<em> </em>during
 one special Manvantara. Its <em>Primary</em>,<em> </em>the Spirit
 (Atman) is one, of course, with <em>Paramatma </em>(the one Universal
 Spirit), but the vehicle (Vahan) it is enshrined in, the <em>Buddhi</em>,<em>
 </em>is part and parcel of that Dhyan-Chohanic Essence; and it
 is in this that lies the mystery of that <em>ubiquity</em>,<em>
 </em>which was discussed a few pages back. "My Father, that
 is in Heaven, and I -- are one," -- says the Christian Scripture;
 in this, at any rate, it is the faithful echo of the esoteric
 tenet.

 Humanities, like all things, will be one and the same. Everything
 will have re-entered the <em>Great Breath. </em>In other words,
 everything will be "merged in Brahma" or the divine
 unity.
 </p><p>
 Is this annihilation, as some think? Or <em>Atheism</em>,<em>
 </em>as other critics -- the worshippers of a <em>personal </em>deity
 and believers in an unphilosophical paradise -- are inclined to
 suppose? Neither. It is worse than useless to return to the question
 of implied atheism in that which is <em>spirituality </em>of a
 most refined character. To see in Nirvana annihilation amounts
 to saying of a man plunged in a sound <em>dreamless </em>sleep<em>
 </em>--<em> one that leaves no impression on the physical memory
 and brain</em>,<em> because the sleeper</em>'<em>s Higher Self
 is in its original state of absolute consciousness </em>during
 those hours -- that he, too, is annihilated. The latter simile
 answers only to one side of the question -- the most material;
 since<em> re</em>-<em>absorption </em>is by no means such a "dreamless
 sleep," but, on the contrary, <em>absolute </em>existence,
 an unconditioned unity, or a state, to describe which human language
 is absolutely and hopelessly inadequate. The only approach to
 anything like a comprehensive conception of it can be attempted
 solely in the panoramic visions of the soul, through spiritual
 ideations of the divine monad. Nor is the individuality -- <em>nor
 even the essence of the personality</em>,<em> </em>if any be left
 behind -- lost, because re-absorbed. For, however limitless --
 from a human standpoint -- the paranirvanic state, it has yet
 a limit in Eternity. Once reached, the same monad will <em>re</em>-<em>emerge
 </em>therefrom, as a still higher being, on a far higher plane,
 to recommence its cycle of perfected activity. The human mind
 cannot in its present stage of development transcend, scarcely
 reach this plane of thought. It totters here, on the brink of
 incomprehensible Absoluteness and Eternity.
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>The "Watchers" reign over man
 during the whole period of <em>Satya Yuga </em>and the smaller
 subsequent yugas, down to the beginning of the Third Root Race;
 after which it is the Patriarchs, Heroes, and the Manes (<em>see
 Egyptian Dynasties enumerated by the priests to Solon</em>),<em>
 </em>the incarnated Dhyanis of a lower order, up to King Menes
 and the human kings of other nations; all were recorded carefully.
 In the views of symbologists this <em>Mythopoeic Age </em>is of
 course only regarded as a fairy tale. But since traditions and
 even Chronicles of such dynasties of <em>divine </em>Kings --
 of gods reigning over men followed by dynasties of Heroes or Giants
 -- exist in the annals of every nation, it is difficult to understand
 how all the peoples under the sun, some of whom are separated
 by vast</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 267 EARTH, PEOPLED FROM HEAVEN.</h6>
 
 <p>
 oceans and belong to different hemispheres, such as the ancient
 Peruvians and Mexicans, as well as the Chaldeans, could have worked
 out the same "fairy tales" in the same order of events.*
 However, as the Secret Doctrine teaches <em>history </em>--<em>
 </em>which, for being esoteric and traditional, is none the less
 more reliable than profane history -- we are as entitled to our
 beliefs as anyone else, whether religionist or sceptic. And that
 Doctrine says that the Dhyani-Buddhas of the two higher groups,
 namely, the "Watchers" or the "Architects,"
 furnished the many and various races with divine kings and leaders.
 It is the latter who taught humanity their arts and sciences,
 and the former who revealed to the incarnated Monads that had
 just shaken off their vehicles of the lower Kingdoms -- and who
 had, therefore, lost every recollection of their divine origin
 -- the great spiritual truths of the transcendental worlds. (See
 Book II., "Divine Dynasties.")
 </p><p>
 Thus, as expressed in the Stanza, the Watchers descended on Earth
 and reigned over men -- "<em>who are themselves.</em>"<em>
 </em>The reigning kings had finished their cycle on Earth and
 other worlds, in the preceding Rounds. In the future manvantaras
 they will have risen to higher systems than our planetary world;
 and it is the Elect of our Humanity, the Pioneers on the hard
 and difficult path of Progress, who will take the places of their
 predecessors. The next great Manvantara will witness the men of
 our own life-cycle becoming the instructors and guides of a mankind
 whose Monads may now yet be imprisoned -- semi-conscious -- in
 the most intellectual of the animal kingdom, while their lower
 principles will be animating, perhaps, the highest specimens of
 the Vegetable world.
 </p><p>
 Thus proceed the cycles of the septenary evolution, in Septennial
 nature; the Spiritual or divine; the psychic or semi-divine; the
 intellectual, the passional, the instinctual, or <em>cognitional;
 </em>the semi-corporeal and the purely material or physical natures.
 All these evolve and progress cyclically, passing from one into
 another, in a double, centrifugal and centripetal way, <em>one
 </em>in their ultimate essence, <em>seven </em>in their aspects.
 The lowest, of course, is the one depending upon and subservient
 to

 through his cycle, when he has identified himself with collective
 Humanity. This, <em>he has made in his own image. </em>In order
 to progress upwards and homewards, the "God" has now
 to ascend the weary uphill path of the Golgotha of Life. It is
 the martyrdom of self-conscious existence. Like Visvakarman he
 has to sacrifice <em>himself to himself </em>in order to redeem
 all creatures, to resurrect from the many into the <em>One Life.
 </em>Then he ascends into heaven indeed; where, plunged into the
 incomprehensible absolute Being and Bliss of Paranirvana, he reigns
