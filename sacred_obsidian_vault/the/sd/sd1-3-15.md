 GODS, MONADS, AND ATOMS.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>S</strong>OME years ago we remarked* that "the Esoteric
 Doctrine may well be called the 'thread-doctrine,' since, like
 <em>Sutratman</em>,<em> </em>in the Vedanta philosophy,** it passes
 through and strings together all the ancient philosophical religious
 systems, and reconciles and explains them all." We say now
 it does more. It not only reconciles the various and apparently
 conflicting systems, but it checks the discoveries of modern exact
 science, and shows some of them to be necessarily correct, since
 they are found corroborated in the ancient records. All this will,
 no doubt, be regarded as terribly impertinent and disrespectful,
 a veritable crime of <em>lese</em>-<em>Science; </em>nevertheless,
 it is a fact.
 </p><p>
 Science is, undeniably, ultra-materialistic in our days; but it
 finds, in one sense, its justification. Nature behaving <em>in
 actu </em>ever esoterically, and being, as the Kabalists say,
 <em>in abscondito</em>,<em> </em>can only be judged by the profane
 through her appearance, and that appearance is always deceitful
 on the physical plane. On the other hand, the naturalists refuse
 to blend physics with metaphysics, the body with its informing
 soul and spirit, which they prefer ignoring. This is a matter
 of choice with some, while the minority strive very sensibly to
 enlarge the domain of physical science by trespassing on the forbidden
 grounds of metaphysics, so distasteful to some materialists. These
 scientists are wise in their generation. For all their wonderful
 discoveries would go for nothing, and remain for ever <em>headless
 </em>bodies, unless they lift the veil of matter and strain their
 eyes to see <em>beyond. </em>Now that they have studied nature
 in the length, breadth, and thickness of her physical frame, it
 is time to remove the skeleton to the second plane and search
 within the unknown depths for the living and real entity, for
 its SUB-<em>stance </em>--<em> </em>the noumenon of evanescent
 matter.

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 611 WHICH OF THE TWO IS BLIND?</h6>
 
 <p>
 It is only by acting on such lines that some of the truths, now
 called "exploded superstitions," will be discovered
 to be facts and the relics of ancient knowledge and wisdom.
 </p><p>
 One of such "degrading" beliefs -- in the opinion of
 the all-denying sceptic -- is found in the idea that Kosmos, besides
 its objective planetary inhabitants, its humanities in other inhabited
 worlds, is full of invisible, intelligent <em>Existences. </em>The
 so-called Arch-Angels, Angels and Spirits, of the West, copies
 of their prototypes, the Dhyan-Chohans, the Devas and Pitris,
 of the East, are no real Beings but fictions. On this point Materialistic
 Science is inexorable. To support its position, it upsets its
 own axiomatic law of uniformity in the laws of nature, that of
 continuity, and all the logical sequence of analogies in the evolution
 of being. The masses of the profane are asked, and made, to believe
 that the accumulated testimony of History, which shows even the
 Atheists of old -- such as Epicurus and Democritus -- believing
 in <em>gods</em>,<em> </em>was false; and that philosophers like
 Socrates and Plato, asserting their existence, were mistaken enthusiasts
 and fools. If we hold our opinions merely on historical grounds,
 on the authority of legions of the most eminent Sages, Neo-Platonists,
 Mystics of all the ages, from Pythagoras down to the eminent Scientists
 and Professors of the present century, who, if they reject "gods,"
 believe in "spirits," shall we consider such authorities
 as weak-minded and foolish as any Roman Catholic peasant, who
 believes in and prays to his once human Saint, or the Archangel,
 St. Michael? But is there no difference between the belief of
 the peasant and that of the Western heirs to the Rosicrucians
 and Alchemists of the Middle Ages? Is it the Van Helmonts, the
 Khunraths, the Paracelsuses and Agrippas, from Roger Bacon down
 to St. Germain, who were all blind enthusiasts, hysteriacs or
 cheats, or is it the handful of modern sceptics -- the "leaders
 of thought" -- who are struck with the cecity of negation?
 The latter, we opine. It would be a <em>miracle </em>indeed, quite
 an abnormal fact in the realm of probabilities and logic, were
 that handful of negators to be the sole custodians of <em>truth</em>,<em>
 </em>while the million-strong hosts of believers in gods, angels,
 and spirits -- in Europe and America alone -- namely, Greek and
 Latin Christians, Theosophists, Spiritualists, Mystics, etc.,
 etc., should be no better than deluded fanatics and hallucinated
 mediums, and often no higher than the victims of deceivers and
 impostors! However varying in their external presentations and
 dogmas, beliefs in the Hosts of invisible Intelligences of various
 grades have all the same foundation. Truth and error are mixed
 in all. The exact extent, depth, breadth, and length of the mysteries
 of Nature are to be found only in Eastern esoteric sciences. So
 vast and so profound are these that hardly a few, a very few of
 the highest Initiates -- those <em>whose very existence is known
 but to a small number of</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 612 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>Adepts </em>-- are capable of assimilating the knowledge.
 Yet it is all there, and one by one facts and processes in Nature's
 workshops are permitted to find their way into the exact Sciences,
 while mysterious help is given to rare individuals in unravelling
 its arcana. It is at the close of great Cycles, in connection
 with racial development, that such events generally take place.
 We are at the very close of the cycle of 5,000 years of the present
 Aryan Kaliyuga; and between this time and 1897 there will be a
 large rent made in the Veil of Nature, and materialistic science
 will receive a death-blow.
 </p><p>
 Without throwing any discredit upon time-honoured beliefs, in
 whatever direction, we are forced to draw a marked line between
 blind faith, evolved by theologies, and knowledge due to the independent
 researches of long generations of adepts; between, in short, faith
 and philosophy. There have been -- in all ages -- undeniably learned
 and good men who, having been reared in sectarian beliefs, died
 in their crystallized convictions. For Protestants, the garden
 of Eden is the primeval point of departure in the drama of Humanity,
 and the solemn tragedy on the summit of Calvary, the prelude to
 the hoped-for Millennium. For Roman Catholics, Satan is at the
 foundation of Kosmos, Christ in its centre, and Antichrist at
 its apex. For both, the Hierarchy of Being begins and ends within
 the narrow frames of their respective theologies: one self-created
 <em>personal </em>God and an Empyrean ringing with the Hallelujas
 of <em>created </em>angels; the rest, <em>false </em>gods, Satan
 and fiends.
 </p><p>
 Theophilosophy proceeds on broader lines. From the very beginning
 of AEons -- in time and space in our Round and Globe -- the Mysteries
 of Nature (at any rate, those which it is lawful for our races
 to know) were recorded by the pupils of those same now invisible
 "heavenly men," in geometrical figures and symbols.
 The keys thereto passed from one generation of "wise men"
 to the other. Some of the symbols, thus passed from the east to
 the west, were brought therefrom by Pythagoras, who was not the
 inventor of his famous "Triangle." The latter figure,
 along with the plane cube and circle, are more eloquent and scientific
 descriptions of the order of the evolution of the Universe, spiritual
 and psychic, as well as physical, than volumes of descriptive
 Cosmogonies and revealed "<em>Geneses</em>." The <em>ten
 points </em>inscribed within that "Pythagorean <em>triangle</em>"<em>
 </em>are worth all the theogonies and angelologies ever emanated
 from the theological brain. For he who interprets them -- on their
 very face, and in the order given -- will find in these seventeen
 points (the seven Mathematical Points hidden) the uninterrupted
 series of the genealogies from the first <em>Heavenly</em> to
 <em>terrestrial </em>man. And, as they give the order of Beings,
 so they reveal the order in which were evolved the Kosmos, our
 earth, and the primordial elements by</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 613 THE MATHEMATICAL POINT.</h6>
 
 <p>
 which the latter was generated. Begotten in the invisible <em>Depths</em>,<em>
 </em>and in the womb of the same "Mother" as its fellow-globes
 -- he who will master the mysteries of our Earth, will have mastered
 those of all others.
 </p><p>
 Whatever ignorance, pride or fanaticism may suggest to the contrary,
 Esoteric Cosmology can be shown inseparably connected with both
 philosophy and modern science. The gods of the ancients, the monads
 -- from Pythagoras down to Leibnitz -- and the atoms of the present
 materialistic schools (as borrowed by them from the theories of
 the old Greek Atomists) are only a compound unit, or a graduated
 unity like the human frame, which begins with body and ends with
 spirit. In the occult sciences they can be studied separately,
 but never mastered unless viewed in their mutual correlations
 during their life-cycle, and as a Universal Unity during <em>Pralayas.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 La Pluche shows sincerity, but gives a poor idea of his philosophical
 capacities when declaring his personal views on the Monad or the
 Mathematical Point. "A point," he says, "is enough
 to put all the schools in the world in a combustion. But what
 need has man to know that point, since the creation of such a
 small being is beyond his power? <em>A fortiori</em>,<em> </em>philosophy
 acts against probability when, from that point which absorbs and
 disconcerts all her meditations, she presumes to pass on to the
 generation of the world. . . ."
 </p><p>
 Philosophy, however, could never have formed its conception of
 a logical, universal, and absolute Deity if it had no Mathematical
 Point within the Circle to base its speculations upon. It is only
 the manifested Point, lost to our senses after its pregenetic
 appearance in the infinitude and <em>incognizability </em>of the
 Circle, that made a reconciliation between philosophy and theology
 possible -- on condition that the latter should abandon its crude
 materialistic dogmas. And it is because it has so unwisely rejected
 the Pythagorean Monad and geometrical figures, that Christian
 theology has evolved its self-created human and personal God,
 the monstrous Head from whence flow in two streams the dogmas
 of Salvation and Damnation. This is so true that even those clergymen
 who would be philosophers and who were masons, have, in their
 arbitrary interpretations, fathered upon the ancient sages the
 queer idea that "the Monad represented (with them) <em>the
 throne </em>of the Omnipotent Deity, placed in the centre of the
 Empyrean to indicate <b>T.G.A.O.T.U</b>."* -- read "the
 Great Architect of the Universe." A curious explanation this,
 more Masonic than strictly Pythagorean.

 <p>
 ever mean "the exemplification of the unity of the divine
 Essence"; for this was exemplified by the plane of the boundless
 Circle. What it really meant was the triune co-equal Nature of
 the first differentiated Substance, or the <em>con</em>-<em>substantiality
 </em>of the (manifested) Spirit, matter and the Universe -- their
 "Son," who proceeds from the Point (the real, esoteric
 <strong>L</strong>OGOS) or the Pythagorean <strong>M</strong>ONAD.
 For the Greek <em>Monas </em>signifies "Unity" in its
 primary sense. Those unable to seize the difference between the
 monad -- the Universal Unit -- and the <em>Monads </em>or<em>
 </em>the manifested Unity, as also between the ever-hidden and
 the revealed <strong>L</strong>OGOS or the <em>Word</em>,<em>
 </em>ought never to meddle in philosophy, let alone the Esoteric
 Sciences. It is needless to remind the educated reader of Kant's
 <em>Thesis </em>to demonstrate his second <em>Antinomy.</em>*<em>
 </em>Those who have read and understood it will see clearly the
 line we draw between the <em>absolutely Ideal</em> Universe and
 the invisible though manifested Kosmos. Our Gods and Monads are
 not the Elements of <em>extension </em>itself, but only those
 of the invisible reality which is the basis of the manifested
 Kosmos. Neither esoteric philosophy, nor Kant, nor Leibnitz would
 ever admit that extension can be composed of simple or unextended
 parts. But theologian-philosophers will not grasp this. The Circle
 and the Point, which latter retires into and merges with the former,
 after having emanated the first three points and connected them
 with lines, thus forming the first <em>noumenal </em>basis of
 the Second Triangle in the Manifested World, have ever been an
 insuperable obstacle to theological flights into dogmatic Empyreans.
 On the authority of this Archaic Symbol, a male, personal god,
 the <em>Creator</em> and <em>Father </em>of all, becomes a third-rate
 emanation, the Sephiroth standing <em>fourth </em>in descent,
 and on the left hand of En-Soph (see the <em>Kabalistic Tree of
 Life</em>)<em>. </em>Hence, the Monad is degraded into a Vehicle
 -- a "throne"!
 </p><p>
 The Monad -- only the emanation and reflection of the Point (Logos)
 in the phenomenal World -- becomes, as the <em>apex </em>of the
 manifested equilateral triangle, the "Father." The left
 side or line is the <em>Duad</em>,<em> </em>the "Mother,"
 regarded as the evil, counteracting principle (Plutarch, <em>De</em>
 <em>Placitis Placitorum</em>);<em> </em>the right side represents
 the Son ("his Mother's husband" in every Cosmogony,
 as one with the <em>apex</em>);<em> </em>at the basic line is
 the Universal plane of productive Nature, unifying on the phenomenal
 plane Father-Mother-Son, as these were unified in the <em>apex</em>,<em>
 </em>in the supersensuous World.** By mystic transmutation they
 became the Quaternary -- the triangle became the <strong>T</strong>ETRAKTIS.

 ** In the Greek and Latin churches -- which regard marriage as
 one of the sacraments -- the officiating priest during the marriage
 ceremony represents the apex of the <em>triangle; </em>the bride
 its left feminine side and the bridegroom the right one, while
 the horizontal line is symbolised by the row of witness, the bridesmaids
 and best-men. But behind [[Footnote continued on next page]] 
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 615 SPACE, FORCE AND MATTER.</h6>
 
 <p>
 This transcendental application of geometry to Cosmic and divine
 theogony -- the Alpha and the Omega of mystical conception --
 became dwarfed after Pythagoras by Aristotle. By omitting the
 Point and the Circle, and taking no account of the apex, he reduced
 the metaphysical value of the idea, and thus limited the doctrine
 of magnitude to a simple TRIAD -- the <em>line</em>,<em> </em>the<em>
 surface</em>,<em> </em>and the <em>body. </em>His modern heirs,
 who play at Idealism, have interpreted these three geometrical
 figures as Space, Force, and Matter -- "the potencies of
 an interacting Unity."* Materialistic Science, perceiving
 but the basic line of the <em>manifested </em>"triangle"
 -- the plane of matter -- translates it practically as (Father)-<strong>M</strong>ATTER,
 (Mother)-<strong>M</strong>ATTER, and (Son)-<strong>M</strong>ATTER,
 and theoretically as Matter, Force, and Correlation.
 </p><p>
 But to the average physicist, as remarked by a Kabalist, "Space,
 Force, Matter, are, what signs in algebra are to the mathematician,
 merely conventional symbols;" or "Force as force, and
 Matter as matter, are as absolutely unknowable as is the assumed
 empty space in which they are held to interact." As symbols
 representing abstractions, "the physicist bases reasoned
 hypotheses of the origin of things . . . . and sees three needs
 in what he terms creation: (<em>a</em>) a place wherein to create;
 (<em>b</em>) a medium by which to create; (<em>c</em>) a material
 from which to create. And in giving a logical expression to this
 hypothesis through the terms space, force, matter, he believes
 he has proved the existence of that which each of these represents
 <em>as he conceives it to be</em>."**
 </p><p>
 The physicist who regards Space merely as a representation of
 our mind, or extension unrelated to things in it, which Locke
 defined as capable of neither resistance nor motion; the paradoxical
 materialist, who would have a <em>void </em>there, where he can
 see no matter, would reject with the utmost contempt the proposition
 that "Space is a substantial though (apparently) an absolutely
 unknowable living Entity." (<em>New Aspects</em>,<em> </em>p.
 9.) Such is, nevertheless, the Kabalistic teaching, and it is
 that of Archaic philosophy. Space is the real world, while our
 world is an artificial one. It is the One Unity throughout its
 infinitude: in its bottomless depths as on its illusive surface;
 a surface studded with countless phenomenal Universes, systems
 and mirage-like worlds. Nevertheless, to the Eastern Occultist,
 who is an objective Idealist at the bottom, in the <em>real</em>
 world, which is a Unity of Forces, there is "a connection
 of all matter in the <em>plenum</em>,"<em> </em>as Leibnitz
 would say. This is symbolized in the Pythagorean Triangle.

 It consists of <em>ten points </em>inscribed pyramid-like (from
 one to the last four) within its three lines, and it symbolizes
 the Universe in the famous Pythagorean Decad. The upper single
 dot is a Monad, and represents a Unit-Point, which is <em>the</em>
 Unity from whence all proceeds, and all is of the same essence
 with it. While the ten dots within the triangle represent the
 phenomenal world, the three sides of the equilateral triangle
 which enclose the pyramid of dots are the barriers of <em>noumenal
 </em>Matter, or Substance, that separate it from the world of
 Thought. "Pythagoras considered a <em>point </em>to correspond
 in proportion to unity; a <em>line </em>to 2; a <em>superficies</em>
 to 3; a <em>solid </em>to 4; and he defined a point as a Monad
 having position, and the beginning of all things; a line was thought
 to correspond with duality, because it was produced by the first
 motion from indivisible nature, and formed the junction of two
 points. A superficies was compared to the number three because
 it is the first of all causes that are found in figures; for a
 circle, which is the principal of all round figures, comprises
 a triad, in centre -- space -- circumference. But a triangle,
 which is the first of all rectilineal figures, is included in
 a ternary, and receives its form according to that number; and
 was considered by the Pythagoreans to be the creator of all sublunary
 things. The four points at the base of the Pythagorean triangle
 correspond with a solid or cube, which combines the principles
 of length, breadth, and thickness, for no solid can have less
 than four extreme boundary points." (<em>Pythag. Triangle</em>,<em>
 </em>p. 19.)
 </p><p>
 It is argued that "the human mind cannot conceive an indivisible
 unit short of the annihilation of the idea with its subject."
 This is an error, as the Pythagoreans have proved, and a number
 of Seers before them, although there is a special training for
 it, and although the profane mind can hardly grasp it. But there
 are such things as <em>metamathematics</em> and <em>metageometry.
 </em>Even mathematics pure and simple proceed from the Universal
 to the particular, from the mathematical, hence <em>indivisible
 </em>Point, to solid figures. The teaching originated in India,
 and was taught in Europe by Pythagoras, who, throwing a veil over
 the Circle and the Point -- which no living man can define except
 as incomprehensible abstractions -- laid the origin of the differentiated
 Cosmic matter in the basic or horizontal line of the Triangle.
 Thus the latter became the earliest of geometrical figures. The
 author of "New Aspects of Life" and of the Kabalistic
 Mysteries -- objects to the objectivization, so to speak, of the
 Pythagorean conception and use of the equilateral triangle, and
 calls it a <em>misnomer. </em>His argument that a solid equilateral
 body -- "one whose base, and each of its sides, form equal
 triangles -- must have four co-equal sides or surfaces, while
 a triangular plane will as necessarily possess five," demonstrates
 on the contrary the grandeur of the conception in all its esoteric
 application to the idea of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 617 PHANTOMS OF THE MIND.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the <em>pregenesis</em>,<em> </em>and the genesis of Kosmos. Granted,
 that an ideal triangle, depicted by mathematical, imaginary lines
 "can have no sides at all, being simply <em>a phantom of
 the mind </em>(if sides be imputed to which, they must be the
 sides of the object it constructively represents)." But in
 such case most of the scientific hypotheses are no better than
 "phantoms of the mind"; they are unverifiable, except
 on inference, and have been adopted merely to answer scientific
 necessities. Furthermore, the ideal triangle -- "as the abstract
 idea of a triangular body, and, therefore, as the type of an abstract
 idea" -- accomplished and carried out to perfection the double
 symbolism intended. As an emblem applicable to the objective idea,
 the simple triangle became a solid. When repeated in stone on
 the four cardinal points, it assumed the shape of the Pyramid
 -- the symbol of the phenomenal merging into the noumenal Universe
 of thought -- at the apex of the four triangles; and, as an "imaginary
 figure constructed of three mathematical lines," it symbolized
 the subjective spheres -- those lines "enclosing a mathematical
 space -- which is equal to nothing enclosing nothing." Because,
 to the senses and the untrained consciousness of profane and scientist,
 everything beyond the line of differentiated matter -- <em>i.e.</em>,
 outside of, and beyond the realm of even the most spiritual <em>substance</em>
 -- has<em> </em>to<em> </em>remain for ever <em>equal to nothing.
 </em>It is the <strong>A</strong>IN-<strong>S</strong>OPH -- the
 <em>No</em>-THING.
 </p><p>
 Yet these "phantoms of the mind" are in truth no greater
 abstractions than the abstract ideas in general upon evolution
 and physical development -- <em>e.g</em>., Gravity, Matter, Force,
 etc. -- on which the exact sciences are based. Our most eminent
 chemists and physicists are earnestly pursuing the not hopeless
 attempt of finally tracing to its hiding-place the <em>protyle</em>,<em>
 </em>or the basic line of the Pythagorean triangle. The latter
 is, as said, the grandest conception imaginable, as it symbolizes
 both the ideal and the visible universes.* For if "<em>the
 possible unit is only a possibility as an actuality of nature</em>,<em>
 as an individual of any kind</em>,"<em> </em>and as every
 individual natural object is capable of division, and by division
 loses its unity, <em>or ceases to be a unit</em>,**<em> </em>it
 is so only in the realm of exact sciences in a world as deceptive
 as it is illusive. In the realm of the Esoteric sciences the unit
 divided <em>ad infinitum</em>,<em> </em>instead of losing its
 unity, approaches with every division the planes of the only eternal
 <strong>R</strong>EALITY. The eye of the <strong>S</strong>EER
 can follow and behold it in all its pregenetic glory. This same
 idea of the reality of the subjective, and the unreality of the
 objective universes, is found at the bottom of the Pythagorean
 and Platonic teachings -- limited to the <em>Elect </em>alone;

 Porphyry, speaking of the <em>Monad </em>and the <em>Duad</em>,<em>
 </em>says that the former only was considered substantial and
 real, "<em>that most simple Being</em>,<em> the cause of
 all unity and the measure of all things.</em>"
 </p><p>
 But the Duad, although the origin of Evil, or Matter -- thence
 <em>unreal </em>in philosophy -- is still Substance during Manvantara,
 and is often called the<em> third </em>monad, in Occultism, and
 the connecting line as between two Points, . . . or Numbers which
 proceeded from THAT, "which was before all Numbers,"
 as expressed by Rabbi Barahiel. And from this Duad proceeded all
 the <em>Scintillas </em>of the three upper and the four lower
 worlds or planes -- which are in constant interaction and correspondence.
 This is a teaching which the Kabala has in common with Eastern
 Occultism. For in the occult philosophy there are the "<strong>O</strong>NE
 Cause" and the "<em>Primal </em>Cause," which latter
 thus becomes, paradoxically, the second, as clearly expressed
 by the author of the "<em>Qabbalah</em>,<em> from the philosophical
 writings of Ibn Gabirol</em>,"<em> </em>--<em> </em>"in
 the treatment of the Primal cause, two things must be considered,
 the Primal Cause <em>per se</em>,<em> </em>and the relation and
 connection of the Primal Cause with the visible and unseen universe."
 Thus he shows the early Hebrews following in the steps of the
 Oriental philosophy -- Chaldean, Persian, Hindu, Arabic, etc.
 Their Primal Cause was designated at first "by the triadic
 Shaddai, the (triune) Almighty, subsequently by the Tetragrammaton,
 <b>YHVH</b>, symbol of the Past, Present, and Future," and,
 let us add, of the eternal <strong>I</strong>S, or the <strong>I</strong>
 <strong>A</strong>M. Moreover, in the Kabala the name <b>YHVH</b>
 (or Jehovah) expresses a He and a She, male and female, two in
 one, or Hokhmah and Binah, and his, or rather their <em>Shekinah
 </em>or synthesizing spirit (grace), which makes again of the
 Duad a Triad. This is demonstrated in the Jewish Liturgy for Pentecost,
 and the prayer, "In the name of Unity, of the Holy and Blessed
 Hu (He), and His Shekinah, the Hidden and Concealed Hu, blessed
 be <b>YHVH </b>(the Quaternary) for ever." "Ha is said
 to be masculine and <b>YAH</b> feminine, together they make the
 <img src="sd1-618.gif" align="MIDDLE"> <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>one
 <b>YHVH</b>. One, but of a male-female nature. The Shekinah is
 always considered in the Qabbalah as feminine" (p. 175).
 And so it is considered in the <em>exoteric </em>Puranas, for
 Shekinah is no more than <em>Sakti </em>--<em> </em>the female
 double or lining of any god, in such case. And so it was with
 the early Christians whose Holy Spirit was feminine, as Sophia
 was with the Gnostics. But in the transcendental Chaldean Kabala
 or "Book of Numbers," "Shekinah" is sexless,
 and the purest abstraction, a State, like Nirvana, not subject
 or object or anything except an absolute <strong>P</strong>RESENCE.
 </p><p>
 Thus it is only in the anthropomorphised systems (such as the
 Kabala has now greatly become) that Shekinah-Sakti is feminine.
 As such she becomes the <em>Duad </em>of Pythagoras, the two straight
 lines of the symbol that can never meet, which therefore form
 no geometrical figure and are</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 619 THE MONAD OF LEIBNITZ.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the symbol of matter. Out of this Duad, when united in one basic
 line of the triangle on the lower plane (the upper Triangle of
 the Sephirothal Tree), emerge the Elohim, or Deity in <em>Cosmic
 </em>Nature, with the true Kabalists the <em>lowest </em>designation,
 translated in the Bible "God" (see the same work and
 page).* Out of these issue the <em>Scintillas.</em> 
 </p><p>
 The<em> Scintillas </em>are the "Souls," and these Souls
 appear in the three-fold form of Monads (units), atoms and gods
 -- according to our teaching. "Every atom becomes a visible
 complex unit (a molecule), and once attracted into the sphere
 of terrestrial activity, the Monadic Essence, passing through
 the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, becomes man."
 (Esot. Catechism.) Again, "God, Monad, and Atom are the correspondences
 of Spirit, Mind, and Body (<em>Atma</em>,<em> Manas and Sthula
 Sarira</em>)<em> </em>in man." In their septenary aggregation
 they are the "Heavenly Man" (see <em>Kabala </em>for
 the latter term); thus, terrestrial man is the provisional reflection
 of the Heavenly. . . . . "The Monads (<em>Jivas</em>)<em>
 </em>are the Souls of the Atoms, both are the fabric in which
 the Chohans (Dhyanis, <em>gods</em>)<em> </em>cloth themselves
 when a form is needed." (<em>Esot. Cat.</em>)
 </p><p>
 This relates to Cosmic and sub-planetary Monads, not to the Super-Cosmic
 <em>Monas </em>(the Pythagorean Monad) as called, in its synthetic
 character, by the Pantheistical Peripatetics. The Monads of the
 present dissertation are treated from the standpoint of their
 individuality, as<em> atomic Souls</em>,<em> </em>before these
 atoms descend into pure terrestrial form. For this descent into
 <em>concrete </em>matter marks the medial point of their own individual
 pilgrimage. Here, losing in the mineral kingdom their individuality,
 they begin to ascend through the seven states of terrestrial evolution
 to that point where a correspondence is firmly established between
 the human and <em>Deva</em> (divine) consciousness. At present,
 however, we are not concerned with their terrestrial metamorphoses
 and tribulations, but with their life and behaviour in Space,
 on planes wherein the eye of the most intuitional chemist and
 physicist cannot reach them -- unless, indeed, he develops in
 himself highly clairvoyant faculties.

 truth, but defined monadic evolution incorrectly, which is not
 to be wondered at, since he was not an <strong>I</strong>NITIATE,

 very intuitional philosopher. Yet no psycho-physicist ever came
 nearer than he has to the esoteric general outline of evolution.
 This evolution -- viewed from its several standpoints -- <em>i.e.</em>,
 as the <em>universal </em>and the <em>individualized </em>Monad;
 and the chief aspects of the Evolving Energy, after differentiation
 -- the purely Spiritual, the Intellectual, the Psychic and the
 Physical -- may be thus formulated as an invariable law; a descent
 of Spirit into Matter, equivalent to an ascent in physical evolution;
 a re-ascent from the depths of materiality towards its <em>status
 quo ante</em>,<em> </em>with a corresponding dissipation of concrete
 form and substance up to the <strong>L</strong>AYA state, or what
 Science calls "the zero-point," and beyond.
 </p><p>
 These states -- once the spirit of Esoteric philosophy is grasped
 -- become absolutely necessary from simple logical and analogical
 considerations. Physical Science having now ascertained, through
 its department of Chemistry, the invariable law of this evolution
 of atoms -- from their<em> </em>"<em>protylean</em>"<em>
 </em>state down to that of a physical and then a chemical particle
 (or molecule) -- cannot well reject the same as a general law.
 And once it is forced by its enemies -- Metaphysics and Psychology*
 -- out of its alleged impregnable strongholds, it will find it
 more difficult than it now appears to refuse room <em>in the Spaces
 </em>of <strong>S</strong>PACE to Planetary Spirits (gods), Elementals,
 and even the <em>Elementary </em>Spooks or Ghosts, and others.
 Already Figuier and Paul D'Assier, two Positivists and Materialists,
 have succumbed before this logical necessity. Other and still
 greater Scientists will follow in that "intellectual <strong>F</strong>ALL."
 They will be driven out of their position not by spiritual, theosophical,
 or any other physical or even mental phenomena, but simply by
 the enormous <em>gaps </em>and<em> chasms </em>that open daily
 and will still be opening before them, as one discovery follows
 the other, until they are finally knocked off their feet by the
 ninth wave of simple common sense.

 Here is an example: Prof. W. Crookes' latest discovery of what
 he has named <em>protyle. </em>In the "Notes on the Bhagavat

 in India,** the lecturer, referring cautiously to "things
 occult" in that great Indian esoteric work, makes a remark

 examining the lecture delivered by Professor Crookes a short time
 ago upon the so-called elements of modern chemistry. This lecture
 will give you some idea of the way in which these Elements spring
 from <em>Vishwanara</em>,*<em> </em>the most objective of these
 three principles, which seems to stand in the place of the <em>protyle
 </em>mentioned in that lecture. <em>Except in a few particulars</em>,<em>
 </em>this lecture seems to give the outlines of the theory of
 physical evolution on the plane of <em>Vishwanara</em>,<em> </em>and
 is, so far as I know, <em>the nearest approach made by modern
 investigators </em>TO THE REAL OCCULT THEORY <em>on the subject.</em>"
 </p><p>
 These words will be re-echoed and approved by every Eastern Occultist.
 Much from the lectures by Prof. Crookes has already been quoted
 in ยง <b>XII.</b> of these Addenda. Since then, there has
 been another lecture delivered, as remarkable as the first one,
 on the "Genesis of the Elements,"** and also a third
 one. Here we have almost a corroboration of the teachings of Esoteric
 philosophy concerning the mode of primeval evolution. It is, indeed,
 as <em>near an approach</em>,<em> </em>made by a great scholar
 and specialist in chemistry,*** to the Secret Doctrine, as could
 be made apart from the application of the monads and atoms to
 the dogmas of pure transcendental metaphysics, and their connection
 and correlation with "Gods and intelligent Conscious Monads."
 But Chemistry is now on its ascending plane, thanks to one of
 its highest European representatives. It is impossible for it
 to go back to that day when materialism regarded its <em>sub</em>-elements
 as absolutely simple and homogeneous bodies, which it had raised,
 in its blindness, to the rank of elements. The mask has been snatched
 off by too clever a hand for there to be any fear of a new disguise.
 And after years of pseudology, of bastard molecules parading under
 the name of elements, behind and beyond which there could be nought
 but void, a great professor of chemistry asks once more: "What
 are these elements, whence do they come, what is their signification?
 . . . . These elements perplex us in our researches, baffle us
 in our speculations, and haunt us in our very dreams. They stretch
 like an unknown sea before us mocking -- mystifying, and murmuring
 strange revelations and possibilities." (<em>Gen. of Elem.</em>,<em>
 </em>p. 1.)

 objective world, but the one physical basis (the horizontal line

 Substance. Beyond only, is the true <em>Protyle.</em>

 when his discovery of radiant matter will have resulted in a further

 of this truth.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 622 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Those who are heirs to primeval revelations have taught these
 "possibilities" in every century, but have never found
 a fair hearing. The truths inspired to Kepler, Leibnitz, Gassendi,
 Swedenborg, etc., were ever alloyed with their own speculations
 in one or another predetermined direction --hence distorted. But
 now one of the great truths has dawned upon an eminent professor
 of modern exact science, and he fearlessly proclaims as a fundamental
 axiom that Science has not made itself acquainted, so far, with
 <em>real</em> simple elements. For Prof. Crookes tells his audience:
 </p><p>
 "If I venture to say <em>that our commonly received elements
 are</em> NOT <em>simple and primordial</em>,<em> </em>that they
 have <em>not </em>arisen by chance or have <em>not </em>been created
 in a desultory and mechanical manner, but have been evolved from
 simpler matters -- or perhaps, indeed, from one sole kind of matter
 -- I do but give formal utterance to an idea which has been, so
 to speak, for some time 'in the air' of science. Chemists, physicists,
 philosophers of the highest merit, declare explicitly their belief
 that the seventy (or thereabouts) elements of our text-books are
 not the pillars of Hercules which we must never hope to pass."
 . . . "Philosophers in the present as in the past -- men
 who certainly have not worked in the laboratory -- have reached
 the same view from another side." Thus Mr. Herbert Spencer
 records his conviction that 'the chemical atoms are produced from
 the true or physical atoms by processes of evolution under conditions
 which chemistry has not yet been able to produce.' . . . "And
 the poet has forestalled the philosopher. Milton ('Paradise Lost,'
 Book V.) makes the Archangel Raphael say to Adam, instinct with
 the evolutionary idea, that the Almighty had created
 </p><blockquote>
 . . . 'One first matter, all<br>
 Indued with various forms, various degrees<br>
 Of substance.' "
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Nevertheless, the idea would have remained crystallized "in
 the air of Science," and never have descended into the thick
 atmosphere of materialism and profane mortals for years to come,
 perhaps, had not Professor Crookes bravely and fearlessly reduced
 it to its simple elements, and thus publicly forced it on Scientific
 notice. "An idea," says Plutarch, "is a <em>being
 </em>incorporeal, which has no subsistence by itself, but gives
 figure and form unto shapeless matter, and <em>becomes the cause
 of the manifestation.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>De Placit. Philos.</em>)<em>
 </em>The revolution produced in old chemistry by Avogadro was
 the first page in the Volume of <em>New Chemistry. </em>Mr. Crookes
 has now turned the second page, and is boldly pointing <em>to
 what may be the last. </em>For once <em>protyle </em>accepted
 and recognized -- <em>as invisible Ether was</em>,<em> both being
 logical and scientific necessities </em>--<em> </em>Chemistry
 will have virtually ceased to live: it will reappear in its reincarnation
 as <em>New Alchemy</em>,<em> </em>or <strong>M</strong>ETACHEMISTRY.
 The discoverer of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 623 THE GENESIS OF ATOMS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 radiant matter will have vindicated in time the Archaic Aryan
 works on Occultism and even the Vedas and Puranas. For what are
 the manifested "Mother," the "Father-Son-Husband"
 (Aditi and Daksha, a form of Brahma, as Creators) and the "Son,"
 -- the three "First-born" -- <em>but simply Hydrogen</em>,<em>
 Oxygen</em>,<em> </em>and that which in its terrestrial manifestation
 is called <em>nitrogen. </em>Even the exoteric descriptions of
 the "First Born" triad give all the characteristics
 of these three <em>gases. </em>Priestley, the "discoverer"
 of Oxygen, or that which was known in the highest antiquity!
 </p><p>
 Yet all the ancient, mediaeval, and modern poets and philosophers
 have been anticipated even in the exoteric Hindu books. Descartes'
 <em>plenum </em>of matter differentiated into particles; Leibnitz's
 <em>Ethereal Fluid </em>and Kant's "primitive fluid"
 dissolved into its elements; Kepler's Solar Vortex and Systemic
 Vortices; in short, from the Elemental Vortices inaugurated by
 the universal mind -- through Anaxagoras, down to Galileo, Torricelli,
 and Swedenborg, and after them to the latest speculations by European
 mystics -- all this is found in the Hindu hymns and Mantras to
 the "Gods, Monads, and Atoms," in their fulness, for
 they are inseparable. In esoteric teachings, the most transcendental
 conceptions of the universe and its mysteries, as the most (seemingly)
 materialistic speculations are found reconciled, because those
 sciences embrace the whole scope of evolution from Spirit to matter.
 As declared by an American Theosophist, "The Monads (of Leibnitz)
 may from one point of view be called <em>force</em>,<em> </em>from
 another <em>matter. </em>To occult Science, <em>force </em>and
 <em>matter </em>are <em>only two sides of the same </em>SUBSTANCE."
 ("Path," No. 10, p. 297.)
 </p><p>
 Let the reader remember these "Monads" of Leibnitz,
 every one of which is a living mirror of the universe, every monad
 reflecting every other, and compare this view and definition with
 certain Sanskrit stanzas (<em>Slokas</em>)<em> </em>translated
 by Sir William Jones, in which it is said that the creative source
 of the Divine Mind, . . . "Hidden in a veil of thick darkness,
 formed <em>mirrors of the atoms </em>of the world, and <em>cast
 reflection from its own face on every atom. . </em>. . ."
 </p><p>
 When, therefore, Professor Crookes declares that "If we can
 show how the so-called chemical elements might have been generated
 we shall be able to fill up a formidable gap in our knowledge
 of the universe, . . ." the answer is ready. The theoretical
 knowledge is contained in the esoteric meaning of every Hindu
 cosmogony in the <em>Puranas;</em> the<em> </em>practical demonstration
 thereof -- is in the hands of those who will not be recognised
 <em>in this </em>century, save by the very few. The scientific
 possibilities of various discoveries, that must inexorably lead
 exact Science into the acceptation of Eastern Occult views, which
 contain all the requisite material for the filling of those "gaps,"
 are, so far, at the mercy of modern materialism. It is only by
 working in the direction</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 624 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 taken by Professor Crookes that there is any hope for the recognition
 of a few, hitherto Occult, truths.
 </p><p>
 Meanwhile, one thirsting to have a glimpse at a practical diagram
 of the evolution of primordial matter, which, separating and differentiating
 under the impulse of cyclic law, divides itself into a septenary
 gradation of <strong>S</strong>UBSTANCE (from a general view),
 can do no better than examine the plates attached to Mr. Crookes'
 lecture: "Genesis of the Elements," and ponder well
 over some passages of the text. In one place (p. 11) he says:
 --
 </p><p>
 ". . . . Our notions of a chemical element have expanded.
 Hitherto the molecule has been regarded as an aggregate of two
 or more atoms, and no account has been taken of the architectural
 design on which these atoms have been joined. We may consider
 that the structure of a chemical element is more complicated than
 has hitherto been supposed. Between the molecules we are accustomed
 to deal with in chemical reactions and ultimate atoms as first
 created, come smaller molecules or aggregates of physical atoms;
 then sub-molecules differ one from the other, according to the
 position they occupied in the yttrium edifice."
 </p><p>
 "Perhaps this hypothesis can be simplified if we imagine
 yttrium to be represented by a five-shilling piece. By chemical
 fractionation I have divided it into five separate shillings,
 and find that these shillings are not counterparts, but like the
 carbon atoms in the benzol ring, have the impress of their position,
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, stamped on them. . . . If I throw my shillings
 into the melting-pot or dissolve them chemically, the mint stamp
 disappears and they all turn out to be silver." . . .
 </p><p>
 This will be the case with all the atoms and molecules when they
 have separated from their compound forms and bodies -- when <em>pralaya
 </em>sets in. Reverse the case, and imagine the dawn of a new
 manvantara. The pure "silver" of the absorbed material
 will once more separate into SUBSTANCE, which will generate "Divine
 Essences" whose "principles"* are the primary elements,
 the sub-elements, the physical energies and subjective and objective
 matter; or, as these are epitomised -- GODS, MONADS, and ATOMS.
 If leaving for one moment the metaphysical or transcendental side
 of the question, -- dropping out of the present consideration
 the supersensuous and intelligent beings and entities believed
 in by the Kabalists and Christians -- we turn to the atomical
 theory of evolution, the occult teachings are still found corroborated
 by exact Science and its confessions, as far, at least, as regards
 the supposed "simple" elements, now suddenly

 <p>
 degraded into poor and distant relatives -- not even second cousins
 to the latter. For we are told by Prof. Crookes that:
 </p><p>
 "Hitherto, it has been considered that if the atomic weight
 of a metal, determined by different observers, setting out from
 different compounds, was always found to be constant . . . then
 such metal must rightly take rank among the simple or elementary
 bodies. We learn . . . that this is no longer the case. Again,
 we have here wheels within wheels. Gadolinium is not an element
 but a compound. . . We have shown that yttrium is a complex of
 five or more new constituents. And who shall venture to gainsay
 that each of these constituents, if attacked in some different
 manner, and if the result were submitted to a test more delicate
 and searching than the radiant-matter test, might not be still
 further divisible? Where, then, is the actual ultimate element?
 As we advance it recedes like the tantalizing mirage lakes and
 groves seen by the tired and thirsty traveller in the desert.
 Are we in our quest for truth to be thus deluded and baulked?
 The very idea of an element, as something absolutely primary and
 ultimate, seems to be growing less and less distinct. . ."
 (p. 16).
 </p><p>
 On page 429 of <em>Isis Unveiled</em>,<em> </em>Vol. I., we said
 that "the mystery of first creation, which was ever the despair
 of Science, is unfathomable unless they (the Scientists) accept
 the doctrine of Hermes. <em>They will have to follow in the footsteps
 of the Hermetists.</em>"<em> </em>Our prophecy begins to
 assert itself.
 </p><p>
 But between Hermes and Huxley there is a middle course and point.
 Let the men of Science only throw a bridge half-way, and think
 seriously over the theories of Leibnitz. We have shown <em>our</em>
 theories with regard to atomic evolution -- their last formation
 into compound chemical molecules being produced within our terrestrial
 workshops in the earth's atmosphere and not elsewhere -- as strangely
 agreeing with the evolution of atoms shown on Mr. Crookes' plates.
 Several times already it was stated in this volume that <em>Marttanda
 </em>(the Sun) had evolved and aggregated, together with his smaller
 seven Brothers, from his Mother's (Aditi's) bosom, that bosom
 being <em>prima </em>MATER-ia -- the lecturer's primordial <em>protyle.
 </em>Esoteric doctrines teach the existence of "an antecedent
 form of energy having periodic cycles of ebb and swell, rest and
 activity" (p. 21) -- and behold a great scholar in Science
 now asking the world to accept this as one of the postulates.
 We have shown the "Mother," fiery and hot, becoming
 gradually cool and radiant, and that same Scientist claims as
 his second postulate, a <em>scientific necessity</em>,<em> </em>it
 would seem -- "an internal action akin to cooling, operating
 slowly in the protyle." Occult Science teaches that "Mother"
 lies stretched in infinity (during <em>Pralaya</em>)<em> </em>as
 the great Deep, the "<em>dry</em> Waters of Space,"
 according to the quaint expression in the <em>Catechism</em>,<em>
 </em>and becomes <em>wet</em></p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 626 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 only after the separation and the moving over its face of <em>Narayana</em>,<em>
 </em>the "Spirit which is invisible Flame, which never burns,
 but sets on fire all that it touches, and gives it life and generation."*
 And now Science tells us that "the first-born element . .
 . most nearly allied to protyle" . . . would be "<em>hydrogen
 </em>. . . which for some time would be the only existing form
 of matter" in the Universe. What says <em>Old</em> Science?
 It answers: just so; but we would call hydrogen and oxygen (which
 instils the fire of life into the "Mother" by incubation)
 in the <em>pregenetic </em>and even pre-geological ages -- the
 <em>Spirit</em>,<em> </em>the<em> noumenon </em>of that which
 becomes in its grossest form oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen
 on Earth -- nitrogen being of no divine origin, but merely an
 earth-born cement to unite other gases and fluids, and serve as
 a sponge to carry in itself the breath of LIFE -- pure air.**
 Before these <em>gases </em>and fluids become what they are in
 <em>our</em> atmosphere, they are interstellar Ether; still earlier
 and on a <em>deeper </em>plane -- something else, and so on <em>in
 infinitum. </em>The eminent and learned gentleman must pardon
 an Occultist for quoting him at such length; but such is the penalty
 of a Fellow of the Royal Society who approaches so near the precincts
 of the Sacred Adytum of Occult mysteries as virtually to overstep
 the forbidden boundaries.
 </p><p>
 But it is time to leave modern <em>physical </em>science and turn
 to the psychological and metaphysical side of the question. We
 would only remark that to the "two very reasonable postulates"
 required by the eminent lecturer, "to get a glimpse of some
 few of the secrets so darkly hidden" behind "the door
 of the Unknown" -- a third should be added*** -- lest no
 battering at it should avail; the postulate that Leibnitz, in
 his speculations, stood on a firm groundwork of fact and truth.
 The admirable and thoughtful synopsis of these speculations --
 as given by John Theodore Merz in his "Leibnitz" --
 shows how nearly he has brushed the hidden secrets of esoteric
 Theogony in his <em>Monadologie. </em>And yet that philosopher
 has hardly risen in his speculations above the first planes, the
 lower principles of the Cosmic Great Body. His theory soars to
 no loftier heights than those of the <em>manifested </em>life,
 self-consciousness and intelligence, leaving the regions of the
 earlier post-genetic mysteries untouched, as his ethereal fluid
 is post-planetary.
 </p><p>
 But this third postulate will hardly be accepted by the modern
 men

 *** Foremost of all, the postulate that there is no such thing
 in Nature as <em>inorganic </em>substances or bodies. Stones,
 minerals, rocks, and even chemical "atoms" are simply

 <p>
 of Science; and, like Descartes, they will prefer keeping to the
 properties of external things, which, like extension, are incapable
 of explaining the phenomenon of motion, rather than accept the
 latter as an independent Force. They will never become anti-Cartesian
 in this generation; nor will they admit that "this property
 of inertia is not a purely geometrical property, that it points
 to the existence of something in external bodies which is not
 extension merely." This is Leibnitz's idea as analyzed by
 Mertz, who adds that he called this <em>something </em>Force,<em>
 </em>and maintained that external things were endowed with Force,
 and that in order to be the bearers of this force they must have
 a substance, for they are not lifeless and inert masses, but the
 centres and bearers of form, a purely esoteric claim, since <em>force
 </em>was with Leibnitz an <em>active </em>principle, the division
 between mind and matter disappearing by this conclusion. But --
 </p><p>
 "The mathematical and dynamical inquiries of Leibnitz would
 not have led to the same result in the mind of a purely scientific
 inquirer. But Leibnitz was not a scientific man in the modern
 sense of the word. Had he been so, he might have worked out the
 conception of energy, defined mathematically the ideas of force
 and mechanical work, and arrived at the conclusion that even for
 purely scientific purposes it is desirable to look upon force,
 not as a primary quantity, but as a quantity derived from some
 other value."
 </p><p>
 But, luckily for truth --
 </p><p>
 "Leibnitz was a philosopher; and as such he had certain primary
 principles, which biassed him in favour of certain conclusions,
 and his discovery that external things were substances endowed
 with force was at once used for the purpose of applying these
 principles. One of these principles was the law of continuity,
 the conviction that all the world was connected, that there were
 no gaps and chasms which could not be bridged over. The contrast
 of extended thinking substances was unbearable to him. The definition
 of the extended substances had already become untenable: it was
 natural that a similar inquiry was made into the definition of
 mind, the thinking substance. . ."
 </p><p>
 The divisions made by Leibnitz, however incomplete and faulty
 from the standpoint of Occultism, show a spirit of metaphysical
 intuition to which no man of science, not Descartes -- not even
 Kant -- has ever reached. With him there existed ever an infinite
 gradation of thought. Only a small portion of the contents of
 our thoughts, he said, rises into the clearness of apperception,
 "into the light of perfect consciousness." Many remain
 in a confused or obscure state, in the state of "perceptions;"
 but they are there; . . . Descartes denied soul to the animal,
 Leibnitz endowed, as the Occultists do, "the whole creation
 with mental life, this being, according to him, capable of infinite
 gradations." And</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 628 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 this, as Mertz justly observes, "at once widened the realm
 of mental life, destroying the contrast of <em>animate and inanimate
 matter; </em>it did yet more -- it reacted on the conception of
 matter, of the extended substance. For it became evident that
 external or material things presented the property of extension
 to our senses only, not to our thinking faculties. The mathematician,
 in order to calculate geometrical figures, had been obliged to
 divide them into an infinite number of infinitely small parts,
 and the physicist saw no limit to the divisibility of matter into
 atoms. The bulk through which external things seemed to fill space
 was a property which they acquired only through the coarseness
 of our senses. . . . Leibnitz followed these arguments to some
 extent, but he could not rest content in assuming that matter
 was composed of a finite number of very small parts. His mathematical
 mind forced him to carry out the argument <em>in infinitum. </em>And
 what became of the atoms then? They lost their extension and they
 retained only their property of resistance; they were the centres
 of force. They were reduced to mathematical points . . . but if
 their extension in space was nothing, <em>so much fuller was their
 inner life. </em>Assuming that inner existence, such as that of
 the human mind, is a new dimension, not a geometrical but a metaphysical
 dimension . . . having reduced the geometrical extension of the
 atoms to nothing, Leibnitz endowed them with an infinite extension
 in the direction of their metaphysical dimension. After having
 lost sight of them in the world of space, the mind has, as it
 were, to dive into a metaphysical world to find and grasp the
 real essence of what appears in space merely as a mathematical
 point. . . . As a cone stands on its point, or a perpendicular
 straight line cuts a horizontal plane only in one mathematical
 point, but may extend infinitely in height and depth, so the essences
 <em>of things real </em>have only a punctual existence in this
 physical world of space; but have an infinite depth of inner life
 in the metaphysical world of thought . . . " (p. 144).
 </p><p>
 This is the spirit, the very root of occult doctrine and thought.
 The "Spirit-Matter" and "Matter-Spirit" extend
 infinitely <em>in depth</em>,<em> </em>and like "the essence
 of things" of Leibnitz, our essence of things <em>real </em>is
 <em>at the seventh depth; </em>while the <em>unreal </em>and gross
 matter of Science and the external world, is at the lowest end
 of our perceptive senses. The Occultist knows the worth or worthlessness
 of the latter.
 </p><p>
 The student must now be shown the fundamental distinction between
 the system of Leibnitz* and that of occult philosophy, on the
 question of the Monads, and this may be done with his <em>Monadology
 </em>before us. It may be correctly stated that were Leibnitz'
 and Spinoza's systems

 <p>
 reconciled, the essence and Spirit of esoteric philosophy would
 be made to appear. From the shock of the two -- as opposed to
 the Cartesian system -- emerge the truths of the Archaic doctrine.
 Both opposed the metaphysics of Descartes. His idea of the contrast
 of two substances -- Extension and Thought -- radically differing
 from each other and mutually irreducible, was too arbitrary and
 too unphilosophical for them. Thus Leibnitz made of the two Cartesian
 substances two attributes of one universal unity, in which he
 saw God. Spinoza recognised but one universal indivisible substance
 and absolute ALL, like Parabrahmam. Leibnitz, on the contrary
 perceived the existence of a plurality of substances. There was
 but ONE for Spinoza; for Leibnitz an infinitude of Beings, <em>from</em>,<em>
 </em>and<em> in</em>, the One. Hence, though both admitted but
 <em>one real Entity</em>,<em> </em>while Spinoza made it impersonal
 and indivisible, Leibnitz divided his <em>personal </em>Deity
 into a number of divine and semi-divine Beings. Spinoza was a
 <em>subjective</em>,<em> </em>Leibnitz an <em>objective </em>Pantheist,
 yet both were great philosophers in their intuitive perceptions.
 </p><p>
 Now, if these two teachings were blended together and each corrected
 by the other, -- and foremost of all the One Reality weeded of
 its personality -- there would remain as sum total a true spirit
 of esoteric philosophy in them; the impersonal, attributeless,
 absolute divine essence which is <em>no </em>"Being,"
 but the root of all being. Draw a deep line in your thought between
 that ever-incognizable essence, and the, as invisible, yet comprehensible
 Presence (<em>Mulaprakriti</em>),<em> </em>or Schekinah, from
 <em>beyond and through which </em>vibrates the Sound of the <em>Verbum</em>,<em>
 </em>and from which evolve the numberless hierarchies of intelligent
 <em>Egos</em>,<em> </em>of conscious as of semi-conscious, <em>perceptive</em>
 and <em>apperceptive </em>Beings, whose essence is spiritual Force,
 whose Substance is the Elements and whose Bodies (when needed)
 are the <em>atoms </em>--<em> </em>and our doctrine is there.
 For, says Leibnitz, "the primitive Element of every material
 body being Force, which has none of the characteristics of (<em>objective</em>)<em>
 </em>matter -- it can be conceived but can never be the object
 of any imaginative representation." That which was for him
 the primordial and ultimate element in every body and object was
 thus not the material atoms, or molecules, necessarily more or
 less extended, as those of Epicurus and Gassendi, but, as Mertz
 shows, immaterial and metaphysical atoms, 'mathematical points';
 or <em>real souls</em>,<em> </em>--<em> </em>as explained by Henri
 Lachelier (<em>Professeur agrege de Philosophie</em>),<em> </em>his
 French biographer. "That which exists outside of us in an
 absolute manner, are Souls whose essence is force,"<em> </em>(<em>Monadologie</em>,<em>
 Introd.</em>)<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Thus, <em>reality </em>in the manifested world is composed of
 a <em>unity of units</em>,<em> </em>so to say, immaterial (from
 our stand-point) and infinite. This Leibnitz calls "Monads,"
 Eastern philosophy "<em>Jivas</em>"<em> </em>--<em>
 </em>and Occultism gives it, with the Kabalists and all the Christians,
 a variety of names. </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 630 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 They are with us, as with Leibnitz -- "the expression of
 the universe,"* and every physical point is but the phenomenal
 expression of the noumenal, metaphysical point. His distinction
 between <em>perception </em>and<em> apperception</em>,<em> </em>is
 the philosophical though dim expression of the Esoteric teachings.
 His "reduced universes," of which "there are as
 many as there are Monads" -- is the chaotic representation
 of our Septenary System with its divisions and sub-divisions.
 </p><p>
 As to the relation his Monads bear to our Dhyan-Chohans, Cosmic
 Spirits, Devas and Elementals, we may reproduce briefly the opinion
 of a learned and thoughtful theosophist, Mr. H. A. Bjerregaard,
 on the subject. In an excellent paper "On the Elementals,
 the Elementary Spirits, and the relationship between them and
 Human Beings," read by him before the "Aryan Theosophical
 Society of New York" (see <strong>P</strong>ATH, Nos. 10
 and 11, of Jan. and Feb. 1887), Mr. Bjerregaard formulates distinctly
 his opinion. . . . . "To Spinoza, substance is dead and inactive,
 but to Leibnitz's penetrating mind everything is living activity
 and active energy. In holding this view, <em>he comes infinitely
 nearer the Orient than any other thinker of his day</em>,<em>
 or after him. </em>His discovery that <em>an active energy forms
 the essence of Substance </em>is a principle that <em>places him
 in direct relationship to the Seers of the East.</em>"
 </p><p>
 And the lecturer proceeds to show that to Leibnitz atoms and elements
 are<em> centres of force</em>,<em> </em>or rather "spiritual
 beings whose very nature is to act," for the elementary particles
 are not acting mechanically, but from an <em>internal </em>principle.
 They are incorporeal spiritual units ("substantial,"
 however, but not <em>immaterial </em>in our sense) inaccessible
 to all changes from without, and indestructible by any external
 force. Leibnitz's monads, adds the lecturer, "differ from
 atoms in the following particulars, which are very important for
 us to remember, otherwise we shall not be able to see the difference
 between elementals and mere matter." . . . . "Atoms
 are not distinguished from each other, they are qualitatively
 alike; but one monad differs from every other monad qualitatively;
 and every one is a peculiar world to itself. Not so with atoms;
 they are absolutely alike quantitatively and qualitatively, and
 possess no individuality of their own.** Again, the atoms (molecules,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * "Leibnitz's Dynamism," says Professor Lachelier, "would
 offer but little difficulty if, with him, the Monad had remained
 a simple atom of <em>blind force. </em>But . . . ." One perfectly
 understands the perplexity of modern materialism!
 </p><p>
 ** Leibnitz was an <em>absolute </em>Idealist in maintaining that
 "material atoms are contrary to reason" (<em>Systeme
 nouveau</em>,<em> </em>Erdmann, p. 126. col. 2). For him <em>matter
 </em>was a simple representation of the monad, whether human or
 atomic. Monads, he thought (as we do), are everywhere. Thus the
 human soul is a monad, and every cell in the human body has its
 monad, as every cell in animal, vegetable, and even in the (so-called)
 <em>inorganic </em>bodies. His <em>atoms </em>are the molecules
 of modern Science, and his monads those <em>simple </em>[[Footnote

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 631 MAYA AND MAHAMAYA.</h6>
 
 <p>
 rather) of materialistic philosophy can be considered as extended
 and divisible, while the monads are mere mathematical points and
 indivisible. Finally, and this is a point where these monads of
 Leibnitz closely resemble the elementals of mystic philosophy
 -- these monads are representative Beings. Every monad reflects
 every other. Every monad is a living mirror of the Universe within
 its own sphere. And mark this, for upon it depends the power possessed
 by these monads, and upon this depends the work they can do for
 us; in mirroring the world, the monads are not mere passive reflective
 agents, but <em>spontaneously self</em>-<em>active</em>; they
 produce the images spontaneously, as the soul does a dream. In
 every monad, therefore, the adept may read everything, even the
 future. Every monad or <em>Elemental </em>is a looking-glass that
 can speak. . ."
 </p><p>
 It is at this point that Leibnitz's philosophy breaks down. There
 is no provision made, nor any distinction established, between
 the "Elemental" monad and that of a high Planetary Spirit,
 or even the human monad or Soul. He even goes so far as to sometimes
 doubt whether "God has ever made anything but Monads or substances
 without extension." (<em>Examen des Principes du P. Malebranche.</em>)<em>
 </em>He<em> </em>draws a distinction between Monads and Atoms,*
 because, as he repeatedly states, "bodies with all their
 qualities are only phenomenal, like the rainbow. . . . <em>Corpora
 omnia cum omnibus qualitatibus suis non sunt aliud quam phenomena
 bene fundata</em>,<em> ut Iris</em>"<em> </em>(Letter to
 Father Desbosses, <em>Correspondence</em>,<em> </em>letter xviii.)
 -- but soon after he finds a provision for this in a substantial
 correspondence, a certain metaphysical bond between the monads
 -- <em>vinculum substantiale. </em>Esoteric philosophy, teaching
 an <em>objective </em>Idealism -- though it regards the objective
 Universe and all in it as <em>Maya</em>,<em> </em>temporary illusion
 -- draws a practical distinction between collective illusion,
 <em>Mahamaya</em>,<em> </em>from the purely metaphysical stand-point,
 and the objective relations in it between various conscious <em>Egos
 </em>so long as this illusion lasts. The adept, therefore, <em>may</em>
 read the future in an Elemental Monad, but he has to draw for
 this object a great number of them, as each monad represents only
 a portion of the Kingdom it belongs to. "It is not in the
 object, but in the modification of the cognition of the object
 that the Monads are limited. They all go confusedly to the infinite,
 to the all, but they are all limited and distinguished by the

 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] <em>atoms </em>that
 materialistic Science takes on faith, though it will never succeed
 in <em>interviewing </em>them -- except in imagination. But Leibnitz
 is rather contradictory in his views about Monads. He speaks of
 his <em>Metaphysical Points </em>and<em> Formal Atoms</em>,<em>
 </em>at one time as <em>realities</em>,<em> </em>occupying space;
 at another as pure Spiritual <em>ideas; </em>then again endows
 them with objectivity and aggregates and positions in their co-relations.
 </p><p>
 * The <em>atoms </em>of Leibnitz have, in truth, nothing but the
 name in common with the atoms of the Greek Materialists, or even
 the <em>molecules </em>of modern Science. He calls them formal
 atoms, and compares them to the substantial forms of Aristotle.

 <p>
 degrees of distinct perceptions." (ยง 60, <em>Monadologie</em>.)*<em>
 </em>And as Leibnitz explains, "All the portions of the Universe
 are distinctly represented in the Monads, <em>but some are reflected
 in one monad</em>,<em> some in another;</em>"<em> </em>but
 a number of monads could represent simultaneously the thoughts
 of the two millions of inhabitants of Paris.
 </p><p>
 But what say the Occult Sciences to this, and what do they add?
 </p><p>
 They say that what is called collectively <em>Monads </em>by Leibnitz
 -- roughly viewed, and leaving every subdivision out of calculation,
 for the present** -- may be separated into three distinct Hosts,
 which, counted from the highest planes, are, firstly, "gods,"
 or conscious, spiritual <em>Egos; </em>the intelligent architects,
 who work after the plan in the <em>Divine Mind. </em>Then come
 the Elementals, or <em>Monads</em>,<em> </em>who form collectively
 and unconsciously the grand Universal Mirrors of everything connected
 with their respective realms. Lastly, the atoms, or material molecules,
 which are informed in their turn by their <em>apperceptive</em>
 monads, just as every cell in a human body is so informed. (See
 the closing pages of Book I.) There are shoals of such <em>informed
 </em>atoms which, in their turn, inform the molecules; an infinitude
 of monads, or Elementals proper, and countless spiritual Forces
 -- <em>Monadless</em>,<em> </em>for they are pure incorporealities,***
 except under certain laws, when they assume a form -- not<em>
 necessarily human. </em>Whence the substance that clothes them
 -- the apparent organism they evolve around their centres? The
 <em>Formless </em>("Arupa") Radiations, existing in
 the harmony of Universal Will, and being what we term the collective
 or the aggregate of Cosmic Will on the plane of the subjective
 Universe, unite together an infinitude of monads -- each the mirror
 of its own Universe -- and thus individualize

 * Leibnitz, like Aristotle, calls the created or <em>emanated
 </em>monads (the Elementals issued from Cosmic Spirits or Gods)
 -- <em>Entelechies</em>,<em> </em>[[<em>Entelecheia</em>]] --
 and "incorporeal <em>automata.</em>"<em> </em>(ยง
 18, <em>Monadologie.</em>)
 </p><p>
 ** These three "rough divisions" correspond to <em>spirit</em>,<em>
 mind </em>(or soul), and <em>body</em>,<em> </em>in the human
 constitution.

 *** Brother C. H. A. Bjerregaard, in his lecture (already mentioned),
 warns his audience not to regard the <em>Sephiroth </em>too much
 as <em>individualities</em>,<em> </em>but to avoid at the same
 time seeing in them <em>abstractions. </em>"We shall never
 arrive at the truth," he says, "much less the power
 of <em>associating with those celestials</em>,<em> </em>until
 we return to the simplicity and fearlessness of the primitive
 ages, when men mixed freely with the gods, and the gods descended
 among men and guided them in truth and holiness" (No. 10,<em>
 Path</em>)<em> </em>. . . . "There are several designations
 for 'angels' in the Bible which clearly show that beings like
 the Elementals of the Kabala and the monads of Leibnitz, must
 be understood by that term rather than that which is commonly
 understood. They are called 'morning stars,' 'flaming fires,'
 'the mighty ones,' and St. Paul sees them in his cosmogonic vision
 as 'Principalities and Powers.' Such names as these preclude the
 idea of personality, and we find ourselves compelled to think
 of them as impersonal Existences . . . as an <em>influence</em>,<em>
 </em>a spiritual substance, or <em>conscious Force.</em>"
 (<em>Path</em>,<em> </em>No. 11, p. 322.)</p><hr>

 <p>
 for the time being an independent mind, omniscient and universal;
 and by the same process of magnetic aggregation they create for
 themselves objective, visible bodies, out of the interstellar
 atoms. For atoms and Monads, associated or dissociated, simple
 or complex, are, from the moment of the first differentiation,
 but the <em>principles</em>,<em> </em>corporeal, psychic and Spiritual,
 of the "Gods," -- themselves the Radiations of primordial
 nature. Thus, to the eye of the Seer, the higher Planetary Powers
 appear under two aspects: the subjective -- <em>as influences</em>,<em>
 </em>and the objective -- as mystic FORMS, which, under Karmic
 law, become a <em>Presence</em>,<em> </em>Spirit and Matter being
 One, as repeatedly stated. Spirit is matter <em>on the seventh
 plane; </em>matter is Spirit -- on the lowest point of its cyclic
 activity; and both -- are <strong>M</strong>AYA.
 </p><p>
 Atoms are called "Vibrations" in Occultism; also "Sound"
 -- collectively. This does not interfere with Mr. Tyndall's scientific
 discovery. He traced, on the lower rung of the ladder of monadic
 being, the whole course of the <em>atmospheric vibrations </em>--<em>
 </em>and this constitutes the <em>objective </em>part of the process
 in nature. He has traced and recorded the rapidity of their motion
 and transmission; the force of their impact; their setting up
 vibrations in the tympanum and their transmission of these to
 the stolithes, etc., etc., till the vibration of the auditory
 nerve commences -- and a new phenomenon now takes place: the <em>subjective
 side </em>of the process or <em>the sensation of Sound. </em>Does
 he perceive or see it? No; for his speciality is to discover the
 behaviour of matter. But why should not a psychic see it, a spiritual
 seer, whose inner Eye is opened, and who can see through the veil
 of matter? The waves and undulations of Science are all produced
 by atoms propelling their molecules into activity <em>from within.
 </em>Atoms fill the immensity of Space, and by their continuous
 vibration <em>are </em>that MOTION which keeps the wheels of Life
 perpetually going. It is that inner work that produces the natural
 phenomena called the correlation of Forces. Only, at the origin
 of every such "force," there stands the <em>conscious
 </em>guiding noumenon thereof -- Angel or God, Spirit or Demon
 -- ruling powers, yet the same.
 </p><p>
 As described by Seers -- those who can see the motion of the interstellar
 shoals, and follow them in their evolution clairvoyantly -- they
 are dazzling, like specks of virgin snow in radiant sunlight.
 Their velocity is swifter than thought, quicker than any mortal
 physical eye could follow, and, as well as can be judged from
 the tremendous rapidity of their course, the motion is circular.
 . . . . Standing on an open plain, on a mountain summit especially,
 and gazing into the vast vault above and the spacial infinitudes
 around, the whole atmosphere seems ablaze with them, the air soaked
 through with these dazzling coruscations. At times, the intensity
 of their motion produces flashes</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 634 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 like the Northern lights during the <em>Aurora Borealis. </em>The
 sight is so marvellous, that, as the Seer gazes into this inner
 world, and feels the scintillating points shoot past him, he is
 filled with awe at the thought of other, still greater mysteries,
 that lie beyond, and within, this radiant ocean. . . . .
 </p><p>
 However imperfect and incomplete this explanation on "Gods,
 Monads and Atoms," it is hoped that some students and theosophists,
 at least, will feel that there may be indeed a close relation
 between materialistic Science, and Occultism, which is the complement
 and missing soul of the former.
