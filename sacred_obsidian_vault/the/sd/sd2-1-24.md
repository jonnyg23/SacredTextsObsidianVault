 <h4>ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTS FROM A COMMENTARY <br>
 ON THE VERSES OF STANZA XII.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>MS.</strong> from which these additional
 explanations are taken belongs to the group called <em>"Tongshaktchi
 Sangye Songa," </em>or the Records of the "Thirty-five
 Buddhas of Confession," as they are <em>exoterically </em>called.
 These personages, however, though called in the Northern Buddhist
 religion "Buddhas," may just as well be called Rishis,
 or Avatars, etc., as they are "Buddhas who have preceded
 Sakyamuni" only for the Northern followers of the ethics
 preached by Gautama. These great Mahatmas, or Buddhas, are a universal
 and common property: they are <em>historical </em>sages <em>-</em>-
 at any rate, for all the Occultists who believe in such a hierarchy
 of Sages, the existence of which has been proved to them by the
 learned ones of the Fraternity. They are chosen from among some
 ninety-seven Buddhas in one group, and fifty-three in another,*
 mostly imaginary personages, who are really the personifications
 of the powers of the first-named.** These "baskets"
 of the oldest writings on "palm leaves" are kept very
 secret. Each <strong>MS</strong>. has appended to it a short synopsis
 of the history of that sub-race to which the particular "Buddha-Lha"
 belonged. The one special <strong>MS</strong>. from which the
 fragments which follow are extracted, and then rendered into a
 more comprehensible language, is said to have been copied from
 stone tablets which belonged to a Buddha of the earliest day of
 the Fifth Race, who had witnessed the Deluge and the submersion
 of the chief continents of the Atlantean race. The day when much,
 if not all, of that which is given here from the archaic records,
 will be found correct, is not far distant. Then the modern symbologists
 will acquire the certitude that even Odin, or the god Woden, the
 highest god in the German and Scandinavian mythology, is one of
 these thirty-five Buddhas; one of the earliest, indeed, for the
 continent to which he and his race belonged, is also one of the
 earliest. So early, in truth, that in the days when tropical nature
 was to be found, where now lie eternal unthawing snows, one could
 cross almost by dry land from Norway <em>via </em>Iceland and
 Greenland, to the lands that at present surround Hudson's
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * Gautama Buddha, named Shakya Thub-pa, is the <em>twenty-seventh
 </em>of the last group, as most of these Buddhas belong to the
 <em>divine dynasties </em>which instructed mankind.
 </p><p>
 ** Of these "Buddhas," or the "Enlightened,"
 the far distant predecessors of Gautama the Buddha, and who represent,
 we are taught, once living men, great adepts and Saints, in whom
 the "Sons of Wisdom" had incarnated, and who were, therefore,
 so to speak, minor Avatars of the Celestial Beings -- eleven only
 belong to the Atlantean race, and 24 to the Fifth race, from its
 beginnings. They are identical with the Tirtankaras of the Jainas.

 Bay.* Just, as in the palmy days of the Atlantean giants, the
 sons of the "giants from the East," a pilgrim could
 perform a journey from what in our days is termed the Sahara desert,
 to the lands which now rest in dreamless sleep at the bottom of
 the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Events
 which were never written outside the human memory, but which were
 religiously transmitted from one generation to another, and from
 race to race, may have been preserved by constant transmission
 "within the book volume of the brain," and through countless
 aeons, with more truth and accuracy than inside any written document
 or record. "That which is part of our souls is eternal,"
 says Thackeray; and what can be nearer to our souls than that
 which happens at the dawns of our lives? Those lives are countless,
 but the soul or spirit that animates us throughout these myriads
 of existences is the same; and though "the book and volume"
 of the <em>physical</em> brain may forget events within the scope
 of one terrestrial life, the bulk of collective recollections
 can never desert the divine soul within us. Its whispers may be
 too soft, the sound of its words too far off the plane perceived
 by our physical senses; yet the shadow of events <em>that were,</em>
 just as much as the shadow of the events <em>that are to come,
 </em>is within its perceptive powers, and is ever present before
 its mind's eye.
 </p><p>
 It is this soul-voice, perhaps, which tells those who believe
 in tradition more than in written History, that what is said below
 is all true, and relates to pre-historic facts.
 </p><p>
 This is what is written in one passage: --
 </p><p>
 "<strong>T</strong>HE <strong>K</strong>INGS OF <strong>L</strong>IGHT
 HAVE DEPARTED IN WRATH. <strong>T</strong>HE SINS OF MEN HAVE
 BECOME SO BLACK THAT <strong>E</strong>ARTH QUIVERS IN HER GREAT
 AGONY. . . . <strong>T</strong>HE AZURE SEATS REMAIN EMPTY. <strong>W</strong>HO
 OF THE <strong>B</strong>ROWN, WHO OF THE <strong>R</strong>ED,
 OR YET AMONG THE <strong>B</strong>LACK (<em>races</em>),<em>
 </em>CAN SIT IN THE SEATS OF THE<strong> B</strong>LESSED, THE
 <strong>S</strong>EATS OF KNOWLEDGE AND MERCY! <strong>W</strong>HO
 CAN ASSUME THE FLOWER OF POWER, THE PLANT OF THE GOLDEN STEM AND
 THE AZURE BLOSSOM?"
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * This may account for the similarity of the artificial mounds
 in the U. S. of America, and the tumuli in Norway. It is this
 identity that led some American archaeologists to suggest that
 Norwegian mariners had <em>discovered </em>America some one thousand
 years ago. (<em>Vide</em> Holmboe's <em>Traces de Bouddhisme en
 Norvege, </em>p. 23). There is no doubt that America is that "far
 distant land into which pious men and heavy storms had transferred
 the sacred doctrine," as a Chinese writer suggested by his
 description to Neumann. But neither Professor Holmboe, of Stockholm,
 nor the American archaeologists, have guessed the right age of
 the mounds, or the tumuli. The fact that Norwegians may have re-discovered
 the land that their long-forgotten forefathers believed to have
 perished in the general submersion, does not conflict with that
 other fact that the <em>Secret Doctrine </em>of the land which
 was the cradle of physical man, and of the Fifth Race, had found
 its way into the so-called <em>New World </em>ages and ages before
 the "Sacred Doctrine" of Buddhism.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 425 THE OLDEST RECORDS ABOUT ATLANTIS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The "Kings of Light" is the name given in all old records
 to the Sovereigns of the divine Dynasties. The "azure seats"
 are translated "celestial thrones" in certain documents.
 The "flower of power" is now the Lotus; what it may
 have been at that period, who can tell.
 </p><p>
 The writer proceeds, like the later Jeremiah, to bewail the fate
 of his people. They had become bereft of their "azure"
 (celestial) kings, and "they of the <em>Deva </em>hue,"
 the moon-like complexion, and "they of the refulgent (golden)
 face" have gone "to the land of bliss, the land of metal
 and fire"; or -- agreeably with the rules of symbolism --
 to the lands lying North and East, from whence "the great
 waters have been swept away, sucked in by the earth and dissipated
 in the air." The wise races had perceived "the black
 storm-dragons, called down by the dragons of wisdom" -- and
 "had fled, led on by the shining Protectors of the most Excellent
 Land" -- the great ancient adepts, presumably; those the
 Hindus refer to as their Manus and Rishis. One of them was Vaivasvata
 Manu.
 </p><p>
 They "of the yellow hue" are the forefathers of those
 whom Ethnology now classes as the Turanians, the Mongols, Chinese
 and other ancient nations; and the land they fled to was no other
 than Central Asia. There entire new races were born; there they
 lived and died until the separation of the nations. But this "separation"
 did not take place either in the localities assigned for it by
 modern science, nor in the way the Aryans are shown to have divided
 and separated by Mr. Max Muller and other <em>Aryanists. </em>Nearly
 two-thirds of one million years have elapsed since that period.
 The yellow-faced giants of the post-Atlantean day, had ample time,
 throughout this forced confinement to one part of the world, and
 with the same racial blood and without any fresh infusion or admixture
 in it, to branch off during a period of nearly 700,000 years into
 the most heterogeneous and diversified types. The same is shown
 in Africa; nowhere does a more extraordinary variability of types
 exist, from black to almost white, from gigantic men to dwarfish
 races; and this only because of their forced isolation. The Africans
 have never left their continent for several hundred thousands
 of years. If to-morrow the continent of Europe were to disappear
 and other lands to re-emerge instead; and if the African tribes
 were to separate and scatter on the face of the earth, it is they
 who, in about a hundred thousand years hence, would form the bulk
 of the civilized nations. And it is the descendants of those of
 our highly cultured nations, who might have survived on some one
 island, without any means of crossing the new seas, that would
 fall back into a state of relative savagery. Thus the reason given
 for dividing humanity into <em>superior </em>and <em>inferior
 </em>races falls to the ground and becomes a fallacy.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 426 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Such are the statements made and facts given in the archaic records.
 Collating and comparing them with some modern theories of Evolution,
 <em>minus natural selection</em> (<em>Vide </em>"Physiological
 Selection" by G. J. Romanes, <strong>F.R.S.</strong>), these
 statements appear quite reasonable and logical.* Thus, while the
 Aryans are the descendants of the <em>yellow </em>Adams, the gigantic
 and highly civilized tlanto-Aryan race, the Semites -- and the
 Jews along with them -- are those of the red Adam; and both de
 Quatrefages and the writers of the Mosaic <em>Genesis </em>are
 right. For, could chapter v. of the First Book of Moses be compared
 with the genealogies found in our Archaic Bible, the period from
 Adam unto Noah would be found noticed therein, of course under
 different names, the respective years of the Patriarchs being
 turned into periods, the whole being shown symbolical and allegorical.
 In the <strong>MS</strong>. under consideration many and frequent
 are the references to the great knowledge and civilization of
 the Atlantean nations, showing the polity of several of them and
 the nature of their arts and sciences. If the Third Root-Race,
 the Lemuro-Atlanteans, are already spoken of as having been drowned
 "with their high civilizations and gods" (<em>"Esoteric
 Buddhism," </em>p. 65), how much more may the same be said
 of the Atlanteans!
 </p><p>
 It is from the Fourth Race that the early Aryans got their knowledge
 of "the bundle of wonderful things," the <em>Sabha </em>and<em>
 Mayasabha, </em>mentioned in the Mahabharata, the gift of Mayasur
 to the Pandavas. It is from them that they learnt aeronautics,
 <em>Viwan Vidya </em>(the "knowledge of flying in air-vehicles"),
 and, therefore, their great arts of meteorography and meteorology.
 It is from them, again, that the Aryans inherited their most valuable
 science of the hidden virtues of precious and other stones, of
 chemistry, or rather alchemy, of mineralogy, geology, physics
 and astronomy.
 </p><p>
 Several times the writer has put to herself the question: "Is
 the story of Exodus -- in its details at least -- as narrated
 in the Old Testament, original? Or is it, like the story of Moses
 himself and many others, simply another version of the legends
 told of the Atlanteans?" For who, upon hearing the story
 told of the latter, will fail to perceive the great similarity
 of the fundamental features? The anger of "God" at the
 obduracy of Pharaoh, his command to the "chosen" ones,
 to spoil the Egyptians, before departing, of their "jewels
 of silver and jewels of gold" (Exod. xi.); and finally the
 Egyptians and their Pharaoh drowned in the Red Sea (xiv.). For
 here is a fragment of the earlier story from the Commentary: --

 . . . <em>"And the 'great King of the dazzling Face,' the
 chief of all the</em> <em>Yellow-faced, was sad, seeing the sins
 of the Black-faced.</em> 
 </p><p>
 <em>"He sent his air-vehicles</em> (Viwan)<em> to all his

 <em>'The Lords of the storm are approaching. Their chariots are

 </p><p>
 "(But) <em>the nations had now crossed the dry lands. They

 and Metal </em>(East and North)."
 </p><p>
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
 </p><p>
 Still, in another passage, it is said: --
 </p><p>
 " . . . <em>. Stars </em>(meteors)<em> showered on the lands
 of the</em> <em>black</em> <em>Faces;</em> <em>but they slept.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 <em>"The speaking beasts </em>(the magic watchers) <em>kept
 quiet.</em> 
 </p><p>
 <em>"The nether lords waited for orders, but they came not,
 for their</em> <em>masters slept.</em> 
 </p><p>
 <em>"The waters arose, and covered the valleys from one end
 of the Earth</em> <em>to the other. High lands remained, the bottom
 of the Earth </em>(the lands of the antipodes) <em>remained dry.
 There dwelt those who escaped; the men of</em> <em>the yellow-faces
 and of the straight eye </em>(the frank and sincere people).
 </p><p>
 <em>"When the Lords of the Dark Faces awoke and bethought
 themselves</em> <em>of their Viwans in order to escape from the
 rising waters, they found</em> <em>them gone."</em> 
 </p><p>
 Then a passage shows some of the more powerful magicians of the
 "Dark Face" -- who awoke earlier than the others --
 pursuing those who had "spoilt them" and who were in
 the rear-guard, for -- <em>"the nations</em> <em>that were
 led away, were as thick as the stars of the milky way," </em>says
 a more modern Commentary, written in Sanskrit only.
 </p><p>
 <em>"Like as a dragon-snake uncoils slowly its body, so the
 Sons of men,</em> <em>led on by the Sons of Wisdom, opened their
 folds, and spreading out,</em> <em>expanded like a running stream
 of sweet waters</em>. . . . . . <em>many of the faint-hearted
 among them perished on their way. But most were saved."</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Yet the pursuers, "whose heads and chests soared high above
 the water," chased them "for three lunar terms"
 until finally reached by the rising waves, they perished to the
 last man, the soil sinking under their feet and the earth engulfing
 those who had desecrated her.
 </p><p>
 This sounds a good deal like the original material upon which
 the similar story in <em>Exodus </em>was built many hundred thousands
 of years later. The biography of Moses, the story of his birth,
 childhood and rescue from the Nile by Pharaoh's daughter, is now
 shown to have been adapted from the Chaldean narrative about Sargon.
 And if so, the Assyrian tile in the British Museum being a good
 proof of it, why not that of the Jews robbing the Egyptians of
 their jewels, the death of Pharaoh and his army, and so on? The
 gigantic magicians of Ruta and Daitya, the "lords of the
 Dark Face," may have become in the later narrative the Egyptian
 Magi, and the yellow-faced nations of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 429 SHADOWY MEMENTOS OF THE PAST.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the Fifth Race, the virtuous sons of Jacob, the "chosen people."
 . . . One more statement has to be made: There have been several
 Divine Dynasties -- a series for every Root Race beginning with
 the Third, each series according and adapted to its Humanity.
 The last Seven Dynasties referred to in the Egyptian and Chaldean
 records belong to the Fifth Race, which, though generally called
 Aryan, was not entirely so, as it was ever largely mixed up with
 races to which Ethnology gives other names. It would be impossible,
 in view of the limited space at our disposal, to go any further
 into the description of the Atlanteans, in whom the whole East
 believes as much as we believe in the ancient Egyptians, but whose
 existence the majority of the Western Scientists deny, as they
 have denied, before this, many a truth, from the existence of
 Homer down to that of the carrier pigeon. The civilization of
 the Atlanteans was greater even than that of the Egyptians. It
 is their degenerate descendants, the nation of Plato's Atlantis,
 which built the first Pyramids in the country, and that certainly
 before the advent of the "Eastern AEthiopians," as Herodotus
 calls the Egyptians. This may be well inferred from the statement
 made by Ammianus Marcellinus, who says of the Pyramids that "there
 are also subterranean passages and winding retreats, which, it
 is said, men skilful in the ancient mysteries, by means of which
 they divined the coming of a flood, constructed in different places
 lest the memory of all their sacred ceremonies should be lost."
 </p><p>
 These men who "divined the coming of floods" were not
 Egyptians, who never had any, except the periodical rising of
 the Nile. Who were they? The last remnants of the Atlanteans,
 we maintain. Those races which are dimly suspected by Science,
 and thinking of which Mr. Ch. Gould, the well-known geologist,
 says: "Can we suppose that we have at all exhausted the great
 museum of nature? Have we, in fact, penetrated yet beyond its
 antechambers? Does the written history of man, comprising a few
 thousand years, embrace the whole course of his intelligent existence?
 Or have we in the long mythical eras, extending over hundreds
 of thousands of years, and recorded in the chronologies of Chaldea
 and of China, shadowy mementos of pre-historic man, handed down
 by tradition, and perhaps transported by a few survivors to existing
 lands from others, which, like the fabled (?) Atlantis of Plato,
 may have been submerged, or the scene of some great catastrophe
 which destroyed them with all their civilization" (<em>"Mythical
 Monsters,"</em> <em>p</em>. 19).
 </p><p>
 After this one can turn with more confidence to the words of a
 Master who wrote, several years before these words were penned
 by Mr. Gould: -- "The Fourth Race had its periods of the
 highest civilization. Greek and Roman and even Egyptian civilizations
 are nothing com-</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 430 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 pared to the civilizations that began with the Third Race"
 -- after its separation.
 </p><p>
 But if this civilization and the mastery of arts and sciences
 are denied to the Third and Fourth Races, no one will deny that
 between the great civilizations of antiquity, such as those of
 Egypt and India, there stretched the dark ages of crass ignorance
 and barbarism ever since the beginning of the Christian era up
 to our modern civilization; during which period all recollection
 of these traditions was lost. As said in <em>Isis Unveiled: </em>"Why
 should we forget that, ages before the prow of the adventurous
 Genoese clove the Western waters, the Phoenician vessels had circumnavigated
 the globe, and spread civilization in regions now silent and deserted?
 What archaeologist will dare assert that the same hand which planned
 the Pyramids of Egypt, Karnak, and the thousand ruins now crumbling
 to oblivion on the sandy banks of the Nile, did <em>not</em> erect
 the monumental Nagkon-Wat of Cambodia? or trace the hieroglyphics
 on the obelisks and doors of the deserted Indian village, newly
 discovered in British Columbia by Lord Dufferin? or those on the
 ruins of Palenque and Uxmal, of Central America? Do not the relics
 we treasure in our museums -- last mementos of the long 'lost
 arts' -- speak loudly in favour of ancient civilization? And do
 they not prove, over and over again, that nations and continents
 that have passed away have buried along with them arts and sciences,
 which neither the first crucible ever heated in a mediaeval cloister,
 nor the last cracked by a modern chemist, have revived, nor will
 -- at least, in the present century."
 </p><p>
 And the same question may be put now that was put then; it may
 be once more asked: "How does it happen that the most advanced
 standpoint that has been reached in our times, only enables us
 to see in the dim distance up the Alpine path of knowledge the
 monumental proofs that earlier explorers have left to mark the
 plateaux they had reached and occupied?
 </p><p>
 "If modern masters are so much in advance of the old ones,
 why do they not restore to us the lost arts of our postdiluvian
 forefathers? Why do they not give us the unfading colours of Luxor
 -- the Tyrian purple; the bright vermilion and dazzling blue which
 decorate the walls of this place, and are as bright as on the
 first day of their application? The indestructible cement of the
 pyramids and of ancient aqueducts; the Damascus blade, which can
 be turned like a corkscrew in its scabbard without breaking; the
 gorgeous, unparalleled tints of the stained glass that is found
 amid the dust of old ruins and beams in the windows of ancient
 cathedrals; and the secret of the true malleable glass? And if
 chemistry is so little able to rival even the early mediaeval
 ages in some arts, why boast of achievements which, accord-</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 431 MISTAKES OF THE EGYPTOLOGISTS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 ing to strong probability, were perfectly known thousands of years
 ago? The more archeology and philology advance, the more humiliating
 to our pride are the discoveries which are daily made, the more
 glorious testimony do they bear in behalf of those who, perhaps
 on account of the distance of their remote antiquity, have been
 until now considered ignorant flounderers in the deepest mire
 of superstition."
 </p><p>
 Among other arts and sciences, the ancients -- ay, as a heirloom
 from the Atlanteans -- had those of astronomy and symbolism, which
 included the knowledge of the Zodiac.
 </p><p>
 As already explained, the whole of antiquity believed, with good
 reason, that humanity and its races are all intimately connected
 with the planets, and these with Zodiacal signs. The whole world's
 History is recorded in the latter. In the ancient temples of Egypt
 this was proved by the Dendera Zodiac; but except in an Arabic
 work, the property of a <em>Sufi, </em>the writer has never met
 with a correct copy of these marvellous records of the past, as
 also of the <em>future, </em>history of our globe. Yet the original
 records exist, most undeniably.
 </p><p>
 As Europeans are unacquainted with the real Zodiacs of India,
 nor do they understand those they happen to know (witness Bentley),
 the reader is advised, in order to verify the statement, to turn
 to the work of Denon (<em>Travels in Egypt, Vol. II.</em>)<em>
 </em>in which, <em>if understood, </em>the two famous Egyptian
 Zodiacs, can be found and examined. Having seen them personally,
 the writer has no longer need to trust to what other students
 -- who have examined and studied both very carefully - have to
 say of them. As asserted by the Egyptian Priests to Herodotus,
 who was informed that the terrestrial Pole and the Pole of the
 Ecliptic had formerly coincided, thus was it found and corroborated
 by Mackey.* For he states that the Poles are represented on the
 Zodiacs in both positions, "And in that which shows the Poles
 (polar axes) at right angles, there are marks which prove that
 'it was not the last time they were in that position; <em>but
 the first</em>' -- after the Zodiacs had been traced." "Capricorn,"
 he adds, "is represented at the North Pole, and Cancer is
 divided, near its middle, at the South Pole; which is a confirmation
 that originally they had their winter when the Sun was in Cancer;
 but the chief characteristics of its being a monument commemorating
 the <em>first</em> <em>time </em>that the Pole had been in that
 position, are the Lion and the Virgin." (See in Part <strong>II</strong>.,
 §"A Mystery of the Zodiac.")
 </p><p>
 Broadly calculated, it is believed by the Egyptologists that the
 great Pyramid was built 3,350 <b>B.C.</b> (<em>See Proctor, Knowledge,
 Vol. I. pp</em>. 242, 400); and that Menes and his Dynasty existed
 7 50 years before the Fourth

 <p>
 Dynasty (supposed to have built the Pyramids) had appeared ("<em>The
 Great Pyramid," Staniland Wake</em>). Thus 4,100 years <strong>B.C.
 </strong>is the age assigned to Menes. Now Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson's
 declaration that <em>"all the facts lead to the conclusion
 </em>that the Egyptians had already made very great progress in
 the arts of civilization <em>before the age of Menes,</em> <em>and
 perhaps before they immigrated into the valley of the Nile"
 </em>(<em>Rawlinson's "Herodotus," vol. ii. p. </em>345)
 is very suggestive, as destroying this hypothesis. It points to
 great civilization in <em>prehistoric </em>times, and a still
 greater antiquity. The <em>Schesoo-Hor </em>("the servants
 of Horus") were the people who had settled in Egypt; and,
 as M. G. Maspero affirms, it is to this <em>prehistoric </em>race
 that "belongs the honour . . . of having founded the principal
 cities of Egypt, and established the most important sanctuaries."
 This was <em>before </em>the great Pyramid epoch, and when Egypt
 had hardly arisen from the waters. Yet "they possessed the
 hieroglyphic form of writing special to the Egyptians, and must
 have been already considerably advanced in civilization."
 It was, says Lenormant, "the country of the great prehistoric
 sanctuaries, seats of the sacerdotal dominion, which played the
 most important part in the origin of civilization." What
 is the date assigned to this people? We hear of 4,000, at the
 utmost of 5,000 years <strong>B.C.</strong> (Maspero). Now it
 is claimed that it is by means of the cycle of 25,868 years (the
 Sidereal year) that the approximate year of the erection of the
 Great Pyramid can be ascertained. "Assuming that the long
 narrow downward passage was directed towards the pole star of
 the pyramid builders, astronomers have shown that . . . . Alpha
 Draconis, the then pole-star, was in the required position about
 3,350<strong> B.C.</strong>, as well as in 2,170 <strong>B.C.</strong>
 (Proctor, quoted by Staniland Wake.) But we are also told that
 "this relative position of Alpha Draconis and Alcyone being
 an extraordinary one . . it could not occur again for a whole
 sidereal year" (<em>ibid</em>)<em>. </em>This demonstrates
 that, since the Dendera Zodiac shows the passage of three sidereal
 years, the great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago,
 or in any case that this possibility deserves to be accepted at
 least as readily as the later date of 3,350 <strong>B.C.</strong>
 
 </p><p>
 Now on the Zodiac of a certain temple in far Northern India, as
 on the Dendera Zodiac, the same characteristics of the signs are
 found. Those who know well the Hindu symbols and constellations,
 will be able to find out by the description of the Egyptian, whether
 the indications of the chronological time are correct or not.
 On the Dendera Zodiac as preserved by the modern Egyptian Coptic
 and Greek adepts, and explained a little differently by Mackey,
 the Lion stands upon the <em>Hydra</em> and his tail is almost
 straight, pointing downwards at an angle of forty or fifty degrees,
 this position agreeing with the<em> original </em>conformation
 of these constellations. "But in many places we see the Lion
 (<em>Simha</em>)," </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 433 THEORIES OF A SELF-MADE ADEPT. </h6>
 
 <p>
 Mackey adds, "with his tail turned up over his back, and
 ending with a Serpent's head; thereby showing that the Lion had
 been <em>'inverted';</em> which, indeed, must have been the case
 with the whole Zodiac and every other Constellation, when the
 Pole had been inverted."
 </p><p>
 Speaking of the <em>Circular </em>Zodiac, given also by Denon,
 he says: -- There, "the Lion is standing <em>on </em>the
 Serpent, and his tail forming a curve downward, from which it
 is found that <em>though six or seven hundred</em> <em>thousand
 years </em>must have passed between the two positions, yet they
 had made but little difference between in the constellations of
 Leo and the Hydra; while <em>Virgo </em>is represented very differently
 in the two. In the <em>circular </em>Zodiac, the <em>Virgin is
 nursing her child; </em>but it seems that they had not had that
 idea when the pole was first within the plane of the Ecliptic;
 for in <em>this </em>Zodiac, as given by Denon, we see <em>three
 Virgins</em> between the Lion and the Scales, <em>the last of
 which holds in her hand </em>an ear of wheat. It is much to be
 lamented that there is in this Zodiac a breach of the figure in
 the latter part of Leo and the <em>beginning of Virgo</em> which
 has taken away one <em>Decan </em>out of each sign."
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, the meaning is plain, as the three Zodiacs belong
 to three different epochs: namely, to the last three family races
 of the fourth Sub-race of the Fifth Root-race, each of which must
 have lived approximately from 25 to 30,000 years. The first of
 these (the "Aryan-Asiatics") witnessed the doom of the
 last of the populations of the "giant Atlanteans"* who
 perished some 850,000 years ago (the Ruta and Daitya Island-Continents)
 toward the close of the Miocene Age.** The fourth sub-race witnessed
 the destruction of the last remnant of the Atlanteans -- the Aryo-Atlanteans
 in the last island of Atlantis, namely, some 11,000 years ago.
 In order to understand this the reader
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * The term "Atlantean" must not mislead the reader to
 regard these as one race only, or even a nation. It is as though
 one said "Asiatics." Many, multityped, and various were
 the Atlanteans, who represented several <em>humanities, </em>and
 almost a countless number of races and nations, more varied indeed
 than would be the "Europeans" were this name to be given
 indiscriminately to the five existing parts of the world; which,
 at the rate colonization is proceeding, will be the case, perhaps,
 in less than two or three hundred years. There were brown, red,
 yellow, white and black Atlanteans; giants and dwarfs (as some
 African tribes comparatively are, even now).
 </p><p>
 ** Says a teacher in "Esoteric Buddhism," on p. 64:
 "In the Eocene age, even in its very first part, the great
 cycle of the fourth race men the (Lemuro) Atlanteans had already
 reached its highest point (of civilization), and the great continent,
 the father of nearly all the present continents, showed the first
 symptoms of sinking. . . ." And on page 70, it is shown that
 Atlantis as a whole perished during the Miocene period. To show
 how the continents, races, nations and cycles overlap each other,
 one has but to think of Lemuria, the last of whose lands perished
 about 700,000 years before the beginning of the Tertiary period
 (see p. 65 of the same work), and the last of "Atlantis"
 only 11,000 years ago; thus both overlapping -- one the Atlantean
 period, and the other the Aryan.</p><hr>

 is asked to glance at the diagram of the genealogical tree of
 the Fifth Root-Race -- generally, though hardly correctly, called
 the Aryan race, and the explanations appended to it.
 </p><p>
 Let the reader remember well that which is said of the divisions
 of Root Races and the evolution of Humanity in this work, and
 stated clearly and concisely in Mr. Sinnett's "Esoteric Buddhism."
 </p><p>
 1. There are seven <strong>R</strong>OUNDS in every manvantara;
 this one is the Fourth, and we are in the Fifth Root-Race, at
 present.
 </p><p>
 2. Each Root-Race has seven sub-races.
 </p><p>
 3. Each sub-race has, in its turn, seven ramifications, which
 may be called Branch or "Family" races.
 </p><p>
 4. The little tribes, shoots, and offshoots of the last-named
 are countless and depend on Karmic action. Examine the "genealogical
 tree" hereto appended, and you will understand. The illustration
 is purely diagrammatic, and is only intended to assist the reader
 in obtaining a slight grasp of the subject, amidst the confusion
 which exists between the terms which have been used at different
 times for the divisions of Humanity. It is also here attempted
 to express in figures -- but only within approximate limits, for
 the sake of comparison -- the duration of time through which it
 is possible to definitely distinguish one division from another.
 It would only lead to hopeless confusion if any attempt were made
 to give accurate dates to a few; for the Races, Sub-Races, etc.,
 etc., down to their smallest ramifications, overlap and are entangled
 with each other until it is nearly impossible to separate them.
 </p><p>
 The human Race has been compared to a tree, and this serves admirably
 as an illustration.
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-434.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 The main stem of a tree may be compared to the ROOT-RACE (A).
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 435 ILLUSTRATION OF THE RACES.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Its larger limbs to the various SUB-RACES; seven in number (B1,
 B2).
 </p><p>
 On each of these limbs are seven BRANCHES, OR FAMILY-RACES. (C).
 </p><p>
 After this the cactus-plant is a better illustration, for its
 fleshy "leaves" are covered with sharp spines, each
 of which may be compared to a nation or tribe of human beings.
 </p><p>
 Now our Fifth Root-Race has already been in existence -- as a
 race <em>sui generis </em>and quite free from its parent stem
 -- about 1,000,000 years; therefore it must be inferred that each
 of the four preceding Sub-Races has lived approximately 210,000
 years; thus each Family-Race has an average existence of about
 30,000 years. Thus the European "Family Race" has still
 a good many thousand years to run, although the nations or the
 innumerable spines upon it, vary with each succeeding "season"
 of three or four thousand years. It is somewhat curious to mark
 the comparative approximation of duration between the lives of
 a "Family-Race" and a "Sidereal year."
 </p><p>
 The knowledge of the foregoing, and the accurately correct division,
 formed part and parcel of the Mysteries, where these Sciences
 were taught to the disciples, and where they were transmitted
 by one hierophant to another. Everyone is aware that the European
 astronomers assign (arbitrarily enough) the date of the invention
 of the Egyptian Zodiac to the years 2000 or 2400 <strong>B.C.
 </strong>(<em>Proctor</em>);<em> </em>and insist that this invention
 coincides in its date with that of the erection of the Great Pyramid.
 This, to an Occultist and Eastern astronomer, must appear quite
 absurd. The year of the <em>Kaliyuga </em>is said to have begun
 between the 17th and 18th of February in the year 3102 <strong>B.C.</strong>
 Now the Hindus claim that in the year 20400 before Kaliyugam,
 the origin of their Zodiac coincided with the spring equinox --
 there being at the time a conjunction of the Sun and Moon -- and
 Bailly proved by a lengthy and careful computation of that date,
 that, even if fictitious, the epoch from which they had started
 to establish the beginning of their Kaliyug was <em>very real.
 </em>That "epoch is the year 3102 before our era," he
 writes. (<em>See Part III., Book I. </em>"<em>Hindu Astronomy
 defended by an Academician".</em>)<em> </em>The lunar eclipse
 arriving just a fortnight after the beginning of the black Age
 -- it took place in a point situated between the Wheat Ear of
 Virgo and the star [[<em>theta</em>]] of the same constellation.
 One of their most esoteric Cycles is based upon certain conjunctions
 and respective positions of Virgo and the Pleiades <em>-- </em>(<em>Krittika</em>)<em>.
 </em>Hence, as the Egyptians brought their Zodiac from Southern
 India and Lanka,* the esoteric meaning was evidently identical.
 The three "Virgins," or Virgo in three different positions,
 meant, with both, the record of the first three "divine or
 astronomical Dynasties," who taught the Third

 <p>
 Root-Race; and after having abandoned the Atlanteans to their
 doom, returned (or redescended, rather) during the third Sub-Race
 of the Fifth, in order to reveal to saved humanity the mysteries
 of their birth-place -- the sidereal Heavens. The same symbolical
 record of the human races and the three Dynasties (Gods, Manes
 -- semi-divine astrals of the Third and Fourth, and the "Heroes"
 of the Fifth Race), which preceded the purely human kings, was
 found in the distribution of the tiers and passages of the Egyptian
 Labyrinth. As the three inversions of the Poles of course changed
 the face of the Zodiac, a new one had to be constructed each time.
 In Mackey's "Sphinxiad" the speculations of the bold
 author must have horrified the orthodox portion of the population
 of Norwich, as he says, fantastically enough: --
 </p><p>
 "But, after all, the greatest length of time recorded by
 those monuments (the Labyrinth, the Pyramids and the Zodiacs)
 <em>does not exceed</em> <em>five millions of years </em>(which
 is not so)*; which falls short of the records given us both by
 the (esoteric) Chinese and Hindus; which latter nation has registered
 a knowledge of time for seven or eight millions of years**; which
 I have seen upon a talisman of porcelain. . . . "
 </p><p>
 The Egyptian priests had the Zodiacs of the Atlantean Asura-Maya,
 as the modern Hindus still have. As stated in "<em>Esoteric
 Buddhism,</em>" the Egyptians, as well as the Greeks and
 "Romans" some thousand years ago, were "remnants
 of the Atlanto-Aryans," <em>i.e.</em>, the former, of the
 older, or the Ruta Atlanteans; the last-named, the descendants
 of the last race of that island, whose sudden disappearance was
 narrated to Solon by the Egyptian Initiates. The <em>human </em>Dynasty
 of the older Egyptians, beginning with Menes, had all the <em>knowledge
 </em>of the Atlanteans, though there was no more Atlantean blood
 in their veins. Nevertheless, they had preserved all their Archaic
 records. All this has been shown long ago.*** And it is just because
 the Egyptian Zodiac is between 75 and 80,000 years old that the
 Zodiac of the Greeks is far later. Volney has correctly pointed
 out in his "Ruins of Empires" (p. 360) that it is only
 16,984 years old, or up to the present date 17,082.****
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The forefathers of the Aryan Brahmins had their Zodiacal calculations
 and Zodiac from those born by Kriyasakti power, the "Sons
 of Yoga"; the Egyptians from the Atlanteans of Ruta.
 </p><p>
 ** The former, therefore, may have registered time for seven or
 eight millions of years, but the Egyptians <em>could not.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 *** This question was amply challenged, and as amply discussed
 and answered. See <em>Five Years of Theosophy.</em> (<em>Art.
 "Mr. Sinnett's Esoteric Buddhism," pp. </em>325-46).
 </p><p>
 **** Volney says that, as <em>Aries </em>was in its 15th degree
 1447 <strong>B.C</strong>., it follows that the first degree of
 "Libra" could not have coincided with the vernal equinox
 more lately than 15,194 years <strong>B.C.</strong>, to which
 if you add 1790 since Christ, when Volney wrote this, it appears
 that 16,984 years have elapsed since the (Greek or rather Hellenic)
 origin of the Zodiac.</p><hr>
