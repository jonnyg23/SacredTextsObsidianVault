 ON THE HIDDEN DEITY, ITS SYMBOLS AND GLYPHS.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>T</strong>HE Logos or Creative deity, the "Word made
 Flesh," of every religion, has to be traced to its ultimate
 source and Essence. In India, it is a Proteus of 1,008 divine
 names and aspects in each of its <em>personal </em>transformations,
 from Brahma-Purusha down through the Seven <em>divine </em>Rishis
 and ten <em>semi</em>-divine Prajapati (also Rishis) to the <em>divine-human
 </em>Avatars. The same puzzling problem of the "One in many"
 and the multitude in One, is found in other Pantheons, in the
 Egyptian, the Greek and the Chaldeo-Judaic, the latter having
 made confusion still more confused by presenting its Gods as euhemerizations,
 in the shapes of Patriarchs. The latter are now accepted by those
 who reject Romulus as a myth, and are represented as living and
 <em>historical </em>Entities<em>. Verbum satis sapienti.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 In the Zohar, En-Soph is also the <strong>O</strong>NE, and the
 infinite Unity. This was known to the very few learned Fathers
 of the Church, who were aware that Jehovah was but a <em>third
 rate </em>potency and no "highest" God. But while complaining
 bitterly of the Gnostics and saying . . . "our Heretics hold
 . . . that <strong>P</strong>ROPATOR is known but to the <em>Only
 begotten </em>Son* (who is Brahma among the rest) that is to the
 mind" (<em>nous</em>),<em> </em>Irenaeus never mentioned
 that the Jews did the same in their real <em>secret </em>books.
 Valentinus, "the profoundest doctor of the Gnosis,"
 held that "there was a perfect AION who existed before Bythos,
 or Buthon (the first father of unfathomable nature, which is the
 second Logos) called Propator." It is thus <strong>A</strong>ION,
 who springs as a Ray from Ain-Soph (who <em>does not create</em>),<em>
 </em>and <strong>A</strong>ION, who creates, or <em>through </em>whom,
 rather, everything is created, or evolves.

 * As Mulaprakriti is known only to Iswar, the <b>L</b>OGOS, as
 he is called now by Mr. T. Subba Row, of Madras. (See his <em>Bhagavadgita
 </em>Lectures.)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 350 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 For, as the Basilidians taught, "there was a supreme god,
 <em>Abraxas</em>,<em> </em>by<em> </em>whom was created mind"
 (<em>Mahat</em>,<em> </em>in Sanskrit, <em>Nous </em>in Greek).
 "From Mind proceeded the word, <em>Logos</em>,<em> </em>from
 the word, Providence (Divine Light, rather), then from it Virtue
 and Wisdom in Principalities, Powers, Angels, etc., etc."
 By these (Angels) the 365 AEons were created. "Amongst the
 lowest, indeed, and those who made this world, he (Basilides)
 sets last of all the God of the Jews, whom he denies to be God
 (and very rightly), affirming he is one of the angels" (<em>Ibid.</em>)<em>.
 </em>Here, then, we find the same system as in the Puranas, wherein
 the Incomprehensible drops a seed, which becomes the golden egg,
 from which Brahma is produced. Brahma produces Mahat, etc., etc.
 True Esoteric philosophy, however, speaks neither of "creation"
 nor of "evolution" in the sense the exoteric religions
 do. All these personified Powers are not evolutions from one another,
 but so many aspects of the one and sole manifestation of the <strong>A</strong>BSOLUTE
 all. The same system as the gnostic prevails in the Sephirothal
 aspects of Ain-Soph, yet, as <em>these aspects are in Space and
 Time</em>,<em> </em>a certain order is maintained in their successive
 appearances. Therefore, it becomes impossible not to take notice
 of the great changes that the <em>Zohar </em>has undergone under
 the handling of generations of Christian Mystics. For, even in
 the metaphysics of the Talmud, the "lower Face" (or
 "Lesser Countenance"), the microprosopus, in fact, could
 never be placed on the plane of the same abstract ideal as the
 Higher, or "Greater Countenance," macroprosopus. The
 latter is, in the Chaldean Kabala, a pure abstraction; the Word
 or <strong>L</strong>OGOS, or <strong>D</strong>ABAR (in Hebrew),
 which Word, though it becomes in fact a plural number, or "Words"
 -- <strong>D</strong>(a)<strong>B</strong>(a)<strong>R</strong>IM,
 when it reflects itself, or falls into the aspect of a Host (of
 angels, or Sephiroth, "numbers") is still collectively
 <strong>O</strong>NE, and on the ideal plane a nought -- 0, a
 "No-thing." <strong>I</strong>T is without form or being,
 "with no likeness with anything else." (<em>Franck</em>,<em>
 </em>"<em>Die Kabbala</em>,"<em> p. </em>126.) And even
 Philo calls the Creator, the<em> Logos </em>who stands next God,
 "<em>the </em><strong>S</strong>ECOND <strong>G</strong>OD,"
 and "the second God who is his (Highest God's) <strong>W</strong>ISDOM"
 (<em>Philo. Quaest. et Solut</em>)<em>. </em>Deity is not God.
 It is NOTHING, and DARKNESS. It is nameless, and therefore called
 <em>Ain-Soph</em> --<em> </em>"the<em> </em>word<em> Ayin</em>
 meaning nothing." <em>See Franck </em>"<em>Die Kabbala</em>,"<em>
 p. </em>153. <em> See also Section XII.</em>,<em> </em>"<em>Theogony
 of the Creative Gods.</em>"<em> </em>The "Highest God"
 (the unmanifested <strong>L</strong>OGOS) is its Son.
 </p><p>
 Nor are most of the gnostic systems, which come down to us mutilated
 by the Church Fathers, anything better than the distorted shells
 of the original speculations. Nor were they <em>open </em>to the
 public or reader, at any time; <em>i.e.</em>, had their hidden
 meaning or esotericism been revealed, it would have been no more
 an esoteric teaching, and this could never be. Alone Marcus (the
 chief of the Marcosians, 2nd century), who taught</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 351 THE GNOSTIC IDEA.</h6>
 
 <p>
 that deity had to be viewed under the symbol of <em>four syllables</em>,<em>
 </em>gave out more of the esoteric truths than any other Gnostic.
 But even he was never well understood. For it is only on the surface
 or dead letter of his<em> Revelation </em>that it appears that
 God is a quaternary, to wit: "the Ineffable, the Silence,
 the Father, and Truth," -- in reality it is quite erroneous,
 and divulges only one more esoteric riddle. This teaching of Marcus
 was that of the early Kabalists and ours. For he makes of Deity,
 the number 30 <em>in </em>4 <em>syllables</em>,<em> </em>which,
 translated esoterically, means a Triad or <em>Triangle</em>,<em>
 </em>and a Quaternary or a square, in all <em>seven</em>,<em>
 </em>which, on the lower plane made the seven divine or secret
 letters of which the God-name is composed. This requires demonstration.
 In his "Revelation," speaking of divine mysteries expressed
 by means of letters and numbers, Marcus narrates how the "Supreme
 Tetrad came down unto me (him) from the region which cannot be
 seen nor named, <em>in a female form</em>,<em> because the world
 would have been unable to bear her appearing under a male figure</em>,"<em>
 </em>and revealed to him "the generation of the universe,
 <em>untold before to either </em>gods or men."
 </p><p>
 This first sentence already contains a double meaning. Why should
 a female figure be more easily borne or listened to by the world
 than a male figure? On the very face of it this appears nonsensical.
 Withal it is quite simple and clear to one who is acquainted with
 the mystery-language. <em>Esoteric Philosophy</em>,<em> </em>or
 the Secret Wisdom, was symbolized by a female form, while a male
 figure stood for the <em>Unveiled </em>mystery. Hence, the world
 not being ready to receive, could not bear it, and the Revelation
 of Marcus had to be given allegorically. Then he writes:
 </p><p>
 "When first the Inconceivable, the Beingless and Sexless
 (the Kabalistic Ain-Soph) began to be in labour (<em>i.e.</em>,
 when the hour of manifesting Itself had struck) and desired that
 Its Ineffable should be born (the first <strong>L</strong>OGOS,
 or AEon, or Aion), and its invisible should be clothed with form,
 its mouth opened and uttered the word like unto itself. This word
 (logos) manifested itself in the form of the Invisible One. The
 uttering of the (ineffable) name (through the word) came to pass
 in this manner. He (the Supreme Logos) uttered the first word
 of his name, which is a <em>syllable of four letters. </em>Then
 the second syllable was added, <em>also of four letters. </em>Then
 the third, composed of <em>ten </em>letters; and after this the
 fourth, which contains <em>twelve</em> letters. The whole name
 consists thus of <em>thirty letters </em>and of <em>four syllables.
 </em>Each letter has its own accent and way of writing, but neither
 understands nor ever beholds that form of the whole Name, -- no;
 not even the power of the letter that stands next to Itself (to
 the Beingless and the Inconceivable.)* All these sounds when united
 are the collective Beingless,

 * Iswara, or the Logos, cannot see Parabrahmam, but only Mulaprakriti,
 says the lecturer, in the Four Lectures on Bhagavatgita. (See<em>
 Theosophist</em>,<em> </em>Feb., 1887.)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 352 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 unbegotten AEon, and <em>these </em>are the Angels that are ever
 beholding the face of the Father* (the Logos, the "second
 God," who stands next God, "the Inconceivable,"
 according to Philo).
 </p><p>
 This is as plain as ancient esoteric secrecy would make it. It
 is as Kabalistic, but less veiled than the Zohar in which the
 mystic names or attributes are also four syllabled, twelve, forty-two,
 and even seventy-two syllabled words! The <em>Tetrad </em>shows
 to Marcus the TRUTH in the shape of a naked woman, and letters
 every limb of that figure, calling her head [[omega]], her neck
 [[psi]], shoulders and hands [[gamma]], and [[chi]], etc., etc.
 In this Sephira is easily recognised, the Crown (<em>Kether</em>)<em>
 </em>or head being numbered <em>one</em>; the brain or Chochmah,
 2; the heart, or Intelligence (Binah), 3; and the other seven
 Sephiroth representing the limbs of the body. The Sephirothal
 Tree is the Universe, and Adam Kadmon represents it in the West
 as Brahma represents it in India.
 </p><p>
 Throughout, the 10 Sephiroth are represented as divided into the
 three higher, or the spiritual <em>Triad</em>,<em> </em>and the
 lower Septenary. The true Esoteric meaning of the sacred number
 seven is cleverly veiled in the <em>Zohar; </em>yet was betrayed
 by the double way of writing "in the beginning" or <em>Be-resheeth</em>,<em>
 </em>and Be-raishath, the latter the "Higher, or <em>Upper
 </em>Wisdom." As shown by Mr. Macgregor Mathers in his <em>Kabbalah
 </em>(p. 47), and in the <em>Qabbalah </em>of Mr. T. Myer (p.
 233), both of these Kabalists being supported by the best ancient
 authorities, these words have a dual and secret meaning. <em>Braisheeth
 bara Elohim </em>means that the <em>six</em>,<em> </em>over which
 stands the <em>seventh </em>Sephiroth, belong to the lower material
 class, or, as the author says: "Seven . . . . are applied
 to the Lower Creation, and three to the spiritual man, the Heavenly
 Prototypic or first Adam."
 </p><p>
 When the Theosophists and Occultists say that God is no <strong>B</strong>EING,
 for <strong>I</strong>T is nothing, <em>No-Thing</em>,<em> </em>they
 are more reverential and religiously respectful to the Deity than
 those who call God a <strong>H</strong>E, and thus make of Him
 a gigantic <strong>M</strong>ALE.
 </p><p>
 He who studies the Kabala will soon find the same idea in the
 ultimate thought of its authors, the earlier and great Hebrew
 Initiates, who got this secret Wisdom at Babylonia from the Chaldean
 Hierophants, while Moses got his in Egypt. The Zohar cannot well
 be judged by its after translations in Latin and other tongues,
 as all those ideas were, of course, softened and made to fit in
 with the views and <em>policy </em>of its Christian arrangers;
 but in truth its ideas are identical with those of all other religious
 systems. The various Cosmogonies show that the Archaic Universal
 Soul was held by every nation as the "Mind" of the Demiurgic
 Creator; and that it

 <p>
 was called the "Mother," <em>Sophia </em>with the Gnostics
 (or the female Wisdom), the <em>Sephira </em>with the Jews, Saraswati
 or Vach, with the Hindus, <em>the Holy Ghost being a female Principle.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Hence, born from it, the <em>Kurios </em>or Logos was, with the
 Greeks, the "God, mind" (<em>nous</em>)<em>. </em>"Now
 Koros (<em>Kurios</em>)<em> </em>signifies the pure and unmixed
 nature of intellect -- wisdom," says Plato in "Cratylus";
 and Kurios is Mercury, the Divine Wisdom, and "mercury is
 the Sol" (Sun) ("<em>Arnobius</em>"<em> </em>vi.,
 xii.), from whom Thot-Hermes received this divine Wisdom. While,
 then, the <em>Logoi </em>of all countries and religions are correlative
 (in their sexual aspects) with the female Soul of the World or
 the "Great Deep;" the deity, from which these <em>two
 in one </em>have their being, is ever concealed and called the
 "Hidden One," connected only indirectly with Creation,*
 as it can act only through the Dual Force emanating from the Eternal
 Essence. Even AEsculapius, called the "Saviour of all,"
 is identical, according to ancient classics, with <em>Phta</em>,<em>
 </em>the Egyptian Creative Intellect (or Divine Wisdom), and with
 Apollo, Baal, Adonis and Hercules (<em>see Dunlap</em>'<em>s </em>"<em>Mystery
 of Adonis</em>,"<em> pp. </em>23<em> and </em>95); and Phta
 is, in one of its aspects, the "Anima Mundi," the Universal
 Soul of Plato, the "Divine Spirit" of the Egyptians,
 the "Holy Ghost" of the early Christians and Gnostics,
 and the <em>Akasa </em>of the Hindus, and even, in its lower aspect,
 the <em>Astral Light. </em>For <em>Phta </em>was originally the
 "God of the Dead," he in whose bosom they were received,
 hence the <em>Limbus </em>of<em> </em>the Greek Christians, or
 the Astral Light. It is far later that <em>Phta </em>was classed
 with the Sun-gods, his name signifying "he who opens,"
 as he is shown to be the first to unveil the face of the dead
 mummy, to call the soul to <em>life in his bosom. </em>(See<em>
 Maspero</em>'<em>s </em>"<em>Bulaq Museum.</em>")<em>
 </em><b>K</b>NEPH, the Eternal <em>Unrevealed</em>,<em> </em>is
 represented by the snake-emblem of eternity encircling a water-urn,
 with its head hovering <em>over the </em>"<em>waters</em>"<em>
 which it incubates with its breath </em>-- another form of one
 and the same idea of "Darkness," its ray moving on the
 waters, &amp;c. As "Logos-Soul," this <em>permutation
 </em>is called Phta; as Logos-Creator, he becomes <em>Imhot-pou</em>,<em>
 </em>his son, "the god of the handsome face." In their
 primitive characters these two were the first Cosmic Duad, <em>Noot</em>,<em>
 </em>"space or <em>Sky</em>,"<em> </em>and<em> Noo</em>,<em>
 </em>"the primordial Waters," the Androgyne Unity, above
 whom was the <em>Concealed </em><strong>B</strong>REATH of Kneph.
 And all of them had the aquatic animals and plants sacred to them,
 the <em>ibis</em>,<em> </em>the <em>swan</em>,<em> </em>the<em>
 goose</em>,<em> </em>the<em> crocodile</em>,<em> </em>and the
 <em>lotus.</em>

 Returning to the Kabalistic deity, this Concealed Unity is then

 long as the <em>Absolute </em>is within <em>Oulom</em>,<em>* </em>the
 boundless and termless time, as such, En-Soph cannot be the Creator
 or even the modeller of the Universe, nor can he be <em>Aur </em>(light).
 Therefore En-Soph is also Darkness. The <em>immutably </em>Infinite
 and the <em>absolutely </em>Boundless can neither will, think,
 nor act. To do this it has to become finite, and it does so, by
 its ray penetrating into the mundane egg -- infinite space --
 and emanating from it as a finite god. All this is left to the
 ray latent in the one. When the period arrives, the absolute will
 expands naturally the force within it, according to the Law of
 which it is the inner and ultimate Essence. The Hebrews did not
 adopt the egg as a symbol, but they substituted for it the "Duplex
 heavens," for, translated correctly, the sentence "God
 made the heavens and the earth" would read: -- "In and
 out of his own essence as a womb (the mundane egg), God created
 the two heavens." But the Christians have chosen as the symbol
 of their Holy Ghost, the dove.
 </p><p>
 "Whosoever acquaints himself with <img src="sd1-354.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 the Mercaba and the <em>lahgash </em>(secret speech or incantation),
 will learn the secret of secrets." <em>Lahgash </em>is nearly
 identical in meaning with Vach, the hidden power of the Mantras.
 </p><p>
 When the active period has arrived, from within the eternal essence
 of Ain-Soph, comes forth Sephira, the active Power, called the
 Primordial Point, and the Crown, <em>Kether. </em>It is only through
 her that the "Un-bounded Wisdom" could give a concrete
 form to the abstract Thought. Two sides of the upper triangle
 by which the ineffable Essence and the universe -- its manifested
 body -- are symbolized, the right side and the base are composed
 of unbroken lines; the third, the left side, is dotted. It is
 through the latter that emerges Sephira. Spreading in every direction,
 she finally encompasses the whole triangle. In this emanation
 the triple triad is formed. From the invisible Dew falling from
 the higher <em>Uni-triad </em>(thus leaving 7 sephiroths only),
 the "Head" Sephira <em>creates </em>primeval waters,
 <em>i.e.</em>, Chaos takes shape. It is the first stage towards
 the solidification of spirit which through various modifications
 will produce earth. "<em>It requires earth and water to make
 a living soul</em>,"<em> </em>says Moses. It requires the
 image of an aquatic bird to connect it with water, the female
 element of procreation with the egg and the bird that fecundates
 it.
 </p><p>
 When Sephira emerges like an active power from within the latent
 Deity, she is female; when she assumes the office of a creator,
 she becomes a male; hence, she is androgyne. She is the "Father

 * With the ancient Jews, as shown by Le Clerc, the word <em>Oulom</em>
 meant only a time whose beginning or end is not known. The term
 "eternity," properly speaking, did not exist in the

 to Parabrahm.</p><hr>

 Mother Aditi," of the Hindu Cosmogony and of <em>the Secret
 Doctrine. </em>If the oldest Hebrew scrolls had been preserved,
 the modern Jehovah-worshipper would have found that many and uncomely
 were the symbols of the <em>creative </em>god. The frog in the
 moon, typical of his generative character, was the most frequent.
 All the birds and animals now held "unclean" in the
 Bible had been the symbols of the Deity in days of old. It was
 because they were too sacred that a mask of uncleanness was placed
 over them, in order to preserve them from destruction. The brazen
 serpent was not a bit more poetical than the goose or swan, if
 symbols are to be accepted <em>a la lettre.</em> 
 </p><p>
 In the words of the <em>Zohar: </em>"The Indivisible Point,
 which has no limit and cannot be comprehended because of its purity
 and brightness, expanded <em>from without</em>,<em> </em>forming
 a brightness that served the indivisible Point as a veil;"
 yet the latter also "<em>could not be viewed in </em>consequence
 of its immeasurable light. It too <em>expanded from without</em>,<em>
 </em>and this expansion was its garment. Thus through a constant
 <em>upheaving </em>(motion) finally the world originated"
 (<em>Zohar I. </em>20<em>a</em>)<em>. </em>The Spiritual substance
 sent forth by the Infinite Light is the <em>first </em>Sephira
 or <em>Shekinah: </em>Sephira<em> exoterically </em>contains all
 the other nine Sephiroths in her<em>. Esoterically </em>she contains
 but two,* <em>Chochmah </em>or<em> Wisdom</em>,<em> </em>"a<em>
 </em>masculine, <em>active</em> potency whose divine name is <em>Jah</em>
 (<img src="sd1-355a.gif" align="MIDDLE">)," and <strong>B</strong>INAH,
 a feminine passive potency, Intelligence, represented by the divine
 name Jehovah (<img src="sd1-355b.gif" align="MIDDLE">); which
 two potencies form, with Sephira the third, the Jewish trinity
 or the Crown, <strong>K</strong>ETHER. These two Sephiroths called
 Father, <em>Abba</em>,<em> </em>and Mother <em>Amona</em>,<em>
 </em>are the duad or the double-sexed <em>logos </em>from which
 issued the other seven Sephiroths. (See <em>Zohar.</em>)<em> </em>This<em>
 </em>first Jewish triad (Sephira, Chochmah, and Binah) is the
 Hindu <em>Trimurti.* </em>However veiled, even in the <em>Zohar</em>,<em>
 </em>and more still in the exoteric Pantheon of India, every particular
 connected with one is reproduced in the other. The <em>Prajapati
 </em>are the Sephiroths. Ten with Brahma they dwindle to seven,
 when the Trimurti, and the Kabalistic triad, are separated from
 the rest. The seven Builders (Creators) become the seven <em>Prajapati</em>,<em>
 </em>or the seven Rishis, in the same order as the Sephiroths
 become the Creators; then the Patriarchs, etc. In both Secret
 Systems, the One Universal Essence is incomprehensible and <em>inactive
 </em>in its absoluteness, and can be connected with the building
 of the Universe only in an indirect way. In both, the primeval
 Malefemale or androgynous Principle, and their ten and seven Emanations
 (Brahma-Viraj and Aditi-Vach on the one part and the Elohim-Jehovah,
 or Adam-Adami (Adam Kadmon) and Sephira Eve on the

 <p>
 other), with their Prajapati and Sephiroths, represent in their
 totality, first of all the Archetypal man, the <em>Proto-logos;
 </em>and only in their secondary aspect do they become Cosmic
 powers, and astronomical or sidereal bodies. If Aditi is the mother
 of the gods, <em>Deva-Matri</em>,<em> </em>Eve<em> </em>is the
 mother of all living; they are the <em>Sakti </em>or generative
 power in their female aspect of the "Heavenly man,"
 and they are all compound Creators. Says a "<em>Gupta Vidya</em>"<em>
 </em>Sutra: "In the beginning, a ray issuing from Paramarthika
 (<em>the one </em>and only true existence), it became manifested
 in Vyavaharika (conventional existence) which was used as a <em>Vahan
 </em>to descend into the Universal Mother, and to cause her to
 expand (swell, <em>brih</em>)<em>.</em>"<em> </em>And in
 the <em>Zohar </em>it is stated: "The Infinite Unity, formless
 and without similitude, after the form of the heavenly man was
 created, used it. The Unknown Light* (Darkness) used the <img src="sd1-356a.gif" align="MIDDLE">(heavenly
 form) as a chariot <img src="sd1-356b.gif" align="MIDDLE">through
 which to descend, and wished to be called by this form, which
 is the sacred name Jehovah."
 </p><p>
 As the Zohar says: "In the beginning was the Will of the
 King, prior to any other existence. . . . It (the Will) sketched
 the forms of all things that had been concealed but now came into
 view. And there went forth as a sealed secret from the head of
 Ain Soph, a nebulous spark of matter, without shape or form. .
 . . Life is drawn from below, and from above the source renews
 itself, the sea is always full and spreads its waters everywhere."
 Thus the deity is compared to a shoreless sea, to water which
 is "the fountain of life" (Zohar iii., 290). "The
 seventh palace, the fountain of life, is the first in the order
 from above" (ii. 261). Hence the Kabalistic tenet on the
 lips of the very Kabalistic Solomon, who says in Proverbs ix.,
 1: "Wisdom hath builded her house; it hath hewn out its <em>seven
 </em>pillars."
 </p><p>
 Whence then, all this identity of ideas, if there was no primeval
 <strong>U</strong>NIVERSAL Revelation? The few points shown are
 like a few straws in a hayrick, in comparison to that which will
 be shown as the work proceeds. If we turn to that most hazy of
 all Cosmogonies -- the Chinese, even there the same idea is found.
 <em>Tsi-tsai </em>(the Self-Existent) is the unknown Darkness,
 the root of the <em>Wuliang-sheu </em>(Boundless<em> </em>Age),
 Amitabhe, and Tien (heaven) come later on. The "great Extreme"
 of Confucius gives the same idea, his "straws" notwithstanding.
 The latter are a source of great amusement to the missionaries.

 brother Christians of other denominations, and yet one and all
 accept <em>a la lettre </em>their own <em>Genesis. </em>If we
 turn to Chaldea we find in it <em>Anu</em>,<em> </em>the concealed
 deity, the One, whose name, moreover, shows it to be of Sanskrit
 origin. <em>Anu</em>, which means in Sanskrit "atom,"
 aniyamsam aniyasam (smallest of the small), is a name of Parabrahm
 in the Vedantic philosophy; Parabrahm being described as smaller
 than the smallest atom, and greater than the greatest sphere or
 universe: "<em>Anagraniyam and Mahatorvavat.</em>"<em>
 </em>This is what George Smith gives as the first verses of the
 Akkadian <em>Genesis </em>as found in the Cuneiform Texts on the
 "<em>Lateras Coctiles.</em>"<em> </em>There also, we
 find <em>Anu </em>the passive deity or En-Soph, <em>Bel</em>,
 the Creator, the Spirit of God (Sephira) moving on the face of
 the waters, hence water itself, and <em>Hea</em>,<em> </em>the
 Universal Soul or wisdom of the three combined.

 The first eight verses read thus:

 1. When above, were not raised the heavens;<br>
 2<em>.</em> And below on the earth a plant had not grown up.<br>
 3. The abyss had not broken its boundaries.<br>
 4. The chaos (or water) Tiamat (the sea) was the producing mother
 of the whole of them. (This is the Cosmical Aditi and Sephira.)

 5. Those waters at the beginning were ordained but --<br>
 6. A tree had not grown, a flower had not unfolded.<br>
 7. When the gods had not sprung up, any one of them.<br>
 8. A plant had not grown, and order did not exist.

 The symbol chosen for the majestic ideal of the Universal Principle
 will seem little calculated to answer its sacred character. A
 goose, or even a swan, may appear unfit, no doubt, to represent
 the grandeur of the Spirit. Nevertheless, it must have had some
 deep occult meaning, since it figures not only in every cosmogony
 and world religion, but even was chosen by the mediaeval Christians,
 the Crusaders, as the<em> vehicle </em>of the Holy Ghost supposed
 to lead the army to Palestine, to wrench the Tomb of the Saviour
 from the hands of the Saracen. If we are to credit Professor Draper's
 statement in his "Intellectual Development of Europe,"
 the Crusaders, led on by Peter the Hermit, were preceded, at the
 head of the army, by the Holy Ghost under the shape of a white
 gander in company of a goat. The Egyptian God of Time, Seb, carries
 a goose on his head. Jupiter assumes the form of a swan and Brahma
 also, because the root of all this is that mystery of mysteries
 -- the <strong>M</strong>UNDANE <strong>E</strong>GG. (See preceding
 ยง).

 Mansarovara, are in the popular fancy the Seven Rishis of the
 Great Bear, who assume that form to visit the locality where the
 Vedas were written.</p><hr>

 One has to learn the reason of a symbol before one depreciates
 it. The dual element of Air and Water is that of the ibis, swan,
 goose and pelican, of crocodiles and frogs, lotus flowers and
 water lilies, &amp;c.; and the result is the choice of the most
 unseemly symbols among the modern as much as the ancient mystics.
 Pan, the great god of nature, was generally figured in connection
 with aquatic birds, geese especially, and so were other gods.
 If, later on, with the gradual degeneration of religion, the gods
 to whom geese were sacred, became Priapic deities, it does not
 stand to reason that water fowls were made sacred to Pan and other
 Phallic deities as some scoffers even of antiquity would have
 it (<em>see Petronii Satyrica</em>,<em> </em>cxxxvi.); but that
 the abstract and divine power of procreative nature had become
 grossly anthropomorphized. Nor does the Swan of Leda show "Priapic
 doings and her enjoyment thereof," as Mr. Hargrave Jennings
 chastely expresses it -- for the myth is but another version of
 the same philosophical idea of cosmogony. Swans are frequently
 found associated with Apollo, as they are the emblems of water
 and fire (sun-light also), before the separation of the Elements.

 Our modern symbologists might profit by some remarks made by a
 well-known writer, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child. "From time immemorial
 an emblem has been worshipped in Hindostan as the type of creation,
 or the origin of life. . . . Siva or the Mahadeva being not only
 the reproducer of human forms, but also the fructifying principle,
 the generative power that pervades the Universe. The maternal
 emblem is likewise a religious type. This reverence for the production
 of life, introduced into the worship of Osiris the sexual emblems.
 Is it strange that they regarded with reverence the great mystery
 of human birth? Were they impure thus to regard it? Or are <em>we</em>
 impure that do not so regard it? But <em>no clean and thoughtful
 mind </em>could so regard them. . . . We have travelled far, and
 unclean have been the paths, since those old Anchorites first
 spoke of God and the soul in the solemn depths of their first
 sanctuaries. Let us not smile at their mode of tracing the infinite
 and the incomprehensible Cause throughout all the mysteries of
 nature, lest by so doing we cast the shadow of our own grossness
 on their patriarchal simplicity." ("<em>Progress of
 Religious Ideas</em>,"<em> Vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>17,<em>
 et seq.</em>)
