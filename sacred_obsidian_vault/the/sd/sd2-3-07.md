 <b>W</b>HEN statements such as are comprised in the above heading
 are brought forward, the writer is, of course, expected to furnish
 <i>historical </i>instead of <i>legendary </i>evidence in support
 of such claims. Is this possible? Yes; for evidence of this nature
 is plentiful, and has simply to be collected and brought together
 to become overwhelming in the eyes of the unprejudiced.
 </p><p>
 Once the sagacious student gets hold of the guiding thread he
 may find it out for himself. We give <i>facts </i>and show land-marks:
 let the wayfarer follow them. <i>What is given here is amply sufficient
 for </i>THIS<i> Century.</i> 
 </p><p>
 In a letter to Voltaire, Bailly finds it quite natural that the
 sympathies of the "grand old invalid of Ferney" should
 be attracted to the "representatives of knowledge and wisdom,
 the Brahmans of India." He then adds a curious statement.
 "But," he says, "your Brahmans are very young in
 comparison with their ancient instructors."*
 </p><p>
 Bailly, who knew nought of the esoteric teachings, nor of Lemuria,
 believed, nevertheless, unreservedly in the lost Atlantis, and
 also in several pre-historic and civilized nations which had disappeared
 without leaving any undeniable trace. He had studied the ancient
 classics and <i>traditions </i>extensively, and he saw that the
 arts and sciences known to those we now call the "ancients,"
 were "not the achievements of any of<i> the now or even then
 existing </i>nations, nor of any of the historical peoples of
 Asia." And that, notwithstanding the learning of the Hindoos,
 their undeniable priority in the antiquity of their race had to
 be referred to a people or a race still more ancient and more
 learned than were even the Brahmans themselves.**
 </p><p>
 Voltaire, the greatest sceptic of his day, the materialist <i>par
 excellence, </i>shared Bailly's belief. He thought it quite <i>likely
 </i>"<i>that long before the empires of China and India,
 there had been nations cultured, learned, and powerful, which
 a deluge of barbarians overpowered and thus replunged into their
 primitive state of ignorance and savagery, or what they call the
 state of pure nature.</i>"<i> </i>("<i>Lettres sur l</i>'<i>Atlantide,</i>"<i>

 *** This conjecture is but a half-guess. There were such "deluges
 of barbarians" in the Fifth Race. With regard to the Fourth,
 it was a <i>bond fide </i>deluge of water which swept it away.
 Neither Voltaire nor Bailly, however, knew anything of the Secret
 Doctrine of the East.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 743 A MYSTERIOUS NATION.</h6>
 
 <p>
 That which with Voltaire was the shrewd conjecture of a great
 intellect, was with Bailly "a question of historical facts."
 For "I make <i>great case of ancient traditions </i>preserved
 through a long series of generations," he wrote. (<i>Ibid.</i>)
 It<i> was </i>possible, he thought, that a<i> foreign </i>nation
 should, after instructing another nation, so disappear that it
 should leave no traces behind. When asked how it could have happened
 that this ancient, or rather archaic, nation should not have left
 at least some recollection in the human mind, he answered that
 Time was a pitiless devourer of facts and events. But, the history
 of the Past was never entirely lost, for the Sages of old Egypt
 had preserved it, and "it is so preserved to this day elsewhere."
 "You do not know which was the best and most handsome generation
 of men which has ever lived on this earth," said the priests
 of Sais to Solon, according to Plato. "Only a weak seed of
 it, of which you (Greeks) are the descendants,* is all that remains."
 "Their books," they added, "preserved the records
 of a great nation, which emerging from the Atlantic sea had invaded
 Europe and Asia (<i>Timaeus</i>)<i>. </i>The Greeks were but the
 dwarfed and weak remnant of that once glorious nation. . . ."**
 </p><p>
 What was this nation? The secret doctrine teaches that it was
 the latest, seventh sub-race of the Atlanteans, already swallowed
 up in one of the early sub-races of the Aryan stock, one that
 had been gradually spreading over the continent and islands of
 Europe, as soon as they had begun to emerge from the seas. Descending
 from the high plateaux of Asia, where the two Races had sought
 refuge in the days of the agony of Atlantis, it had been slowly
 settling and colonizing the freshly emerged lands. The emigrant
 sub-race had rapidly increased and multiplied on that virgin soil;
 had divided into many families, which in their turn divided into
 nations. Egypt and Greece, the Phoenicians, and the Northern stocks,
 had thus proceeded from that one sub-race. Thousands of years
 later, other races -- the remnants of the Atlanteans -- "yellow
 and red, brown and black," began to invade the new continent.
 There were wars in which the new comers were defeated; and they
 fled, some to Africa, others to remote countries. Some of these
 lands became in course of time -- owing to new geological convulsions
 -- islands. Being thus forcibly

 * For a full discussion of the relations between the <i>old</i>
 Greeks and Romans, and the Atlantean colonists, cf. "Five
 Years of Theosophy."
 </p><p>
 ** The story about Atlantis and all the traditions thereon were
 told, as all know, by Plato in his "<i>Timaeus and Critias.</i>"<i>
 </i>Plato, when a child, had it from his grand-sire Critias, aged
 ninety, who in his youth had been told of it by Solon, his father
 Dropidas' friend -- Solon, one of the <i>Grecian Seven Sages.
 </i>No more reliable source could be found, we believe.</p><hr>

 <p>
 separated from the continents, the result was that the undeveloped
 tribes and families of the Atlantean stock fell gradually into
 a still more abject and savage condition.
 </p><p>
 Did not the Spaniards in the Cibola expeditions <i>meet with </i>WHITE
 savage chiefs; and has not the presence of African negro types
 in Europe in the pre-historic ages been now ascertained? It is
 this presence of a type associated with that of the negro, and
 also with that of the Mongolian, which is the stumbling-block
 of anthropology. The individual who lived at an incalculably distant
 period at La Naulette, in Belgium (<i>Vide</i> Dr. Carter Blake's
 paper "<i>On the Naudette Jaw,</i>"<i> Anthrop. Review,
 </i>Sept., 1867), is an example. "The caves on the banks
 of the Lesse, in South-Eastern Belgium," says this Anthropologist,
 "afford evidence of what is, perhaps, the lowest man, as
 shown by the Naulette jaw. Such man, however, had amulets of stone,
 perforated for the purpose of ornament; these are made of a psammite
 now found in the basin of the Gironde."
 </p><p>
 Thus Belgian man was extremely ancient. That man who was antecedent
 to the great flood of waters -- which covered the highlands of
 Belgium with a deposit of <i>lehm </i>or upland gravel 30 metres
 above the level of the present rivers -- must have combined the
 characters of the Turanian and the negro. The Canstadt, or La
 Naulette, man, may have been black, and had nothing to do with
 the Aryan type whose remains are contemporary with those of the
 cave bear at Engis. The denizens of the Aquitaine bone-caves belong
 to a far later period of history, and may not be as ancient as
 the former.
 </p><p>
 If the statement is objected to on the ground that Science does
 not deny the presence of man on earth from an enormous antiquity,
 though that antiquity cannot be determined, since that presence
 is conditioned by the duration of geological periods, the age
 of which is not ascertained; if it is argued that the Scientists
 object most decidedly to the claim that man preceded the animals,
 for instance; or that civilization dates from the earliest Eocene
 period, or, again, that there have ever existed giants, three-eyed
 and four-armed and four-legged men, androgynes, etc., then the
 objectors are asked in their turn, "How do you know? What
 proof have you besides your personal hypotheses, each of which
 may be upset any day by new discoveries?" And these future
 discoveries are sure to prove that, whatever this earlier type
 of man known to Anthropologists was in complexion, he was in no
 respect <i>apish. </i>The Canstadt man, the Engis man alike possessed
 essentially human attributes. (<i>Vide</i> de Quatrefages and
 Hamy. "<i>Cranes des Races Humaines.</i>")<i> </i>People<i>
 </i>have looked for the missing link at the wrong end of the chain;
 and the Neander valley man has long since been dismissed to the
 "limbo of all hasty blunders" (<i>Ibid.</i>). Disraeli
 divided man into the associates of the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 745 REMARKABLE "COINCIDENCES."
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 apes and the angels. Reasons are given in the text in favour of
 an "angelic theory," -- as Christians would say -- at
 least as applicable to some of the races of men. At all events,
 if man exists only since the Miocene period, even then, humanity
 as a whole could not be composed of the abject savages of the
 Palaeolithic age, as they are now represented by the Scientists.
 All they say is mere arbitrary speculative guess-work, invented
 by them to answer to and fit in with their own fanciful theories.
 </p><p>
 We speak of events hundreds of thousands years old, nay, even
 millions -- if man dates from the geological periods* -- not of
 any of those events which happened during the few thousand years
 of the pre-historic margin allowed by timid and ever-cautious
 history. Yet there are men of science who are almost of our way
 of thinking. From the brave confession of the Abbe Brasseur de
 Bourbourg, who says that: -- "Traditions, whose traces recur
 in Mexico, in Central America, in Peru, and in Bolivia, suggest
 the idea that man existed in these different countries at the
 time of the gigantic upheaval of the Andes, and that he has retained
 the memory of it" -- down to the latest palaeontologists
 and anthropologists, the majority of scientific men is in favour
 of just such an antiquity. <i>Apropos </i>of Peru, has any satisfactory
 attempt been made to determine the ethnological affinities and
 characteristics of the race which reared those <i>Cyclopean </i>erections,
 the ruins of which display the relics of a great civilization?
 At Cuelap, for instance, such are found, consisting "of a
 wall of wrought stones, 3,600 feet long, 560 broad, and 150 feet
 high, constituting a solid mass with a level summit. On this mass
 was another, 600 feet long, 500 broad, and 150 feet high, making
 an aggregate height of 300 feet. In it were rooms and cells."
 (<i>Cf., </i>the mass of evidence collected by Donnelly to prove
 the <i>Peruvian colony </i>an offshoot of the Atlanteans.) A most
 suggestive fact is the <i>startling resemblance between the architecture
 of these colossal buildings and that of the archaic European nations.
 </i>Mr. Fergusson regards the analogies between the ruins of "Inca"
 civilization and the Cyclopean remains of the Pelasgians in Italy
 and Greece as a coincidence "the most remarkable in the history
 of architecture." "It is difficult to resist the conclusion
 that there may be some relation between them." The "relation"
 is simply explained by the derivation of the stocks,

 <p>
 * Haeckel's "Man-ape" of the <i>Miocene </i>period is
 the dream of a monomaniac, which de Quatrefages (see his "<i>Human
 Species,</i>"<i> pp. </i>105-113) has cleverly disposed of.
 It is not clear why the world should accept the lucubrations of
 a psychophobic materialist, (to accept whose theory necessitates
 the acceptance <i>on faith </i>of various animals unknown to Science
 or Nature -- like the Sozura, for instance, that amphibian which
 has never existed anywhere outside Haeckel's imagination), rather
 than the traditions of antiquity.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 746 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 who devised these erections, from a common centre in an Atlantic
 continent. The acceptance of the latter can alone assist us to
 approach a solution of this and similar problems in almost every
 branch of modern science.
 </p><p>
 Dr. Lartet, treating upon the subject, settles the question by
 declaring that: -- "The truth, so long contested, of the
 co-existence of man with the great extinct species (<i>Elephas
 primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorrhinus, Hyaena spelaea, Ursus spelaeus,
 etc., etc.</i>)<i>, </i>appears to me to be henceforth unassailable
 and definitely conquered by science." ("<i>Cavernes
 de Perigord,</i>"<i> p. </i>35.)
 </p><p>
 It is shown elsewhere that such is also de Quatrefages' opinion.
 "Man has in all probability seen Miocene times* and consequently
 the entire Pliocene epoch," he says, and there are reasons
 for believing that "his traces will be found further back
 still, . . . ." he adds ("<i>The</i> <i>Human Species,</i>"
 p<i>. </i>152.)
 </p><p>
 Egypt is far older than Europe as now traced on the map. Atlanto-Aryan
 tribes began to settle on it, when the British Islands** and France
 were not even in existence. It is well known that "the tongue
 of the AEgyptian Sea," or the Delta of lower Egypt, became
 firm land very gradually, and followed the highlands of Abyssinia;
 unlike the latter, which arose suddenly, comparatively speaking,
 it was very slowly formed, through long ages, from successive
 layers of sea slime and mud, deposited annually by the soil brought
 down by a large river, the present Nile. Yet even the Delta as
 a firm and fertile land, has been inhabited for more than 100,000
 years. Later tribes, with still more Aryan blood in them than
 their predecessors, arrived from the East, and <i>conquered</i>
 it<i> </i>from a people whose very name is lost to posterity,
 except in Secret works. It is this natural barrier of slime, which
 sucked in slowly and surely every boat that approached these inhospitable
 shores, that was, till within a few thousand of years <strong>B.C</strong>.,
 the best safeguard of the later Egyptians, who had managed to
 reach it through Arabia, Abyssinia, and Nubia, led on by Manu
 Vina in the day of Visvamitra. (<i>See in </i>"<i>Isis Unveiled,</i>"<i>
 </i>vol. 1, p. 627, what Kulluka Bhatta says.)
 </p><p>
 So evident does the antiquity of man become with every day that
 even the Church is preparing an <i>honourable </i>surrender and
 retreat. The learned Abbe Fabre, professor at the Sorbonne, has
 categorically declared
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The ingenious author of "Atlantis, the Ante-diluvian World,"
 in discussing the origin of various Grecian and Roman institutions,
 expresses his conviction that "the <i>roots of the institutions
 of to-day reach back to the Miocene Age.</i>"<i> </i>Ay,
 and further yet, as already stated.
 </p><p>
 ** As we know them, however. For not only does Geology prove that
 the British islands have been <i>four times submerged and re-elevated,
 </i>but that the straits between them and Europe were dry land
 at a remote former epoch.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 747 THE SEVEN SABBATHS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 that pre-historic palaeontology and archaeology may, without any
 harm to the Scriptures, discover in the tertiary beds . . . .
 . the traces of <i>pre-adamite </i>man as much as they like. "Since
 it disregards all creations <i>anterior to the last deluge </i>but
 one, (that which produced the diluvium, according to the Abbe),
 Bible revelation leaves us free to admit the existence of man
 in the grey diluvium, in Pliocene, and even Eocene strata. On
 the other hand, however, geologists <i>are not all agreed in regarding
 the men who inhabited the globe in these primitive ages as our
 ancestors</i>.*
 </p><p>
 The day when the Church will find that its only salvation lies
 in the <i>occult</i> interpretation of the Bible, may not be so
 far off as some imagine. Already many an abbe and ecclesiastic
 has become an ardent Kabalist, and as many appear publicly in
 the arena, breaking a lance with Theosophists and Occultists in
 support of the metaphysical interpretation of the Bible. But they
 commence, unfortunately for them, from the wrong end. They are
 advised, before they begin to speculate upon the <i>metaphysical
 </i>in their Scriptures, to study and master that which relates
 to the purely <i>physical -- e.g., </i>its geological and ethnological
 hints. For such allusions to the Septenary constitution of the
 Earth and Man, to the seven Rounds and Races, abound in the New
 as in the Old Testaments, and are as visible as the sun in the
 heavens to him who reads both symbolically. What do the laws in
 chapter xxiii., v. 15, of <i>Leviticus </i>apply to? What is the
 philosophy of reason for all such <i>hebdomadic </i>offerings
 and symbolical calculations as: "ye shall count . . . . from
 the morrow after the Sabbath . . . . that ye brought the sheaf
 of the wave offering; <i>seven Sabbaths shall be completed</i>"<i>
 </i>(15), "And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs
 without blemish" (18), etc. etc. We shall be contradicted,
 no doubt, when we say that all these "wave" and "peace"
 offerings were in commemoration of the <i>Seven</i> "Sabbaths"
 of the mysteries, which Sabbaths are seven pralayas, between seven
 manvantaras, or what we call <i>Rounds -- </i>for "Sabbath"
 <i>is</i> an elastic word, meaning a period of Rest of whatever
 nature, as explained elsewhere (Part <strong>II</strong>, "<i>Sections
 on the Septenary.</i>") And if this is not sufficiently conclusive,
 then we may turn to the verse which follows (16), and which adds,
 "even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye
 number fifty days" (forty-nine, 7 x 7, stages of activity,
 and forty-nine stages <i>of rest, </i>on the seven globes of the
 chain, and then

 the Abbe in his "<i>Man before Metals,</i>"<i> </i>expresses
 the hope that M. Fabre will permit him "to differ from him
 on this last point," p. 186. So do the Occultists; for though
 they claim a vast difference in the physiology and outward appearance
 of the five races so far evolved, still they maintain that the
 present human species has descended from one and the same primitive
 stock, evolved from the "divine men" -- our common ancestors
 and progenitors.</p><hr>

 <p>
 comes the <i>rest </i>of Sabbath, the <i>fiftieth</i>);<i> </i>after
 which "ye shall offer <i>a new meat offering </i>unto the
 Lord," <i>i.e.</i>, ye shall make an offering of your flesh
 or "coats of skin," and, divesting yourselves of your
 bodies, ye shall remain pure spirits. This law of offering, degraded
 and materialized with ages, was an institution that dated from
 the earliest Atlanteans; it came to the Hebrews <i>via</i> the
 "Chaldees," who were the "wise men" of a <i>caste,
 </i>not of a nation, a community of great adepts come from their
 "Serpent-holes," and who had settled in Babylonia ages
 before. And if this interpretation from <i>Leviticus </i>(full
 of the disfigured laws of Manu) is found too far-fetched, then
 turn to <i>Revelation. </i>Whatever interpretation profane mystics
 may give to the famous Chapter xvii., with its riddle of the woman
 in purple and scarlet; whether Protestants nod at the Roman Catholics,
 when reading "<b>M</b>YSTERY, <b>B</b>ABYLON THE <b>G</b>REAT,
 THE <b>M</b>OTHER OF <b>H</b>ARLOTS AND <b>A</b>BOMINATIONS OF
 THE <b>E</b>ARTH," or Roman Catholics glare at the Protestants,
 the Occultists pronounce, in their impartiality, that these words
 have applied from the first <i>to all and every exoteric </i>Churchianity,
 that which was the "ceremonial magic" of old, with its
 terrible effects, and is now the harmless (because distorted)
 farce of ritualistic worship. The "mystery" of the woman
 and of the beast, are the symbols of soul-killing Churchianity
 and of <b>S</b>UPERSTITION. "The beast that was, and is not,
 and yet is." "And here is the Mind which hath wisdom.
 The seven heads are seven mountains (seven continents and seven
 races) on which the woman sitteth," the symbol of all the
 exoteric, barbarous, idolatrous faiths which have covered that
 symbol "with the blood of the saints and the blood of the
 martyrs" who protested and do protest. "And there are
 <i>seven Kings </i>(seven races); five are fallen (our fifth race
 included), and one is (the fifth continues), and the other (the
 <i>sixth </i>and the <i>seventh </i>races) is not yet come. .
 . . And when he (the race "King") cometh, he must continue
 a short space" (v. 10). There are many such Apocalyptic allusions,
 but the student has to find them out for himself. These five Kings
 were mentioned before.
 </p><p>
 If the Bible combines with archaeology and geology to show that
 human civilization has passed through three more or less distinct
 stages, in Europe at least; and if man, both in America and Europe,
 as much as in Asia, dates from geological epochs -- why should
 not the statements of the Secret Doctrine be taken into consideration?
 Is it more philosophical or logical and scientific too, to <i>disbelieve,
 </i>with Mr. Albert Gaudry, in Miocene man, while believing that
 the famous Thenay flints* "were carved by the <i>Dryopithecus
 monkey</i>";<i> </i>or, with the Occultist, that the anthro-

 of human hands." (<i>G.</i> <i>de Mortillet, </i>"<i>Promenades
 au Musee de St. Germain,</i>"<i> p. </i>76.)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 749 THE APE LATER THAN MAN.</h6>
 
 <p>
 pomorphous monkey came ages after man? For if it is once conceded,
 and even scientifically demonstrated, that "there was not
 in the middle of the Miocene epoch a single species of mammal
 identical with species now extant" (Albert Gaudry "<i>Les
 Enchainements du monde animal dans les temps geologiques</i>"<i>
 p. </i>240); and that man was then just as he is now; only taller,
 and more athletic than we are,* -- then where is the difficulty?
 That they could hardly be the descendants of monkeys, which are
 themselves not traced before the Miocene epoch,** is, on the other
 hand, testified to by several eminent naturalists.
 </p><blockquote>
 "Thus, in the savage of quaternary ages who had to fight
 against the mammoth with stone weapons, we find all those craniological
 characters generally considered as the sign of great intellectual
 development" (<i>de Quatrefages, </i>"<i>The Human Species,
 </i>p. 312.)
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Unless man emerged spontaneously, endowed with all his intellect
 and wisdom, from his brainless catarrhine ancestor, he could not
 have acquired such brain within the limits of the Miocene period,
 if we are to believe the learned Abbe Bourgeois (<i>Vide infra,
 </i>footnote**).
 </p><p>
 As to the matter of giants, though the tallest man hitherto found
 in Europe among fossils is the "Mentone man" (6 ft.
 8 in.), others may yet be excavated. Nilsson, quoted by Lubbock,
 states that "in a tomb of the neolithic age . . . . a skeleton
 of extraordinary size was found in 1807," and that it was
 attributed to a king of Scotland, Albus McGaldus.
 </p><p>
 And if in our own day we occasionally find men and women from
 7 ft. to even 9 ft. and 11 ft. high, this only proves -- on the
 law of atavism, or the reappearance of ancestral features of character
 -- that there was a time when 9 ft. and 10 ft. was the average
 height of humanity, even in our latest Indo-European race.
 </p><p>
 But as the subject was sufficiently treated elsewhere, we may
 pass on to the Lemurians and the Atlanteans, and see what the
 old Greeks knew of these early races and what the moderns know
 now.
 </p><p>
 The great nation mentioned by the Egyptian priests, from which
 descended the forefathers of the Greeks of the age of Troy, and
 which, as averred, had been destroyed by the Atlantic race, was
 then, as we see, assuredly no race of Palaeolithic <i>savages.

 of priests and Initiates, no one seems

 <p>
 to have preserved any distinct recollection of the preceding races.
 The earliest Egyptians had been separated from the latest Atlanteans
 for ages upon ages; they were themselves descended from an <i>alien</i>
 race, and had settled in Egypt some 400,000 years before,* but
 their Initiates had preserved <i>all the records. </i>Even so
 late as the time of Herodotus, they had still in their possession
 the statues of 341 kings who had reigned over their little Atlanto-Aryan
 Sub-race (<i>Vide</i> about the latter "<i>Esoteric Buddhism,</i>"<i>
 p. </i>66, Fifth Edition.) If one allows only twenty years as
 an average figure for the reign of each King, the duration of
 the Egyptian Empire has to be pushed back, from the day of Herodotus,
 about 17,000 years.
 </p><p>
 Bunsen allowed the great Pyramid an antiquity of 20,000 years.
 More modern archaeologists will not give it more than 5,000, or
 at the utmost 6,000 years; and generously concede to Thebes with
 its hundred gates, 7,000 years from the date of its foundation.
 And yet there are records which show Egyptian priests -- Initiates
 -- journeying in a North-Westerly direction, <i>by land, via</i>
 what became later the Straits of Gibraltar; turning North and
 travelling through the future Phoenician settlements of Southern
 Gaul; then still further North, until reaching Carnac (Morbihan)
 they turned to the West again and arrived, <i>still travelling
 by land, </i>on the North-Western promontory of the New Continent.**
 </p><p>
 What was the object of their long journey? And how far back must
 we place the date of such visits? The archaic records show the
 Initiates of the Second Sub-race of the Aryan family moving from
 one land to the other for the purpose of supervising the building
 of <i>menhirs </i>and dolmens, of colossal Zodiacs in stone, and
 places of sepulchre to serve as receptables for the ashes of generations
 to come. When was it? The fact of their crossing from France to
 Great Britain <i>by land </i>may give an idea of the date when
 such a journey could have been performed on <i>terra firma.</i>

 two baked bricks were discovered, one at the depth of 20, the
 other at 25 yards. If we estimate the thickness of the annual
 deposit formed by the river at 8 inches per century (more careful
 calculations have shown no more than from three to five per century),
 we must assign to the first of these bricks 12,000 years, and
 to the second 14,000 years. By means of analogous calculations,
 Burmeister supposes 72,000 years to have elapsed since the first
 appearance of man on the soil of Egypt, and Draper attributes
 to the European man, who witnessed the last glacial epoch, an
 antiquity of more than 250,000 years." ("<i>Man</i>

 and the bold navigators of Tyre and Sidon, who at a later date
 were to undertake their perilous voyages along the coasts of Africa,
 were yet unborn. What we know with <i>certainty is that European
 man was contemporaneous with </i>the extinct species of the quaternary
 epoch . . . . that he witnessed the upheaval of the Alps* and
 the extension of the glaciers, in a word that he lived for thousands
 of years before the dawn of the remotest <i>historical </i>traditions
 . . . . It is even possible that man was the contemporary of extinct
 mammalia of species yet more ancient . . . . of the <i>Elephas
 meridionalis of </i>the sands of St. Prest . . . and the <i>Elephas
 antiquus, </i>assumed to be prior to the <i>elephas primigenius,
 </i>since their bones are found in company with carved flints
 in several English caves, associated with those of the <i>Rhinoceros
 hemitaechus </i>and even of the <i>Machairodus latidens, </i>which
 is of still earlier date . . . . M. E. Lartet is of opinion that
 there is nothing really impossible in the existence of man as
 early as the Tertiary period."**

 <p>
 If "there is nothing impossible" scientifically in the
 idea, and it may be admitted that man lived already as early as
 the Tertiary period, then it is just as well to remind the reader
 that Mr. Croll places the beginning of that period 2,500,000 years
 back (See Croll's "<i>Climate and Time</i>");<i> </i>but
 there was a time when he assigned to it 15,000,000 years.

 And if all this may be said of <i>European man, </i>how great
 is the antiquity of the Lemuro-Atlantean and of the Atlanto-Aryan
 man? Every educated person who follows the progress of Science,
 knows how all vestiges of man during the Tertiary period are received.
 The calumnies that were poured on Desnoyers in 1863, when he made
 known to the Institute of France that he had made a discovery
 "in the undisturbed pliocene sands of St. Prest near Chartres,
 proving the co-existence of man and <i>the Elephas meridionalis</i>"<i>

 The modern archeologist, though speculating <i>ad infinitum </i>upon
 the dolmens and their builders, knows, in fact, nothing of them
 or their origin. Yet, these weird, and often colossal monuments
 of unhewn stones -- which consist generally of four or seven gigantic
 blocks placed together -- are strewn over Asia, Europe, America,
 and Africa, in groups or rows. Stones of enormous size are found
 placed horizontally and variously upon two, three, four, and as
 in Poitou, upon six and seven blocks. People name them "devil's
 altars," druidic stones, and giant tombs. The stones of Carnac
 in the Morbihan, Brittany -- nearly a mile in length and numbering
 11,000 ranged in eleven rows -- are twin sisters of those at Stonehenge.
 The Conical <i>menhir </i>of Loch-Maria-ker in Morbihan, measures
 twenty yards in length and nearly two yards across. The Menhir
 of Champ Dolent (near St. Malo) rises thirty feet above the ground,
 and is fifteen feet in depth below. Such dolmens and prehistoric
 monuments are met with in almost every latitude. They are found
 in the Mediterranean basin; in Denmark (among the local <i>tumuli
 </i>from twenty-seven to thirty-five feet in height); in Shetland,
 and in Sweden, where they are called <i>ganggriften </i>(or tombs
 with corridors); in Germany, where they are known as the giant
 tombs (Hunengraben); in Spain (see the dolmen of <i>Antiguera
 </i>near Malaga), and Africa; in Palestine and Algeria; in Sardinia
 (see the <i>Nuraghi </i>and <i>Sepolture dei giganti, </i>or tombs
 of giants); in Malabar, in India, where they are called the tombs
 of the <i>Daityas </i>(giants) and of the <i>Rakshasas, </i>the
 men-demons of <i>Lanka</i>;<i> </i>in Russia and Siberia, where
 they are known as the <i>Koorgan</i>;<i> </i>in Peru and Bolivia,
 where they are termed the <i>chulpas</i> or<i> </i>burial places,
 etc., etc., etc.
 </p><p>
 There is no country from which they are absent. Who built them?
 Why are they all connected with Serpents and Dragons, with Alligators
 and Crocodiles? Because remains of "palaeolithic man"
 were, it is thought, found in some of them, and because in the
 funeral mounds of America bodies of later races were discovered
 with the usual paraphernalia of bone necklaces, weapons, stone
 and copper urns, etc., hence they are declared ancient <i>tombs.

 valley and the other in Ohio -- known respectively as "the
 Alligator Mound" and "the Great Serpent

 </i>Yet one is told authoritatively that the Mounds, and the Mound
 or Dolmen Builders, are all "Pelasgic" in Europe, antecedent
 to the Incas, in America, yet of "not extremely distant times."
 They are built by "<i>no </i>race of Dolmen Builders,"
 which <i>never existed </i>(opinion of De Mortillet, Bastian,
 and Westropp) save in the earlier archeological fancy. Finally
 Virchow's opinion of the giant tombs of Germany is now accepted
 as an axiom: -- "The tombs alone are gigantic, and not the
 bones they contain" -- says that German biologist; and archaeology
 has but to bow and submit to the decision.**
 </p><p>
 That no gigantic skeletons have been hitherto found in the "tombs"
 is yet no reason to say there never were the remains of giants
 in them. <i>Cremation was universal </i>till a comparatively recent
 period -- some 80, or 100,000 years ago. The real giants, moreover,
 were nearly all drowned with Atlantis. Nevertheless, the classics,
 as shown elsewhere, often speak of giant skeletons still excavated
 in their day. Besides this, human fossils may be counted on the
 fingers, as yet. No skeleton ever yet found is older than between
 50, or 60,000 years,*** and man's size was reduced from 15 to
 10 or 12 feet, ever since the third sub-race of the Aryan stock,
 which sub-race -- born and developed in Europe and Asia Minor
 under new climates and conditions -- had become European. Since
 then, as said, it has steadily been decreasing. It is truer therefore
 to say, that the tombs alone are archaic, and not necessarily
 the bodies of men occasionally found in them; and that those tombs,
 since they are gigantic, must have contained giants,**** or rather
 the ashes of generations of giants.

 first of these animals (the alligator) designed with considerable
 skill, is no less than 250 ft. long. . . . . The interior is formed
 of a heap of stones, over which the form has been moulded in fine
 stiff clay. The great serpent is represented with open mouth,
 in the act of swallowing an egg of which the diameter is 100 ft.
 in the thickest part; the body of the animal is wound in graceful
 curves and the tail is rolled into a spiral. The entire length
 of the animal is 1,100 ft. This work is unique . . . . and there
 is nothing on the old continent which offers any analogy to it."
 Except its symbolism, however, of the Serpent -- the cycle of
 Time -- swallowing Kosmos, the egg.

 Nor were all such cyclopean structures intended for sepulchres.
 It is with the so-called Druidical remains, such as Carnac in
 Brittany and Stonehenge in Great Britain, that the travelling
 Initiates above alluded to had to do. And these gigantic monuments
 are all symbolic records of the World's history. They are <i>not</i>
 Druidical, but <i>universal. </i>Nor did the Druids build them,
 for they were only the heirs to the cyclopean lore left to them
 by generations of mighty builders and -- "magicians,"
 both good and bad.
 </p><p>
 It will always be a subject of regret that history, rejecting
 <i>a priori </i>the actual existence of giants, has preserved
 us so little of the records of antiquity concerning them. Yet
 in nearly every mythology -- which after all<i> is </i>ancient
 history -- the giants play an important part. In the old Norse
 mythology, the giants, Skrymir and his brethren, against whom
 the sons of the gods fought, were potent factors in the histories
 of deities and men. The modern exegesis, that makes these giants
 to be the brethren of the dwarfs, and reduces the combats of the
 gods to the history of the development of the Aryan race, will
 only receive credence amongst the believers in the Aryan theory,
 as expounded by Max Muller. Granting that the Turanian races were
 typified by the dwarfs (Dwergar), and that a dark, round-headed,
 and dwarfish race was driven northward by the fair-faced Scandinavians,
 or AEsir, the gods being like unto men, there still exists neither
 in history nor any other scientific work any anthropological proof
 whatever of the existence in time or space of a race of giants.
 Yet that such exist, relatively and <i>de facto </i>side by side
 with dwarfs, Schweinfurth can testify. The <i>Nyam-Nyam </i>of
 Africa are regular dwarfs, while their next neighbours (several
 tribes of comparatively fair-complexioned Africans) are giants
 when confronted with the Nyam-Nyams, and very tall even among
 Europeans, for their women are all above 6 1/2 feet high. (<i>Vide</i>
 Schweinfurth's latest works.)
 </p><p>
 In Cornwall and in ancient Britain the traditions of these giants
 are, on the other hand, excessively common; they are said to live
 even down to the time of King Arthur. All this shows that giants
 lived to a later date amongst the Celtic than among the Teutonic
 peoples.
 </p><p>
 If we turn to the New World, we have traditions of a race of giants
 at Tarija on the eastern slopes of the Andes and in Ecuador, who
 combated gods and men. These old beliefs, which term certain localities
 "<i>Los campos de los gigantes</i>"<i> -- </i>"the
 fields of giants," are always concomitant with the existence
 of pliocene mammalia and the occurrence of pliocene raised beaches.
 "All the giants are not under Mount Ossa," and it would
 be poor anthropology indeed that would restrict the traditions
 of giants to Greek and Bible mythologies. Slavonian countries,
 Russia especially, teem with legends about the <i>bogaterey </i>(mighty
 giants)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 755 RACES OF GIANTS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of old; and their folklore, most of which has served for the foundation
 of national histories, their oldest songs, and their most archaic
 traditions, speak of the giants of old. Thus we may safely reject
 the modern theory that would make of the Titans mere symbols standing
 for cosmic forces. They were real living men, whether twenty or
 only twelve feet high. Even the Homeric heroes, who, of course,
 belonged to a far more recent period in the history of the races,
 appear to have wielded weapons of a size and weight beyond the
 strength of the strongest men of modern times.
 </p><blockquote>
 "Not twice ten men the mighty bulk could raise,<br>
 Such men as live in these degenerate days."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 If the fossil footprints from Carson, Indiana, <strong>U.S.A.</strong>,
 are human, they indicate gigantic men. Of their genuineness there
 can remain no doubt. It is to be deplored that the modem and <i>scientific
 </i>evidence for gigantic men should rest on footprints alone.
 Over and over again, the skeletons of hypothetical giants have
 been identified with those of elephants and mastodons. But all
 such blunders before the days of geology, and even the traveller's
 tales of Sir John Mandeville, who says that <i>he saw giants 56
 feet high, </i>in India, only show that belief in the existence
 of giants has never, at any time, died out of the thoughts of
 men.
 </p><p>
 That which is known and accepted is, that several races of gigantic
 men have existed and left distinct traces. In the journal of the
 Anthropological Institute (Vol. 1871, art. by Dr. C. Carter Blake)
 such a race is shown as having existed at Palmyra and possibly
 in Midian, exhibiting cranial forms quite different from those
 of the Jews. It is not improbable that another such race existed
 in Samaria, and that the mysterious people who built the stone
 circles in Galilee, hewed neolithic flints in the Jordan valley
 and preserved an ancient Semitic language quite distinct from
 the square Hebrew character -- was of a very large stature. The
 English translations of the Bible can never be relied upon, even
 in their modern <i>revised </i>forms. They tell us of the<i> Nephilim
 </i>translating the word by "giants," and further adding
 that they were "hairy" men, probably the large and powerful
 prototypes of the later satyrs so eloquently described by the
 patristic fancy; some of the Church Fathers assuring their admirers
 and followers that they had themselves seen these "Satyrs"
 -- some alive, others pickled and preserved. The word "giants"
 being once adopted as a synonym of <i>Nephilim, </i>the commentators
 have since identified them with the sons of Anak. The filibusters
 who seized on the Promised Land, found a pre-existing population
 far exceeding their own in stature, and called it a race of giants.
 But the races of really gigantic men had disappeared ages before
 the birth of Moses. This tall people existed in Canaan, and</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 756 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 even in Bashan, and may have had representatives in the Nabatheans
 of Midian. They were of far greater stature than the undersized
 Jews. Four thousand years ago their cranial conformation and large
 stature separated them from the children of Heber. Forty thousand
 years ago their ancestors may have been of still more gigantic
 size, and four hundred thousand years earlier <i>they must have
 been </i>in proportion to men in our days as the Brobdingnagians
 were to the Lilliputians. The Atlanteans of the middle period
 were called the Great Dragons, and the first symbol of their tribal
 deities, when the "gods" and the Divine Dynasties had
 forsaken them, was that of a giant Serpent.
 </p><p>
 The mystery veiling the origin and the religion of the Druids,
 is as great as that of their supposed fanes is to the modern Symbologist,
 but not to the initiated Occultists. Their priests were the descendants
 of the last Atlanteans, and what is known of them is sufficient
 to allow the inference that they were eastern priests akin to
 the Chaldeans and Indians, though little more. It may be inferred
 that they symbolized their deity as the Hindus do their Vishnu,
 as the Egyptians did their <i>Mystery God, </i>and as the builders
 of the Ohio Great-Serpent mound worshipped theirs -- namely under
 the form of the "mighty Serpent," the emblem of the
 eternal deity <b>T</b>IME (the Hindu Kala). Pliny called them
 the "Magi of the Gauls and Britons." But they were more
 than that. The author of "<i>Indian Antiquities</i>"<i>
 </i>finds much affinity between the Druids and the Brahmins of
 India. Dr. Borlase points to a close analogy between them and
 the Magi of Persia*; others will see an identity between them
 and the Orphic priesthood of Thrace: simply because they were
 connected, in their esoteric teachings, with the universal Wisdom
 Religion, and thus presented affinities with the exoteric worship
 of all.
 </p><p>
 Like the Hindus, the Greeks and Romans (we speak of the Initiates),
 the Chaldees and the Egyptians, the Druids believed in the doctrine
 of a succession of worlds, as also in that of seven "creations"
 (of new continents) and transformations of the face of the earth,
 and in a seven-fold night and day for each earth or globe (<i>See
 </i>"<i>Esoteric Buddhism</i>")<i>. </i>Wherever the
 Serpent with the egg is found, there this tenet was surely present.
 Their <i>Dracontia </i>are a proof of it. This belief was so universal
 that, if we seek for it in the esotericism of various religions,
 we shall discover it in all. We shall find it among the Aryan
 Hindus and Mazdeans, the Greeks, the Latins, and even among the
 old Jews and early Christians, whose modern stocks

 hardly comprehend now that which they read in their Scriptures.
 See what Seneca says in <i>Epistle </i>9, and Quaest. Nat. <strong>III</strong>.,
 c., ult.: "The world being melted and having re-entered the
 bosom of Jupiter, this god continues for some time to remain absorbed
 in himself and <i>concealed, </i>wholly immersed in contemplation.
 After which a new world springs from him. . . . An innocent race
 of men and animals are produced anew . . . etc." Then again
 when speaking of periodical mundane dissolution involving universal
 death, he (Seneca) says that "when the laws of nature shall
 be buried in ruin, and the last day of the world shall come, <i>the
 southern pole shall crush, </i>as it falls, all the regions of
 Africa, and the North pole shall overwhelm all the countries beneath
 its axis. <i>The affrighted sun shall be deprived of its light</i>;<i>
 </i>the palace of heaven falling to decay <i>shall produce at
 once both </i>life and death, and some kind of dissolution shall
 equally seize upon all deities, who thus shall return into their
 original chaos" (<i>Quoted in </i>"<i>Book of God,</i>"<i>
 p. </i>160.)
 </p><p>
 One might imagine oneself reading the Puranic account by Parasara
 of the great Pralaya. It is nearly the same thing, idea for idea.
 Has Christianity nothing of the kind? It has, we say. Let the
 reader open any English Bible and read chapter iii. of the <i>Second
 </i>Epistle of Peter, from verse iii. till the xivth, and he will
 find there the same ideas. . . . "There shall come in the
 last days scoffers . . . saying, 'where is the promise of his
 coming? . . . . Since the fathers fell asleep all things continue
 as they were from the beginning of creation.' For, they are ignorant
 . . . . that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and <i>the
 earth standing out of the water and in the water</i>:<i> whereby
 the world that then was, being overflowed with water, </i>perished.
 But the heavens and the earth <i>that are now, </i>are reserved
 unto the fire . . . . wherein the heavens . . . . shall be dissolved,
 and the elements shall melt with fervent heat . . . . we nevertheless
 look for <i>new</i> <i>heavens and new earth, etc., etc.</i>"<i>
 </i>If the interpreters chose to see in this a reference to creation,
 the deluge, and the promised coming of Christ, when they will
 live in a new Jerusalem in heaven, this is no fault of "Peter."
 What the writer of the Epistles meant was the destruction of this
 Fifth Race of ours by subterranean fires and inundations, and
 the appearance of new continents for the Sixth Root-Race. For
 the writers of these Epistles were all learned in symbology if
 not in the sciences.
 </p><p>
 It was mentioned elsewhere that the belief in the septenary constitution
 of our "chain" was the oldest tenet of the early Iranians,
 who got it from the first Zarathustra. It is time to prove it
 to those Parsis who have lost the key to the meaning of their
 Scriptures. In the Avesta the earth is considered septempartite
 and tripartite at one and the same time. This is regarded by Dr.
 Geiger, as an <i>incongruity, </i>for<i> </i>the following reasons,
 which he calls discrepancies: the Avesta speaks</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 758 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of the three-thirds of the earth because the Rig-Veda mentions
 "three earths." . . . . "Three strata or layers,
 one lying above the other, are said to be meant by this."*
 But he is quite mistaken, as are all exoteric profane translators.
 The Avesta has not borrowed the idea from the <i>Rig-Veda, </i>but
 simply repeats the esoteric teaching. The "three strata or
 layers" do not refer to our globe alone, but to three layers
 of the globes of our terrestrial chain -- two by two, on each
 plane, one on the descending, the other on the ascending arc.
 Thus, with reference to the six spheres or globes above our earth,
 the seventh and the fourth, it is <i>septempartite, </i>while
 with regard to the planes over our plane -- it is <i>tripartite.
 </i>This meaning is carried out and corroborated by the text in
 the Avesta and Vendidad, and even by the speculations -- a most
 laborious and unsatisfactory guess-work -- of the translators
 and commentators. It thus follows that the division of the "earth,"
 or rather the earth's chain, into seven <i>Karshvars </i>is not
 in contradiction with the three "zones," if this word
 is read "planes." As Geiger remarks, this septenary
 division is very old -- the oldest of all -- since the Gathas
 already speak of the "septempartite earth." (<i>Bumi
 haptaiti, Yasna, </i>xxxii., 3.) For, "according to the Parsee
 Scriptures, the <i>seven Karshvars are to be considered as completely
 disconnected parts of the earth,</i>"<i> </i>which they surely
 are. For, "between them <i>there flows the Ocean, </i>so
 that it is impossible, as stated in several passages, to pass
 from one Karshvar to another."** The "Ocean" is
 <i>space, </i>of course, for the latter was called "Waters
 of Space" before it was known as Ether. Moreover, the word
 <i>Karshvar </i>is consistently rendered by <i>Dwipa, </i>and
 especially <i>Qaniratha </i>by Jambudwipa ("Neriosengh, the
 translator of the Yasna.")*** But this fact is not taken
 into account by the Orientalists, and therefore we find even such
 a learned Zoroastrian and Parsi by birth as the translator of
 Dr. Geiger's work passing unnoticed and without a word of comment
 sundry remarks of the former on the "incongruities"
 of this kind abounding in the Mazdean Scriptures. One of such
 "incongruities" and "coincidences" concerns
 the similarity of the Zoroastrian with the Indian tenet with regard
 to the seven <i>Dwipas </i>(islands, or continents, rather) as
 met with in the <i>Puranas, </i>namely: "The Dwipas form
 concentric rings, which, separated by the ocean, surround Jambu
 Dvipa, which is situated in the centre" (p. 130, vol. I.),
 and, "according to the Iranian view, the <i>Karshvar Qaniratha
 </i>is likewise situated in the centre of the rest . . . . each
 of them (the other six <i>Karshvars</i>)<i> </i>is a

 <i>Qaniratha </i>is not, as believed by Geiger and his translator,
 "the country inhabited by the Iranian tribes," and the
 other names do not mean "the adjacent territories of foreign
 nations in the North, South, West, and East" (p. 132), but
 our globe or Earth. For that which is meant by the sentence which
 follows the last quoted, namely, that "two <i>Vorubarshti
 </i>and<i> Voru-Zarshti </i>lie in the North; two, <i>Vidadhafshu</i>
 and<i> Tradadhafshu, </i>in the South; <i>Savahi</i> and<i> Arzahi
 </i>in the East and West," is simply the very graphic and
 accurate description of the "chain" of our planet, the
 Earth, represented in the book of Dzyan (11) thus:
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-759.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 The Mazdean names given above have only to be replaced by those
 used in the Secret Doctrine to become an orthodox tenet. The "Earth"
 (our World), therefore, <i>is</i> "tripartite," because
 the chain of the worlds is situated on three different <i>planes
 </i>above our globe; and it is <i>septempartite </i>because of
 the seven globes or spheres which compose the chain. Hence the
 further meaning given in Vendidad <strong>XIX</strong>. 39, showing
 that "<i>Qaniratha </i>alone is combined with <i>imat, </i>'this'
 (earth), while all other <i>Karshvares </i>are combined with the
 word '<i>avat</i>,' 'that' or<i> those -- </i>upper earths."
 Nothing could be plainer.
 </p><p>
 The same may be said of the modern comprehension of all other
 ancient beliefs.
 </p><p>
 The Druids understood the meaning of the Sun in Taurus, therefore,
 when, while all the fires were extinguished on the 1st of November,
 their sacred and inextinguishable fires alone remained to illumine
 the horizon, like those of the Magi and the modern Zoroastrians.
 And like the early Fifth Race and later Chaldees, the Greeks,
 and again like the Christians, who do the same to this day, without
 suspecting the real meaning, they greeted the Morning Star --
 the beautiful Venus-Lucifer.*

 Strabo speaks of an island near to Britannia, "where Ceres
 and Persephone were worshipped with the same rites as in Samothrace
 (lib. iv.) and this island was Sacred Ierna," where a perpetual
 fire was lit. The Druids believed in the rebirth of man, not as
 Lucian explains: "that the same <i>spirit </i>shall animate
 a new body, not here, but in a different world," but in a
 series of re-incarnations in this same world; for as Diodorus
 says, they declared that the souls of men, after determinate periods,
 would pass into other bodies.*
 </p><p>
 These tenets came to the Fifth Race Aryans from their predecessors
 of the Fourth Race, the Atlanteans. They had piously preserved
 the teachings, which told them how their parent Root-Race, becoming
 with every generation more arrogant, owing to the acquisition
 of superhuman powers, had been gradually gliding toward its end.
 Those records reminded them of the giant intellect of the preceding
 races as well as of their giant size. One finds the repetition
 of those records in every age of history, in almost every old
 fragment which has descended to us from antiquity.

 AElian preserved an extract from Theophrastus written during the

 Africa seemed like poor islands compared with it. <i>It was the
 last to produce </i>animals and plants of gigantic magnitudes.
 There, said Silenus, men grew to double the size of the tallest
 man in his (the narrator's) time, and they lived to twice as old
 an age. They had wealthy cities with temples, and one of such
 (cities) held more than a million of inhabitants in it, gold and
 silver being found there in great abundance. . . .

 Grote's suggestion that Atlantis was but a myth arisen from a
 mirage -- clouds on a dazzling sky taking the appearance of islands
 on a golden sea -- is too disingenuous to be even noticed.

 * There was a time when the whole world, the totality of mankind,
 had one religion, and when they were of "one lip." "All
 the religions of the Earth were at first One and emanated from
 <i>one</i> centre," says Faber very truly.
