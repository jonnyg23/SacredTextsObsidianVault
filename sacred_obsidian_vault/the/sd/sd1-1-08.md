 </p><h4>A FEW EARLY THEOSOPHICAL MISCONCEPTIONS<br>
 CONCERNING PLANETS, ROUNDS, AND MAN.</h4>
 
 <p>
 Among the eleven Stanzas omitted* there is one which gives a full
 description of the formation of the planetary chains one after
 another, after the first Cosmic and Atomic differentiation had
 commenced in the primitive <em>Acosmism. </em>It is idle to speak
 of "laws arising when Deity prepares to create" for
 (<em>a</em>) laws or rather <strong>L</strong>AW is eternal and
 uncreated; and (<em>b</em>) that Deity is Law, and <em>vice versa.
 </em>Moreover, the one eternal <strong>L</strong>AW unfolds everything
 in the (to be) manifested Nature on a sevenfold principle; among
 the rest, the countless circular chains of worlds, composed of
 seven globes, graduated on the four lower planes of the world
 of formation (the three others belonging to the Archetypal Universe).
 Out of these seven only <em>one</em>,<em> the lowest and the most
 material of those globes</em>,<em> </em>is within our plane or
 means of perception, the six others lying outside of it and being
 therefore invisible to the terrestrial eye. Every such chain of
 worlds is the progeny and creation of another, <em>lower</em>,
 and<em> dead </em>chain -- <em>its reincarnation</em>,<em> </em>so
 to say. To make it clearer: we are told of the planets -- of which
 <em>seven only </em>were held as sacred, as being ruled by the
 highest regents or gods, and not at all because the ancients knew
 nothing of the others** -- that each of these, whether known or
 unknown, is a septenary, as is the chain to which the Earth belongs
 (see "Esoteric

 <p>

 and also the summary of the Stanzas in the Proem, page 22.

 Buddhism"). For instance, all such planets as Mercury, Venus,
 Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc., etc., or our Earth, are as visible
 to us as our globe, probably, is to the inhabitants of the other
 planets, if any, because they are all on the same plane; while
 the superior fellow-globes of these planets are on other planes
 quite outside that of our terrestrial senses. As their relative
 position is given further on, and also in the diagram appended
 to the Comments on Verse 7 of Stanza VI., a few words of explanation
 is all that is needed at present. These invisible companions correspond
 curiously to that which we call "the principles in Man."
 The seven are on three material planes and one spiritual plane,
 answering to the three <em>Upadhis </em>(material bases) and one
 spiritual vehicle (<em>Vahan</em>)<em> </em>of our seven principles
 in the human division. If, for the sake of a clearer mental conception,
 we imagine the human principles to be arranged as in the following
 scheme, we shall obtain the annexed diagram of correspondences:
 --

 <strong>D</strong>IAGRAM <strong>I</strong>.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s) to diagram]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 *As we are proceeding here from Universals to Particulars, instead
 of using the inductive or Aristotelean method, the numbers are
 reversed. Spirit is enumerated the first instead of seventh, as
 is usually done, but, in truth, <em>ought not to be done.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Â† Or as usually named after the manner of <em>Esoteric Buddhism
 </em>and others: 1, Atma; 2, Buddhi (or Spiritual Soul); 3, Manas
 (Human Soul); 4, Kama Rupa (Vehicle of Desires and Passions);
 5, Linga Sarira; 6, Prana; 7, Sthula Sarira.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 154 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 The dark horizontal lines of the lower planes are the Upadhis
 in one case, and the planes in the case of the planetary chain.
 Of course, as regards the human principles, the diagram does not
 place them quite in order, yet it shows the correspondence and
 analogy to which attention is now drawn. As the reader will see,
 it is a case of descent into matter, the adjustment -- in both
 the mystic and the physical senses -- of the two, and their interblending
 for the great coming "struggle of life" that awaits
 both the <em>entities. </em>"Entity" may be thought
 a strange term to use in the case of a globe; but the ancient
 philosophers, who saw in the earth a huge "animal,"
 were wiser in their generation than our modern geologists are
 in theirs; and Pliny, who called the Earth our kind nurse and
 mother, the only element which is not inimical to man, spoke more
 truly than Watts, who fancied that he saw in her the footstool
 of God. For Earth is only the footstool of man in his ascension
 to higher regions; the vestibule --
 </p><blockquote>
 ". . . . . . . to glorious mansions,<br>
 Through which a moving crowd for ever press."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 But this only shows how admirably the occult philosophy fits everything
 in Nature, and how much more logical are its tenets than the lifeless
 hypothetical speculations of physical science.
 </p><p>
 Having learned thus much, the mystic will be better prepared to
 understand the occult teaching, though every formal student of
 modern science may, and probably will, regard it as preposterous
 nonsense. The student of occultism, however, holds that the theory
 at present under discussion is far more philosophical and probable
 than any other. It is more logical, at any rate, than the theory
 recently advanced which made of the moon the projection of a portion
 of our Earth extruded when the latter was but a globe in fusion,
 a molten plastic mass.*
 </p><p>
 It is said that the planetary chains having their "Days"
 and their

 * Says the author of "Modern Science and Modern Thought,"
 Mr. Samuel Laing: "The astronomical conclusions are theories
 based on data so uncertain, that while in some cases they give
 results incredibly short, like that of 15 millions of years for
 the whole past process of formation of the solar system, in others
 they give results almost incredibly long, as <em>in that which
 supposes the moon to have been thrown off when the Earth was rotating
 in three hours</em>,<em> while the utmost actual retardation obtained
 from observation would require </em>600 millions of years to make
 it rotate in twenty-three hours instead of twenty-four" (p.
 48). And if physicists persist, why should the chronology of the
 Hindus be laughed at as exaggerated?</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 155 EXCHANGE OF LIFE-PRINCIPLES.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "Nights" -- <em>i.e.</em>, periods of activity or life,
 and of inertia or death -- and behave in heaven as do men on Earth:
 they generate their likes, get old, and become personally extinct,
 their spiritual principles only living in their progeny as a survival
 of themselves.
 </p><p>
 Without attempting the very difficult task of giving out the whole
 process in all its cosmic details, enough may be said to give
 an approximate idea of it. When a planetary chain is in its last
 Round, its Globe 1 or A, before finally <em>dying out</em>, sends
 all its energy and "principles" into a neutral centre
 of latent force, a "laya centre," and thereby informs
 a new nucleus of undifferentiated substance or matter, <em>i.e.</em>,<em>
 </em>calls it into activity or gives it life. Suppose such a process
 to have taken place in the lunar "planetary" chain;
 suppose again, for argument's sake (though Mr. Darwin's theory
 quoted below has lately been upset, even if the fact has not yet
 been ascertained by mathematical calculation) that the moon is
 far older than the Earth. Imagine the six fellow-globes of the
 moon -- aeons before the first globe of our seven was evolved
 -- just in the same position in relation to each other as the
 fellow-globes of our chain occupy in regard to our Earth now.
 (See in "Esoteric Buddhism," "The Constitution
 of Man," and the "Planetary Chain.") And now it
 will be easy to imagine further Globe A of the lunar chain informing
 Globe A of the terrestrial chain, and -- dying; Globe B of the
 former sending after that its energy into Globe B of the new chain;
 then Globe C of the lunar, creating its progeny sphere C of the
 terrene chain; then the Moon (our Satellite*) pouring forth into
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * She is the satellite, undeniably, but this does not invalidate
 the theory that she has given to the Earth all but her corpse.
 For Darwin's theory to hold good, besides the hypothesis just
 upset (vide last footnote), other still more incongruous speculations
 had to be invented. The Moon, it is said, has cooled nearly six
 times as rapidly as the Earth (Winchell's "World-Life"):
 "The Moon, if the earth is 14,000,000 years old since its
 incrustation, is only eleven and two thirds millions of years
 old since that stage . . ." etc. And if our Moon is but a
 splash from our Earth, why can no similar inference be established
 for the Moons of other planets? The Astronomers "do not know."
 Why should Venus and Mercury have no satellites, and by what,
 when they exist, were they formed? Because, we say, science has
 only one key -- the key of matter -- to open the mysteries of
 nature withal, while occult philosophy has seven keys and explains
 that which science fails to see. Mercury and Venus have no satellites
 but they had "parents" just as the earth had. Both are
 far older than the Earth and, before the latter reaches her seventh
 Round, her mother Moon will have dissolved [[Footnote continued

 <p>
 the lowest globe of our planetary ring -- Globe D, our Earth --
 all its life, energy and powers; and, having transferred them
 to a new centre becoming virtually <em>a dead planet</em>,<em>
 </em>in which rotation has almost ceased since the birth of our
 globe. The Moon is now the cold residual quantity, the shadow
 dragged after the new body, into which her living powers and "principles"
 are transfused. She now is doomed for long ages to be ever pursuing
 the Earth, to be attracted by and to attract her progeny. Con<em>stantly
 vampirised </em>by her child, she revenges herself on it by soaking
 it through and through with the nefarious, invisible, and poisoned
 influence which emanates from the occult side of her nature. For
 she is a <em>dead</em>,<em> </em>yet a <em>living body. </em>The
 particles of her decaying corpse are full of active and destructive
 life, although the body which they had formed is soulless and
 lifeless. Therefore its emanations are at the same time beneficent
 and maleficent -- this circumstance finding its parallel on earth
 in the fact that the grass and plants are nowhere more juicy and
 thriving than on the graves; while at the same time it is the
 graveyard or corpse-emanations, which kill. And like all ghouls
 or vampires, the moon is the friend of the sorcerers and the foe
 of the unwary. From the archaic aeons and the later times of the
 witches of Thessaly, down to some of the present <em>tantrikas
 </em>of Bengal, her nature and properties were known to every
 Occultist, but have remained a closed book for physicists.
 </p><p>
 Such is the moon from the astronomical, geological, and physical
 standpoints. As to her metaphysical and psychic nature it must
 remain an occult secret in this work, as it was in the volume
 on "Esoteric Buddhism," notwithstanding the rather sanguine
 statement made therein on p. 113 (5th edition) that "there
 is not much mystery left now in the riddle of the eighth sphere."
 These are topics, indeed, "on which the adepts are very reserved
 in their communications to uninitiated pupils," and since
 they have, moreover, never sanctioned or permitted any published
 speculations upon them, the less said the better.
 </p><p>
 Yet without treading upon the forbidden ground of the "eighth
 sphere," it may be useful to state some additional facts
 with regard to ex-monads of the lunar chain -- the "lunar
 ancestors" -- as they play a

 <p>
 leading part in the coming <em>Anthropogenesis. </em>This brings
 us directly to the septenary constitution of man; and as some
 discussion has arisen of late about the best classification to
 be adopted for the division of the microcosmic entity, two systems
 are now appended with a view to facilitate comparison. The subjoined
 short article is from the pen of Mr. T. Subba Row, a learned Vedantin
 scholar. He prefers the Brahmanical division of the Raja Yoga,
 and from a metaphysical point of view he is quite right. But,
 as it is a question of simple choice and expediency, we hold in
 this work to the "time-honoured" classification of the
 trans-Himalayan "Arhat Esoteric School." The following
 table and its explanatory text are reprinted from the "Theosophist"
 of Madras, and they are also contained in "Five Years of
 Theosophy": --
 </p><p>
 SEPTENARY DIVISION IN DIFFERENT INDIAN SYSTEMS.
 </p><p>
 "We give below in a tabular form the classifications adopted
 by the Buddhist and Vedantic teachers of the principles of man:
 --
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd1-157.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s) to table]] </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Kosa (kosha) is "Sheath" literally, the sheath of
 every principle.
 </p><p>
 Â† "Life."
 </p><p>
 Â‡ The astral body or Linga Sarira.
 </p><p>
 Â§ Sthula-Upadhi, or basis of the principle.
 </p><p>
 || Buddhi.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 158 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 From the foregoing table it will be seen that the third principle
 in the Buddhist classification is not separately mentioned in
 the Vedantic division, as it is merely the vehicle of Prana. It
 will also be seen that the Fourth principle is included in the
 third Kosa (Sheath), as the same principle is but the vehicle
 of will-power, which is but an energy of the mind. It must also
 be noticed that the Vignanamaya Kosa is considered to be distinct
 from the Manomaya Kosa, as a division is made after death between
 the lower part of the mind, as it were, which has a closer affinity
 with the fourth principle than with the sixth; and its higher
 part, which attaches itself to the latter, and which is, in fact,
 the basis for the higher spiritual individuality of man.
 </p><p>
 We may also here point out to our readers that the classification
 mentioned in the last column is, for all practical purposes, connected
 with Raja Yoga, the best and simplest. Though there are seven
 principles in man, there are but three distinct Upadhis (bases),
 in each of which his Atma may work independently of the rest.
 These three Upadhis can be separated by an Adept without killing
 himself. He cannot separate the seven principles from each other
 without destroying his constitution."
 </p><p>
 The student will now be better prepared to see that between the
 three Upadhis of the Raja Yoga and its Atma, and our three Upadhis,
 Atma, and the additional three divisions, there is in reality
 but very little difference. Moreover, as every adept in cis-Himalayan
 or trans-Himalayan India, of the Patanjali, the Aryasanga or the
 Mahayana schools, has to become a Raja Yogi, he must, therefore,
 accept the Taraka Raja classification in principle and theory
 whatever classification he resorts to for practical and occult
 purposes. Thus, it matters very little whether one speaks of the
 <em>three Upadhis with their three aspects </em>and Atma, the
 eternal and immortal synthesis, or calls them the "seven
 principles."
 </p><p>
 For the benefit of those who may not have read, or, if they have,
 may not have clearly understood, in Theosophical writings, the
 doctrine of the septenary chains of worlds in the Solar Kosmos,
 the teaching is briefly thus: --
 </p><p>
 1. Everything in the metaphysical as in the physical Universe
 is septenary. Hence every sidereal body, every planet, whether
 visible</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 159 THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF THE EGO.</h6>
 
 <p>
 or invisible, is credited with six companion globes. (See Diagram
 No. 3, after verse 6 of this commentary.) The evolution of life
 proceeds on these seven globes or bodies from the 1st to the 7th
 in Seven <strong>R</strong>OUNDS or Seven Cycles.
 </p><p>
 2. These globes are formed by a process which the Occultists call
 the "rebirth of planetary chains (or rings)." When the
 seventh and last Round of one of such rings has been entered upon,
 the highest or first globe "A," followed by all the
 others down to the last, instead of entering upon a certain time
 of rest -- or "obscuration," as in their previous Rounds
 -- begins to die out. The "planetary" dissolution (<em>pralaya</em>)<em>
 </em>is<em> </em>at hand, and its hour has struck; each globe
 has to transfer its life and energy to another planet. (See diagram
 No. 2<em> infra</em>, "The Moon and the Earth.")
 </p><p>
 3. Our Earth, as the visible representative of its invisible superior
 fellow globes, its "lords" or "principles"
 (see diagram No. 1), has to live, as have the others, through
 seven Rounds. During the first three, it forms and consolidates;
 during the fourth it settles and hardens; during the last three
 it gradually returns to its first ethereal form: it is spiritualised,
 so to say.
 </p><p>
 4. Its Humanity develops fully only in the Fourth -- our present
 Round. Up to this fourth Life-Cycle, it is referred to as "humanity"
 only for lack of a more appropriate term. Like the grub which
 becomes chrysalis and butterfly, Man, or rather that which becomes
 man, passes through all the forms and kingdoms during the first
 Round and through all the human shapes during the two following
 Rounds. Arrived on our Earth at the commencement of the Fourth
 in the present series of life-cycles and races, MAN is the first
 form that appears thereon, being preceded only by the mineral
 and vegetable kingdoms -- even the latter <em>having to develop
 and continue its further evolution through man. </em>This will
 be explained in Book II. During the three Rounds to come, Humanity,
 like the globe on which it lives, will be ever tending to reassume
 its primeval form, that of a Dhyan Chohanic Host. Man tends to
 become a God and then -- <strong>G</strong>OD, like every other
 atom in the Universe.
 </p><p>
 "Beginning so early as with the 2nd round, Evolution proceeds
 already on quite a different plan. It is only during the 1st round
 that (heavenly) man becomes a human being on globe A (rebecomes)
 a mineral, a plant, an animal, on globe B and C, etc. The process
 changes</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 160 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 entirely from the second round -- but you have learned prudence
 . . . and I advise you <em>to say nothing before the time for
 saying it has come. </em>. ." (Extract from the Teacher's
 letters on various topics.)
 </p><p>
 5. Every life-cycle on Globe D (our Earth)* is composed of seven
 root-races. They commence with the Ethereal and end with the spiritual
 on the double line of physical and moral evolution -- from the
 beginning of the terrestrial round to its close. (One is a "planetary
 round" from Globe A to Globe G, the seventh; the other, the
 "globe round," or the <em>terrestrial</em>)<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 This is very well described in "Esoteric Buddhism" and
 needs no further elucidation for the time being.
 </p><p>
 6. The first root-race, <em>i.e.</em>, the first "men"
 on earth (irrespective of form) were the progeny of the "celestial
 men," called rightly in Indian philosophy the "Lunar
 Ancestors" or the Pitris, of which there are seven classes
 or Hierarchies. As all this will be sufficiently explained in
 the following sections and in Book II., no more need be said of
 it here.
 </p><p>
 But the two works already mentioned, both of which treat of subjects
 from the occult doctrine, need particular notice. "Esoteric
 Buddhism" is too well known in Theosophical circles, and
 even to the outside world, for it to be necessary to enter at
 length upon its merits here. It is an excellent book, and has
 done still more excellent work. But this does not alter the fact
 that it contains some mistaken notions, and that it has led many
 Theosophists and lay-readers to form an erroneous conception of
 the Secret Eastern Doctrines. Moreover it seems, perhaps, a little
 too materialistic.
 </p><p>
 "<strong>M</strong>AN," which came later, was an attempt
 to present the archaic doctrine from a more ideal standpoint,
 to translate some visions in and from the Astral Light, to render
 some teachings partly gathered from a Master's thoughts, but unfortunately
 misunderstood. This work also speaks of the evolution of the early
 Races of men on Earth, and contains some excellent pages of a
 philosophical character. But so far it is only an interesting
 little mystical romance. It has failed in its mission, because
 the conditions required for a correct translation of these visions
 were not present. Hence the reader must not wonder if our Volumes
 contradict these earlier descriptions in several particulars.
 </p><p>
 [[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </p><p>
 * We are not concerned with the other Globes in this work except
 incidentally.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 161 A RE-ADJUSTMENT OF FACTS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Esoteric "Cosmogony" in general, and the evolution of
 the human Monad especially, differ so essentially in these two
 books and in other Theosophical works written independently by
 <em>beginners</em>, that it becomes impossible to proceed with
 the present work without special mention of these two earlier
 volumes, for both have a number of admirers -- "Esoteric
 Buddhism" especially. The time has arrived for the explanation
 of some matters in this direction. Mistakes have now to be checked
 by the original teachings and corrected. If one of the said works
 has too pronounced a bias toward materialistic science, the other
 is decidedly too idealistic, and is, at times, fantastic.
 </p><p>
 From the doctrine -- rather incomprehensible to western minds
 -- which deals with the periodical "obscurations" and
 successive "Rounds" of the Globes along their circular
 chains, were born the first perplexities and misconceptions. One
 of such has reference to the "<em>Fifth</em>-"<em> </em>and
 even "<em>Sixth</em>-Rounders." Those who knew that
 a Round was preceded and followed by a long <em>Pralaya</em>,<em>
 </em>a pause of rest which created an impassable gulf between
 two Rounds until the time came for a renewed cycle of life, could
 not understand the "fallacy" of talking about "<em>fifth
 </em>and<em> sixth </em>Rounders" in our <em>Fourth </em>Round.
 Gautama Buddha, it was held, was a Sixth-Rounder, Plato and some
 other great philosophers and minds, "Fifth-Rounders."
 How could it be? One Master taught and affirmed that there were
 such "Fifth-Rounders" even now on Earth; and though
 <em>understood to say </em>that mankind was yet "in the Fourth
 Round," in another place he <em>seemed </em>to say that we
 were in the Fifth. To this an "apocalyptic answer" was
 returned by another Teacher: -- "A few drops of rain do not
 make a Monsoon, though they presage it." . . . "No,
 we are not in the Fifth Round, but Fifth Round men have been coming
 in for the last few thousand years." This was worse than
 the riddle of the Sphinx! Students of Occultism subjected their
 brains to the wildest work of speculation. For a considerable
 time they tried to outvie OEdipus and reconcile the two statements.
 And as the Masters kept as silent as the stony Sphinx herself,
 they were accused of inconsistency, "contradiction,"
 and "discrepancies." But they were simply allowing the
 speculations to go on, in order <em>to teach a lesson </em>which
 the Western mind sorely needs. In their conceit and arrogance,
 as in their habit of materializing every metaphysical conception
 and term without allowing any margin for Eastern</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 162 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 metaphor and allegory, the Orientalists have made a jumble of
 the Hindu exoteric philosophy, and the Theosophists were now doing
 the same with regard to esoteric teachings. To this day it is
 evident that the latter have utterly failed to understand the
 meaning of the term "Fifth and Sixth Rounders." But
 it is simply this: every "Round" brings about a new
 development and even an entire change in the mental, psychic,
 spiritual and physical constitution of man, all these principles
 evoluting on an ever ascending scale. Thence it follows that those
 persons who, like Confucius and Plato, belonged psychically, mentally
 and spiritually to the higher planes of evolution, were in our
 Fourth Round as the average man will be in the Fifth Round, whose
 mankind is destined to find itself, on this scale of Evolution,
 immensely higher than is our present humanity. Similarly Gautama
 Buddha -- Wisdom incarnate -- was still higher and greater than
 all the men we have mentioned, who are called Fifth Rounders,
 while Buddha and Sankaracharya are termed Sixth Rounders, allegorically.
 Thence again the concealed wisdom of the remark, pronounced at
 the time "evasive" -- that a few drops of rain do not
 make the Monsoon, <em>though they presage it.</em>"
 </p><p>
 And now the truth of the remark made in "Esoteric Buddhism"
 by its author will be fully apparent: --
 </p><p>
 "It is impossible, <em>when the complicated facts of an entirely
 unfamiliar science are being presented to untrained minds for
 the first time</em>, to put them forward with all their appropriate
 qualifications . . . and abnormal developments. . . . We must
 be content to take the broad rules first and deal with the exceptions
 afterwards, and especially is this the case with study, in connection
 with which <em>the traditional methods of teaching</em>,<em> generally
 followed</em>,<em> aim at impressing every fresh idea on the memory
 by provoking the perplexity it at last relieves.</em>"
 </p><p>
 As the author of the remark was himself, as he says, "an
 untrained mind" in Occultism, his own inferences, and his
 better knowledge of modern astronomical speculations than of archaic
 doctrines led him quite naturally, and as unconsciously to himself,
 to commit a few mistakes of detail rather than of any "broad
 rule." One such will now be noticed. It is a trifling one,
 still it is calculated to lead many a beginner into erroneous
 conceptions. But as the mistaken notions of the earlier editions
 were corrected in the <em>annotations </em>of the fifth edition,
 so the sixth may be revised and perfected. There were several
 reasons</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 163 LIKE QUESTIONS, LIKE ANSWERS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 for such mistakes. (1) They were due to the necessity under which
 the teachers laboured of giving what were considered as "evasive
 answers": the questions being too persistently pressed to
 be left unnoticed, while, on the other hand, they <em>could only
 be partially answered. </em>(2)<em> </em>This position notwithstanding,
 the confession that "half a loaf is better than no bread"
 was but too often misunderstood and hardly appreciated as it ought
 to have been. As a result thereof gratuitous speculations were
 sometimes indulged in by the European lay-chelas. Among such were
 (a) the "Mystery of the Eighth Sphere" in its relation
 to the Moon; and (b) the erroneous statement that two of the superior
 Globes of the terrestrial chain were two of our well-known planets:
 "besides the Earth . . . there are <em>only two other worlds
 of our chain which are visible</em>. . . . Mars and Mercury. .
 . ." (<em>Esoteric Buddhism</em>; p. 136.)
 </p><p>
 This was a great mistake. But the blame for it is to be attached
 as much to the vagueness and incompleteness of the Master's answer
 as to the question of the learner itself, which was equally vague
 and indefinite.
 </p><p>
 It was asked: "What planets, of those known to ordinary science,
 besides Mercury, belong to our system of worlds?" Now if
 by "System of Worlds" our <em>terrestrial chain </em>or
 "string" was intended in the mind of the querist, instead
 of the "Solar System of Worlds," as it should have been,
 then of course the answer was likely to be misunderstood. For
 the reply was: "Mars, etc., and four other planets of which
 astronomy knows nothing. Neither A, B, nor YZ are known nor can
 they be seen through physical means however perfected." This
 is plain: (a) Astronomy as yet knows nothing in reality of the
 planets, neither the ancient ones, nor those discovered in modern
 times. (b) No <em>companion </em>planets from A to Z, <em>i.e.</em>,
 no upper globes of any chain in the Solar System, can be seen.*
 As to Mars, Mercury, and "the four other planets," they

 </p><p>
 Let it now be distinctly stated, then, that the theory broached
 is impossible, with or without the additional evidence furnished
 by modern Astronomy. Physical Science can supply corroborative,
 though still very uncertain, evidence, but only as regards heavenly
 bodies on the same plane of materiality as our objective Universe.
 Mars and Mercury, Venus and Jupiter, like every hitherto discovered
 planet (or those still to be discovered), are all, <em>per se</em>,
 the representatives on our plane of such chains. As distinctly
 stated in one of the numerous letters of Mr. Sinnett's "Teacher,"
 "there are other and innumerable Manvantaric chains of globes
 which bear intelligent Beings both in and outside our solar system."
 But neither Mars nor Mercury belong <em>to our chain. </em>They
 are, along with the other planets, septenary <em>Units </em>in
 the great host of "chains" of our system, and all are
 as visible as their <i>upper</i> globes are invisible.
 </p><p>
 If it is still argued that certain expressions in the Teacher's
 letters were liable to mislead, the answer comes: -- Amen; so
 it was. The author of "Esoteric Buddhism" understood
 it well when he wrote that such are "the traditional modes
 of teaching . . . by provoking the perplexity" . . . they
 <em>do</em>, or<em> do not relieve</em> -- as the case may be.
 At all events, if it is urged that this might have been explained
 earlier, and the true nature of the planets given out as they
 now are, the answer comes that: "it was not found expedient
 to do so at the time, as it would have opened the way to a series
 of additional questions <em>which could never be answered on account
 of their esoteric nature</em>, and thus would only become embarrassing."
 It had been declared from the first and has been repeatedly asserted
 since that (1st) no Theosophist, <em>not even as an accepted</em>
 <em>chela</em> --<em> </em>let alone lay <em>students -- could
 expect to have the secret teachings explained to him thoroughly
 and completely</em>, before<em> he had irretrievably pledged himself
 to the Brotherhood and passed through at least one initiation</em>,<em>
 </em>because no figures and numbers could be given to the public,
 for figures and numbers are the key to the esoteric system. (2.)

 * In this same letter the impossibility is distinctly stated:
 -- . . . "Try to understand that you are putting me questions
 pertaining to the highest initiation; that I can give you (only)
 a general view, but <em>that I dare not nor will I enter upon
 details . </em>. ." wrote one of the Teachers to the author
 of "Esoteric Buddhism."</p><hr>

 what was revealed was merely the esoteric lining of that which
 is contained in almost all the exoteric Scriptures of the world-religions
 -- pre-eminently in the Brahmanas, and the Upanishads of the Vedas
 and even in the Puranas. It was a small portion of what is divulged
 far more fully now in the present volumes; and even this is very
 incomplete and fragmentary.
 </p><p>
 When the present work was commenced, the writer, feeling sure
 that the speculation about Mars and Mercury was a mistake, applied
 to the Teachers <em>by letter </em>for explanation and an authoritative
 version. Both came in due time, and <em>verbatim </em>extracts
 from these are now given.
 </p><p>
 ". . . . . <em>It is quite correct that Mars is in a state
 of obscuration at present</em>,<em> and Mercury just beginning
 to get out of it. You might add that</em> <em>Venus is in her
 last Round.</em> . . . . . . . . . . <em>If neither Mercury nor
 Venus have</em> <em>satellites</em>,<em> it is because of the
 reasons </em>. . . (vide footnote supra, where those reasons are
 given), <em>and also because Mars has two satellites to which
 he has no right</em>. . . . . <em>Phobos</em>,<em> the supposed
 </em>INNER<em> satellite</em>,<em> is no satellite at all. As
 remarked long ago by Laplace and now by Faye </em>(<em>see </em>COMPTES
 RENDUS, <em>Tome </em><strong>XC</strong><em>.</em>,<em> p. 569</em>),
 <em>Phobos keeps a too short periodic time</em>,<em> and therefore
 there </em>'<em>must exist some defect in the mother idea of the
 theory</em>'<em> as Faye justly observes</em>. . . . . <em>Again</em>,<em>
 both </em>(<em>Mars and Mercury</em>)<em> are septenary chains</em>,<em>
 as independent of the Earth</em>'<em>s sidereal lords and superiors
 as you are independent of the </em>'<em>principles</em>'<em> of
 Daumling </em>(<em>Tom Thumb</em>) --<em> which were perhaps his
 six brothers</em>,<em> with or without night-caps. . . . . . .
 . . . </em>'<em>Gratification of curiosity is the end of knowledge
 for some men,' was said by Bacon</em>,<em> who was as right in
 postulating this truism</em>,<em> as those who were familiar with
 it before him were right in hedging off </em><strong>WISDOM</strong><em>
 from Knowledge</em>,<em> and tracing limits to that which is to
 be given out at one time</em>. . . . <em>Remember</em>: --
 </p><blockquote>
 '. . . . . . . . . . . knowledge dwells <br>
 In heads replete with thoughts of other men,<br>
 Wisdom in minds attentive to their own. . . .'
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 <em>You can never impress it too profoundly on the minds of those
 to whom you impart some of the esoteric teachings. . </em>."
 </p><p>
 Again, here are more extracts from another letter written by the
 same authority. This time it is in answer to some objections laid
 before the Teachers. They are based upon extremely scientific,
 and as</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 166 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 futile, reasonings about the advisability of trying to reconcile
 the Esoteric theories with the speculations of Modern Science,
 and were written by a young Theosophist as a warning against the
 "Secret Doctrine" and in reference to the same subject.
 He had declared that if there were such companion Earths "they
 must be only a wee bit less material than our globe." How
 then was it that they could not be seen? The answer was: --
 </p><p>
 ". . . <em>. Were psychic and spiritual teachings more fully
 understood</em>,<em> it would become next to impossible to even
 imagine such an incongruity. Unless less trouble is taken to reconcile
 the irreconcileable</em> --<em> that is to say</em>,<em> the metaphysical
 and spiritual sciences with physical or natural philosophy</em>,<em>
 </em>'<em>natural</em>'<em> being a synonym to them </em>(<em>men
 of science</em>)<em> of that matter which falls under the perception
 of their corporeal senses -- no progress can be really achieved.
 Our Globe</em>,<em> as taught from the first</em>,<em> is at the
 bottom of the arc of descent</em>,<em> where the matter of our
 perceptions exhibits itself in its grossest form</em>. . . . .
 . . <em>Hence it only stands to reason that the globes which overshadow
 our Earth must be on different and superior planes. In short</em>,
 <em>as Globes</em>,<em> they are in </em>CO-ADUNITION <em>but
 not </em>IN CONSUBSTANTIALITY WITH OUR EARTH <em>and thus pertain
 to quite another state of consciousness. Our planet </em>(<em>like
 all those we see</em>)<em> is adapted to the peculiar state of
 its human stock</em>,<em> that state which enables us to see with
 our naked eye the sidereal bodies which are co-essential with
 our terrene plane and substance</em>,<em> just as their respective
 inhabitants</em>,<em> the Jovians</em>,<em> Martians and others
 can perceive our little world: because our planes of consciousness</em>,<em>
 differing as they do in degree but being the same in kind</em>,<em>
 are on the same layer of differentiated matter</em>. . . . . <em>What
 I wrote was </em>'<em>The minor Pralaya concerns only our little
 </em>STRINGS OF GLOBES.' (<em>We called chains </em>'<em>Strings</em>'<em>
 in those days of lip-confusion.</em>)<em> . </em>. <em>. </em>'<em>To
 such a string our Earth belongs.' This ought to have shown plainly
 that the other planets were also </em>'<em>strings</em>'<em> or
 </em><strong>CHAINS</strong><em>. . . If he </em>(<em>meaning
 the objector</em>)<em> would perceive even the dim silhouette
 of one of such </em>'<em>planets</em>'<em> on the higher planes</em>,<em>
 he has to first throw off even the thin clouds of the astral matter
 that stands between him and the next plane</em>. . . . ."
 </p><p>
 It becomes patent why we could not perceive, even with the help
 of the best earthly telescopes, that which is outside our world
 of matter. Those alone, whom we call adepts, who know how to direct
 their mental vision and to transfer their consciousness -- physical
 and psychic both --</p><hr>

 <p>
 to other planes of being, are able to speak with authority on
 such subjects. And they tell us plainly: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>Lead the life necessary for the acquisition of such
 knowledge and powers</em>,<em> and Wisdom will come to you naturally.
 Whenever your are able to attune your consciousness to any of
 the seven chords of </em>'<em>Universal Consciousness</em>,'<em>
 those chords that run along the sounding-board of Kosmos</em>,<em>
 vibrating from one Eternity to another; when you have studied
 thoroughly </em>'<em>the music of the Spheres</em>,'<em> then
 only will you become quite free to share your knowledge with those
 with whom it is safe to do so. Meanwhile</em>,<em> be prudent.
 Do not give out the great Truths that are the inheritance of the
 future Races</em>,<em> to our present generation. Do not attempt
 to unveil the secret of being and non-being to those unable to
 see the hidden meaning of Apollo</em>'<em>s </em>HEPTACHORD --
 <em>the lyre of the radiant god</em>,<em> in each of the seven
 strings of which dwelleth the Spirit</em>,<em> Soul and Astral
 body of the Kosmos</em>,<em> whose shell only has now fallen into
 the hands of Modern Science</em>. . . . . . <em>Be prudent</em>,<em>
 we say</em>,<em> prudent and wise</em>,<em> and above all take
 care what those who learn from you believe in; lest by deceiving
 themselves they deceive others </em>. . . . . <em>for such is
 the fate of every truth with which men are</em>,<em> as yet</em>,<em>
 unfamiliar</em>. . . . <em>Let rather the planetary chains and
 other super-</em> <em>and sub-cosmic mysteries remain a dreamland
 for those who can neither see</em>,<em> nor yet believe that others
 can. . </em>. ."
 </p><p>
 It is to be regretted that few of us have followed the wise advice;
 and that many a priceless pearl, many a jewel of wisdom, has been
 cast to an enemy unable to understand its value and who has turned
 round and rent us.
 </p><p>
 "<em> </em>'<em>Let us imagine</em>,'<em> </em>wrote the
 same Master to his two 'lay chelas,' as he called the author of
 'Esoteric Buddhism' and another gentleman, his co-student for
 some time -- '<em>let us imagine </em>THAT OUR EARTH IS ONE OF
 A GROUP OF SEVEN PLANETS OR MAN-BEARING WORLDS. . . . . . (<em>The
 </em>SEVEN<em> planets are the sacred planets of antiquity</em>,<em>
 and are all septenary.</em>)<em> Now the life-impulse reaches
 A</em>,<em> or rather that which is destined to become A</em>,<em>
 and which so far is but cosmic dust </em>(a "laya centre")
 . . <em>etc.</em>'<em> </em>"
 </p><p>
 In these early letters, in which the terms had to be invented
 and words coined, the "Rings" very often became "Rounds,"
 and the "Rounds" life-cycles, and <em>vice versa. </em>To
 a correspondent who called a "Round" a "World-Ring,"
 the Teacher wrote: "I believe this will lead to a further
 confusion. A Round we are agreed to call the passage</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 168 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 of a monad from Globe A to Globe G or Z. . . The 'World-Ring'
 is correct. . . Advise Mr. . . . strongly, to agree upon a nomenclature
 before going any further. . . "
 </p><p>
 Notwithstanding this agreement, many mistakes, owing to this confusion,
 crept into the earliest teachings. The Races even were occasionally
 mixed up with the "Rounds" and "Rings," and
 led to similar mistakes in "Man." From the first the
 Master had written --
 </p><p>
 "Not being permitted to give you <em>the whole truth</em>,<em>
 </em>or divulge the number of isolated fractions . . . I am unable
 to satisfy you."
 </p><p>
 This in answer to the questions, "If we are right, then the
 total existence prior to the man-period is 637," etc., etc.
 To all the queries relating to figures, the reply was, "Try
 to solve the problem of 777 incarnations. . . . <em>Though I am
 obliged to withhold information </em>. . . <em>yet if you should
 work out the problem by yourself</em>,<em> it will be my duty
 to tell you so</em>."
 </p><p>
 But they never were so worked out, and the results were -- never-ceasing
 perplexity and mistakes.
 </p><p>
 Even the teaching about the Septenary constitution of the sidereal
 bodies and of the macrocosm -- from which the septenary division
 of the microcosm, or Man -- has until now been among the most
 esoteric. In olden times it used to be divulged only at the Initiation
 and along with the most sacred figures of the cycles. Now, as
 stated in one of the Theosophical journals,* the revelation of
 the whole system of Cosmogony had not been contemplated, nor even
 thought for one moment possible, at a time when a few bits of
 information were sparingly given out in answer to letters written
 by the author of "Esoteric Buddhism," in which he put
 forward a multiplicity of questions. Among these were questions
 on such problems <em>as no </em><strong>MASTER</strong>,<em> however
 high and independent he might be</em>,<em> would have the right
 to answer</em>,<em> thus divulging to the world the most time-honoured
 and archaic of the mysteries of the ancient college-temples. </em>Hence
 only a few of the doctrines were revealed in their broad outlines,
 while details were constantly withheld, and all the efforts made
 to elicit more information about them were systematically eluded
 from the beginning. This is perfectly natural. Of the four Vidyas
 -- out of the seven branches of Knowledge mentioned in the Puranas
 -- namely, "Yajna-Vidya" (the performance of religious
 rites in order to

 </h6>
 
 <p>
 produce certain results); "Maha-Vidya," the great (Magic)
 knowledge, now degenerated into Tantrika worship; "Guhya-Vidya,"
 the science of Mantras and their true rhythm or chanting, of mystical
 incantations, etc. -- it is only the last one, "Atma-Vidya,"
 or the true <em>Spiritual </em>and <em>Divine wisdom</em>,<em>
 </em>which can throw absolute and final light upon the teachings
 of the three first named. Without the help of Atma-Vidya, the
 other three remain no better than <em>surface </em>sciences, geometrical
 magnitudes having length and breadth, but no thickness. They are
 like the soul, limbs, and mind of a sleeping man: capable of mechanical
 motions, of chaotic dreams and even sleep-walking, of producing
 visible effects, but stimulated by instinctual not intellectual
 causes, least of all by fully conscious spiritual impulses. A
 good deal can be given out and explained from the three first-named
 sciences. But unless the key to their teachings is furnished by
 Atma-Vidya, they will remain for ever like the fragments of a
 mangled text-book, like the adumbrations of great truths, dimly
 perceived by the most spiritual, but distorted out of all proportion
 by those who would nail every shadow to the wall.
 </p><p>
 Then, again, another great perplexity was created in the minds
 of students by the incomplete exposition of the doctrine of the
 evolution of the Monads. To be fully realised, both this process
 and that of the birth of the Globes must be examined far more
 from their metaphysical aspect than from what one might call a
 statistical standpoint, involving figures and numbers which are
 rarely permitted to be broadly used. Unfortunately, there are
 few who are inclined to handle these doctrines only metaphysically.
 Even the best of the Western writers upon our doctrine declares
 in his work that "on pure metaphysics of that sort we are
 not now engaged," when speaking of the evolution of the Monads
 ("Esoteric Buddhism," p. 46). And in such case, as the
 Teacher remarks in a letter to him, "Why this preaching of
 our doctrines, all this uphill work and swimming <em>in adversum
 flumen? </em>Why should the West . . . learn . . . from the East
 . . . that which can never meet the requirements of the special
 tastes of the aesthetics?" And he draws his correspondent's
 attention "to the formidable difficulties encountered by
 us (the Adepts) in every attempt we make to explain our metaphysics
 to the Western mind."
 </p><p>
 And well he may; for <em>outside </em>of metaphysics no occult
 philosophy, no esotericism is possible. It is like trying to explain
 the aspirations and affections, the love and hatred, the most
 private and sacred workings in</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 170 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 the soul and mind of the living man, by an anatomical description
 of the chest and brain of his dead body.
 </p><p>
 Let us now examine two tenets mentioned above and hardly alluded
 to in "Esoteric Buddhism," and supplement them as far
 as lies in our power.
