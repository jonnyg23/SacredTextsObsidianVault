 COMMENTARY.
 </p><p>
 1. <strong>L</strong>ISTEN, YE <strong>S</strong>ONS OF THE <strong>E</strong>ARTH,
 TO YOUR INSTRUCTORS -- THE <strong>S</strong>ONS OF THE <strong>F</strong>IRE
 (<em>a</em>). <strong>L</strong>EARN THERE IS NEITHER FIRST NOR
 LAST; FOR ALL IS ONE NUMBER, ISSUED FROM NO NUMBER (<em>b</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) These terms, the "Sons of the Fire," the
 "Sons of the Fire-Mist," and the like, require explanation.
 They are connected with a great primordial and universal mystery,
 and it is not easy to make it clear. There is a passage in the
 <em>Bhagavatgita </em>(ch. viii.) wherein Krishna, speaking symbolically
 and <em>esoterically</em>, says:<em> </em>"I will state the
 times (conditions) . . . at which devotees departing (from this
 life) do so never to return (be reborn), or to return (to incarnate
 again). The Fire, the Flame, the day, the bright (lucky) fortnight,
 the six months of the Northern solstice, departing (dying) in
 these, those who know the Brahman (Yogis) go to the Brahman. Smoke,
 night, the dark (unlucky) fortnight, the six months of the Southern
 solstice, (dying) in these, the devotee goes to the lunar light
 (or mansion the astral light also) and returns (is reborn). These
 two paths, bright and dark, are said to be eternal in this world
 (or great kalpa, 'Age'). By the one a man goes never to come back,
 by the other he returns." Now these names, "Fire,"
 "Flame," "Day," the "bright fortnight,"
 etc., as "Smoke," "Night," and so on, leading
 only to the end of the lunar path are incomprehensible without
 a knowledge of Esotericism. These are <em>all names of various
 deities </em>which preside over the Cosmo-psychic Powers. We often
 speak of the Hierarchy of "Flames" (see Book II.) of
 the "Sons of Fire," etc. Sankaracharya the greatest
 of the Esoteric masters of India, says that <em>fire</em> means
 a deity which presides over Time (kala). The able translator of
 Bhagavatgita, Kashinath Trimbak Telang, <strong>M.A</strong>.,
 of Bombay, confesses he has "no clear notion of the meaning
 of these verses" (p. 81, footnote). It seems quite clear,
 on the contrary, to him who knows the occult doctrine. With these
 verses the mystic sense of the solar and lunar symbols are connected:
 the Pitris are <em>lunar </em>deities and our ancestors, because
 they <em>created the physical man.</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 87 THE SEVEN MYSTIC SENSES.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The Agnishwatha, the Kumara (the seven mystic sages), are solar
 deities, though the former are Pitris also; and these are the
 "fashioners of the <em>Inner </em>Man." (See Book II.)
 They are: --
 </p><p>
 "The Sons of Fire" -- because they are the first Beings
 (in the Secret Doctrine they are called "Minds"), evolved
 from Primordial Fire. "The Lord is a consuming Fire"
 (Deuteronomy iv. 24); "The Lord (Christos) shall be revealed
 with his mighty angels in flaming fire" (2 Thessal. i. 7,
 8). The Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles like "cloven
 tongues of fire," (Acts ii. v. 3); Vishnu will return on
 <em>Kalki</em>,<em> </em>the White Horse, as the last Avatar amid
 fire and flames; and <em>Sosiosh </em>will be brought down equally
 on a White Horse in a "tornado of fire." "And I
 saw heaven open and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon
 him . . . . is called the Word of God," (Rev. xix. 13) amid
 flaming Fire. Fire is AEther in its purest form, and hence is
 not regarded as matter, but it is the unity of Aether -- the second
 manifested deity -- in its universality. But there are two "Fires"
 and a distinction is made between them in the Occult teachings.
 The first, or the purely <em>Formless and invisible </em>Fire
 concealed in the <em>Central Spiritual Sun</em>,<em> </em>is spoken
 of as "triple" (metaphysically); while the Fire of the
 manifested Kosmos is Septenary, throughout both the Universe and
 our Solar System. "The fire or knowledge burns up all action
 on the plane of illusion," says the commentary. "Therefore,
 those who have acquired it and are emancipated, are called 'Fires.'
 " Speaking of the <em>seven </em>senses symbolised as <em>Hotris,
 </em>priests, the Brahmana says in <em>Anugita</em>: "Thus
 these <em>seven </em>(senses, smell and taste, and colour, and
 sound, etc., etc.) are the causes of emancipation;" and the
 commentator adds: "It is from these seven from which the
 Self is to be emancipated. 'I' (am here devoid of qualities) must
 mean the Self, not the Brahmana who speaks." ("<em>Sacred
 Books of the East</em>,"<em> </em>ed. by Max Muller, Vol.
 VIII., 278.)
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) The expression "All is One Number, issued from
 No Number" relates again to that universal and philosophical
 tenet just explained in Stanza III. (Comm. 4). That which is absolute
 is of course No Number; but in its later significance it has an
 application in Space as in Time. It means that not only every
 increment of time is part of a larger increment, up to the most
 indefinitely prolonged duration conceivable by the human intellect,
 but also that no manifested thing can</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 88 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 be thought of except as part of a larger whole: the total aggregate
 being the One manifested Universe that issues from the unmanifested
 or Absolute -- called Non-Being or "No-Number," to distinguish
 it from <strong>B</strong>EING or "the One Number."

 (2) <strong>L</strong>EARN WHAT WE, WHO DESCEND FROM THE <strong>P</strong>RIMORDIAL
 <strong>S</strong>EVEN, WE, WHO ARE BORN FROM THE <strong>P</strong>RIMORDIAL
 <strong>F</strong>LAME, HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR <strong>F</strong>ATHERS
 (<em>a</em>).
 </p><p>
 (<strong><i>a</i></strong>) This is explained in Book II., and
 this name, "Primordial Flame," corroborates what is
 said in the first paragraph of the preceding commentary on Stanza
 IV.
 </p><p>
 The distinction between the "Primordial" and the subsequent
 seven Builders is this: The former are the Ray and direct emanation
 of the first "Sacred Four," the <em>Tetraktis, </em>that
 is, the eternally Self-Existent One (Eternal <em>in Essence </em>note
 well, not in manifestation, and distinct from the universal ONE).
 Latent, during Pralaya, and active, during Manvantara, the "Primordial"
 proceed from "Father-Mother" (Spirit-Hyle, or <em>Ilus</em>);
 whereas the other manifested Quaternary and the Seven proceed
 from the Mother alone. It is the latter who is the immaculate
 Virgin-Mother, who is overshadowed, not impregnated, by the Universal
 MYSTERY -- when she emerges from her state of Laya or undifferentiated
 condition. In reality, they are, of course, all one; but their
 aspects on the various planes of being are different. (See Part
 II., "Theogony of the Creative Gods.")
 </p><p>
 The first "Primordial" are the highest Beings on the
 Scale of Existence. They are the Archangels of Christianity, those
 who refuse -- as Michael did in the latter system, and as did
 the eldest "Mind-born sons" of Brahma (Veddhas) -- to
 create or rather to multiply.

 3. <strong>F</strong>ROM THE EFFULGENCY OF LIGHT -- THE RAY OF
 THE EVER-DARKNESS -- SPRUNG IN SPACE THE RE-AWAKENED ENERGIES
 (<em>Dhyan Chohans</em>): THE ONE FROM THE EGG, THE SIX AND THE
 FIVE (<em>a</em>); THEN THE THREE, THE ONE,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 89 THE VEHICLE OF THE UNIVERSE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 THE FOUR, THE ONE, THE FIVE -- THE TWICE SEVEN, THE SUM TOTAL
 (<em>b</em>). AND THESE ARE: THE ESSENCES, THE FLAMES, THE ELEMENTS,
 THE BUILDERS, THE NUMBERS, THE ARUPA (<em>formless</em>)<em>,
 </em>THE RUPA (<em>with bodies</em>),<em> </em>AND THE FORCE OR
 DIVINE MAN -- THE SUM TOTAL. <strong>A</strong>ND FROM THE DIVINE
 MAN EMANATED THE FORMS, THE SPARKS, THE SACRED ANIMALS, AND THE
 MESSENGERS OF THE SACRED FATHERS (<em>the Pitris</em>)<em> </em>WITHIN
 THE HOLY FOUR.*
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>This relates to the sacred Science of the
 Numerals: so sacred, indeed, and so important in the study of
 Occultism that the subject can hardly be skimmed, even in such
 a large work as the present. It is on the Hierarchies and correct
 numbers of these Beings invisible (to us) except upon very rare
 occasions, that the mystery of the whole Universe is built. The<em>
 Kumaras</em>, for instance, are called the "Four" though
 in reality seven in number, because Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana
 and Sanat-Kumara are the chief Vaidhatra (their patronymic name),
 as they spring from the "four-fold mystery." To make
 the whole clearer we have to turn for our illustrations to tenets
 more familiar to some of our readers, namely, the Brahminical.
 </p><p>
 According to Manu, Hiranyagarbha is Brahma <em>the first male
 </em>formed by the undiscernible Causeless CAUSE in a "Golden
 Egg resplendent as the Sun," as states the Hindu Classical
 Dictionary. "Hiranyagarbha" means the golden, or rather
 the "Effulgent Womb" or Egg. The meaning tallies awkwardly
 with the epithet of "male." Surely the esoteric meaning
 of the sentence is clear enough. In the Rig Veda it is said: --
 "<b>T</b>HAT, the one Lord of all beings . . . . the one
 animating principle of gods and man," arose, in the beginning,
 in the Golden Womb, Hiranyagarbha -- which is the Mundane Egg
 or sphere of our Universe. That Being is surely androgynous, and
 the allegory of Brahma separating into two and recreating in one
 of his halves (the female Vach) himself as Viraj, is a proof of
 it.
 </p><p>
 "The One from the Egg, the Six and the Five," give the
 number 1065, the value of the first-born (later on the male and
 female Brahma-Prajapati), who answers to the numbers 7, and 14,
 and 21 respectively. The Prajapati are, like the Sephiroth, only
 seven, including the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * The 4, represented in the Occult numerals by the Tetraktis,
 the Sacred or Perfect Square, is a Sacred Number with the mystics
 of every nation and race. It has one and the same significance
 in Brahmanism, Buddhism, the Kabala and in the Egyptian, Chaldean
 and other numerical systems.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 90 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 synthetic Sephira of the triad from which they spring. Thus from
 Hiranyagarbha or Prajapati, the <em>triune</em> (primeval Vedic
 Trimurti, Agni, Vayu, and Surya), emanate the other seven, or
 again ten, if we separate the first three which exist in one,
 and one in three, all, moreover, being comprehended within that
 one "supreme" Parama, called Guhya or " secret,"
 and Sarvatma, the "Super-Soul." "The seven Lords
 of Being lie concealed in Sarvatma like thoughts in one brain."
 So are the Sephiroth. It is either seven when counting from the
 upper Triad headed by Kether, or ten -- exoterically. In the Mahabharata
 the Prajapati are 21 in number, or ten, six, and five (1065),
 thrice seven.*
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>"The Three, the One, the Four, the
 One, the Five" (in their totality -- twice seven) represent
 31415 -- the numerical hierarchy of the Dhyan-Chohans of various
 orders, and of the inner or circumscribed world.** When placed
 on the boundary of the great circle of "Pass not" (see
 Stanza V.), called also the Dhyanipasa, the "rope of the
 Angels," the "rope" that hedges off the phenomenal
 from the noumenal Kosmos, (not falling within the range of our
 present objective consciousness); this number, when not enlarged
 by permutation and expansion, is ever 31415 anagrammatically and
 Kabalistically, being both the number of the circle and the mystic
 Svastica, the twice seven once more; for whatever way the two
 sets of figures are counted, when added separately, one figure
 after another, whether crossways, from right or from left, they
 will always yield fourteen. Mathematically they represent the
 well-known calculation, namely, that the ratio of the diameter
 to the circumference of a circle is as 1 to 3.1415, or the value
 of the <i> </i>(pi), as this ratio is called -- the symbol being
 always used in

 * In the Kabala the same numbers are a value of Jehovah, viz.,
 1065, since the numerical values of the three letters which compose
 his name -- Jod, Vau and twice He -- are respectively 10 ( <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="MIDDLE">),
 6 ( <img src="sd1-90.gif" align="MIDDLE">) and 5 ( <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="MIDDLE">);
 or again thrice seven, 21. "Ten is the Mother of the Soul,
 for Life and Light are therein united," says Hermes. "For
 number one is born of the Spirit and the number ten from matter
 (chaos, feminine); the unity has made the ten, the ten the unity"
 (<em>Book of the Keys</em>)<em>. </em>By the means of the Temura,
 the anagrammatical method of the Kabala, and the knowledge of
 1065 (21), a universal science may be obtained regarding Kosmos
 and its mysteries" (Rabbi Yogel). The Rabbis regard the numbers
 10, 6, and 5 as the most sacred of all.
 </p><p>
 ** The reader may be told that an American Kabalist has now discovered
 the same number for the Elohim. It came to the Jews from Chaldaea.
 See "Hebrew Metrology" in the Masonic Review, July,
 1885, McMillan Lodge, No. 141.</p><hr>

 <p>
 mathematical formulae to express it. This set of figures must
 have the same meaning, since the 1 : 314,159, and then again 1
 : 3 : 1,415,927 are worked out in the secret calculations to express
 the various cycles and ages of the "first born," or
 311,040,000,000,000 with fractions, and yield the same 13,415
 by a process we are not concerned with at present. And it may
 be shown that Mr. Ralston Skinner, author of <em>The Source of
 Measures</em>,<em> </em>reads the Hebrew word Alhim in the same
 number values, by omitting, as said, the ciphers and by permutation
 -- 13,514: since <img src="sd1-78b.gif" align="MIDDLE"> (a) is
 1 : <img src="sd1-91a.gif" align="MIDDLE"> (l) is 3 (or 30); 
 <img src="sd1-78d.gif" align="MIDDLE"> (h) is 5; <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 (i) 1 for 10; and <img src="sd1-91b.gif" align="MIDDLE"> (m) is
 4 (40), and anagrammatically -- 31,415 as explained by him.
 </p><p>
 Thus, while in the metaphysical world, the circle with the one
 central Point in it has no number, and is called Anupadaka (parentless
 and numberless) -- viz., it can fall under no calculation, --
 in the manifested world the mundane Egg or Circle is circumscribed
 within the groups called the Line, the Triangle, the Pentacle,
 the second Line and the Cube (or 13514); and when the Point having
 generated a Line, thus becomes a diameter which stands for the
 androgynous Logos, then the figures become 31415, or a triangle,
 a line, a cube, the second line, and a pentacle. "When the
 Son separates from the Mother he becomes the Father," the
 diameter standing for Nature, or the feminine principle. Therefore
 it is said: "In the world of being, the one Point fructifies
 the Line -- the Virgin Matrix of Kosmos (the egg-shaped zero)
 -- and the immaculate Mother gives birth to the form that combines
 all forms." Prajapati is called the first procreating male,
 and "his Mother's husband."* This gives the key-note
 to all the later divine sons from immaculate mothers. It is greatly
 corroborated by the significant fact that Anna (the name of the
 Mother of the Virgin Mary) now represented by the Roman Catholic
 church as having given birth to her daughter in an immaculate
 way ("Mary conceived without sin"), is derived from
 the Chaldean Ana, heaven, or Astral Light, Anima Mundi; whence
 Anaitia, Devi-durga, the wife of Siva, is also called Annapurna,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * We find the same expression in Egypt. Mout signifies, for one
 thing, "Mother," and shows the character assigned to
 her in the triad of that country. "She was no less the mother
 than the wife of Ammon, one of the principle titles of the god
 being "the husband of his mother." The goddess Mout,
 or Mut, is addressed as "our lady," the "queen
 of Heaven" and of "the Earth," thus "sharing
 these titles with the other mother goddesses, Isis, Hathor, etc."

 <p>
 and Kanya, the Virgin; "Uma-Kanya" being her esoteric
 name, and meaning the "Virgin of light," Astral Light
 in one of its multitudinous aspects.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) The Devas, Pitris, Rishis; the Suras and the Asuras;
 the Daityas and Adityas; the Danavas and Gandharvas, etc., etc.,
 have all their synonyms in our Secret Doctrine, as well as in
 the Kabala and the Hebrew Angelology; but it is useless to give
 their ancient names, as it would only create confusion. Many of
 these may be also found now, even in the Christian hierarchy of
 divine and celestial powers. All those Thrones and Dominions,
 Virtues and Principalities, Cherubs, Seraphs and demons, the various
 denizens of the Sidereal World, are the modern copies of archaic
 prototypes. The very symbolism in their names, when transliterated
 and arranged in Greek and Latin, are sufficient to show it, as
 will be proved in several cases further on.
 </p><p>
 The "Sacred Animals" are found in the Bible as well
 as in the Kabala, and they have their meaning (a very profound
 one, too) on the page of the origins of Life. In the Sepher Jezirah
 it is stated that "God engraved in the Holy Four the throne
 of his glory, the Ophanim (Wheels or the World-Spheres), the Seraphim,*
 the Sacred Animals, and the ministering angels, and from these
 three (the Air, Water, and Fire or Ether) he formed his habitation."
 Thus was the world made "through three Seraphim -- Sepher,
 Saphar, and Sipur," or "through Number, Numbers, and
 Numbered." With the astronomical key these "Sacred Animals"
 become the signs of the Zodiac.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * This is the literal translation from the IXth and Xth Sections:
 "Ten numbers without what? One: the spirit of the living
 God . . . . who liveth in eternities! Voice and Spirit and Word,
 and this is the Holy Spirit. Two: Spirit out of Spirit. He designed
 and hewed therewith twenty-two letters of foundation, three Mothers
 and seven double and Twelve single, and one spirit out of them.
 Three: Water out of spirit; he designed and hewed with them the
 barren and the void, mud and earth. He designed them as a flowerbed,
 hewed them as a wall, covered them as a paving. Four: Fire out
 of water. He designed and hewed therewith the throne of glory
 and the wheels, and the seraphim and the holy animals and the
 ministering angels, and of the three He founded his dwelling,
 as it is said, He makes his angels spirits and his servants fiery
 flames!" Which words "founded his dwelling" show
 clearly that in the Kabala, as in India, the Deity was considered
 as the Universe, and was not, in his origin, the extra-cosmic
 God he is now.</p><hr>

 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>This Sloka gives again a brief analysis
 of the Hierarchies of the Dhyan Chohans, called Devas (gods) in
 India, or the conscious intelligent powers in Nature. To this
 Hierarchy correspond the actual types into which humanity may
 be divided; for humanity, as a whole, is in reality a materialized
 though as yet imperfect expression thereof. The "army of
 the Voice" is a term closely connected with the mystery of
 Sound and Speech, as an effect and corollary of the cause -- Divine
 Thought. As beautifully expressed by P. Christian, the learned
 author of "The History of Magic" and of "L'Homme
 Rouge des Tuileries," the word spoken by, as well as the
 name of, every individual largely determine his future fate. Why?
 Because --
 </p><blockquote>
 -- "When our Soul (mind) creates or evokes a thought, the
 representative sign of that thought is self-engraved upon the
 astral fluid, which is the receptacle and, so to say, the mirror
 of all the manifestations of being.
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "The sign expresses the thing: the thing is the (hidden or
 occult) virtue of the sign.
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "To pronounce a word is to evoke a thought, and make it present:
 the magnetic potency of the human speech is the commencement of
 every manifestation in the Occult World. To utter a Name is not
 only to define a Being (an Entity), but to place it under and
 condemn it through the emission of the Word (Verbum), to the influence
 of one or more Occult potencies. Things are, for every one of
 us, that which it (the Word) makes them while naming them. The
 Word (Verbum) or the speech of every man is, quite unconsciously
 to himself, a BLESSING or a CURSE; this is why our present ignorance
 about the properties or attributes of the IDEA as well as about
 the attributes and properties of MATTER, is often fatal to us.
 </blockquote>
 
 <h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The literal signification of the word is, among the Eastern
 Occultists of the North, a circular wind, whirlwind; but in this
 instance, it is a term to denote the ceaseless and eternal Cosmic
 Motion; or rather the Force that moves it, which Force is tacitly
 accepted as the Deity but never named. It is the eternal <em>Karana</em>,
 the ever-acting Cause.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 94 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <blockquote>
 "Yes, names (and words) are either BENEFICENT or MALEFICENT;
 they are, in a certain sense, either venomous or health-giving,
 according to the hidden influences attached by Supreme Wisdom
 to their elements, that is to say, to the LETTERS which compose
 them, and the NUMBERS correlative to these letters."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 This is strictly true as an esoteric teaching accepted by all
 the Eastern Schools of Occultism. In the Sanskrit, as also in
 the Hebrew and all other alphabets, every letter has its occult
 meaning and its rationale; it is a cause and an effect of a preceding
 cause and a combination of these very often produces the most
 magical effect. The vowels, especially, contain the most occult
 and formidable potencies. The Mantras (esoterically, magical rather
 than religious) are chanted by the Brahmins and so are the Vedas
 and other Scriptures.
 </p><p>
 The "Army of the Voice," is the prototype of the "Host
 of the Logos," or the "WORD" of the Sepher Jezirah,
 called in the Secret Doctrine "the One Number issued from
 No-Number" -- the One Eternal Principle. The esoteric theogony
 begins with the One, manifested, therefore not eternal in its
 presence and being, if eternal in its essence; the number of the
 numbers and numbered -- the latter proceeding from the Voice,
 the feminine Vach, Satarupa "of the hundred forms,"
 or Nature. It is from this number 10, or creative nature, the
 Mother (the occult cypher, or "nought," ever procreating
 and multiplying in union with the Unit "I," one, or
 the Spirit of Life), that the whole Universe proceeded.
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Anugita </em>a conversation is given (ch. vi., 15)
 between a Brahmana and his wife, on the origin of Speech and its
 occult properties.* The wife asks how Speech came into existence,
 and which was prior to the other, Speech or Mind. The Brahmana
 tells her that the Apana (<em>inspirational breath</em>)<em> </em>becoming
 lord, changes that intelligence, which does not understand Speech
 or Words, into the state of Apana, and thus opens the mind. Thereupon
 he tells her a story, a dialogue between Speech and Mind. "Both
 went to the Self of Being (<em>i.e.</em>, to the individual Higher
 Self, as Nilakantha thinks, to Prajapati, according to the commentator
 Arjuna Misra), and asked him to destroy their doubts and decide
 which of them preceded and was superior to the
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 *<em> Anugita </em>forms part of the Asvamedha Parvan of the "Mahabharata."
 The translator of the Bhagavatgita, edited by Max Muller, regards
 it as a continuation of the Bhagavatgita. Its original is one
 of the oldest <em>Upanishads.</em> </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 95 SPEECH AND MIND.</h6>
 
 <p>
 other. To this the lord said: 'Mind is Superior.' But Speech answered
 the Self of Being, by saying: 'I verily yield (you) your desires,'
 meaning that by speech he acquired what he desired. Thereupon
 again, the Self told her that there are two minds, the 'movable'
 and the 'immovable.' 'The immovable is with me,' he said, 'the
 movable is in your dominion' (<em>i.e. </em>of Speech) on the
 plane of matter. To that you are superior. But inasmuch, O beautiful
 one, as you came personally to speak to me (in the way you did,
 <em>i.e.</em> proudly), therefore, O, Sarasvati! you shall never
 speak after (hard) exhalation." "The goddess Speech"
 (Sarasvati, a later form or aspect of Vach, the goddess also of
 secret learning or Esoteric Wisdom), "verily, dwelt always
 between the Prana and the Apana. But O noble one! going with the
 Apana wind (vital air), though impelled, without the Prana (expirational
 breath), she ran up to Prajapati (Brahma), saying, 'Be pleased,
 O venerable sir!' Then the Prana appeared again, nourishing Speech.
 And, therefore, Speech never speaks after (hard or inspirational)
 exhalation. It is always noisy or noiseless. Of these two, the
 noiseless is the superior to the noisy (Speech) . . . . The (speech)
 which is produced in the body by means of the Prana, and which
 then goes (is transformed) into Apana, and then becoming assimilated
 with the Udana (physical organs of Speech) . . . then finally
 dwells in the Samana ('at the navel in the form of sound, as the
 material cause of all words,' says Arjuna Misra). So Speech formerly
 spoke. Hence the mind is distinguished by reason of its being
 immovable, and the Goddess (Speech) by reason of her being movable."
 </p><p>
 This allegory is at the root of the Occult law, which prescribes
 silence upon the knowledge of certain secret and invisible things
 perceptible only to the spiritual mind (the 6th sense), and which
 cannot be expressed by "noisy" or uttered speech. This
 chapter of <em>Anugita </em>explains, says Arjuna Misra, Pranayama,
 or regulation of the breath in Yoga practices. This mode, however,
 without the previous acquisition of, or at least full understanding
 of the two higher senses, of which there are seven, as will be
 shown, pertains rather to the lower Yoga. The <em>Hatha </em>so
 called was and still is discountenanced by the Arhats. It is injurious
 to the health and alone can never develop into Raj Yoga. This
 story is quoted to show how inseparably connected are, in the
 metaphysics of old, intelligent beings, or rather "Intelligences,"
 with every sense or</p><hr>

 <p>
 function whether physical or mental. The Occult claim that there
 are seven senses in man, as in nature, as there are seven states
 of consciousness, is corroborated in the same work, chapter vii.,
 on Pratyahara (the restraint and regulation of the senses, Pranayama
 being that of the "vital winds" or breath). The Brahmana
 speaks in it "of the institution of the seven sacrificial
 Priests (Hotris). He says: "The nose and the eyes, and the
 tongue, and the skin and the ear as the fifth (or smell, sight,
 taste, touch and hearing), mind and understanding are the seven
 sacrificial priests separately stationed"; and which "dwelling
 in a minute space (still) do not perceive each other" on
 this sensuous plane, none of them except mind. For mind says:
 "The nose smells not without me, the eye does not take in
 colour, etc., etc. I am the eternal chief among all elements (<em>i.e.</em>,
 senses). Without me, the senses never shine, like an empty dwelling,
 or like fires the flames of which are extinct. Without me, all
 beings, like fuel half dried and half moist, fail to apprehend
 qualities or objects even with the senses exerting themselves."*
 </p><p>
 This, of course, with regard only to <em>mind on the sensuous
 plane. </em>Spiritual mind (the upper portion or aspect of the
 <em>impersonal </em>MANAS) takes no cognisance of the senses in
 physical man. How well the ancients were acquainted with the correlation
 of forces and all the recently discovered phenomena of mental
 and physical faculties and functions, with many more mysteries
 also -- may be found in reading chapters vii. and viii. of this
 (in philosophy and mystic learning) priceless work. See the quarrel
 of the senses about their respective superiority and their taking
 the Brahman, the lord of all creatures, for their arbiter. "You
 are all greatest and not greatest," or superior to objects,
 as A. Misra says, none being independent of the other. "You
 are all possessed of one another's qualities. All are greatest
 in their own spheres and all support one another. There is one
 unmoving (life-wind or breath, the '<em>Yoga inhalation,</em>'<em>
 </em>so called, which is the breath of the <i>One </i>or Higher
 <strong>S</strong>ELF). That is the (or my) own Self, accumulated
 in numerous (forms)."
 </p><p>
 This Breath, Voice, Self or "Wind" (<em>pneuma?</em>)<em>
 </em>is the Synthesis of the Seven Senses, <em>noumenally </em>all
 minor deities and esoterically -- the <em>septenary </em>and the
 "Army of the <strong>V</strong>OICE."

 (<em>b</em>)<em> </em>Next we see Cosmic matter scattering and
 forming itself into elements; grouped into the mystic four within
 the fifth element -- Ether, the lining of Akasa, the Anima Mundi
 or Mother of Kosmos. "Dots, Lines, Triangles, Cubes, Circles"
 and finally "Spheres" -- why or how? Because, says the
 Commentary, such is the first law of Nature, and because Nature
 geometrizes universally in all her manifestations. There is an
 inherent law -- not only in the primordial, but also in the manifested
 matter of our phenomenal plane -- by which Nature correlates her
 geometrical forms, and later, also, her compound elements; and
 in which there is no place for accident or chance. It is a fundamental
 law in Occultism, that there is no rest or cessation of motion
 in Nature.* That which seems rest is only the change of one form
 into another; the change of substance going hand in hand with
 that of form -- as we are taught in Occult physics, which thus
 seem to have anticipated the discovery of the "Conservation
 of matter" by a considerable time. Says the ancient Commentary**
 to Stanza IV.: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>The Mother is the fiery Fish of Life. She scatters her
 spawn and the Breath </em>(<em>Motion</em>)<em> heats and quickens
 it. The grains </em>(<em>of spawn</em>)<em> are soon attracted
 to each other and form the curds in the Ocean </em>(<em>of Space</em>)<em>.
 The larger lumps coalesce and receive new spawn -- in fiery dots,
 triangles and cubes, which ripen, and at the appointed time some
 of the lumps detach themselves and assume spheroidal form, a process
 which they effect only when not interfered with by the others.
 After which, law No. </em>* * *<em> comes into operation. Motion
 </em>(<em>the Breath</em>)<em> becomes the whirlwind and sets
 them into rotation.</em>"<em>***</em>

 that the advocates of this (nebular) theory have not entered more
 largely into the discussion of it (the beginning of rotation).
 No one condescends to give us the<em> rationale </em>of it. How
 does the process of cooling and contracting the mass impart to
 it a rotatory motion?" The question is amply treated in the
 Addendum. It is not materialistic science that can ever solve
 it. "Motion is eternal in the unmanifested, and periodical
 in the manifest," says an Occult teaching. It is "when

 Svabhavat is the mystic Essence, the plastic root of physical
 Nature -- "Numbers" when manifested; the Number, in
 its Unity of Substance, on the highest plane. The name is of Buddhist

 Monotheists into One, as the "Elohim," Adam Kadmon or
 Sephira -- the Crown -- are the androgyne synthesis of the 10
 Sephiroth, who stand for the symbol of the manifested Universe
 in the popularised Kabala. The esoteric Kabalists, however, following
 the Eastern Occultists, divide the upper Sephirothal triangle
 from the rest (or Sephira, Chochmah and Binah), which leaves seven
 Sephiroth. As for Svabhavat, the Orientalists explain the term
 as meaning the Universal plastic matter diffused through Space,
 with, perhaps, half an eye to the Ether of Science. But the Occultists
 identify it with "FATHER-MOTHER" on the mystic plane.

 with the Jews and Christians, Gods, with the Ancients in general.

 (<em>b</em>) <img src="sd1-4a.jpg" align="MIDDLE"> This means
 that the "Boundless Circle" (Zero) becomes a figure
 or number, only when one of the nine figures precedes it, and
 thus manifests its value and potency, the Word or Logos in union
 with VOICE and Spirit* (the expression and source of Consciousness)
 standing for the nine figures and thus forming, with the Cypher,
 the Decade which contains in itself all the Universe. The triad
 forms within the circle the Tetraktis or Sacred Four, the Square
 within the Circle being the most potent of all the magical figures.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) The "One Rejected" is the Sun of our system.
 The exoteric version may be found in the oldest Sanskrit Scriptures.
 In the Rig Veda, Aditi, "The Boundless" or infinite
 Space, translated by Mr. Max Muller, "the visible infinite,
 visible by the naked eye (!!); the endless expanse beyond the
 Earth, beyond the clouds, beyond the sky," is the equivalent
 of "Mother-Space" coeval with "Darkness."
 She is very properly called "The Mother of the Gods,"
 <strong>D</strong>EVA-<strong>M</strong>ATRI, as it is from her
 Cosmic matrix that all the heavenly bodies of our system were
 born -- Sun and Planets. Thus she is described, allegorically,
 in this wise: "Eight Sons were born from the body of Aditi;
 she approached the gods with seven, but cast away the eighth,
 Martanda," our sun. The seven sons called the Aditya are,
 cosmically or astronomically, the seven planets; and the Sun being
 excluded from their number shows plainly that the Hindus may have
 known, and in fact knew of a seventh planet, without calling it
 Uranus.** But esoterically and theologically,

 * "In union with the Spirit and the Voice," referring
 to the Abstract Thought and concrete Voice, or the manifestation
 thereof, the effect of the Cause. Adam Kadmon or Tetragrammaton
 is the Logos in the Kabala; therefore this triad answers in the
 latter to the highest triangle of Kether, Chochmah and Binah,
 the last a female potency and at the same time the male Jehovah,
 as partaking of the nature of Chochmah, or the male Wisdom.
 </p><p>
 ** The Secret Doctrine teaches that the Sun is a central Star
 and not a planet. Yet the Ancients knew of and worshipped seven
 great gods, excluding the Sun and Earth. Which was that "Mystery
 God" they set apart? Of course not Uranus, discovered only
 by Herschel in 1781. But could it not be known by another name?

 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 100 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </h6>
 
 <p>
 so to say, the Adityas are, in their primitive most ancient meanings,
 the eight, and the twelve great gods of the Hindu Pantheon. "The
 Seven allow the mortals to see their dwellings, but show themselves
 only to the Arhats," says an old proverb, "their dwellings"
 standing here for planets. The ancient Commentary gives an allegory
 and explains it: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>Eight houses were built by Mother. Eight houses for
 her Eight Divine sons; four large and four small ones. Eight brilliant
 suns, according to their age and merits. Bal-ilu </em>(<em>Martanda</em>)<em>
 was not satisfied, though his house was the largest. He began
 </em>(<em>to work</em>)<em> as the huge elephants do. He breathed
 </em>(<em>drew in</em>)<em> into his stomach the vital airs of
 his brothers. He sought to devour them. The larger four were far
 away; far, on the margin of their kingdom.* They were not robbed
 </em>(<em>affected</em>)<em>, and laughed. Do your worst, Sir,
 you cannot reach us, they said. But the smaller wept. They complained
 to the Mother. She exiled Bal-i-lu to the centre of her Kingdom,
 from whence he could not move. </em>(<em>Since then</em>)<em>
 he </em>(<em>only</em>)<em> watches and threatens. He pursues
 them, turning slowly around himself, they turning swiftly from
 him, and he following from afar the direction in which his brothers
 move on the path that encircles their houses.** From that day
 he feeds on the sweat of the Mother</em>'<em>s body. He fills
 himself with her breath and refuse. Therefore, she rejected him.</em>"
 </p><p>
 Thus the "rejected Son" being our Sun, evidently, as
 shown above, the "Sun-Sons" refer not only to our planets
 but to the heavenly bodies in general. Himself only a reflection
 of the Central Spiritual Sun, <em>Surya </em>is the prototype
 of all those bodies that evolved after him. In the Vedas he is
 called <em>Loka-Chakshuh, </em>"the Eye of the World"

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] author of "Maconnerie
 Occulte": -- "Occult Sciences having discovered through
 astronomical calculations that the number of the planets must
 be seven, the ancients were led to introduce the Sun into the
 scale of the celestial harmonies, and make him occupy the vacant
 place. Thus, every time they perceived an influence that pertained
 to none of the six planets known, they attributed it to the Sun.
 The error only seems important, but was not so in practical results,
 if the ancient astrologers replaced Uranus by the Sun, which is
 a central Star relatively motionless, turning only on its axis
 and regulating time and measure; and which cannot be turned aside
 from its true functions." . . . . . . The nomenclature of
 the days of the week is thus faulty. "The Sun-Day ought to
 be Uranus-day (Urani dies, Urandi)," adds the learned writer,
 Ragon.

 planetary world), and he is one of the three chief deities. He
 is called indifferently the Son of <em>Dyaus </em>and of <em>Aditi,
 </em>because no distinction is made with reference to, or scope
 allowed for, the esoteric meaning. Thus he is depicted as drawn
 by seven horses, and by one horse with seven heads; the former
 referring to his seven planets, the latter to their one common
 origin from the One Cosmic Element. This "One Element"
 is called figuratively "<strong>F</strong>IRE." The
 Vedas (Aitareya-Brahmana of Haug also; p. i) teach "that
 the fire verily is all the deities." (Narada in Anugita).
 </p><p>
 The meaning of the allegory is plain, for we have both the Dzyan
 Commentary and modern science to explain it, though the two differ
 in more than one particular. The Occult Doctrine rejects the hypothesis
 born out of the Nebular Theory, that the (seven) great planets
 have evolved from the Sun's central mass, not of this our visible
 Sun, at any rate. The first condensation of Cosmic matter of course
 took place about a central nucleus, its parent Sun; but our sun,
 it is taught, merely detached itself earlier than all the others,
 as the rotating mass contracted, and is their elder, bigger brother
 therefore, not their father. The eight Adityas, "the gods,"
 are all formed from the eternal substance (Cometary matter* --
 the Mother) or the "World-Stuff " which is both the
 fifth and the sixth COSMIC Principle, the Upadhi or basis of the
 Universal Soul, just as in man, the Microcosm, Manas** is the
 Upadhi of Buddhi.***
 </p><p>
 (<em>d</em>) There is a whole poem on the pregenetic battles fought
 by the growing planets before the final formation of Kosmos, thus
 accounting for the seemingly disturbed position of the systems
 of several planets, the plane of the satellites of some (of Neptune
 and Uranus, for instance, of which the ancients knew nothing,
 it is said) being tilted over, thus giving them an appearance
 of retrograde motion. These planets are called the warriors, the
 Architects, and are accepted by the

 * This Essence of Cometary matter, Occult Science teaches, is
 totally different from any of the chemical or physical characteristics
 with which modern science is acquainted. It is homogeneous in
 its primitive form beyond the Solar Systems, and differentiates
 entirely once it crosses the boundaries of our Earth's region,
 vitiated by the atmospheres of the planets and the already compound
 matter of the interplanetary stuff, heterogeneous only in our
 manifested world.

 Roman Church as the leaders of the heavenly Hosts, thus showing
 the same traditions. Having evolved from Cosmic Space, and before
 the final formation of the primaries and the annulation of the
 planetary nebula, the Sun, we are taught, drew into the depths
 of its mass all the Cosmic vitality he could, threatening to engulf
 his weaker "brothers" before the law of attraction and
 repulsion was finally adjusted; after which he began feeding on
 "The Mother's refuse and sweat"; in other words, on
 those portions of Ether (the "breath of the Universal Soul")
 of the existence and constitution of which science is as yet absolutely
 ignorant. A theory of this kind having been propounded by Sir
 William Grove (see "<em>Correlation of the Physical Forces</em>,"<em>
 </em>1843, p. 81; and "<em>Address to the British Association</em>,<em>
 </em>1866"), who theorized that the systems "are gradually
 changing by atmospheric additions or subtractions, or by accretions
 and diminutions arising from nebular substances" . . . and
 again that "the Sun may condense gaseous matter as it travels
 in Space and so heat may be produced" -- the archaic teaching
 seems scientific enough, even in this age.* Mr. W. Mattieu Williams
 suggested that the diffused matter or Ether which is the recipient
 of the heat radiations of the Universe is thereby drawn into the
 depths of the solar mass. Expelling thence the previously condensed
 and thermally exhausted Ether, it becomes compressed and gives
 up its heat, to be in turn itself driven out in a rarified and
 cooled state, to absorb a fresh supply of heat, which he supposes
 to be in this way taken up by the Ether, and again concentrated
 and redistributed by the Suns of the Universe.**
 </p><p>
 This is about as close an approximation to the Occult teachings
 as Science ever imagined; for Occultism explains it by "the
 dead breath" given back by Martanda and his feeding on the
 "sweat and refuse" of "Mother Space." What

 *** When we speak of Neptune it is not as an Occultist but as
 a European. The true Eastern Occultist will maintain that, whereas
 there are many yet undiscovered planets in our system, Neptune
 does not belong to it, his apparent connection with our sun and
 the influence of the latter upon Neptune notwithstanding. This
 connection is <em>mayavic</em>, imaginary, they say.</p><hr>

 but little, would have killed such comparatively small "Houses"
 as Mercury, Venus and Mars. As Uranus was not known before the
 end of the eighteenth century, the name of the fourth planet mentioned
 in the allegory must remain to us, so far, a mystery.
 </p><p>
 The "Breath" of all the "seven" is said to
 be Bhaskara (light-making), because they (the planets) were all
 comets and suns in their origin. They evolve into Manvantaric
 life from primaeval Chaos (now the noumenon of irresolvable nebulae)
 by aggregation and accumulation of the primary differentiations
 of the eternal matter, according to the beautiful expression in
 the Commentary, "Thus the Sons of Light clothed themselves
 in the fabric of Darkness." They are called allegorically
 "the Heavenly Snails," on account of their (to us) formless
 INTELLIGENCES inhabiting unseen their starry and planetary homes,
 and, so to speak, carrying them as the snails do along with themselves
 in their revolution. The doctrine of a common origin for all the
 heavenly bodies and planets, was, as we see, inculcated by the
 Archaic astronomers, before Kepler, Newton, Leibnitz, Kant, Herschel
 and Laplace. Heat (the Breath), attraction and repulsion -- the
 three great factors of Motion -- are the conditions under which
 all the members of all this primitive family are born, developed,
 and die, to be reborn after a "Night of Brahma," during
 which eternal matter relapses periodically into its primary undifferentiated
 state. The most attenuated gases can give no idea of its nature
 to the modern physicist. Centres of Forces at first, the invisible
 sparks of primordial atoms differentiate into molecules, and become
 Suns -- passing gradually into objectivity gaseous, radiant, cosmic,
 the one "Whirlwind" (or motion) finally giving the impulse
 to the form, and the initial motion, regulated and sustained by
 the never-resting Breaths -- the Dhyan Chohans.

 "Scribes."* Mystically, these Divine Beings are connected
 with Karma, the Law of Retribution, for they are the Recorders
 or Annalists who impress on the (to us) invisible tablets of the
 Astral Light, "the great picture-gallery of eternity"
 -- a faithful record of every act, and even thought, of man, of
 all that was, is, or ever will be, in the phenomenal Universe.
 As said in "<em>Isis</em>,"<em> </em>this divine and
 unseen canvas is the <strong>B</strong>OOK OF <strong>L</strong>IFE.
 As it is the Lipika who project into objectivity from the passive
 Universal Mind the ideal plan of the universe, upon which the
 "Builders" reconstruct the Kosmos after every Pralaya,
 it is they who stand parallel to the Seven Angels of the Presence,
 whom the Christians recognise in the Seven "Planetary Spirits"
 or the "Spirits of the Stars;" for thus it is they who
 are the direct amanuenses of the Eternal Ideation -- or, as called
 by Plato, the "Divine Thought." The Eternal Record is
 no fantastic dream, for we meet with the same records in the world
 of gross matter. "A shadow never falls upon a wall without
 leaving thereupon a permanent trace which might be made visible
 by resorting to proper processes," says Dr. Draper. . . .
 "The portraits of our friends or landscape-views may be hidden
 on the sensitive surface from the eye, but they are ready to make
 their appearance as soon as proper developers are resorted to.
 A spectre is concealed on a silver or a glassy surface, until,
 by our necromancy, we make it come forth into the visible world.
 Upon the walls of our most private apartments, where we think
 the eye of intrusion is altogether shut out, and our retirement
 can never be profaned, there exist the vestiges of all our acts,
 silhouettes of whatever we have done."** Drs. Jevons and
 Babbage believe that every thought, displacing the particles of
 the brain and setting them in motion, scatters them throughout
 the Universe, and they think that "each particle of the existing
 matter must be a register of all that has happened." (Principles
 of Science, Vol. II. p. 455.) Thus the ancient doctrine has begun
 to acquire rights of citizenship in the speculations of the scientific
 world.

 called Agra-Sandhani; the "Assessors" who read theirs
 from the heart of the defunct, which becomes an open book before

 of, and variants from the Lipika, and their Astral Records. Nevertheless,
 the Lipi-ka are not deities connected with Death, but with Life
 Eternal.

 Connected as the Lipika are with the destiny of every man and
 the birth of every child, whose life is already traced in the
 Astral Light not fatalistically, but only because the future,
 like the PAST, is ever alive in the PRESENT -- they may also be
 said to exercise an influence on the Science of Horoscopy. We
 must admit the truth of the latter whether we will or not. For,
 as observed by one of the modern adepts of Astrology, "Now
 that photography has revealed to us the chemical influence of
 the Sidereal system, by fixing on the sensitized plate of the
 apparatus milliards of stars and planets that had hitherto baffled
 the efforts of the most powerful telescopes to discover them,
 it becomes easier to understand how our solar system can, at the
 birth of a child, influence his brain -- virgin of any impression
 -- in a definite manner and according to the presence on the zenith
 of such or another zodiacal constellation."*
