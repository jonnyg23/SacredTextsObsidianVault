 <p>
 We have to go to the very source of historical information, if
 we would bring our best evidence to testify to the facts enunciated.
 For, though entirely allegorical, the Rig-Vedic hymns are none
 the less suggestive. The seven rays of Surya (the Sun) are made
 therein parallel to the Seven Worlds (of every planetary chain),
 to the seven rivers of heaven and earth, the former being the
 seven creative Hosts, and the latter the Seven men, or primitive
 human groups. The Seven ancient Rishis -- the progenitors of all
 that lives and breathes on earth -- are the seven friends of Agni,
 his seven "horses," or seven "<strong>H</strong>EADS."
 The human race has sprung from fire and water, it is allegorically
 stated; fashioned by the <strong>F</strong>ATHERS, or the ancestor-sacrificers,
 from Agni; for Agni, the Aswins, the Adityas (<em>Rig-Veda III.,
 </em>54, 16, <em>II.,</em> 29<em>, </em>3, 4), are all synonymous
 with that "sacrificer," or the fathers, variously called
 <em>Pitar </em>(<em>Pitris, </em>fathers)<em>,</em> Angirases<em>**
 </em>(<em>Ibid,</em> 1<em>, </em>31, 17, 139, <em>et seq.</em>)<em>,
 </em>the <em>Sadhyas, </em>"divine sacrificers," the
 most occult of all. They are all called <em>deva putra rishayah
 </em>or "the Sons of God" (<em>X.,</em> 62<em>; </em>1,
 4). The "sacrificers," moreover, are collectively the
 ONE sacrificer, the father of the gods, Visvakarman, who performed
 the great Sarva-Medha ceremony, and ended by sacrificing himself.
 (See Rig-Vedic Hymns.)

 ** Prof. Roth (in Peter's Lexicon) defines the Angirases as an
 intermediate race of higher beings between gods and men; while
 Prof. Weber, according to his invariable custom of modernising
 and anthropomorphising the divine, sees in them the original priests
 of the religion which was common to the Aryan Hindus and Persians.
 Roth is right. "Angirases" was one of the names of the
 Dhyanis, or Devas <em>instructors </em>("guru-deva"),
 of the late Third, the Fourth, and even of the Fifth Race Initiates.
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 606 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 In these Hymns the "Heavenly Man" is called<em> purusha,
 </em>"the Man," (<em>X. </em>90, 1) from whom Viraj
 was born (<i>X.</i> 90, 5); and from Viraj, the (mortal) man.
 It is Varuna (now drawn from his sublime position to be the chief
 of the lords-Dhyanis or Devas) who regulates all natural phenomena,
 who "makes a path for the Sun, for him to follow." The
 seven rivers of the sky (the descending creative gods) and the
 seven rivers of the earth (the seven primitive mankinds) are under
 his control, as will be seen. For he who breaks Varuna's laws
 (Vratani, "courses of natural action," active laws)
 is punished by Indra (<i>X</i>. 113, 5), the Vedic powerful god,
 whose <em>Vrata</em> (law or power) is greater than the <em>Vratani
 </em>of any other god.
 </p><p>
 Thus, the Rig Veda, the oldest of <em>all</em> <em>the known </em>ancient
 records, may be shown to corroborate the occult teachings in almost
 every respect. Its hymns -- the records written by the earliest
 Initiates of the Fifth (our race) concerning the primordial teachings
 -- speak of the Seven Races (two still to come) allegorising them
 by the "seven streams" (1, 35, 8); and of the Five Races
 ("<em>panca krishtayah</em>")<em> </em>which have already
 inhabited this world (<em>ibid</em>)<em> </em>on the five regions
 "<em>panca pradicah</em>"<em> </em>(<em>IX, </em>86,
 29), as also of the <em>three continents </em>that were.*
 </p><p>
 It is those scholars only who will master the secret meaning of
 the <em>Purushasukta </em>(in which the intuition of the modern
 Orientalist has chosen to see "one of the very latest hymns
 of the Rig-Veda"), who may hope to understand how harmonious
 are its teachings and how corroborative of the Esoteric doctrines.
 One must study in all the abstruseness of their metaphysical meaning
 the relations in it between the (Heavenly) man "Purusha,"
 <strong>S</strong>ACRIFICED for the production of the Universe
 and all in it (<em>See Visvakarman</em>)<em>, </em>and the terrestrial
 mortal man (<em>Hymn X. 20, </em>1, 16), before one realizes the
 hidden philosophy of this verse: --
 </p><p>
 "15. He ("Man," <em>purusha, </em>or Visvakarman)
 had seven enclosing logs of fuel, and <em>thrice seven </em>layers
 of fuel; when the gods performed the sacrifice, they bound the
 Man as victim" . . . . This relates to the three Septenary
 primeval Races, and shows the antiquity of the Vedas, who knew
 of no other, probably in this earliest <em>oral</em> teachings;
 and also
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Three submerged, or otherwise destroyed, continents -- the first
 "continent" of the First Race prevailing to the last
 and existing to this day -- are described in the occult Doctrine,
 the <em>Hyperborean, </em>the <em>Lemurian </em>(adopting the
 name now known in Science), and the <em>Atlantean</em>. Most of
 Asia issued from under the waters after the destruction of Atlantis;
 Africa came still later, while Europe is the fifth and the latest
 -- portions of the two Americas being far older. But of these,
 more anon. The Initiates who recorded the Vedas -- or the Rishis
 of our Fifth Race -- wrote at a time when Atlantis had already
 gone down. Atlantis is the fourth continent that <em>appeared</em>,
 but <em>the third that disappeared.</em> </p><hr>

 </h6>
 
 <p>
 to the seven primeval groups of mankind, as Visvakarman represents
 divine humanity collectively.*
 </p><p>
 The same doctrine is found reflected in the other old religions.
 It may, and must have come down to us disfigured and misinterpreted,
 as in the case of the Parsis, who read it in their Vendidad and
 elsewhere, without understanding the allusions they contain any
 better than the Orientalists do; yet the doctrine is plainly mentioned
 in their old works. (See the enumeration of the seven <em>spheres
 </em>--not the "<em>Karshvare of the</em> <em>earth,</em>"<em>
 </em>as believed -- in Fargard <strong>XIX</strong>., 30). But
 see further on.
 </p><p>
 Comparing the esoteric teaching with the interpretations by James
 Darmesteter (the Vendidad, edited by Prof. Max Muller), one may
 see at a glance where the mistake is made, and the cause that
 produced it. The passage runs thus: --
 </p><p>
 "The Indo-Iranian Asura (Ahura) <em>was often conceived as
 seven-fold;</em> by the play of certain mythical (?) formulae
 and the strength of certain <em>mythical </em>(?) numbers, the
 ancestors of the Indo-Iranians had been led to speak <em>of seven
 worlds,</em>**<em> </em>and the Supreme God was often made seven-fold,
 as well as the worlds over which he ruled." (<em>Vide the
 foot note</em>)<em>. </em>"The seven worlds became in Persia
 the seven <em>Karshvare </em>of the earth: the earth is divided
 into seven Karshvare, <em>only one of which is known and</em>
 <em>accessible to man, </em>the one on which we live, namely,
 <em>Hvaniratha; </em>which amounts to saying <em>that there are
 seven earths.*** </em>Parsi mythology knows also of seven heavens.
 Hvaniratha itself is divided into seven climes. (Orm. Ahr. ยง
 72. "<em>Vendidad Introd. p.</em> Lx.,)" and the same
 division and doctrine is to be found in the oldest and most revered
 of the Hindu
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Nor is this archaic teaching so very <em>unscientific, </em>since
 one of the greatest naturalists of the age -- the late Professor
 Agassiz -- admitted the multiplicity of the geographical origins
 of man, and supported it to the end of his life. The unity of
 the human species was accepted by the illustrious Professor of
 Cambridge (U.S.A.) in the same way as the Occultists do -- namely,
 in the sense of their essential and original homogeneity and their
 origin from one and the same source: -- <em>e.g</em>., Negroes,
 Aryans, Mongols, etc., have all originated in the same way and
 from the same ancestors. The latter were all of one essence, yet
 differentiated, because belonging to seven planes which differed
 in degree though not in kind. That original physical difference
 was but little more accentuated by that of geographical and climatic
 conditions, later on. This is not the theory of Agassiz, of course,
 but the esoteric version. It is fully discussed in the <em>Addenda</em>
 (Part <strong>III.</strong>).
 </p><p>
 ** The seven worlds are, as said, the seven spheres of the chain,
 each presided over by one of the "Seven great gods"
 of every religion. When the latter became degraded and anthropomorphized,
 and the metaphysical ideas nearly forgotten, the synthesis or
 the highest, the seventh, was separated from the rest, and that
 personification became the <em>eighth </em>god, whom monotheism
 tried to unify but -- failed. In no exoteric religion is God really
 one, if analyzed metaphysically.
 </p><p>
 *** The six invisible globes of our chain are both "worlds"
 and "earths" as is our own, albeit invisible. But where
 could be the Six invisible <em>earths </em>on<em> this </em>globe?
 </p><hr>

 <p>
 scriptures -- the Rig-veda. Mention is made therein of six worlds,
 <em>besides our earth: </em>the six <em>rajamsi </em>above<em>
 prithivi -- </em>the earth, -- or "this" (idam) as opposed
 to that which is <em>yonder </em>(<em>i.e., </em>the six globes
 on the <em>three </em>other planes or worlds). (<em>See Rig-veda
 I. </em>34<em>, III.</em> 56<em>; VII </em>10, 411, and <em>V</em>.,
 60. 6).
 </p><p>
 The italics are ours to point out the identity of the tenets with
 those of the esoteric doctrine, and the mistake made. The Magi
 or Mazdeans only believed in what other people believed in; namely,
 in seven "worlds" or globes of our planetary chain,
 of which <em>only one </em>is accessible to man (at the present
 time), our Earth; and in the successive appearance and destruction
 of seven continents or earths on this our globe, each continent
 being divided, in commemoration of the seven globes (one visible,
 six invisible), into seven islands or continents, "seven
 climes," etc., etc. This was a common belief in those days
 when the now Secret Doctrine was open to all. It is this multiplicity
 of localities under Septenary division, that made the Orientalists
 (led astray, moreover, by the oblivion of both the uninitiated
 Hindus and Parsis of their primitive doctrines) feel so puzzled
 by this ever-recurring seven-fold number, as to regard it as "mythical."
 It is that oblivion of the first principles which has led the
 Orientalists off the right track and made them commit the greatest
 blunders. The same failure is found in the definition of the Gods.
 Those who are ignorant of the esoteric doctrine of the earliest
 Aryans, can never assimilate or understand correctly the metaphysical
 meaning contained in these <strong>B</strong>EINGS.
 </p><p>
 Ahura Mazda (Ormazd) was the head and synthesis of the seven <em>Amesha
 Spentas </em>(or Amshaspends), and, therefore, an Amesha Spenta
 himself. Just as "Jehovah-Binah Arelim" was the head
 and synthesis of the Elohim and no more; so Agni-Vishnu-Surya
 was the synthesis and head, or the focus whence emanated in physics
 as in metaphysics, from the Spiritual as from the physical Sun,
 the Seven Rays, the seven fiery tongues, the seven planets or
 gods. All these became supreme gods and <em>the </em><strong>O</strong>NE
 <strong>G</strong>OD, but only after the loss of the primeval
 secrets, the sinking of Atlantis, or "the Flood," and
 the occupation of India by the Brahmans, who sought safety on
 the summits of the Himalayas, when even the high table-lands of
 what is now Tibet became submerged for a time. Ahura Mazda is
 addressed only as "the Most Blissful Spirit, Creator <em>of
 the corporeal </em>World" in the Vendidad. "Ahura Mazda"
 in its literal translation means the "Wise Lord" (<em>Ahura
 </em>"lord," and <em>Mazda </em>"wise"). Moreover,
 this name of <em>Ahura, </em>in Sanskrit <em>Asura, </em>connects
 him with the <em>Manasaputras, </em>the Sons of Wisdom who informed
 the mindless man, and endowed him with his mind (<em>manas</em>)<em>.
 </em>Ahura (asura) may be derived from the root <em>ah</em> "to
 be," but in its primal signification it is what the Secret
 Teaching shows it to be.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 609 THE ZOROASTRIAN SEPTENARY. </h6>
 
 <p>
 When geology shall have found out how many thousands of years
 ago the disturbed waters of the Indian Ocean reached the highest
 plateaux of Central Asia, when the Caspian Sea and the Persian
 Gulf made one with it, then only will they know the age of the
 Aryan Brahminical nation, and the time of its descent into the
 plains of Hindostan, which it did millenniums later.
 </p><p>
 Yima, the so-called "first man" in the <em>Vendidad,
 </em>as much as his twin-brother Yama, the Son of Vaivasvata Manu,
 belongs to two epochs of the Universal History. He is the "Progenitor"
 of the Second human Race, hence the personification of the shadows
 of the Pitris, and the father of the <em>postdiluvian </em>Humanity.
 The Magi said "Yima," as we say "man" when
 speaking of mankind. The "fair Yima," the first mortal
 who converses with Ahura Mazda, <em>is the first </em>"<em>man</em>"<em>
 who dies </em>or disappears, not the first who is born. The "Son
 of Vixanghat," was, like the Son of Vaivasvata, the symbolical
 man, who stood in esotericism as the representative of the <em>first
 three races </em>and the collective Progenitor thereof. Of these
 races the first two never died* but only vanished, absorbed in
 their progeny, and the third knew death only towards its close,
 after the separation of the sexes and its "Fall" into
 generation. This is plainly alluded to in the <strong>II</strong>.
 Fargard of the <em>Vendidad. </em>Yima refuses to become the bearer
 of the law of Ahura Mazda, saying "I was not born, I was
 not taught to be the preacher and the bearer of thy law."
 And then Ahura Mazda asks him to make his men increase and "watch
 over his world" (3 and 4).
 </p><p>
 He refuses to become the priest of Ahura Mazda, because he is
 <em>his</em> <em>own priest and sacrificer, </em>but he accepts
 the second proposal. He is made to answer: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Yes! . . . yes, I will rule and watch over thy world. There
 shall be, while I am King, neither cold wind nor hot wind, <em>neither
 disease nor death.</em>"<i> </i>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Then Ahura Mazda brings him a golden ring and a poniard, the emblems
 of sovereignty, and under the sway of Yima --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Three hundred <i>winters</i> passed away, and the earth
 was <i>replenished </i>with flocks and herds, with men, and dogs,
 and birds, and with red blazing fires," etc. (300 <i>winters</i>
 mean 300 periods or cycles.)
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 "Replenished," mark well, that is to say, all this had
 been on it before; and thus is proven the knowledge of the doctrine
 about the successive destructions of the world and its life cycles.
 Once the "300 winters" were over, Ahura Mazda warns
 Yima that the earth is becoming too full, and men have nowhere
 to live. Then Yima steps forward, and with the help of Spenta
 Armaita (the female genius, or Spirit of the Earth) makes that
 earth stretch out and become larger by
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Death came only after man had become a <em>physical </em>creature,
 <em>vide supra. </em>The men of the First Race and also of the
 Second, dissolved and disappeared in their progeny.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 610 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 one-third, after which "new herds and flocks and men"
 appear upon it. Ahura Mazda warns him again, and Yima makes the
 earth by the same magic power to become larger by two-thirds.
 "Nine hundred winters" <em>pass </em>away, and Yima
 has to perform the ceremony <em>for the third time. </em>The whole
 of this is allegorical. The three processes of stretching the
 earth, refer to the three successive continents and races issuing
 one after and from the other, as explained more fully elsewhere.
 After the <em>third</em> time, Ahura Mazda warns Yima in an assembly
 of "celestial gods and excellent mortals" that upon
 the material world the fatal winters are going to fall, and all
 <em>life </em>will perish. This is the old Mazdean symbolism for
 the "flood," and the coming cataclysm to Atlantis, which
 sweeps away every race in its turn. Like Vaivasvata Manu and Noah,
 Yima makes a <em>vara </em>(an enclosure, an ark) under the God's
 direction, and brings thither the seed of every living creature,
 animals and "fires."
 </p><p>
 It is of this "earth" or new continent that Zarathustra
 became the law-giver and ruler. This was the Fourth Race in its
 beginning, after the men of the Third began to die out. Till then,
 as said (<em>vide supra,</em> foot note) there had been no regular
 death, but only a transformation, for <em>men had no personality
 </em>as yet. They had monads -- breaths of the <strong>O</strong>NE
 Breath, and as impersonal as the source from which they proceeded.
 They had bodies, or rather shadows of bodies, which were sinless,
 hence <em>Karmaless. </em>Therefore, as there was no Kamaloka
 -- least of all Nirvana or even Devachan -- for the "souls"
 of men who had no personal <em>Egos,</em> there could be no intermediate
 periods between the incarnations. Like the Phoenix, primordial
 man resurrected out of his old into a new body. Each time, and
 with each new generation, he became more solid, more physically
 perfect, agreeably with the evolutionary law, which is the <em>Law
 of Nature. </em>Death came with the complete physical organism,
 and with it -- moral decay.
 </p><p>
 This explanation shows one more old religion agreeing in its symbology
 with the universal Doctrine.
 </p><p>
 Elsewhere the oldest Persian traditions, the relics of Mazdeism
 of the still older Magians, are given, and some of them explained.
 Mankind did not issue from one solitary couple. Nor was there
 ever a first man -- whether Adam or Yima -- but a first mankind.
 </p><p>
 It may, or may not be, "mitigated polygenism." Once
 that both creation<em> ex-nihilo</em> <em>-- </em>an absurdity
 -- and a superhuman Creator or creators -- a fact -- are made
 away with by science, polygenism presents no more difficulties
 or inconveniences (rather fewer from a scientific point of view)
 than monogenism does.
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, it is as scientific as any other claim. For in his
 Introduction to Nott's and Gliddon's "<em>Types of Mankind,</em>"<em>
 </em>Agassiz declares</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 611 THE SEPTENATE IN THE PURANAS. </h6>
 
 <p>
 his belief in an indefinite number of "<em>primordial races
 of men created</em> <em>separately</em>"<em>; </em>and remarks
 that, "whilst in every zoological province animals are of
 <em>different species, man, in spite of the diversity of his races,</em>
 <em>always forms one and the same human being.</em>"<i> </i>
 </p><p>
 Occultism defines and limits the number of primordial races to
 seven, because of the "seven progenitors," or <em>prajapatis,
 </em>the evolvers of beings. These are neither gods, nor supernatural
 Beings, but advanced Spirits from another and lower planet, reborn
 on this one, and giving birth in their turn in the present Round
 to present Humanity. This doctrine is again corroborated by one
 of its echoes -- the Gnostic. In their Anthropology and Genesis
 of man they taught that "a certain company of <em>Seven </em>angels,"
 formed the first men, who were no better than senseless, gigantic,
 shadowy forms -- "a mere wriggling worm" (!) writes
 Irenaeus (I., 24, 1), who takes, as usual, the metaphor for reality.
 </p><h3>D.</h3>
 
 <h4><strong>T</strong>HE <strong>S</strong>EPTENARY IN THE <strong>E</strong>XOTERIC
 <strong>W</strong>ORKS.</h4>
 
 <p>
 We may now examine other ancient Scriptures and see whether they
 contain the septenary classification, and, if so, to what degree.
 </p><p>
 As much, if not much more, even than in the Jewish Bible, scattered
 about in the thousands of Sanskrit texts, some still unopened,
 others yet unknown, as well as in all the Puranas, the numbers
 seven and forty-nine (7 x 7) play a most prominent part. They
 are found from the Seven creations in Chapter I., down to the
 seven rays of the Sun at the final Pralaya, which expand into
 Seven Suns and absorb the material of the whole Universe. Thus
 the <em>Matsya </em>Purana has: "For the sake of promulgating
 the Vedas, Vishnu, in the beginning of a Kalpa, related to Manu
 the story of Narasimha and the events of <em>seven</em> Kalpas."
 Then again the same Purana shows that "in all the Manvantaras,
 classes of Rishis* appear by seven and <em>seven, </em>and having
 established a code of law and morality depart to felicity"
 -- the Rishis representing many other things besides living Sages.
 </p><p>
 In Hymn xix., 53, of <em>Atharva Veda </em>(Dr. Muir's translation)
 one reads: --
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 *" These are the seven persons by whom in the several Manvantaras"
 -- says Parasara -- "created beings have been protected.
 Because the whole world has been pervaded by the energy of the
 deity, he is entitled Vishnu, from the root <em>Vis </em>'to enter'
 or 'pervade,' for all the gods, the Manus, the Seven Rishis, the
 Sons of the Manu, the Indras, all are but the impersonated potencies
 (<em>Vibhutayah</em>)<em> </em>of Vishnu" (Vish. Purana).
 Vishnu is the Universe; and the Universe itself is divided in
 the <em>Rig Veda</em> into <em>seven</em> regions -- which ought
 to be sufficient authority, for the Brahmins, at all events.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 612 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 " 1. Time carries (us) forward, a steed, with <em>seven rays,
 </em>a thousand eyes, undecaying, full of fecundity. On him intelligent
 sages mount; his wheels are all the worlds."
 </p><p>
 "2. Thus Time moves on <em>seven wheels; </em>he has <em>seven
 </em>naves; immortality is his axle. He is at present <em>all
 these worlds. </em>Time hastens onward the first God."
 </p><p>
 "3. A full jar is contained in Time. We behold him existing
 in many forms. He is all these worlds in the future. They call
 him 'Time in the highest Heaven' " . . . .
 </p><p>
 Now add to this the following verse from the Esoteric volumes:
 --
 </p><p>
 "Space and Time are one. Space and Time are nameless, for
 they are the incognizable <strong>T</strong>HAT, which can be
 sensed <em>only through its seven</em> <em>rays</em> -- which
 are the <em>Seven Creations, </em>the<em> Seven Worlds, the Seven</em>
 <em>Laws,</em>"<em> </em>etc., etc., etc. . . .
 </p><p>
 Remembering that the Puranas insist on the identity of Vishnu
 with Time and Space*; and that even the Rabbinical symbol for
 God is MAQOM, "Space," it becomes clear why, for purposes
 of a manifesting Deity -- Space, Matter, and Spirit -- the one
 central point became the Triangle and Quaternary (the perfect
 Cube), hence <em>Seven. </em>Even the <em>Pravaha </em>wind (the
 mystic and occult Force that gives the impulse to, and regulates
 the course of the stars and planets) is septenary. The Kurma and
 Linga Puranas enumerate seven principal winds of that name, which
 winds are the principles of Cosmic Space. They are intimately
 connected with <em>Dhruva** </em>(now Alpha), the Pole-Star, which
 is connected in its turn with the production of various phenomena
 through cosmic forces.
 </p><p>
 Thus, from the Seven Creations, seven Rishis, Zones, Continents,
 Principles, etc., etc. in the Aryan Scriptures, the number has
 passed through Indian, Egyptian, Chaldaic, Greek, Jewish, Roman,
 and finally Christian mystic thought, until it landed in and remained
 impressed indelibly on every exoteric theology. The seven old
 books stolen out of Noah's ark by Ham, and given to Cush, his
 son, and the seven Brazen columns of Ham and Cheiron, are a reflection
 and a remem-
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Vishnu is <em>all</em> -- the worlds, the stars, the seas, etc.,
 etc. "Vishnu is all that is, all that is not . . . . but
 is not <em>Vastubhuta,</em>"<em> </em>"a substance"
 (Vishnu Purana, Book <strong>II</strong>. ch. xii). "That
 which people call the highest God is not a substance <em>but the
 cause of it;</em> not one that is here, there, or elsewhere, <em>not
 what we see, </em>but that in which all is -- SPACE."
 </p><p>
 ** Therefore it is said in the Puranas that the view of Dhruva
 (the polar star) at night, and of the celestial porpoise (Sisumara,
 a constellation) "expiates whatever sin has been committed
 during the day." The fact is that the rays of the four stars
 in the circle of perpetual apparition -- the Agni, Mahendra, Kasyapa,
 and Dhruva, placed in the tail of <em>Ursa Minor </em>(Sisumara)
 -- focussed in a certain way and on a certain object produce extraordinary
 results. The <em>astro-magians </em>of India will understand what
 is meant.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 613 WHO ARE THE MARUTS? </h6>
 
 <p>
 brance of the Seven primordial mysteries instituted according
 to the "Seven secret emanations," the "Seven Sounds,"
 and seven rays -- the spiritual and sidereal models of the seven
 thousand times seven copies of them in later aeons.
 </p><p>
 The mysterious number is once more prominent in the no less mysterious
 Maruts. The Vayu Purana shows, and Harivansa corroborates, that
 the Maruts -- the oldest as the most incomprehensible of all the
 secondary or lower gods in the Rig Veda -- "are <em>born
 in every</em> <em>manvantara </em>(Round)<em> seven times seven
 </em>(or 49); that in each Manvantara, <em>four times seven </em>(or
 twenty-eight) they obtain emancipation, but their places are <em>filled
 up by persons reborn in that character.</em>"<em> </em>What
 are the <em>Maruts </em>in their esoteric meaning, and who <em>those
 persons </em>"reborn in that character"? In the Rig
 and other Vedas, the Maruts are represented as the storm gods
 and the <em>friends and allies </em>of Indra; they are the "Sons
 of heaven and of earth." This led to an allegory that makes
 them the children of Siva, the great patron of the Yogis, "the
 <strong>M</strong>AHA-<strong>Y</strong>OGI, the great <em>ascetic,
 </em>in whom is centred the highest perfection of austere penance
 and abstract meditation, <em>by which the most unlimited powers
 are obtained,</em> <em>marvels and miracles are worked, the highest
 spiritual knowledge is</em> <em>acquired, and union with the great
 spirit of the universe is eventually</em> <em>gained.</em>"<em>
 </em>In the Rig Veda the name Siva is unknown, but the god is
 called Rudra, which is a word used for <em>Agni, </em>the fire
 god, the Maruts being called therein his sons. In the <em>Ramayana
 </em>and the Puranas, their mother, Diti -- the sister, or complement
 of, and a form of Aditi -- anxious to obtain a son who would destroy
 Indra, is told by Kasyapa the Sage, that "if, with thoughts
 wholly pious and person entirely pure, she carrys the babe in
 her womb for a hundred years" she will get such a son. But
 Indra foils her in the design. With his thunderbolt he <em>divides
 the embryo in her womb into seven portions, </em>and then divides
 every such portion <em>into seven pieces again, </em>which become
 the swift-moving deities, the Maruts.* These deities are only
 another <em>aspect, </em>or a development of the Kumaras, who
 are <em>Rudras </em>in their patronymic, like many others.**
 </p><p>
 Diti, being Aditi, unless the contrary is proven to us, Aditi,
 we say, or Akasa in her highest form, is <em>the Egyptian seven-fold
 heaven. </em>Every true Occultist will understand what this means.
 Diti, we repeat, is the sixth

 ** With regard to the origin of Rudra, it is stated in several
 <em>Puranas</em> that his (spiritual) progeny, <em>created in
 him by Brahma, </em>was not confined to either the <em>seven</em>
 Kumaras or the <em>eleven</em> Rudras, etc., but "comprehends
 infinite numbers of beings <em>in</em> <em>person and equipments
 like their </em>(virgin) father. Alarmed at their fierceness,
 numbers, and <em>immortality</em>, Brahma desires his son Rudra
 to form creatures of a different and mortal nature." Rudra
 <em>refusing to create, </em>desists, etc., hence <em>Rudra</em>
 is <em>the first rebel.</em> (<em>Linga, Vayu, Matsya, </em>and
 other Puranas.)</p><hr>

 <p>
 principle of <em>metaphysical </em>nature, the <em>Buddhi </em>of
 Akasa. Diti, the mother of the Maruts, is one of her terrestrial
 forms, made to represent, at one and the same time, the divine
 Soul in the ascetic, and the divine aspirations of mystic Humanity
 toward deliverance from the webs of Maya, and final bliss in consequence.
 Indra, now degraded, because of the Kali Yuga, when such aspirations
 are no more general but have become abnormal through a general
 spread of <em>Ahamkara </em>(the feeling of Egotism, <em>Self,
 </em>or <strong>I</strong>-AM-NESS) and ignorance -- was, in the
 beginning, one of the greatest gods of the Hindu Pantheon, as
 the Rig Veda shows. <em>Sura-dhipa, </em>"the chief of the
 gods," has fallen down from <em>Jishnu, </em>"the leader
 of the celestial host," -- the Hindu St. Michael -- to an
 opponent of asceticism, the enemy of every holy aspiration. He
 is shown married to Aindri (Indrani), the personification of <em>Aindri-yaka,
 </em>the evolution of the element of senses, whom he married "because
 of her <em>voluptuous</em> <em>attractions</em>"<em>; </em>after
 which he began sending celestial female demons to excite the passions
 of holy men, Yogis, and "to beguile them from the potent
 penances which he dreaded." Therefore, Indra, now characterized
 as "the god of the firmament, the personified atmosphere"
 -- is in reality the cosmic principle <em>Mahat, </em>and the
 fifth human -- <em>Manas </em>in its dual aspect: as connected
 with <em>Buddhi; </em>and as allowing himself to be dragged down
 by his <em>Kama</em>-principle (the body of passions and desires).
 This is demonstrated by Brahma telling the conquered god that
 his frequent defeats were due to <em>Karma, </em>and were a punishment
 for his licentiousness, and the seduction of various nymphs. It
 is in this latter character that he seeks, to save himself from
 destruction, to destroy the coming "babe" destined to
 conquer him: -- the babe, of course, allegorizing the divine and
 steady will of the Yogi -- determined to resist all such temptations,
 and thus destroy the passions within his earthly personality.
 Indra succeeds again, because flesh conquers spirit -- (Diti is
 shown frustrated in the Dvapara Yug, during that period when the
 Fourth Race was flourishing). He divides the "Embryo"
 (of new <em>divine </em>adeptship, begotten once more by the Ascetics
 of the Aryan Fifth Race), into <em>seven </em>portions -- a reference
 not alone to the <em>seven </em>sub-races of the new Root-Race,
 in each of which there will be a "Manu,"* but also to
 the seven degrees of adeptship -- and then each

 <p>
 * Notwithstanding the terrible, and evidently <em>purposed</em>,
 confusion of Manus, Rishis, and their progeny in the Puranas,
 one thing is made clear: there have been and there will be seven
 Rishis in every Root-Race (called also <em>Manvantara </em>in
 the sacred books) as there are fourteen Manus in every Round,
 the "presiding gods, the Rishis and Sons of the Manus"
 being identical. (See Book <strong>III</strong>. ch. 1 of <em>Vishnu
 Purana.</em>)<em> </em>"Six" Manvantaras are given,
 the Seventh being our own in the Vishnu Purana. The <em>Vayu</em>
 Purana furnishes the nomenclature of the Sons of the fourteen
 Manus in every Manvantara, and the Sons of the seven Sages or
 Rishis. The latter are the progeny [[Continued on next page]]
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 615 THE DOOM OF CONTINUAL REBIRTH. </h6>
 
 <p>
 portion into seven pieces -- alluding to the Manu-Rishis of each
 Root-Race, and even sub-race.
 </p><p>
 It does not seem difficult to perceive what is meant by the Maruts
 obtaining "<em>four times seven</em>"<em> </em>emancipations
 in every "manvantara," and by those persons who, being
 <em>reborn </em>in that character (of the <em>Maruts</em> in their
 esoteric meaning), "fill up their places." The Maruts
 represent (<em>a</em>) the<em> passions </em>that storm and rage
 within every candidate's breast, when preparing for an ascetic
 life -- this<em> mystically; </em>(<em>b</em>)<em> </em>the occult
 potencies concealed in the manifold aspects of <em>Akasa</em>'<em>s
 </em>lower principles -- her body, or <em>sthula sarira, </em>representing
 the terrestrial, lower, atmosphere of every inhabited globe --
 this mystically and sidereally; (<em>c</em>) actual conscious
 Existences, Beings of a cosmic and psychic nature.
 </p><p>
 At the same time "Maruts" is, in occult parlance, one
 of the names given to those EGOS of great Adepts who have passed
 away, and who are known also as <em>Nirmanakayas; </em>of those
 Egos for whom -- <em>since they</em> <em>are beyond illusion --
 </em>there is no Devachan, and who, having either voluntarily
 renounced it for the good of mankind, or not yet reached Nirvana,
 remain invisible on earth. Therefore are the Maruts* shown firstly
 -- as the sons of Siva-Rudra -- the "Patron Yogi," whose
 "<em>third</em> eye,"<i> </i>mystically, must be acquired
 by the ascetic before he becomes an adept; then, in their cosmic
 character, as the subordinates of Indra and his opponents -- variously.
 The "four times seven" emancipations have a reference
 to the four Rounds, and the four Races that preceded ours, in
 each of which <em>Marut-Jivas </em>(monads) have been re-born,
 and have obtained final liberation, if they have only availed
 themselves of it. Instead of which, preferring the good of mankind,
 which would struggle still more hopelessly in the meshes of ignorance
 and misery, <em>were it not</em> <em>for this extraneous help
 -- </em>they are re-born over and over again "in that character,"
 and thus "fill up their own places." <em>Who </em>they
 are,<i> </i>"<em>on</em> <em>earth</em>" -- every student
 of Occult science knows. And he also knows that the Maruts are
 <em>Rudras, </em>among whom also the family of Twashtri, a synonym
 of Visvakarman -- the great patron of the Initiates -- is included.
 This gives us an ample knowledge of their true nature.

 All the Puranas speak of the seven Prajapatis of this period (Round).

 * "Chakshuba was the Manu of the sixth period (Third Round
 and Third Race), in which Indra was Manojava" (<em>Mantradruma
 </em>in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>)<em>. </em>As there is a
 perfect analogy between the "great Round" (<em>Mahakalpa</em>)<em>,
 </em>each of the seven Rounds, and each of the seven great Races
 in every one of the Rounds -- therefore, Indra of the sixth period,
 or Third Round, corresponds to the close of the Third Race (at
 the time of the <i>Fall </i>or the separation of sexes). Rudra,
 as the father of the Maruts, has many points of contact with Indra,
 the Marutwan, or "lord of the Maruts." To receive a
 name Rudra is said to have wept for it. Brahma called him Rudra;
 but <em>he wept seven times</em> <em>more and so obtained seven
 other names -- </em>of which he uses one during <em>each</em>
 "period." </p><hr>

 <p>
 The same for the Septenary Division of Kosmos and human principles.
 The Puranas, along with other sacred texts, teem with allusions
 to this. First of all, the mundane Egg which contained Brahma,
 or the Universe, "was externally invested with <em>seven</em>
 natural elements, at first loosely enumerated as Water, Air, Fire,
 Ether, and <em>three secret </em>elements" (Book I.); then
 the "World" is said to be "encompassed on every
 side" by seven elements, also <em>within </em>the egg --
 as explained, "the universe is encompassed on every side,
 above and below by the <em>Andakat</em>'<em>aha -- </em>the shell
 of the egg of Brahma." . . . Around the shell flows water,
 which is surrounded with fire; fire by air; air by ether; ether
 by the origin of the elements (Ahamkara); the latter by Universal
 Mind ("Intellect" in the Texts) (Book <strong>II</strong>.,
 ch. <strong>VII</strong>. <em>Vishnu Purana</em>)<em>. </em>It
 relates to spheres of being as much as to principles. <em>Prithivi
 </em>is not our Earth, but the World, the Solar system, and means
 the <em>broad,</em> the <em>Wide. </em>In the <em>Vedas -- </em>the
 greatest of all authorities, though needing the key to read it
 correctly -- three terrestrial and three celestial earths are
 mentioned as having been called into existence simultaneously
 with <em>Bhumi </em>-- our earth. We have often been told that
 six, not <i>seven</i>, appears to be the number of spheres, principles,
 etc. We answer that there are, in fact, only six principles in
 man; since his body is <em>no principle,</em> but the covering,
 the shell thereof. So with the <em>planetary chain; </em>speaking
 of which, esoterically, the Earth (as well as the seventh, or
 rather <em>fourth </em>plane, one that stands as the seventh if
 we count from the first triple kingdom of the Elementals that
 begin the formation) may be left out of consideration, being (to
 us) the only distinct body of the seven. The language of occultism
 is varied. But supposing that <em>three </em>earths only, instead
 of seven, are meant in the Vedas, what are those three, since
 we still know of but one? Evidently there <em>must be </em>an
 occult meaning in the statement under consideration. Let us see.
 The "Earth that floats" on the Universal Ocean (of Space),
 which Brahma divides in the Puranas into seven zones, is <em>Prithivi,
 </em>the world divided into seven <em>principles; </em>a cosmic
 division looking metaphysical enough, but, in reality, <em>physical
 </em>in its occult effects. Many Kalpas later, our Earth is mentioned,
 and, in its turn, is divided into seven zones* on that same law
 of analogy that guided ancient philosophers. After which one finds
 on it seven continents, seven isles, seven oceans, seven seas
 and rivers, seven mountains, and seven climates, etc., etc., etc.**

 ** In <em>Vishnu Purana,</em> Book <strong>II</strong>., chap.

 to which the commentator remarks that<i> </i>"<em>this comprises
 the planetary spheres;</em> for the diameter of the seven zones
 and oceans -- each ocean being of the same diameter as the continent
 it encloses, and each successive continent being twice the [[Continued

 <p>
 Furthermore, it is not only in the Hindu Scriptures and philosophy
 that one finds references to the <em>Seven Earths, </em>but in
 the Persian, Phoenician, Chaldean, and Egyptian Cosmogonies, and
 even in Rabbinical literature. The Phoenix* -- called by the Hebrews
 Onech [Heb char] (from <em>Phenoch, </em>Enoch, symbol of a secret
 cycle and initiation), and by the Turks,<em> Kerkes -- </em>lives
 a thousand years, after which, kindling a flame, it is self-consumed;
 and then, reborn from itself -- it lives another thousand years,
 up to <em>seven times seven: </em>(See "Book of Ali"
 -- Russian transl.), when comes the day of Judgment. The "seven
 times seven," 49, are a transparent allegory, and an allusion
 to the forty-nine "Manus," the Seven Rounds, and the
 seven times seven human cycles in each Round on each globe. The
 <em>Kerkes </em>and the <em>Onech</em> stand for a race cycle,
 and the mystical tree Ababel -- the "<em>Father Tree</em>"<em>
 </em>in the Kuran -- shoots out new branches and vegetation at
 every resurrection of the Kerkes or Phoenix; the "Day of
 judgment" meaning a "minor <em>Pralaya</em>"<em>
 </em>(See<em> </em>"<em>Esoteric Buddhism</em>")<em>.
 </em>The author of the "Book of God" and the "Apocalypse"
 believes that "the Phoenix is very plainly the same as the
 <em>Simorgh, </em>the Persian <em>roc</em>, and the account which
 is given us of this last bird, yet more decisively establishes
 the opinion that the death and revival of the Phoenix exhibit
 the successive destruction and reproduction of the world, which
 many believed to be effected by the agency of a fiery deluge"
 -- (p. 175); and a watery one in turn. "When the Simorgh
 was asked her age, she informed Caherman that this world is very
 ancient, for it has been already <em>seven times replenished </em>with
 beings different from men, and <em>seven times depopulated;**
 </em>that the age of the human race, in which we now are, is to
 endure <em>seven thousand numbers,</em> and that she herself had
 seen <em>twelve </em>of these revolutions, and knew not how many
 more she had to see." (<em>Oriental </em>Collections, ii.,
 119.)
 </p><p>
 The above, however, is no new statement. From Bailly, in the last
 century, down to Dr. Kenealy, in this one, these facts have been
 noticed by several writers, but now a connection can be established
 between

 Whenever any contradictions in different Puranas occur, they have
 to be ascribed . . . to differences of Kalpas and <em>the like.</em>"<em>
 </em>"The like" ought to read "Occult meaning,"
 which explanation is withheld by the commentator, who wrote for
 <em>exoteric, sectarian </em>purposes, and was misunderstood by
 the translator for various other reasons, the least of which is
 -- ignorance of the esoteric philosophy.

 * The <em>Phoenix,</em> connected with the Solar Cycle of 600

 the Persian oracle and the Nazarene prophet. Says the author of
 the "Book of God": --
 </p><p>
 "The Simorgh is in reality the same as the winged <em>Singh</em>
 of the Hindus, and the Sphinx of the Egyptians. It is said that
 the former will appear at the end of the world . . . . as a monstrous
 lion-bird. From these the Rabbins have borrowed their mythos of
 an enormous Bird, sometimes standing on the Earth, sometimes walking
 in the ocean . . . while its head props the sky; and with the
 symbol, they have also adopted the doctrine to which it relates.
 They teach <em>that there are to</em> <em>be seven successive
 renewals of the globe, </em>that each reproduced system <em>will
 last seven thousand years; </em>(<em>?</em>)<em> </em>and that
 the <em>total duration of the</em> <em>universe will be </em>49,000<em>
 years. </em>This opinion, which involves the doctrine of the pre-existence
 of each renewed creature, they may either have learned during
 their Babylonian captivity, or <em>it may have been part of</em>
 <em>the primeval </em>religion which their priests had preserved
 from remote times" (p. 176). It shows rather that the initiated
 Jews <em>borrowed, </em>and their non-initiated successors, the
 Talmudists, lost the sense, and applied the Seven Rounds, and
 the forty-nine races, etc., to the wrong end.
 </p><p>
 Not only "<em>their </em>priests," but those of every
 other country. The Gnostics, whose various teachings are the many
 echoes of the one primitive and universal doctrine, put the same
 numbers, under another form, in the mouth of Jesus in the very
 occult <em>Pistis Sophia. </em>We say more: even the Christian
 editor or author of <em>Revelation </em>has preserved this tradition
 and speaks of the Seven <strong>R</strong>ACES, four of which,
 with part of the fifth, are gone, and two have to come. It is
 stated as plainly as could be stated in chapter xvii., verses
 9 and 10. Thus saith the angel: "And here <em>is </em>the
 mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on
 which the woman sitteth. And there are SEVEN Kings, <em>five </em>are
 fallen, and one <em>is, </em>and the other is not yet come . .
 . . " Who, acquainted in the least with the symbolical language
 of old, will fail to discern in the <em>five</em> Kings that have
 fallen, the four Root-Races that were, and part of the fifth,
 the one that <em>is</em>; and in the <em>other, </em>that<em>
 </em>"<em>is not yet</em> <em>come,</em>"<em> </em>the
 sixth and seventh coming root races, as also the sub-races of
 this, our present race? Another still more forcible allusion to
 the Seven Rounds and the forty-nine root-races in <em>Leviticus,
 </em>will be found elsewhere in the Addenda, Part <strong>III</strong>.

 Again, number seven is closely connected with the occult significance

 <p>
 seventh <em>hidden.</em>" In India they are connected with
 their nursling, the war god, Karttikeya. It is the <em>Pleiades
 </em>(in Sanskrit, <em>Krittika</em>)<em> </em>who gave the god
 their name, for Karttikeya is the planet Mars, <em>astronomically.</em>
 As a god he is the son of Rudra, born without the intervention
 of a woman. He is a <em>Kumara, </em>a "virgin youth"
 again, generated in the fire from the Seed of Siva -- the <em>holy
 spirit</em> -- hence called Agni-bhu. The late Dr. Kenealy believed
 that, in India, Karttikeya is the secret symbol of the cycle of
 Naros, composed of 600, 666, and 777 years, according to whether
 it is solar or lunar, divine or mortal, years that are counted;
 and the six visible, or the seven actual sisters, the Pleiades,
 are needed for the completion of this most secret and mysterious
 of all the astronomical and religious symbols. Therefore, when
 made to commemorate one particular event, Karttikeya appeared,
 of old, as a <em>Kumara,</em> an ascetic, with <em>six heads</em>
 --<em> </em>one for each century of the Naros. When the symbolism
 was needed for another event, then, in conjunction with the seven
 sidereal sisters, Karttikeya is seen accompanied by Kaumara (or
 Sena) his female aspect. He is then riding on a peacock -- the
 bird of Wisdom and Occult Knowledge, and the Hindu Phoenix, whose
 Greek relation with the 600 years of Naros is well-known. A six-rayed
 star (double triangle) a Swastica, a six and occasionally seven-pointed
 crown is on his brow; the peacock's tail represents the sidereal
 heavens; and the twelve signs of the Zodiac <em>are hidden on
 his</em> <em>body; </em>for which he is also called Dwadasa Kara,"
 ("the twelve-handed"), and Dwadasaksha, "twelve-eyed."
 It is as Sakti-dhara, however, the "Spear-holder," and
 the conqueror of Taraka, "Taraka-jit," that he is shown
 most famous.
 </p><p>
 The years of the Naros, being (in India) counted in two ways --
 either "100 years of the gods," (<em>divine </em>years)
 -- or 100 <em>mortal years </em>-- one can see the tremendous
 difficulty for the non-initiated in comprehending correctly this
 cycle, which plays such an important part in St. John's Revelation.
 It is the truly apocalyptic Cycle; yet in none of the numerous
 speculations about it have we found anything but <em>a few</em>
 <em>approximate </em>truths, because of its being of various lengths
 and relating to various pre-historic events.
 </p><p>
 It has been urged against the duration claimed by the Babylonians
 for their divine ages, that Suidas shows the ancients counting,
 in their chronological computations, days for years. Dr. Sepp
 in his ingenious plagiarism -- exposed elsewhere -- of the Hindu
 432 in thousands and millions of years (the duration of the Yugas)
 which he dwarfed to 4,320 <em>lunar </em>years before the "birth
 of Christ" -- as "foreordained" in the sidereal
 (besides the invisible) heavens, and proved "by the apparition
 of the Star of Bethlehem" -- appeals to Suidas and his authority.
 But Suidas had no other warrant for it than his own speculations,
 and he</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 620 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 was no Initiate. He cites, as a proof, Vulcan, in showing him
 as having, according to chronological claim, reigned 4,477 years,
 <em>i.e.</em>, 4,477<em> days, as</em><i> </i>he thinks, or rendered
 in years, 12 years, 3 months, and 7 days; he has 5 days in his
 original -- thus committing an error even in such an easy calculation.
 (See Suidas, art. [[<i>Heelios</i>]].) True, there are other ancient
 writers guilty of like fallacious speculations -- Calisthenes,
 for instance, who assigns to the astronomical observations of
 the Chaldeans only 1,903 years, whereas Epigenes recognises 720,000
 years (<em>Pliny. Histor.</em> <em>Natur. Lib. </em><strong>VII.</strong><em>
 c. </em>56.) The whole of these hypotheses made by profane writers
 are based upon and due to a misunderstanding. The chronology of
 all the Western peoples, ancient Greeks and Romans, was borrowed
 from India. Now, it is said in the Tamil edition of <em>Bagavadam
 </em>that<em> </em>15 solar days make a <em>Paccham; </em>two<em>
 paccham </em>(or 30 days) are a month of the mortals, adding that
 such a month is only one day of the <em>Pitar Devata</em> (<em>Pitris</em>)<em>.
 </em>Again, two of these months constitute a <em>roodoo,</em>
 three<em> roodoo</em> make an <em>ayanam, </em>and two <em>ayanams
 </em>a year -- which year of the mortals is<em> but a day of the
 gods. </em>It is on such misunderstood teachings that some Greeks
 have imagined that all the initiated priests had transformed days
 into years!
 </p><p>
 This mistake of the ancient Greek and Latin writers became pregnant
 with results in Europe. At the close of the past and the beginning
 of this century, relying upon the purposely mutilated accounts
 of Hindu chronology, brought from India by certain too zealous
 and as unscrupulous missionaries, Bailly, Dupuis, and others built
 quite a fantastic theory upon the subject. Because the Hindus
 had made half a revolution of the moon, a measure of time; and
 because a month composed of only fifteen days -- of which Quint.
 Curtius speaks (<em>Menses in quinos dies descriperunt dies. </em>Quint.
 Curt. <strong>LVIII</strong>., c. 9) -- is found mentioned in
 Hindu literature, therefore, it is a verified fact that their
 <em>year </em>was only half a year, when it was <em>not called
 a day. </em>The Chinese, too, divided their Zodiac into twenty-four
 parts, hence their year into twenty-four fortnights, but such
 computation did not, nor does it prevent their having an astronomical
 year just the same as ours. And they have a period of sixty days
 -- the Southern Indian <em>Roodoo, </em>to this day in some provinces.
 Moreover, Diodorus Siculus (Lib. I. ยง 26, p. 30) calls "<em>thirty
 days </em>an Egyptian year," or that period during which
 the moon performs a complete revolution. Pliny and Plutarch both
 speak of it (<em>Hist. Nat. </em>Lib. <strong>VII</strong>., c.
 48, Vol<strong>. III</strong>., p. 185, and <em>Life of Numa,
 </em>ยง<em> </em>16); but does it stand to reason that the
 Egyptians, who knew astronomy as well as any other people did,
 made the <em>lunar </em>month consist of thirty days, when it
 is only twenty-eight days with fractions? This lunary period had
 <em>an occult</em> <em>meaning </em>surely as much as the <em>Ayanam
 </em>and the <em>roodoo </em>of the Hindus had. The year of two
 months' duration, and the period of sixty days also,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 621 VARIOUS CYCLIC CALCULATIONS. </h6>
 
 <p>
 was a universal measure of time in antiquity, as Bailly himself
 shows in his <em>Traite de l</em>'<em>Astronomie Orientale. </em>The
 Chinamen, according to their own books, divided their year into
 two parts, from one equinox to the other (<em>Mem. Acad. Ins.
 </em>T. <strong>XVI</strong>., c. 48, <em>Tom. </em><strong>III</strong>.,
 p. 183); the Arabs anciently divided the year into six seasons,
 each composed of two months; in the Chinese astronomical work
 called <em>Kioo-tche, </em>it is said that two moons make a measure
 of time, and six measures a year; and to this day the aborigines
 of Kamschatka have their years of six months, as they had when
 visited by Abbe Chappe (Voyage to Siberia, Vol. III., p. 19).
 But is all this a reason to say that when the Hindu Puranas say
 "a <em>solar year</em>"<em> </em>they mean <em>one solar
 </em>day! It is the knowledge of the natural laws that make of
 seven the root nature-number, so to say, in the manifested world
 -- at any rate in our present terrestrial life-cycle -- and the
 wonderful comprehension of its workings, that unveiled to the
 ancients so many of the mysteries of nature. It is these laws,
 again, and their processes on the sidereal, terrestrial, and moral
 planes, which enabled the old astronomers to calculate correctly
 the duration of the cycles and their respective effects on the
 march of events; to record beforehand (prophecy, it is called)
 the influence which they will have on the course and development
 of the human races. The Sun, Moon, and planets being the never-erring
 time measurers, whose potency and periodicity were well known,
 became thus the great Ruler and rulers of our little system in
 all its <em>seven</em> <em>domains, </em>or "spheres of action."*
 </p><p>
 This has been so evident and remarkable, that even many of the
 modern men of Science, Materialists as well as Mystics, had their
 attention called to this law. Physicians and theologians, mathematicians
 and psychologists have drawn the attention of the world repeatedly
 to this fact of periodicity in the behaviour of "Nature."
 These numbers are explained in the "Commentaries" in
 these words.

 When the Western Orientalists have mastered the real meaning of
 the Rig Vedic divisions of the World -- the two-fold, three-fold,
 six and seven-fold, and especially the nine-fold division, the
 mystery of the cyclic divisions applied to heaven and earth, gods
 and men, will become clearer to them than it is now. For --

 "<strong>T</strong>HERE IS A HARMONY OF NUMBERS IN ALL NATURE;
 <i>in the force of gravity, in the planetary movements, in the
 laws of heat, light, electricity, and chemical affinity, in the
 forms of animals and plants, in the perception of the mind.</i>
 The direction, indeed, of modern natural and physical science,
 is towards a generalization which shall express the fundamental
 laws of all, by one simple numerical ratio. We would refer to
 Professor Whewell's 'Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,' and
 to Mr. Hay's researches into the laws of harmonious colouring
 and form. <i>From these it appears that the number seven is distinguished
 in the laws regulating the harmonious Perception of forms, colours,
 and sounds</i>, and probably of taste also, if we could analyse
 our sensations of this kind with mathematical accuracy."

 So much so, indeed, that more than one physician has stood aghast
 at the periodical <em>septenary </em>return of the cycles in the
 rise and fall of various complaints, and naturalists have felt
 themselves at an utter loss to explain this law. "The birth,
 growth, maturity, vital functions . . . . change, diseases, decay
 and death, of insects, reptiles, fishes, birds, mammals, and even
 of man, are more or less controlled by a law of completion in
 <em>weeks,</em>"<em> </em>or seven days.** Dr. Laycock (<em>Lancet,
 </em>1842-3), writing on the Periodicity of Vital Phenomena, records
 a "most remarkable illustration and confirmation of the law
 in insects."***

 To all of which Mr. Grattan Guinness, the author of "The
 Approaching End of the Age," says very pertinently, as he
 defends Biblical Chronology, "And man's life . . . is <em>a
 week, a week of decades. </em>'The days of our years are threescore
 years and ten.' Combining the testimony of all these facts, we
 are bound to admit that <em>there prevails in organic</em> <em>mature
 a law of septiform periodicity, a law of completion in weeks</em>"<i>
 </i>(p. 269). Without accepting the conclusions, and especially
 the premises of the learned Founder of "the East London Institute
 for Home and Foreign Missions," the writer accepts and welcomes
 his researches in the occult chronology of the Bible. Just as,
 while rejecting the theories and hypotheses of modern Science
 and its generalizations, we bow before its great achievements
 in the world of the physical, or in all the minor details of material
 nature.
 </p><p>
 There is most assuredly an occult "chronological system in
 Hebrew Scripture" -- the<em> Kabala </em>being its warrant;
 there is in it "a system of

 or four o'clock a.m., when the system is most languid." (See

 This is pure "soothsaying" by <em>cyclic</em> calculations,
 and it is connected with Chaldean astrolatry and astrology. Thus
 materialistic Science -- medicine, <em>the most materialistic</em>
 <em>of all </em>-- applies our occult laws to diseases, studies
 natural history with its help, recognizes its presence as a fact
 in nature, and yet must needs pooh-pooh the same archaic knowledge
 when claimed by the Occultists. For if the mysterious Septenary
 Cycle is a law in nature, <em>and it is one, </em>as proven; if
 it is found controlling the evolution and <em>involution </em>(or
 death) in the realms of entomology, icthyology and ornithology,
 as in the Kingdom of the Animal, mammalia and man -- why cannot
 it be present and acting in Kosmos, in general, in its natural
 (though occult) divisions of time, races, and <em>mental</em>
 development? And why, furthermore, should not the most ancient
 adepts have studied and thoroughly mastered these cyclic laws
 under all their aspects? Indeed, Dr. Stratton states as a physiological
 and pathological fact, that "in health the human pulse is
 more frequent <em>in</em> <em>the morning than in the evening
 for six days out of seven; </em>and that on the <em>seventh day
 it is slower.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Ibid. Edinb. Med. and Surg.
 Journal, </em>Jan. 1843.) Why, then, should not an Occultist show
 the same in cosmic and terrestrial life in the pulse of the planet
 and races? Dr. Laycock divides life by <em>three great septenary
 periods; </em>the first and last, each stretching over 21 years,
 and the central period or prime of life lasting 28 years, or four
 times seven. He subdivides the first into <em>seven distinct stages,</em>
 and the other two into <em>three</em> minor periods, and says
 that "The fundamental unit of the greater periods is <em>one
 week of seven days, each day being twelve hours</em>"<em>;
 </em>and that "single and compound <i>multiples </i>of this
 unit, determine the length of these periods by the same ratio,
 as multiples of the unit of twelve hours determine the lesser
 periods. <em>This law</em> <em>binds all periodic vital phenomena
 together, and links the periods observed in the lowest</em> <em>annulose
 animals, with those of man himself, the highest of the vertebrate.</em>"<em>
 </em>If<em> Science</em> does this, why should the latter scorn
 the Occult information, namely, that (speaking Dr. Laycock's language)
 "<em>one week </em>of the manvantaric (<em>lunar</em>) fortnight,
 of fourteen days (or seven manus), that fortnight of twelve hours
 in a day representing seven periods or seven races -- is now passed?"
 This language of science fits our doctrine admirably. We (mankind)
 <em>have</em> lived over "<em>a</em> <em>week of seven days,
 </em>each day being <em>twelve hours,</em>"<em> </em>since
 three and a half races are now gone for ever, the fourth is submerged,
 and we are now in the Fifth Race.</p><hr>

 <p>
 weeks" -- which is based on the archaic Indian system, which
 may still be found in the old Jyotisha.* And there are in it cycles
 of "the <em>week</em> of days," of the "<em>week
 </em>of<em> </em>months," of years, of centuries, and even
 of millenniums, decamillenniums, and more, or "the week of
 years of years."** But all this can be found in the archaic
 doctrine. And if this common source of the chronology in every
 Scripture, however <em>veiled, </em>is denied in the case of the
 Bible, then the six days, and a Sabbath, the seventh, can hardly
 disconnect <em>Genesis</em> from the Puranic Cosmogonies. For
 the first "Week of Creation" shows the septiformity
 of its chronology and thus connects it with Brahma's "Seven
 Creations." The able volume from the pen of Mr. Grattan Guinness,
 in which he has collected on some 760 pages every proof of that
 septiform calculation, is good evidence. For if the Bible chronology
 is, as he says, "regulated by the law of weeks," and
 if it is septenary, whatever the measures of the creation week
 and the length of its days; and if, finally, "the Bible system
 includes weeks on a great variety of scales," then this system
 is shown to be identical with all the pagan systems. Moreover,
 the attempt to show that 4,320 years (in lunar months) elapsed
 between "Creation" and the Nativity, is a clear and
 unmistakable connection with the 4,320,000 of the Hindu Yugas.
 Otherwise, why make such efforts to prove that these figures,
 which are pre-eminently Chaldean and Indo-Aryan, play such a part
 in the New Testament? We shall prove it now still more forcibly.
 </p><p>
 Let the impartial critic compare the two accounts -- the Vishnu
 Purana and the Bible -- and he will find that the "seven
 creations" of Brahma are at the foundation of the "week"
 of creation in <em>Genesis</em> i<em>.</em> The two allegories
 are different, but the systems are all built on the same foundation-stone.
 The Bible can be understood <em>only by the light</em> <em>of
 the Kabala. </em>Take the <em>Zohar, </em>the "Book of Concealed
 Mystery," however now disfigured, and compare. The seven
 Rishis and the fourteen Manus of the seven Manvantaras -- issue
 from Brahma's head; they are his "mind-born sons," and
 it is with them that begins the division of mankind and its races
 from the Heavenly man, "the Logos" (the manifested),
 who is Brahma Prajapati. Says (V. 70 in) the "Ha Idra Rabba
 Qadisha" (the Greater Holy Assembly) of the skull (head)

 Garga and other ancient astronomical Sections (Jyotisha). They

 cycle of the Vedas," specified in the institutes of Parasara,
 "and the basis of calculation for larger cycles" (<em>Miscell.
 Essays, </em>Vol. I., pp. 106 and 108) -- up to the Mahayuga or
 the famous cycle of 4,320,000 years.

 of Brahma), that in every one of his hairs is a "hidden fountain
 issuing from the concealed brain." "And it shineth and

 and from it (which is the manifest <strong>Q</strong>UATERNARY,
 the <em>Tetragrammaton</em>)<em> </em>his brain is formed; and
 thence that brain goeth into THIRTY and TWO paths" (or the
 <em>triad</em> and the <em>duad, </em>or again 432). And again:
 (V. 80) "Thirteen curls of hair exist on the one side and
 on the other of the skull" -- <em>i.e.</em>, six on one and
 six on the other, the thirteenth being also the fourteenth, as
 it is male-female, "and through them commenceth the division
 of the hair" (the division of things, Mankind and Races).

 "We <em>six </em>are lights which shine forth from a <em>seventh

 whom he calls "the eyes of Tetragrammaton.")
 </p><p>
 <strong>T</strong>ETRAGRAMMATON is Brahma Prajapati, who assumed
 <em>four</em> forms, in order to create four kinds of <em>supernal
 </em>creatures, <em>i.e.</em>, made himself <em>fourfold, </em>or
 the manifest <em>Quaternary </em>(see Vishnu Purana, Book I. ch.
 V.); and who, after that, is re-born in the <em>seven </em>Rishis,
 his <em>Manasaputras,</em> "mind-born sons," who became
 later, 9, 21 and so on, who are all said to be born from various
 parts of Brahma**

 animals" <em>pasu</em> -<em>- </em>or the celestial bodies
 and the Zodiacal signs, and plants <em>which</em> he uses <i>in</i>
 <em>sacrifices </em>at the opening of <em>Treta</em> Yuga. The
 esoteric meaning of it shows him proceeding cyclically and creating
 astral prototypes on the <em>descending spiritual arc </em>and
 then on the <em>ascending</em> physical arc. The latter is the
 sub-division of a <em>two-fold </em>creation, subdivided again
 into seven descending and seven ascending degrees of spirit falling,
 and of matter ascending -- the inverse of what takes place (as
 in a mirror which reflects the right on the left side) in this
 manvantara of ours. It is the same, <em>esoterically, </em>in
 the Elohistic Genesis (chap. i.), and in the Jehovistic copy,
 as in Hindu cosmogony.
 </p><p>
 ** It is very surprising to see theologians and Oriental scholars
 express indignation at the "<em>depraved</em> taste of the
 Hindu mystics" who, not content with having <em>invented</em>
 the "Mind-born" Sons of Brahma, make the Rishis, Manus,
 and Prajapatis of every kind <em>spring from various parts of
 the body of their primal Progenitor -- </em>Brahma (see Wilson's
 footnote in his <em>Vishnu Purana, </em>Vol. I., p. 102). Because
 the average public is unacquainted with the Kabala, the key to,
 and glossary of, the much veiled Mosaic Books, therefore, the
 clergy imagines the truth will never out. Let any one turn to
 the English, Hebrew, or Latin texts of the Kabala, now so ably
 translated by several scholars, and he will find that the Tetragrammaton,
 which is the Hebrew IHVH, is also both the "Sephirothal Tree"--
 <em>i.e.</em>, it contains all the Sephiroth except Kether, the
 crown -- and the united <em>body </em>of the "Heavenly man"
 (Adam Kadmon) from whose limbs emanate the Universe and everything
 in it. Furthermore, he will find that the idea in the Kabalistic
 Books (the chief of which in the <em>Zohar </em>are the "Books
 of Concealed Mystery," of the "Greater," and the
 "Lesser Holy Assembly") is entirely phallic and far
 more crudely expressed than is the four-fold Brahma in any of
 the Puranas. (See "<em>Kabala Unveiled,</em>"<em> </em>by
 Mr. S. L. Mathers, Chap. xxii., concerning the remaining members
 of Microprosopus). </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 626 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 There are two <em>Tetragrammatons: </em>the Macro and the Microprosopus.
 The first is the <em>absolute </em>perfect Square, or the <strong>T</strong>ETRACTIS
 within the Circle, both abstract conceptions, and is therefore
 called <strong>A</strong>IN -- the Non-being, <em>i.e</em>., illimitable
 or absolute <em>Be-ness. </em>But when viewed as Microprosopus,
 or the "Heavenly man," the manifested Logos, he is the
 <em>triangle in the square </em>-- the<em> sevenfold cube </em>not
 the fourfold, or the plane Square. For it is written in the same
 "Greater Holy Assembly" -- (83): "And concerning
 this, the children of Israel wished to know in their minds, like
 as it is written (<em>Exod. </em>xvii. 7.): 'Is the Tetragrammaton
 in the midst of us, or the Negatively Existent One?'* (<em>Where
 did</em> <em>they distinguish </em>between Microprosopus, who
 is called Tetragrammaton, and between Macroprosopus, who is called
 <strong>A</strong>IN, <em>Ain </em>the negatively existent?) "**
 </p><p>
 Therefore, Tetragrammaton is the THREE <em>made</em> four and
 the FOUR made three, and is represented on this Earth by his seven
 "companions," or "Eyes" -- the "Seven
 eyes of the Lord." Microprosopus is, at best, only a <em>secondary
 </em>manifested Deity. For, verse 1,152 of the "Greater Holy
 Assembly" (Kabala) says --
 </p><p>
 "We have learned that there <em>were ten </em>(companions)
 who entered into the <em>Sod, </em>('mysterious assembly or mystery'),
 and that <em>seven only </em>came forth"*** (<em>i.e.</em>,
 10 for the unmanifested, 7 for the manifested Universe.)
 </p><p>
 1,158. "And when Rabbi Shimeon revealed the <em>Arcana </em>there
 were found none present there save those (seven companions) .
 . . . 1,159. And Rabbi Shimeon called them the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton,
 like as it is written, Zach. iii., 9, 'These are the seven eyes
 (or principles) of Tetragrammaton," ' -<em>- i.e.</em>, the
 four-fold Heavenly man, or pure spirit, is resolved into Septenary
 man, pure matter and Spirit.
 </p><p>
 Thus the Tetrad is <em>Microprosopus, </em>and the latter is the
 male-female Chochmah-Binah, the 2d and 3d Sephiroth. The Tetragrammaton
 is the very essence of number Seven, in its terrestrial significance.
 Seven stands between four and nine -- the basis and foundation
 (astrally) of our physical world and man, in the kingdom of Malkuth.

 is also the "tree of knowledge of good and evil," whose
 chief mystery is that of human procreation. It is a mistake to

 Bible, and <em>is more esoteric </em>than is the latter.

 *** Translators often render the word "companion" (angel,
 also adept) by "<em>Rabbi,</em>"<i> </i>as the Rishis
 are called <em>gurus. </em>The "Zohar" is, if possible,
 more occult than the Books of Moses; to read the "Book of
 Concealed Mystery" one requires the keys furnished by the
 genuine "Chaldean Book of Numbers," which is not extant.
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 627 THE NUMBER SEVEN IN CHEMISTRY. </h6>
 
 <p>
 especially to the Epistle of Peter (I P. ii. 2-5) ought to be
 conclusive. In the old symbolism, man, chiefly the <em>inner</em>
 Spiritual man is called "a stone." Christ is the corner-stone,
 and Peter refers to all men as "lively" (living) stones.
 Therefore a "stone with seven eyes" on it can only mean
 what we say, <em>i.e., </em>a man whose constitution or ("principles,")
 is septenary.
 </p><p>
 To demonstrate more clearly the seven in Nature, it may be added
 that not only does the number seven govern the periodicity of
 the phenomena of life, but that it is also found dominating the
 series of chemical elements, and equally paramount in the world
 of sound and in that of colour as revealed to us by the spectroscope.
 This number is the factor, <em>sine qua non, </em>in the production
 of occult astral phenomena.
 </p><p>
 Thus, if the chemical elements are arranged in groups according
 to their atomic weights, they will be found to constitute a series
 of groups of seven; the first, second, etc., members of each group
 bearing a close analogy in <em>all</em> their properties to the
 corresponding members of the next group. The following table,
 copied from Hellenbach's <em>Magie der Zahlen,</em> exhibits this
 law and fully warrants the conclusion he draws in the following
 words: "We thus see that chemical variety, so far as we can
 grasp its inner nature, depends upon numerical relations, and
 we have further found in this variety a ruling law for which we
 can assign no cause; we find a law of periodicity governed by
 the number <em>seven</em>."
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-627.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 The eighth column in this list is, as it were, the <em>octave
 </em>of the first, containing elements almost identical in chemical
 and other properties with those in the first; a phenomenon which
 accentuates the septenary law of periodicity. For further details
 the reader is referred to Hellenbach's</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 628 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 work, where it is also shown that this classification is confirmed
 by the spectroscopic peculiarities of the elements.
 </p><p>
 It is needless to refer in detail to the number of vibrations
 constituting the notes of the musical scale; they are strictly
 analogous to the scale of chemical elements, and also to the scale
 of colour as unfolded by the spectroscope, although in the latter
 case we deal with only <em>one</em> octave, while both in music
 and chemistry we find a series of <em>seven</em> octaves represented
 theoretically, of which <em>six</em> are fairly complete and in
 ordinary use in both sciences. Thus, to quote Hellenbach: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "It has been established that, from the standpoint of phenomenal
 law, upon which all our knowledge rests, the vibrations of sound
 and light increase regularly, that they divide themselves into
 <em>seven </em>columns, and that the successive numbers in each
 column are closely allied; <em>i.e.</em>, that they exhibit a
 close relationship which not only is expressed in the figures
 themselves, but also is practically confirmed in chemistry as
 in music, in the latter of which the ear confirms the verdict
 of the figures. . . . . . The fact that this periodicity and variety
 is governed by the number <em>seven</em> is undeniable, and it
 far surpasses the limits of mere chance, and must be assumed to
 have an adequate cause, which cause must be discovered."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Verily, then, as Rabbi Abbas said: "We are six lights which
 shine forth from a seventh (<em>light</em>); thou (Tetragrammaton)
 art the seventh light (the origin) of us all;" (V. 1,160)
 and -- "For assuredly there is no stability in those six,
 save what they derive from the seventh. For ALL THINGS DEPEND
 FROM THE SEVENTH." (V. 1,161. Kabala, "The Greater Holy
 Assembly.")
 </p><p>
 The (ancient and modern) Western American Zuni Indians seem to
 have entertained similar views. Their present-day customs, their
 traditions and records, all point to the fact that, from time
 immemorial, their institutions -- political, social and religious
 -- were (and still are) shaped according to the septenary principle.
 Thus all their ancient towns and villages were built in clusters
 of six, around a seventh. It is always a group of seven, or of
 thirteen, and always the six surround the seventh. Again, their
 sacerdotal hierarchy is composed of six "Priests of the House"
 seemingly synthesized in the seventh, who is a woman, the "<strong>P</strong>RIESTESS
 <strong>M</strong>OTHER." Compare this with the "seven
 great officiating priests" spoken of in <em>Anugita, </em>the
 name given to the "seven senses," exoterically, and
 to the seven human principles, <em>esoterically. </em>Whence this
 identity of symbolism? Shall we still doubt the fact of Arjuna
 going over to Patala (the Antipodes, America) and there marrying
 Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga (or rather <em>Nargal</em>)<em>
 </em>King? But to the Zuni priests.
 </p><p>
 These receive an annual tribute, to this day, of corn of seven
 colours. Undistinguished from other Indians during the whole year,
 on a certain day, they come out (the six priests and one priestess)
 arrayed in their</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 629 THE SEVEN PRIESTS OF THE ZUNIS. </h6>
 
 <p>
 priestly robes, each of a colour sacred to the particular God
 whom the priest serves and personifies; each of them representing
 one of the seven regions, and each receiving corn of the colour
 corresponding to that region. Thus, the white represents the East,
 because from the East comes the first Sun-light; the yellow, corresponds
 to the North, from the colour of the flames produced by the <em>aurora
 borealis;</em> the red, the South, as from that quarter comes
 the heat; the blue stands for the West, the colour of the Pacific
 Ocean, which lies to the West; black is the colour of the nether
 underground region -- darkness; corn with grains of all colours
 on one ear represents the colours of the upper region -- of the
 firmament, with its rosy and yellow clouds, shining stars, etc.
 The "speckled" corn -- each grain containing all the
 colours -- is that of the "Priestess-Mother": woman
 containing in herself the seeds of all races past, present and
 future; Eve being the mother of all living.
 </p><p>
 Apart from these was the Sun -- the Great Deity -- whose priest
 was the spiritual head of the nation. These facts were ascertained
 by Mr. F. Hamilton Cushing, who, as many are aware, became an
 Indian Zuni, lived with them, was initiated into their religious
 mysteries, and has learned more about them than any other man
 now living.
 </p><p>
 Seven is also the great magic number. In the occult records the
 weapon mentioned in the Puranas and the <em>Mahabharata --</em>
 the<em> Agneyastra</em> or "fiery weapon" bestowed by
 Aurva upon his chela Sagara -- is said to be built of seven elements.
 This weapon -- supposed by some ingenious Orientalists to have
 been a "rocket" (!) -- is one of the many thorns in
 the side of our modern Sanskritists. Wilson exercises his penetration
 over it, on several pages in his <em>Specimens of the Hindu Theatre,
 </em>and finally fails to explain it. He can make nothing out
 of the <em>Agneyastra.</em> 
 </p><p>
 "These weapons," he argues, "are of a very unintelligible
 character. Some of them are wielded as missiles; but, in general,
 they <em>appear to be</em> <em>mystical powers exercised by the
 individual -- </em>such as those of paralysing an enemy, or <em>locking
 his senses fast in sleep, </em>or bringing down storm, and rain,
 and fire, from heaven. (<em>Vide supra, </em>pp. 427 and 428.)
 . . . . They assume celestial shapes, endowed with human faculties.
 . . . . The <em>Ramayana </em>calls them the Sons of Krisaswa"
 (p. 297).
 </p><p>
 The Sastra-devatas, "gods of the divine weapons," are
 no more Agneyastra, the weapon, than the gunners of modern artillery
 are the cannon they direct. But this simple solution did not seem
 to strike the eminent Sanskritist. Nevertheless, as he himself
 says of the armiform progeny of Krisaswa, "the allegorical
 origin of the (Agneyastra) weapons is, undoubtedly, the more ancient."*
 It is the fiery javelin of Brahma.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
