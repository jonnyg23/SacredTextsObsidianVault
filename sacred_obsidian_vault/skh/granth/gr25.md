 <hr><center><h1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Maaroo</h1></center>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 001</h2></center>
  Raag Maaroo, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  O my Friend, I shall forever remain the dust of Your feet.<br>
  Nanak seeks Your protection, and beholds You ever-present, here and now. ||1||<br>
  SHABAD:<br>
  Those who receive the call in the last hours of the night, chant the Name of their Lord and Master.<br>
  Tents, canopies, pavilions and carriages are prepared and made ready for them.<br>
  You send out the call, Lord, to those who meditate on Your Name. ||1||<br>
  Father, I am unfortunate, a fraud.<br>
  I have not found Your Name; my mind is blind and deluded by doubt. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have enjoyed the tastes, and now my pains have come to fruition; such is my pre-ordained destiny, O my mother.<br>
  Now my joys are few, and my pains are many. In utter agony, I pass my life. ||2||<br>
  What separation could be worse than separation from the Lord? For those who are united with Him, what other union can there be?<br>
  Praise the Lord and Master, who, having created this play, beholds it. ||3||<br>
  By good destiny, this union comes about; this body enjoys its pleasures.<br>
  Those who have lost their destiny, suffer separation from this union. O Nanak, they may still be united once again! ||4||1||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  The union of the mother and father brings the body into being.<br>
  The Creator inscribes upon it the inscription of its destiny.<br>
  According to this inscription, gifts, light and glorious greatness are received.<br>
  Joining with Maya, the spiritual consciousness is lost. ||1||<br>
  O foolish mind, why are you so proud?<br>
  You shall have to arise and depart when it pleases your Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Abandon the tastes of the world, and find intuitive peace.<br>
  All must abandon their worldly homes; no one remains here forever.<br>
  Eat some, and save the rest,<br>
  if you are destined to return to the world again. ||2||<br>
  He adorns his body and ress in silk robes.<br>
  He issues all sorts of commands.<br>
  Preparing his comfortable bed, he sleeps.<br>
  When he falls into the hands of the Messenger of Death, what good does it do to cry out? ||3||<br>
  Household affairs are whirlpools of entanglements, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 002</h2></center>
  Sin is a stone which does not float.<br>
  So let the Fear of God be the boat to carry your soul across.<br>
  Says Nanak, rare are those who are blessed with this Boat. ||4||2||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl, First House:<br>
  Actions are the paper, and the mind is the ink; good and bad are both recorded upon it.<br>
  As their past actions drive them, so are mortals driven. There is no end to Your Glorious Virtues, Lord. ||1||<br>
  Why do you not keep Him in your consciousness, you mad man?<br>
  Forgetting the Lord, your own virtues shall rot away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The night is a net, and the day is a net; there are as many traps as there are moments.<br>
  With relish and delight, you continually bite at the bait; you are trapped, you fool - how will you ever escape? ||2||<br>
  The body is a furnace, and the mind is the iron within it; the five fires are heating it.<br>
  Sin is the charcoal placed upon it, which burns the mind; the tongs are anxiety and worry. ||3||<br>
  What was turned to slag is again transformed into gold, if one meets with the Guru.<br>
  He blesses the mortal with the Ambrosial Name of the One Lord, and then, O Nanak, the body is held steady. ||4||3||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  In the pure, immaculate waters, both the lotus and the slimy scum are found.<br>
  The lotus flower is with the scum and the water, but it remains untouched by any pollution. ||1||<br>
  You frog, you will never understand.<br>
  You eat the dirt, while you dwell in the immaculate waters. You know nothing of the ambrosial nectar there. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You dwell continually in the water; the bumble bee does not dwell there, but it is intoxicated with its fragrance from afar.<br>
  Intuitively sensing the moon in the distance, the lotus bows its head. ||2||<br>
  The realms of nectar are irrigated with milk and honey; you think you are clever to live in the water.<br>
  You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the love of the flea for blood. ||3||<br>
  The fool may live with the Pandit, the religious scholar, and listen to the Vedas and the Shaastras.<br>
  You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the crooked tail of the dog. ||4||<br>
  Some are hypocrites; they do not merge with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Some are absorbed in the Feet of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  The mortals obtain what they are predestined to receive; O Nanak, with your tongue, chant the Naam. ||5||4||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl,<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  Countless sinners are sanctified, attaching their minds to the Feet of the Lord.<br>
  The merits of the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage are found in God's Name, O Nanak, when such destiny is inscribed upon one's forehead. ||1||<br>
  SHABAD:<br>
  O friends and companions, so puffed up with pride,<br>
  listen to this one joyous story of your Husband Lord. ||1||<br>
  Who can I tell about my pain, O my mother?<br>
  Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive; how can I comfort it, O my mother? ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am a dejected, discarded bride, totally miserable.<br>
  I have lost my youth; I regret and repent. ||2||<br>
  You are my wise Lord and Master, above my head.<br>
  I serve You as Your humble slave. ||3||<br>
  Nanak humbly prays, this is my only concern:<br>
  without the Blessed Vision of my Beloved, how can I enjoy Him? ||4||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 003</h2></center>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  I am Your slave, Your bonded servant, and so I am called fortunate.<br>
  I sold myself at Your store in exchange for the Guru's Word; whatever You link me to, to that I am linked. ||1||<br>
  What cleverness can Your servant try with You?<br>
  O my Lord and Master, I cannot carry out the Hukam of Your Command. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My mother is Your slave, and my father is Your slave; I am the child of Your slaves.<br>
  My slave mother dances, and my slave father sings; I practice devotional worship to You, O my Sovereign Lord. ||2||<br>
  If You wish to drink, then I shall get water for You; if You wish to eat, I shall grind the corn for You.<br>
  I wave the fan over You, and wash Your feet, and continue to chant Your Name. ||3||<br>
  I have been untrue to myself, but Nanak is Your slave; please forgive him, by Your glorious greatness.<br>
  Since the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You have been the merciful and generous Lord. Without You, liberation cannot be attained. ||4||6||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  Some call him a ghost; some say that he is a demon.<br>
  Some call him a mere mortal; O, poor Nanak! ||1||<br>
  Crazy Nanak has gone insane, after his Lord, the King.<br>
  I know of none other than the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He alone is known to be insane, when he goes insane with the Fear of God.<br>
  He recognizes none other than the One Lord and Master. ||2||<br>
  He alone is known to be insane, if he works for the One Lord.<br>
  Recognizing the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, what other cleverness is there? ||3||<br>
  He alone is known to be insane, when he falls in love with his Lord and Master.<br>
  He sees himself as bad, and all the rest of the world as good. ||4||7||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  This wealth is all-pervading, permeating all.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh wanders around, thinking that it is far away. ||1||<br>
  That commodity, the wealth of the Naam, is within my heart.<br>
  Whoever You bless with it, is emancipated. ||1||Pause||<br>
  This wealth does not burn; it cannot be stolen by a thief.<br>
  This wealth does not drown, and its owner is never punished. ||2||<br>
  Gaze upon the glorious greatness of this wealth,<br>
  and your nights and days will pass, imbued with celestial peace. ||3||<br>
  Listen to this incomparably beautiful story, O my brothers, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Tell me, without this wealth, who has ever obtained the supreme status? ||4||<br>
  Nanak humbly prays, I proclaim the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.<br>
  If one meets the True Guru, then this wealth is obtained. ||5||8||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  Heat up the sun energy of the right nostril, and cool down the moon energy of the left nostril; practicing this breath-control, bring them into perfect balance.<br>
  In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall will not crumble. ||1||<br>
  You fool, why are you deluded by doubt?<br>
  You do not remember the detached Lord of supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Seize and burn the unbearable; seize and kill the imperishable; leave behind your doubts, and then, you shall drink in the Nectar.<br>
  In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not crumble. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 004</h2></center>
  Nanak humbly prays, if the Lord's humble servant dwells upon Him, in his mind of minds, with his every breath, then he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not crumble. ||3||9||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  Maya is not conquered, and the mind is not subdued; the waves of desire in the world-ocean are intoxicating wine.<br>
  The boat crosses over the water, carrying the true merchandise.<br>
  The jewel within the mind subdues the mind; attached to the Truth, it is not broken.<br>
  The king is seated upon the throne, imbued with the Fear of God and the five qualities. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, do not see your True Lord and Master as being far away.<br>
  He is the Light of all, the Life of the world; The True Lord writes His Inscription on each and every head. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Brahma and Vishnu, the Rishis and the silent sages, Shiva and Indra, penitents and beggars<br>
  - whoever obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, looks beautiful in the Court of the True Lord, while the stubborn rebels die.<br>
  The wandering beggars, warriors, celibates and Sannyaasee hermits - through the Perfect Guru, consider this:<br>
  without selfless service, no one ever receives the fruits of their rewards. Serving the Lord is the most excellent action. ||2||<br>
  You are the wealth of the poor, the Guru of the guru-less, the honor of the dishonored.<br>
  I am blind; I have grasped hold of the jewel, the Guru. You are the strength of the weak.<br>
  He is not known through burnt offerings and ritual chanting; the True Lord is known through the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one finds shelter in the Court of the Lord; the false come and go in reincarnation. ||3||<br>
  So praise the True Name, and through the True Name, you will find satisfaction.<br>
  When the mind is cleaned with the jewel of spiritual wisdom, it does not become dirty again.<br>
  As long as the Lord and Master dwells in the mind, no obstacles are encountered.<br>
  O Nanak, giving one's head, one is emancipated, and the mind and body become true. ||4||10||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  The Yogi who is joined to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is pure; he is not stained by even a particle of dirt.<br>
  The True Lord, his Beloved, is always with him; the rounds of birth and death are ended for him. ||1||<br>
  O Lord of the Universe, what is Your Name, and what is it like?<br>
  If You summon me into the Mansion of Your Presence, I will ask You, how I can become one with You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He alone is a Brahmin, who takes his cleansing bath in the spiritual wisdom of God, and whose leaf-offerings in worship are the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  The One Name, the One Lord, and His One Light pervade the three worlds. ||2||<br>
  My tongue is the balance of the scale, and this heart of mine is the pan of the scale; I weigh the immeasurable Naam.<br>
  There is one store, and one banker above all; the merchants deal in the one commodity. ||3||<br>
  The True Guru saves us at both ends; he alone understands, who is lovingly focused on the One Lord; his inner being remains free of doubt.<br>
  The Word of the Shabad abides within, and doubt is ended, for those who constantly serve, day and night. ||4||<br>
  Above is the sky of the mind, and beyond this sky is the Lord, the Protector of the World; the Inaccessible Lord God; the Guru abides there as well.<br>
  According to the Word of the Guru's Teachings, what is outside is the same as what is inside the home of the self. Nanak has become a detached renunciate. ||5||11||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 005</h2></center>
  Raag Maaroo, First Mehl, Fifth House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Day and night, he remains awake and aware; he never sleeps or dreams.<br>
  He alone knows this, who feels the pain of separation from God.<br>
  My body is pierced through with the arrow of love. How can any physician know the cure? ||1||<br>
  Rare is that one, who as Gurmukh, understands, and whom the True Lord links to His Praise.<br>
  He alone appreciates the value of the Ambsosial Nectar, who deals in this Ambrosia. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The soul-bride is in love with her Husband Lord;<br>
  the focuses her consciousness on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  The soul-bride is joyously embellished with intuitive ease; her hunger and thirst are taken away. ||2||<br>
  Tear down skepticism and dispel your doubt;<br>
  with your intuition, draw the bow of the Praise of the Lord.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, conquer and subdue your mind; take the support of Yoga - Union with the beautiful Lord. ||3||<br>
  Burnt by egotism, one forgets the Lord from his mind.<br>
  In the City of Death, he is attacked with massive swords.<br>
  Then, even if he asks for it, he will not receive the Lord's Name; O soul, you shall suffer terrible punishment. ||4||<br>
  You are distracted by thoughts of Maya and worldly attachment.<br>
  In the City of Death, you will be caught by the noose of the Messenger of Death.<br>
  You cannot break free from the bondage of loving attachment, and so the Messenger of Death will torture you. ||5||<br>
  I have done nothing; I am doing nothing now.<br>
  The True Guru has blessed me with the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam.<br>
  What other efforts can anyone make, when You bestow Your blessing? Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||6||1||12||<br>
  Maaroo, Third Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Wherever You seat me, there I sit, O my Lord and Master; wherever You send me, there I go.<br>
  In the entire village, there is only One King; all places are sacred. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, while I dwell in this body, let me sing Your True Praises,<br>
  that I may intuitively merge with You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He thinks that good and bad deeds come from himself; this is the source of all evil.<br>
  Whatever happens in this world is only by the Order of our Lord and Master. ||2||<br>
  Sexual desires are so strong and compelling; where has this sexual desire come from?<br>
  The Creator Himself stages all the plays; how rare are those who realize this. ||3||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one is lovingly focused on the One Lord, and then, duality is ended.<br>
  Whatever is in harmony with His Will, he accepts as True; the noose of Death is loosened from around his neck. ||4||<br>
  Prays Nanak, who can call him to account, when the egotistical pride of his mind has been silenced?<br>
  Even the Righteous Judge of Dharma is intimidated and afraid of him; he has entered the Sanctuary of the True Lord. ||5||1||<br>
  Maaroo, Third Mehl:<br>
  Coming and going in reincarnation no longer exist, when one dwells in the home of the self within.<br>
  He bestowed the Blessing of His treasure of truth; only He Himself knows. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 006</h2></center>
  O my mind, remember the Dear Lord, and abandon the corruption of your mind.<br>
  Meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad; focus lovingly on the Truth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who forgets the Name in this world, shall not find any place of rest anywhere else.<br>
  He shall wander in all sorts of reincarnations, and rot away in manure. ||2||<br>
  By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, according to my pre-ordained destiny, O my mother.<br>
  Night and day, I practice true devotional worship; I am united with the True Lord. ||3||<br>
  He Himself fashioned the entire universe; He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glorious and great; as He pleases, He bestows His Blessings. ||4||2||<br>
  Maaroo, Third Mehl:<br>
  Please forgive my past mistakes, O my Dear Lord; now, please place me on the Path.<br>
  I remain attached to the Lord's Feet, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Remain attached forever to the Lord's Feet, single-mindedly, with love for the One Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have no social status or honor; I have no place or home.<br>
  Pierced through by the Word of the Shabad, my doubts have been cut away. The Guru has inspired me to understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  This mind wanders around, driven by greed, totally attached to greed.<br>
  He is engrossed in false pursuits; he shall endure beatings in the City of Death. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, God Himself Himself is all-in-all. There is no other at all.<br>
  He bestows the treasure of devotional worship, and the Gurmukhs abide in peace. ||4||3||<br>
  Maaroo, Third Mehl:<br>
  Seek and find those who are imbued with Truth; they are so rare in this world.<br>
  Meeting with them, one's face becomes radiant and bright, chanting the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, contemplate and cherish the True Lord and Master within your heart.<br>
  Seek out and see, and ask your True Guru, and obtain the true commodity. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All serve the One True Lord; through pre-ordained destiny, they meet Him.<br>
  The Gurmukhs merge with Him, and will not be separated from Him again; they attain the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  Some do not appreciate the value of devotional worship; the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt.<br>
  They are fillled with self-conceit; they cannot accomplish anything. ||3||<br>
  Stand and offer your prayer, to the One who cannot be moved by force.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within the mind of the Gurmukh; hearing his prayer, the Lord applauds him. ||4||4||<br>
  Maaroo, Third Mehl:<br>
  He transforms the burning desert into a cool oasis; he transmutes rusted iron into gold.<br>
  So praise the True Lord; there is none other as great as He is. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, night and day, meditate on the Lord's Name.<br>
  Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Teachings, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. ||1||Pause||<br>
  As Gurmukh, one comes to know the One Lord, when the True Guru instructs him.<br>
  Praise the True Guru, who imparts this understanding. ||2||<br>
  Those who forsake the True Guru, and attach themselves to duality - what will they do when they go to the world hereafter?<br>
  Bound and gagged in the City of Death, they will be beaten. They will be punished severely. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 007</h2></center>
  My God is independent and self-sufficient; he does not have even an iota of greed.<br>
  O Nanak, run to His Sanctuary; granting His forgiveness, He merges us into Himself. ||4||5||<br>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Second House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Suk-deva and Janak meditated on the Naam; following the Guru's Teachings, they sought the Sanctuary of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  God met Sudama and removed his poverty; through loving devotional worship, he crossed over.<br>
  God is the Lover of His devotees; the Lord's Name is fufilling; God showers His Mercy on the Gurmukhs. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will be saved.<br>
  Dhroo, Prahlaad and Bidar the slave-girl's son, became Gurmukh, and through the Naam, crossed over. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Naam is the supreme wealth; it saves the humble devotees.<br>
  All the faults of Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan and Ravi Daas the leather-worker were covered.<br>
  Those who become Gurmukh, and remain attached to the Naam, are saved; all their sins are washed off. ||2||<br>
  Whoever chants the Naam, all his sins and mistakes are taken away.<br>
  Ajaamal, who had sex with prostitites, was saved, by chanting the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Chanting the Naam, Ugar Sain obtained salvation; his bonds were broken, and he was liberated. ||3||<br>
  God Himself takes pity on His humble servants, and makes them His own.<br>
  My Lord of the Universe saves the honor of His servants; those who seek His Sanctuary are saved.<br>
  The Lord has showered servant Nanak with His Mercy; he has enshrined the Lord's Name within his heart. ||4||1||<br>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The Siddhas in Samaadhi meditate on Him; they are lovingly focused on Him. The seekers and the silent sages meditate on Him as well.<br>
  The celibates, the true and contented beings meditate on Him; Indra and the other gods chant His Name with their mouths.<br>
  Those who seek His Sanctuary meditate on Him; they become Gurmukh and swim across. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and cross over.<br>
  Dhanna the farmer, and Balmik the highway robber, became Gurmukh, and crossed over. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Angels, men, heavenly heralds and celestial singers meditate on Him; even the humble Rishis sing of the Lord.<br>
  Shiva, Brahma and the goddess Lakhshmi, meditate, and chant with their mouths the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Those whose minds are drenched with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, as Gurmukh, cross over. ||2||<br>
  Millions and millions, three hundred thirty million gods meditate on Him; there is no end to those who meditate on the Lord.<br>
  The Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees meditate on the Lord; the Pandits, the religious scholars, sing the Lord's Praises as well.<br>
  Those whose minds are filled with the Naam, the source of nectar - as Gurmukh, they cross over. ||3||<br>
  Those who chant the Naam in endless waves - I cannot even count their number.<br>
  The Lord of the Universe bestows His Mercy, and those who are pleasing to the Mind of the Lord God, find their place.<br>
  The Guru, granting His Grace, implants the Lord's Name within; servant Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 008</h2></center>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Third House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Take the treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Follow the Guru's Teachings, and the Lord shall bless you with honor.<br>
  Here and hereafter, the Lord goes with you; in the end, He shall deliver you.<br>
  Where the path is difficult and the street is narrow, there the Lord shall liberate you. ||1||<br>
  O my True Guru, implant within me the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  The Lord is my mother, father, child and relative; I have none other than the Lord, O my mother. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I feel the pains of love and yearning for the Lord, and the Name of the Lord. If only someone would come and unite me with Him, O my mother.<br>
  I bow in humble devotion to one who inspires me to meet with my Beloved.<br>
  The almighty and merciful True Guru unites me with the Lord God instantaneously. ||2||<br>
  Those who do not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are most unfortunate, and are slaughtered.<br>
  They wander in reincarnation, again and again; they die, and are re-born, and continue coming and going.<br>
  Bound and gagged at Death's Door, they are cruelly beaten, and punished in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  O God, I seek Your Sanctuary; O my Sovereign Lord King, please unite me with Yourself.<br>
  O Lord, Life of the World, please shower me with Your Mercy; grant me the Sanctuary of the Guru, the True Guru.<br>
  The Dear Lord, becoming merciful, has blended servant Nanak with Himself. ||4||1||3||<br>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  I inquire about the commodity of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Is there anyone who can show me the wealth, the capital of the Lord?<br>
  I cut myself into pieces, and make myself a sacrifice to that one who leads me to meet my Lord God.<br>
  I am filled with the Love of my Beloved; how can I meet my Friend, and merge with Him? ||1||<br>
  O my beloved friend, my mind, I take the wealth, the capital of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me; the Lord is my support - I celebrate the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  O my Guru, please unite me with the Lord, Har, Har; show me the wealth, the capital of the Lord.<br>
  Without the Guru, love does not well up; see this, and know it in your mind.<br>
  The Lord has installed Himself within the Guru; so praise the Guru, who unites us with the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The ocean, the treasure of devotional worship of the Lord, rests with the Perfect True Guru.<br>
  When it pleases the True Guru, He opens the treasure, and and the Gurmukhs are illuminated by the Lord's Light.<br>
  The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs die of thirst, on the very bank of the river. ||3||<br>
  The Guru is the Great Giver; I beg for this gift from the Guru,<br>
  that He may unite me with God, from whom I was separated for so long! This is the great hope of my mind and body.<br>
  If it pleases You, O my Guru, please listen to my prayer; this is servant Nanak's prayer. ||4||2||4||<br>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  O Lord God, please preach Your sermon to me. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is merged into my heart.<br>
  Meditate on the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, O very fortunate ones; the Lord shall bless you with the most sublime status of Nirvaanaa.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 009</h2></center>
  The minds of the Gurmukhs are filled with faith; through the Perfect Guru, they merge in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.<br>
  Continually and forever, speak the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har; as Gurmukh, speak the Unspoken Speech. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have searched through and through my mind and body; how can I attain this Unspoken Speech?<br>
  Meeting with the humble Saints, I have found it; listening to the Unspoken Speech, my mind is pleased.<br>
  The Lord's Name is the Support of my mind and body; I am united with the all-knowing Primal Lord God. ||2||<br>
  The Guru, the Primal Being, has united me with the Primal Lord God. My consciousness has merged into the supreme consciousness.<br>
  By great good fortune, I serve the Guru, and I have found my Lord, all-wise and all-knowing.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are very unfortunate; they pass their life-night in misery and pain. ||3||<br>
  I am just a meek beggar at Your Door, God; please, place the Ambrosial Word of Your Bani in my mouth.<br>
  The True Guru is my friend; He unites me with my all-wise, all-knowing Lord God.<br>
  Servant Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary; grant Your Grace, and merge me into Your Name. ||4||3||5||<br>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Detached from the world, I am in love with the Lord; by great good fortune, I have enshrined the Lord within my mind.<br>
  Joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, faith has welled up within me; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I taste the sublime essence of the Lord.<br>
  My mind and body have totally blossomed forth; through the Word of the Guru's Bani, I chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O my beloved mind, my friend, taste the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, I have found the Lord, who saves my honor, here and hereafter. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; as Gurmukh, taste the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.<br>
  Plant the seed of the Lord in the body-farm. The Lord God is enshrined within the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. Through the Perfect Guru, taste the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are filled with hunger and thirst; their minds run around in the ten directions, hoping for great wealth.<br>
  Without the Name of the Lord, their life is cursed; the manmukhs are stuck in manure.<br>
  They come and go, and are consigned to wander through uncounted incarnations, eating stinking rot. ||3||<br>
  Begging, imploring, I seek Your Sanctuary; Lord, shower me with Your Mercy, and save me, God.<br>
  Lead me to join the Society of the Saints, and bless me with the honor and glory of the Lord's Name.<br>
  I have obtained the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; servant Nanak chants the Lord's Name, through the Guru's Teachings. ||4||4||6||<br>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Fifth House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Devotional worship to the Lord, Har, Har, is an overflowing treasure.<br>
  The Gurmukh is emancipated by the Lord.<br>
  One who is blessed by the Mercy of my Lord and Master sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, Har, Har, take pity on me,<br>
  that within my heart, I may dwell upon You, Lord, forever and ever.<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, you shall be emancipated. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 010</h2></center>
  The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is the ocean of peace.<br>
  The beggar begs for it; O Lord, please bless him, in Your kindness.<br>
  True, True is the Lord; the Lord is forever True; the True Lord is pleasing to my mind. ||2||<br>
  The nine holes pour out filth.<br>
  Chanting the Lord's Name, they are all purified and sanctified.<br>
  When my Lord and Master is totally pleased, He leads the mortal to meditate in remembrance on the Lord, and then his filth is taken away. ||3||<br>
  Attachment to Maya is terribly treacherous.<br>
  How can one cross over the difficult world-ocean?<br>
  The True Lord bestows the boat of the True Guru; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across. ||4||<br>
  You are everywhere; all are Yours.<br>
  Whatever You do, God, that alone comes to pass.<br>
  Poor servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; as it pleases the Lord, He bestows His approval. ||5||1||7||<br>
  Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind.<br>
  The Lord shall eradicate all your sins.<br>
  Treasure the Lord's wealth, and gather in the Lord's wealth; when you depart in the end, the Lord shall go along with you as your only friend and companion. ||1||<br>
  He alone meditates on the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace.<br>
  He continually chants the Lord's Chant; meditating on the Lord, one finds peace.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the sublime essence of the Lord is obtained. Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The fearless, formless Lord - the Name is Truth.<br>
  To chant it is the most sublime and exalted activity in this world.<br>
  Doing so, the Messenger of Death, the evil enemy, is killed. Death does not even approach the Lord's servant. ||2||<br>
  One whose mind is satisfied with the Lord<br>
  - that servant is known throughout the four ages, in all four directions.<br>
  If some sinner speaks evil of him, the Messenger of Death chews him up. ||3||<br>
  The One Pure Creator Lord is in all.<br>
  He stages all His wondrous plays, and watches them.<br>
  Who can kill that person, whom the Lord has saved? The Creator Lord Himself delivers him. ||4||<br>
  I chant the Name of the Creator Lord, night and day.<br>
  He saves all His servants and devotees.<br>
  Consult the eighteen Puraanas and the four Vedas; O servant Nanak, only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, will deliver you. ||5||2||8||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The earth, the Akaashic ethers and the stars abide in the Fear of God. The almighty Order of the Lord is over the heads of all.<br>
  Wind, water and fire abide in the Fear of God; poor Indra abides in the Fear of God as well. ||1||<br>
  I have heard one thing, that the One Lord alone is fearless.<br>
  He alone is at peace, and he alone is embellished forever, who meets with the Guru, and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The embodied and the divine beings abide in the Fear of God. The Siddhas and seekers die in the Fear of God.<br>
  The 8.4 millions species of beings die, and die again, and are born over and over again. They are consigned to reincarnation. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 011</h2></center>
  Those who embody the energies of sattva-white light, raajas-red passion, and taamas-black darkness, abide in the Fear of God, along with the many created forms.<br>
  This miserable deceiver Maya abides in the Fear of God; the Righteous Judge of Dharma is utterly afraid of Him as well. ||3||<br>
  The entire expanse of the Universe is in the Fear of God; only the Creator Lord is without this Fear.<br>
  Says Nanak, God is the companion of His devotees; His devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord. ||4||1||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The five year old orphan boy Dhroo, by meditating in remembrance on the Lord, became stationary and permanent.<br>
  For the sake of his son, Ajaamal called out, "O Lord, Naaraayan", who struck down and killed the Messenger of Death. ||1||<br>
  My Lord and Master has saved many, countless beings.<br>
  I am meek, with little or no understanding, and unworthy; I seek protection at the Lord's Door. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Baalmeek the outcaste was saved, and the poor hunter was saved as well.<br>
  The elephant remembered the Lord in his mind for an instant, and so was carried across. ||2||<br>
  He saved His devotee Prahlaad, and tore Harnaakhash with his nails.<br>
  Bidar, the son of a slave-girl, was purified, and all his generations were redeemed. ||3||<br>
  What sins of mine should I speak of? I am intoxicated with false emotional attachment.<br>
  Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord; please, reach out and take me into Your embrace. ||4||2||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  For the sake of riches, I wandered around in so many ways; I rushed around, making all sorts of efforts.<br>
  The deeds I did in egotism and pride, have all been done in vain. ||1||<br>
  Other days are of no use to me;<br>
  please bless me with those days, O Dear God, on which I may sing the Lord's Praises. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Gazing upon children, spouse, household and possessions, one is entangled in these.<br>
  Tasting the wine of Maya, one is intoxicated, and never sings of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||<br>
  In this way, I have examined lots of methods, but without the Saints, it is not found.<br>
  You are the Great Giver, the great and almighty God; I have come to beg a gift from You. ||3||<br>
  Abandoning all pride and self-importance, I have sought the Sanctuary of the dust of the feet of the Lord's slave.<br>
  Says Nanak, meeting with the Lord, I have become one with Him; I have found supreme bliss and peace. ||4||3||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  In what place is the Name established? Where does egotism dwell?<br>
  What injury have you suffered, listening to abuse from someone else's mouth? ||1||<br>
  Listen: who are you, and where did you come from?<br>
  You don't even know how long you will stay here; you have no hint of when you shall leave. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wind and water have patience and tolerance; the earth has compassion and forgiveness, no doubt.<br>
  The union of the five tattvas - the five elements - has brought you into being. Which of these is evil? ||2||<br>
  The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, formed your form; He also burdened you with egotism.<br>
  He alone is born and dies; He alone comes and goes. ||3||<br>
  Nothing of the color and the form of the creation shall remain; the entire expanse is transitory.<br>
  Prays Nanak, when He brings His play to its close, then only the One, the One Lord remains. ||4||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 012</h2></center>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Pride, emotional attachment, greed and corruption are gone; I have not placed anything else, other than the Lord, within my consciousness.<br>
  I have purchased the jewel of the Naam and the Glorious Praises of the Lord; loading this merchandise, I have set out on my journey. ||1||<br>
  The love which the Lord's servant feels for the Lord lasts forever.<br>
  In my life, I served my Lord and Master, and as I depart, I keep Him enshrined in my consciousness. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have not turned my face away from my Lord and Master's Command.<br>
  He fills my household with celestial peace and bliss; if He asks me to leave, I leave at once. ||2||<br>
  When I am under the Lord's Command, I find even hunger pleasurable; I know no difference between sorrow and joy.<br>
  Whatever the Command of my Lord and Master is, I bow my forehead and accept it. ||3||<br>
  The Lord and Master has become merciful to His servant; He has embellished both this world and the next.<br>
  Blessed is that servant, and fruitful is his birth; O Nanak, he realizes his Lord and Master. ||4||5||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Good karma has dawned for me - my Lord and Master has become merciful. I sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  My struggle is ended; I have found peace and tranquility. All my wanderings have ceased. ||1||<br>
  Now, I have obtained the state of eternal life.<br>
  The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, has come into my conscious mind; I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment are eradicated; all my enemies are eliminated.<br>
  He is always ever-present, here and now, watching over me; He is never far away. ||2||<br>
  In peace and cool tranquility, my faith has been totally fulfilled; the Saints are my Helpers and Support.<br>
  He has purified the sinners in an instant; I cannot express His Glorious Praises. ||3||<br>
  I have become fearless; all fear has departed. The feet of the Lord of the Universe are my only Shelter.<br>
  Nanak sings the Praises of his Lord and Master; night and day, he is lovingly focused on Him. ||4||6||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He is all-powerful, the Master of all virtues, but you never sing of Him!<br>
  You shall have to leave all this in an instant, but again and again, you chase after it. ||1||<br>
  Why do you not contemplate your God?<br>
  You are entangled in association with your enemies, and the enjoyment of pleasures; your soul is burning up with them! ||1||Pause||<br>
  Hearing His Name, the Messenger of Death will release you, and yet, you do not enter His Sanctuary!<br>
  Turn out this wretched jackal, and seek the Shelter of that God. ||2||<br>
  Praising Him, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and yet, you have not fallen in love with Him!<br>
  This meager, short-lived dream, this thing - you are engrossed in it, over and over again. ||3||<br>
  When our Lord and Master, the ocean of mercy, grants His Grace, one finds honor in the Society of the Saints.<br>
  Says Nanak, I am rid of the illusion of the three-phased Maya, when God becomes my help and support. ||4||7||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything; what can anyone hide from Him?<br>
  Your hands and feet will fall off in an instant, when you are burnt in the fire. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 013</h2></center>
  You fool, you have forgotten the Lord from your mind!<br>
  You eat His salt, and then you are untrue to Him; before your very eyes, you shall be torn apart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The incurable disease has arisen in your body; it cannot be removed or overcome.<br>
  Forgetting God, one endures utter agony; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has realized. ||2||8||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have enshrined the lotus feet of God within my consciousness.<br>
  I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, continually, continuously.<br>
  There is none other than Him at all.<br>
  He alone exists, in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end. ||1||<br>
  He Himself is the Shelter of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The entire universe is under His control.<br>
  He Himself, the Formless Lord, is Himself by Himself.<br>
  Nanak holds tight to that True Lord.<br>
  He has found peace, and shall never suffer pain again. ||2||9||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Third House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  He is the Giver of peace to the breath of life, the Giver of life to the soul; how can you forget Him, you ignorant person?<br>
  You taste the weak, insipid wine, and you have gone insane. You have uselessly wasted this precious human life. ||1||<br>
  O man, such is the foolishness you practice.<br>
  Renouncing the Lord, the Support of the earth, you wander, deluded by doubt; you are engrossed in emotional attachment, associating with Maya, the slave-girl. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Abandoning the Lord, the Support of the earth, you serve her of lowly ancestry, and you pass you life acting egotistically.<br>
  You do useless deeds, you ignorant person; this is why you are called a blind, self-willed manmukh. ||2||<br>
  That which is true, you believe to be untrue; what is transitory, you believe to be permanent.<br>
  You grasp as your own, what belongs to others; in such delusions you are deluded. ||3||<br>
  The Kh'shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas all cross over, through the Name of the One Lord.<br>
  Guru Nanak speaks the Teachings; whoever listens to them is carried across. ||4||1||10||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You may act in secrecy, but God is still with you; you can only deceive other people.<br>
  Forgetting your Dear Lord, you enjoy corrupt pleasures, and so you shall have to embrace red-hot pillars. ||1||<br>
  O man, why do you go out to the households of others?<br>
  You filthy, heartless, lustful donkey! Haven't you heard of the Righteous Judge of Dharma? ||1||Pause||<br>
  The stone of corruption is tied around your neck, and the load of slander is on your head.<br>
  You must cross over the vast open ocean, but you cannot cross over to the other side. ||2||<br>
  You are engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment; you have turned your eyes away from the Truth.<br>
  You cannot even raise your head above the water of the vast, impassable sea of Maya. ||3||<br>
  The sun is liberated, and the moon is liberated; the God-realized being is pure and untouched.<br>
  His inner nature is like that of fire, untouched and forever immaculate. ||4||<br>
  When good karma dawns, the wall of doubt is torn down. He lovingly accepts the Guru's Will.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 014</h2></center>
  One who is blessed with the medicine of the GurMantra, the Name of the Lord, O servant Nanak, does not suffer the agonies of reincarnation. ||5||2||<br>
  O man, in this way, you shall cross over to the other side.<br>
  Meditate on your Dear Lord, and be dead to the world; renounce your love of duality. ||Second Pause||2||11||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have quit searching outside; the Guru has shown me that God is within the home of my own heart.<br>
  I have seen God, fearless, of wondrous beauty; my mind shall never leave Him to go anywhere else. ||1||<br>
  I have found the jewel; I have found the Perfect Lord.<br>
  The invaluable value cannot be obtained; in His Mercy, the Guru bestows it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Supreme Lord God is imperceptible and unfathomable; meeting the Holy Saint, I speak the Unspoken Speech.<br>
  The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds in the Tenth Gate; the Ambrosial Naam trickles down there. ||2||<br>
  I lack nothing; the thirsty desires of my mind are satisfied. The inexhaustible treasure has entered into my being.<br>
  I serve the feet, the feet, the feet of the Guru, and manage the unmanageable. I have found the juice, the sublime essence. ||3||<br>
  Intuitively I come, and intuively I go; my mind intuitively plays.<br>
  Says Nanak, when the Guru drives out doubt, then the soul-bride enters the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||3||12||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You feel no love for the One who created and embellished you.<br>
  The seed, planted out season, does not germinate; it does not produce flower or fruit. ||1||<br>
  O mind, this is the time to plant the seed of the Name.<br>
  Focus your mind, and cultivate this crop; at the proper time, make this your purpose. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Eradicate the stubbornness and doubt of your mind, and go to the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<br>
  He alone does such deeds, who has such pre-ordained karma. ||2||<br>
  He falls in love with the Lord of the Universe, and his efforts are approved.<br>
  My crop has germinated, and it shall never be used up. ||3||<br>
  I have obtained the priceless wealth, which shall never leave me or go anywhere else.<br>
  Says Nanak, I have found peace; I am satisfied and fulfilled. ||4||4||13||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The egg of doubt has burst; my mind has been enlightened.<br>
  The Guru has shattered the shackles on my feet, and has set me free. ||1||<br>
  My coming and going in reincarnation is ended.<br>
  The boiling cauldron has cooled down; the Guru has blessed me with the cooling, soothing Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Since I joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, those who were eyeing me have left.<br>
  The one who tied me up, has released me; what can the Watchman of Death do to me now? ||2||<br>
  The load of my karma has been removed, and I am now free of karma.<br>
  I have crossed the world-ocean, and reached the other shore; the Guru has blessed me with this Dharma. ||3||<br>
  True is my place, and True is my seat; I have made Truth my life's purpose.<br>
  True is my capital, and True is the merchandise, which Nanak has placed into the home of the heart. ||4||5||14||<br>

  The Pandit, the religious scholar, proclaims the Vedas, but he is slow to act on them.<br>
  Another person on silence sits alone, but his heart is tied in knots of desire.<br>
  Another becomes an Udaasi, a renunciate; he abandons his home and walks out on his family, but his wandering impulses do not leave him. ||1||<br>
  Who can I tell about the state of my soul?<br>
  Where can I find such a person who is liberated, and who can unite me with my God? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Someone may practice intensive meditation, and discipline his body, but his mind still runs around in ten directions.<br>
  The celibate practices celibacy, but his heart is filled with pride.<br>
  The Sannyaasi wanders around at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, but his mindless anger is still within him. ||2||<br>
  The temple dancers tie bells around their ankles to earn their living.<br>
  Others go on fasts, take vows, perform the six rituals and wear religious robes for show.<br>
  Some sing songs and melodies and hymns, but their minds do not sing of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<br>
  The Lord's Saints are immaculately pure; they are beyond pleasure and pain, beyond greed and attachment.<br>
  My mind obtains the dust of their feet, when the Lord God shows mercy.<br>
  Says Nanak, I met the Perfect Guru, and then the anxiety of my mind was removed. ||4||<br>
  My Sovereign Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  The Beloved of my soul knows everything; all trivial talk is forgotten. ||1||Second Pause||6||15||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One who has Your Name in his heart is the king of all the hundreds of thousands and millions of beings.<br>
  Those, whom my True Guru has not blessed with Your Name, are poor idiots, who die and are reborn. ||1||<br>
  My True Guru protects and preserves my honor.<br>
  When You come to mind, Lord, then I obtain perfect honor. Forgetting You, I roll in the dust. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The mind's pleasures of love and beauty bring just as many blames and sins.<br>
  The Name of the Lord is the treasure of Emancipation; it is absolute peace and poise. ||2||<br>
  The pleasures of Maya fade away in an instant, like the shade of a passing cloud.<br>
  They alone are dyed in the deep crimson of the Lord's Love, who meet the Guru, and sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<br>
  My Lord and Master is lofty and exalted, grand and infinite. The Darbaar of His Court is inaccessible.<br>

  Meeting with the True Guru, one is emancipated. ||2||<br>
  All the deeds done in egotism,<br>
  are just chains around the neck.<br>
  Harboring self-conceit and self-interest<br>
  is just like placing chains around one's ankles.<br>
  He alone meets with the Guru, and realizes the One Lord,<br>
  who has such destiny written on his forehead. ||3||<br>
  He alone meets the Lord, who is pleasing to His Mind.<br>

  Maya, the enticer, has enticed the world of the three gunas, the three qualities.<br>
  The false world is engrossed in greed.<br>
  Crying out, "Mine, mine!" they collect possessions, but in the end, they are all deceived. ||1||<br>
  The Lord is fearless, formless and merciful.<br>
  He is the Cherisher of all beings and creatures. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Some collect wealth, and bury it in the ground.<br>
  Some cannot abandon wealth, even in their dreams.<br>
  The king exercises his power, and fills his money-bags, but this fickle companion will not go along with him. ||2||<br>
  Some love this wealth even more than their body and breath of life.<br>
  Some collect it, forsaking their fathers and mothers.<br>
  Some hide it from their children, friends and siblings, but it will not remain with them. ||3||<br>
  Some become hermits, and sit in meditative trances.<br>
  Some are Yogis, celibates, religious scholars and thinkers.<br>
  Some dwell in homes, graveyards, cremation grounds and forests; but Maya still clings to them there. ||4||<br>
  When the Lord and Master releases one from his bonds,<br>
  the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell in his soul.<br>

  Save your soul from the waters of corruption.<br>
  Your cries and shrieks shall be ended;<br>
  meditating on the Lord of the Universe, your doubts and fears shall be dispelled.<br>
  Rare is that being, who finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>

  The Lord's Name is the support of my mind and body.<br>
  Whoever meditates on Him is emancipated. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He believes that the false thing is true.<br>
  The ignorant fool falls in love with it.<br>
  He is intoxicated with the wine of sexual desire, anger and greed;<br>
  he loses this human life in exchance for a mere shell.<br>
  He abandons his own, and loves that of others.<br>
  His mind and body are permeated with the intoxication of Maya.<br>
  His thirsty desires are not quenched, although he indulges in pleasures.<br>
  His hopes are not fulfilled, and all his words are false.<br>
  He comes alone, and he goes alone.<br>

  False is all his talk of me and you.<br>
  The Lord Himself administers the poisonous potion, to mislead and delude.<br>
  O Nanak, the the karma of past actions cannot be erased. ||2||<br>
  Beasts, birds, demons and ghosts<br>
  - in these many ways, the false wander in reincarnation.<br>
  Wherever they go, they cannot remain there.<br>
  They have no place of rest; they rise up again and again and run around.<br>
  Their minds and bodies are filled with immense, expansive desires.<br>
  The poor wretches are cheated by egotism.<br>
  They are filled with countless sins, and are severely punished.<br>
  The extent of this cannot be estimated.<br>
  Forgetting God, they fall into hell.<br>
  There are no mothers there, no siblings, no friends and no spouses.<br>
  Those humble beings, unto whom the Lord and Master becomes Merciful,<br>
  O Nanak, cross over. ||3||<br>
  Rambling and roaming, wandering around, I came to seek the Sanctuary of God.<br>
  He is the Master of the meek, the father and mother of the world.<br>
  The Merciful Lord God is the Destroyer of sorrow and suffering.<br>
  He emancipates whoever He pleases.<br>
  He lifts them up and pulls him out of the deep dark pit.<br>
  Emancipation comes through loving devotional worship.<br>
  The Holy Saint is the very embodiment of the Lord's form.<br>
  He Himself saves us from the great fire.<br>

  In the beginning and in the end, God is inaccessible and unfathomable.<br>

  Why do you try to deceive others, O people of the world? The Fascinating Lord is Merciful to the meek. ||1||<br>
  This is what I have come to know.<br>

  He submits to the Will of His devotees; He is forever and ever the Giver of peace. ||2||<br>
  Please bless me with Your Mercy, that I may meditate on Your Name alone. ||3||<br>

  No one knows me; I am called Your slave.<br>
  This is my support and sustenance. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You support and cherish all; I am meek and humble - this is my only prayer.<br>
  You alone know Your Way; You are the water, and I am the fish. ||2||<br>

  They cannot even be described;<br>
  they are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  My Beloved is a priceless jewel.<br>
  His Name is unattainable and immeasurable. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One whose mind is satisfied believing in the imperishable Lord God,<br>
  becomes Gurmukh and attains the essence of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  He sees all in his meditation.<br>
  He banishes egotistical pride from his mind. ||2||<br>
  Permanent is the place of those<br>

  Abandon all your clever tricks; meet with the Holy, and renounce your egotistical pride.<br>
  Everything else is false; with your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, with your ears, listen to the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The sins of your many past lifetimes shall be washed away; then, what can the wretched Messenger of Death do to you? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Pain, poverty and fear shall not afflict you, and you shall find peace and pleasure.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, Nanak speaks; meditation on the Lord is the essence of spiritual wisdom. ||2||1||24||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord - I have seen them reduced to dust.<br>
  The love of children and friends, and the pleasures of married life are torn apart. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, continually, continuously chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  You shall not burn in the ocean of fire, and your mind and body shall be blessed with peace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Like the shade of a tree, these things shall pass away, like the clouds blown away by the wind.<br>
  Meeting with the Holy, devotional worship to the Lord is implanted within; O Nanak, only this shall work for you. ||2||2||25||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The perfect, primal Lord is the Giver of peace; He is always with you.<br>
  He does not die, and he does not come or go in reincarnation. He does not perish, and He is not affected by heat or cold. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, be in love with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Within the mind, think of the Lord, Har, Har, the treasure. This is the purest way of life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Whoever meditates on the merciful compassionate Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is successful.<br>
  He is always new, fresh and young, clever and beautiful; Nanak's mind is pierced through with His Love. ||2||3||26||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  While walking and sitting, sleeping and waking, contemplate within your heart the GurMantra.<br>
  Run to the Lord's lotus feet, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and reach the other side. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 019</h2></center>

  Soul, mind, body and breath of life belong to God; eliminate your self-conceit.<br>
  Meditate, vibrate on the Lord of the Universe, and all your desires shall be fulfilled; O Nanak, you shall never be defeated. ||2||4||27||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Renounce your self-conceit, and the fever shall depart; become the dust of the feet of the Holy.<br>
  He alone receives Your Name, Lord, whom You bless with Your Mercy. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Abandon other bland, insipid tastes; become immortal, and live throughout the ages. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Savor the essence of the One and only Naam; love the Naam, focus and attune yourself to the Naam.<br>
  Nanak has made the One Lord his only friend, companion and relative. ||2||5||28||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He nourishes and preserves mortals in the womb of the mother, so that the fiery heat does not hurt them.<br>
  That Lord and Master protects us here. Understand this in your mind. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, take the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Understand the One who created you; the One God is the Cause of causes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Remember the One Lord in your mind, renounce your clever tricks, and give up all your religious robes.<br>
  Meditating in remembrance forever on the Lord, Har, Har, O Nanak, countless beings have been saved. ||2||6||29||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  His Name is the Purifier of sinners; He is the Master of the masterless.<br>
  In the vast and terrifying world-ocean, he is the raft for those who have such destiny inscribed on their foreheads. ||1||<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, huge numbers of companions have drowned.<br>
  Even if someone does not remember the Lord, the Cause of causes, still, the Lord reaches out with His hand, and saves him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and take the Path of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.<br>
  Shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord; listening to Your sermon, Nanak lives. ||2||7||30||<br>
  Maaroo, Anjulee ~ With Hands Cupped In Prayer, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Union and separation are ordained by the Primal Lord God.<br>
  The puppet is made from the five elements.<br>
  By the Command of the Dear Lord King, the soul came and entered into the body. ||1||<br>
  In that place, where the fire rages like an oven,<br>
  in that darkness where the body lies face down<br>
  - there, one remembers his Lord and Master with each and every breath, and then he is rescued. ||2||<br>
  Then, one comes out from within the womb,<br>
  and forgetting his Lord and Master, he attaches his consciousness to the world.<br>
  He comes and goes, and wanders in reincarnation; he cannot remain anywhere. ||3||<br>
  The Merciful Lord Himself emancipates.<br>
  He created and established all beings and creatures.<br>
  Those who depart after having been victorious in this priceless human life - O Nanak, their coming into the world is approved. ||4||1||31||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 020</h2></center>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The One Lord alone is our help and support; neither physician nor friend, nor sister nor brother can be this. ||1||<br>
  His actions alone come to pass; He washes off the filth of sins. Meditate in remembrance on that Supreme Lord. ||2||<br>
  He abides in each and every heart, and dwells in all; His seat and place are eternal. ||3||<br>
  He does not come or go, and He is always with us. His actions are perfect. ||4||<br>
  He is the Savior and the Protector of His devotees.<br>
  The Saints live by meditating on God, the support of the breath of life.<br>
  The Almighty Lord and Master is the Cause of causes; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||5||2||32||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  The Name of the Lord is forever the Giver of peace.<br>
  Meditating in remembrance on it, Ajaamal was saved, and Ganika the prostitute was emancipated. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Dropadi the princess of Panchaala remembered the Lord's Name in the royal court.<br>
  The Lord, the embodiment of mercy, removed her suffering; thus His own glory was increased. ||1||<br>
  That man, who sings the Praise of the Lord, the treasure of mercy, has the help and support of the Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, I have come to rely on this. I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||1||<br>
  Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  What should I do now, O mother?<br>
  I have wasted my whole life in sin and corruption; I never remembered the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When Death places the noose around my neck, then I lose all my senses.<br>
  Now, in this disaster, other than the Name of the Lord, who will be my help and support? ||1||<br>
  That wealth, which he believes to be his own, in an instant, belongs to another.<br>
  Says Nanak, this still really bothers my mind - I never sang the Praises of the Lord. ||2||2||<br>
  Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O my mother, I have not renounced the pride of my mind.<br>
  I have wasted my life intoxicated with Maya; I have not focused myself in meditation on the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When Death's club falls on my head, then I will be wakened from my sleep.<br>
  But what good will it do to repent at that time? I cannot escape by running away. ||1||<br>
  When this anxiety arises in the heart, then, one comes to love the Guru's feet.<br>
  My life becomes fruitful, O Nanak, only when I am absorbed in the Praises of God. ||2||3||<br>
  Maaroo, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Reciting and listening to the Vedas and the Puraanas, countless wise men have grown weary.<br>
  So many in their various religious robes have grown weary, wandering to the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  The True Lord and Master is immaculate and pure. The mind is satisfied only by the One Lord. ||1||<br>
  You are eternal; You do not grow old. All others pass away.<br>
  One who lovingly focuses on the Naam, the source of nectar - his pains are taken away. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 021</h2></center>
  Study the Lord's Name, and understand the Lord's Name; follow the Guru's Teachings, and through the Naam, you shall be saved.<br>
  Perfect are the Teachings of the Perfect Guru; contemplate the Perfect Word of the Shabad.<br>
  The Lord's Name is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and the Eradicator of sins. ||2||<br>
  The blind ignorant mortal stirs the water and churns the water, wishing to obtain butter.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, one churns the cream, and the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam is obtained.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is a beast; he does not know the essence of reality that is contained within himself. ||3||<br>
  Dying in egotism and self-conceit, one dies, and dies again, only to be reincarnated over and over again.<br>
  But when he dies in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, then he does not die, ever again.<br>
  When he follows the Guru's Teachings, and enshrines the Lord, the Life of the World, within his mind, he redeems all his generations. ||4||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the true object, the true commodity.<br>
  The Naam is the only true profit in this world. Follow the Guru's Teachings, and contemplate it.<br>
  To work in the love of duality, brings constant loss in this world. ||5||<br>
  True is one's association, true is one's place, and true is one's hearth and home, when one has the support of the Naam.<br>
  Contemplating the True Word of the Guru's Bani, and the True Word of the Shabad, one becomes content. ||6||<br>
  Enjoying princely pleasures, one shall be destroyed in pain and pleasure.<br>
  Adopting a name of greatness, one strings heavy sins around his neck.<br>
  Mankind cannot give gifts; You alone are the Giver of everything. ||7||<br>
  You are inaccessible and unfathomable; O Lord, You are imperishable and infinite.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, seeking at the Lord's Door, one finds the treasure of liberation.<br>
  O Nanak, this union is not broken, if one deals in the merchandise of Truth. ||8||1||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  The boat is loaded with sin and corruption, and launched into the sea.<br>
  The shore cannot be seen on this side, nor on the shore beyond.<br>
  There are no oars, nor any boatmen, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, the world is caught in the great noose.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they are saved, contemplating the True Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The True Guru is the boat; the Word of the Shabad will carry them across.<br>
  There is neither wind nor fire, neither water nor form there.<br>
  The True Name of the True Lord is there; it carries them across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||<br>
  The Gurmukhs reach the shore beyond, lovingly focusing on the True Lord.<br>
  Their comings and goings are ended, and their light merges into the Light.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, intuitive peace wells up within them, and they remain merged in the True Lord. ||3||<br>
  The snake may be locked in a basket, but it is still poisonous, and the anger within its mind remains.<br>
  One obtains what is pre-ordained; why does he blame others?<br>
  If one, as Gurmukh, hears and believes in the Name, the charm against poison, his mind becomes content. ||4||<br>
  The crocodile is caught by the hook and line;<br>
  caught in the trap of evil-mindedness, he regrets and repents, again and again.<br>
  He does not understand birth and death; the inscription of one's past actions cannot be erased. ||5||<br>
  Injecting the poison of egotism, the world was created; with the Shabad enshrined within, the poison is eliminated.<br>
  Old age cannot torment one who remains lovingly absorbed in the True Lord.<br>
  He alone is called Jivan-Mikta, liberated while yet alive, from within whom egotism is eradicated. ||6||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 022</h2></center>
  The world is chasing after worldly affairs; caught and bound, it does not understand contemplative meditation.<br>
  The foolish, ignorant, self-willed manmukh has forgotten birth and death.<br>
  Those whom the Guru has protected are saved, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. ||7||<br>
  In the cage of divine love, the parrot, speaks.<br>
  It pecks at the Truth, and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar; it flies away, only once.<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, one recognizes his Lord and Master; says Nanak, he finds the gate of liberation. ||8||2||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  One who dies in the Word of the Shabad conquers death; otherwise, where can you run?<br>
  Through the Fear of God, fear runs away; His Name is Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  You alone kill and protect; except for You, there is no place at all. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, I am filthy, shallow and totally without understanding.<br>
  Without the Naam, no one is anything; the Perfect Guru has made my intellect perfect. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am full of faults, and I have no virtue at all. Without virtues, how can I go home?<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, intuitive peace wells up; without good destiny, the wealth is not obtained.<br>
  Those whose minds are not filled with the Naam are bound and gagged, and suffer in pain. ||2||<br>
  Those who have forgotten the Naam - why have they even come into the world?<br>
  Here and hereafter, they do not find any peace; they have loaded their carts with ashes.<br>
  Those who are separated, do not meet with the Lord; they suffer in terrible pain at Death's Door. ||3||<br>
  I do not know what will happen in the world hereafter; I am so confused - please teach me, Lord!<br>
  I am confused; I would fall at the feet of one who shows me the Way.<br>
  Without the Guru, there is no giver at all; His value cannot be described. ||4||<br>
  If I see my friend, then I will embrace Him; I have sent Him the letter of Truth.<br>
  His soul-bride stands waiting expectantly; as Gurmukh, I see Him with my eyes.<br>
  By the Pleasure of Your Will, You abide in my mind, and bless me with Your Glance of Grace. ||5||<br>
  One who is wandering hungry and thirsty - what can he give, and what can anyone ask from him?<br>
  I cannot conceive of any other, who can bless my mind and body with perfection.<br>
  The One who created me takes care of me; He Himself blesses me with glory. ||6||<br>
  In the body-village is my Lord and Master, whose body is ever-new, Innocent and child-like, incomparably playful.<br>
  He is neither a woman, nor a man, nor a bird; the True Lord is so wise and beautiful.<br>
  Whatever pleases Him, happens; You are the lamp, and You are the incense. ||7||<br>
  He hears the songs and tastes the flavors, but these flavors are useless and insipid, and bring only disease to the body.<br>
  One who loves the Truth and speaks the Truth, escapes from the sorrow of separation.<br>
  Nanak does not forget the Naam; whatever happens is by the Lord's Will. ||8||3||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  Practice Truth - other greed and attachments are useless.<br>
  The True Lord has fascinated this mind, and my tongue enjoys the taste of Truth.<br>
  Without the Name, there is no juice; the others depart, loaded with poison. ||1||<br>
  I am such a slave of Yours, O my Beloved Lord and Master.<br>
  I walk in harmony with Your Command, O my True, Sweet Beloved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Night and day, the slave works for his overlord.<br>
  I have sold my mind for the Word of the Guru's Shabad; my mind is comforted and consoled by the Shabad.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 023</h2></center>
  The Perfect Guru is honored and celebrated; He has taken away the pains of my mind. ||2||<br>
  I am the servant and slave of my Master; what glorious greatness of His can I describe?<br>
  The Perfect Master, by the Pleasure of His Will, forgives, and then one practices Truth.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who re-unites the separated ones. ||3||<br>
  The intellect of His servant and slave is noble and true; it is made so by the Guru's intellect.<br>
  The intuition of those who are true is beautiful; the intellect of the self-willed manmukh is insipid.<br>
  My mind and body belong to You, God; from the very beginning, Truth has been my only support. ||4||<br>
  In Truth I sit and stand; I eat and speak the Truth.<br>
  With Truth in my consciousness, I gather the wealth of Truth, and drink in the sublime essence of Truth.<br>
  In the home of Truth, the True Lord protects me; I speak the Words of the Guru's Teachings with love. ||5||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is very lazy; he is trapped in the wilderness.<br>
  He is drawn to the bait, and continually pecking at it, he is trapped; his link to the Lord is ruined.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one is liberated, absorbed in the primal trance of Truth. ||6||<br>
  His slave remains continually pierced through with love and affection for God.<br>
  Without the True Lord, the soul of the false, corrupt person is burnt to ashes.<br>
  Abandoning all evil actions, he crosses over in the boat of Truth. ||7||<br>
  Those who have forgotten the Naam have no home, no place of rest.<br>
  The Lord's slave renounces greed and attachment, and obtains the Lord's Name.<br>
  If You forgive him, Lord, then He is united with You; Nanak is a sacrifice. ||8||4||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  The Lord's slave renounces his egotistical pride, through the Guru's Fear, intuitively and easily.<br>
  The slave realizes his Lord and Master; glorious is his greatness!<br>
  Meeting with his Lord and Master, he finds peace; His value cannot be desribed. ||1||<br>
  I am the slave and servant of my Lord and Master; all glory is to my Master.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I am saved, in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The slave has been given the most excellent task, by the Primal Command of the Master.<br>
  The slave realizes the Hukam of His Command, and submits to His Will forever.<br>
  The Lord King Himself grants forgiveness; how glorious is His greatness! ||2||<br>
  He Himself is True, and everything is True; this is revealed through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  He alone serves You, whom You have enjoined to do so.<br>
  Without serving Him, no one finds Him; in duality and doubt, they are ruined. ||3||<br>
  How could we forget Him from our minds? The gifts which he bestows increase day by day.<br>
  Soul and body, all belong to Him; He infused the breath into us.<br>
  If he shows His Mercy, then we serve Him; serving Him, we merge in Truth. ||4||<br>
  He alone is the Lord's slave, who remains dead while yet alive, and eradicates egotism from within.<br>
  His bonds are broken, the fire of his desire is quenched, and he is liberated.<br>
  The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within all, but how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, obtain it. ||5||<br>
  Within the Lord's slave, there is no virtue at all; the Lord's slave is totally unworthy.<br>
  There is no Giver as great as You, Lord; You alone are the Forgiver.<br>
  Your slave obeys the Hukam of Your Command; this is the most excellent action. ||6||<br>
  The Guru is the pool of nectar in the world-ocean; whatever one desires, that fruit is obtained.<br>
  The treasure of the Naam brings immortality; enshrine it in your heart and mind.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 024</h2></center>
  Serving the Guru, eternal peace is obtained, by those whom the Lord inspires to obey the Hukam of His Command. ||7||<br>
  Gold and silver, and all metals, mix with dust in the end<br>
  Without the Name, nothing goes along with you; the True Guru has imparted this understanding.<br>
  O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are immaculate and pure; they remain merged in the Truth. ||8||5||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  The Order is issued, and he cannot remain; the permit to stay has been torn up.<br>
  This mind is tied to its faults; it suffers terrible pain in its body.<br>
  The Perfect Guru forgives all the mistakes of the beggar at His Door. ||1||<br>
  How can he stay here? He must get up and depart. Contemplate the Word of the Shabad, and understand this.<br>
  He alone is united, whom You, O Lord, unite. Such is the Primal Command of the Infinite Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  As You keep me, I remain; whatever You give me, I eat.<br>
  As You lead me, I follow, with the Ambrosial Name in my mouth.<br>
  All glorious greatness rests in the hands of my Lord and Master; my mind yearns to unite with You. ||2||<br>
  Why should anyone praise any other created being? That Lord acts and sees.<br>
  The One who created me, abides within my mind; there is no other at all.<br>
  So praise that True Lord, and you shall be blessed with true honor. ||3||<br>
  The Pandit, the religious scholar, reads, but does not reach the Lord; he is totally entangled in worldly affairs.<br>
  He keeps the company of both virtue and vice, tormented by hunger and the Messenger of Death.<br>
  One who is protected by the Perfect Lord, forgets separation and fear. ||4||<br>
  They alone are perfect, O Siblings of Destiny, whose honor is certified.<br>
  Perfect is the intellect of the Perfect Lord. True is His glorious greatness.<br>
  His gifts never run short, although those who receive may grow weary of receiving. ||5||<br>
  Searching the salty sea, one finds the pearl.<br>
  It looks beautiful for a few days, but in the end, it is eaten away by dust.<br>
  If one serves the Guru, the ocean of Truth, the gifts one receives never run short. ||6||<br>
  They alone are pure, who are pleasing to my God; all others are soiled with filth.<br>
  The filthy become pure, when they meet with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone.<br>
  Who can estimate the value of the color of the true jewel? ||7||<br>
  Wearing religious robes, the Lord is not obtained, nor is He obtained by giving donations at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  Go and ask the readers of the Vedas; without faith, the world is cheated.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone values the jewel, who is blessed with the spiritual wisdom of the Perfect Guru. ||8||6||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The self-willed manmukh, in a fit of passion, abandons his home, and is ruined; then, he spies on the homes of others.<br>
  He neglects his household duties, and does not meet with the True Guru; he is caught in the whirlpool of evil-mindedness.<br>
  Wandering in foreign lands and reading scriptures, he grows weary, and his thirsty desires only increase.<br>
  His perishable body does not remember the Word of the Shabad; like a beast, he fills his belly. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, this is the way of life of the Sannyaasi, the renunciate.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is to enshrine love for the One Lord. Imbued with Your Name, Lord, he remains satisfied and fulfilled. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He dyes his robes with saffron dye, and wearing these robes, he goes out begging.<br>
  Tearing his robes, he makes a patched coat, and puts the money in his wallet.<br>
  From house to house he goes begging, and tries to teach the world; but his mind is blind, and so he loses his honor.<br>
  He is deluded by doubt, and does not remember the Word of the Shabad. He loses his life in the gamble. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 025</h2></center>
  Without the Guru, the fire within is not quenched; and outside, the fire still burns.<br>
  Without serving the Guru, there is no devotional worship. How can anyone, by himself, know the Lord?<br>
  Slandering others, one lives in hell; within him is hazy darkness.<br>
  Wandering to the eixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, he is ruined. How can the filth of sin be washed away? ||3||<br>
  He sifts through the dust, and applies ashes to his body, but he is searching for the path of Maya's wealth.<br>
  Inwardly and outwardly, he does not know the One Lord; if someone tells him the Truth, he grows angry.<br>
  He reads the scriptures, but tells lies; such is the intellect of one who has no guru.<br>
  Without chanting the Naam, how can he find peace? Without the Name, how can he look good? ||4||<br>
  Some shave their heads, some keep their hair in matted tangles; some keep it in braids, while some keep silent, filled with egotistical pride.<br>
  Their minds waver and wander in ten directions, without loving devotion and enlightenment of the soul.<br>
  They abandon the Ambrosial Nectar, and drink the deadly poison, driven mad by Maya.<br>
  Past actions cannot be erased; without understanding the Hukam of the Lord's Command, they become beasts. ||5||<br>
  With bowl in hand, wearing his patched coat, great desires well up in his mind.<br>
  Abandoning his own wife, he is engrossed in sexual desire; his thoughts are on the wives of others.<br>
  He teaches and preaches, but does not contemplate the Shabad; he is bought and sold on the street.<br>
  With poison within, he pretends to be free of doubt; he is ruined and humiliated by the Messenger of Death. ||6||<br>
  He alone is a Sannyaasi, who serves the True Guru, and removes his self-conceit from within.<br>
  He does not ask for clothes or food; without asking, he accepts whatever he receives.<br>
  He does not speak empty words; he gathers in the wealth of tolerance, and burns away his anger with the Naam.<br>
  Blessed is such a householder, Sannyaasi and Yogi, who focuses his consciousness on the Lord's feet. ||7||<br>
  Amidst hope, the Sannyaasi remains unmoved by hope; he remains lovingly focused on the One Lord.<br>
  He drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord, and so finds peace and tranquility; in the home of his own being, he remains absorbed in the deep trance of meditation.<br>
  His mind does not waver; as Gurmukh, he understands. He restrains it from wandering out.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, he searches the home of his body, and obtains the wealth of the Naam. ||8||<br>
  Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are exalted, imbued with contemplative meditation on the Naam.<br>
  The sources of creation, speech, the heavens and the underworld, all beings and creatures, are infused with Your Light.<br>
  All comforts and liberation are found in the Naam, and the vibrations of the Guru's Bani; I have enshrined the True Name within my heart.<br>
  Without the Naam, no one is saved; O Nanak, with the Truth, cross over to the other side. ||9||7||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  Through the union of mother and father, the fetus is formed. The egg and sperm join together to make the body.<br>
  Upside-down within the womb, it lovingly dwells on the Lord; God provides for it, and gives it nourishment there. ||1||<br>
  How can he cross over the terrifying world-ocean?<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unbearable load of sins is removed. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have forgotten Your Virtues, Lord; I am insane - what can I do now?<br>
  You are the Merciful Giver, above the heads of all. Day and night, You give gifts, and take care of all. ||2||<br>
  One is born to achieve the four great objectives of life. The spirit has taken up its home in the material world.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 026</h2></center>
  Driven by hunger, it sees the path of Maya's riches; this emotional attachment takes away the treasure of liberation. ||3||<br>
  Weeping and wailing, he does not receive them; he searches here and there, and grows weary.<br>
  Engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism, he falls in love with his false relatives. ||4||<br>
  He eats and enjoys, listens and watches, and dresses up to show off in this house of death.<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he does not undersand himself. Without the Lord's Name, death cannot be avoided. ||5||<br>
  The more attachment and egotism delude and confuse him, the more he cries out, "Mine, mine!", and the more he loses out.<br>
  His body and wealth pass away, and he is torn by skepticism and cynicism; in the end, he regrets and repents, when the dust falls on his face. ||6||<br>
  He grows old, his body and youth waste away, and his throat is plugged with mucous; water flows from his eyes.<br>
  He feet fail him, and his hands shake and tremble; the faithless cynic does not enshrine the Lord in his heart. ||7||<br>
  His intellect fails him, his black hair turns white, and no one wants to keep him in their home.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, these are the stigmas which stick to him; the Messenger of Death beats him, and drags him to hell. ||8||<br>
  The record of one's past actions cannot be erased; who else is to blame for one's birth and death?<br>
  Without the Guru, life and death are pointless; without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, life just burns away. ||9||<br>
  The pleasures enjoyed in happiness bring ruin; acting in corruption is useless indulgence.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, and caught by greed, he betrays his own source; the club of the Righteous Judge of Dharma will strike him over the head. ||10||<br>
  The Gurmukhs sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name; the Lord God blesses them with His Glance of Grace.<br>
  Those beings are pure, perfect unlimited and infinite; in this world, they are the embodiment of the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. ||11||<br>
  Meditate in remembrance on the Lord; meditate and contemplate the Guru's Word, and love to associate with the humble servants of the Lord.<br>
  The Lord's humble servants are the embodiment of the Guru; they are supreme and respected in the Court of the Lord. Nanak seeks the dust of the feet of those humble servants of the Lord. ||12||8||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Maaroo, Kaafee, First Mehl, Second House:<br>
  The double-minded person comes and goes, and has numerous friends.<br>
  The soul-bride is separated from her Lord, and she has no place of rest; how can she be comforted? ||1||<br>
  My mind is attuned to the Love of my Husband Lord.<br>
  I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to the Lord; if only He would bless me with His Glance of Grace, even for an instant! ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am a rejected bride, abandoned in my parents' home; how can I go to my in-laws now?<br>
  I wear my faults around my neck; without my Husband Lord, I am grieving, and wasting away to death. ||2||<br>
  But if, in my parents' home, I remember my Husband Lord, then I will come to dwell in the home of my in-laws yet.<br>
  The happy soul-brides sleep in peace; they find their Husband Lord, the treasure of virtue. ||3||<br>
  Their blankets and mattresses are made of silk, and so are the clothes on their bodies.<br>
  The Lord rejects the impure soul-brides. Their life-night passes in misery. ||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 027</h2></center>
  I have tasted many flavors, and worn many robes,<br>
  but without my Husband Lord, my youth is slipping away uselessly; I am separated from Him, and I cry out in pain. ||5||<br>
  I have heard the True Lord's message, contemplating the Guru.<br>
  True is the home of the True Lord; by His Gracious Grace, I love Him. ||6||<br>
  The spiritual teacher applies the ointment of Truth to his eyes, and sees God, the Seer.<br>
  The Gurmukh comes to know and understand; ego and pride are subdued. ||7||<br>
  O Lord, You are pleased with those who are like Yourself; there are many more like me.<br>
  O Nanak, the Husband does not separate from those who are imbued with Truth. ||8||1||9||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  Neither the sisters, nor the sisters-in-law, nor the mothers-in-law, shall remain.<br>
  The true relationship with the Lord cannot be broken; it was established by the Lord, O sister soul-brides. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to Him.<br>
  Wandering so far without the Guru, I grew weary; now, the Guru has united me in Union with my Husband Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Aunts, uncles, grandparents and sisters-in-law<br>
  - they all come and go; they cannot remain. They are like boatloads of passengers embarking. ||2||<br>
  Uncles, aunts, and cousins of all sorts, cannot remain.<br>
  The caravans are full, and great crowds of them are loading up at the riverbank. ||3||<br>
  O sister-friends, my Husband Lord is dyed in the color of Truth.<br>
  She who lovingly remembers her True Husband Lord is not separated from Him again. ||4||<br>
  All the seasons are good, in which the soul-bride falls in love with the True Lord.<br>
  That soul-bride, who knows her Husband Lord, sleeps in peace, night and day. ||5||<br>
  At the ferry, the ferryman announces, "O travellers, hurry up and cross over."<br>
  I have seen them crossing over there, on the boat of the True Guru. ||6||<br>
  Some are getting on board, and some have already set out; some are weighed down with their loads.<br>
  Those who deal in Truth, remain with their True Lord God. ||7||<br>
  I am not called good, and I see none who are bad.<br>
  O Nanak, one who conquers and subdues his ego, becomes just like the True Lord. ||8||2||10||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  I do not believe that anyone is foolish; I do not believe that anyone is clever.<br>
  Imbued forever with the Love of my Lord and Master, I chant His Name, night and day. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, I am so foolish, but I am a sacrifice to the Name.<br>
  You are the Creator, You are wise and all-seeing. Through Your Name, we are carried across. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The same person is foolish and wise; the same light within has two names.<br>
  The most foolish of the foolish are those who do not believe in the Name. ||2||<br>
  Through the Guru's Gate, the Gurdwara, the Name is obtained. Without the True Guru, it is not received.<br>
  Through the Pleasure of the True Guru's Will, the Name comes to dwell in the mind, and then, night and day, one remains lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||3||<br>
  In power, pleasures, beauty, wealth and youth, one gambles his life away.<br>
  Bound by the Hukam of God's Command, the dice are thrown; he is just a piece in the game of chess. ||4||<br>
  The world is clever and wise, but it is deluded by doubt, and forgets the Name; the Pandit, the religious scholar, studies the scriptures, but he is still a fool.<br>
  Forgetting the Name, he dwells upon the Vedas; he writes, but he is confused by his poisonous corruption. ||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 028</h2></center>
  He is like the crop planted in the salty soil, or the tree growing on the river bank, or the white clothes sprinkled with dirt.<br>
  This world is the house of desire; whoever enters it, is burnt down by egotistical pride. ||6||<br>
  Where are all the kings and their subjects? Those who are immersed in duality are destroyed.<br>
  Says Nanak, these are the steps of the ladder, of the Teachings of the True Guru; only the Unseen Lord shall remain. ||7||3||11||<br>
  Maaroo, Third Mehl, Fifth House, Ashtapadees:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  One whose mind is filled with the Lord's Love,<br>
  is intuitively exalted by the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  He alone knows the pain of this love; what does anyone else know about its cure? ||1||<br>
  He Himself unites in His Union.<br>
  He Himself inspires us with His Love.<br>
  He alone appreciates the value of Your Love, upon whom You shower Your Grace, O Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One whose spiritual vision is awakened - his doubt is driven out.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, he obtains the supreme status.<br>
  He alone is a Yogi, who understands this way, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<br>
  By good destiny, the soul-bride is united with her Husband Lord.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, she eradicates her evil-mindedness from within.<br>
  With love, she continually enjoys pleasure with Him; she becomes the beloved of her Husband Lord. ||3||<br>
  Other than the True Guru, there is no physician.<br>
  He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, evil is conquered, and spiritual wisdom is contemplated. ||4||<br>
  One who is committed to this most sublime Shabad<br>
  becomes Gurmukh, and is rid of thirst and hunger.<br>
  By one's own efforts, nothing can be accomplished; the Lord, in His Mercy, bestows power. ||5||<br>
  The True Guru has revealed the essence of the Shaastras and the Vedas.<br>
  In His Mercy, He has come into the home of my self.<br>
  In the midst of Maya, the Immaculate Lord is known, by those upon whom You bestow Your Grace. ||6||<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh, obtains the essence of reality;<br>
  he eradictes his self-conceit from within.<br>
  Without the True Guru, all are entangled in worldly affairs; consider this in your mind, and see. ||7||<br>
  Some are deluded by doubt; they strut around egotistically.<br>
  Some, as Gurmukh, subdue their egotism.<br>
  Attuned to the True Word of the Shabad, they remain detached from the world. The other ignorant fools wander, confused and deluded by doubt. ||8||<br>
  Those who have not become Gurmukh, and who have not found the Naam, the Name of the Lord<br>
  - those self-willed manmukhs waste their lives uselessly.<br>
  In the world hereafter, nothing except the Name will be of any assistance; this is understood by contemplating the Guru. ||9||<br>
  The Ambrosial Naam is the Giver of peace forever.<br>
  Throughout the four ages, it is known through the Perfect Guru.<br>
  He alone receives it, unto whom You bestow it; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has realized. ||10||1||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Wandering and roaming through 8.4 million incarnations, you have now been given this human life, so difficult to obtain. ||1||<br>
  You fool! You are attached and clinging to such trivial pleasures!<br>
  The Ambrosial Nectar abides with you, but you are engrossed in sin and corruption. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You have come to trade in gems and jewels, but you have loaded only barren soil. ||2||<br>
  That home within which you live - you have not kept that home in your thoughts. ||3||<br>
  He is immovable, indestructible, the Giver of peace to the soul; and yet you do not sing His Praises, even for an instant. ||4||<br>
  You have forgotten that place where you must go; you have not attached your mind to the Lord, even for an instant. ||5||<br>
  Gazing upon your children, spouse, household and paraphernalia, you are entangled in them. ||6||<br>
  As God links the mortals, so are they linked, and so are the deeds they do. ||7||<br>
  When He becomes Merciful, then the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is found; servant Nanak meditates on God. ||8||1||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Granting His Grace, He has protected me; I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  My tongue lovingly chants the Lord's Name; this love is so sweet and intense! ||1||<br>
  He is the place of rest for my mind,<br>
  my friend, companion, associate and relative; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He created the world-ocean; I seek the Sanctuary of that God.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I worship and adore God; the Messenger of Death can't say anything to me. ||2||<br>
  Emancipation and liberation are at His Door; He is the treasure in the hearts of the Saints.<br>
  The all-knowing Lord and Master shows us the true way of life; He is our Savior and Protector forever. ||3||<br>
  Pain, suffering and troubles are eradicated, when the Lord abides in the mind.<br>
  Death, hell and the most horrible dwelling of sin and corruption cannot even touch such a person. ||4||<br>
  Wealth, miraculous spiritual powers and the nine treasures come from the Lord, as do the streams of Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, He is perfect, lofty, unapproachable and unfathomable. ||5||<br>
  The Siddhas, seekers, angelic beings, silent sages, and the Vedas speak of Him.<br>
  Meditating in remembrance on the Lord and Master, celestial peace is enjoyed; He has no end or limitation. ||6||<br>
  Countless sins are erased in an instant, meditating on the Benevolent Lord within the heart.<br>
  Such a person becomes the purest of the pure, and is blessed with the merits of millions of donations to charity and cleansing baths. ||7||<br>
  God is power, intellect, understanding, the breath of life, wealth, and everything for the Saints.<br>
  May I never forget Him from my mind, even for an instant - this is Nanak's prayer. ||8||2||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The sharp tool cuts down the tree, but it does not feel anger in its mind.<br>
  It serves the purpose of the cutter, and does not blame him at all. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, continually, continuously, meditate on the Lord.<br>
  The Lord of the Universe is merciful, divine and compassionate. Listen - this is the way of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<br>

  He plants his feet in the boat, and then sits down in it; the fatigue of his body is relieved.<br>
  The great ocean does not even affect him; in an instant, he arrives on the other shore. ||2||<br>
  Sandalwood, aloe, and camphor-paste - the earth does not love them.<br>
  But it doesn't mind, if someone digs it up bit by bit, and applies manure and urine to it. ||3||<br>
  High and low, bad and good - the comforting canopy of the sky stretches evenly over all.<br>
  It knows nothing of friend and enemy; all beings are alike to it. ||4||<br>
  Blazing with its dazzling light, the sun rises, and dispels the darkness.<br>
  Touching both the pure and the impure, it harbors no hatred to any. ||5||<br>
  The cool and fragrant wind gently blows upon all places alike.<br>
  Wherever anything is, it touches it there, and does not hesitate a bit. ||6||<br>
  Good or bad, whoever comes close to the fire - his cold is taken away.<br>
  It knows nothing of its own or others'; it is constant in the same quality. ||7||<br>
  Whoever seeks the Sancuary of the feet of the Sublime Lord - his mind is attuned to the Love of the Beloved.<br>
  Constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World, O Nanak, God becomes merciful to us. ||8||3||<br>

  Renunciation, renunciation - noble is the renunciation of sexual desire, anger and greed. ||3||<br>
  Begging, begging - it is noble to beg for the Lord's Praise from the Guru. ||4||<br>
  Vigils, vigils - sublime is the vigil spent singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||5||<br>
  Attachment, attachment - sublime is the attachment of the mind to the Guru's Feet. ||6||<br>

  By the Grace of the Saint, the Lord dwells within the heart, and the love of duality is eradicated. ||2||<br>
  By the kindness of the devotee, the intellect is enlightened, and pain and evil-mindedness are eradicated. ||3||<br>
  Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, one is sanctified, and is no longer consigned to the womb of reincarnation. ||4||<br>
  The nine treasures, wealth and miraculous spiritual powers are obtained, by one who is pleasing to Your mind. ||5||<br>
  Without the Saint, I have no place of rest at all; I cannot think of any other place to go. ||6||<br>
  I am unworthy; no one gives me sanctuary. But in the Society of the Saints, I merge in God. ||7||<br>

  The real food is that which will never leave you hungry again; it will leave you contented and satisfied forever. ||2||<br>
  The real clothes are those which protect your honor before the Transcendent Lord, and do not leave you naked ever again. ||3||<br>

  Sew devotional worship to the Lord into the mind, without any needle or thread. ||5||<br>
  Imbued and intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord, this experience will never wear off again. ||6||<br>

  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Eighth House, Anjulees ~ With Hands Cupped In Prayer:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The household which is filled with abundance - that household suffers anxiety.<br>
  One whose household has little, wanders around searching for more.<br>
  He alone is happy and at peace, who is liberated from both conditions. ||1||<br>
  Householders and kings fall into hell, along with renunciates and angry men,<br>
  and all those who study and recite the Vedas in so many ways.<br>
  Perfect is the work of that humble servant, who remains unattached while in the body. ||2||<br>
  The mortal sleeps, even while he is awake; he is being plundered by doubt.<br>
  Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained, friend.<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the bonds of egotism are released, and one comes to behold the One and only Lord. ||3||<br>
  Doing deeds, one is placed in bondage; but if he does not act, he is slandered.<br>
  Intoxicated with emotional attachment, the mind is afflicted with anxiety.<br>
  One who looks alike upon pleasure and pain, by Guru's Grace, sees the Lord in each and every heart. ||4||<br>
  Within the world, one is afflicted by skepticism;<br>
  he does not know the imperceptible Unspoken Speech of the Lord.<br>
  He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. The Lord cherishes him as His child. ||5||<br>
  He may try to abandon Maya, but he is not released.<br>
  If he collects things, then his mind is afraid of losing them.<br>
  I wave the fly-brush over that holy person, whose honor is protected in the midst of Maya. ||6||<br>
  He alone is a warrior hero, who remains dead to the world.<br>
  One who runs away will wander in reincarnation.<br>
  Whatever happens, accept that as good. Realize the Hukam of His Command, and your evil-mindedness will be burnt away. ||7||<br>
  Whatever He links us to, to that we are linked.<br>

  You shall suffer terrible punishment, on your way to the land beyond.<br>
  The mortal does not know the One who created him; he is blind, and so he shall suffer. ||5||<br>
  Forgetting the Creator Lord, he is ruined.<br>
  The drama of the world is bad; it brings sadness and then happiness.<br>
  One who does not meet the Saint does not have faith or contentment; he wanders just as he pleases. ||6||<br>
  The Lord Himself stages all this drama. Some, he lifts up, and some he throws into the waves.<br>
  As He makes them dance, so do they dance. Everyone lives their lives according to their past actions. ||7||<br>

  All that is seen, is coming and going.<br>
  They are the true bankers and traders, whom the True Guru has inspired to understand. ||13||<br>
  The Word of the Shabad is understood through the Perfect True Guru.<br>
  The True Lord is overflowing with all powers.<br>
  You are beyond our grasp, and forever independent. You do not have even an iota of greed. ||14||<br>
  Birth and death are meaningless, for those<br>
  who enjoy the sublime celestial essence of the Shabad within their minds.<br>
  He Himself is the Giver of liberation, satisfaction and blessings, to those devotees who love Him in their minds. ||15||<br>
  He Himself is immaculate; by contact with the Guru, spiritual wisdom is obtained.<br>
  Whatever is seen, shall merge into You.<br>
  Nanak, the lowly, begs for charity at Your Door; please, bless him with the glorious greatness of Your Name. ||16||1||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  He Himself is the earth, the mythical bull which supports it and the Akaashic ethers.<br>
  The True Lord Himself reveals His Glorious Virtues.<br>
  He Himself is celibate, chaste and contented; He Himself is the Doer of deeds. ||1||<br>
  He who created the creation, beholds what He has created.<br>
  No one can erase the Inscription of the True Lord.<br>
  He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of causes; He Himself is the One who bestows glorious greatness. ||2||<br>
  The five thieves cause the fickle consciousness to waver.<br>
  It looks into the homes of others, but does not search its own home.<br>
  The body-village crumbles into dust; without the Word of the Shabad, one's honor is lost. ||3||<br>
  One who realizes the Lord through the Guru, comprehends the three worlds.<br>
  He subdues his desires, and struggles with his mind.<br>
  Those who serve You, become just like You; O Fearless Lord, You are their best friend from infancy. ||4||<br>
  You Yourself are the heavenly realms, this world and the nether regions of the underworld.<br>
  You Yourself are the embodiment of light, forever young.<br>
  With matted hair, and a horrible, dreadful form, still, You have no form or feature. ||5||<br>
  The Vedas and the Bible do not know the mystery of God.<br>
  He has no mother, father, child or brother.<br>
  He created all the mountains, and levels them again; the Unseen Lord cannot be seen. ||6||<br>
  I have grown weary of making so many friends.<br>
  No one can rid me of my sins and mistakes.<br>
  God is the Supreme Lord and Master of all the angels and mortal beings; blessed with His Love, their fear is dispelled. ||7||<br>
  He puts back on the Path those who have wandered and strayed.<br>
  You Yourself make them stray, and You teach them again.<br>
  I cannot see anything except the Name. Through the Name comes salvation and merit. ||8||<br>

  Ganga Saagar where the Ganges empties into the ocean, Trivaynee where the three rivers come together, and the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, are all merged in the Lord's Being. ||9||<br>
  He Himself is the Siddha, the seeker, in meditative contemplation.<br>
  He Himself is the King and the Council.<br>
  God Himself, the wise Judge, sits on the throne; He takes away doubt, duality and fear. ||10||<br>
  He Himself is the Qazi; He Himself is the Mullah.<br>
  He Himself is infallible; He never makes mistakes.<br>
  He Himself is the Giver of Grace, compassion and honor; He is no one's enemy. ||11||<br>
  Whoever He forgives, He blesses with glorious greatness.<br>
  He is the Giver of all; He does not have even an iota of greed.<br>
  The Immaculate Lord is all pervading, permeating everywhere, both hidden and manifest. ||12||<br>
  How can I praise the inaccessible, infinite Lord?<br>
  The True Creator Lord is the Enemy of ego.<br>
  He unites those whom He blesses with His Grace; uniting them in His Union, they are united. ||13||<br>
  Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva stand at His Door;<br>
  they serve the unseen, infinite Lord.<br>
  Millions of others can be seen crying at His door; I cannot even estimate their numbers. ||14||<br>
  True is the Kirtan of His Praise, and True is the Word of His Bani.<br>
  I can see no other in the Vedas and the Puraanas.<br>
  Truth is my capital; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. I have no other support at all. ||15||<br>
  In each and every age, the True Lord is, and shall always be.<br>
  Who has not died? Who shall not die?<br>
  Nanak the lowly offers this prayer; see Him within your own self, and lovingly focus on the Lord. ||16||2||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  In duality and evil-mindedness, the soul-bride is blind and deaf.<br>
  She wears the dress of sexual desire and anger.<br>
  Her Husband Lord is within the home of her own heart, but she does not know Him; without her Husband Lord, she cannot go to sleep. ||1||<br>
  The great fire of desire blazes within her.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh looks around in the four directions.<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, how can she find peace? Glorious greatness rests in the hands of the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  Eradicating sexual desire, anger and egotism,<br>
  she destroys the five thieves through the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Taking up the sword of spiritual wisdom, she struggles with her mind, and hope and desire are smoothed over in her mind. ||3||<br>
  From the union of the mother's egg and the father's sperm,<br>
  the form of infinite beauty has been created.<br>
  The blessings of light all come from You; You are the Creator Lord, pervading everywhere. ||4||<br>
  You have created birth and death.<br>
  Why should anyone fear, if they come to understand through the Guru?<br>
  When You, O Merciful Lord, look with Your kindness, then pain and suffering leave the body. ||5||<br>
  One who sits in the home of his own self, eats his own fears.<br>
  He quiets and holds his wandering mind still.<br>
  His heart-lotus blossoms forth in the overflowing green pool, and the Lord of his soul becomes his companion and helper. ||6||<br>
  With their death already ordained, mortals come into this world.<br>
  How can they remain here? They have to go to the world beyond.<br>
  True is the Lord's Command; the true ones dwell in the eternal city. The True Lord blesses them with glorious greatness. ||7||<br>
  He Himself created the whole world.<br>
  The One who made it, assigns the tasks to it.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 035</h2></center>
  I cannot see any other above the True Lord. The True Lord does the appraisal. ||8||<br>
  In this green pasture, the mortal stays only a few days.<br>
  He plays and frolics in utter darkness.<br>
  The jugglers have staged their show, and left, like people mumbling in a dream. ||9||<br>
  They alone are blessed with glorious greatness at the Lord's throne,<br>
  who enshrine the fearless Lord in their minds, and lovingly center themselves on Him.<br>
  In the galaxies and solar systems, nether regions, celestial realms and the three worlds, the Lord is in the primal void of deep absorption. ||10||<br>
  True is the village, and true is the throne,<br>
  of those Gurmukhs who meet with the True Lord, and find peace.<br>
  In Truth, seated upon the true throne, they are blessed with glorious greatness; their egotism is eradicated, along with the calculation of their account. ||11||<br>
  Calculating its account, the soul becomes anxious.<br>
  How can one find peace, through duality and the three gunas - the three qualities?<br>
  The One Lord is immaculate and formless, the Great Giver; through the Perfect Guru, honor is obtained. ||12||<br>
  In each and every age, very rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize the Lord.<br>
  Their minds are imbued with the True, all-pervading Lord.<br>
  Seeking His Shelter, they find peace, and their minds and bodies are not stained with filth. ||13||<br>
  Their tongues are imbued with the True Lord, the source of nectar;<br>
  abiding with the Lord God, they have no fear or doubt.<br>
  Hearing the Word of the Guru's Bani, their ears are satisfied, and their light merges into the Light. ||14||<br>
  Carefully, carefully, I place my feet upon the ground.<br>
  Wherever I go, I behold Your Sanctuary.<br>
  Whether You grant me pain or pleasure, You are pleasing to my mind. I am in harmony with You. ||15||<br>
  No one is anyone's companion or helper at the very last moment;<br>
  as Gurmukh, I realize You and praise You.<br>
  O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, I am detached; in the home of my own self deep within, I am absorbed in the primal void of deep meditation. ||16||3||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You are infinite and incomparable.<br>
  You are my primal, immaculate Lord and Master.<br>
  I contemplate the Way of Yoga, the Way of Union with the True Lord. I am truly absorbed in the primal void of deep meditation. ||1||<br>
  For so many ages, there was only pitch darkness;<br>
  the Creator Lord was absorbed in the primal void.<br>
  There was the True Name, the glorious greatness of the Truth, and the glory of His true throne. ||2||<br>
  In the Golden Age of Truth, Truth and contentment filled the bodies.<br>
  Truth was pervasive, Truth, deep, profound and unfathomable.<br>
  The True Lord appraises the mortals on the Touchstone of Truth, and issues His True Command. ||3||<br>
  The Perfect True Guru is true and contented.<br>
  He alone is a spiritual hero, who believes in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  He alone obtains a true seat in the True Court of the Lord, who surrenders to the Command of the Commander. ||4||<br>
  In the Golden Age of Truth, everyone spoke the Truth.<br>
  Truth was pervasive - the Lord was Truth.<br>
  With Truth in their minds and mouths, mortals were rid of doubt and fear. Truth was the friend of the Gurmukhs. ||5||<br>
  In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yoga, one power of Dharma was lost.<br>
  Three feet remained; through duality, one was cut off.<br>
  Those who were Gurmukh spoke the Truth, while the self-willed manmukhs wasted away in vain. ||6||<br>
  The manmukh never succeeds in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Without the Word of the Shabad, how can one be pleased within?<br>
  In bondage they come, and in bondage they go; they understand and comprehend nothing. ||7||<br>
  In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, compassion was cut in half.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 036</h2></center>
  Only a few, as Gurmukh, remembered the Lord.<br>
  Dharmic faith, which upholds and supports the earth, had only two feet; Truth was revealed to the Gurmukhs. ||8||<br>
  The kings acted righteously only out of self-interest.<br>
  Tied to hopes of reward, they gave to charities.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, liberation did not come, although they grew weary of performing rituals. ||9||<br>
  Practicing religious rituals, they sought liberation,<br>
  but the treasure of liberation comes only by praising the Shabad.<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, liberation is not obtained; practicing hypocrisy, they wander around confused. ||10||<br>
  Love and attachment to Maya cannot be abandoned.<br>
  They alone find release, who practice deeds of Truth.<br>
  Day and night, the devotees remain imbued with contemplative meditation; they become just like their Lord and Master. ||11||<br>
  Some chant and practice intensive meditation, and take cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  They walk as You will them to walk.<br>
  By stubborn rituals of self-suppression, the Lord is not pleased. No one has ever obtained honor, without the Lord, without the Guru. ||12||<br>
  In the Iron Age, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only one power remains.<br>
  Without the Perfect Guru, no one has even described it.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs have staged the show of falsehood. Without the True Guru, doubt does not depart. ||13||<br>
  The True Guru is the Creator Lord, independent and carefree.<br>
  He does not fear death, and He is not dependent on mortal men.<br>
  Whoever serves Him becomes immortal and imperishable, and will not be tortured by death. ||14||<br>
  The Creator Lord has enshrined Himself within the Guru.<br>
  The Gurmukh saves countless millions.<br>
  The Life of the World is the Great Giver of all beings. The Fearless Lord has no filth at all. ||15||<br>
  Everyone begs from the Guru, God's Treasurer.<br>
  He Himself is the immaculate, unknowable, infinite Lord.<br>
  Nanak speaks the Truth; he begs from God. Please bless me with the Truth, by Your Will. ||16||4||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  The True Lord unites with those who are united with the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  When it pleases Him, we intuitively merge with Him.<br>
  The Light of the Transcendent Lord pervades the three worlds; there is no other at all, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||<br>
  I am His servant; I serve Him.<br>
  He is unknowable and mysterious; He is pleased by the Shabad.<br>
  The Creator is the Benefactor of His devotees. He forgives them - such is His greatness. ||2||<br>
  The True Lord gives and gives; His blessings never run short.<br>
  The false ones receive, and then deny having received.<br>
  They do not understand their origins, they are not pleased with the Truth, and so they wander in duality and doubt. ||3||<br>
  The Gurmukhs remain awake and aware, day and night.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, they know the Love of the True Lord.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs remain asleep, and are plundered. The Gurmukhs remain safe and sound, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||<br>
  The false come, and the false go;<br>
  imbued with falsehood, they practice only falsehood.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the Shabad are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord; the Gurmukhs focus their consciousness on Him. ||5||<br>
  The false are cheated, and robbed by the robbers.<br>
  The garden is laid waste, like the rough wilderness.<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing tastes sweet; forgetting the Lord, they suffer in sorrow. ||6||<br>
  Receiving the food of Truth, one is satisfied.<br>
  True is the glorious greatness of the jewel of the Name.<br>
  One who understands his own self, realizes the Lord. His light merges into the Light. ||7||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 037</h2></center>
  Wandering from the Name, he endures beatings.<br>
  Even great cleverness does not dispel doubt.<br>
  The unconscious fool does not remain conscious of the Lord; he putrifies and rots away to death, carrying his heavy load of sin. ||8||<br>
  No one is free of conflict and strife.<br>
  Show me anyone who is, and I will praise him.<br>
  Dedicating mind and body to God, one meets the Lord, the Life of the World, and becomes just like Him. ||9||<br>
  No one knows the state and extent of God.<br>
  Whoever calls himself great, will be eaten by his greatness.<br>
  There is no lack of gifts of our True Lord and Master. He created all. ||10||<br>
  Great is the glorious greatness of the independent Lord.<br>
  He Himself created, and gives sustanance to all.<br>
  The Merciful Lord is not far away; the Great Giver spontaneously unites with Himself, by His Will. ||11||<br>
  Some are sad, and some are afflicted with disease.<br>
  Whatever God does, He does by Himself.<br>
  Through loving devotion, and the Perfect Teachings of the Guru, the unstruck sound current of the Shabad is realized. ||12||<br>
  Some wander and roam around, hungry and naked.<br>
  Some act in stubbornness and die, but do not know the value of God.<br>
  They do not know the difference between good and bad; this is understood only through the practice of the Word of the Shabad. ||13||<br>
  Some bathe at sacred shrines and refuse to eat.<br>
  Some torment their bodies in burning fire.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained; how can anyone cross over? ||14||<br>
  Abandoning the Guru's Teachings, some wander in the wilderness.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are destitute; they do not meditate on the Lord.<br>
  They are ruined, destroyed and drowned from practicing falsehood; death is the enemy of the false. ||15||<br>
  By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, they come, and by the Hukam of His Command, they go.<br>
  One who realizes His Hukam, merges in the True Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, he merges in the True Lord, and his mind is pleased with the Lord. The Gurmukhs do His work. ||16||5||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  He Himself is the Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny.<br>
  He evaluates those whom He Himself has created.<br>
  He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the servant; He Himself created the Universe. ||1||<br>
  He is near at hand, not far away.<br>
  The Gurmukhs understand Him; perfect are those humble beings.<br>
  Associating with them night and day is profitable. This is the glorious greatness of associating with the Guru. ||2||<br>
  Throughout the ages, Your Saints are holy and sublime, O God.<br>
  They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, savoring it with their tongues.<br>
  They chant His Praises, and their pain and poverty are taken away; they are not afraid of anyone else. ||3||<br>
  They remain awake and aware, and do not appear to sleep.<br>
  They serve up Truth, and so save their companions and relatives.<br>
  They are not stained with the filth of sins; they are immaculate and pure, and remain absorbed in loving devotional worship. ||4||<br>
  O humble servants of the Lord, understand the Word of the Guru's Bani.<br>
  This youth, breath and body shall pass away.<br>
  O mortal, you shall die today or tomorrow; chant, and meditate on the Lord within your heart. ||5||<br>
  O mortal, abandon falsehood and your worthless ways.<br>
  Death viciously kills the false beings.<br>
  The faithless cynic is ruined through falsehood and his egotistical mind.On the path of duality, he rots away and decomposes. ||6||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 038</h2></center>
  Abandon slander and envy of others.<br>
  Reading and studying, they burn, and do not find tranquility.<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Lord, the Supreme Soul, shall be your helper and companion. ||7||<br>
  Abandon sexual desire, anger and wickedness.<br>
  Abandon your involvement in egotistical affairs and conflicts.<br>
  If you seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru, then you shall be saved. In this way you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Siblings of Destiny. ||8||<br>
  In the hereafter, you shall have to cross over the fiery river of poisonous flames.<br>
  No one else will be there; your soul shall be all alone.<br>
  The ocean of fire spits out waves of searing flames; the self-willed manmukhs fall into it, and are roasted there. ||9||<br>
  Liberation comes from the Guru; He grants this blessing by the Pleasure of His Will.<br>
  He alone knows the way, who obtains it.<br>
  So ask one who has obtained it, O Siblings of Destiny. Serve the True Guru, and find peace. ||10||<br>
  Without the Guru, he dies entangled in sin and corruption.<br>
  The Messenger of Death smashes his head and humiliates him.<br>
  The slanderous person is not freed of his bonds; he is drowned, slandering others. ||11||<br>
  So speak the Truth, and realize the Lord deep within.<br>
  He is not far away; look, and see Him.<br>
  No obstacles shall block your way; become Gurmukh, and cross over to the other side. This is the way to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||12||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the body.<br>
  The Creator Lord is eternal and imperishable.<br>
  The soul does not die, and it cannot be killed; God creates and watches over all. Through the Word of the Shabad, His Will is manifest. ||13||<br>
  He is immaculate, and has no darkness.<br>
  The True Lord Himself sits upon His throne.<br>
  The faithless cynics are bound and gagged, and forced to wander in reincarnation. They die, and are reborn, and continue coming and going. ||14||<br>
  The Guru's servants are the Beloveds of the True Guru.<br>
  Contemplating the Shabad, they sit upon His throne.<br>
  They realize the essence of reality, and know the state of their inner being. This is the true glorious greatness of those who join the Sat Sangat. ||15||<br>
  He Himself saves His humble servant, and saves his ancestors as well.<br>
  His companions are liberated; He carries them across.<br>
  Nanak is the servant and slave of that Gurmukh who lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Lord. ||16||6||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  For many ages, only darkness prevailed;<br>
  the infinite, endless Lord was absorbed in the primal void.<br>
  He sat alone and unaffected in absolute darkness; the world of conflict did not exist. ||1||<br>
  Thirty-six ages passed like this.<br>
  He causes all to happen by the Pleasure of His Will.<br>
  No rival of His can be seen. He Himself is infinite and endless. ||2||<br>
  God is hidden throughout the four ages - understand this well.<br>
  He pervades each and every heart, and is contained within the belly.<br>
  The One and Only Lord prevails throughout the ages. How rare are those who contemplate the Guru, and understand this. ||3||<br>
  From the union of the sperm and the egg, the body was formed.<br>
  From the union of air, water and fire, the living being is made.<br>
  He Himself plays joyfully in the mansion of the body; all the rest is just attachment to Maya's expanse. ||4||<br>
  Within the mother's womb, upside-down, the mortal meditated on God.<br>
  The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything.<br>
  With each and every breath, he contemplated the True Name, deep within himself, within the womb. ||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 039</h2></center>
  He came into the world to obtain the four great blessings.<br>
  He came to dwell in the home of the Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter.<br>
  But he forgot the One Lord, and he has lost the game. The blind person forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||6||<br>
  The child dies in his childish games.<br>
  They cry and mourn, saying that he was such a playful child.<br>
  The Lord who owns him has taken him back. Those who weep and mourn are mistaken. ||7||<br>
  What can they do, if he dies in his youth?<br>
  They cry out, "His is mine, he is mine!"<br>
  They cry for the sake of Maya, and are ruined; their lives in this world are cursed. ||8||<br>
  Their black hair eventually turns grey.<br>
  Without the Name, they lose their wealth, and then leave.<br>
  They are evil-minded and blind - they are totally ruined; they are plundered, and cry out in pain. ||9||<br>
  One who understands himself, does not cry.<br>
  When he meets the True Guru, then he understands.<br>
  Without the Guru, the heavy, hard doors are not opened. Obtaining the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. ||10||<br>
  The body grows old, and is beaten out of shape.<br>
  But he does not meditate on the Lord, His only friend, even at the end.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he departs with his face blackened. The false are humiliated in the Court of the Lord. ||11||<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, the false ones depart.<br>
  Coming and going, dust falls on their heads.<br>
  The soul-bride finds no home in her in-laws' home, the world hereafter; she suffers in agony in this world of her parents' home. ||12||<br>
  She eats, dresses and plays joyfully,<br>
  but without loving devotional worship of the Lord, she dies uselessly.<br>
  One who does not distinguish between good and evil, is beaten by the Messenger of Death; how can anyone escape this? ||13||<br>
  One who realizes what he has to possess, and what he has to abandon,<br>
  associating with the Guru, comes to know the Word of the Shabad, within the home of his own self.<br>
  Do not call anyone else bad; follow this way of life. Those who are true are judged to be genuine by the True Lord. ||14||<br>
  Without Truth, no one succeeds in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Through the True Shabad, one is robed in honor.<br>
  He forgives those with whom He is pleased; they silence their egotism and pride. ||15||<br>
  One who realizes the Hukam of God's Command, by the Grace of the Guru,<br>
  comes to know the lifestyle of the ages.<br>
  O Nanak, chant the Naam, and cross over to the other side. The True Lord will carry you across. ||16||1||7||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  I have no other friend like the Lord.<br>
  He gave me body and mind, and infused consciousness into my being.<br>
  He cherishes and cares for all beings; He is deep within, the wise, all-knowing Lord. ||1||<br>
  The Guru is the sacred pool, and I am His beloved swan.<br>
  In the ocean, there are so many jewels and rubies.<br>
  The Lord's Praises are pearls, gems and diamonds. Singing His Praises, my mind and body are drenched with His Love. ||2||<br>
  The Lord is inaccessible, inscrutable, unfathomable and unattached.<br>
  The Lord's limits cannot be found; the Guru is the Lord of the World.<br>
  Through the Teachings of the True Guru, the Lord carries us across to the other side. He unites in His Union those who are colored by His Love. ||3||<br>
  Without the True Guru, how can anyone be liberated?<br>
  He has been the Friend of the Lord, from the very beginning of time, and all throughout the ages.<br>
  By His Grace, He grants liberation in His Court; He forgives them for their sins. ||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 040</h2></center>
  The True Guru, the Giver, grants liberation;<br>
  all diseases are eradicated, and one is blessed with the Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  Death, the tax collector, does not impose any tax on one whose inner fire has been put out, whose heart is cool and tranquil. ||5||<br>
  The body has developed a great love for the soul-swan.<br>
  He is a Yogi, and she is a beautiful woman.<br>
  Day and night, he enjoys her with delight, and then he arises and departs without consulting her. ||6||<br>
  Creating the Universe, God remains diffused throughout it.<br>
  In the wind, water and fire, He vibrates and resounds.<br>
  The mind wavers, keeping company with evil passions; one obtains the rewards of his own actions. ||7||<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, one suffers the misery of his evil ways.<br>
  When the order to depart is issued, how can he remain here?<br>
  He falls into the pit of hell, and suffers like a fish out of water. ||8||<br>
  The faithless cynic has to endure 8.4 million hellish incarnations.<br>
  As he acts, so does he suffer.<br>
  Without the True Guru, there is no liberation. Bound and gagged by his own actions, he is helpless. ||9||<br>
  This path is very narrow, like the sharp edge of a sword.<br>
  When his account is read, he shall be crushed like the sesame seed in the mill.<br>
  Mother, father, spouse and child - none is anyone's friend in the end. Without the Lord's Love, no one is liberated. ||10||<br>
  You may have many friends and companions in the world,<br>
  but without the Guru, the Transcendent Lord Incarnate, there is no one at all.<br>
  Service to the Guru is the way to liberation. Night and day, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||11||<br>
  Abandon falsehood, and pursue the Truth,<br>
  and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires.<br>
  Very few are those who trade in the merchandise of Truth. Those who deal in it, obtain the true profit. ||12||<br>
  Depart with the merchandise of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,<br>
  and you shall intuitively obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, in the Mansion of His Presence.<br>
  The Gurmukhs search for Him and find Him; they are the perfect humble beings. In this way, they see Him, who looks upon all alike. ||13||<br>
  God is endless; following the Guru's Teachings, some find Him.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they instruct their minds.<br>
  Accept as True, Perfectly True, the Word of the True Guru's Bani. In this way, you shall merge in the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||14||<br>
  Naarad and Saraswati are Your servants.<br>
  Your servants are the greatest of the great, throughout the three worlds.<br>
  Your creative power permeates all; You are the Great Giver of all. You created the whole creation. ||15||<br>
  Some serve at Your Door, and their sufferings are dispelled.<br>
  They are robed with honor in the Court of the Lord, and emancipated by the True Guru.<br>
  The True Guru breaks the bonds of egotism, and restrains the fickle consciousness. ||16||<br>
  Meet the True Guru, and search for the way,<br>
  by which you may find God, and not have to answer for your account.<br>
  Subdue your egotism, and serve the Guru; O servant Nanak, you shall be drenched with the Lord's Love. ||17||2||8||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  My Lord is the Destroyer of demons.<br>
  My Beloved Lord is pervading each and every heart.<br>
  The unseen Lord is always with us, but He is not seen at all. The Gurmukh contemplates the record. ||1||<br>
  The Holy Gurmukh seeks Your Sanctuary.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 041</h2></center>
  God grants His Grace, and carries him across to the other side.<br>
  The ocean is very deep, filled with fiery water; the Guru, the True Guru, carries us across to the other side. ||2||<br>
  The blind, self-willed manmukh does not understand.<br>
  He comes and goes in reincarnation, dying, and dying again.<br>
  The primal inscription of destiny cannot be erased. The spiritually blind suffer terribly at Death's door. ||3||<br>
  Some come and go, and do not find a home in their own heart.<br>
  Bound by their past actions, they commit sins.<br>
  The blind ones have no understanding, no wisdom; they are trapped and ruined by greed and egotism. ||4||<br>
  Without her Husband Lord, what good are the soul-bride's decorations?<br>
  She has forgotten her Lord and Master, and is infatuated with another's husband.<br>
  Just as no one knows who is the father of the prostitute's son, such are the worthless, useless deeds that are done. ||5||<br>
  The ghost, in the body-cage, suffers all sorts of afflictions.<br>
  Those who are blind to spiritual wisdom, putrefy in hell.<br>
  The Righteous Judge of Dharma collects the balance due on the account, of those who forget the Name of the Lord. ||6||<br>
  The scorching sun blazes with flames of poison.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is dishonored, a beast, a demon.<br>
  Trapped by hope and desire, he practices falsehood, and is afflicted by the terrible disease of corruption. ||7||<br>
  He carries the heavy load of sins on his forehead and head.<br>
  How can he cross the terrifying world-ocean?<br>
  From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, the True Guru has been the boat; through the Lord's Name, He carries us across. ||8||<br>
  The love of one's children and spouse is so sweet in this world.<br>
  The expansive expanse of the Universe is attachment to Maya.<br>
  The True Guru snaps the noose of Death, for that Gurmukh who contemplates the essence of reality. ||9||<br>
  Cheated by falsehood, the self-willed manmukh walks along many paths;<br>
  he may be highly educated, but he burns in the fire.<br>
  The Guru is the Great Giver of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. Chanting the Naam, sublime peace is obtained. ||10||<br>
  The True Guru, in His Mercy, implants Truth within.<br>
  All suffering is eradicated, and one is placed on the Path.<br>
  Not even a thorn ever pierces the foot of one who has the True Guru as his Protector. ||11||<br>
  Dust mixes with dust, when the body wastes away.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is like a stone slab, which is impervious to water.<br>
  He cries out and weeps and wails; he is reincarnated into heaven and then hell. ||12||<br>
  They live with the poisonous snake of Maya.<br>
  This duality has ruined so many homes.<br>
  Without the True Guru, love does not well up. Imbued with devotional worship, the soul is satisfied. ||13||<br>
  The faithless cynics chase after Maya.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, how can they find peace?<br>
  In the three qualities, they are destroyed; they cannot cross over to the other side. ||14||<br>
  The false are called pigs and dogs.<br>
  They bark themselves to death; they bark and bark and howl in fear.<br>
  False in mind and body, they practice falsehood; through their evil-mindedness, they lose out in the Court of the Lord. ||15||<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, the mind is stabilized.<br>
  One who seeks His Sanctuary is blessed with the Lord's Name.<br>
  They are given the priceless wealth of the Lord's Name; singing His Praises, they are His beloveds in His court. ||16||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 042</h2></center>
  In the Sanctuary of the Holy, chant the Lord's Name.<br>
  Through the True Guru's Teachings, one comes to know His state and extent.<br>
  Nanak: chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; the Lord, the Uniter, shall unite you with Himself. ||17||3||9||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  Remain in your own home, O my foolish and ignorant mind.<br>
  Meditate on the Lord - concentrate deep within your being and meditate on Him.<br>
  Renounce your greed, and merge with the infinite Lord. In this way, you shall find the door of liberation. ||1||<br>
  If you forget Him, the Messenger of Death will catch sight of you.<br>
  All peace will be gone, and you will suffer in pain in the world hereafter.<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord as Gurmukh, O my soul; this is the supreme essence of contemplation. ||2||<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the sweetest essence.<br>
  As Gurmukh, see the essence of the Lord deep within.<br>
  Day and night, remain imbued with the Lord's Love. This is the essence of all chanting, deep meditation and self-discipline. ||3||<br>
  Speak the Guru's Word, and the Name of the Lord.<br>
  In the Society of the Saints, search for this essence.<br>
  Follow the Guru's Teachings - seek and find the home of your own self, and you shall never be consigned to the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||<br>
  Bathe at the sacred shrine of Truth, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Reflect upon the essence of reality, and lovingly focus your consciousness on the Lord.<br>
  At the very last moment, the Messenger of Death will not be able to touch you, if you chant the Name of the Beloved Lord. ||5||<br>
  The True Guru, the Primal Being, the Great Giver, is all-knowing.<br>
  Whoever has Truth within himself, merges in the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  One whom the True Guru unites in Union, is rid of the overpowering fear of death. ||6||<br>
  The body is formed from the union of the five elements.<br>
  Know that the Lord's jewel is within it.<br>
  The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found. ||7||<br>
  Abide in truth and contentment, O humble Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Hold tight to compassion and the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<br>
  Know your soul, and know the Supreme Soul; associating with the Guru, you shall be emancipated. ||8||<br>
  The faithless cynics are stuck in falsehood and deceit.<br>
  Day and night, they slander many others.<br>
  Without meditative remembrance, they come and then go, and are cast into the hellish womb of reincarnation. ||9||<br>
  The faithless cynic is not rid of his fear of death.<br>
  The Messenger of Death's club is never taken away.<br>
  He has to answer to the Righteous Judge of Dharma for the account of his actions; the egotistical being carries the unbearable load. ||10||<br>
  Tell me: without the Guru, what faithless cynic has been saved?<br>
  Acting egotistically, he falls into the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  Without the Guru, no one is saved; meditating on the Lord, they are carried across to the other side. ||11||<br>
  No one can erase the Guru's blessings.<br>
  The Lord carries across those whom He forgives.<br>
  The pains of birth and death do not even approach those whose minds are filled with God, the infinite and endless. ||12||<br>
  Those who forget the Guru come and go in reincarnation.<br>
  They are born, only to die again, and continue committing sins.<br>
  The unconscious, foolish, faithless cynic does not remember the Lord; but when he is stricken with pain, then he cries out for the Lord. ||13||<br>
  Pleasure and pain are the consequences of the actions of past lives.<br>
  The Giver, who blesses us with these - He alone knows.<br>
  So who can you blame, O mortal being? The hardships you suffer are from your own actions. ||14||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 043</h2></center>
  Practicing egotism and possessiveness, you have come into the world.<br>
  Hope and desire bind you and lead you on.<br>
  Indulging in egotism and self-conceit, what will you be able to carry with you, except the load of ashes from poison and corruption? ||15||<br>
  Worship the Lord in devotion, O humble Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Speak the Unspoken Speech, and the mind will merge back into the Mind.<br>
  Restrain your restless mind within its own home, and the Lord, the Destroyer, shall destroy your pain. ||16||<br>
  I seek the support of the Perfect Guru, the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh loves the Lord; the Gurmukh realizes the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, the intellect is exalted; granting His forgiveness, the Lord carries him across to the other side. ||17||4||10||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  O Divine Guru, I have entered Your Sanctuary.<br>
  You are the Almighty Lord, the Merciful Lord.<br>
  No one knows Your wondrous plays; You are the perfect Architect of Destiny. ||1||<br>
  From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You cherish and sustain Your beings.<br>
  You are in each and every heart, O Merciful Lord of incomparable beauty.<br>
  As You will, You cause all to walk; everyone acts according to Your Command. ||2||<br>
  Deep within the nucleus of all, is the Light of the Life of the World.<br>
  The Lord enjoys the hearts of all, and drinks in their essence.<br>
  He Himself gives, and He himself takes; He is the generous father of the beings of the three worlds. ||3||<br>
  Creating the world, He has set His play into motion.<br>
  He placed the soul in the body of air, water and fire.<br>
  The body-village has nine gates; the Tenth Gate remains hidden. ||4||<br>
  There are four horrible rivers of fire.<br>
  How rare is that Gurmukh who understands this, and through the Word of the Shabad, remains unattached.<br>
  The faithless cynics are drowned and burnt through their evil-mindedness. The Guru saves those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord. ||5||<br>
  Water, fire, air, earth and ether<br>
  - in that house of the five elements, they dwell.<br>
  Those who remain imbued with the Word of the True Guru's Shabad, renounce Maya, egotism and doubt. ||6||<br>
  This mind is drenched with the Shabad, and satisfied.<br>
  Without the Name, what support can anyone have?<br>
  The temple of the body is being plundered by the thieves within, but this faithless cynic does not even recognize these demons. ||7||<br>
  They are argumentative demons, terrifying goblins.<br>
  These demons stir up conflict and strife.<br>
  Without awareness of the Shabad, one comes and goes in reincarnation; he loses his honor in this coming and going. ||8||<br>
  The body of the false person is just a pile of barren dirt.<br>
  Without the Name, what honor can you have?<br>
  Bound and gagged throughout the four ages, there is no liberation; the Messenger of Death keeps such a person under his gaze. ||9||<br>
  At Death's door, he is tied up and punished;<br>
  such a sinner does not obtain salvation.<br>
  He cries out in pain, like the fish pierced by the hook. ||10||<br>
  The faithless cynic is caught in the noose all alone.<br>
  The miserable spiritually blind person is caught in the power of Death.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not known. He shall waste away, today or tomorrow. ||11||<br>
  Other than the True Guru, no one is your friend.<br>
  Here and hereafter, God is the Savior.<br>
  He grants His Grace, and bestows the Lord's Name. He merges with Him, like water with water. ||12||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 044</h2></center>
  The Guru instructs His wandering Sikhs;<br>
  if they go astray, He sets them on the right path.<br>
  So serve the Guru, forever, day and night; He is the Destroyer of pain - He is with you as your companion. ||13||<br>
  O mortal being, what devotional worship have you performed to the Guru?<br>
  Even Brahma, Indra and Shiva do not know it.<br>
  Tell me, how can the unknowable True Guru be known? He alone attains this realization, whom the Lord forgives. ||14||<br>
  One who has love within, obtains the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.<br>
  One who enshrines love for the Word of the Guru's Bani, meets with Him.<br>
  Day and night, the Gurmukh sees the immaculate Divine Light everywhere; this lamp illuminates his heart. ||15||<br>
  The food of spiritual wisdom is the supremely sweet essence.<br>
  Whoever tastes it, sees the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<br>
  Beholding His Darshan, the unattached one meets the Lord; subduing the mind's desires, he merges into the Lord. ||16||<br>
  Those who serve the True Guru are supreme and famous.<br>
  Deep within each and every heart, they recognize God.<br>
  Please bless Nanak with the Lord's Praises, and the Sangat, the Congregation of the Lord's humble servants; through the True Guru, they know their Lord God. ||17||5||11||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  The True Lord is the Creator of the Universe.<br>
  He established and contemplates the worldly sphere.<br>
  He Himself created the creation, and beholds it; He is True and independent. ||1||<br>
  He created the beings of different kinds.<br>
  The two travellers have set out in two directions.<br>
  Without the Perfect Guru, no one is liberated. Chanting the True Name, one profits. ||2||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs read and study, but they do not know the way.<br>
  They do not understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they wander, deluded by doubt.<br>
  They take bribes, and give false testimony; the noose of evil-mindedness is around their necks. ||3||<br>
  They read the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Puraanas;<br>
  they argue and debate, but do not know the essence of reality.<br>
  Without the Perfect Guru, the essence of reality is not obtained. The true and pure beings walk the Path of Truth. ||4||<br>
  All praise God and listen, and listen and speak.<br>
  He Himself is wise, and He Himself judges the Truth.<br>
  Those whom God blesses with His Glance of Grace become Gurmukh, and praise the Word of the Shabad. ||5||<br>
  Many listen and listen, and speak the Guru's Bani.<br>
  Listening and speaking, no one knows His limits.<br>
  He alone is wise, unto whom the unseen Lord reveals Himself; he speaks the Unspoken Speech. ||6||<br>
  At birth, the congratulations pour in;<br>
  the ignorant sing songs of joy.<br>
  Whoever is born, is sure to die, according to the destiny of past deeds inscribed upon his head by the Sovereign Lord King. ||7||<br>
  Union and separation were created by my God.<br>
  Creating the Universe, He gave it pain and pleasure.<br>
  The Gurmukhs remain unaffected by pain and pleasure; they wear the armor of humility. ||8||<br>
  The noble people are traders in Truth.<br>
  They purchase the true merchandise, contemplating the Guru.<br>
  One who has the wealth of the true commodity in his lap, is blessed with the rapture of the True Shabad. ||9||<br>
  The false dealings lead only to loss.<br>
  The trades of the Gurmukh are pleasing to God.<br>
  His stock is safe, and his capital is safe and sound. The noose of Death is cut away from around his neck. ||10||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 045</h2></center>
  Everyone speaks as they please.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh, in duality, does not know how to speak.<br>
  The blind person has a blind and deaf intellect; coming and going in reincarnation, he suffers in pain. ||11||<br>
  In pain he is born, and in pain he dies.<br>
  His pain is not relieved, without seeking the Sanctuary of the Guru.<br>
  In pain he is created, and in pain he perishes. What has he brought with himself? And what will he take away? ||12||<br>
  True are the actions of those who are under the Guru's influence.<br>
  They do not come and go in reincarnation, and they are not subject to the laws of Death.<br>
  Whoever abandons the branches, and clings to the true root, enjoys true ecstasy within his mind. ||13||<br>
  Death cannot strike down the people of the Lord.<br>
  They do not see pain on the most difficult path.<br>
  Deep within the nucleus of their hearts, they worship and adore the Lord's Name; there is nothing else at all for them. ||14||<br>
  There is no end to the Lord's sermon and Praise.<br>
  As it pleases You, I remain under Your Will.<br>
  I am embellished with robes of honor in the Court of the Lord, by the Order of the True King. ||15||<br>
  How can I chant Your uncounted glories?<br>
  Even the greatest of the great do not know Your limits.<br>
  Please bless Nanak with the Truth, and preserve his honor; You are the supreme emperor above the heads of kings. ||16||6||12||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl, Dakhanee:<br>
  Deep within the body-village is the fortress.<br>
  The dwelling of the True Lord is within the city of the Tenth Gate.<br>
  This place is permanent and forever immaculate. He Himself created it. ||1||<br>
  Within the fortress are balconies and bazaars.<br>
  He Himself takes care of His merchandise.<br>
  The hard and heavy doors of the Tenth Gate are closed and locked. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are thrown open. ||2||<br>
  Within the fortress is the cave, the home of the self.<br>
  He established the nine gates of this house, by His Command and His Will.<br>
  In the Tenth Gate, the Primal Lord, the unknowable and infinite dwells; the unseen Lord reveals Himself. ||3||<br>
  Within the body of air, water and fire, the One Lord dwells.<br>
  He Himself stages His wondrous dramas and plays.<br>
  By His Grace, water puts out the burning fire; He Himself stores it up in the watery ocean. ||4||<br>
  Creating the earth, He established it as the home of Dharma.<br>
  Creating and destroying, He remains unattached.<br>
  He stages the play of the breath everywhere. Withdrawing His power, He lets the beings crumble. ||5||<br>
  Your gardener is the vast vegetation of nature.<br>
  The wind blowing around is the chauree, the fly-brush, waving over You.<br>
  The Lord placed the two lamps, the sun and the moon; the sun merges in the house of the moon. ||6||<br>
  The five birds do not fly wild.<br>
  The tree of life is fruitful, bearing the fruit of Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  The Gurmukh intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; he eats the food of the Lord's sublime essence. ||7||<br>
  The dazzling light glitters, although neither the moon nor the stars are shining;<br>
  neither the sun's rays nor the lightning flashes across the sky.<br>
  I describe the indescribable state, which has no sign, where the all-pervading Lord is still pleasing to the mind. ||8||<br>
  The rays of Divine Light have spread out their brilliant radiance.<br>
  Having created the creation, the Merciful Lord Himself gazes upon it.<br>
  The sweet, melodious, unstruck sound current vibrates continuously in the home of the fearless Lord. ||9||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 046</h2></center>
  When the unstruck sound current resounds, doubt and fear run away.<br>
  God is all-pervading, giving shade to all.<br>
  All belong to You; to the Gurmukhs, You are known. Singing Your Praises, they look beautiful in Your Court. ||10||<br>
  He is the Primal Lord, immaculate and pure.<br>
  I know of no other at all.<br>
  The One Universal Creator Lord dwells within, and is pleasing to the mind of those who banishe egotism and pride. ||11||<br>
  I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, given by the True Guru.<br>
  I do not know any other second or third.<br>
  He is the One, Unique, Infinite and Endless Lord; He evaluates all beings and places some in His treasury. ||12||<br>
  Spiritual wisdom and meditation on the True Lord are deep and profound.<br>
  No one knows Your expanse.<br>
  All that are, beg from You; You are attained only by Your Grace. ||13||<br>
  You hold karma and Dharma in Your hands, O True Lord.<br>
  O Independent Lord, Your treasures are inexhaustible.<br>
  You are forever kind and compassionate, God. You unite in Your Union. ||14||<br>
  You Yourself see, and cause Yourself to be seen.<br>
  You Yourself establish, and You Yourself disestablish.<br>
  The Creator Himself unites and separates; He Himself kills and rejuvenates. ||15||<br>
  As much as there is, is contained within You.<br>
  You gaze upon Your creation, sitting within Your royal palace.<br>
  Nanak offers this true prayer; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, I have found peace. ||16||1||13||<br>
  Maaroo, First Mehl:<br>
  If I am pleasing to You, Lord, then I obtain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  In loving devotional worship, O True Lord, I sing Your Glorious Praises.<br>
  By Your Will, O Creator Lord, You have become pleasing to me, and so sweet to my tongue. ||1||<br>
  The devotees look beautiful in the Darbaar, the Court of God.<br>
  Your slaves, Lord, are liberated.<br>
  Eradicating self-conceit, they are attuned to Your Love; night and day, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Shiva, Brahma, gods and goddesses,<br>
  Indra, ascetics and silent sages serve You.<br>
  Celibates, givers of charity and the many forest-dwellers have not found the Lord's limits. ||3||<br>
  No one knows You, unless You let them know You.<br>
  Whatever is done, is by Your Will.<br>
  You created the 8.4 million species of beings; by Your Will, they draw their breath. ||4||<br>
  Whatever is pleasing to Your Will, undoubtedly comes to pass.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh shows off, and comes to grief.<br>
  Forgetting the Name, he finds no place of rest; coming and going in reincarnation, he suffers in pain. ||5||<br>
  Pure is the body, and immaculate is the swan-soul;<br>
  within it is the immaculate essence of the Naam.<br>
  Such a being drinks in all his pains like Ambrosial Nectar; he never suffers sorrow again. ||6||<br>
  For his excessive indulgences, he receives only pain;<br>
  from his enjoyments, he contracts diseases, and in the end, he wastes away.<br>
  His pleasure can never erase his pain; without accepting the Lord's Will, he wanders lost and confused. ||7||<br>
  Without spiritual wisdom, they all just wander around.<br>
  The True Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere, lovingly engaged.<br>
  The Fearless Lord is known through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru; one's light merges into the Light. ||8||<br>
  He is the eternal, unchanging, immeasurable Lord.<br>
  In an instant, He destroys, ang then reconstructs.<br>
  He has no form or shape, no limit or value. Pierced by the Shabad, one is satisfied. ||9||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 047</h2></center>

  The Truest of the True has the Truth is His lap.<br>
  The True Lord is pleased with those who love the Shabad.<br>
  Exerting His power, the Lord has established Truth throughout the three worlds; with Truth He is pleased. ||11||<br>
  Everyone calls Him the greatest of the great.<br>
  Without the Guru, no one understands Him.<br>
  The True Lord is pleased with those who merge in Truth; they are not separated again, and they do not suffer. ||12||<br>
  Separated from the Primal Lord, they loudly weep and wail.<br>
  They die and die, only to be reborn, when their time has passed.<br>
  He blesses those whom He forgives with glorious greatness; united with Him, they do not regret or repent. ||13 |<br>
  | He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer.<br>
  He Himself is satisfied, and He Himself is liberated.<br>

  Old age and death cannot even touch one who is in harmony with the True Lord. ||8||<br>
  The world is burning up in the fire of desire.<br>
  It burns and burns, and is destroyed in all its corruption.<br>

  Those who serve the True Guru are very fortunate.<br>
  They remain lovingly focused on the True Name forever.<br>
  The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, permeates the nucleus of their inner being; through the Shabad, their desires are quenched. ||10||<br>

  The self-willed manmukh wanders distracted, attached to duality.<br>
  That unfortunate wretch - why didn't he just die as soon as he was born?<br>
  Coming and going, he wastes away his life in vain. Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained. ||9||<br>
  That body which is stained with the filth of egotism is false and impure.<br>
  It may be washed a hundred times, but its filth is still not removed.<br>
  But if it is washed with the Word of the Shabad, then it is truly cleansed, and it shall never be soiled again. ||10||<br>
  The five demons destroy the body.<br>
  He dies and dies again, only to be reincarnated; he does not contemplate the Shabad.<br>
  The darkness of emotional attachment to Maya is within his inner being; as if in a dream, he does not understand. ||11||<br>

  That humble being who dies in the Shabad is perfect.<br>
  The brave, heroic True Guru chants and proclaims this.<br>
  Deep within the body is the true pool of Ambrosial Nectar; the mind drinks it in with loving devotion. ||4||<br>
  The Pandit, the religious scholar, reads and instructs others,<br>
  but he does not realize that his own home is on fire.<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, the Naam is not obtained. You can read until you are exhausted, but you shall not find peace and tranquility. ||5||<br>
  Some smear their bodies with ashes, and wander around in religious disguises.<br>

  They die in the Shabad, and dwell in the Lord's Name.<br>
  Night and day, they remain forever attuned to His Love; they focus their consciousness on loving devotion and the Fear of God. ||7||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh indulges in slander, and is ruined.<br>

  He who created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,<br>
  links each and every being to its tasks.<br>
  He merges into Himself, whoever is pleasing to His Will. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord. ||2||<br>
  The world is coming and going in reincarnation.<br>
  Attached to Maya, it dwells on its many sins.<br>
  One who realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad, praises forever the eternal, unchanging True Lord. ||3||<br>
  Some are attached to the root - they find peace.<br>
  But those who are attached to the branches, waste their lives away uselessly.<br>
  Those humble beings, who chant the Name of the Ambrosial Lord, produce the ambrosial fruit. ||4||<br>
  I have no virtues; what words should I speak?<br>
  You see all, and weigh them on Your scale.<br>
  By Your will, You preserve me, and so do I remain. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord. ||5||<br>

  The One Lord God is immersed in His Oneness. He is attuned forever to His own delight. ||7||<br>
  The body-lotus is withering away,<br>
  but the ignorant, self-willed manmukh does not understand the Shabad.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, he searches his body, and finds the Great Giver, the Life of the world. ||8||<br>
  The Lord frees up the body-fortress, which was seized by sins,<br>
  when one keeps the Dear Lord enshrined forever in the heart.<br>
  The fruits of his desires are obtained, and he is dyed in the permanent color of the Lord's Love. ||9||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh speaks of spiritual wisdom, but does not understand.<br>
  Again and again, he comes into the world, but he finds no place of rest.<br>
  The Gurmukh is spiritually wise, and praises the Lord forever. Throughout each and every age, the Gurmukh knows the One Lord. ||10||<br>
  All the deeds which the manmukh does bring pain - nothing but pain.<br>
  The Word of the Shabad is not within him; how can he go to the Court of the Lord?<br>
  The True Shabad dwells deep within the mind of the Gurmukh; he serves the Giver of peace forever. ||11||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 064</h2></center>
  Wherever I look, I see You, everywhere.<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, all this is known.<br>
  I meditate forever and ever on the Naam; this mind is imbued with the Naam. ||12||<br>
  Imbued with the Naam, the body is sanctified.<br>
  Without the Naam, they are drowned and die without water.<br>
  They come and go, but do not understand the Naam. Some, as Gurmukh, realize the Word of the Shabad. ||13||<br>
  The Perfect True Guru has imparted this understanding.<br>
  Without the Name, no one attains liberation.<br>
  Through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is blessed with glorious greatness; he remains intuitively attuned to the Lord's Love. ||14||<br>
  The body-village crumbles and collapses into a pile of dust.<br>
  Without the Shabad, the cycle of reincarnation is not brought to an end.<br>

  Devotion to the Lord is a treasure overflowing.<br>
  He Himself blesses us with contemplative meditation on the Shabad.<br>
  You do whatever You please; my mind is attuned to the True Lord. ||2||<br>

  All beings and creatures are under Your protection. One who is blessed by Your Grace realizes his own self. ||3||<br>
  One who receives Your Mercy, O Primal Lord,<br>
  does not die, and is not reborn; he is released from the cycle of reincarnation.<br>
  He sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, day and night, and, throughout the ages, he knows the One Lord. ||4||<br>
  Emotional attachment to Maya wells up throughout the whole world,<br>
  from Brahma, Vishnu and all the demi-gods.<br>
  Those who are pleasing to Your Will, are attached to the Naam; through spiritual wisdom and understanding, You are recognized. ||5||<br>

  Happiness and misery are totally loaded with pain.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh finds peace; such a Gurmukh recognizes the Naam. ||6||<br>
  No one can erase the record of one's actions.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one finds the door of salvation.<br>
  One who conquers self-conceit and recognizes the Lord, obtains the fruits of his pre-destined rewards. ||7||<br>
  Emotionally attached to Maya, one's consciousness is not attached to the Lord.<br>
  In the love of duality, he will suffer terrible agony in the world hereafter.<br>
  The hypocritical, self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt; at the very last moment, they regret and repent. ||8||<br>
  In accordance with the Lord's Will, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  He is rid of all sins, and all suffering.<br>
  The Lord is immaculate, and immaculate is the Word of His Bani. My mind is imbued with the Lord. ||9||<br>
  One who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, obtains the Lord, the treasure of virtue.<br>
  Egotism and possessiveness are brought to an end.<br>
  The One Lord is the only Giver of virtue and vice, merits and demerits; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this. ||10||<br>
  My God is immaculate, and utterly infinite.<br>
  God unites with Himself, through contemplation of the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 065</h2></center>

  One who understands the Guru's Teachings, contemplates this.<br>
  Conquering egotism, the mind becomes immaculate forever; with his tongue, he serves the Lord, the Giver of peace. ||12||<br>
  In the fortress of the body there are many shops and bazaars;<br>
  within them is the Naam, the Name of the utterly infinite Lord.<br>
  In His Court, one is embellished forever with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; he conquers egotism and realizes the Lord. ||13||<br>
  The jewel is priceless, inaccessible and infinite.<br>
  How can the poor wretch estimate its worth?<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is weighed, and so the Shabad is realized deep within. ||14||<br>
  The great volumes of the Simritees and the Shaastras only extend the extension of attachment to Maya.<br>
  The fools read them, but do not understand the Word of the Shabad. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand. ||15||<br>
  The Creator Himself acts, and causes all to act.<br>
  Through the True Word of His Bani, Truth is implanted deep within.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Naam, one is blessed with glorious greatness, and throughout the ages, the One Lord is known. ||16||9||<br>

  He attaches some humble beings to the Truth.<br>
  They serve the True Lord and practice Truth; through the Name, they are absorbed in the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  The Primal Lord unites His devotees in His Union.<br>
  He attaches them to true devotional worship.<br>
  One who sings forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord, through the True Word of His Bani, earns the profit of this life. ||3||<br>
  The Gurmukh trades, and understands his own self.<br>
  He knows no other than the One Lord.<br>

  He inspires a few to realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are true. He snaps the noose of death from around their necks. ||5||<br>
  He destroys, creates, embellishes and fashions all beings,<br>
  and attaches them to duality, attachment and Maya.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs wander around forever, acting blindly. Death has strung his noose around their necks. ||6||<br>
  He Himself forgives, and enjoins us to serve the Guru.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam comes to dwell within the mind.<br>
  Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the True Lord, and earn the profit of the Naam in this world. ||7||<br>

  Noble and exalted are those, within whose mind the Lord abides. Their heads are free of strife. ||8||<br>
  He is inaccessible and unfathomable; His value cannot be appraised.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, He dwells within the mind.<br>
  No one calls that person to account, who praises the Word of the Shabad, the Giver of virtue. ||9||<br>
  Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva serve Him.<br>
  Even they cannot find the limits of the unseen, unknowable Lord.<br>
  Those who are blessed by Your Glance of Grace, become Gurmukh, and comprehend the incomprehensible. ||10||<br>

  I chant the Naam, and meditate on the Naam. Singing His Glorious Praises, I enter the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||11||<br>
  The servant serves, and obeys the Command of the Infinite Lord.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs do not know the value of the Lord's Command.<br>
  By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, one is exalted; by His Hukam, one is glorified; by His Hukam, one becomes carefree. ||12||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one recognizes the Lord's Hukam.<br>
  The wandering mind is restrained, and brought back to the home of the One Lord.<br>

  Without the Shabad, no one crosses over to the other side.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the Shabad, are very detached. They earn the profit of the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||<br>
  Pain and pleasure are pre-ordained by the Creator.<br>
  He Himself has caused the love of duality to be pervasive.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh remains detached; how can anyone trust the self-willed manmukh? ||5||<br>
  Those who do not recognize the Shabad are manmukhs.<br>
  They do not know the essence of the Fear of the Guru.<br>
  Without this Fear, how can anyone find the Fearless True Lord? The Messenger of Death will pull the breath out. ||6||<br>
  The invulnerable Messenger of Death cannot be killed.<br>
  The Word of the Guru's Shabad prevents him from approaching.<br>
  When he hears the Word of the Shabad, he runs far away. He is afraid that the self-sufficient Dear Lord will kill him. ||7||<br>
  The Dear Lord is the Ruler above all.<br>
  What can this wretched Messenger of Death do?<br>
  As slave to the Hukam of the Lord's Command, the mortal acts according to His Hukam. According to His Hukam, he is deprived of his breath. ||8||<br>
  The Gurmukh realizes that the True Lord created the creation.<br>
  The Gurmukh knows that the Lord has expanded the entire expanse.<br>

  Attached to Maya, he is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death.<br>
  The noose of death around his neck will never be untied; in the love of duality, he wanders in reincarnation. ||11||<br>

  One who knows You as the Architect of Karma,<br>

  The self-willed manmukhs take great pride in themselves.<br>
  In the Court of the Lord, they are never honored.<br>
  Attached to duality, they waste their lives; without understanding, they suffer in pain. ||9||<br>
  My God has hidden Himself deep within the self.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one is united in the Lord's Union.<br>
  God is True, and True is His trade, through which the priceless Naam is obtained. ||10||<br>
  No one has found this body's value.<br>
  My Lord and Master has worked His handiwork.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh purifies his body, and then the Lord unites him with Himself. ||11||<br>
  Within the body, one loses, and within the body, one wins.<br>
  The Gurmukh seeks the self-sustaining Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh trades, and finds peace forever; he intuitively merges in the Celestial Lord. ||12||<br>
  True is the Lord's Mansion, and True is His treasure.<br>
  The Great Giver Himself gives.<br>
  The Gurmukh praises the Giver of peace; his mind is united with the Lord, and he comes to know His worth. ||13||<br>
  Within the body is the object; its value cannot be estimated.<br>
  He Himself grants glorious greatness to the Gurmukh.<br>
  He alone knows this object, to whom this store belongs; the Gurmukh is blessed with it, and does not come to regret. ||14||<br>
  The Dear Lord is pervading and permeating all.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, He is found.<br>
  He Himself unites in His Union; through the Word of the Shabad, one intuitively merges with Him. ||15||<br>

  What Glorious Virtues of Yours should I describe? I cannot describe them.<br>
  You have no end or limitation. Your value cannot be estimated.<br>
  When the Giver of peace Himself bestows His Mercy, the virtuous are absorbed in virtue. ||5||<br>
  In this world, emotional attachment is spread all over.<br>
  The ignorant, self-willed manmukh is immersed in utter darkness.<br>
  Chasing after worldly affairs, he wastes away his life in vain; without the Name, he suffers in pain. ||6||<br>
  If God grants His Grace, then one finds the True Guru.<br>
  Through the Shabad, the filth of egotism is burned away.<br>
  The mind becomes immaculate, and the jewel of spiritual wisdom brings enlightenment; the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled. ||7||<br>
  Your Names are countless; Your value cannot be estimated.<br>
  I enshrine the Lord's True Name within my heart.<br>
  Who can estimate Your value, God? You are immersed and absorbed in Yourself. ||8||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is priceless, inaccessible and infinite.<br>
  No one can weigh it.<br>
  You Yourself weigh, and estimate all; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You unite, when the weight is perfect. ||9||<br>
  Your servant serves, and offers this prayer.<br>
  Please, let me sit near You, and unite me with Yourself.<br>
  You are the Giver of peace to all beings; by perfect karma, we meditate on You. ||10||<br>
  Chastity, truth and self-control come by practicing and living the Truth.<br>
  This mind becomes immaculate and pure, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  In this world of poison, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained, if it pleases my Dear Lord. ||11||<br>
  He alone understands, whom God inspires to understand.<br>
  Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, one's inner being is awakened.<br>
  Egotism and possessiveness are silenced and subdued, and one intuitively finds the True Lord. ||12||<br>
  Without good karma, countless others wander around.<br>
  They die, and die again, only to be reborn; they cannot escape the cycle of reincarnation.<br>
  Imbued with poison, they practice poison and corruption, and they never find peace. ||13||<br>
  Many disguise themselves with religious robes.<br>
  Without the Shabad, no one has conquered egotism.<br>
  One who remains dead while yet alive is liberated, and merges in the True Name. ||14||<br>
  Spiritual ignorance and desire burn this human body.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 080</h2></center>

  Through the Shabad, one's comings and goings in reincarnation are ended.<br>
  He keeps the True Name enshrined within his heart.<br>
  He dies in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and conquers his mind; stilling his egotism, he merges in the Lord. ||5||<br>

  Without the True Guru, no one finds permanence and stability.<br>
  The Shabad shines its Light deep within the self, and one dwells in peace; one's light merges into the Light. ||6||<br>
  The five demons think of evil and corruption.<br>
  The expanse is the manifestation of emotional attachment to Maya.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, one is liberated, and the five demons are put under his control. ||7||<br>
  Without the Guru, there is only the darkness of attachment.<br>
  Over and over, time and time again, they are drowned.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, Truth is implanted within, and the True Name becomes pleasing to the mind. ||8||<br>

  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one easily, intuitively finds it.<br>
  There, one is not afflicted with sorrow or separation; merge into the Celestial Lord with intuitive ease. ||10||<br>
  The evil people live in the love of duality.<br>
  They wander around, totally attached and thirsty.<br>
  They sit in evil gatherings, and suffer in pain forever; they earn pain, nothing but pain. ||11||<br>
  Without the True Guru, there is no Sangat, no Congregation.<br>
  Without the Shabad, no one can cross over to the other side.<br>
  One who intuitively chants God's Glorious Praises day and night - his light merges into the Light. ||12||<br>
  The body is the tree; the bird of the soul dwells within it.<br>
  It drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, resting in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  It never flies away, and it does not come or go; it dwells within the home of its own self. ||13||<br>

  But there is one thing he cannot reach, and so his bride remains hungry and thirsty. ||3||<br>
  With her palms pressed together, the bride offers her prayer,<br>

  I do not come, and I do not go. The Guru has driven out my doubts. ||14||<br>
  Perfect is the Word of the Perfect Guru.<br>
  One who is attached to the Perfect Lord, is immersed in the Perfect Lord.<br>
  His love increases day by day, and when it is weighed, it does not decrease. ||15||<br>
  When the gold is made one hundred percent pure,<br>

  Your Naam is Ambrosial Nectar, O my Lord and Master.<br>

  The high and the low are all the same to Him. Focus your mind's meditation intuitively on Him. ||6||<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, all thirst is quenched.<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, one is not watched by Maya.<br>
  The Perfect Guru bestows truth and contentment; I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||7||<br>
  The Word of the Guru's Bani is contained in all.<br>
  He Himself hears it, and He Himself repeats it.<br>
  Those who meditate on it, are all emancipated; they attain the eternal and unchanging home. ||8||<br>
  The Glory of the True Guru is known only to the True Guru.<br>
  Whatever He does, is according to the Pleasure of His Will.<br>

  Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The Primal, Immaculate Lord God is formless.<br>
  The Detached Lord is Himself prevailing in all.<br>
  He has no race or social class, no identifying mark. By the Hukam of His Will, He created the entire universe. ||1||<br>
  Out of all the 8.4 million species of beings,<br>
  God blessed mankind with glory.<br>
  That human who misses this chance, shall suffer the pains of coming and going in reincarnation. ||2||<br>
  What should I say, to one who has been created.<br>
  The Gurmukh receives the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  He alone is confused, whom the Lord Himself confuses. He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. ||3||<br>
  This body has been made the village of joy and sorrow.<br>
  They alone are emancipated, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<br>
  One who remains untouched by the three qualities, the three gunas - such a Gurmukh is blessed with glory. ||4||<br>
  You can do anything, but whatever you do, only serves to tie your feet.<br>
  The seed which is planted out of season does not sprout, and all one's capital and profits are lost. ||5||<br>
  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are most sublime and exalted.<br>
  Become Gurmukh, chant and focus your meditation.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 088</h2></center>
  You shall save yourself, and save all your generations as well. You shall go to the Court of the Lord with honor. ||6||<br>
  All the continents, nether worlds, islands and worlds<br>
  - God Himself has made them all subject to death.<br>
  The One Imperishable Lord Himself is unmoving and unchanging. Meditating on Him, one becomes unchanging. ||7||<br>
  The Lord's servant becomes like the Lord.<br>
  Do not think that, because of his human body, he is different.<br>
  The waves of the water rise up in various ways, and then the water merges again in water. ||8||<br>
  A beggar begs for charity at His Door.<br>
  When God pleases, He takes pity on him.<br>
  Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, to satisfy my mind, O Lord. Through the Kirtan of Your Praises, my mind is held steady. ||9||<br>
  The Beauteous Lord and Master is not controlled in any way.<br>
  The Lord does that which pleases the Saints of the Lord.<br>
  He does whatever they wish to be done; nothing blocks their way at His Door. ||10||<br>
  Wherever the mortal is confronted with difficulty,<br>
  there he should meditate on the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  Where there are no children, spouse or friends, there the Lord Himself comes to the rescue. ||11||<br>
  The Great Lord and Master is inaccessible and unfathomable.<br>
  How can anyone meet with God, the self-suficient One?<br>
  Those who have had the noose cut away from around their necks, whom God has set back upon the Path, obtain a place in the Sangat, the Congregation. ||12||<br>
  One who realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command is said to be His servant.<br>
  He endures both bad and good equally.<br>
  When egotism is silenced, then one comes to know the One Lord. Such a Gurmukh intuitively merges in the Lord. ||13||<br>
  The devotees of the Lord dwell forever in peace.<br>
  With a child-like, innocent nature, they remain detached, turning away from the world.<br>
  They enjoy various pleasures in many ways; God caresses them, like a father caressing his son. ||14||<br>
  He is inaccessible and unfathomable; His value cannot be estimated.<br>
  We meet Him, only when He causes us to meet.<br>
  The Lord is revealed to those humble Gurmukhs, who have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. ||15||<br>
  You Yourself are the Creator Lord, the Cause of causes.<br>
  You created the Universe, and You support the whole earth.<br>
  Servant Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Door, O Lord; if it is Your Will, please preserve his honor. ||16||1||5||<br>

  What the ears hear is the Word of Your Bani.<br>
  There is nothing else to be seen at all. You give support to all. ||1||<br>
  You Yourself are conscious of Your Creation.<br>
  You Yourself established Yourself, O God.<br>
  Creating Yourself, You formed the expanse of the Universe; You Yourself cherish and sustain each and every heart. ||2||<br>
  You created some to hold great and royal courts.<br>
  Some turn away from the world in renunciation, and some maintain their households.<br>

  Forever, forever and ever, He shall always exist.<br>
  He is lofty, inaccessible, unfathomable and infinite.<br>
  He fills the empty, and empties out the filled; such are the plays and dramas of my Lord and Master. ||5||<br>
  With my mouth, I praise my True Lord King.<br>
  With my eyes, I behold the inaccessible and unfathomable Lord.<br>

  He created the creation, and gazes upon what He has created.<br>
  All beings and creatures meditate on Him.<br>
  He Himself knows His creative power; He blesses with His Glance of Grace. ||7||<br>
  Where the Saints gather together and sit, God dwells close at hand.<br>
  They abide in bliss and joy, beholding the Lord's wondrous play.<br>
  They sing the Glories of the Lord, and the unstruck sound current of His Bani; O Nanak, His slaves remain conscious of Him. ||8||<br>
  Coming and going is all Your wondrous play.<br>
  Creating the Creation, You gaze upon Your infinite play.<br>
  Creating the Creation, You Yourself cherish and nurture it. ||9||<br>
  Listening, listening to Your Glory, I live.<br>
  Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You.<br>
  With my palms pressed together, I meditate in remembrance on You, day and night, O my inaccessible, infinite Lord and Master. ||10||<br>
  Other than You, who else should I praise?<br>
  I meditate on the One and Only Lord within my mind.<br>
  Realizing the Hukam of Your Will, Your humble servants are enraptured; this is the achievement of Your devotees. ||11||<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, I meditate on the True Lord within my mind.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, I am immersed in the Lord's Love.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, all bonds are broken, and this doubt and emotional attachment are burnt away. ||12||<br>
  Wherever He keeps me, is my place of rest.<br>
  Whatever naturally happens, I accept that as good.<br>
  Hatred is gone - I have no hatred at all; I see the One Lord in all. ||13||<br>
  Fear has been removed, and darkness has been dispelled.<br>
  The all-powerful, primal, detached Lord God has been revealed.<br>
  Forsaking self-conceit, I have entered His Sanctuary, and I work for Him. ||14||<br>
  Rare are those few, very blessed people, who come into the world,<br>
  and meditate on their Lord and Master, twenty-four hours a day.<br>
  Associating with such humble people, all are saved, and their families are saved as well. ||15||<br>
  This is the blessing which I have received from my Lord and Master.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, with my palms pressed together, I meditate on Him.<br>
  I chant the Naam, and through the Naam, I intuitively merge into the Lord; O Nanak, may I be blessed with the Naam, and ever repeat it. ||16||1||6||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Do not be fooled by appearances, you fool.<br>
  This is a false attachment to the expanse of an illusion.<br>
  No one can remain in this world; only the One Lord is permanent and unchanging. ||1||<br>
  Seek the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru.<br>
  He shall eradicate all emotional attachment, sorrow and doubt.<br>
  He shall administer the medicine, the Mantra of the One Name. Sing the True Name within your heart. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 090</h2></center>
  So many gods yearn for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  All the devotees serve Him.<br>
  He is the Master of the masterless, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor. His Name is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||3||<br>
  I cannot conceive of any other door.<br>
  One who wanders through the three worlds, understands nothing.<br>
  The True Guru is the banker, with the treasure of the Naam. This jewel is obtained from Him. ||4||<br>
  The dust of His feet purifies.<br>
  Even the angelic beings and gods cannot obtain it, O friend.<br>
  The True Guru is the True Primal Being, the Transcendent Lord God; meeting with Him, one is carried across to the other side. ||5||<br>
  O my beloved mind, if you wish for the 'tree of life';<br>
  if you wish for Kaamadhayna, the wish-fulfilling cow to adorn your court;<br>
  if you wish to be satisfied and contented, then serve the Perfect Guru, and practice the Naam, the source of nectar. ||6||<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the five thieves of desire are conquered.<br>
  In the Fear of the Supreme Lord God, you shall become immaculate and pure.<br>
  When one meets the Perfect Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, His touch reveals the Lord, the Philosopher's Stone. ||7||<br>
  Myriads of heavens do not equal the Lord's Name.<br>
  The spiritually wise forsake mere liberation.<br>
  The One Universal Creator Lord is found through the True Guru. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||8||<br>
  No one knows how to serve the Guru.<br>
  The Guru is the unfathomable, Supreme Lord God.<br>
  He alone is the Guru's servant, whom the Guru Himself links to His service, and upon whose forehead such blessed destiny is inscribed. ||9||<br>
  Even the Vedas do not know the Guru's Glory.<br>
  They narrate only a tiny bit of what is heard.<br>
  The True Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Incomparable One; meditating in remembrance on Him, the mind is cooled and soothed. ||10||<br>
  Hearing of Him, the mind comes to life.<br>
  When He dwells within the heart, one becomes peaceful and cool.<br>
  Chanting the Guru's Name with the mouth, one obtains glory, and does not have to walk on the Path of Death. ||11||<br>
  I have entered the Sanctuary of the Saints,<br>
  and placed before them my soul, my breath of life and wealth.<br>
  I know nothing about service and awareness; please take pity upon this worm. ||12||<br>
  I am unworthy; please merge me into Yourself.<br>
  Please bless me with Your Grace, and link me to Your service.<br>
  I wave the fan, and grind the corn for the Saints; washing their feet, I find peace. ||13||<br>
  After wandering around at so many doors, I have come to Yours, O Lord.<br>
  By Your Grace, I have entered Your Sanctuary.<br>
  Forever and ever, keep me in the Company of the Saints; please bless me with this Gift of Your Name. ||14||<br>

  That person, whom You bless with Your Grace, and link to Your devotional service, wins this invaluable human life. ||8||<br>
  He, within whose mind God dwells,<br>
  has perfect karma, and chants the Chant of the Guru.<br>
  One who realizes God pervading deep within all, does not wander crying in reincarnation again. ||9||<br>

  O imperishable, eternal, unfathomable Lord, everything is attached to You. ||7||<br>
  The Lover of greatness, who dwells in heaven.<br>
  By the Pleasure of His Will, He took incarnation as the great fish and the tortoise.<br>
  The Lord of beauteous hair, the Worker of miraculous deeds, whatever He wishes, comes to pass. ||8||<br>
  He is beyond need of any sustenance, free of hate and all-pervading.<br>
  He has staged His play; He is called the four-armed Lord.<br>
  He assumed the beautiful form of the blue-skinned Krishna; hearing His flute, all are fascinated and enticed. ||9||<br>
  He is adorned with garlands of flowers, with lotus eyes.<br>
  His ear-rings, crown and flute are so beautiful.<br>
  He carries the conch, the chakra and the war club; He is the Great Charioteer, who stays with His Saints. ||10||<br>
  The Lord of yellow robes, the Master of the three worlds.<br>
  The Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the world; with my mouth, I chant His Name.<br>
  The Archer who draws the bow, the Beloved Lord God; I cannot count all His limbs. ||11||<br>
  He is said to be free of anguish, and absolutely immaculate.<br>
  The Lord of prosperity, pervading the water, the land and the sky.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 095</h2></center>
  He is near this world and the nether regions of the underworld; His Place is permanent, ever-stable and imperishable. ||12||<br>
  The Purifier of sinners, the Destroyer of pain and fear.<br>
  The Eliminator of egotism, the Eradicator of coming and going.<br>
  He is pleased with devotional worship, and merciful to the meek; He cannot be appeased by any other qualities. ||13||<br>
  The Formless Lord is undeceivable and unchanging.<br>
  He is the Embodiment of Light; through Him, the whole world blossoms forth.<br>
  He alone unites with Him, whom He unites with Himself. No one can attain the Lord by himself. ||14||<br>
  He Himself is the milk-maid, and He Himself is Krishna.<br>
  He Himself grazes the cows in the forest.<br>
  You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy. Not even a particle of filth attaches to You. ||15||<br>
  Which of Your Glorious Virtues can I chant with my one tongue?<br>
  Even the thousand-headed serpent does not know Your limit.<br>
  One may chant new names for You day and night, but even so, O God, no one can describe even one of Your Glorious Virtues. ||16||<br>
  I have grasped the Support, and entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Father of the world.<br>
  The Messenger of Death is terrifying and horrendous, and sea of Maya is impassable.<br>
  Please be merciful, Lord, and save me, if it is Your Will; please lead me to join with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||17||<br>
  All that is seen is an illusion.<br>
  I beg for this one gift, for the dust of the feet of the Saints, O Lord of the Universe.<br>
  Applying it to my forehead, I obtain the supreme status; he alone obtains it, unto whom You give it. ||18||<br>
  Those, unto whom the Lord, the Giver of peace, grants His Mercy,<br>
  grasp the feet of the Holy, and weave them into their hearts.<br>
  They obtain all the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds within their minds. ||19||<br>
  With my tongue I chant the Names given to You.<br>
  'Sat Naam' is Your perfect, primal Name.<br>
  Says Nanak, Your devotees have entered Your Sanctuary. Please bestow the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; their minds are filled with love for You. ||20||<br>
  You alone know Your state and extent.<br>
  You Yourself speak, and You Yourself describe it.<br>
  Please make Nanak the slave of Your slaves, O Lord; as it pleases Your Will, please keep him with Your slaves. ||21||2||11||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  O slave of the inaccessible Lord God Allah,<br>
  forsake thoughts of worldly entanglements.<br>
  Become the dust of the feet of the humble fakeers, and consider yourself a traveller on this journey. O saintly dervish, you shall be approved in the Court of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Let Truth be your prayer, and faith your prayer-mat.<br>
  Subdue your desires, and overcome your hopes.<br>
  Let your body be the mosque, and your mind the priest. Let true purity be God's Word for you. ||2||<br>
  Let your practice be to live the spiritual life.<br>
  Let your spiritual cleansing be to renounce the world and seek God.<br>
  Let control of the mind be your spiritual wisdom, O holy man; meeting with God, you shall never die again. ||3||<br>
  Practice within your heart the teachings of the Koran and the Bible;<br>
  restrain the ten sensory organs from straying into evil.<br>
  Tie up the five demons of desire with faith, charity and contentment, and you shall be acceptable. ||4||<br>
  Let compassion be your Mecca, and the dust of the feet of the holy your fast.<br>
  Let Paradise be your practice of the Prophet's Word.<br>
  God is the beauty, the light and the fragrance. Meditation on Allah is the secluded meditation chamber. ||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 096</h2></center>
  He alone is a Qazi, who practices the Truth.<br>
  He alone is a Haji, a pilgrim to Mecca, who purifies his heart.<br>
  He alone is a Mullah, who banishes evil; he alone is a saintly dervish, who takes the Support of the Lord's Praise. ||6||<br>
  Always, at every moment, remember God, the Creator within your heart.<br>
  Let your meditation beads be the subjugation of the ten senses. Let good conduct and self-restraint be your circumcision. ||7||<br>
  You must know in your heart that everything is temporary.<br>
  Family, household and siblings are all entanglements.<br>
  Kings, rulers and nobles are mortal and transitory; only God's Gate is the permanent place. ||8||<br>
  First, is the Lord's Praise; second, contentment;<br>
  third, humility, and fourth, giving to charities.<br>
  Fifth is to hold one's desires in restraint. These are the five most sublime daily prayers. ||9||<br>
  Let your daily worship be the knowledge that God is everywhere.<br>
  Let renunciation of evil actions be the water-jug you carry.<br>
  Let realization of the One Lord God be your call to prayer; be a good child of God - let this be your trumpet. ||10||<br>
  Let what is earned righteously be your blessed food.<br>
  Wash away pollution with the river of your heart.<br>
  One who realizes the Prophet attains heaven. Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, does not cast him into hell. ||11||<br>
  Let good deeds be your body, and faith your bride.<br>
  Play and enjoy the Lord's love and delight.<br>
  Purify what is impure, and let the Lord's Presence be your religious tradition. Let your total awareness be the turban on your head. ||12||<br>
  To be Muslim is to be kind-hearted,<br>
  and wash away pollution from within the heart.<br>
  He does not even approach worldly pleasures; he is pure, like flowers, silk, ghee and the deer-skin. ||13||<br>
  One who is blessed with the mercy and compassion of the Merciful Lord,<br>
  is the manliest man among men.<br>
  He alone is a Shaykh, a preacher, a Haji, and he alone is God's slave, who is blessed with God's Grace. ||14||<br>
  The Creator Lord has Creative Power; the Merciful Lord has Mercy.<br>
  The Praises and the Love of the Merciful Lord are unfathomable.<br>
  Realize the True Hukam, the Command of the Lord, O Nanak; you shall be released from bondage, and carried across. ||15||3||12||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Abode of the Supreme Lord God is above all.<br>
  He Himself establishes, establishes and creates.<br>
  Holding tight to the Sanctuary of God, peace is found, and one is not afflicted by the fear of Maya. ||1||<br>
  He saved you from the fire of the womb,<br>
  and did not destroy you, when you were an egg in your mother's ovary.<br>
  Blessing you with meditative remembrance upon Himself, He nurtured you and cherished you; He is the Master of all hearts. ||2||<br>
  I have come to the Sanctuary of His lotus feet.<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Praises of the Lord.<br>
  I have erased all the pains of birth and death; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, I have no fear of death. ||3||<br>
  God is all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable and divine.<br>
  All beings and creatures serve Him.<br>
  In so many ways, He cherishes those born from eggs, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth. ||4||<br>
  He alone obtains this wealth,<br>
  who savors and enjoys, deep within his mind, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Grasping hold of his arm, God lifts him up and pulls him out of the deep, dark pit. Such a devotee of the Lord is very rare. ||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 097</h2></center>
  God exists in the beginning, in the middle and in the end.<br>
  Whatever the Creator Lord Himself does, comes to pass.<br>
  Doubt and fear are erased, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and then one is not afflicted by deadly pain. ||6||<br>
  I sing the most Sublime Bani, the Word of the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saadh Sangat.<br>
  Eradicating desire, I have become free of desire; I have burnt away all my sins. ||7||<br>
  This is the unique way of the Saints;<br>
  they behold the Supreme Lord God with them.<br>
  With each and every breath, they worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har. How could anyone be too lazy to meditate on Him? ||8||<br>
  Wherever I look, there I see the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  I never forget God, my Lord and Master, even for an instant.<br>
  Your slaves live by meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord; You are permeating the woods, the water and the land. ||9||<br>
  Even the hot wind does not touch one<br>
  who remains awake in meditative remembrance, night and day.<br>
  He delights and enjoys meditative remembrance on the Lord; he has no attachment to Maya. ||10||<br>
  Disease, sorrow and pain do not affect him;<br>
  he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Please bless me with Your Name, O my Beloved Lord God; please listen to my prayer, O Creator. ||11||<br>
  Your Name is a jewel, O my Beloved Lord.<br>
  Your slaves are imbued with Your Infinite Love.<br>
  Those who are imbued with Your Love, become like You; it is so rare that they are found. ||12||<br>
  My mind longs for the dust of the feet of those<br>
  who never forget the Lord.<br>
  Associating with them, I obtain the supreme status; the Lord, my Companion, is always with me. ||13||<br>
  He alone is my beloved friend and companion,<br>
  who implants the Name of the One Lord within, and eradicates evil-mindedness.<br>
  Immaculate are the teachings of that humble servant of the Lord, who casts out sexual desire, anger and egotism. ||14||<br>
  Other than You, O Lord, no one is mine.<br>
  The Guru has led me to grasp the feet of God.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru, who has destroyed the illusion of duality. ||15||<br>
  With each and every breath, I never forget God.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  O Nanak, the Saints are imbued with Your Love; You are the great and all-powerful Lord. ||16||4||13||<br>
  Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I enshrine the Lord's lotus feet continually within my heart.<br>
  Each and every moment, I humbly bow to the Perfect Guru.<br>
  I dedicate my body, mind and everything, and place it in offering before the Lord. His Name is the most beautiful in this world. ||1||<br>
  Why forget the Lord and Master from your mind?<br>
  He blessed you with body and soul, creating and embellishing you.<br>
  With every breath and morsel of food, the Creator takes care of His beings, who receive according to what they have done. ||2||<br>
  No one returns empty-handed from Him;<br>
  twenty-four hours a day, keep the Lord in your mind.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 098</h2></center>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate and vibrate upon your imperishable Lord and Master, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  The four great blessings, and the eighteen miraculous spiritual powers,<br>
  are found in the treasure of the Naam, which brings celestial peace and poise, and the nine treasures.<br>
  If you yearn in your mind for all joys, then join the Saadh Sangat, and dwell upon your Lord and Master. ||4||<br>
  The Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas proclaim<br>
  that the mortal must be victorious in this priceless human life.<br>
  Forsaking sexual desire, anger and slander, sing of the Lord with your tongue, O Nanak. ||5||<br>
  He has no form or shape, no ancestry or social class.<br>
  The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading day and night.<br>
  Whoever meditates on Him is very fortunate; he is not consigned to reincarnation again. ||6||<br>
  One who forgets the Primal Lord, the Architect of karma,<br>
  wanders around burning, and remains tormented.<br>
  No one can save such an ungrateful person; he is thrown into the most horrible hell. ||7||<br>
  He blessed you with your soul, the breath of life, your body and wealth;<br>
  He preserved and nurtured you in your mother's womb.<br>
  Forsaking His Love, you are imbued with another; you shall never achieve your goals like this. ||8||<br>
  Please shower me with Your Merciful Grace, O my Lord and Master.<br>
  You dwell in each and every heart, and are near everyone.<br>
  Nothing is in my hands; he alone knows, whom You inspire to know. ||9||<br>
  One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead,<br>
  that person is not afflicted by Maya.<br>
  Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary forever; there is no other equal to You. ||10||<br>
  In His Will, He made all pain and pleasure.<br>
  How rare are those who remember the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  His value cannot be described. He is prevailing everywhere. ||11||<br>
  He is the devotee; He is the Great Giver.<br>
  He is the Perfect Primal Lord, the Architect of karma.<br>
  He is your help and support, since infancy; He fulfills your mind's desires. ||12||<br>
  Death, pain and pleasure are ordained by the Lord.<br>
  They do not increase or decrease by anyone's efforts.<br>
  That alone happens, which is pleasing to the Creator; speaking of himself, the mortal ruins himself. ||13||<br>
  He lifts us up and pulls us out of the deep dark pit;<br>
  He unites with Himself, those who were separated for so many incarnations.<br>
  Showering them with His Mercy, He protects them with His own hands. Meeting with the Holy Saints, they meditate on the Lord of the Universe. ||14||<br>
  Your worth cannot be described.<br>
  Wondrous is Your form, and Your glorious greatness.<br>
  Your humble servant begs for the gift of devotional worship. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||15||1||14||22||24||2||14||62||<br>

  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  If virtue is sold when there is no buyer, then it is sold very cheap.<br>
  But if one meets a buyer of virtue, then virtue sells for hundreds of thousands.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 099</h2></center>
  Meeting with a virtuous person, virtue is obtained, and one is immersed in the True Guru.<br>
  Priceless virtues are not obtained for any price; they cannot be purchased in a store.<br>
  O Nanak, their weight is full and perfect; it never decreases at all. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they wander around, continually coming and going in reincarnation.<br>
  Some are in bondage, and some are set free; some are happy in the Love of the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, believe in the True Lord, and practice Truth, through the lifestyle of Truth. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  From the Guru, I have obtained the supremely powerful sword of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  I have cut down the fortress of duality and doubt, attachment, greed and egotism.<br>
  The Name of the Lord abides within my mind; I contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Through Truth, self-discipline and sublime understanding, the Lord has become very dear to me.<br>
  Truly, truly, the True Creator Lord is all-pervading. ||1||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Among the ragas, Kaydaaraa Raga is known as good, O Siblings of Destiny, if through it, one comes to love the Word of the Shabad,<br>
  and if one remains in the Soceity of the Saints, and enshrines love for the True Lord.<br>
  Such a person washes away the pollution from within, and saves his generations as well.<br>
  He gathes in the capital of virtue, and destroys and drives out unvirtuous sins.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone is known as united, who does not forsake his Guru, and who does not love duality. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Gazing upon the world-ocean, I am afraid of death; but if I live in the Fear of You, God, then I am not afraid.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I am content; O Nanak, I blossom forth in the Name. ||2||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  I get on board the boat and set out, but the ocean is churning with waves.<br>
  The boat of Truth encounters no obstruction, if the Guru gives encouragement.<br>
  He takes us across to the door on the other side, as the Guru keeps watch.<br>
  O Nanak, if I am blessed with His Grace, I shall go to His Court with honor. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Enjoy your kingdom of bliss; as Gurmukh, practice Truth.<br>
  Sitting upon the throne of Truth, the Lord administers justice; He unites us in Union with the Society of the Saints.<br>
  Meditating on the Lord, through the True Teachings, we become just like the Lord.<br>
  If the Lord, the Giver of peace, abides in the mind, in this world, then in the end, He becomes our help and support.<br>
  Love for the Lord wells up, when the Guru imparts understanding. ||2||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Confused and deluded, I wander around, but no one shows me the way.<br>
  I go and ask the clever people, if there is there anyone who can rid me of my pain.<br>
  If the True Guru abides within my mind, then I see the Lord, my best friend, there.<br>
  O Nanak, my mind is satisfied and fulfilled, contemplating the Praises of the True Name. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  He Himself is the Doer, and He is the deed; He Himself issues the Command.<br>
  He Himself forgives some, and He Himself does the deed.<br>
  O Nanak, receiving the Divine Light from the Guru, suffering and corruption are burnt away, through the Name. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Don't be fooled by gazing at the riches of Maya, you foolish self-willed manmukh.<br>
  It shall not go along with you when you must depart; all the wealth you see is false.<br>
  The blind and ignorant do not understand, that the sword of death is hanging over their heads.<br>

  Those who do not meet with the Guru, who have no Fear of God at all,<br>
  continue coming and going in reincarnation, and suffer terrible pain; their anxiety is never relieved.<br>
  They are beaten like clothes being washed on the rocks, and struck every hour like chimes.<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Name, these entanglements are not removed from hanging over one's head. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  I have searched throughout the three worlds, O my friend; egotism is bad for the world.<br>
  Don't worry, O my soul; speak the Truth, O Nanak, the Truth, and only the Truth. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The Lord Himself forgives the Gurmukhs; they are absorbed and immersed in the Lord's Name.<br>
  He Himself links them to devotional worship; they bear the Insignia of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Those who turn towards the Guru, as sunmukh, are beautiful. They are famous in the Court of the True Lord.<br>
  In this world, and in the world hereafter, they are liberated; they realize the Lord.<br>
  Blessed, blessed are those humble beings who serve the Lord. I am a sacrifice to them. ||4||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  The rude, ill-mannered bride is encased in the body-tomb; she is blackened, and her mind is impure.<br>
  She can enjoy her Husband Lord, only if she is virtuous. O Nanak, the soul-bride is unworthy, and without virtue. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  She has good conduct, true self-discipline, and a perfect family.<br>
  O Nanak, day and night, she is always good; she loves her Beloved Husband Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  One who realizes his own self, is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Granting His Mercy, the Guru merges him in the Word of His Shabad.<br>
  The Word of the Guru's Bani is immaculate and pure; through it, one drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord.<br>
  Those who taste the sublime essence of the Lord, forsake other flavors.<br>
  Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, they remain satisfied forever; their hunger and thirst are quenched. ||5||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Her Husband Lord is pleased, and He enjoys His bride; the soul-bride adorns her heart with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, that bride who stands before Him, is the most noble and respected woman. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  In her father-in-law's home hereafter, and in her parents' home in this world, she belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is inaccessible and unfathomable.<br>
  O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her carefree, independent Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  That king sits upon the throne, who is worthy of that throne.<br>
  Those who realize the True Lord, they alone are the true kings.<br>
  These mere earthly rulers are not called kings; in the love of duality, they suffer.<br>
  Why should someone praise someone else who is also created? They depart in no time at all.<br>
  The One True Lord is eternal and imperishable. One who, as Gurmukh, understands becomes eternal as well. ||6||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The One Lord is the Husband of all. No one is without the Husband Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, they are the pure soul-brides, who merge in the True Guru. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The mind is churning with so many waves of desire. How can one be emancipated in the Court of the Lord?<br>
  Be absorbed in the Lord's True Love, and imbued with the deep color of the Lord's Infinite Love.<br>
  O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, one is emancipated, if the consciousness is attached to the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The Name of the Lord is priceless. How can its value be estimated?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 101</h2></center>
  He Himself created the entire universe, and He Himself is pervading it.<br>
  The Gurmukhs praise the Lord forever, and through the Truth, they assess Him.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the heart-lotus blossoms forth, and in this way, one drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord.<br>
  Coming and going in reincarnation ceases, and one sleeps in peace and poise. ||7||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Neither dirty, nor dull, nor saffron, nor any color that fades.<br>

  The bumble bee intuitively and fearlessly dwells among the vegetation, flowers and fruits.<br>
  O Nanak, there is only one tree, one flower, and one bumble bee. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Those humble beings who struggle with their minds are brave and distinguished heroes.<br>
  Those who realize their own selves, remain forever united with the Lord.<br>
  This is the glory of the spiritual teachers, that they remain absorbed in their mind.<br>
  They attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and focus their meditation on the True Lord.<br>
  Those who conquer their own minds, by Guru's Grace, conquer the world. ||8||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  If I were to become a Yogi, and wander around the world, begging from door to door,<br>
  then, when I am summoned to the Court of the Lord, what answer could I give?<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the charity I beg for; contentment is my temple. The True Lord is always with me.<br>
  Nothing is obtained by wearing religious robes; all will be seized by the Messenger of Death.<br>
  O Nanak, talk is false; contemplate the True Name. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Through that door, you will be called to account; do not serve at that door.<br>
  Seek and find such a True Guru, who has no equal in His greatness.<br>
  In His Sanctuary, one is released, and no one calls him to account.<br>
  Truth is implanted within Him, and He implants Truth within others. He bestows the blessing of the True Shabad.<br>
  One who has Truth within his heart - his body and mind are also true.<br>
  O Nanak, if one submits to the Hukam, the Command of the True Lord God, he is blessed with true glory and greatness.<br>
  He is immersed and merged in the True Lord, who blesses him with His Glance of Grace. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  They are not called heroes, who die of egotism, suffering in pain.<br>
  The blind ones do not realize their own selves; in the love of duality, they rot.<br>
  They struggle with great anger; here and hereafter, they suffer in pain.<br>
  The Dear Lord is not pleased by egotism; the Vedas proclaim this clearly.<br>
  Those who die of egotism, shall not find salvation. They die, and are reborn in reincarnation. ||9||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The crow does not become white, and an iron boat does not float across.<br>
  One who puts his faith in the treasure of his Beloved Lord is blessed; he exalts and embellishes others as well.<br>
  One who realizes the Hukam of God's Command - his face is radiant and bright; he floats across, like iron upon wood.<br>
  Forsake thirst and desire, and abide in the Fear of God; O Nanak, these are the most excellent actions. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The ignorant people who go to the desert to conquer their minds, are not able to conquer them.<br>
  O Nanak, if this mind is to be conquered, one must contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  This mind is not conquered by conquering it, even though everyone longs to do so.<br>
  O Nanak, the mind itself conquers the mind, if one meets with the True Guru. ||2||<br>

  He created both sides; Shiva dwells within Shakti (the soul dwells within the material universe).<br>
  Through the material universe of Shakti, no one has ever found the Lord; they continue to be born and die in reincarnation.<br>
  Serving the Guru, peace is found, meditating on the Lord with every breath and morsel of food.<br>
  Searching and looking through the Simritees and the Shaastras, I have found that the most sublime person is the slave of the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Naam, nothing is permanent and stable; I am a sacrifice to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  I might become a Pandit, a religious scholar, or an astrologer, and recite the four Vedas with my mouth;<br>
  I might be worshipped throughout the nine regions of the earth for my wisdom and thought;<br>

  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is immersed in the Lord. Meditating on the Lord, one comes to realize the Lord.<br>
  He alone is emancipated in the Sanctuary of the Lord, who struggles with his own mind.<br>
  One who contemplates and meditates on the Lord in his mind, succeeds in the Court of the Lord. ||11||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Submit to the Will of the Lord Commander; in His Court, only Truth is accepted.<br>
  Your Lord and Master shall call you to account; do not go astray on beholding the world.<br>
  One who keeps watch over his heart, and keeps his heart pure, is a dervish, a saintly devotee.<br>
  Love and affection, O Nanak, are in the accounts placed before the Creator. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  One who is unattached like the bumble bee, sees the Lord of the world everywhere.<br>
  The diamond of his mind is pierced through with the Diamond of the Lord's Name; O Nanak, his neck is embellished with it. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted by death; they cling to Maya in emotional attachment.<br>
  In an instant, they are thrown to the ground and killed; in the love of duality, they are deluded.<br>
  This opportunity shall not come into their hands again; they are beaten by the Messenger of Death with his stick.<br>
  But Death's stick does not even strike those who remain awake and aware in the Love of the Lord.<br>
  All are Yours, and cling to You; only You can save them. ||12||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  See the imperishable Lord everywhere; attachment to wealth brings only great pain.<br>
  Loaded with dust, you have to cross over the world-ocean; you are not carrying the profit and capital of the Name with you. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  My capital is Your True Name, O Lord; this wealth is inexhaustible and infinite.<br>
  O Nanak, this merchandise is immaculate; blessed is the banker who trades in it. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Know and enjoy the primal, eternal Love of the Great Lord and Master.<br>
  Blessed with the Naam, O Nanak, you shall strike down the Messenger of Death, and push his face to the ground. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself has embellished the body, and placed the nine treasures of the Naam within it.<br>
  He confuses some in doubt; fruitless are their actions.<br>
  Some, as Gurmukh, realize their Lord, the Supreme Soul.<br>
  Some listen to the Lord, and obey Him; sublime and exalted are their actions.<br>
  Love for the Lord wells up deep within, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. ||13||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 103</h2></center>
  The Fear of God abides in the mind of the innocent; this is the straight path to the One Lord.<br>
  Jealousy and envy bring terrible pain, and one is cursed throughout the three worlds. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The drum of the Vedas vibrates, bringing dispute and divisiveness.<br>
  O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord; there is none except Him. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The world-ocean of the three qualities is unfathomably deep; how can its bottom be seen?<br>
  If I meet with the great, self-sufficient True Guru, then I am carried across.<br>
  This ocean is filled up with pain and suffering.<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Name, no one's hunger is appeased. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Those who search their inner beings, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, are exalted and adorned.<br>
  They obtain what they wish for, meditating on the Lord's Name.<br>
  One who is blessed by God's Grace, meets with the Guru; he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  The Righteous Judge of Dharma is his friend; he does not have to walk on the Path of Death.<br>
  He meditates on the Lord's Name, day and night; he is absorbed and immersed in the Lord's Name. ||14||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Listen to and speak the Name of the One Lord, who permeates the heavens, this world and the nether regions of the underworld.<br>
  The Hukam of His Command cannot be erased; whatever He has written, shall go with the mortal.<br>
  Who has died, and who kills? Who comes and who goes?<br>
  Who is enraptured, O Nanak, and whose consciousness merges in the Lord? ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  In egotism, he dies; possessiveness kills him, and the breath flows out like a river.<br>
  Desire is exhausted, O Nanak, only when the mind is imbued with the Name.<br>
  His eyes are imbued with the eyes of the Lord, and his ears ring with celestial consciousness.<br>
  His tongue drinks in the sweet nectar, dyed crimson by chanting the Name of the Beloved Lord.<br>
  His inner being is drenched with the Lord's fragrance; his worth cannot be described. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  In this age, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the treasure. Only the Naam goes along in the end.<br>
  It is inexhaustible; it is never empty, no matter how much one may eat, consume or spend.<br>
  The Messenger of Death does not even approach the humble servant of the Lord.<br>
  They alone are the true bankers and traders, who have the wealth of the Lord in their laps.<br>
  By the Lord's Mercy, one finds the Lord, only when the Lord Himself sends for him. ||15||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The self-willed manmukh does not appreciate the excellence of trading in Truth. He deals in poison, collects poison, and is in love with poison.<br>
  Outwardly, they call themselves Pandits, religious scholars, but in their minds they are foolish and ignorant.<br>
  They do not focus their consciousness on the Lord; they love to engage in arguments.<br>
  They speak to cause arguments, and earn their living by telling lies.<br>
  In this world, only the Lord's Name is immaculate and pure. All other objects of creation are polluted.<br>
  O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are polluted; they die in ignorance. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Without serving the Lord, he suffers in pain; accepting the Hukam of God's Command, pain is gone.<br>
  He Himself is the Giver of peace; He Himself awards punishment.<br>
  O Nanak, know this well; all that happens is according to His Will. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, the world is poor. Without the Name, no one is satisfied.<br>
  He is deluded by duality and doubt. In egotism, he suffers in pain.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 104</h2></center>
  Without good karma, he does not obtain anything, no matter how much he may wish for it.<br>
  Coming and going in reincarnation, and birth and death are ended, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  He Himself acts, so unto whom should we complain? There is no other at all. ||16||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  In this world, the Saints earn the wealth; they come to meet God through the True Guru.<br>
  The True Guru implants the Truth within; the value of this wealth cannot be described.<br>
  Obtaining this wealth, hunger is relieved, and peace comes to dwell in the mind.<br>
  Only those who have such pre-ordained destiny, come to receive this.<br>
  The world of the self-willed manmukh is poor, crying out for Maya.<br>
  Night and day, it wanders continually, and its hunger is never relieved.<br>
  It never finds calm tranquility, and peace never comes to dwell in its mind.<br>
  It is always plagued by anxiety, and its cynicism never departs.<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Guru, the intellect is perverted; if one meets the True Guru, then one practices the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Forever and ever, he dwells in peace, and merges in the True Lord. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The One who created the world, takes care of it.<br>
  Meditate in remembrance on the One Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; there is none other than Him.<br>
  So eat the food of the Shabad and goodness; eating it, you shall remain satisfied forever.<br>
  Dress yourself in the Praise of the Lord. Forever and ever, it is radiant and bright; it is never polluted.<br>
  I have intuitively earned the true wealth, which never decreases.<br>
  The body is adorned with the Shabad, and is at peace forever and ever.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Lord, who reveals Himself. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Deep within the self are meditation and austere self-discipline, when one realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, egotism and ignorance are eliminated.<br>
  One's inner being is overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar; tasting it, the flavor is known.<br>
  Those who taste it become fearless; they are satisfied with the sublime essence of the Lord.<br>
  Those who drink it in, by the Grace of the Lord, are never again afflicted by death. ||17||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  People tie up bundles of demerits; no one deals in virtue.<br>
  Rare is that person, O Nanak, who purchases virtue.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one is blessed with virtue, when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Merits and demerits are the same; they are both created by the Creator.<br>
  O Nanak, one who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, finds peace, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The King sits on the throne within the self; He Himself administers justice.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord's Court is known; within the self is the Sanctuary, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>
  The coins are assayed, and the genuine coins are placed in His treasury, while the counterfeit ones find no place.<br>
  The Truest of the True is all-pervading; His justice is forever True.<br>
  One comes to enjoy the Ambrosial essence, when the Name is enshrined in the mind. ||18||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  When one acts in egotism, then You are not there, Lord. Wherever You are, there is no ego.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 105</h2></center>
  O spiritual teachers, understand this: the Unspoken Speech is in the mind.<br>
  Without the Guru, the essence of reality is not found; the Invisible Lord dwells everywhere.<br>
  One meets the True Guru, and then the Lord is known, when the Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in the mind.<br>
  When self-conceit departs, doubt and fear also depart, and the pain of birth and death is removed.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, the Unseen Lord is seen; the intellect is exalted, and one is carried across.<br>
  O Nanak, chant the chant of 'Sohang hansaa' - 'He is me, and I am Him.' The three worlds are absorbed in Him. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Some assay their mind-jewel, and contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Only a few of those humble beings are known in this world, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.<br>
  One's self remains blended with the Lord's Self, when egotism and duality are conquered.<br>
  O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam cross over the difficult, treacherous and terrifying world-ocean. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs do not search within their own selves; they are deluded by their egotistical pride.<br>
  Wandering in the four directions, they grow weary, tormented by burning desire within.<br>
  They do not study the Simritees and the Shaastras; the manmukhs waste away and are lost.<br>
  Without the Guru, no one finds the Naam, the Name of the True Lord.<br>
  One who contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom and meditates on the Lord is saved. ||19||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  He Himself knows, He Himself acts, and He Himself does it right.<br>
  So stand before Him, O Nanak, and offer your prayers. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  He who created the creation, watches over it; He Himself knows.<br>
  Unto whom should I speak, O Nanak, when everything is contained within the home of the heart? ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Forget everything, and be friends with the One Lord alone.<br>
  Your mind and body shall be enraptured, and the Lord shall burn away your sins.<br>
  Your comings and goings in reincarnation shall cease; you shall not be reborn and die again.<br>
  The True Name shall be your Support, and you shall not burn in sorrow and attachment.<br>
  O Nanak, gather in the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your mind. ||20||<br>
  Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You do not forget Maya from your mind; you beg for it with each and every breath.<br>
  You do not even think of that God; O Nanak, it is not in your karma. ||1||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Maya and its wealth shall not go along with you, so why do you cling to it - are you blind?<br>
  Meditate on the Guru's Feet, and the bonds of Maya shall be cut away from you. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  By the Pleasure of His Will, the Lord inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command; by the Pleasure of His Will, we find peace.<br>
  By the Pleasure of His Will, He leads us to meet the True Guru; by the Pleasure of His Will, we meditate on the Truth.<br>
  There is no other gift as great as the Pleasure of His Will; this Truth is spoken and proclaimed.<br>
  Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, practice and live the Truth.<br>
  Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; He created the world. ||21||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who do not have spiritual wisdom within, do not have even an iota of the Fear of God.<br>
  O Nanak, why kill those who are already dead? The Lord of the Universe Himself has killed them. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  To read the horoscope of the mind, is the most sublime joyful peace.<br>
  He alone is called a good Brahmin, who understands God in contemplative meditation.<br>
  He praises the Lord, and reads of the Lord, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 106</h2></center>
  Celebrated and approved is the coming into the world of such a person, who saves all his generations as well.<br>
  Hereafter, no one is questioned about social status; excellent and sublime is the practice of the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Other study is false, and other actions are false; such people are in love with poison.<br>
  They do not find any peace within themselves; the self-willed manmukhs waste away their lives.<br>
  O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are saved; they have infinite love for the Guru. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself creates the creation, and gazes upon it; He Himself is totally True.<br>
  One who does not understand the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, is false.<br>
  By the Pleasure of His Will, the True Lord joins the Gurmukh to Himself.<br>
  He is the One Lord and Master of all; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we are blended with Him.<br>
  The Gurmukhs praise Him forever; all are beggars of Him.<br>
  O Nanak, as He Himself makes us dance, we dance. ||22||1||<br>

  My eyes long for You; when will I see Your Vision? ||1||<br>

  Even clothes and food are frightening to me, as long as I do not see my Beloved. ||2||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I rise early, O my Husband Lord, to behold Your Vision.<br>
  Eye make-up, garlands of flowers, and the flavor of betel leaf, are all nothing but dust, without seeing You. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You are True, O my True Lord and Master; You uphold all that is true.<br>
  You created the world, making a place for the Gurmukhs.<br>
  By the Will of the Lord, the Vedas came into being; they discriminate between sin and virtue.<br>
  You created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and the expanse of the three qualities.<br>
  Creating the world of the nine regions, O Lord, You have embellished it with beauty.<br>
  Creating the beings of various kinds, You infused Your power into them.<br>
  No one knows Your limit, O True Creator Lord.<br>
  You Yourself know all ways and means; You Yourself save the Gurmukhs. ||1||<br>

  No one can equal You; You are imperishable and eternal, the Savior of the world.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 107</h2></center>

  But even this is not pleasing to me, to wear a garland around my neck. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  O Supreme Lord God, O Transcendent Lord, You do not take birth.<br>
  By the Hukam of Your Command, You formed the Universe; forming it, You merge into it.<br>
  Your Form cannot be known; how can one meditate on You?<br>
  You are pervading and permeating all; You Yourself reveal Your creative potency.<br>
  Your treasures of devotional worship are overflowing; they never decrease.<br>
  These gems, jewels and diamonds - their value cannot be estimated.<br>

  God spreads out the expanse of the entire universe, and He Himself plays in it.<br>
  He created this coming and going of reincarnation; creating the wondrous play, He gazes upon it.<br>

  O Nanak, the loaves of bread are baked and placed on the plate.<br>
  Those who obey their Guru, eat and are totally satisfied. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You have staged this play in the world, and infused egotism into all beings.<br>
  In the one temple of the body are the five thieves, who continually misbehave.<br>
  The ten brides, the sensory organs were created, and the one husband, the self; the ten are engrossed in flavors and tastes.<br>
  This Maya fascinates and entices them; they wander continually in doubt.<br>
  You created both sides, spirit and matter, Shiva and Shakti.<br>
  Matter loses out to spirit; this is pleasing to the Lord.<br>
  You enshrined spirit within, which leads to merger with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<br>
  Within the bubble, You formed the bubble, which shall once again merge into the water. ||6||<br>

  Nanak: with Your Name within my mind, O my Husband Lord, I am filled with delight. ||1||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Enjoyment of clothes and corrupt pleasures - all these are nothing more than dust.<br>
  I long for the dust of the feet of those who are imbued with the Lord's Vision. ||2||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Why do you look in other directions? O my heart, take the Support of the Lord alone.<br>
  Become the dust of the feet of the Saints, and find the Lord, the Giver of peace. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Without good karma, the Dear Lord is not found; without the True Guru, the mind is not joined to Him.<br>
  Only the Dharma remains stable in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; these sinners will not last at all.<br>
  Whatever one does with this hand, he obtains with the other hand, without a moment's delay.<br>
  I have examined the four ages, and without the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, egotism does not depart.<br>
  Egotism is never eradicated without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  As long as one's mind is torn away from his Lord and Master, he finds no place of rest.<br>
  That humble being, who, as Gurmukh, serves the Lord, has the Support of the Imperishable Lord in the home of his heart.<br>
  By the Lord's Grace, peace is obtained, and one is attached to the feet of the Guru, the True Guru. ||11||<br>
  Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have searched everywhere for the King over the heads of kings.<br>
  That Master is within my heart; I chant His Name with my mouth. ||1||<br>

  O my mother, the Master has blessed me with the jewel.<br>
  My heart is cooled and soothed, chanting the True Name with my mouth. ||2||<br>

  I have become the bed for my Beloved Husband Lord; my eyes have become the sheets.<br>
  If You look at me, even for an instant, then I obtain peace beyond all price. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  My mind longs to meet the Lord; how can I obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan?<br>
  I obtain hundreds of thousands, if my Lord and Master speaks to me, even for an instant.<br>
  I have searched in four directions; there is no other as great as You, Lord.<br>
  Show me the Path, O Saints. How can I meet God?<br>
  I dedicate my mind to Him, and renounce my ego. This is the Path which I shall take.<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I serve my Lord and Master continually.<br>
  All my hopes are fulfilled; the Guru has ushered me into the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>
  I cannot conceive of any other as great as You, O my Friend, O Lord of the World. ||12||<br>
  Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have become the throne for my Beloved Lord King.<br>
  If You place Your foot on me, I blossom forth like the lotus flower. ||1||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  If my Beloved becomes hungry, I will become food, and place myself before Him.<br>
  I may be crushed, again and again, but like sugarcane, I do not stop yielding sweet juice. ||2||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Break off your love with the cheaters; realize that it is a mirage.<br>
  Your pleasure lasts for only two moments; this traveller wanders through countless homes. ||3||<br>

  Those who read the Vedas in their entirety, still do not see the sublime essence of reality.<br>
  They apply ceremonial marks to their foreheads, and take cleansing baths, but they are blackened within.<br>
  They wear religious robes, but without the True Teachings, God is not found.<br>

  Pauree:<br>
  By wearing religious robes outwardly, God, the Inner-knower is not found.<br>
  Without the One Dear Lord, all wander around aimlessly.<br>
  Their minds are imbued with attachment to family, and so they continually wander around, puffed up with pride.<br>
  The arrogant wander around the world; why are they so proud of their wealth?<br>
  Their wealth shall not go with them when they depart; in an instant, it is gone.<br>
  They wander around in the world, according to the Hukam of the Lord's Command.<br>
  When one's karma is activated, one finds the Guru, and through Him, the Lord and Master is found.<br>
  That humble being, who serves the Lord, has his affairs resolved by the Lord. ||14||<br>
  Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  All speak with their mouths, but rare are those one who realize death.<br>
  Nanak is the dust of the feet of those who have faith in the One Lord. ||1||<br>

  There is no obscuring veil on the body of that one, O Nanak, who meets the Guru. ||2||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I drink in the water which has washed the feet of those who share the Teachings.<br>
  My body is filled with infinite love to see my True Master. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Fearless Lord, he becomes attached to Maya.<br>
  He comes and goes, and wanders, dancing in countless incarnations.<br>
  He gives his word, but then backs out. All that he says is false.<br>
  The false person is hollow within; he is totally engrossed in falsehood.<br>
  He tries to take vengeance upon the Lord, who bears no vengeance; such a person is trapped by falsehood and greed.<br>
  The True King, the Primal Lord God, kills him when He sees what he has done.<br>
  The Messenger of Death sees him, and he rots away in pain.<br>
  Even-handed justice is administered, O Nanak, in the Court of the True Lord. ||15||<br>

  In the early hours of the morning, chant the Name of God, and meditate on the Feet of the Guru.<br>
  The filth of birth and death is erased, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||1||<br>

  He Himself is saved, along with his family, and all the world is saved as well.<br>
  He collects the wealth of the Lord's Name, and all his thirst is quenched.<br>
  He renounces worldly greed, and his inner being is lovingly attuned to the Lord.<br>
  Forever and ever, the home of his heart is filled with bliss; the Lord is his companion, help and support.<br>
  He looks alike upon enemy and friend, and wishes well to all.<br>
  He alone is fulfilled in this world, who meditates on the spiritual wisdom of the Guru.<br>
  He obtains what is pre-ordained for him, according to the Lord. ||16||<br>
  Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The true person is said to be beautiful; false is the reputation of the false.<br>
  O Nanak, rare are those who have Truth in their laps. ||1||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The face of my friend, the Lord, is incomparably beautiful; I would watch Him, twenty-four hours a day.<br>
  In sleep, I saw my Husband Lord; I am a sacrifice to that dream. ||2||<br>

  Fasts, calls to prayer and sacred scriptures - without understanding, all these shall vanish.<br>

  The One True Lord God is eternal and unchanging. The Lord's slave is also eternal. ||17||<br>

  The lover is without hope, but within my mind, there is great hope.<br>
  In the midst of hope, only You, O Lord, remain free of hope; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||2||<br>

  The One and only Lord is eternal, imperishable, inaccessible and incomprehensible.<br>
  The treasure of the Naam is eternal and imperishable. Meditating in remembrance on Him, the Lord is attained.<br>

  Truth, righteousness, Dharma and intense meditation are eternal and imperishable. Day and night, worship the Lord in adoration.<br>
  Compassion, righteousness, Dharma and intense meditation are eternal and imperishable; they alone obtain these, who have such pre-ordained destiny.<br>
  The inscription inscribed upon one's forehead is eternal and imperishable; it cannot be avoided by avoidance.<br>

  With my eyes, I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; I touch my forehead to the Guru's feet.<br>

  I meditate on Akaal Moorat, the undying form, within my heart; day and night, I meditate on Him.<br>
  I have renounced all possessiveness, and have placed my faith in the all-powerful Guru.<br>
  The Guru has blessed me with the treasure of the Naam; I am rid of all sufferings.<br>

  The ponds and the lands are overflowing with water, and the cold wind is blowing.<br>
  Her bed is adorned with gold, diamonds and rubies;<br>
  she is blessed with beautiful gowns and delicacies, O Nanak, but without her Beloved, she burns in agony. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He does the dees which the Creator causes him to do.<br>
  Even if you run in hundreds of directions, O mortal, you shall still receive what you are pre-destined to receive.<br>
  Without good karma, you shall obtain nothing, even if you wander across the whole world.<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, you shall know the Fear of God, and other fears shall be taken away.<br>
  Through the Fear of God, the attitude of detachment wells up, and one sets out in search of the Lord.<br>
  Searching and searching, intuitive wisdom wells up, and then, one is not born to die again.<br>
  Practicing meditation within my heart, I have found the Sanctuary of the Holy.<br>
  Whoever the Lord places on the boat of Guru Nanak, is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||22||<br>

  Your worth cannot be estimated, O True, Unmoving Lord God.<br>
  The Siddhas, seekers, spiritual teachers and meditators - who among them can measure You?<br>
  You are all-powerful, to form and break; You create and destroy all.<br>
  You are all-powerful to act, and inspire all to act; You speak through each and every heart.<br>
  You give sustanance to all; why should mankind waver?<br>
  You are deep, profound and unfathomable; Your virtuous spiritual wisdom is priceless.<br>
  They do the deeds which they are pre-ordained to do.<br>
  Without You, there is nothing at all; Nanak chants Your Glorious Praises. ||23||1||2||<br>
  Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  O Pandit, O religious scholar, in what foul thoughts are you engaged?<br>
  You shall be drowned, along with your family, if you do not meditate on the Lord, you unfortunate person. ||1||Pause||<br>
  What is the use of reading the Vedas and the Puraanas? It is like loading a donkey with sandalwood.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 115</h2></center>
  You do not know the exalted state of the Lord's Name; how will you ever cross over? ||1||<br>
  You kill living beings, and call it a righteous action. Tell me, brother, what would you call an unrighteous action?<br>
  You call yourself the most excellent sage; then who would you call a butcher? ||2||<br>
  You are blind in your mind, and do not understand your own self; how can you make others understand, O brother?<br>
  For the sake of Maya and money, you sell knowledge; your life is totally worthless. ||3||<br>
  Naarad and Vyaasa say these things; go and ask Suk Dayv as well.<br>
  Says Kabeer, chanting the Lord's Name, you shall be saved; otherwise, you shall drown, brother. ||4||1||<br>
  Living in the forest, how will you find Him? Not until you remove corruption from your mind.<br>
  Those who look alike upon home and forest, are the most perfect people in the world. ||1||<br>
  You shall find real peace in the Lord,<br>
  if you lovingly dwell on the Lord within your being. ||1||Pause||<br>
  What is the use of wearing matted hair, smearing the body with ashes, and living in a cave?<br>
  Conquering the mind, one conquers the world, and then remains detached from corruption. ||2||<br>
  They all apply make-up to their eyes; there is little difference between their objectives.<br>
  But those eyes, to which the ointment of spiritual wisdom is applied, are approved and supreme. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, now I know my Lord; the Guru has blessed me with spiritual wisdom.<br>
  I have met the Lord, and I am emancipated within; now, my mind does not wander at all. ||4||2||<br>
  You have riches and miraculous spiritual powers; so what business do you have with anyone else?<br>
  What should I say about the reality of your talk? I am embarrassed even to speak to you. ||1||<br>
  One who has found the Lord,<br>
  does not wander from door to door. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The false world wanders all around, in hopes of finding wealth to use for a few days.<br>
  That humble being, who drinks in the Lord's water, never becomes thirsty again. ||2||<br>
  Whoever understands, by Guru's Grace, becomes free of hope in the midst of hope.<br>
  One comes to see the Lord everywhere, when the soul becomes detached. ||3||<br>
  I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord's Name; the Lord's Name carries everyone across.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have become like gold; doubt is dispelled, and I have crossed over the world-ocean. ||4||3||<br>
  Like drops of water in the water of the ocean, and like waves in the stream, I merge in the Lord.<br>
  Merging my being into the Absolute Being of God, I have become impartial and transparent, like the air. ||1||<br>
  Why should I come into the world again?<br>
  Coming and going is by the Hukam of His Command; realizing His Hukam, I shall merge in Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When the body, formed of the five elements, perishes, then any such doubts shall end.<br>
  Giving up the different schools of philosophy, I look upon all equally; I meditate only on the One Name. ||2||<br>
  Whatever I am attached to, to that I am attached; such are the deeds I do.<br>
  When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, then I am merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||<br>
  Die while yet alive, and by so dying, be alive; thus you shall not be reborn again.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 116</h2></center>
  Says Kabeer, whoever is absorbed in the Naam remains lovingly absorbed in the Primal, Absolute Lord. ||4||4||<br>
  If You keep me far away from You, then tell me, what is liberation?<br>
  The One has many forms, and is contained within all; how can I be fooled now? ||1||<br>
  O Lord, where will You take me, to save me?<br>
  Tell me where, and what sort of liberation shall You give me? By Your Grace, I have already obtained it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  People talk of salvation and being saved, as long as they do not understand the essence of reality.<br>
  I have now become pure within my heart, says Kabeer, and my mind is pleased and appeased. ||2||5||<br>
  Raawan made castles and fortresses of gold, but he had to abandon them when he left. ||1||<br>
  Why do you act only to please your mind?<br>
  When Death comes and grabs you by the hair, then only the Name of the Lord will save you. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Death, and deathlessness are the creations of our Lord and Master; this show, this expanse, is only an entanglement.<br>
  Says Kabeer, those who have the sublime essence of the Lord in their hearts - in the end, they are liberated. ||2||6||<br>
  The body is a village, and the soul is the owner and farmer; the five farm-hands live there.<br>
  The eyes, nose, ears, tongue and sensory organs of touch do not obey any order. ||1||<br>
  O father, now I shall not live in this village.<br>
  The accountants summoned Chitar and Gupat, the recording scribes of the conscious and the unconscious, to ask for an account of each and every moment. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for my account, there shall be a very heavy balance against me.<br>
  The five farm-hands shall then run away, and the bailiff shall arrest the soul. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: settle your accounts in this farm.<br>
  O Lord, please forgive Your slave now, in this life, so that he may not have to return again to this terrifying world-ocean. ||3||7||<br>
  Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  No one has seen the Fearless Lord, O renunciate.<br>
  Without the Fear of God, how can the Fearless Lord be obtained? ||1||<br>
  If one sees the Presence of his Husband Lord near at hand, then he feels the Fear of God, O renunciate.<br>
  If he realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then he becomes fearless. ||2||<br>
  Don't practice hypocrisy with the Lord, O renunciate!<br>
  The whole world is filled with hypocrisy. ||3||<br>
  Thirst and desire do not just go away, O renunciate.<br>
  The body is burning in the fire of worldly love and attachment. ||4||<br>
  Anxiety is burned, and the body is burned, O renunciate,<br>
  only if one lets his mind become dead. ||5||<br>
  Without the True Guru, there can be no renunciation,<br>
  even though all the people may wish for it. ||6||<br>
  When God grants His Grace, one meets the True Guru, O renunciate,<br>
  and automatically, intuitively finds that Lord. ||7||<br>
  Says Kabeer, I offer this one prayer, O renunciate.<br>
  Carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||8||1||8||<br>

  Gazing upon your elephants, you have gone astray in doubt; you do not know the Great Lord God.<br>
  I judge Bidur's water to be like ambrosial nectar, in comparison with your milk. ||1||<br>
  I find his rough vegetables to be like rice pudding; the night of my life passes singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Kabeer's Lord and Master is joyous and blissful; He does not care about anyone's social class. ||2||9||<br>
  Shalok, Kabeer:<br>
  The battle-drum beats in the sky of the mind; aim is taken, and the wound is inflicted.<br>
  The spiritual warriors enter the field of battle; now is the time to fight! ||1||<br>
  He alone is known as a spiritual hero, who fights in defense of religion.<br>
  He may be cut apart, piece by piece, but he never leaves the field of battle. ||2||2||<br>
  Shabad Of Kabeer, Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I have obtained the four kinds of liberation, and the four miraculous spiritual powers, in the Sanctuary of God, my Husband Lord.<br>
  I am liberated, and famous throughout the four ages; the canopy of praise and fame waves over my head. ||1||<br>
  Meditating on the Sovereign Lord God, who has not been saved?<br>
  Whoever follows the Guru's Teachings and joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is called the most devoted of the devotees. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He is adorned with the conch, the chakra, the mala and the ceremonial tilak mark on his forehead; gazing upon his radiant glory, the Messenger of Death is scared away.<br>
  He becomes fearless, and the power of the Lord thunders through him; the pains of birth and death are taken away. ||2||<br>
  The Lord blessed Ambreek with fearless dignity, and elevated Bhabhikhan to become king.<br>
  Sudama's Lord and Master blessed him with the nine treasures; he made Dhroo permanent and unmoving; as the north star, he still hasn't moved. ||3||<br>
  For the sake of His devotee Prahlaad, God assumed the form of the man-lion, and killed Harnaakhash.<br>
  Says Naam Dayv, the beautiful-haired Lord is in the power of His devotees; He is standing at Balraja's door, even now! ||4||1||<br>
  Maaroo, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  You have forgotten your religion, O madman; you have forgotten your religion.<br>
  You fill your belly, and sleep like an animal; you have wasted and lost this human life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You never joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. You are engrossed in false pursuits.<br>
  You wander like a dog, a pig, a crow; soon, you shall have to get up and leave. ||1||<br>
  You believe that you yourself are great, and that others are small.<br>
  Those who are false in thought, word and deed, I have seen them going to hell. ||2||<br>
  The lustful, the angry, the clever, the deceitful and the lazy<br>
  waste their lives in slander, and never remember their Lord in meditation. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, the fools, the idiots and the brutes do not remember the Lord.<br>
  They do not know the Lord's Name; how can they be carried across? ||4||1||<br>

  Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Jai Dayv Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The breath is drawn in through the left nostril; it is held in the central channel of the Sushmanaa, and exhaled through the right nostril, repeating the Lord's Name sixteen times.<br>
  I am powerless; my power has been broken. My unstable mind has been stabliized, and my unadorned soul has been adorned. I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||<br>
  Within my mind, I chant the Name of the Primal Lord God, the Source of virtue.<br>
  My vision, that You are I are separate, has melted away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I worship the One who is worthy of being worshipped. I trust the One who is worthy of being trusted. Like water merging in water, I merge in the Lord.<br>
  Says Jai Dayv, I meditate and contemplate the Luminous, Triumphant Lord. I am lovingly absorbed in the Nirvaanaa of God. ||2||1||<br>
  Kabeer, Maaroo:<br>
  Meditate in remembrance on the Lord, or else you will regret it in the end, O mind.<br>
  O sinful soul, you act in greed, but today or tomorrow, you will have to get up and leave. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Clinging to greed, you have wasted your life, deluded in the doubt of Maya.<br>
  Do not take pride in your wealth and youth; you shall crumble apart like dry paper. ||1||<br>
  When the Messenger of Death comes and grabs you by the hair, and knocks you down, on that day, you shall be powerless.<br>
  You do not remember the Lord, or vibrate upon Him in meditation, and you do not practice compassion; you shall be beaten on your face. ||2||<br>
  When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for your account, what face will you show Him then?<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be saved. ||3||1||<br>
  Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  O Love, who else but You could do such a thing?<br>
  O Patron of the poor, Lord of the World, You have put the canopy of Your Grace over my head. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Only You can grant Mercy to that person whose touch pollutes the world.<br>
  You exalt and elevate the lowly, O my Lord of the Universe; You are not afraid of anyone. ||1||<br>
  Naam Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan, Sadhana and Sain crossed over.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, listen, O Saints, through the Dear Lord, all is accomplished. ||2||1||<br>
  MAAROO:<br>
  The Lord is the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life, the jewel of miracles and the wish-fulfilling cow are all under His power.<br>
  The four great blessings, the eight great miraculous spiritual powers and the nine treasures are in the palm of His hand. ||1||<br>
  Why don't you chant the Lord's Name, Har, Har, Har?<br>
  Abandon all other devices of words. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The many epics, the Puraanas and the Vedas are all composed out of the letters of the alphabet.<br>
  After careful thought, Vyaasa spoke the supreme truth, that there is nothing equal to the Lord's Name. ||2||<br>
  In intuitive Samaadhi, their troubles are eliminated; the very fortunate ones lovingly focus on the Lord.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, the Lord's slave remains detached from the world; the fear of birth and death runs away from his mind. ||3||2||15||<br>
