 <hr><center><h1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Gauree</h1></center>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 001</h2></center>
  Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl, Chau-Padas &amp; Du-Padas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  The Fear of God is overpowering, and so very heavy,<br>
  while the intellect is lightweight, as is the speech one speaks.<br>
  So place the Fear of God upon your head, and bear that weight;<br>
  by the Grace of the Merciful Lord, contemplate the Guru. ||1||<br>
  Without the Fear of God, no one crosses over the world-ocean.<br>
  This Fear of God adorns the Love of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The fire of fear within the body is burnt away by the Fear of God.<br>
  Through this Fear of God, we are adorned with the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Without the Fear of God, all that is fashioned is false.<br>
  Useless is the mold, and useless are the hammer-strokes on the mold. ||2||<br>
  The desire for the worldly drama arises in the intellect,<br>
  but even with thousands of clever mental tricks, the heat of the Fear of God does not come into play.<br>
  O Nanak, the speech of the self-willed manmukh is just wind.<br>
  His words are worthless and empty, like the wind. ||3||1||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  Place the Fear of God within the home of your heart; with this Fear of God in your heart, all other fears shall be frightened away.<br>
  What sort of fear is that, which frightens other fears?<br>
  Without You, I have other place of rest at all.<br>
  Whatever happens is all according to Your Will. ||1||<br>
  Be afraid, if you have any fear, other than the Fear of God.<br>
  Afraid of fear, and living in fear, the mind is held in tumult. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The soul does not die; it does not drown, and it does not swim across.<br>
  The One who created everything does everything.<br>
  By the Hukam of His Command we come, and by the Hukam of His Command we go.<br>
  Before and after, His Command is pervading. ||2||<br>
  Cruelty, attachment, desire and egotism<br>
  - there is great hunger in these, like the raging torrent of a wild stream.<br>
  Let the Fear of God be your food, drink and support.<br>
  Without doing this, the fools simply die. ||3||<br>
  If anyone really has anyone else - how rare is that person!<br>
  All are Yours - You are the Lord of all.<br>
  All beings and creatures, wealth and property belong to Him.<br>
  O Nanak, it is so difficult to describe and contemplate Him. ||4||2||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  Let wisdom be your mother, and contentment your father.<br>
  Let Truth be your brother - these are your best relatives. ||1||<br>
  He has been described, but He cannot be described at all.<br>
  Your All-pervading creative nature cannot be estimated. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 002</h2></center>
  Modesty, humility and intuitive understanding are my mother-in-law and father-in-law;<br>
  I have made good deeds my spouse. ||2||<br>
  Union with the Holy is my wedding date, and separation from the world is my marriage.<br>
  Says Nanak, Truth is the child born of this Union. ||3||3||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  The union of air, water and fire<br>
  - the body is the play-thing of the fickle and unsteady intellect.<br>
  It has nine doors, and then there is the Tenth Gate.<br>
  Reflect upon this and understand it, O wise one. ||1||<br>
  The Lord is the One who speaks, teaches and listens.<br>
  One who contemplates his own self is truly wise. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The body is dust; the wind speaks through it.<br>
  Understand, O wise one, who has died.<br>
  Awareness, conflict and ego have died,<br>
  but the One who sees does not die. ||2||<br>
  For the sake of it, you journey to sacred shrines and holy rivers;<br>
  but this priceless jewel is within your own heart.<br>
  The Pandits, the religious scholars, read and read endlessly; they stir up arguments and controversies,<br>
  but they do not know the secret deep within. ||3||<br>
  I have not died - that evil nature within me has died.<br>
  The One who is pervading everywhere does not die.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has revealed God to me,<br>
  and now I see that there is no such thing as birth or death. ||4||4||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl, Dakhanee:<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to the one who listens and hears, who understands and believes in the Name.<br>
  When the Lord Himself leads us astray, there is no other place of rest for us to find.<br>
  You impart understanding, and You unite us in Your Union. ||1||<br>
  I obtain the Naam, which shall go along with me in the end.<br>
  Without the Name, all are held in the grip of Death. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My farming and my trading are by the Support of the Name.<br>
  The seeds of sin and virtue are bound together.<br>
  Sexual desire and anger are the wounds of the soul.<br>
  The evil-minded ones forget the Naam, and then depart. ||2||<br>
  True are the Teachings of the True Guru.<br>
  The body and mind are cooled and soothed, by the touchstone of Truth.<br>
  This is the true mark of wisdom: that one remains detached, like the water-lily, or the lotus upon the water.<br>
  Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, one becomes sweet, like the juice of the sugar cane. ||3||<br>
  By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, the castle of the body has ten gates.<br>
  The five passions dwell there, together with the Divine Light of the Infinite.<br>
  The Lord Himself is the merchandise, and He Himself is the trader.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, we are adorned and rejuvenated. ||4||5||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  How can we know where we came from?<br>
  Where did we originate, and where will we go and merge?<br>
  How are we bound, and how do we obtain liberation?<br>
  How do we merge with intuitive ease into the Eternal, Imperishable Lord? ||1||<br>
  With the Naam in the heart and the Ambrosial Naam on our lips,<br>
  through the Name of the Lord, we rise above desire, like the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  With intuitive ease we come, and with intuitive ease we depart.<br>
  From the mind we originate, and into the mind we are absorbed.<br>
  As Gurmukh, we are liberated, and are not bound.<br>
  Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, we are emancipated through the Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  At night, lots of birds settle on the tree.<br>
  Some are happy, and some are sad. Caught in the desires of the mind, they perish.<br>
  And when the life-night comes to its end, then they look to the sky.<br>
  They fly away in all ten directions, according to their pre-ordained destiny. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 003</h2></center>
  Those who are committed to the Naam, see the world as merely a temporary pasture.<br>
  Sexual desire and anger are broken, like a jar of poison.<br>
  Without the merchandise of the Name, the house of the body and the store of the mind are empty.<br>
  Meeting the Guru, the hard and heavy doors are opened. ||4||<br>
  One meets the Holy Saint only through perfect destiny.<br>
  The Lord's perfect people rejoice in the Truth.<br>
  Surrendering their minds and bodies, they find the Lord with intuitive ease.<br>
  Nanak falls at their feet. ||5||6||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  The conscious mind is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and Maya.<br>
  The conscious mind is awake only to falsehood, corruption and attachment.<br>
  It gathers in the assets of sin and greed.<br>
  So swim across the river of life, O my mind, with the Sacred Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Waaho! Waaho! - Great! Great is my True Lord! I seek Your All-powerful Support.<br>
  I am a sinner - You alone are pure. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Fire and water join together, and the breath roars in its fury!<br>
  The tongue and the sex organs each seek to taste.<br>
  The eyes which look upon corruption do not know the Love and the Fear of God.<br>
  Conquering self-conceit, one obtains the Name. ||2||<br>
  One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, shall never again have to die.<br>
  Without such a death, how can one attain perfection?<br>
  The mind is engrossed in deception, treachery and duality.<br>
  Whatever the Immortal Lord does, comes to pass. ||3||<br>
  So get aboard that boat when your turn comes.<br>
  Those who fail to embark upon that boat shall be beaten in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Blessed is that Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, where the Praises of the True Lord are sung.<br>
  O Nanak, the One Creator Lord is pervading hearth and home. ||4||7||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  The inverted heart-lotus has been turned upright, through reflective meditation on God.<br>
  From the Sky of the Tenth Gate, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down.<br>
  The Lord Himself is pervading the three worlds. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, do not give in to doubt.<br>
  When the mind surrenders to the Name, it drinks in the essence of Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||<br>
  So win the game of life; let your mind surrender and accept death.<br>
  When the self dies, the individual mind comes to know the Supreme Mind.<br>
  As the inner vision is awakened, one comes to know one's own home, deep within the self. ||2||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is austerity, chastity and cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  What good are ostentatious displays?<br>
  The All-pervading Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||3||<br>
  If I had faith in someone else, then I would go to that one's house.<br>
  But where should I go, to beg? There is no other place for me.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, I am intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||4||8||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, we are shown the way to die.<br>
  Remaining alive in this death brings joy deep within.<br>
  Overcoming egotistical pride, the Tenth Gate is found. ||1||<br>
  Death is pre-ordained - no one who comes can remain here.<br>
  So chant and meditate on the Lord, and remain in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, duality is dispelled.<br>
  The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and the mind is attached to the Lord God.<br>
  One who remains dead while yet alive obtains the greatest happiness hereafter. ||2||<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, one becomes truthful, chaste and pure.<br>
  Climbing up the steps of the Guru's Path, one becomes the highest of the high.<br>
  When the Lord grants His Mercy, the fear of death is conquered. ||3||<br>
  Uniting in Guru's Union, we are absorbed in His Loving Embrace.<br>
  Granting His Grace, He reveals the Mansion of His Presence, within the home of the self.<br>
  O Nanak, conquering egotism, we are absorbed into the Lord. ||4||9||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 004</h2></center>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  Past actions cannot be erased.<br>
  What do we know of what will happen hereafter?<br>
  Whatever pleases Him shall come to pass.<br>
  There is no other Doer except Him. ||1||<br>
  I do not know about karma, or how great Your gifts are.<br>
  The karma of actions, the Dharma of righteousness, social class and status, are contained within Your Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are So Great, O Giver, O Great Giver!<br>
  The treasure of Your devotional worship is never exhausted.<br>
  One who takes pride in himself shall never be right.<br>
  The soul and body are all at Your disposal. ||2||<br>
  You kill and rejuvenate. You forgive and merge us into Yourself.<br>
  As it pleases You, You inspire us to chant Your Name.<br>
  You are All-knowing, All-seeing and True, O my Supreme Lord.<br>
  Please, bless me with the Guru's Teachings; my faith is in You alone. ||3||<br>
  One whose mind is attuned to the Lord, has no pollution in his body.<br>
  Through the Guru's Word, the True Shabad is realized.<br>
  All Power is Yours, through the greatness of Your Name.<br>
  Nanak abides in the Sanctuary of Your devotees. ||4||10||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  Those who speak the Unspoken, drink in the Nectar.<br>
  Other fears are forgotten, and they are absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Why should we fear, when fear is dispelled by the Fear of God?<br>
  Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, I recognize God. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord's essence are blessed and acclaimed, and intuitively absorbed into the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Those whom the Lord puts to sleep, evening and morning<br>
  - those self-willed manmukhs are bound and gagged by Death, here and hereafter. ||3||<br>
  Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord, day and night, are perfect.<br>
  O Nanak, they merge into the Lord, and their doubts are cast away. ||4||11||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  One who loves the three qualities is subject to birth and death.<br>
  The four Vedas speak only of the visible forms.<br>
  They describe and explain the three states of mind,<br>
  but the fourth state, union with the Lord, is known only through the True Guru. ||1||<br>
  Through devotional worship of the Lord, and service to the Guru, one swims across.<br>
  Then, one is not born again, and is not subject to death. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Everyone speaks of the four great blessings;<br>
  the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Pandits speak of them as well.<br>
  But without the Guru, they do not understand their true significance.<br>
  The treasure of liberation is obtained through devotional worship of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Those, within whose hearts the Lord dwells,<br>
  become Gurmukh; they receive the blessings of devotional worship.<br>
  Through devotional worship of the Lord, liberation and bliss are obtained.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, supreme ecstasy is obtained. ||3||<br>
  One who meets the Guru, beholds Him, and inspires others to behold Him as well.<br>
  In the midst of hope, the Guru teaches us to live above hope and desire.<br>
  He is the Master of the meek, the Giver of peace to all.<br>
  Nanak's mind is imbued with the Lotus Feet of the Lord. ||4||12||<br>
  Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:<br>
  With your nectar-like body, you live in comfort, but this world is just a passing drama.<br>
  You practice greed, avarice and great falsehood, and you carry such a heavy burden.<br>
  O body, I have seen you blowing away like dust on the earth. ||1||<br>
  Listen - listen to my advice!<br>
  Only the good deeds which you have done shall remain with you, O my soul. This opportunity shall not come again! ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 005</h2></center>
  I say to you, O my body: listen to my advice!<br>
  You slander, and then praise others; you indulge in lies and gossip.<br>
  You gaze upon the wives of others, O my soul; you steal and commit evil deeds.<br>
  But when the swan departs, you shall remain behind, like an abandoned woman. ||2||<br>
  O body, you are living in a dream! What good deeds have you done?<br>
  When I stole something by deception, then my mind was pleased.<br>
  I have no honor in this world, and I shall find no shelter in the world hereafter. My life has been lost, wasted in vain! ||3||<br>
  I am totally miserable! O Baba Nanak, no one cares for me at all! ||1||Pause||<br>
  Turkish horses, gold, silver and loads of gorgeous clothes<br>
  - none of these shall go with you, O Nanak. They are lost and left behind, you fool!<br>
  I have tasted all the sugar candy and sweets, but Your Name alone is Ambrosial Nectar. ||4||<br>
  Digging deep foundations, the walls are constructed, but in the end, the buildings return to heaps of dust.<br>
  People gather and hoard their possessions, and give nothing to anyone else - the poor fools think that everything is theirs.<br>
  Riches do not remain with anyone - not even the golden palaces of Sri Lanka. ||5||<br>
  Listen, you foolish and ignorant mind<br>
  - only His Will prevails. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My Banker is the Great Lord and Master. I am only His petty merchant.<br>
  This soul and body all are His. He Himself kills, and brings back to life. ||6||1||13||<br>
  Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:<br>
  There are five of them, but I am all alone. How can I protect my hearth and home, O my mind?<br>
  They are beating and plundering me over and over again; unto whom can I complain? ||1||<br>
  Chant the Name of the Supreme Lord, O my mind.<br>
  Otherwise, in the world hereafter, you will have to face the awesome and cruel army of Death. ||1||Pause||<br>
  God has erected the temple of the body; He has placed the nine doors, and the soul-bride sits within.<br>
  She enjoys the sweet play again and again, while the five demons are plundering her. ||2||<br>
  In this way, the temple is being demolished; the body is being plundered, and the soul-bride, left all alone, is captured.<br>
  Death strikes her down with his rod, the shackles are placed around her neck, and now the five have left. ||3||<br>
  The wife yearns for gold and silver, and her friends, the senses, yearn for good food.<br>
  O Nanak, she commits sins for their sake; she shall go, bound and gagged, to the City of Death. ||4||2||14||<br>
  Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:<br>
  Let your ear-rings be those ear-rings which pierce deep within your heart. Let your body be your patched coat.<br>
  Let the five passions be disciples under your control, O begging Yogi, and make this mind your walking stick. ||1||<br>
  Thus you shall find the Way of Yoga.<br>
  There is only the One Word of the Shabad; everything else shall pass away. Let this be the fruits and roots of your mind's diet. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Some try to find the Guru by shaving their heads at the Ganges, but I have made the Guru my Ganges.<br>
  The Saving Grace of the three worlds is the One Lord and Master, but those in darkness do not remember Him. ||2||<br>
  Practicing hypocrisy and attaching your mind to worldly objects, your doubt shall never depart.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 006</h2></center>
  If you focus your consciousness on the Feet of the One Lord, what reason would you have to chase after greed? ||3||<br>
  Meditate on the Immaculate Lord, and saturate your mind with Him.<br>
  Why, O Yogi, do you make so many false and deceptive claims? ||1||Pause||<br>
  The body is wild, and the mind is foolish. Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, your life is passing away.<br>
  Prays Nanak, when the naked body is cremated, then you will come to regret and repent. ||4||3||15||<br>
  Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:<br>
  O mind, there is only the One medicine, mantra and healing herb - center your consciousness firmly on the One Lord.<br>
  Take to the Lord, the Destroyer of the sins and karma of past incarnations. ||1||<br>
  The One Lord and Master is pleasing to my mind.<br>
  In Your three qualities, the world is engrossed; the Unknowable cannot be known. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Maya is so sweet to the body, like sugar or molasses. We all carry loads of it.<br>
  In the dark of the night, nothing can be seen. The mouse of death is gnawing away at the rope of life, O Siblings of Destiny! ||2||<br>
  As the self-willed manmukhs act, they suffer in pain. The Gurmukh obtains honor and greatness.<br>
  Whatever He does, that alone happens; past actions cannot be erased. ||3||<br>
  Those who are imbued with, and committed to the Lord's Love, are filled to overflowing; they never lack anything.<br>
  If Nanak could be the dust of their feet, then he, the ignorant one, might also obtain some. ||4||4||16||<br>
  Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:<br>
  Who is our mother, and who is our father? Where did we come from?<br>
  We are formed from the fire of the womb within, and the bubble of water of the sperm. For what purpose are we created? ||1||<br>
  O my Master, who can know Your Glorious Virtues?<br>
  My own demerits cannot be counted. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I took the form of so many plants and trees, and so many animals.<br>
  Many times I entered the families of snakes and flying birds. ||2||<br>
  I broke into the shops of the city and well-guarded palaces; stealing from them, I snuck home again.<br>
  I looked in front of me, and I looked behind me, but where could I hide from You? ||3||<br>
  I saw the banks of sacred rivers, the nine continents, the shops and bazaars of the cities.<br>
  Taking the scale, the merchant begins to weigh his actions within his own heart. ||4||<br>
  As the seas and the oceans are overflowing with water, so vast are my own sins.<br>
  Please, shower me with Your Mercy, and take pity upon me. I am a sinking stone - please carry me across! ||5||<br>
  My soul is burning like fire, and the knife is cutting deep.<br>
  Prays Nanak, recognizing the Lord's Command, I am at peace, day and night. ||6||5||17||<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan, First Mehl:<br>
  The nights are wasted sleeping, and the days are wasted eating.<br>
  Human life is such a precious jewel, but it is being lost in exchange for a mere shell. ||1||<br>
  You do not know the Name of the Lord.<br>
  You fool - you shall regret and repent in the end! ||1||Pause||<br>
  You bury your temporary wealth in the ground, but how can you love that which is temporary?<br>
  Those who have departed, after craving for temporary wealth, have returned home without this temporary wealth. ||2||<br>
  If people could gather it in by their own efforts, then everyone would be so lucky.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 007</h2></center>
  According to the karma of past actions, one's destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, the One who created the creation - He alone takes care of it.<br>
  The Hukam of our Lord and Master's Command cannot be known; He Himself blesses us with greatness. ||4||1||18||<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan, First Mehl:<br>
  What if I were to become a deer, and live in the forest, picking and eating fruits and roots<br>
  - by Guru's Grace, I am a sacrifice to my Master. Again and again, I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice. ||1||<br>
  I am the shop-keeper of the Lord.<br>
  Your Name is my merchandise and trade. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If I were to become a cuckoo, living in a mango tree, I would still contemplate the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  I would still meet my Lord and Master, with intuitive ease; the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of His Form, is incomparably beautiful. ||2||<br>
  If I were to become a fish, living in the water, I would still remember the Lord, who watches over all beings and creatures.<br>
  My Husband Lord dwells on this shore, and on the shore beyond; I would still meet Him, and hug Him close in my embrace. ||3||<br>
  If I were to become a snake, living in the ground, the Shabad would still dwell in my mind, and my fears would be dispelled.<br>
  O Nanak, they are forever the happy soul-brides, whose light merges into His Light. ||4||2||19||<br>
  Gauree Poorbee Deepkee, First Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  In that house where the Praises of the Creator are chanted<br>
  - in that house, sing the Songs of Praise, and meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord. ||1||<br>
  Sing the Songs of Praise of my Fearless Lord.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to that Song of Praise which brings eternal peace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Day after day, He cares for His beings; the Great Giver watches over all.<br>
  Your gifts cannot be appraised; how can anyone compare to the Giver? ||2||<br>
  The day of my wedding is pre-ordained. Come - let's gather together and pour the oil over the threshold.<br>
  My friends, give me your blessings, that I may merge with my Lord and Master. ||3||<br>
  Unto each and every home, into each and every heart, this summons is sent out; the call comes each and every day.<br>
  Remember in meditation the One who summons us; O Nanak, that day is drawing near! ||4||1||20||<br>
  Raag Gauree Gwaarayree:<br>
  Third Mehl, Chau-Padas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Meeting the Guru, we meet the Lord.<br>
  He Himself unites us in His Union.<br>
  My God knows all His Own Ways.<br>
  By the Hukam of His Command, He unites those who recognize the Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  By the Fear of the True Guru, doubt and fear are dispelled.<br>
  Imbued with His Fear, we are absorbed in the Love of the True One. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meeting the Guru, the Lord naturally dwells within the mind.<br>
  My God is Great and Almighty; His value cannot be estimated.<br>
  Through the Shabad, I praise Him; He has no end or limitations.<br>
  My God is the Forgiver. I pray that He may forgive me. ||2||<br>
  Meeting the Guru, all wisdom and understanding are obtained.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 008</h2></center>
  The mind becomes pure, when the True Lord dwells within.<br>
  When one dwells in Truth, all actions become true.<br>
  The ultimate action is to contemplate the Word of the Shabad. ||3||<br>
  Through the Guru, true service is performed.<br>
  How rare is that Gurmukh who recognizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Giver, the Great Giver, lives forever.<br>
  Nanak enshrines love for the Name of the Lord. ||4||1||21||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who obtain spiritual wisdom from the Guru are very rare.<br>
  Those who obtain this understanding from the Guru become acceptable.<br>
  Through the Guru, we intuitively contemplate the True One.<br>
  Through the Guru, the Gate of Liberation is found. ||1||<br>
  Through perfect good destiny, we come to meet the Guru.<br>
  The true ones are intuitively absorbed in the True Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meeting the Guru, the fire of desire is quenched.<br>
  Through the Guru, peace and tranquility come to dwell within the mind.<br>
  Through the Guru, we become pure, holy and true.<br>
  Through the Guru, we are absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<br>
  Without the Guru, everyone wanders in doubt.<br>
  Without the Name, they suffer in terrible pain.<br>
  Those who meditate on the Naam become Gurmukh.<br>
  True honor is obtained through the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the True Lord. ||3||<br>
  Why speak of any other? He alone is the Giver.<br>
  When He grants His Grace, union with the Shabad is obtained.<br>
  Meeting with my Beloved, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, becoming true, I am absorbed in the True One. ||4||2||22||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  True is that place, where the mind becomes pure.<br>
  True is the one who abides in Truth.<br>
  The True Bani of the Word is known throughout the four ages.<br>
  The True One Himself is everything. ||1||<br>
  Through the karma of good actions, one joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<br>
  Sing the Glories of the Lord, sitting in that place. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Burn this tongue, which loves duality,<br>
  which does not taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and which utters insipid words.<br>
  Without understanding, the body and mind become tasteless and insipid.<br>
  Without the Name, the miserable ones depart crying out in pain. ||2||<br>
  One whose tongue naturally and intuitively tastes the Lord's sublime essence, by Guru's Grace, is absorbed in the True Lord.<br>
  Imbued with Truth, one contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad,<br>
  and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, from the immaculate stream within. ||3||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is collected in the vessel of the mind.<br>
  Nothing is collected if the vessel is upside-down.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Naam abides within the mind.<br>
  O Nanak, True is that vessel of the mind, which thirsts for the Shabad. ||4||3||23||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Some sing on and on, but their minds do not find happiness.<br>
  In egotism, they sing, but it is wasted uselessly.<br>
  Those who love the Naam, sing the song.<br>
  They contemplate the True Bani of the Word, and the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  They sing on and on, if it pleases the True Guru.<br>
  Their minds and bodies are embellished and adorned, attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Some sing, and some perform devotional worship.<br>
  Without heart-felt love, the Naam is not obtained.<br>
  True devotional worship consists of love for the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  The devotee keeps his Beloved clasped tightly to his heart. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 009</h2></center>
  The fools perform devotional worship by showing off;<br>
  they dance and dance and jump all around, but they only suffer in terrible pain.<br>
  By dancing and jumping, devotional worship is not performed.<br>
  But one who dies in the Word of the Shabad, obtains devotional worship. ||3||<br>
  The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He inspires them to perform devotional worship.<br>
  True devotional worship consists of eliminating selfishness and conceit from within.<br>
  My True God knows all ways and means.<br>
  O Nanak, He forgives those who recognize the Naam. ||4||4||24||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  When someone kills and subdues his own mind, his wandering nature is also subdued.<br>
  Without such a death, how can one find the Lord?<br>
  Only a few know the medicine to kill the mind.<br>
  One whose mind dies in the Word of the Shabad, understands Him. ||1||<br>
  He grants greatness to those whom He forgives.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Gurmukh practices doing good deeds;<br>
  thus he comes to understand this mind.<br>
  The mind is like an elephant, drunk with wine.<br>
  The Guru is the rod which controls it, and shows it the way. ||2||<br>
  The mind is uncontrollable; how rare are those who subdue it.<br>
  Those who move the immovable become pure.<br>
  The Gurmukhs embellish and beautify this mind.<br>
  They eradicate egotism and corruption from within. ||3||<br>
  Those who, by pre-ordained destiny, are united in the Lord's Union,<br>
  are never separated from Him again; they are absorbed in the Shabad.<br>
  He Himself knows His Own Almighty Power.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||5||25||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  The entire world has gone insane in egotism.<br>
  In the love of duality, it wanders deluded by doubt.<br>
  The mind is distracted by great anxiety; no one recognizes one's own self.<br>
  Occupied with their own affairs, their nights and days are passing away. ||1||<br>
  Meditate on the Lord in your hearts, O my Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  The Gurmukh's tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Gurmukhs recognize the Lord in their own hearts;<br>
  they serve the Lord, the Life of the World. They are famous throughout the four ages.<br>
  They subdue egotism, and realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  God, the Architect of Destiny, showers His Mercy upon them. ||2||<br>
  True are those who merge into the Word of the Guru's Shabad;<br>
  they restrain their wandering mind and keep it steady.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the nine treasures. It is obtained from the Guru.<br>
  By the Lord's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. ||3||<br>
  Chanting the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, the body becomes peaceful and tranquil.<br>
  He dwells deep within - the pain of death does not touch Him.<br>
  He Himself is our Lord and Master; He is His Own Advisor.<br>
  O Nanak, serve the Lord forever; He is the treasure of glorious virtue. ||4||6||26||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Why forget Him, unto whom the soul and the breath of life belong?<br>
  Why forget Him, who is all-pervading?<br>
  Serving Him, one is honored and accepted in the Court of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the Name of the Lord.<br>
  If I were to forget You, at that very instant, I would die. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those whom You Yourself have led astray, forget You.<br>

  The ignorant, self-willed manmukhs are consigned to reincarnation. ||2||<br>

  Through the Guru's Teachings, they are absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||3||<br>
  Those who have virtue as their treasure, contemplate spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Those who have virtue as their treasure, subdue egotism.<br>
  Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||7||27||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  You are Indescribable; how can I describe You?<br>
  Those who subdue their minds, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, are absorbed in You.<br>
  Your Glorious Virtues are countless; their value cannot be estimated. ||1||<br>
  The Word of His Bani belongs to Him; in Him, it is diffused.<br>
  Your Speech cannot be spoken; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is chanted. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Where the True Guru is - there is the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<br>
  Where the True Guru is - there, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are intuitively sung.<br>

  The Gurmukhs enshrine the Naam within the mind.<br>
  The Gurmukhs worship the Lord, and are absorbed in the Naam. ||3||<br>
  The Giver Himself gives His Gifts,<br>
  as we enshrine love for the True Guru.<br>
  Nanak celebrates those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||8||28||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:<br>
  All forms and colors come from the One Lord.<br>
  Air, water and fire are all kept together.<br>
  The Lord God beholds the many and various colors. ||1||<br>
  The One Lord is wondrous and amazing! He is the One, the One and Only.<br>
  How rare is that Gurmukh who meditates on the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  God is naturally pervading all places.<br>
  Sometimes He is hidden, and sometimes He is revealed; thus God has made the world of His making.<br>
  He Himself wakes us from sleep. ||2||<br>
  No one can estimate His value,<br>
  although everyone has tried, over and over again, to describe Him.<br>
  Those who merge in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, come to understand the Lord. ||3||<br>
  They listen to the Shabad continually; beholding Him, they merge into Him.<br>
  They obtain glorious greatness by serving the Guru.<br>

  Those humble beings who love the Naam, are awake and aware. ||1||<br>
  One who is awake to this intuitive wisdom does not fall asleep.<br>
  How rare are those humble beings who understand this through the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The unsaintly blockhead shall never understand.<br>
  He babbles on and on, but he is infatuated with Maya.<br>
  Blind and ignorant, he shall never be reformed. ||2||<br>
  In this age, salvation comes only from the Lord's Name.<br>

  Listen, O my mind: contemplate the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Chant the Lord's Name, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In doubt he comes, and in doubt he goes.<br>
  This world is born out of the love of duality.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord; he continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||2||<br>
  Does he himself go astray, or does God lead him astray?<br>
  This soul is enjoined to the service of someone else.<br>
  It earns only terrible pain, and this life is lost in vain. ||3||<br>
  Granting His Grace, He leads us to meet the True Guru.<br>
  Remembering the One Name, doubt is cast out from within.<br>

  They become Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive, and they find the Lord.<br>
  Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the intellect becomes pure and sublime,<br>
  and they are easily and intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||2||<br>
  In the love of duality, no one can serve the Lord.<br>
  In egotism and Maya, they are eating toxic poison.<br>
  They are emotionally attached to their children, family and home.<br>
  The blind, self-willed manmukhs come and go in reincarnation. ||3||<br>

  Water is contained within the earth; without feet, the clouds run around and let down their rain. ||1||<br>

  The Lord's humble servants are the saviors of their families; they save their families for twenty-one generations - they save the entire world! ||2||<br>
  Whatever has been done, has been done by the Lord; it is the Glorious Greatness of the Lord.<br>
  O Lord, in Your creatures, You are pervading; You inspire them to worship You.<br>
  The Lord leads us to the treasure of devotional worship; He Himself bestows it. ||3||<br>
  I am a slave, purchased in Your market; what clever tricks do I have?<br>
  If the Lord were to set me upon a throne, I would still be His slave. If I were a grass-cutter, I would still chant the Lord's Name.<br>
  Servant Nanak is the slave of the Lord; contemplate the Glorious Greatness of the Lord||4||2||8||46||<br>

  The farmers love to work their farms;<br>
  they plow and work the fields, so that their sons and daughters may eat.<br>
  In just the same way, the Lord's humble servants chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and in the end, the Lord shall save them. ||1||<br>
  I am foolish - save me, O my Lord!<br>
  O Lord, enjoin me to work and serve the Guru, the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The traders buy horses, planning to trade them.<br>
  They hope to earn wealth; their attachment to Maya increases.<br>
  In just the same way, the Lord's humble servants chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; chanting the Lord's Name, they find peace. ||2||<br>
  The shop-keepers collect poison, sitting in their shops, carrying on their business.<br>
  Their love is false, their displays are false, and they are engrossed in falsehood.<br>
  In just the same way, the Lord's humble servants gather the wealth of the Lord's Name; they take the Lord's Name as their supplies. ||3||<br>
  This emotional attachment to Maya and family, and the love of duality, is a noose around the neck.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, the humble servants are carried across; they become the slaves of the Lord's slaves.<br>
  Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam; the Gurmukh is enlightened. ||4||3||9||47||<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Continuously, day and night, they are gripped by greed and deluded by doubt.<br>
  The slaves labor in slavery, carrying the loads upon their heads.<br>
  That humble being who serves the Guru is put to work by the Lord in His Home. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, please break these bonds of Maya, and put me to work in Your Home.<br>
  I continuously sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; I am absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Mortal men work for kings, all for the sake of wealth and Maya.<br>
  But the king either imprisons them, or fines them, or else dies himself.<br>
  Blessed, rewarding and fruitful is the service of the True Guru; through it, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and I have found peace. ||2||<br>
  Everyday, people carry on their business, with all sorts of devices to earn interest, for the sake of Maya.<br>
  If they earn a profit, they are pleased, but their hearts are broken by losses.<br>
  One who is worthy, becomes a partner with the Guru, and finds a lasting peace forever. ||3||<br>

  Within my conscious mind is the constant longing for the Lord. How can I behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, Lord?<br>
  One who loves the Lord knows this; the Lord is very dear to my conscious mind.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has re-united me with my Creator Lord; I was separated from Him for such a long time! ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, I am a sinner; I have come to Your Sanctuary, and fallen at Your Door, Lord.<br>
  My intellect is worthless; I am filthy and polluted. Please shower me with Your Mercy sometime. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My demerits are so many and numerous. I have sinned so many times, over and over again. O Lord, they cannot be counted.<br>
  You, Lord, are the Merciful Treasure of Virtue. When it pleases You, Lord, You forgive me.<br>
  I am a sinner, saved only by the Company of the Guru. He has bestowed the Teachings of the Lord's Name, which saves me. ||2||<br>
  What Glorious Virtues of Yours can I describe, O my True Guru? When the Guru speaks, I am transfixed with wonder.<br>
  Can anyone else save a sinner like me? The True Guru has protected and saved me.<br>
  O Guru, You are my father. O Guru, You are my mother. O Guru, You are my relative, companion and friend. ||3||<br>
  My condition, O my True Guru - that condition, O Lord, is known only to You.<br>
  I was rolling around in the dirt, and no one cared for me at all. In the Company of the Guru, the True Guru, I, the worm, have been raised up and exalted.<br>
  Blessed, blessed is the Guru of servant Nanak; meeting Him, all my sorrows and troubles have come to an end. ||4||5||11||49||<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The soul of the man is lured by gold and women; emotional attachment to Maya is so sweet to him.<br>
  The mind has become attached to the pleasures of houses, palaces, horses and other enjoyments.<br>
  The Lord God does not even enter his thoughts; how can he be saved, O my Lord King? ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, these are my lowly actions, O my Lord.<br>
  O Lord, Har, Har, Treasure of Virtue, Merciful Lord: please bless me with Your Grace and forgive me for all my mistakes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have no beauty, no social status, no manners.<br>
  With what face am I to speak? I have no virtue at all; I have not chanted Your Name.<br>
  I am a sinner, saved only by the Company of the Guru. This is the generous blessing of the True Guru. ||2||<br>
  He gave all beings souls, bodies, mouths, noses and water to drink.<br>
  He gave them corn to eat, clothes to wear, and other pleasures to enjoy.<br>
  But they do not remember the One who gave them all this. The animals think that they made themselves! ||3||<br>
  You made them all; You are all-pervading. You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  What can these wretched creatures do? This whole drama is Yours, O Lord and Master.<br>

  Just as the mother, having given birth to a son, feeds him and keeps him in her vision<br>

  In just the same way, the True Guru loves His Sikhs. The Lord cherishes His GurSikhs, and keeps them clasped to His Heart. ||2||<br>
  Just as the tongue, made of flesh and blood, is protected within the scissors of the thirty-two teeth<br>
  - who thinks that the power lies in the flesh or the scissors? Everything is in the Power of the Lord.<br>
  In just the same way, when someone slanders the Saint, the Lord preserves the honor of His servant. ||3||<br>
  O Siblings of Destiny, let none think that they have any power. All act as the Lord causes them to act.<br>
  Old age, death, fever, poisons and snakes - everything is in the Hands of the Lord. Nothing can touch anyone without the Lord's Order.<br>

  Granting His Grace, the Lord has led me to meet my Perfect True Guru.<br>
  The desire of His humble servant has been fulfilled. I have received the dust of the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||<br>
  Those who meet the True Guru implant devotional worship to the Lord, and listen to this devotional worship of the Lord.<br>
  They never suffer any loss; they continually earn the profit of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  One whose heart blossoms forth, is not in love with duality.<br>
  O Nanak, meeting the Guru, one is saved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||8||14||52||<br>

  The Merciful Lord God showered me with His Mercy; with mind and body and mouth, I chant the Lord's Name.<br>

  I am the maid-servant of my Lord God.<br>

  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained the sublime essence of the Lord. I am absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord, Har, Har, and the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the panacea, the medicine for the world. The Lord, and the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, bring peace and tranquility.<br>
  Those who partake of the Lord's sublime essence, through the Guru's Teachings - their sins and sufferings are all eliminated. ||2||<br>
  Those who have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed on their foreheads, bathe in the pool of contentment of the Guru.<br>
  The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away, from those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord's Name. ||3||<br>
  O Lord, You Yourself are Your Own Master, O God. There is no other Giver as Great as You.<br>

  O Lord, my mind and body have been pierced through by the True Lord.<br>
  The whole world is caught and held in the mouth of Death. Through the Teachings of the Guru, the True Guru, O Lord, I am saved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who are not in love with the Lord are foolish and false - they are faithless cynics.<br>
  They suffer the most extreme agonies of birth and death; they die over and over again, and they rot away in manure. ||2||<br>
  You are the Merciful Cherisher of those who seek Your Sanctuary. I beg of You: please grant me Your gift, Lord.<br>

  My forehead has been branded with His brand; I owe such a great debt to the Guru.<br>
  He has been so generous and kind to me; He has carried me across the treacherous and terrifying world-ocean. ||2||<br>
  Those who do not have love for the Lord within their hearts, harbor only false intentions and goals.<br>

  Greet the Holy Saint with your palms pressed together; this is an act of great merit.<br>
  Bow down before Him; this is a virtuous action indeed. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The wicked shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not know the taste of the Lord's sublime essence. The thorn of egotism is embedded deep within them.<br>
  The more they walk away, the deeper it sticks into them, and the more they suffer in pain, until finally, the Messenger of Death smashes his club against their heads. ||2||<br>
  The humble servants of the Lord are absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The pain of birth and the fear of death are eradicated.<br>
  They have obtained the Imperishable Supreme Being, the Transcendent Lord God, and they obtain great honor throughout all the worlds and realms. ||3||<br>

  Those whose hearts are pleased with the Guru's Teachings - the Lord's Presence is revealed to them. ||2||<br>
  The hearts of the self-willed manmukhs are hard and cruel; their inner beings are dark.<br>

  His devotees have the Support of the Naam, O my Lord of the Universe; they beg for the sublime sermon of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The Lord Himself inspires His devotees to worship Him, O my Lord of the Universe; the Lord fulfills the desires of the minds of His devotees.<br>

  Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Even with vast sums of wealth, the mind is not satisfied.<br>
  Gazing upon countless beauties, the man is not satisfied.<br>
  He is so involved with his wife and sons - he believes that they belong to him.<br>
  That wealth shall pass away, and those relatives shall be reduced to ashes. ||1||<br>
  Without meditating and vibrating on the Lord, they are crying out in pain.<br>
  Their bodies are cursed, and their wealth is cursed - they are imbued with Maya. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The servant carries the bags of money on his head,<br>
  but it goes to his master's house, and he receives only pain.<br>
  The man sits as a king in his dreams,<br>
  but when he opens his eyes, he sees that it was all in vain. ||2||<br>
  The watchman oversees the field of another,<br>
  but the field belongs to his master, while he must get up and depart.<br>
  He works so hard, and suffers for that field,<br>
  but still, nothing comes into his hands. ||3||<br>
  The dream is His, and the kingdom is His;<br>
  He who has given the wealth of Maya, has infused the desire for it.<br>
  He Himself annihilates, and He Himself restores.<br>
  Nanak offers this prayer to God. ||4||11||80||<br>

  Show me that peace, O Saints,<br>
  which will quench my thirst and satisfy my mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You may have horses as fast as the wind, elephants to ride on,<br>
  sandalwood oil, and beautiful women in bed,<br>
  actors in dramas, singing in theaters<br>
  - but even with them, the mind does not find contentment. ||2||<br>
  You may have a throne at the royal court, with beautiful decorations and soft carpets,<br>
  all sorts of luscious fruits and beautiful gardens,<br>
  the excitement of the chase and princely pleasures<br>
  - but still, the mind is not made happy by such illusory diversions. ||3||<br>
  In their kindness, the Saints have told me of the True One,<br>
  and so I have obtained all comforts and joy.<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.<br>

  He cannot be the slave of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  What is that way, by which the Lord's Praises might be sung?<br>
  What is that intellect, by which this person might swim across, O mother? ||1||Pause||<br>
  That which is for his own good, he thinks is evil.<br>
  If someone tells him the truth, he looks upon that as poison.<br>
  He cannot tell victory from defeat.<br>
  This is the way of life in the world of the faithless cynic. ||2||<br>
  The demented fool drinks in the deadly poison,<br>
  while he believes the Ambrosial Naam to be bitter.<br>
  He does not even approach the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;<br>

  It torments us with the expression of pleasure and pain.<br>
  It torments us through incarnations in heaven and hell.<br>
  It is seen to afflict the rich, the poor and the glorious.<br>
  The source of this illness which torments us is greed. ||1||<br>
  Maya torments us in so many ways.<br>

  by doing so, they receive the whole thing. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All of my companions are intoxicated with their sensory pleasures;<br>
  they do not know how to guard their own home.<br>
  The five thieves have plundered them;<br>
  the thugs descend upon the unguarded village. ||2||<br>
  Our mothers and fathers cannot save us from them;<br>
  friends and brothers cannot protect us from them<br>
  - they cannot be restrained by wealth or cleverness.<br>
  Only through the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, can those villains be brought under control. ||3||<br>

  The dust of the feet of the Saints is all the treasure I need.<br>

  He alone obtains it, unto whom the Guru has bestowed it.<br>
  O Nanak, no one shall go away empty-handed. ||4||27||96||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The hands are sanctified instantly,<br>
  and the entanglements of Maya are dispelled.<br>
  Repeat constantly with your tongue the Glorious Praises of the Lord,<br>
  and you shall find peace, O my friends, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||<br>
  With pen and ink, write upon your paper<br>
  the Name of the Lord, the Ambrosial Word of the Lord's Bani. ||1||Pause||<br>

  That person, who has this treasure upon his forehead<br>
  - that person meditates on God.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||4||28||97||<br>
  Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, Du-Padas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  That which belongs to another - he claims as his own.<br>
  That which he must abandon - to that, his mind is attracted. ||1||<br>
  Tell me, how can he meet the Lord of the World?<br>
  That which is forbidden - with that, he is in love. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That which is false - he deems as true.<br>
  That which is true - his mind is not attached to that at all. ||2||<br>
  He takes the crooked path of the unrighteous way;<br>
  leaving the straight and narrow path, he weaves his way backwards. ||3||<br>
  God is the Lord and Master of both worlds.<br>
  He, whom the Lord unites with Himself, O Nanak, is liberated. ||4||29||98||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, they come together through destiny.<br>
  As long as the Lord commands, they enjoy their pleasures. ||1||<br>
  By burning oneself, the Beloved Lord is not obtained.<br>
  Only by the actions of destiny does she rise up and burn herself, as a 'satee'. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Imitating what she sees, with her stubborn mind-set, she goes into the fire.<br>
  She does not obtain the Company of her Beloved Lord, and she wanders through countless incarnations. ||2||<br>
  With pure conduct and self-restraint, she surrenders to her Husband Lord's Will;<br>
  that woman shall not suffer pain at the hands of the Messenger of Death. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, she who looks upon the Transcendent Lord as her Husband,<br>
  is the blessed 'satee'; she is received with honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||30||99||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I am prosperous and fortunate, for I have received the True Name.<br>
  I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, with natural, intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 036</h2></center>
  When I opened it up and gazed upon the treasures of my father and grandfather,<br>
  then my mind became very happy. ||1||<br>
  The storehouse is inexhaustible and immeasurable, overflowing with priceless jewels and rubies. ||2||<br>
  The Siblings of Destiny meet together, and eat and spend,<br>
  but these resources do not diminish; they continue to increase. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, one who has such destiny written on his forehead,<br>
  becomes a partner in these treasures. ||4||31||100||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I was scared, scared to death, when I thought that He was far away.<br>
  But my fear was removed, when I saw that He is pervading everywhere. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.<br>
  He shall not abandon me; He shall surely carry me across. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Pain, disease and sorrow come when one forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Eternal bliss comes when one sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Do not say that anyone is good or bad.<br>
  Renounce your arrogant pride, and grasp the Feet of the Lord. ||3||<br>

  you shall find peace at the True Court. ||4||32||101||<br>

  Those who are in love with the Lord of the Universe<br>
  - pain, suffering and doubt run away from them. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who have enjoyed the flavor of the Lord's sublime essence<br>
  are not attracted to any other pleasures. ||2||<br>
  Those whose speech is accepted in the Court of the Lord<br>
  - what do they care about anything else? ||3||<br>
  Those who belong to the One, unto whom all things belong<br>
  - O Nanak, they find a lasting peace. ||4||33||102||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Those who look alike upon pleasure and pain<br>
  - how can anxiety touch them? ||1||<br>
  The Lord's Holy Saints abide in celestial bliss.<br>
  They remain obedient to the Lord, the Sovereign Lord King. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who have the Carefree Lord abiding in their minds<br>
  - no cares will ever bother them. ||2||<br>
  Those who have banished doubt from their minds<br>
  are not afraid of death at all. ||3||<br>
  Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord's Name by the Guru<br>
  - says Nanak, all treasures come to them. ||4||34||103||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord of Unfathomable Form has His Place in the mind.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, a rare few come to understand this. ||1||<br>
  The Ambrosial Pools of the celestial sermon<br>
  - those who find them, drink them in. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The unstruck melody of the Guru's Bani vibrates in that most special place.<br>
  The Lord of the World is fascinated with this melody. ||2||<br>
  The numerous, countless places of celestial peace<br>
  - there, the Saints dwell, in the Company of the Supreme Lord God. ||3||<br>
  There is infinite joy, and no sorrow or duality.<br>
  The Guru has blessed Nanak with this home. ||4||35||104||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  What form of Yours should I worship and adore?<br>
  What Yoga should I practice to control my body? ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 037</h2></center>
  What is that virtue, by which I may sing of You?<br>
  What is that speech, by which I may please the Supreme Lord God? ||1||Pause||<br>
  What worship service shall I perform for You?<br>
  How can I cross over the terrifying world-ocean? ||2||<br>
  What is that penance, by which I may become a penitent?<br>
  What is that Name, by which the filth of egotism may be washed away? ||3||<br>
  Virtue, worship, spiritual wisdom, meditation and all service, O Nanak,<br>
  are obtained from the True Guru, when, in His Mercy and Kindness, He meets us. ||4||<br>
  They alone receive this merit, and they alone know God,<br>
  who are approved by the Giver of peace. ||1||Second Pause||36||105||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The body which you are so proud of, does not belong to you.<br>
  Power, property and wealth are not yours. ||1||<br>
  They are not yours, so why do you cling to them?<br>
  Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is yours; it is received from the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Children, spouse and siblings are not yours.<br>
  Dear friends, mother and father are not yours. ||2||<br>
  Gold, silver and money are not yours.<br>
  Fine horses and magnificent elephants are of no use to you. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, those whom the Guru forgives, meet with the Lord.<br>
  Everything belongs to those who have the Lord as their King. ||4||37||106||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I place the Guru's Feet on my forehead,<br>
  and all my pains are gone. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.<br>
  I have come to understand my soul, and I enjoy supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have applied the dust of the Guru's Feet to my face,<br>
  which has removed all my arrogant intellect. ||2||<br>
  The Word of the Guru's Shabad has become sweet to my mind,<br>
  and I behold the Supreme Lord God. ||3||<br>
  The Guru is the Giver of peace; the Guru is the Creator.<br>
  O Nanak, the Guru is the Support of the breath of life and the soul. ||4||38||107||<br>

  O my mind, seek the One who lacks nothing. ||1||<br>
  Make the Beloved Lord your friend.<br>
  Keep Him constantly in your mind; He is the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  O my mind, serve Him;<br>
  He is the Primal Being, the Infinite Divine Lord. ||2||<br>
  Place your hopes in the One<br>
  who is the Support of all beings, from the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages. ||3||<br>

  Says Nanak, I have found that Guru,<br>
  who has shown me the Perfect, Supreme Lord God. ||4||41||110||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  This human body is so difficult to obtain; it is only obtained by great good fortune.<br>
  Those who do not meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are murderers of the soul. ||1||<br>
  Those who forget the Lord might just as well die.<br>
  Without the Naam, of what use are their lives? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Eating, drinking, playing, laughing and showing off<br>
  - what use are the ostentatious displays of the dead? ||2||<br>
  Those who do not listen to the Praises of the Lord of supreme bliss,<br>
  are worse off than beasts, birds or creeping creatures. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, the GurMantra has been implanted within me;<br>
  the Name alone is contained within my heart. ||4||42||111||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Whose mother is this? Whose father is this?<br>
  They are relatives in name only- they are all false. ||1||<br>
  Why are you screaming and shouting, you fool?<br>
  By good destiny and the Lord's Order, you have come into the world. ||1||Pause||<br>
  There is the one dust, the one light,<br>
  the one praanic wind. Why are you crying? For whom do you cry? ||2||<br>
  People weep and cry out, "Mine, mine!"<br>
  This soul is not perishable. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has opened my shutters;<br>
  I am liberated, and my doubts have been dispelled. ||4||43||112||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Those who seem to be great and powerful,<br>
  are afflicted by the disease of anxiety. ||1||<br>
  Who is great by the greatness of Maya?<br>
  They alone are great, who are lovingly attached to the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The landlord fights over his land each day.<br>
  He shall have to leave it in the end, and yet his desire is still not satisfied. ||2||<br>
  Says Nanak, this is the essence of Truth:<br>
  without the Lord's meditation, there is no salvation. ||3||44||113||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Perfect is the path; perfect is the cleansing bath.<br>
  Everything is perfect, if the Naam is in the heart. ||1||<br>
  One's honor remains perfect, when the Perfect Lord preserves it.<br>
  His servant takes to the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Perfect is the peace; perfect is the contentment.<br>
  Perfect is the penance; perfect is the Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. ||2||<br>

  Come out, O soul-bird, and let the meditative remembrance of the Lord be your wings.<br>
  Meet the Holy Saint, take to His Sanctuary, and keep the perfect jewel of the Lord enshrined in your heart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Superstition is the well, thirst for pleasure is the mud, and emotional attachment is the noose, so tight around your neck.<br>
  The only one who can cut this is the Guru of the World, the Lord of the Universe. So let yourself dwell at His Lotus Feet. ||1||<br>
  Bestow Your Mercy, O Lord of the Universe, O God, My Beloved, Master of the meek - please, listen to my prayer.<br>
  Take my hand, O Lord and Master of Nanak; my body and soul all belong to You. ||2||3||120||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  My mind yearns to behold the Lord in meditation.<br>
  I think of Him, I hope and thirst for Him, day and night; is there any Saint who may bring Him near me? ||1||Pause||<br>
  I serve the slaves of His slaves; in so many ways, I beg of Him.<br>
  Setting them upon the scale, I have weighed all comforts and pleasures; without the Lord's Blessed Vision, they are all totally inadequate. ||1||<br>
  By the Grace of the Saints, I sing the Praises of the Ocean of virtue; after countless incarnations, I have been released.<br>
  Meeting the Lord, Nanak has found peace and bliss; his life is redeemed, and prosperity dawns for him. ||2||4||121||<br>
  Raag Gauree Poorbee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  How may I meet my Master, the King, the Lord of the Universe?<br>
  Is there any Saint, who can bestow such celestial peace, and show me the Way to Him? ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 055</h2></center>
  The Unseen Lord is deep within the self; He cannot be seen; the curtain of egotism intervenes.<br>
  In emotional attachment to Maya, all the world is asleep. Tell me, how can this doubt be dispelled? ||1||<br>
  The one lives together with the other in the same house, but they do not talk to one another, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Without the one substance, the five are miserable; that substance is in the unapproachable place. ||2||<br>
  And the one whose home it is, has locked it up, and given the key to the Guru.<br>
  You may make all sorts of efforts, but it cannot be obtained, without the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||3||<br>
  Those whose bonds have been broken by the True Guru, enshrine love for the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  The self-elect, the self-realized beings, meet together and sing the joyous songs of the Lord. Nanak, there is no difference between them, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||<br>
  This is how my Sovereign Lord King, the Lord of the Universe, is met;<br>
  celestial bliss is attained in an instant, and doubt is dispelled. Meeting Him, my light merges in the Light. ||1||Second Pause||1||122||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I am intimate with Him;<br>
  granting His Grace, my Kind Beloved has told me of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wherever I look, there You are; I am totally convinced of this.<br>
  Unto whom should I pray? The Lord Himself hears all. ||1||<br>
  My anxiety is over. The Guru has cut away my bonds, and I have found eternal peace.<br>
  Whatever shall be, shall be in the end; so where can pain and pleasure be seen? ||2||<br>
  The continents and the solar systems rest in the support of the One Lord. The Guru has removed the veil of illusion, and shown this to me.<br>
  The nine treasures of the wealth of the Name of the Lord are in that one place. Where else should we go? ||3||<br>
  The same gold is fashioned into various articles; just so, the Lord has made the many patterns of the creation.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt; in this way, my essence merges into God's essence. ||4||2||123||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  This life is diminishing, day and night.<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, your affairs shall be resolved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Listen, my friends, I beg of you: now is the time to serve the Saints!<br>
  In this world, earn the profit of the Lord's Name, and hereafter, you shall dwell in peace. ||1||<br>
  This world is engrossed in corruption and cynicism. Only those who know God are saved.<br>
  Those who are awakened by the Lord to drink in this sublime essence, come to know the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Purchase only that for which you have come into the world, and through the Guru, the Lord shall dwell within your mind.<br>
  Within the home of your own inner being, you shall obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence with intuitive ease. You shall not be consigned again to the wheel of reincarnation. ||3||<br>
  O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts, Primal Being, Architect of Destiny: please fulfill this yearning of my mind.<br>
  Nanak, Your slave, begs for this happiness: let me be the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||4||3||124||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Save me, O My Father God.<br>
  I am worthless and without virtue; all virtues are Yours. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The five vicious thieves are assaulting my poor being; save me, O Savior Lord!<br>
  They are tormenting and torturing me. I have come, seeking Your Sanctuary. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 056</h2></center>
  Trying all sorts of things, I have grown weary, but still, they will not leave me alone.<br>
  But I have heard that they can be rooted out, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; and so I seek their Shelter. ||2||<br>
  In their Mercy, the Saints have met me, and from them, I have obtained satisfaction.<br>
  The Saints have given me the Mantra of the Fearless Lord, and now I practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||<br>
  I have now conquered those terrible evil-doers, and my speech is now sweet and sublime.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Divine Light has dawned within my mind; I have obtained the state of Nirvaanaa. ||4||4||125||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He is the Eternal King.<br>
  The Fearless Lord abides with you. So where does this fear come from? ||1||Pause||<br>
  In one person, You are arrogant and proud, and in another, You are meek and humble.<br>
  In one person, You are all by Yourself, and in another, You are poor. ||1||<br>
  In one person, you are a Pandit, a religious scholar and a preacher, and in another, You are just a fool.<br>
  In one person, You grab hold of everything, and in another, You accept nothing. ||2||<br>
  What can the poor wooden puppet do? The Master Puppeteer knows everything.<br>
  As the Puppeteer dresses the puppet, so is the role the puppet plays. ||3||<br>
  The Lord has created the various chambers of assorted descriptions, and He Himself protects them.<br>
  As is that vessel in which the Lord places the soul, so does it dwell. What can this poor being do? ||4||<br>
  The One who created the thing, understands it; He has fashioned all of this.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Lord and Master is Infinite; He alone understands the value of His Creation. ||5||5||126||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Give them up - give up the pleasures of corruption;<br>
  you are entangled in them, you crazy fool, like an animal grazing in the green fields. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That which you believe to be of use to you, shall not go even an inch with you.<br>
  Naked you came, and naked you shall depart. You shall go round and round the cycle of birth and death, and you shall be food for Death. ||1||<br>
  Watching, watching the transitory dramas of the world, you are embroiled and enmeshed in them, and you laugh with delight.<br>
  The string of life is wearing thin, day and night, and you have done nothing for your soul. ||2||<br>
  Doing your deeds, you have grown old; your voice fails you, and your body has become weak.<br>
  You were enticed by Maya in your youth, and your attachment for it has not diminished, one little bit. ||3||<br>
  The Guru has shown me that this is the way of the world; I have abandoned the dwelling of pride, and entered Your Sanctuary.<br>
  The Saint has shown me the Path of God; slave Nanak has implanted devotional worship and the Praise of the Lord. ||4||6||127||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Except for You, who is mine?<br>
  O my Beloved, You are the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You alone know the condition of my inner being. You are my Beautiful Friend.<br>
  I receive all comforts from You, O my Unfathomable and Immeasurable Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 057</h2></center>
  I cannot describe Your Manifestations, O Treasure of Excellence, O Giver of peace.<br>
  God is Inaccessible, Incomprehensible and Imperishable; He is known through the Perfect Guru. ||2||<br>
  My doubt and fear have been taken away, and I have been made pure, since my ego was conquered.<br>
  My fear of birth and death has been abolished, beholding Your Blessed Vision in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||<br>
  I wash the Guru's Feet and serve Him; I am a sacrifice to Him, 100,000 times.<br>
  By His Grace, servant Nanak has crossed over this terrifying world-ocean; I am united with my Beloved. ||4||7||128||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Who can please You, except You Yourself?<br>
  Gazing upon Your Beauteous Form, all are entranced. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the heavenly paradise, in the nether regions of the underworld, on the planet earth and throughout the galaxies, the One Lord is pervading everywhere.<br>
  Everyone calls upon You with their palms pressed together, saying, "Shiva, Shiva". O Merciful Lord and Master, everyone cries out for Your Help. ||1||<br>
  Your Name, O Lord and Master, is the Purifier of sinners, the Giver of peace, immaculate, cooling and soothing.<br>
  O Nanak, spiritual wisdom, meditation and glorious greatness come from dialogue and discourse with Your Saints. ||2||8||129||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Meet with me, O my Dear Beloved.<br>
  O God, whatever You do - that alone happens. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wandering around through countless incarnations, I endured pain and suffering in so many lives, over and over again.<br>
  By Your Grace, I obtained this human body; grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Sovereign Lord King. ||1||<br>
  That which pleases His Will has come to pass; no one else can do anything.<br>
  By Your Will, enticed by the illusion of emotional attachment, the people are asleep; they do not wake up. ||2||<br>
  Please hear my prayer, O Lord of Life, O Beloved, Ocean of mercy and compassion.<br>
  Save me, O my Father God. I am an orphan - please, cherish me! ||3||<br>
  You reveal the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, for the sake of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Grant Your Grace, and bless us with the dust of the feet of the Saints; Nanak yearns for this peace. ||4||9||130||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those<br>
  who take the Support of the Naam. ||1||Pause||<br>
  How can I recount the praises of those humble beings who are attuned to the Love of the Supreme Lord God?<br>
  Peace, intuitive poise and bliss are with them. There are no other givers equal to them. ||1||<br>
  They have come to save the world - those humble beings who thirst for His Blessed Vision.<br>
  Those who seek their Sanctuary are carried across; in the Society of the Saints, their hopes are fulfilled. ||2||<br>
  If I fall at their Feet, then I live; associating with those humble beings, I remain happy.<br>
  O God, please be merciful to me, that my mind might become the dust of the feet of Your devotees. ||3||<br>
  Power and authority, youth and age - whatever is seen in this world, all of it shall fade away.<br>
  The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is forever new and immaculate. Nanak has earned this wealth of the Lord. ||4||10||131||<br>

  I came to the Guru, to learn the Way of Yoga.<br>
  The True Guru has revealed it to me through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He is contained in the nine continents of the world, and within this body; each and every moment, I humbly bow to Him.<br>
  I have made the Guru's Teachings my ear-rings, and I have enshrined the One Formless Lord within my being. ||1||<br>
  I have brought the five disciples together, and they are now under the control of the one mind.<br>
  When the ten hermits become obedient to the Lord, then I became an immaculate Yogi. ||2||<br>
  I have burnt my doubt, and smeared my body with the ashes. My path is to see the One and Only Lord.<br>
  I have made that intuitive peace my food; the Lord Master has written this pre-ordained destiny upon my forehead. ||3||<br>
  In that place where there is no fear, I have assumed my Yogic posture. The unstruck melody of His Bani is my horn.<br>
  I have made contemplation upon the essential reality my Yogic staff. The Love of the Name in my mind is my Yogic lifestyle. ||4||<br>
  By great good fortune, such a Yogi is met, who cuts away the bonds of Maya.<br>
  Nanak serves and adores this wondrous person, and kisses his feet. ||5||11||132||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is an incomparably beautiful treasure. Listen, everyone, and meditate on it, O friends.<br>
  Those, unto whom the Guru has given the Lord's medicine - their minds become pure and immaculate. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Darkness is dispelled from within that body, in which the Divine Light of the Guru's Shabad shines.<br>
  The noose of doubt is cut away from those who place their faith in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||<br>
  The treacherous and terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, in the boat of the Saadh Sangat.<br>
  My mind's desires are fulfilled, meeting the Guru, in love with the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The devotees have found the treasure of the Naam; their minds and bodies are satisfied and satiated.<br>
  O Nanak, the Dear Lord gives it only to those who surrender to the Lord's Command. ||3||12||133||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Please be kind and compassionate, O Lord of my life; I am helpless, and I seek Your Sanctuary, God.<br>
  Please, give me Your Hand, and lift me up, out of the deep dark pit. I have no clever tricks at all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are the Doer, the Cause of causes - You are everything. You are All-powerful; there is no other than You.<br>
  You alone know Your condition and extent. They alone become Your servants, upon whose foreheads such good destiny is recorded. ||1||<br>
  You are imbued with Your servant, God; Your devotees are woven into Your Fabric, through and through.<br>
  O Darling Beloved, they yearn for Your Name and the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, like the chakvee bird which longs to see the moon. ||2||<br>
  Between the Lord and His Saint, there is no difference at all. Among hundreds of thousands and millions, there is scarcely one humble being.<br>
  Those whose hearts are illuminated by God, sing the Kirtan of His Praises night and day with their tongues. ||3||<br>
  You are All-powerful and Infinite, the most lofty and exalted, the Giver of peace; O God, You are the Support of the breath of life.<br>

  I have become a worshipper of the One Name; the Guru has shown me this amazing wonder. ||1||<br>
  The Divine Light has dawned, and everything is illuminated; the Guru has revealed this spiritual wisdom to my mind.<br>
  Drinking deeply of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, my mind is satisfied, and my fears have been vanquished. ||2||<br>
  Accepting the Command of the Lord's Will, I have found total peace; the home of suffering has been destroyed.<br>
  When God, our Lord and Master was totally pleased, He revealed everything in the form of ecstasy. ||3||<br>
  Nothing comes, and nothing goes; this play is all set in motion by the Lord, the Sovereign King.<br>
  Says Nanak, our Lord and Master is inaccessible and unfathomable. The Lord's devotees take His Name as their Support. ||4||15||136||<br>

  Renounce the intellectual cleverness of your mind, O humble servants of the Lord; understanding the Hukam of His Command, peace is found.<br>
  Whatever God does, accept that with pleasure; in comfort and in suffering, meditate on Him. ||1||<br>
  The Creator emancipates millions of sinners in an instant, without a moment's delay.<br>
  The Lord, the Destroyer of the pain and sorrow of the poor, blesses those with whom He is pleased. ||2||<br>
  He is Mother and Father, the Cherisher of all; He is the Breath of life of all beings, the Ocean of peace.<br>

  Wandering, wandering all around, I have grown weary; trying all sorts of things, I have been searching.<br>
  Says Nanak, He has shown mercy to me; I have found the treasure of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||12||150||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He is the Wish-fulfilling Jewel, the Embodiment of Mercy. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Supreme Lord God is Merciful to the meek;<br>
  meditating in remembrance on Him, peace is obtained. ||1||<br>
  The Wisdom of the Undying Primal Being is beyond comprehension.<br>
  Hearing His Praises, millions of sins are erased. ||2||<br>
  O God, Treasure of Mercy, please bless Nanak with Your kindness, that he may repeat the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||13||151||<br>
  Gauree Poorbee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  O my mind, in the Sanctuary of God, peace is found.<br>
  That day, when the Giver of life and peace is forgotten - that day passes uselessly. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You have come as a guest for one short night, and yet you hope to live for many ages.<br>
  Households, mansions and wealth - whatever is seen, is like the shade of a tree. ||1||<br>
  My body, wealth, and all my gardens and property shall all pass away.<br>
  You have forgotten your Lord and Master, the Great Giver. In an instant, these shall belong to somebody else. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 063</h2></center>
  You wear white clothes and take cleansing baths, and anoint yourself with sandalwood oil.<br>
  But you do not remember the Fearless, Formless Lord - you are like an elephant bathing in the mud. ||3||<br>
  When God becomes merciful, He leads you to meet the True Guru; all peace is in the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Guru has liberated me from bondage; servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||14||152||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  O my mind, dwell always upon the Guru, Guru, Guru.<br>
  The Guru has made the jewel of this human life prosperous and fruitful. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||Pause||<br>
  As many breaths and morsels as you take, O my mind - so many times, sing His Glorious Praises.<br>
  When the True Guru becomes merciful, then this wisdom and understanding is obtained. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, taking the Naam, you shall be released from the bondage of death, and the peace of all peace will be found.<br>
  Serving your Lord and Master, the True Guru, the Great Giver, you shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires. ||2||<br>
  The Name of the Creator is your beloved friend and child; it alone shall go along with you, O my mind.<br>
  So serve your True Guru, and you shall receive the Name from the Guru. ||3||<br>
  When God, the Merciful Guru, showered His Mercy upon me, all my anxieties were dispelled.<br>
  Nanak has found the peace of the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. All his sorrows have been dispelled. ||4||15||153||<br>
  Raag Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The thirst of only a few is quenched. ||1||Pause||<br>
  People may accumulate hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, and yet the mind is not restrained.<br>
  They only yearn for more and more. ||1||<br>
  They may have all sorts of beautiful women, but still, they commit adultery in the homes of others.<br>
  They do not distinguish between good and bad. ||2||<br>
  They wander around lost, trapped in the myriad bonds of Maya; they do not sing the Praises of the Treasure of Virtue.<br>
  Their minds are engrossed in poison and corruption. ||3||<br>
  Those, unto whom the Lord shows His Mercy, remain dead while yet alive. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they cross over the ocean of Maya.<br>
  O Nanak, those humble beings are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||4||1||154||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord is the essence of all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Some practice Yoga, some indulge in pleasures; some live in spiritual wisdom, some live in meditation.<br>
  Some are bearers of the staff. ||1||<br>
  Some chant in meditation, some practice deep, austere meditation; some worship Him in adoration, some practice daily rituals.<br>
  Some live the life of a wanderer. ||2||<br>
  Some live by the shore, some live on the water; some study the Vedas.<br>
  Nanak loves to worship the Lord. ||3||2||155||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  To sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is my treasure. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are my delight, You are my praise. You are my beauty, You are my love.<br>
  O God, You are my hope and support. ||1||<br>
  You are my pride, You are my wealth. You are my honor, You are my breath of life.<br>
  The Guru has repaired that which was broken. ||2||<br>
  You are in the household, and You are in the forest. You are in the village, and You are in the wilderness.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 064</h2></center>
  Nanak: You are near, so very near! ||3||3||156||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I am intoxicated, intoxicated with the Love of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I drink it in - I am drunk with it. The Guru has given it to me in charity.<br>
  My mind is drenched with it. ||1||<br>
  It is my furnace, it is the cooling plaster. It is my love, it is my longing.<br>
  My mind knows it as peace. ||2||<br>
  I enjoy intuitive peace, and I play in bliss; the cycle of reincarnation is ended for me, and I am merged with the Lord.<br>
  Nanak is pierced through with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||4||157||<br>
  Raag Gauree Maalwaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Chant the Lord's Name; O my friend, chant it. Hereafter, the path is terrifying and treacherous. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Serve, serve, forever serve the Lord. Death hangs over your head.<br>
  Do seva, selfless service, for the Holy Saints, and the noose of Death shall be cut away. ||1||<br>
  You may make burnt offerings, sacrificial feasts and pilgrimages to sacred shrines in egotism, but your corruption only increases.<br>
  You are subject to both heaven and hell, and you are reincarnated over and over again. ||2||<br>
  The realm of Shiva, the realms of Brahma and Indra as well - no place anywhere is permanent.<br>
  Without serving the Lord, there is no peace at all. The faithless cynic comes and goes in reincarnation. ||3||<br>
  As the Guru has taught me, so have I spoken.<br>
  Says Nanak, listen, people: sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and you shall be saved. ||4||1||158||<br>
  Raag Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Adopting the innocent mind of a child, I have found peace.<br>
  Joy and sorrow, profit and loss, birth and death, pain and pleasure - they are all the same to my consciousness, since I met the Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  As long as I plotted and planned things, I was full of frustration.<br>
  When I met the Kind, Perfect Guru, then I obtained bliss so easily. ||1||<br>
  The more clever tricks I tried, the more bonds I was saddled with.<br>
  When the Holy Saint placed His Hand upon my forehead, then I was liberated. ||2||<br>
  As long as I claimed, "Mine, mine!", I was surrounded by wickedness and corruption.<br>
  But when I dedicated my mind, body and intellect to my Lord and Master, then I began to sleep in peace. ||3||<br>
  As long as I walked along, carrying the load, I continued to pay the fine.<br>
  But I threw away that bundle, when I met the Perfect Guru; O Nanak, then I became fearless. ||4||1||159||<br>
  Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have renounced my desires; I have renounced them.<br>
  I have renounced them; meeting the Guru, I have renounced them.<br>
  All peace, joy, happiness and pleasures have come since I surrendered to the Will of the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 065</h2></center>
  Honor and dishonor are the same to me; I have placed my forehead upon the Guru's Feet.<br>
  Wealth does not excite me, and misfortune does not disturb me; I have embraced love for my Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  The One Lord and Master dwells in the home; He is seen in the wilderness as well.<br>
  I have become fearless; the Saint has removed my doubts. The All-knowing Lord is pervading everywhere. ||2||<br>
  Whatever the Creator does, my mind is not troubled.<br>
  By the Grace of the Saints and the Company of the Holy, my sleeping mind has been awakened. ||3||<br>
  Servant Nanak seeks Your Support; he has come to Your Sanctuary.<br>
  In the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he enjoys intuitive peace; pain no longer touches him. ||4||2||160||<br>
  Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have found the jewel of my Beloved within my mind.<br>
  My body is cooled, my mind is cooled and soothed, and I am absorbed into the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My hunger has departed, my thirst has totally departed, and all my anxiety is forgotten.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has placed His Hand upon my forehead; conquering my mind, I have conquered the whole world. ||1||<br>
  Satisfied and satiated, I remain steady within my heart, and now, I do not waver at all.<br>
  The True Guru has given me the inexhaustible treasure; it never decreases, and never runs out. ||2||<br>
  Listen to this wonder, O Siblings of Destiny: the Guru has given me this understanding.<br>
  I threw off the veil of illusion, when I met my Lord and Master; then, I forgot my jealousy of others. ||3||<br>
  This is a wonder which cannot be described. They alone know it, who have tasted it.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Truth has been revealed to me. The Guru has given me the treasure; I have taken it and enshrined it within my heart. ||4||3||161||<br>
  Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Those who take to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the King, are saved.<br>
  All other people, in the mansion of Maya, fall flat on their faces on the ground. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The great men have studied the Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas, and they have said this:<br>
  "Without the Lord's meditation, there is no emancipation, and no one has ever found peace."||1||<br>
  People may accumulate the wealth of the three worlds, but the waves of greed are still not subdued.<br>
  Without devotional worship of the Lord, where can anyone find stability? People wander around endlessly. ||2||<br>
  People engage in all sorts of mind-enticing pastimes, but their passions are not fulfilled.<br>
  They burn and burn, and are never satisfied; without the Lord's Name, it is all useless. ||3||<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord, my friend; this is the essence of perfect peace.<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, birth and death are ended. Nanak is the dust of the feet of the humble. ||4||4||162||<br>
  Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Who can help me understand my condition?<br>
  Only the Creator knows it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  This person does things in ignorance; he does not chant in meditation, and does not perform any deep, self-disciplined meditation.<br>
  This mind wanders around in the ten directions - how can it be restrained? ||1||<br>
  "I am the lord, the master of my mind, body, wealth and lands. These are mine."<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 066</h2></center>
  In doubt and emotional attachment, this person understands nothing; with this leash, these feet are tied up. ||2||<br>
  What did this person do, when he did not exist?<br>
  When the Immaculate and Formless Lord God was all alone, He did everything by Himself. ||3||<br>
  He alone knows His actions; He created this creation.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Lord Himself is the Doer. The True Guru has dispelled my doubts. ||4||5||163||<br>
  Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Without the Lord, other actions are useless.<br>
  Meditative chants, intense deep meditation, austere self-discipline and rituals - these are plundered in this world. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Fasting, daily rituals, and austere self-discipline - those who keep the practice of these, are rewarded with less than a shell.<br>
  Hereafter, the way is different, O Siblings of Destiny. There, these things are of no use at all. ||1||<br>
  Those who bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and wander over the earth, find no place of rest hereafter.<br>
  There, these are of no use at all. By these things, they only please other people. ||2||<br>
  Reciting the four Vedas from memory, they do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence hereafter.<br>
  Those who do not understand the One Pure Word, utter total nonsense. ||3||<br>
  Nanak voices this opinion: those who practice it, swim across.<br>
  Serve the Guru, and meditate on the Naam; renounce the egotistical pride from your mind. ||4||6||164||<br>
  Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  O Lord, I chant Your Name, Har, Har, Har.<br>
  I cannot do anything by myself, O Lord and Master. As You keep me, so I remain. ||1||Pause||<br>
  What can the mere mortal do? What is in the hands of this poor creature?<br>
  As You attach us, so we are attached, O my Perfect Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  Take pity on me, O Great Giver of all, that I may enshrine love for Your Form alone.<br>
  Nanak offers this prayer to the Lord, that he may chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||7||165||<br>
  Raag Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>

  You have engaged millions of people in Your Service.<br>
  You are the Lover of Your devotees; this is Your Nature.<br>
  You are totally pervading all places. ||1||<br>
  How can I behold my Beloved? What is that way of life?<br>
  Become the slave of the Saints, and serve at their feet.<br>
  I dedicate this soul; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them.<br>
  Bowing low, I fall at the Feet of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The Pandits, the religious scholars, study the books of the Vedas.<br>
  Some become renunciates, and bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  Some sing tunes and melodies and songs.<br>
  But I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Fearless Lord. ||3||<br>
  My Lord and Master has become merciful to me.<br>
  I was a sinner, and I have been sanctified, taking to the Guru's Feet.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 067</h2></center>
  Dispelling my doubts and fears, the Guru has rid me of hatred.<br>
  The Guru has fulfilled the desires of my mind. ||4||<br>
  One who has obtained the Name is wealthy.<br>
  One who meditates on God is glorified.<br>
  Sublime are all the actions of those who join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Servant Nanak is intuitively absorbed into the Lord. ||5||1||166||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl, Maajh:<br>
  Come to me, O my Beloved Lord.<br>
  Night and day, with each and every breath, I think of You.<br>
  O Saints, give Him this message; I fall at Your Feet.<br>
  Without You, how can I be saved? ||1||<br>
  In Your Company, I am in ecstasy.<br>
  In the forest, the fields and the three worlds, there is peace and supreme bliss.<br>
  My bed is beautiful, and my mind blossoms forth in ecstasy.<br>
  Beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I have found this peace. ||2||<br>
  I wash Your Feet, and constantly serve You.<br>
  O Divine Lord, I worship and adore You; I bow down before You.<br>
  I am the slave of Your slaves; I chant Your Name.<br>
  I offer this prayer to my Lord and Master. ||3||<br>
  My desires are fulfilled, and my mind and body are rejuvenated.<br>
  Beholding the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, all my pains have been taken away.<br>
  Chanting and meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have been saved.<br>
  Nanak endures this unendurable celestial bliss. ||4||2||167||<br>
  Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Listen, listen, O my friend and companion, O Beloved of my mind:<br>
  my mind and body are Yours. This life is a sacrifice to You as well.<br>
  May I never forget God, the Support of the breath of life.<br>
  I have come to Your Eternal Sanctuary. ||1||<br>
  Meeting Him, my mind is revived, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I have found the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  All things belong to God; all places belong to God.<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to God. ||2||<br>
  Very fortunate are those who meditate on this treasure.<br>
  They enshrine love for the Naam, the Name of the One Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Finding the Perfect Guru, all suffering is dispelled.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, I sing the Glories of God. ||3||<br>
  Your Name is the treasure of jewels, Lord.<br>
  You are the True Banker; Your devotee is the trader.<br>
  True is the trade of those who have the wealth of the Lord's assets.<br>
  Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice. ||4||3||168||<br>

  I am so proud of You, O Creator; I am so proud of You.<br>
  Through Your Almighty Power, I dwell in peace. The True Word of the Shabad is my banner and insignia. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He hears and knows everything, but he keeps silent.<br>
  Bewitched by Maya, he never regains awareness. ||1||<br>
  The riddles and hints are given, and he sees them with his eyes.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 068</h2></center>
  But he is foolish and greedy, and he never listens to what he is told. ||2||<br>
  Why bother to count one, two, three, four? The whole world is defrauded by the same enticements.<br>
  Hardly anyone loves the Lord's Name; how rare is that place which is in bloom. ||3||<br>
  The devotees look beautiful in the True Court; night and day, they are happy.<br>
  They are imbued with the Love of the Transcendent Lord; servant Nanak is a sacrifice to them. ||4||1||169||<br>
  Gauree, Fifth Mehl, Maajh:<br>
  The Destroyer of sorrow is Your Name, Lord; the Destroyer of sorrow is Your Name.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, dwell upon the wisdom of the Perfect True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That heart, in which the Supreme Lord God abides, is the most beautiful place.<br>
  The Messenger of Death does not even approach those who chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord with the tongue. ||1||<br>
  I have not understood the wisdom of serving Him, nor have I worshipped Him in meditation.<br>
  You are my Support, O Life of the World; O my Lord and Master, Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. ||2||<br>
  When the Lord of the Universe became merciful, sorrow and suffering departed.<br>
  The hot winds do not even touch those who are protected by the True Guru. ||3||<br>
  The Guru is the All-pervading Lord, the Guru is the Merciful Master; the Guru is the True Creator Lord.<br>
  When the Guru was totally satisfied, I obtained everything. Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||4||2||170||<br>
  Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord, the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam:<br>
  meditating on Him, all affairs are resolved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe, one's mouth is sanctified.<br>
  One who recites to me the Praises of the Lord is my friend and brother. ||1||<br>
  All treasures, all rewards and all virtues are in the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  Why forget Him from your mind? Remembering Him in meditation, pain departs. ||2||<br>
  Grasping the hem of His robe, we live, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one is saved, and one's face becomes radiant in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  The Praise of the Sustainer of the Universe is the essence of life, and the wealth of His Saints.<br>
  Nanak is saved, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord; in the True Court, he is cheered and applauded. ||4||3||171||<br>
  Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Sing the Sweet Praises of the Lord, O my soul, sing the Sweet Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Attuned to the True One, even the homeless find a home. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All other tastes are bland and insipid; through them, the body and mind are rendered insipid as well.<br>
  Without the Transcendent Lord, what can anyone do? Cursed is his life, and cursed his reputation. ||1||<br>
  Grasping the hem of the robe of the Holy Saint, we cross over the world-ocean.<br>
  Worship and adore the Supreme Lord God, and all your family will be saved as well. ||2||<br>
  He is a companion, a relative, and a good friend of mine, who implants the Lord's Name within my heart.<br>
  He washes off all my demerits, and is so generous to me. ||3||<br>
  Wealth, treasures, and household are all just ruins; the Lord's Feet are the only treasure.<br>

  Raag Gauree, Ninth Mehl<br>
  : Holy Saadhus: forsake the pride of your mind.<br>
  Sexual desire, anger and the company of evil people - run away from them, day and night. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who knows that pain and pleasure are both the same, and honor and dishonor as well,<br>
  who remains detached from joy and sorrow, realizes the true essence in the world. ||1||<br>
  Renounce both praise and blame; seek instead the state of Nirvaanaa.<br>
  O servant Nanak, this is such a difficult game; only a few Gurmukhs understand it! ||2||1||<br>
  Gauree, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  Holy Saadhus: the Lord fashioned the creation.<br>
  One person passes away, and another thinks that he will live forever - this is a wonder beyond understanding! ||1||Pause||<br>
  The mortal beings are held in the power of sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment; they have forgotten the Lord, the Immortal Form.<br>
  The body is false, but they believe it to be true; it is like a dream in the night. ||1||<br>
  Whatever is seen, shall all pass away, like the shadow of a cloud.<br>
  O servant Nanak, one who knows the world to be unreal, dwells in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||2||<br>
  Gauree, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  The Praise of the Lord does not come to dwell in the minds of the mortal beings.<br>
  Day and night, they remain engrossed in Maya. Tell me, how can they sing God's Glories? ||1||Pause||<br>
  In this way, they bind themselves to children, friends, Maya and possessiveness.<br>
  Like the deer's delusion, this world is false; and yet, beholding it, they chase after it. ||1||<br>
  Our Lord and Master is the source of pleasures and liberation; and yet, the fool forgets Him.<br>
  O servant Nanak, among millions, there is scarcely anyone who attains the Lord's meditation. ||2||3||<br>
  Gauree, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  Holy Saadhus: this mind cannot be restrained.<br>
  Fickle desires dwell with it, and so it cannot remain steady. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The heart is filled with anger and violence, which cause all sense to be forgotten.<br>
  The jewel of spiritual wisdom has been taken away from everyone; nothing can withstand it. ||1||<br>
  The Yogis have tried everything and failed; the virtuous have grown weary of singing God's Glories.<br>
  O servant Nanak, when the Lord becomes merciful, then every effort is successful. ||2||4||<br>

  Holy Saadhus: sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.<br>

  He is the Purifier of sinners, the Friend of the poor. Come, and enter the Lord's Sanctuary.<br>
  Remembering Him, the elephant's fear was removed; so why do you forget Him? ||1||<br>
  Renounce your egotistical pride and your emotional attachment to Maya; focus your consciousness on the Lord's meditation.<br>

  Having obtained this human body, so very difficult to obtain, it is now being uselessly wasted.<br>
  Emotional attachment to Maya is such a treacherous wilderness, and yet, people are in love with it. ||1||<br>
  Inwardly and outwardly, God is always with them, and yet, they do not enshrine Love for Him.<br>
  O Nanak, know that those whose hearts are filled with the Lord are liberated. ||2||6||<br>
  Gauree, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  Holy Saadhus: rest and peace are in the Sanctuary of the Lord.<br>
  This is the blessing of studying the Vedas and the Puraanas, that you may meditate on the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Greed, emotional attachment to Maya, possessiveness, the service of evil, pleasure and pain - those who are not touched by these, are the very embodiment of the Divine Lord. ||1||<br>
  Heaven and hell, ambrosial nectar and poison, gold and copper - these are all alike to them.<br>
  Praise and slander are all the same to them, as are greed and attachment. ||2||<br>
  They are not bound by pleasure and pain - know that they are truly wise.<br>
  O Nanak, recognize those mortal beings as liberated, who live this way of life. ||3||7||<br>

  You have wasted the precious jewel of this human life; you do not know the Way of the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  You have not been absorbed in the Lord's Feet, even for an instant. Your life has passed away in vain! ||2||<br>
  Says Nanak, that man is happy, who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.<br>
  All the rest of the world is enticed by Maya; they do not obtain the state of fearless dignity. ||3||8||<br>

  You people are unconscious; you should be afraid of sin.<br>

  Pure and sublime is the Name of the Lord in the world. Remembering it in meditation, all sinful mistakes shall be washed away. ||1||<br>

  I have obtained the ointment of spiritual wisdom, recognizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Blended with the One Lord, I enjoy intuitive peace.<br>
  Through the Immaculate Bani of the Word, my doubts have been dispelled.<br>
  Instead of the pale color of Maya, I am imbued with the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love.<br>
  By the Lord's Glance of Grace, the poison has been eliminated. ||2||<br>
  When I turned away, and became dead while yet alive, I was awakened.<br>
  Chanting the Word of the Shabad, my mind is attached to the Lord.<br>
  I have gathered in the Lord's sublime essence, and cast out the poison.<br>
  Abiding in His Love, the fear of death has run away. ||3||<br>
  My taste for pleasure ended, along with conflict and egotism.<br>
  My consciousness is attuned to the Lord, by the Order of the Infinite.<br>
  My pursuit for worldy pride and honour is over.<br>
  When He blessed me with His Glance of Grace, peace was established in my soul. ||4||<br>
  Without You, I see no friend at all.<br>
  Whom should I serve? Unto whom should I dedicate my consciousness?<br>
  Whom should I ask? At whose feet should I fall?<br>
  By whose teachings will I remain absorbed in His Love? ||5||<br>
  I serve the Guru, and I fall at the Guru's Feet.<br>
  I worship Him, and I am absorbed in the Lord's Name.<br>
  The Lord's Love is my instruction, sermon and food.<br>
  Enjoined to the Lord's Command, I have entered the home of my inner self. ||6||<br>
  With the extinction of pride, my soul has found peace and meditation.<br>
  The Divine Light has dawned, and I am absorbed in the Light.<br>
  Pre-ordained destiny cannot be erased; the Shabad is my banner and insignia.<br>
  I know the Creator, the Creator of His Creation. ||7||<br>
  I am not a learned Pandit, I am not clever or wise.<br>
  I do not wander; I am not deluded by doubt.<br>
  I do not speak empty speech; I have recognized the Hukam of His Command.<br>
  Nanak is absorbed in intuitive peace through the Guru's Teachings. ||8||1||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl:<br>
  The mind is an elephant in the forest of the body.<br>
  The Guru is the controlling stick; when the Insignia of the True Shabad is applied, one obtains honor in the Court of God the King. ||1||<br>
  He cannot be known through clever tricks.<br>
  Without subduing the mind, how can His value be estimated? ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the house of the self is the Ambrosial Nectar, which is being stolen by the thieves.<br>
  No one can say no to them.<br>
  He Himself protects us, and blesses us with greatness. ||2||<br>
  There are billions, countless billions of fires of desire at the seat of the mind.<br>
  They are extinguished only with the water of understanding, imparted by the Guru.<br>
  Offering my mind, I have attained it, and I joyfully sing His Glorious Praises. ||3||<br>
  Just as He is within the home of the self, so is He beyond.<br>
  But how can I describe Him, sitting in a cave?<br>
  The Fearless Lord is in the oceans, just as He is in the mountains. ||4||<br>
  Tell me, who can kill someone who is already dead?<br>
  What does he fear? Who can frighten the fearless one?<br>
  He recognizes the Word of the Shabad, throughout the three worlds. ||5||<br>
  One who speaks, merely describes speech.<br>
  But one who understands, intuitively realizes.<br>
  Seeing and reflecting upon it, my mind surrenders. ||6||<br>
  Praise, beauty and liberation are in the One Name.<br>
  In it, the Immaculate Lord is permeating and pervading.<br>
  He dwells in the home of the self, and in His own sublime place. ||7||<br>
  The many silent sages lovingly praise Him.<br>

  O Nanak, meditate on the Lord, each and every day. ||8||2||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl:<br>
  The mind does not die, so the job is not accomplished.<br>
  The mind is under the power of the demons of evil intellect and duality.<br>
  But when the mind surrenders, through the Guru, it becomes one. ||1||<br>
  The Lord is without attributes; the attributes of virtue are under His control.<br>
  One who eliminates selfishness contemplates Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The deluded mind thinks of all sorts of corruption.<br>
  When the mind is deluded, the load of wickedness falls on the head.<br>
  But when the mind surrenders to the Lord, it realizes the One and Only Lord. ||2||<br>
  The deluded mind enters the house of Maya.<br>
  Engrossed in sexual desire, it does not remain steady.<br>
  O mortal, lovingly vibrate the Lord's Name with your tongue. ||3||<br>
  Elephants, horses, gold, children and spouses<br>
  - in the anxious affairs of all these, people lose the game and depart.<br>
  In the game of chess, their pieces do not reach their destination. ||4||<br>
  They gather wealth, but only evil comes from it.<br>
  Pleasure and pain stand in the doorway.<br>
  Intuitive peace comes by meditating on the Lord, within the heart. ||5||<br>
  When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then He unites us in His Union.<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, merits are gathered in, and demerits are burned away.<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||6||<br>
  Without the Name, all live in pain.<br>
  The consciousness of the foolish, self-willed manmukh is the dwelling place of Maya.<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom, according to pre-ordained destiny. ||7||<br>
  The fickle mind continuously runs after fleeting things.<br>
  The Pure True Lord is not pleased by filth.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||8||3||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl:<br>
  Acting in egotism, peace is not obtained.<br>
  The intellect of the mind is false; only the Lord is True.<br>
  All who love duality are ruined.<br>
  People act as they are pre-ordained. ||1||<br>
  I have seen the world to be such a gambler;<br>
  all beg for peace, but they forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If the Unseen Lord could be seen, then He could be described.<br>
  Without seeing Him, all descriptions are useless.<br>
  The Gurmukh sees Him with intuitive ease.<br>
  So serve the One Lord, with loving awareness. ||2||<br>
  People beg for peace, but they receive severe pain.<br>
  They are all weaving a wreath of corruption.<br>
  You are false - without the One, there is no liberation.<br>
  The Creator created the creation, and He watches over it. ||3||<br>
  The fire of desire is quenched by the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Duality and doubt are automatically eliminated.<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, the Naam abides in the heart.<br>
  Through the True Word of His Bani, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||<br>
  The True Lord abides within the body of that Gurmukh who enshrines love for Him.<br>
  Without the Naam, none obtain their own place.<br>
  The Beloved Lord King is dedicated to love.<br>
  If He bestows His Glance of Grace, then we realize His Name. ||5||<br>
  Emotional attachment to Maya is total entanglement.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is filthy, cursed and dreadful.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, these entanglements are ended.<br>
  In the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, you shall abide in lasting peace. ||6||<br>
  The Gurmukhs understand the One Lord, and enshrine love for Him.<br>
  They dwell in the home of their own inner beings, and merge in the True Lord.<br>
  The cycle of birth and death is ended.<br>
  This understanding is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||7||<br>

  They are destroyed by sexual desire, anger and egotism. ||1||<br>
  Whom should I call the second, when there is only the One?<br>
  The One Immaculate Lord is pervading among all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The dual-minded evil intellect speaks of a second.<br>
  One who harbors duality comes and goes and dies. ||2||<br>
  In the earth and in the sky, I do not see any second.<br>
  Among all the women and the men, His Light is shining. ||3||<br>
  In the lamps of the sun and the moon, I see His Light.<br>
  Dwelling among all is my ever-youthful Beloved. ||4||<br>
  In His Mercy, He attuned my consciousness to the Lord.<br>
  The True Guru has led me to understand the One Lord. ||5||<br>
  The Gurmukh knows the One Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Subduing duality, one comes to realize the Word of the Shabad. ||6||<br>
  The Command of the One Lord prevails throughout all the worlds.<br>
  From the One, all have arisen. ||7||<br>
  There are two routes, but remember that their Lord and Master is only One.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, recognize the Hukam of the Lord's Command. ||8||<br>

  They conquer the five thieves, and enshrine the True Lord in the heart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who enshrine the True Lord deep within,<br>
  realize the value of the Way of Yoga. ||2||<br>
  The sun and the moon are one and the same for them, as are household and wilderness.<br>
  The karma of their daily practice is to praise the Lord. ||3||<br>
  They beg for the alms of the one and only Shabad.<br>
  They remain awake and aware in spiritual wisdom and meditation, and the true way of life. ||4||<br>
  They remain absorbed in the fear of God; they never leave it.<br>
  Who can estimate their value? They remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||5||<br>
  The Lord unites them with Himself, dispelling their doubts.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the supreme status is obtained. ||6||<br>
  In the Guru's service is reflection upon the Shabad.<br>
  Subduing ego, practice pure actions. ||7||<br>
  Chanting, meditation, austere self-discipline and the reading of the Puraanas,<br>
  says Nanak, are contained in surrender to the Unlimited Lord. ||8||6||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  To practice forgiveness is the true fast, good conduct and contentment.<br>
  Disease does not afflict me, nor does the pain of death.<br>
  I am liberated, and absorbed into God, who has no form or feature. ||1||<br>
  What fear does the Yogi have?<br>
  The Lord is among the trees and the plants, within the household and outside as well. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Yogis meditate on the Fearless, Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Night and day, they remain awake and aware, embracing love for the True Lord.<br>
  Those Yogis are pleasing to my mind. ||2||<br>
  The trap of death is burnt by the Fire of God.<br>
  Old age, death and pride are conquered.<br>
  They swim across, and save their ancestors as well. ||3||<br>
  Those who serve the True Guru are the Yogis.<br>
  Those who remain immersed in the Fear of God become fearless.<br>
  They become just like the One they serve. ||4||<br>

  Inwardly and outwardly, he knows the One Lord;<br>
  through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he realizes himself.<br>
  He bears the Banner and Insignia of the True Shabad in the Lord's Court. ||6||<br>
  One who dies in the Shabad abides in his own home within.<br>
  He does not come or go in reincarnation, and his hopes are subdued.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, his heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||7||<br>
  Whoever is seen, is driven by hope and despair,<br>
  by sexual desire, anger, corruption, hunger and thirst.<br>
  O Nanak, those detached recluses who meet the Lord are so very rare. ||8||7||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  Meeting such a slave, peace is obtained.<br>
  Pain is forgotten, when the True Lord is found. ||1||<br>
  Beholding the blessed vision of his darshan, my understanding has become perfect.<br>

  My eyes are contented with the constant love of the One Lord.<br>
  My tongue is purified by the most sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  True are my actions, and deep within my being, I serve Him.<br>
  My mind is satisfied by the Inscrutable, Mysterious Lord. ||3||<br>
  Wherever I look, there I find the True Lord.<br>
  Without understanding, the world argues in falsehood. ||4||<br>
  When the Guru instructs, understanding is obtained.<br>
  How rare is that Gurmukh who understands. ||5||<br>
  Show Your Mercy, and save me, O Savior Lord!<br>
  Without understanding, people become beasts and demons. ||6||<br>
  The Guru has said that there is no other at all.<br>
  So tell me, who should I see, and who should I worship? ||7||<br>
  For the sake of the Saints, God has established the three worlds.<br>
  One who understands his own soul, contemplates the essence of reality. ||8||<br>
  One whose heart is filled with Truth and true love<br>

  Brahma acted in pride, and did not understand.<br>
  Only when he was faced with the downfall of the Vedas did he repent.<br>
  Remembering God in meditation, the mind is conciliated. ||1||<br>
  Such is the horrible pride of the world.<br>
  The Guru eliminates the pride of those who meet Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Bal the King, in Maya and egotism,<br>
  held his ceremonial feasts, but he was puffed up with pride.<br>
  Without the Guru's advice, he had to go to the underworld. ||2||<br>
  Hari Chand gave in charity, and earned public praise.<br>
  But without the Guru, he did not find the limits of the Mysterious Lord.<br>
  The Lord Himself misleads people, and He Himself imparts understanding. ||3||<br>
  The evil-minded Harnaakhash committed evil deeds.<br>
  God, the Lord of all, is the Destroyer of pride.<br>
  He bestowed His Mercy, and saved Prahlaad. ||4||<br>
  Raawan was deluded, foolish and unwise.<br>
  Sri Lanka was plundered, and he lost his head.<br>
  He indulged in ego, and lacked the love of the True Guru. ||5||<br>
  The Lord killed the thousand-armed Arjun, and the demons Madhu-keetab and Meh-khaasaa.<br>
  He seized Harnaakhash and tore him apart with his nails.<br>
  The demons were slain; they did not practice devotional worship. ||6||<br>
  The demons Jaraa-sandh and Kaal-jamun were destroyed.<br>
  Rakat-beej and Kaal-naym were annihilated.<br>

  He Himself, as the True Guru, contemplates the Shabad.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 075</h2></center>
  Because of the love of duality, God killed the demons.<br>
  By their true devotion, the Gurmukhs have been saved. ||8||<br>

  He did not know the Creator Lord.<br>
  One who makes the Lord's humble servant suffer, shall himself suffer and rot. ||9||<br>
  Janameja did not know the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, how could he find peace?<br>
  Making a mistake, for even an instant, you shall regret and repent later on. ||10||<br>
  Kansa the King and his warriors Kays and Chandoor had no equals.<br>

  I may wear ear-rings, and a pearl necklace around my neck;<br>
  my bed may be adorned with red blankets, flowers and red powder;<br>
  but without the Lord of the Universe, where can I search for peace? ||2||<br>
  I may have a beautiful woman with fascinating eyes;<br>
  she may decorate herself with the sixteen adornments, and make herself appear gorgeous.<br>
  But without meditating on the Lord of the Universe, there is only continual suffering. ||3||<br>
  In his hearth and home, in his palace, upon his soft and comfortable bed,<br>
  day and night, the flower-girls scatter flower petals;<br>
  but without the Lord's Name, the body is miserable. ||4||<br>
  Horses, elephants, lances, marching bands,<br>
  armies, standard bearers, royal attendants and ostentatious displays<br>
  - without the Lord of the Universe, these undertakings are all useless. ||5||<br>
  He may be called a Siddha, a man of spiritual perfection, and he may summon riches and supernatural powers;<br>

  but without the Lord of the Universe, where can Truth be found? ||6||<br>
  He may be called an emperor, a lord, and a king;<br>
  he may give orders - "Do this now, do this then" - but this is a false display.<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, his works are not accomplished. ||7||<br>
  Egotism and possessiveness are dispelled by the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>

  They abandon the bitter worldly conflicts.<br>
  Through love and truth, they meet the Truest of the True. ||1||<br>
  Such are the humble devotees of the Lord.<br>
  They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and their pollution is washed away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The heart-lotus of the entire universe is upside-down.<br>
  The fire of evil-mindedness is burning up the world.<br>
  They alone are saved, who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<br>
  The bumble bee, the moth, the elephant, the fish<br>
  and the deer - all suffer for their actions, and die.<br>
  Trapped by desire, they cannot see reality. ||3||<br>
  The lover of women is obsessed with sex.<br>
  All the wicked are ruined by their anger.<br>
  Honor and good sense are lost, when one forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||<br>

  The Gurmukh is emancipated, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||5||<br>
  The lonely widow gives her body to a stranger;<br>
  she allows her mind to be controlled by others for lust or money<br>
  , but without her husband, she is never satisfied. ||6||<br>
  You may read, recite and study the scriptures, the Simritees, Vedas and Puraanas;<br>

  Believe in the Dear Lord, and you shall find peace of mind.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, you shall have to endure the pain of death. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The smell of musk, sandalwood and camphor,<br>
  and the intoxication of Maya, takes one far away from the state of supreme dignity.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, one becomes the most false of all the false. ||2||<br>
  Lances and swords, marching bands, thrones and the salutes of others<br>
  only increase his desire; he is engrossed in sexual desire.<br>
  Without seeking the Lord, neither devotional worship nor the Naam are obtained. ||3||<br>
  Union with God is not obtained by arguments and egotism.<br>
  But by offering your mind, the comfort of the Naam is obtained.<br>
  In the love of duality and ignorance, you shall suffer. ||4||<br>
  Without money, you cannot buy anything in the store.<br>
  Without a boat, you cannot cross over the ocean.<br>
  Without serving the Guru, everything is lost. ||5||<br>

  But when egotism departs, then the state of supreme dignity is obtained. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The kings act in egotism, and undertake all sorts of expeditions.<br>
  But through their egotism, they are ruined; they die, only to be reborn over and over again. ||2||<br>
  Egotism is overcome only by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  One who restrains his fickle mind subdues the five passions. ||3||<br>
  With the True Lord deep within the self, the Celestial Mansion is intuitively found.<br>

  First, Brahma entered the house of Death.<br>
  Brahma entered the lotus, and searched the nether regions, but he did not find the end of it.<br>

  Whoever is created, shall be destroyed by Death.<br>
  But I am protected by the Lord; I contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All the gods and goddesses are enticed by Maya.<br>

  Grant me, O Lord, the wealth of Your Ambrosial Naam. ||4||<br>
  The people, rulers, leaders and chiefs<br>
  - none of them shall be able to remain in the world.<br>
  Death is inevitable; it strikes the heads of the false. ||5||<br>
  Only the One Lord, the Truest of the True, is permanent.<br>
  He who created and fashioned everything, shall destroy it.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh and meditates on the Lord is honored. ||6||<br>
  The Qazis, Shaykhs and Fakeers in religious robes<br>
  call themselves great; but through their egotism, their bodies are suffering in pain.<br>
  Death does not spare them, without the Support of the True Guru. ||7||<br>
  The trap of Death is hanging over their tongues and eyes.<br>
  Death is over their ears, when they hear talk of evil.<br>
  Without the Shabad, they are plundered, day and night. ||8||<br>
  Death cannot touch those whose hearts are filled with the True Name of the Lord, and who sing the Glories of God.<br>

  Following the Guru's Teachings, one intuitively chants the Name of the True Lord.<br>
  Drinking in this Ambrosial Nectar, and churning it, the essential reality is discerned. ||3||<br>
  Beholding the True Guru, I have received His Teachings.<br>
  I have offered my mind and body, after searching deep within my own being.<br>
  I have come to realize the value of understanding my own soul. ||4||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord, is the most excellent and sublime food.<br>

  I have found God - I am not searching for any other. ||7||<br>
  The Guru has shown me the unseen Mansion of the True Lord.<br>
  His Mansion is eternal and unchanging; it is not a mere reflection of Maya.<br>
  Through truth and contentment, doubt is dispelled. ||8||<br>
  That person, within whose mind the True Lord dwells<br>
  - in his company, one becomes Gurmukh.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Name washes off the pollution. ||9||15||<br>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  One whose consciousness is permeated with the Lord's Name<br>
  - receive the blessing of his darshan in the early light of dawn. ||1||<br>
  If you do not meditate on the Lord, it is your own misfortune.<br>
  In each and every age, the Great Giver is my Lord God. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, the perfect humble beings meditate on the Lord.<br>
  Within their hearts, the unstruck melody vibrates. ||2||<br>
  Those who worship the Lord and love the Lord<br>
  - showering His Mercy, God protects them. ||3||<br>
  Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord, Har, Har<br>
  - gazing upon the blessed vision of their darshan, peace is obtained. ||4||<br>
  Among all beings, the One Lord is pervading.<br>
  The eogtistical, self-willed manmukhs wander in reincarnation. ||5||<br>
  They alone understand, who have found the True Guru.<br>
  Subduing their ego, they receive the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||6||<br>
  How can anyone know of the Union between the being below and the Supreme Being above?<br>
  The Gurmukhs obtain this Union; their minds are reconciliated. ||7||<br>
  I am a worthless sinner, without merit. What merit do I have?<br>
  When God showers His Mercy, servant Nanak is emancipated. ||8||16||<br>
  Sixteen Ashtapadees Of Gwaarayree Gauree||<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan, First Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  As the dairy farmer watches over and protects his cows, so does the Lord cherish and protect us, night and day. He blesses the soul with peace. ||1||<br>
  Please protect me here and hereafter, O Lord, Merciful to the meek.<br>
  I seek Your Sanctuary; please bless me with Your Glance of Grace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wherever I look, there You are. Save me, O Savior Lord!<br>
  You are the Giver, and You are the Enjoyer; You are the Support of the breath of life. ||2||<br>
  According to the karma of past actions, people descend to the depths or rise to the heights, unless they contemplate spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Without the Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the darkness is not dispelled. ||3||<br>
  I have seen the world being destroyed by greed and egotism.<br>
  Only by serving the Guru is God obtained, and the true gate of liberation found. ||4||<br>
  The Mansion of the Infinite Lord's Presence is within the home of one's own being. He is beyond any boundaries.<br>
  Without the Word of the Shabad, nothing shall endure. Through understanding, peace is obtained. ||5||<br>
  What have you brought, and what will you take away, when you are caught by the noose of Death?<br>
  Like the bucket tied to the rope in the well, you are pulled up to the Akaashic Ethers, and then lowered down to the nether regions of the underworld. ||6||<br>
  Follow the Guru's Teachings, and do not forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord; you shall automatically obtain honor.<br>
  Deep within the self is the treasure of the Shabad; it is obtained only by eradicating selfishness and conceit. ||7||<br>
  When God bestows His Glance of Grace, people settle in the Lap of the Virtuous Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, this Union cannot be broken; the true profit is obtained. ||8||1||17||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 079</h2></center>
  Gauree, First Mehl:<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand, and then, the account is settled.<br>
  In each and every heart is the Name of the Immaculate Lord; He is my Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, no one is emancipated. See this, and reflect upon it.<br>
  Even though you may perform hundreds of thousands of rituals, without the Guru, there is only darkness. ||1||Pause||<br>
  What can you say, to one who is blind and without wisdom?<br>
  Without the Guru, the Path cannot be seen. How can anyone proceed? ||2||<br>
  He calls the counterfeit genuine, and does not know the value of the genuine.<br>
  The blind man is known as an appraiser; this Dark Age of Kali Yuga is so strange! ||3||<br>
  The sleeper is said to be awake, and those who are awake are like sleepers.<br>
  The living are said to be dead, and no one mourns for those who have died. ||4||<br>
  One who is coming is said to be going, and one who is gone is said to have come.<br>
  That which belongs to others, he calls his own, but he has no liking for that which is his. ||5||<br>
  That which is sweet is said to be bitter, and the bitter is said to be sweet.<br>
  One who is imbued with the Lord's Love is slandered - his is what I have seen in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||6||<br>
  He serves the maid, and does not see his Lord and Master.<br>
  Churning the water in the pond, no butter is produced. ||7||<br>
  One who understands the meaning of this verse is my Guru.<br>
  O Nanak, one who knows his own self, is infinite and incomparable. ||8||<br>
  He Himself is All-pervading; He Himself misleads the people.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand, that God is contained in all. ||9||2||18||<br>
  Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The pollution of the mind is the love of duality.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, people come and go in reincarnation. ||1||<br>
  The pollution of the self-willed manmukhs will never go away,<br>
  as long as they do not dwell on the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All the created beings are contaminated by emotional attachment;<br>
  they die and are reborn, only to die over and over again. ||2||<br>
  Fire, air and water are polluted.<br>
  The food which is eaten is polluted. ||3||<br>
  The actions of those who do not worship the Lord are polluted.<br>
  Attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind becomes immaculate. ||4||<br>
  Serving the True Guru, pollution is eradicated,<br>
  and then, one does not suffer death and rebirth, or get devoured by death. ||5||<br>
  You may study and examine the Shaastras and the Simritees,<br>
  but without the Name, no one is liberated. ||6||<br>
  Throughout the four ages, the Naam is the ultimate; reflect upon the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only the Gurmukhs cross over. ||7||<br>
  The True Lord does not die; He does not come or go.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains absorbed in the Lord. ||8||1||<br>
  Gauree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Selfless service is the support of the breath of life of the Gurmukh.<br>
  Keep the Dear Lord enshrined in your heart.<br>
  The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||1||<br>
  O Pandit, O religious scholar, read about the Lord, and renounce your corrupt ways.<br>
  The Gurmukh crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 080</h2></center>
  The Gurmukh eradicates egotism from within.<br>
  No filth sticks to the Gurmukh.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind of the Gurmukh. ||2||<br>
  Through karma and Dharma, good actions and righteous faith, the Gurmukh becomes true.<br>
  The Gurmukh burns away egotism and duality.<br>
  The Gurmukh is attuned to the Naam, and is at peace. ||3||<br>
  Instruct your own mind, and understand Him.<br>
  You may preach to other people, but no one will listen.<br>
  The Gurmukh understands, and is always at peace. ||4||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are such clever hypocrites.<br>
  No matter what they do, it is not acceptable.<br>
  They come and go in reincarnation, and find no place of rest. ||5||<br>
  The manmukhs perform their rituals, but they are totally selfish and conceited.<br>
  They sit there, like storks, pretending to meditate.<br>
  Caught by the Messenger of Death, they shall regret and repent in the end. ||6||<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, liberation is not obtained.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one meets the Lord.<br>
  The Guru is the Great Giver, throughout the four ages. ||7||<br>
  For the Gurmukh, the Naam is social status, honor and glorious greatness.<br>
  Maya, the daughter of the ocean, has been slain.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Name, all clever tricks are false. ||8||2||<br>
  Gauree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Learn the Dharma of this age, O Siblings of Destiny;<br>
  all understanding is obtained from the Perfect Guru.<br>
  Here and hereafter, the Lord's Name is our Companion. ||1||<br>
  Learn of the Lord, and contemplate Him in your mind.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, your filth shall be washed away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Through argument and debate, He cannot be found.<br>
  The mind and body are made insipid through the love of duality.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, lovingly attune yourself to the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  This world is polluted with egotism.<br>
  By taking cleansing baths daily at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, egotism is not eliminated.<br>
  Without meeting the Guru, they are tortured by Death. ||3||<br>
  Those humble beings are true, who conquer their ego.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they conquer the five thieves.<br>
  They save themselves, and save all their generations as well. ||4||<br>
  The Actor has staged the drama of emotional attachment to Maya.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs cling blindly to it.<br>
  The Gurmukhs remain detached, and lovingly attune themselves to the Lord. ||5||<br>
  The disguisers put on their various disguises.<br>
  Desire rages within them, and they carry on egotistically.<br>
  They do not understand themselves, and they lose the game of life. ||6||<br>
  Putting on religious robes, they act so clever,<br>
  but they are totally deluded by doubt and emotional attachment to Maya.<br>
  Without serving the Guru, they suffer in terrible pain. ||7||<br>
  Those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, remain detached forever.<br>
  Even as householders, they lovingly attune themselves to the True Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, those who serve the True Guru are blessed and very fortunate. ||8||3||<br>
  Gauree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Brahma is the founder of the study of the Vedas.<br>
  From him emanated the gods, enticed by desire.<br>
  They wander in the three qualities, and they do not dwell within their own home. ||1||<br>
  The Lord has saved me; I have met the True Guru.<br>
  He has implanted devotional worship of the Lord's Name, night and day. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The songs of Brahma entangle people in the three qualities.<br>
  Reading about the debates and disputes, they are hit over the head by the Messenger of Death.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 081</h2></center>
  They do not understand the essence of reality, and they gather their worthless bundles of straw. ||2||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs, in ignorance, take the path of evil.<br>
  They forget the Lord's Name, and in its place, they establish all sorts of rituals.<br>
  They drown in the terrifying world-ocean, in the love of duality. ||3||<br>
  Driven crazy, infatuated by Maya, they call themselves Pandits - religious scholars;<br>
  stained with corruption, they suffer terrible pain.<br>
  The noose of the Messenger of Death is around their necks; they are constantly tormented by death. ||4||<br>
  The Messenger of Death does not even approach the Gurmukhs.<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, they burn away their ego and duality.<br>
  Attuned to the Name, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||5||<br>
  Maya is the slave of the Lord's devotees; it works for them.<br>
  One who falls at their feet attains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>
  He is forever immaculate; he is absorbed in intuitive peace. ||6||<br>
  Those who listen to the Lord's Sermon are seen to be the wealthy people in this world.<br>
  Everyone bows down to them, and adores them, night and day.<br>
  They intuitively savor the Glories of the True Lord within their minds. ||7||<br>
  The Perfect True Guru has revealed the Shabad;<br>
  it eradicates the three qualities, and attunes the consciousness to the fourth state.<br>
  O Nanak, subduing egotism, one is absorbed into God. ||8||4||<br>
  Gauree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Brahma studied the Vedas, but these lead only to debates and disputes.<br>
  He is filled with darkness; he does not understand himself.<br>
  And yet, if he chants the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he finds God. ||1||<br>
  So serve the Guru, and you shall not be consumed by death.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs have been consumed by the love of duality. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Becoming Gurmukh, the sinful mortals are purified.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they find intuitive peace and poise deep within.<br>
  I have found my God, through the Guru's Shabad, and I have been reformed. ||2||<br>
  God Himself unites us in Union with the True Guru,<br>
  when we become pleasing to the Mind of my True God.<br>
  They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, in the poise of celestial peace. ||3||<br>
  Without the True Guru, they are deluded by doubt.<br>
  The blind, self-willed manmukhs constantly eat poison.<br>
  They are beaten by the Messenger of Death with his rod, and they suffer in constant pain. ||4||<br>
  The Messenger of Death does not catch sight of those who enter the Sanctuary of the Lord.<br>
  Subduing egotism, they lovingly center their consciousness on the True Lord.<br>
  They keep their consciousness constantly focused on the Lord's Name. ||5||<br>
  Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are pure and immaculate.<br>
  Merging their minds into the Mind, they conquer the entire world.<br>
  In this way, you too shall find happiness, O my friend. ||6||<br>
  Those who serve the True Guru are blessed with fruitful rewards.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides in their hearts; selfishness and conceit depart from within them.<br>
  The unstruck melody of the Shabad vibrates for them. ||7||<br>
  Who - who has not been purified by the True Guru, O my Siblings of Destiny?<br>
  The devotees are purified, and honored in His Court.<br>
  O Nanak, greatness is in the Lord's Name. ||8||5||<br>
  Gauree, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who speak of the three qualities - their doubts do not depart.<br>
  Their bonds are not broken, and they do not obtain liberation.<br>
  The True Guru is the Bestower of liberation in this age. ||1||<br>
  Those mortals who become Gurmukh give up their doubts.<br>
  The celestial music wells up, when they lovingly attune their consciousness to the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who are controlled by the three qualities have death hovering over their heads.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 082</h2></center>
  They do not remember the Name of the Creator Lord.<br>
  They die, and are reborn, over and over, again and again. ||2||<br>
  Those whose guru is spiritually blind - their doubts are not dispelled.<br>
  Abandoning the Source of all, they have become attached to the love of duality.<br>
  Infected with poison, they are immersed in poison. ||3||<br>
  Believing Maya to be the source of all, they wander in doubt.<br>
  They have forgotten the Dear Lord, and they are in love with duality.<br>
  The supreme status is obtained only by those who are blessed with His Glance of Grace. ||4||<br>
  One who has Truth pervading within, radiates Truth outwardly as well.<br>
  The Truth does not remain hidden, even though one may try to hide it.<br>
  The spiritually wise know this intuitively. ||5||<br>
  The Gurmukhs keep their consciousness lovingly centered on the Lord.<br>
  Ego and Maya are burned away by the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  My True God unites them in His Union. ||6||<br>
  The True Guru, The Giver, preaches the Shabad.<br>
  He controls, and restrains, and holds still the wandering mind.<br>
  Understanding is obtained through the Perfect Guru. ||7||<br>
  The Creator Himself has created the universe; He Himself shall destroy it.<br>
  Without Him, there is no other at all.<br>
  O Nanak, how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this! ||8||6||<br>
  Gauree, Third Mehl:<br>
  The Gurmukhs obtain the Naam, the Priceless Name of the Lord.<br>
  They serve the Name, and through the Name, they are absorbed in intuitive peace and poise.<br>
  With their tongues, they continually sing the Ambrosial Naam.<br>
  They obtain the Lord's Name; the Lord showers His Mercy upon them. ||1||<br>
  Night and day, within your heart, meditate on the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  The Gurmukhs obtain the supreme state of peace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Peace comes to fill the hearts of those<br>
  who, as Gurmukh, sing of the True Lord, the treasure of excellence.<br>
  They become the constant slaves of the slaves of the Lord's slaves.<br>
  Within their households and families, they remain always detached. ||2||<br>
  How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, become Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.<br>
  They alone obtain the supreme treasure.<br>
  Eradicating the three qualities, they become pure.<br>
  They are intuitively absorbed in the True Lord God. ||3||<br>
  Emotional attachment to family does not exist,<br>
  when the True Lord abides within the heart.<br>
  The mind of the Gurmukh is pierced through and held steady.<br>
  One who recognizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command understands the True Lord. ||4||<br>
  You are the Creator Lord - there is no other for me.<br>
  I serve You, and through You, I obtain honor.<br>
  God showers His Mercy, and I sing His Praises.<br>
  The light of the jewel of the Naam permeates the entire world. ||5||<br>
  To the Gurmukhs, the Word of God's Bani seems so sweet.<br>
  Deep within, their hearts blossom forth; night and day, they lovingly center themselves on the Lord.<br>
  The True Lord is intuitively obtained, by His Grace.<br>
  The True Guru is obtained by the destiny of perfect good fortune. ||6||<br>
  Egotism, possessiveness, evil-mindedness and suffering depart,<br>
  when the Lord's Name, the Ocean of Virtue, comes to dwell within the heart.<br>
  The intellect of the Gurmukhs is awakened, and they praise God,<br>
  when the Lord's Lotus Feet come to dwell within the heart. ||7||<br>
  They alone receive the Naam, unto whom it is given.<br>
  The Gurmukhs shed their ego, and merge with the Lord.<br>
  The True Name abides within their hearts.<br>
  O Nanak, they are intuitively absorbed in the True Lord. ||8||7||<br>
  Gauree, Third Mehl:<br>
  The mind has intuitively healed itself, through the Fear of God.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 083</h2></center>
  The mind is attuned to the Word of the Shabad; it is lovingly attuned to the Lord.<br>
  It abides within its own home, in harmony with the Lord's Will. ||1||<br>
  Serving the True Guru, egotistical pride departs,<br>
  and the Lord of the Universe, the Treasure of Excellence, is obtained. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The mind becomes detached and free of desire, when it experiences the Fear of God, through the Shabad.<br>
  My Immaculate God is pervading and contained among all.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one is united in His Union. ||2||<br>
  The slave of the Lord's slave attains peace.<br>
  My Lord God is found in this way.<br>
  By the Grace of the Lord, one comes to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Cursed is that long life, during which love for the Lord's Name is not enshrined.<br>
  Cursed is that comfortable bed which lures one into the darkness of attachment to sexual desire.<br>
  Fruitful is the birth of that person who takes the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||<br>
  Cursed, cursed is that home and family, in which the love of the Lord is not embraced.<br>
  He alone is my friend, who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, there is no other for me. ||5||<br>
  From the True Guru, I have obtained salvation and honor.<br>
  I have meditated on the Name of the Lord, and all my sufferings have been erased.<br>
  I am in constant bliss, lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name. ||6||<br>
  Meeting the Guru, I came to understand my body.<br>
  The fires of ego and desire have been totally quenched.<br>
  Anger has been dispelled, and I have grasped hold of tolerance. ||7||<br>
  The Lord Himself showers His Mercy, and bestows the Naam.<br>
  How rare is that Gurmukh, who receives the jewel of the Naam.<br>
  O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Unknowable, the Incomprehensible. ||8||8||<br>

  O Lord, please shower Your Mercy upon me, and save me!<br>
  O Lord God, please lead me to meet the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, that I may dwell upon the Glorious Praises of the Lord within my heart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those devotees are pleasing to the Lord, who as Gurmukh, walk in harmony with the Way of the Lord's Will.<br>
  Subduing their selfishness and conceit, and performing selfless service, they remain dead while yet alive. ||2||<br>
  The body and the breath of life belong to the One - perform the greatest service to Him.<br>
  Why forget Him from your mind? Keep the Lord enshrined in your heart. ||3||<br>
  Receiving the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one obtains honor; believing in the Naam, one is at peace.<br>
  The Naam is obtained from the True Guru; by His Grace, God is found. ||4||<br>
  They turn their faces away from the True Guru; they continue to wander aimlessly.<br>
  They are not accepted by the earth or the sky; they fall into manure, and rot. ||5||<br>
  This world is deluded by doubt - it has taken the drug of emotional attachment.<br>
  Maya does not draw near those who have met with the True Guru. ||6||<br>
  Those who serve the True Guru are very beautiful; they cast off the filth of selfishness and conceit.<br>

  O my wandering mind, you are like a camel - how will you meet the Lord, your Mother?<br>
  When I found the Guru, by the destiny of perfect good fortune, my Beloved came and embraced me. ||1||<br>

  O camel-like mind, contemplate the Lord, and meditate on the Lord's Name.<br>
  When you are called to answer for your account, the Lord Himself shall release you. ||2||<br>
  O camel-like mind, you were once very pure; the filth of egotism has now attached itself to you.<br>
  Your Beloved Husband is now manifest before you in your own home, but you are separated from Him, and you suffer such pain! ||3||<br>

  Return to your own home, and find the palace of love; meet the Guru, and meet the Lord. ||5||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  When this mind is filled with pride,<br>

  But when he recognizes the Creator Lord,<br>
  then he is free of torment. ||3||<br>
  When he entangles himself in emotional attachment,<br>
  he comes and goes in reincarnation, under the constant gaze of Death.<br>
  But when all his doubts are removed,<br>
  then there is no difference between him and the Supreme Lord God. ||4||<br>
  When he perceives differences,<br>
  then he suffers pain, punishment and sorrow.<br>
  But when he recognizes the One and Only Lord,<br>
  he understands everything. ||5||<br>
  When he runs around for the sake of Maya and riches,<br>
  he is not satisfied, and his desires are not quenched.<br>
  But when he runs away from Maya,<br>
  then the Goddess of Wealth gets up and follows him. ||6||<br>
  When, by His Grace, the True Guru is met,<br>
  the lamp is lit within the temple of the mind.<br>
  When he realizes what victory and defeat really are,<br>
  then he comes to appreciate the true value of his own home. ||7||<br>

  This soul has lived in many wombs.<br>

  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, those who sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy<br>

  Shalok:<br>
  He may be very handsome, born into a highly respected family, very wise, a famous spiritual teacher, prosperous and wealthy;<br>

  He may cook his own food, and never touch anyone else's; he may live in the wilderness like a hermit.<br>
  But if he does not enshrine love for the Lord's Name within his heart,<br>

  Even making millions of efforts, you shall not be accepted in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  You cannot escape to the heavens, or to the nether regions,<br>
  if you are entangled in emotional attachment and the net of Maya.<br>
  All other efforts are punished by the Messenger of Death,<br>
  which accepts nothing at all, except meditation on the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  Chanting the Name of the Lord, sorrow is dispelled.<br>
  O Nanak, chant it with intuitive ease. ||4||<br>
  One who prays for the four cardinal blessings<br>
  should commit himself to the service of the Saints.<br>
  If you wish to erase your sorrows,<br>
  sing the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within your heart.<br>
  If you long for honor for yourself,<br>
  then renounce your ego in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  If you fear the cycle of birth and death,<br>
  then seek the Sanctuary of the Holy.<br>
  Those who thirst for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan<br>
  - Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them. ||5||<br>
  Among all persons, the supreme person is the one<br>
  who gives up his egotistical pride in the Company of the Holy.<br>
  One who sees himself as lowly,<br>
  shall be accounted as the highest of all.<br>
  One whose mind is the dust of all,<br>
  recognizes the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in each and every heart.<br>
  One who eradicates cruelty from within his own mind,<br>
  looks upon all the world as his friend.<br>
  One who looks upon pleasure and pain as one and the same,<br>
  O Nanak, is not affected by sin or virtue. ||6||<br>
  To the poor, Your Name is wealth.<br>
  To the homeless, Your Name is home.<br>
  To the dishonored, You, O God, are honor.<br>
  To all, You are the Giver of gifts.<br>
  O Creator Lord, Cause of causes, O Lord and Master,<br>
  Inner-knower, Searcher of all hearts:<br>
  You alone know Your own condition and state.<br>
  You Yourself, God, are imbued with Yourself.<br>
  You alone can celebrate Your Praises.<br>
  O Nanak, no one else knows. ||7||<br>
  Of all religions, the best religion<br>
  is to chant the Name of the Lord and maintain pure conduct.<br>
  Of all religious rituals, the most sublime ritual<br>
  is to erase the filth of the dirty mind in the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Of all efforts, the best effort<br>
  is to chant the Name of the Lord in the heart, forever.<br>
  Of all speech, the most ambrosial speech<br>
  is to hear the Lord's Praise and chant it with the tongue.<br>
  Of all places, the most sublime place,<br>
  O Nanak, is that heart in which the Name of the Lord abides. ||8||3||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  You worthless, ignorant fool - dwell upon God forever.<br>
  Cherish in your consciousness the One who created you; O Nanak, He alone shall go along with you. ||1||<br>
  ASHTAPADEE:<br>
  Think of the Glory of the All-pervading Lord, O mortal;<br>
  what is your origin, and what is your appearance?<br>
  He who fashioned, adorned and decorated you<br>
  - in the fire of the womb, He preserved you.<br>
  In your infancy, He gave you milk to drink.<br>
  In the flower of your youth, He gave you food, pleasure and understanding.<br>
  As you grow old, family and friends are there to feed you as you rest.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 117</h2></center>
  This worthless person has not appreciated in the least, all the good deeds done for him.<br>
  If you bless him with forgiveness, O Nanak, only then will he be saved. ||1||<br>
  By His Grace, you abide in comfort upon the earth.<br>
  With your children, siblings, friends and spouse, you laugh.<br>
  By His Grace, you drink in cool water.<br>
  You have peaceful breezes and priceless fire.<br>
  By His Grace, you enjoy all sorts of pleasures.<br>
  You are provided with all the necessities of life.<br>
  He gave you hands, feet, ears, eyes and tongue,<br>
  and yet, you forsake Him and attach yourself to others.<br>
  Such sinful mistakes cling to the blind fools;<br>
  Nanak: uplift and save them, God! ||2||<br>
  From beginning to end, He is our Protector,<br>
  and yet, the ignorant do not give their love to Him.<br>
  Serving Him, the nine treasures are obtained,<br>
  and yet, the foolish do not link their minds with Him.<br>
  Our Lord and Master is Ever-present, forever and ever,<br>
  and yet, the spiritually blind believe that He is far away.<br>
  In His service, one obtains honor in the Court of the Lord,<br>
  and yet, the ignorant fool forgets Him.<br>
  Forever and ever, this person makes mistakes;<br>
  O Nanak, the Infinite Lord is our Saving Grace. ||3||<br>
  Forsaking the jewel, they are engrossed with a shell.<br>
  They renounce Truth and embrace falsehood.<br>
  That which passes away, they believe to be permanent.<br>
  That which is immanent, they believe to be far off.<br>
  They struggle for what they must eventually leave.<br>
  They turn away from the Lord, their Help and Support, who is always with them.<br>
  They wash off the sandalwood paste;<br>
  like donkeys, they are in love with the mud.<br>
  They have fallen into the deep, dark pit.<br>
  Nanak: lift them up and save them, O Merciful Lord God! ||4||<br>
  They belong to the human species, but they act like animals.<br>
  They curse others day and night.<br>
  Outwardly, they wear religious robes, but within is the filth of Maya.<br>
  They cannot conceal this, no matter how hard they try.<br>
  Outwardly, they display knowledge, meditation and purification,<br>
  but within clings the dog of greed.<br>
  The fire of desire rages within; outwardly they apply ashes to their bodies.<br>
  There is a stone around their neck - how can they cross the unfathomable ocean?<br>
  Those, within whom God Himself abides<br>
  - O Nanak, those humble beings are intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||5||<br>
  By listening, how can the blind find the path?<br>
  Take hold of his hand, and then he can reach his destination.<br>
  How can a riddle be understood by the deaf?<br>
  Say 'night', and he thinks you said 'day'.<br>
  How can the mute sing the Songs of the Lord?<br>
  He may try, but his voice will fail him.<br>
  How can the cripple climb up the mountain?<br>
  He simply cannot go there.<br>
  O Creator, Lord of Mercy - Your humble servant prays;<br>
  Nanak: by Your Grace, please save me. ||6||<br>
  The Lord, our Help and Support, is always with us, but the mortal does not remember Him.<br>
  He shows love to his enemies.<br>
  He lives in a castle of sand.<br>
  He enjoys the games of pleasure and the tastes of Maya.<br>
  He believes them to be permanent - this is the belief of his mind.<br>
  Death does not even come to mind for the fool.<br>
  Hate, conflict, sexual desire, anger, emotional attachment,<br>
  falsehood, corruption, immense greed and deceit:<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 118</h2></center>
  So many lifetimes are wasted in these ways.<br>
  Nanak: uplift them, and redeem them, O Lord - show Your Mercy! ||7||<br>
  You are our Lord and Master; to You, I offer this prayer.<br>
  This body and soul are all Your property.<br>
  You are our mother and father; we are Your children.<br>
  In Your Grace, there are so many joys!<br>
  No one knows Your limits.<br>
  O Highest of the High, Most Generous God,<br>
  the whole creation is strung on Your thread.<br>
  That which has come from You is under Your Command.<br>
  You alone know Your state and extent.<br>
  Nanak, Your slave, is forever a sacrifice. ||8||4||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  One who renounces God the Giver, and attaches himself to other affairs<br>
  - O Nanak, he shall never succeed. Without the Name, he shall lose his honor. ||1||<br>
  ASHTAPADEE:<br>
  He obtains ten things, and puts them behind him;<br>
  for the sake of one thing withheld, he forfeits his faith.<br>
  But what if that one thing were not given, and the ten were taken away?<br>
  Then, what could the fool say or do?<br>
  Our Lord and Master cannot be moved by force.<br>
  Unto Him, bow forever in adoration.<br>
  That one, unto whose mind God seems sweet<br>
  - all pleasures come to abide in his mind.<br>
  One who abides by the Lord's Will,<br>
  O Nanak, obtains all things. ||1||<br>
  God the Banker gives endless capital to the mortal,<br>
  who eats, drinks and expends it with pleasure and joy.<br>
  If some of this capital is later taken back by the Banker,<br>
  the ignorant person shows his anger.<br>
  He himself destroys his own credibility,<br>
  and he shall not again be trusted.<br>
  When one offers to the Lord, that which belongs to the Lord,<br>
  and willingly abides by the Will of God's Order,<br>
  the Lord will make him happy four times over.<br>
  O Nanak, our Lord and Master is merciful forever. ||2||<br>
  The many forms of attachment to Maya shall surely pass away - know that they are transitory.<br>
  People fall in love with the shade of the tree,<br>
  and when it passes away, they feel regret in their minds.<br>
  Whatever is seen, shall pass away;<br>
  and yet, the blindest of the blind cling to it.<br>
  One who gives her love to a passing traveler<br>
  - nothing shall come into her hands in this way.<br>
  O mind, the love of the Name of the Lord bestows peace.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord, in His Mercy, unites us with Himself. ||3||<br>
  False are body, wealth, and all relations.<br>
  False are ego, possessiveness and Maya.<br>
  False are power, youth, wealth and property.<br>
  False are sexual desire and wild anger.<br>
  False are chariots, elephants, horses and expensive clothes.<br>
  False is the love of gathering wealth, and reveling in the sight of it.<br>
  False are deception, emotional attachment and egotistical pride.<br>
  False are pride and self-conceit.<br>
  Only devotional worship is permanent, and the Sanctuary of the Holy.<br>
  Nanak lives by meditating, meditating on the Lotus Feet of the Lord. ||4||<br>
  False are the ears which listen to the slander of others.<br>
  False are the hands which steal the wealth of others.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 119</h2></center>
  False are the eyes which gaze upon the beauty of another's wife.<br>
  False is the tongue which enjoys delicacies and external tastes.<br>
  False are the feet which run to do evil to others.<br>
  False is the mind which covets the wealth of others.<br>
  False is the body which does not do good to others.<br>
  False is the nose which inhales corruption.<br>
  Without understanding, everything is false.<br>
  Fruitful is the body, O Nanak, which takes to the Lord's Name. ||5||<br>
  The life of the faithless cynic is totally useless.<br>
  Without the Truth, how can anyone be pure?<br>
  Useless is the body of the spiritually blind, without the Name of the Lord.<br>
  From his mouth, a foul smell issues forth.<br>
  Without the remembrance of the Lord, day and night pass in vain,<br>
  like the crop which withers without rain.<br>
  Without meditation on the Lord of the Universe, all works are in vain,<br>
  like the wealth of a miser, which lies useless.<br>
  Blessed, blessed are those, whose hearts are filled with the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them. ||6||<br>
  He says one thing, and does something else.<br>
  There is no love in his heart, and yet with his mouth he talks tall.<br>
  The Omniscient Lord God is the Knower of all.<br>
  He is not impressed by outward display.<br>
  One who does not practice what he preaches to others,<br>
  shall come and go in reincarnation, through birth and death.<br>
  One whose inner being is filled with the Formless Lord<br>
  - by his teachings, the world is saved.<br>
  Those who are pleasing to You, God, know You.<br>
  Nanak falls at their feet. ||7||<br>
  Offer your prayers to the Supreme Lord God, who knows everything.<br>
  He Himself values His own creatures.<br>
  He Himself, by Himself, makes the decisions.<br>
  To some, He appears far away, while others perceive Him near at hand.<br>
  He is beyond all efforts and clever tricks.<br>
  He knows all the ways and means of the soul.<br>
  Those with whom He is pleased are attached to the hem of His robe.<br>
  He is pervading all places and interspaces.<br>
  Those upon whom He bestows His favor, become His servants.<br>
  Each and every moment, O Nanak, meditate on the Lord. ||8||5||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment - may these be gone, and egotism as well.<br>
  Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God; please bless me with Your Grace, O Divine Guru. ||1||<br>

  Shalok:<br>
  One who enshrines the Naam within the heart,<br>
  who sees the Lord God in all,<br>

  - O Nanak, such a one is the true 'touch-nothing Saint', who emancipates everyone. ||1||<br>

  who, by Guru's Grace, renounces corruption,<br>

  who conquers his sexual instincts and is free of the five sinful passions<br>
  - O Nanak, among millions, there is scarcely one such 'touch-nothing Saint'. ||1||<br>
  The true Vaishnaav, the devotee of Vishnu, is the one with whom God is thoroughly pleased.<br>
  He dwells apart from Maya.<br>
  Performing good deeds, he does not seek rewards.<br>
  Spotlessly pure is the religion of such a Vaishnaav;<br>
  he has no desire for the fruits of his labors.<br>
  He is absorbed in devotional worship and the singing of Kirtan, the songs of the Lord's Glory.<br>
  Within his mind and body, he meditates in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  He is kind to all creatures.<br>
  He holds fast to the Naam, and inspires others to chant it.<br>
  O Nanak, such a Vaishnaav obtains the supreme status. ||2||<br>
  The true Bhagaautee, the devotee of Adi Shakti, loves the devotional worship of God.<br>
  He forsakes the company of all wicked people.<br>
  All doubts are removed from his mind.<br>

  He constantly performs the service of the Supreme Lord God.<br>
  He dedicates his mind and body to the Love of God.<br>
  The Lotus Feet of the Lord abide in his heart.<br>

  He is a true Pandit, a religious scholar, who instructs his own mind.<br>
  He searches for the Lord's Name within his own soul.<br>
  He drinks in the Exquisite Nectar of the Lord's Name.<br>
  By that Pandit's teachings, the world lives.<br>

  The Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra, is spiritual wisdom for everyone.<br>
  Anyone, from any class, may chant the Naam.<br>
  Whoever chants it, is emancipated.<br>
  And yet, rare are those who attain it, in the Company of the Holy.<br>
  By His Grace, He enshrines it within.<br>
  Even beasts, ghosts and the stone-hearted are saved.<br>
  The Naam is the panacea, the remedy to cure all ills.<br>
  Singing the Glory of God is the embodiment of bliss and emancipation.<br>
  It cannot be obtained by any religious rituals.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone obtains it, whose karma is so pre-ordained. ||5||<br>
  One whose mind is a home for the Supreme Lord God<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 125</h2></center>

  He comes to have the Vision of the Lord, the Supreme Soul.<br>
  Deeming himself to be the slave of the Lord's slaves, he obtains it.<br>
  He knows the Lord to be Ever-present, close at hand.<br>
  Such a servant is honored in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  To His servant, He Himself shows His Mercy.<br>
  Such a servant understands everything.<br>
  Amidst all, his soul is unattached.<br>
  Such is the way, O Nanak, of the Lord's servant. ||6||<br>
  One who, in his soul, loves the Will of God,<br>
  is said to be Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.<br>
  As is joy, so is sorrow to him.<br>
  He is in eternal bliss, and is not separated from God.<br>
  As is gold, so is dust to him.<br>
  As is ambrosial nectar, so is bitter poison to him.<br>
  As is honor, so is dishonor.<br>
  As is the beggar, so is the king.<br>
  Whatever God ordains, that is his way.<br>
  O Nanak, that being is known as Jivan Mukta. ||7||<br>
  All places belong to the Supreme Lord God.<br>
  According to the homes in which they are placed, so are His creatures named.<br>
  He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of causes.<br>
  Whatever pleases God, ultimately comes to pass.<br>
  He Himself is All-pervading, in endless waves.<br>
  The playful sport of the Supreme Lord God cannot be known.<br>
  As the understanding is given, so is one enlightened.<br>
  The Supreme Lord God, the Creator, is eternal and everlasting.<br>
  Forever, forever and ever, He is merciful.<br>

  Tell me - what can a mere mortal do?<br>
  Whatever pleases God is what He causes us to do.<br>
  If it were in our hands, we would grab up everything.<br>
  Whatever pleases God - that is what He does.<br>
  Through ignorance, people are engrossed in corruption.<br>
  If they knew better, they would save themselves.<br>

  There is no power in the hands of mortal beings;<br>
  the Doer, the Cause of causes is the Lord of all.<br>

  Sometimes, this being attains the Company of the Holy.<br>
  From that place, he does not have to come back again.<br>
  The light of spiritual wisdom dawns within.<br>
  That place does not perish.<br>
  The mind and body are imbued with the Love of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.<br>
  He dwells forever with the Supreme Lord God.<br>
  As water comes to blend with water,<br>
  his light blends into the Light.<br>
  Reincarnation is ended, and eternal peace is found.<br>
  Nanak is forever a sacrifice to God. ||8||11||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  The humble beings abide in peace; subduing egotism, they are meek.<br>
  The very proud and arrogant persons, O Nanak, are consumed by their own pride. ||1||<br>

  One who, by Guru's Grace, eliminates his ego,<br>
  O Nanak, becomes acceptable in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  If someone does millions of good deeds, while acting in ego,<br>
  he shall incur only trouble; all this is in vain.<br>
  If someone performs great penance, while acting in selfishness and conceit,<br>
  he shall be reincarnated into heaven and hell, over and over again.<br>
  He makes all sorts of efforts, but his soul is still not softened<br>
  - how can he go to the Court of the Lord?<br>
  One who calls himself good<br>
  - goodness shall not draw near him.<br>
  One whose mind is the dust of all<br>
  - says Nanak, his reputation is spotlessly pure. ||3||<br>
  As long as someone thinks that he is the one who acts,<br>
  he shall have no peace.<br>
  As long as this mortal thinks that he is the one who does things,<br>

  Earning a thousand, he runs after a hundred thousand.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 129</h2></center>
  Satisfaction is not obtained by chasing after Maya.<br>
  He may enjoy all sorts of corrupt pleasures,<br>
  but he is still not satisfied; he indulges again and again, wearing himself out, until he dies.<br>
  Without contentment, no one is satisfied.<br>
  Like the objects in a dream, all his efforts are in vain.<br>
  Through the love of the Naam, all peace is obtained.<br>
  Only a few obtain this, by great good fortune.<br>
  He Himself is Himself the Cause of causes.<br>
  Forever and ever, O Nanak, chant the Lord's Name. ||5||<br>
  The Doer, the Cause of causes, is the Creator Lord.<br>
  What deliberations are in the hands of mortal beings?<br>
  As God casts His Glance of Grace, they come to be.<br>
  God Himself, of Himself, is unto Himself.<br>
  Whatever He created, was by His Own Pleasure.<br>
  He is far from all, and yet with all.<br>
  He understands, He sees, and He passes judgment.<br>
  He Himself is the One, and He Himself is the many.<br>

  True, True, True is God, our Lord and Master.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, some speak of Him.<br>
  True, True, True is the Creator of all.<br>
  Out of millions, scarcely anyone knows Him.<br>

  Shalok:<br>
  After wandering and wandering, O God, I have come, and entered Your Sanctuary.<br>
  This is Nanak's prayer, O God: please, attach me to Your devotional service. ||1||<br>
  ASHTAPADEE:<br>
  I am a beggar; I beg for this gift from You:<br>
  please, by Your Mercy, Lord, give me Your Name.<br>
  I ask for the dust of the feet of the Holy.<br>
  O Supreme Lord God, please fulfill my yearning;<br>
  may I sing the Glorious Praises of God forever and ever.<br>
  With each and every breath, may I meditate on You, O God.<br>
  May I enshrine affection for Your Lotus Feet.<br>
  May I perform devotional worship to God each and every day.<br>
  You are my only Shelter, my only Support.<br>
  Nanak asks for the most sublime, the Naam, the Name of God. ||1||<br>
  By God's Gracious Glance, there is great peace.<br>
  Rare are those who obtain the juice of the Lord's essence.<br>
  Those who taste it are satisfied.<br>
  They are fulfilled and realized beings - they do not waver.<br>
  They are totally filled to over-flowing with the sweet delight of His Love.<br>
  Spiritual delight wells up within, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Taking to His Sanctuary, they forsake all others.<br>
  Deep within, they are enlightened, and they center themselves on Him, day and night.<br>
  Most fortunate are those who meditate on God.<br>
  O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, they are at peace. ||2||<br>
  The wishes of the Lord's servant are fulfilled.<br>
  From the True Guru, the pure teachings are obtained.<br>
  Unto His humble servant, God has shown His kindness.<br>
  He has made His servant eternally happy.<br>
  The bonds of His humble servant are cut away, and he is liberated.<br>
  The pains of birth and death, and doubt are gone.<br>
  Desires are satisfied, and faith is fully rewarded,<br>
  imbued forever with His all-pervading peace.<br>
  He is His - he merges in Union with Him.<br>
  Nanak is absorbed in devotional worship of the Naam. ||3||<br>
  Why forget Him, who does not overlook our efforts?<br>
  Why forget Him, who acknowledges what we do?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 140</h2></center>
  Why forget Him, who has given us everything?<br>
  Why forget Him, who is the Life of the living beings?<br>
  Why forget Him, who preserves us in the fire of the womb?<br>
  By Guru's Grace, rare is the one who realizes this.<br>
  Why forget Him, who lifts us up out of corruption?<br>
  Those separated from Him for countless lifetimes, are re-united with Him once again.<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, this essential reality is understood.<br>
  O Nanak, God's humble servants meditate on Him. ||4||<br>
  O friends, O Saints, make this your work.<br>
  Renounce everything else, and chant the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Meditate, meditate, meditate in remembrance of Him, and find peace.<br>
  Chant the Naam yourself, and inspire others to chant it.<br>
  By loving devotional worship, you shall cross over the world-ocean.<br>
  Without devotional meditation, the body will be just ashes.<br>
  All joys and comforts are in the treasure of the Naam.<br>
  Even the drowning can reach the place of rest and safety.<br>
  All sorrows shall vanish.<br>
  O Nanak, chant the Naam, the treasure of excellence. ||5||<br>
  Love and affection, and the taste of yearning, have welled up within;<br>
  within my mind and body, this is my purpose:<br>
  beholding with my eyes His Blessed Vision, I am at peace.<br>
  My mind blossoms forth in ecstasy, washing the feet of the Holy.<br>
  The minds and bodies of His devotees are infused with His Love.<br>
  Rare is the one who obtains their company.<br>
  Show Your mercy - please, grant me this one request:<br>
  by Guru's Grace, may I chant the Naam.<br>
  His Praises cannot be spoken;<br>
  O Nanak, He is contained among all. ||6||<br>
  God, the Forgiving Lord, is kind to the poor.<br>
  He loves His devotees, and He is always merciful to them.<br>
  The Patron of the patronless, the Lord of the Universe, the Sustainer of the world,<br>
  the Nourisher of all beings.<br>
  The Primal Being, the Creator of the Creation.<br>
  The Support of the breath of life of His devotees.<br>
  Whoever meditates on Him is sanctified,<br>
  focusing the mind in loving devotional worship.<br>
  I am unworthy, lowly and ignorant.<br>
  Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, O Supreme Lord God. ||7||<br>
  Everything is obtained: the heavens, liberation and deliverance,<br>
  if one sings the Lord's Glories, even for an instant.<br>
  So many realms of power, pleasures and great glories,<br>
  come to one whose mind is pleased with the Sermon of the Lord's Name.<br>
  Abundant foods, clothes and music<br>
  come to one whose tongue continually chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har.<br>
  His actions are good, he is glorious and wealthy;<br>
  the Mantra of the Perfect Guru dwells within his heart.<br>
  O God, grant me a home in the Company of the Holy.<br>
  All pleasures, O Nanak, are so revealed. ||8||20||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  He possesses all qualities; He transcends all qualities; He is the Formless Lord. He Himself is in Primal Samaadhi.<br>
  Through His Creation, O Nanak, He meditates on Himself. ||1||<br>
  ASHTAPADEE:<br>
  When this world had not yet appeared in any form,<br>
  who then committed sins and performed good deeds?<br>
  When the Lord Himself was in Profound Samaadhi,<br>
  then against whom were hate and jealousy directed?<br>
  When there was no color or shape to be seen,<br>
  then who experienced joy and sorrow?<br>
  When the Supreme Lord Himself was Himself All-in-all,<br>
  then where was emotional attachment, and who had doubts?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 141</h2></center>
  He Himself has staged His own drama;<br>
  O Nanak, there is no other Creator. ||1||<br>
  When there was only God the Master,<br>
  then who was called bound or liberated?<br>
  When there was only the Lord, Unfathomable and Infinite,<br>
  then who entered hell, and who entered heaven?<br>
  When God was without attributes, in absolute poise,<br>
  then where was mind and where was matter - where was Shiva and Shakti?<br>
  When He held His Own Light unto Himself,<br>
  then who was fearless, and who was afraid?<br>
  He Himself is the Performer in His own plays;<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord Master is Unfathomable and Infinite. ||2||<br>
  When the Immortal Lord was seated at ease,<br>
  then where was birth, death and dissolution?<br>
  When there was only God, the Perfect Creator,<br>
  then who was afraid of death?<br>
  When there was only the One Lord, unmanifest and incomprehensible,<br>
  then who was called to account by the recording scribes of the conscious and the subconscious?<br>
  When there was only the Immaculate, Incomprehensible, Unfathomable Master,<br>
  then who was emancipated, and who was held in bondage?<br>
  He Himself, in and of Himself, is the most wonderful.<br>
  O Nanak, He Himself created His Own Form. ||3||<br>
  When there was only the Immaculate Being, the Lord of beings,<br>
  there was no filth, so what was there to be washed clean?<br>
  When there was only the Pure, Formless Lord in Nirvaanaa,<br>
  then who was honored, and who was dishonored?<br>
  When there was only the Form of the Lord of the Universe,<br>
  then who was tainted by fraud and sin?<br>
  When the Embodiment of Light was immersed in His Own Light,<br>
  then who was hungry, and who was satisfied?<br>
  He is the Cause of causes, the Creator Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, the Creator is beyond calculation. ||4||<br>
  When His Glory was contained within Himself,<br>
  then who was mother, father, friend, child or sibling?<br>
  When all power and wisdom was latent within Him,<br>
  then where were the Vedas and the scriptures, and who was there to read them?<br>
  When He kept Himself, All-in-all, unto His Own Heart,<br>
  then who considered omens to be good or bad?<br>
  When He Himself was lofty, and He Himself was near at hand,<br>
  then who was called master, and who was called disciple?<br>
  We are wonder-struck at the wondrous wonder of the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, He alone knows His own state. ||5||<br>
  When the Undeceiveable, Impenetrable, Inscrutable One was self-absorbed,<br>
  then who was swayed by Maya?<br>
  When He paid homage to Himself,<br>
  then the three qualities were not prevailing.<br>
  When there was only the One, the One and Only Lord God,<br>
  then who was not anxious, and who felt anxiety?<br>
  When He Himself was satisfied with Himself,<br>
  then who spoke and who listened?<br>
  He is vast and infinite, the highest of the high.<br>
  O Nanak, He alone can reach Himself. ||6||<br>
  When He Himself fashioned the visible world of the creation,<br>
  he made the world subject to the three dispositions.<br>
  Sin and virtue then began to be spoken of.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 142</h2></center>
  Some have gone to hell, and some yearn for paradise.<br>
  Worldly snares and entanglements of Maya,<br>
  egotism, attachment, doubt and loads of fear;<br>
  pain and pleasure, honor and dishonor<br>
  - these came to be described in various ways.<br>
  He Himself creates and beholds His own drama.<br>
  He winds up the drama, and then, O Nanak, He alone remains. ||7||<br>
  Wherever the Eternal Lord's devotee is, He Himself is there.<br>
  He unfolds the expanse of His creation for the glory of His Saint.<br>
  He Himself is the Master of both worlds.<br>
  His Praise is to Himself alone.<br>
  He Himself performs and plays His amusements and games.<br>
  He Himself enjoys pleasures, and yet He is unaffected and untouched.<br>
  He attaches whomever He pleases to His Name.<br>
  He causes whomever He pleases to play in His play.<br>
  He is beyond calculation, beyond measure, uncountable and unfathomable.<br>
  As You inspire him to speak, O Lord, so does servant Nanak speak. ||8||21||<br>

  He Himself is the speaker, and He Himself is the listener.<br>
  He Himself is the One, and He Himself is the many.<br>
  When it pleases Him, He creates the world.<br>
  As He pleases, He absorbs it back into Himself.<br>
  Without You, nothing can be done.<br>

  One whom God Himself inspires to understand<br>
  - that person obtains the True Name.<br>
  He looks impartially upon all, and he knows the essential reality.<br>
  O Nanak, he conquers the whole world. ||1||<br>
  All beings and creatures are in His Hands.<br>
  He is Merciful to the meek, the Patron of the patronless.<br>
  No one can kill those who are protected by Him.<br>
  One who is forgotten by God, is already dead.<br>
  Leaving Him, where else could anyone go?<br>
  Over the heads of all is the One, the Immaculate King.<br>

  Whoever pleases Him, He blends into Himself.<br>
  They perform His devotional service and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  With heart-felt faith, they believe in Him.<br>
  O Nanak, they realize the One, the Creator Lord. ||3||<br>

  His hopes do not go in vain.<br>
  The servant's purpose is to serve;<br>
  obeying the Lord's Command, the supreme status is obtained.<br>
  Beyond this, he has no other thought.<br>

  They wander endlessly in heaven and hell, until death annihilates them.<br>
  In pleasure and pain and worldly cynicism, they pass their lives acting in ego.<br>
  They do not know the One who created them; they think up all sorts of schemes and plans.<br>
  Their minds and bodies are distracted by pleasure and pain, and their fever never departs.<br>
  They do not realize the glorious radiance of the Supreme Lord God, the Perfect Lord and Master.<br>
  So many are being drowned in emotional attachment and doubt; they dwell in the most horrible hell.<br>

  The many colors and scents of flowers - all worldly deceptions are transitory and false.<br>
  People do not see, and they do not understand; they do not reflect upon anything.<br>
  The world is pierced through with attachment to tastes and pleasures, engrossed in ignorance.<br>
  Those who perform empty religious rituals will be born, only to die again. They wander through endless incarnations.<br>
  They do not meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord; their minds do not understand.<br>

  The thirteenth day of the lunar cycle: The world is in the fever of the three qualities.<br>
  It comes and goes, and is reincarnated in hell.<br>
  Meditation on the Lord, Har, Har, does not enter into the minds of the people.<br>
  They do not sing the Praises of God, the Ocean of peace, even for an instant.<br>
  This body is the embodiment of pleasure and pain.<br>

  By day, people practice corruption, wearing themselves out.<br>
  And then with sleep in their eyes, they mutter in dreams.<br>

  Taking to the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God, his comings and goings in reincarnation are ended.<br>
  He saves himself, along with his family, chanting the Praises of God, the Lord of the Universe.<br>

  He is the Support of His Saints, with the Power to give Sanctuary. Twenty-four hours a day, I bow in reverence to Him.<br>
  His Unspoken Speech cannot be understood; I meditate on the Feet of the Lord.<br>
  He is the Saving Grace of sinners, the Master of the masterless; Nanak has entered God's Sanctuary. ||16||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  My pain is gone, and my sorrows have departed, since I took to the Sanctuary of the Lord, my King.<br>
  I have obtained the fruits of my mind's desires, O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||17||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Some sing, some listen, and some contemplate;<br>

  Their sinful mistakes are erased, and they become pure; the filth of countless incarnations is washed away.<br>
  In this world and the next, their faces shall be radiant; they shall not be touched by Maya.<br>
  They are intuitively wise, and they are Vaishnaavs, worshippers of Vishnu; they are spiritually wise, wealthy and prosperous.<br>
  They are spiritual heros, of noble birth, who vibrate upon the Lord God.<br>
  The Kh'shatriyas, the Brahmins, the low-caste Soodras, the Vaisha workers and the outcast pariahs are all saved,<br>
  meditating on the Lord. Nanak is the dust of the feet of those who know his God. ||17||<br>

  Egotism and Maya are total poison; in these, people continually suffer loss in this world.<br>
  The Gurmukh earns the profit of the wealth of the Lord's Name, contemplating the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  The poisonous filth of egotism is removed, when one enshrines the Ambrosial Name of the Lord within the heart.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 151</h2></center>
  All the Gurmukh's affairs are brought to perfect completion; the Lord has showered him with His Mercy.<br>
  O Nanak, one who meets the Primal Lord remains blended with the Lord, the Creator Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You are True, O True Lord and Master. You are the Truest of the True, O Lord of the World.<br>
  Everyone meditates on You; everyone falls at Your Feet.<br>
  Your Praises are graceful and beautiful; You save those who speak them.<br>
  You reward the Gurmukhs, who are absorbed in the True Name.<br>
  O my Great Lord and Master, great is Your glorious greatness. ||1||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Without the Name, all other praise and speech is insipid and tasteless.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs praise their own egos; their attachment to egotism is useless.<br>
  Those whom they praise, die; they all waste away in conflict.<br>
  O servant Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Embodiment of Supreme Bliss. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  O True Guru, tell me of my Lord God, that I may meditate on the Naam within my mind.<br>

  Pauree:<br>
  You Yourself are the Formless Lord, the Immaculate Lord, our Sovereign King.<br>
  Those who meditate on You, O True Lord with one-pointed mind, are rid of all their pain.<br>
  You have no equal, next to whom I might sit and speak of You.<br>

  O my True Lord and Master, Your Name is the Truest of the True. ||2||<br>

  Deep within the mind is the disease of ego; the self-willed manmukhs, the evil beings, are deluded by doubt.<br>
  O Nanak, this disease is eradicated, only when one meets the True Guru, our Holy Friend. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The mind and body of the Gurmukh are imbued with the Love of the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue.<br>
  Servant Nanak has taken to the Sanctuary of the Lord. Hail to the Guru, who has united me with the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You are the Personification of Creativity, the Inaccessible Lord. With whom should I compare You?<br>
  If there was anyone else as great as You, I would name him; You alone are like Yourself.<br>
  You are the One, permeating each and every heart; You are revealed to the Gurmukh.<br>
  You are the True Lord and Master of all; You are the Highest of all.<br>
  Whatever You do, O True Lord - that is what happens, so why should we grieve? ||3||<br>

  The True Guru is the Merciful Giver; He is always compassionate.<br>
  The True Guru has no hatred within Him; He beholds the One God everywhere.<br>
  Anyone who directs hate against the One who has no hate, shall never be satisfied within.<br>
  The True Guru wishes everyone well; how can anything bad happen to Him?<br>
  As one feels towards the True Guru, so are the rewards he receives.<br>
  O Nanak, the Creator knows everything; nothing can be hidden from Him. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  One who has been made great by his Lord and Master - know him to be great!<br>
  By His Pleasure, the Lord and Master forgives those who are pleasing to His Mind.<br>
  One who tries to compete with Him is a senseless fool.<br>
  One who is united with the Lord by the True Guru, sings His Praises and speaks His Glories.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Lord is True; one who understands Him is absorbed in Truth. ||5||<br>

  If someone slanders the Perfect True Guru, he will be rebuked and reproached by the whole world.<br>
  The Lord Himself abides within the True Guru; He Himself is His Protector.<br>
  Blessed, Blessed is the Guru, who sings the Glories of God. Unto Him, I bow forever and ever in deepest reverence.<br>
  Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to those who have meditated on the Creator Lord. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  He Himself made the earth; He Himself made the sky.<br>

  Pauree:<br>
  You, O True Lord and Master, are True; the Truth is pleasing to the True One.<br>
  The Messenger of Death does not even approach those who praise You, O True Lord.<br>
  Their faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord; the Lord is pleasing to their hearts.<br>
  The false ones are left behind; because of the falsehood and deceit in their hearts, they suffer in terrible pain.<br>
  Black are the faces of the false; the false remain just false. ||6||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The True Guru is the field of Dharma; as one plants the seeds there, so are the fruits obtained.<br>
  The GurSikhs plant ambrosial nectar, and obtain the Lord as their ambrosial fruit.<br>
  Their faces are radiant in this world and the next; in the Court of the Lord, they are robed with honor.<br>
  Some have cruelty in their hearts - they constantly act in cruelty; as they plant, so are the fruits which they eat.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 153</h2></center>
  When the True Guru, the Tester, observes with His Glance, the selfish ones are all exposed.<br>
  As one thinks, so does he receive, and so does the Lord make him known.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord and Master is pervading at both ends; He continually acts, and beholds His own play. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The mortal is of one mind - whatever he dedicates it to, in that he is successful.<br>
  Some talk a lot, but they eat only that which is in their own homes.<br>
  Without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained, and egotism does not depart from within.<br>
  Suffering and hunger cling to the egotistical people; they hold out their hands and beg from door to door.<br>
  Their falsehood and fraud cannot remain concealed; their false appearances fall off in the end.<br>
  One who has such pre-ordained destiny comes to meet God through the True Guru.<br>
  Just as iron is transmuted into gold by the touch of the Philosopher's Stone, so are people transformed by joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.<br>
  O God, You are the Master of servant Nanak; as it pleases You, You lead him. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  One who serves the Lord with all his heart - the Lord Himself unites him with Himself.<br>
  He enters into a partnership with virtue and merit, and burns off all his demerits with the fire of the Shabad.<br>
  Demerits are purchased cheap, like straw; he alone gathers merit, who is so blessed by the True Lord.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has erased my demerits, and revealed my virtuous merits.<br>
  The Gurmukh chants the glorious greatness of the great Lord God. ||7||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Great is the greatness within the True Guru, who meditates night and day on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  The repetition of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is his purity and self-restraint; with the Name of the Lord, He is satisfied.<br>
  The Lord's Name is His power, and the Lord's Name is His Royal Court; the Lord's Name protects Him.<br>
  One who centers his consciousness and worships the Guru, obtains the fruits of his mind's desires.<br>
  But one who slanders the Perfect True Guru, shall be killed and destroyed by the Creator.<br>
  This opportunity shall not come into his hands again; he must eat what he himself has planted.<br>
  He shall be taken to the most horrible hell, with his face blackened like a thief, and a noose around his neck.<br>
  But if he should again take to the Sanctuary of the True Guru, and meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, then he shall be saved.<br>
  Nanak speaks and proclaims the Lord's Story; as it pleases the Creator, so does he speak. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  One who does not obey the Hukam, the Command of the Perfect Guru - that self-willed manmukh is plundered by his ignorance and poisoned by Maya.<br>
  Within him is falsehood, and he sees everyone else as false; the Lord has tied these useless conflicts around his neck.<br>
  He babbles on and on, but the words he speaks please no one.<br>
  He wanders from house to house like an abandoned woman; whoever associates with him is stained by the mark of evil as well.<br>
  Those who become Gurmukh avoid him; they forsake his company and sit hear the Guru.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 154</h2></center>
  O chosen people, O self-elect, one who does not publicly affirm his Guru is not a good person; he loses all his profits and capital.<br>
  People used to chant and recite the Shaastras and the Vedas, O Nanak, but now the Words of the Perfect Guru have come to be the most exalted of all.<br>
  The glorious greatness of the Perfect Guru is pleasing to the GurSikh; the self-willed manmukhs have lost this opportunity. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The True Lord is truly the greatest of all; he alone obtains Him, who is anointed by the Guru.<br>
  He is the True Guru, who meditates on the True Lord. The True Lord and the True Guru are truly One.<br>
  He is the True Guru, the Primal Being, who has totally conquered his five passions.<br>
  One who does not serve the True Guru, and who praises himself, is filled with falsehood within. Cursed, cursed is his ugly face.<br>
  His words are not pleasing to anyone; his face is blackened, and he is separated from the True Guru. ||8||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Everyone is the field of the Lord God; the Lord Himself cultivates this field.<br>
  The Gurmukh grows the crop of forgiveness, while the self-willed manmukh loses even his roots.<br>
  They all plant for their own good, but the Lord causes to grow only that field with which He is pleased.<br>
  The GurSikh plants the seed of the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar, and obtains the Lord's Ambrosial Naam as his Ambrosial Fruit.<br>
  The mouse of Death is continually gnawing away at the crop, but the Creator Lord has beaten it off and driven it away.<br>
  The farm was successful, by the Love of the Lord, and the crop was produced by God's Grace.<br>
  He has removed all the burning and anxiety of those, who have meditated on the True Guru, the Primal Being.<br>
  O servant Nanak, one who worships and adores the Naam, the Name of the Lord, swims across, and saves the whole world as well. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is occupied with greed all day long, although he may claim otherwise.<br>
  At night, he is overcome by fatigue, and all his nine holes are weakened.<br>
  Over the head of the manmukh is the order of the woman; to her, he ever holds out his promises of goodness.<br>
  Those men who act according to the orders of women are impure, filthy and foolish.<br>
  Those impure men are engrossed in sexual desire; they consult their women and walk accordingly.<br>
  One who walks as the True Guru tells him to, is the true man, the best of the best.<br>
  He Himself created all women and men; the Lord Himself plays every play.<br>
  You created the entire creation; O Nanak, it is the best of the best. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You are carefree, unfathomable and immeasurable; how can You be measured?<br>
  Those who have met the True Guru and who meditate on You are very fortunate.<br>
  The Word of the True Guru's Bani is the embodiment of Truth; through Gurbani, one becomes perfect.<br>
  Jealously emulating the True Guru, some others may speak of good and bad, but the false are destroyed by their falsehood.<br>
  Deep within them is one thing, and in their mouths is another; they suck in the poison of Maya, and then they painfully waste away. ||9||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Service to the True Guru is immaculate and pure; those humble beings who are pure perform this service.<br>
  Those who have deceit, corruption and falsehood within - the True Lord Himself casts them out like lepers.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 155</h2></center>
  The truthful Sikhs sit by the True Guru's side and serve Him. The false ones search, but find no place of rest.<br>
  Those who are not pleased with the Words of the True Guru - their faces are cursed, and they wander around, condemned by God.<br>
  Those who do not have the Love of the Lord within their hearts - how long can those demonic, self-willed manmukhs be consoled?<br>
  One who meets the True Guru, keeps his mind in its own place; he spends only his own assets.<br>

  The faithless baymukh was sent to slander and back-bite others, but when he went there, the faces of both he and his faithless master were blackened instead.<br>
  It was immediately heard throughout the whole world, O Siblings of Destiny, that this faithless man, along with his servant, was kicked and beaten with shoes; in humiliation, they got up and returned to their homes.<br>
  The faithless baymukh was not allowed to mingle with others; his wife and niece then brought him home to lie down.<br>

  What can those wretched ones do, since, from the very beginning, their destiny is cursed with evil.<br>
  Those who are struck down by the Supreme Lord God are of no use to anyone.<br>
  Those who hate the One who has no hatred - according to the true justice of Dharma, they shall perish.<br>

  What shall he earn, and what shall he eat? Within his heart, there is only cynicism and pain.<br>
  One who hates the One who has no hatred, shall bear the load of all the sins of the world on his head.<br>
  He shall find no shelter here or hereafter; his mouth blisters with the slander in his heart.<br>
  If gold comes into his hands, it turns to dust.<br>
  But if he should come again to the Sanctuary of the Guru, then even his past sins shall be forgiven.<br>
  Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, night and day. Remembering the Lord in meditation, wickedness and sins are erased. ||2||<br>

  Whoever goes out to meet them now, will be destroyed by the tyrant, the Messenger of Death.<br>
  Those who were condemned by Guru Nanak were declared counterfeit by Guru Angad as well.<br>
  The Guru of the third generation thought, "What lies in the hands of these poor people?"<br>
  The Guru of the fourth generation saved all these slanderers and evil-doers.<br>
  If any son or Sikh serves the True Guru, then all of his affairs will be resolved.<br>
  He obtains the fruits of his desires - children, wealth, property, union with the Lord and emancipation.<br>

  True are the Praises of the Praiseworthy True Lord; the value of the True Lord cannot be appraised.<br>

  Those Gurmukhs who praise the True Lord - all their hunger is gone. ||23||<br>

  One who is attached to Maya is totally blind and deaf.<br>
  He does not listen to the Word of the Shabad; he makes a great uproar and tumult.<br>
  The Gurmukhs chant and meditate on the Shabad, and lovingly center their consciousness on it.<br>
  They hear and believe in the Name of the Lord; they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Whatever pleases God, He causes that to be done.<br>

  The egotistical, self-willed manmukh does not know the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; one moment he is here, and the next moment he is there.<br>

  Third Mehl:<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is ignorant, evil-minded and egotistical.<br>

  He commits the sins of fraud and unrighteousness.<br>
  What can he hear, and what can he tell others?<br>
  He is blind and deaf; he loses his way, and wanders lost in the wilderness.<br>
  The blind, self-willed manmukh comes and goes in reincarnation;<br>
  without meeting the True Guru, he finds no place of rest.<br>
  O Nanak, he acts according to his pre-ordained destiny. ||2||<br>

  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  He is not a penitent, who is greedy within his heart, and who constantly chases after Maya like a leper.<br>
  When this penitent was first invited, he refused our charity; but later he repented and sent his son, who was seated in the congregation.<br>
  The village elders all laughed, saying that the waves of greed have destroyed this penitent.<br>
  If he sees only a little wealth, he does not bother to go there; but when he sees a lot of wealth, the penitent forsakes his vows.<br>
  O Siblings of Destiny, he is not a penitent - he is only a stork. Sitting together, the Holy Congregation has so decided.<br>
  The penitent slanders the True Primal Being, and sings the praises of the material world. For this sin, he is cursed by the Lord.<br>
  Behold the fruit the penitent gathers, for slandering the Great Primal Being; all his labors have gone in vain.<br>
  When he sits outside among the elders, he is called a penitent;<br>

  No matter what they are given, they are not satisfied; within their hearts there is great desire, ignorance and darkness.<br>

  The love of Maya is total pain; in pain they perish, and in pain they cry out.<br>
  O Nanak, there can be no union between the love of worldliness and the love of the Lord, no matter how much everyone may desire it.<br>

  None of his desires are fulfilled; he continually steals the filth of others.<br>
  The ungrateful wretch does not appreciate what he has been given; he wanders lost in reincarnation.<br>
  He loses all support, when the Support of the Lord is taken away from him.<br>

  The taste of Maya is totally bland and insipid; the Lord alone is pleasing to my mind.<br>
  Meditate, O Nanak, on the Transcendent Lord, who has blessed you with your soul and your life. ||14||<br>
  Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The time has come to plant the seed of the Lord's Name; one who plants it, shall eat its fruit.<br>
  He alone receives it, O Nanak, whose destiny is so pre-ordained. ||1||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  If one begs, then he should beg for the Name of the True One, which is given only by His Pleasure.<br>
  Eating this gift from the Lord and Master, O Nanak, the mind is satisfied. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  They alone earn profit in this world, who have the wealth of the Lord's Name.<br>
  They do not know the love of duality; they place their hopes in the True Lord.<br>
  They serve the One Eternal Lord, and give up everything else.<br>
  One who forgets the Supreme Lord God - useless is his breath.<br>
  God draws His humble servant close in His loving embrace and protects him - Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||15||<br>
  Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Supreme Lord God gave the Order, and the rain automatically began to fall.<br>
  Grain and wealth were produced in abundance; the earth was totally satisfied and satiated.<br>

  To obtain the state of life of Nirvaanaa, meditate in remembrance on the One Lord.<br>
  There is no other place; how else can we be comforted?<br>
  I have seen the whole world - without the Lord's Name, there is no peace at all.<br>
  Body and wealth shall return to dust - hardly anyone realizes this.<br>
  Pleasure, beauty and delicious tastes are useless; what are you doing, O mortal?<br>
  One whom the Lord Himself misleads, does not understand His awesome power.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord attain Nirvaanaa, singing the Praises of the True One.<br>
  Nanak: those who are pleasing to Your Will, O Lord, seek Sanctuary at Your Door. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Those who are attached to the hem of the Lord's robe, do not suffer birth and death.<br>
  Those who remain awake to the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises - their lives are approved.<br>
  Those who attain the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, are very fortunate.<br>
  But those who forget the Name - their lives are cursed, and broken like thin strands of thread.<br>
  O Nanak, the dust of the feet of the Holy is more sacred than hundreds of thousands, even millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines. ||16||<br>
  Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Like the beautiful earth, adorned with jewels of grass - such is the mind, within which the Love of the Lord abides.<br>
  All one's affairs are easily resolved, O Nanak, when the Guru, the True Guru, is pleased. ||1||<br>

  Behold the Supreme Lord God near you, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.<br>

  All treasures are in His Home; whatever the Lord does, comes to pass.<br>
  The Saints live by chanting and meditating on the Lord, washing off the filth of their sins.<br>
  With the Lotus Feet of the Lord dwelling within the heart, all misfortune is taken away.<br>
  One who meets the Perfect Guru, shall not have to suffer through birth and death.<br>
  Nanak is thirsty for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan; by His Grace, He has bestowed it. ||18||<br>

  Pauree:<br>
  To imbue the mind with the Lord of the Universe is the true food and dress.<br>
  To embrace love for the Name of the Lord is to possess horses and elephants.<br>
  To meditate on the Lord steadfastly is to rule over kingdoms of property and enjoy all sorts of pleasures.<br>
  The minstrel begs at God's Door - he shall never leave that Door.<br>

  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree, Fourteen Chau-Padas Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  I was on fire, but now I have found the Water of the Lord's Name.<br>
  This Water of the Lord's Name has cooled my burning body. ||1||Pause||<br>
  To subdue their minds, some go off into the forests;<br>
  but that Water is not found without the Lord God. ||1||<br>
  That fire has consumed angels and mortal beings,<br>
  but the Water of the Lord's Name saves His humble servants from burning. ||2||<br>
  In the terrifying world-ocean, there is an ocean of peace.<br>
  I continue to drink it in, but this Water is never exhausted. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, meditate and vibrate upon the Lord, like the rainbird remembering the water.<br>
  The Water of the Lord's Name has quenched my thirst. ||4||1||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  O Lord, my thirst for the Water of Your Name will not go away.<br>
  The fire of my thirst burns even more brightly in that Water. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are the Ocean of Water, and I am just a fish in that Water.<br>
  In that Water, I remain; without that Water, I would perish. ||1||<br>
  You are the cage, and I am Your parrot.<br>
  So what can the cat of death do to me? ||2||<br>
  You are the tree, and I am the bird.<br>
  I am so unfortunate - I cannot see the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan! ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 174</h2></center>
  You are the True Guru, and I am Your new disciple.<br>
  Says Kabeer, O Lord, please meet me - this is my very last chance! ||4||2||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  When I realize that there is One, and only One Lord,<br>
  why then should the people be upset? ||1||<br>
  I am dishonored; I have lost my honor.<br>
  No one should follow in my footsteps. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am bad, and bad in my mind as well.<br>
  I have no partnership with anyone. ||2||<br>
  I have no shame about honor or dishonor.<br>
  But you shall know, when your own false covering is laid bare. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, honor is that which is accepted by the Lord.<br>
  Give up everything - meditate, vibrate upon the Lord alone. ||4||3||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  If Yoga could be obtained by wandering around naked,<br>
  then all the deer of the forest would be liberated. ||1||<br>
  What does it matter whether someone goes naked, or wears a deer skin,<br>
  if he does not remember the Lord within his soul? ||1||Pause||<br>
  If the spiritual perfection of the Siddhas could be obtained by shaving the head,<br>
  then why haven't sheep found liberation? ||2||<br>
  If someone could save himself by celibacy, O Siblings of Destiny,<br>
  why then haven't eunuchs obtained the state of supreme dignity? ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O men, O Siblings of Destiny:<br>
  without the Lord's Name, who has ever found salvation? ||4||4||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  Those who take their ritual baths in the evening and the morning<br>
  are like the frogs in the water. ||1||<br>
  When people do not love the Lord's Name,<br>
  they must all go to the Righteous Judge of Dharma. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who love their bodies and try different looks,<br>
  do not feel compassion, even in dreams. ||2||<br>
  The wise men call them four-footed creatures;<br>
  the Holy find peace in this ocean of pain. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, why do you perform so many rituals?<br>
  Renounce everything, and drink in the supreme essence of the Lord. ||4||5||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  What use is chanting, and what use is penance, fasting or devotional worship,<br>
  to one whose heart is filled with the love of duality? ||1||<br>
  O humble people, link your mind to the Lord.<br>
  Through cleverness, the four-armed Lord is not obtained. ||Pause||<br>
  Set aside your greed and worldly ways.<br>
  Set aside sexual desire, anger and egotism. ||2||<br>
  Ritual practices bind people in egotism;<br>
  meeting together, they worship stones. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, He is obtained only by devotional worship.<br>
  Through innocent love, the Lord is met. ||4||6||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  In the dwelling of the womb, there is no ancestry or social status.<br>
  All have originated from the Seed of God. ||1||<br>
  Tell me, O Pandit, O religious scholar: since when have you been a Brahmin?<br>
  Don't waste your life by continually claiming to be a Brahmin. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If you are indeed a Brahmin, born of a Brahmin mother,<br>
  then why didn't you come by some other way? ||2||<br>
  How is it that you are a Brahmin, and I am of a low social status?<br>
  How is it that I am formed of blood, and you are made of milk? ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, one who contemplates God,<br>
  is said to be a Brahmin among us. ||4||7||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 175</h2></center>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  In the darkness, no one can sleep in peace.<br>
  The king and the pauper both weep and cry. ||1||<br>
  As long as the tongue does not chant the Lord's Name,<br>
  the person continues coming and going in reincarnation, crying out in pain. ||1||Pause||<br>
  It is like the shadow of a tree;<br>
  when the breath of life passes out of the mortal being, tell me, what becomes of his wealth? ||2||<br>
  It is like the music contained in the instrument;<br>
  how can anyone know the secret of the dead? ||3||<br>
  Like the swan on the lake, death hovers over the body.<br>
  Drink in the Lord's sweet elixir, Kabeer. ||4||8||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  The creation is born of the Light, and the Light is in the creation.<br>
  It bears two fruits: the false glass and the true pearl. ||1||<br>
  Where is that home, which is said to be free of fear?<br>
  There, fear is dispelled and one lives without fear. ||1||Pause||<br>
  On the banks of sacred rivers, the mind is not appeased.<br>
  People remain entangled in good and bad deeds. ||2||<br>
  Sin and virtue are both the same.<br>
  In the home of your own being, is the Philosopher's Stone; renounce your search for any other virtue. ||3||<br>
  Kabeer: O worthless mortal, do not lose the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Keep this mind of yours involved in this involvement. ||4||9||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  He claims to know the Lord, who is beyond measure and beyond thought;<br>
  by mere words, he plans to enter heaven. ||1||<br>
  I do not know where heaven is.<br>
  Everyone claims that he plans to go there. ||1||Pause||<br>
  By mere talk, the mind is not appeased.<br>
  The mind is only appeased, when egotism is conquered. ||2||<br>
  As long as the mind is filled with the desire for heaven,<br>
  he does not dwell at the Lord's Feet. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, unto whom should I tell this?<br>
  The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is heaven. ||4||10||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  We are born, and we grow, and having grown, we pass away.<br>
  Before our very eyes, this world is passing away. ||1||<br>
  How can you not die of shame, claiming, "This world is mine"?<br>
  At the very last moment, nothing is yours. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Trying various methods, you cherish your body,<br>
  but at the time of death, it is burned in the fire. ||2||<br>
  You apply sandalwood oil to your limbs,<br>
  but that body is burned with the firewood. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O virtuous people:<br>
  your beauty shall vanish, as the whole world watches. ||4||11||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  Why do you cry and mourn, when another person dies?<br>
  Do so only if you yourself are to live. ||1||<br>
  I shall not die as the rest of the world dies,<br>
  for now I have met the life-giving Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  People anoint their bodies with fragrant oils,<br>
  and in that pleasure, they forget the supreme bliss. ||2||<br>
  There is one well, and five water-carriers.<br>
  Even though the rope is broken, the fools continue trying to draw water. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, through contemplation, I have obtained this one understanding.<br>
  There is no well, and no water-carrier. ||4||12||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  The mobile and immobile creatures, insects and moths<br>
  - in numerous lifetimes, I have passed through those many forms. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 176</h2></center>
  I lived in many such homes, O Lord,<br>
  before I came into the womb this time. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I was a Yogi, a celibate, a penitent, and a Brahmchaaree, with strict self-discipline.<br>
  Sometimes I was a king, sitting on the throne, and sometimes I was a beggar. ||2||<br>
  The faithless cynics shall die, while the Saints shall all survive.<br>
  They drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Essence with their tongues. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, O God, have mercy on me.<br>
  I am so tired; now, please bless me with Your perfection. ||4||13||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee, With Writings Of The Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Kabeer has seen such wonders!<br>
  Mistaking it for cream, the people are churning water. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The donkey grazes upon the green grass;<br>
  arising each day, he laughs and brays, and then dies. ||1||<br>
  The bull is intoxicated, and runs around wildly.<br>
  He romps and eats and then falls into hell. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, a strange sport has become manifest:<br>
  the sheep is sucking the milk of her lamb. ||3||<br>
  Chanting the Lord's Name, my intellect is enlightened.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the Guru has blessed me with this understanding. ||4||1||14||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee, Panch-Padas:<br>
  I am like a fish out of water,<br>
  because in my previous life, I did not practice penance and intense meditation. ||1||<br>
  Now tell me, Lord, what will my condition be?<br>
  I left Benares - I had little common sense. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I wasted my whole life in the city of Shiva;<br>
  at the time of my death, I moved to Magahar. ||2||<br>
  For many years, I practiced penance and intense meditation at Kaashi;<br>
  now that my time to die has come, I have come to dwell at Magahar! ||3||<br>
  Kaashi and Magahar - I consider them the same.<br>
  With inadequate devotion, how can anyone swim across? ||4||<br>
  Says Kabeer, the Guru and Ganaysha and Shiva all know<br>
  that Kabeer died chanting the Lord's Name. ||5||15||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  You may anoint your limbs with sandalwood oil,<br>
  but in the end, that body will be burned with the firewood. ||1||<br>
  Why should anyone take pride in this body or wealth?<br>
  They shall end up lying on the ground; they shall not go along with you to the world beyond. ||1||Pause||<br>
  They sleep by night and work during the day,<br>
  but they do not chant the Lord's Name, even for an instant. ||2||<br>
  They hold the string of the kite in their hands, and chew betel leaves in their mouths,<br>
  but at the time of death, they shall be tied up tight, like thieves. ||3||<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, and immersed in His Love, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, and find peace. ||4||<br>
  In His Mercy, He implants the Naam within us;<br>
  inhale deeply the sweet aroma and fragrance of the Lord, Har, Har. ||5||<br>
  Says Kabeer, remember Him, you blind fool!<br>
  The Lord is True; all worldly affairs are false. ||6||16||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee, Ti-Padas And Chau-Tukas:<br>
  I have turned away from death and turned to the Lord.<br>
  Pain has been eliminated, and I dwell in peac and comfort.<br>
  My enemies have been transformed into friends.<br>
  The faithless cynics have been transformed into good-hearted people. ||1||<br>
  Now, I feel that everything brings me peace.<br>
  Peace and tranquility have come, since I realized the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 177</h2></center>
  My body was afflicted with millions of diseases.<br>
  They have been transformed into the peaceful, tranquil concentration of Samaadhi.<br>
  When someone understands his own self,<br>
  he no longer suffers from illness and the three fevers. ||2||<br>
  My mind has now been restored to its original purity.<br>
  When I became dead while yet alive, only then did I come to know the Lord.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I am now immersed in intuitive peace and poise.<br>
  I do not fear anyone, and I do not strike fear into anyone else. ||3||17||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  When the body dies, where does the soul go?<br>
  It is absorbed into the untouched, unstruck melody of the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Only one who knows the Lord realizes Him.<br>
  The mind is satisfied and satiated, like the mute who eats the sugar candy and just smiles, without speaking. ||1||<br>
  Such is the spiritual wisdom which the Lord has imparted.<br>
  O mind, hold your breath steady within the central channel of the Sushmanaa. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Adopt such a Guru, that you shall not have to adopt another again.<br>
  Dwell in such a state, that you shall never have to dwell in any other.<br>
  Embrace such a meditation, that you shall never have to embrace any other.<br>
  Die in such a way, that you shall never have to die again. ||2||<br>
  Turn your breath away from the left channel, and away from the right channel, and unite them in the central channel of the Sushmanaa.<br>
  At their confluence within your mind, take your bath there without water.<br>
  To look upon all with an impartial eye - let this be your daily occupation.<br>
  Contemplate this essence of reality - what else is there to contemplate? ||3||<br>
  Water, fire, wind, earth and ether<br>
  - adopt such a way of life and you shall be close to the Lord.<br>
  Says Kabeer, meditate on the Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Go to that home, which you shall never have to leave. ||4||18||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee, Ti-Padas:<br>
  He cannot be obtained by offering your weight in gold.<br>
  But I have bought the Lord by giving my mind to Him. ||1||<br>
  Now I recognize that He is my Lord.<br>
  My mind is intuitively pleased with Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Brahma spoke of Him continually, but could not find His limit.<br>
  Because of my devotion to the Lord, He has come to sit within the home of my inner being. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have renounced my restless intellect.<br>
  It is my destiny to worship the Lord alone. ||3||1||19||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  That death which terrifies the entire world<br>
  - the nature of that death has been revealed to me, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Now, how shall I die? My mind has already accepted death.<br>
  Those who do not know the Lord, die over and over again, and then depart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Everyone says, "I will die, I will die."<br>
  But he alone becomes immortal, who dies with intuitive understanding. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, my mind is filled with bliss;<br>
  my doubts have been eliminated, and I am in ecstasy. ||3||20||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  There is no special place where the soul aches; where should I apply the ointment?<br>
  I have searched the body, but I have not found such a place. ||1||<br>
  He alone knows it, who feels the pain of such love;<br>
  the arrows of the Lord's devotional worship are so sharp! ||1||Pause||<br>
  I look upon all His soul-brides with an impartial eye;<br>
  how can I know which ones are dear to the Husband Lord? ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, one who has such destiny inscribed upon her forehead<br>
  - her Husband Lord turns all others away, and meets with her. ||3||21||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 178</h2></center>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One who has the Lord as his Master, O Siblings of Destiny<br>
  - countless liberations knock at his door. ||1||<br>
  If I say now that my trust is in You alone, Lord,<br>
  then what obligation do I have to anyone else? ||1||Pause||<br>
  He bears the burden of the three worlds;<br>
  why should He not cherish you also? ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, through contemplation, I have obtained this one understanding.<br>
  If the mother poisons her own child, what can anyone do? ||3||22||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  Without Truth, how can the woman be a true satee - a widow who burns herself on her husband's funeral pyre?<br>
  O Pandit, O religious scholar, see this and contemplate it within your heart. ||1||<br>
  Without love, how can one's affection increase?<br>
  As long as there is attachment to pleasure, there can be no spiritual love. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who, in his own soul, believes the Queen Maya to be true,<br>
  does not meet the Lord, even in dreams. ||2||<br>
  One who surrenders her body, mind, wealth, home and self<br>
  - she is the true soul-bride, says Kabeer. ||3||23||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  The whole world is engrossed in corruption.<br>
  This corruption has drowned entire families. ||1||<br>
  O man, why have you wrecked your boat and sunk it?<br>
  You have broken with the Lord, and joined hands with corruption. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Angels and human beings alike are burning in the raging fire.<br>
  The water is near at hand, but the beast does not drink it in. ||2||<br>
  By constant contemplation and awareness, the water is brought forth.<br>
  That water is immaculate and pure, says Kabeer. ||3||24||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  That family, whose son has no spiritual wisdom or contemplation<br>
  - why didn't his mother just become a widow? ||1||<br>
  That man who has not practiced devotional worship of the Lord<br>
  - why didn't such a sinful man die at birth? ||1||Pause||<br>
  So many pregnancies end in miscarriage - why was this one spared?<br>
  He lives his life in this world like a deformed amputee. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, beautiful and handsome people are just ugly hunch-backs. ||3||25||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to those humble beings who take the Name of their Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Pure Lord are pure.<br>
  They are my Siblings of Destiny, so dear to my heart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am the dust of the lotus feet of those whose hearts are filled with the All-pervading Lord. ||2||<br>
  I am a weaver by birth, and patient of mind.<br>
  Slowly, steadily, Kabeer chants the Glories of God. ||3||26||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  From the Sky of the Tenth Gate, the nectar trickles down, distilled from my furnace.<br>
  I have gathered in this most sublime essence, making my body into firewood. ||1||<br>
  He alone is called intoxicated with intuitive peace and poise,<br>
  who drinks in the juice of the Lord's essence, contemplating spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Intuitive poise is the bar-maid who comes to serve it.<br>
  I pass my nights and days in ecstasy. ||2||<br>
  Through conscious meditation, I linked my consciousness with the Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Says Kabeer, then I obtained the Fearless Lord. ||3||27||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  The natural tendency of the mind is to chase the mind.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 179</h2></center>
  Who has established himself as a Siddha, a being of miraculous spiritual powers, by killing his mind? ||1||<br>
  Who is that silent sage, who has killed his mind?<br>
  By killing the mind, tell me, who is saved? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Everyone speaks through the mind.<br>
  Without killing the mind, devotional worship is not performed. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, one who knows the secret of this mystery,<br>
  beholds within his own mind the Lord of the three worlds. ||3||28||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  The stars which are seen in the sky<br>
  - who is the painter who painted them? ||1||<br>
  Tell me, O Pandit, what is the sky attached to?<br>
  Very fortunate is the knower who knows this. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The sun and the moon give their light;<br>
  God's creative extension extends everywhere. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, he alone knows this,<br>
  whose heart is filled with the Lord, and whose mouth is also filled with the Lord. ||3||29||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  The Simritee is the daughter of the Vedas, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  She has brought a chain and a rope. ||1||<br>
  She has imprisoned the people in her own city.<br>
  She has tightened the noose of emotional attachment and shot the arrow of death. ||1||Pause||<br>
  By cutting, she cannot be cut, and she cannot be broken.<br>
  She has become a serpent, and she is eating the world. ||2||<br>
  Before my very eyes, she has plundered the entire world.<br>
  Says Kabeer, chanting the Lord's Name, I have escaped her. ||3||30||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  I have grasped the reins and attached the bridle;<br>
  abandoning everything, I now ride through the skies. ||1||<br>
  I made self-reflection my mount,<br>
  and in the stirrups of intuitive poise, I placed my feet. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Come, and let me ride you to heaven.<br>
  If you hold back, then I shall strike you with the whip of spiritual love. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, those who remain detached from the Vedas, the Koran and the Bible are the best riders. ||3||31||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  That mouth, which used to eat the five delicacies<br>
  - I have seen the flames being applied to that mouth. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, my King, please rid me of this one affliction:<br>
  may I not be burned in fire, or cast into the womb again. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The body is destroyed by so many ways and means.<br>
  Some burn it, and some bury it in the earth. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, O Lord, please reveal to me Your Lotus Feet;<br>
  after that, go ahead and send me to my death. ||3||32||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  He Himself is the fire, and He Himself is the wind.<br>
  When our Lord and Master wishes to burn someone, then who can save him? ||1||<br>
  When I chant the Lord's Name, what does it matter if my body burns?<br>
  My consciousness remains absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Who is burned, and who suffers loss?<br>
  The Lord plays, like the juggler with his ball. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, chant the two letters of the Lord's Name - Raa Maa.<br>
  If He is your Lord and Master, He will protect you. ||3||33||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee, Du-Padas:<br>
  I have not practiced Yoga, or focused my consciousness on meditation.<br>
  Without renunciation, I cannot escape Maya. ||1||<br>
  How have I passed my life?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 180</h2></center>
  I have not taken the Lord's Name as my Support. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have searched the skies,<br>
  and have not seen another, equal to the Lord. ||2||34||<br>
  Gauree, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  That head which was once embellished with the finest turban<br>
  - upon that head, the crow now cleans his beak. ||1||<br>
  What pride should we take in this body and wealth?<br>
  Why not hold tight to the Lord's Name instead? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O my mind:<br>
  this may be your fate as well! ||2||35||<br>
  Thirty-Five Steps Of Gauree Gwaarayree. ||<br>
  Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Ashtapadees Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  People beg for pleasure, but pain comes instead.<br>
  I would rather not beg for that pleasure. ||1||<br>
  People are involved in corruption, but still, they hope for pleasure.<br>
  How will they find their home in the Sovereign Lord King? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Even Shiva and Brahma are afraid of this pleasure,<br>
  but I have judged that pleasure to be true. ||2||<br>
  Even sages like Sanak and Naarad, and the thousand-headed serpent,<br>
  did not see the mind within the body. ||3||<br>
  Anyone can search for this mind, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  When it escapes from the body, where does the mind go? ||4||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, Jai Dayv and Naam Dayv<br>
  came to know this, through loving devotional worship of the Lord. ||5||<br>
  This mind does not come or go.<br>
  One whose doubt is dispelled, knows the Truth. ||6||<br>
  This mind has no form or outline.<br>
  By God's Command it was created; understanding God's Command, it will be absorbed into Him again. ||7||<br>
  Does anyone know the secret of this mind?<br>
  This mind shall merge into the Lord, the Giver of peace and pleasure. ||8||<br>
  There is One Soul, and it pervades all bodies.<br>
  Kabeer dwells upon this Mind. ||9||1||36||<br>
  Gauree Gwaarayree:<br>
  Those who are awake to the One Name, day and night<br>
  - many of them have become Siddhas - perfect spiritual beings - with their consciousness attuned to the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The seekers, the Siddhas and the silent sages have all lost the game.<br>
  The One Name is the wish-fulfilling Elysian Tree, which saves them and carries them across. ||1||<br>
  Those who are rejuvenated by the Lord, do not belong to any other.<br>
  Says Kabeer, they realize the Name of the Lord. ||2||37||<br>
  Gauree And Also Sorat'h:<br>
  O shameless being, don't you feel ashamed?<br>
  You have forsaken the Lord - now where will you go? Unto whom will you turn? ||1||Pause||<br>
  One whose Lord and Master is the highest and most exalted<br>
  - it is not proper for him to go to the house of another. ||1||<br>
  That Lord and Master is pervading everywhere.<br>
  The Lord is always with us; He is never far away. ||2||<br>
  Even Maya takes to the Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet.<br>
  Tell me, what is there which is not in His home? ||3||<br>
  Everyone speaks of Him; He is All-powerful.<br>
  He is His Own Master; He is the Giver. ||4||<br>
  Says Kabeer, he alone is perfect in this world,<br>
  in whose heart there is none other than the Lord. ||5||38||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 181</h2></center>
  Whose son is he? Whose father is he?<br>
  Who dies? Who inflicts pain? ||1||<br>
  The Lord is the thug, who has drugged and robbed the whole world.<br>
  I am separated from the Lord; how can I survive, O my mother? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Whose husband is he? Whose wife is she?<br>
  Contemplate this reality within your body. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and satisfied with the thug.<br>
  The effects of the drug have vanished, since I recognized the thug. ||3||39||<br>
  Now, the Lord, my King, has become my help and support.<br>
  I have cut away birth and death, and attained the supreme status. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He has united me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  He has rescued me from the five demons.<br>
  I chant with my tongue and meditate on the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  He has made me his own slave. ||1||<br>
  The True Guru has blessed me with His generosity.<br>
  He has lifted me up, out of the world-ocean.<br>
  I have fallen in love with His Lotus Feet.<br>
  The Lord of the Universe dwells continually within my consciousness. ||2||<br>
  The burning fire of Maya has been extinguished.<br>
  My mind is contented with the Support of the Naam.<br>
  God, the Lord and Master, is totally permeating the water and the land.<br>
  Wherever I look, there is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||3||<br>
  He Himself has implanted His devotional worship within me.<br>
  By pre-ordained destiny, one meets Him, O my Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  When He grants His Grace, one is perfectly fulfilled.<br>
  Kabeer's Lord and Master is the Cherisher of the poor. ||4||40||<br>
  There is pollution in the water, and pollution on the land; whatever is born is polluted.<br>
  There is pollution in birth, and more pollution in death; all beings are ruined by pollution. ||1||<br>
  Tell me, O Pandit, O religious scholar: who is clean and pure?<br>
  Meditate on such spiritual wisdom, O my friend. ||1||Pause||<br>
  There is pollution in the eyes, and pollution in speech; there is pollution in the ears as well.<br>
  Standing up and sitting down, one is polluted; one's kitchen is polluted as well. ||2||<br>
  Everyone knows how to be caught, but hardly anyone knows how to escape.<br>
  Says Kabeer, those who meditate on the Lord within their hearts, are not polluted. ||3||41||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Resolve this one conflict for me, O Lord,<br>
  if you require any work from Your humble servant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Is this mind greater, or the One to whom the mind is attuned?<br>
  Is the Lord greater, or one who knows the Lord? ||1||<br>
  Is Brahma greater, or the One who created Him?<br>
  Are the Vedas greater, or the One from which they came? ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have become depressed;<br>
  is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage greater, or the slave of the Lord? ||3||42||<br>
  Raag Gauree Chaytee:<br>
  Behold, O Siblings of Destiny, the storm of spiritual wisdom has come.<br>
  It has totally blown away the thatched huts of doubt, and torn apart the bonds of Maya. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The two pillars of double-mindedness have fallen, and the beams of emotional attachment have come crashing down.<br>
  The thatched roof of greed has caved in, and the pitcher of evil-mindedness has been broken. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 182</h2></center>
  Your servant is drenched with the rain that has fallen in this storm.<br>
  Says Kabeer, my mind became enlightened, when I saw the sun rise. ||2||43||<br>
  Gauree Chaytee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  They do not listen to the Lord's Praises, and they do not sing the Lord's Glories,<br>
  but they try to bring down the sky with their talk. ||1||<br>
  What can anyone say to such people?<br>
  You should always be careful around those whom God has excluded from His devotional worship. ||1||Pause||<br>
  They do not offer even a handful of water,<br>
  while they slander the one who brought forth the Ganges. ||2||<br>
  Sitting down or standing up, their ways are crooked and evil.<br>
  They ruin themselves, and then they ruin others. ||3||<br>
  They know nothing except evil talk.<br>
  They would not even obey Brahma's orders. ||4||<br>
  They themselves are lost, and they mislead others as well.<br>
  They set their own temple on fire, and then they fall asleep within it. ||5||<br>
  They laugh at others, while they themselves are one-eyed.<br>
  Seeing them, Kabeer is embarrassed. ||6||1||44||<br>
  Raag Gauree Bairaagan, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  He does not honor his ancestors while they are alive, but he holds feasts in their honor after they have died.<br>
  Tell me, how can his poor ancestors receive what the crows and the dogs have eaten up? ||1||<br>
  If only someone would tell me what real happiness is!<br>
  Speaking of happiness and joy, the world is perishing. How can happiness be found? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Making gods and goddesses out of clay, people sacrifice living beings to them.<br>
  Such are your dead ancestors, who cannot ask for what they want. ||2||<br>
  You murder living beings and worship lifeless things; at your very last moment, you shall suffer in terrible pain.<br>
  You do not know the value of the Lord's Name; you shall drown in the terrifying world-ocean. ||3||<br>
  You worship gods and goddesses, but you do not know the Supreme Lord God.<br>
  Says Kabeer, you have not remembered the Lord who has no ancestors; you are clinging to your corrupt ways. ||4||1||45||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  One who remains dead while yet alive, will live even after death; thus he merges into the Primal Void of the Absolute Lord.<br>
  Remaining pure in the midst of impurity, he will never again fall into the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, this is the milk to be churned.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, hold your mind steady and stable, and in this way, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Guru's arrow has pierced the hard core of this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, and the state of enlightenment has dawned.<br>
  In the darkness of Maya, I mistook the rope for the snake, but that is over, and now I dwell in the eternal home of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Maya has drawn her bow without an arrow, and has pierced this world, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 183</h2></center>
  The drowning person is blown around in the ten directions by the wind, but I hold tight to the string of the Lord's Love. ||3||<br>
  The disturbed mind has been absorbed in the Lord; duality and evil-mindedness have run away.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have seen the One Lord, the Fearless One; I am attuned to the Name of the Lord. ||4||2||46||<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan, Ti-Padas:<br>
  I turned my breath inwards, and pierced through the six chakras of the body, and my awareness was centered on the Primal Void of the Absolute Lord.<br>
  Search for the One who does not come or go, who does not die and is not born, O renunciate. ||1||<br>
  My mind has turned away from the world, and is absorbed in the Mind of God.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, my understanding has been changed; otherwise, I was totally ignorant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That which was near has become distant, and again, that which was distant is near, for those who realize the Lord as He is.<br>
  It is like the sugar water made from the candy; only one who drinks it knows its taste. ||2||<br>
  Unto whom should I speak Your speech, O Lord; it is beyond the three qualities. Is there anyone with such discerning wisdom?<br>
  Says Kabeer, as is the fuse which you apply, so is the flash you will see. ||3||3||47||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  There is no rainy season, ocean, sunshine or shade, no creation or destruction there.<br>
  No life or death, no pain or pleasure is felt there. There is only the Primal Trance of Samaadhi, and no duality. ||1||<br>
  The description of the state of intuitive poise is indescribable and sublime.<br>
  It is not measured, and it is not exhausted. It is neither light nor heavy. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Neither lower nor upper worlds are there; neither day nor night are there.<br>
  There is no water, wind or fire; there, the True Guru is contained. ||2||<br>
  The Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord dwells there within Himself; by Guru's Grace, He is found.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I remain in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||4||48||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  With both sin and virtue, the ox of the body is purchased; the air of the breath is the capital which has appeared.<br>
  The bag on its back is filled with desire; this is how we purchase the herd. ||1||<br>
  My Lord is such a wealthy merchant!<br>
  He has made the whole world his peddler. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sexual desire and anger are the tax-collectors, and the waves of the mind are the highway robbers.<br>
  The five elements join together and divide up their loot. This is how our herd is disposed of! ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: This is the state of affairs now!<br>
  Going uphill, the ox has grown weary; throwing off his load, he continues on his journey. ||3||5||49||<br>
  Gauree, Panch-Padas:<br>
  For a few short days, the soul-bride stays in her parent's house; then, she must go to her in-laws.<br>
  The blind, foolish and ignorant people do not know this. ||1||<br>
  Tell me, why is the bride wearing her ordinary clothes?<br>
  The guests have arrived at her home, and her Husband has come to take her away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Who has lowered the rope of the breath down, into the well of the world which we see?<br>
  The rope of the breath breaks away from the pitcher of the body, and the water-carrier gets up and departs. ||2||<br>
  When the Lord and Master is kind and grants His Grace, then her affairs are all resolved.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 184</h2></center>
  Then she is known as the happy soul-bride, if she contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||<br>
  Bound by the actions she has committed, she wanders around - see this and understand.<br>
  What can we say to her? What can the poor soul-bride do? ||4||<br>
  Disappointed and hopeless, she gets up and departs. There is no support or encouragement in her consciousness.<br>
  So remain attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet, and hurry to His Sanctuary, Kabeer! ||5||6||50||<br>
  Gauree :<br>
  The Yogi says that Yoga is good and sweet, and nothing else is, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Those who shave their heads, and those who amputate their limbs, and those who utter only a single word, all say that they have attained the spiritual perfection of the Siddhas. ||1||<br>
  Without the Lord, the blind ones are deluded by doubt.<br>
  And those, to whom I go to find release - they themselves are bound by all sorts of chains. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The soul is re-absorbed into that from which it originated, when one leaves this path of errors.<br>
  The scholarly Pandits, the virtuous, the brave and the generous, all assert that they alone are great. ||2||<br>
  He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. Without understanding, what can anyone do?<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, the darkness is dispelled, and in this way, the jewel is obtained. ||3||<br>
  Give up the evil actions of your left and right hands, and grasp hold of the Feet of the Lord.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the mute has tasted the molasses, but what can he say about it if he is asked? ||4||7||51||<br>
  Raag Gauree Poorbee, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Where something existed, now there is nothing. The five elements are no longer there.<br>
  The Ida, the Pingala and the Sushmanaa - O human being, how can the breaths through these be counted now? ||1||<br>
  The string has been broken, and the Sky of the Tenth Gate has been destroyed. Where has your speech gone?<br>
  This cynicism afflicts me, night and day; who can explain this to me and help me understand? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Where the world is - the body is not there; the mind is not there either.<br>
  The Joiner is forever unattached; now, within whom is the soul said to be contained? ||2||<br>
  By joining the elements, people cannot join them, and by breaking, they cannot be broken, until the body perishes.<br>
  Of whom is the soul the master, and of whom is it the servant? Where, and to whom does it go? ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have lovingly focused my attention on that place where the Lord dwells, day and night.<br>
  Only He Himself truly knows the secrets of His mystery; He is eternal and indestructible. ||4||1||52||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Let contemplation and intuitive meditation be your two ear-rings, and true wisdom your patched overcoat.<br>
  In the cave of silence, dwell in your Yogic posture; let the subjugation of desire be your spiritual path. ||1||<br>
  O my King, I am a Yogi, a hermit, a renunciate.<br>
  I do not die or suffer pain or separation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The solar systems and galaxies are my horn; the whole world is the bag to carry my ashes.<br>
  Eliminating the three qualities and finding release from this world is my deep meditation. ||2||<br>
  My mind and breath are the two gourds of my fiddle, and the Lord of all the ages is its frame.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 185</h2></center>
  The string has become steady, and it does not break; this guitar vibrates with the unstruck melody. ||3||<br>
  Hearing it, the mind is enraptured and becomes perfect; it does not waver, and it is not affected by Maya.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the bairaagee, the renunciate, who has played such a game, is not reincarnated again into the world of form and substance. ||4||2||53||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Nine yards, ten yards, and twenty-one yards - weave these into the full piece of cloth;<br>
  take the sixty threads and add nine joints to the seventy-two on the loom. ||1||<br>
  Life weaves itself into its patterns.<br>
  Leaving her home, the soul goes to the world of the weaver. ||1||Pause||<br>
  This cloth cannot be measured in yards or weighed with weights; its food is two and a half measures.<br>
  If it does not obtain food right away, it quarrels with the master of the house. ||2||<br>
  How many days will you sit here, in opposition to your Lord and Master? When will this opportunity come again?<br>
  Leaving his pots and pans, and the bobbins wet with his tears, the weaver soul departs in jealous anger. ||3||<br>
  The wind-pipe is empty now; the thread of the breath does not come out any longer. The thread is tangled; it has run out.<br>
  So renounce the world of form and substance while you remain here, O poor soul; says Kabeer: you must understand this! ||4||3||54||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  When one light merges into another, what becomes of it then?<br>
  That person, within whose heart the Lord's Name does not well up - may that person burst and die! ||1||<br>
  O my dark and beautiful Lord,<br>
  my mind is attached to You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meeting with the Holy, the perfection of the Siddhas is obtained. What good is Yoga or indulgence in pleasures?<br>
  When the two meet together, the business is conducted, and the link with the Lord's Name is established. ||2||<br>
  People believe that this is just a song, but it is a meditation on God.<br>
  It is like the instructions given to the dying man at Benares. ||3||<br>
  Whoever sings or listens to the Lord's Name with conscious awareness<br>
  - says Kabeer, without a doubt, in the end, he obtains the highest status. ||4||1||4||55||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Those who try to do things by their own efforts are drowned in the terrifying world-ocean; they cannot cross over.<br>
  Those who practice religious rituals and strict self-discipline - their egotistical pride shall consume their minds. ||1||<br>
  Your Lord and Master has given you the breath of life and food to sustain you; Oh, why have you forgotten Him?<br>
  Human birth is a priceless jewel, which has been squandered in exchange for a worthless shell. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The thirst of desire and the hunger of doubt afflict you; you do not contemplate the Lord in your heart.<br>
  Intoxicated with pride, you cheat yourself; you have not enshrined the Word of the Guru's Shabad within your mind. ||2||<br>
  Those who are deluded by sensual pleasures, who are tempted by sexual delights and enjoy wine are corrupt.<br>
  But those who, through destiny and good karma, join the Society of the Saints, float over the ocean, like iron attached to wood. ||3||<br>
  I have wandered in doubt and confusion, through birth and reincarnation; now, I am so tired. I am suffering in pain and wasting away.<br>
  Says Kabeer, meeting with the Guru, I have obtained supreme joy; my love and devotion have saved me. ||4||1||5||56||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Like the straw figure of a female elephant, fashioned to trap the bull elephant, O crazy mind, the Lord of the Universe has staged the drama of this world.<br>
  Attracted by the lure of sexual desire, the elephant is captured, O crazy mind, and now the halter is placed around its neck. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 186</h2></center>
  So escape from corruption and immerse yourself in the Lord; take this advice, O crazy mind.<br>
  You have not meditated fearlessly on the Lord, O crazy mind; you have not embarked upon the Lord's Boat. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The monkey stretches out its hand, O crazy mind, and takes a handful of corn;<br>
  now unable to escape, O crazy mind, it is made to dance door to door. ||2||<br>
  Like the parrot caught in the trap, O crazy mind, you trapped by the affairs of Maya.<br>
  Like the weak dye of the safflower, O crazy mind, so is the expanse of this world of form and substance. ||3||<br>
  There are so many holy shrines in which to bathe, O crazy mind, and so many gods to worship.<br>
  Says Kabeer, you shall not be saved like this, O crazy mind; only by serving the Lord will you find release. ||4||1||6||57||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Fire does not burn it, and the wind does not blow it away; thieves cannot get near it.<br>
  Accumulate the wealth of the Lord's Name; that wealth does not go anywhere. ||1||<br>
  My wealth is God, the Lord of Wealth, the Lord of the Universe, the Support of the earth: this is called the most excellent wealth.<br>
  The peace which is obtained by serving God, the Lord of the Universe - that peace cannot be found in kingdoms or power. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Shiva and Sanak, in their search for this wealth, became Udaasees, and renounced the world.<br>
  One whose mind is filled with the Lord of liberation, and whose tongue chants the Name of the Lord, shall not be caught by the noose of Death. ||2||<br>
  My own wealth is the spiritual wisdom and devotion given by the Guru; my mind is held steady in perfect neutral balance.<br>
  It is like water for the burning soul, like an anchoring support for the wandering mind; the bondage of doubt and fear is dispelled. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer: O you who are intoxicated with sexual desire, reflect upon this in your heart, and see.<br>
  Within your home there are hundreds of thousands, millions of horses and elephants; but within my home is the One Lord. ||4||1||7||58||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Like the monkey with a handful of grain, who will not let go because of greed<br>
  - just so, all the deeds committed in greed ultimately become a noose around one's neck. ||1||<br>
  Without devotional worship, human life passes away in vain.<br>
  Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, without vibrating and meditating on the Lord God, one does not abide in Truth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Like the flower which blossoms in the wilderness with no one to enjoy its fragrance,<br>
  so do people wander in reincarnation; over and over again, they are destroyed by Death. ||2||<br>
  This wealth, youth, children and spouse which the Lord has given you - this is all just a passing show.<br>
  Those who are caught and entangled in these are carried away by sensual desire. ||3||<br>
  Age is the fire, and the body is the house of straw; on all four sides, this play is being played out.<br>
  Says Kabeer, to cross over the terriffying world-ocean, I have taken to the Shelter of the True Guru. ||4||1||8||59||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  The water of the sperm is cloudy, and the egg of the ovary is crimson.<br>
  From this clay, the puppet is fashioned. ||1||<br>
  I am nothing, and nothing is mine.<br>
  This body, wealth, and all delicacies are Yours, O Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Into this clay, the breath is infused.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 187</h2></center>
  By Your Power, You have set this false contrivance in motion. ||2||<br>
  Some collect hundreds of thousands of dollars,<br>
  but in the end, the pitcher of the body bursts. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, that single foundation which you have laid<br>
  will be destroyed in an instant - you are so egotistical. ||4||1||9||60||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Just as Dhroo and Prahlaad meditated on the Lord, so should you meditate on the Lord, O my soul. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, Merciful to the meek, I have placed my faith in You;<br>
  along with all my family, I have come aboard Your boat. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When it is pleasing to Him, then He inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command.<br>
  He causes this boat to cross over. ||2||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, such understanding is infused into me;<br>
  my comings and goings in reincarnation have ended. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth.<br>
  In this world, in the world beyond and everywhere, He alone is the Giver. ||4||2||10||61||<br>
  Gauree 9:<br>
  He leaves the womb, and comes into the world;<br>
  as soon as the air touches him, he forgets his Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  O my soul, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You were upside-down, living in the womb; you generated the intense meditative heat of 'tapas'.<br>
  Then, you escaped the fire of the belly. ||2||<br>
  After wandering through 8.4 million incarnations, you came.<br>
  If you stumble and fall now, you shall find no home or place of rest. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth.<br>
  He is not seen to be coming or going; He is the Knower of all. ||4||1||11||62||<br>
  Gauree Poorbee:<br>
  Don't wish for a home in heaven, and don't be afraid to live in hell.<br>
  Whatever will be will be, so don't get your hopes up in your mind. ||1||<br>
  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,<br>
  from whom the most excellent treasure is obtained. ||1||Pause||<br>
  What good is chanting, penance or self-mortification? What good is fasting or cleansing baths,<br>
  unless you know the way to worship the Lord God with loving devotion? ||2||<br>
  Don't feel so delighted at the sight of wealth, and don't weep at the sight of suffering and adversity.<br>
  As is wealth, so is adversity; whatever the Lord proposes, comes to pass. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, now I know that the Lord dwells within the hearts of His Saints;<br>
  that servant performs the best service, whose heart is filled with the Lord. ||4||1||12||63||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  O my mind, even if you carry someone's burden, they don't belong to you.<br>
  This world is like the perch of the bird on the tree. ||1||<br>
  I drink in the sublime essence of the Lord.<br>
  With the taste of this essence, I have forgotten all other tastes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Why should we weep at the death of others, when we ourselves are not permanent?<br>
  Whoever is born shall pass away; why should we cry out in grief? ||2||<br>
  We are re-absorbed into the One from whom we came; drink in the Lord's essence, and remain attached to Him.<br>
  Says Kabeer, my consciousness is filled with thoughts of remembrance of the Lord; I have become detached from the world. ||3||2||13||64||<br>
  Raag Gauree:<br>
  The bride gazes at the path, and sighs with tearful eyes.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 188</h2></center>
  Her heart is not happy, but she does not retrace her steps, in hopes of seeing the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||<br>
  So fly away, black crow,<br>
  so that I may quickly meet my Beloved Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Says Kabeer, to obtain the status of eternal life, worship the Lord with devotion.<br>
  The Name of the Lord is my only Support; with my tongue, I chant the Lord's Name. ||2||1||14||65||<br>
  Raag Gauree 11:<br>
  All around, there are thick bushes of sweet basil, and there in the midst of the forest, the Lord is singing with joy.<br>
  Beholding His wondrous beauty, the milk-maid was entranced, and said, "Please don't leave me; please don't come and go!"||1||<br>
  My mind is attached to Your Feet, O Archer of the Universe;<br>
  he alone meets You, who is blessed by great good fortune. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In Brindaaban, where Krishna grazes his cows, he entices and fascinates my mind.<br>
  You are my Lord Master, the Archer of the Universe; my name is Kabeer. ||2||2||15||66||<br>
  Gauree Poorbee 12:<br>
  Many people wear various robes, but what is the use of living in the forest?<br>
  What good does it do if a man burns incense before his gods? What good does it do to dip one's body in water? ||1||<br>
  O soul, I know that I will have to depart.<br>
  You ignorant idiot: understand the Imperishable Lord.<br>
  Whatever you see, you will not see that again, but still, you cling to Maya. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The spiritual teachers, meditators and the great preachers are all engrossed in these worldly affairs.<br>
  Says Kabeer, without the Name of the One Lord, this world is blinded by Maya. ||2||1||16||67||<br>
  Gauree 12:<br>
  O people, O victims of this Maya, abandon your doubts and dance out in the open.<br>
  What sort of a hero is one who is afraid to face the battle? What sort of satee is she who, when her time comes, starts collecting her pots and pans? ||1||<br>
  Stop your wavering, O crazy people!<br>
  Now that you have taken up the challenge of death, let yourself burn and die, and attain perfection. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The world is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and Maya; in this way it is plundered and ruined.<br>
  Says Kabeer, do not forsake the Lord, your Sovereign King, the Highest of the High. ||2||2||17||68||<br>
  Gauree 13:<br>
  Your Command is upon my head, and I no longer question it.<br>
  You are the river, and You are the boatman; salvation comes from You. ||1||<br>
  O human being, embrace the Lord's meditation,<br>
  whether your Lord and Master is angry with you or in love with you. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Your Name is my Support, like the flower blossoming in the water.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I am the slave of Your home; I live or die as You will. ||2||18||69||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Wandering through 8.4 million incarnations, Krishna's father Nand was totally exhausted.<br>
  Because of his devotion, Krishna was incarnated in his home; how great was the good fortune of this poor man! ||1||<br>
  You say that Krishna was Nand's son, but whose son was Nand himself?<br>
  When there was no earth or ether or the ten directions, where was this Nand then? ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 189</h2></center>
  He does not fall into misfortune, and He does not take birth; His Name is the Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Kabeer's Lord is such a Lord and Master, who has no mother or father. ||2||19||70||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  Slander me, slander me - go ahead, people, and slander me.<br>
  Slander is pleasing to the Lord's humble servant.<br>
  Slander is my father, slander is my mother. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If I am slandered, I go to heaven;<br>
  the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within my mind.<br>
  If my heart is pure, and I am slandered,<br>
  then the slanderer washes my clothes. ||1||<br>
  One who slanders me is my friend;<br>
  the slanderer is in my thoughts.<br>
  The slanderer is the one who prevents me from being slandered.<br>
  The slanderer wishes me long life. ||2||<br>
  I have love and affection for the slanderer.<br>
  Slander is my salvation.<br>
  Slander is the best thing for servant Kabeer.<br>
  The slanderer is drowned, while I am carried across. ||3||20||71||<br>
  O my Sovereign Lord King, You are Fearless; You are the Carrier to carry us across, O my Lord King. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When I was, then You were not; now that You are, I am not.<br>
  Now, You and I have become one; seeing this, my mind is content. ||1||<br>
  When there was wisdom, how could there be strength? Now that there is wisdom, strength cannot prevail.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the Lord has taken away my wisdom, and I have attained spiritual perfection. ||2||21||72||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  He fashioned the body chamber with six rings, and placed within it the incomparable thing.<br>
  He made the breath of life the watchman, with lock and key to protect it; the Creator did this in no time at all. ||1||<br>
  Keep your mind awake and aware now, O Sibling of Destiny.<br>
  You were careless, and you have wasted your life; your home is being plundered by thieves. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The five senses stand as guards at the gate, but now can they be trusted?<br>
  When you are conscious in your consciousness, you shall be enlightened and illuminated. ||2||<br>
  Seeing the nine openings of the body, the soul-bride is led astray; she does not obtain that incomparable thing.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the nine openings of the body are being plundered; rise up to the Tenth Gate, and discover the true essence. ||3||22||73||<br>
  Gauree:<br>
  O mother, I do not know any other, except Him.<br>
  My breath of life resides in Him, whose praises are sung by Shiva and Sanak and so many others. ||Pause||<br>
  My heart is illuminated by spiritual wisdom; meeting the Guru, I meditate in the Sky of the Tenth Gate.<br>
  The diseases of corruption, fear and bondage have run away; my mind has come to know peace in its own true home. ||1||<br>
  Imbued with a balanced single-mindedness, I know and obey God; nothing else enters my mind.<br>
  My mind has become fragrant with the scent of sandalwood; I have renounced egotistical selfishness and conceit. ||2||<br>
  That humble being, who sings and meditates on the Praises of his Lord and Master, is the dwelling-place of God.<br>
  He is blessed with great good fortune; the Lord abides in his mind. Good karma radiates from his forehead. ||3||<br>
  I have broken the bonds of Maya; the intuitive peace and poise of Shiva has dawned within me, and I am merged in oneness with the One.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 190</h2></center>
  Says Kabeer, meeting the Guru, I have found absolute peace. My mind has ceased its wanderings; I am happy. ||4||23||74||<br>
  Raag Gauree Poorbee, Baawan Akhree Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Through these fifty-two letters, the three worlds and all things are described.<br>
  These letters shall perish; they cannot describe the Imperishable Lord. ||1||<br>
  Wherever there is speech, there are letters.<br>
  Where there is no speech, there, the mind rests on nothing.<br>
  He is in both speech and silence.<br>
  No one can know Him as He is. ||2||<br>
  If I come to know the Lord, what can I say; what good does it do to speak?<br>
  He is contained in the seed of the banyan-tree, and yet, His expanse spreads across the three worlds. ||3||<br>
  One who knows the Lord understands His mystery, and bit by bit, the mystery disappears.<br>
  Turning away from the world, one's mind is pierced through with this mystery, and one obtains the Indestructible, Impenetrable Lord. ||4||<br>
  The Muslim knows the Muslim way of life; the Hindu knows the Vedas and Puraanas.<br>
  To instruct their minds, people ought to study some sort of spiritual wisdom. ||5||<br>
  I know only the One, the Universal Creator, the Primal Being.<br>
  I do not believe in anyone whom the Lord writes and erases.<br>
  If someone knows the One, the Universal Creator,<br>
  he shall not perish, since he knows Him. ||6||<br>
  KAKKA: When the rays of Divine Light come into the heart-lotus,<br>
  the moon-light of Maya cannot enter the basket of the mind.<br>
  And if one obtains the subtle fragrance of that spiritual flower,<br>
  he cannot describe the indescribable; he could speak, but who would understand? ||7||<br>
  KHAKHA: The mind has entered this cave.<br>
  It does not leave this cave to wander in the ten directions.<br>
  Knowing their Lord and Master, people show compassion;<br>
  then, they become immortal, and attain the state of eternal dignity. ||8||<br>
  GAGGA: One who understands the Guru's Word<br>
  does not listen to anything else.<br>
  He remains like a hermit and does not go anywhere,<br>
  when he grasps the Ungraspable Lord and dwells in the sky of the Tenth Gate. ||9||<br>
  GHAGHA: He dwells in each and every heart.<br>
  Even when the body-pitcher bursts, he does not diminish.<br>
  When someone finds the Path to the Lord within his own heart,<br>
  why should he abandon that Path to follow some other path? ||10||<br>
  NGANGA: Restrain yourself, love the Lord, and dismiss your doubts.<br>
  Even if you do not see the Path, do not run away; this is the highest wisdom. ||11||<br>
  CHACHA: He painted the great picture of the world.<br>
  Forget this picture, and remember the Painter.<br>
  This wondrous painting is now the problem.<br>
  Forget this picture and focus your consciousness on the Painter. ||12||<br>
  CHHACHHA: The Sovereign Lord of the Universe is here with you.<br>
  Why are you so unhappy? Why don't you abandon your desires?<br>
  O my mind, each and every moment I try to instruct you,<br>
  but you forsake Him, and entangle yourself with others. ||13||<br>
  JAJJA: If someone burns his body while he is still alive,<br>
  and burns away the desires of his youth, then he finds the right way.<br>
  When he burns his desire for his own wealth, and that of others,<br>
  then he finds the Divine Light. ||14||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 191</h2></center>
  JHAJHA: You are entangled in the world, and you do not know how to get untangled.<br>
  You hold back in fear, and are not approved by the Lord.<br>
  Why do you talk such nonsense, trying to convince others?<br>
  Stirring up arguments, you shall only obtain more arguments. ||15||<br>
  NYANYA: He dwells near you, deep within your heart; why do you leave Him and go far away?<br>
  I searched the whole world for Him, but I found Him near myself. ||16||<br>
  TATTA: It is such a difficult path, to find Him within your own heart.<br>
  Open the doors within, and enter the Mansion of His Presence.<br>
  Beholding the Immovable Lord, you shall not slip and go anywhere else.<br>
  You shall remain firmly attached to the Lord, and your heart will be happy. ||17||<br>
  T'HAT'HA: Keep yourself far away from this mirage.<br>
  With great difficulty, I have calmed my mind.<br>
  That cheater, who cheated and devoured the whole world<br>
  - I have cheated that cheater, and my mind is now at peace. ||18||<br>
  DADDA: When the Fear of God wells up, other fears depart.<br>
  Other fears are absorbed into that Fear.<br>
  When one rejects the Fear of God, then other fears cling to him.<br>
  But if he becomes fearless, the fears of his heart run away. ||19||<br>
  DHADHA: Why do you search in other directions?<br>
  Searching for Him like this, the breath of life runs out.<br>
  When I returned after climbing the mountain,<br>
  I found Him in the fortress - the fortress which He Himself made. ||20||<br>
  NANNA: The warrior who fights on the battle-field should keep up and press on.<br>
  He should not yield, and he should not retreat.<br>
  Blessed is the coming of one<br>
  who conquers the one and renounces the many. ||21||<br>
  TATTA: The impassable world-ocean cannot be crossed over;<br>
  the body remains embroiled in the three worlds.<br>
  But when the Lord of the three worlds enters into the body,<br>
  then one's essence merges with the essence of reality, and the True Lord is attained. ||22||<br>
  T'HAT'HA: He is Unfathomable; His depths cannot be fathomed.<br>
  He is Unfathomable; this body is impermanent, and unstable.<br>
  The mortal builds his dwelling upon this tiny space;<br>
  without any pillars, he wishes to support a mansion. ||23||<br>
  DADDA: Whatever is seen shall perish.<br>
  Contemplate the One who is unseen.<br>
  When the key is inserted in the Tenth Gate,<br>
  then the Blessed Vision of the Merciful Lord's Darshan is seen. ||24||<br>
  DHADHA: When one ascends from the lower realms of the earth to the higher realms of the heavens, then everything is resolved.<br>
  The Lord dwells in both the lower and higher worlds.<br>
  Leaving the earth, the soul ascends to the heavens;<br>
  then, the lower and higher join together, and peace is obtained. ||25||<br>
  NANNA: The days and nights go by; I am looking for the Lord.<br>
  Looking for Him, my eyes have become blood-shot.<br>
  After looking and looking,when He is finally found,<br>
  then the one who was looking merges into the One who was looked for. ||26||<br>
  PAPPA: He is limitless; His limits cannot be found.<br>
  I have attuned myself to the Supreme Light.<br>
  One who controls his five senses<br>
  rises above both sin and virtue. ||27||<br>
  FAFFA: Even without the flower, the fruit is produced.<br>
  One who looks at a slice of that fruit<br>
  and reflects on it, will not be consigned to reincarnation.<br>
  A slice of that fruit slices all bodies. ||28||<br>
  BABBA: When one drop blends with another drop,<br>
  then these drops cannot be separated again.<br>
  Become the Lord's slave, and hold tight to His meditation.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 192</h2></center>
  If you turn your thoughts to the Lord, the Lord will take care of you like a relative. ||29||<br>
  BHABHA: When doubt is pierced, union is achieved.<br>
  I have shattered my fear, and now I have come to have faith.<br>
  I thought that He was outside of me, but now I know that He is within me.<br>
  When I came to understand this mystery, then I recognized the Lord. ||30||<br>
  MAMMA: Clinging to the source, the mind is satisfied.<br>
  One who knows this mystery understands his own mind.<br>
  Let no one delay in uniting his mind.<br>
  Those who obtain the True Lord are immersed in delight. ||31||<br>
  MAMMA: The mortal's business is with his own mind; one who disciplines his mind attains perfection.<br>
  Only the mind can deal with the mind; says Kabeer, I have not met anything like the mind. ||32||<br>
  This mind is Shakti; this mind is Shiva.<br>
  This mind is the life of the five elements.<br>
  When this mind is channeled, and guided to enlightenment,<br>
  it can describe the secrets of the three worlds. ||33||<br>
  YAYYA: If you know anything, then destroy your evil-mindedness, and subjugate the body-village.<br>
  When you are engaged in the battle, don't run away; then, you shall be known as a spiritual hero. ||34||<br>
  RARRA: I have found tastes to be tasteless.<br>
  Becoming tasteless, I have realized that taste.<br>
  Abandoning these tastes, I have found that taste.<br>
  Drinking in that taste, this taste is no longer pleasing. ||35||<br>
  LALLA: Embrace such love for the Lord in your mind,<br>
  that you shall not have to go to any other; you shall attain the supreme truth.<br>
  And if you embrace love and affection for Him there,<br>
  then you shall obtain the Lord; obtaining Him, you shall be absorbed in His Feet. ||36||<br>
  WAWA: Time and time again, dwell upon the Lord.<br>
  Dwelling upon the Lord, defeat shall not come to you.<br>
  I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those, who sing the praises of the Saints, the sons of the Lord.<br>
  Meeting the Lord, total Truth is obtained. ||37||<br>
  WAWA: Know Him. By knowing Him, this mortal becomes Him.<br>
  When this soul and that Lord are blended, then, having been blended, they cannot be known separately. ||38||<br>
  SASSA: Discipline your mind with sublime perfection.<br>
  Refrain from that talk which attracts the heart.<br>
  The heart is attracted, when love wells up.<br>
  The King of the three worlds is perfectly pervading and permeating there. ||39||<br>
  KHAKHA: Anyone who seeks Him, and by seeking Him, finds Him, shall not be born again.<br>
  When someone seeks Him, and comes to understand and contemplate Him,<br>
  then he crosses over the terrifying world-ocean in an instant. ||40||<br>
  SASSA: The bed of the soul-bride is adorned by her Husband Lord;<br>
  her skepticism is dispelled.<br>
  Renouncing the shallow pleasures of the world, she obtains the supreme delight.<br>
  Then, she is the soul-bride; He is called her Husband Lord. ||41||<br>
  HAHA: He exists, but He is not known to exist.<br>
  When He is known to exist, then the mind is pleased and appeased.<br>
  Of course the Lord exists, if one could only understand Him.<br>
  Then, He alone exists, and not this mortal being. ||42||<br>
  Everyone goes around saying, "I'll take this, and I'll take that."<br>
  Because of that, they suffer in terrible pain.<br>
  When someone comes to love the Lord of Lakhshmi,<br>
  his sorrow departs, and he obtains total peace. ||43||<br>
  KHAKHA: Many have wasted their lives, and then perished.<br>
  Wasting away, they do not remember the Lord, even now.<br>
  But if someone, even now, comes to know the transitory nature of the world and restrain his mind,<br>
  he shall find his permanent home, from which he was separated. ||44||<br>

  The fifty-two letters have been joined together.<br>
  But people cannot recognize the One Word of God.<br>
  Kabeer speaks the Shabad, the Word of Truth.<br>
  One who is a Pandit, a religious scholar, must remain fearless.<br>
  It is the business of the scholarly person to join letters.<br>
  The spiritual person contemplates the essence of reality.<br>
  According to the wisdom within the mind,<br>

  Raag Gauree, T'hitee ~ The Lunar Days Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  There are fifteen lunar days, and seven days of the week.<br>
  Says Kabeer, it is neither here nor there.<br>
  When the Siddhas and seekers come to know the Lord's mystery,<br>
  they themselves become the Creator; they themselves become the Divine Lord. ||1||<br>
  T'HITEE:<br>
  On the day of the new moon, give up your hopes.<br>
  Remember the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  You shall attain the Gate of Liberation while yet alive.<br>
  You shall come to know the Shabad, the Word of the Fearless Lord, and the essence of your own inner being. ||1||<br>
  One who enshrines love for the Lotus Feet of the Lord of the Universe<br>
  - by the Grace of the Saints, her mind becomes pure; night and day, she remains awake and aware, singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||1||Pause||<br>
  On the first day of the lunar cycle, contemplate the Beloved Lord.<br>
  He is playing within the heart; He has no body - He is Infinite.<br>
  The pain of death never consumes that person<br>
  who remains absorbed in the Primal Lord God. ||2||<br>
  On the second day of the lunar cycle, know that there are two beings within the fiber of the body.<br>
  Maya and God are blended with everything.<br>
  God does not increase or decrease.<br>
  He is unknowable and immaculate; He does not change. ||3||<br>
  On the third day of the lunar cycle, one who maintains his equilibrium amidst the three modes<br>
  finds the source of ecstasy and the highest status.<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, faith wells up.<br>
  Outwardly, and deep within, God's Light is always radiant. ||4||<br>
  On the fourth day of the lunar cycle, restrain your fickle mind,<br>
  and do not ever associate with sexual desire or anger.<br>
  On land and sea, He Himself is in Himself.<br>
  He Himself meditates and chants His Chant. ||5||<br>
  On the fifth day of the lunar cycle, the five elements expand outward.<br>
  Men are occupied in the pursuit of gold and women.<br>
  How rare are those who drink in the pure essence of the Lord's Love.<br>
  They shall never again suffer the pains of old age and death. ||6||<br>
  On the sixth day of the lunar cycle, the six chakras run in six directions.<br>
  Without enlightenment, the body does not remain steady.<br>
  So erase your duality and hold tight to forgiveness,<br>
  and you will not have to endure the torture of karma or religious rituals. ||7||<br>
  On the seventh day of the lunar cycle, know the Word as True,<br>
  and you shall be accepted by the Lord, the Supreme Soul.<br>
  Your doubts shall be eradicated, and your pains eliminated,<br>
  and in the ocean of the celestial void, you shall find peace. ||8||<br>
  On the eighth day of the lunar cycle, the body is made of the eight ingredients.<br>
  Within it is the Unknowable Lord, the King of the supreme treasure.<br>
  The Guru, who knows this spiritual wisdom, reveals the secret of this mystery.<br>
  Turning away from the world, He abides in the Unbreakable and Impenetrable Lord. ||9||<br>
  On the ninth day of the lunar cycle, discipline the nine gates of the body.<br>
  Keep your pulsating desires restrained.<br>
  Forget all your greed and emotional attachment;<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 194</h2></center>

  On the tenth day of the lunar cycle, there is ecstasy in all directions.<br>
  Doubt is dispelled, and the Lord of the Universe is met.<br>
  He is the Embodiment of light, the incomparable essence.<br>
  He is stainless, without stain, beyond both sunshine and shade. ||11||<br>
  On the eleventh day of the lunar cycle, if you run in the direction of the One,<br>
  you will not have to suffer the pains of reincarnation again.<br>
  Your body will become cool, immaculate and pure.<br>
  The Lord was said to be far away, but He is found near at hand. ||12||<br>
  On the twelfth day of the lunar cycle, twelve suns rise.<br>
  Day and night, the celestial bugles vibrate the unstruck melody.<br>
  Then, one beholds the Father of the three worlds.<br>
  This is wonderful! The human being has become God! ||13||<br>
  On the thirteenth day of the lunar cycle, the thirteen holy books proclaim<br>
  that you must recognize the Lord in the nether regions of the underworld as well as the heavens.<br>
  There is no high or low, no honor or dishonor.<br>
  The Lord is pervading and permeating all. ||14||<br>
  On the fourteenth day of the lunar cycle, in the fourteen worlds<br>
  and on each and every hair, the Lord abides.<br>
  Center yourself and meditate on truth and contentment.<br>
  Speak the speech of God's spiritual wisdom. ||15||<br>
  On the day of the full moon, the full moon fills the heavens.<br>
  Its power is diffused through its gentle light.<br>
  In the beginning, in the end, and in the middle, God remains firm and steady.<br>
  Kabeer is immersed in the ocean of peace. ||16||<br>

  Raag Gauree, The Seven Days Of The Week Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord each and every day.<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, you shall come to know the mystery of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  On Sunday, begin the devotional worship of the Lord,<br>
  and restrain the desires within the temple of the body.<br>
  When your attention is focused day and night upon that imperishable place,<br>
  then the celestial flutes play the unstruck melody in tranquil peace and poise. ||1||<br>
  On Monday, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down from the moon.<br>
  Tasting it, all poisons are removed in an instant.<br>
  Restrained by Gurbani, the mind remains indoors;<br>
  drinking in this Nectar, it is intoxicated. ||2||<br>
  On Tuesday, understand reality;<br>
  you must know the way the five thieves work.<br>
  Those who leave their own home to go out wandering<br>
  shall feel the terrible wrath of the Lord, their King. ||3||<br>
  On Wednesday, one's understanding is enlightened.<br>
  The Lord comes to dwell in the lotus of the heart.<br>
  Meeting the Guru, one comes to look alike upon pleasure and pain,<br>
  and the inverted lotus is turned upright. ||4||<br>
  On Thursday, wash off your corruption.<br>
  Forsake the trinity, and attach yourself to the One God.<br>
  At the confluence of the three rivers of knowledge, right action and devotion, there,<br>
  why not wash away your sinful mistakes? ||5||<br>
  On Friday, keep up and complete your fast;<br>
  day and night, you must fight against your own self.<br>
  If you restrain your five senses,<br>
  then you shall not cast your glance on another. ||6||<br>
  On Saturday, keep the candle of God's Light steady within your heart;<br>
  you will be enlightened, inwardly and outwardly.<br>
  All your karma will be erased. ||7||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 195</h2></center>
  Know that as long as you place your hopes in others,<br>
  you shall not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>
  When you embrace love for the Lord,<br>
  says Kabeer, then, you shall become pure in your very fiber. ||8||1||<br>
  Raag Gauree Chaytee, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  God makes even stones float.<br>
  So why shouldn't Your humble slave also float across, chanting Your Name, O Lord? ||1||Pause||<br>
  You saved the prostitute, and the ugly hunch-back; You helped the hunter and Ajaamal swim across as well.<br>
  The hunter who shot Krishna in the foot - even he was liberated.<br>
  I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those who chant the Lord's Name. ||1||<br>
  You saved Bidur, the son of the slave-girl, and Sudama; You restored Ugrasain to his throne.<br>
  Without meditation, without penance, without a good family, without good deeds, Naam Dayv's Lord and Master saved them all. ||2||1||<br>
  Raag Gauree, Padas Of Ravi Daas Jee, Gauree Gwaarayree:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  The company I keep is wretched and low, and I am anxious day and night;<br>
  my actions are crooked, and I am of lowly birth. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, Master of the earth, Life of the soul,<br>
  please do not forget me! I am Your humble servant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Take away my pains, and bless Your humble servant with Your Sublime Love.<br>
  I shall not leave Your Feet, even though my body may perish. ||2||<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, I seek the protection of Your Sanctuary;<br>
  please, meet Your humble servant - do not delay! ||3||1||<br>
  Baygumpura, 'the city without sorrow', is the name of the town.<br>
  There is no suffering or anxiety there.<br>
  There are no troubles or taxes on commodities there.<br>
  There is no fear, blemish or downfall there. ||1||<br>
  Now, I have found this most excellent city.<br>
  There is lasting peace and safety there, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||<br>
  God's Kingdom is steady, stable and eternal.<br>
  There is no second or third status; all are equal there.<br>
  That city is populous and eternally famous.<br>
  Those who live there are wealthy and contented. ||2||<br>
  They stroll about freely, just as they please.<br>
  They know the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and no one blocks their way.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, the emancipated shoe-maker:<br>
  whoever is a citizen there, is a friend of mine. ||3||2||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan, Ravi Daas Jee:<br>
  The path to God is very treacherous and mountainous, and all I have is this worthless ox.<br>
  I offer this one prayer to the Lord, to preserve my capital. ||1||<br>
  Is there any merchant of the Lord to join me? My cargo is loaded, and now I am leaving. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 196</h2></center>
  I am the merchant of the Lord; I deal in spiritual wisdom.<br>
  I have loaded the Wealth of the Lord's Name; the world has loaded poison. ||2||<br>
  O you who know this world and the world beyond: write whatever nonsense you please about me.<br>
  The club of the Messenger of Death shall not strike me, since I have cast off all entanglements. ||3||<br>
  Love of this world is like the pale, temporary color of the safflower.<br>
  The color of my Lord's Love, however, is permanent, like the dye of the madder plant. So says Ravi Daas, the tanner. ||4||1||<br>
  Gauree Poorbee, Ravi Daas Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The frog in the deep well knows nothing of its own country or other lands;<br>
  just so, my mind, infatuated with corruption, understands nothing about this world or the next. ||1||<br>
  O Lord of all worlds: reveal to me, even for an instant, the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My intellect is polluted; I cannot understand Your state, O Lord.<br>
  Take pity on me, dispel my doubts, and teach me true wisdom. ||2||<br>
  Even the great Yogis cannot describe Your Glorious Virtues; they are beyond words.<br>
  I am dedicated to Your loving devotional worship, says Ravi Daas the tanner. ||3||1||<br>
  Gauree Bairaagan:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, was Truth; in the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga, charitable feasts; in the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga, there was worship.<br>
  In those three ages, people held to these three ways. But in the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the Lord is your only Support. ||1||<br>
  How can I swim across?<br>
  No one has explained to me,<br>
  so that I might understand how I can escape reincarnation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  So many forms of religion have been described; the whole world is practicing them.<br>
  What actions will bring emancipation, and total perfection? ||2||<br>
  One may distinguish between good and evil actions, and listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas,<br>
  but doubt still persists. Skepticism continually dwells in the heart, so who can eradicate egotistical pride? ||3||<br>
  Outwardly, he washes with water, but deep within, his heart is tarnished by all sorts of vices.<br>
  So how can he become pure? His method of purification is like that of an elephant, covering himself with dust right after his bath! ||4||<br>
  With the rising of the sun, the night is brought to its end; the whole world knows this.<br>
  It is believed that with the touch of the Philosopher's Stone, copper is immediately transformed into gold. ||5||<br>
  When one meets the Supreme Philosopher's Stone, the Guru, if such pre-ordained destiny is written on one's forehead,<br>
  then the soul blends with the Supreme Soul, and the stubborn doors are opened wide. ||6||<br>
  Through the way of devotion, the intellect is imbued with Truth; doubts, entanglements and vices are cut away.<br>
  The mind is restrained, and one attains joy, contemplating the One Lord, who is both with and without qualities. ||7||<br>
  I have tried many methods, but by turning it away, the noose of doubt is not turned away.<br>
  Love and devotion have not welled up within me, and so Ravi Daas is sad and depressed. ||8||1||<br>
