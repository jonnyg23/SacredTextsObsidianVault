 <hr><center><h1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Sorat'h</h1></center>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 001</h2></center>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<br>
  Death comes to all, and all must suffer separation.<br>
  Go and ask the clever people, whether they shall meet in the world hereafter.<br>
  Those who forget my Lord and Master shall suffer in terrible pain. ||1||<br>
  So praise the True Lord,<br>
  by whose Grace peace ever prevails. ||Pause||<br>
  Praise Him as great; He is, and He shall ever be.<br>
  You alone are the Great Giver; mankind cannot give anything.<br>
  Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass; what good does it do to cry out in protest? ||2||<br>
  Many have proclaimed their sovereignty over millions of fortresses on the earth, but they have now departed.<br>
  And those, whom even the sky could not contain, had ropes put through their noses.<br>
  O mind, if you only knew the torment in your future, you would not relish the sweet pleasures of the present. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, as many as are the sins one commits, so many are the chains around his neck.<br>
  If he possesses virtues, then the chains are cut away; these virtues are his brothers, his true brothers.<br>
  Going to the world hereafter, those who have no Guru are not accepted; they are beaten, and expelled. ||4||1||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House:<br>
  Make your mind the farmer, good deeds the farm, modesty the water, and your body the field.<br>
  Let the Lord's Name be the seed, contentment the plow, and your humble dress the fence.<br>
  Doing deeds of love, the seed shall sprout, and you shall see your home flourish. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, the wealth of Maya does not go with anyone.<br>
  This Maya has bewitched the world, but only a rare few understand this. ||Pause||<br>
  Make your ever-decreasing life your shop, and make the Lord's Name your merchandise.<br>
  Make understanding and contemplation your warehouse, and in that warehouse, store the Lord's Name.<br>
  Deal with the Lord's dealers, earn your profits, and rejoice in your mind. ||2||<br>
  Let your trade be listening to scripture, and let Truth be the horses you take to sell.<br>
  Gather up merits for your travelling expenses, and do not think of tomorrow in your mind.<br>
  When you arrive in the land of the Formless Lord, you shall find peace in the Mansion of His Presence. ||3||<br>
  Let your service be the focusing of your consciousness, and let your occupation be the placing of faith in the Naam.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 002</h2></center>
  Let your work be restraint from sin; only then will people call you blessed.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord shall look upon you with His Glance of Grace, and you shall be blessed with honor four times over. ||4||2||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, Chau-Tukas:<br>
  The son is dear to his mother and father; he is the wise son-in-law to his father-in-law.<br>
  The father is dear to his son and daughter, and the brother is very dear to his brother.<br>
  By the Order of the Lord's Command, he leaves his house and goes outside, and in an instant, everything becomes alien to him.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh does not remember the Name of the Lord, does not give in charity, and does not cleanse his consciousness; his body rolls in the dust. ||1||<br>
  The mind is comforted by the Comforter of the Naam.<br>
  I fall at the Guru's feet - I am a sacrifice to Him; He has given me to understand the true understanding. ||Pause||<br>
  The mind is impressed with the false love of the world; he quarrels with the Lord's humble servant.<br>
  Infatuated with Maya, night and day, he sees only the worldly path; he does not chant the Naam, and drinking poison, he dies.<br>
  He is imbued and infatuated with vicious talk; the Word of the Shabad does not come into his consciousness.<br>
  He is not imbued with the Lord's Love, and he is not impressed by the taste of the Name; the self-willed manmukh loses his honor. ||2||<br>
  He does not enjoy celestial peace in the Company of the Holy, and there is not even a bit of sweetness on his tongue.<br>
  He calls his mind, body and wealth his own; he has no knowledge of the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Closing his eyes, he walks in darkness; he cannot see the home of his own being, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Tied up at Death's door, he finds no place of rest; he receives the rewards of his own actions. ||3||<br>
  When the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then I see Him with my own eyes; He is indescribable, and cannot be described.<br>
  With my ears, I continually listen to the Word of the Shabad, and I praise Him; His Ambrosial Name abides within my heart.<br>
  He is Fearless, Formless and absolutely without vengeance; I am absorbed in His Perfect Light.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Guru, doubt is not dispelled; through the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained. ||4||3||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, Du-Tukas:<br>
  In the realm of land, and in the realm of water, Your seat is the chamber of the four directions.<br>
  Yours is the one and only form of the entire universe; Your mouth is the mint to fashion all. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord Master, Your play is so wonderful!<br>
  You are pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; You Yourself are contained in all. ||Pause||<br>
  Wherever I look, there I see Your Light, but what is Your form?<br>
  You have one form, but it is unseen; there is none like any other. ||2||<br>
  The beings born of eggs, born of the womb, born of the earth and born of sweat, all are created by You.<br>
  I have seen one glory of Yours, that You are pervading and permeating in all. ||3||<br>
  Your Glories are so numerous, and I do not know even one of them; I am such a fool - please, give me some of them!<br>
  Prays Nanak, listen, O my Lord Master: I am sinking like a stone - please, save me! ||4||4||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl:<br>
  I am a wicked sinner and a great hypocrite; You are the Immaculate and Formless Lord.<br>
  Tasting the Ambrosial Nectar, I am imbued with supreme bliss; O Lord and Master, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||<br>
  O Creator Lord, You are the honor of the dishonored.<br>
  In my lap is the honor and glory of the wealth of the Name; I merge into the True Word of the Shabad. ||Pause||<br>
  You are perfect, while I am worthless and imperfect. You are profound, while I am trivial.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 003</h2></center>
  My mind is imbued with You, day and night and morning, O Lord; my tongue chants Your Name, and my mind meditates on You. ||2||<br>
  You are True, and I am absorbed into You; through the mystery of the Shabad, I shall ultimately become True as well.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the Naam day and night are pure, while those who die to be reborn are impure. ||3||<br>
  I do not see any other like the Lord; who else should I praise? No one is equal to Him.<br>
  Prays Nanak, I am the slave of His slaves; by Guru's Instruction, I know Him. ||4||5||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl:<br>
  He is unknowable, infinite, unapproachable and imperceptible. He is not subject to death or karma.<br>
  His caste is casteless; He is unborn, self-illumined, and free of doubt and desire. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the Truest of the True.<br>
  He has no form, no color and no features; through the True Word of the Shabad, He reveals Himself. ||Pause||<br>
  He has no mother, father, sons or relatives; He is free of sexual desire; He has no wife.<br>
  He has no ancestry; He is immaculate. He is infinite and endless; O Lord, Your Light is pervading all. ||2||<br>
  Deep within each and every heart, God is hidden; His Light is in each and every heart.<br>
  The heavy doors are opened by Guru's Instructions; one becomes fearless, in the trance of deep meditation. ||3||<br>
  The Lord created all beings, and placed death over the heads of all; all the world is under His Power.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, the treasure is obtained; living the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. ||4||<br>
  In the pure vessel, the True Name is contained; how few are those who practice true conduct.<br>
  The individual soul is united with the Supreme Soul; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||5||6||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl:<br>
  Like a fish without water is the faithless cynic, who dies of thirst.<br>
  So shall you die, O mind, without the Lord, as your breath goes in vain. ||1||<br>
  O mind, chant the Lord's Name, and praise Him.<br>
  Without the Guru, how will you obtain this juice? The Guru shall unite you with the Lord. ||Pause||<br>
  For the Gurmukh, meeting with the Society of the Saints is like making a pilgrimage to a sacred shrine.<br>
  The benefit of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage is obtained by the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||2||<br>
  Like the Yogi without abstinence, and like penance without truth and contentment,<br>
  so is the body without the Lord's Name; death will slay it, because of the sin within. ||3||<br>
  The faithless cynic does not obtain the Lord's Love; the Lord's Love is obtained only through the True Guru.<br>
  One who meets with the Guru, the Giver of pleasure and pain, says Nanak, is absorbed in the Lord's Praise. ||4||7||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl:<br>
  You, God, are the Giver of gifts, the Lord of perfect understanding; I am a mere beggar at Your Door.<br>
  What should I beg for? Nothing remains permanent; O Lord, please, bless me with Your Beloved Name. ||1||<br>
  In each and every heart, the Lord, the Lord of the forest, is permeating and pervading.<br>
  In the water, on the land, and in the sky, He is pervading but hidden; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is revealed. ||Pause||<br>
  In this world, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in the Akaashic Ethers, the Guru, the True Guru, has shown me the Lord; He has showered me with His Mercy.<br>
  He is the unborn Lord God; He is, and shall ever be. Deep within your heart, behold Him, the Destroyer of ego. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 004</h2></center>
  This wretched world is caught in birth and death; in the love of duality, it has forgotten devotional worship of the Lord.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, the Guru's Teachings are obtained; the faithless cynic loses the game of life. ||3||<br>
  Breaking my bonds, the True Guru has set me free, and I shall not be cast into the womb of reincarnation again.<br>
  O Nanak, the jewel of spiritual wisdom shines forth, and the Lord, the Formless Lord, dwells within my mind. ||4||8||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl:<br>
  The treasure of the Name, for which you have come into the world - that Ambrosial Nectar is with the Guru.<br>
  Renounce costumes, disguises and clever tricks; this fruit is not obtained by duplicity. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, remain steady, and do not wander away.<br>
  By searching around on the outside, you shall only suffer great pain; the Ambrosial Nectar is found within the home of your own being. ||Pause||<br>
  Renounce corruption, and seek virtue; committing sins, you shall only come to regret and repent.<br>
  You do not know the difference between good and evil; again and again, you sink into the mud. ||2||<br>
  Within you is the great filth of greed and falsehood; why do you bother to wash your body on the outside?<br>
  Chant the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord always, under Guru's Instruction; only then will your innermost being be emancipated. ||3||<br>
  Let greed and slander be far away from you, and renounce falsehood; through the True Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall obtain the true fruit.<br>
  As it pleases You, You preserve me, Dear Lord; servant Nanak sings the Praises of Your Shabad. ||4||9||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:<br>
  You cannot save your own home from being plundered; why do you spy on the houses of others?<br>
  That Gurmukh who joins himself to the Guru's service, saves his own home, and tastes the Lord's Nectar. ||1||<br>
  O mind, you must realize what your intellect is focused on.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is involved with other tastes; the unfortunate wretch shall come to regret it in the end. ||Pause||<br>
  When things come, he is pleased, but when they go, he weeps and wails; this pain and pleasure remains attached to him.<br>
  The Lord Himself causes him to enjoy pleasure and endure pain; the Gurmukh, however, remains unaffected. ||2||<br>
  What else can be said to be above the subtle essence of the Lord? One who drinks it in is satisfied and satiated.<br>
  One who is lured by Maya loses this juice; that faithless cynic is tied to his evil-mindedness. ||3||<br>
  The Lord is the life of the mind, the Master of the breath of life; the Divine Lord is contained in the body.<br>
  If You so bless us, Lord, then we sing Your Praises; the mind is satisfied and fulfilled, lovingly attached to the Lord. ||4||<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the subtle essence of the Lord is obtained; meeting the Guru, the fear of death departs.<br>
  O Nanak, chant the Name of the Lord, as Gurmukh; you shall obtain the Lord, and realize your pre-ordained destiny. ||5||10||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl:<br>
  Destiny, pre-ordained by the Lord, looms over the heads of all beings; no one is without this pre-ordained destiny.<br>
  Only He Himself is beyond destiny; creating the creation by His creative power, He beholds it, and causes His Command to be followed. ||1||<br>
  O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and be at peace.<br>
  Day and night, serve at the Guru's feet; the Lord is the Giver, and the Enjoyer. ||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 005</h2></center>
  He is within - see Him outside as well; there is no one, other than Him.<br>
  As Gurmukh, look upon all with the single eye of equality; in each and every heart, the Divine Light is contained. ||2||<br>
  Restrain your fickle mind, and keep it steady within its own home; meeting the Guru, this understanding is obtained.<br>
  Seeing the unseen Lord, you shall be amazed and delighted; forgetting your pain, you shall be at peace. ||3||<br>
  Drinking in the ambrosial nectar, you shall attain the highest bliss, and dwell within the home of your own self.<br>
  So sing the Praises of the Lord, the Destroyer of the fear of birth and death, and you shall not be reincarnated again. ||4||<br>
  The essence, the immaculate Lord, the Light of all - I am He and He is me - there is no difference between us.<br>
  The Infinite Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God - Nanak has met with Him, the Guru. ||5||11||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, Third House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  When I am pleasing to Him, then I sing His Praises.<br>
  Singing His Praises, I receive the fruits of my rewards.<br>
  The rewards of singing His Praises are obtained when He Himself gives them. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the treasure is obtained;<br>
  this is why I remain immersed in the True Name. ||Pause||<br>
  When I awoke within myself to the Guru's Teachings,<br>
  then I renounced my fickle intellect.<br>
  When the Light of the Guru's Teachings dawned,<br>
  and then all darkness was dispelled. ||2||<br>
  When the mind is attached to the Guru's Feet,<br>
  then the Path of Death recedes.<br>
  Through the Fear of God, one attains the Fearless Lord;<br>
  then, one enters the home of celestial bliss. ||3||<br>
  Prays Nanak, how rare are those who reflect and understand,<br>
  the most sublime action in this world.<br>
  The noblest deed is to sing the Lord's Praises,<br>
  and so meet the Lord Himself. ||4||1||12||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  All of Your servants, who relish the Word of Your Shabad, serve You.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they become pure, eradicating self-conceit from within.<br>
  Night and day, they continually sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; they are adorned with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord and Master, I am Your child; I seek Your Sanctuary.<br>
  You are the One and Only Lord, the Truest of the True; You Yourself are the Destroyer of ego. ||Pause||<br>
  Those who remain wakeful obtain God; through the Word of the Shabad, they conquer their ego.<br>
  Immersed in family life, the Lord's humble servant ever remains detached; he reflects upon the essence of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, he finds eternal peace, and he keeps the Lord enshrined in his heart. ||2||<br>
  This mind wanders in the ten directions; it is consumed by the love of duality.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 006</h2></center>
  The foolish self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord's Name; he wastes away his life in vain.<br>
  But when he meets the True Guru, then he obtains the Name; he sheds egotism and emotional attachment. ||3||<br>
  The Lord's humble servants are True - they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is my wealth. ||4||1||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<br>
  The True Lord has blessed His devotees with the treasure of devotional worship, and the wealth of the Lord's Name.<br>
  The wealth of the Naam, shall never be exhausted; no one can estimate its worth.<br>
  With the wealth of the Naam, their faces are radiant, and they attain the True Lord. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found.<br>
  Without the Shabad, the world wanders around, and receives its punishment in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||<br>
  Within this body dwell the five thieves: sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and egotism.<br>
  They plunder the Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not realize it; no one hears his complaint.<br>
  The world is blind, and its dealings are blind as well; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. ||2||<br>
  Indulging in egotism and possessiveness, they are ruined; when they depart, nothing goes along with them.<br>
  But one who becomes Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and ever contemplates the Lord's Name.<br>
  Through the True Word of Gurbani, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, he is enraptured. ||3||<br>
  The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is a steady light within the heart. The Lord's decree is over the heads of even kings.<br>
  Night and day, the Lord's devotees worship Him; night and day, they gather in the true profit of the Lord's Name.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; attuned to the Shabad, he finds the Lord. ||4||2||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<br>
  If one becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves, then he finds the Lord, and eradicates ego from within.<br>
  The Lord of bliss is his object of devotion; night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the Lord's devotees remain ever as one, absorbed in the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O Dear Lord, Your Glance of Grace is True.<br>
  Show mercy to Your slave, O Beloved Lord, and preserve my honor. ||Pause||<br>
  Continually praising the Word of the Shabad, I live; under Guru's Instruction, my fear has been dispelled.<br>
  My True Lord God is so beautiful! Serving the Guru, my consciousness is focused on Him.<br>
  One who chants the True Word of the Shabad, and the Truest of the True, the Word of His Bani, remains wakeful, day and night. ||2||<br>
  He is so very deep and profound, the Giver of eternal peace; no one can find His limit.<br>
  Serving the Perfect Guru, one becomes carefree, enshrining the Lord within the mind.<br>
  The mind and body become immaculately pure, and a lasting peace fills the heart; doubt is eradicated from within. ||3||<br>
  The Way of the Lord is always such a difficult path; only a few find it, contemplating the Guru.<br>
  Imbued with the Lord's Love, and intoxicated with the Shabad, he renounces ego and corruption.<br>
  O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, and the Love of the One Lord, he is embellished with the Word of the Shabad. ||4||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 007</h2></center>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<br>
  Dear Beloved Lord, I praise You continually, as long as there is the breath within my body.<br>
  If I were to forget You, for a moment, even for an instant, O Lord Master, it would be like fifty years for me.<br>
  I was always such a fool and an idiot, O Siblings of Destiny, but now, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, my mind is enlightened. ||1||<br>
  Dear Lord, You Yourself bestow understanding.<br>
  Dear Lord, I am forever a sacrifice to You; I am dedicated and devoted to Your Name. ||Pause||<br>
  I have died in the Word of the Shabad, and through the Shabad, I am dead while yet alive, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Shabad, I have been liberated.<br>
  Through the Shabad, my mind and body have been purified, and the Lord has come to dwell within my mind.<br>
  The Guru is the Giver of the Shabad; my mind is imbued with it, and I remain absorbed in the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Those who do not know the Shabad are blind and deaf; why did they even bother to come into the world?<br>
  They do not obtain the subtle essence of the Lord's elixir; they waste away their lives, and are reincarnated over and over again.<br>
  The blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs are like maggots in manure, and in manure they rot away. ||3||<br>
  The Lord Himself creates us, watches over us, and places us on the Path, O Siblings of Destiny; there is no one other than Him.<br>
  No one can erase that which is pre-ordained, O Siblings of Destiny; whatever the Creator wills, comes to pass.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the mind; O Siblings of Destiny, there is no other at all. ||4||4||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<br>
  The Gurmukhs practice devotional worship, and become pleasing to God; night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  You Yourself protect and take care of Your devotees, who are pleasing to Your Mind.<br>
  You are the Giver of virtue, realized through the Word of Your Shabad. Uttering Your Glories, we merge with You, O Glorious Lord. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, remember always the Dear Lord.<br>
  At the very last moment, He alone shall be your best friend; He shall always stand by you. ||Pause||<br>
  The gathering of the wicked enemies shall always practice falsehood; they do not contemplate understanding.<br>
  Who can obtain fruit from the slander of evil enemies? Remember that Harnaakhash was torn apart by the Lord's claws.<br>
  Prahlaad, the Lord's humble servant, constantly sang the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Dear Lord saved him. ||2||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs see themselves as being very virtuous; they have absolutely no understanding at all.<br>
  They indulge in slander of the humble spiritual people; they waste their lives away, and then they have to depart.<br>
  They never think of the Lord's Name, and in the end, they depart, regretting and repenting. ||3||<br>
  The Lord makes the lives of His devotees fruitful; He Himself links them to the Guru's service.<br>
  Imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and intoxicated with celestial bliss, night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Slave Nanak utters this prayer: O Lord, please, let me fall at their feet. ||4||5||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<br>
  He alone is a Sikh, a friend, a relative and a sibling, who walks in the Way of the Guru's Will.<br>
  One who walks according to his own will, O Siblings of Destiny, suffers separation from the Lord, and shall be punished.<br>
  Without the True Guru, peace is never obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; again and again, he regrets and repents. ||1||<br>
  The Lord's slaves are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 008</h2></center>
  The sins and sorrows of countless lifetimes are eradicated; the Lord Himself unites them in His Union. ||Pause||<br>
  All of these relatives are like chains upon the soul, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is deluded by doubt.<br>
  Without the Guru, the chains cannot be broken; the Gurmukhs find the door of salvation.<br>
  One who performs rituals without realizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad, shall die and be reborn, again and again. ||2||<br>
  The world is entangled in egotism and possessiveness, O Siblings of Destiny, but no one belongs to anyone else.<br>
  The Gurmukhs attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, singing the Glories of the Lord; they dwell in the home of their own inner being.<br>
  One who understands here, realizes himself; the Lord God belongs to him. ||3||<br>
  The True Guru is forever merciful, O Siblings of Destiny; without good destiny, what can anyone obtain?<br>
  He looks alike upon all with His Glance of Grace, but people receive the fruits of their rewards according to their love for the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, when the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind, then self-conceit is eradicated from within. ||4||6||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Chau-Tukas:<br>
  True devotional worship is obtained only through the True Guru, when the True Word of His Bani is in the heart.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained; egotism is obliterated through the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Without the Guru, there is no true devotion; otherwise, people wander around, deluded by ignorance.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs wander around, suffering in constant pain; they drown and die, even without water. ||1||<br>
  O Siblings of Destiny, remain forever in the Lord's Sanctuary, under His Protection.<br>
  Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He preserves our honor, and blesses us with the glory of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, one comes to understand himself, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  The Lord, the Life of the world, ever abides in his heart, and he renounces sexual desire, anger and egotism.<br>
  The Lord is ever-present, permeating and pervading all places; the Name of the Infinite Lord is enshrined within the heart.<br>
  Throughout the ages, through the Word of His Bani, His Shabad is realized, and the Name becomes so sweet and beloved to the mind. ||2||<br>
  Serving the Guru, one realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord; fruitful is his life, and his coming into the world.<br>
  Tasting the sublime elixir of the Lord, his mind is satisfied and satiated forever; singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, he is fulfilled and satisfied.<br>
  The lotus of his heart blossoms forth, he is ever imbued with the Lord's Love, and the unstruck melody of the Shabad resounds within him.<br>
  His body and mind become immaculately pure; his speech becomes immaculate as well, and he merges in the Truest of the True. ||3||<br>
  No one knows the state of the Lord's Name; through the Guru's Teachings, it comes to abide in the heart.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the Path; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord's Nectar.<br>
  Meditation, austere self-discipline and self-restraint are all obtained from the Guru; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide within the heart.<br>
  O Nanak, those humble beings who praise the Naam are beautiful; they are honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||7||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, one turns away from the world, O Siblings of Destiny; when he remains dead while yet alive, he obtains true understanding.<br>
  He alone is the Guru, and he alone is a Sikh, O Siblings of Destiny, whose light merges in the Light. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, be lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Chanting the Name of the Lord, it seems so sweet to the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; the Gurmukhs obtain a place in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 009</h2></center>
  Without the Guru, love for the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny; the self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in the love of duality.<br>
  Actions performed by the manmukh are like the threshing of the chaff - they obtain nothing for their efforts. ||2||<br>
  Meeting the Guru, the Naam comes to permeate the mind, O Siblings of Destiny, with true love and affection.<br>
  He always sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, with infinite love for the Guru. ||3||<br>
  How blessed and approved is his coming into the world, O Siblings of Destiny, who focuses his mind on serving the Guru.<br>
  O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and we merge with the Lord. ||4||8||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:<br>
  The three worlds are entangled in the three qualities, O Siblings of Destiny; the Guru imparts understanding.<br>
  Attached to the Lord's Name, one is emancipated, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the wise ones about this. ||1||<br>
  O mind, renounce the three qualities, and focus your consciousness on the fourth state.<br>
  The Dear Lord abides in the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; ever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||Pause||<br>
  From the Naam, everyone originated, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, they die away.<br>
  The ignorant world is blind, O Siblings of Destiny; those who sleep are plundered. ||2||<br>
  Those Gurmukhs who remain awake are saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  In this world, the Name of the Lord is the true profit, O Siblings of Destiny; keep it enshrined within your heart. ||3||<br>
  In the Guru's Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny, you shall be saved; be lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name.<br>
  O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is the boat, and the Name is the raft, O Siblings of Destiny; setting out on it, the Lord's humble servant crosses over the world-ocean. ||4||9||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:<br>
  The True Guru is the ocean of peace in the world; there is no other place of rest and peace.<br>
  The world is afflicted with the painful disease of egotism; dying, only to be reborn, it cries out in pain. ||1||<br>
  O mind, serve the True Guru, and obtain peace.<br>
  If you serve the True Guru, you shall find peace; otherwise, you shall depart, after wasting away your life in vain. ||Pause||<br>
  Led around by the three qualities, he does many deeds, but he does not come to taste and savor the subtle essence of the Lord.<br>
  He says his evening prayers, and makes offerings of water, and recites his morning prayers, but without true understanding, he still suffers in pain. ||2||<br>
  One who serves the True Guru is very fortunate; as the Lord so wills, he meets with the Guru.<br>
  Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, His humble servants remain ever satisfied; they eradicate self-conceit from within themselves. ||3||<br>
  This world is blind, and all act blindly; without the Guru, no one finds the Path.<br>
  O Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, one sees with his eyes, and finds the True Lord within the home of his own being. ||4||10||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, he suffers in terrible pain, and throughout the four ages, he wanders aimlessly.<br>
  I am poor and meek, and throughout the ages, You are the Great Giver - please, grant me the understanding of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  O Dear Beloved Lord, please show mercy to me.<br>
  Unite me in the Union of the True Guru, the Great Giver, and give me the support of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||<br>
  Conquering my desires and duality, I have merged in celestial peace, and I have found the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord.<br>
  I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord, and my soul has become immaculately pure; the Lord is the Destroyer of sins. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 010</h2></center>
  Dying in the Word of the Shabad, you shall live forever, and you shall never die again.<br>
  The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam is ever-sweet to the mind; but how few are those who obtain the Shabad. ||3||<br>
  The Great Giver keeps His Gifts in His Hand; He gives them to those with whom He is pleased.<br>
  O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, they find peace, and in the Court of the Lord, they are exalted. ||4||11||<br>
  Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<br>
  Serving the True Guru, the divine melody wells up within, and one is blessed with wisdom and salvation.<br>
  The True Name of the Lord comes to abide in the mind, and through the Name, one merges in the Name. ||1||<br>
  Without the True Guru, the whole world is insane.<br>
  The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not realize the Word of the Shabad; they are deluded by false doubts. ||Pause||<br>
  The three-faced Maya had led them astray in doubt, and they are snared by the noose of egotism.<br>
  Birth and death hang over their heads, and being reborn from the womb, they suffer in pain. ||2||<br>
  The three qualities permeate the whole world; acting in ego, it loses its honor.<br>
  But one who becomes Gurmukh comes to realize the fourth state of celestial bliss; he finds peace through the Name of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  The three qualities are all Yours, O Lord; You Yourself created them. Whatever You do, comes to pass.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; through the Shabad, he is rid of egotism. ||4||12||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, First House:<br>

  The Beloved Himself enjoys every heart; He is contained within every woman and man.<br>
  O Nanak, the Beloved is pervading everywhere, but He is hidden; through the Guru, He is revealed. ||4||2||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  He Himself, the Beloved, is Himself all-in-all; He Himself establishes and disestablishes.<br>
  The Beloved Himself beholds, and rejoices; God Himself works wonders, and beholds them.<br>
  The Beloved Himself is contained in all the woods and meadows; as Gurmukh, He reveals Himself. ||1||<br>

  God Himself is the balance scale, He Himself is the weigher, and He Himself weighs with the weights.<br>
  He Himself is the banker, He Himself is the trader, and He Himself makes the trades.<br>
  The Beloved Himself fashioned the world, and He Himself counter-balances it with a gram. ||1||<br>
  My mind meditates on the Lord, Har, Har, and finds peace.<br>

  Whoever harbors pride shall be destroyed, O Beloved; meditating on the Lord, Nanak is absorbed in devotional worship. ||4||6||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Du-Tukas:<br>
  Separated from the Lord for countless lifetimes, the self-willed manmukh suffers in pain, engaged in acts of egotism.<br>
  Beholding the Holy Saint, I found God; O Lord of the Universe, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||<br>
  The Love of God is very dear to me.<br>
  When I joined the Sat Sangat, the Company of the Holy People, the Lord, the embodiment of peace, came into my heart. ||Pause||<br>
  You dwell, hidden, within my heart day and night, Lord; but the poor fools do not understand Your Love.<br>
  Meeting with the Almighty True Guru, God was revealed to me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and reflect upon His Glories. ||2||<br>
  As Gurmukh, I have become enlightened; peace has come, and evil-mindedness has been dispelled from my mind.<br>
  Understanding the relationship of the individual soul with God, I have found peace, in Your Sat Sangat, Your True Congregation, O Lord. ||3||<br>
  Those who are blessed by Your Kind Mercy, meet the Almighty Lord, and find the Guru.<br>
  Nanak has found the immeasurable, celestial peace; night and day, he remains awake to the Lord, the Master of the Forest of the Universe. ||4||7||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The inner depths of my mind are pierced by love for the Lord; I cannot live without the Lord.<br>
  Just as the fish dies without water, I die without the Lord's Name. ||1||<br>
  O my God, please bless me with the water of Your Name.<br>
  I beg for Your Name, deep within myself, day and night; through the Name, I find peace. ||Pause||<br>
  The song-bird cries out for lack of water - without water, its thirst cannot be quenched.<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the water of celestial bliss, and is rejuvenated, blossoming forth through the blessed Love of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are hungry, wandering around in the ten directions; without the Name, they suffer in pain.<br>
  They are born, only to die, and enter into reincarnation again; in the Court of the Lord, they are punished. ||3||<br>
  But if the Lord shows His Mercy, then one comes to sing His Glorious Praises; deep within the nucleus of his own self, he finds the sublime essence of the Lord's elixir.<br>
  The Lord has become Merciful to meek Nanak, and through the Word of the Shabad, his desires are quenched. ||4||8||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Panch-Padas:<br>
  If one eats the uneatable, then he becomes a Siddha, a being of perfect spirituality; through this perfection, he obtains wisdom.<br>
  When the arrow of the Lord's Love pierces his body, then his doubt is eradicated. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord of the Universe, please bless Your humble servant with glory.<br>
  Under Guru's Instructions, enlighten me with the Lord's Name, that I may dwell forever in Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||<br>
  This whole world is engrossed in coming and going; O my foolish and ignorant mind, be mindful of the Lord.<br>
  O Dear Lord, please, take pity upon me, and unite me with the Guru, that I may merge in the Lord's Name. ||2||<br>
  Only one who has it knows God; he alone has it, to whom God has given it - so very beautiful, unapproachable and unfathomable. Through the Perfect Guru, the unknowable is known. ||3||<br>
  Only one who tastes it knows it, like the mute, who tastes the sweet candy, but cannot speak of it.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 014</h2></center>

  He alone receives the gift, unto whom You give it; O servant Nanak, there is no one else. ||5||9||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Ti-Tukas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Who should I ask? Who should I worship? All were created by Him.<br>
  Whoever appears to be the greatest of the great, shall ultimately be mixed with the dust.<br>
  The Fearless, Formless Lord, the Destroyer of Fear bestows all comforts, and the nine treasures. ||1||<br>
  O Dear Lord, Your gifts alone satisfy me.<br>
  Why should I praise the poor helpless man? Why should I feel subservient to him? ||Pause||<br>
  All things come to one who meditates on the Lord; the Lord satisfies his hunger.<br>
  The Lord, the Giver of peace, bestows such wealth, that it can never be exhausted.<br>
  I am in ecstasy, absorbed in celestial peace; the True Guru has united me in His Union. ||2||<br>
  O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; worship the Naam, night and day, and recite the Naam.<br>
  Listen to the Teachings of the Holy Saints, and all fear of death will be dispelled.<br>
  Those blessed by God's Grace are attached to the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||3||<br>
  Who can estimate Your worth, God? You are kind and compassionate to all beings.<br>
  Everything which You do, prevails; I am just a poor child - what can I do?<br>
  Protect and preserve Your servant Nanak; be kind to him, like a father to his son. ||4||1||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Chau-Tukas:<br>
  Praise the Guru, and the Lord of the Universe, O Siblings of Destiny; enshrine Him in your mind, body and heart.<br>
  Let the True Lord and Master abide in your mind, O Siblings of Destiny; this is the most excellent way of life.<br>
  Those bodies, in which the Name of the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny - those bodies are reduced to ashes.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Siblings of Destiny; they take the Support of the One and Only Lord. ||1||<br>
  So worship and adore that True Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; He alone does everything.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has taught me, O Siblings of Destiny, that without Him, there is no other at all. ||Pause||<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they putrefy and die, O Siblings of Destiny; their numbers cannot be counted.<br>
  Without Truth, purity cannot be achieved, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is true and unfathomable.<br>
  Coming and going do not end, O Siblings of Destiny; pride in worldly valuables is false.<br>
  The Gurmukh saves millions of people, O Siblings of Destiny, blessing them with even a particle of the Name. ||2||<br>
  I have searched through the Simritees and the Shaastras, O Siblings of Destiny - without the True Guru, doubt does not depart.<br>
  They are so tired of performing their many deeds, O Siblings of Destiny, but they fall into bondage again and again.<br>
  I have searched in the four directions, O Siblings of Destiny, but without the True Guru, there is no place at all.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 015</h2></center>
  By great good fortune, I found the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, and I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<br>
  The Truth is forever pure, O Siblings of Destiny; those who are true are pure.<br>
  When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, O Siblings of Destiny, then one obtains Him.<br>
  Among millions, O Siblings of Destiny, hardly one humble servant of the Lord is found.<br>
  Nanak is imbued with the True Name, O Siblings of Destiny; hearing it, the mind and body become immaculately pure. ||4||2||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Du-Tukas:<br>
  As long as this person believes in love and hate, it is difficult for him to meet the Lord.<br>
  As long as he discriminates between himself and others, he will distance himself from the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, grant me such understanding,<br>
  that I might serve the Holy Saints, and seek the protection of their feet, and not forget them, for a moment, even an instant. ||Pause||<br>
  O foolish, thoughtless and fickle mind, such understanding did not come into your heart.<br>
  Renouncing the Lord of Life, you have become engrossed in other things, and you are involved with your enemies. ||2||<br>
  Sorrow does not afflict one who does not harbor self-conceit; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have attained this understanding.<br>
  Know that the babbling of the faithless cynic is like wind passing by. ||3||<br>
  This mind is inundated by millions of sins - what can I say?<br>
  Nanak, Your humble servant has come to Your Sanctuary, God; please, erase all his accounts. ||4||3||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Children, spouses, men and women in one's household, are all bound by Maya.<br>
  At the very last moment, none of them shall stand by you; their love is totally false. ||1||<br>
  O man, why do you pamper your body so?<br>
  It shall disperse like a cloud of smoke; vibrate upon the One, the Beloved Lord. ||Pause||<br>
  There are three ways in which the body can be consumed - it can be thrown into water, given to the dogs, or cremated to ashes.<br>
  He considers himself to be immortal; he sits in his home, and forgets the Lord, the Cause of causes. ||2||<br>
  In various ways, the Lord has fashioned the beads, and strung them on a slender thread.<br>
  The thread shall break, O wretched man, and then, you shall repent and regret. ||3||<br>
  He created you, and after creating you, He adorned you - meditate on Him day and night.<br>
  God has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; I hold tight to the Support of the True Guru. ||4||4||<br>

  I met the True Guru, by great good fortune, and my mind has been enlightened.<br>
  No one else can equal me, because I have the loving support of my Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.<br>
  I am at peace in this world, and I shall be in celestial peace in the next; my home is filled with bliss. ||Pause||<br>
  He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Creator, my Lord and Master.<br>

  The Lord and Master acts, and causes us to act; union is in His Hands. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, no one appears to be mistaken, to one who has dispelled his own doubts; he realizes that everyone is God. ||Pause||<br>
  One whose mind is comforted in the Society of the Saints, believes that all are joyful.<br>
  One whose mind is afflicted by the disease of egotism, cries out in birth and death. ||2||<br>
  Everything is clear to one whose eyes are blessed with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  In the darkness of spiritual ignorance, he sees nothing at all; he wanders around in reincarnation, over and over again. ||3||<br>
  Hear my prayer, O Lord and Master; Nanak begs for this happiness:<br>
  whereever Your Holy Saints sing the Kirtan of Your Praises, let my mind be attached to that place. ||4||6||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  My body belongs to the Saints, my wealth belongs to the Saints, and my mind belongs to the Saints.<br>

  Whoever takes to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, is carried across. ||Pause||<br>
  Millions of sins are erased by serving the humble Saints, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with love.<br>
  One finds peace in this world, and one's face is radiant in the next world, by associating with the humble Saints, through great good fortune. ||2||<br>
  I have only one tongue, and the Lord's humble servant is filled with countless virtues; how can I sing his praises?<br>
  The inaccessible, unapproachable and eternally unchanging Lord is obtained in the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||3||<br>
  I am worthless, lowly, without friends or support, and full of sins; I long for the Shelter of the Saints.<br>
  I am drowning in the deep, dark pit of household attachments - please save me, Lord! ||4||7||<br>

  God is the Lord and Master of millions of universes; He is the Giver of all beings.<br>
  He ever cherishes and cares for all beings, but the fool does not appreciate any of His virtues. ||1||<br>
  I do not know how to worship the Lord in adoration.<br>
  I can only repeat, "Lord, Lord, Guru, Guru."<br>
  O Dear Lord, I go by the name of the Lord's slave. ||Pause||<br>
  The Compassionate Lord is Merciful to the meek, the ocean of peace; He fills all hearts.<br>
  He sees, hears, and is always with me; but I am a fool, and I think that He is far away. ||2||<br>
  The Lord is limitless, but I can only describe Him within my limitations; what do I know, about what He is like?<br>
  I offer my prayer to my True Guru; I am so foolish - please, teach me! ||3||<br>
  I am just a fool, but millions of sinners just like me have been saved.<br>
  Those who have heard, and seen Guru Nanak, do not descend into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||2||13||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Those things, which caused me such anxiety, have all vanished.<br>

  Behold, a wondrous miracle has happened!<br>
  That Lord and Master, whose wisdom is said to be unfathomable, has been enshrined within my heart, by the Guru. ||Pause||<br>
  The demons which tormented me so much, have themselves become terrified.<br>
  They pray: please, save us from your Lord Master; we seek your protection. ||2||<br>
  When the treasure of the Lord of the Universe is opened, those who are pre-destined, receive it.<br>
  The Guru has given me the one jewel, and my mind and body have become peaceful and tranquil. ||3||<br>
  The Guru has blessed me with the one drop of Ambrosial Nectar, and so I have become stable, unmoving and immortal - I shall not die.<br>
  The Lord blessed Guru Nanak with the treasure of devotional worship, and did not call him to account again. ||4||3||14||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Those whose minds are attached to the lotus feet of the Lord - those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled.<br>
  But those, within whose hearts the priceless virtue does not abide - those men remain thirsty and unsatisfied. ||1||<br>

  But one who forgets my Dear Lord - know him to be afflicted with tens of thousands of illnesses. ||Pause||<br>

  Those who hold tightly to Your Support, God, are happy in Your Sanctuary.<br>
  But those humble beings who forget the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, are counted among the most miserable beings. ||2||<br>
  One who has faith in the Guru, and who is lovingly attached to God, enjoys the delights of supreme ecstasy.<br>
  One who forgets God and forsakes the Guru, falls into the most horrible hell. ||3||<br>
  As the Lord engages someone, so he is engaged, and so does he perform.<br>
  Nanak has taken to the Shelter of the Saints; his heart is absorbed in the Lord's feet. ||4||4||15||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  As the king is entangled in kingly affairs, and the egotist in his own egotism,<br>
  and the greedy man is enticed by greed, so is the spiritually enlightened being absorbed in the Love of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  This is what befits the Lord's servant.<br>
  Beholding the Lord near at hand, he serves the True Guru, and he is satisfied through the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||Pause||<br>
  The addict is addicted to his drug, and the landlord is in love with his land.<br>
  As the baby is attached to his milk, so the Saint is in love with God. ||2||<br>
  The scholar is absorbed in scholarship, and the eyes are happy to see.<br>
  As the tongue savors the tastes, so does the humble servant of the Lord sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  As is the hunger, so is the fulfiller; He is the Lord and Master of all hearts.<br>
  Nanak thirsts for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; he has met God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||5||16||<br>

  O Lord, this is what we are, and this is what You are.<br>
  We are sinners, and You are the Destroyer of sins. Your abode is so beautiful, O Lord and Master. ||Pause||<br>
  You fashion all, and having fashioned them, You bless them. You bestow upon them soul, body and the breath of life.<br>
  We are worthless - we have no virtue at all; please, bless us with Your gift, O Merciful Lordand Master. ||2||<br>
  You do good for us, but we do not see it as good; You are kind and compassionate, forever and ever.<br>
  You are the Giver of peace, the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny; please, save us, Your children! ||3||<br>
  You are the treasure, eternal Lord King; all beings and creatures beg of You.<br>
  Says Nanak, such is our condition; please, Lord, keep us on the Path of the Saints. ||4||6||17||<br>
  Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<br>
  In our mother's womb, You blessed us with Your meditative remembrance, and You preserved us there.<br>

  O Lord, You are the Master above my head.<br>
  Here and hereafter, You alone are my Support. ||Pause||<br>
  He looks upon the creation like a mountain of gold, and sees the Creator as a blade of grass.<br>
  You are the Great Giver, and we are all mere beggars; O God, You give gifts according to Your Will. ||2||<br>
  In an instant, You are one thing, and in another instant, You are another. Wondrous are Your ways!<br>
  You are beautiful, mysterious, profound, unfathomable, lofty, inaccessible and infinite. ||3||<br>

  My dealings are with the Saints, and my business is with the Saints.<br>
  I have earned the profit with the Saints, and the treasure filled to over-flowing with devotion to the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The Saints entrusted to me the capital, and my mind's delusion was dispelled.<br>
  What can the Righteous Judge of Dharma do now? All my accounts have been torn up. ||3||<br>
  I have found the greatest bliss, and I am at peace, by the Grace of the Saints.<br>

  O my Beloved, You are the Giver of peace.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has given me these Teachings, and I am attuned to You. ||Pause||<br>
  In sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and self-conceit, peace is not to be found.<br>
  So be the dust of the feet of all, O my mind, and then you shall find bliss, joy and peace. ||2||<br>
  He knows the condition of your inner self, and He will not let your work go in vain - serve Him, O mind.<br>
  Worship Him, and dedicate this mind unto Him, the Image of the Undying Lord, the Divine Guru. ||3||<br>
  He is the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate Lord, the Supreme Lord God, the Formless Lord.<br>

  Illusions and dream-objects possess nothing of greatness.<br>
  Without meditating on the Lord, nothing succeeds, and nothing will go along with you. ||2||<br>
  Acting in egotism and pride, his life passes away, and he does nothing for his soul.<br>
  Wandering and wandering all around, he is never satisfied; he does not remember the Name of the Lord. ||3||<br>

  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  O mind, love the Lord.<br>
  With your ears, hear the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and with your tongue, sing His song. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and meditate in remembrance on the Lord; even a sinner like yourself will become pure.<br>
  Death is on the prowl, with its mouth wide open, friend. ||1||<br>
  Today or tomorrow, eventually it will seize you; understand this in your consciousness.<br>
  Says Nanak, meditate, and vibrate upon the Lord; this opportunity is slipping away! ||2||1||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  The mind remains in the mind.<br>
  He does not meditate on the Lord, nor does he perform service at sacred shrines, and so death seizes him by the hair. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wife, friends, children, carriages, property, total wealth, the entire world<br>
  - know that all of these things are false. The Lord's meditation alone is true. ||1||<br>
  Wandering, wandering around for so many ages, he has grown weary, and finally, he obtained this human body.<br>
  Says Nanak, this is the opportunity to meet the Lord; why don't you remember Him in meditation? ||2||2||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O mind, what evil-mindedness have you developed?<br>
  You are engrossed in the pleasures of other men's wives, and slander; you have not worshipped the Lord at all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You do not know the way to liberation, but you run all around chasing wealth.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 038</h2></center>
  In the end, nothing shall go along with you; you have entrapped yourself in vain. ||1||<br>
  You have not meditated or vibrated upon the Lord; you have not served the Guru, or His humble servants; spiritual wisdom has not welled up within you.<br>
  The Immaculate Lord is within your heart, and yet you search for Him in the wilderness. ||2||<br>
  You have wandered through many many births; you are exhausted but have still not found a way out of this endless cycle.<br>
  Now that you have obtained this human body, meditate on the Lord's Feet; Nanak advises with this advice. ||3||3||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O mind, contemplate the Sanctuary of God.<br>
  Meditating on Him in remembrance, Ganika the prostitute was saved; enshrine His Praises within your heart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meditating on Him in remembrance, Dhroo became immortal, and obtained the state of fearlessness.<br>
  The Lord and Master removes suffering in this way - why have you forgotten Him? ||1||<br>
  As soon as the elephant took to the protective Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of mercy, he escaped from the crocodile.<br>
  How much can I describe the Glorious Praises of the Naam? Whoever chants the Lord's Name, his bonds are broken. ||2||<br>
  Ajaamal, known throughout the world as a sinner, was redeemed in an instant.<br>
  Says Nanak, remember the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and you too shall be carried across and saved. ||3||4||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  What efforts should the mortal make,<br>
  to attain devotional worship of the Lord, and eradicate the fear of death? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Which actions, what sort of knowledge, and what religion - what Dharma should one practice?<br>
  What Name of the Guru should one remember in meditation, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean? ||1||<br>
  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the One Lord is the treasure of mercy; chanting it, one obtains salvation.<br>
  No other religion is comparable to this; so speak the Vedas. ||2||<br>
  He is beyond pain and pleasure, forever unattached; He is called the Lord of the world.<br>
  He dwells deep within your inner self, O Nanak, like the image in a mirror. ||3||5||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O mother, how can I see the Lord of the world?<br>
  In the utter darkness of emotional attachment and spiritual ignorance, my mind remains entangled. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Deluded by doubt, I have wasted my whole life; I have not obtained a stable intellect.<br>
  I remain under the influence of corrupting sins, night and day, and I have not renounced wickedness. ||1||<br>
  I never joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and I did not sing the Kirtan of God's Praises.<br>
  O servant Nanak, I have no virtues at all; keep me in Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||2||6||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O mother, my mind is out of control.<br>
  Night and day, it runs after sin and corruption. How can I restrain it? ||1||Pause||<br>
  He listens to the teachings of the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, but he does not enshrine them in his heart, even for an instant.<br>
  Engrossed in the wealth and women of others, his life passes away uselessly. ||1||<br>
  He has gone insane with the wine of Maya, and does not understand even a bit of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Deep within his heart, the Immaculate Lord dwells, but he does not know this secret. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 039</h2></center>
  When I came to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, all my evil-mindedness was dispelled.<br>
  Then, O Nanak, I remembered the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and the noose of Death was snapped. ||3||7||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O man, grasp this Truth firmly in your soul.<br>
  The whole world is just like a dream; it will pass away in an instant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Like a wall of sand, built up and plastered with great care, which does not last even a few days,<br>
  just so are the pleasures of Maya. Why are you entangled in them, you ignorant fool? ||1||<br>
  Understand this today - it is not yet too late! Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, this is the subtle wisdom of the Holy Saints, which I proclaim out loud to you. ||2||8||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  In this world, I have not found any true friend.<br>
  The whole world is attached to its own pleasures, and when trouble comes, no one is with you. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wives, friends, children and relatives - all are attached to wealth.<br>
  When they see a poor man, they all forsake his company and run away. ||1||<br>
  So what should I say to this crazy mind, which is affectionately attached to them?<br>
  The Lord is the Master of the meek, the Destroyer of all fears, and I have forgotten to praise Him. ||2||<br>
  Like a dog's tail, which will never straighten out, the mind will not change, no matter how many things are tried.<br>
  Says Nanak, please, Lord, uphold the honor of Your innate nature; I chant Your Name. ||3||9||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O mind, you have not accepted the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  What is the use of shaving your head, and wearing saffron robes? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Abandoning Truth, you cling to falsehood; your life is uselessly wasting away.<br>
  Practicing hypocrisy, you fill your belly, and then sleep like an animal. ||1||<br>
  You do not know the Way of the Lord's meditation; you have sold yourself into Maya's hands.<br>
  The madman remains entangled in vice and corruption; he has forgotten the jewel of the Naam. ||2||<br>
  He remains thoughtless, not thinking of the Lord of the Universe; his life is uselessly passing away.<br>
  Says Nanak, O Lord, please, confirm your innate nature; this mortal is continually making mistakes. ||3||10||<br>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  That man, who in the midst of pain, does not feel pain,<br>
  who is not affected by pleasure, affection or fear, and who looks alike upon gold and dust;||1||Pause||<br>
  Who is not swayed by either slander or praise, nor affected by greed, attachment or pride;<br>
  who remains unaffected by joy and sorrow, honor and dishonor;||1||<br>
  who renounces all hopes and desires and remains desireless in the world;<br>
  who is not touched by sexual desire or anger - within his heart, God dwells. ||2||<br>
  That man, blessed by Guru's Grace, understands this way.<br>
  O Nanak, he merges with the Lord of the Universe, like water with water. ||3||11||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 040</h2></center>
  Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O dear friend, know this in your mind.<br>
  The world is entangled in its own pleasures; no one is for anyone else. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In good times, many come and sit together, surrounding you on all four sides.<br>
  But when hard times come, they all leave, and no one comes near you. ||1||<br>
  Your wife, whom you love so much, and who has remained ever attached to you,<br>
  runs away crying, "Ghost! Ghost!", as soon as the swan-soul leaves this body. ||2||<br>
  This is the way they act - those whom we love so much.<br>
  At the very last moment, O Nanak, no one is any use at all, except the Dear Lord. ||3||12||139||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees, Chau-Tukas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I am not torn by duality, because I do not worship any other than the Lord; I do not visit tombs or crematoriums.<br>
  I do not enter the houses of strangers, engrossed in desire. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, has satisfied my desires.<br>
  Deep within my heart, the Guru has shown me the home of my being, and my mind is imbued with peace and poise, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  You Yourself are all-knowing, and You Yourself are all-seeing; You alone bestow intelligence, O Lord. ||1||<br>
  My mind is detached, imbued with detachment; the Word of the Shabad has pierced my mind, O my mother.<br>
  God's Light shines continually within the nucleus of my deepest self; I am lovingly attached to the Bani, the Word of the True Lord Master. ||Pause||<br>
  Countless detached renunciates talk of detachment and renunciation, but he alone is a true renunciate, who is pleasing to the Lord Master.<br>
  The Word of the Shabad is ever in his heart; he is absorbed in the Fear of God, and he works to serve the Guru.<br>
  He remembers the One Lord, his mind does not waver, and he restrains its wanderings.<br>
  He is intoxicated with celestial bliss, and is ever imbued with the Lord's Love; he sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  The mind is like the wind, but if it comes to rest in peace, even for an instant, then he shall abide in the peace of the Name, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  His tongue, eyes and ears are imbued with Truth; O Lord, You quench the fires of desire.<br>
  In hope, the renunciate remains free of hopes; in the home of his own inner self, he is absorbed in the trance of deep meditation.<br>
  He remains content, satisfied with the charity of the Naam; he drinks in the Ambrosial Amrit with ease. ||3||<br>
  There is no renunciation in duality, as long as there is even a particle of duality.<br>
  The whole world is Yours, Lord; You alone are the Giver. There is not any other, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh dwells in misery forever, while the Lord bestows greatness upon the Gurmukh.<br>
  God is infinite, endless, inaccessible and unfathomable; His worth cannot be described. ||4||<br>
  The consciousness in deep Samaadhi, the Supreme Being, the Lord of the three worlds - these are Your Names, Lord.<br>
  The creatures born into this world have their destiny inscribed upon their foreheads; they experience according to their destinies.<br>
  The Lord Himself causes them to do good and bad deeds; He Himself makes them steadfast in devotional worship.<br>
  The filth of their mind and mouth is washed off when they live in the Fear of God; the inaccessible Lord Himself blesses them with spiritual wisdom. ||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 041</h2></center>
  Only those who taste it know its sweet taste, like the mute, who eats the candy, and only smiles.<br>
  How can I describe the indescribable, O Siblings of Destiny? I shall follow His Will forever.<br>
  If one meets with the Guru, the Generous Giver, then he understands; those who have no Guru cannot understand this.<br>
  As the Lord causes us to act, so do we act, O Siblings of Destiny. What other clever tricks can anyone try? ||6||<br>
  Some are deluded by doubt, while others are imbued with devotional worship; Your play is infinite and endless.<br>
  As You engage them, they receive the fruits of their rewards; You alone are the One who issues Your Commands.<br>
  I would serve You, if anything were my own; my soul and body are Yours.<br>
  One who meets with the True Guru, by His Grace, takes the Support of the Ambrosial Naam. ||7||<br>
  He dwells in the heavenly realms, and his virtues radiantly shine forth; meditation and spiritual wisdom are found in virtue.<br>
  The Naam is pleasing to his mind; he speaks it, and causes others to speak it as well. He speaks the essential essence of wisdom.<br>
  The Word of the Shabad is his Guru and spiritual teacher, profound and unfathomable; without the Shabad, the world is insane.<br>
  He is a perfect renunciate, naturally at ease, O Nanak, whose mind is pleased with the True Lord. ||8||1||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, Ti-Tukas:<br>
  Hope and desire are entrapments, O Siblings of Destiny. Religious rituals and ceremonies are traps.<br>
  Because of good and bad deeds, one is born into the world, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he is ruined.<br>
  This Maya is the enticer of the world, O Siblings of Destiny; all such actions are corrupt. ||1||<br>
  Listen, O ritualistic Pandit:<br>
  that religious ritual which produces happiness, O Siblings of Destiny, is contemplation of the essence of the soul. ||Pause||<br>
  You may stand and recite the Shaastras and the Vedas, O Siblings of Destiny, but these are just worldly actions.<br>
  Filth cannot be washed away by hypocrisy, O Siblings of Destiny; the filth of corruption and sin is within you.<br>
  This is how the spider is destroyed, O Siblings of Destiny, by falling head-long in its own web. ||2||<br>
  So many are destroyed by their own evil-mindedness, O Siblings of Destiny; in the love of duality, they are ruined.<br>
  Without the True Guru, the Name is not obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, doubt does not depart.<br>
  If one serves the True Guru, then he obtains peace, O Siblings of Destiny; his comings and goings are ended. ||3||<br>
  True celestial peace comes from the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny; the immaculate mind is absorbed into the True Lord.<br>
  One who serves the Guru, understands, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Guru, the way is not found.<br>
  What can anyone do, with greed within? O Siblings of Destiny, by telling lies, they eat poison. ||4||<br>
  O Pandit, by churning cream, butter is produced.<br>
  By churning water, you shall only see water, O Siblings of Destiny; this world is like that.<br>
  Without the Guru, he is ruined by doubt, O Siblings of Destiny; the unseen Divine Lord is in each and every heart. ||5||<br>
  This world is like a thread of cotton, O Siblings of Destiny, which Maya has tied on all ten sides.<br>
  Without the Guru, the knots cannot be untied, O Siblings of Destiny; I am so tired of religious rituals.<br>
  This world is deluded by doubt, O Siblings of Destiny; no one can say anything about it. ||6||<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, the Fear of God comes to abide in the mind; to die in the Fear of God is one's true destiny.<br>
  In the Court of the Lord, the Naam is far superior to ritualistic cleansing baths, charity and good deeds, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 042</h2></center>
  One who implants the Naam within himself, through the Guru's halter - O Siblings of Destiny, the Lord dwells in his mind, and he is free of hypocrisy. ||7||<br>
  This body is the jeweller's shop, O Siblings of Destiny; the incomparable Naam is the merchandise.<br>

  Sorat'h, First Mehl:<br>
  Those who serve the True Guru, O Beloved, their companions are saved as well.<br>
  No one blocks their way, O Beloved, and the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar is on their tongue.<br>
  Without the Fear of God, they are so heavy that they sink and drown, O Beloved; but the Lord, casting His Glance of Grace, carries them across. ||1||<br>
  I ever praise You, O Beloved, I ever sing Your Praises.<br>
  Without the boat, one is drowned in the sea of fear, O Beloved; how can I reach the distant shore? ||1||Pause||<br>
  I praise the Praiseworthy Lord, O Beloved; there is no other one to praise.<br>
  Those who praise my God are good, O Beloved; they are imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and His Love.<br>
  If I join them, O Beloved, I can churn the essence and so find joy. ||2||<br>
  The gateway to honor is Truth, O Beloved; it bears the Insignia of the True Name of the Lord.<br>
  We come into the world, and we depart, with our destiny written and pre-ordained, O Beloved; realize the Command of the Commander.<br>
  Without the Guru, this Command is not understood, O Beloved; True is the Power of the True Lord. ||3||<br>
  By His Command, we are conceived, O Beloved, and by His Command, we grow in the womb.<br>
  By His Command, we are born, O Beloved, head-first, and upside-down.<br>
  The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the Lord, O Beloved; he departs after resolving his affairs. ||4||<br>
  By His Command, one comes into the world, O Beloved, and by His Will, he goes.<br>
  By His Will, some are bound and gagged and driven away, O Beloved; the self-willed manmukhs suffer their punishment.<br>
  By His Command, the Word of the Shabad, is realized, O Beloved, and one goes to the Court of the Lord robed in honor. ||5||<br>
  By His Command, some accounts are accounted for, O Beloved; by His Command, some suffer in egotism and duality.<br>
  By His Command, one wanders in reincarnation, O Beloved; deceived by sins and demerits, he cries out in his suffering.<br>
  If he comes to realize the Command of the Lord's Will, O Beloved, then he is blessed with Truth and Honor. ||6||<br>
  It is so difficult to speak it, O Beloved; how can we speak, and hear, the True Name?<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those who praise the Lord, O Beloved.<br>
  I have obtained the Name, and I am satisfied, O Beloved; by His Grace, I am united in His Union. ||7||<br>
  If my body were to become the paper, O Beloved, and my mind the inkpot;<br>
  and if my tongue became the pen, O Beloved, I would write, and contemplate, the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<br>
  Blessed is that scribe, O Nanak, who writes the True Name, and enshrines it within his heart. ||8||3||<br>
  Sorat'h, First Mehl, Du-Tukas:<br>
  You are the Giver of virtue, O Immaculate Lord, but my mind is not immaculate, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  I am a worthless sinner, O Siblings of Destiny; virtue is obtained from You alone, Lord. ||1||<br>
  O my Beloved Creator Lord, You create, and You behold.<br>
  I am a hypocritical sinner, O Siblings of Destiny. Bless my mind and body with Your Name, O Lord. ||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 043</h2></center>
  The poisonous Maya has enticed the consciousness, O Siblings of Destiny; through clever tricks, one loses his honor.<br>

  Beautiful, beautiful, the Lord is called, O Siblings of Destiny; beautiful, like the deep crimson color of the poppy.<br>
  If man loves the Lord with detachment, O Siblings of Destiny, he is judged to be true and infallible in the Lord's court and home. ||3||<br>
  You are pervading the realms of the underworld and the heavenly skies; Your wisdom and glories are in each and every heart.<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, one finds peace, O Siblings of Destiny, and pride is dispelled from the mind. ||4||<br>
  Scrubbing with water, the body can be cleaned, O Siblings of Destiny, but the body becomes dirty again.<br>
  Bathing in the supreme essence of spiritual wisdom, O Siblings of Destiny, the mind and body become pure. ||5||<br>
  Why worship gods and goddesses, O Siblings of Destiny? What can we ask of them? What can they give us?<br>
  The stone gods are washed with water, O Siblings of Destiny, but they just sink in the water. ||6||<br>
  Without the Guru, the unseen Lord cannot be seen, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is drowning, having lost its honor.<br>
  Greatness is in the hands of my Lord and Master, O Siblings of Destiny; as He is pleased, He gives. ||7||<br>
  That soul-bride, who talks sweetly and speaks the Truth, O Siblings of Destiny, becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord.<br>
  Pierced by His Love, she abides in Truth, O Siblings of Destiny, deeply imbued with the Lord's Name. ||8||<br>
  Everyone calls God his own, O Siblings of Destiny, but the all-knowing Lord is known only through the Guru.<br>
  Those who are pierced by His Love are saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they bear the Insignia of the True Word of the Shabad. ||9||<br>
  A large pile of firewood, O Siblings of Destiny, will burn if a small fire is applied.<br>
  In the same way, if the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells in the heart for a moment, even for an instant, O Siblings of Destiny, then one meets the Lord with ease, O Nanak. ||10||4||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  You always preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Dear Lord; You have protected them from the very beginning of time.<br>
  You protected Your servant Prahlaad, O Dear Lord, and annihilated Harnaakhash.<br>
  The Gurmukhs place their faith in the Dear Lord, but the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt. ||1||<br>
  O Dear Lord, this is Your Glory.<br>
  You preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Lord Master; Your devotees seek Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||<br>
  The Messenger of Death cannot touch Your devotees; death cannot even approach them.<br>
  The Name of the Lord alone abides in their minds; through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they find liberation.<br>
  Wealth and all the spiritual powers of the Siddhis fall at the feet of the Lord's devotees; they obtain peace and poise from the Guru. ||2||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs have no faith; they are filled with greed and self-interest.<br>
  They are not Gurmukh - they do not understand the Word of the Shabad in their hearts; they do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Their masks of falsehood and hypocrisy shall fall off; the self-willed manmukhs speak with insipid words. ||3||<br>
  You are pervading through Your devotees, O Dear God; through Your devotees, You are known.<br>
  All the people are enticed by Maya; they are Yours, Lord - You alone are the Architect of Destiny.<br>

  By Guru's Grace, he ever dwells in their minds, and He resolves all their affairs.<br>
  Whoever challenges them is destroyed; they have the Lord God as their Savior. ||5||<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, no one finds the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs die crying out in pain.<br>
  They come and go, and find no place of rest; in pain and suffering, they perish.<br>
  But one who becomes Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, and is easily absorbed in the True Name. ||6||<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, one cannot escape reincarnation, even by performing numerous rituals.<br>
  Those who read the Vedas, and argue and debate without the Lord, lose their honor.<br>
  True is the True Guru, and True is the Word of His Bani; in the Guru's Sanctuary, one is saved. ||7||<br>
  Those whose minds are filled with the Lord are judged as true in the Court of the Lord; they are hailed as true in the True Court.<br>

  Without the Guru, celestial peace is not produced, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the spiritual teachers about this.<br>
  Serve the True Guru forever, O Siblings of Destiny, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||5||<br>
  Under Guru's Instruction, the Fear of God is produced, O Siblings of Destiny; true and excellent are the deeds done in the Fear of God.<br>
  Then, one is blessed with the treasure of the Lord's Love, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Support of the True Name. ||6||<br>

  She who does not know the Will of her Husband Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, is an ill-mannered and bitter bride.<br>
  She does things with a stubborn mind, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, she is false. ||3||<br>

  Don't think that he is alive in the world - he is dead, through the love of duality.<br>
  Those who do not meditate on the Lord, as Gurmukh, are not permitted to sit near the Lord.<br>

  The home within is filled with Ambrosial Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not get to taste it.<br>
  He is like the deer, who does not recognize its own musk-scent; it wanders around, deluded by doubt.<br>
  The manmukh forsakes the Ambrosial Nectar, and instead gathers poison; the Creator Himself has fooled him.<br>
  How rare are the Gurmukhs, who obtain this understanding; they behold the Lord God within themselves.<br>
  Their minds and bodies are cooled and soothed, and their tongues enjoy the sublime taste of the Lord.<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, the Name wells up; through the Shabad, we are united in the Lord's Union.<br>

  Third Mehl:<br>
  My Friend is so full of joy and love; He colors my mind with the color of His Love,<br>

  Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding, if one performs it with his mind focused on it.<br>
  The fruits of the mind's desires are obtained, and egotism departs from within.<br>

  It is so difficult to obtain the Naam in this world; it comes to dwell in the mind of the Gurmukh.<br>
  O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to one who serves his True Guru. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The mind of the self-willed manmukh is so very stubborn; it is stuck in the love of duality.<br>
  He does not find peace, even in dreams; he passes his life in misery and suffering.<br>

  This mind cannot be controlled; they are tired of performing religious rituals.<br>

  They do not know the state of their own minds; they are deluded by doubt and egotism.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the Fear of God is obtained; by great good fortune, the Lord comes to abide in the mind.<br>
  When the Fear of God comes, the mind is restrained, and through the Word of the Shabad, the ego is burnt away.<br>
  Those who are imbued with Truth are immaculate; their light merges in the Light.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, one obtains the Name; O Nanak, he is absorbed in peace. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The pleasures of kings and emperors are pleasing, but they last for only a few days.<br>
  These pleasures of Maya are like the color of the safflower, which wears off in a moment.<br>
  They do not go with him when he departs; instead, he carries the load of sins upon his head.<br>
  When death seizes him, and marches him away, then he looks absolutely hideous.<br>
  That lost opportunity will not come into his hands again, and in the end, he regrets and repents. ||6||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru, suffer in sorrow and bondage.<br>

  O Nanak, if the Gracious Lord forgives, then one is united in Union with the Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru, shall find no place of rest or shelter.<br>
  They wander around from door to door, like a woman forsaken, with a bad character and a bad reputation.<br>

  Pauree:<br>
  Those who serve the True Lord, the Destroyer of ego, cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  Those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are passed over by the Messenger of Death.<br>

  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Upon the plate, three things have been placed; this is the sublime, ambrosial food of the Lord.<br>
  Eating this, the mind is satisfied, and the Door of Salvation is found.<br>
  It is so difficult to obtain this food, O Saints; it is obtained only by contemplating the Guru.<br>
  Why should we cast this riddle out of our minds? We should keep it ever enshrined in our hearts.<br>
  The True Guru has posed this riddle. The Guru's Sikhs have found its solution.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone understands this, whom the Lord inspires to understand. The Gurmukhs work hard, and find the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Those whom the Primal Lord unites, remain in Union with Him; they focus their consciousness on the True Guru.<br>

  There is One Bani; there is One Guru; there is one Shabad to contemplate.<br>
  True is the merchandise, and true is the shop; the warehouses are overflowing with jewels.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they are obtained, if the Great Giver gives them.<br>
  Dealing in this true merchandise, one earns the profit of the incomparable Naam.<br>
  In the midst of poison, the Ambrosial Nectar is revealed; by His Mercy, one drinks it in.<br>
  O Nanak, praise the True Lord; blessed is the Creator, the Embellisher. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Those who are permeated by falsehood, do not love the Truth.<br>
  If someone speaks the Truth, falsehood is burnt away.<br>

  I take the medicine of meditation on the Lord's Name, which has cured all diseases and multitudes of sufferings.<br>
  Those who do not forget the Lord, while breathing or eating - know them to be the perfect servants of the Lord.<br>
  Those Gurmukhs who worship the Lord in adoration end their subservience to the Messenger of Death, and to the world. ||22||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  O man, you have been tormented by a nightmare, and you have passed your life in sleep.<br>
  You did not wake to hear the Word of the True Guru's Shabad; you have no inspiration within yourself.<br>
  That body burns, which has no virtue, and which does not serve the Guru.<br>
  I have seen that the world is burning, in egotism and the love of duality.<br>
  O Nanak, those who seek the Guru's Sanctuary are saved; within their minds, they meditate on the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the soul-bride is rid of egotism, and she is glorified.<br>
  If she walks steadily in the way of His Will, then she is adorned with decorations.<br>
  Her couch becomes beautiful, and she constantly enjoys her Husband Lord; she obtains the Lord as her Husband.<br>
  The Lord does not die, and she never suffers pain; she is a happy soul-bride forever.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord God unites her with Himself; she enshrines love and affection for the Guru. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Those who conceal and deny their Guru, are the most evil people.<br>
  O Dear Lord, let me not even see them; they are the worst sinners and murderers.<br>
  They wander from house to house, with impure minds, like wicked, forsaken women.<br>
  But by great good fortune, they may meet the Company of the Holy; as Gurmukhs, they are reformed.<br>
  O Lord, please be kind and let me meet the True Guru; I am a sacrifice to the Guru. ||23||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Serving the Guru, peace is produced, and then, one does not suffer in pain.<br>
  The cycle of birth and death is brought to an end, and death has no power over at all.<br>
  His mind is imbued with the Lord, and he remains merged in the True Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who walk in the Way of the True Guru's Will. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Without the Word of the Shabad, purity is not obtained, even though the soul-bride may adorn herself with all sorts of decorations.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 058</h2></center>
  She does not know the value of her Husband Lord; she is attached to the love of duality.<br>
  She is impure, and ill-mannered, O Nanak; among women, she is the most evil woman. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Be kind to me, Lord, that I might chant the Word of Your Bani.<br>
  May I meditate on the Lord's Name, chant the Lord's Name, and obtain the profit of the Lord's Name.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and night.<br>
  May I behold with my eyes those who worship and adore my Beloved True Guru.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has united me with my Lord, my friend, my very best friend. ||24||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord loves His slaves; the Lord is the friend of His slaves.<br>
  The Lord is under the control of His slaves, like the musical instrument under the control of the musician.<br>
  The Lord's slaves meditate on the Lord; they love their Beloved.<br>
  Please, hear me, O God - let Your Grace rain over the whole world.<br>
  The praise of the Lord's slaves is the Glory of the Lord.<br>
  The Lord loves His Own Glory, and so His humble servant is celebrated and hailed.<br>
  That humble servant of the Lord meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Lord, and the Lord's humble servant, are one and the same.<br>
  Servant Nanak is the slave of the Lord; O Lord, O God, please, preserve his honor. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Nanak loves the True Lord; without Him, he cannot even survive.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, one finds the Perfect Lord, and the tongue enjoys the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Night and day, morning and night, I sing to You, Lord.<br>
  All beings and creatures meditate on Your Name.<br>
  You are the Giver, the Great Giver; we eat whatever You give us.<br>
  In the congregation of the devotees, sins are eradicated.<br>
  Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, O Lord. ||25||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  He has spiritual ignorance within, and his intellect is dull and dim; he does not place his faith in the True Guru.<br>
  He has deceit within himself, and so he sees deception in all others; through his deceptions, he is totally ruined.<br>
  The True Guru's Will does not enter into his consciousness, and so he wanders around, pursuing his own interests.<br>
  If He grants His Grace, then Nanak is absorbed into the Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya; in the love of duality, their minds are unsteady.<br>
  Night and day, they are burning; day and night, they are totally ruined by their egotism.<br>
  Within them, is the total pitch darkness of greed, and no one even approaches them.<br>
  They themselves are miserable, and they never find peace; they are born, only to die, and die again.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Lord God forgives those, who focus their consciousness on the Guru's feet. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  That Saint, that devotee, is acceptable, who is loved by God.<br>
  Those beings are wise, who meditate on the Lord.<br>
  They eat the food, the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  They apply the dust of the feet of the Saints to their foreheads.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 059</h2></center>
  O Nanak, they are purified, bathing in the sacred shrine of the Lord. ||26||<br>
  Shalok, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Within the Gurmukh is peace and tranquility; his mind and body are absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  He contemplates the Naam, he studies the Naam, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the Naam.<br>
  He obtains the treasure of the Naam, and his anxiety is dispelled.<br>
  Meeting with the Guru, the Naam wells up, and his thirst and hunger are completely relieved.<br>
  O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, he gathers in the Naam. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  One who is cursed by the True Guru, abandons his home, and wanders around aimlessly.<br>
  He is jeered at, and his face is blackened in the world hereafter.<br>
  He babbles incoherently, and foaming at the mouth, he dies.<br>
  What can anyone do? Such is his destiny, according to his past deeds.<br>
  Wherever he goes, he is a liar, and by telling lies, he not liked by anyone.<br>
  O Siblings of Destiny, behold this, the glorious greatness of our Lord and Master, O Saints; as one behaves, so does he receive.<br>
  This shall be God's determination in His True Court; servant Nanak predicts and proclaims this. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The True Guru has established the village; the Guru has appointed its guards and protectors.<br>
  My hopes are fulfilled, and my mind is imbued with the love of the Guru's Feet.<br>
  The Guru is infinitely merciful; He has erased all my sins.<br>
  The Guru has showered me with His Mercy, and He has made me His own.<br>
  Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has countless virtues. ||27||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  By His Command, we receive our pre-ordained rewards; so what can we do now, O Pandit?<br>
  When His Command is received, then it is decided; all beings move and act accordingly. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  The string through the nose is in the hands of the Lord Master; one's own actions drive him on.<br>
  Wherever his food is, there he eats it; O Nanak, this is the Truth. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The Lord Himself puts everything in its proper place.<br>
  He Himself created the creation, and He Himself destroys it.<br>
  He Himself fashions His creatures, and He Himself nourishes them.<br>
  He hugs His slaves close in His embrace, and blesses them with His Glance of Grace.<br>
  O Nanak, His devotees are forever in bliss; they have burnt away the love of duality. ||28||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  O mind, meditate on the Dear Lord, with single-minded conscious concentration.<br>
  The glorious greatness of the Lord shall last forever and ever; He never regrets what He gives.<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to the Lord; serving Him, peace is obtained.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains merged with the Lord; he burns away his ego through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  He Himself enjoins us to serve Him, and He Himself blesses us with forgiveness.<br>
  He Himself is the father and mother of all; He Himself cares for us.<br>
  O Nanak, those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abide in the home of their inner being; they are honored throughout the ages. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You are the Creator, all-powerful, able to do anything. Without You, there is no other at all.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 060</h2></center>
  You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself shall destroy it in the end.<br>
  The Word of Your Shabad alone is pervading everywhere; whatever You do, comes to pass.<br>
  God blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness, and then, he finds the Lord.<br>
  As Gurmukh, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; let everyone proclaim, "Blessed, blessed, blessed is He, the Guru!"||29||1||SUDH||<br>
  Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Kabeer Jee, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Worshipping their idols, the Hindus die; the Muslims die bowing their heads.<br>
  The Hindus cremate their dead, while the Muslims bury theirs; neither finds Your true state, Lord. ||1||<br>
  O mind, the world is a deep, dark pit.<br>
  On all four sides, Death has spread his net. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Reciting their poems, the poets die; the mystical ascetics die while journeying to Kaydaar Naat'h.<br>
  The Yogis die, with their matted hair, but even they do not find Your state, Lord. ||2||<br>
  The kings die, gathering and hoarding their money, burying great quantities of gold.<br>
  The Pandits die, reading and reciting the Vedas; women die, gazing at their own beauty. ||3||<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, all come to ruin; behold, and know this, O body.<br>
  Without the Name of the Lord, who can find salvation? Kabeer speaks the Teachings. ||4||1||<br>
  When the body is burnt, it turns to ashes; if it is not cremated, then it is eaten by armies of worms.<br>
  The unbaked clay pitcher dissolves, when water is poured into it; this is also the nature of the body. ||1||<br>
  Why, O Siblings of Destiny, do you strut around, all puffed up with pride?<br>
  Have you forgotten those days, when you were hanging, face down, for ten months? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Like the bee which collects honey, the fool eagerly gathers and collects wealth.<br>
  At the time of death, they shout, "Take him away, take him away! Why leave a ghost lying around?"||2||<br>
  His wife accompanies him to the threshold, and his friends and companions beyond.<br>
  All the people and relatives go as far as the cremation grounds, and then, the soul-swan goes on alone. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O mortal being: you have been seized by Death, and you have fallen into the deep, dark pit.<br>
  You have entangled yourself in the false wealth of Maya, like the parrot caught in the trap. ||4||2||<br>
  Listening to all the teachings of the Vedas and the Puraanas, I wanted to perform the religious rituals.<br>
  But seeing all the wise men caught by Death, I arose and left the Pandits; now I am free of this desire. ||1||<br>
  O mind, you have not completed the only task you were given;<br>
  you have not meditated on the Lord, your King. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Going to the forests, they practice Yoga and deep, austere meditation; they live on roots and the fruits they gather.<br>
  The musicians, the Vedic scholars, the chanters of one word and the men of silence, all are listed on the Register of Death. ||2||<br>
  Loving devotional worship does not enter into your heart; pampering and adorning your body, you must still give it up.<br>
  You sit and play music, but you are still a hypocrite; what do you expect to receive from the Lord? ||3||<br>
  Death has fallen on the whole world; the doubting religious scholars are also listed on the Register of Death.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 061</h2></center>
  Says Kabeer, those humble people become pure - they become Khalsa - who know the Lord's loving devotional worship. ||4||3||<br>
  SECOND HOUSE||<br>
  With both of my eyes, I look around;<br>
  I don't see anything except the Lord.<br>
  My eyes gaze lovingly upon Him,<br>
  and now, I cannot speak of anything else. ||1||<br>
  My doubts were removed, and my fear ran away,<br>
  when my consciousness became attached to the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When the magician beats his tambourine,<br>
  everyone comes to see the show.<br>
  When the magician winds up his show,<br>
  then he enjoys its play all alone. ||2||<br>
  By preaching sermons, one's doubt is not dispelled.<br>
  Everyone is tired of preaching and teaching.<br>
  The Lord causes the Gurmukh to understand;<br>
  his heart remains permeated with the Lord. ||3||<br>
  When the Guru grants even a bit of His Grace,<br>
  one's body, mind and entire being are absorbed into the Lord.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I am imbued with the Lord's Love;<br>
  I have met with the Life of the world, the Great Giver. ||4||4||<br>
  Let the sacred scriptures be your milk and cream,<br>
  and the ocean of the mind the churning vat.<br>
  Be the butter-churner of the Lord,<br>
  and your buttermilk shall not be wasted. ||1||<br>
  O soul-bride slave, why don't you take the Lord as your Husband?<br>
  He is the Life of the world, the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The chain is around your neck, and the cuffs are on your feet.<br>
  The Lord has sent you wandering around from house to house.<br>
  And still, you do not meditate on the Lord, O soul-bride, slave.<br>
  Death is watching you, O wretched woman. ||2||<br>
  The Lord God is the Cause of causes.<br>
  What is in the hands of the poor soul-bride, the slave?<br>
  She awakens from her slumber,<br>
  and she becomes attached to whatever the Lord attaches her. ||3||<br>
  O soul-bride, slave, where did you obtain that wisdom,<br>
  by which you erased your inscription of doubt?<br>
  Kabeer has tasted that subtle essence;<br>
  by Guru's Grace, his mind is reconciled with the Lord. ||4||5||<br>
  Without Him, we cannot even live;<br>
  when we meet Him, then our task is completed.<br>
  People say it is good to live forever,<br>
  but without dying, there is no life. ||1||<br>
  So now, what sort wisdom should I contemplate and preach?<br>
  As I watch, worldly things dissipate. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Saffron is ground up, and mixed with sandalwood;<br>
  without eyes, the world is seen.<br>
  The son has given birth to his father;<br>
  without a place, the city has been established. ||2||<br>
  The humble beggar has found the Great Giver,<br>
  but he is unable to eat what he has been given.<br>
  He cannot leave it alone, but it is never exhausted.<br>
  He shall not go to beg from others any longer. ||3||<br>
  Those select few, who know how to die while yet alive, enjoy great peace.<br>
  Kabeer has found that wealth;<br>
  meeting with the Lord, he has erased his self-conceit. ||4||6||<br>
  What use is it to read, and what use is it to study?<br>
  What use is it to listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas?<br>
  What use is reading and listening,<br>
  if celestial peace is not attained? ||1||<br>
  The fool does not chant the Name of the Lord.<br>
  So what does he think of, over and over again? ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the darkness, we need a lamp<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 062</h2></center>
  to find the incomprehensible thing.<br>
  I have found this incomprehensible thing;<br>
  my mind is illuminated and enlightened. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, now I know Him;<br>
  since I know Him, my mind is pleased and appeased.<br>
  My mind is pleased and appeased, and yet, people do not believe it.<br>
  They do not believe it, so what can I do? ||3||7||<br>
  In his heart there is deception, and yet in his mouth are words of wisdom.<br>
  You are false - why are you churning water? ||1||<br>
  Why do you bother to wash your body?<br>
  Your heart is still full of filth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The gourd may be washed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines,<br>
  but even then, its bitterness is not removed. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer after deep contemplation,<br>
  please help me cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Lord, O Destroyer of ego. ||3||8||<br>
  Sorat'h:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Practicing great hypocrisy, he acquires the wealth of others.<br>
  Returning home, he squanders it on his wife and children. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, do not practice deception, even inadvertently.<br>
  In the end, your own soul shall have to answer for its account. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Moment by moment, the body is wearing away, and old age is asserting itself.<br>
  And then, when you are old, no one shall pour water into your cup. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, no one belongs to you.<br>
  Why not chant the Lord's Name in your heart, when you are still young? ||3||9||<br>
  O Saints, my windy mind has now become peaceful and still.<br>
  It seems that I have learned something of the science of Yoga. ||Pause||<br>
  The Guru has shown me the hole,<br>
  through which the deer carefully enters.<br>
  I have now closed off the doors,<br>
  and the unstruck celestial sound current resounds. ||1||<br>
  The pitcher of my heart-lotus is filled with water;<br>
  I have spilled out the water, and set it upright.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant, this I know.<br>
  Now that I know this, my mind is pleased and appeased. ||2||10||<br>
  Raag Sorat'h:<br>
  I am so hungry, I cannot perform devotional worship service.<br>
  Here, Lord, take back Your mala.<br>
  I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saints.<br>
  I do not owe anyone anything. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, how can I be with You?<br>
  If You do not give me Yourself, then I shall beg until I get You. ||Pause||<br>
  I ask for two kilos of flour,<br>
  and half a pound of ghee, and salt.<br>
  I ask for a pound of beans,<br>
  which I shall eat twice a day. ||2||<br>
  I ask for a cot, with four legs,<br>
  and a pillow and mattress.<br>
  I ask for a quit to cover myself.<br>
  Your humble servant shall perform Your devotional worship service with love. ||3||<br>
  I have no greed;<br>
  Your Name is the only ornament I wish for.<br>
  Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and appeased;<br>
  now that my mind is pleased and appeased, I have come to know the Lord. ||4||11||<br>
  Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee, Second House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  When I see Him, I sing His Praises.<br>
  Then I, his humble servant, become patient. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 063</h2></center>
  Meeting the Divine True Guru, I merge into the sound current of the Naad. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Where the dazzling white light is seen,<br>
  there the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds.<br>
  One's light merges in the Light;<br>
  by Guru's Grace, I know this. ||2||<br>
  The jewels are in the treasure chamber of the heart-lotus.<br>
  They sparkle and glitter like lightning.<br>
  The Lord is near at hand, not far away.<br>
  He is totally permeating and pervading in my soul. ||3||<br>
  Where the light of the undying sun shines,<br>
  the light of burning lamps seems insignificant.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I know this.<br>
  Servant Naam Dayv is absorbed in the Celestial Lord. ||4||1||<br>
  FOURTH HOUSE, SORAT'H:<br>
  The woman next door asked Naam Dayv, "Who built your house?<br>
  I shall pay him double wages. Tell me, who is your carpenter?"||1||<br>
  O sister, I cannot give this carpenter to you.<br>
  Behold, my carpenter is pervading everywhere.<br>
  My carpenter is the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  This carpenter demands the wages of love, if someone wants Him to build their house.<br>
  When one breaks his ties with all the people and relatives, then the carpenter comes of His own accord. ||2||<br>
  I cannot describe such a carpenter, who is contained in everything, everywhere.<br>
  The mute tastes the most sublime ambrosial nectar, but if you ask him to describe it, he cannot. ||3||<br>
  Listen to the virtues of this carpenter, O sister; He stopped the oceans, and established Dhroo as the pole star.<br>
  Naam Dayv's Lord Master brought Sita back, and gave Sri Lanka to Bhabheekhan. ||4||2||<br>
  SORAT'H, THIRD HOUSE:<br>
  The skinless drum plays.<br>
  Without the rainy season, the clouds shake with thunder.<br>
  Without clouds, the rain falls,<br>
  if one contemplates the essence of reality. ||1||<br>
  I have met my Beloved Lord.<br>
  Meeting with Him, my body is made beauteous and sublime. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Touching the philosopher's stone, I have been transformed into gold.<br>
  I have threaded the jewels into my mouth and mind.<br>
  I love Him as my own, and my doubt has been dispelled.<br>
  Seeking the Guru's guidance, my mind is content. ||2||<br>
  The water is contained within the pitcher;<br>
  I know that the One Lord is contained in all.<br>
  The mind of the disciple has faith in the Guru.<br>
  Servant Naam Dayv understands the essence of reality. ||3||3||<br>
  Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Ravi Daas Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  When I am in my ego, then You are not with me. Now that You are with me, there is no egotism within me.<br>
  The wind may raise up huge waves in the vast ocean, but they are just water in water. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, what can I say about such an illusion?<br>
  Things are not as they seem. ||1||Pause||<br>
  It is like the king, who falls asleep upon his throne, and dreams that he is a beggar.<br>
  His kingdom is intact, but separated from it, he suffers in sorrow. Such is my own condition. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 064</h2></center>
  Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me.<br>
  Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. ||3||<br>
  The One Lord is pervading the many forms; He enjoys Himself in all hearts.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, the Lord is nearer than our own hands and feet. Whatever will be, will be. ||4||1||<br>
  If I am bound by the noose of emotional attachment, then I shall bind You, Lord, with the bonds of love.<br>
  Go ahead and try to escape, Lord; I have escaped by worshipping and adoring You. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, You know my love for You.<br>
  Now, what will You do? ||1||Pause||<br>
  A fish is caught, cut up, and cooked it in many different ways.<br>
  Bit by bit, it is eaten, but still, it does not forget the water. ||2||<br>
  The Lord, our King, is father to no one, except those who love Him.<br>
  The veil of emotional attachment has been cast over the entire world, but it does not bother the Lord's devotee. ||3||<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, my devotion to the One Lord is increasing; now, who can I tell this to?<br>
  That which brought me to worship and adore You - I am still suffering that pain. ||4||2||<br>
  I obtained this precious human life as a reward for my past actions, but without discriminating wisdom, it is wasted in vain.<br>
  Tell me, without devotional worship of the Lord, of what use are mansions and thrones like those of King Indra? ||1||<br>
  You have not considered the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, our King;<br>
  this sublime essence shall cause you to forget all other essences. ||1||Pause||<br>
  We do not know what we need to know, and we have become insane. We do not consider what we should consider; our days are passing away.<br>
  Our passions are strong, and our discriminating intellect is weak; we have no access to the supreme objective. ||2||<br>
  We say one thing, and do something else; entangled in endless Maya, we do not understand anything.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, Your slave, O Lord, I am disillusioned and detached; please, spare me Your anger, and have mercy on my soul. ||3||3||<br>
  He is the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life, the wish-fulfilling jewel, and the Kaamadhayna, the cow which fulfills all desires, all are in His power.<br>
  The four great blessings, the eighteen supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, and the nine treasures, are all in the palm of His hand. ||1||<br>
  You do not chant with your tongue the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.<br>
  Abandon your involvement in all other words. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The various Shaastras, Puranaas, and the Vedas of Brahma, are made up of thirty-four letters.<br>
  After deep contemplation, Vyaas spoke of the supreme objective; there is nothing equal to the Lord's Name. ||2||<br>
  Very fortunate are those who are absorbed in celestial bliss, and released from their entanglements; they are lovingly attached to the Lord.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, enshrine the Lord's Light within your heart, and your fear of birth and death shall run away from you. ||3||4||<br>
  If You are the mountain, Lord, then I am the peacock.<br>
  If You are the moon, then I am the partridge in love with it. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, if You will not break with me, then I will not break with You.<br>
  For, if I were to break with You, with whom would I then join? ||1||Pause||<br>
  If You are the lamp, then I am the wick.<br>
  If You are the sacred place of pilgrimage, then I am the pilgrim. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 065</h2></center>
  I am joined in true love with You, Lord.<br>
  I am joined with You, and I have broken with all others. ||3||<br>
  Wherever I go, there I serve You.<br>
  There is no other Lord Master than You, O Divine Lord. ||4||<br>
  Meditating, vibrating upon You, the noose of death is cut away.<br>
  To attain devotional worship, Ravi Daas sings to You, Lord. ||5||5||<br>
  The body is a wall of water, supported by the pillars of air; the egg and sperm are the mortar.<br>
  The framework is made up of bones, flesh and veins; the poor soul-bird dwells within it. ||1||<br>
  O mortal, what is mine, and what is yours?<br>
  The soul is like a bird perched upon a tree. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You lay the foundation and build the walls.<br>
  But in the end, three and a half cubits will be your measured space. ||2||<br>
  You make your hair beautiful, and wear a stylish turban on your head.<br>
  But in the end, this body shall be reduced to a pile of ashes. ||3||<br>
  Your palaces are lofty, and your brides are beautiful.<br>
  But without the Lord's Name, you shall lose the game entirely. ||4||<br>
  My social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my life is wretched.<br>
  I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Luminous Lord, my King; so says Ravi Daas, the shoemaker. ||5||6||<br>
  I am a shoemaker, but I do not know how to mend shoes.<br>
  People come to me to mend their shoes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have no awl to stitch them;<br>
  I have no knife to patch them. ||1||<br>
  Mending, mending, people waste their lives and ruin themselves.<br>
  Without wasting my time mending, I have found the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Ravi Daas chants the Lord's Name;<br>
  he is not concerned with the Messenger of Death. ||3||7||<br>
  Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Bheekhan Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Tears well up in my eyes, my body has become weak, and my hair has become milky-white.<br>
  My throat is tight, and I cannot utter even one word; what can I do now? I am a mere mortal. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, my King, Gardener of the world-garden, be my Physician,<br>
  and save me, Your Saint. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My head aches, my body is burning, and my heart is filled with anguish.<br>
  Such is the disease that has struck me; there is no medicine to cure it. ||2||<br>
  The Name of the Lord, the ambrosial, immaculate water, is the best medicine in the world.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, says servant Bheekhan, I have found the Door of Salvation. ||3||1||<br>
  Such is the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the invaluable jewel, the most sublime wealth, which I have found through good deeds.<br>
  By various efforts, I have enshrined it within my heart; this jewel cannot be hidden by hiding it. ||1||<br>
  The Glorious Praises of the Lord cannot be spoken by speaking.<br>
  They are like the sweet candies given to a mute. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The tongue speaks, the ears listen, and the mind contemplates the Lord; they find peace and comfort.<br>
  Says Bheekhan, my eyes are content; wherever I look, there I see the Lord. ||2||2||<br>
