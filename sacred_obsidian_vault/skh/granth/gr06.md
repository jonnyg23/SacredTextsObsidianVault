 <hr><center><h1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Maajh</h1></center>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 001</h2></center>
  Raag Maajh, Chau-Padas, First House, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. The Name Is Truth. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.<br>
  By great good fortune, I meditate on the Lord's Name.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has attained spiritual perfection in the Name of the Lord. How rare are those who follow the Guru's Teachings. ||1||<br>
  I have loaded my pack with the provisions of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  The Companion of my breath of life shall always be with me.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord's Name within me. I have the Imperishable Treasure of the Lord in my lap. ||2||<br>
  The Lord, Har, Har, is my Best Friend; He is my Beloved Lord King.<br>
  If only someone would come and introduce me to Him, the Rejuvenator of my breath of life.<br>
  I cannot survive without seeing my Beloved. My eyes are welling up with tears. ||3||<br>
  My Friend, the True Guru, has been my Best Friend since I was very young.<br>
  I cannot survive without seeing Him, O my mother!<br>
  O Dear Lord, please show Mercy to me, that I may meet the Guru. Servant Nanak gathers the Wealth of the Lord's Name in his lap. ||4||1||<br>
  Maajh, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord is my mind, body and breath of life.<br>
  I do not know any other than the Lord.<br>
  If only I could have the good fortune to meet some friendly Saint; he might show me the Way to my Beloved Lord God. ||1||<br>
  I have searched my mind and body, through and through.<br>
  How can I meet my Darling Beloved, O my mother?<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I ask about the Path to God. In that Congregation, the Lord God abides. ||2||<br>
  My Darling Beloved True Guru is my Protector.<br>
  I am a helpless child-please cherish me.<br>
  The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, is my Mother and Father. Obtaining the Water of the Guru, the lotus of my heart blossoms forth. ||3||<br>
  Without seeing my Guru, sleep does not come.<br>
  My mind and body are afflicted with the pain of separation from the Guru.<br>
  O Lord, Har, Har, show mercy to me, that I may meet my Guru. Meeting the Guru, servant Nanak blossoms forth. ||4||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 002</h2></center>
  Maajh, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Read of the Lord's Glories and reflect upon the Lord's Glories.<br>
  Listen continually to the Sermon of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, you shall cross over the treacherous and terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<br>
  Come, friends, let us meet our Lord.<br>
  Bring me a message from my Beloved.<br>
  He alone is a friend, companion, beloved and brother of mine, who shows me the way to the Lord, the Lord of all. ||2||<br>
  My illness is known only to the Lord and the Perfect Guru.<br>
  I cannot continue living without chanting the Naam.<br>
  So give me the medicine, the Mantra of the Perfect Guru. Through the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am saved. ||3||<br>
  I am just a poor song-bird, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru,<br>
  who has placed the Drop of Water, the Lord's Name, Har, Har, in my mouth.<br>
  The Lord is the Treasure of Water; I am just a fish in that water. Without this Water, servant Nanak would die. ||4||3||<br>
  Maajh, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  O servants of the Lord, O Saints, O my Siblings of Destiny, let us join together!<br>
  Show me the way to my Lord God-I am so hungry for Him!<br>
  Please reward my faith, O Life of the World, O Great Giver. Obtaining the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, my mind is fulfilled. ||1||<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I chant the Bani of the Lord's Word.<br>
  The Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.<br>
  The Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, is so sweet to my mind. Meeting the True Guru, I drink in this Ambrosial Nectar. ||2||<br>
  By great good fortune, the Lord's Congregation is found,<br>
  while the unfortunate ones wander around in doubt, enduring painful beatings.<br>
  Without good fortune, the Sat Sangat is not found; without this Sangat, people are stained with filth and pollution. ||3||<br>
  Come and meet me, O Life of the World, my Beloved.<br>
  Please bless me with Your Mercy, and enshrine Your Name, Har, Har, within my mind.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, the Sweet Name has become pleasing to my mind. Servant Nanak's mind is drenched and delighted with the Naam. ||4||4||<br>
  Maajh, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Through the Guru, I have obtained the Lord's spiritual wisdom. I have obtained the Sublime Essence of the Lord.<br>
  My mind is imbued with the Love of the Lord; I drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord.<br>
  With my mouth, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; my mind is filled to overflowing with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Come, O Saints, and lead me to my Lord's Embrace.<br>
  Recite to me the Sermon of my Beloved.<br>
  I dedicate my mind to those Saints of the Lord, who chant the Word of the Guru's Bani with their mouths. ||2||<br>
  By great good fortune, the Lord has led me to meet His Saint.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has placed the Sublime Essence of the Lord into my mouth.<br>
  The unfortunate ones do not find the True Guru; the self-willed manmukhs continually endure reincarnation through the womb. ||3||<br>
  God, the Merciful, has Himself bestowed His Mercy.<br>
  He has totally removed the poisonous pollution of egotism.<br>
  O Nanak, in the shops of the city of the human body, the Gurmukhs buy the merchandise of the Lord's Name. ||4||5||<br>
  Maajh, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  I meditate on the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, the Name comes to dwell in the mind.<br>
  The Lord God is our Lord and Master, Inaccessible and Unfathomable. Meeting the True Guru, I enjoy the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 003</h2></center>
  Blessed, blessed are the humble servants of the Lord, who know the Lord God.<br>
  I go and ask those humble servants about the Mysteries of the Lord.<br>
  I wash and massage their feet; joining with the humble servants of the Lord, I drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The True Guru, the Giver, has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me.<br>
  By great good fortune, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.<br>
  The True Essence is Ambrosial Nectar; through the Ambrosial Words of the Perfect Guru, this Amrit is obtained. ||3||<br>
  O Lord, lead me to the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and the true beings.<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, I meditate on the Lord's Name.<br>
  O Nanak, I listen and chant the Lord's Sermon; through the Guru's Teachings, I am fulfilled by the Name of the Lord. ||4||6||<br>
  Maajh, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Come, dear sisters-let us join together.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the one who tells me of my Beloved.<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have found the Lord, my Best Friend. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||1||<br>
  Wherever I look, there I see my Lord and Master.<br>
  You are permeating each and every heart, O Lord, Inner-knower, Searcher of Hearts.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has shown me that the Lord is always with me. I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||2||<br>
  There is only one breath; all are made of the same clay; the light within all is the same.<br>
  The One Light pervades all the many and various beings. This Light intermingles with them, but it is not diluted or obscured.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I have come to see the One. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||3||<br>
  Servant Nanak speaks the Ambrosial Bani of the Word.<br>
  It is dear and pleasing to the minds of the GurSikhs.<br>
  The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, shares the Teachings. The Guru, the True Guru, is Generous to all. ||4||7||<br>
  Seven Chau-Padas Of The Fourth Mehl. ||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:<br>
  My mind longs for the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.<br>
  It cries out like the thirsty song-bird.<br>
  My thirst is not quenched, and I can find no peace, without the Blessed Vision of the Beloved Saint. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the Blessed Vision of the Beloved Saint Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Your Face is so Beautiful, and the Sound of Your Words imparts intuitive wisdom.<br>
  It is so long since this rainbird has had even a glimpse of water.<br>
  Blessed is that land where You dwell, O my Friend and Intimate Divine Guru. ||2||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, I am forever a sacrifice, to my Friend and Intimate Divine Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When I could not be with You for just one moment, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga dawned for me.<br>
  When will I meet You, O my Beloved Lord?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 004</h2></center>
  I cannot endure the night, and sleep does not come, without the Sight of the Beloved Guru's Court. ||3||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to that True Court of the Beloved Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  By good fortune, I have met the Saint Guru.<br>
  I have found the Immortal Lord within the home of my own self.<br>
  I will now serve You forever, and I shall never be separated from You, even for an instant. Servant Nanak is Your slave, O Beloved Master. ||4||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice; servant Nanak is Your slave, Lord. ||Pause||1||8||<br>
  Raag Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Sweet is that season when I remember You.<br>
  Sublime is that work which is done for You.<br>
  Blessed is that heart in which You dwell, O Giver of all. ||1||<br>
  You are the Universal Father of all, O my Lord and Master.<br>
  Your nine treasures are an inexhaustible storehouse.<br>
  Those unto whom You give are satisfied and fulfilled; they become Your devotees, Lord. ||2||<br>
  All place their hopes in You.<br>
  You dwell deep within each and every heart.<br>
  All share in Your Grace; none are beyond You. ||3||<br>
  You Yourself liberate the Gurmukhs;<br>
  You Yourself consign the self-willed manmukhs to wander in reincarnation.<br>
  Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to You; Your Entire Play is self-evident, Lord. ||4||2||9||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Unstruck Melody resounds and resonates in peaceful ease.<br>
  I rejoice in the eternal bliss of the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  In the cave of intuitive wisdom I sit, absorbed in the silent trance of the Primal Void. I have obtained my seat in the heavens. ||1||<br>
  After wandering through many other homes and houses, I have returned to my own home,<br>
  and I have found what I was longing for.<br>
  I am satisfied and fulfilled; O Saints, the Guru has shown me the Fearless Lord God. ||2||<br>
  He Himself is the King, and He Himself is the people.<br>
  He Himself is in Nirvaanaa, and He Himself indulges in pleasures.<br>
  He Himself sits on the throne of true justice, answering the cries and prayers of all. ||3||<br>
  As I have seen Him, so have I described Him.<br>
  This Sublime Essence comes only to one who knows the Mystery of the Lord.<br>
  His light merges into the Light, and he finds peace. O servant Nanak, this is all the Extension of the One. ||4||3||10||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  That house, in which the soul-bride has married her Husband Lord<br>
  -in that house, O my companions, sing the songs of rejoicing.<br>
  Joy and celebrations decorate that house, in which the Husband Lord has adorned His soul-bride. ||1||<br>
  She is virtuous, and she is very fortunate;<br>
  she is blessed with sons and tender-hearted. The happy soul-bride is loved by her Husband.<br>
  She is beautiful, wise, and clever. That soul-bride is the beloved of her Husband Lord. ||2||<br>
  She is well-mannered, noble and distinguished.<br>
  She is decorated and adorned with wisdom.<br>
  She is from a most respected family; she is the queen, adorned with the Love of her Husband Lord. ||3||<br>
  Her glory cannot be described;<br>
  she melts in the Embrace of her Husband Lord.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 005</h2></center>
  Her marriage is eternal; her Husband is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. O Servant Nanak, His Love is her only Support. ||4||4||11||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have searched and searched, seeking the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.<br>
  I travelled through all sorts of woods and forests.<br>
  My Lord, Har, Har, is both absolute and related, unmanifest and manifest; is there anyone who can come and unite me with Him? ||1||<br>
  People recite from memory the wisdom of the six schools of philosophy;<br>
  they perform worship services, wear ceremonial religious marks on their foreheads, and take ritual cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  They perform the inner cleansing practice with water and adopt the eighty-four Yogic postures; but still, they find no peace in any of these. ||2||<br>
  They chant and meditate, practicing austere self-discipline for years and years;<br>
  they wander on journeys all over the earth;<br>
  and yet, their hearts are not at peace, even for an instant. The Yogi rises up and goes out, over and over again. ||3||<br>
  By His Mercy, I have met the Holy Saint.<br>
  My mind and body have been cooled and soothed; I have been blessed with patience and composure.<br>
  The Immortal Lord God has come to dwell within my heart. Nanak sings the songs of joy to the Lord. ||4||5||12||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Supreme Lord God is Infinite and Divine;<br>
  He is Inaccessible, Incomprehensible, Invisible and Inscrutable.<br>
  Merciful to the meek, Sustainer of the World, Lord of the Universe-meditating on the Lord, the Gurmukhs find salvation. ||1||<br>
  The Gurmukhs are emancipated by the Lord.<br>
  The Lord Krishna becomes the Gurmukh's Companion.<br>
  The Gurmukh finds the Merciful Lord. He is not found any other way. ||2||<br>
  He does not need to eat; His Hair is Wondrous and Beautiful; He is free of hate.<br>
  Millions of people worship His Feet.<br>
  He alone is a devotee, who becomes Gurmukh, whose heart is filled with the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<br>
  Forever fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He is Infinite and Incomparable.<br>
  He is Awesome and All-powerful; He is forever the Great Giver.<br>
  As Gurmukh, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall be carried across. O Nanak, rare are those who know this state! ||4||6||13||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  As You command, I obey; as You give, I receive.<br>
  You are the Pride of the meek and the poor.<br>
  You are everything; You are my Beloved. I am a sacrifice to Your Creative Power. ||1||<br>
  By Your Will, we wander in the wilderness; by Your Will, we find the path.<br>
  By Your Will, we become Gurmukh and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  By Your Will, we wander in doubt through countless lifetimes. Everything happens by Your Will. ||2||<br>
  No one is foolish, and no one is clever.<br>
  Your Will determines everything;<br>
  You are Inaccessible, Incomprehensible, Infinite and Unfathomable. Your Value cannot be expressed. ||3||<br>
  Please bless me with the dust of the Saints, O my Beloved.<br>
  I have come and fallen at Your Door, O Lord.<br>
  Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, my mind is fulfilled. O Nanak, with natural ease, I merge into Him. ||4||7||14||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  They forget the Lord, and they suffer in pain.<br>
  Afflicted with hunger, they run around in all directions.<br>
  Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, they are happy forever. The Lord, Merciful to the meek, bestows it upon them. ||1||<br>
  My True Guru is absolutely All-powerful.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 006</h2></center>
  When I dwell upon Him in my soul, all my sorrows depart.<br>
  The sickness of anxiety and the disease of ego are cured; He Himself cherishes me. ||2||<br>
  Like a child, I ask for everything.<br>
  God is Bountiful and Beautiful; He never comes up empty.<br>
  Again and again, I fall at His Feet. He is Merciful to the meek, the Sustainer of the World. ||3||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru,<br>
  who has shattered all my bonds.<br>
  With the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in my heart, I have been purified. O Nanak, His Love has imbued me with nectar. ||4||8||15||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  O my Love, Sustainer of the World, Merciful, Loving Lord,<br>
  Profoundly Deep, Infinite Lord of the Universe,<br>
  Highest of the High, Unfathomable, Infinite Lord and Master: continually remembering You in deep meditation, I live. ||1||<br>
  O Destroyer of pain, Priceless Treasure,<br>
  Fearless, free of hate, Unfathomable, Immeasurable,<br>
  of Undying Form, Unborn, Self-illumined: remembering You in meditation, my mind is filled with a deep and profound peace. ||2||<br>
  The Joyous Lord, the Sustainer of the World, is my constant Companion.<br>
  He cherishes the high and the low.<br>
  The Nectar of the Name satisfies my mind. As Gurmukh, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||<br>
  In suffering and in comfort, I meditate on You, O Beloved.<br>
  I have obtained this sublime understanding from the Guru.<br>
  You are Nanak's Support, O my Lord and Master; through Your Love, I swim across to the other side. ||4||9||16||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Blessed is that time when I meet the True Guru.<br>
  Gazing upon the Fruitful Vision of His Darshan, I have been saved.<br>
  Blessed are the hours, the minutes and the seconds-blessed is that Union with Him. ||1||<br>
  Making the effort, my mind has become pure.<br>
  Walking on the Lord's Path, my doubts have all been cast out.<br>
  The True Guru has inspired me to hear the Treasure of the Naam; all my illness has been dispelled. ||2||<br>
  The Word of Your Bani is inside and outside as well.<br>
  You Yourself chant it, and You Yourself speak it.<br>
  The Guru has said that He is One-All is the One. There shall never be any other. ||3||<br>
  I drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Essence from the Guru;<br>
  the Lord's Name has become my clothing and food.<br>
  The Name is my delight, the Name is my play and entertainment. O Nanak, I have made the Name my enjoyment. ||4||10||17||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I beg of all the Saints: please, give me the merchandise.<br>
  I offer my prayers-I have forsaken my pride.<br>
  I am a sacrifice, hundreds of thousands of times a sacrifice, and I pray: please, give me the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||<br>
  You are the Giver, You are the Architect of Destiny.<br>
  You are All-powerful, the Giver of Eternal Peace.<br>
  You bless everyone. Please bring my life to fulfillment. ||2||<br>
  The body-temple is sanctified by the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan,<br>
  and thus, the impregnable fort of the soul is conquered.<br>
  You are the Giver, You are the Architect of Destiny. There is no other warrior as great as You. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 007</h2></center>
  I applied the dust of the feet of the Saints to my face.<br>
  My evil-mindedness disappeared, along with my misfortune and false-mindedness.<br>
  I sit in the true home of my self; I sing His Glorious Praises. O Nanak, my falsehood has vanished! ||4||11||18||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I shall never forget You-You are such a Great Giver!<br>
  Please grant Your Grace, and imbue me with the love of devotional worship.<br>
  If it pleases You, let me meditate on You day and night; please, grant me this gift! ||1||<br>
  Into this blind clay, You have infused awareness.<br>
  Everything, everywhere which You have given is good.<br>
  Bliss, joyful celebrations, wondrous plays and entertainment-whatever pleases You, comes to pass. ||2||<br>
  Everything we receive is a gift from Him<br>
  -the thirty-six delicious foods to eat,<br>
  cozy beds, cooling breezes, peaceful joy and the experience of pleasure. ||3||<br>
  Give me that state of mind, by which I may not forget You.<br>
  Give me that understanding, by which I may meditate on You.<br>
  I sing Your Glorious Praises with each and every breath. Nanak takes the Support of the Guru's Feet. ||4||12||19||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  To praise You is to follow Your Command and Your Will.<br>
  That which pleases You is spiritual wisdom and meditation.<br>
  That which pleases God is chanting and meditation; to be in harmony with His Will is perfect spiritual wisdom. ||1||<br>
  He alone sings Your Ambrosial Naam, who is pleasing to Your Mind, O my Lord and Master.<br>
  You belong to the Saints, and the Saints belong to You. The minds of the Saints are attuned to You, O my Lord and Master. ||2||<br>
  You cherish and nurture the Saints.<br>
  The Saints play with You, O Sustainer of the World.<br>
  Your Saints are very dear to You. You are the breath of life of the Saints. ||3||<br>
  My mind is a sacrifice to those Saints who know You,<br>
  and are pleasing to Your Mind.<br>
  In their company I have found a lasting peace. Nanak is satisfied and fulfilled with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||4||13||20||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl<br>
  : You are the Ocean of Water, and I am Your fish.<br>
  Your Name is the drop of water, and I am a thirsty rainbird.<br>
  You are my hope, and You are my thirst. My mind is absorbed in You. ||1||<br>
  Just as the baby is satisfied by drinking milk,<br>
  and the poor person is pleased by seeing wealth,<br>
  and the thirsty person is refreshed by drinking cool water, so is this mind drenched with delight in the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Just as the darkness is lit up by the lamp,<br>
  and the hopes of the wife are fulfilled by thinking about her husband,<br>
  and people are filled with bliss upon meeting their beloved, so is my mind imbued with the Lord's Love. ||3||<br>
  The Saints have set me upon the Lord's Path.<br>
  By the Grace of the Holy Saint, I have been attuned to the Lord.<br>
  The Lord is mine, and I am the slave of the Lord. O Nanak, the Guru has blessed me with the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||14||21||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is eternally pure.<br>
  The Lord is the Giver of Peace and the Dispeller of sorrow.<br>
  I have seen and tasted all other flavors, but to my mind, the Subtle Essence of the Lord is the sweetest of all. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 008</h2></center>
  Whoever drinks this in, is satisfied.<br>
  Whoever obtains the Sublime Essence of the Naam becomes immortal.<br>
  The Treasure of the Naam is obtained by one whose mind is filled with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<br>
  One who obtains the Sublime Essence of the Lord is satisfied and fulfilled.<br>
  One who obtains this Flavor of the Lord does not waver.<br>
  One who has this destiny written on his forehead obtains the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<br>
  The Lord has come into the hands of the One, the Guru, who has blessed so many with good fortune.<br>
  Attached to Him, a great many have been liberated.<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the Treasure of the Naam; says Nanak, those who see the Lord are very rare. ||4||15||22||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  My Lord, Har, Har, Har, is the nine treasures, the supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, wealth and prosperity.<br>
  He is the Deep and Profound Treasure of Life.<br>
  Hundreds of thousands, even millions of pleasures and delights are enjoyed by one who falls at the Guru's Feet. ||1||<br>
  Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all are sanctified,<br>
  and all family and friends are saved.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I meditate on the Inaccessible and Unfathomable True Lord. ||2||<br>
  The One, the Guru, who is sought by all-only a few, by great good fortune, receive His Darshan.<br>
  His Place is lofty, infinite and unfathomable; the Guru has shown me that palace. ||3||<br>
  Your Ambrosial Name is deep and profound.<br>
  That person is liberated, in whose heart You dwell.<br>
  The Guru cuts away all his bonds; O Servant Nanak, he is absorbed in the poise of intuitive peace. ||4||16||23||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  By God's Grace, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  By God's Kindness, I sing the songs of joy.<br>
  While standing and sitting, while sleeping and while awake, meditate on the Lord, all your life. ||1||<br>
  The Holy Saint has given me the Medicine of the Naam.<br>
  My sins have been cut out, and I have become pure.<br>
  I am filled with bliss, and all my pains have been taken away. All my suffering has been dispelled. ||2||<br>
  One who has my Beloved on his side, is liberated from the world-ocean.<br>
  One who recognizes the Guru practices Truth; why should he be afraid? ||3||<br>
  Since I found the Company of the Holy and met the Guru, the demon of pride has departed.<br>
  With each and every breath, Nanak sings the Lord's Praises. The True Guru has covered my sins. ||4||17||24||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Through and through, the Lord is intermingled with His servant.<br>
  God, the Giver of Peace, cherishes His servant.<br>
  I carry the water, wave the fan, and grind the grain for the servant of my Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  God has cut the noose from around my neck; He has placed me in His Service.<br>
  The Lord and Master's Command is pleasing to the mind of His servant.<br>
  He does that which pleases his Lord and Master. Inwardly and outwardly, the servant knows his Lord. ||2||<br>
  You are the All-knowing Lord and Master; You know all ways and means.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 009</h2></center>
  The servant of the Lord and Master enjoys the Love and Affection of the Lord.<br>
  That which belongs to the Lord and Master, belongs to His servant. The servant becomes distinguished in association with his Lord and Master. ||3||<br>
  He, whom the Lord and Master dresses in the robes of honor, is not called to answer for his account any longer.<br>
  Nanak is a sacrifice to that servant. He is the pearl of the deep and unfathomable Ocean of God. ||4||18||25||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Everything is within the home of the self; there is nothing beyond.<br>
  One who searches outside is deluded by doubt.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one who has found the Lord within is happy, inwardly and outwardly. ||1||<br>
  Slowly, gently, drop by drop, the stream of nectar trickles down within.<br>
  The mind drinks it in, hearing and reflecting on the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  It enjoys bliss and ecstasy day and night, and plays with the Lord forever and ever. ||2||<br>
  I have now been united with the Lord after having been separated and cut off from Him for so many lifetimes;<br>
  by the Grace of the Holy Saint, the dried-up branches have blossomed forth again in their greenery.<br>

  One who does not feel love for the Saints,<br>

 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 025</h2></center>
  Think of the Lord, who shall be your Help and Support in the end.<br>
  The Lord is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. He has no master, and He is not born. He is obtained through love of the True Guru. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who eliminate selfishness and conceit.<br>
  They eradicate selfishness and conceit, and then find the Lord; they are intuitively immersed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  According to their pre-ordained destiny, they act out their karma.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, a lasting peace is found.<br>
  Without good fortune, the Guru is not found. Through the Word of the Shabad, they are united in the Lord's Union. ||2||<br>
  The Gurmukhs remain unaffected in the midst of the world.<br>
  The Guru is their cushion, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is their Support.<br>
  Who can oppress the Gurmukh? One who tries shall perish, writhing in pain. ||3||<br>
  The blind self-willed manmukhs have no understanding at all.<br>
  They are the assassins of the self, and the butchers of the world.<br>
  By continually slandering others, they carry a terrible load, and they carry the loads of others for nothing. ||4||<br>
  This world is a garden, and my Lord God is the Gardener.<br>
  He always takes care of it-nothing is exempt from His Care.<br>
  As is the fragrance which He bestows, so is the fragrant flower known. ||5||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are sick and diseased in the world.<br>
  They have forgotten the Giver of peace, the Unfathomable, the Infinite.<br>
  These miserable people wander endlessly, crying out in pain; without the Guru, they find no peace. ||6||<br>
  The One who created them, knows their condition.<br>
  And if He inspires them, then they realize the Hukam of His Command.<br>
  Whatever He places within them, that is what prevails, and so they outwardly appear. ||7||<br>
  I know of no other except the True One.<br>
  Those, whom the Lord attaches to Himself, become pure.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the heart of those, unto whom He has given it. ||8||14||15||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  Enshrining the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, in the mind,<br>
  all the pains of egotism, selfishness and conceit are eliminated.<br>
  By continually praising the Ambrosial Bani of the Word, I obtain the Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Ambrosial Bani of the Word within their minds.<br>
  Enshrining the Ambrosial Bani in their minds, they meditate on the Ambrosial Naam. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who continually chant the Ambrosial Words of Nectar see and behold this Amrit everywhere with their eyes.<br>
  They continually chant the Ambrosial Sermon day and night; chanting it, they cause others to hear it. ||2||<br>
  Imbued with the Ambrosial Love of the Lord, they lovingly focus their attention on Him.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they receive this Amrit.<br>
  They chant the Ambrosial Name with their tongues day and night; their minds and bodies are satisfied by this Amrit. ||3||<br>
  That which God does is beyond anyone's consciousness;<br>
  no one can erase the Hukam of His Command.<br>
  By His Command, the Ambrosial Bani of the Word prevails, and by His Command, we drink in the Amrit. ||4||<br>
  The actions of the Creator Lord are marvellous and wonderful.<br>
  This mind is deluded, and goes around the wheel of reincarnation.<br>
  Those who focus their consciousness on the Ambrosial Bani of the Word, hear the vibrations of the Ambrosial Word of the Shabad. ||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 026</h2></center>
  You Yourself created the counterfeit and the genuine.<br>
  You Yourself appraise all people.<br>
  You appraise the true, and place them in Your Treasury; You consign the false to wander in delusion. ||6||<br>
  How can I behold You? How can I praise You?<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I praise You through the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  In Your Sweet Will, the Amrit is found; by Your Will, You inspire us to drink in this Amrit. ||7||<br>
  The Shabad is Amrit; the Lord's Bani is Amrit.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, it permeates the heart.<br>
  O Nanak, the Ambrosial Naam is forever the Giver of peace; drinking in this Amrit, all hunger is satisfied. ||8||15||16||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  The Ambrosial Nectar rains down, softly and gently.<br>
  How rare are those Gurmukhs who find it.<br>
  Those who drink it in are satisfied forever. Showering His Mercy upon them, the Lord quenches their thirst. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those Gurmukhs who drink in this Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  The tongue tastes the essence, and remains forever imbued with the Lord's Love, intuitively singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, intuitive understanding is obtained;<br>
  subduing the sense of duality, they are in love with the One.<br>
  When He bestows His Glance of Grace, then they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; by His Grace, they merge in Truth. ||2||<br>
  Above all is Your Glance of Grace, O God.<br>
  Upon some it is bestowed less, and upon others it is bestowed more.<br>
  Without You, nothing happens at all; the Gurmukhs understand this. ||3||<br>
  The Gurmukhs contemplate the essence of reality;<br>
  Your Treasures are overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, no one obtains it. It is obtained only by Guru's Grace. ||4||<br>
  Those who serve the True Guru are beautiful.<br>
  The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, entices their inner minds.<br>
  Their minds and bodies are attuned to the Ambrosial Bani of the Word; this Ambrosial Nectar is intuitively heard. ||5||<br>
  The deluded, self-willed manmukhs are ruined through the love of duality.<br>
  They do not chant the Naam, and they die, eating poison.<br>
  Night and day, they continually sit in manure. Without selfless service, their lives are wasted away. ||6||<br>
  They alone drink in this Amrit, whom the Lord Himself inspires to do so.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they intuitively enshrine love for the Lord.<br>
  The Perfect Lord is Himself perfectly pervading everywhere; through the Guru's Teachings, He is perceived. ||7||<br>
  He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.<br>
  He who has created, shall Himself destroy.<br>
  O Nanak, remember the Naam forever, and you shall merge into the True One with intuitive ease. ||8||16||17||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who please You are linked to the Truth.<br>
  They serve the True One forever, with intuitive ease.<br>
  Through the True Word of the Shabad, they praise the True One, and they merge in the merging of Truth. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who praise the True One.<br>
  Those who meditate on the True One are attuned to Truth; they are absorbed into the Truest of the True. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The True One is everywhere, wherever I look.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I enshrine Him in my mind.<br>
  True are the bodies of those whose tongues are attuned to Truth. They hear the Truth, and speak it with their mouths. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 027</h2></center>
  Subduing their desires, they merge with the True One;<br>
  they see in their minds that everyone comes and goes in reincarnation.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, they become stable forever, and they obtain their dwelling in the home of the self. ||3||<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is seen within one's own heart.<br>
  Through the Shabad, I have burned my emotional attachment to Maya.<br>
  I gaze upon the Truest of the True, and I praise Him. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I obtain the True One. ||4||<br>
  Those who are attuned to Truth are blessed with the Love of the True One.<br>
  Those who praise the Lord's Name are very fortunate.<br>
  Through the Word of His Shabad, the True One blends with Himself, those who join the True Congregation and sing the Glorious Praises of the True One. ||5||<br>
  We could read the account of the Lord, if He were in any account.<br>
  He is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible; through the Shabad, understanding is obtained.<br>
  Night and day, praise the True Word of the Shabad. There is no other way to know His Worth. ||6||<br>
  People read and recite until they grow weary, but they do not find peace.<br>
  Consumed by desire, they have no understanding at all.<br>
  They purchase poison, and they are thirsty with their fascination for poison. Telling lies, they eat poison. ||7||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I know the One.<br>
  Subduing my sense of duality, my mind is absorbed into the True One.<br>
  O Nanak, the One Name is pervading deep within my mind; by Guru's Grace, I receive it. ||8||17||18||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  In all colors and forms, You are pervading.<br>
  People die over and over again; they are re-born, and make their rounds on the wheel of reincarnation.<br>
  You alone are Eternal and Unchanging, Inaccessible and Infinite. Through the Guru's Teachings, understanding is imparted. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Lord's Name in their minds.<br>
  The Lord has no form, features or color. Through the Guru's Teachings, He inspires us to understand Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The One Light is all-pervading; only a few know this.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, this is revealed.<br>
  In the hidden and in the obvious, He is pervading all places. Our light merges into the Light. ||2||<br>
  The world is burning in the fire of desire,<br>
  in greed, arrogance and excessive ego.<br>
  People die over and over again; they are re-born, and lose their honor. They waste away their lives in vain. ||3||<br>
  Those who understand the Word of the Guru's Shabad are very rare.<br>
  Those who subdue their egotism, come to know the three worlds.<br>
  Then, they die, never to die again. They are intuitively absorbed in the True One. ||4||<br>
  They do not focus their consciousness on Maya again.<br>
  They remain absorbed forever in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  They praise the True One, who is contained deep within all hearts. They are blessed and exalted by the Truest of the True. ||5||<br>
  Praise the True One, who is Ever-present.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is pervading everywhere.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, we come to behold the True One; from the True One, peace is obtained. ||6||<br>
  The True One permeates and pervades the mind within.<br>
  The True One is Eternal and Unchanging; He does not come and go in reincarnation.<br>
  Those who are attached to the True One are immaculate and pure. Through the Guru's Teachings, they merge in the True One. ||7||<br>
  Praise the True One, and no other.<br>
  Serving Him, eternal peace is obtained.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 028</h2></center>
  O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, reflect deeply on the Truth; they practice only Truth. ||8||18||19||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  The Word of the Shabad is Immaculate and Pure; the Bani of the Word is Pure.<br>
  The Light which is pervading among all is Immaculate.<br>
  So praise the Immaculate Word of the Lord's Bani; chanting the Immaculate Name of the Lord, all filth is washed away. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Giver of peace within their minds.<br>
  Praise the Immaculate Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Listen to the Shabad, and quench your thirst. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When the Immaculate Naam comes to dwell in the mind,<br>
  the mind and body become Immaculate, and emotional attachment to Maya departs.<br>
  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Immaculate True Lord forever, and the Immaculate Sound-current of the Naad shall vibrate within. ||2||<br>
  The Immaculate Ambrosial Nectar is obtained from the Guru.<br>
  When selfishness and conceit are eradicated from within, then there is no attachment to Maya.<br>
  Immaculate is the spiritual wisdom, and utterly immaculate is the meditation, of those whose minds are filled with the Immaculate Bani of the Word. ||3||<br>
  One who serves the Immaculate Lord becomes immaculate.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the filth of egotism is washed away.<br>
  The Immaculate Bani and the Unstruck Melody of the Sound-current vibrate, and in the True Court, honor is obtained. ||4||<br>
  Through the Immaculate Lord, all become immaculate.<br>
  Immaculate is the mind which weaves the Word of the Lord's Shabad into itself.<br>
  Blessed and very fortunate are those who are committed to the Immaculate Name; through the Immaculate Name, they are blessed and beautified. ||5||<br>
  Immaculate is the one who is adorned with the Shabad.<br>
  The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, entices the mind and body.<br>
  No filth ever attaches itself to the True Name; one's face is made radiant by the True One. ||6||<br>
  The mind is polluted by the love of duality.<br>
  Filthy is that kitchen, and filthy is that dwelling;<br>
  eating filth, the self-willed manmukhs become even more filthy. Because of their filth, they suffer in pain. ||7||<br>
  The filthy, and the immaculate as well, are all subject to the Hukam of God's Command.<br>
  They alone are immaculate, who are pleasing to the True Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam abides deep within the minds of the Gurmukhs, who are cleansed of all their filth. ||8||19||20||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  The Lord of the Universe is radiant, and radiant are His soul-swans.<br>
  Their minds and their speech are immaculate; they are my hope and ideal.<br>
  Their minds are radiant, and their faces are always beautiful; they meditate on the most radiant Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  So chant Gobind, Gobind, the Lord of the Universe, day and night; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord Gobind, through the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sing of the Lord Gobind with intuitive ease,<br>
  in the Fear of the Guru; you shall become radiant, and the filth of egotism shall depart.<br>
  Remain in bliss forever, and perform devotional worship, day and night. Hear and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord Gobind. ||2||<br>
  Channel your dancing mind in devotional worship,<br>
  and through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, merge your mind with the Supreme Mind.<br>
  Let your true and perfect tune be the subjugation of your love of Maya, and let yourself dance to the Shabad. ||3||<br>
  People shout out loud and move their bodies,<br>
  but if they are emotionally attached to Maya, then the Messenger of Death shall hunt them down.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 029</h2></center>
  The love of Maya makes this mind dance, and the deceit within makes people suffer in pain. ||4||<br>
  When the Lord inspires one to become Gurmukh, and perform devotional worship,<br>
  then his body and mind are attuned to His Love with intuitive ease.<br>
  The Word of His Bani vibrates, and the Word of His Shabad resounds, for the Gurmukh whose devotional worship is accepted. ||5||<br>
  One may beat upon and play all sorts of instruments,<br>
  but no one will listen, and no one will enshrine it in the mind.<br>
  For the sake of Maya, they set the stage and dance, but they are in love with duality, and they obtain only sorrow. ||6||<br>
  Those whose inner beings are attached to the Lord's Love are liberated.<br>
  They control their sexual desires, and their lifestyle is the self-discipline of Truth.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they meditate forever on the Lord. This devotional worship is pleasing to the Lord. ||7||<br>
  To live as Gurmukh is devotional worship, throughout the four ages.<br>
  This devotional worship is not obtained by any other means.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained only through devotion to the Guru. So focus your consciousness on the Guru's Feet. ||8||20||21||<br>

  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who intuitively enter into the peace of Samaadhi.<br>
  Those who serve the Lord are always beautiful. The glory of their intuitive awareness is beautiful. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All call themselves Your devotees,<br>
  but they alone are Your devotees, who are pleasing to Your mind.<br>
  Through the True Word of Your Bani, they praise You; attuned to Your Love, they worship You with devotion. ||2||<br>
  All are Yours, O Dear True Lord.<br>
  Meeting the Gurmukh, this cycle of reincarnation comes to an end.<br>
  When it pleases Your Will, then we merge in the Name. You Yourself inspire us to chant the Name. ||3||<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, I enshrine the Lord within my mind.<br>
  Pleasure and pain, and all emotional attachments are gone.<br>
  I am lovingly centered on the One Lord forever. I enshrine the Lord's Name within my mind. ||4||<br>
  Your devotees are attuned to Your Love; they are always joyful.<br>
  The nine treasures of the Naam come to dwell within their minds.<br>
  By perfect destiny, they find the True Guru, and through the Word of the Shabad, they are united in the Lord's Union. ||5||<br>
  You are Merciful, and always the Giver of peace.<br>
  You Yourself unite us; You are known only to the Gurmukhs.<br>
  You Yourself bestow the glorious greatness of the Naam; attuned to the Naam, we find peace. ||6||<br>
  Forever and ever, O True Lord, I praise You.<br>
  As Gurmukh, I know no other at all.<br>
  My mind remains immersed in the One Lord; my mind surrenders to Him, and in my mind I meet Him. ||7||<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh, praises the Lord.<br>
  Our True Lord and Master is Carefree.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the mind; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we merge with the Lord. ||8||21||22||<br>

  True is the Dear Lord, and True is His Name.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, some merge with Him.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, those who merge with the Lord shall not be separated from Him again. They merge with intuitive ease into the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  There is nothing beyond You;<br>
  You are the One who does, sees, and knows.<br>
  The Creator Himself acts, and inspires others to act. Through the Guru's Teachings, He blends us into Himself. ||3||<br>
  The virtuous soul-bride finds the Lord;<br>
  she decorates herself with the Love and the Fear of God.<br>
  She who serves the True Guru is forever a happy soul-bride. She is absorbed in the true teachings. ||4||<br>
  Those who forget the Word of the Shabad have no home and no place of rest.<br>
  They are deluded by doubt, like a crow in a deserted house.<br>
  They forfeit both this world and the next, and they pass their lives suffering in pain and misery. ||5||<br>
  Writing on and on endlessly, they run out of paper and ink.<br>
  Through the love with duality, no one has found peace.<br>
  They write falsehood, and they practice falsehood; they are burnt to ashes by focusing their consciousness on falsehood. ||6||<br>
  The Gurmukhs write and reflect on Truth, and only Truth.<br>
  The true ones find the gate of salvation.<br>
  True is their paper, pen and ink; writing Truth, they are absorbed in the True One. ||7||<br>
  My God sits deep within the self; He watches over us.<br>
  Those who meet the Lord, by Guru's Grace, are acceptable.<br>

  Enshrining the Lord within their minds, they are liberated forever. With intuitive ease, they merge into the Lord. ||3||<br>
  They perform all sorts of rituals, but they do not obtain liberation through them.<br>
  They wander around the countryside, and in love with duality, they are ruined.<br>

  Some are stuck in falsehood, and false are the rewards they receive.<br>
  In love with duality, they waste away their lives in vain.<br>

  How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, look within their bodies, into their minds.<br>
  Through loving devotion, their ego evaporates.<br>
  The Siddhas, the seekers and the silent sages continually, lovingly focus their consciousness, but they have not seen the mind within the body. ||7||<br>

  Deep within, the Divine Light has dawned, and the darkness of ignorance has been dispelled.<br>
  My light has merged into the Light; my mind has surrendered, and I am blessed with Glory in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Those who look outside the body, searching for the Lord, shall not receive the Naam; they shall instead be forced to suffer the terrible pains of slavery.<br>
  The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not understand; but when they return once again to their own home, then, as Gurmukh, they find the genuine article. ||4||<br>

  The Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani emanates from the Word of the Shabad. The Gurmukh speaks it and hears it. ||3||<br>
  He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer.<br>
  One who breaks out of bondage is liberated forever.<br>
  The True Lord is liberated forever. The Unseen Lord causes Himself to be seen. ||4||<br>
  He Himself is Maya, and He Himself is the Illusion.<br>
  He Himself has generated emotional attachment throughout the entire universe.<br>

  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the hearts of those who see the Lord themselves, and inspire others to see Him as well. ||8||26||27||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  My God is pervading and permeating all places.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I have found Him within the home of my own heart.<br>
  I serve Him constantly, and I meditate on Him single-mindedly. As Gurmukh, I am absorbed in the True One. ||1||<br>

  Through the Guru's Teachings, I merge with intuitive ease into the Lord, the Life of the World, the Fearless One, the Great Giver. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Within the home of the self is the earth, its support and the nether regions of the underworld.<br>
  Within the home of the self is the Eternally Young Beloved.<br>
  The Giver of peace is eternally blissful. Through the Guru's Teachings, we are absorbed in intuitive peace. ||2||<br>
  When the body is filled with ego and selfishness,<br>
  the cycle of birth and death does not end.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh subdues egotism, and meditates on the Truest of the True. ||3||<br>
  Within this body are the two brothers, sin and virtue.<br>
  When the two joined together, the Universe was produced.<br>
  Subduing both, and entering into the Home of the One, through the Guru's Teachings, we are absorbed in intuitive peace. ||4||<br>
  Within the home of the self is the darkness of the love of duality.<br>
  When the Divine Light dawns, ego and selfishness are dispelled.<br>

  The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and eternal peace is obtained, as one's light merges into the Light. ||6||<br>
  Within the mansion is the treasure house, overflowing with jewels.<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the Infinite Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh, the trader, always purchases the merchandise of the Naam, and always reaps profits. ||7||<br>
  The Lord Himself keeps this merchandise in stock, and He Himself distributes it.<br>
  Rare is that Gurmukh who trades in this.<br>
  O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, obtain it. Through His Mercy, it is enshrined in the mind. ||8||27||28||<br>

  The True Name is eternally pure and immaculate. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is enshrined within the mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Guru Himself is the Giver, the Architect of Destiny.<br>
  The Gurmukh, the humble servant who serves the Lord, comes to know Him.<br>
  Those humble beings look beautiful forever in the Ambrosial Naam. Through the Guru's Teachings, they receive the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Within the cave of this body, there is one beautiful place.<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, ego and doubt are dispelled.<br>
  Night and day, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; imbued with the Lord's Love, by Guru's Grace, you shall find Him. ||3||<br>

  The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the self.<br>
  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and decorate yourself with the Shabad. Meeting with your Beloved, you shall find peace. ||4||<br>
  The Messenger of Death imposes his tax on those who are attached to duality.<br>
  He inflicts punishment on those who forget the Name.<br>
  They are called to account for each instant and each moment. Every grain, every particle, is weighed and counted. ||5||<br>
  One who does not remember her Husband Lord in this world is being cheated by duality; she shall weep bitterly in the end.<br>
  She is from an evil family; she is ugly and vile. Even in her dreams, she does not meet her Husband Lord. ||6||<br>
  She who enshrines her Husband Lord in her mind in this world<br>
  -His Presence is revealed to her by the Perfect Guru.<br>
  That soul-bride keeps her Husband Lord clasped tightly to her heart, and through the Word of the Shabad, she enjoys her Husband Lord upon His Beautiful Bed. ||7||<br>
  The Lord Himself sends out the call, and He summons us to His Presence.<br>
  He enshrines His Name within our minds.<br>
  O Nanak, one who receives the greatness of the Naam night and day, constantly sings His Glorious Praises. ||8||28||29||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  Sublime is their birth, and the place where they dwell.<br>
  Those who serve the True Guru remain detached in the home of their own being.<br>
  They abide in the Lord's Love, and constantly imbued with His Love, their minds are satisfied and fulfilled with the Lord's Essence. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who read of the Lord, who understand and enshrine Him within their minds.<br>
  The Gurmukhs read and praise the Lord's Name; they are honored in the True Court. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Unseen and Inscrutable Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere.<br>
  He cannot be obtained by any effort.<br>
  If the Lord grants His Grace, then we come to meet the True Guru. By His Kindness, we are united in His Union. ||2||<br>
  One who reads, while attached to duality, does not understand.<br>
  He yearns for the three-phased Maya.<br>
  The bonds of the three-phased Maya are broken by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Through the Guru's Shabad, liberation is achieved. ||3||<br>
  This unstable mind cannot be held steady.<br>
  Attached to duality, it wanders in the ten directions.<br>
  It is a poisonous worm, drenched with poison, and in poison it rots away. ||4||<br>
  Practicing egotism and selfishness, they try to impress others by showing off.<br>
  They perform all sorts of rituals, but they gain no acceptance.<br>
  Without You, Lord, nothing happens at all. You forgive those who are adorned with the Word of Your Shabad. ||5||<br>
  They are born, and they die, but they do not understand the Lord.<br>
  Night and day, they wander, in love with duality.<br>
  The lives of the self-willed manmukhs are useless; in the end, they die, regretting and repenting. ||6||<br>
  The Husband is away, and the wife is getting dressed up.<br>
  This is what the blind, self-willed manmukhs are doing.<br>
  They are not honored in this world, and they shall find no shelter in the world hereafter. They are wasting their lives in vain. ||7||<br>
  How rare are those who know the Name of the Lord!<br>
  Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, the Lord is realized.<br>
  Night and day, they perform the Lord's devotional service; day and night, they find intuitive peace. ||8||<br>
  That One Lord is pervading in all.<br>
  Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand this.<br>
  O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are beautiful. Granting His Grace, God unites them with Himself. ||9||29||30||<br>

  The self-willed manmukhs read and recite; they are called Pandits-spiritual scholars.<br>
  But they are in love with duality, and they suffer in terrible pain.<br>
  Intoxicated with vice, they understand nothing at all. They are reincarnated, over and over again. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who subdue their ego, and unite with the Lord.<br>
  They serve the Guru, and the Lord dwells within their minds; they intuitively drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Pandits read the Vedas, but they do not obtain the Lord's essence.<br>
  Intoxicated with Maya, they argue and debate.<br>
  The foolish intellectuals are forever in spiritual darkness. The Gurmukhs understand, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The Indescribable is described only through the beauteous Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, the Truth becomes pleasing to the mind.<br>
  Those who speak of the truest of the true, day and night-their minds are imbued with the Truth. ||3||<br>

  The filth of fraud and falsehood does not stick to those who, by Guru's Grace, remain awake and aware, night and day.<br>
  The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within their hearts; their light merges into the Light. ||5||<br>
  They read about the three qualities, but they do not know the essential reality of the Lord.<br>
  They forget the Primal Lord, the Source of all, and they do not recognize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  They are engrossed in emotional attachment; they do not understand anything at all. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found. ||6||<br>
  The Vedas proclaim that Maya is of three qualities.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs, in love with duality, do not understand.<br>
  They read of the three qualities, but they do not know the One Lord. Without understanding, they obtain only pain and suffering. ||7||<br>
  When it pleases the Lord, He unites us with Himself.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, skepticism and suffering are dispelled.<br>
  O Nanak, True is the Greatness of the Name. Believing in the Name, peace is obtained. ||8||30||31||<br>
  Maajh, Third Mehl:<br>
  The Lord Himself is Unmanifest and Unrelated; He is Manifest and Related as well.<br>
  Those who recognize this essential reality are the true Pandits, the spiritual scholars.<br>
  They save themselves, and save all their families and ancestors as well, when they enshrine the Lord's Name in the mind. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who taste the essence of the Lord, and savor its taste.<br>
  Those who taste this essence of the Lord are the pure, immaculate beings. They meditate on the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who reflect upon the Shabad are beyond karma.<br>
  They subdue their ego, and find the essence of wisdom, deep within their being.<br>
  They obtain the nine treasures of the wealth of the Naam. Rising above the three qualities, they merge into the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Those who act in ego do not go beyond karma.<br>
  It is only by Guru's Grace that one is rid of ego.<br>
  Those who have discriminating minds, continually examine their own selves. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they sing the Lord's Glorious Praises. ||3||<br>
  The Lord is the most pure and sublime Ocean. The Saintly Gurmukhs continually peck at the Naam, like swans pecking at pearls in the ocean.<br>
  They bathe in it continually, day and night, and the filth of ego is washed away. ||4||<br>
  The pure swans, with love and affection, dwell in the Ocean of the Lord, and subdue their ego.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 036</h2></center>
  Day and night, they are in love with the True Word of the Shabad. They obtain their home in the Ocean of the Lord. ||5||<br>

  They may bathe, but their filth is not removed.<br>
  One who dies while yet alive, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad, is rid of this filth of ego. ||6||<br>

  The whole world is engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya.<br>
  Those who are controlled by the three qualities are attached to Maya.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, a few come to understand; they center their consciousness in the fourth state. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who burn away their emotional attachment to Maya, through the Shabad.<br>
  Those who burn away this attachment to Maya, and focus their consciousness on the Lord are honored in the True Court, and the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The source, the root, of the gods and goddesses is Maya.<br>
  For them, the Simritees and the Shaastras were composed.<br>
  Sexual desire and anger are diffused throughout the universe. Coming and going, people suffer in pain. ||2||<br>
  The jewel of spiritual wisdom was placed within the universe.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, it is enshrined within the mind.<br>
  Celibacy, chastity, self-discipline and the practice of truthfulness are obtained from the Perfect Guru, by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  In this world of her parents' home, the soul-bride has been deluded by doubt.<br>
  Attached to duality, she later comes to regret it.<br>
  She forfeits both this world and the next, and even in her dreams, she does not find peace. ||4||<br>
  The soul-bride who remembers her Husband Lord in this world,<br>
  by Guru's Grace, sees Him close at hand.<br>
  She remains intuitively attuned to the Love of her Beloved; she makes the Word of His Shabad her decoration. ||5||<br>

  through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they burn their love of duality.<br>
  The One Lord is permeating and pervading deep within the heart. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||6||<br>
  Those who do not serve the True Guru-why did they even come into this world?<br>
  Cursed are their lives; they have uselessly wasted this human life.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs do not remember the Naam. Without the Naam, they suffer in terrible pain. ||7||<br>

  Bestowing Your Mercy, You merge us into Yourself.<br>
  Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, we meditate on the Lord. Serving the Shabad, peace is found. ||5||<br>

  Praising the Naam, one becomes pleasing to the True One.<br>
  The Gurmukh remains forever imbued with the Lord's Love. Meeting the True Lord, glory is obtained. ||6||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in ego.<br>
  They lose their whole lives in the gamble.<br>
  Within is the terrible darkness of greed, and so they come and go in reincarnation, over and over again. ||7||<br>

  We have grown weary of wandering to the four corners of the earth and in the ten directions. We have come to Your Sanctuary, God.<br>
  Without milk, a cow serves no purpose.<br>
  Without water, the crop withers, and it will not bring a good price.<br>
  If we do not meet the Lord, our Friend, how can we find our place of rest?<br>
  Those homes, those hearts, in which the Husband Lord is not manifest-those towns and villages are like burning furnaces.<br>
  All decorations, the chewing of betel to sweeten the breath, and the body itself, are all useless and vain.<br>
  Without God, our Husband, our Lord and Master, all friends and companions are like the Messenger of Death.<br>
  This is Nanak's prayer: "Please show Your Mercy, and bestow Your Name.<br>
  O my Lord and Master, please unite me with Yourself, O God, in the Eternal Mansion of Your Presence". ||1||<br>
  In the month of Chayt, by meditating on the Lord of the Universe, a deep and profound joy arises.<br>
  Meeting with the humble Saints, the Lord is found, as we chant His Name with our tongues.<br>
  Those who have found God-blessed is their coming into this world.<br>
  Those who live without Him, for even an instant-their lives are rendered useless.<br>
  The Lord is totally pervading the water, the land, and all space. He is contained in the forests as well.<br>
  Those who do not remember God-how much pain must they suffer!<br>
  Those who dwell upon their God have great good fortune.<br>
  My mind yearns for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. O Nanak, my mind is so thirsty!<br>
  I touch the feet of one who unites me with God in the month of Chayt. ||2||<br>
  In the month of Vaisaakh, how can the bride be patient? She is separated from her Beloved.<br>
  She has forgotten the Lord, her Life-companion, her Master; she has become attached to Maya, the deceitful one.<br>
  Neither son, nor spouse, nor wealth shall go along with you-only the Eternal Lord.<br>
  Entangled and enmeshed in the love of false occupations, the whole world is perishing.<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the One Lord, they lose their lives in the hereafter.<br>
  Forgetting the Merciful Lord, they are ruined. Without God, there is no other at all.<br>
  Pure is the reputation of those who are attached to the Feet of the Beloved Lord.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 041</h2></center>
  Nanak makes this prayer to God: "Please, come and unite me with Yourself."<br>
  The month of Vaisaakh is beautiful and pleasant, when the Saint causes me to meet the Lord. ||3||<br>
  In the month of Jayt'h, the bride longs to meet with the Lord. All bow in humility before Him.<br>
  One who has grasped the hem of the robe of the Lord, the True Friend-no one can keep him in bondage.<br>
  God's Name is the Jewel, the Pearl. It cannot be stolen or taken away.<br>
  In the Lord are all pleasures which please the mind.<br>
  As the Lord wishes, so He acts, and so His creatures act.<br>
  They alone are called blessed, whom God has made His Own.<br>
  If people could meet the Lord by their own efforts, why would they be crying out in the pain of separation?<br>
  Meeting Him in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, celestial bliss is enjoyed.<br>
  In the month of Jayt'h, the playful Husband Lord meets her, upon whose forehead such good destiny is recorded. ||4||<br>
  The month of Aasaarh seems burning hot, to those who are not close to their Husband Lord.<br>
  They have forsaken God the Primal Being, the Life of the World, and they have come to rely upon mere mortals.<br>
  In the love of duality, the soul-bride is ruined; around her neck she wears the noose of Death.<br>
  As you plant, so shall you harvest; your destiny is recorded on your forehead.<br>
  The life-night passes away, and in the end, one comes to regret and repent, and then depart with no hope at all.<br>
  Those who meet with the Holy Saints are liberated in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Show Your Mercy to me, O God; I am thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  Without You, God, there is no other at all. This is Nanak's humble prayer.<br>
  The month of Aasaarh is pleasant, when the Feet of the Lord abide in the mind. ||5||<br>
  In the month of Saawan, the soul-bride is happy, if she falls in love with the Lotus Feet of the Lord.<br>
  Her mind and body are imbued with the Love of the True One; His Name is her only Support.<br>
  The pleasures of corruption are false. All that is seen shall turn to ashes.<br>
  The drops of the Lord's Nectar are so beautiful! Meeting the Holy Saint, we drink these in.<br>
  The forests and the meadows are rejuvenated and refreshed with the Love of God, the All-powerful, Infinite Primal Being.<br>
  My mind yearns to meet the Lord. If only He would show His Mercy, and unite me with Himself!<br>
  Those brides who have obtained God-I am forever a sacrifice to them.<br>
  O Nanak, when the Dear Lord shows kindness, He adorns His bride with the Word of His Shabad.<br>
  Saawan is delightful for those happy soul-brides whose hearts are adorned with the Necklace of the Lord's Name. ||6||<br>
  In the month of Bhaadon, she is deluded by doubt, because of her attachment to duality.<br>
  She may wear thousands of ornaments, but they are of no use at all.<br>
  On that day when the body perishes-at that time, she becomes a ghost.<br>
  The Messenger of Death seizes and holds her, and does not tell anyone his secret.<br>
  And her loved ones-in an instant, they move on, leaving her all alone.<br>
  She wrings her hands, her body writhes in pain, and she turns from black to white.<br>
  As she has planted, so does she harvest; such is the field of karma.<br>
  Nanak seeks God's Sanctuary; God has given him the Boat of His Feet.<br>
  Those who love the Guru, the Protector and Savior, in Bhaadon, shall not be thrown down into hell. ||7||<br>
  In the month of Assu, my love for the Lord overwhelms me. How can I go and meet the Lord?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 042</h2></center>
  My mind and body are so thirsty for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Won't someone please come and lead me to him, O my mother.<br>
  The Saints are the helpers of the Lord's lovers; I fall and touch their feet.<br>
  Without God, how can I find peace? There is nowhere else to go.<br>
  Those who have tasted the sublime essence of His Love, remain satisfied and fulfilled.<br>
  They renounce their selfishness and conceit, and they pray, "God, please attach me to the hem of Your robe."<br>
  Those whom the Husband Lord has united with Himself, shall not be separated from Him again.<br>
  Without God, there is no other at all. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord.<br>
  In Assu, the Lord, the Sovereign King, has granted His Mercy, and they dwell in peace. ||8||<br>
  In the month of Katak, do good deeds. Do not try to blame anyone else.<br>
  Forgetting the Transcendent Lord, all sorts of illnesses are contracted.<br>
  Those who turn their backs on the Lord shall be separated from Him and consigned to reincarnation, over and over again.<br>
  In an instant, all of Maya's sensual pleasures turn bitter.<br>
  No one can then serve as your intermediary. Unto whom can we turn and cry?<br>
  By one's own actions, nothing can be done; destiny was pre-determined from the very beginning.<br>
  By great good fortune, I meet my God, and then all pain of separation departs.<br>
  Please protect Nanak, God; O my Lord and Master, please release me from bondage.<br>
  In Katak, in the Company of the Holy, all anxiety vanishes. ||9||<br>
  In the month of Maghar, those who sit with their Beloved Husband Lord are beautiful.<br>
  How can their glory be measured? Their Lord and Master blends them with Himself.<br>
  Their bodies and minds blossom forth in the Lord; they have the companionship of the Holy Saints.<br>
  Those who lack the Company of the Holy, remain all alone.<br>
  Their pain never departs, and they fall into the grip of the Messenger of Death.<br>
  Those who have ravished and enjoyed their God, are seen to be continually exalted and uplifted.<br>
  They wear the Necklace of the jewels, emeralds and rubies of the Lord's Name.<br>
  Nanak seeks the dust of the feet of those who take to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Door.<br>
  Those who worship and adore God in Maghar, do not suffer the cycle of reincarnation ever again. ||10||<br>
  In the month of Poh, the cold does not touch those, whom the Husband Lord hugs close in His Embrace.<br>
  Their minds are transfixed by His Lotus Feet. They are attached to the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<br>
  Seek the Protection of the Lord of the Universe; His service is truly profitable.<br>
  Corruption shall not touch you, when you join the Holy Saints and sing the Lord's Praises.<br>
  From where it originated, there the soul is blended again. It is absorbed in the Love of the True Lord.<br>
  When the Supreme Lord God grasps someone's hand, he shall never again suffer separation from Him.<br>
  I am a sacrifice, 100,000 times, to the Lord, my Friend, the Unapproachable and Unfathomable.<br>
  Please preserve my honor, Lord; Nanak begs at Your Door.<br>
  Poh is beautiful, and all comforts come to that one, whom the Carefree Lord has forgiven. ||11||<br>
  In the month of Maagh, let your cleansing bath be the dust of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Meditate and listen to the Name of the Lord, and give it to everyone.<br>
  In this way, the filth of lifetimes of karma shall be removed, and egotistical pride shall vanish from your mind.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 043</h2></center>
  Sexual desire and anger shall not seduce you, and the dog of greed shall depart.<br>
  Those who walk on the Path of Truth shall be praised throughout the world.<br>
  Be kind to all beings-this is more meritorious than bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage and the giving of charity.<br>
  That person, upon whom the Lord bestows His Mercy, is a wise person.<br>
  Nanak is a sacrifice to those who have merged with God.<br>
  In Maagh, they alone are known as true, unto whom the Perfect Guru is Merciful. ||12||<br>
  In the month of Phalgun, bliss comes to those, unto whom the Lord, the Friend, has been revealed.<br>
  The Saints, the Lord's helpers, in their mercy, have united me with Him.<br>
  My bed is beautiful, and I have all comforts. I feel no sadness at all.<br>
  My desires have been fulfilled-by great good fortune, I have obtained the Sovereign Lord as my Husband.<br>
  Join with me, my sisters, and sing the songs of rejoicing and the Hymns of the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  There is no other like the Lord-there is no equal to Him.<br>
  He embellishes this world and the world hereafter, and He gives us our permanent home there.<br>
  He rescues us from the world-ocean; never again do we have to run the cycle of reincarnation.<br>
  I have only one tongue, but Your Glorious Virtues are beyond counting. Nanak is saved, falling at Your Feet.<br>
  In Phalgun, praise Him continually; He has not even an iota of greed. ||13||<br>
  Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord-their affairs are all resolved.<br>
  Those who meditate on the Perfect Guru, the Lord-Incarnate-they are judged true in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  The Lord's Feet are the Treasure of all peace and comfort for them; they cross over the terrifying and treacherous world-ocean.<br>
  They obtain love and devotion, and they do not burn in corruption.<br>
  Falsehood has vanished, duality has been erased, and they are totally overflowing with Truth.<br>
  They serve the Supreme Lord God, and enshrine the One Lord within their minds.<br>
  The months, the days, and the moments are auspicious, for those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace.<br>
  Nanak begs for the blessing of Your Vision, O Lord. Please, shower Your Mercy upon me! ||14||1||<br>
  Maajh, Fifth Mehl: Day And Night:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I serve my True Guru, and meditate on Him all day and night.<br>
  Renouncing selfishness and conceit, I seek His Sanctuary, and speak sweet words to Him.<br>
  Through countless lifetimes and incarnations, I was separated from Him. O Lord, you are my Friend and Companion-please unite me with Yourself.<br>
  Those who are separated from the Lord do not dwell in peace, O sister.<br>
  Without their Husband Lord, they find no comfort. I have searched and seen all realms.<br>
  My own evil actions have kept me separate from Him; why should I accuse anyone else?<br>
  Bestow Your Mercy, God, and save me! No one else can bestow Your Mercy.<br>
  Without You, Lord, we roll around in the dust. Unto whom should we utter our cries of distress?<br>
  This is Nanak's prayer: "May my eyes behold the Lord, the Angelic Being."||1||<br>
  The Lord hears the anguish of the soul; He is the All-powerful and Infinite Primal Being.<br>
  In death and in life, worship and adore the Lord, the Support of all.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 044</h2></center>
  In this world and in the next, the soul-bride belongs to her Husband Lord, who has such a vast family.<br>
  He is Lofty and Inaccessible. His Wisdom is Unfathomable.<br>
  He has no end or limitation. That service is pleasing to Him, which makes one humble, like the dust of the feet of the Saints.<br>
  He is the Patron of the poor, the Merciful, Luminous Lord, the Redeemer of sinners.<br>
  From the very beginning, and throughout the ages, the True Name of the Creator has been our Saving Grace.<br>
  No one can know His Value; no one can weigh it.<br>
  He dwells deep within the mind and body. O Nanak, He cannot be measured.<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to those who serve God, day and night. ||2||<br>
  The Saints worship and adore Him forever and ever; He is the Forgiver of all.<br>
  He fashioned the soul and the body, and by His Kindness, He bestowed the soul.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, worship and adore Him, and chant His Pure Mantra.<br>
  His Value cannot be evaluated. The Transcendent Lord is endless.<br>
  That one, within whose mind the Lord abides, is said to be most fortunate.<br>
  The soul's desires are fulfilled, upon meeting the Master, our Husband Lord.<br>
  Nanak lives by chanting the Lord's Name; all sorrows have been erased.<br>
  One who does not forget Him, day and night, is continually rejuvenated. ||3||<br>
  God is overflowing with all powers. I have no honor-He is my resting place.<br>
  I have grasped the Support of the Lord within my mind; I live by chanting and meditating on His Name.<br>
  Grant Your Grace, God, and bless me, that I may merge into the dust of the feet of the humble.<br>
  As You keep me, so do I live. I wear and eat whatever You give me.<br>
  May I make the effort, O God, to sing Your Glorious Praises in the Company of the Holy.<br>
  I can conceive of no other place; where could I go to lodge a complaint?<br>
  You are the Dispeller of ignorance, the Destroyer of darkness, O Lofty, Unfathomable and Unapproachable Lord.<br>
  Please unite this separated one with Yourself; this is Nanak's yearning.<br>
  That day shall bring every joy, O Lord, when I take to the Feet of the Guru. ||4||1||<br>
  Vaar In Maajh, And Shaloks Of The First Mehl: To Be Sung To The Tune Of "Malik Mureed And Chandrahraa Sohee-Aa"<br>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  The Guru is the Giver; the Guru is the House of ice. The Guru is the Light of the three worlds.<br>
  O Nanak, He is everlasting wealth. Place your mind's faith in Him, and you shall find peace. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  First, the baby loves mother's milk;<br>
  second, he learns of his mother and father;<br>
  third, his brothers, sisters-in-law and sisters;<br>
  fourth, the love of play awakens.<br>
  Fifth, he runs after food and drink;<br>
  sixth, in his sexual desire, he does not respect social customs.<br>
  Seventh, he gathers wealth and dwells in his house;<br>
  eighth, he becomes angry, and his body is consumed.<br>
  Ninth, he turns grey, and his breathing becomes labored;<br>
  tenth, he is cremated, and turns to ashes.<br>
  His companions send him off, crying out and lamenting.<br>
  The swan of the soul takes flight, and asks which way to go.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 045</h2></center>
  He came and he went, and now, even his name has died.<br>
  After he left, food was offered on leaves, and the birds were called to come and eat.<br>
  O Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs love the darkness.<br>
  Without the Guru, the world is drowning. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  At the age of ten, he is a child; at twenty, a youth, and at thirty, he is called handsome.<br>
  At forty, he is full of life; at fifty, his foot slips, and at sixty, old age is upon him.<br>
  At seventy, he loses his intellect, and at eighty, he cannot perform his duties.<br>
  At ninety, he lies in his bed, and he cannot understand his weakness.<br>
  After seeking and searching for such a long time, O Nanak, I have seen that the world is just a mansion of smoke. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You, O Creator Lord, are Unfathomable. You Yourself created the Universe,<br>
  its colors, qualities and varieties, in so many ways and forms.<br>
  You created it, and You alone understand it. It is all Your Play.<br>
  Some come, and some arise and depart; but without the Name, all are bound to die.<br>
  The Gurmukhs are imbued with the deep crimson color of the poppy; they are dyed in the color of the Lord's Love.<br>
  So serve the True and Pure Lord, the Supremely Powerful Architect of Destiny.<br>
  You Yourself are All-knowing. O Lord, You are the Greatest of the Great!<br>
  O my True Lord, I am a sacrifice, a humble sacrifice, to those who meditate on You within their conscious mind. ||1||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  He placed the soul in the body which He had fashioned. He protects the Creation which He has created.<br>
  With their eyes, they see, and with their tongues, they speak; with their ears, they bring the mind to awareness.<br>
  With their feet, they walk, and with their hands, they work; they wear and eat whatever is given.<br>
  They do not know the One who created the Creation. The blind fools do their dark deeds.<br>
  When the pitcher of the body breaks and shatters into pieces, it cannot be re-created again.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Guru, there is no honor; without honor, no one is carried across. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  They prefer the gift, instead of the Giver; such is the way of the self-willed manmukhs.<br>
  What can anyone say about their intelligence, their understanding or their cleverness?<br>
  The deeds which one commits, while sitting in one's own home, are known far and wide, in the four directions.<br>
  One who lives righteously is known as righteous; one who commits sins is known as a sinner.<br>
  You Yourself enact the entire play, O Creator. Why should we speak of any other?<br>
  As long as Your Light is within the body, You speak through that Light. Without Your Light, who can do anything? Show me any such cleverness!<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord alone is Perfect and All-knowing; He is revealed to the Gurmukh. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself put it to work.<br>
  Administering the drug of emotional attachment, You Yourself have led the world astray.<br>
  The fire of desire is deep within; unsatisfied, people remain hungry and thirsty.<br>
  This world is an illusion; it dies and it is re-born-it comes and it goes in reincarnation.<br>
  Without the True Guru, emotional attachment is not broken. All have grown weary of performing empty rituals.<br>
  Those who follow the Guru's Teachings meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Filled with a joyful peace, they surrender to Your Will.<br>
  They save their families and ancestors; blessed are the mothers who gave birth to them.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 046</h2></center>
  Beautiful and sublime is the glory and the understanding of those who focus their consciousness on the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  To see without eyes; to hear without ears;<br>
  to walk without feet; to work without hands;<br>
  to speak without a tongue-like this, one remains dead while yet alive.<br>
  O Nanak, recognize the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and merge with your Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  He is seen, heard and known, but His subtle essence is not obtained.<br>
  How can the lame, armless and blind person run to embrace the Lord?<br>
  Let the Fear of God be your feet, and let His Love be your hands; let His Understanding be your eyes.<br>
  Says Nanak, in this way, O wise soul-bride, you shall be united with your Husband Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Forever and ever, You are the only One; You set the play of duality in motion.<br>
  You created egotism and arrogant pride, and You placed greed within our beings.<br>
  Keep me as it pleases Your Will; everyone acts as You cause them to act.<br>
  Some are forgiven, and merge with You; through the Guru's Teachings, we are joined to You.<br>
  Some stand and serve You; without the Name, nothing else pleases them.<br>
  Any other task would be worthless to them-You have enjoined them to Your True Service.<br>
  In the midst of children, spouse and relations, some still remain detached; they are pleasing to Your Will.<br>
  Inwardly and outwardly, they are pure, and they are absorbed in the True Name. ||3||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  I may make a cave, in a mountain of gold, or in the water of the nether regions;<br>
  I may remain standing on my head, upside-down, on the earth or up in the sky;<br>
  I may totally cover my body with clothes, and wash them continually;<br>
  I may shout out loud, the white, red, yellow and black Vedas;<br>
  I may even live in dirt and filth. And yet, all this is just a product of evil-mindedness, and intellectual corruption.<br>
  I was not, I am not, and I will never be anything at all! O Nanak, I dwell only on the Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  They wash their clothes, and scrub their bodies, and try to practice self-discipline.<br>
  But they are not aware of the filth staining their inner being, while they try and try to wash off the outer dirt.<br>
  The blind go astray, caught by the noose of Death.<br>
  They see other people's property as their own, and in egotism, they suffer in pain.<br>
  O Nanak, the egotism of the Gurmukhs is broken, and then, they meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  They chant the Naam, meditate on the Naam, and through the Naam, they are absorbed in peace. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Destiny has brought together and united the body and the soul-swan.<br>
  He who created them, also separates them.<br>
  The fools enjoy their pleasures; they must also endure all their pains.<br>
  From pleasures, arise diseases and the commission of sins.<br>
  From sinful pleasures come sorrow, separation, birth and death.<br>
  The fools try to account for their misdeeds, and argue uselessly.<br>
  The judgement is in the Hands of the True Guru, who puts an end to the argument.<br>
  Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. It cannot be changed by anyone's efforts. ||4||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Telling lies, they eat dead bodies.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 047</h2></center>
  And yet, they go out to teach others.<br>
  They are deceived, and they deceive their companions.<br>
  O Nanak, such are the leaders of men. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Those, within whom the Truth dwells, obtain the True Name; they speak only the Truth.<br>
  They walk on the Lord's Path, and inspire others to walk on the Lord's Path as well.<br>
  Bathing in a pool of holy water, they are washed clean of filth. But, by bathing in a stagnant pond, they are contaminated with even more filth.<br>
  The True Guru is the Perfect Pool of Holy Water. Night and day, He meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  He is saved, along with his family; bestowing the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, He saves the whole world.<br>
  Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to one who himself chants the Naam, and inspires others to chant it as well. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Some pick and eat fruits and roots, and live in the wilderness.<br>
  Some wander around wearing saffron robes, as Yogis and Sanyaasees.<br>
  But there is still so much desire within them-they still yearn for clothes and food.<br>
  They waste their lives uselessly; they are neither householders nor renunciates.<br>
  The Messenger of Death hangs over their heads, and they cannot escape the three-phased desire.<br>
  Death does not even approach those who follow the Guru's Teachings, and become the slaves of the Lord's slaves.<br>
  The True Word of the Shabad abides in their true minds; within the home of their own inner beings, they remain detached.<br>
  O Nanak, those who serve their True Guru, rise from desire to desirelessness. ||5||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  If one's clothes are stained with blood, the garment becomes polluted.<br>
  Those who suck the blood of human beings-how can their consciousness be pure?<br>
  O Nanak, chant the Name of God, with heart-felt devotion.<br>
  Everything else is just a pompous worldly show, and the practice of false deeds. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Since I am no one, what can I say? Since I am nothing, what can I be?<br>
  As He created me, so I act. As He causes me to speak, so I speak. I am full and overflowing with sins-if only I could wash them away!<br>
  I do not understand myself, and yet I try to teach others. Such is the guide I am!<br>
  O Nanak, the one who is blind shows others the way, and misleads all his companions.<br>
  But, going to the world hereafter, he shall be beaten and kicked in the face; then, it will be obvious, what sort of guide he was! ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Through all the months and the seasons, the minutes and the hours, I dwell upon You, O Lord.<br>
  No one has attained You by clever calculations, O True, Unseen and Infinite Lord.<br>
  That scholar who is full of greed, arrogant pride and egotism, is known to be a fool.<br>
  So read the Name, and realize the Name, and contemplate the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, I have earned the wealth of the Naam; I possess the storehouses, overflowing with devotion to the Lord.<br>
  Believing in the Immaculate Naam, one is hailed as true, in the True Court of the Lord.<br>
  The Divine Light of the Infinite Lord, who owns the soul and the breath of life, is deep within the inner being.<br>
  You alone are the True Banker, O Lord; the rest of the world is just Your petty trader. ||6||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Let mercy be your mosque, faith your prayer-mat, and honest living your Koran.<br>
  Make modesty your circumcision, and good conduct your fast. In this way, you shall be a true Muslim.<br>
  Let good conduct be your Kaabaa, Truth your spiritual guide, and the karma of good deeds your prayer and chant.<br>
  Let your rosary be that which is pleasing to His Will. O Nanak, God shall preserve your honor. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 048</h2></center>
  First Mehl<br>
  : To take what rightfully belongs to another, is like a Muslim eating pork, or a Hindu eating beef.<br>
  Our Guru, our Spiritual Guide, stands by us, if we do not eat those carcasses.<br>
  By mere talk, people do not earn passage to Heaven. Salvation comes only from the practice of Truth.<br>
  By adding spices to forbidden foods, they are not made acceptable.<br>
  O Nanak, from false talk, only falsehood is obtained. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  There are five prayers and five times of day for prayer; the five have five names.<br>
  Let the first be truthfulness, the second honest living, and the third charity in the Name of God.<br>
  Let the fourth be good will to all, and the fifth the praise of the Lord.<br>
  Repeat the prayer of good deeds, and then, you may call yourself a Muslim.<br>
  O Nanak, the false obtain falsehood, and only falsehood. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Some trade in priceless jewels, while others deal in mere glass.<br>
  When the True Guru is pleased, we find the treasure of the jewel, deep within the self.<br>
  Without the Guru, no one has found this treasure. The blind and the false have died in their endless wanderings.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs putrefy and die in duality. They do not understand contemplative meditation.<br>
  Without the One Lord, there is no other at all. Unto whom should they complain?<br>
  Some are destitute, and wander around endlessly, while others have storehouses of wealth.<br>
  Without God's Name, there is no other wealth. Everything else is just poison and ashes.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord Himself acts, and causes others to act; by the Hukam of His Command, we are embellished and exalted. ||7||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  It is difficult to be called a Muslim; if one is truly a Muslim, then he may be called one.<br>
  First, let him savor the religion of the Prophet as sweet; then, let his pride of his possessions be scraped away.<br>
  Becoming a true Muslim, a disciple of the faith of Mohammed, let him put aside the delusion of death and life.<br>
  As he submits to God's Will, and surrenders to the Creator, he is rid of selfishness and conceit.<br>
  And when, O Nanak, he is merciful to all beings, only then shall he be called a Muslim. ||1||<br>
  Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Renounce sexual desire, anger, falsehood and slander; forsake Maya and eliminate egotistical pride.<br>
  Renounce sexual desire and promiscuity, and give up emotional attachment. Only then shall you obtain the Immaculate Lord amidst the darkness of the world.<br>
  Renounce selfishness, conceit and arrogant pride, and your love for your children and spouse. Abandon your thirsty hopes and desires, and embrace love for the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, the True One shall come to dwell in your mind. Through the True Word of the Shabad, you shall be absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Neither the kings, nor their subjects, nor the leaders shall remain.<br>
  The shops, the cities and the streets shall eventually disintegrate, by the Hukam of the Lord's Command.<br>
  Those solid and beautiful mansions-the fools think that they belong to them.<br>
  The treasure-houses, filled with wealth, shall be emptied out in an instant.<br>
  The horses, chariots, camels and elephants, with all their decorations; the gardens, lands, houses, tents, soft beds and satin pavilions-Oh, where are those things, which they believe to be their own?<br>
  O Nanak, the True One is the Giver of all; He is revealed through His All-powerful Creative Nature. ||8||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  If the rivers became cows, giving milk, and the spring water became milk and ghee;<br>
  If all the earth became sugar, to continually excite the mind;<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 049</h2></center>
  if the mountains became gold and silver, studded with gems and jewels<br>
  -even then, I would worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not decrease. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  If all the eighteen loads of vegetation became fruits,<br>
  and the growing grass became sweet rice; if I were able to stop the sun and the moon in their orbits and hold them perfectly steady<br>
  -even then, I would worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not decrease. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  If my body were afflicted with pain, under the evil influence of unlucky stars;<br>
  and if the blood-sucking kings were to hold power over me<br>
  -even if this were my condition, I would still worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not decrease. ||3||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  If fire and ice were my clothes, and the wind was my food;<br>
  and even if the enticing heavenly beauties were my wives, O Nanak-all this shall pass away!<br>
  Even then, I would worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not decrease. ||4||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The foolish demon, who does evil deeds, does not know his Lord and Master.<br>
  Call him a mad-man, if he does not understand himself.<br>
  The strife of this world is evil; these struggles are consuming it.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, life is worthless. Through doubt, the people are being destroyed.<br>
  One who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated.<br>
  One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn.<br>
  In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth.<br>
  One who eliminates selfishness and conceit is redeemed in the Court of the Lord. ||9||<br>
  First Mehl, Shalok:<br>
  They alone are truly alive, whose minds are filled with the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, no one else is truly alive;<br>
  those who merely live shall depart in dishonor;<br>
  everything they eat is impure.<br>
  Intoxicated with power and thrilled with wealth, they delight in their pleasures, and dance about shamelessly.<br>
  O Nanak, they are deluded and defrauded.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, they lose their honor and depart. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  What good is food, and what good are clothes,<br>
  if the True Lord does not abide within the mind?<br>
  What good are fruits, what good is ghee, sweet jaggery, what good is flour, and what good is meat?<br>
  What good are clothes, and what good is a soft bed, to enjoy pleasures and sensual delights?<br>
  What good is an army, and what good are soldiers, servants and mansions to live in?<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Name, all this paraphernalia shall disappear. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  What good is social class and status? Truthfulness is measured within.<br>
  Pride in one's status is like poison-holding it in your hand and eating it, you shall die.<br>
  The True Lord's Sovereign Rule is known throughout the ages.<br>
  One who respects the Hukam of the Lord's Command is honored and respected in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  By the Order of our Lord and Master, we have been brought into this world.<br>
  The Drummer, the Guru, has announced the Lord's meditation, through the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Some have mounted their horses in response, and others are saddling up.<br>
  Some have tied up their bridles, and others have already ridden off. ||10||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  When the crop is ripe, then it is cut down; only the stalks are left standing.<br>
  The corn on the cob is put into the thresher, and the kernels are separated from the cobs.<br>
  Placing the kernels between the two mill-stones, people sit and grind the corn.<br>
  Those kernels which stick to the central axle are spared-Nanak has seen this wonderful vision! ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Look, and see how the sugar-cane is cut down. After cutting away its branches, its feet are bound together into bundles,<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 050</h2></center>
  and then, it is placed between the wooden rollers and crushed.<br>
  What punishment is inflicted upon it! Its juice is extracted and placed in the cauldron; as it is heated, it groans and cries out.<br>
  And then, the crushed cane is collected and burnt in the fire below.<br>
  Nanak: come, people, and see how the sweet sugar-cane is treated! ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Some do not think of death; they entertain great hopes.<br>
  They die, and are re-born, and die, over and over again. They are of no use at all!<br>
  In their conscious minds, they call themselves good.<br>
  The King of the Angels of Death hunts down those self-willed manmukhs, over and over again.<br>
  The manmukhs are false to their own selves; they feel no gratitude for what they have been given.<br>
  Those who merely perform rituals of worship are not pleasing to their Lord and Master.<br>
  Those who attain the True Lord and chant His Name are pleasing to the Lord.<br>
  They worship the Lord and bow at His Throne. They fulfill their pre-ordained destiny. ||11||<br>
  First Mehl, Shalok:<br>
  What can deep water do to a fish? What can the vast sky do to a bird?<br>
  What can cold do to a stone? What is married life to a eunuch?<br>
  You may apply sandalwood oil to a dog, but he will still be a dog.<br>
  You may try to teach a deaf person by reading the Simritees to him, but how will he learn?<br>
  You may place a light before a blind man and burn fifty lamps, but how will he see?<br>
  You may place gold before a herd of cattle, but they will pick out the grass to eat.<br>
  You may add flux to iron and melt it, but it will not become soft like cotton.<br>
  O Nanak, this is the nature of a fool-everything he speaks is useless and wasted. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  When pieces of bronze or gold or iron break,<br>
  the metal-smith welds them together again in the fire, and the bond is established.<br>
  If a husband leaves his wife,<br>
  their children may bring them back together in the world, and the bond is established.<br>
  When the king makes a demand, and it is met, the bond is established.<br>
  When the hungry man eats, he is satisfied, and the bond is established.<br>
  In the famine, the rain fills the streams to overflowing, and the bond is established.<br>
  There is a bond between love and words of sweetness.<br>
  When one speaks the Truth, a bond is established with the Holy Scriptures.<br>
  Through goodness and truth, the dead establish a bond with the living.<br>
  Such are the bonds which prevail in the world.<br>
  The fool establishes his bonds only when he is slapped in the face.<br>
  Nanak says this after deep reflection:<br>
  through the Lord's Praise, we establish a bond with His Court. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself created and adorned the Universe, and He Himself contemplates it.<br>
  Some are counterfeit, and some are genuine. He Himself is the Appraiser.<br>
  The genuine are placed in His Treasury, while the counterfeit are thrown away.<br>
  The counterfeit are thrown out of the True Court-unto whom should they complain?<br>
  They should worship and follow the True Guru-this is the lifestyle of excellence.<br>
  The True Guru converts the counterfeit into genuine; through the Word of the Shabad, He embellishes and exalts us.<br>
  Those who have enshrined love and affection for the Guru, are honored in the True Court.<br>
  Who can estimate the value of those who have been forgiven by the Creator Lord Himself? ||12||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  All the spiritual teachers, their disciples and the rulers of the world shall be buried under the ground.<br>
  The emperors shall also pass away; God alone is Eternal.<br>
  You alone, Lord, You alone. ||1||<br>

  Neither the angels, nor the demons, nor human beings, nor the Siddhas, nor the seekers shall remain on the earth.<br>

  You alone, Lord, You alone. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Neither the just, nor the generous, nor any humans at all, nor the seven realms beneath the earth, shall remain.<br>
  The One Lord alone exists. Who else is there?<br>
  You alone, Lord, You alone. ||3||<br>

  First Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, that destiny which is pre-ordained and written on one's forehead<br>
  -no one can erase it.<br>
  The Lord infuses strength, and He takes it away again.<br>
  You alone, O Lord, You alone. ||7||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  True is the Hukam of Your Command. To the Gurmukh, it is known.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, selfishness and conceit are eradicated, and the Truth is realized.<br>
  True is Your Court. It is proclaimed and revealed through the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Meditating deeply on the True Word of the Shabad, I have merged into the Truth.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are always false; they are deluded by doubt.<br>
  They dwell in manure, and they do not know the taste of the Name.<br>
  Without the Name, they suffer the agonies of coming and going.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord Himself is the Appraiser, who distinguishes the counterfeit from the genuine. ||13||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Tigers, hawks, falcons and eagles-the Lord could make them eat grass.<br>
  And those animals which eat grass-He could make them eat meat. He could make them follow this way of life.<br>
  He could raise dry land from the rivers, and turn the deserts into bottomless oceans.<br>
  He could appoint a worm as king, and reduce an army to ashes.<br>
  All beings and creatures live by breathing, but He could keep us alive, even without the breath.<br>
  O Nanak, as it pleases the True Lord, He gives us sustenance. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Some eat meat, while others eat grass.<br>
  Some have all the thirty-six varieties of delicacies,<br>
  while others live in the dirt and eat mud.<br>
  Some control the breath, and regulate their breathing.<br>
  Some live by the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord.<br>
  The Great Giver lives; no one dies.<br>
  O Nanak, those who do not enshrine the Lord within their minds are deluded. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  By the karma of good actions, some come to serve the Perfect Guru.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, some eliminate selfishness and conceit, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Undertaking any other task, they waste their lives in vain.<br>
  Without the Name, all that they wear and eat is poison.<br>
  Praising the True Word of the Shabad, they merge with the True Lord.<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, they do not obtain the home of peace; they are consigned to reincarnation, over and over again.<br>
  Investing counterfeit capital, they earn only falsehood in the world.<br>
  O Nanak, singing the Praises of the Pure, True Lord, they depart with honor. ||14||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  When it pleases You, we play music and sing; when it pleases You, we bathe in water.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 052</h2></center>
  When it pleases You, we smear our bodies with ashes, and blow the horn and the conch shell.<br>
  When it pleases You, we read the Islamic Scriptures, and are acclaimed as Mullahs and Shaykhs.<br>
  When it pleases You, we become kings, and enjoy all sorts of tastes and pleasures.<br>
  When it pleases You, we wield the sword, and cut off the heads of our enemies.<br>
  When it pleases You, we go out to foreign lands; hearing news of home, we come back again.<br>
  When it pleases You, we are attuned to the Name, and when it pleases You, we become pleasing to You.<br>
  Nanak utters this one prayer; everything else is just the practice of falsehood. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  You are so Great-all Greatness flows from You. You are So Good-Goodness radiates from You.<br>
  You are True-all that flows from You is True. Nothing at all is false.<br>
  Talking, seeing, speaking, walking, living and dying-all these are transitory.<br>
  By the Hukam of His Command, He creates, and in His Command, He keeps us. O Nanak, He Himself is True. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Serve the True Guru fearlessly, and your doubt shall be dispelled.<br>
  Do that work which the True Guru asks you to do.<br>
  When the True Guru becomes merciful, we meditate on the Naam.<br>
  The profit of devotional worship is excellent. It is obtained by the Gurmukh.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are trapped in the darkness of falsehood; they practice nothing but falsehood.<br>
  Go to the Gate of Truth, and speak the Truth.<br>
  The True Lord calls the true ones to the Mansion of His Presence.<br>
  O Nanak, the true ones are forever true; they are absorbed in the True Lord. ||15||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the knife, and the kings are butchers; righteousness has sprouted wings and flown away.<br>
  In this dark night of falsehood, the moon of Truth is not visible anywhere.<br>
  I have searched in vain, and I am so confused; in this darkness, I cannot find the path.<br>
  In egotism, they cry out in pain.<br>
  Says Nanak, how will they be saved? ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise has appeared as a Light in the world.<br>
  How rare are those few Gurmukhs who swim across to the other side!<br>
  The Lord bestows His Glance of Grace;<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh receives the jewel. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Between the Lord's devotees and the people of the world, there can never be any true alliance.<br>
  The Creator Himself is infallible. He cannot be fooled; no one can fool Him.<br>
  He blends His devotees with Himself; they practice Truth, and only Truth.<br>
  The Lord Himself leads the people of the world astray; they tell lies, and by telling lies, they eat poison.<br>
  They do not recognize the ultimate reality, that we all must go; they continue to cultivate the poisons of sexual desire and anger.<br>
  The devotees serve the Lord; night and day, they meditate on the Naam.<br>
  Becoming the slaves of the Lord's slaves, they eradicate selfishness and conceit from within.<br>
  In the Court of their Lord and Master, their faces are radiant; they are embellished and exalted with the True Word of the Shabad. ||16||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Those who praise the Lord in the early hours of the morning and meditate on Him single-mindedly,<br>
  are the perfect kings; at the right time, they die fighting.<br>
  In the second watch, the focus of the mind is scattered in all sorts of ways.<br>
  So many fall into the bottomless pit; they are dragged under, and they cannot get out again.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 053</h2></center>
  In the third watch, both hunger and thirst bark for attention, and food is put into the mouth.<br>
  That which is eaten becomes dust, but they are still attached to eating.<br>
  In the fourth watch, they become drowsy. They close their eyes and begin to dream.<br>
  Rising up again, they engage in conflicts; they set the stage as if they will live for 100 years.<br>
  If at all times, at each and every moment, they live in the fear of God<br>
  -O Nanak, the Lord dwells within their minds, and their cleansing bath is true. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  They are the perfect kings, who have found the Perfect Lord.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, they remain unconcerned, imbued with the Love of the One Lord.<br>
  Only a few obtain the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Unimaginably Beauteous Lord.<br>
  Through the perfect karma of good deeds, one meets the Perfect Guru, whose speech is perfect.<br>
  O Nanak, when the Guru makes one perfect, one's weight does not decrease. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  When You are with me, what more could I want? I speak only the Truth.<br>
  Plundered by the thieves of worldly affairs, she does not obtain the Mansion of His Presence.<br>
  Being so stone-hearted, she has lost her chance to serve the Lord.<br>
  That heart, in which the True Lord is not found, should be torn down and re-built.<br>
  How can she be weighed accurately, upon the scale of perfection?<br>
  No one will say that her weight has been shorted, if she rids herself of egotism.<br>
  The genuine are assayed, and accepted in the Court of the All-knowing Lord.<br>
  The genuine merchandise is found only in one shop-it is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||17||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, destroy the eight things, and in the ninth place, conquer the body.<br>
  Within the body are the nine treasures of the Name of the Lord-seek the depths of these virtues.<br>
  Those blessed with the karma of good actions praise the Lord. O Nanak, they make the Guru their spiritual teacher.<br>
  In the fourth watch of the early morning hours, a longing arises in their higher consciousness.<br>
  They are attuned to the river of life; the True Name is in their minds and on their lips.<br>
  The Ambrosial Nectar is distributed, and those with good karma receive this gift.<br>
  Their bodies become golden, and take on the color of spirituality.<br>
  If the Jeweller casts His Glance of Grace, they are not placed in the fire again.<br>
  Throughout the other seven watches of the day, it is good to speak the Truth, and sit with the spiritually wise.<br>
  There, vice and virtue are distinguished, and the capital of falsehood is decreased.<br>
  There, the counterfeit are cast aside, and the genuine are cheered.<br>
  Speech is vain and useless. O Nanak, pain and pleasure are in the power of our Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Air is the Guru, Water is the Father, and Earth is the Great Mother of all.<br>
  Day and night are the two nurses, in whose lap all the world is at play.<br>
  Good deeds and bad deeds-the record is read out in the Presence of the Lord of Dharma.<br>
  According to their own actions, some are drawn closer, and some are driven farther away.<br>
  Those who have meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and departed after having worked by the sweat of their brow<br>
  -O Nanak, their faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, and many others are saved along with them! ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The True Food is the Love of the Lord; the True Guru has spoken.<br>
  With this True Food, I am satisfied, and with the Truth, I am delighted.<br>
  True are the cities and the villages, where one abides in the True Home of the self.<br>
  When the True Guru is pleased, one receives the Lord's Name, and blossoms forth in His Love.<br>
  No one enters the Court of the True Lord through falsehood.<br>
  By uttering falsehood and only falsehood, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is lost.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 054</h2></center>
  No one blocks the way of those who are blessed with the Banner of the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Hearing, understanding and speaking Truth, one is called to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||18||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  If I dressed myself in fire, and built my house of snow, and made iron my food;<br>
  and if I were to drink in all pain like water, and drive the entire earth before me;<br>
  and if I were to place the earth upon a scale and balance it with a single copper coin;<br>
  and if I were to become so great that I could not be contained, and if I were to control and lead all;<br>
  and if I were to possess so much power within my mind that I could cause others to do my bidding-so what?<br>
  As Great as our Lord and Master is, so great are His gifts. He bestows them according to His Will.<br>
  O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, obtain the glorious greatness of the True Name. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  The mouth is not satisfied by speaking, and the ears are not satisfied by hearing.<br>
  The eyes are not satisfied by seeing-each organ seeks out one sensory quality.<br>
  The hunger of the hungry is not appeased; by mere words, hunger is not relieved.<br>
  O Nanak, hunger is relieved only when one utters the Glorious Praises of the Praiseworthy Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Without the True One, all are false, and all practice falsehood.<br>
  Without the True One, the false ones are bound and gagged and driven off.<br>
  Without the True One, the body is just ashes, and it mingles again with ashes.<br>
  Without the True Ome, all food and clothes are unsatisfying.<br>
  Without the True One, the false ones do not attain the Lord's Court.<br>
  Attached to false attachments, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is lost.<br>
  The whole world is deceived by deception, coming and going in reincarnation.<br>
  Within the body is the fire of desire; through the Word of the Shabad, it is quenched. ||19||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, the Guru is the tree of contentment, with flowers of faith, and fruits of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Watered with the Lord's Love, it remains forever green; through the karma of good deeds and meditation, it ripens.<br>
  Honor is obtained by eating this tasty dish; of all gifts, this is the greatest gift. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The Guru is the tree of gold, with leaves of coral, and blossoms of jewels and rubies.<br>
  The Words from His Mouth are fruits of jewels. Within His Heart, He beholds the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, He is obtained by those, upon whose faces and foreheads such pre-recorded destiny is written.<br>
  The sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage are contained in the constant worship of the feet of the Exalted Guru.<br>
  Cruelty, material attachment, greed and anger are the four rivers of fire.<br>
  Falling into them, one is burned, O Nanak! One is saved only by holding tight to good deeds. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  While you are alive, conquer death, and you shall have no regrets in the end.<br>
  This world is false, but only a few understand this.<br>
  People do not enshrine love for the Truth; they chase after worldly affairs instead.<br>
  The terrible time of death and annihilation hovers over the heads of the world.<br>
  By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, the Messenger of Death smashes his club over their heads.<br>
  The Lord Himself gives His Love, and enshrines it within their minds.<br>
  Not a moment or an instant's delay is permitted, when one's measure of life is full.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one comes to know the True One, and is absorbed into Him. ||20||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Bitter melon, swallow-wort, thorn-apple and nim fruit<br>
  -these bitter poisons lodge in the minds and mouths of those who do not remember You.<br>
  O Nanak, how shall I tell them this? Without the karma of good deeds, they are only destroying themselves. ||1||<br>

  The intellect is a bird; on account of its actions, it is sometimes high, and sometimes low.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 055</h2></center>
  Sometimes it is perched on the sandalwood tree, and sometimes it is on the branch of the poisonous swallow-wort. Sometimes, it soars through the heavens.<br>
  O Nanak, our Lord and Master leads us on, according to the Hukam of His Command; such is His Way. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Some speak and expound, and while speaking and lecturing, they pass away.<br>
  The Vedas speak and expound on the Lord, but they do not know His limits.<br>
  Not by studying, but through understanding, is the Lord's Mystery revealed.<br>
  There are six pathways in the Shaastras, but how rare are those who merge in the True Lord through them.<br>
  The True Lord is Unknowable; through the Word of His Shabad, we are embellished.<br>
  One who believes in the Name of the Infinite Lord, attains the Court of the Lord.<br>
  I humbly bow to the Creator Lord; I am a minstrel singing His Praises.<br>
  Nanak enshrines the Lord within his mind. He is the One, throughout the ages. ||21||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  Those who charm scorpions and handle snakes only brand themselves with their own hands.<br>
  By the pre-ordained Order of our Lord and Master, they are beaten badly, and struck down.<br>
  If the self-willed manmukhs fight with the Gurmukh, they are condemned by the Lord, the True Judge.<br>
  He Himself is the Lord and Master of both worlds. He beholds all and makes the exact determination.<br>
  O Nanak, know this well: everything is in accordance with His Will. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, if someone judges himself, only then is he known as a real judge.<br>
  If someone understands both the disease and the medicine, only then is he a wise physician.<br>
  Do not involve yourself in idle business on the way; remember that you are only a guest here.<br>
  Speak with those who know the Primal Lord, and renounce your evil ways.<br>
  That virtuous person who does not walk in the way of greed, and who abides in Truth, is accepted and famous.<br>
  If an arrow is shot at the sky, how can it reach there?<br>
  The sky above is unreachable-know this well, O archer! ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The soul-bride loves her Husband Lord; she is embellished with His Love.<br>
  She worships Him day and night; she cannot be restrained from doing so.<br>
  In the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, she has made her home; she is adorned with the Word of His Shabad.<br>
  She is humble, and she offers her true and sincere prayer.<br>
  She is beautiful in the Company of her Lord and Master; she walks in the Way of His Will.<br>
  With her dear friends, she offers her heart-felt prayers to her Beloved.<br>
  Cursed is that home, and shameful is that life, which is without the Name of the Lord.<br>
  But she who is adorned with the Word of His Shabad, drinks in the Amrit of His Nectar. ||22||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  The desert is not satisfied by rain, and the fire is not quenched by desire.<br>
  The king is not satisfied with his kingdom, and the oceans are full, but still they thirst for more.<br>
  O Nanak, how many times must I seek and ask for the True Name? ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Life is useless, as long as one does not know the Lord God.<br>
  Only a few cross over the world-ocean, by Guru's Grace.<br>
  The Lord is the All-powerful Cause of causes, says Nanak after deep deliberation.<br>
  The creation is subject to the Creator, who sustains it by His Almighty Power. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  In the Court of the Lord and Master, His minstrels dwell.<br>
  Singing the Praises of their True Lord and Master, the lotuses of their hearts have blossomed forth.<br>
  Obtaining their Perfect Lord and Master, their minds are transfixed with ecstasy.<br>
  Their enemies have been driven out and subdued, and their friends are very pleased.<br>
  Those who serve the Truthful True Guru are shown the True Path.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 056</h2></center>
  Reflecting on the True Word of the Shabad, death is overcome.<br>
  Speaking the Unspoken Speech of the Lord, one is adorned with the Word of His Shabad.<br>
  Nanak holds tight to the Treasure of Virtue, and meets with the Dear, Beloved Lord. ||23||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Born because of the karma of their past mistakes, they make more mistakes, and fall into mistakes.<br>
  By washing, their pollution is not removed, even though they may wash hundreds of times.<br>
  O Nanak, if God forgives, they are forgiven; otherwise, they are kicked and beaten. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, it is absurd to ask to be spared from pain by begging for comfort.<br>
  Pleasure and pain are the two garments given, to be worn in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Where you are bound to lose by speaking, there, you ought to remain silent. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  After looking around in the four directions, I looked within my own self.<br>
  There, I saw the True, Invisible Lord Creator.<br>
  I was wandering in the wilderness, but now the Guru has shown me the Way.<br>
  Hail to the True, True Guru, through whom we merge in the Truth.<br>
  I have found the jewel within the home of my own self; the lamp within has been lit.<br>
  Those who praise the True Word of the Shabad, abide in the peace of Truth.<br>
  But those who do not have the Fear of God, are overtaken by fear. They are destroyed by their own pride.<br>
  Having forgotten the Name, the world is roaming around like a wild demon. ||24||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  In fear we are born, and in fear we die. Fear is always present in the mind.<br>
  O Nanak, if one dies in the fear of God, his coming into the world is blessed and approved. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Without the fear of God, you may live very, very long, and savor the most enjoyable pleasures.<br>
  O Nanak, if you die without the fear of God, you will arise and depart with a blackened face. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, then your desires will be fulfilled.<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, you will never grieve.<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, you will know no pain.<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, you will enjoy the Lord's Love.<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, then why should you fear death?<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, the body is always at peace.<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, the nine treasures are obtained.<br>
  When the True Guru is merciful, you shall be absorbed in the True Lord. ||25||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  They pluck the hair out of their heads, and drink in filthy water; they beg endlessly and eat the garbage which others have thrown away.<br>
  They spread manure, they suck in rotting smells, and they are afraid of clean water.<br>
  Their hands are smeared with ashes, and the hair on their heads is plucked out-they are like sheep!<br>
  They have renounced the lifestyle of their mothers and fathers, and their families and relatives cry out in distress.<br>
  No one offers the rice dishes at their last rites, and no one lights the lamps for them. After their death, where will they be sent?<br>
  The sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage give them no place of protection, and no Brahmin will eat their food.<br>
  They remain polluted forever, day and night; they do not apply the ceremonial tilak mark to their foreheads.<br>
  They sit together in silence, as if in mourning; they do not go to the Lord's Court.<br>
  With their begging bowls hanging from their waists, and their fly-brushes in their hands, they walk along in single file.<br>
  They are not Yogis, and they are not Jangams, followers of Shiva. They are not Qazis or Mullahs.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 06 - Raag Maajh - Part 057</h2></center>
  Ruined by the Merciful Lord, they wander around in disgrace, and their entire troop is contaminated.<br>
  The Lord alone kills and restores to life; no one else can protect anyone from Him.<br>
  They go without giving alms or any cleansing baths; their shaven heads become covered with dust.<br>
  The jewel emerged from the water, when the mountain of gold was used to churn it.<br>
  The gods established the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where the festivals are celebrated and hymns are chanted.<br>
  After bathing, the Muslims recite their prayers, and after bathing, the Hindus perform their worship services. The wise always take cleansing baths.<br>
  At the time of death, and at the time of birth, they are purified, when water is poured on their heads.<br>
  O Nanak, the shaven-headed ones are devils. They are not pleased to hear these words.<br>
  When it rains, there is happiness. Water is the key to all life.<br>
  When it rains, the corn grows, and the sugar cane, and the cotton, which provides clothing for all.<br>
  When it rains, the cows always have grass to graze upon, and housewives can churn the milk into butter.<br>
  With that ghee, sacred feasts and worship services are performed; all these efforts are blessed.<br>
  The Guru is the ocean, and all His Teachings are the river. Bathing within it, glorious greatness is obtained.<br>
  O Nanak, if the shaven-headed ones do not bathe, then seven handfuls of ashes are upon their heads. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  What can the cold do to the fire? How can the night affect the sun?<br>
  What can the darkness do to the moon? What can social status do to air and water?<br>
  What are personal possessions to the earth, from which all things are produced?<br>
  O Nanak, he alone is known as honorable, whose honor the Lord preserves. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  It is of You, O my True and Wondrous Lord, that I sing forever.<br>
  Yours is the True Court. All others are subject to coming and going.<br>
  Those who ask for the gift of the True Name are like You.<br>
  Your Command is True; we are adorned with the Word of Your Shabad.<br>
  Through faith and trust, we receive spiritual wisdom and meditation from You.<br>
  By Your Grace, the banner of honor is obtained. It cannot be taken away or lost.<br>
  You are the True Giver; You give continually. Your Gifts continue to increase.<br>
  Nanak begs for that gift which is pleasing to You. ||26||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  Those who have accepted the Guru's Teachings, and who have found the path, remain absorbed in the Praises of the True Lord.<br>
  What teachings can be imparted to those who have the Divine Guru Nanak as their Guru? ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  We understand the Lord only when He Himself inspires us to understand Him.<br>
  He alone knows everything, unto whom the Lord Himself gives knowledge.<br>
  One may talk and preach and give sermons but still yearn after Maya.<br>
  The Lord, by the Hukam of His Command, has created the entire creation.<br>
  He Himself knows the inner nature of all.<br>
  O Nanak, He Himself uttered the Word.<br>
  Doubt departs from one who receives this gift. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  I was a minstrel, out of work, when the Lord took me into His service.<br>
  To sing His Praises day and night, He gave me His Order, right from the start.<br>
  My Lord and Master has summoned me, His minstrel, to the True Mansion of His Presence.<br>
  He has dressed me in the robes of His True Praise and Glory.<br>
  The Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name has become my food.<br>
  Those who follow the Guru's Teachings, who eat this food and are satisfied, find peace.<br>
  His minstrel spreads His Glory, singing and vibrating the Word of His Shabad.<br>
  O Nanak, praising the True Lord, I have obtained His Perfection. ||27||SUDH||<br>
