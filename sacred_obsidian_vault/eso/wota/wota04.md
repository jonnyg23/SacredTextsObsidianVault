 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Purple</span> and gold are the mountains of Sebas-thā-ontu; above hang wavy billows of golden fleece; for he that giveth life to all terrestrial things, mighty Thā, sleeps in the Chamber of the West.</p>  
 <p>The valleys are filled with purple mists and gloom, for the arrows of Thā no longer speed on their course.</p>  
 <p>The night winds laden with the heavy perfume of a thousand plants soothe the restless breast of man, and seal down his eyelids with a kiss.</p>  
 <p>Sleep, the shadow of death, is abroad in the land, and all is quiet, save the shrill note of the night bird and the voices of innumerable insects.</p>  
 <p>Behold the grandeur of the heavens! The</p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>crown that Omn wears sparkling with innumerable gems.</p>  
 <p>The soul is filled with awe and reverence at the majesty of the scene.</p>  
 <p>All that the natural eye beholds pales into insignificance before the illimitable depths and numberless globes of amethyst, purple and gold that burst upon the bewildered vision of the spirit.</p>  
 <p>Who made these chariots of fire that circle forever the throne of the Infinite One?</p>  
 <p>Ever on and on! from chaos to nebulæ,from nebulæ to suns, from suns to worlds!</p>  
 <p>Who the mighty Sculptor that shaped the endless variety of forms?</p>  
 <p>Who the mighty Artist with brush dipped in molten colors made the heavens shine with new lights unknown before?</p>  
 <p>What mighty Musician gave to each star and sun its keynote, and made the heavens</p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>vocal with a new song voicing the majesty and glory of the One, Everlasting Omn?</p>  
 <p>The Heavens give answer: Our Creator is Spirit.</p>  
 <p>Archangels are the servants of Omn. They, the framers and builders of universes. They, the sculptors, artists, musicians, incomparable.</p>  
 <p>In their hands chaos assumes form. The lightnings are their playthings. All the mighty and subtle forces obey the mandates of their wills.</p>  
 <p>They make the pathways for circling spheres of fire. They determine when worlds shall be born out of these spheres, and shape and fashion them into things of exquisite beauty.</p>  
 <p>Their work completed, angels of light are placed over them and become the masters of their destiny.</p>  
 <p>Innumerable spirits do the biddings of these</p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>angels. And thus from angels to spirits, and from spirits to man terrestrial, throbs and beats forever the Life that is that of the Eternal One.</p>  
 <p>One Life in all and through all! One purpose, that of the Divine Will, pulsates in every atom, making through all a most perfect undertone of harmony.</p>  
 <p>Purple and gold are the mountains of Sebas-thā-ontu, as the shades of evening settle over the earth. Peace, sweet peace, spreads her wings over all, and the questioning spirit of man rests ere it takes again its upward flight.</p>
