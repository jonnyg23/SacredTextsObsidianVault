 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I call</span> no one great, unless I call all great.</p>  
 <p>Each fills his place in the great plan of Omn.</p>  
 <p>Each has come at his own time.</p>  
 <p>Some have travelled farther than others, have seen more, have heard more, have lived more than others.</p>  
 <p>And some who have seen much and heard much may not yet have been aroused so that they can comprehend the meaning of all that has been.</p>  
 <p>Not all that is within thee has yet been lived. For thou encirclest all things.</p>  
 <p>I condemn not the thief, the murderer, the adulterer, no more than I condemn the wild beast for its ferocity.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thou shalt outgrow all things, poor troubled soul.</p>  
 <p>Are these things committed against thee, my brother? I grieve with thee, but I pity thee not. Rise above all annoyances; it is possible for thee to ascend where these things shall trouble thee no more.</p>  
 <p>I have come up through the ages, uncounted and untold. On many of the stars thou wilt find the imprint of my feet. Rest upon me ages and ages.</p>  
 <p>Still on! presses my indomitable and restless spirit.</p>  
 <p>Long have been my sleeps, yet longer by far have been my awakenings.</p>  
 <p>The memory of all, dim and illusive, save at the quickening of the spirit, is never present with me.</p>  
 <p>From the star-depths stretch the great all-powerful arms that have upheld me!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>For my coming great indeed have been the preparations.</p>  
 <p>From star-dust to blazing sun all have labored for me.</p>  
 <p>Tenderly all have cared for me,the erratic comet has smiled upon me, and great stars have given me their protecting love.</p>  
 <p>Room has always been made for me throughout all my journeyings.</p>  
 <p>Rocked in the cradle of the universe the stars have sung my infant soul to sleep.</p>  
 <p>Yet was that soul a child only in its expression, for countless cycles even then were its own.</p>  
 <p>On, ever on, has been its swift flight. And, as thou hast journeyed, angels and archangels have called unto thee from out the depths.</p>  
 <p>I am the unmeasured, bent on an endless journey.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>Try not to follow me, for do thy best to keep my track, I shall ever elude thee.</p>  
 <p>Blaze out, oh, brother soul, among the stars and nebulæ thine own path.</p>  
 <p>I shall lead thee, but it shall be unto thyself.</p>  
 <p>I shall point the way, but it shall ever be unto thine own path.</p>  
 <p>See, the mountain heights, purple-misted and indistinct in the distance, they stand ready and waiting for thy feet to sink deep within their virgin soil.</p>  
 <p>Make delays if thou wilt, yet sooner or later thou shalt reach their summits, and thy soul exalted shall know the meaning of the thirst unquenched and the hunger unappeased.</p>
