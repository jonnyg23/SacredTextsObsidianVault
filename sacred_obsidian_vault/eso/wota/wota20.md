 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Illuminated One is he whose spiritual faculties have all been quickened. This the one whose illumination is perfect. Of course there are many degrees of illumination.</p>  
 <p>One faculty may be quickened into newer and higher life while all the others remain in their natural or in a dormant condition.</p>  
 <p>But when I say Illuminated One, I mean one whose faculties have been exalted or quickened.</p>  
 <p>He, truly, is an <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Avatar</span>, for all knowledge is placed at his disposal.</p>  
 <p>Memory opens to him the door of all experiences in past embodiments.</p>  
 <p>Oft-times he uses knowledge that has been brought from afar.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>Think not that all the knowledge revealed through illuminated ones was acquired either in one embodiment, or while attached to one world.</p>  
 <p>Spirit calls no world home, but has been a traveller from remotest time along an infinite journey.</p>  
 <p>Yet, caprice and fancy play no part in these wanderings.</p>  
 <p>Law controls all things, and order reigns throughout all universes.</p>  
 <p>The life that is is willed to be by Higher Powers.</p>  
 <p>What if some say, This is the only life, the first and last incarnation?</p>  
 <p>Do not stop to dispute with them. Thou canst not make them see as thou seest.</p>  
 <p>Wait, and they will grow to thy thought.</p>  
 <p>But keep not thy thought to thyself. Utter it in world language and it shall vibrate on</p>  
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p>and through the world until all prejudice shall be overcome, and souls shall become responsive to its harmonious notes.</p>  
 <p>Study thine own soul, ponder well its lessons, before thou art ready to accept the lessons that others may offer.</p>  
 <p>If thou art illuminated, thou wilt assimilate the food thy soul needs.</p>  
 <p>Give raiment, material food and shelter to the physical body, but give the soul unmeasured love and knowledge.</p>  
 <p>Open all the storehouses of Nature and wrench from her her time-honored secrets, ransack the universe if thou wilt in search of new truths, but if thou wilt only be patient and wait, these shall all come to thee.</p>  
 <p>For the soul knows its own and draws all things it wishes unto itself.</p>  
 <p>Be ye content with fewer things in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a></p>  
 <p>external world, and seek to draw unto thee the higher ideals of the spirit.</p>  
 <p>But despise not the means that leadeth to the coveted end.</p>  
 <p>Perform the duties of every-day life uncomplainingly, for these may be made the stepping stones to true spiritual growth.</p>
