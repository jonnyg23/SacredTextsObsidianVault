 <p>I. God is Love.</p>  
 <p>Man, having the understanding of God, speaks the Word of Power.</p>  
 <p>2. Man gives utterance to God.</p>  
 <p>3. The Father is Equilibrium.</p>  
 <p>The Son is Concentration of the same Spirit. The Spirit is Projection.</p>  
 <p><i>The Tri-une Relation</i>--always consists of these Three:</p>  
 <p>(I) The Potential--(II) The Ideal--(III) The Concrete.</p>  
 <p>(I) The Potential is Life in its most highly abstract mode not yet brought into Form even as Thought. Not particularised in any way.</p>  
 <p>(II) The Ideal is the particularising of the Potential into a certain Formulated Thought.</p>

 <p>The Ultimate Truth will always be found to consist of these three, and anything that is contrary to them is contrary to Fundamental Truth.</p>  
 <p align="center">WORSHIP</p>
