 <p><font size="-1">Resolution passed October, 1902, by the Kensington Higher Thought Centre.</font></p>  
 <p>"<i>That the Centre stands for the definite teaching of absolute Oneness of Creator and Creation--Cause and Effect--and that nothing which may contradict or be in opposition to the above principles be admitted to the 'Higher Thought' Centre Platform</i>.</p>  
 <p>"<i>By Oneness of Cause and Effect is meant, that Effect (man) does consist only of what Cause is; but a part (individual personality) is not therefore co-extensive with the whole</i>."</p>  
 <p>THIS Resolution is of the greatest importance. Once admit that there is any Power outside yourself, however beneficent you may conceive it to be, and you have sown the seed which must sooner or later bear the fruit of "<i>Fear</i>" which is the entire ruin of Life, Love and Liberty. There is no <i>via media</i>. Say we are only reflections, however accurate, of The Life, and in the admission we have given away our Birthright.

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Life Itself, it must spring up to the ultimate ruin of the Life-Principle itself. We <i>are</i> It itself. The difference is only that between the generic and the specific of the <i>same</i> thing. We must contend earnestly, both within ourselves and outwardly, for the <i>one great foundation</i> and never, now on to all eternity, admit for a single instant any thought which is opposed to this, the Basic Truth of Being.</p>  
 <p>The leading ideas connected with Higher Thought are (I) That Man controls circumstances, instead of being controlled by them, and (II) as a consequence of the foregoing, that whatever teaches us to <i>rely</i> on power <i>borrowed</i> from a source <i>outside</i> ourselves is <i>not</i> Higher Thought; and that whatever explains to us the <i>Infinite</i> source of our <i>own inherent power</i> and the consequent <i>limitless</i> nature of that power <i>is</i> Higher Thought. This avoids the use of terms which may only puzzle those not accustomed to abstract phraseology, and is substantially the same as the resolution of October, 1902.</p>
