 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Hidden Power, by Thomas Troward [1921], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h1 align="center">PUBLISHER'S NOTE</h1>  
 <p>The material comprised in this volume has been selected from unpublished manuscripts and magazine articles by Judge Troward, and "The Hidden Power" is, it is believed, the last book which will be published under his name. Only an insignificant portion of his work has been deemed unworthy of permanent preservation. Whenever possible, dates have been affixed to these papers. Those published in 1902 appeared originally in "EXPRESSION; A Journal of Mind and Thought," in London, and to some of these have been added notes made later by the author.</p>  
 <p>The Publishers wish to acknowledge their indebtedness to Mr. Daniel M. Murphy of New York for his services in the selection and arrangement of the material.</p>
