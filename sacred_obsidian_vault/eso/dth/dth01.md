 <p>Do not worry because you cannot follow the course exactly to the letter. Do what you can of it, adapt it to your life, and do the best you can in present circumstances.</p>  
 <p>The principal thing is to get twice daily into what is called the Silence, to quieten the senses, and get in touch with the Unseen, i.e., God, Divine Mind, the Infinite, Principle of Good, First Cause, the Absolute, the name does not matter, they all mean the same.</p>  
 <p>Another vital thing is to use affirmations and denials, these will be explained more fully later.</p>  
 <p>Yet another is meditation, for you gradually grow into the likeness of that upon which you meditate.</p>  
 <p>Still another is visualizing. Always visualize the good, the beautiful, and true, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>  
 <p>your life will reflect these things. Incidentally, the practice of visualization greatly increases one's powers of concentration.</p>  
 <p>Also while you are receiving this course and for some time after, refrain from all hazardous speculation. Do not launch out in business without sufficient capital and then expect everything to turn out all right. Instead wait until the way is made clear. Guidance and help will come in time, therefore do not try to force things.</p>  
 <p>Remember that although as soon as you start right thinking, you begin to build up your life, yet it takes time to manifest. At first things may seem to be worse, if so keep on and they will soon settle down. You cannot fail in the long run if you will persist and persevere.</p>
