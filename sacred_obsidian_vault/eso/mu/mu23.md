 <p><b>All that has been said in this "explanatory" bulletin regarding the program of The International Institute of Universal Research and Administration, would be of no avail were it not "acted upon."</b></p>  
 <p><b>Unless those who have read our proclamation decide to "personally co-operate" in the promulgation of this message, they might just as well have not read it at all. Words "without actions" are like rooms without lightsthey may be "veritable treasure houses"and yet if no hand were reached out to make use of the treasures(by turning on the lights and discovering their true value)in other words, by acting upon the knowledge of the "availability" of such treasures as our words have described,there would be no reason for having written them.</b></p>  
 <p>Were it not that the "actions" we recommend for the formation of an organization large enough to accomplish the result we have herein described, would require but little more energy than that which you might use in reaching out your hand and pressing an electric light button in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 300</font></a></p>  
 <p>some "treasure room" into which you had been led, there might be some slight justification for hesitancy or procrastination. However, the only steps you are asked to take, consist in placing four (4) or more copies of this "Explanatory" bulletin in circulation by lending them to your many friends and acquaintances.</p>  
 <p>Only such action on the part of many millions of men and women"and without delay"can possibly bring about the formation of a group of people sufficiently large to combat the ceaselessly growing menacenot only of Communismbut also that of another great world war; a war, the successful consummation of which will bring about the establishment of a type of human slavery so terrifying that words cannot even start to describe it.</p>  
 <p>The responsibility of preventing the fulfillment of the plans of our world's incalculably wealthy Hidden Rulers, belongs as much to one as to another, and yet(if the world's "right-thinking" inhabitants are willing to act as a body and do as did the Children of Israelin their march around the walls of Jerichoand they willwith <b>"one voice"</b>demand that these subversive forces be forever uprooted, and that an economic system be founded upon the "Literal Signification" as well as the "Spiritual Principle" of Christ Jesus Golden Rule)such a result can be quickly brought to pass,and with but little individual effort.</p>  
 <p><b>If you value the safety and happiness of your loved onesas well as your own securityyou will not only "act" upon the recommendations contained on the last</b></p>  
 <p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a></p>  
 <p><b>page of this book, but you will do it "Today," while this subject is fresh in your thought, and before numerous responsibilities or demands upon your time cause you to postpone such "needed" action.</b></p>  
 <p><b>WE STILL HAVE THE PRIVILEGES OF "FREE SPEECH" AND "THE RIGHTS OF ASSEMBLY" IN BUT A FEW OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NATIONS. HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHAT WE THINK, AND THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH OUR FELLOW BEINGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIGHTING ANY WRONGS UNDER WHICH WE MAY BE SUFFERING, WILL STILL BE GRANTED TO USIN VIEW OF THE GROWTH OF COMMUNISM AND DICTATORSHIPSNO ONE KNOWS. BUT "TODAY" IS YOURS!AND AT "THIS MINUTE""NOW!"WHILE YOU ARE READING THIS BOOK, YOU STILL HAVE THOSE PRIVILEGES. DO NOT DEPRECIATE THEIR IMPORTANCE, NOR BE DECEIVED INTO THINKING THAT THEY WILL ENDURE IN SPITE OF THE UNDERMINING INFLUENCE OF THE "ATHEISTIC TERMITES" OF COMMUNISM AND FASCISMSELFISHNESSGREEDBRUTALITYAND THE MAD AMBITION OF THE FABULOUSLY WEALTHY "MORAL IDIOTS" WHO NOW CONTROL THE WORLD'S MAJOR FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL STRUCTURES! DO NOT BE DECEIVED INTO BELIEVING THAT SUCH RIGHTS WILL EXIST WITHOUT "YOUR HELP" AND THE WEIGHT OF "YOUR INFLUENCE," (EVEN THOUGH IT MAY SEEM TO BE EVER SO SLIGHT IN YOUR OWN EYES.) FOR</b></p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <b>SUCH IS NOT THE CASE! ALREADY THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY LOST!!!</b></p>  
 <p><b>THERE ARE BUT FEW PILLARS UPHOLDING THE LIBERTIES OF FREE MEN, THAT HAVE NOT ALREADY BEEN GNAWED THROUGHOR ROTTED OUT AT THEIR VERY CORESBY THE POISONOUS ATHEISTIC TEACHINGS OF THE WORLD'S TENS OF MILLIONS OF COMMUNISTS AND FASCISTS;ATHEISTS WHO TEACH "THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN" WHEN THEY SEEK NEW RECRUITS FOR THEIR RANKS, YET WHOSE LEADERS LIVE THE LIVES OF "RAVENOUS WOLVES," AND PRACTICE THE BRUTALITIES OF THE DARK AGES, AS SOON AS THEY HAVE PLACED THEIR VICTIMS COMPLETELY UNDER THEIR DESPOTIC CONTROL.</b></p>  
 <p><b>Only "your help"combined with millions of other clear-thinking men and womencan prevent civilization's final overthrow by these forces!!! Only the establishment of an economic system based upon the irrevocable principle of "Universal Economic Equality,"as preachednot by the Communists and Fascistsbut by "Christ Jesus"(when He promised us that the Kingdom of Heaven was "at hand," and its limitless joys available for our happiness whenever we would practice His Golden Rule, and "equally share" the world's bounty with our fellowmen)can ever destroy the "humanly planned" and "humanly perpetuated" causes of world-wide illiteracy, poverty, and war.</b></p>  
 <p>It is imperative that you raise your voice"now"in behalf of the establishment of such an economic system,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p>while you are still allowed to speak your thoughts and to meet with your brother-man for discussions regarding them. Your help is greatly needed if we are to maintainand perpetually retainsuch rights. You possess these rights today, but no one on this earth can promise that you will still be granted them tomorrow. We therefore feel fully justified in appealing to you for your co-operation, and in warning you against procrastinating. <b>We not only invite you to act upon the recommendations contained herein, but it would not be possible for us to "too strongly" impress upon your thought, the urgency of acting "today!"</b></p>

 <p><b>IIf you believe that the world has enough efficient executives, highly trained workers and mechanical inventions, and that it has sufficient undeveloped resources with which to end both poverty and war;if(knowing that the world has over one hundred (100) times more agricultural land than has ever been intensively cultivated)you are willing to permit such undeveloped lands to be made use of to produce the food with which to feed "the entire human race;"</b></p>  
 <p><b>IIIf you do not object to voting in favor of granting five hundred million (500,000,000) of the present "unemployed" inhabitants of our earth the right to keep from "starving to death," and if you do not object to allowing them to exchange their labor for food, by creating and maintaining tens of thousands of miles of broad tree-lined highwaysconstructing greatly</b></p>

 <p><b>IIIIf you are willing to permit the world's hundreds of millions of intelligent, talented, and highly capable unemployed men and women to regain their morale, and to earn their financial independence by turning our earth into a literal paradise of beauty and security for the entire human race;</b></p>  
 <p><b>IVIf you do not object to having the talents and efforts of such people directed not only for the accomplishment of the above described results, but also combined with the rest of the world's trained workers to provide a beautiful, substantial, and well-furnished home(set in beautifully landscaped grounds)for every family on our earth"within less than ten years"irrespective of race, religion, class, color or vocation,and subject only to the willingness of the Corporation's "co-owner" employees to learn how to useenjoyand protect such possessions as are made available to them;</b></p>
