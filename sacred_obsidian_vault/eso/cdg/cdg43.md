 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_FF">FF</a></font></span>In Athanasius' " Life of St. Antony," at the words, "the weapons which are 'in the navel of his belly,'" <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">*</font></a> reference is made to the parallel passage in Job xl, 16, where the Lord says of Behemoth, "his force is in the navel of his belly," and it is stated that "the descriptions of behemoth and leviathan are allegorically referred to Satan." Therefore we hope to give some clue to the identity of Behemoth and Leviathan, what they are, and how they manifest.</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">This verse states that man may become his own saviour, affording a key to the allegory which follows.</div>  
 <p>15. Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;</p>

 <p>he eateth grass as an ox.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Grass here signifies the flesh or carnal nature. "All flesh is grass." <small>ISAIAH xl, 6.</small> The ox is an unsexed animal, hence "he eateth grass as an ox" is equivalent to saying that Behe moth (the vital energy) can, or was intended to, consume the carnal nature of man by manifesting unsexed; for regeneration as opposed to ungoverned sex expression or generation.</div>  
 <p>16. Lo now, his strength is in his loins,</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Loins in Hebrew as in Greek is used as a euphemism for the organs of generation. During the present cycle of evolution the strength or power of the Solar Force <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">*</font></a> is manifesting in sex expression.</div>  
 <p>and his force is in the navel of his belly.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"The shining, vital energy which is the manifestation of life . . . is sleeping like a serpent, having three and a half coils." <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">§</font></a> The first stirring or uncoiling of this force prior to its passage through and energising of the ganglia of the sympathetic system manifests in the abdomen in the region of the navel. In chapter xxxii, 18, 19; 8, of the Book of Job, the Initiate Elihu describes this stirring</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">of the vital energy or Solar Force when speaking under divine inspiration, "the spirit of my belly constraineth me, Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. I will speak, that I may be refreshed, but there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding."</div>  
 <p>18. His bones are pipes of copper; his bones are like tubes of iron. <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">†</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The bones of Behemoth are the net work of nerves which are the channels of the Solar Force. Prior to Initiation these nerves are in the atrophied or, relatively speaking, hardened state here typified as copper and iron. In Sanskrit writings these channels are similarly termed pipes or tubes (nadis). The Uttara Gita states that these nadis "are like pipes, are hollow and in this space there exists a certain substance, like oil, in which the Chaitanya (Divine Energy) reflects." <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">§</font></a> In the fourth chapter of Zechariah the word "pipes" is used in this sense. "And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick (the spine) all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it," ("The golden bowl is the</div>

 <p>"And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil" (namely the nerve fluid in which the radiance of the Solar Force is reflected or manifested). <small>ZECHARIAH iv, 2, 12</small>.</p></div>  
 <p>19. He is chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Behemoth is the chief manifestation to man of Nature, God. The God in man can govern Behemoth. The sword is the symbol of authority, government and the Great Law of Nature, God.</div>  
 <p>20. Surely the mountains bring him forth food,</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">In sacred writings the word 'mountain' is often used to signify those higher levels of consciousness wherein the Seeker attains to communion with God, and the Divine Self is able to instruct the man through the instrument of the mind. Thus Moses went up into the mount to receive the Law: and Isaiah foretells that spiritual enlightenment</div>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">which is the destiny of the race in these words, "And in this mountain (the higher consciousness) shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast,--And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the wail (of forgetfulness) that is spread over all nations. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest." <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">*</font></a> The Divine Principle manifesting in the higher consciousness of man shall bring him into harmony with the Law of Nature, God.</div>  
 <p>20. where all the beasts of the field play.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Presumably a reference to those streams of consciousness or Divine Force playing through the signs of the Zodiac known as the ram, bull, and goat--of which the spirit of man when functioning in the mountain or higher states of consciousness is aware, and from which he can gain knowledge of of the government of Behemoth.</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The eyes of Behemoth are the seven principal ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system. " Those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord," Zechariah, iv, 10. Man works out his own salvation through the awakening of these centres.</div>  
 <p>24. his nose pierceth through snares.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Already the Solar Force seeks to manifest in upward direction for the regeneration of man and the race, though ensnared by the baser inclinations and ignorance.</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The word Leviathan in Hebrew is made up of two roots, Levi and Than. "ThN, Than, which is the root of Serpent or Dragon. <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">1</font></a> Than will be the symbol of transgression, but a symbol also of influence and of power." <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">2</font></a> Since the root meaning of Than is serpent, Leviathan means literally the Than or serpent of Levi. Of this word Levi "The root, we may suppose, describes the coils of the serpent, perhaps the metallic gleam of its scales." <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">3</font></a> For Levi was the serpent tribe, bred for generations to the knowledge and control of the World Serpent, Solar Force. <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">*</font></a> Leviathan or the Serpent of Levi signifies the Solar Force governed and direted upward through the spine by the priests of the tribe of Levi for regeneration, the upbuilding of the deathless Solar Body. <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">†</font></a> Accurately speaking, Leviathan is the Solar Force manifesting in the cerebrospinal nervous system after its passage through the ganglia of the sympathetic system.</div>

 <p>5. or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">substantiates this statement. For it is only after the upward passage of the Solar Force through the spine that the tongue of Leviathan can be drawn out. When the Solar Force is directed upward it passes through an opening in the top of the head called by the Brahmins the "door of Brahma," and by the first Christians the "door of Jesus," and is visible to the seer as a tongue of brilliant flame.  
 <p>The following verses make reference to the various temptations which beset Job, overcoming of which mark different degrees in his Initiation.</p></div>  
 <p>3. Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Will you even now be tempted to misapply this force? The current would descend if possible, for it becomes either a regenerator or a destroyer, intensifying the lower nature.</div>  
 <p>5. or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Until a man is able so to govern his lower nature, mind, and body as to express his higher or Divine Self in sex relationship he has not passed that stage in the evolution of his Godhood typified in ancient myths as</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">the slaying of the lion or dragon. <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">*</font></a> Samson slew the lion after his lower nature had been roused by his love for a daughter of the Philistines. And Hercules overcame the Nemean lion after the fifty daughters of King Thespius had been given him as wives. This verse alludes to a definite degree of Initiation, an experience wherein the passions are overcome by a manifestation of the God in man.</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The word "Dag" or "the Fish" is frequently used in the Talmud for the Messiah or regenerative spiritual force. When man becomes his own saviour this force passes upward to the brain, where its currents unite for the perfecting of the Solar or spiritual body. The cabin of fishes would seem to</div>

 <p>8. Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">These words indicate that Leviathan is a conquered or governed force; indeed, Leviathan is Behemoth governed and augmented. The battle or test referred to is supreme and terrible. Plato says in the Phaedrus, "But whenever one who is fresh from those mysteries" beholds beauty of face and form "he first of all feels a shuddering chill, and there creep over him some of those terrors that assailed him in that dire struggle." In the elder Edda, that voice of the ancient religions of the north, this degree of Initiation is described as follows: "Comes forth the glorious offspring of Earth, Thor, to strive with the glistening Serpent. . . . Lone Serpent-slayer, and Shield of Men, he baited his hook with the head of the ox, and he whom the gods hate gaped thereat,</div>

His hammer he lifted and struck from on high the fearful head. . . . Moaned the wild monster, the rocks all rumbled, the ancient earth shrank into itself. . . . Then sank the serpent down in the deep."

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">None is so fierce that dare stir him up:--meaning Leviathan or the Solar Force governed, who then is able to stand before me, the Architet of the Universe, and before my manifestation the Super Solar Force?</div>  
 <p>11. Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Repay is here used in the Hebrew with the sense of "give an equivalent for." What has prevented the substitution of the Super Solar Force for the Solar Force, of immortality for mortality?</div>  
 <p><a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">PART II.</h3>  
 <p>At this point the allegory changes in character. Hitherto Leviathan or the Initiatory Force has been described figuratively and somewhat ambiguously. Henceforward the writer intends to make a more explicit and unmistakeable revelation of his meaning.</p>  
 <p>12. I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</p>  
 <p>13. Who can strip off his outer garment?</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The outer garment of Leviathan is the voltage of Solar Force manifesting in the sympathetic nervous system. Who can replace this by the voltage necessary to open. and perfect the centres of the cerebro-spinal system?</div>  
 <p>13. or who can come to him with his double bridle?</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">After passing through the centres of the sympathetic nervous system, the positive and negative currents of Solar Force meet in the forehead where, as it were, their balance registers; so that at this degree of evolution the Initiate can sense whether the balance is perfedf, or whether positive or negative current predominates. This power to sense and govern the currents is hère called the double bridle of Leviathan. <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">†</font></a> And the Adept Kings of Egypt bore upon their</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">foreheads the uraeus, or sacred serpent, emblem of this bridle, to signify that they had achieved this power. Hence "The Chaldee Paraphrase understands 'leviathan that piercing serpent' to refer to Pharaoh." (<small><i>Isaiah xxvii, 1</i>,</small>) Leviathan is also thought to personify the King of Egypt in Psalm lxxiv, 14, "Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gayest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness," meaning that Moses transmitted as meat to the children of Israel knowledge of the Serpent Fire or Solar Force, hitherto the prerogative of Egypt's Adept Kings and their priests:</div>  
 <p>15. His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The word translated scales has the literal meaning in Hebrew of 'strong pieces of shields,' and is used to designate the ganglia which "are shut up together as with a close seal" prior to Initiation. The word seal is used similarly in the Apocalypse when St. John says of the seven principal ganglia of the sympathetic system, "I saw when the Lamb (the immortal mind) opened one of the seven seals." <small>REVELATION vi, 1</small>.</div>  
 <p>18. By his neesings a light doth shine,</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The neesings of Leviathan characterise what</div>  
 <p><a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a></p>  
 <p>may be described as the whisking of the Solar Force through and about the Initiate which at every pronounced increase of voltage causes greater illumination, to the seer, actually visible as light. See <a href="cdg00.htm#img_front">Frontispiece</a>.</p>  
 <p>21. His breath kindleth coals,</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The Divine Energy or Fire <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">*</font></a> enkindles the ganglia. Or this verse may be taken literally, for when the Solar Force has reached and energised a certain ganglion the Initiate is able to enkindle substances by directing the Solar Force upon them through the medium of the breath.</div>  
 <p>22. and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The suffering experienced in the physical body during the period when the centres are energised is transmuted into the joy of divine realisation.</div>
