 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_DDD">DDD</a></font></span>The following definition of the Sabbat is translated from the "Dictionnaire Infernal" by Collins de Plancy, and is cited as a typical example of those imbecilities which the Comte deprecates.</p>  
 <p>"The Sabbat is the assembly of devils, sorcerers and witches in their nocturnal orgies. Usually they are there engaged in doing or in plotting evil, in causing fear or terror, in preparing witchcraft and abominable mysteries. The Sabbat is held at a place where several roads cross, or in some deserted and wild spot near a lake, pool, or marsh, because hailstorms are there made and tempests manufactured."</p>
