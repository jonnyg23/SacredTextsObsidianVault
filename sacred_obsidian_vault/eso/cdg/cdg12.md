When man, by discipline of the mind, is able to shut off all sense perception, he becomes conscious of an ever-vibrating rhythmic throb or pulsation which manifests as a distinct and audible sound. As the earth and planets . have each their own note or sound vibration, this pulse of the universe creates a respondent chord from the spheres. When the different planets approach the earth their respective notes are apparent to the consciousness of the Adept as distinct tones predominant in the Harmony of the World.</p>
