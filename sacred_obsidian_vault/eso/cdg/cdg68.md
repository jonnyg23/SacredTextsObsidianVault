He was greatly in favour with the Emperor Charles the Bald, whose medical attendant he had been. He is said, further more, to have been so great a wizard that once in the presence of the court he ate a whole load of hay, together with the driver and the horses; that at other times he flew around in the air and played other such juggling tricks. <small>TRANSLATED FROM ZEDLER, UNIVERSAL LEXICON.</small></p>
