 <p>The Moslem   world acknowledges and reverences the divine mission of Jesus, "And to   Jesus, son of Mary, gave we clear proofs <i>of   his mission</i>, and strengthened him by the Holy Spirit," (Koran Sura   2,) and holds that he was miraculously born. A statement of this belief is to   he found in the Koran Sura 19.</p>   
 <p>"And make   mention in the Book, of Mary, when she went apart from her family, eastward,</p>   
 <p>And took a veil   to shroud herself from them: and we sent our spirit to her, and he took   before her the form of a perfect man.</p>   
 <p>She said: 'I   fly for refuge from thee to the God of Mercy I If thou fearest Him, begone   from me.'</p>   
 <p>He said: 'I am   only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a holy son.'</p>   
 <p>She said: 'How   shall I have a son, when man bath never touched me? and I am not unchaste.'</p>   
 <p>He said: 'So   shall it be. Thy Lord path said 'Easy is this with me;' and we will make him   a sign to mankind, and a mercy from us. For if is a thing decreed.'</p>   
 <p>And she   conceived him, and retired with him to a far-off place.</p>

 <p>This is Jesus,   the son of Mary; this is a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt</p>   
 <p>It beseemeth   not God to beget a son. Glory he to Him! When he decreeth a thing, He only   saith to it,</p>   
 <p align="center">Be, and it IS."</p>
