 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_GGG">GGG</a></font></span>A few years ago a certain folly was spread abroad. There had been a great mortality among cattle; and it was said that Grimaldus, Duke of Beneventum, had sent men with powders to scatter over fields, mountains, meadows and springs, for the reason that he was an enemy to the most Christian Emperor Charles, and that the cattle had died by this same powder. For this cause many were arrested, as we heard and indeed saw; some were killed, most fastened to boards, thrown into the river, and so sent to death. And what is highly astonishing, the persons arrested testified against themselves, stating that they had had such a powder and had scattered it. <small>AGOBARDUS, LIBER DE GRANDINE ET TONITRUIS, CAP. xvi.</small></p>
