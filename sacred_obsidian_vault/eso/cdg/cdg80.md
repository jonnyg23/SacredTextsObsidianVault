 <p><i>And we will bring up a witness out of every nation</i> and say, 'Bring your proofs.' And they shall know that the truth is with God alone, and the gods of their own devising shall desert them.</p>  
 <p>3. And thou shalt see every nation KNEELING <i>to its own book shall every nation be summoned</i>:"</p>
