 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_S">S</a></font></span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. Then said Saul unto his servants, "Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her." And his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor." And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went. Then said the woman, "Whom shall I bring up unto thee?" And he said, "Bring me up Samuel." And Samuel said to Saul, "Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?" And Saul answered, "I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do." Then said Samuel, "Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines."</p>
