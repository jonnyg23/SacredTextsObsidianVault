 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Science of Mind, by Ernest Shurtleff Holmes [1926], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">THE SEQUENCE OF THE CREATIVE ORDER</h3>  
 <p>In the creation of any form it is necessary for its image to exist in Mind before it can come into realization in the external. The Law, being only a neutral force, cannot initiate anything, and cannot, of Itself, choose to create anything. It is a Doer only, not a Knower. The Word alone knows; so we may assume that each word is a law unto itself, through the One great Law of all Life.</p>
