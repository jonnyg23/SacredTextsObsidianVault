 <p>The Garden of Eden typifies man's original state of perfection before he began to have experience. The Tree of Knowledge means the Life Principle which can be used both ways. It bore the fruit of the knowledge of both kinds of experience, good and evil, freedom and limitation. Man must choose which kind of fruit he will eat. "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve." <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">101</font></a> Man makes his choice consciously but generally in ignorance. The serpent typifies the Life Principle viewed from the materialistic viewpoint; it casts man from his perfect state through his belief in duality and separation. Man chose to depart from Good, and man alone must choose to return to It. God lets him alone; for he is a free agent and may do as he wills with himself. When man decides to return to his Father's House, he will find that his Father is still there. "Act as though I am and I will be." "Onlook the Deity and the Deity will onlook thee." "Be firm and ye shall be made firm." "As though hast believed so be it done unto thee." <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">102</font></a> "Ask and it shall be given unto you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you." <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">103</font></a> God's Creation is Perfect and we must wake to the fact and know that we are now in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
