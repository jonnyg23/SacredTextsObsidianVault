 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>COME, AND LET ME HEAL YOU</b></p>  
 <p>Come to me and I will heal you.<br> The inner power of Life within me is God, and it can heal anything.<br> I will to heal and help all who come to me.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a></p>  
 <p>I know that the realization of Life and Love within me heals all who come into Its presence.<br> I love the thought that I silently bless all who enter my atmosphere.<br> It is not I, but The Father Who dwelleth in me; He doeth the works.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I heal all who come near me</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>HE IS MIGHTY WITHIN ME TO HEAL</b></p>  
 <p>God within me is mighty to heal.<br> He healeth me of all my diseases and cures me of all.<br> God within is now healing me of all my infirmities, sickness and pain and is bringing comfort to my soul.<br> God is my life; I cannot be sick.<br> I hear the voice of Truth telling me to arise and walk, for I am healed.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am healed</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>I DO NOT INHERIT DISEASE</b></p>  
 <p>There is no inherited tendency to disease, nor ill health.<br> I am born of Pure Spirit and am free from the belief in material existence.<br> False ideas cannot be transmitted from one to another, and I am free from all race-suggestion.<br> My Life is from Above, and I remember that I was always Perfect and Complete.<br> An Inner Light shines forth and frees me from the bonds of all false belief.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I came from the Spirit.</i></p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO CONGESTION</b></p>  
 <p>There is no congestion nor stoppage of action.<br> Life, flowing through me, is Perfect and Clear;<br> It cannot be stopped, retarded nor hindered.<br> I feel the One Life flowing through me now.<br> It eliminates all impure secretions and washes me clean from all suggestion of false deposits in the flesh.<br> I am Clean, Pure and Perfect, and my Word eliminates all else.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>There is no congestion</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO FALSE GROWTH</b></p>  
 <p>"Every plant which my Heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up."<br> There is no false growth and nothing for one to feed on. I am free from all thought of, or belief in, anything false or fearsome.<br> I cast out all fear and with it all manifestation of Fear.<br> A false idea is neither person, place nor thing, and has no one to believe in it nor experience it.<br> I am now One with The Perfect Life of Complete Wholeness.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>My Word casts out all fear</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NO WEARINESS</b></p>  
 <p>There is no weariness.<br> Mind and Spirit do not become tired nor weary, and I am Mind and Spirit.<br> The flesh cannot become weary, since it has no mind of its own.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a></p>  
 <p>I am free from all illusions of weariness.<br> My whole being responds to the thought of Life.<br> I am alive with the Great Vitality of the Spirit.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am alive with spirit</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>PERFECT HEALING</b></p>  
 <p>My hearing is perfect.<br> It is God in me hearing His own voice.<br> I hear That Voice, and no belief in inaction can hinder that hearing.<br> There are no impaired organs.<br> Every idea of the body is now complete and perfect and functions according to the Divine Law.<br> I open my ears to hear.<br> I am receptive to Truth and can understand it.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Open my ears that I may hear.</i></p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>PERFECT VISION</b></p>  
 <p>There is One Vision and One ability to see, One perfect seeing.<br> My eyes are open and I see and behold one Perfect Life.<br> No suggestion of imperfect vision can enter my thought.<br> I perceive that all people can see, and that the One, looking through all, sees and cannot be limited in vision.<br> I am one with that complete ability to see, to know and understand the Truth.<br> I do open my eyes and do see.<br> Nothing in me can hinder this Word from operating through me and manifesting through my eyes.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Open my eyes that I may see</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE ALL-SEEING EYE</b></p>  
 <p>The Eye of the Spirit cannot be dimmed, neither can it be impaired in Its ability to see.<br> My eyes are the Vision of my Indwelling Lord; they are the Windows of my Inner Spirit and are always open to the Vision of Truth.<br> I see with the Vision of the Spirit, and that ability cannot be weakened nor lost; it is forever effective.<br> My word which I now speak is the Law of Perfect Sight and my eyes are open and I see.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Spirit sees through me</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE HEALING OF THE FLESH</b></p>  
 <p>My flesh is the Manifestation of the Spirit in my body.<br> It is kept perfect through the Law of God.<br> "In my flesh shall I see God."<br> The mantle of flesh is perfect and complete here and now.<br> It is one with the Body of God, and cannot be sick, nor suffer.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>My flesh is perfect</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THERE IS NO PAIN</b></p>  
 <p>There is no pain nor inflammation.<br> All fear is swept away in the realization of Truth.<br> I am free from every belief in pain.<br> The Spirit cannot pain, and I am Pure Spirit and cannot be hurt nor harmed.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I am free from all pain</i>.</p>
