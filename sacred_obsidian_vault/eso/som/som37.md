 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Science of Mind, by Ernest Shurtleff Holmes [1926], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">MAN'S CREATIVE POWER MARVELOUS</h3>  
 <p>Man's creative power in his world is marvelous; for every time he thinks he sets the Law in motion. As his thought sets the Law in motion it is specializing It for some definite purpose; and in this way his word becomes the law unto the thing which he speaks. Of course man never really creates, but his use of Creative Power makes his word creative through the Medium of Mind. This should give to all a sense of freedom and a realization that there is neither competition nor monopoly. It leaves each to work out his own salvation, not with fear or even trembling, but with a calm sense of peace and assurance.</p>
