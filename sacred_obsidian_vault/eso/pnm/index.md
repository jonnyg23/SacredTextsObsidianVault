 <dir><small>They say, also, that the blood of a basilisk, which they call the blood of Saturn, hath such great force in sorcery that it procures for him that carries it about him good success of his petitions from great men in power, and of his prayers from God, and also remedies of diseases, and grant of any privilege.</small></dir>
 <p>
 This is an early 20th century edition of Agrippa's Philosophy of Natural
 Magic, along with a wealth of background material.
 Originally published in 1531-3, <cite>De occulta philosophia libri tres</cite>,
 (Three books of Occult Philosophy) proposed that magic existed, and it
 could be studied and used by devout Christians, as it was derived
 from God, not the Devil.
 Agrippa had a huge influence on Renaissance esoteric
 philosophers, particularly Giordano Bruno.
 </p>
 <p>
 While this is not a specialist edition, it will suffice
 for the casual reader who doesn't want to wade through
 Elizabethan typography and spelling, just enough of which
 is preserved here for flavor.
 A more comprehensive transcription is located
 <a href="https://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/">here</a>.
 This edition is a pastiche of a portion of a translation of Agrippas'
 <cite>libri tres</cite> by an unidentified translator,
 excerpts from a book on Agrippa by Henry Morley with extensive background,
 and some self-promotional material by the publisher, de Lawrence, who
 was a notorious pirate publisher.
 This end material is of interest because it is a
 good example of early 20th century American occult publishing.
