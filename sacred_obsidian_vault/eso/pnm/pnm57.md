 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">There</span> be wonderful virtues of places accompanying them, either from things there placed, or by the influences of the Stars, or in any other way. For, as Pliny relates of a cuckoo, in what place any one doth first hear him, if his right foot-print be marked about and that place dug up, there will no fleas be bred in that place where it is scattered. So they say that the dust of the track of a snake, being gathered up and scattered amongst bees, makes them return to their hives. So, also, that the dust in which a mule hath rolled himself, being cast upon the body, doth mitigate the heat of passion; and that the dust wherein a hawk hath rolled herself, if it be bound</p>

 <p>to the body in a bright red cloth, cures the quartan. So doth the stone taken out of the nest of a swallow, as they say, presently relieve those that have the falling sickness, and being bound to the party, continually preserves them, especially if it be rolled in the blood or heart of a swallow. And it is reported that if any one shall cut a vein, being fasting, and shall go over a place where any one lately fell with the fit of a falling sickness, that he shall fall into the same disease. And Pliny reports that to fasten an iron nail in that place where he that fell with a fit of the falling sickness first did pitch his head, will free him from his disease. So they say that an herb, growing upon the head of any image, being gathered, and bound up in some part of one's garment with a red thread, shall presently allay the headache; and that any herb gathered out of the brooks or rivers before Sunrising, and no body seeing him that gathers it, shall cure the tertian if it be bound to the left arm, the sick party not knowing what is done.</p>  
 <p>Amongst places that are appropriated to the Stars, all stinking places, and dark, underground, religious, and mournful places, as church-yards, tombs, and houses not inhabited by men; and old, tottering, obscure, dreadful houses; and solitary dens, caves, and pits; also fish-ponds, standing pools, sewers, and such like, are appropriated to Saturn. Unto Jupiter are ascribed all privileged places, consistories of noblemen, tribunals, chairs, places for exercise, schools, and all beautiful and clean places, and those sprinkled with divers odors. To Mars, fiery and bloody places, furnaces, bakehouses, shambles, places of execution, and places where there have been great battles fought and slaughters made, and the like. To the Sun, light places, the serene air, kings’ palaces and princes’ courts, pulpits, theaters, thrones, and all kingly and magnificent places. To Venus, pleasant fountains, green meadows, flourishing gardens, garnished beds,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>stews, and, according to Orpheus, the sea, the seashore, baths, dancing places, and all places belonging to women. To Mercury, shops, schools, warehouses, exchanges for merchants, and the like. To the Moon, wildernesses, woods, rocks, hills, mountains, forests, fountains, waters, rivers, seas, seashores, ships, highways, groves, granaries for corn, and such like. On this account they that endeavor to procure love are wont to bury for a certain time the instruments of their art, whether they be rings, images, looking-glasses, or any other, or hide them in a stew house, so that they will contract some virtue under Venus, the same as those things that stand in stinking places become stinking, and those in an aromatical place become aromatic and of a sweet savor.</p>  
 <p>The four corners of the earth also pertain to this matter. Hence they that are to gather a Saturnine, Martial, or Jovial herb must look towards the East or South, partly because they desire to be oriental from the Sun, and partly because of their principal houses, viz.: Aquarius, Scorpio and Sagittarius are Southern Signs, so also are Capricornus and Pisces. But they that will gather a Venereal, Mercury or Lunary herb must look towards the West because they delight to be western, or else they must look towards the North because their principal houses—viz., Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Virgo—are Northern Signs. So in any Solary work we must look not only towards the East and South whilst plucking it, but also towards the Solary body and light.</p>
