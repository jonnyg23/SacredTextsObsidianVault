 This is the first book written by Guy Ballard, founder of the "I AM" Activity,
 onetime mining engineer, student of
 <a href="../../the/index.htm">Theosophy</a>, and alleged stock swindler.
 Although most of his later work was properly renewed at the US copyright office,
 and is hence still under copyright, someone
 <a href="img/renew.jpg">neglected to file the renewal paperwork</a>
 for this book, so it has entered the public domain.
 </p>
 <p>
 <cite>Unveiled Mysteries</cite> describes an encounter with St. Germain
 (see also <a href="../../sro/csg/index.htm">The Comte de Saint Germain</a>),
 here described as an Ascended Master, virtually a God, and able to manipulate
 the fabric of reality.
 Ballard describes a series of astral trips in time and space with St. Germain,
 to lost civilizations in South America and the Sahara, as well as
 well-stocked bunkers of the ancients in the Grand Tetons,
 Yellowstone, and Mount Shasta.
 Ballard and St. Germain revisit past lives
 as citizens of <a href="../../atl/index.htm">Atlantis</a>
 and <a href="../../atl/ssm/index.htm">Mu</a>, and they turn out to be relatives.
 A final chapter mentions encounters with entities from Venus,
 a theme of later <a href="../../ufo/index.htm">UFO cargo-cults</a>
 of the 1950s.
 Connoisseurs of this genre will appreciate <cite>Unveiled Mysteries</cite>.
 The book is written in a breathless style with a
 more than liberal amount of em-dashes, Inappropriate Capitalization,
 and melodramatic
 plot-points which resemble golden-age pulp sci-fi.
 There are incoherent, surreal rants which would not be
 out of place at a
 <a href="../bob/subman.htm">Church of the Subgenius</a> rally.
 </p>
 <p>
 The book has obvious similarities with
 <a href="../../atl/dtp/index.htm">A Dweller on Two Planets</a>,
 including passages which were probably lifted directly.
 And much of Ballard's metaphysics, history of lost continents,
 'Great White Brotherhood' spiel, and so on, is derivative from Theosophy.
 However, according to some of Ballard's ex-disciples, plagiarism was probably
 the least of his spiritual shenanigans.
 </p>
 <p>
 One notable successor of the "I AM" Activity is
 the Church Universal and Triumphant of Elizabeth Clare Prophet,
 which also reveres St. Germain, and also attempted to
 hole up in the Rocky Mountain area in the 1980s
 against the threat of nuclear war.
 </p>
 <p>Production notes: because of the huge number of em-dashes in this
 book, I have used the Unicode character entity <code>&amp;#8212;</code>
 to encode them, rather than two successive dashes as usual.
 This is to reduce spurious line breaks between
 the normal dashes.
 Unless your browser is set to display basic Unicode, these may show up
 as question marks or boxes.
 To remedy this, refer to the <a href="../../unicode.htm">Unicode Page</a>.
