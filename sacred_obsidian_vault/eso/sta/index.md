 <p>For once, a book which really lives up to its title.
 Hall self-published this massive tome in 1928,
 consisting of about 200 legal-sized pages in 8 point type;
 it is literally his <i>magnum opus</i>.
 Each of the nearly 50 chapters is so dense
 with information that it is the equivalent of an entire short book.
 If you read this book in its entirety you will be in a good position
 to dive into subjects such as the Qabbala, Alchemy, Tarot, Ceremonial Magic,
 Neo-Platonic Philosophy, Mystery Religions, and
 the theory of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry.
 Although there are some questionable and controversial parts of the book,
 such as the outdated material on Islam,
 the portion on the Bacon-Shakespeare hypothesis,
 and Hall's conspiracy theory of history
 as driven by an elite cabal of roving immortals, 
 they are far out-weighed by the comprehensive
 information here on other subjects.
 </p>
 <p>
 For many years this book was only available in a large format edition
 which was hard to obtain and very expensive.
 However, an affordable paperback version has finally been released
 (see sidebar).

 PRODUCTION NOTES:
 I worked on this huge project episodically from 2001 to June 2004.
 This because of the poor OCR quality, which was due to the miniscule
 type and large blocks of italics; this necessitated
 retyping many parts of the text manually.
 To give an idea of how massive this project was, the proof file
 for this is 2 megabytes, about 8 times the size of a normal 200 page book.
 The raw graphics files are 63 megabytes, which I've processed down to about 11
 megabytes.
 The thumbnails alone are 1 megabyte, which is about my graphics
 budget for a regular book.</p>
 <p>
 While the book itself is not covered by copyright in the US due
 to lack of formal renewal, many of the large color illustrations
 that front each chapter in the paper edition did
 have registrations and renewals entered for them.
 So these are omitted from this etext.
 However, all of the black and white illustrations are included here.
 Note that many of the graphics had to be quite large because of the amount
 of detail, so I have thumbnailed every image in the book.
 In the book all of the illustration captions are in italics; I have
 reversed this in the etext for legibility.
