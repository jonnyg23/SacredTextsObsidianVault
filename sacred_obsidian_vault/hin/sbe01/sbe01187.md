 <p>1. Some say: 'Let the swing be one ell (aratni) above the ground, for by that measure verily the Svarga worlds are measured.' That is not to be regarded.</p>  
 <p>2. Others say: 'Let it be one span (prâde<i>s</i>a), for by that measure verily the vital airs were measured.' That is not to be regarded <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. Let it be one fist (mush<i>t</i>i), for by that measure verily all eatable food is made, and by that measure</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></a></p>  
 <p>all eatable food is taken; therefore let it be one fist above the ground.</p>  
 <p>4. They say: 'Let him mount the swing from east to west, like he who shines; for the sun mounts these worlds from east to west.' That is not to be regarded.</p>  
 <p>5. Others say: 'Let him mount the swing sideways, for people mount a horse sideways <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">1</font></a>, thinking that thus they will obtain all desires.' That is not to be regarded.</p>  
 <p>6. They say: 'Let him mount the swing <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">2</font></a> from behind, for people mount a ship from behind, and this swing is a ship in which to go to heaven.' Therefore let him mount it from behind.</p>  
 <p>7. Let him touch the swing with his chin (<i>kh</i>ubuka). The parrot (<i>s</i>uka) thus mounts a tree, and he is of all birds the one who eats most food. Therefore let him touch it with his chin.</p>  
 <p>8. Let him mount the swing with his arms <a name="fr_424"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">3</font></a>. The hawk swoops thus on birds and on trees, and he is of all birds the strongest. Therefore let him mount with his arms.</p>  
 <p>9. Let him not withdraw one foot (the right or left) from the earth, for fear that he may lose his hold.</p>  
 <p>10. The Hot<i>ri</i> mounts the swing, the Udgât<i>ri</i> the seat made of Udumbara wood. The swing is masculine, the seat feminine, and they form a union. Thus he makes a union at the beginning of the uktha in order to get offspring.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p>He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.</p>  
 <p>12. Next the swing is food, the seat fortune. Thus he mounts and obtains food and fortune.</p>  
 <p>13. The Hotrakas (the Prasâst<i>ri</i>, Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin, Pot<i>ri</i>, Nesh<i>t</i>ri, Agnâdhra, and A<i>k</i><i>kh</i>âvâka) together with the Brahman sit down on cushions made of grass, reeds, leaves, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>14. Plants and trees, after they have grown up, bear fruit. Thus if the priests mount on that day altogether (on their seats), they mount on solid and fluid as their proper food. Therefore this serves for the attainment of solid as proper food <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>15. Some say: 'Let him descend after saying vasha<i>t</i> <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 'That is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one who does not see it <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>16. Others say: 'Let him descend after he has taken the food in his hand.' That is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one after he has approached quite close.</p>  
 <p>17. Let him descend after he has seen the food. For, verily, that is real respect which is shown to one when he sees it. Only after having actually</p>

 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p>seen the food (that is brought to the sacrifice), let him descend from the swing.</p>  
 <p>18. Let him descend turning towards the east, for in the east the seed of the gods springs up <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Therefore let him rise turning towards the east, yea, turning towards the east.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_425"></a><a href="sbe01187.htm#fr_427">175:3</a> it is supposed that the Hot<i>ri</i> rises from the swing to show respect to the sacrificial food, when it is brought near. But as it is not brought near, immediately after the Hot<i>ri</i> has finished his part with the word vasha<i>t</i>, the food could not see the Hot<i>ri</i> rise, and this mark of respect, intended for the food, would thus be lost.</p>
