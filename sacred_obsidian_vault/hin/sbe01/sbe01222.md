 <p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="green">p. 236</font></a></p>  <h2 align="center">FOURTH ADHYÂYA.</h2>  <h3 align="center">FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.</h3>  
 <p>With this adhyâya begins the real Upanishad, best known under the name of the Aitareya-upanishad, and often separately edited, commented on, and translated. If treated separately, what we call the fourth adhyâya of the second Âra<i>n</i>yaka, becomes the first adhyâya of the Upanishad, sometimes also, by counting all adhyâya from the beginning of the Aitareya-âranyaka, the ninth. The divisions adopted by Sâya<i>n</i>a, who explains the Upanishad as part of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka, and by <i>S</i>aṅkara, who explains it independently, vary, though Sâya<i>n</i>a states that he follows in his commentary on the Upanishad the earlier commentary of <i>S</i>aṅkara. I have given the divisions adopted by Sâya<i>n</i>a, and have marked those of <i>S</i>aṅkara's by figures in parentheses, placed at the end of each paragraph. The difference between this Upanishad and the three preceding adhyâyas is easily perceived. Hitherto the answer to the question, Whence this world? had been, From Prâ<i>n</i>a, prâ<i>n</i>a meaning breath and life, which was looked upon for a time as a sufficient explanation of all that is. From a psychological point of view this prâ<i>n</i>a is the conscious self (pra<i>g</i>ñâtman); in a more mythological form it appears as Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, 'the golden germ,' sometimes even as Indra. It is one of the chief objects of the prâ<i>n</i>avidyâ, or life-knowledge, to show that the living principle in us is the same as the living principle in the sun, and that by a recognition of their identity and of the true nature of prâ<i>n</i>a, the devotee, or he who has rightly meditated on prâ<i>n</i>a during his life, enters after death into the world of Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha.</p>  
 <p>This is well expressed in the Kaushîtaki-upanishad III, 2, where Indra says to Pratardana: 'I am Prâ<i>n</i>a; meditate on me as the conscious self (pra<i>g</i>ñâtman), as life, as immortality. Life is prâ<i>n</i>a, prâ<i>n</i>a is life. Immortality is prâ<i>n</i>a, prâ<i>n</i>a is immortality. By prâ<i>n</i>a he obtains immortality in the other world, by knowledge (pra<i>g</i>ñâ) true conception. Prâ<i>n</i>a is consciousness (pra<i>g</i>ñâ), consciousness is prâ<i>n</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>This, however, though it may have satisfied the mind of the Brahmans for a time, was not a final solution. That final solution of the problem not simply of life, but of existence, is given in the Upanishad which teaches that Âtman, the Self, and not Prâ<i>n</i>a, Life, is the last and only cause of everything. In some places this</p>  
 <p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="green">p. 237</font></a></p>  
 <p>doctrine is laid down in all its simplicity. Our true self, it is said, has its true being in the Highest Self only. In other passages, however, and nearly in the whole of this Upanishad, this simple doctrine is mixed up with much that is mythological, fanciful, and absurd, arthavâda, as the commentators call it, but as it might often be more truly called, anarthavâda, and it is only towards the end that the identity of the self-conscious self with the Highest Self or Brahman is clearly enuntiated.</p>

 <p>Adoration to the Highest Self. Hari, Om!</p>  
 <p>1. Verily, in the beginning <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">1</font></a> all this was Self, one only; there was nothing else blinking <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">2</font></a> whatsoever.</p>  
 <p>2. He thought: 'Shall I send forth worlds?' (1) He sent forth these worlds,</p>  
 <p>3. Ambhas (water), Marî<i>k</i>i (light), Mara (mortal), and Ap (water).</p>  
 <p>4. That Ambhas (water) is above the heaven, and it is heaven, the support. The Marî<i>k</i>is (the lights) are the sky. The Mara (mortal) is the earth, and the waters under the earth are the Ap world <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">3</font></a>. (2)</p>

 <p>5. He thought: 'There are these worlds; shall I send forth guardians of the worlds?'</p>  
 <p>He then formed the Purusha (the person) <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">1</font></a>, taking him forth from the water <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (3)</p>  
 <p>6. He brooded on him <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and when that person had thus been brooded on, a mouth burst forth <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">4</font></a> like an egg. From the mouth proceeded speech, from speech Agni (fire) <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Nostrils burst forth. From the nostrils proceeded scent (prâ<i>n</i>a) <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">6</font></a>, from scent Vâyu (air).</p>  
 <p>Eyes burst forth. From the eyes proceeded sight, from sight Âditya (sun).</p>  
 <p>Ears burst forth. From the ears proceeded hearing, from hearing the Di<i>s</i> (quarters of the world),</p>  
 <p>Skin burst forth. From the skin proceeded hairs (sense of touch), from the hairs shrubs and trees.</p>  
 <p>The heart burst forth. From the heart proceeded mind, from mind <i>K</i>andramas (moon).</p>  
 <p>The navel burst forth. From the navel proceeded the Apâna (the down-breathing) <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">7</font></a>, from Apâna death.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_585">237:1</a> Before the creation. Comm.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_584"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_586">237:2</a> Blinking, mishat, i. e. living; cf. Rv. X, 190, 2, vi<i>s</i>vasya mishato va<i>s</i>î, the lord of all living. Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to take mishat as a 3rd pers. sing.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_585"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_587">237:3</a> The names of the four worlds are peculiar. Ambhas means water, and is the name given to the highest world, the waters above the heaven, and heaven itself. Marî<i>k</i>is are rays, here used as a name of the sky, antariksha. Mara means dying, and the earth is called so, because all creatures living there must die. Ap is water, here explained as the waters under the earth. The usual division of the world is threefold, earth, sky, and heaven. Here it is fourfold, the fourth division being the water round the earth, or, as the commentator says, under the earth. Ambhas was probably intended for the highest heaven (dyaus), and was then explained both as what is above the heaven and as heaven itself, the support. If we translate, like <i>S</i>aṅkara and Colebrooke, I the water is the region above the heaven which heaven upholds,' we should lose heaven altogether, yet heaven, as the third with sky and earth, is essential in the Indian view of the world.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_588">238:1</a> Purusha; an embodied being, Colebrooke; a being of human shape, Röer; purushâkâram virâ<i>t</i>pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>am, Sâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_587"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_589">238:2</a> According to the commentator, from the five elements, beginning with water. That person is meant for the Virâ<i>g</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_588"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_590">238:3</a> Tap, as the commentator observes, does not mean here and in similar passages to perform austerities (tapas), such as the K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra, the <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a, &amp;c., but to conceive and to will and to create by mere will. I have translated it by brooding, though this expresses a part only of the meaning expressed by tap.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_589"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_591">238:4</a> Literally, was opened.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_590"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_592">238:5</a> Three things are always distinguished here--the place of each sense, the instrument of the sense, and the presiding deity of the sense.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_591"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_593">238:6</a> Prâ<i>n</i>a, i. e. ghrâ<i>n</i>endriya, must be distinguished from the prâ<i>n</i>a, the up-breathing, one of the five prâ<i>n</i>as, and likewise from the prâ<i>n</i>a as the principle of life.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_592"></a><a href="sbe01222.htm#fr_594">238:7</a> The Apâna, down-breathing, is generally one of the five vital airs <a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></a> which are supposed to keep the body alive. in our place, however, apâna is deglutition and digestion, as we shall see in II, 4, 3, 10.</p>
