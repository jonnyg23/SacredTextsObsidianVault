 <p>1. 'If, without knowing this, one offers an Agnihotra, it would be as if a man were to remove the live coals and pour his libation on dead ashes.</p>  
 <p>2. 'But he who offers this Agnihotra with a full knowledge of its true purport, he offers it (i.e. he eats food) <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a> in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs.</p>  
 <p>3. 'As the soft fibres of the Ishîkâ reed, when thrown into the fire, are burnt, thus all his sins are burnt whoever offers this Agnihotra with a full knowledge of its true purport.</p>  
 <p>4. 'Even if he gives what is left of his food to a <i>K</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla, it would be offered in his (the <i>K</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla's) Vai<i>s</i>vânara Self. And so it is said in this <i>S</i>loka:--</p>  
 <p>'As hungry children here on earth sit (expectantly) round their mother, so do all beings sit round the Agnihotra, yea, round the Agnihotra.'</p>
