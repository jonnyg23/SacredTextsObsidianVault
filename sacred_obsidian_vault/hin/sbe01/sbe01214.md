 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="../../img/tn_hin.jpg"></a><br><i>The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)</i>, by Max Müller, [1879], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">THIRD ADHYÂYA <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</h2>  <h3 align="center">FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.</h3>  
 <p>1. He who knows himself as the fivefold hymn (uktha), the emblem of Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), from whence all this springs <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he is clever. These five are the earth, air, ether, water, and fire (<i>g</i>yotis). This is the self, the fivefold uktha. For from him all this springs, and into him it enters again (at the dissolution of the world). He who knows this, becomes the refuge of his friends.</p>  
 <p>2. And to him who knows the food (object) and the feeder (subject) in that uktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Water and earth are food, for all food consists of these two. Fire and air are the feeder, for by means of them <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">3</font></a> man eats all food. Ether is the bowl, for all this is poured into the ether. He who knows this, becomes the bowl or support of his friends.</p>  
 <p>3. To him who knows the food and the feeder in that uktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Herbs and trees are food, animals the feeder, for animals eat herbs and trees.</p>  
 <p>4. Of them again those who have teeth above</p>

 <p>and below, shaped after the likeness of man, are feeders, the other animals are food. Therefore these overcome the other animals, for the eater is over the food.</p>  
 <p>5. He who knows this is over his friends.</p>
