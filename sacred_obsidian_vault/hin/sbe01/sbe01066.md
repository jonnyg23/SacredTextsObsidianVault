 <p>1. On the third of these nectars the Âdityas live, with Varu<i>n</i>a at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.</p>  
 <p>2. They enter into that (dark) colour, and they rise from that colour.</p>  
 <p>3. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Âdityas, with Varu<i>n</i>a at their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour, rises again from that colour.</p>  
 <p>4. So long as the sun rises in the south and sets in the north, twice as long does it rise in the west and set in the east; and so long does he follow the sovereign supremacy of the Âdityas.</p>
