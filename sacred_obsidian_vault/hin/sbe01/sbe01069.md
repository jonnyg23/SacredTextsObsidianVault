 <p>2. 'Yonder he neither rises nor sets at any time. If this is not true, ye gods, may I lose Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>3. And indeed to him who thus knows this Brahma-upanishad (the secret doctrine: of the Veda) the sun does not rise and does not set. For him there is day, once and for all <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. This doctrine (beginning with III, 1, 1) Brahman (m. Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha) told to Pra<i>g</i>âpati (Virâ<i>g</i>), Pra<i>g</i>âpati to Manu, Manu to his offspring (Ikshvâku, &amp;c.) And the father told that (doctrine of) Brahman (n.) to Uddâlaka Âru<i>n</i>i.</p>  
 <p>5. A father may therefore tell that doctrine of Brahman to his eldest son <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or to a worthy pupil.</p>  
 <p>But no one should tell it to anybody else, even if he gave him the whole sea-girt earth, full of treasure, for this doctrine is worth more than that, yea, it is worth more.</p>
