 <p>1. 'Mind (manas) is better than speech. For as the closed fist holds two amalaka or two kola or two aksha fruits, thus does mind hold speech and name. For if a man is minded in his mind to read the sacred hymns, he reads them; if he is minded in his mind to perform any actions, he performs them; if he is minded to wish for sons and cattle, he wishes for them; if he is minded to wish for this world and the other, he wishes for them. For mind is indeed the self <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">1</font></a>, mind is the world, mind is Brahman. Meditate on the mind.</p>  
 <p>2. 'He who meditates on the mind as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as far as the mind reaches--he who meditates on the mind as Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>'Sir, is there something better than mind?'</p>  
 <p>'Yes, there is something better than mind.'</p>  
 <p>'Sir, tell it me.'</p>
