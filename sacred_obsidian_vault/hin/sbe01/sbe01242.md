 <p>1. There was formerly Gârgya Bâlâki <a name="fr_756"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">2</font></a>, famous as a man of great reading; for it was said of him that he lived among the U<i>s</i>înaras, among the Satvat-Matsyas, the Kuru-Pañ<i>k</i>âlas, the Kâ<i>s</i>î-Videhas <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Having gone to A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru, (the king) of Kâ<i>s</i>î, he said to him: 'Shall I tell you Brahman?' A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'We give a thousand (cows) for that speech (of yours), for verily all people run away, saying, "<i>G</i>anaka (the king of Mithilâ) is our father (patron)."'</p>

 <p>A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on him as Yama the king. Whoso meditates on him thus, everything is subdued for his excellencies.'</p>  
 <p>17. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the right eye, on him I meditate.'</p>  
 <p>A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on him as the self of the name, as the self of fire, as the self of splendour. Whoso meditates on him thus, he becomes the self of these.'</p>  
 <p>18. Bâlâki said The person that is in the left eye, on him I meditate.'</p>  
 <p>A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on him as the self of the true, as the self of lightning, as the self of light. Whoso</p>  
 <p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></a></p>  
 <p>meditates on him thus, he becomes the self of these.'</p>  
 <p>19. After this Bâlâki became silent. A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'Thus far only (do you know), O Bâlâki?' 'Thus far only,' replied Bâlâki.</p>  
 <p>Then A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'Vainly did you challenge me, saying: 'Shall I tell you Brahman? O Bâlâki, he who is the maker of those persons (whom you mentioned), he of whom all this is the work, he alone is to be known.'</p>  
 <p>Thereupon Bâlâki came, carrying fuel in his hand, saying: 'May I come to you as a pupil?' A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'I deem it improper that a Kshatriya should initiate a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. Come, I shall make you know clearly.' Then taking him by the hand, he went forth. And the two together came to a person who was asleep. And A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru called him, saying: 'Thou great one, clad in white raiment, Soma, King <a name="fr_764"></a><a href="#fn_762"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' But he remained lying. Then he pushed him with a stick, and he rose at once. Then said A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru to him: 'Bâlâki, where did this person here sleep? Where was he? Whence came he thus back?' Bâlâki did not know.</p>  
 <p>20. And A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: 'Where this person here slept, where he was, whence he thus came back, is this: The arteries of the heart called Hita extend from the heart of the person towards the surrounding body. Small as a hair divided a thousand times, they stand full of a thin fluid of various colours, white, black, yellow, red. In these the person is when sleeping he sees no dream.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then he becomes one with that prâ<i>n</i>a alone. Then speech goes to him with all names, the eye with all forms, the car with all sounds, the mind with all thoughts. And when he awakes, then, as from a burning fire, sparks proceed in all directions, thus from that self the prâ<i>n</i>as (speech, &amp;c.) proceed, each towards its place, from the prâ<i>n</i>as the gods, from the gods the worlds. And as a razor might be fitted in a razor-case, or as fire in the fire-place (the ara<i>n</i>i on the altar), even thus this conscious self enters the self of the body (considers the body as himself) to the very hairs and nails. And the other selfs (such as speech, &amp;c.) follow that self, as his people follow the master of the house. And as the master feeds with his people, nay, as his people feed on the master, thus does this conscious self feed with the other selfs, as a master with his people, and the other selfs follow him, as his people follow the master. So long as Indra did not understand that self, the Asuras conquered him. When he understood it, he conquered the Asuras and obtained the pre-eminence among all gods, sovereignty, supremacy. And thus also he who knows this obtains pre-eminence among all beings, sovereignty, supremacy,--yea, he who knows this.</p>
