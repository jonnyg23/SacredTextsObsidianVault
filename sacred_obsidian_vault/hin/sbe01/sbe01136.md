 <p>1. 'Speech is better than a name. Speech makes us understand the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, Sâma-veda, and as the fourth the Âtharvana, as the fifth the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a, the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the Râ<i>s</i>i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vâkovâkya, the Ekâyana, the Deva-vidyâ, the Brahma-vidyâ, the Kshatra-vidyâ, the Nakshatra-vidyâ, the Sarpa and Deva<i>g</i>ana-vidyâ; heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire, gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; what is right and what is wrong; what is true and what is false; what is good and what is bad; what is pleasing and what is not pleasing. For if there were no speech, neither right nor wrong would be known <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">1</font></a>, neither the true nor the false, neither the good nor the bad, neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant. Speech makes us understand all this. Meditate on speech.</p>  
 <p>2. 'He who meditates on speech as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as far as speech reaches he who meditates on speech as Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>'Sir, is there something better than speech</p>  
 <p>'Yes, there is something better than speech.'</p>  
 <p>'Sir, tell it me.'</p>
