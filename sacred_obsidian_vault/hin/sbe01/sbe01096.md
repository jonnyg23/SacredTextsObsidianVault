 <p>1. Breath said: 'What shall be my food?' They answered: 'Whatever there is, even unto dogs and birds.' Therefore this is food for Ana (the breather). His name is clearly Ana <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">3</font></a>. To him who knows this there is nothing that is not (proper) food.</p>  
 <p>2. He said: 'What shall be my dress?' They answered: 'Water.' Therefore wise people, when they are going to eat food, surround their food before and after with water <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">4</font></a>.' He (prâ<i>n</i>a) thus gains a dress, and is no longer naked <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">5</font></a>'.</p>

 <p>3. Satyakâma <i>G</i>âbâla, after he had communicated this to Go<i>s</i>ruti Vaiyâghrapadya, said to him: 'If you were to tell this to a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves spring from it.'</p>

 <p>4. If <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">1</font></a> a man wishes to reach greatness, let him perform the Dîkshâ <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">2</font></a> (preparatory rite) on the day of the new moon, and then, on the night of the full moon, let him stir a mash of all kinds of herbs with curds and honey, and let him pour ghee on the fire (âvasathya laukika), saying; 'Svâhâ to the oldest and the best.' After that let him throw all that remains (of the ghee) <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">3</font></a> into the mash.</p>  
 <p>5. In the same manner let him pour ghee on. the fire, saying, 'Svâhâ to the richest.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the mash.</p>  
 <p>In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying, 'Svâhâ to the firm rest.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the mash.</p>  
 <p>In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying, 'Svâhâ to success.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the mash.</p>  
 <p>6. Then going forward and placing the mash</p>

 <p>in his hands, he recites: 'Thou (Prâ<i>n</i>a) art Ama <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">1</font></a> by name, for all this together exists in thee. He is the oldest and best, the king, the sovereign May he make me the oldest, the best, the king, the sovereign. May I be all this.'</p>  
 <p>7. Then he eats with the following <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verse at every foot: 'We choose that food'--here he swallows--'Of the divine Savit<i>ri</i> (prâ<i>n</i>a)'--here he swallows--'The best and all-supporting food'--here he swallows--'We meditate on the speed of Bhaga (Savit<i>ri</i>, prâ<i>n</i>a)'--here he drinks all.</p>  
 <p>8. Having cleansed the vessel, whether it be a ka<i>m</i>sa or a <i>k</i>amasa, he sits down behind the fire on a skin or on the bare ground, without speaking or making any other effort. If in his dream he sees a woman, let him know this to be a sign that his sacrifice has succeeded.</p>  
 <p>9. On this there is a <i>S</i>loka: 'If during sacrifices which are to fulfil certain wishes he sees in his dreams a woman, let him know success from this vision in a dream, yea, from this vision in a dream.'</p>
