 <p>1. 'Hope (â<i>s</i>â) is better than memory. Fired by hope does memory read the sacred hymns, perform sacrifices, desire sons and cattle, desire this world and the other. Meditate on hope.</p>  
 <p>2. 'He who meditates on hope as Brahman, all his desires are fulfilled by hope, his prayers are not in vain; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as hope reaches--he who meditates on hope as Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>'Sir, is there something better than hope?'</p>  
 <p>'Yes, there is something better than hope.'</p>  
 <p>'Sir, tell it me.'</p>
