 <p>1. 'Place this salt in water, and then wait on me in the morning.'</p>  
 <p>The son did as he was commanded.</p>  
 <p>The father said to him: 'Bring me the salt, which you placed in the water last night.'</p>  
 <p>

 <p>The son having looked for it, found it not, for, of course, it was melted.</p>  
 <p>2. The father said: 'Taste it from the surface of the water. How is it?'</p>  
 <p>The son replied: 'It is salt.'</p>  
 <p>'Taste it from the middle. How is it?'</p>  
 <p>The son replied: 'It is salt.'</p>  
 <p>'Taste it from the bottom. How is it?'</p>  
 <p>The son replied 'It is salt.'</p>  
 <p>The father said Throw it away <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">1</font></a> and then wait on me.'</p>  
 <p>He did so; but salt exists for ever.</p>  
 <p>Then the father said: 'Here also, in this body, forsooth, you do not perceive the True (Sat), my son; but there indeed it is.</p>  
 <p>3. 'That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O <i>S</i>vetaketu, art it.'</p>  
 <p>'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.</p>  
 <p>'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_291"></a><a href="sbe01130.htm#fr_293">104:1</a> The question which the son is supposed to have asked is How can this universe which has the form and name of earth &amp;c. be produced from the Sat which is subtile, and has neither form nor name?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_292"></a><a href="sbe01131.htm#fr_294">104:2</a> The question here is supposed to have been: If the Sat is the root of all that exists, why is it not perceived?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_293"></a><a href="sbe01131.htm#fr_295">105:1</a> Read abhiprâsya, which is evidently intended by the commentary: abhiprâsya paritya<i>g</i>ya. See B. R. Sanskrit Dictionary, s. v.</p>
