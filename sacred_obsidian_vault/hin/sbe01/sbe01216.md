 <p>1. That man (conceived as uktha) is the sea, rising beyond the whole world <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Whatever he reaches, he wishes to go beyond <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">2</font></a>. If he reaches the sky, he wishes to go beyond.</p>  
 <p>2. If he should reach that (heavenly) world, he would wish to go beyond.</p>  
 <p>3. That man is fivefold. The heat in him is fire; the apertures (of the senses) are ether; blood, mucus, and seed are water; the body is earth; breath is air.</p>  
 <p>4. That air is fivefold, viz. up-breathing, down-breathing, back-breathing, out-breathing, on-breathing. The other powers (devatâs), viz. sight, hearing, mind, and speech, are comprised under up-breathing and down-breathing. For when breath departs, they also depart with it.</p>  
 <p>5. That man (conceived as uktha) is the sacrifice, which is a succession now of speech and now of thought. That sacrifice is fivefold, viz. the Agnihotra, the new and full moon sacrifices, the four-monthly sacrifices, the animal sacrifice, the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice is the most perfect of sacrifices, for in it these five kinds of ceremonies are seen: the first which precedes the libations (the Dîkshâ, &amp;c.), then three libations, and what follows (the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha, &amp;c.) is the fifth.</p>
