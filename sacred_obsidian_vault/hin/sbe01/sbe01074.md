 <p>1. Man is sacrifice. His (first) twenty-four years are the morning-libation. The Gâyatrî has twenty-four syllables, the morning-libation is offered with Gâyatrî hymns. The Vasus are connected with that part of the sacrifice. The Prâ<i>n</i>as (the five senses) are the Vasus, for they make all this to abide (vâsayanti).</p>  
 <p>2. If anything ails him in that (early) age, let him say: 'Ye Prâ<i>n</i>as, ye Vasus, extend this my morning-libation unto the midday-libation, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ<i>n</i>as or Vasus.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.</p>  
 <p>3. The next forty-four years are the midday-libation. The Trish<i>t</i>ubh has forty-four syllables, the midday-libation is offered with Trish<i>t</i>ubh hymns. The Rudras are connected with that part of it. The Prâ<i>n</i>as are the Rudras, for they make all this to cry (rodayanti).</p>  
 <p>4. If anything ails him in that (second) age, let him say: 'Ye Prâ<i>n</i>as, ye Rudras, extend this my midday-libation unto the third libation, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ<i>n</i>as or Rudras.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.</p>  
 <p>5. The next forty-eight years are the third</p>

 <p>libation. The <i>G</i>agatî has forty-eight syllables, the third libation is offered with <i>G</i>agatî hymns. The Âdityas are connected with that part of it. The Prâ<i>n</i>as are the Âdityas, for they take up all this (âdadate).</p>  
 <p>6. If anything ails him in that (third) age, let him say: 'Ye Prâ<i>n</i>as, ye Âdityas, extend this my third libation unto the full age, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ<i>n</i>as or Âdityas.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.</p>  
 <p>7. Mahidâsa Aitareya (the son of Itarâ), who knew this, said (addressing a disease): 'Why dost thou afflict me, as I shall not die by it?' He lived a hundred and sixteen years (i.e. 24+44+48). He, too, who knows this lives on to a hundred and sixteen years.</p>
