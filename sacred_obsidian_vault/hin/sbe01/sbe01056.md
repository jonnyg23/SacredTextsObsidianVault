 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="../../img/tn_hin.jpg"></a><br><i>The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)</i>, by Max Müller, [1879], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">TWENTY-SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p>1. The udgîtha, of which a poet said, I choose the deep sounding note of the Sâman as good for cattle, belongs to Agni; the indefinite note belongs to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the definite note to Soma, the soft and smooth note to Vâyu, the smooth and strong note to Indra, the heron-like note to B<i>ri</i>haspati, the dull note to Varu<i>n</i>a. Let a man cultivate all of these, avoiding, however, that of Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>2. Let a man sing <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">3</font></a>, wishing to obtain by his song immortality for the Devas. 'May I obtain by my song oblations (svadhâ) for the fathers, hope for men, fodder and water for animals, heaven for the sacrificer, food for myself,' thus reflecting on these in his mind, let a man (Udgât<i>ri</i> priest) sing praises, without making mistakes in pronunciation, &amp;c.</p>

 <p>3. All vowels (svara) belong to Indra, all sibilants (ûshman) to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, all consonants (spar<i>s</i>a) to M<i>ri</i>tyu (death). If somebody should reprove him for his vowels, let him say, 'I went to Indra as my refuge (when pronouncing my vowels): he will answer thee.'</p>  
 <p>4. And if somebody should reprove him for his sibilants, let him say, 'I went to Pra<i>g</i>âpati as my refuge: he will smash thee.' And if somebody should reprove him for his consonants, let him say, 'I went to M<i>ri</i>tyu as my refuge: he will reduce thee to ashes.'</p>  
 <p>5. All vowels are to be pronounced with voice (ghosha) and strength (bala), so that the Udgât<i>ri</i> may give strength to Indra. All sibilants are to be pronounced, neither as if swallowed (agrasta) <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">1</font></a>, nor as if thrown out (nirasta) <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">2</font></a>, but well opened <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">3</font></a> (viv<i>ri</i>ta), so that the Udgât<i>ri</i> may give himself to Pra<i>g</i>âpati. All consonants are to be pronounced slowly, and without crowding them together <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">4</font></a>, so that the Udgât<i>ri</i> may withdraw himself from M<i>ri</i>tyu.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_150"></a><a href="sbe01056.htm#fr_151">33:2</a> These are lucubrations on the different tones employed in singing the Sâman hymns, and their names, such as vinardi, anirukta, nirukta, m<i>ri</i>du <i>s</i>laksh<i>n</i>a, <i>s</i>laksh<i>n</i>a balavad, krauñ<i>k</i>a, apadhvânta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_151"></a><a href="sbe01056.htm#fr_152">33:3</a> It would be better if the first ity âgâyet could be left out. The commentator ignores these words.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_152"></a><a href="sbe01056.htm#fr_153">34:1</a> Grâsa, according to the Rig-veda-prâti<i>s</i>âkhya 766, is the stiffening of the root of the tongue in pronunciation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_153"></a><a href="sbe01056.htm#fr_154">34:2</a> Nirâsa, according to the Rig-veda-prâti<i>s</i>âkhya 760, is the withdrawing of the active from the passive organ in pronunciation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_154"></a><a href="sbe01056.htm#fr_155">34:3</a> The opening, viv<i>ri</i>ta, may mean two things, either the opening of the vocal chords (kha), which imparts to the ûshmans their surd character (Rig. Prât. 709), or the opening of the organs of pronunciation (kara<i>n</i>a), which for the ûshmans is asp<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>am sthitam (Rig. Prât. 719), or viv<i>ri</i>ta (Ath. Prât. I, 31; Taitt. Prât. 5).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_155"></a><a href="sbe01056.htm#fr_156">34:4</a> Anabhinihita, for thus the commentaries give the reading, is explained by anabhinikshipta. On the real abhinidhâna, see Rig. Prât. 393. The translation does not follow the commentary. The genitive pra<i>g</i>âpate<i>h</i> is governed by paridadâni.</p>
