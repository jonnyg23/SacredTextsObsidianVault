 <p>1. Prâ<i>k</i>îna<i>s</i>âla Aupamanyava, Satyaya<i>g</i>ña Paulushi, Indradyumna Bhâllaveya, <i>G</i>ana <i>S</i>ârkarâkshya, and Bu<i>d</i>ila Â<i>s</i>vatara<i>s</i>vi, these five great householders and great theologians came once together and held a discussion as to What is our Self, and what is Brahman <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. They reflected and said: 'Sirs, there is that Uddâlaka Âru<i>n</i>i, who knows at present that Self,</p>

 <p>called Vai<i>s</i>vânara. Well, let us go to him.' They went to him.</p>  
 <p>3. But he reflected: 'Those great householders and great theologians will examine me, and I shall not be able to tell them all; therefore I shall recommend another teacher to them.'</p>  
 <p>4. He said to them: 'Sirs, A<i>s</i>vapati Kaikeya knows at present that Self, called Vai<i>s</i>vânara. Well, let us go to him.' They went to him.</p>  
 <p>5. When they arrived (the king) ordered proper presents to be made separately to each of them. And rising the next morning <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">1</font></a> he said: 'In my kingdom there is no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without an altar in his house, no ignorant person, no adulterer, much less an adulteress. I <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">2</font></a> am going to perform a sacrifice, Sirs, and as much wealth as I give to each <i>Ri</i>tvi<i>g</i> priest, I shall give to you, Sirs. Please to stay here.'</p>  
 <p>6. They replied: 'Every man ought to say for what purpose he comes. You know at present that Vai<i>s</i>vânara Self, tell us that.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="sbe01105.htm#fr_261">85:1</a> The commentator explains that the king, seeing that they would not accept his presents, and thinking that they did not consider him worthy of bestowing presents on them, made these remarks.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_261"></a><a href="sbe01105.htm#fr_262">85:2</a> When they still refused his presents, he thought the presents he had offered were too small, and therefore invited them to a sacrifice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="sbe01105.htm#fr_263">85:3</a> He was satisfied with the humility of the Brahmans, who, being Brahmans, came to him, who was not a Brahman, as pupils.
