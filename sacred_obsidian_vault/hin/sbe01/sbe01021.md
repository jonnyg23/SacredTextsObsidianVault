 <p>THE Vâgasaneyi-sa<i>m</i>hitâ-upanishad, commonly called from its beginning, Îsâ or Îsâvâsya, forms the fortieth and concluding chapter of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ of the White Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda. If the Sa<i>m</i>hitâs are presupposed by the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, at least in that form in which we possess them, then this Upanishad, being the only one that forms part of a Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, might claim a very early age. The Sa<i>m</i>hitâ of the White Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, however, is acknowledged to be of modern origin, as compared with the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ of the Black Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, and it would not be safe therefore to ascribe to this Upanishad a much higher antiquity than to those which have found a place in the older Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Âra<i>n</i>yakas.</p>  
 <p>There are differences between the text, as contained in the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda-sa<i>m</i>hitâ, and the text of the Upanishad by itself. Those which are of some interest have been mentioned in the notes.</p>  
 <p>In some notes appended to the translation of this Upanishad I have called attention to what seems to me</p>

 <p>its peculiar character, namely, the recognition of the necessity of works as a preparation for the reception of the highest knowledge. This agrees well with the position occupied by this Upanishad at the end of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, in which the sacrificial works and the hymns that are to accompany them are contained. The doctrine that the moment a man is enlightened, he becomes free, as taught in other Upanishads, led to a rejection of all discipline and a condemnation of all sacrifices, which could hardly have been tolerated in the last chapter of the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda-sa<i>m</i>hitâ, the liturgical Veda par excellence.</p>  
 <p>Other peculiarities of this Upanishad are the name Î<i>s</i>, lord, a far more personal name for the highest Being than Brahman; the asurya (demoniacal) or asûrya (sunless) worlds to which all go who have lost their self; Mâtari<i>s</i>van, used in the sense of prâ<i>n</i>a or spirit; asnâviram, without muscles, in the sense of incorporeal; and the distinction between sambhûti and asambhûti in verses 12-14.</p>  
 <p>The editions of the text, commentaries, and glosses, and the earlier translations may be seen in the works quoted before, p. lxxxiv.</p>
