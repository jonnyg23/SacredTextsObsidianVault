 <p>1. 'Of all living things there are indeed three origins only <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">4</font></a>, that which springs from an egg (oviparous), that which springs from a living being (viviparous), and that which springs from a germ.</p>  
 <p>2. 'That Being <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">5</font></a> (i. e. that which had produced fire, water, and earth) thought, let me now enter those three beings <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">5</font></a> (fire, water, earth) with this living</p>

 <p><a name="fn_276"></a><a href="sbe01121.htm#fr_277">94:4</a> In the Ait. Up. four are mentioned, a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>g</i>a, here â<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>g</i>a, <i>g</i>âru<i>g</i>a (i.e. <i>g</i>arâyu<i>g</i>a), here <i>g</i>îva<i>g</i>a, sveda<i>g</i>a, and udbhi<i>g</i><i>g</i>a, sveda<i>g</i>a, born from heat, being additional. Cf. Atharva-veda I, 12, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_277"></a><a href="sbe01121.htm#fr_279">94:5</a> The text has devatâ, deity; here used in a very general sense. The Sat, though it has produced fire, water, and earth, has not yet obtained its wish of becoming many.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_278"></a><a href="sbe01121.htm#fr_280">95:1</a> This living self is only a shadow, as it were, of the Highest Self; and as the sun, reflected in the water, does not suffer from the movement of the water, the real Self does not suffer pleasure or pain on earth, but the living self only.</p>
