 <p>1. Now follows the Mahâvrata ceremony.</p>  
 <p>2. After having killed V<i>ri</i>tra, Indra became great. When he became great, then there was the Mahâvrata (the great work). This is why the Mahâvrata ceremony is called Mahâvrata.</p>  
 <p>3. Some people say: 'Let the priest make two (recitations with the offering of the) â<i>g</i>ya (ghee) on that day,' but the right thing is one <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. He who desires prosperity should use the hymn, pra vo devâyâgnaye (Rv. III, 13, 1).</p>  
 <p>5. He who desires increase should use the hymn, vi<i>s</i>o vi<i>s</i>o atithim (Rv. VIII, 74, 1).</p>  
 <p>

 <p>6. The people (visa<i>h</i>) indeed are increase <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and therefore he (the sacrificer) becomes increased.</p>  
 <p>7. But (some say), there is the word atithim (in that hymn, which means a guest or stranger, asking for food). Let him not therefore take that hymn. Verily, the atithi (stranger) is able <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">2</font></a> to go begging.</p>  
 <p>8. 'No,' he said, 'let him take that hymn.</p>  
 <p>9. 'For he who follows the good road and obtains distinction, he is an atithi (guest) <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>10. 'They do not consider him who is not so, worthy to be (called) an atithi (guest).</p>  
 <p>11. 'Therefore let him by all means take that hymn.'</p>  
 <p>12. If he takes that hymn, let him place the (second) tristich, âganma v<i>ri</i>trahantamam, 'we came near to the victorious,' first.</p>  
 <p>13. For people worship the whole year (performing the Gavâmayana sacrifice) wishing for this day (the last but one)--they do come near.</p>  
 <p>14. The (next following) three tristichs begin with an Anush<i>t</i>ubh <a name="fr_383"></a><a href="#fn_381"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Now Brahman is Gâyatrî, speech is Anush<i>t</i>ubh. He thus joins speech with Brahman.</p>  
 <p>15. He who desires glory should use the hymn, abodhy agni<i>h</i> samidhâ ganânâm (Rv. V, 1, 1).</p>

 <p>16. He who desires offspring and cattle should use the hymn, hotâ<i>g</i>anish<u>t</u>a <i>k</i>etana<i>h</i> (Rv. II, 5, 1).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_377"></a><a href="sbe01180.htm#fr_379">157:1</a> That it should be one only is proved from the types, i. e. from other sacrifices, that have to be followed in the performance of the Mahâvrata. The first type is the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, where one <i>s</i>astra is enjoined as â<i>g</i>ya<i>s</i>astra, viz. pra vo devâyâgnaye. In the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it, which has to follow the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, another hymn is put in its place, viz. agni<i>m</i> naro dîdhitibhi<i>h</i>. In the Mahâvrata, which has to follow the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it, some people recommend the use of both these hymns. But that is wrong, for there must be in the sacrifices which follow the Agnish<i>t</i>oma twelve <i>s</i>astras altogether; and if there were two here, instead of one, we should get a total of thirteen.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_378"></a><a href="sbe01180.htm#fr_380">158:1</a> The word visa<i>h</i>, which occurs in the hymn, means people. The commentator says that because the Vai<i>s</i>yas or tradespeople increase their capital, therefore they are called increase.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_379"></a><a href="sbe01180.htm#fr_381">158:2</a> Able, or liable; cf. Ait. Âr. II, 3, 5, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_380"></a><a href="sbe01180.htm#fr_382">158:3</a> Atithi is here explained by yo bhavati, and bhavati is explained as walking on the good road. One expects yo vâ atati. The obtaining of distinction is probably derived from ati, above, in atithi.</p>
