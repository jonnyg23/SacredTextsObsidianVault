 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="../../img/tn_hin.jpg"></a><br><i>The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)</i>, by Max Müller, [1879], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">THIRD ADHYÂYA.</h2>  <h3 align="center">FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.</h3>  
 <p>1. Let him begin this day <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">2</font></a> with singing 'Him,' thus they say.</p>  
 <p>2. Verily, the sound Him is Brahman, that day also is Brahman. He who knows this, obtains Brahman even by Brahman.</p>  
 <p>3. As he begins with the sound Him, surely that masculine sound of Him and the feminine <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (the verse) make a couple. Thus he makes a couple at the beginning of the hymn in order to get offspring <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He who knows this, gets cattle and offspring.</p>  
 <p>4. Or, as he begins with the sound Him, surely like a wooden spade, so the sound Him serves to dig up Brahman (the sap of the Veda). And as a man wishes to dig up any, even the hardest soil, with a spade, thus he digs up Brahman.</p>  
 <p>5. He who knows this digs up, by means of the sound Him, everything he may desire.</p>  
 <p>6. If he begins with the sound Him, that sound is the holding apart of divine and human speech.</p>

 <p>Therefore, he who begins, after having uttered the sound Him, holds apart divine and human speech <a name="fr_431"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>
