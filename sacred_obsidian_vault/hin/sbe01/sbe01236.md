 <p>1. To him the Vedas yield no more milk, he has no luck in what he has learnt (from his Guru); he does not know the path of virtue.</p>  
 <p>2. This has also been declared by a <i>Ri</i>shi (Rv. X, 71, 6):--</p>  
 <p>3. 'He who has forsaken the friend (the Veda), that knows his friends, in his speech there is no luck. Though he hears, he hears in vain, for he does not know the path of virtue.'</p>  
 <p>4. Here it is clearly said that he has no luck in what he has learnt, and that he does not know the path of virtue.</p>  
 <p>5. Therefore let no one who knows this, lay the sacrificial fire (belonging to the Mahâvrata) for another, let him not sing the Sâmans of the Mahâvrata</p>  
 <p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></a></p>  
 <p>for another, let him not recite the Sastras of that day for another.</p>  
 <p>6. However, let him willingly do this for a father or for an Â<i>k</i>ârya; for that is done really for himself.</p>  
 <p>7. We have said that the incorporeal conscious self and the sun are one <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">1</font></a>. When these two become separated <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the sun is seen as if it were the moon <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">3</font></a>; no rays spring from it; the sky is red like madder; the patient cannot retain the wind, his head smells bad like a raven's nest:--let him know then that his self (in the body) is gone, and that he will not live very long <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. Then whatever he thinks he has to do,. let him do it, and let him recite the following hymns: Yad anti ya<i>k</i> <i>k</i>a dûrake (Rv. IX, 67, 21-27); Ad it pratnasya retasa<i>h</i> (Rv. VIII, 6, 30); Yatra brahmâ pavamâna (Rv. IX, 113, 6-11); Ud vaya<i>m</i> tamasas pari (Rv. I, 50, 10).</p>  
 <p>9. Next, when the sun is seen pierced, and seems like the nave of a cart-wheel, when he sees his own shadow pierced, let him know then that it is so (as stated before, i. e. that he is going to die soon).</p>  
 <p>10. Next, when he sees himself in a mirror or in the water with a crooked head, or without a head <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">5</font></a>, or when his pupils are seen inverted <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">6</font></a> or not straight, let him know then that it is so.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. Next, let him cover his eyes and watch, then threads are seen as if falling together <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">1</font></a>. But if he does not see them, let him know then that it is so.</p>  
 <p>12. Next, let him cover his ears and listen, and there will be a sound as if of a burning fire or of a carriage <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">2</font></a>. But if he does not hear it, let him know then that it is so.</p>  
 <p>13. Next, when fire looks blue like the neck of a peacock <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or when he sees lightning in a cloudless sky, or no lightning in a clouded sky, or when he sees as it were bright rays in a dark cloud, let him know then that it is so.</p>  
 <p>14. Next, when he sees the ground as if it were burning, let him know that it is so.</p>  
 <p>15. These are the visible signs (from 7-14).</p>  
 <p>16. Next come the dreams <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>17. If he sees a black man with black teeth, and that man kills him; or a boar kills him; a monkey jumps on <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">5</font></a> him; the wind carries him along quickly; having swallowed gold he spits it out <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_672"><font size="1">6</font></a>; he eats honey; he chews stalks; he carries a red lotus; he drives with asses and boars; wearing a wreath of red flowers (naladas) he drives a black cow with a black calf, facing the south <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">7</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>18. If a man sees any one of these (dreams), let</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>him fast, and cook a pot of milk, sacrifice it, accompanying each oblation with a verse of the Râtri hymn (Rv. X, 12 7), and then, after having fed the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, with other food (prepared at his house) eat himself the (rest of the) oblation.</p>  
 <p>19. Let him know that the person within all beings, not heard here <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">1</font></a>, not reached, not thought, not subdued, not seen, not understood, not classed, but hearing, thinking, seeing, classing, sounding, understanding, knowing, is his Self.</p>
