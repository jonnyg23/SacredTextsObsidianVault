 <p>1. The teachers of Brahman (Veda) declare, as the Prâta<i>h</i>-savana (morning-oblation) belongs to the Vasus, the Mâdhyandina-savana (noon-libation) to</p>

 <p>the Rudras, the third Savana (evening-libation) to the Âdityas and the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devas,</p>  
 <p>2. Where then is the world of the sacrificer? He who does not know this, how can he perform the sacrifice? He only who knows, should perform it <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. Before the beginning of the Prâtaranuvâka, (matin-chant), the sacrificer, sitting down behind the household altar (gârhapatya), and looking towards the north, sings the Sâman, addressed to the Vasus:</p>  
 <p>4. 'Open the door of the world (the earth), let us see thee, that we may rule (on earth).'</p>

 <p>6. 'I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is over. Take this! (he says, in offering the libation.) Cast back the bolt!' Having said this, he rises. For him the Vasus fulfil the morning-oblation.</p>

 <p>10. 'I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is over. Take this! Cast back the bolt!' Having said this, he rises. For him the Rudras fulfil the noon-oblation.</p>  
 <p>11. Before the beginning of the third oblation, the sacrificer, sitting down behind the Âhavanîya altar, and looking towards the north, sings the Sâman, addressed to the Âdityas and Vi<i>s</i>ve Devas:</p>
