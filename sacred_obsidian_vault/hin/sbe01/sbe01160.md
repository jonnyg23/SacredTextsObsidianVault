 <p>1. 'To him who sees, perceives, and understands this <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the spirit (prâ<i>n</i>a) springs from the Self, hope springs from the Self, memory springs from the Self; so do ether, fire, water, appearance and disappearance <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">2</font></a>, food, power, understanding, reflection, consideration, will, Mind, speech, names, sacred hymns, and sacrifices--aye, all this springs from the Self.</p>  
 <p>2. 'There is this verse, "He who sees this, does not see death, nor illness, nor pain; he who sees this, sees everything, and obtains everything everywhere.</p>  
 <p>'"He is one (before creation), he becomes three</p>

 <p>'When the intellectual aliment has been purified, the whole nature becomes purified. When the whole nature has been purified, the memory becomes firm. And when the memory (of the Highest Self) remains firm, then all the ties (which bind us to a belief in anything but the Self) are loosened.</p>  
 <p>'The venerable Sanatkumâra showed to Nârada, after his faults had been rubbed out, the other side of darkness. They call Sanatkumâra Skanda, yea, Skanda they call him.'</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_322"></a><a href="sbe01160.htm#fr_324">124:1</a> Before the acquirement of true knowledge, all that has been mentioned before, spirit, hope, memory, &amp;c., on to names, was supposed to spring from the Sat, as something different from oneself. Now he is to know that the Sat is the Self.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_323"></a><a href="sbe01160.htm#fr_325">124:2</a> In the preceding paragraphs appearance and disappearance (birth and death) are not mentioned. This shows how easy it was in these treatises either to omit or to add anything that seemed important.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_324"></a><a href="sbe01160.htm#fr_326">125:1</a> This too is meant as a verse. The commentary says that the various numbers are intended to show the endless variety of form on the Self after creation. Cf. Mait. Up. V, 2.</p>
