 <p>1. 'Air (vâyu) is indeed the end of all <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">2</font></a>. For when fire goes out, it goes into air. When the sun goes down, it goes into air. When the moon goes down, it goes into air.</p>  
 <p>2. 'When water dries up, it goes into air. Air indeed consumes them all. So much with reference to the Devas.</p>  
 <p>3. 'Now with reference to the body. Breath (prâ<i>n</i>a) is indeed the end of all. When a man sleeps, speech goes into breath, so do sight, hearing, and mind. Breath indeed consumes them all.</p>  
 <p>4. 'These are the two ends, air among the Devas, breath among the senses (prâ<i>n</i>âh).'</p>

 <p>5. Once while <i>S</i>aunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni were being waited on at their meal, a religious student begged of them. They gave him nothing.</p>  
 <p>6. He said: 'One god--who is he?--swallowed the four great ones <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he, the guardian of the world.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> O Kâpeya, mortals see him not, O Abhipratârin, though he dwells in many places. He to whom this food belongs, to him it has not been given <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>7. <i>S</i>aunaka Kâpeya, pondering on that speech, went to the student and said: 'He is the self of the Devas, the creator of all beings, with golden tusks, the eater, not without intelligence. His greatness is said to be great indeed, because, without being eaten, he eats even what is not food <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Thus do we, O Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, meditate on that Being.' Then he said: 'give him food.'</p>  
 <p>8. They gave him food. Now these five (the eater Vâyu (air), and his food, Agni (fire), Âditya (sun), <i>K</i>andramas (moon), Ap (water)) and the other five (the eater Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), and his food, speech, sight, hearing, mind) make ten, and that is the K<i>ri</i>ta (the highest <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">3</font></a>) cast (representing the ten, the eaters and the food). Therefore in all quarters those ten are food (and) K<i>ri</i>ta (the highest cast). These are again the Virâ<i>g</i> <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">4</font></a> (of ten syllables)</p>

 <p>which eats the food. Through this all this becomes seen. He who knows this sees all this and becomes an eater of food, yea, he becomes an eater of food.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_201"></a><a href="sbe01080.htm#fr_202">58:3</a> This must refer to Vâyu and Prâ<i>n</i>a swallowing the four, as explained in IV, 3, 2, and IV, 3, 3. The commentator explains <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a> it by Pra<i>g</i>âpati, who is sometimes called Ka. In one sense it would be Brahman, as represented by Vâyu and Prâ<i>n</i>a.</p>

He explains, however, the four casts of the dice, the K<i>ri</i>ta = 4, the Tretâ = 3, the Dvâpara = 2, the Kali = 1, making together 10, the K<i>ri</i>ta cast absorbing the other casts, and thus counting ten.</p>
