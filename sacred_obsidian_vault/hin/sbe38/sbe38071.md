 <p>17. They (the prâ<i>n</i>as) are senses, on account of being so designated, with the exception of the best (the mukhya prâ<i>n</i>a).</p>  
 <p>We have treated of the mukhya prâ<i>n</i>a and the other</p>  
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a></p>  
 <p>eleven prâ<i>n</i>as in due order.--Now there arises another doubt, viz. whether the other prâ<i>n</i>as are functions of the mukhya prâ<i>n</i>a or different beings.--The pûrvapakshin that they are mere functions, on account of scriptural statement. For scripture, after having spoken of the chief prâ<i>n</i>a and the other prâ<i>n</i>as in proximity, declares that those other prâ<i>n</i>as have their Self in the chief prâ<i>n</i>a, 'Well, let us all assume his form. Thereupon they all assumed his form' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 5, 2l).--Their unity is moreover ascertained from the unity of the term applied to them, viz. prâ<i>n</i>a. Otherwise there either would result the objectionable circumstance of one word having different senses, or else the word would in some places have to be taken in its primary sense, in others in a derived sense. Hence, as prâ<i>n</i>a, apâna, &amp;c. are the five functions of the one chief prâ<i>n</i>a, so the eleven prâ<i>n</i>as also which begin with speech are mere functions of the chief prâ<i>n</i>a.--To this we reply as follows. Speech and so on are beings different from the chief prâ<i>n</i>a, on account of the difference of designation.--Which is that difference of designation?--The eleven prâ<i>n</i>as remaining if we abstract from the best one, i.e. the chief prâ<i>n</i>a, are called the sense-organs (indriya), as we see them designated in <i>S</i>ruti, 'from him is born breath, mind, and all organs of sense' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3). In this and other passages prâ<i>n</i>a and the sense-organs are mentioned separately.--But in that case the mind also would have to be excluded from the class of sense-organs, like the prâ<i>n</i>a; as we see that like the latter it is separately mentioned in the passage, 'The mind and all organs of sense.' True; but in Sm<i>ri</i>ti eleven sense-organs are mentioned, and on that account the mind must, like the ear, and so on, be comprised in the sense-organs. That the prâ<i>n</i>a on the other hand is a sense-organ is known neither from Sm<i>ri</i>ti nor <i>S</i>ruti.--Now this difference of designation is appropriate only if there is difference of being. If there were unity of being it would be contradictory that the prâ<i>n</i>a although one should sometimes be designated as sense--organ and sometimes not. Consequently the other prâ<i>n</i>as are different in being from the chief prâ<i>n</i>a.--For this conclusion the following Sûtra states an additional reason.</p>
