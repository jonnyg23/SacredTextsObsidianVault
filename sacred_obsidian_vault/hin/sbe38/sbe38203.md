 <p>60. But (vidyâs) connected with wishes may, according to one's liking, be cumulated or not; on account of the absence of the former reason.</p>  
 <p>The above Sûtra supplies a counter-instance to the preceding Sûtra.--We have, on the other hand, vidyâs connected with definite wishes; as e.g. <i>Kh</i>. Up. III, 15, 2, 'He who knows that the wind is the child of the regions never weeps for his sons;' <i>Kh</i>. Up. VII, 1, 5, 'He who meditates on name as Brahman, walks at will as far as name reaches.' In these vidyâs which, like actions, effect their own special results by means of their 'unseen' Self, there is no reference to any intuition, and one therefore may, according to one's liking, either cumulate them or not cumulate them; 'on account of the absence of the former reason,' i.e. because there is not the reason for option which was stated in the preceding Sûtra.</p>
