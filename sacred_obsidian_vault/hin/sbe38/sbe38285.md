 <p>5. To the elements (the soul, with prâ<i>n</i>a, goes), on account of the subsequent scriptural clause.</p>  
 <p>The soul joined by the prâ<i>n</i>a takes up its abode within the subtle elements which accompany heat and form the seed of the (gross) body. This we conclude from the clause, 'Breath in heat.'--But this passage declares, not that the soul together with the prâ<i>n</i>a takes up its abode in heat, but only that the prâ<i>n</i>a takes up its abode!--No matter, we reply; since the preceding Sûtra intercalates the soul in the interval (between prâ<i>n</i>a and te<i>g</i>as). Of a man who first travels from--<i>S</i>rughna to Mathurâ and then from Mathurâ to Pâ<i>t</i>aliputra, we may say shortly that he travels from--<i>S</i>rughna to Pâ<i>t</i>aliputra. The passage under discussion therefore means that the soul together with the prâ<i>n</i>a abides in the elements associated with heat.--But how are you entitled to draw in the other elements also, while the text only speaks of heat?--To this question the next Sûtra replies.</p>
