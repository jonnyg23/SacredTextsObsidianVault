 <p>63. On account of the rectification.</p>  
 <p>The passage, 'From the seat of the Hot<i>ri</i> he sets right any mistake committed in the udgîtha' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. I, 5, 5), declares that, owing to the might of the meditation on the unity of pra<i>n</i>ava and udgîtha, the Hot<i>ri</i> sets right any mistake he may commit in his work, by means of the work of the Hot<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p>Now, as a meditation mentioned in one Veda is connected (with what is mentioned in another Veda) in the same way as a thing mentioned in another Veda, the above passage suggests the conclusion that all meditations on members of sacrificial acts--in whatever Veda they may be mentioned--have to be combined <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_179"></a><a href="sbe38206.htm#fr_179">282:1</a> A 'thing' belonging to the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, viz. the pra<i>n</i>ava, is, according to the <i>Kh</i>ândogya-passage, connected with the Sâma-veda meditation on the udgîtha. Hence meditations also which belong to different Vedas may be combined; for there is no difference between them and things as far as connexion is concerned.</p>
