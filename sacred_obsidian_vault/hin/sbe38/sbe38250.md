For although in the chapter which treats of qualification (Pû. Mîm. Sû. VI, 8, 22) that expiatory ceremony has been settled (for Brahma<i>k</i>ârins in general), it does not yet hold good for the professed Brahma<i>k</i>ârin. For Sm<i>ri</i>ti declares that such sins cannot be expiated by him any more than a head once cut off can again be healed on to the body, 'He who having once entered on the duties of a Naish<i>th</i>ika again lapses from them, for him--a slayer of the Self--I see no expiation which might make him clean again. 'The Upakurvâ<i>n</i>a (i.e. he who is a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin for a certain time only, not for life) on the other hand, about whose sin Sm<i>ri</i>ti makes no similar declaration, may purify himself by the ceremony mentioned.</p>
