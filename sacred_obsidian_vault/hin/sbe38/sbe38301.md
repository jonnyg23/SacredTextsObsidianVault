 <p>21. (These details) are recorded by Sm<i>ri</i>ti with reference to the Yogins; and both (Sâṅkhya and Yoga) are Sm<i>ri</i>ti (only).</p>  
 <p>The rules as to dying by day and so on in order not to return are given by Sm<i>ri</i>ti for the Yogins only. And those two, viz. Yoga and Sâṅkhya are mere Sm<i>ri</i>ti, not of scriptural character. As thus it has a different sphere of application and is based on a special kind of authority, the Sm<i>ri</i>ti rule as to the time of dying has no influence on knowledge based on scripture.--But, an objection is raised, we have such passages as the following one, 'Fire, light, the day, the light half of the month, the six months of the northern progress; smoke, night, the dark half of the month, the six months of the southern progress' (Bha. Gîtâ VIII, 24; 25); in which though belonging to Sm<i>ri</i>ti we recognise the path of the gods and the path of the fathers just as determined by scripture!--Our refutation, we reply, of the claims of Sm<i>ri</i>ti applies only to the contradiction which may arise from the teaching of Sm<i>ri</i>ti regarding the legitimate time of dying. 'I will tell you the time,' &amp;c. In so far as Sm<i>ri</i>ti also mentions Agni and the other divinities which lead on the departed soul, there is no contradiction whatever.</p>
