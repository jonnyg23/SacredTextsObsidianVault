 <p>8. And the best (i.e. the chief vital air).</p>  
 <p>The Sûtra extends to the chief vital air (mukhya prâ<i>n</i>a) a quality already asserted of the other prâ<i>n</i>as, viz. being an effect of Brahman.--But, an objection may be raised, it has already been stated of all prâ<i>n</i>as without difference that they are effects of Brahman; e.g. the passage, 'From him</p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>is born breath, mind, and all organs of sense' (Mu. Up. II. 1, 3), states the origin of prâ<i>n</i>a separately from the senses and the manas; and there are other passages also such as 'He sent forth prâ<i>n</i>a' (Pr. Up. VI, 4). Why then the formal extension?--We reply: For the purpose of removing further doubt. For in the Nâsadiya-sûkta whose subject is Brahman there occurs the following mantra: 'There was neither death nor the Immortal; nor manifestation of either night or day. By its own law the One was breathing without wind; there was nothing different from that or higher than it' (<i>Ri</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. X, 129, 2). Here the words, 'was breathing' which denote the proper function of breath, intimate that breath existed as it were before the creation. And therefrom it might be concluded that prâ<i>n</i>a is not produced; an idea which the Sûtrakâra discards by the formal extension (to prâ<i>n</i>a of the quality of having originated from Brahman).--Moreover the word 'breathed' does not intimate that prâ<i>n</i>a existed before the creation; for in the first place it is qualified by the addition 'without wind,' and in the second place scriptural passages--such as 'He is without breath, without mind, pure' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2)--declare expressly that the causal substance is without any qualifications such as prâ<i>n</i>a and so on. Hence the word 'breathed' has merely the purpose of setting forth the existence of the cause.--The term 'the best' (employed in the Sûtra) denotes the chief vital air, according to the declaration of scripture, 'Breath indeed is the oldest and the best' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. V, 1, 1). The breath is the oldest because it begins its function from the moment when the child is conceived; the senses of hearing, &amp;c., on the other hand, begin to act only when their special seats, viz. the cars, &amp;c., are formed, and they are thus not 'the oldest.' The designation 'the best' belongs to the prâ<i>n</i>a on account of its superior qualities and on account of the passage, 'We shall not be able to live without thee' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI, 1, 13).</p>
