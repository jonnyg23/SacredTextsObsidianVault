 <p>35. And scripture also declares that (those performing works) are not overpowered (by passion and the like).</p>  
 <p>This Sûtra points out a further indicatory mark fortifying the conclusion that works co-operate towards knowledge. Scripture also shows that he who is furnished with such means as Brahma<i>k</i>arya, &amp;c., is not overpowered by such afflictions as passion and the like. Compare the passage, 'That Self does not perish which they find out by Brahma<i>k</i>arya' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. VIII,,";, 3).--It is thus a settled conclusion that sacrifices and so on are works incumbent on the â<i>s</i>ramas as well as co-operative towards knowledge.</p>
