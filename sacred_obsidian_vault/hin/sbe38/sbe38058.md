Up. VI, 1, 3); and as the concluding passage is 'In it all that exists has its Self' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. VI, 8, 7); and as the matter is moreover known from other scriptural passages; we understand that also the statement about mind and so on consisting of earth, &amp;c., is meant to teach that they are products of Brahman.--It is therefore an established conclusion that the prâ<i>n</i>as also are effects of Brahman.</p>
