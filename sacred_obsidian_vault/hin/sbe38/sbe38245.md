 <p>36. But also (persons standing) between (are qualified for knowledge); for that is seen (in scripture).</p>  
 <p>A doubt arises whether persons in want who do not possess means, &amp;c., and therefore are not able to enter one or the other of the â<i>s</i>ramas., standing between as it were, are qualified for knowledge or not.--They are not qualified, the pûrvapakshin maintains. For we have ascertained that the works incumbent on the â<i>s</i>ramas are the cause of knowledge, and those persons have no opportunity to perform those works.--To this the Sûtrakâra replies. 'But also between.' Even a person who because he does not belong to an â<i>s</i>rama stands between, as it were, is qualified for knowledge. 'For that is seen.' For we meet with scriptural passages declaring that persons of that class--such as Raikva and the daughter of Va<i>k</i>aknu--possessed the knowledge of Brahman (<i>Kh</i>. Up. IV, 1; B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 6, 8).</p>
