 <p>11. But (<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a means) nothing but good and evil works; thus Bâdari opines.</p>  
 <p>The teacher Bâdari, however, thinks that the word '<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a' denotes nothing else but good works and evil works. It means the same as anush<i>th</i>âna (performance) or karman (work). For we see that the root <i>k</i>ar (to walk, to conduct oneself) is used in the general sense of acting. Of a man who performs holy works such as sacrifices, &amp;c., people say in ordinary language, 'that excellent man walks in righteousness.' The word â<i>k</i>âra also denotes only a kind of religious duty. That works and <i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a (conduct) are sometimes spoken of as different things is analogous to the distinction sometimes made between Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Parivrâ<i>g</i>akas <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">2</font></a>. We, therefore, decide that by men of good <i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a are meant those whose works are worthy of praise, by men of evil <i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a those whose works are worthy of blame.</p>
