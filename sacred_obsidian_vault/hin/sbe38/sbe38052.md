 <p>51. On account of the unseen principle being non-limitative.</p>  
 <p>While there are many souls, all-pervading like ether, and in equal proximity to all bodies from within as well as without, the so-called unseen principle (ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a), which is of the nature of religious merit or demerit, is acquired through mind, speech, and body (i.e. thoughts, words, and actions).--Now, according to the Sâṅkhyas, that principle inheres not in the Self, but abides in the pradhâna and cannot, on account of the pradhâna being the same (for all souls), be the limitative cause of the enjoyment of pleasure and pain for each individual Self.--And according to the Kâ<i>n</i>âdas also the unseen principle is due to the non-particular conjunction of the Selfs with the internal</p>
