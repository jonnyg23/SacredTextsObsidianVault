 <p>5. (The prâ<i>n</i>as are) seven, on account of this being understood (from scriptural passages) and of the specification (of those seven).</p>  
 <p>So far we have shown that there is in reality no conflict of scriptural passages regarding the origin of the prâ<i>n</i>as. It will now be shown that there is also no conflict regarding their number. The chief vital air (mukhya prâ<i>n</i>a) will be discussed later on. For the present the Sûtrakâra the number of the other prâ<i>n</i>as. A doubt arises here owing to the conflicting nature of the scriptural passages. In one place seven prâ<i>n</i>as are mentioned, 'The seven prâ<i>n</i>as spring from him' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 8). In another place eight prâ<i>n</i>as are mentioned as being grahas, 'Eight grahas there are and eight atigrahas' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 2, 1). In another place nine, 'Seven are the prâ<i>n</i>as of the head, two the lower ones' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. V, 3, 2, 5). Sometimes ten, 'Nine prâ<i>n</i>as indeed are in men, the navel is the tenth' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. V, 3, 2, 3). Sometimes eleven, 'Ten are these prâ<i>n</i>as in man, and Âtman is the eleventh' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 9, 4). Sometimes twelve, 'All touches have their centre in the skin,' &amp;c. (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 4, 11). Sometimes thirteen, 'The eye and what can be seen,' &amp;c. (Pr. Up. IV, 8).--Thus the scriptural passages disagree about the number of the prâ<i>n</i>as.</p>

 <p>Here the pûrvapakshintains that the prâ<i>n</i>as are in reality seven in number, on account of understanding, i.e. because they are understood to be so many, from passages such as 'The seven prâ<i>n</i>as spring from him,' &amp;c. These seven prâ<i>n</i>as are moreover specified in the other passage quoted above, 'Seven indeed are the prâ<i>n</i>as of the head.'--But in the same passage we meet with the following reiteration, 'Resting in the cave they are placed there seven and seven,' which intimates that there are prâ<i>n</i>as in addition to the seven.--No matter, we reply; that reiteration is made with reference to the plurality of men, and means that each man has seven prâ<i>n</i>as; it does not mean that there are two sets of seven prâ<i>n</i>as each of different nature.--But, another objection will be raised, other scriptural passages speak of the prâ<i>n</i>as as eight in number; how then should they be seven?--True, we reply, the number of eight also is stated; but on account of the contradictory nature of the statements we have to decide in favour of either of the two numbers; hence we decide in favour of the number seven, in deference to the (simpler) assumption of a low number, and consider the statements of other numbers to refer to the difference of modifications (of the fundamental seven prâ<i>n</i>as).--To this argumentation the next Sûtra replies:</p>
