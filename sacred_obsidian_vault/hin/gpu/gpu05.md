 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER III.</h3>  <h4 align="center">An Account of the Torments of Yama.</h4>  
 <p>1. Garuḍa said: What are the torments like that the sinful suffers, having passed along the way of Yama into the abode of Yama? Tell me this, O Keśava.</p>  
 <p>2. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Descendant of Vinatā. I will tell it to you from the beginning to the end. Even at the description of hell you will tremble.</p>  
 <p>3. Four and forty yojanas, O Kāśyapa, beyond the city of Bahubhīti, lies the great city of the King of Justice.</p>  
 <p>4-5. The sinful man cries when he hears the mingled wails of 'Oh, Oh,' and having heard his cry, those who walk about in the city of Yama.</p>  
 <p>All go to the door-keeper and report it to him. The doorkeeper Dharmadhwaja, always stands there.</p>  
 <p>6. He, having gone to Chitragupta, <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">1</font></a> reports the good and evil deeds. Then Chitragupta tells it to the King of Justice.</p>  
 <p>7. The men who are Deniers, O Tārkshya, and always delight in great sin; these are all, as is proper, well-known to the King of Justice.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. <a href="errata.htm#2">Nevertheless</a>, he asks Chitragupta about their sins. Chitragupta, although he is all-knowing, enquires of the Śravaṇas <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>9. The Śravaṇas are the sons of Brāhmaṇ who wander in heaven, on earth, and in the nether regions, hear and understand at a distance, and see a long way off.</p>  
 <p>10. Their wives have a similar nature, and are called, distinctively, Sravanīs. They know accurately all that is done by women.</p>  
 <p>11. These report to Chitragupta everything that is said and done, openly and secretly, by men.</p>  
 <p>12. These followers of the King of Justice know accurately all the virtues and vices of mankind, and the karma born of mind, speech and body.</p>  
 <p>13. Such is the power of these, who have authority over mortals and immortals. Thus do these truth-speaking Śravaṇas relate the actions of man.</p>  
 <p>14. To the man who pleases them by austerity, charity and truthful speech, they become benevolent, granting heaven and liberation.</p>  
 <p>15. Knowing the wicked actions of the sinful, those truth-speakers, relating them before the King of Justice, become dispensers of misery.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. The sun and moon, fire, wind, sky, earth and water, the heart. Yama, day and night, the two twilights, and Justice--know the actions of man.</p>  
 <p>17 The King of Justice, Chitragupta, Śravaṇas, the sun <a href="errata.htm#3">and</a> others see fully the sins and merits of the embodied being.</p>  
 <p>18. Then Yama, having assured himself concerning the sins of the sinful, summons them and shows them his own very terrible form.</p>  
 <p>19-21. Very sinful people behold the terrifying form of Yama--huge of body, rod in hand, seated on a buffalo,</p>  
 <p>Roaring like a cloud at the time of pralaya, like a mountain of lampblack, terrible with weapons gleaming like lightning, possessing thirty-two arms,</p>  
 <p>Extending three yojanas, with eyes like wells, with mouth gaping with formidable fangs, with red eyes and a long nose.</p>  
 <p>22. Even Chitragupta is fearful, attended by Death, Fever and others. Near to him are all the messengers, resembling Yama, roaring.</p>  
 <p>23. Having seen him, the wretch, overcome with fear, cries 'Oh, Oh.' The sinful soul who made no gifts trembles and cries again.</p>  
 <p>24. Then, by command of Yama, Chitragupta speaks to all those sinners, who are crying, and bewailing their karmas.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. 'O, you sinners, evil-doers, polluted with egoism, injudicious, why ever did you commit sin?</p>  
 <p>26. 'O, you foolish people, why ever did you commit that misery-giving sin which is born of lust, anger and association with the sinful.</p>  
 <p>27 'Hitherto you have committed sins with great delight, and thereby are now destined for torment. It is no use turning your faces away.</p>  
 <p>28. 'The sinful actions done by you are very many, and those sins are the cause of unavoidable misery.</p>  
 <p>29. 'It is known that Yama deals equally with the fool and the learned, the <a href="errata.htm#4">beggar</a> and the wealthy, the strong and the weak.'</p>  
 <p>30. Hearing these words of Chitragupta, the sinful then grieve over their karmas, and remain silent and motionless.</p>  
 <p>31. The King of Justice, seeing them standing motionless like thieves, has fitting punishment ordered for the sinful.</p>  
 <p>32. Then the cruel messengers, having beaten them, say, 'Go along, you sinner, to the very dreadful terrifying hells.'</p>  
 <p>33. The messengers, Prachaṇḍa, Chaṇḍaka <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a> and others, executors of the sentences of Yama, having bound them with one noose, lead them towards the hells.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. There is one big tree there, glowing like a blazing fire. It covers five yojanas and is one yojana in height.</p>  
 <p>35. Having bound them on the tree by chains, head downwards, they beat them. They, for whom there is no rescuer, cry, burning there.</p>  
 <p>36. Many sinful ones are hung on that silk-cotton tree, exhausted by hunger and thirst, and beaten by the messengers of Yama.</p>  
 <p>37. 'Oh, forgive my faults'--with suppliant hands, those most. sinful people, helpless, implore the messengers.</p>  
 <p>31. Again and again they are forcibly struck, by the messengers, with metal rods, with hammers, with iron clubs, with spears, with maces and with big pestles.</p>  
 <p>39-40. Thus beaten they become still, swooning away. Then, seeing them quiet, the servants address them thus:</p>  
 <p>'O, you sinners, you evildoers, <a href="errata.htm#5">why ever</a> did you commit such wicked deeds? You did not even make the easy water and food offerings at all.</p>  
 <p>41. 'You did not give even halt a mouthful of food to the dog or the crows, nor honour your guests, nor make the water-offering to the forefathers.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>42. You did not meditate well upon Yama and Chitragupta, nor repeat their mantra, along with which torment cannot exist.</p>  
 <p>43. You never visited any places of pilgrimage, nor worshipped the deities. Though living as a householder you did not even express compassion.</p>  
 <p>44. 'You did not do any acts of service. Suffer the fruits of your own sin! Because you are devoid of righteousness you deserve to be beaten.</p>  
 <p>45. 'Forgiveness of faults is done by the Lord Hari <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">1</font></a> Īśwara. We only punish miscreants, as we are ordered.'</p>  
 <p>46. Thus having spoken the messengers heat them mercilessly; and on account of the beating they fall down like glowing charcoal.</p>  
 <p>47. In falling their limbs are cut by the sharp leaves, and they cry, fallen down and bitten by dogs.</p>  
 <p>48. Then the mouths of those who are crying are filled with dust by the messengers; and, being bound with various nooses some are beaten with hammers.</p>  
 <p>49. Some of the sinful are cut with saws, like firewood, and others thrown flat on the ground, are chopped into pieces with axes.</p>  
 <p>50. Some, their bodies half-buried in a pit, are pierced in the head with arrows. Others, fixed in the middle of a machine, are squeezed like sugar-cane.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>51. Some are surrounded closely with blazing charcoal, enwrapped with torches, and smelted like a lump of ore.</p>  
 <p>52. Some are plunged into heated butter, and others into heated oil, and like a cake thrown into the frying-pan they are turned about.</p>  
 <p>53. Some are thrown in the way, in front of huge maddened elephants, and some with hands and feet bound are placed head downwards.</p>  
 <p>54. Some are thrown into wells; some are hurled from heights; others plunged into pits full of worms, are eaten away by them.</p>  
 <p>55. By the hard beaks of huge flesh-eating crows and vultures they are pecked in the head, eyes and faces.</p>  
 <p>56. Others clamour: 'Give up, give up my wealth, which you owe me. In the world of Yama I see my wealth being enjoyed by you.'</p>  
 <p>57. Thus disputing, the sinful, in the hell-region, are given pieces of flesh torn off with pincers by the messengers.</p>  
 <p>58. Thus quarrelling, they are taken hold of by the messengers, by order of Yama, and thrown into the dreadful hells, Tāmisra and others,</p>  
 <p>59. Hells full of great misery are there,--near to the tree,--in which there is great misery indescribable in words.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>60. There are eighty-four lakhs of hells, O Bird, the midst of which are twenty-one most dreadful of the dreadful.</p>  
 <p>61-64. Tāmisra, <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">1</font></a> Lohaśaṇku, <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">2</font></a> Maharauravaśālmalī, <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">3</font></a> Raurava, <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">4</font></a> Kuḍmala, <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">5</font></a> Kālasūtraka, <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">6</font></a> Pūtimṛittika, <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p>Avīchi, <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">17</font></a> Andhatāmisra, <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">18</font></a> Kumbhīpāka, <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">19</font></a> Sampratāpana, <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">20</font></a> and Tapana, <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">21</font></a>--in all twenty-one,</p>  
 <p>All formed of various afflictions and diseases of different classes, the various fruits of sin, and inhabited by multitudes of servants.</p>  
 <p>65. The sinful fools, devoid of righteousness, Who have fallen into these, experience there, until the end of the age, the various torments of hell.</p>  
 <p>66. Men and women suffer the torments of Tāmisra, Andhatāmisra, Raurava and other hells, which are produced by secret association.</p>  
 <p>67. Thus he who was holding a family or gratifying his belly, having given up both, and being departed, obtains appropriate fruit.</p>

 <p>68. Having cast off his body, which was nourished at the expense of other creatures, he goes alone to hell, provisioned with the opposite of happiness.</p>  
 <p>69. The man experiences in a foul hell what is ordained by his fate, like an invalid who has been robbed of his wealth, the support of his family.</p>  
 <p>70: The individual, who was fond of supporting his family by unrighteous means alone, goes to Andhatāmisra, which is the place of uttermost darkness.</p>  
 <p>71. Having experienced in due order the torments below, he comes here again, purified.</p>
