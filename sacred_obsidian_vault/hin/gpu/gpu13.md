 <p>1. Garuḍa said: Tell me, O Keśava, what good results follow from the performance of the ten-days' rite, and who should perform it if there is no son.</p>  
 <p>2 The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Tārkṣya, and I will tell you about the ten-days' ceremony; having done which, a good son is released from the hereditary debt.</p>  
 <p>3-8. The son, taking calm courage, should offer rice-balls to the father, refraining from tears,</p>  
 <p>Because the departed has inevitably to drink the bitter tears let fall by his relatives, and they should not weep when sorrow is useless.</p>  
 <p>Although there be sorrowing day and night for thousands of years, the man who is dead may never be seen.</p>  
 <p>Death is certain for those who are born, and birth is certain for the dead. This is inevitable and therefore a wise man should not grieve over it.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>There is no way out, either human or divine; the being who has come under the sway of death must be born again here.</p>  
 <p>If there were a way of averting the inevitable, then Nala, Rāma and Yudiṣhṭhira would not have experienced miseries.</p>  
 <p>9-11. Nobody should form an excessive attachment to anybody; the body is only a dream, what then of other persons’?</p>  
 <p>As a traveller, resorting to some shady place, rests awhile and then departs again; so is the coming together of beings.</p>  
 <p>The good things eaten in the morning are destroyed by evening; how can there be permanence in a body which is sustained by these foods?</p>  
 <p>12-17. Having considered this, which removes misery, and given up sorrow arising from ignorance, the son should perform the rites.</p>  
 <p>If there is no son the wife, should perform them, and if no wife the brother; or a Brāhmiṇ's pupil or a proper kinsman should perform them.</p>  
 <p>The ten-days' ceremonies, for the man who has no son, should be performed by the sons or grandsons of his younger or his elder brother, O Bird;</p>  
 <p>Manu declared that if, of brothers of the same father, only one has a son, they are all considered, on account of that son, to have a son.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p>If a man has several wives, but only one of them has a son, all of them have a son, on account of that son.</p>  
 <p>For all who have no sons a friend may offer the rice-balls. The rites <a href="errata.htm#8">must</a> not be neglected. If there is nobody else, the family priest may do them.</p>  
 <p>18. A man or a woman who performs the rites for a friend, by this sacrament for the helpless departed, obtains the fruit of tens of millions of sacrifices.</p>  
 <p>19-21. The ten-days' ceremony for the father should be performed by the son, O Bird. Even if the eldest son dies, the father should not, through excessive affection, perform it.</p>  
 <p>Although there be many sons, only one shall perform the ten-days' ceremony, the rice-ball offerings, and the other sixteen Śrāddhas,--</p>  
 <p>Only by one these ceremonies, even if the wealth has been divided. But the annual Śrāddha should be performed severally if the wealth has been divided.</p>  
 <p>22-24. Therefore should the eldest son perform with devotion the ten-days’ ceremony, <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">1</font></a> eating one meal, sleeping on the ground, devoted to Brāhmaṇ, <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">2</font></a> and pure.</p>  
 <p>The son obtains such fruit from the performance of the rite for the father and mother, as is obtained by going round the shrines seven times.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>The son who performs the rites for one year, beginning with the ten-days' ceremony, obtains such fruit as is acquired by performing the Śrāddha at Gayā.</p>  
 <p>25-30. Having gone to a well or a tank, in a garden, at a sacred bathing-place, or in a temple, between nine and twelve noon, he should bathe without reciting mantras.</p>  
 <p>Being purified, seated facing southward at the root of a tree, he should make an altar <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">1</font></a> there, cleansed with cow-dung.</p>  
 <p>He should place on it, over leaves, a twice-born <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">2</font></a> made of darbha and kuśa grasses, and having worshipped it with water for the feet and other things, should bow to it, saying the "Atasī."</p>  
 <p>Then having spread kuśa grass in front of it, as a seat for the rice-ball, and having placed upon it a ball prepared in the family-name of the departed,</p>  
 <p>Made of cooked rice or of barley meal,--the son should make the offering. He should dedicate Usīra-root; sandal paste, the flowers of the Bhṛiṅgarāja, incense, a lamp, eatables, mouth-perfumes and presents.</p>  
 <p>Crow-food, milk and water, and handfuls of castor-oil in a pot: "May all this, that has been given by me to the departed in his earthly name, persist."</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>31-33. Food, cloths, water, wealth or other things, if given in the name of the departed, confer eternity upon the dead.</p>  
 <p>Therefore, from the first day onwards, one should pronounce the name of the departed woman or man, in accordance with the sapiṇḍa rite.</p>  
 <p>33. In the same way that on the first day a rice-ball is given as prescribed, so should the nine rice-balls be given.</p>  
 <p>34-36. On the ninth day all the authorised kinsmen at the proper time should besmear themselves with oil, wishing the dead to reach heaven.</p>  
 <p>Having bathed in the open, taking with them panic grass and parched grain, and having the women go in front, they should proceed to the place of the dead,</p>  
 <p>And say: "May his family increase like the panic grass, and radiate like the parched grain," and then leave in the house the mixed-panic grass and grain.</p>  
 <p>37-38. On the tenth day a ball of flesh should be given, O Lord of Birds, or a ball of māṣa, since flesh is forbidden in the Kali Yuga at the ceremony for the forefathers.</p>  
 <p>On the tenth day he should shave, as also should the other relatives. The son who performs the ceremony must again have a complete shave.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p>39. During the ten days he should feed a twice-born with seasoned foods. Having meditated upon Hari, he should, with hands together, pray for the release of the departed.</p>  
 <p>40. There is no reason for fear for those who bow to Govinda, the Eternal, clad in yellow robes, as beautiful as the atasī flower.</p>  
 <p>41-42. "O Beginningless and Endless Deva, O Bearer of the conch, discus and mace, Indestructible, Lotus-eyed, be Thou the giver of release to the departed."</p>  
 <p>Every day at the conclusion of the Śrāddha he should prayerfully repeat this incantation. Having bathed, gone home, and given food to the cow, he may eat.</p>
