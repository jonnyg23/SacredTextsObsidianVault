 <p>1. Sūta said: Having heard this, Garuḍa, trembling like a leaf of the holy fig-tree, again questioned Keśava for the benefit of men.</p>  
 <p>2. Garuḍa said: Tell me by what means men who have committed sins unknowingly or knowingly escape from the torments of the servants of Yama.</p>  
 <p>3-4. For those men who are immersed in the ocean of transmigration, of weak intelligence, their reason clouded by sin, their self dimmed by attachment to sense-objects--</p>  
 <p>For their uplifting tell me, O Lord, the exact meaning of the Purāṇas; and the means by which people attain a happy condition, O Mādhava.</p>  
 <p>5. The Blessed Lord said: O Tārkṣya, you have done well in asking for the benefit of men, Listen attentively, and I will tell you all.</p>  
 <p>6. Hard indeed, as already said, is the fate of the sinful and those without sons; but never so, O Lord of Birds, that of those who have sons and who are righteous,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. If by any past action of his the birth of a son has been prevented, then some means should be taken for obtaining a son.</p>  
 <p>8. Having listened to the Harivanśa, or performed the Śatachaṇḍī, or worshipped the Blessed Śiva with devotion, the intelligent should beget a son.</p>  
 <p>9. The son saves his father from the hell called Put; therefore he was named "putra" by the Self-existent himself.</p>  
 <p>10. Even a single son, if righteous, carries the whole family over. 'By the son he conquers the worlds,' is the ancient saying.</p>  
 <p>11. The Vedas also proclaim the great importance of the son. Accordingly, having seen the face of a son, one is released from the debt to the forefathers.</p>  
 <p>12. By the touch of his grandson a mortal is released from the three-fold debt. With the help of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons he goes from the worlds and obtains heaven.</p>  
 <p>13. The son of a Brāhma marriage uplifts, but the illegitimate drags down. Knowing this, O Best of Birds, one should avoid a woman of lower caste.</p>  
 <p>14. Sons having father and mother of the same caste are legitimate, O Bird. They alone, by making Śrāddha-gifts are the means of their fathers' attaining heaven.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. Need I say one attains heaven by means of the Śrāddha performed by a son, when a Departed One went to heaven even when it was offered by another. Now listen.</p>  
 <p>16. Concerning this I will give you, from ancient history, an example of the efficacy of gifts for the higher body.</p>  
 <p>17-19. Formerly, in the Treta age, Tārkṣya, there reigned over the delightful city of Mahodaya a king named Babhruvāhana, who was very powerful, and firm in righteousness,</p>  
 <p>A sacrificer, Lord of Gifts, prosperous, a lover of Brāhmaṇs, valuing the good, endowed with good character and of good conduct, compassionate, skilled,</p>  
 <p>Righteously protecting his subjects as though they were his own sons, always delighting in Kṣattriya duties, and punishing the guilty.</p>  
 <p>20-21. Once, that powerful king, with his army, went hunting. He entered a thick forest, full of various kinds of trees,</p>  
 <p>Crowded with various species of animals, and resounding with the cries of various birds. In the midst of the forest the king saw a deer in the distance.</p>  
 <p>22. The deer, severely wounded by his very hard arrow, ran out of sight into the interior of the forest, carrying the arrow with him.</p>  
 <p>23. The king, following the blood-stains on the grass, pursued the deer and came into another forest.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. That leader of men, hungry and with parched throat, fainting with the heat and with fatigue, coming to a lake bathed in it with his horse.</p>  
 <p>25-27. Then, having drunk of that cool water, rendered fragrant by the-pollen of the lotus, Babhruvāhana came out of the water refreshed,</p>  
 <p>And saw a delightful fig-tree, giving cool shade with its large spreading boughs, sounding with many birds,</p>  
 <p>And standing like a big standard over the whole forest. The king approached and sat at its root.</p>  
 <p>28. Now he beheld a Departed One, of terrible appearance, humpbacked and fleshless, with hair erect, dirty, and with senses discomposed by hunger and thirst.</p>  
 <p>29-31. Seeing him deformed and dreadful Babhruvāhana wondered. The Departed One, also seeing the king who had come to that dreadful forest,</p>  
 <p>And becoming filled with curiosity, came near to him. Then, O Tārkṣya, this king of the Departed spoke thus to the king:</p>  
 <p>"I have escaped the condition of the Departed and reached the highest condition, by being in touch with you, O Great-Armed one,--I am highly blessed."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>32-33. The king said: "O Black-complexioned and Gaping-mouthed, by what bad deeds did you reach this state of the Departed, dreadful to see, and highly unhappy?"</p>  
 <p>"Tell me in detail the cause of your condition, dear. Who are you, and by what gifts will your condition as Departed pass away?"</p>  
 <p>34-38. The Departed one said: "I will tell you everything from the beginning, O Best of Kings. You will surely have compassion upon me when you have heard the cause of my condition as Departed,</p>  
 <p>"There is a town named Vaidaśa, possessed of all prosperity, having many districts, and abounding in precious stones of various kinds,</p>  
 <p>"Beautiful with palaces and mansions, and in which many religious acts are performed. There, O Reverend Sir, I dwelt, always engaged in worship of the Shining Ones.</p>  
 <p>"By caste I am a Vaishya, by name Sudeva, please know. By fire-offering I pleased the Shining Ones, and likewise the forefathers by food.</p>  
 <p>"I gladdened the twice-born by offering various gifts. I gave food of various kinds to the poor, the blind and the wretched.</p>  
 <p>39-41. "All this, O King, through my evil fate has proved fruitless. How my good deeds proved fruitless I will relate to you.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a></p>  
 <p>"I have no offspring, no companion, no relative and no friend like you, who will perform for me the ceremonies for the-higher body.</p>  
 <p>"If the sixteen monthly Śrāddhas, O great king, are not performed, the condition as Departed becomes firmly fixed, even if hundreds of annual Śrāddhas are performed for him.</p>  
 <p>42-45. "Uplift me then, O Lord of Earth, by doing the ceremonies for my higher body. It is said that in this world the king is the kinsman of all castes.</p>  
 <p>"Therefore, O Lord of Kings, help me over, and I will give you a most precious jewel, so that my departed condition may be destroyed, and my higher state arise.</p>  
 <p>"In that manner please act, O warrior, if you desire my welfare. Suffering from the misery of hunger and thirst, I cannot endure this departed condition.</p>  
 <p>"In this forest there is sweet and cool water, and pleasant fruits, but I am not able to grasp them at all, although afflicted with hunger and thirst.</p>  
 <p>46-48. "If the great Nārāyaṇa rite is performed for me, O King, along with all the ceremonies for the higher body, with Vaidic mantras,</p>  
 <p>"Then surely my condition as departed will unfailingly pass away. Vaidic mantras, austerities, gifts, and compassion to all beings,</p>  
 <p>"Listening to holy scriptures, worship of Viṣṇu, association with the good,--these, I have heard, are the destroyers of the departed condition.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a></p>  
 <p>49-50. "So I will tell you about the worship of Viṣṇu, the destroyer of the departed condition. Bring two pieces of gold, honestly gained, and make one image of Nārāyaṇa from them, O King.</p>  
 <p>"Dress it with a pair of yellow cloths, put on it various ornaments, bathe it in many waters,--and placing it, you should worship thus.</p>  
 <p>51-56. "Place Śrīdhara <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the east of it, Madhusūdana <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a> to the south, to the west Vāmanadeva <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">3</font></a>, to the north Gadādhara, <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>"In the middle Pitāmaha <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">5</font></a> and also Maheśwara. <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">5</font></a> Worship these in turn with sandal-paste and flowers, according to the rite.</p>  
 <p>"Then, having gone round them, make offerings in the fire to these deities. Make offerings to the universal deities with clarified butter, curds and milk.</p>  
 <p>"Next, having bathed, calm and controlled in mind, the sacrificer should perform, according to the rite, in front of Nārāyaṇa, the ceremony for the upper body.</p>  
 <p>"He must commence, as prescribed in the scriptures, by giving up anger and greed, and perform all the ceremonies and the release of a bull.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Then he must give thirteen sets of pots to Brāhmiṇs, and having made the gift of a bed, consecrate a pot of water for the sake of the departed."</p>  
 <p>57. The king said, "How is the pot for the departed to be prepared, and in accordance with what: rites must it be given? Tell me, on account of my sympathy for all, about the pot which gives release to the departed."</p>  
 <p>58-63. The departed said: "Oh Great King, you have done well in asking this. Please take notice and l will describe that good gift by which the departed condition cannot exist.</p>  
 <p>"The gift which is named 'the pot for the departed,' is a destroyer of all evil. In all the worlds it is difficult to obtain this dissipator of evil conditions.</p>  
 <p>"Having prepared a pot of refined gold, consecrated it to Brahmā, Īśa <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Keśava <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and all the guardians of the quarters, filled it with clarified butter and worshipped before it with devotion, give it to a twice-born. What good are a hundred other gifts from you?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Brahmā in the middle, likewise Viṣṇu, and Śaṅkara, eternal giver of happiness; in the east and other directions, in the neck of it, the guardians of the universe, in order--</p>  
 <p>"These having duly worshipped, O King, with incenses, flowers and sandal-paste, one should give away the golden pot, full of milk and clarified butter.</p>  
 <p>"This gift, O King, which is superior to all other gifts in removing great sins, should be made with faith, for the release of the departed."</p>  
 <p>64-65. The Blessed Lord spoke on: His army, while he was thus conversing with the departed, followed him up, with elephants, horses and chariots, O Kāśyapa.</p>  
 <p>On the arrival of the army the departed one, having given the great jewel to the king, bowed to him, again implored him, and became invisible.</p>  
 <p>66-68. Having come out of the forest, the king returned to his city, and arrived there remembering all that was said by the departed one.</p>  
 <p>He duly performed; O Bird, the rites and ceremonies for the dweller in the upper body, and the departed, released by these sacred gifts, attained heaven.</p>  
 <p>By the Śrāddha, performed even by a stranger, the departed attain a happy state,--what wonder then that when the son performs it the father should reach it!</p>  
 <p>60. He who hears, and he who causes others to hear this holy history, never go to the departed condition, though they may. have acted sinfully.</p>
