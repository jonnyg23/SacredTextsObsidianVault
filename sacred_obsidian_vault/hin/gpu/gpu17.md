 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XV.</h3>  <h4 align="center">An Account of the Coming to Birth of People who have done Good.</h4>  
 <p>1-2. Garuḍa said: The righteous man having enjoyed heaven, is born in a stainless family. Now tell me how he is produced in the womb of the mother.</p>  
 <p>I wish to hear what, in this body, the man of good deeds thinks. Tell me, O Treasure-house of Compassion!</p>  
 <p>3-4. The Blessed. Lord said: You have asked well, O Tārkṣya. I will tell you that supreme secret, even by knowing which one becomes all-knowing.</p>  
 <p>I will tell you the real nature of that body which possesses the attributes of the universal Egg,--the object of concentration of Yogins.</p>  
 <p>5-6. Hear how the Yogins perform the meditation upon the six chakras <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">1</font></a> within it, and likewise meditation upon the nature of Chit and Ānanda in the Brahmarandhra,</p>  
 <p>And how he of good deeds is born in the house of the pure and prosperous. I will tell you also about the rites and observances of the parents.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></a></p>  
 <p>7-10. After menstruation the women should be avoided for four days. Their face should not be seen during that time, lest sin should arise in the body.</p>  
 <p>Having bathed, and washed her clothes, a woman becomes pure on the fourth day. From the seventh day she becomes fit to perform the rites of worship to the forefathers and the Shining Ones.</p>  
 <p>During the seven days the embryo continues impure. Here the sons gradually enter during the eighth day.</p>  
 <p>Sons are born on even nights, daughters on odd. Keeping away from, her during the first seven days, on even nights he enters.</p>  
 <p>11-12. Sixteen nights are declared to be common for women. <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">1</font></a> On the fourteenth night the seed remains there certainly.</p>  
 <p>Then is produced the righteous son, a store of auspicious qualities. That night is never obtained by vulgar people.</p>  
 <p>13. On the firth. day women should eat sweet foods. Pungent, acid, astringent and hot things should be entirely avoided.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></a></p>  
 <p>14-18. The husband, like a husbandman, having sown the seed of great potentiality in the field which is productive of grain, reaps a good harvest.</p>  
 <p>The man, having chewed betel, <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">1</font></a> put on flowers and sandal-paste, and clean clothes, and with righteous thoughts in his mind, should unite with his good wife.</p>  
 <p>According to the thoughts in his mind at the time of union will be the nature of the one who enters the womb.</p>  
 <p>The intelligence joined with the seed remains always in the sperm, When desire, thought and sperm become united,</p>  
 <p>Then the man obtains semen, and in the interior of the womb the formation of ovum takes place, by the union of sperm and germ [cells]</p>  
 <p>19. The good son who enters the womb is the giver of the highest bliss. For him there are numerous rites, such as the Punsavana. <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>20-23. The meritorious soul obtains birth in a high family. At the time of his birth Brāhmiṇs receive much wealth.</p>  
 <p>He grows up in his parents' house, endowed with learning and modesty, becoming skilful in all the sciences, by association with the wise.</p>  
 <p>In his youth he is divinely handsome, wealthy and benevolent, arising as the result of great merit, austerities, and pilgrimages to sacred waters, formerly done.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then he constantly strives to discriminate between the self and the not-self. By adhyāropa <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">1</font></a> and apavāda <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">2</font></a> he meditates upon Brāhmaṇ.</p>  
 <p>24. For the understanding of the dissociation of Brāhmaṇ from that with which he is associated, I will tell you the attributes of earth and the others, which are of the genus "Not-self."</p>  
 <p>25-30. Earth, water, fire, air and ether--these are called the stable elements. This body is made up of the five elements.</p>  
 <p>Skin, bones, nerves, hair and flesh,--these are the five attributes of earth, O Lord of birds, declared to you by me.</p>  
 <p>Saliva, urine, sperm, marrow, and blood, the fifth,--are said to be the five attributes of water. Now hear those of fire:--</p>  
 <p>Hunger, thirst, sloth, sleep and sexual desire--are called the five attributes of fire by Yogins everywhere, O Tārkṣya.</p>  
 <p>Bending, running, jumping, stretching and moving,--these are declared the five attributes of air.</p>  
 <p>Speech, thought, vacuity, delusion and mental instability--the five attributes of ether, may be understood by you with effort.</p>  
 <p>31. Mind, reason, individualisation, analysis--these four are called the Internal Means, and have the flavour of past karma.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. Ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose are the sense organs. The organs of speech, hands, feet, the organs of generation and of excretion are the organs of action.</p>  
 <p>33. Dik, Vāta, Arka, Prachetas, the two Aśvins, Vahni, Indra, Upeudra, Mitra, are declared to be the duties of the organs of sense and action,</p>  
 <p>34-35. Iḍā, <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">1</font></a> Pingalā, <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">2</font></a> Suṣumnā, <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">3</font></a> thirdly, and also Gāndhārī, <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">4</font></a> Gajajihva, <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">5</font></a> Pūṣā, <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">6</font></a> Yaśasvinī, <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>Alambuṣa, <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">8</font></a> and Kuhū, <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">9</font></a> and Saṅkhinī, <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">10</font></a> the tenth as well--are situated in the interior of the body, and are the ten principal Naḍīs. <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>36-39. Prāṇa, Apāna, Samāna, Udāna, and Vyāna also,--Nāga, Kūrma, Kṛikala, Devadatta and Dhanañjaya <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">12</font></a>:--</p>  
 <p>In the heart, Prāṇa; in the anus, Apāna; in the navel, Samāna; in the region of the throat, Udāna; and distributed all over the body, Vyāna:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></a></p>  
 <p>Vomiting is called Nāga; opening and shutting the eyes is known as Kūrma; the cause of hunger is to be known as Kṛikala; Yawning, Devadatta;</p>  
 <p>Dhanañjaya, all-pervading, does not leave even the corpse, and carries all over the body the nourishment which is obtained by eating mouthfuls of food.</p>  
 <p>40-43. The air called Vyāna carries the essential part in all the Nāḍīs. Food, as soon as eaten, is split into two by that air.</p>  
 <p>Having entered near the anus it separates the solid and liquid portions, placing the water over the fire, and the solid over the water,</p>  
 <p>The Prāna standing under the fire, inflames it slowly. The fire, inflamed by the air, separates the substance from the waste.</p>  
 <p>The Vyāna air makes the essence go all over, and the waste, forced through the twelve gateways, is ejected from the body.</p>  
 <p>44. Ears, eyes, nostrils, tongue, teeth, navel, nails, anus, generative organs, head, trunk, hair--are called unclean places.</p>  
 <p>45. Thus the airs, having <a href="errata.htm#20">derived</a> their power from the self, perform their own functions, affecting people, just as does the rising of the sun.</p>  
 <p>46. Now hear, O Bird, the two-fold nature of the body of man. One is Vyāvahārika, and the second Pāramārthika.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></a></p>  
 <p>47-52. On the Vyāvahārika there are thirty-five millions of hairs of the body, seven hundred thousands of hairs of the head, it is said, and twenty nails;</p>  
 <p>There are said to be thirty-two teeth usually, O son of Vinatā; the flesh is said to be one thousand <i>palās</i> <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">1</font></a> and blood one hundred <i>palās</i>;</p>  
 <p>Fat is ten <i>palās</i>; skin is seven <i>palās</i>, marrow is twelve <i>palās</i>; the "great blood" is three palas;</p>  
 <p>Seed is known to be two <i>kuḍavas</i>; ovum one <i>kuḍava</i>; and bones in the body are said to be three hundred and sixty;</p>  
 <p>The <i>nāḍīs</i>, both dense and subtle, number tens of million; bile is fifty <i>palās</i>; phlegm is half of that;</p>  
 <p>The waste materials are not measurable, as they are constantly changing. The body which possesses these attributes is Vyāvahārika. <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>53. All the worlds, mountains, continents, oceans, suns and planets are in the Pāramārthika <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">3</font></a> body.</p>  
 <p>54. In the Pāramārthika body, there are six chakras in which are said to be located the attributes of the egg of Brahmā.</p>  
 <p>55. I will tell you about these, which are the objects of meditation of Yogins. By pondering upon them one becomes the enjoyer of the nature of Vairāja. <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p>56-59. Below the feet is called Atala; above the feet, Vitala; at the knees know it as Sutala; at the thighs Mahātala;</p>  
 <p>At the hips, Talātala; at the secret part Rasātala; at the loins Pātāla; these are declared to be the seven worlds:</p>  
 <p>Bhūloka, at the middle of the navel; above it the Bhuvarloka; in the heart, Svarloka; at the throat it should be known as Maharloka;</p>  
 <p>Janaloka, in the region of the mouth; Tapolaka, at the forehead; Satyaloka in the Brahmarandhra--these are the fourteen worlds.</p>  
 <p>60-61. Meru is situated in the triangle <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">1</font></a>; Mandara is in the inverted triangle; Kailāśa is in the right triangle; Himāchala, in the left triangle.</p>  
 <p>Niṣada is in the upper lines Gandhamādana in the lines on the right; Ramaṇa in the lines on the left;--the seven great mountains.</p>  
 <p>62-65. Jambu is in the place of the bones; Sāka is situated in the marrow; the Kuśa continent is situated in the flesh; the Krauncha continent in the nerves;</p>  
 <p>The Śālmalī continent is in the skin; Gomeda, in the mass of hair; Puṣkara, in the place of the nails;--and next the oceans:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the urine the Kṣāra ocean; the Kṣīra ocean in the milk; the Sura ocean is situated in the phlegm; in the <a href="errata.htm#21">marrow</a>, the Ghṛita ocean;</p>  
 <p>The Rasa ocean in the juices; the Dadhi ocean is known to be in the ova; the Swādu ocean in the region of the soft palate; you should know son of Vinatā.</p>  
 <p>66-68. The sun is situated in the Nāda chakra; the moon is in the Bindu chakra; Mars is situated, it should be known, in the eyes; Mercury is in the heart, it is declared;</p>  
 <p>Jupiter is in the Viṣṇu-sthāna, it should be known; Venus is situated in the seed; Saturn is in the navel; Rāhu, in the face, it is declared;</p>  
 <p>Ketu is situated in the lungs;--in the body is the circle of the planets. In all these forms one should meditate on his own body.</p>  
 <p>69-71. Always at dawn, sitting steadily cross-legged, one should meditate upon the six chakras, in the order of the Ajapā. <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Gāyatrī called Ajapā is the giver of liberation to the sages; by merely thinking upon it one is released from all sin.</p>  
 <p>Listen, O Tārkṣya, and I will explain the best method of Ajapā, by doing which the individual always gives up his separateness.</p>  
 <p>72-73. Mūlādhāra, Swādhishthāna, Maṇipūraka, Anāhatam, Viśuddhi and also Ājñā,--are spoken of as the six chakras.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>One should meditate in order upon the chakras, at the root of the generative organ; in the region of the pelvis; in the navel; in the heart; in the throat; between the eyebrows; at the top of the head.</p>  
 <p>74-75. The mūlādhāra is four-petalled and resplendent, with letters from va to sa; the Svādhiṣṭhāna resembles the sun, is six-petalled, and has the letters from ba to la; the Maṇipūraka is red in colour and has ten petals, from da to pha; the Anāhata is twelve-petalled, from ka to tḥa, and is golden-coloured;</p>  
 <p>The viśuddhi lotus is sixteen-petalled, with the vowels, and has the light of the moon; the Mātra <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">1</font></a> lotus is two-petalled, has the letters ha and kṣa, and is red in colour; the one at the top of the head is the most resplendent, this lotus has a thousand petals, and is the seat of truth and bliss, ever auspicious, light-possessing and eternal.</p>  
 <p>76. One should meditate, in order, in the chakras, on Gaṇeṣa, on Vidhi, <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">2</font></a> on Viṣhṇu, on Śiva, on Jīva, on Guru, and on Parambrahmaṇ, all-pervading.</p>  
 <p>17-80. It is said by the wise that the subtle movements of the breath in one day and night number twenty-one thousand six hundred.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p>It goes out with the sound of "ha," and enters again with the sound of "sa." The individual is, indeed, always repeating the mantra. "Haṁsa, haṁsa,"--</p>  
 <p>Six hundred for Gaṇeśa; six thousand for Vedhas <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">1</font></a>; six thousand for Hari <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">2</font></a>; six thousand for Hara. <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>A thousand for the Jīvātman; a thousand for Guru; a thousand or the Chidātman;--thus one should understand the respective numbers of the repetitions.</p>  
 <p>81-82. Aruṇa and other sages, who know the succession of Teachers, meditate upon the deities presiding over the chakras, who are rays of Brahmaṇ.</p>  
 <p>The sages, Śuka and ethers, teach it to their pupils; therefore a wise man, after meditating upon the path of the Great Ones, should always meditate thus.</p>  
 <p>83. Having worshipped mentally in all the chakras, with unwavering mind, he should repeat the Ajapā-gāyatrī according to the instructions of the Teacher.</p>  
 <p>84-88. He should meditate in the Ranḍhra, with the thousand-petalled lotus inverted, upon the Blessed Teacher within the Haṁsa, whose lotus-hand frees from fear.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>He should regard his body as being washed in the flow of nectar from His feet. Having worshipped in the five-fold way he should prostrate, singing His praise.</p>  
 <p>Then he should meditate on the Kuṇḍalinī, as moving upwards and downwards, as making a tour of the six chakras, placed in three-and-a-half coils.</p>  
 <p>Then he should meditate on the place called Suṣumnā, which goes out of the Randhra; thereby he goes to the highest state of Viṣṇu.</p>  
 <p>Then he should always meditate, between four o'clock and sunrise, on my form, self-illumined, eternal and ever-blissful.</p>  
 <p>89. He should bring his mind to a state of steadiness, not by efforts alone, but under the instruction of a teacher, without whom he falls.</p>  
 <p>90. Having done the inward-sacrifice he should perform the outward-sacrifice. Having done the purificatory ablution, and the Sandhyā, he should worship Hari and Hara.</p>  
 <p>91-94. For those who are attached to the body facing-inward <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">1</font></a> does not come about. For then devotion is easier, and that gives liberation.</p>  
 <p>Tapas, and Yoga, and others, are also ways to liberation, but for those who are attached to the world of change the path by devotion to me is far superior.</p>  
 <p>This is the conclusion of the all-knowing Brahma and others, after having conned the Vedas and the Śāstras for three periods.</p>  
 <p>Sacrifices and other righteous duties purify the mind. The devotion to me has a form of fruit from which the obtainer never falls away.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></a></p>  
 <p>95. The good man who follows this, O Tārkṣya, by the union due to devotion to me, goes to eternal liberation.</p>
