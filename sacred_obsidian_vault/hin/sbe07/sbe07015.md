 <p>2. All (other) sorts of poison must be avoided (in administering this ordeal),</p>
 <p>3. Except poison from the <i>Sri</i><u>n</u>ga tree, which grows on the Himâlayas.</p>
 <p>4. (Of that) the judge must give seven grains, mixed with clarified butter, to the defendant (while reciting the prayer hereafter mentioned).</p>
 <p>5. If the poison is digested easily, without violent symptoms, he shall recognise him as innocent, and dismiss him at the end of the day.</p>
 <p>6. 'On account of thy venomous and dangerous nature thou art destruction to all living creatures; thou, O poison, knowest what mortals, do not comprehend.</p>
 <p>7. 'This man being arraigned in a cause, desires to be cleared from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'</p>
