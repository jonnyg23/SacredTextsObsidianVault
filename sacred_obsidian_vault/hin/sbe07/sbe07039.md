 <p>1. Setting one's self up by false statements (as by saying, 'I have done this,' or the like).</p>
 <p>2. Making statements, which will reach the ears of the king, regarding a (minor) offence committed by some one;</p>
 <p>3. Unjustly upbraiding a Guru (as by saying 'You have neglected such a household duty');</p>

 <p>1. 'But if a man who does not know all the four Vedas says, in order to procure a valuable present or some other advantage, 'I know the four Vedas,' or if he says of another, his superior in caste or sacred knowledge, in order too prevent his receiving a valuable present, 'This man is no Brâhma<i>n</i>a,' or 'He does not know anything,' in all such cases his crime is equal to the killing of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.' (Nand.)</p>
 <p>2. 'But giving information of a heavy crime constitutes a crime equal to the killing of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.' (Nand.)</p>
 <p>3. Guru means 'father' here. Heavy reproaches, as e. g. if a son says to his father, 'You have made unequal shares in dividing the patrimony,' are equal to killing a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>4. 'But atheistical detracting from the authority of the Veda constitutes a crime equal to the drinking of spirituous liquor.' (Nand.)</p>
 <p>6. The use of the particle <i>k</i>a indicates that distant relatives are also intended here, as Yâ<i>g</i>ñavalkya, III, 239, states.' (Nand.)]</p>

 <p>9. Sexual intercourse with another man's wife;</p>
 <p>10. Sacrificing for persons for whom it is forbidden to sacrifice (such as <i>S</i>ûdras, persons for whom the initiation has not been performed, and the like);</p>
 <p>11. To live by a forbidden occupation (as, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a lives by the occupation of a Kshatriya, or of a Vai<i>s</i>ya).</p>
 <p>12. Receiving unlawful presents;</p>
 <p>13. Killing a Kshatriya, or a Vai<i>s</i>ya, or a <i>S</i>ûdra, or a cow;</p>

 <p>19. To allow the proper time for the ceremony of initiation to pass without being initiated;</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[10. 'But sacrificing for an outcast is a high crime.' (Nand.)</p>
 <p>12. This rule refers to receiving presents from an outcast or other person, whose gifts must not be accepted, to receiving improper gifts, such as a ram, or a black antelope, and to receiving presents at an improper place, such as Kurukshetra, or at an improper time, such as during an eclipse of the sun. The particle <i>k</i>a further refers to giving instruction to those who are not entitled to receive it, as Yama mentions. (Nand.)]</p>

 <p>24. Cutting trees, shrubs, creepers, long climbing plants (such as vines), or herbs;</p>
 <p>25. Living by (prostituting) one's own wife;</p>
 <p>26. Trying to overcome another by incantations (tending to kill him), or by forcible means;</p>
 <p>27. Performing the act (of cooking) for one's own sole benefit;</p>
 <p>28. Not to have kindled one's own sacred fire;</p>

 <p>32. Subsisting by a reprehensible art (such as dancing);</p>
 <p>33. Intercourse with women who drink spirits;</p>
 <p>34. Thus have the crimes in the fourth degree been enumerated.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[20. it is true that the above definition of an Upâdhyâya (XXIX, 2) implies that teaching the Veda for a fee is no reprehensible act; but that permission has reference to cases of distress only. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>26. Nand. asserts that the particle <i>k</i>a is used here in order to include the performance of an Ahîna sacrifice and of the other sinful acts mentioned by Manu, XI, 198.</p>
 <p>31. Atheism (nâstikatâ) consists in denying the existence of another life. (Nand.)]</p>
 </font><p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p>
 <p>35. Such criminals in the fourth degree shall perform the <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a or Parâka penances, or shall sacrifice a cow (as the case may require).</p>
