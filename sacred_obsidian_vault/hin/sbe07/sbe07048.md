 <p>9. <sup>1</sup> Nand. thinks that the word iti, 'thus,' has a double meaning {footnote p. 150} here, and refers to another kind of Aghamarshana penance at the same time, which is described by <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kha, and consists simply in fasting for three days and muttering the Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a hymn three times.]</p>

 <p>10. Let a man for three days eat in the evening only; for other three days, in the morning only; for further three days, food (given to him) unsolicited; (and let him fast entirely for three days): that is the Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya (the penance invented by Pra<i>g</i>âpati).</p>
 <p>11. Let him drink for three days hot water; for other three days, hot clarified butter; and for further three days, hot milk; and let him fast for three days: that is the Taptak<i>rikkh</i>ra (hot penance).</p>
 <p>12. Taking the same (liquids) cold is called the <i>S</i>îtak<i>rikkh</i>ra (cold penance).</p>
 <p>13. The K<i>rikkh</i>râtik<i>rikkh</i>ra (the most difficult penance) consists in subsisting on milk only for twenty-one days.</p>
 <p>14. Eating (nothing but) ground barley mixed with water for a whole month is called the Udakak<i>rikkh</i>ra (water penance).</p>
 <p>15. Eating nothing but lotus-fibres (for a whole month) is called the Mûlak<i>rikkh</i>ra (root penance).</p>
 <p>16. Eating nothing but Bèl fruit (for a whole month) is called the <i>S</i>rîphalak<i>rikkh</i>ra (Bèl fruit penance).</p>
 <p>17. Or<sup>[1]</sup> (this penance is performed) by (eating) lotus-seeds.</p>
 <p>18. A total fast for twelve days is called Parâka.</p>
 <p>19. Subsisting for one day on the urine and fæces of a cow, milk, sour milk, butter, and water</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[17. <sup>1</sup> According to Nand., the particle vâ, 'or,' here indicates another alternative, that of performing this penance with Âmalakas (Emblica Officinalis Gaertn.)]</p>
 </font><p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>
 <p>in which Ku<i>s</i>a grass has been boiled, and fasting the next day, is called Sântapana (the tormenting penance).</p>
 <p>20. Swallowing (the same six things, viz.) cow-urine and the rest, each for one day, is called Mahâsântapana (the particularly tormenting penance).</p>
 <p>21. Swallowing each for three days is called Atisântapana (the extremely tormenting penance).</p>
 <p>22. Swallowing oil-cakes, foam of boiled rice, buttermilk, water, and ground barley (each for one day), with a fasting day between (every, two days), is called Tulâpurusha (a man's weight).</p>
 <p>23. Drinking water boiled with Kusa grass, leaves of the Palâsa and Udumbara trees, of lotuses, of the <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>khapushpî plant, of the banyan tree, and of the Brahmasuvar<i>k</i>alâ plant, each (for one day), is called Par<i>n</i>ak<i>rikkh</i>ra (leaves penance).</p>
 <p>24. Let a man perform all those penances after having shorn his hair and his beard, and let him bathe at morning, noon, and evening every day, lying on a low couch, and restraining his passions,</p>
 <p>25. And let him (while engaged in performing them) avoid to converse with women, <i>S</i>ûdras, or outcasts, and let him constantly, to the best of his ability, mutter purifying Ma<i>n</i>tras and make oblations in the fire.</p>
