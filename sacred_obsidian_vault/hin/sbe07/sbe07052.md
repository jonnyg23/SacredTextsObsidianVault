 <font size="2"><p>[8. <sup>1</sup> Nand. infers from texts of Pra<i>k</i>etas, Yama, and Parâ<i>s</i>ara, that the particle vâ, 'or,' here refers to pregnant cows, and to women whose confinement is close at hand, or who are married to one who has kindled his sacred fire, or for whom all the sacred rites have been duly performed from their birth.</p>
 <p>19. <sup>1</sup> Nand. refers the particle vâ, 'or,' to women of high rank and to a rival wife, or a mother, or a daughter, or a sister, or a daughter-in-law, or a wife, who is of the same caste as her husband.</p>
 <p>10. <sup>1</sup> 'The particle vâ includes children here.' (Nand.)</p>
 <p>18. <sup>1</sup> According to Nand., the particle <i>k</i>a here refers to the {footnote p. 159} precept of Parâ<i>s</i>ara, that he should drink water when the cows drink, and lie down when they lie down.]</p>

 <p>22. Let him wash himself with cow-urine (three times a day);</p>
 <p>23. And<sup>[1]</sup> let him subsist upon the (five) productions of a cow:</p>
 <p>24. This is the Govrata (cow rite), which must be performed by him who has (unintentionally) killed a cow (belonging to a Kshatriya).</p>
 <p>25. If a man has killed an elephant (intentionally), he must give five black (nîla) bulls.</p>
 <p>26. If he has killed (unintentionally) a horse, he must give a garment.</p>

 <p>29. If he has (intentionally) killed a camel, he must give one K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>ala of gold.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[19. <sup>1</sup> According to Nand., the particle <i>k</i>a here implies another precept of Parâ<i>s</i>ara, that he should not take notice of a cow grazing or drinking water upon his own ground or that of another.</p>
 <p>23. <sup>1</sup> 'The particle <i>k</i>a, implies that he should also mutter the Gomatî hymn, as <i>S</i>âtâtapa says.' (Nand.)</p>

 <p>40. If he has (unintentionally) killed a wild carnivorous animal, he must give a milch cow.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[35. <sup>1</sup> Thus according to Nand., who declares himself against the interpretation of sha<i>nd</i>a by 'a eunuch;' see, however, Kullûka on M. XI, 134, and Dr. Bühler's rendering of Gaut. XXII, 23.--<sup>2</sup> Nand. adds, 'and a Mâsha of lead;' see the passages just referred to.]</p>

 <p>46. If he has killed a thousand (small) animals having bones, or an ox-load of animals that have no bones, he must perform the same penance as for killing a <i>S</i>ûdra.</p>
 <p>47. But, if he has killed animals having bones, he must (moreover) give some trifle to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (for each animal which he has killed); if he has killed boneless animals, he becomes purified by one stopping of the breath.</p>
