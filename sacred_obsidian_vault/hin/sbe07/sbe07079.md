 <p>1. The sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac, to another;</p>
 <p>2. The two equinoctial points;</p>
 <p>3. The two solstitial points particularly;</p>
 <p>4. The (Yoga) Vyatîpâta;</p>
 <p>5. The constellation under which (the sacrificer himself, or his wife, or his son) is born;</p>
 <p>6. A time of rejoicing (as, when a son has been born, or another happy event happened):</p>
 <p>7. These occasions for a <i>S</i>râddha the lord of creatures has pronounced optional; a <i>S</i>râddha which is performed on these occasions gives infinite satisfaction (to the manes).</p>
 <p>8. No <i>S</i>râddha must be performed in the twilight or at night by an intelligent man. A <i>S</i>râddha may be performed at those times also when an eclipse (of the sun or of the moon) takes place.</p>
 <p>9. For a <i>S</i>râddha which is offered them at the time of an eclipse satisfies the manes, as long as the moon and the stars exist, and procures immense advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires to the sacrificer.</p>
