 <p>1. The following persons sanctify a company:</p>
 <p>2. A Tri<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>iketa;</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[27. See LXIV, 5, note.</p>
 <p>29. The particle <i>k</i>a here refers to the following further persons mentioned in a Sm<i>ri</i>ti, a shepherd, one who lives by the prostitution of his own wife, the husband of a woman who had another husband before, and one employed to carry out dead bodies. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>LXXXIII. 1-19. M. III, 128-148, 183-146; Y. I, 219-221; Âpast. II, 7, 17, 22; Gaut. XV, 28.</p>
 <p>2. Nand. has two explanations of the term Tri<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>iketa: 1. One who has thrice kindled the Nâ<i>k</i>iketa fire. 2. One who has studied, {footnote p. 254} in consequence of a vow, the portion of the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda called Tri<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>iketa. See Âpast. II, 7, 17, 22, with Dr. Bühler's note, and the Petersburg Dictionary.]</p>

 <p>3. One who keeps five fires;</p>
 <p>4. One who can sing the Sâmans called <i>G</i>yesh<i>th</i>a;</p>
 <p>5. One who has studied the whole Veda;</p>
 <p>6. One who has studied one Vedâ<u>n</u>ga;</p>
 <p>7. One who has studied either the Purâ<i>n</i>as (Legends), or the Itihâsas (Epics), or grammar;</p>
 <p>8. One who has studied one of the Dharma<i>s</i>âstras (Institutes of the Sacred Law);</p>
 <p>9. One purified by visiting sacred places of pilgrimage;</p>
 <p>10. One purified by offering sacrifices;</p>
 <p>11. One purified by austere devotion;</p>
 <p>12. One purified by veracity;</p>
 <p>13. One purified by (constantly muttering) Mantras;</p>
 <p>14. One intent upon muttering the <i>G</i>âyatrî;</p>
 <p>15. One in whose family the study and teaching of the Veda are hereditary.</p>
 <p>16. One who knows the Trisupar<i>n</i>a (the text which thrice contains the word Supar<i>n</i>a).</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[4. Sâma-veda II, 209-211, &amp;c.</p>
 <p>7. Grammar is again mentioned here, although it forms part of the Vedâ<u>n</u>gas mentioned in Sûtra 6. But there the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhyas are meant. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>8. The number of the Sm<i>ri</i>tis or Dharma<i>s</i>âstras, according to Nand., amounts to fifty-seven. The now current tradition gives thirty-six as their number; but upwards of a hundred works of this description must have been actually in existence. See Dr. Bühler's Introduction to the Bombay Digest, p. xii seq.</p>
 <p>16. See above, LVI, 22 3, and Dr. Bühler's note on Âpast. loc. cit. Nand. proposes another interpretation also of the term Trisupar<i>n</i>a, 6 one who has thrice kindled a fire in honour of Supar<i>n</i>a.']</p>

 <p>17. A son-in-law;</p>
 <p>18. And a grandson. All these persons are worthy (to be fed at a <i>S</i>râddha);</p>
 <p>19. And, particularly, devotees.</p>
 <p>20, There is a stanza recited by the manes, which refers to this subject:</p>
 <p>21. 'May that man be born to our race, who feeds a Brâhma<i>n</i>a devotee assiduously at a <i>S</i>râddha, by which repast we are satisfied ourselves.'</p>
