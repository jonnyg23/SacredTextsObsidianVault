 <p>2. Nor a <i>S</i>ûdra by a member of a twice-born caste.</p>
 <p>3. A father and a mother shall be carried out by their sons (who are equal in caste to their parents).</p>
 <p>4. But <i>S</i>ûdras must never carry out a member of a twice-born caste, even though he be their father.</p>
 <p>5. Those Brâhma<i>n</i>as who carry out (or follow the corpse of) a (deceased) Brâhma<i>n</i>a who has no relatives shall attain a mansion in heaven.</p>
 <p>6. Those who have carried out a dead relative and burnt his corpse, shall walk round the pile from left to right, and then plunge into water, dressed in their clothes.</p>

 <p>bite Nimba leaves between their teeth, and having stepped upon the stone threshold, they must enter the house.</p>
 <p>9. Then they must throw unbroken grains into the fire.</p>
 <p>10. On the fourth day they must collect the bones that have been left.</p>
 <p>11. And they must throw them into water from the Ganges.</p>
 <p>12. As many bones of a man are contained in the water of the Ganges, so many thousands of years will he reside in heaven.</p>
 <p>13. While the term of impurity lasts, they must continually offer a libation of water and a ball of rice to the deceased.</p>
 <p>14. And they must eat food which has been bought, or which they have received unsolicited.</p>
 <p>15. And they, must eat no meat.</p>
 <p>16. And they must sleep on the ground.</p>
 <p>17. And they must sleep apart.</p>
 <p>18. When the impurity is over, they must walk forth from the village, have their beards shaved, and having cleansed themselves with a paste of sesamum, or with a paste of mustard-seed, they must change their dress and re-enter the house.</p>

 <p>15. Nand. refers the particle <i>k</i>a to an implied prohibition to eat fish, which he quotes from a text of Gautama (not found in his Institutes).]</p>

 <p>20. The gods are invisible deities, the Brâhma<i>n</i>as are visible deities.</p>
 <p>21. The Brâhma<i>n</i>as sustain the world.</p>
 <p>22. It is by the favour of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as that the gods reside in heaven; a speech uttered by Brâhma<i>n</i>as (whether a curse or a benediction) never fails to come true.</p>
 <p>23. What the Brâhma<i>n</i>as pronounce, when highly pleased (as, if they promise sons, cattle, wealth, or some other boon to a man), the gods will ratify; when the visible gods are pleased, the invisible gods are surely pleased as well.</p>
 <p>24. The mourners, who lament the loss of a relative, shall be addressed by men gifted with a tranquil frame of mind with such consolatory speeches as I shall now recite to thee, O Earth, who art cherished to my, mind.</p>
