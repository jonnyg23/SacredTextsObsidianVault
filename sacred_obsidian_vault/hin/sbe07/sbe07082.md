 <p>1. Sesamum, rice, barley, beans, water, roots, fruits, vegetables, <i>S</i>yâmâka grain, millet, wild rice, kidney-beans, and wheat satisfy (the manes) for a month;</p>
 <p>2. The flesh of fishes (excepting those species that are forbidden), for two months;</p>
 <p>3. The flesh of the common deer, for three months;</p>
 <p>4. The flesh of sheep, for four months;</p>
 <p>5. The flesh of birds (of those kinds that may be eaten), for five months;</p>
 <p>6. The flesh of goats, for six months;</p>
 <p>7. The flesh of the spotted deer, for seven months;</p>
 <p>8. The flesh of the spotted antelope, for eight months;</p>
 <p>9. Beef, for nine months;</p>
 <p>10. Buffalo's meat, for ten months;</p>
 <p>11. The meat of a hornless goat, for eleven months;</p>
 <p>12. The milk of a cow, or preparations from it, for a year.</p>
 <p>13. On this subject there exists a stanza, which the manes utter:</p>
 <p>14. '(The pot-herb) Kâla<i>s</i>âka (sacred basil), (the prawn) Mahâ<i>s</i>alka, and the flesh of the (crane called) Vârdhrî<i>n</i>asa<sup>[1]</sup>, (and of) a rhinoceros having no horn, is food which we always accept.'</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[LXXX. 1-14. M. III, 267-272; Y. I, 257-259; Âpast. II, 7, 16, 23-II, 7, 17, 3; II, 8, 18, 13; Gaut. XV, 19.</p>
 <p>14. <sup>1</sup> This is the first of the two interpretations which Nand. proposes of the term Vârdhrî<i>n</i>asa. It is supported by Âpastamba's {footnote p. 250} commentator, Haradatta, and by Âpastamba himself (I, 5, 17, 36). Nand.'s second interpretation, 'an old white goat,' is probably wrong, although it is supported by the authority of Kullûka and Vi<i>g</i>ñâne<i>s</i>vara.]</p>
