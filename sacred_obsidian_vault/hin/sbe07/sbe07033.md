 <p>1. A man has three Atigurus (or specially venerable superiors):</p>
 <p>2. His father, his mother, and his spiritual teacher.</p>
 <p>3. To them he must always pay obedience.</p>
 <p>4. What they say, that he must do.</p>
 <p>5. And he must do what is agreeable and serviceable to them.</p>
 <p>6. Let him never do anything without their leave.</p>
 <p>7. Those three are equal to the three Vedas (<i>Ri</i>g-veda, Sâma-veda, and Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda), they are equal to the three gods (Brahman, Vish<i>n</i>u, and Siva), they are equal to the three worlds (of men, of gods, and of Brahman), they are equal to the three fires.</p>
 <p>8. The father is the Gârhapatya (or household) fire, the mother is the Dakshi<i>n</i>a (or ceremonial) fire, and the spiritual teacher is the Âhavanîya (or sacrificial) fire.</p>
 <p>9. He pays regard to all his duties, who pays regard to those three; he who shows no regard to</p>

 <p>9. 'The father is said to be of the same nature as the Gârhapatya fire, because the Âhavanîya is produced from it; the mother is said to be of the same nature as the Dakshi<i>n</i>a fire, because it {footnote p. 129} has a separate origin, or because she has the sacrificial implements, such as the pestle and mortar and the like, in her charge; and the spiritual teacher is said to be of the same nature as the Âhavanîya fire, because all oblations fall to his share, as the Sm<i>ri</i>ti says (Y. I, 27), "Let him (the pupil) deliver to him (the teacher) the collected alms."' (Nand.)]</p>

 <p>them, derives no benefit from any religious observance.</p>
 <p>10. By honouring his mother, he gains the present world; by honouring his father, the world of gods; and by paying strict obedience to his spiritual teacher, the world of Brahman.</p>
