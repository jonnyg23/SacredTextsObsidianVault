 <p>1. The (twelve) days of new moon, the three Ash<i>t</i>akâs, the three Anvash<i>t</i>akâs, a Mâgha day (i.e. 'day on which the moon enters the lunar asterism Maghâ'), which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month Praush<i>th</i>apada, and the two seasons when rice and barley grow ripe (or autumn and spring):</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[7. The Mantras are those quoted above, in Chapters LXXIII and LXXIV. They have to be modified, i. e. the names of the maternal ancestors must be put in, and the verb &amp;c. of the sentence be altered accordingly. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>LXXVI. I. M. III, 122, 273, 281; IV, 150; Y. I, 217, 260; Gaut. XV, 2; Âpast. II, 7, 16, 4-6.</p>
 <p>1. Nand. infers from a passage of Â<i>s</i>valâyana (G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra II, 4, 3) that <i>S</i>râddhas to be offered on the day before each Ash<i>t</i>akâ are also intended here. See, however, note on LXXIII, 9. The same proposes two explanations of the term Mâghî: 1. It has to be separated from the following words, and refers directly to the day of full moon in the month Mâgha, and indirectly to the days of full moon in Âshâ<i>dh</i>a, Kârttika, and Vai<i>s</i>âkha as well, as indicated in a passage of the Brâhma-purâna. 2. It has to be connected with the clause following it. This latter interpretation, on which the rendering given above is based, is supported by Mann (III, 273,274), {footnote p. 241} Yâ<i>g</i>ñavalkya, (I, 260), according to the interpretations of Kullûka and Vigñâne<i>s</i>vara, and by the Vish<i>n</i>u-sûtra itself (LXXVIII, 52).]</p>

 <p>2. Thus have the regular times for a Srâddha been declared by the lord of creatures. He who fails to perform a <i>S</i>râddha on those days, goes to hell.</p>
