 <p>4. Nand. derives the term Raurava from 'ruru, a kind of serpent.' But it seems preferable to connect it with the root ru, 'to howl.'</p>
 <p>6. This hell is defined by Nand. as a kind of threshing-place, made of copper, burning hot, and measuring ten thousand Yo<i>g</i>anas.</p>
 <p>8. In this hell those who have perished in consequence of the tortures which they had to undergo are restored to life and tortured anew. (Nand.)]</p>

 <p>20. This river, which contains hot water, is called Vaitara<i>n</i>î, as it is said, The river called Vaitara<i>n</i>î has a stinking odour, is full of blood, and is moving on swiftly a torrent of hot water, carrying bones and hair in its course.'

 <p>31. Those who have committed one of the miscellaneous crimes, for a great number of years;</p>
 <p>32. All sinners who have committed (one of those nine kinds of) crimes have to suffer terrible pangs, when they have departed life and entered upon the path of Yama.</p>

 <p>34. (There) they are devoured by dogs and jackals, by hawks, crows, herons, cranes, and other (carnivorous animals), by (bears and other) animals having fire in their mouth, and by serpents and scorpions.</p>
 <p>35. They are scorched by blazing fire, pierced by thorns, divided into parts by saws, and tormented by thirst.</p>
 <p>36. They are agitated by hunger and by fearful troops of tigers, and faint away. at every step on account of the foul stenches proceeding from pus and from blood.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[31. 'A great number of years' means three hundred years. (Nand.)]</p>
 </font><p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>

 <p>38. Here they are boiled in oil, and there pounded with pestles, or ground in iron or stone vessels.</p>
 <p>39. In one place they (are made to) eat what has been vomited, or pus, or blood, or excrements, and in another place, meat of a hideous kind, smelling like pus.</p>
 <p>40. Here, enveloped in terrible darkness, they are devoured by worms and (jackals and other) horrible animals having flames in their mouth.</p>

 <p>42. In one place they are beaten with their deeds in a former existence, in another they are suspended (by trees and the like, with a rope), or shot with heaps of arrows, or cut in pieces.</p>
 <p>43. In another place again, walking upon thorns, and their bodies being encircled by snakes, they are tormented with (grinding) machines, and dragged on by their knees.</p>
 <p>44. Their backs, heads, and shoulders are fractured, the necks of these poor beings are not stouter than a needle, and their bodies, of a size fit for a hut only, are unable to bear torments.</p>
