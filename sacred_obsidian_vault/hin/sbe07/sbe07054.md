 <p>3. <sup>1</sup> See L, 1-5.</p>
 <p>5. <sup>1</sup> By dhana, 'valuable objects,' the objects mentioned below (in 10.), copper and the rest, are meant. (Nand.)--<sup>2</sup> Nand. does not explain the meaning of K<i>rikkh</i>ra, which is a general term for 'a heavy penance.' It probably denotes the Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya penance here, as in a number of other law texts (e. g. below, LIV, 26), and in the corresponding text of Manu in particular. See Kullûka on M. XI, 163.</p>
 <p>8-13. Nand. explains that these Sûtras refer to a small amount of those articles which are mentioned in them.]</p>

 <p>(milk or other) drinks, a bed, a seat, flowers, roots, or fruit, drinking Pañ<i>k</i>agavya (is ordained as penance).</p>

 <p>12. For stealing two-hoofed or one-hoofed animals, he must fast for three days.</p>
 <p>13. For stealing birds, or perfumes, or medicinal herbs, or cords, or basket-work, he must fast for one day.</p>
 <p>14. Though a thief may have restored to the owner the stolen property (either openly or) in some indirect manner<sup>[1]</sup>, he must still perform a penance, in order to purify himself from guilt.</p>
 <p>15. Whatever a man takes from others, unchecked (by the dictates of religion), of that will he be bereft in every future birth.</p>
 <p>16. Because life, religious merit, and pleasure depend upon wealth, therefore let a man take care not to injure the wealth (of others by robbing them) by any means.</p>
 <p>17. Among those two, he who injures animal life, and be who injures wealth, the one who injures wealth shall incur the heavier penalty.</p>
