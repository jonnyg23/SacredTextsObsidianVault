 <font size="2"><p>[1. <sup>1</sup> Literally 'eat,' adyât. In 16 and 17 the synonymous verbs bhaksh and a<i>s</i> are used. Nevertheless it can hardly be doubted that both of the two modes of cleaning the teeth, which appear to have been customary, are indicated in this chapter: the one consisting in brushing them with little sticks or twigs provided with a brush (see 16), the other in chewing twigs. Unfortunately the reading of Nand.'s gloss on the term sakûr<i>k</i>a in 16 is uncertain.</p>
