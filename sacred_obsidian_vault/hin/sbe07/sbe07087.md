 <p>1. A <i>S</i>râddha offered at the (Tîrtha or place of pilgrimage called) Pushkaras confers eternal bliss upon the giver;</p>
 <p>2. And so does the muttering of prayers, the offering of burnt-oblations, and the practice of austerities in that place.</p>
 <p>3. Even by merely bathing at Pushkara he is purified from all his sins.</p>
 <p>4. The same effect may be produced at <i>G</i>ayâ<i>s</i>îrsha;</p>
 <p>5. And near Va<i>t</i>a (Akshayava<i>t</i>a);</p>
 <p>6. And on the Amaraka<i>nt</i>aka mountain;</p>
 <p>7. And on the Varâha mountain;</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[LXXXV. 1. Pushkara, according to the common acceptation of the term, is the name of a celebrated place of pilgrimage near A<i>g</i>mîr, the modern Pokur. See Lassen, Indian Antiquities, I, 113. Nand. quotes a Smriti passage to the effect that there are three Pushkaras, and a passage of the Mahâbhârata, in which it is stated that one Pushkara is sacred to Brahman, another to Vish<i>n</i>u, and a third to Rudra.</p>
 <p>3. Nand. asserts with regard to the use of the name Pushkara in the singular number in this Sûtra, that it means even a single bath has the consequence here mentioned.</p>
 <p>4. Gayâ<i>s</i>îrsha is the name of a mountain near Gayâ in Bihâr, a celebrated place of pilgrimage. Compare Yâ<i>g</i>ñavalkya I, 260.</p>
 <p>5. There exists one Akshayava<i>t</i>a in Bihâr (Nand.) and another in Prayâga (Allahabad). The 'undecaying banyan-tree' (Aksbay Ba<i>t</i>) is an object of worship at Allahabad even now, and was so already in the times of Hwen Thsang. See Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 389; St. Julien, Voyages des Pèlerins Bouddhistes, II, 278.</p>
 <p>6. Nand. states that both the Tîrtha called Amaraka<i>nt</i>aka on the Mekalâ mountain in the Vindhya range and the whole mountain of that name are meant.</p>
 <p>7. 'This is a certain boar shaped mountain.' (Nand.) It seems very probable that the Tîrtha of Bâramûla, the ancient Varâhamûla {footnote p. 257} in Ka<i>s</i>mîr, is meant. See Bühler, Ka<i>s</i>mîr Report, p. 12, where a 'Varâha hill' is mentioned as adjacent to that town.]</p>
