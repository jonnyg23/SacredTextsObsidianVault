 <p>1. If there are four sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (springing from four different wives) of the four castes, they shall divide the whole estate of their father into ten parts.</p>
 <p>2. Of these, let the soil of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a wife take four parts;</p>
 <p>3. The son of the Kshatriya wife, three parts;</p>
 <p>4. The son of the Vai<i>s</i>ya wife, two parts;</p>
 <p>5. The son of the <i>S</i>ûdra wife, a single part.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[22. My rendering of this Sloka is based upon Kullûka's interpretation of the identical passage of Manu (IX, 200), which is supported by Vi<i>g</i>ñânesvara (Mitâksharâ I, 4, 19 in Colebrooke's version), Mâdhava (Burnell, Dâya-Vibhâga 51), Varadarâ<i>g</i>a (Burnell, Varadarâ<i>g</i>a's Vyavahâranîr<i>n</i>aya 49), and others. Nand. proposes a different interpretation, on which rests Dr. Bühler's rendering, 'Those ornaments, which the wives usually wear, should not be divided by the heirs whilst the husbands are alive.'</p>

 <p>6. Again, if there are three sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (by wives of different castes), but no son by a <i>S</i>ûdra (wife) among them, they shall divide the estate into nine parts.</p>
 <p>7. (Of these) let them take, each in the order of his caste, shares amounting to four, three, and two parts of the whole respectively.</p>
 <p>8. (If there are three sons by wives of different castes, but) no Vai<i>s</i>ya among them, they shall divide the estate into eight parts, and take four parts, three parts, and one part respectively.</p>
 <p>9. (If there are three sons, but) no Kshatriya among them, they shall divide it into seven parts, and take four parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.</p>
 <p>10. If there is no Brâhma<i>n</i>a, among them, they hall divide it into six parts, and take three parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.</p>
 <p>11. If there are sons of a Kshatriya by a Kshatriya, a Vai<i>s</i>ya, and a <i>S</i>ûdra wife, the mode of division shall be the same (i.e. the estate shall be divided into six parts, &amp;c.)</p>
 <p>12. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the one belonging to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a and the other to the Kshatriya caste, they shall divide the estate into seven parts; and of these the Brâhma<i>n</i>a son shall take four parts;</p>
 <p>13. The Kshatriya son, three parts.</p>
 <p>14. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and the one belongs to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a and the other to the Vai<i>s</i>ya caste, the estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall take four parts;</p>
 <p>15. The Vai<i>s</i>ya, two parts.</p>
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a></p>
 <p>10. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and the one belongs to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a and the other to the <i>S</i>ûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into five parts;</p>
 <p>17. And of these, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall take four parts;</p>
 <p>18. The <i>S</i>ûdra, a single part.</p>
 <p>19. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a or a Kshatriya, and the one belongs to the Kshatriya and the other to the <i>S</i>ûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into five parts;</p>
 <p>90. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;</p>
 <p>21. The <i>S</i>ûdra, one part.</p>
 <p>22. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a or a Kshatriya, and the one belongs to the Kshatriya, the other to the <i>S</i>ûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into four parts;</p>
 <p>23. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;</p>
 <p>24. The <i>S</i>ûdra, a single part.</p>
 <p>25. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a or a Vai<i>s</i>ya or a <i>S</i>ûdra, and the one belongs to the Vai<i>s</i>ya, the other to the <i>S</i>ûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into three parts;</p>
 <p>26. And of these, the Vai<i>s</i>ya shall take two parts;</p>
 <p>27. The <i>S</i>ûdra, a single part,</p>
 <p>28. If a Brâhma<i>n</i>a has an only son, he shall take the whole estate, provided he be a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, Kshatriya, or Vai<i>s</i>ya.</p>
 <p>29. If a Kshatriya has (an only son who is) either a Kshatriya or a Vai<i>s</i>ya, (the rule shall be the same.)</p>
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>
 <p>30. If a Vai<i>s</i>ya has (an only son who is) Vai<i>s</i>ya, (the rule shall also be the same);</p>
 <p>31. (And so shall the only) son of a <i>S</i>ûdra (be sole heir) to his <i>S</i>ûdra (father).</p>
 <p>32. A <i>S</i>ûdra, who is the only son of a father belonging to a twice-born caste, shall inherit one-half of his property;</p>
 <p>33. The other half shall devolve in the same way as the property of one who died without leaving issue.</p>
 <p>34. Mothers shall receive shares proportionate to their son's shares;</p>
 <p>35. And so shall unmarried daughters.</p>
 <p>36. Sons, who are equal in caste (to their father), shall receive equal shares.</p>
 <p>37. A best part (the twentieth part of the inheritance, &amp;c.) shall be given to the eldest, as his additional share.</p>
 <p>38. If there are two sons by a Brâhma<i>n</i>a and one by a <i>S</i>ûdra wife, the estate shall be divided into nine parts; and of these, the two sons of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a wife shall take two parts, the one son of the <i>S</i>ûdra wife, a single part.</p>
 <p>39. If there are two sons by a <i>S</i>ûdra, and one son by a Brâhma<i>n</i>a wife, the estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the son of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a wife shall take four parts, and the two sons of the <i>S</i>ûdra wife together shall take two parts.</p>
 <p>40. Upon the same principles the shares have to be adjusted in other cases also.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[33. See XVII, 4 seq.</p>
 <p>34. 'That is to say, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a wife shall take four parts, a Kshatriya wife, three parts,' &amp;c. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>37. See Gaut. XXVIII, 5.]</p>
 </font><p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>
 <p>41. If (brothers), who after a previous division of the estate live again together as parceners, should make a second partition, the shares must be equal in that case, and the eldest has no right to an additional share.</p>
 <p>42. What a brother has acquired by, his own efforts, without using the patrimony, he must not give up (to his brothers or other co-heirs), unless by his own free will; for it was gained by his own exertion.</p>
 <p>43. And if a man recovers (a debt or other property), which could not before be recovered by his father, he shall not, unless by his own free will, divide it with his sons; for it is an acquisition made by himself.</p>
 <p>44. Apparel, vehicles<sup>[1]</sup> (carriages or riding-horses), and ornaments (such as are usually worn according to the custom of the caste), prepared food, water (in a well or pool), females (slaves or mistresses of the deceased), property destined for pious uses or sacrifices, a common pasture-ground<sup>[2]</sup>, and a book, are indivisible.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[42. The term svayamîhitalabdham has been translated according to Kullûka (on M. IX, 208). Nand. interprets this <i>S</i>loka thus, 'What a brother has acquired by his own efforts, and what has been given to him, at his desire (by friends or others), he must not give up,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p>43. Here again I have followed Kullûka (on M. IX, 209), and deviated from Nand.'s interpretation, who renders this Sloka as follows, 'If a man recovers property, &amp;c., or if he gains property by himself (by his learning or valour, &amp;c.) . . . '</p>
 <p>44. <sup>1</sup> The term pattra has been rendered above in accordance with the first interpretation proposed by Nand., and with Kullûka's interpretation (on M. IX, 219). Vi<i>g</i>ñâne<i>s</i>vara (in his comment upon the same passage of Manu) refers it to written documents, such especially as relate to a debt to be paid to the deceased; and {footnote p. 75} this interpretation is mentioned by Nand. also. But there is no reason why an unliquidated demand should not be divided; and written documents are only twice referred to in the code of Manu (VIII, 168, and IX, 232).--<sup>2</sup> in translating the term pra<i>k</i>âra I have again followed Kullûka loc. cit.; see also Petersburg Dictionary s. v. Nand. interprets this term as denoting 'a path leading to or from the house.']</p>
