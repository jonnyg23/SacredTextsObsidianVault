 <p>1. 'This chapter treats of the duties of a Snâtaka (see XXVIII, 42, note). The particle atha, 'now,' however, signifies that some of these duties are common to the Snâtaka and to the householder, whose special duties have been treated in the previous chapters. (Nand.)]</p>

 <p>10. (Even though he lacks firewood or the like necessaries) he must not say to another man,</p>
 <p>have got none.'</p>
 <p>11. He must not wear a garland of flowers which has no smell at all, or an offensive smell, or which is red.</p>

 <p>14. And a jar with water;</p>
 <p>15. And a sacrificial string made of cotton thread;</p>
 <p>16. And two golden ear-rings.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[2. The particle <i>k</i>a refers to ugly persons and the rest, enumerated by Manu IV, 141. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>8. The use of the particle <i>k</i>a implies, according to Nand., that his frame of mind and his speech should also be in conformity with his age, &amp;c., as ordained by Manu IV, 18.</p>
 <p>13-16. Nand., arguing from texts of Baudhâyana and of Manu (IV, 36), takes the use of the particle <i>k</i>a in Sûtras 13 and 14 to {footnote p. 226} imply that a Snâtaka must wear three garments, an under garment, an upper garment, and a mantle, and in Sûtra 16, that he must carry about him a bushel of Ku<i>s</i>a grass.]</p>

 <p>30. Nor at one insane;</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[19. This rule appears to refer, likewise, to the custom of suspending, by a tree or a post, an upper garment or a piece of cloth, in order to ward off the rays of the sun.</p>
 <p>20. The particle <i>k</i>a here is used, according to Nand., in order to include 'the sun, while it is eclipsed,' as mentioned by Manu IV, 37.</p>
 <p>29. 'As, shown by <i>k</i>a, a place where arrows, spears, or other missiles are falling down, is also intended here.' (Nand.)]</p>

 <p>49. Nor (must he give him) the leavings of his food, nor the residue of an oblation (unless he is his own servant);</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[46. Besides the above interpretation of the term bâlâtapa, which is proposed by Kullûka also (on M. IV, 69), Nand. mentions two others: i. the heat of that time of the day when the cows are collected for milking; 2. the heat of the autumn season. The particle <i>k</i>a, according to Nand., is used in order to include the smoke of a burning corpse and the other forbidden objects mentioned by Manu IV, 69.]</p>

 <p>54. He must not reject sour milk or the Sumanas flower (when offered to him).</p>
 <p>55. He must not take off his garland (from his head) himself (but he may cause another to do so).</p>
 <p>56. Let him not rouse (a superior) from sleep.</p>
 <p>57. He must not (by harsh speeches and the like) render disaffected one who is well affected towards him.</p>
 <p>58. He must not speak to a woman in her courses;</p>
 <p>59. Nor to barbarians or low-caste persons.</p>
 <p>60. When a sacred fire, or an idol, or a Brâhma<i>n</i>a is near, he must stretch forth his right hand (from his upper garment).</p>
 <p>61. If he sees a cow trespassing upon another man's field, he must not announce it (to the owner of that field).</p>

 <p>63. He must not endeavour to please overbearing men (by flattering their pretensions).</p>
 <p>64. He must not dwell in a kingdom governed by a <i>S</i>ûdra king;</p>

 </font><p><a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a></p>

 <p>88. He must adorn himself (with garlands, sandal, and the like).</p>
 <p>89. Thus he must observe established customs.</p>
 <p>90. Those customs, which have been explicitly ordained in revealed and in traditional texts, and which are practised by the virtuous, must always be observed by a righteous man with subdued passions.</p>
 <p>91. By adhering to established usage he attains to old age; this is the way to obtain that state in the next life which he desires, and imperishable riches, this is the way to destroy the effect of (bodily) marks foreboding future misfortunes.</p>
 <p>92. He who observes the usages established among the virtuous, who is a believer in revelation, and free from ill-will, lives a hundred years, even</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[84. '"Or repugnant to the final liberation," as the use of the particle <i>k</i>a implies.' (Nand.) See Manu VI, 37.</p>
 <p>85. The use of the particle <i>k</i>a, Nand. argues from Manu IV, 176, implies that acts which may cause future pain should also be avoided.</p>
 <p>88. The use of the particle <i>k</i>a, according to Nand., implies that he must also observe auspicious rites and established customs, as ordained by Manu IV, 145. The latter injunction is, however, expressly given in the next Sûtra.]</p>
