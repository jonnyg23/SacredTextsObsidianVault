But as the first three orders are mentioned in this <i>S</i>loka, it is certainly more natural to translate the term as has been done above.</p>
 <p>29. <sup>1</sup> Nand. thinks that hermits or members of the third order are meant by this term. But it seems preferable to refer it to the <i>Ri</i>shi authors of the Veda, to whom the first of the five sacrifices, the study of the Veda, is more immediately addressed. See Âpast. I, 4, 13, 1; Gaut. V, 3.</p>

 <p>25. The organ must once be cleaned with earth, the hindparts three times, the one hand (the left) ten times, both hands together seven times, and both feet together three times.</p>
 <p>26. Such is the purification ordained for householders; it is double for students treble for hermits; and quadruple for ascetics.</p>
