 <p>1. Receiving anything from a (Mle<i>kkh</i>a or other) despicable person (even though not as a present, but in the form of interest, &amp;c.), traffic (even with articles that are not forbidden to sell), subsisting by money-lending (even without exceeding the legitimate rate of interest), telling lies (even though not in giving evidence), and serving a Sûdra (even though without doing servile acts for him) are crimes rendering unworthy to receive alms.</p>
 <p>2. He who has committed a crime rendering unworthy to receive alms, is purified by the penance Taptak<i>rikkh</i>ra (in case he committed it knowingly), or by the penance Sîtak<i>rikkh</i>ra (in case he did it unawares), or by the penance Mahâsântapana (in case it was committed) repeatedly.</p>
