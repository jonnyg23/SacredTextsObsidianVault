 <p>1. Om! O Bhagavad-Gitâ, with which Pârtha was enlightened by the Lord Nârâyana Himself and which was incorporated in the Mahâbhârata by the ancient sage Vyâsa,—the Blessed Mother, the Destroyer of rebirth, showering down the nectar of Advaita, and consisting of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_vi"><font size="1" color="green">p. vi</font></a></p>  
 <p>eighteen chapters,—upon Thee, O Bhagavad-Gitâ! O Loving Mother! I meditate.</p>  
 <p>2. Salutation to thee, O Vyâsa, of mighty intellect and with eyes large like the petals of full-blown lotuses, by whom was lighted the lamp of wisdom, full of the Mahâbhârata-oil.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_vii"><font size="1" color="green">p. vii</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. Salutation to Krishna, the holder of the Jnânamudrâ, granter of desires of those who take refuge in Him, the milker of the Gitâ-nectar, in whose hand is the cane for driving cows.</p>  
 <p>4. All the Upanishads are the cows, the Son of the cowherd is the milker, Pârtha is the calf, men of purified intellect are the drinkers and the supreme nectar Gitâ is the milk.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_viii"><font size="1" color="green">p. viii</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. I salute Krishna, the Guru of the Universe, God, the son of Vasudeva, the Destroyer of Karma and Chânura, the supreme bliss of Devaki.</p>  
 <p>6. The battle-river, with Bhishma and Drona as its banks, and Jayadratha as the water, with the king of Gândhâra as the blue water-lily, and Shalya as the shark, with Kripa as the current and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_ix"><font size="1" color="green">p. ix</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Karna as the breakers, with Ashvatthâmâ and Vikarna as terrible Makaras and Duryodhana as the whirlpool in it,—was indeed crossed over by the Pândavas, with Keshava as the ferry-man.</p>  
 <p>7. May the taintless lotus of the Mahâbhârata, growing on the waters of the words of Parâshara's son, having the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_x"><font size="1" color="green">p. x</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Gitâ as its strong sweet fragrance, with many a narrative as its stamens, fully opened by the discourses on Hari and drunk joyously day after day by the Bhramara of the good and the pure in the world,—be productive of the supreme good to him who is eager to destroy the taint of Kali!</p>  
 <p>8. I salute that All-bliss Mâdhava whose compassion makes the mute eloquent and the cripple cross mountains.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_xi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xi</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. Salutation to that God Whom the creator Brahmâ, Varuna, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts praise with divine hymns; Whom the singers of Sâma sing, by the Vedas, with their full complement of parts, consecutive sections and Upanishads; Whom the Yogis see with their minds absorbed in Him through perfection in meditation, and Whose limit the hosts of Devas and Asuras know not.</p>
