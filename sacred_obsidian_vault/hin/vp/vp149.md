 <p>PARÁŚARA.--I have enumerated to you Pradyumna and the other sons of Rukminí. Satyabhámá bore Bhánu and Bhairika. The sons of Rohińí were Díptimat, Támrapakshi, and others. The powerful Śámba and other sons were born of Jámbavatí. Bhadravinda and other valiant youths were the sons of Nágnajití. Śaivyá (or Mitravindá) had several sons, of whom Sangrámajit was the chief. Vrika and others were begotten by Hari on Mádrí. Lakshmaná had Gátravat and others: and Śruta and others were the sons of Kálindí <a name="fr_1551"></a><a href="#fn_1551"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Krishńa had sons also by his other wives, in all one hundred and eighty thousand. The eldest of the whole was Pradyumna, the son of Rukminí: his son was Aniruddha, from whom Vraja was born: his mother was Ushá, the daughter of Báńa, and grand-daughter of Bali, whom Aniruddha won in war. On that occasion a fierce battle took place between Hari and Śankara, in which the thousand arms of Báńa were lopped away by the discus of the former.</p>  
 <p>MAITREYA.--HOW happened it, venerable Brahman, that a contest on account of Ushá arose between Śiva and Krishńa? and in what manner did Hari cut off the thousand arms of Báńa? This, illustrious sir, thou art able to narrate.</p>  
 <p>PARÁŚARA.--Ushá, the daughter of Báńa, having seen Párvatí sporting with her lord, Śambhu, was inspired with a wish for similar dalliance. The beautiful Gaurí, who knows the hearts of all, said to Ushá, "Do not grieve; you shall have a husband." "But when will this be?" thought Ushá to herself, "or who will be my lord?" On which Párvatí continued; "He who shall appear to you, princess, in a dream on the twelfth lunation of the light half of Vaiśákha, he will be your husband."</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Accordingly, as the goddess had foretold, on that lunar day a youth appeared to Ushá in a dream, of whose person she became enamoured. When she woke, and no longer perceived him, she was overcome with sorrow, and, unrestrained by modesty, demanded of her companion whither he had gone. The companion and friend of the princess was Chitralekhá, the daughter of Kubháńd́a, the minister of Báńa. "Of whom do you speak?" inquired she of Ushá. But the princess, recollecting herself, was ashamed, and remained silent. At length, however, Chitralekhá conciliated her confidence, and she related to her what had passed, and what the goddess had foretold; and she requested her friend to devise some means of uniting her with the person whom she had beheld in her dream.</p>  
 <p>Chitralekhá then delineated the most eminent gods, demons, spirits, and mortals, and shewed them to Ushá. Putting aside the portraits of gods, spirits, snake-gods, and demons, the princess selected those of mortals, and amongst them the heroes of the races of Andhaka and Vrishńi. When she came to the likenesses of Krishńa and Ráma, she was confused with shame; from the portrait of Pradyumna she modestly averted her eyes; but the moment she beheld the picture of his son, the object of her passion, her eyes wide expanded, and all her bashfulness was discarded. "This is he! this is he!" said she to Chitralekhá; and her friend, who was endowed with magic power, bade her be of good cheer, and set off through the air to Dwáraká.</p>
