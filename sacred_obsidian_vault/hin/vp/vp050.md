 <p><font size="-1">The world overrun with trees: they are destroyed by the Prachetasas. Soma pacifies them, and gives them Márishá to wife: her story: the daughter of the nymph Pramlochá. Legend of Kańd́u. Márishá's former history. Daksha the son of the Prachetasas: his different characters: his sons: his daughters: their marriages and progeny: allusion to Prahláda, his descendant.</font></p>  
 <p>WHILST the Prachetasas were thus absorbed in their devotions, the trees spread and overshadowed the unprotected earth, and the people perished: the winds could not blow; the sky was shut out by the forests; and mankind was unable to labour for ten thousand years. When the sages, coming forth from the deep, beheld this, they were angry, and, being incensed, wind and flame issued from their mouths. The strong wind tore up the trees by their roots, and left them sear and dry, and the fierce fire consumed them, and the forests were cleared away. When Soma (the moon), the sovereign of the vegetable world, beheld all except a few of the trees destroyed, he went to the patriarchs, the Prachetasas, and said, "Restrain your indignation, princes, and listen to me. I will form an alliance between you and the trees. Prescient of futurity, I have nourished with my rays this precious maiden, the daughter of the woods. She is called Márishá, and is assuredly the offspring of the trees. She shall be your bride, and the multiplier of the race of Dhruva. From a portion of your lustre and a portion of mine, oh mighty sages, the patriarch Daksha shall be born of her, who, endowed with a part of me, and composed of your vigour, shall be as resplendent as fire, and shall multiply the human race.</p>  
 <p>"There was formerly (said Soma) a sage named Kańd́u, eminent in holy wisdom, who practised pious austerities on the lovely borders of the Gomati river. The king of the gods sent the nymph Pramlochá to disturb his penance, and the sweet-smiling damsel diverted the sage from his devotions. They lived together, in the valley of Mandara, for a hundred and fifty years; during which, the mind of the Muni was wholly given up to enjoyment. At the expiration of this period the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p>nymph requested his permission to return to heaven; but the Muni, still fondly attached to her, prevailed upon her to remain for some time longer; and the graceful damsel continued to reside for another hundred years, and delight the great sage by her fascinations. Then again she preferred her suit to be allowed to return to the abodes of the gods; and again the Muni desired her to remain. At the expiration of more than a century the nymph once more said to him, with a smiling countenance, 'Brahman, I depart;' but the Muni, detaining the fine-eyed damsel, replied, 'Nay, stay yet a little; you will go hence for a long period.' Afraid of incurring an imprecation, the graceful nymph continued with the sage for nearly two hundred years more, repeatedly asking his permission to go to the region of the king of the gods, but as often desired by him to remain. Dreading to be cursed by him, and excelling in amiable manners, well knowing also the pain that is inflicted by separation from an object of affection, she did not quit the Muni, whose mind, wholly subdued by love, became every day more strongly attached to her.</p>  
 <p>"On one occasion the sage was going forth from their cottage in a great hurry. The nymph asked him where he was going. 'The day,' he replied, 'is drawing fast to a close: I must perform the Sandhya worship, or a duty will be neglected.' The nymph smiled mirthfully as she rejoined, 'Why do you talk, grave sir, of this day drawing to a close: your day is a day of many years, a day that must be a marvel to all: explain what this means.' The Muni said, 'Fair damsel, you came to the river-side at dawn; I beheld you then, and you then entered my hermitage. It is now the revolution of evening, and the day is gone. What is the meaning of this laughter? Tell me the truth.' Pramlochá. answered, 'You say rightly,' venerable Brahman, 'that I came hither at morning dawn, but several hundred years have passed since the time of my arrival. This is the truth.' The Muni, on hearing this, was seized with astonishment, and asked her how long he had enjoyed her society: to which the nymph replied, that they had lived together nine hundred and seven years, six months, and three days. The Muni asked her if she spoke the truth, or if she was in jest; for it appeared to him that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>they had spent but one day together: to which Pramlochá replied, that she should not dare at any time to tell him who lived in the path of piety an untruth, but particularly when she had been enjoined by him to inform him what had passed.</p>  
 <p>"When the Muni, princes, had heard these words, and knew that it was the truth, he began to reproach himself bitterly, exclaiming, 'Fie, fie upon me; my penance has been interrupted; the treasure of the learned and the pious has been stolen from me; my judgment has been blinded: this woman has been created by some one to beguile me: Brahma is beyond the reach of those agitated by the waves of infirmity <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a>. I had subdued my passions, and was about to attain divine knowledge. This was foreseen by him by whom this girl has been sent hither. Fie on the passion that has obstructed my devotions. All the austerities that would have led to acquisition of the wisdom of the Vedas have been rendered of no avail by passion that is the road to hell.' The pious sage, having thus reviled himself, turned to the nymph, who was sitting nigh, and said to her, 'Go, deceitful girl, whither thou wilt: thou hast performed the office assigned thee by the monarch of the gods, of disturbing my penance by thy fascinations. I will not reduce thee to ashes by the fire of my wrath. Seven paces together is sufficient for the friendship of the virtuous, but thou and I have dwelt together. And in truth what fault hast thou committed? why should I be wroth with thee? The sin is wholly mine, in that I could not subdue my passions: yet fie upon thee, who, to gain favour with Indra, hast disturbed my devotions; vile bundle of delusion.'</p>  
 <p>"Thus spoken to by the Muni, Pramlochá stood trembling, whilst big drops of perspiration started from every pore; till he angrily cried to her, 'Depart, begone.' She then, reproached by him, went forth from his dwelling, and, passing through the air, wiped the perspiration from her person with the leaves of the trees. The nymph went from tree to tree, and as with the dusky shoots that crowned their summits she dried her limbs, which were covered with moisture, the child she had conceived by</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Rishi came forth from the pores of her skin in drops of perspiration. The trees received the living dews, and the winds collected them into one mass. <font size="-1" color="green">"</font>This," said Soma, "I matured by my rays, and gradually it increased in size, till the exhalation that had rested on the tree tops became the lovely girl named Márishá. The trees will give her to you, Prachetasas: let your indignation be appeased. She is the progeny of Kańd́u, the child of Pramlochá, the nursling of the trees, the daughter of the wind and of the moon. The holy Kańd́u, after the interruption of his pious exercises, went, excellent princes, to the region of Vishńu, termed Purushottama, where, Maitreya <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with his whole mind he devoted himself to the adoration of Hari; standing fixed, with uplifted arms, and repeating the prayers that comprehend the essence of divine truth <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">3</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>The Prachetasas said, "We are desirous to hear the transcendental</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>prayers, by inaudibly reciting which the pious Kańd́u propitiated Keśava." On which Soma repeated as follows: "'Vishńu is beyond the boundary of all things: he is the infinite: he is beyond that which is boundless: he is above all that is above: he exists as finite truth: he is the object of the Veda; the limit of elemental being; unappreciable by the senses; possessed of illimitable might: he is the cause of cause; the cause of the cause of cause; the cause of finite cause; and in effects, he, both as every object and agent, preserves the universe: he is Brahma the lord; Brahma all beings; Brahma the progenitor of all beings; the imperishable: he is the eternal, undecaying, unborn Brahma, incapable of increase or diminution: Purushottama is the everlasting, untreated, immutable Brahma. May the imperfections of my nature be annihilated through his favour.' Reciting this eulogium, the essence of divine truth, and propitiating Keśava, Kańd́u obtained final emancipation.</p>  
 <p>"Who Márishá was of old I will also relate to you, as the recital of her meritorious acts will be beneficial to you. She was the widow of a prince, and left childless at her husband's death: she therefore zealously worshipped Vishńu, who, being gratified by her adoration, appeared to her, and desired her to demand a boon; on which she revealed to him the wishes of her heart. 'I have been a widow, lord,' she exclaimed, 'even from my infancy, and my birth has been in vain: unfortunate have I been, and of little use, oh sovereign of the world. Now therefore I pray thee that in succeeding births I may have honourable husbands, and a son equal to a patriarch amongst men: may I be possessed of affluence and beauty: may I he pleasing in the sight of all: and may I be born out of the ordinary course. Grant these prayers, oh thou who art propitious to the devout.' Hrishikeśa, the god of gods, the supreme giver of all blessings, thus prayed to, raised her from her prostrate attitude, and said, 'In another life you shall have ten husbands of mighty prowess, and renowned for glorious acts; and you shall have a son magnanimous and valiant, distinguished by the rank of a patriarch, from whom the various races of men shall multiply, and by whose posterity the universe shall be filled. You, virtuous lady, shall be of marvellous birth, and you shall be endowed with grace and loveliness, delighting the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>hearts of men.' Thus having spoken, the deity disappeared, and the princess was accordingly afterwards born as Márishá, who is given to you for a wife <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">4</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>Soma having concluded, the Prachetasas took Márishá, as he had enjoined them, righteously to wife, relinquishing their indignation against the trees: and upon her they begot the eminent patriarch Daksha, who had (in a former life) been born as the son of Brahmá <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">5</font></a>. This great sage, for the furtherance of creation, and the increase of mankind, created progeny. Obeying the command of Brahmá, he made movable and immovable things, bipeds and quadrupeds; and subsequently, by his will, gave birth to females, ten of whom he bestowed on Dharma, thirteen on Kaśyapa, and twenty-seven, who regulate the course of time, on the moon <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">6</font></a>. Of these, the gods, the Titans, the snake-gods, cattle, and birds, the singers and dancers of the courts of heaven, the spirits of evil, and other beings, were born. From that period forwards living creatures</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p>were engendered by sexual intercourse: before the time of Daksha they were variously propagated, by the will, by sight, by touch, and by the influence of religious austerities practised by devout sages and holy saints.</p>  
 <p>MAITREYA.--Daksha, as I have formerly heard, was born from the right thumb of Brahmá: tell me, great Muni, how he was regenerate as the son of the Prachetasas. Considerable perplexity also arises in my mind, how he, who, as the son of Márishá, was the grandson of Soma, could be also his father-in-law.</p>  
 <p>PARÁŚARA.--Birth and death are constant in all creatures: Rishis and sages, possessing divine vision, are not perplexed by this. Daksha and the other eminent Munis are present in every age, and in the interval of destruction cease to be <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">7</font></a>: of this the wise man entertains no doubt. Amongst them of old there was neither senior nor junior; rigorous penance and acquired power were the sole causes of any difference of degree amongst these more than human beings.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></a></p>  
 <p>MAITREYA.--Narrate to me, venerable Brahman, at length, the birth of the gods, Titans, Gandharbas, serpents, and goblins.</p>  
 <p>PARÁŚARA.--In what manner Daksha created living creatures, as commanded by Brahmá, you shall hear. In the first place he willed into existence the deities, the Rishis, the quiristers of heaven, the Titans, and the snake-gods. Finding that his will-born progeny did not multiply themselves, he determined, in order to secure their increase, to establish sexual intercourse as the means of multiplication. For this purpose he espoused Asikní, the daughter of the patriarch Vírańa <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">8</font></a>, a damsel addicted to devout practices, the eminent supportress of the world. By her the great father of mankind begot five thousand mighty sons, through whom he expected the world should be peopled. Nárada, the divine Rishi, observing them desirous to multiply posterity, approached them, and addressed them in a friendly tone: "Illustrious Haryaswas, it is evident that your intention is to beget posterity; but first consider this: why should you, who, like fools, know not the middle, the height, and depth of the world <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">9</font></a>, propagate offspring? When your intellect is no more obstructed by interval, height, or depth, then how, fools, shall ye not all behold the term of the universe?" Having heard the words of Nárada, the sons of Daksha dispersed themselves through the regions, and to the present day have not returned; as rivers that lose themselves in the ocean come back no more.</p>  
 <p>The Haryaswas having disappeared, the patriarch Daksha begot by the daughter of Vírańa a thousand other sons. They, who were named Savaláswas, were desirous of engendering posterity, but were dissuaded by Nárada in a similar manner. They said to one another, "What the Muni has observed is perfectly just. We must follow the path that our</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></a></p>  
 <p>brothers have travelled, and when we have ascertained the extent of the universe, we will multiply our race." Accordingly they scattered themselves through the regions, and, like rivers flowing into the sea, they returned not again. Henceforth brother seeking for brother disappears, through ignorance of the products of the first principle of things. Daksha the patriarch, on finding that all these his sons had vanished, was incensed, and denounced an imprecation upon Nárada <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">10</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then, Maitreya, the wise patriarch, it is handed down to us, being anxious to people the world, created sixty daughters of the daughter of Vírańá <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">11</font></a>; ten of whom he gave to Dharma, thirteen to Kaśyapa, and twenty-seven to Soma, four to Arisht́anemi, two to Bahuputra, two to Angiras, and two to Kriśáśwa. I will tell you their names. Arundhat́í, Vasu, Yámí, Lambá, Bhánú, Marutwatí, Sankalpa, Muhúrttá, Sádhyá, and Viśwá were the ten wives of Dharma <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">12</font></a>, and bore him the following</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a></p>  
 <p>progeny. The sons of Viśwá were the Viśwádevas <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">13</font></a>; and the Sádhyas <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">14</font></a>, those of Sádhyá. The Máruts, or winds, were the children of Marutwatí; the Vasus, of Vasu. The Bhánus (or suns) of Bhánu; and the deities presiding over moments, of Muhúrttá. Ghosha was the son of Lambá (an arc of the heavens); Nágavíthí (the milky way), the daughter of Yámí (night). The divisions of the earth were born of Arundhat́i; and Sankalpa (pious purpose), the soul of all, was the son of Sankalpá. The deities called Vasus, because, preceded by fire, they abound in splendour and might <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">15</font></a>, are severally named Ápa, Dhruva, Soma, Dhava (fire), Anila (wind), Anala (fire), Pratyúsha (day-break), and Prabhása (light). The four sons of Ápa were Vaitańd́ya, Śrama (weariness), Sránta (fatigue), and Dhur (burthen). Kála (time), the cherisher of the world, was the son of Dhruva. The son of Soma was Varchas (light), who was the father of Varchaswí (radiance). Dhava had, by his wife Manohará (loveliness), Dravińa, Hutahavyaváha, Śiśira, Práńa, and Ramańa. The two sons of Anila (wind), by his wife Śivá, were Manojava (swift as thought) and Avijnátagati (untraceable motion). The son of Agni (fire), Kumára, was born in a clump of Śara reeds: his sons were Sákha, Visákha, Naigameya, and Prisht́haja. The offspring of the Krittikás was named Kártikeya. The son of Pratyúsha was the Rishi named Devala, who had two philosophic and intelligent sons <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">16</font></a>. The sister of Váchaspati, lovely and virtuous, Yogasiddhá, who pervades the wholes world without</p>

 <p>being devoted to it, was the wife of Prabhása, the eighth of the Vasus, and bore to him the patriarch Viswakarmá, the author of a thousand arts, the mechanist of the gods, the fabricator of all ornaments, the chief of artists, the constructor of the self-moving chariots of the deities, and by whose skill men obtain subsistence. Ajaikapád, Ahirvradhna, and the wise Rudra Twasht́ri, were born; and the self-born son of Twashtri was also the celebrated Viśwarúpa. There are eleven well-known Rudras, lords of the three worlds, or Hara, Bahurúpa, Tryambaka, Aparájita, Vrishakapi, Sambhu, Kaparddí, Raivata, Mrigavyádha, Sarva, and Kapáli <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">17</font></a>; but there are a hundred appellations of the immeasurably mighty Rudras <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">18</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></a></p>  
 <p>The daughters of Daksha who were married to Kaśyapa were Aditi, Diti, Danu, Arisht́á, Surasá, Surabhi, Vinatá, Támrá, Krodhavaśá, Id́á, Khasá, Kadru, and Muni <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">19</font></a>; whose progeny I will describe to you. There were twelve celebrated deities in a former Manwantara, called Tushitas <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">20</font></a>, who, upon the approach of the present period, or in the reign of the last Manu, Chákshusha, assembled, and said to one another, "Come, let us quickly enter into the womb of Adití, that we may be born in the next Manwantara, for thereby we shall again enjoy the rank of gods:" and accordingly they were born the sons of Kaśyapa, the son of Maríchi, by Adití, the daughter of Daksha; thence named the twelve Ádityas; whose appellations were respectively, Vishńu, Śakra, Áryaman, Dhútí, Twásht́ri, Púshan, Vivaswat, Savitri, Mitra, Varuńa, Anśa, and Bhaga <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">21</font></a>. These, who in the Chákshusha Manwantara were the gods called Tushitas, were called the twelve Ádityas in the Manwantara of Vaivaśwata.</p>  
 <p>The twenty-seven daughters of the patriarch who became the virtuous wives of the moon were all known as the nymphs of the lunar constellations,</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></a></p>  
 <p>which were called by their names, and had children who were brilliant through their great splendour <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">22</font></a>. The wives of Arisht́anemi bore him sixteen children <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">23</font></a>. The daughters of Bahuputra were the four lightnings <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">24</font></a>. The excellent Pratyangirasa Richas were the children of Angiras <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">25</font></a>, descended from the holy sage: and the deified weapons of the gods <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">26</font></a> were the progeny of Kriśáśwa.</p>  
 <p>These classes of thirty-three divinities <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">27</font></a> are born again at the end of a thousand ages, according to their own pleasure; and their appearance and disappearance is here spoken of as birth and death: but, Maitreya, these divine personages exist age after age in the same manner as the sun sets and rises again.</p>  
 <p>It has been related to us, that Diti had two sons by Kaśyapa, named Hirańyakaśipu and the invincible Hirańyáksha: she had also a daughter,</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Sinká, the wife of Viprachitti. Hirańyakaśipu was the father of four mighty sons, Anuhláda, Hláda, the wise Prahláda, and the heroic Sanhláda, the augmentor of the Daitya race <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">28</font></a>. Amongst these, the illustrious Prahláda, looking on all things with indifference, devoted his whole faith to Janárddana. The flames that were lighted by the king of the Daityas consumed not him, in whose heart Vásudeva was cherished; and all the earth trembled when, bound with bonds, he moved amidst the waters of the ocean. His firm body, fortified by a mind engrossed by Achyuta, was unwounded by the weapons hurled on him by order of the Daitya monarch; and the serpents sent to destroy him breathed their venomous flames upon him in vain. Overwhelmed with rocks, he yet remained unhurt; for he never forgot Vishńu, and the recollection of the deity was his armour of proof. Hurled from on high by the king of the Daityas, residing in Swerga, earth received him unharmed. The wind sent into his body to wither him up was itself annihilated by him, in whom Madhusúdana was present. The fierce elephants of the spheres broke their tusks, and vailed their pride, against the firm breast which the lord of the Daityas had ordered them to assault. The ministrant priests of the monarch were baffled in all their rites for the destruction of one so steadily attached to Govinda: and the thousand delusions of the fraudulent Samvara, counteracted by the discus of Krishńa, were practised without success. The deadly poison administered by his father's officers he partook of unhesitatingly, and without its working any visible change; for he looked upon the world with mind undisturbed, and, full of benignity, regarded all things with equal affection, and as identical with himself. He was righteous; an inexhaustible mine of purity and truth; and an unfailing model for all pious men.</p>

The hymn that follows is in fact a mantra or mystical prayer, commencing with the reiteration of the word Para and Pára; as, ###. Para means 'supreme, infinite; and Pára, 'the farther bank or limit,' the point that is to be attained by crossing a river or sea, or figuratively the world or existence. Vishńu, then, is Para, that which nothing surpasses; and Pára, the end or object of existence: he is Apára pára, the farthest bound of that which is illimitable, or space and time: he is Param parebhyah, above or beyond the highest, being beyond or superior to all the elements: he is Paramártha rúpí, or identical with final truth, or knowledge of soul: he is Brahma pára, the object or essence of spiritual wisdom. Parapárabhúta is said to imply the farther limit (Pára) of rudimental matter (Para). He is Para, or chief Paránam, of those objects which are beyond the senses: and he is Párapára, or the boundary of boundaries; that is, he is the comprehensive in-vesture of, and exterior to, those limits by which soul is confined; he is free from all incumbrance or impediment.

The penance of the Prachetasas, and its consequences, are related in the Agni, Bhágavata, Matsya, Padma, Váyu, and Bráhma Puráńas, and allusion is briefly made to Márishá's birth. Her origin from Kańd́u and Pramlochá is narrated in a different place in the Bráhma Puráńa, where the austerities of Kańd́u, and the necessity for their interruption, are described. The story, from that authority, was translated by the late Professor Chezy, and is published in the first number of the Journal Asiatique.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_282"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_282">115:5</a> The second birth of Daksha, and his share in the peopling of the earth, is narrated in most of the Puráńas in a similar manner. It is perhaps the original legend, for Daksha seems to be an irregular adjunct to the Prajápatis, or mind-born sons of Brahmá (see <a href="vp041.htm#page_49">p. 49</a>. n. <a href="vp041.htm#fn_200">2</a>); and the allegorical nature of his posterity in that character (<a href="vp041.htm#page_54">p. 54</a>) intimates a more recent origin. Nor does that series of descendants apparently occur in the Mahábhárata, although the existence of two Dakshas is especially remarked there (Moksha Dh.). In the Ádi Parva, which seems to be the freest from subsequent improvements, the Daksha noticed is the son of the Prachetasas. The incompatibility of the two accounts is reconciled by referring the two Dakshas to different Manwantaras. The Daksha who proceeded from Brahmá as a Prajápati being born in the first, or Swáyambhuva, and the son of the Prachetasas in the Chákshusha Manwantara. The latter however, as descended from Uttánapáda, should belong to the first period also. It is evident that great confusion has been made by the Puráńas in Daksha's history.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_283">115:6</a> That is, they are the Nakshatras, or lunar asterisms.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_284"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_284">116:7</a> 'They are removed', which the commentator explains by 'are absorbed, as if they were fast asleep;' but in every age or Yuga, according to the text--in every Manwantara, according to the comment--the Rishis reappear, the circumstances of their origin only being varied. Daksha therefore, as remarked in the preceding note, is the son of Brahmá in one period, the son of the Prachetasas in another. So Soma, in the Swáyambhuva Manwantara, was born as the son of Atri; in the Chákshusha, he was produced by churning the ocean. The words of our text occur in the Hari Vanśa, with an unimportant variation: 'Birth and obstruction are constant in all beings, but Rishis and those men who are wise are not perplexed by this;' that is, not, as rendered above, by the alternation of life and death; but, according to the commentator on the Hari Vanśa, by a very different matter, the prohibition of unlawful marriages. Utpatti, 'birth of progeny,' is the result of their will; Nirodha, 'obstruction,' is the law prohibiting the intermarriage of persons connected by the offering of the funeral cake; to which Rishis and sages are not subject, either from their matrimonial unions being merely platonic, or from the bad example set by Brahmá, who, according to the Vedas, approached his own daughter; we have already had occasion to advert to (<a href="vp041.htm#page_51">p. 51</a>. n. <a href="vp041.htm#fn_203">5</a>). The explanation of the text, however, given by the commentator appears forced, and less natural than the interpretation preferred above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_285"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_285">117:8</a> This is the usual account of Daksha's marriage, and is that of the Mahábhárata, Adi P. (p. 113), and of the Bráhma Puráńa, which the Hari Vanśa, in the first part, repeats. In another portion, the Pushkara Máhátmya, however, Daksha, it is said, converts half himself into a female, by whom he begets the daughters presently to be noticed: ###. This seems to be merely a new edition of an old story.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_286"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_286">117:9</a> The commentator explains it to mean the origin, duration, and termination of subtile rudimental body; but the Padma and Linga P. distinctly express it, 'the extent of the earth.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_287">118:10</a> Nárada's interference, and the fruitless generation of the first progeny of Daksha, is an old legend. The Mahábhárata (Ádi P. p. 113) notices only one set of sons, who, it is said, obtained Moksha, or liberation, through Náreda's teaching them the Sánkhya philosophy. The Bráhma, Matsya, Váyu, Linga, Padma, Agni, and Bhágavata Puráńas tell the story much as in the text, and not unfrequently in the same words. In general they merely refer to the imprecation denounced upon Nárada, as above. The Bhágavata specifies the imprecation to be perpetual peripateticism. Daksha says to him, 'There shall not be a resting-place for thee in all these regions.' The Kúrma repeats the imprecation merely to the effect that Nárada shall perish, and gives no legend. In the Brahma Vaivartta, Nárada is cursed by Brahmá, on a similar occasion, to become the chief of the Gandharbas, whence his musical propensities: but the Bhágavata, VI. 7, has the reverse of this legend, and makes him first a Gandharba, then a Śúdra, then the son of Brahmá. The Bráhma P., and after it the Hari Vanśa and the Váyu P., have a different and not very intelligible story. Daksha, being about to pronounce an imprecation upon Nárada, was appeased by Brahmá and the Rishis, and it was agreed between them that Nárada should be again born, as the son of Kaśyapa, by one of Daksha's daughters. This seems to be the gist of the legend, but it is very confusedly told. The version of the Bráhma P., which is the same as that of Hari Vanśa, may be thus rendered: "The smooth-speaking Nárada addressed the sons of Daksha for their destruction and his own; for the Muni Kaśyapa begot him as a son, who was the son of Brahmá, on the daughter of Daksha, through fear of the latter's imprecation. He was formerly the son of Paramesht́hí (Brahmá), and the excellent sage Kaśyapa next begot him, as if he were his father, on Asikní, the daughter of Vírańa. Whilst he was engaged in beguiling the sons of the patriarch, Daksha, of resistless power, determined on his destruction; but he was solicited by Brahmá, in the presence of the great sages, and it was agreed between them that Nárada, the son of Brahmá, should be born of a daughter of Daksha. Consequently Daksha gave his daughter to Paramesht́hí, and by her was Nárada born." Now several difficulties occur here. Asikní is the wife, not the daughter, of Daksha; but this may be a blunder of the compiler, for in the parallel passage of the Váyu no name occurs. In the next place, who is this daughter? for, as we shall see, the progeny of all Daksha's daughters are fully detailed, and in no <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a> authority consulted is Nárada mentioned as the son of either of them, or as the son of Kaśyapa. Daksha, too, gives his daughter, not to Kaśyapa, but to Paramesht́hí, or Brahmá. The commentator on the Hari Vanśa solves this by saying he gives her to Brahmá for Kaśyapa. The same bargain is noticed in the Váyu, but Nárada is also said there to be adopted by Kaśyapa. Again, however, it gives Daksha's imprecation in the same words as the Hari Vanśa; a passage, by the way, omitted in the Bráhma: 'Nárada, perish (in your present form), and take up your abode in the womb.' Whatever may be the original of this legend, it is evidently imperfectly given by the authorities here cited. The French translation of the passage in the Hari Vanśa can scarcely be admitted as correct: assuredly is not 'le Devarchi Dakcha, epoux d'’Asikní, fille de Virána, fut l’aïeul de cet illustri mouni ainsi régénéré.' ### is more consistently said by the commentator to mean Kaśyapa. The Váyu P. in another part, a description of the different orders of Rishis, states that the Devarshis Parvata and Náreda were sons of Kaśyapa: In the account of Kárttavírya, in the Bráhma P. and Hari Vanśa, Nárada is introduced as a Gandharba, the son of Varidása; being the same, according to the commentator on the latter, as the Gandharba elsewhere called Upavarhana.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_288">119:11</a> The prior specification (p. 115) was fifty. The Mahábhárata, Adi P. 113, and, again, Moksha Dharma, has the same number. The Bhágavata, Kúrma, Padma, Linga, and Váyu P. state sixty. The former is perhaps the original, as the fullest and most consistent details relate to them and their posterity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_289">119:12</a> This is the usual list of Dharma's wives. The Bhágavata substitutes Kakud for Arundhat́í. The Padma P., Matsya P., and Hari Vanśa contain two different account of Daksha's descendants: the first agrees with our text; the second, which is supposed to occur in the Padma Kalpa, is somewhat varied, particularly as to the wives of Dharma, who are said to be five.

According to the Váyu and Bráhma P. the Rudras are the children of Kaśyapa by Surabhi: the Bhágavata makes them the progeny of Bhúta and Sarúpá: the Matsya, Padma, and Hari V., in the second series, the offspring of Surabhi by Brahmá.

The variety seems to proceed from the writers applying to the Rudras, as they may legitimately do, different appellations of the common prototype, or synonymes of Rudra or Śiva, selected at will from his thousand and eight names, according to the Linga P.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_296"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_296">122:19</a> There is some, though not much, variation in these names in different Puráńas. The Bhágavata has Saramá, Kasht́ha, and Timi, the parents severally of canine animals, beasts with uncloven hoofs, and fishes, in place of Vinatá, Khasá, and Kadru; disposing of the first and last differently. The Váyu has Pravá in place of Arisht́á, and Anáyush or Danáyush for Surasá. The Padma P., second series, substitutes Kálá, Anáyush, Sinhiká, Piśáchá, Vách for Arisht́a, Surasá, Surabhi, Támrá, and Muni; and omits Id́á and Khasá. In the Uttara Khańd́a of the same, Kaśyapa's wives are said to be but four, Aditi, Diti, Kadru, and Vinatá.</p>

The Váyu has a much more complete legend than any other Pura on this subject. In the beginning of the Kalpa twelve gods, named Jayas, were created by Brahmá, as his deputies and assistants in the creation. They, lost in meditation, neglected his commands; on which he cursed them to be repeatedly born in each Manwantara till the seventh. They were accordingly, in the several successive Manwantaras, Ajitas, Tushitas, Satyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sádhyas, and Ádityas. Our authority and some others, as the Bráhma, have apparently intended to refer to this account, but have confused the order of the series.</p>

In the Mahábhárata this is said to be another name of Kaśyapa. The Bhágavata substitutes Tárksha for this personage, said by the commentator to be likewise another name of Kaśyapa. His wives are, Kadru, Vinatá, Patangi, and Yáminí, mothers of snakes, birds, grasshoppers, and locusts.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_301"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_301">123:24</a> Enumerated in astrological works as brown, red, yellow, and white; portending severally wind, heat, rain, famine.</p>

The Bhágavata calls the wives of Anginas, Swadhá and Satí, and makes them the mothers of the Pitris and the Atharvan Veda severally.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_303"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_303">123:26</a> The Śastra devatas, 'gods of the divine weapons;' a hundred are enumerated in the Rámáyańa, and they are there termed the sons of Kriśáśwa by Jayá and Vijayá, daughters of the Prajápati; that is, of Daksha. The Bhágavata terms the two wives of Kriśáśwa, Archish (flame) and Dhishańá; the former is the mother of Dhúmaketu (comet); the latter, of four sages, Devala, Vedaśiras, Vayuńa, and Manu. The allegorical origin of the weapons is undoubtedly the more ancient.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_304"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_304">123:27</a> This number is founded upon a text of the Vedas, which to the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and twelve Ádityas, adds Prajápati, either Brahmá or Daksha, and Vashatkára, 'deified oblation.' They have the epithet Chhandajá, as born in different Manwantaras, of their own will.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_305"></a><a href="vp050.htm#fr_305">124:28</a> The Puráńas generally concur in this genealogy, reading sometimes Anuhráda, Hráda, &amp;c. for Anuhláda and the rest. Although placed second in the order of Kaśyapa's descendants, the Daityas are in fact the elder branch. Thus the Mahábhárata, Moksha Dherma, calls Diti the senior wife of Kaśyapa: and the Váyu terms Hirańyakaśipu and Hirańyáksha the eldest of all the sons of that patriarch. "Titan and his enormous brood" were "heaven's first born."</p>
