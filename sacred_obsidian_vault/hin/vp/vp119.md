 <p align="center"><font size="-1">The conception of Devakí: her appearance: she is praised by the gods.</font></p>  
 <p>THE nurse of the universe, Jagaddhátrí, thus enjoined by the god of gods, conveyed the six several embryos into the womb of Devakí <a name="fr_1464"></a><a href="#fn_1464"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and transferred the seventh after a season to that of Rohińí; after which, Hari, for the benefit of the three regions, became incarnate as the conception of the former princess, and Yoganidrá as that of Yaśodá, exactly as the supreme Vishńu had commanded. When the portion of Vishńu had become incorporate upon earth, the planetary bodies moved in brilliant order in the heavens, and the seasons were regular and genial. No person could bear to gaze upon Devakí, from the light that invested her; and those who contemplated her radiance felt their minds disturbed. The gods, invisible to mortals, celebrated her praises continually from the time that Vishńu was contained in her person. "Thou," said the divinities, "art that Prakriti, infinite and subtile, which formerly bore Brahmá in its womb: then wast thou the goddess of speech, the energy of the creator of the universe, and the parent of the Vedas. Thou, eternal being, comprising in thy substance the essence of all created things, wast identical with creation: thou wast the parent of the triform sacrifice, becoming the germ of all things: thou art sacrifice, whence all fruit proceeds: thou art the wood, whose attrition engenders fire. As Adití, thou art the parent of the gods; as Diti, thou art the mother of the Daityas, their foes. Thou art light, whence day is begotten: thou art humility, the mother of true wisdom: thou art kingly policy, the parent of order: thou art modesty, the progenitrix of affection: thou art desire, of whom love is born: thou art contentment, whence resignation is derived: thou art intelligence, the mother of knowledge: thou art patience, the parent of fortitude: thou art the heavens, and thy children are the stars: and from thee does all that exists proceed. Such, goddess,</p>

 <p>and thousands more, are thy mighty faculties; and now innumerable are the contents of thy womb, O mother of the universe. The whole earth, decorated with oceans, rivers, continents, cities, villages, hamlets, and towns; all the fires, waters, and winds; the stars, asterisms, and planets; the sky, crowded with the variegated chariots of the gods, and ether, that provides space for all substance; the several spheres of earth, sky, and heaven; of saints, sages, ascetics, and of Brahmá; the whole egg of Brahmá, with all its population of gods, demons, spirits, snake-gods, fiends, demons, ghosts, and imps, men and animals, and whatever creatures have life, comprised in him who is their eternal lord, and the object of all apprehension; whose real form, nature, name, and dimensions are not within human apprehension--are now with that Vishńu in thee. Thou art Swáhá; thou art Swadhá; thou art wisdom, ambrosia, light, and heaven. Thou hast descended upon earth for the preservation of the world. Have compassion upon us, O goddess, and do good unto the world. Be proud to bear that deity by whom the universe is upheld."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1464"></a><a href="vp119.htm#fr_1464">500:1</a> It is mentioned in the preceding chapter that they were all put to death, in which the Hari Vanśa concurs. The Bhágavata makes Kansa spare them, and restore them to their parents, as he had nothing to apprehend from their existence.</p>
