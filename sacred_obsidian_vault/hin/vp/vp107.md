These princes were termed Śaineyas.</p>  
 <p>In the family of Anamitra, Priśni was born; his son was Śwaphalka <a name="fr_1163"></a><a href="#fn_1163"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the sanctity of whose character has been described: the younger brother of Śwaphalka was named Chitraka.

 <p><a name="page_436"><font size="1" color="green">p. 436</font></a></p>  
 <p>his son was Bhava <a name="fr_1169"></a><a href="#fn_1169"><font size="1">9</font></a>, who was also called Chandanodakadundubhi <a name="fr_1170"></a><a href="#fn_1170"><font size="1">10</font></a>; he was a friend of the Gandharba Tumburu; his son was Abhijit; his son was Punarvasu; his son was Áhuka, and he had also a daughter named Áhukí. The sons of Áhuka were Devaka and Ugrasena. The former had four sons, Devavat, Upadevá, Sudeva, and Devarakshita, and seven daughters, Vrikadevá, Upadevá, Devarakshitá, Śrídevá, Śántidevá, Sahadevá, and Devakí: all the daughters were married to Vasudeva. The sons of Ugrasena were Kansa, Nyagrodha, Sunáman, Kanka, Śanku, Subhúmi, Rásht́rapála, Yuddhamusht́hi, and Tusht́imat; and his daughters were Kansá, Kansavatí, Sutanu, Rásht́rapálí, and Kankí.</p>  
 <p>The son of Bhajamána <a name="fr_1171"></a><a href="#fn_1171"><font size="1">11</font></a> was Vidúratha; his son was Śúra; his son was Śamin <a name="fr_1172"></a><a href="#fn_1172"><font size="1">12</font></a>; his son was Pratíkshatra <a name="fr_1173"></a><a href="#fn_1173"><font size="1">13</font></a>; his son was Swayambhoja <a name="fr_1174"></a><a href="#fn_1174"><font size="1">14</font></a>; his son was Hridika, who had Kritavarman, Śatadhanu, Devamíd́husha, and others <a name="fr_1175"></a><a href="#fn_1175"><font size="1">15</font></a>. Śúra, the son of Devamíd́husha  <a name="fr_1176"></a><a href="#fn_1176"><font size="1">16</font></a>, was married to Márishá, and had by her ten sons. On the birth of Vasudeva, who was one of these sons, the gods, to whom the future is manifest, foresaw that the divine being would take a human form in his family, and thereupon they sounded with joy the drums of heaven: from this circumstance Vasudeva was also called Ánakadunbubhi <a name="fr_1177"></a><a href="#fn_1177"><font size="1">17</font></a>. His brothers were Devabhága, Devaśravas, Anádhrisht́i, Karundhaka, Vatsabálaka, Śrinjaya,</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Śyáma, Śamíka, and Gańd́úsha; and his sisters were Prithá, Śrutadevá, Śrutakírttí, Śrutaśravas, and Rájádhideví.</p>  
 <p>Śúra had a friend named Kuntibhoja, to whom, as he had no children, the presented in due form his daughter Pritha. She was married to Pańd́u, and bore him Yudhisht́hira, Bhíma, and Arjuna, who were in fact the sons of the deities Dharma, Váyu (air), and Indra. Whilst she was yet unmarried, also, she had a son named Karńa, begotten by the divine Áditya (the sun). Pańd́u had another wife, named Mádrí, who had by the twin sons of Áditya, Násatya and Dasra, two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva <a name="fr_1178"></a><a href="#fn_1178"><font size="1">18</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Śrutadevá was married to the Kárusha prince Vriddhaśarman, and bore him the fierce Asura Dantavaktra. Dhrisht́aketu, raja of Kaikeya <a name="fr_1179"></a><a href="#fn_1179"><font size="1">19</font></a>, married Śrutakírtti, and had by her Santarddana and four other sons, known as the five Kaikeyas. Jayasena, king of Avanti, married Rájádhideví, and had Vinda and Anavinda. Śrutaśravas was wedded to Damaghosha, raja of Chedi, and bore him Śiśupála <a name="fr_1180"></a><a href="#fn_1180"><font size="1">20</font></a>. This prince was in a former existence the unrighteous but valiant monarch of the Daityas, Hirańyakaśipu, who was killed by the divine guardian of creation (in the man-lion Avatára). He was next the ten-headed sovereign Rávańa, whose unequalled prowess, strength, and power were overcome by the lord of the three worlds, Ráma. Having been killed by the deity in the form of Rághava, he had long enjoyed the reward of his virtues in exemption from an embodied state, but had now received birth once more as Śiśupála, the son of Damaghosha, king of Chedi. In this character he renewed, with greater inveteracy than ever, his hostile hatred towards the god surnamed Puńd́arikáksha, a portion of the supreme being, who had descended to lighten the burdens of the earth; and was in consequence slain by him: but from the circumstance of his thoughts being constantly engrossed by the supreme being, Śiśupála was united with him after death; for the lord giveth to those to whom he is favourable whatever they desire, and he bestows a heavenly and exalted station even upon those whom he slays in his displeasure.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1161"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1161">435:1</a> Bhúti: Váyu. Kuni: Bhágavata. Dyumni: Matsya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1162"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1162">435:2</a> The Agni makes these all brother's sons of Satyaka, and adds another, Rishabha, the father of Śwaphalka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1163"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1163">435:3</a> The authorities are not agreed here. Śwaphalka, according to the Agni, as just remarked, comes from Śini, the son of Anamitra. The Bhágavata, instead of Priśni, has Vrishńi, son of Anamitra; the Bráhma and Hari V. have Vrishńi; and the Agni, Prishńi, son of Yudhájit. The Matsya also makes Yudhájit the ancestor of Akrúra, through Rishabha and Jayanta. Yudhájit in the Bráhma, &amp;c. is the son of Krosht́ri.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1164"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1164">435:4</a> The different authorities vary in the reading of these names, though they generally concur in the number.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1165"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1165">435:5</a> The Matsya and Padma call them sons of Akrúra, but no doubt incorrectly.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1166"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1166">435:6</a> Śami: Váyu. Śaśi: Matsya. Śini Agni. This last makes them the sons of Babhru, and calls the first Sundara.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1167"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1167">435:7</a> Vrishńi: Bhágavata, Váyu, Matsya, &amp;c. Dhrisht́a: Agni. Dhrishńu: Bráhma, Hari V.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1168"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1168">435:8</a> The Bhágavata puts Viloman first. The Linga makes it an epithet of Kapotaroman, saying he was Vilomaja, 'irregularly begotten.' In place of Viloman we have Raivata, Váyu; Taittiri, Matsya; Tittiri, Agni.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1169"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1169">436:9</a> Nava: Agni. Bala: Linga. Nala: Matsya. Tomas: Kúrma. Anu: Bhágavata.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1170"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1170">436:10</a> The Matsya, Váyu, and Agni agree with our text. The Linga, Padma, and Kúrma read Ánakadundubhi as a synonyme of Bala. The Bráhma and Hari V. have no such name, but here insert Punarvasu, son of Taittiri. The Bhágavata has a different series, or Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Arijit, Punarvasu, Áhuka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1171"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1171">436:11</a> This Bhajamána is the son of Andhaka, according to all the best authorities; so the Padma calls this branch the Ándhakas. The Agni makes him the son of Babhru.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1172"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1172">436:12</a> Váta, Niváta, Śamin: Váyu.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1173"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1173">436:13</a> Sonáśwa: Matsya. Sonáksha: Padma. Śini: Bhájavata.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1174"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1174">436:14</a> Bhojaka: Agni. Bhoja: Padma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1175"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1175">436:15</a> Ten sons: Matsya, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1176"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1176">436:16</a> Devárha: Váyu, Padma, Agni, and Matsya; and a different series follows, or Kambalavarhish, Asamaujas, Samaujas, Sudanstra, Suvaśa, Dhrisht́a, Anamitra, Nighna, Satrájit. They all make Vasudeva the son of Śúra, however; but the three first leave it doubtful whether that Śúra was the son of Bhajamána or not. The Bhágavata and Bráhma agree with the text, which is probably correct. The Bráhma has Śúra son of Devamíd́hush, although it does not specify the latter amongst the sons of Hridika.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1177"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1177">436:17</a> Ánaka a larger, and Dundubhi a smaller drum.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1178"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1178">437:18</a> The Mahábhárata is the best authority for these circumstances.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1179"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1179">437:19</a> The Padma calls him king of Kashmir.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1180"></a><a href="vp107.htm#fr_1180">437:20</a> The Bráhma P. and Hari V. make Śrutadevá mother of Śiśupála, and Prithukírtti of Dantavaktra.</p>
