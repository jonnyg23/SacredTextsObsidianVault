 <h2 align="CENTER">CHAPTER I.</h2>
 <p align="CENTER">Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra said</p>
 <p>What did my (people) and the Pâ<i>nd</i>avas do, O Sañ<i>g</i>aya! when they assembled together on the holy field of Kurukshetra, desirous to do battle?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Sañ<i>g</i>aya said:</p>
 <p>Seeing the army of the Pâ<i>nd</i>avas drawn up in battle-array <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the prince Duryodhana approached the preceptor, and spoke (these) words: 'O preceptor! observe this grand army of the sons of Pâ<i>nd</i>u, drawn up in battle-array by your talented pupil, the son of Drupada. In it are heroes (bearing) large bows, the equals of Bhîma and Ar<i>g</i>una in battle--(namely), Yuyudhâna, Virâ<i>t</i>a, and Drupada, the master of a great car <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and Dh<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>aketu, <i>K</i>ekitâna, and the valiant king of Kâsî, Puru<i>g</i>it and Kuntibho<i>g</i>a, and that eminent man <i>S</i>aibya; the heroic Yudhâmanyu, the valiant Uttamau<i>g</i>as, the son of Subhadrâ, and the sons of Draupadî--all masters of great cars. And now, O best of Brâhma<i>n</i>as!</p>

 <p>learn who are most distinguished among us, and are leaders of my army. I will name them to you, in order that you may know them well. Yourself, and Bhîshma, and Kar<i>n</i>a, and K<i>ri</i>pa the victor of (many) battles; A<i>s</i>vatthâman, and Vikar<i>n</i>a, and also the son of Somadatta, and many other brave men, who have given up their lives for me, who fight with various weapons, (and are) all dexterous in battle. Thus our army which is protected by Bhîshma is unlimited; while this army of theirs which is protected by Bhîma is very limited. And therefore do ye all, occupying respectively the positions <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">1</font></a> assigned to you, protect Bhîshma <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">2</font></a> only.'</p>
 <p>Then his powerful grandsire, Bhîshma, the oldest of the Kauravas, roaring aloud like a lion, blew his conch, (thereby) affording delight to Duryodhana. And then all at once, conchs, and kettledrums, and tabors, and trumpets were played upon; and there was a tumultuous din. Then, too, Mâdhava and the son of Pâ<i>nd</i>u (Ar<i>g</i>una), seated in a grand chariot to which white steeds were yoked, blew their heavenly conchs. H<i>ri</i>shîke<i>s</i>a <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">3</font></a> blew the Pâñ<i>k</i>a<i>g</i>anya <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and Dhanañ<i>g</i>aya the Devadatta, and Bhîma, (the doer) of fearful deeds, blew the great conch Pau<i>nd</i>ra. King Yudhish<i>th</i>ira, the son of Kuntî <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">5</font></a>, blew the Anantavi<i>g</i>aya, and Nakula and Sahadeva (respectively)</p>

 <p>the Sughosha and Ma<i>n</i>ipushpaka. And the king of Kâ<i>s</i>î, too, who has an excellent bow, and Sikha<i>nd</i>in, the master of a great car, and Dh<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>adyumna, Virâ<i>t</i>a, and the unconquered Sâtyaki, and Drupada, and the sons of Draupadî, and the son of Subhadrâ, of mighty arms, blew conchs severally from all sides, O king of the earth! That tumultuous din rent the hearts of all (the people) of Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra's (party), causing reverberations throughout heaven and earth. Then seeing (the people of ) Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra's party regularly marshalled, the son of Pâ<i>nd</i>u, whose standard is the ape, raised his bow <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a>, after the discharge of missiles had commenced, and O king of the earth! spake these words to H<i>ri</i>shîke<i>s</i>a: 'O undegraded one! station my chariot between the two armies, while I observe those, who stand here desirous to engage in battle, and with whom, in the labours of this struggle, I must do battle. I will observe those who are assembled here and who are about to engage in battle, wishing to do service in battle <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">2</font></a> to the evil-minded son of Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Sañ<i>g</i>aya said:</p>
 <p>Thus addressed by Gu<i>d</i>âke<i>s</i>a <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">3</font></a>, O descendant of Bharata <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">4</font></a>! H<i>ri</i>shîke<i>s</i>a stationed that excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhîshma and Dro<i>n</i>a and of all the kings of the earth, and</p>

 <p>said O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! look at these assembled Kauravas.' There the son of P<i>ri</i>thâ saw in both armies, fathers and grandfathers, preceptors, maternal uncles, brothers, sons <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">1</font></a>, grandsons, companions, fathers-in-law, as well as friends. And seeing all those kinsmen standing (there), the son of Kuntî was overcome by excessive pity, and spake thus despondingly.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Ar<i>g</i>una said:</p>
 <p>Seeing these kinsmen, O K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a! standing (here) desirous to engage in battle, my limbs droop down; my mouth is quite dried up; a tremor comes on my body; and my hairs stand on end; the Gâ<i>nd</i>îva (bow) slips from my hand; my skin burns intensely. I am unable, too, to stand up; my mind whirls round, as it were; O Ke<i>s</i>ava! I see adverse omens <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and I do not perceive any good (to accrue) after killing (my) kinsmen in the battle. I do not wish for victory, O K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a! nor sovereignty, nor pleasures: what is sovereignty to us, O Govinda! what enjoyments, and even life? Even those, for whose sake we desire sovereignty, enjoyments, and pleasures, are standing here for battle, abandoning life and wealth-preceptors, fathers, sons as well as grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, as also (other) relatives. These I do not wish to kill, though they kill (me), O destroyer of Madhu <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">3</font></a>! even for the sake of sovereignty over the three worlds, how much less then for this earth</p>

 <p>(alone)? What joy shall be ours, O <i>G</i>anârdana! after killing Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra's sons? Killing these felons <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">1</font></a> we shall only incur sin. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill our own kinsmen, the sons of Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra. For how, O Mâdhava! shall we be happy after killing our own relatives? Although having their consciences corrupted by avarice, they do not see the evils flowing from the extinction of a family, and the sin in treachery to friends, still, O Ganârdana! should not we, who do see the evils flowing from the extinction of a family, learn to refrain from that sin? On the extinction of a family, the eternal rites of families are destroyed <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Those rites being destroyed, impiety predominates over the whole family <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">3</font></a>. In consequence of the predominance of impiety, O K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a! the women of the family become corrupt <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and the women becoming corrupt, O descendant of V<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>i! intermingling of castes results; that intermingling necessarily leads the family and the destroyers of the family to hell; for when the ceremonies of (offering) the balls of food and water (to them) fail <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">5</font></a>, their ancestors fall down (to hell). By these transgressions of the destroyers of families, which occasion interminglings of castes, the eternal rites of castes and rites, of families are</p>

 <p>subverted. And O <i>G</i>anârdana! we have heard that men whose family-rites are subverted, must necessarily live in hell. Alas! we are engaged in committing a heinous sin, seeing that we are making efforts for killing our own kinsmen out of greed of the pleasures of sovereignty. If the sons of Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra, weapon in hand, should kill me in battle, me weaponless and not defending (myself), that would be better for me.</p>

 <p>Having spoken thus, Ar<i>g</i>una cast aside his bow together with the arrows, on the battle-field, and sat down in (his) chariot, with a mind agitated by grief.</p>
