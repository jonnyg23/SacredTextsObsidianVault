 <p align="CENTER">Ar<i>g</i>una said:</p>
 <p>O you of mighty arms! O H<i>ri</i>shîke<i>s</i>a! O destroyer of Ke<i>s</i>in! I wish to know the truth about renunciation and abandonment distinctly.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Deity said:</p>
 <p>By renunciation the sages understand the rejection of actions done with desires. The wise call the abandonment of the fruit of all actions (by the name) abandonment. Some wise men say, that action should be abandoned as being full of evil; and others, that the actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance</p>

 <p>should not be abandoned. As to that abandonment, O best of the descendants of Bharata! listen to my decision; for abandonment, O bravest of men! is described (to be) threefold. The actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance should not be abandoned; they must needs be performed; for sacrifices, gifts, and penances are means of sanctification to the wise. But even these actions, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! should be performed, abandoning attachment and fruit; such is my excellent and decided opinion. The renunciation of prescribed action is not proper. Its abandonment through delusion <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">1</font></a> is described as of the quality of darkness. When a man abandons action, merely as being troublesome, through fear of bodily affliction, he does not obtain the fruit <a name="fr_527"></a><a href="#fn_524"><font size="1">2</font></a> of abandonment by making (such) passionate abandonment. When prescribed action is performed, O Ar<i>g</i>una! abandoning attachment and fruit also, merely because it ought to be performed, that is deemed (to be) a good abandonment. He who is possessed of abandonment <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_525"><font size="1">3</font></a>, being full of goodness, and talented, and having, his doubts destroyed, is not averse from unpleasant actions, is not attached to pleasant <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">4</font></a> (ones). Since no embodied (being) can abandon actions without exception <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_527"><font size="1">5</font></a>, he is said to be possessed of abandonment, who abandons the fruit of action. The threefold fruit of action, agreeable, disagreeable, and mixed, accrues after death to those who are not possessed of abandonment, but never to</p>

 <p>renouncers <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Learn from me, O you of mighty arms! these five causes of the completion of all actions, declared in the Sâ<u>n</u>khya system <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_529"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The substratum, the agent likewise, the various sorts of organs, and the various and distinct movements, and with these the deities, too, as the fifth. Whatever action, just or otherwise, a man performs with his body, speech, and mind, these five are its causes. That being so, the undiscerning man, who being of an unrefined understanding, sees the agent in the immaculate self, sees not (rightly) <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He who has no feeling of egoism <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and whose mind is not tainted, even though he kills (all) these people, kills not, is not fettered, <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">5</font></a> (by the action). Knowledge <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the object of knowledge, the knower--threefold is the prompting to action. The instrument, the action, the agent, thus in brief is action threefold. Knowledge and action and agent</p>

 <p>are declared in the enumeration of qualities <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">1</font></a> (to be) of three classes only, according to the difference of qualities. Hear about these also as they really are. Know that knowledge to be good, by which (a man) sees one entity, inexhaustible, and not different in all things (apparently) different <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">2</font></a> (from one another). Know that knowledge to be passionate, which is (based) on distinctions <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">3</font></a> (between different entities), which sees in all things various entities of different kinds. And that is described as dark, which clings to one created (thing) only as everything, which is devoid of reason, devoid of real principle, and insignificant <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">4</font></a>. That action is called good, which is prescribed, which is devoid of attachment, which is not done from (motives of) affection or aversion, (and which is done) by one not wishing for the fruit. That is described as passionate, which (occasions) much trouble, is performed by one who wishes for objects of desire, or one who is full of egotism <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">5</font></a>. The action is called dark, which is commenced through delusion, without regard to consequences, loss, injury, or strength <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">6</font></a>. That agent is called good, who has cast off attachment, who is free from egotistic talk, who is possessed of courage and energy, and unaffected by success or ill-success. That agent is called passionate, who is full of affections <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_540"><font size="1">7</font></a>,</p>

 <p>who wishes for the fruit of actions, who is covetous, cruel, and impure, and feels joy and sorrow. That agent is called dark, who is without application <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_541"><font size="1">1</font></a>, void of discernment, headstrong, crafty, malicious, lazy, melancholy, and slow. Now hear, O Dhanañ<i>g</i>aya! the threefold division of intelligence <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">2</font></a> and courage, according to qualities, which I am about to declare exhaustively and distinctly. That intelligence, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! is good which understands action and inaction <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">3</font></a>, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, danger and the absence of danger, emancipation and bondage. That intelligence, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! is passionate, by which one imperfectly understands piety and impiety, what ought to be done and also what ought not to be done. That intelligence, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! is dark, which shrouded by darkness, understands impiety (to be) piety, and all things incorrectly. That courage, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! is good courage, which is unswerving <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and by which one controls the operations of the mind, breath, and senses, through abstraction. But, O Ar<i>g</i>una! that courage is passionate, by which one adheres to piety, lust, and wealth <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and through attachment <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">6</font></a> wishes,</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! for the fruit, That courage is dark, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! by which an undiscerning man does not give up sleep, fear, sorrow, despondency, and folly. Now, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! bear from me about the three sorts of happiness. That happiness is called good, in which one is pleased after repetition <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">1</font></a> (of enjoyment), and reaches the close of all misery, which is like poison first and comparable to nectar in the long run, and which is produced from a clear knowledge of the self <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">2</font></a>. That happiness is called passionate, which (flows) from contact between the senses and their objects, and which is at first comparable to nectar and in the long run like poison. That happiness is described as dark, which arises from sleep, laziness, heedlessness, which deludes the self, both at first and in its consequences. There is no entity either on earth or in heaven among the gods, which is free from these three qualities born of nature. The duties of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<i>s</i>yas, and of <i>S</i>ûdras, too, O terror of your foes! are distinguished according to the qualities born of nature <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Tranquillity <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">4</font></a>, restraint of the senses, penance, purity, forgiveness, straightforwardness, also knowledge, experience, and belief (in a future world), this is the natural duty of Brâhma<i>n</i>as. Valour, glory, Courage,</p>

 <p>dexterity <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">1</font></a>, not slinking away from battle, gifts, exercise of lordly power <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">2</font></a>, this is the natural duty of Kshatriyas. Agriculture, tending cattle, trade, (this) is the natural duty of Vai<i>s</i>yas, And the natural duty of <i>S</i>ûdras, too, consists in service. (Every) man intent on his own respective duties obtains perfection <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Listen, now, how one intent on one's own duty obtains perfection. Worshipping, by (the performance of) his own duty, him from whom all things proceed, and by whom all this is permeated, a man obtains perfection. One's duty, though defective, is better than another's duty well performed <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Performing the duty prescribed by nature, one does not incur sin. O son of Kuntî! one should not abandon a natural duty though tainted with evil; for all actions are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">5</font></a>. One who is self-restrained, whose understanding is unattached everywhere, from whom affections have departed, obtains the supreme perfection of freedom from action <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">6</font></a> by renunciation. Learn from me, only in brief, O son of Kuntî! how one who has obtained perfection attains the Brahman, which is the highest culmination of knowledge. A man possessed of a pure understanding, controlling his self by courage, discarding sound and other objects of sense, casting off affection</p>

 <p>and aversion; who frequents clean places, who eats little, whose speech, body, and mind are restrained, who is always intent on meditation and mental abstraction <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and has recourse to unconcern, who abandoning egoism <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">2</font></a>, stubbornness, arrogance, desire, anger, and (all) belongings, has no (thought that this or that is) mine, and who is tranquil, becomes fit for assimilation with the Brahman. Thus reaching the Brahman <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and with a tranquil self, he grieves not, wishes not; but being alike to all beings, obtains the highest devotion to me. By (that) devotion he truly understands who I am and how great. And then understanding me truly, he forthwith enters into my (essence). Even performing all actions, always depending on me, he, through my favour, obtains the imperishable and eternal seat. Dedicating in thought <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">4</font></a> all actions to me, be constantly given up to me, (placing) your thoughts on me, through recourse to mental abstraction. (Placing) your thoughts on me, you will cross over all difficulties by my favour. But if you will not listen through egotism <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">5</font></a>, you will be ruined. If entertaining egotism, you think that you may not fight, vain, indeed, is that resolution of yours. Nature <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">6</font></a> will constrain you. That, O son of Kuntî! which through delusion you do not wish to do, you will do involuntarily,</p>

 <p>tied down by your own duty, flowing from your nature. The lord, O Ar<i>g</i>una! is seated in the region of the heart <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">1</font></a> of all beings, turning round all beings (as though) mounted on a machine, by his delusion. With him, O descendant of Bharata! seek shelter in every way <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">2</font></a>; by his favour you will obtain the highest tranquillity, the eternal seat. Thus have I declared to you the knowledge more mysterious than any mystery. Ponder over it thoroughly, and then act as you like. Once more, listen to my excellent words-most mysterious of all. Strongly I like you, therefore I will declare what is for your welfare. On me (place) your mind, become my devotee, sacrifice to me, reverence me, you will certainly come to me. I declare to you truly, you are dear to me. Forsaking all duties <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">3</font></a>, come to me as (your) sole refuge. I will release you from all sins. Be not grieved. This <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">4</font></a> you should never declare to one who performs no penance <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">5</font></a>, who is not a devotee <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">6</font></a>, nor to one who does not wait on (some preceptor) <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">7</font></a>, nor yet to one who calumniates me. He who, with the highest devotion <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">8</font></a> to me, will proclaim this supreme mystery among my devotees, will come to me, freed from (all) doubt.

 <p>amongst men is superior to him in doing what is dear to me. And there will never be another on earth dearer to me than he. And he who will study this holy dialogue of ours, will, such is my opinion, have offered to me the sacrifice of knowledge <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And the man, also, who with faith and without carping will listen (to this), will be freed (from sin), and attain to the holy regions of those who perform pious acts <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Have you listened to this, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! with a mind (fixed) on (this) one point only? Has your delusion (caused) by ignorance been destroyed, O Dhanañ<i>g</i>aya?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Ar<i>g</i>una said:</p>
 <p>Destroyed is my delusion; by your favour, O undegraded one! I (now) recollect <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">3</font></a> myself. I stand freed from doubts <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">4</font></a>. I will do your bidding.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Sañ<i>g</i>aya said:</p>
 <p>Thus did I hear this dialogue between Vâsudeva and the high-minded son of P<i>ri</i>thâ, (a dialogue) wonderful and causing the hair to stand on end. By the favour of Vyâsa, I heard this highest mystery, (this) devotion <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">5</font></a>, from K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a himself, the lord of the possessors of mystic power, who proclaimed it in person. O king! remembering and (again) remembering this wonderful and holy dialogue of Ke<i>s</i>ava and Ar<i>g</i>una, I rejoice over and over again. And remembering and (again) remembering that</p>

Wherever (is) K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, the lord of the possessors of mystic power, wherever (is the (great) archer, the son of Prithâ, there in my opinion (are) fortune, victory, prosperity <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and eternal justice.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_522"></a><a href="sbe0819.htm#fr_525">121:3</a> The meaning of this whole passage seems to be that these three words, which designate the Brahman, have distinct uses, as specified. 'Om,' says Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, is employed whether the action is done with any special desire or not. Those who study the Brahman there means 'study the Vedas.' 'Tad' is employed in case of actions without desires only. 'Sat' is employed, according to <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara, in case of existence, such as the birth of a first son; I goodness,' the reclamation of a bad man; 'auspicious acts,' marriage, &amp;c.
