 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Ganame<i>g</i>aya <a name="fr_1032"></a><a href="#fn_1027"><font size="1">1</font></a> said:</p>
 <p>What conversation, O twice-born one <a name="fr_1033"></a><a href="#fn_1028"><font size="1">2</font></a> I took place between the high-souled Kesava and Ar<i>g</i>una, while they dwelt in that palace  <a name="fr_1034"></a><a href="#fn_1029"><font size="1">3</font></a> after slaying their enemies?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Vai<i>s</i>ampâyana said:</p>
 <p>The son of P<i>ri</i>thâ, after becoming possessed of his kingdom (in an) undisturbed (state), enjoyed himself in the company of K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, full of delight in that heavenly palace. And once, O king! they happened to go, surrounded by their people, and rejoicing, to a certain portion of the palace which resembled heaven. Then Ar<i>g</i>una, the son of Pâ<i>nd</i>u, having surveyed with delight that lovely palace, in the company of K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, spoke these words: 'O you of mighty arms! O you whose mother is Devakî <a name="fr_1035"></a><a href="#fn_1030"><font size="1">4</font></a>! when the battle was about to commence, I became aware of your greatness, and that divine</p>

 <p>form of yours <a name="fr_1036"></a><a href="#fn_1031"><font size="1">1</font></a>. But that, O Kesava! which through affection (for me) you explained before <a name="fr_1037"></a><a href="#fn_1032"><font size="1">2</font></a>, has all disappeared, O tiger-like man! from my degenerate mind. Again and again, however, I feel a curiosity about those topics. But (now), O Mâdhava! you will be going at no distant date to Dvârakâ.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Vai<i>s</i>ampâyana said</p>
 <p>Thus addressed, that best of speakers, K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, possessed of great glory, replied in these words after embracing Ar<i>g</i>una.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Vâsudeva said:</p>
 <p>From me, O son of Prithâ! you heard a mystery, and learnt about the eternal <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1033"><font size="1">3</font></a> (principle), about piety in (its true) form, and about all the everlasting worlds <a name="fr_1039"></a><a href="#fn_1034"><font size="1">4</font></a>. It is excessively disagreeable to me, that you should not have grasped it through want of intelligence. And the recollection (of it) now again is not possible (to me). Really, O son of Pându! you are devoid of faith and of a bad intellect. And, O Dhanañ<i>g</i>aya! it is not possible for me to repeat in full (what I said before). For that doctrine was perfectly adequate for understanding the seat, <a name="fr_1040"></a><a href="#fn_1035"><font size="1">5</font></a> of the Brahman. It is not possible for me to state it again in full in that way. For then accompanied by my mystic power <a name="fr_1041"></a><a href="#fn_1036"><font size="1">6</font></a>, I declared to you the Supreme Brahman. But I shall relate an ancient story upon</p>

 <p>that subject, so that adhering to this knowledge, you may attain the highest goal. O best of the supporters of piety! listen to all that I say. (Once), O restrainer of foes! there came from the heavenly world and the world of Brahman <a name="fr_1042"></a><a href="#fn_1037"><font size="1">1</font></a>, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a difficult to withstand <a name="fr_1043"></a><a href="#fn_1038"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and he was (duly) honoured by us. (Now) listen, without entertaining any misgivings, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! to what he said on being interrogated by us according to heavenly rules <a name="fr_1044"></a><a href="#fn_1039"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
 <p>The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>O K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a! O destroyer of Madhu! I will explain to you accurately what you, out of compassion for (all) beings <a name="fr_1045"></a><a href="#fn_1040"><font size="1">4</font></a>, have asked me touching the duties (to be Performed) for final emancipation. It is destructive of delusion, O Lord! Listen to me with attention <a name="fr_1046"></a><a href="#fn_1041"><font size="1">5</font></a>, as I relate it, O Mâdhava! A certain Brâhma<i>n</i>a named Kâ<i>s</i>yapa, who had performed (much) penance, and who best understood piety, approached a certain twice-born. (person) who had learnt the Scriptures relating to (all) duties <a name="fr_1047"></a><a href="#fn_1042"><font size="1">6</font></a>, having heard (of him, as one) who had over and over again gone through all knowledge and experience about coming and going <a name="fr_1048"></a><a href="#fn_1043"><font size="1">7</font></a>, who was well versed in the true nature of all worlds <a name="fr_1049"></a><a href="#fn_1044"><font size="1">8</font></a>,</p>

 <p>who knew about happiness and misery <a name="fr_1050"></a><a href="#fn_1045"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who knew the truth about birth and death <a name="fr_1051"></a><a href="#fn_1046"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who was conversant with merit and sin, who perceived the migrations of embodied (souls) of high and low (degrees) in consequence of (their) actions, who moved about like an emancipated being, who had reached perfection <a name="fr_1052"></a><a href="#fn_1047"><font size="1">3</font></a>, who was tranquil, whose senses were restrained, who was illumined with the Brahmic splendour <a name="fr_1053"></a><a href="#fn_1048"><font size="1">4</font></a>, who moved about in every direction, who understood concealed movements <a name="fr_1054"></a><a href="#fn_1049"><font size="1">5</font></a>, who was going in company of invisible Siddhas and celestial singers <a name="fr_1055"></a><a href="#fn_1050"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and conversing and sitting together (with them) in secluded (places), who went about as he pleased, and was unattached (anywhere) like the wind. Having approached him, that talented ascetic possessed of concentration (of mind), that best of the twice-born, wishing to acquire piety, fell at his feet, after seeing that great marvel. And amazed on seeing that marvellous man, the best of the twice-born, Kâ<i>s</i>yapa, pleased the preceptor by his great devotion. That was all appropriate <a name="fr_1056"></a><a href="#fn_1051"><font size="1">7</font></a>, (being) joined to sacred learning and correct conduct. And, O terror of your foes! he pleased that (being) by (his purity of) heart and behaviour (suitable) towards a preceptor <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1052"><font size="1">8</font></a>.

 <p align="CENTER">The Siddha said:</p>
 <p>Mortals, O dear friend <a name="fr_1058"></a><a href="#fn_1053"><font size="1">1</font></a>! by their actions which are (of) mixed (character), or which are meritorious and pure, attain to this world as the goal, or to residence in the world of the gods <a name="fr_1059"></a><a href="#fn_1054"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Nowhere is there everlasting happiness; nowhere eternal residence <a name="fr_1060"></a><a href="#fn_1055"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Over and over again is there a downfall from a high position attained with difficulty. Overcome by lust and anger, and deluded by desire, I fell into uncomfortable and harassing states (of life), in-consequence of (my) committing sin. Again and again death, and again and again birth <a name="fr_1061"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">4</font></a>. I ate numerous (kinds of) food, sucked at various breasts, saw various mothers, and fathers of different sorts; and, O sinless one! (I saw) strange pleasures and miseries. Frequently (I suffered) separation from those I loved, association with those I did not love. Loss of wealth also came on me, after I had acquired that wealth with difficulty; ignominies full of affliction from princes and likewise from kinsmen; excessively poignant pain, mental and bodily. I also underwent frightful indignities, and fierce deaths and captivities; (I had a) fall into hell, and torments in the house of Yama <a name="fr_1062"></a><a href="#fn_1057"><font size="1">5</font></a>. I also suffered much from old age, continual ailments, and numerous misfortunes flowing from the pairs of opposites <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1058"><font size="1">6</font></a>. Then on one occasion, being much afflicted with misery, I abandoned the whole</p>

 <p>course of worldly life, through indifference (to worldly objects), al, taking refuge with the formless (principle) <a name="fr_1064"></a><a href="#fn_1059"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Having learnt about this path in this world, I exercised myself (in it), and hence, through favour of the self <a name="fr_1065"></a><a href="#fn_1060"><font size="1">2</font></a>, have I acquired this perfection <a name="fr_1066"></a><a href="#fn_1061"><font size="1">3</font></a>. I shall not come here again <a name="fr_1067"></a><a href="#fn_1062"><font size="1">4</font></a>; I am surveying the worlds, and the happy migrations <a name="fr_1068"></a><a href="#fn_1063"><font size="1">5</font></a> of (my) self from the creation of beings to (my attaining) perfection. Thus, O best of the twice-born! have I obtained this highest perfection. From here I go to the next <a name="fr_1069"></a><a href="#fn_1064"><font size="1">6</font></a> (world), and from there again to the still higher (world)--the imperceptible seat of the Brahman. Have no doubt on that, O terror of your foes <a name="fr_1070"></a><a href="#fn_1065"><font size="1">7</font></a>! I shall not come back to this mortal world. I am pleased with you, O you of great intelligence! Say, what can I do for you? The time is now come for that which you desired in coming to me. I know for what you have come to me.
