 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER VIII.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>On this, too, they relate an ancient story, O beautiful one! (showing) of what description is the institution of the five sacrificial priests. The learned know this to be a great principle, that the Prâ<i>n</i>a and the Apâna, and the Udâna, and also the Samâna and the Vyâna, are the five sacrificial priests.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a's wife said:</p>
 <p>My former belief was that the sacrificial priests were seven. by (their) nature <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">4</font></a>. State how the great principle is that there are verily five sacrificial priests <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>The wind prepared by the Prâ<i>n</i>a afterwards becomes the Apâna. The wind prepared in the Apâna then works as the Vyâna. The wind prepared by the Vyâna works as the Udâna. And the wind prepared in the Udâna is produced as Samâna <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">1</font></a>. They formerly went to the grandsire, who was born first, and said to him, 'Tell us which is greatest among us. He shall be the greatest among us <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Brahman said:</p>
 <p>He, verily, is the greatest, who being extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures become extinct; and on whose moving about, they again move about. (Now) go where (you) like.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Prâ<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body</p>
 <p>

 <p>

 <p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a></p>
 <p>of living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they again move about. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>Then the Prâ<i>n</i>a became extinct, and again moved about. Then the Samâna and Udâna also <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">1</font></a>, O beautiful one! spoke these words, 'You do not pervade all this here as we do. You are not the greatest among us, O Prâ<i>n</i>a, because the Apâna is subject to you <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' The Prâ<i>n</i>a again moved about <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the Apâna <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">4</font></a> said to him.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Apâna said:</p>
 <p>When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they again move about. I am the. greatest. See I am extinct!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>Then the Vyâna and the Udâna addressed him who was speaking (thus): 'You are not the greatest, O Apâna! because the Prâ<i>n</i>a is subject to you.' Then the Apâna moved about, and the Vyâna spoke to him: 'I am the greatest among (you) all. Hear the reason why. When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures become extinct.</p>

 <p>And on my moving about, they again move about. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>Then the Vyâna became extinct, and again moved about. And the Prâna and Apâna, and the Udâna, and the Samâna, spoke to him, 'You are not the greatest among us, O Vyâna! because the Samâna <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">1</font></a> is subject to you.' The Vyâna moved about again, and the Samâna spoke again. 'I am the greatest among (you) all. Hear the reason why. When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they again move about. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!' Then the Samâna moved about, and the Udâna said to him: 'I am the greatest among (you) all. Hear the reason why. When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they again move about. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!' Then the Udâna became extinct, and again moved about. And the Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna, and the Samâna, and the Vyâna also, spoke to him: 'O Udâna! you are not the greatest. The Vyâna <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">2</font></a> only is subject to you.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>Then Brahman, the lord of (all) creatures, said. to them who were assembled together: You are all greatest, and not greatest <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">3</font></a>. You are all possessed</p>

 <p>of one another's qualities <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fn_1305"><font size="1">1</font></a>. All are greatest in their own spheres, and all support one another. There is one unmoving <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fn_1306"><font size="1">2</font></a> (life-wind). There are others moving about, (which are) five, owing to (their) specific qualities. My own self is one only <a name="fr_1312"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fn_1307"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (but) accumulated in numerous (forms). Being friendly with one another, and pleasing one another, go away happily. Welfare be to you! Support one another.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1293"></a><a href="sbe0834.htm#fr_1298">270:3</a> Perception of pleasure, says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra; but he takes the subsequent clause to mean this, 'and without you no pleasure accrues to us either.' The text is here in an unsatisfactory state.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1294"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1299">270:4</a> As stated in the last chapter; some MSS. read 'your' for 'my' at the beginning of the sentence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1295"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1300">270:5</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says that in this Pañ<i>k</i>ahot<i>ri</i>-vidhâna the five chief Hot<i>ri</i>s only are stated for briefly explaining the Prâ<i>n</i>âyâma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1296"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1301">271:1</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says, 'The wind going to the Prâ<i>n</i>a, and being obstructed in upward progress by the Prâ<i>n</i>a, goes to the Apâna, and then unable to go upwards or downwards, enters the passages or nâ<i>d</i>îs of the body and becomes Vyâna. In the same way Udâna, by the collision of the two, produces sound in the throat, and depends on Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna; so, too, the Samâna dwelling in the navel and kindling the gastric fire is also dependent on those two.' The meaning seems to be that one life-wind is distributed in the different places, and gets different names, as stated, in the order mentioned. See Maitrî, p. 28.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1297"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1302">271:2</a> A similar visit on the part of the Prâ<i>n</i>as (who, however, are not there the life-winds only, but the Prâ<i>n</i>a life-wind and the active organs) to Pra<i>g</i>âpati is mentioned at B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka-upanishad, p. 1016, and <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 297. Cf. also Pra<i>s</i>na, p. 178; B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, p. 317; and Kaushîtaki, p. 63. See also, generally, as to the life-winds and their functions, B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, p. 280, and <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara's comment there; Yoga-sûtras III, 38, and comment; Cowell's note at Maitrî, p. 247; <i>S</i>ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 184, st. 24-25; chap. 185, st. 1 seq.; and <a href="sbe0832.htm#page_258">p. 258</a> supra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1298"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1303">272:1</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says, Vyâna and Apâna also by force of the two 'ands' which occur in the original; and so in other places too.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1299"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1304">272:2</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says on this, 'The Prâ<i>n</i>a moves upwards through the help of the Apâna. If it moved downwards, it would be simply absorbed into the Apâna.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1300"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1305">272:3</a> I. e. recommenced its, proper operation in its proper place.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1301"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1306">272:4</a> And the other life-winds also, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says, the name Prâ<i>n</i>a being merely 'indicative,' as the phrase is, of the class to which it belongs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1302"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1307">273:1</a> Because the Samâna helps in the digestion of the food which afterwards goes to the Vyâna for distribution through the nâ<i>d</i>îs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1303"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1308">273:2</a> Because the Udâna is able to generate sound after the nâ<i>d</i>îs are filled up by the Vyâna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1304"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1309">273:3</a> 'Not greatest' because none of them is independent of the other. 'Greatest' Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra renders by 'superior to objects.'</p>
