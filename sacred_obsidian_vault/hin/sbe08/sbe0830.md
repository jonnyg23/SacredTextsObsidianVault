 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER III.</h1>
 <p>There is no destruction here of actions good or not good <a name="fr_1113"></a><a href="#fn_1108"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Coming to one body after another they become ripened in their respective ways <a name="fr_1114"></a><a href="#fn_1109"><font size="1">2</font></a>. As a fruitful (tree) producing fruit may yield much fruit, so does merit performed with a pure mind become expanded <a name="fr_1115"></a><a href="#fn_1110"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Sin, too, performed with a sinful mind, is similarly (expanded). For the self engages in action, putting forward this mind <a name="fr_1116"></a><a href="#fn_1111"><font size="1">4</font></a>. And now further, hear how <a name="fr_1117"></a><a href="#fn_1112"><font size="1">5</font></a> a man, overwhelmed with action, and enveloped in desire and anger <a name="fr_1118"></a><a href="#fn_1113"><font size="1">6</font></a>, enters a womb. Within the womb of a woman, (he) obtains-as the result of action a body good or else bad <a name="fr_1119"></a><a href="#fn_1114"><font size="1">7</font></a>, made up of virile semen and blood. Owing to (his) subtlety and imperceptibility, though he obtains a body appertaining to the Brahman, he is not attached anywhere; hence is he the eternal Brahman <a name="fr_1120"></a><a href="#fn_1115"><font size="1">8</font></a>. That is the seed of all beings; by that</p>

 <p>all creatures exist. That soul, entering all the limbs of the ftus, part by part, and dwelling in the seat of the life-wind <a name="fr_1121"></a><a href="#fn_1116"><font size="1">1</font></a>, supports (them) with the mind <a name="fr_1122"></a><a href="#fn_1117"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Then the ftus, becoming possessed of consciousness, moves about its limbs. As liquefied iron being poured out assumes the form of the image <a name="fr_1123"></a><a href="#fn_1118"><font size="1">3</font></a>, such you must know is the entrance of the soul into the ftus. As fire entering a ball of iron, heats it, such too, you must understand, is the manifestation of the soul in the ftus. And as a blazing lamp shines in a house, even so does consciousness light up bodies <a name="fr_1124"></a><a href="#fn_1119"><font size="1">4</font></a>. And whatever action he performs, whether good or bad, everything done in a former body must necessarily be enjoyed (or suffered). Then <a name="fr_1125"></a><a href="#fn_1120"><font size="1">5</font></a> that is exhausted, and again other (action) is accumulated, so long as the piety which dwells in the practice of concentration of mind for final emancipation <a name="fr_1126"></a><a href="#fn_1121"><font size="1">6</font></a> has not been learnt. As to that, O best (of men)! I will tell you about that action by which, verily, one going the round of various births, becomes happy. Gifts, penance, life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, adherence to prescribed regulations, restraint of the senses <a name="fr_1127"></a><a href="#fn_1122"><font size="1">7</font></a>, and also</p>

 <p>tranquillity, compassion to (all) beings, self-restraint, and absence of cruelty, refraining from the appropriation of the wealth of others, not acting dishonestly even in thought towards (any) being in this world, serving mother and father, honouring deities and guests, honouring preceptors, pity, purity, constant restraint of the organs <a name="fr_1128"></a><a href="#fn_1123"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and causing good to be done; this is said to be the conduct of the good <a name="fr_1129"></a><a href="#fn_1124"><font size="1">2</font></a>. From this is produced piety, which protects people to eternity. Thus one should look (for it) among the good, for among them it constantly abides. The practice to which the good adhere, points out (what) piety (is) <a name="fr_1130"></a><a href="#fn_1125"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And among them dwells that (course of) action which constitutes eternal piety. He who acquires that, never comes to an evil end <a name="fr_1131"></a><a href="#fn_1126"><font size="1">4</font></a>. By this are people held in check from making a slip in the paths of piety <a name="fr_1132"></a><a href="#fn_1127"><font size="1">5</font></a>. But the devotee who is released <a name="fr_1133"></a><a href="#fn_1128"><font size="1">6</font></a> is esteemed higher than these. For the deliverance from the course of worldly life of the man who acts piously and well, as he should act, takes place after a long time <a name="fr_1134"></a><a href="#fn_1129"><font size="1">7</font></a>. Thus a creature always meets with (the effects of) the action performed (in a) previous (life). And that <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1130"><font size="1">8</font></a> is the sole cause by which he comes here (in a) degraded (form). There is</p>

 <p>in the world a doubt as to what originally was the source from which he became invested with a body. And that I shall now proceed to state. Brahman, the grandfather of all people, having Made a body for himself, created the whole of the three worlds, moving and fixed <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1131"><font size="1">1</font></a>. From that he created the Pradhâna, the material cause of all embodied (selfs), by which all this is pervaded, and which is known in the world as the highest <a name="fr_1137"></a><a href="#fn_1132"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This is what is called the destructible <a name="fr_1138"></a><a href="#fn_1133"><font size="1">3</font></a>; but the other <a name="fr_1139"></a><a href="#fn_1134"><font size="1">4</font></a> is immortal and indestructible. And Pra<i>g</i>âpati, who had been first created, created all creatures and (all) the fixed entities, (having) as regards the moving (creation), a pair separately for each <a name="fr_1140"></a><a href="#fn_1135"><font size="1">5</font></a> (species). Such is the ancient (tradition) heard (by us). And as regards that, the grandsire fixed a limit of time, and (a rule) about migrations among (various) creatures, and about the return <a name="fr_1141"></a><a href="#fn_1136"><font size="1">6</font></a>. What I say is all correct and proper, like (what may be said by) any talented person who has in</p>

 <p>a former birth perceived the self <a name="fr_1142"></a><a href="sbe0831.htm#fn_1137"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He who properly perceives pleasure and pain to be inconstant, the body to be an unholy aggregate  <a name="fr_1143"></a><a href="sbe0831.htm#fn_1138"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and ruin to be connected with action <a name="fr_1144"></a><a href="sbe0831.htm#fn_1139"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and who remembers that whatever little there is of happiness is all misery <a name="fr_1145"></a><a href="sbe0831.htm#fn_1140"><font size="1">4</font></a>, he will cross beyond the fearful ocean of worldly life, which is very difficult to cross. He who understands the Pradhâna <a name="fr_1146"></a><a href="sbe0831.htm#fn_1141"><font size="1">5</font></a>, (though) attacked by birth and death and disease, sees one (principle of) consciousness in all beings possessed of consciousness <a name="fr_1147"></a><a href="sbe0831.htm#fn_1142"><font size="1">6</font></a>. Then seeking after the supreme seat, he becomes indifferent to everything <a name="fr_1148"></a><a href="sbe0831.htm#fn_1143"><font size="1">7</font></a>. O best (of men)! I will give you accurate instruction concerning it. Learn from me exhaustively, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a! the excellent knowledge concerning the eternal imperishable seat, which I am now about to declare.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1115"></a><a href="sbe0830.htm#fr_1120">241:8</a> He, in the preceding sentences, according to Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, means the self, through the mind, or 'putting forward' the mind, as said above. In this sentence, he takes 'he' to mean the mind itself; Brahman = the self; and the mind, he says, is called the Brahman, as it, like the self, is the cause of the <i>K</i>aitanya, intelligence, in all creatures.</p>

The three similes, says Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, show that the soul pervades the whole body, is yet imperceptible, and also unattached to the body.

 <p><a name="fn_1123"></a><a href="sbe0830.htm#fr_1128">243:1</a> This I take to mean restraint of the active organs, such as speech, &amp;c. 'Self-restraint' is rendered by Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a to mean 'concentration of mind.'</p>
