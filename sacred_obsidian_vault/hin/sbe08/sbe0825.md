 <p>O Sanatsu<i>g</i>âta! since you have spoken these words of highest significance, relating to the Brahman, and of numerous forms <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">4</font></a>, give me that advice which is excellent, and difficult to obtain in the</p>

 <p>midst of these created objects <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Such is my request, O youth!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Sanatsu<i>g</i>âta said:</p>
 <p>This Brahman, O king! about which you question me with such perseverance, is not to be attained by anybody who is in a hurry. When the mind is absorbed in the understanding <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">2</font></a>, then can that knowledge, which must be deeply pondered over, be attained by living the life of a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">3</font></a>. For you are speaking of that primordial knowledge <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">4</font></a>, which consists in the truth; which is obtained by the good by living the life of Brahma<i>k</i>ârins <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">5</font></a>; which being obtained, men cast off this mortal world; and which knowledge, verily, is to be invariably (found) in those who have been brought up under preceptors <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Dh<i>ri</i>tarâsh<i>t</i>ra said</p>
 <p>Since that knowledge is capable of being truly acquired by living the life of a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, therefore tell me, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a! of what description the life of a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin is <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Sanatsu<i>g</i>âta said:</p>

 <p>preceptor, and becoming (as it were) a ftus, practise the life of Brahma<i>k</i>ârins, become even in this world authors of Sâstras <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and they repair to the highest truth <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">2</font></a> after casting off (this) body. They subjugate desires here in this world, practising forbearance in pursuit of the Brahmic state <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and with courage, they even here remove the self out of the body <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">4</font></a>, like the soft fibres from the Muñ<i>g</i>a. Father and mother, O descendant of Bharata! only form the body. But the birth <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">5</font></a> obtained from the preceptor, that verily is true <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and likewise immortal. He perfects <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">7</font></a> (one), giving (one) immortality. Recognising what he has done (for one), one should not injure him. The disciple should always make obeisance to the preceptor <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">8</font></a>; and, free from heedlessness, should always desire sacred instruction. When the pure man obtains knowledge by this same course of discipleship <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">9</font></a>, that is the first quarter of his life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin. As (is) his conduct</p>

 <p>always towards his preceptor, so likewise should he behave towards the preceptor's wife, and so likewise should he act towards the preceptor's son--(that) is said to be the second quarter. What one, recognising what the preceptor has done for one, and understanding the matter <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">1</font></a> (taught), feels with a delighted heart regarding the preceptor--believing that one has been brought into existence <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">2</font></a> by him--that is the third quarter of life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin. One should do what is agreeable to the preceptor, by means of one's life and riches, and in deed, thought, and word <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">3</font></a>--that is said to be the fourth quarter. (A disciple) obtains a quarter by time <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">4</font></a>, so likewise a quarter by associating with the preceptor, he also obtains a quarter by means of his own energy; and then he attains to a quarter by means of the Sâstras. The life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin of that man, whose beauty <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">5</font></a> consists in the twelve beginning with knowledge, and whose limbs are the other (qualifications mentioned), and who has</p>

 <p>strength <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">1</font></a>, bears fruit, they say, by association with a preceptor, in (the shape of) contact with that entity--the Brahman. Whatever wealth may come to man who lives in this way, he should even pay that over to the preceptor. He would thus be adopting the conduct of the good which is of many merits; and the same conduct is (to be adopted) towards the preceptor's son. Living thus, he prospers greatly <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">2</font></a> on all sides in this world; he obtains sons and position; the quarters <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">3</font></a> and sub-quarters shower (benefits <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">4</font></a>) on him, and men pass their lives as Brahma<i>k</i>ârins under him. By this life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, the divinities obtained their divinity. And the sages, too, became great by living the life of Brahma<i>k</i>ârins. By this same (means), too, the Apsarasas, together with the Gandharvas, achieved for themselves beautiful forms. And by this life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, the sun illuminates (the universe). That man of knowledge, O king! who practising penance, may by penance pierce through or tear off his body, crosses beyond childhood <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">5</font></a> by means of this (life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin), and at the time of the termination (of life) obstructs death <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">6</font></a>. Those who understand this (life as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin) attain to a</p>

 <p>condition like that of those who as (for what they want) from the wish-giving stone <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">1</font></a>, when they obtain the thing desired. By performing action, O Kshatriya! people conquer (for themselves only) perishable worlds <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (But) the man of understanding attains by knowledge to the everlasting glory--for there is no other way to it <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

It is not in the stars, nor does it dwell in the lightning; nor is its form <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">7</font></a> to be seen in the clouds, nor even in the air, nor in the deities; it is not to be seen in the moon, nor in the sun.

It is seen in the self of a man of high vows <a name="fr_857"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">2</font></a>. It is invincible, beyond darkness <a name="fr_858"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">3</font></a>, it comes forth from within <a name="fr_859"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">4</font></a> at the time of destruction. Its form is minuter than the minutest (things), its form is larger even than the mountains <a name="fr_860"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">5</font></a>. That is the support <a name="fr_861"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">6</font></a> (of the universe); that is immortal; (that is) all things perceptible <a name="fr_862"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">7</font></a>. That is the Brahman, that is glory <a name="fr_863"></a><a href="#fn_858"><font size="1">8</font></a>. From that all entities were produced <a name="fr_864"></a><a href="#fn_859"><font size="1">9</font></a>, in that they are dissolved. All this shines forth as dwelling in it in the form of light <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_860"><font size="1">10</font></a>. And it is perceived by means of knowledge <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_861"><font size="1">11</font></a> by one who understands the self; on it depends this whole universe. Those who understand this become immortal.</p>

 <p>Grief and wrath, and avarice, desire, delusion, laziness, want of forgiveness, vanity, craving, friendship <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_863"><font size="1">2</font></a>, censoriousness, and reviling others--these twelve great enormities are destructive of a man's life. These, O king of kings! attend on each and every man. Beset by these, a man, deluded in his understanding, acts sinfully. A man full of attachments, merciless, harsh (of speech), talkative, cherishing wrath in his heart, and boastful--these are the men of cruel qualities; (such) persons, even obtaining wealth, do not always enjoy (it) <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_864"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p>One whose thoughts are fixed on enjoyments, who is partial <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">1</font></a>, proud <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">2</font></a>, boastful when he makes a gift, miserly, and devoid of power <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">3</font></a>, who esteems the group (of the senses), and who hates (his) wife--thus have been stated the seven (classes of) cruel persons of sinful dispositions. Piety, and truthfulness, and penance, and self-restraint, freedom from animosity, modesty, endurance, freedom from censoriousness, liberality, sacred learning, courage, forgiveness--these are the twelve great observances of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. Whoever does not swerve from these twelve may govern this whole world. And one who is possessed of three, two, or even one, of these, must be understood to have nothing of his own <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Self-restraint, abandonment, freedom from delusion, on these immortality depends <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">5</font></a>. These are possessed by those talented Brâhma<i>n</i>as to whom the Brahman is the principal <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">6</font></a> (thing). A Brâhma<i>n</i>a's speaking ill of others, whether true or false, is not commended.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> The men who act thus have their places in hell. Frenzy has eighteen defects--as already described here--hatred of men, factiousness <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">1</font></a>, censoriousness, untruthful speech, lust, wrath, wand of self-control <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">2</font></a>, speaking ill of others, backbiting, mismanagement in business <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">3</font></a>, quarrelsomeness, animosity, troubling living creatures, want of forgiveness, delusion, flippancy, loss of reason <a name="fr_879"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">4</font></a>, censoriousness <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">5</font></a>; therefore a wise man should not be subject to frenzy, for it is always censured. Six characteristics should be understood as (belonging) to friendship--that one should rejoice at (anything) agreeable, and feel grieved at (anything) disagreeable; that with a pure heart one, when asked by a deserving (man), should give to him who asks what can <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">6</font></a> certainly be given, (though it) may be beneficial to oneself, and even though it ought not to be asked, (namely) ones favourites, sons, wealth, and one's own wife; that one should not dwell there where one has bestowed (all one's) wealth, through a desire (to get a return for one's liberality); that one should enjoy (the</p>

Such a man, possessed of wealth, and possessed of merits, is a liberal man of the quality of goodness <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">3</font></a>; such a one diverts the five elements from the five <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">4</font></a> (senses). This <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">5</font></a> pure penance, acquired out of desire <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">6</font></a> by those who are. fallen off from the truth, even though developed, leads upwards <a name="fr_888"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">7</font></a>; since sacrifices are performed owing to a misapprehension of the truth <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">8</font></a>.

 <p>sacrifices) of some are by the mind, of others by speech, and also by deed. The man void of fancies takes precedence over the man perfected by fancies,--especially among Brâhma<i>n</i>as <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And hear this further from me. One should teach this great and glorious <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">2</font></a> (doctrine); (other doctrines) the wise call mere arrangements of words. On this, concentration of mind <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">3</font></a>, all this <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">4</font></a> depends. Those who know this become immortal. Not by meritorious action only, O king! does one conquer the truth <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">5</font></a>. One may offer offerings, or sacrifice. By that the child(-like man) does not cross beyond death; nor, O king! does he obtain happiness in his last moments <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">6</font></a>. One should practise devotion quietly, and should not be active even in the mind <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">7</font></a>; and then one should avoid delight and wrath (resulting) from praise and censure <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">8</font></a>. I say to you, O learned person! that adhering to this <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">9</font></a>, one attains the Brahman and perceives it, O Kshatriya! by a course (of study) of the Vedas.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_860"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_865">180:10</a> The explanations of the commentators are not quite clear as to the word ahnâ, 'in the form of light.' Probably the meaning is: The universe depends on the Brahman, and is, as it were, the light of the Brahman. <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara compares the passages referred to at Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0817.htm#page_112">p. 112</a>, note .</p>
 <p><a name="fn_861"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_866">180:11</a> 'Not by means of action,' says <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_862"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_867">181:1</a> The whole of this chapter is wanting in one of our copies of <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara's commentary. In the copy published in the Mahâbhârata (Madras edition) there is, however, this passage: 'Wrath &amp;c. have been already explained, still there are some differences here and there, and those only are now explained.' The chapter is for the most part a repetition of what we have already had. For such repetitions cf. B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, pp. 317-1016; 444-930. The same copy of <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara's commentary gives this general statement of the object of this and the next chapter: 'The course of study of the science of the Brahman, in which knowledge is the principal thing, and concentration of mind &amp;c. are subsidiary, has been. described. Now is described the course of study in which concentration of mind is principal, and knowledge subsidiary. The first mode consists in understanding the meaning of the word "you" by means of concentration of mind, and then identifying it with the Brahman by means of a study of the Upanishads; the second, in first intellectually understanding the identity of the individual self and Brahman, by such study of the Upanishads, and then realising the identity to consciousness by contemplation, &amp;c. In both modes the fruit is the same, and the means are the same; and to show this, the merits and defects already stated are here again declared.' This explanation is verbatim the same in Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a's commentary.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_863"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_868">181:2</a> The original is 'pity,' which is explained to mean 'friendship' by <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara and Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_864"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_869">181:3</a> 'Owing to there being in it no enjoyment for the self,' says one <a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a> copy of <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara's commentary. Another reading, which is in the Madras edition and in Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, may be rendered, 'even obtaining benefits, they do not respect one (from whom they obtain them).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_865"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_870">182:1</a> The commentary says the meaning is the same as that of the expression used in the corresponding place before, viz. one who prospers by injuring others.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_866"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_871">182:2</a> One copy of <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara's commentary takes this to mean one who thinks the not-self to be the self. I adopt the other meaning, however, as agreeing, with that of atimânî, which is the reading of some copies instead of abhimânî.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_867"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_872">182:3</a> Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a reads durbala and does not explain it. See <a href="sbe0824.htm#page_167">p. 167</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_868"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_873">182:4</a> One commentator says this means that he should not be supposed to have incurred the demerit of having any attachment to this world. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says, he gives up everything in the pursuit of even one of these observances.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_871"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_876">183:1</a> One copy of <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara's commentary says this means 'obstructing other people's acts of piety,' &amp;c.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_873"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_878">183:3</a> One copy says this means 'inattention to any work undertaken.,' another renders the original by 'destruction of property, i.e. squandering it on dancers,' &amp;c.</p>

But neither the texts nor the commentaries give any help to correct the error. Perhaps the latter is to be distinguished as referring to the habit, and the former only to sporadic acts, of censoriousness. These qualities, I presume, constitute frenzy; they are not the 'defects.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_880"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_885">184:4</a> The commentators take this to mean objects of sense, and they interpret 'elements' before to mean senses.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_884"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_889">184:8</a> Cf. Mu<i>nd</i>aka, p. 277. I must own that I do not quite understand this passage, nor its explanation as given in the commentaries. I do not quite see what the penance here mentioned has to do with sacrifice, and yet the commentators seem to take the words 'since sacrifices,' &amp;c., with what precedes them, not with what follows. Taking them,. however, with what follows, it is difficult to explain the word 'since.' As far as I can understand the passage I take the sense of it to be as follows: The author having said that penance performed out of a particular motive does not lead to final emancipation, he then proceeds to point out that all 'action' or 'sacrifice' is due to an imperfect understanding of the truth (cf. <a href="sbe0824.htm#page_171">p. 171</a> supra), being mostly due to some particular motive. Then he goes on to show the different classes of sacrifice, and finally points out that he who is free from desires as superior to one who is actuated by desires. The original for 'misapprehension' is avabodha, which commonly means 'apprehension,' but <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara finally makes it mean moha or 'delusion.' The original for truth is rendered by Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a to mean 'fancies.' Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says that the sacrifice by the mind is the highest; that by speech, viz. Brahmaya<i>g</i>ña, <i>G</i>apa, &amp;c., is middling; and that by deed, viz. with clarified butter and other offerings, of the lowest class. 'Perfected by fancies' = one whose fancies are always fulfilled 'through a knowledge,' says Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, 'of the Brahma as possessing qualities.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_885"></a><a href="sbe0825.htm#fr_890">185:1</a> This also is far from clear. Should it be, 'and a Brâhma<i>n</i>a more especially?' This might be taken as referring to one who knows the Brahman as devoid of qualities, as Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a does take it. But his construction is not quite clear.</p>
