 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XIX.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a's wife said:</p>
 <p>This is not possible to be understood by one whose self <a name="fr_1476"></a><a href="#fn_1471"><font size="1">1</font></a> is frivolous, or by one whose self is not refined; and my intelligence is very frivolous, and narrow, and confused. Tell me the means by which this knowledge is acquired. I (wish to) learn from you the source from which that knowledge proceeds.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said</p>
 <p>Know that he who devotes himself to the Brahman is the (lower) Arani, the instructor is the upper Arani. Penance and sacred learning cause the attrition <a name="fr_1477"></a><a href="#fn_1472"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and from that the fire of knowledge is produced.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a's wife said:</p>
 <p>As to this symbol of the Brahman which is denominated the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña, where, indeed, is (to be found) a description of it, by which it <a name="fr_1478"></a><a href="#fn_1473"><font size="1">3</font></a> is capable of being comprehended?</p>

 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhmana said:</p>
 <p>He is without symbols <a name="fr_1479"></a><a href="#fn_1474"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and also without qualities; nothing exists that is a cause of him. I will only state the means by which he can be comprehended or not. A good means is found, namely, action <a name="fr_1480"></a><a href="#fn_1475"><font size="1">2</font></a> and knowledge, by which that <a name="fr_1481"></a><a href="#fn_1476"><font size="1">3</font></a> (entity), which has the symbols (useful) for knowledge <a name="fr_1482"></a><a href="#fn_1477"><font size="1">4</font></a> attributed to it through ignorance, is perceived as by bees <a name="fr_1483"></a><a href="#fn_1478"><font size="1">5</font></a>. In the (rules for) final emancipation, it is not laid down, that a certain thing should be done, and a certain thing should not <a name="fr_1484"></a><a href="#fn_1479"><font size="1">6</font></a>. But the knowledge of the things beneficial to the self is produced in one who sees and hears <a name="fr_1485"></a><a href="#fn_1480"><font size="1">7</font></a>. One should adopt as many of these things, (which are) means of direct perception, as may here be practicable--unperceived, and those whose form is perceived <a name="fr_1486"></a><a href="#fn_1481"><font size="1">8</font></a>, in hundreds and in thousands, all of various descriptions. Then one reaches near that beyond which nothing exists.</p>

 <p align="CENTER">Ar<i>g</i>una said:</p>
 <p>Where, indeed, O K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a! is that Brâhma<i>n</i>a's wife, and where is that chief of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, by both of whom this perfection was attained? Tell me about them both, O undegraded one!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Deity said:</p>
 <p>Know my mind to be the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and know my understanding to be the Brâhmana's wife. And he, O Dhanañ<i>g</i>aya! who has been spoken of as the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña, is I myself <a name="fr_1489"></a><a href="sbe0847.htm#fn_1484"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
