 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER IX.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>On this, too, they relate this ancient story, a dialogue between Nârada and the sage Devamata.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Devamata said:</p>
 <p>When a creature is about to be born, what comes into existence first, his Prâ<i>n</i>a, or Apâna, or Samâna, or Vyâna, or else Udâna?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Nârada said:</p>
 <p>By whichever the creature is produced, that which is other than this first comes to him. And the pairs of the life-winds should be understood, which (move) upwards, or downwards, or transversely.</p>

 <p align="CENTER">Devamata said:</p>
 <p>By which (of the life-winds) is a creature produced? and which (of them) first comes to him? Explain to me also the pairs of the life-winds, which (move) upwards, or downwards, or transversely.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Nârada said:</p>
 <p>Pleasure is produced from a mental operation <a name="fr_1313"></a><a href="#fn_1308"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and (it) is also produced from a sound, (it) is also produced from taste, and (it) is also produced from colour, and (it) is also produced from touch, and (it) is also produced from smell. This is the effect <a name="fr_1314"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the Udâna; the pleasure is produced from union <a name="fr_1315"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">3</font></a>. From desire the semen is produced; and from the semen is produced menstrual excretion. The semen and the blood are produced by the Samâna and the Vyâna in common <a name="fr_1316"></a><a href="#fn_1311"><font size="1">4</font></a>. From the combination of the semen and the blood, the Prâ<i>n</i>a comes first into operation; and the semen being developed by the Prâ<i>n</i>a, the Apâna then comes into operation. The pair Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna go upwards and downwards, and the Samâna and Vyâna are called the pair (moving) transversely. It is the teaching of the</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Veda, that the fire verily is all the deities <a name="fr_1317"></a><a href="#fn_1312"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and knowledge (of it) arises among Brâhma<i>n</i>as, being accompanied by intelligence <a name="fr_1318"></a><a href="#fn_1313"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The smoke of that (fire), which is of excellent glory, (appears) in the shape of (the quality of) darkness; (its) ashes, (the quality of) passion; and (the quality of) goodness is that in connexion with it <a name="fr_1319"></a><a href="#fn_1314"><font size="1">3</font></a>, in which the offering is thrown. Those who understand the sacrifice understand the Samâna and the Vyâna as the principal (offering). The Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna are portions <a name="fr_1320"></a><a href="#fn_1315"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the offering of clarified butter, and between them is the fire. That is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma<i>n</i>as <a name="fr_1321"></a><a href="#fn_1316"><font size="1">5</font></a> As to that which is distinct from these pairs <a name="fr_1322"></a><a href="#fn_1317"><font size="1">6</font></a>, hear me speak about</p>

 <p>that. Day and night are a pair, between them is the fire. That is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma<i>n</i>as. That which exists and that which does not exist are a pair, between them is the fire. That is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma<i>n</i>as. The two--good and evil--:are a pair, between them is the fire. That is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma<i>n</i>as. First <a name="fr_1323"></a><a href="sbe0837.htm#fn_1318"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the Samâna and Vyâna, their function <a name="fr_1324"></a><a href="sbe0837.htm#fn_1319"><font size="1">2</font></a> is performed: then, secondly, the Samâna comes into operation again. Then the Vâmadevya <a name="fr_1325"></a><a href="sbe0837.htm#fn_1320"><font size="1">3</font></a> for tranquillity, and tranquillity is the eternal Brahman. This is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma<i>n</i>as.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1305"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1310">274:1</a> This is not quite clear. I presume it means that each one has the generic qualities which make the others great in their own spheres; but the specific qualities are different.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1306"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1311">274:2</a> The one life-wind is supposed, here to be generally unmoving, but its distribution among the different parts of the body as specified, for instance, in the commentary on the Yoga-sûtra III, 38, gives it the different names. The expression does not seem to be quite accurate for this, which nevertheless seems to be the true, sense.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1307"></a><a href="sbe0835.htm#fr_1312">274:3</a> Another reading is, 'That one is my own self.' Cf. Maitrî, pp. 28 seq., 105, and B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka p. 169.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1308"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1313">275:1</a> I. e. desire. 'Sound' = recollection of a woman's voice; taste,' scil. of chastity; 'colour' = the beauty of a woman, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra Cf. Âpastamba I, 2, 7, 8, and Lalita Vistara, p. 19.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1309"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1314">275:2</a> Literally, 'form,' which Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra interprets to mean effect, and adds, 'The Udâna causes mental activity, and by mental activity sound &amp;c. are apprehended.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1310"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1315">275:3</a> I. e. of Udâna and mind, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra; adding, 'the result is that a creature is produced by the Udâna.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1311"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1316">275:4</a> Or, perhaps, generally, that is to say, the store of them, the specific semen being produced from desire, as before stated. The Samâna's function is the digestion of food, and that of the Vyâna is the distribution of the digested food to the whole body through the nâ<i>d</i>îs, hence the proposition in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1312"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1317">276:1</a> Cf. inter alia, Aitareya-brâhma<i>n</i>a (Haug's ed.), p. 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1313"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1318">276:2</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says intelligence means 'discussion, or argument.' The connexion of this with what has gone before, according to Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, is this, that the author having first stated the five Hot<i>ri</i>s fully, now explains in what the Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna are to be offered up for acquiring the Prâ<i>n</i>âyâma. The fire he takes to mean the self. Cf. what has been said about Vaisvânara above, <a href="sbe0832.htm#page_259">p. 259</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1314"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1319">276:3</a> That is to say, the flame, 'take it. 'He is drawing out here the figure of the fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1315"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1320">276:4</a> These are only a subordinate part of the offering, called Â<i>g</i>yabhâga. They are called subordinate, I suppose, as the operations of the Samâna and Vyâna are more practically important for vitality. The fire is the self. The place of the principal offering is between the Â<i>g</i>yabhâgas, as stated by Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1316"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1321">276:5</a> The Udâna is here treated as the life-wind into which the others are to be offered up. See <a href="sbe0832.htm#page_258">p. 258</a>, and note  <a href="sbe0832.htm#fn_1232"><font size="1">8</font></a> there.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1317"></a><a href="sbe0836.htm#fr_1322">276:6</a> The next three sentences seem to indicate what is to be destroyed in common with the life-winds. One has to get rid of all notions about day and night, good and evil, existence and non-existence, and then final emancipation is reached. The fire, which is common to all the passages, stands for the self; into that apparently all the ideas of time, and good and evil, and so forth, are to be offered as the life-winds are; and that fire stands in the place of <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a> the Udâna, for this purpose, as into the last all the other life-winds have to be offered. As to that which exists, &amp;c., cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0815.htm#page_103">p. 103</a>, and <a href="sbe0859.htm#page_370">p. 370</a>, note  <a href="sbe0859.htm#fn_1909"><font size="1">9</font></a> infra. As to good and evil and generally, cf. <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 60; Kaushîtaki, p. 19. They are nothing to one who knows the Brahman. Day and night Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra takes to mean the I<i>d</i>â and Pi<u>n</u>galâ nâ<i>d</i>îs, between which is the Sushum<i>n</i>â, as they are connected with the sun and moon. But the sense of the whole passage is far from clear.</p>
