 This is a collection of essays by Sister Nivedita, Margaret E. Noble,
 an Anglo-Irish Hindu convert who moved to India and devoted herself
 to helping poor women of all castes.
 It includes an appreciative introduction by
 <a href="../tagore/index.htm">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, the
 Nobel laureate writer, one of her many friends in the
 Bengali artistic community.
 </p>
 <p>
 Although long out of print, this book was a sensation when it
 was originally published.
 Nivedita here espouses Hindu pan-Indian nationalism,
 while also rationalizing some of the aspects of Indian
 life such as the caste system.
 She deals with the historical background of religious tolerance in India,
 including the contributions of Muslims and Buddhists,
 and the ability of Hinduism to assimilate compatible doctrines,
 no matter what their source.</p>
 <p>
 Nivedita has a unique and much beloved position in Indian history
 as one of the few westerners who took up the cause of Indian independence.
 You will come away from reading this book
 with a new appreciation for the problems which India faced in forging
 a democratic nation based on diversity.
