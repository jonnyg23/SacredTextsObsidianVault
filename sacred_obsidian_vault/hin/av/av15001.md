 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1500101">1</a></font></span>There was a roaming Vrātya. He roused Prajāpati to action.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1500102">2</a></font></span>Prajāpati beheld gold in himself and engendered it.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1500103">3</a></font></span>That became unique, that became distinguished, that became<br>    great, that became excellent, that became Devotion, that be-<br>    came holy Fervour, that became Truth: through that he was<br>    born.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1500104">4</a></font></span>He grew, he became great, he became Mahādeva.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1500105">5</a></font></span>He gained the lordship of the Gods.
