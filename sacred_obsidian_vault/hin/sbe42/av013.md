   <h2 align="center">II, 3. Charm against excessive discharges from the body, undertaken with spring-water.</h2>  
 <p>1. The spring-water yonder which runs down upon the mountain, that do I render healing for thee, in order that thou mayest contain a potent remedy.<br> 2. Then surely, yea quite surely, of the hundred remedies contained in thee, thou art the most superior in checking discharges and removing pain.<br> 3. Deep down do the Asuras bury this great healer of wounds: that is the cure for discharges, and thal hath removed disease.<br> 4. The ants bring the remedy from the sea: that is the cure for discharges, and that hath quieted disease.<br> 5. This great healer of wounds has been gotten out of the earth: that is the cure for discharges, and<br> that hath removed disease.<br> 6. May the waters afford us welfare, may the herbs be propitious to us I Indra's bolt shall beat off the Rakshas, far (from us) shall fly the arrows cast by the Rakshas!</p>
