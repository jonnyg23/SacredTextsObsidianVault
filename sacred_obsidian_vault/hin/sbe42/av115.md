   <h2 align="center">II, 30. Charm to secure the love of a woman.</h2>  
 <p>1. As the wind tears this grass from the surface of the earth, thus do I tear thy soul, so that thou, woman, shalt love, shalt not be averse to me!<br> 2. If ye, O two Asvins, shall unite and bring together the loving pair-united are the fortunes of,both of you (lovers), united the thoughts, united the purposes!<br> 3. When birds desire to chirp, lustily desire to chirp, may my call go there, as an arrow-point upon the shaft!<br> 4. What is within shall be without, what is without shall be within! Take captive, O herb, the, soul of the maidens endowed with every chai-m!<br> 5. Longing for a husband this woman hath come, I have come longing for a wife, As a loudly neighing horFe I have attained to my good fortune!</p>
