   <h2 align="center">VI, 77. Charm to cause the return of a truant woman.</h2>  
 <p>1. The heavens have stood, the earth has stood, all creatures have stood. The mountains have stood upon their foundation, the horses in the stable I have caused to stand.<br> 2. Him that has control of departure, that has control of coming home, return, and turning in, that shepherd do I also call.<br> 3. O Gâtavedas (Agni), cause thou to turn ill; a hundred way's hither shall be thine, a thousand modes of return shall be thine: with these do thou restore us again!</p>
