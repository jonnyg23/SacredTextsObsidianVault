   <h2 align="center">IV, 20. Charm with a certain plant (sadampushpâ) which exposes demons and enemies.</h2>  
 <p>1. He sees here, he sees yonder, he sees in the distance, he sees--the sky, the atmosphere as well as the earth, all that, O goddess, he sees.<br> 2. The three heavens, the three earths, and these six directions severally; all creatures may I see through thee, O divine plant!<br> 3. Thou art verily the eyeball of the divine eagle; thou didst ascend the earth as a weary woman a palanquin.<br> 4. The thousand-eyed god shall put this plant into my right hand: with that do I see every one, the Sûdra as well as the Ârya.<br> 5. Reveal (all) forms, do not hide thy own self; moreover, do thou, O thousand-eyed (plant), look the Kimîdins in the face!<br> 6. Reveal to me the wizards, and reveal the witches, reveal all the Pisâkas: for this purpose do I take hold of thee, O plant!<br> 7. Thou art the eye of Kasyapa, and the eye of the four-eyed bitch. Like the sun, moving in the bright day, make thou the Pisâka evident to me!<br> 8. I have dragged out from his retreat the sorcerer and the Kimîdin. Through this (charm) do I see every one, the Sûdra as well as the Ârya.<br> 9. Him that flies in the air, him that moves across the sky, him that regards the earth as his resort, that Pisâka do thou reveal (to me)!</p>
