   <h2 align="center">VI, 102. Charm to secure the love of a woman.</h2>  
 <p>1. As this draught animal, O ye Asvins, comes on, and proceeds, thus may thy soul come on, and proceed to me!<br> 2. I draw to myself thy mind, as the leading stallion the female side-horse. As the stalk of grass torn by the wind, thus shall thy mind fasten itself upon me!<br> 3. A coaxing mixture of salve, of sweet wood, of kushtha, and of spikenard, do I deftly pick out with the hands of Bhaga (good fortune).</p>
