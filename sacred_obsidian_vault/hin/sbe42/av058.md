   <h2 align="center">VI, 85. Exorcism of disease by means of an amulet from the varana-tree.</h2>  
 <p>1. This divine tree, the varana, shall shut out (vârayâtai). The gods, too, have shut out (avîvaran) the disease that hath entered into this man!<br> 2. By Indra's command, by Mitra's and by Varuna's, by the command of all the gods do we shut out thy disease.<br> 3. As Vritra did bold fast these ever-flowing waters, thus do I shut out (vâraye) disease from thee with (the help of) Agni Vaisvânara.</p>
