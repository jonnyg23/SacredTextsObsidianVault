   <h2 align="center">VI, 90. Charm against internal pain (colic), due to the missiles of Rudra.</h2>  
 <p>1. The arrow that Rudra did cast upon thee, into (thy) limbs, and into thy heart, this here do we now draw out away from thee.<br> 2. From the hundred arteries which are distributed along thy limbs, from all of these do we exorcise forth the poisons.<br> 3. Adoration be to thee, O Rudra, as thou casteth (thy arrow); adoration to the (arrow) when it has been placed upon (the bow); adoration to it as it is being hurled; adoration to it when it has fallen down!</p>
