   <h2 align="center">VI, 83. Charm for curing scrofulous sores called apakit.</h2>  
 <p>1. Fly forth, ye apakit (sores), as an eagle from the nest! Sûrya (the sun) shall prepare a remedy, Kandramâs (the moon) shall shine you away!<br> 2. One is variegated, one is white, one is black, and two are red: I have gotten the names of all of them. Go ye away without slaying men!<br> 3. The apakit, the daughter of the black one, without bearing offspring will fly away; the boil will fly away from here, the galunta (swelling) will perish.<br> 4. Consume thy own (proper) oblation with gratification in thy mind, when I here offer svâhâ in my mind!</p>
