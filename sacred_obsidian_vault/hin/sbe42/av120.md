   <h2 align="center">VII, 139. Charm to arouse the passionate love of a woman.</h2>  
 <p>1. Clinging to the ground thou didst grow, (O plant), that producest bliss for me; a hundred branches extend from thee, three and thirty grow down from thee: with this plant of a thousand leaves thy heart do I parch.<br> 2. Thy heart shall parch (with love) for me, and thy mouth shall parch (with love for me)! Languish, moreover, with love for me, with parched mouth pass thy days!<br> 3. Thou that causest affection, kindlest (love), brown, lovely (plant), draw (us) together; draw together yonder woman and myself, our hearts make the same!<br> 4. As the mouth of him that hath not drunk dries tip, thus languish thou with love for me, with parched mouth pass thy days!<br> 5. As the Ichneumon tears the serpent, and joins him together again, thus, O potent (plant), join together what hath been torn by love!</p>
