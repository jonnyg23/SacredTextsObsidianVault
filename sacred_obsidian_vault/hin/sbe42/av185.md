Let us have good weather at noon, good weather at eve, good weather in the early morning, good weather in the niyht<br> 3. For day and night, for the stars, for sun and moon, and for us prepare good weather, O king Sakadhûma!<br> 4. To thee, O Sakadhûma, ruler of the stars, that gavest us good weather in the evening in the night, and by day, let there ever be obeisance!</p>
