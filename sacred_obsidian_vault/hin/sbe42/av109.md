   <h2 align="center">III, 23. Charm for obtaining a son (pumsavanam).</h2>  
 <p>1. That which has caused thee to miscarry do we drive away from thee, that very thing do we deposit outside of thee, away in a far place.<br> 2. Into thy womb shall enter a male germ, as an arrow into a quiver! May a man be born there, a son ten months old!<br> 3. A male son do thou produce, and after him a male shall be born! Thou shalt be the mother of sons, of those who are born, and those whom thou shalt bear!<br> 4. By the effective seed which bulls put forth do thou obtain a son; be a fruitful milch-cow!<br> 5. Pragâpati's (the lord of creatures) work do I perform for thee: may the germ enter into thy womb! Obtain thou, woman, a son who shall bring prosperity to thee, and bring thou pi-osperity to him!<br> 6. The plants whose father was the sky, whose mother the earth, Whose root the (heavenly) ocean--may those divine herbs aid thee in obtaining a son!</p>
