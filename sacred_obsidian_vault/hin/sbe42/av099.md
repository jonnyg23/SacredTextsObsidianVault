   <h2 align="center">VI, 75. Oblation for the suppression of enemies (nairbâdhyam havih).</h2>  
 <p>1. Forth from his home do I drive that person yonder, who as a rival contends with us: through the oblation devoted to suppression Indra, has broken him to pieces.<br> 2. Indra, the slayer of Vritra, shall drive him to the remotest distance, from which in all successive years he shall not again return!<br> 3. He shall go to the three distances, he shall go beyond the five peoples; he shall go beyond the three ethers, whence he shall not again in all successive years return, while the sun is upon the heavens!</p>
