   <h2 align="center">VI, 91. Barley and water as universal remedies.</h2>  
 <p>1. This barley they did plough vigorously, with yokes of eight and yokes of six. With it I drive off to a far distance the ailment from thy body.<br> 2. Downward blows the wind, downward burns the sun, downward the cow is milked: downward shall thy ailment pass!<br> 3. The waters verily are healing, the waters chase away disease, the waters cure all (disease): may they prepare a remedy for thee!</p>
