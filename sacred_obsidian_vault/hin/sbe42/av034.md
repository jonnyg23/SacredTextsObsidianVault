   <h2 align="center">I, 17. Charm to stop the flow of blood.</h2>  
 <p>1. The maidens that go yonder, the veins, clothed in red garments, like sisters without a brother, bereft of strength, they shall stand still!<br> 2. Stand still, thou lower one, stand still, thou higher one; do thou in the middle also stand still! The most tiny (vein) stands still: may then the great artery also stand still!<br> Of the hundred arteries, and the thousand veins, those in the middle here have indeed stood still. At the same time the ends have ceased (to flow).<br> 4. Around you has passed a great sandy dike: stand ye still, pray take your case!</p>
