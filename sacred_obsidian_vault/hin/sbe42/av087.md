   <h2 align="center">VII, 65. Charm with the apâmârga-plant, against curses, and the consequences of sinful deeds.</h2>  
 <p>1. With fruit turned backward thou verily didst grow, O apâmârga: do thou drive all curses quite far away from here!<br> 2. The evil deeds and foul, or the sinful acts which we have committed, with thee, O apâmârga, whose face is turned to every side, do we wipe them out (apa mrigmahe).<br> 3. If we have sat together with one who has black teeth, or diseased nails, or one who is deformed, with thee, O apâmârga, we wipe all that out (apa mrigmahe).</p>
