   <h2 align="center">VI, 21. Charm to promote the growth of hair.</h2>  
 <p>1. Of these three earths (our) earth verily is the highest. From the surface of these I have now plucked a remedy.<br> 2. Thou art the most excellent of remedies, the best of plants, as Soma (the moon) is the lord in the watches of the night, as Varuna (is king) among the gods.<br> 3. O ye wealthy, irresistible (plants), ye do generously bestow benefits. And ye strengthen the hair, and, moreover, promote its increase.</p>
