 <p>III. 90. <i>naihar se jiyarâ phâ<b>t</b> re</i></p> 
 <p>MY heart cries aloud for the house of my lover; the open road and the shelter of a roof are all one to her who has lost the city of her husband.<br> My heart finds no joy in anything: my mind and my body are distraught.<br> His palace has a million gates, but there is a vast ocean between it and me:<br> How shall I cross it, O friend? for endless is the outstretching of the path.<br> How wondrously this lyre is wrought! When its strings are rightly strung, it maddens the heart: but when the keys are broken and the strings are loosened, none regard it more.<br> I tell my parents with laughter that I must go to my Lord in the morning; <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></a></p> 
 <p>They are angry, for they do not want me to go, and they say: "She thinks she has gained such dominion over her husband that she can have whatsoever she wishes; and therefore she is impatient to go to him."<br> Dear friend, lift my veil lightly now; for this is the night of love.<br> Kabîr says: "Listen to me! My heart is eager to meet my lover: I lie sleepless upon my bed. Remember me early in the morning!"</p>
