 <p>II. 22. <i>man tu pâr utar kâ<u>n</u>h jaiho</i></p> 
 <p>To what shore would you cross, O my heart? there is no traveller before you, there is no road:<br> Where is the movement, where is the rest, on that shore?<br> There is no water; no boat, no boatman, is there;<br> There is not so much as a rope to tow the boat, nor a man to draw it.<br> No earth, no sky, no time, no thing, is there: no shore, no ford!<br> There, there is neither body nor mind: and where is the place that shall still the thirst of the soul? You shall find naught in that emptiness.<br> Be strong, and enter into your own <a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></a> body: for there your foothold is firm. Consider it well, O my heart! go not elsewhere,<br> Kabîr says: "Put all imaginations away, and stand fast in that which you are."</p>
