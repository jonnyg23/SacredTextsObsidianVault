 <p>II. 105. <i>man mast huâ tab kyo<u>n</u> bole</i></p> 
 <p>WHERE is the need of words, when love has made drunken the heart?<br> I have wrapped the diamond in my cloak; why open it again and again?<br> When its load was light, the pan of the balance went up: now it is full, where is the need for weighing?<br> The swan has taken its flight to the lake beyond the mountains; why should it search for the pools and ditches any more?<br> Your Lord dwells within you: why need your outward eyes be opened?<br> Kabîr says: "Listen, my brother! my Lord, who ravishes my eyes, has united Himself with me."</p>
