 <p>I. 109. <i>sâî<u>n</u> ke sa<b>n</b>gat sâsur âî</i></p> 
 <p>CAME with my Lord to my Lord's home: but I lived not with Him and I tasted Him not, and my youth passed away like a dream.<br> On my wedding night my women-friends sang in chorus, and I was anointed with the unguents of pleasure and pain:<br> But when the ceremony was over, I left my Lord and came away, and my kinsman tried to console me upon the road.<br> Kabîr says, "I shall go to my Lord's house with my love at my side; then shall I sound the trumpet of triumph!"</p>
