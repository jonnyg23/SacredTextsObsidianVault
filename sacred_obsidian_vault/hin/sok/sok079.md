 <p>III. 63. <i>kahai<u>n</u> Kabîr, s'uno ho sâdho</i></p> 
 <p>KABÎR says: "O Sadhu! hear my deathless words. If you want your own good, examine and consider them well.<br> You have estranged yourself from the Creator, of whom you have sprung: you have lost your reason, you have bought death.<br> All doctrines and all teachings are sprung from Him, from Him they grow: know this for certain, and have no fear.<br> Hear from me the tidings of this great truth!<br> Whose name do you sing, and on whom do you meditate? O, come forth from this entanglement!<br> He dwells at the heart of all things, so why take refuge in empty desolation? <a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></a><br> If you place the Guru at a distance from you, then it is but the distance that you honour:<br> If indeed the Master be far away, then who is it else that is creating this world?<br> When you think that He is not here, then you wander further and further away, and seek Him in vain with tears.<br> Where He is far off, there He is unattainable: where He is near, He is very bliss.<br> Kabîr says: "Lest His servant should suffer pain He pervades him through and through."<br> Know yourself then, O Kabîr; for He is in you from head to foot.<br> Sing with gladness, and keep your seat unmoved within your heart.</p>
