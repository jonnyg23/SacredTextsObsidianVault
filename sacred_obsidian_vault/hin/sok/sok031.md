 <p>II. 95. <i>yâ tarvar me<u>n</u> ek pakherû</i></p> 
 <p>ON this tree is a bird: it dances in the joy of life.<br> None knows where it is: and who knows what the burden of its music may be?<br> Where the branches throw a deep <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></a> shade, there does it have its nest: and it comes in the evening and flies away in the morning, and says not a word of that which it means.<br> None tell me of this bird that sings within me.<br> It is neither coloured nor colourless: it has neither form nor outline:<br> It sits in the shadow of love.<br> It dwells within the Unattainable, the Infinite, and the Eternal; and no one marks when it comes and goes.<br> Kabîr says: "O brother Sadhu! deep is the mystery. Let wise men seek to know where rests that bird."</p>
