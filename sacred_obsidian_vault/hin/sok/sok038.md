 <p>I. 36. <i>sûr parkâs', tanh rain kahâ<u>n</u> pâïye</i></p> 
 <p>WHERE is the night, when the sun is shining? If it is night, then the sun withdraws its light. Where knowledge is, can ignorance endure? <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a> If there be ignorance, then knowledge must die.<br> If there be lust, how can love be there? Where there is love, there is no lust.</p> 
 <p>Lay hold on your sword, and join in the fight. Fight, O my brother, as long as life lasts.<br> Strike off your enemy's head, and there make an end of him quickly: then come, and bow your head at your King's Durbar.<br> He who is brave, never forsakes the battle: he who flies from it is no true fighter.<br> In the field of this body a great war goes forward, against passion, anger, pride, and greed:<br> It is in the kingdom of truth, contentment and purity, that this battle is raging; and the sword that rings forth most loudly is the sword of His Name. <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a><br> Kabîr says: "When a brave knight takes the field, a host of cowards is put to flight.<br> It is a hard fight and a weary one, this fight of the truth-seeker: for the vow of the truth-seeker is more hard than that of the warrior, or of the widowed wife who would follow her husband.<br> For the warrior fights for a few hours, and the widow's struggle with death is soon ended:<br> But the truth-seeker's battle goes on day and night, as long as life lasts it never ceases."</p>
