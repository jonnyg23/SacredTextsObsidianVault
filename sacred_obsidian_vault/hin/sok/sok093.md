 <p>THE woman who is parted from her lover spins at the spinning wheel.<br> The city of the body arises in its beauty; and within it the palace of the mind has been built.<br> The wheel of love revolves in the sky, and the seat is made of the jewels of knowledge:<br> What subtle threads the woman weaves, and makes them fine with love and reverence! <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></a><br> Kabîr says: "I am weaving the garland of day and night. When my Lover comes and touches me with His feet, I shall offer Him my tears."</p>
