 <p>II. 48. <i>jis se rahani apâr jagat me<u>n</u></i></p> 
 <p>MORE than all else do I cherish at heart that love which makes me to live a limitless life in this world.<br> It is like the lotus, which lives in the water and blooms in the water: yet the water cannot touch its petals, they open beyond its reach.<br> It is like a wife, who enters the fire at the bidding of love. She burns and lets others grieve, yet never dishonours love.<br> This ocean of the world is hard to cross: its waters are very deep. Kabîr says: "Listen to me, O Sadhu! few there are who have reached its end."</p>
