 <p>HE is the real Sadhu, who can reveal the form of the Formless to the vision of these eyes:<br> Who teaches the simple way of attaining Him, that is other than rites or ceremonies:<br> Who does not make you close the doors, and hold the breath, and renounce the world:<br> Who makes you perceive the Supreme Spirit wherever the mind attaches itself:<br> Who teaches you to be still in the midst of all your activities.<br> Ever immersed in bliss, having no fear in his mind, he keeps the spirit of <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></a> union in the midst of all enjoyments.<br> The infinite dwelling of the Infinite Being is everywhere: in earth, water, sky, and air:<br> Firm as the thunderbolt, the seat of the seeker is established above the void.<br> He who is within is without: I see Him and none else.</p>
