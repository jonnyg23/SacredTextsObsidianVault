 <p>KABÎR ponders and says: "He who has neither caste nor country, who is formless and without quality, fills all space."<br> The Creator brought into being the Game of Joy: and from the word Om the Creation sprang. <a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></a><br> The earth is His joy; His joy is the sky;<br> His joy is the flashing of the sun and the moon;<br> His joy is the beginning, the middle, and the end;<br> His joy is eyes, darkness, and light.<br> Oceans and waves are His joy: His joy the Sarasvati, the Jumna, and the Ganges.<br> The Guru is One: and life and death., union and separation, are all His plays of joy!<br> His play the land and water, the whole universe!<br> His play the earth and the sky!<br> In play is the Creation spread out, in play it is established. The whole world, says Kabîr, rests in His play, yet still the Player remains unknown.</p>
