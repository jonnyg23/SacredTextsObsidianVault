 <p align="center">SON</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%">Since soon the days of mortals end,<br> How ought the wise their lives to spend?<br> What course should I, to duty true,<br> My sire, from youth to age pursue?</div>  
 <p align="center">FATHER</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%">Begin thy course with study; store<br> The mind with holy Vedic lore.<br> That stage completed,—seek a wife,<br> And gain the fruit of wedded life,<br> A race of sons, by rites to seal,<br> When thou art gone, thy spirit's weal.<br> Then light the sacred fires, and bring<br> The gods a fitting offering.<br> When age draws nigh, the world forsake,<br> Thy chosen home the forest make;<br> And there a calm, ascetic sage,<br> A war against thy passions wage,<br> That, cleansed from every earthly stain, <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a><br> Thou may’st supreme perfection gain.</div>  
 <p align="center">SON</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%">And art thou then, my father, wise,<br> When thou dost such a life advise?<br> What wise or thoughtful man delights<br> In formal studies, empty rites?<br> Should such pursuits and thoughts engage<br> A mortal more than half his age?<br> The world is ever vexed, distressed;<br> The noiseless robbers never rest.</div>  
 <p align="center">FATHER</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%">Tell how the world is vexed, distressed;<br> What noiseless robbers never rest?<br> What means thy dark, alarming speech?<br> In plainer words thy meaning teach.</div>  
 <p align="center">SON</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%">The world is vexed by death; decay<br> The frames of mortals wears away.<br> Dost thou not note the circling flight<br> Of those still robbers, day and night,<br> With stealthy tread which hurrying past,<br> Steal all our lives away at last?<br> When well I know how death infests<br> This world of woe, and never rests, <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></a><br> How can I still, in thoughtless mood,<br> Confide in future earthly good?<br> Since life with every night that goes,<br> Still shorter, and yet shorter grows,<br> Must not the wise perceive how vain<br> Are all their days that yet remain?<br> We, whom life's narrow bounds confine,<br> Like fish in shallow water, pine.<br>     While men on other thoughts are bent,—<br> Like those on gathering flowers intent,—<br> As lambs by wolves are snatched away,—<br> They fall to death a sudden prey,<br> Before they yet the good have gained<br> For which they every nerve had strained.<br>     No moment lose; in serious mood<br> Begin at once to practice good;<br> To-morrow's task to-day conclude;<br> The evening's work complete at noon:—<br> No duty can be done too soon.<br> Who knows whom death may seize to-night,<br> And who shall see the morning light?<br> And death will never stop to ask,<br> If thou hast done, or not, thy task.<br> While yet a youth, from folly cease;<br> Through virtue seek for calm and peace.<br> So shalt thou here attain renown, <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a><br> And future bliss thy lot shall crown.<br>     Death interrupts the futile dreams<br> Of men who, plunged in various schemes,<br> Are thinking: "This or that is done;<br> This still to do; that just begun."<br> As torrents undermine the ranks<br> Of stately trees that crown their banks,<br> And sweep them downwards to the main,<br> Death tears from earth those dreamers vain.<br>     While some are all on traffic bent,<br> And some on household cares intent,<br> Are fighting hard with pressing need,<br> And struggling wives and babes to feed,<br> Or with some other ills of life<br> Are waging an incessant strife;<br>     Death these hard toiling men uproots,<br> Before they yet have reaped the fruits<br> Of all their labour, all their thought,<br> Of all the battles they have fought.<br>     Death spares no class, no rank, nor age;<br> He carries off the fool, the sage,<br> The knave, the saint, the young, the old,<br> The weak, the strong, the faint, the bold.<br>     As soon as men are born, decay<br> And death begin to haunt their way.<br> How can’st thou, thoughtless, careless, rest, <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a><br> When endless woes thy life infest;<br>     When pains and pangs thy strength consume—<br> Thy frame to dissolution doom?<br>     Forsake the busy haunts of men,<br> For there has death his favourite den.<br> In lonely forests seek thy home,<br> For there the gods delight to roam.<br>     Fast bound by old attachment's spell,<br> Men love amid their kin to dwell.<br> This bond the sage asunder tears;<br> The fool to rend it never cares.<br>     Thou dost advise that I should please<br> With sacrifice the deities.<br> Such rites I disregard as vain;<br> Through these can none perfection gain.<br> Why sate the gods, at cruel feasts,<br> With flesh and blood of slaughtered beasts?<br> Far other sacrifices I<br> Will offer unremittingly;<br> The sacrifice of calm, of truth,<br> The sacrifice of peace, of ruth,<br> Of life serenely, purely, spent,<br> Of thought profound on Brahma bent.<br> Who offers these, may death defy,<br> And hope for immortality.<br>     And then should say’st that I should wed, <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a><br> And sons should gain to tend me, dead,<br> By offering pious gifts, to seal,<br> When I am gone, my spirit's weal.<br> But I shall ask no pious zeal<br> Of sons to guard my future weal.<br> No child of mine shall ever boast<br> His rites have saved his father's ghost.<br> Of my own bliss I'll pay the price,<br> And be myself my sacrifice.<br>                From Mahabharata xii. 6526 ff. (– 9932 ff.); 8307 ff.</div>
