 <dir><small>"I interrupted him and asked: 'By Dharana you preserved long life, while other Yogis perished?'<br>
 "The long-lived one answered: 'No, they did not perish, but they got tired of the burden of the human body and gave it up at will.'

 <p>
 This is a translation of the Laghu Yoga Vashishta, traditionally written by
 the sage Vasistha, one of the teachers of Rama.
 This is the 'shorter' Yoga Vashishta.
 This is not an academic or critical translation, but it may appeal
 to the casual reader.
 The author of this book, Singh Gherwal, may have been a westerner
 with a Hindu pseudonym.
 He states that he is a teacher of Kundalini Yoga.
 Gherwal wrote a number of popularized books on this and related topics.
 </p>
 <p>
 Another public domain translation, that of K. Narayanaswami Aiyar [1896], is
 in preparation and will be posted at this site at a later date.

 <small>Production Notes: This was a self-published book, and it has
 a number of typographical errors which I corrected <a href="errata.htm">in the usual way</a>, including a couple of Hindu technical terms which I was
 able to track down using Wikipedia.
 There were also a number of punctuation errors, mostly quotation marks,
 which I corrected silently.--J.B. Hare, September 7, 2008.</small>
