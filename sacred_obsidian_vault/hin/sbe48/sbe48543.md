 <p>7. And on account of (Brahman) being specified.</p>
 <p>The text 'a person not human leads them to the worlds of Brahman' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI. 2, 15) by using the word 'world,' and moreover in the plural, determines the specification that the not-human person leads those only who meditate on Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, who dwells within some particular world.</p>

Up.VIII, 14) shows that he who goes on the path beginning with light aims at approaching Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha. But if this is so, there is a want of appropriate denotation in the clause, 'There is a person not human, he leads them to Brahman'; if Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha is meant, the text should say 'He leads them to Brahmâ (Brahmâ<i>n</i>am).'</p>
