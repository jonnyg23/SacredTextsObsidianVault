 <p>23. And on account of the very word, and of measure.</p>
 <p>Scripture directly applies the word 'a<i>n</i>u' to the individual Self, 'By thought is to be known that atomic Self into which Breath has entered fivefold' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 9).--By the term 'unmâna' in the Sûtra we have to understand measurement by selection of comparative instances.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Scripture declares the minuteness of the individual Self by reference to things which are like atoms in size, 'The individual soul is to be known as part of the hundredth part of the point of a hair divided a hundred times, and yet it is to be infinite' (<i>S</i>vet. Up. V, 9); 'that lower one is seen of the measure of the point of a goad' (V, 8). For these reasons also the individual Self must be viewed as atomic.--But this conflicts with the fact that sensation extends over the whole body!--This objection the next Sûtra refutes by means of an analogous instance.</p>
