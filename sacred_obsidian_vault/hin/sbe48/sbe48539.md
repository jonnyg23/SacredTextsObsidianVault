 <p>3. Beyond lightning there is Varu<i>n</i>a, on account of connexion.</p>
 <p>According to the text of the Kaushîtakins the soul goes on to the world of Vâyu, to the world of Varu<i>n</i>a, to the world of Indra, to the world of Pra<i>g</i>âpati, to the world of Brahman. The doubt here arises whether Varu<i>n</i>a and the divinities of the following stages are to be inserted in the series after Vâyu, in agreement with the order of enumeration in the text of the Kaushîtakins; or at the end of the whole series as stated in the <i>Kh</i>ândogya. Up. (IV, 15, 5), Varu<i>n</i>a thus coming after lightning.--The decision is in favour of the latter view because Varu<i>n</i>a, the god of waters, is naturally connected with lightning which dwells within the clouds.--This terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'Varu<i>n</i>a.'</p>
