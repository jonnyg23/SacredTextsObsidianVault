 <p>4. On account of direct scriptural statement.</p>
 <p>Scripture itself directly declares knowledge to be subordinate to works, 'whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that is more vigorous'. Nor can it be said that this text refers, on the ground of leading subject-matter (prakara<i>n</i>a), to the Udgîtha only; for direct scriptural statement (<i>s</i>uti) is stronger than subject-matter,</p>

 <p>and the words 'whatever he does with knowledge' clearly refer to knowledge in general.</p>
