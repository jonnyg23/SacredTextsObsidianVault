 <p>14. When there is a body, as in the waking state.</p>
 <p>When, on the other hand,the released soul possesses a body created by its own will, then it enjoys its various delights in the same way as a waking man does.--In the same way as the highest Person creates out of himself, for his own delight, the world of the Fathers and so on; so he sometimes creates such worlds for the enjoyment of the released souls. But sometimes, again, the souls using their own creative will-power themselves create their own worlds, which however are included within the sphere of sport of the highest Person (so that the souls in enjoying them do not pass beyond the intuition of Brahman).</p>
 <p>But it has been taught that the soul is of atomic size; how then can it connect itself with many bodies?--To this question the next Sûtra replies.</p>
