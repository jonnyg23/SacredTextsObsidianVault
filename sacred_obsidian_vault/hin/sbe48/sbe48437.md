 <p>53. But those (meditations) which are connected with members (of sacrifices) are not (restricted) to (particular) <i>s</i>âkhâs, but rather (belong) to all <i>s</i>âkhâs.</p>
 <p><a name="page_676"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 676</font></a></p>
 <p>There are certain meditations connected with certain constituent elements of sacrifices-as e.g. 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the Udgîtha '(<i>Kh.</i> Up. I, 1, 1); 'Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as the five worlds' (<i>Kh.</i> Up. II, 2, 1), &amp;c. The question here arises whether those meditations are restricted to the members of those <i>s</i>âkhâs in whose texts they are mentioned; or to be connected with the Udgîtha, and so on, in all <i>s</i>âkhâs. There is here a legitimate ground for doubt, in so far as, although the general agreement of all Vedânta-texts is established, the Udgîtha, and so on, are different in each Veda since the accents differ in the different Vedas--The Pûrvapakshin declares that those meditations are limited each to its particular <i>s</i>âkhâ; for, he says, the injunction 'Let him meditate on the Udgîtha' does indeed, verbally, refer to the Udgîtha in general; but as what stands nearest to this injunction is the special Udgîtha of the <i>s</i>âkhâ, in whose text this injunction occurs, and which shares the peculiarities of accent characteristic of that <i>s</i>âkhâ, we decide that the meditation is enjoined on members of that <i>s</i>âkhâ only.--The Sûtra sets this opinion aside. The injunction of meditations of this type is valid for all <i>s</i>âkhâs, since the text expressly connects them with the Udgîtha in general. They therefore hold good wherever there is an Udgîtha. The individual Udgîthas of the several <i>s</i>âkhâs are indeed distinguished by different accentuation; but the general statement, 'Let him meditate on the Udgîtha.' suggests to the mind not any particular Udgîtha, but <i>the</i> Udgîtha in general, and hence there is no reason to restrict the meditation to a particular <i>s</i>âkhâ. From the principle moreover that all <i>s</i>âkhâs teach the same doctrine, it follows that the sacrifice enjoined in the different <i>s</i>âkhâs is one only; and hence there is no reason to hold that the Udgîtha suggested by the injunction of the meditation is a particular one. For the Udgîtha is only an element in the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is one and the same. The meditations are not therefore limited to particular <i>s</i>âkhâs.</p>
