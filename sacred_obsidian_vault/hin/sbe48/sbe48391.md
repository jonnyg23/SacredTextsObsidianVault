 <p>7. Or not, on account of difference of subject-matter; as in the case of the attribute of being higher than the high, and so on.</p>
 <p>There is no unity of the two vidyâs, since the subject-matter of the two differs. For the tale in the <i>Kh</i>ândogya-text, which begins 'when the Devas and the Asuras struggled together,' connects itself with the pra<i>n</i>ava (the syllable Om) which is introduced as the object of meditation in <i>Kh</i>ánd. I, 1, 1, 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om as the Udgîtha'; and the clause forming part of the tale,'they meditated on that chief breath as Udgîtha.' therefore refers to a meditation on the pra<i>n</i>ava which is a part only of the Udgîtha. In the text of the Vâ<i>g</i>a-saneyins; on the other hand, there is nothing to correspond to the introductory passage which in the <i>Kh</i>ândogya-text determines the subject-matter, and the text clearly states that the meditation refers to the whole Udgîtha (not only the pra<i>n</i>ava). And this difference of leading subject-matter implies difference of matter enjoined, and this again difference of the character of meditation, and hence there is no unity of vidyâs. Thus the object of meditation for the <i>Kh</i>andogas is the pra<i>n</i>ava viewed under the form of Prâ<i>n</i>a; while for the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins it is the Udgâtri (who sings the Udgîtha), imaginatively identified with Prâ<i>n</i>a. Nor does there arise, on this latter account, a contradiction between the later and the earlier part of the story of the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins. For as a meditation on the Udgât<i>ri</i> necessarily</p>

 <p>extends to the Udgîtha, which is the object of the activity of singing, the latter also helps to bring about the result, viz. the mastering of enemies.--There is thus no unity of vidyâ, although there may be non-difference of injunction, and so on.--'As in the case of the attribute of being higher than the high,' &amp;c. In one and the same <i>s</i>âkhâ there are two meditations, in each of which the highest Self is enjoined to be viewed under the form of the pra<i>n</i>ava (<i>Kh</i>. Up. I, 6; I, 9), and in so far the two vidyâs are alike. But while the former text enjoins that the pra<i>n</i>ava has to be viewed under the form of a golden man, in the latter he has to be viewed as possessing the attributes of being higher than the high, and owing to this difference of attributes the two meditations must be held separate (<i>a fortiori</i>, then, those meditations are separate which have different objects of meditation).</p>
