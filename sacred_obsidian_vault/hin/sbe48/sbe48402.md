 <p>18. The new (thing is enjoined); on account of the statement of what has to be done.</p>
 <p>The Sûtra discusses an additional question connected with the meditation on breath. Both texts--the <i>Kh</i>ândogya as well as the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyaka-declare that water constitutes a dress for pra<i>n</i>a, and refer to the rinsing of the mouth</p>

 <p>with water. The doubt here arises whether what the texts mean to enjoin is the rinsing of the mouth, or a meditation on prâ<i>n</i>a as having water for its dress.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he says, the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyaka uses the injunctive form 'he is to rinse,' while there is no injunctive form referring to the meditation; and what the text says in praise of the breath thus not being allowed to remain naked may be taken as a mere glorification of the act of rinsing. And as ordinary rinsing of the mouth, subsequent to eating, is already established by Sm<i>ri</i>ti and custom, we must conclude that the text means to enjoin rinsing of the mouth of a different kind, viz. as auxiliary to the meditation on prâ<i>n</i>a.--To this the Sûtra replies that what the text enjoins is the new' thing, i.e. the previously non-established meditation on water as forming the dress of prâ<i>n</i>a. 'On account of the statement of what has to be done,' i.e. on account of the statement of what is not established--for only on the latter condition Scripture has a meaning. The beginning as well as the end of the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyaka-text clearly refers to a meditation on the water used for rinsing as forming a dress for prâ<i>n</i>a; and as rinsing is already established by Sm<i>ri</i>ti and custom, we naturally infer that what the text enjoins is a meditation on breath as having the water used in rinsing for its dress. This also explains why the <i>Kh</i>ândogya-text does not mention the rinsing at all, but merely the clothing of breath with water.--Here terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'the statement of what has to be done."</p>
