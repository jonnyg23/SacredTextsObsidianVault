 <p>9. And the subtle (body persists), on account of</p>
 <p><a name="page_733"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 733</font></a></p>
 <p>a means of knowledge, it being thus observed (in Scripture).</p>
 <p>The bondage of him who knows is not, at that stage, dissolved, for this reason also that the subtle body continues to persist.--How is this known?--Through a means of knowledge, viz. because it is thus seen in Scripture. For Scripture states that he who knows, when on the path of the gods, enters into a colloquy with the moon and others, 'he is to reply,' &amp;c. (Kau. Up. I, 3 ff.). This implies the existence of a body, and thence it follows that, at that stage, the subtle body persists. The state of bondage therefore is not yet dissolved.</p>
