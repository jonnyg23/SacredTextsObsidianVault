 <p>7. And the best.</p>
 <p>By 'the best' we have to understand the chief vital air (mukhya prâ<i>n</i>a), which, in the colloquy of the prâ<i>n</i>as, is determined to be the best because it is the cause of the preservation of the body. This chief vital air the Pûrvapakshin maintains to be something non-created, since Scripture (<i>Ri</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h.
