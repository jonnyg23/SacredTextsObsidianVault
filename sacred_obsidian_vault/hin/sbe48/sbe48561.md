 <p>10. The absence, Bâdari holds; for thus Scripture says.</p>
 <p>A doubt arises whether the Released has a body and sense-organs, or not; or whether he has them or not just as he pleases. The teacher Bâdari holds that body and sense-organs are absent; since the text declares this. The text--'as long as he is embodied there is no freedom from pleasure and pain; but when he is free from the body then neither pleasure nor pain touches him' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. VIII, 12, 1)--declares that pleasure and pain are necessarily connected with embodiedness; and the text--'having risen from this body and reached the highest light he manifests himself in his own shape' (VIII, 12, 3)--declares that the Released one is without a body.</p>
