 <p>3. Not that which is inferred, on account of the absence of terms denoting it, and (so also not) the bearer of the Prâ<i>n</i>as (i. e. the individual soul).</p>
 <p>As the section under discussion does not treat of the Pradhâna, there being no terms referring to that, so it is with regard to the individual soul also. In the text of the Sûtra we have to read either anumânam, i. e. 'inference,' in the sense of 'object of inference,' or else ânumânam, 'object of inference'; what is meant being in both cases the Pradhana inferred to exist by the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas.</p>
