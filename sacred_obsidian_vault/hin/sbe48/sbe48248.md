 <p>2. But there is.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> And in a matter known from Scripture a contradictory inference, such as that Ether cannot originate because it is without parts, is not of sufficient force. That the non-originatedness of the Self also does not rest on its being without parts will be shown further on.--Here the Pûrvapakshin raises an objection.</p>
