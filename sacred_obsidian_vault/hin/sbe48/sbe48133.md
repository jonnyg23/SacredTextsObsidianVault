 <p>35. On account of the inferential sign further on, together with <i>K</i>aitraratha.</p>
 <p>The kshattriya-hood of <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti is further to be accepted on account of the Kshattriya Abhipratârin <i>K</i>aitraratha, who is mentioned further on in this very same Sa<i>m</i>vargavidyâ which Raikva imparts to <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti.--But why?--As follows. The section beginning 'Once a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin</p>
 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a></p>
 <p>begged of Saunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni while being waited on at their meal,' and ending 'thus do we, O Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, meditate on that being,' shows Kâpeya, Abhipratârin, and the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin to be connected with the Sa<i>m</i>varga-vidyâ. Now Abhipratârin is a Kshattriya, the other two are Brâhma<i>n</i>as. This shows that there are connected with the vidyâ, Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and from among non-Brâhma<i>n</i>as, a Kshattriya only, but not a <i>S</i>ûdra. It therefore appears appropriate to infer that the person, other than the Brâhma<i>n</i>a Raikva, who is likewise connected with this vidyâ, viz. <i>G</i>ânasruti, is likewise a Kshattriya, not a <i>S</i>ûdra.--But how do we know that Abhipratârin is a <i>K</i>aitraratha and a Kshattriya? Neither of these circumstances is stated in the legend in the Sa<i>m</i>varga-vidyâ! To this question the Sûtra replies, 'on account of the inferential mark.' From the inferential mark that <i>S</i>aunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni are said to have been sitting together at a meal we understand that there is some connexion between Abhipratârin and the Kâpeyas. Now another scriptural passage runs as follows: 'The Kâpeyas made <i>K</i>aitraratha perform that sacrifice' (Tâ<i>nd</i> Brâ. XX, 12, 5), and this shows that one connected with the Kâpeyas was a <i>K</i>aitraratha; and a further text shows that a <i>K</i>aitraratha is a Kshattriya. 'from him there was descended a <i>K</i>aitraratha who was a prince.' All this favours the inference that Abhipratârin was a <i>K</i>aitraratha and a Kshattriya.</p>
 <p>So far the Sûtras have shown that there is no inferential mark to prove what is contradicted by reasoning, viz. the qualification of the <i>S</i>ûdras. The next Sûtra declares that the non-qualification of the <i>S</i>ûdra proved by reasoning is confirmed by Scripture and Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>
