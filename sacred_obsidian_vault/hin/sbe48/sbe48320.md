 <p>3. And on account of the going of the prâ<i>n</i>as.</p>
 <p>That the soul goes embedded in the subtle rudiments of the elements follows therefrom also that when passing out of the old body it is said to be followed by the prâ<i>n</i>as, 'when he thus passes out, the chief prâ<i>n</i>a follows after him,' &amp;c. (B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 4, 2). Compare also Sm<i>ri</i>ti: 'It draws to itself the organs of sense, with the mind for the sixth. When the Ruler (soul) obtains a new body, and passes out of another, he takes with him those organs and then moves on, as the wind takes the odours from their abodes (the flowers)' (Bha. Gî. XV, 8). But the prâ<i>n</i>as cannot move without a substrate, and hence we must admit that the rudiments of the elements--which are their substrate--are also moving.</p>
