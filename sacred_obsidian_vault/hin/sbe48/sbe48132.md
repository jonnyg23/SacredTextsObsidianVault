 <p>34. And on account of (<i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti ) kshattriya-hood being understood.</p>
 <p>The first section of the vidyâ tells us that <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti bestowed much wealth and food; later on he is represented as sending his door-keeper on an errand; and in the end, as bestowing on Raikva many villages--which shows him to be a territorial lord. All these circumstances suggest <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti's being a Kshattriya, and hence not a member of the lowest caste.--The above Sûtra having declared that the kshattriya-hood of <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti is indicated in the introductory legend, the next Sûtra shows that the same circumstance is indicated in the concluding legend.</p>
