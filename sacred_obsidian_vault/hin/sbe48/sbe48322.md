 <p>5. Should it be said, on account of absence of mention in the first (reply); we say no, for just that (is meant), on the ground of fitness.</p>
 <p>An objection is raised to the conclusion arrived at under III, 1, 1; on the ground that in the first oblation, described in <i>Kh</i>. Up. V, 4, 2, as being made into the heavenly world, water is not mentioned at all as the thing offered. The text says, 'on that altar the gods offer <i>s</i>raddhâ'; and by <i>s</i>raddhâ (belief) everybody understands a certain activity of mind. Water therefore is not the thing offered.--Not so, we reply. It is nothing else but water, which there is called <i>s</i>raddhâ. For thus only question and answer have a sense. For the question is, 'Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called man?' and at the outset of the reply <i>s</i>raddhâ is mentioned as constituting the oblation made into the heavenly world viewed as a fire. If here the word <i>s</i>raddhâ did not denote water, question and answer would refer to different topics, and there would be no connexion. The form in which the final statement is introduced (iti tu pa<i>ñk</i>amyâm, &amp;c., 'but thus in the fifth oblation,' &amp;c.), moreover, also intimates that <i>s</i>raddhâ means water. The word 'iti,' <i>thus</i>, here intimates that the answer is meant to dispose of the question, 'Do you know <i>how</i>?' &amp;c. <i>S</i>raddhâ becomes moon, rain, food, seed, embryo in succession, and <i>thus</i> the water comes to be called man. Moreover, the word <i>s</i>raddhâ is actually used in the Veda in the sense of 'water'; 'he carries water, <i>s</i>raddhâ indeed is water' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 6, 8, 1). Aad what the text says as</p>
 <p><a name="page_588"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 588</font></a></p>
 <p>to king Soma (the moon) originating from <i>s</i>raddhâ when offered, also shows that <i>s</i>raddhâ must mean water.</p>
