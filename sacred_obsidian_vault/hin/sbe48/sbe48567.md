 <p>16. It refers either to dreamless sleep or to union (sampatti); for this is manifested.</p>
 <p>Texts as the one last quoted do not refer to the released soul, but either to deep sleep or to 'union' (sampatti), i.e. the time of dying; the latter in accordance with the text 'then his speech is united (sampadyate) with his mind,--heat with the highest divinity' (<i>Kh</i>.

From all this it follows that the text as to the soul being held in embrace by the prâ<i>gñ</i>a Self refers either to deep sleep or death.--Here terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'non-being.'</p>
