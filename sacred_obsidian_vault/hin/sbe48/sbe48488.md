 <p>Those expiatory performances which are described in the chapter treating of qualification (Pû. Mî. Sû. VI) are not possible in the case of him who has lapsed from the condition of a Naish<i>th</i>ika; since such expiations do not apply to him, as is shown by a Sm<i>ri</i>ti text referring to such lapse, viz. 'He who having once entered on the duties of a Naish<i>th</i>ika lapses from them, for such a slayer of the Self I do not see any expiatory work by which he might become clean.' The expiatory ceremony referred to in the Pûrva Mimâ<i>m</i>sâ therefore applies to the case of other Brahma<i>k</i>ârins only.</p>
