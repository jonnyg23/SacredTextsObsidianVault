 <p>33. Moreover, they record him in that.</p>
 <p>They (i.e. the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins) speak of him, viz. Vai<i>s</i>vânara who has heaven for his head, &amp;c.--i.e. the highest Self--as within that, i.e. the body of the devotee, so as to form the abode of the oblation to Prâ<i>n</i>a; viz. in the text,'Of that Vai<i>s</i>vânara Self the head is Sute<i>g</i>as,' and so on. The context is as follows. The clause 'He who meditates on the Vai<i>s</i>vânara Self as prâde<i>s</i>amâtra,' &amp;c. enjoins meditation on the highest Self having the three worlds for its body, i.e. on Vai<i>s</i>vânara. The following clause 'he eats food in all worlds' teaches that the attaining of Brahman is the reward of such meditation. And then the text proceeds to teach the Agnihotra offered to Prâ<i>n</i>a, which is something subsidiary to the meditation taught.

'The head is Sute<i>g</i>as'--that means: the head of the devotee is (identical with) heaven, which is the head of the highest Self; and so on up to 'the feet,' i.e. the feet of the devotee are identical with the earth, which constitutes the feet of the highest Self, The devotee having thus reflected on the highest Self, which has the three worlds for its body, as present within his own body, thereupon is told to view his own chest, hair, heart, mind and mouth as identical with the altar, grass and the other things which are required for the Agnihotra; further to identify the oblation to Prâ<i>n</i>a with the Agnihotra, and by means of this Prâ<i>n</i>a-agnihotra to win the favour of Vai<i>s</i>vânara, i.e. the highest Self. The final--conclusion then remains that Vai<i>s</i>vânara is none other than the highest Self, the supreme Person.--Here terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'Vai<i>s</i>vânara.'</p>
