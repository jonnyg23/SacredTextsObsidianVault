 <p>6. And (they are) minute.</p>
 <p>As the text 'these are all alike, all infinite' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. I, 5, 13), declares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the prâ<i>n</i>as are all-pervading.--To this the Sûtra replies, that they are minute; for the text 'when the vital breath passes out of the body, all the prâ<i>n</i>as pass out after it' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those prâ<i>n</i>as to be of limited size, and as when passing out they are not perceived by bystanders, they must be of minute size--The text which speaks of them as infinite is a text enjoining meditation ('he who meditates on them as infinite'), and infinity there means only that abundance of activities which is an attribute of the prâ<i>n</i>a to be meditated on.</p>
