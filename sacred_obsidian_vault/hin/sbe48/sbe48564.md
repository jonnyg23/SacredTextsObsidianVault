 <p>13. In the absence of a body, as in the state of dream; that being possible.</p>
 <p>As in the absence of a body and other instruments of enjoyment created by himself, the Released may undergo experiences of pleasure by means of instruments created by the highest Person, the Released, although capable of realising all his wishes, may not himself be creative. As in the state of dream the individual soul has experiences depending on chariots and other implements created by the Lord ('He creates chariots, horses,' &amp;c., B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 3, 10); thus the released soul also may have experience of different worlds created by the Lord engaged in playful sport.</p>
