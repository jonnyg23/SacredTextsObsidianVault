 <p>17. According to some (a class of good works) other than these, of both kinds.</p>
 <p>The text quoted above from one <i>s</i>âkhâ ('His friends enter upon his good deeds') refers to good works other than the Agnihotra and the rest, the only object of which is to give rise to knowledge, viz. to all those manifold good works, previous or subsequent to the attaining to knowledge, the results of which are obstructed by other works of greater strength. Those texts also which declare works not to cling or to be destroyed through knowledge refer to this same class of works.--The next Sûtra recalls the fact, already previously established, that the results of works actually performed may somehow be obstructed.</p>
