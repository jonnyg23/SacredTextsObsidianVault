 <p>8. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose.</p>
 <p>Even if it were admitted that the Pradhâna is established by Inference, the Sâ<u>n</u>khya theory could not be accepted for the reason that the Pradhâna is without a purpose. For, according to the view expressed in the passage, 'In order that the soul may know the Pradhâna and become isolated' (Sâ<u>n</u>khya Kâ. I, 21), the purpose of the Pradhâna is fruition and final release on the part of the soul; but both these are impossible. For, as the soul consists of pure intelligence, is inactive, changeless, and spotless, and hence eternally emancipated, it is capable neither of fruition which consists in consciousness of Prak<i>ri</i>ti, nor of Release which consists in separation from Prak<i>ri</i>ti. If, on the other hand, it be held that the soul constituted as described is, owing to the mere nearness of Prak<i>ri</i>ti, capable of fruition, i.e. of being conscious of pleasure and pain, which are special modifications of Prak<i>ri</i>ti, it follows that, as Prak<i>ri</i>ti is ever near, the soul will never accomplish emancipation.</p>
