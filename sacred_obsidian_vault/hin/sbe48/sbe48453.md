 <p>6. On account of injunction for such a one.</p>
 <p>That knowledge is subordinate to works follows therefrom also that works are enjoined on him only who possesses knowledge. For texts such as 'He who has learnt the Veda from a family of teachers,' &amp;c. (<i>Kh</i>. Up. VIII, 15), enjoin works on him only who has mastered the sacred texts so as fully to understand their meaning--for this is the sense of the term 'learning' (adhyayana). Hence the knowledge of Brahman also is enjoined ith a view to works only: it has no independent result of its own.</p>
