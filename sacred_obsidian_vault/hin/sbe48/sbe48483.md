 <p>36. Also in the case of those outside, as this is seen.</p>
 <p><a name="page_704"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 704</font></a></p>
 <p>It has been declared that the members of the four â<i>s</i>ramas have a claim to the knowledge of Brahman, and that the duties connected with each â<i>s</i>rarna promote knowledge. A doubt now arises whether those men also who, on account of poverty and so on, stand outside the â<i>s</i>ramas are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman, or rtot.--They are not, the Pûrvapakshin holds, since such knowledge is to be attained in a way dependent on the special duties of each â<i>s</i>rama; while those who do not belong to an â<i>s</i>rama are not concerned with â<i>s</i>rama duties.--This view the Sûtra rejects. Those also who do not stand within any â<i>s</i>rama are qualified for knowledge, 'because that is seen,' i.e. because the texts declare that men such as Raikva, Bhîshma, Sa<i>m</i>varta and others who did not belong to â<i>s</i>rama were well grounded in the knowledge of Brahman. It can by no means be maintained that it is â<i>s</i>rama duties only that promote knowledge; for the text 'by gifts, by penance, by fasting, and so on' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 22) distinctly declares that charity also and other practices, which are not confined to the â<i>s</i>ramas, are helpful towards knowledge. In the same way as in the case of those bound to chastity--who, as the texts show, may possess the knowledge of Brahman--knowledge is promoted by practices other than the Agnihotra and the like, so--it is concluded--in the case of those also who do not belong to any abrama knowledge may be promoted by certain practices not exclusively connected with any â<i>s</i>rama, such as prayer, fasting, charity, propitiation of the divinity, and so on.</p>
