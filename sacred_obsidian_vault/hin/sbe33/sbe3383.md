 <p>7. <a name="fr_1226"></a><a href="#fn_1225"><font size="1">7</font></a> Partition among coparceners is declared to be of two kinds; one is with attention to priority of birth, the other consists of the allotment of equal shares.</p>  
 <p>8. <a name="fr_1227"></a><a href="#fn_1226"><font size="1">8</font></a> All sons of the twice-born, begotten on women equal in caste (to their husbands), shall take equal shares, after giving a preferential share to the eldest.</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_1228"></a><a href="#fn_1227"><font size="1">9</font></a> He who is the first by birth, sacred knowledge, or good qualities, shall take a couple of shares out of the partible wealth, and the rest shall take equal shares; but he stands to them in the relation of a father, as it were.</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_1229"></a><a href="#fn_1228"><font size="1">10</font></a> When they divide their father's heritage, all the sons shall share alike; but he who is distinguished by sacred knowledge and virtue, shall obtain a greater share (than the rest).</p>

 <p>ability, as well as in property acquired by sacred knowledge, valour in arms, &amp;c., the father's ownership has been declared.</p>  
 <p>13. He may make a gift out of that property, or even consume it, at his will. But in his default, his sons are pronounced to be equal sharers.</p>  
 <p>14. <a name="fr_1232"></a><a href="#fn_1231"><font size="1">14</font></a> Whatever has been acquired by all together, in that property they all have equal shares. Their sons, whether unequal or equal (in number), are declared (to be) heirs of the shares of their (respective) fathers.</p>  
 <p>15. <a name="fr_1233"></a><a href="#fn_1232"><font size="1">15</font></a> When there are many sons sprung from one father, equal in caste and number, but born of different mothers, a legal division (of the property) may be effected by adjusting the shares according to the mothers.</p>

 <p>effort, by a father who has come to a partition with his sons, all that belongs to the son born after partition. Those born before it are declared to have no right.</p>

 <p>21. <a name="fr_1239"></a><a href="#fn_1238"><font size="1">21</font></a> Should there be younger brothers, whose initiation has not been performed, they must be initiated by the other brothers (the expense being defrayed) out of the family property (inherited) from the father.</p>

 <p>23. Whether it be a debt, or a document, or house, or field, which has been inherited from the paternal grandfather, he shall take his proper share of it, when he returns after a protracted absence even.</p>  
 <p>24. <a name="fr_1241"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">24</font></a> When a man has gone abroad, leaving the joint estate of his family, his share must undoubtedly be given to his descendant who has returned from abroad.</p>

 <p>28. <a name="fr_1244"></a><a href="#fn_1243"><font size="1">28</font></a> Let those begotten by a Kshatriya (take) three shares, two shares, and one share (respectively). Let those begotten by a Vai<i>s</i>ya take two shares and one share.</p>  
 <p>29. <a name="fr_1245"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">29</font></a> The son by a Kshatriya wife, if elder by birth and endowed with superior qualities, shall take an equal share with the Brahman (son); and so shall a son by a Vai<i>s</i>ya wife (share equally) with a Kshatriya son.</p>  
 <p>30. <a name="fr_1246"></a><a href="#fn_1245"><font size="1">30</font></a> Land obtained by acceptance of a gift must never be given to the son of a Kshatriya woman or other (wife inferior in caste to her husband). Though their father may have given it to them, the son by a Brahman wife shall take it after the death (of the father).</p>  
 <p>31. <a name="fr_1247"></a><a href="#fn_1246"><font size="1">31</font></a> An obedient and excellent son of a man having no other male issue, shall receive a maintenance (though he be born) of a <i>S</i>ûdra woman; let the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as take the remainder.</p>

 <p>32. <a name="fr_1248"></a><a href="#fn_1247"><font size="1">32</font></a> A son begotten with a <i>S</i>ûdra woman by a twice-born man is not entitled to a share of the landed property; one begotten with a woman of equal caste shall take all. Thus has the law been settled.</p>  
 <p>33. <a name="fr_1249"></a><a href="#fn_1248"><font size="1">33</font></a> Of the thirteen sons mentioned in succession by Manu, the legitimate son of the body (Aurasa) and the appointed daughter (Putrikâ) continue the family.</p>  
 <p>34. As in default of ghee, oil is admitted by the virtuous as a substitute (at sacrifices), so are the eleven sons (admitted as substitutes), in default of a legitimate son of the body and of an appointed daughter.</p>  
 <p>35. <a name="fr_1250"></a><a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">35</font></a> No one but a legitimate son of the body is declared to be heir of his father's wealth. An appointed daughter is said to be equal to him. All the others are stated to have a claim to maintenance (only).</p>  
 <p>36. <a name="fr_1251"></a><a href="#fn_1250"><font size="1">36</font></a> Because a son (Putra) saves his father from the hell called Put by the very sight of his face, therefore should a man be anxious to beget a son.</p>  
 <p>37. <a name="fr_1252"></a><a href="#fn_1251"><font size="1">37</font></a> Both a son's son and the son of an appointed daughter cause a man to attain heaven. Both are pronounced to be equal as regards their right of inheritance and the duty of offering funeral balls of meal (Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as).</p>

 <p>38. <a name="fr_1253"></a><a href="#fn_1252"><font size="1">38</font></a> Gautama has declared that a daughter is appointed after performing a sacrifice to Agni and Pra<i>g</i>âpati; others have said that she is an appointed daughter (Putrikâ) who was merely supposed to be one (before her birth) by a man having no male issue.</p>  
 <p>39. <a name="fr_1254"></a><a href="#fn_1253"><font size="1">39</font></a> The other sons, beginning with the son begotten on a wife (Kshetra<i>g</i>a), shall (respectively) take a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh part.</p>  
 <p>40. <a name="fr_1255"></a><a href="#fn_1254"><font size="1">40</font></a> The son given, the son cast off, the son bought, the son made (or adopted), the son by a <i>S</i>ûdra wife: these, when pure by caste and irreproachable as to their conduct, are considered sons of middle rank.</p>  
 <p>41. The son begotten on a wife (Kshetra<i>g</i>a) is despised by the virtuous; and so are the son begotten on a woman twice married, the son of an unmarried damsel, the son received with the wife, and the son secretly born.</p>  
 <p>42. <a name="fr_1256"></a><a href="#fn_1255"><font size="1">42</font></a> Though born of a wife of the same caste, a son destitute of good qualities is unworthy to obtain the paternal wealth; it shall go to those learned (kinsmen) who offer the funeral ball of meal (Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a) for the father.</p>  
 <p>43. A son redeems his father from the highest</p>

 <p>and lowest debts; consequently there is no use of him who acts otherwise.</p>  
 <p>44. What can be done with a cow which neither gives milk nor is (ever) pregnant? What is the good of a son being born who is neither learned nor virtuous?</p>  
 <p>45. A son who is destitute of learning, valour, and wealth, void of devotion and insight, and unobservant of good custom, such a son is declared to be no better than urine and fæces.</p>  
 <p>46. <a name="fr_1257"></a><a href="#fn_1256"><font size="1">46</font></a> In the revealed texts (of the Veda), in the traditional law (of the Sm<i>ri</i>tis), and in popular usage, the wife is declared to be half the body (of her husband), equally sharing the outcome of good and evil acts.</p>  
 <p>47. <a name="fr_1258"></a><a href="#fn_1257"><font size="1">47</font></a> Of him whose wife is not dead, half his body survives. How should any one else take the property, while half (his) body lives?</p>  
 <p>48. <a name="fr_1259"></a><a href="#fn_1258"><font size="1">48</font></a> Although kinsmen (Sakulyas), although his father and mother, although uterine brothers be living, the wife of him who dies without leaving male issue shall succeed to his share.</p>  
 <p>49. A wife deceased before (her husband) takes away his consecrated fire (Agnihotra); but if the husband dies before the wife, she takes his property, if she has been faithful to him. This is an eternal law.</p>  
 <p>50. After having received all the movable and immovable property, the gold, base metals and grain, liquids and wearing apparel, she shall cause</p>

 <p>his monthly, sixmonthly, and annual <i>S</i>râddhas to be performed.</p>  
 <p>51. Let her propitiate with funeral oblations and pious liberality her husband's paternal uncles, Gurus, daughter's sons, sister's sons, and maternal uncles; also aged or helpless persons, guests, and women (belonging to the family).</p>  
 <p>52. Should agnates (Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as) or cognates (Bândhavas) or enemies injure the property, let the king inflict on them the punishment destined for a thief.</p>  
 <p>53. <a name="fr_1260"></a><a href="#fn_1259"><font size="1">53</font></a> The husband being separated (in interests from his former coparceners), his wife shall take after his death a pledge and whatever else is recognised as property, excepting the immovable wealth.</p>  
 <p>54. A wife, though preserving her character and though partition have been made, is unworthy to obtain immovable property. Food or a portion of the arable land shall be given to her at will (for her support).</p>  
 <p>55. <a name="fr_1261"></a><a href="#fn_1260"><font size="1">55</font></a> The wife is declared to succeed to her husband's property, and in her default, the daughter.</p>  
 <p>56. <a name="fr_1262"></a><a href="#fn_1261"><font size="1">56</font></a> A daughter, like a son, springs from each member of a man; how then should any other mortal inherit the father's property while she lives?</p>  
 <p>57. Equal in caste (to her father) and married to a man of the same caste as her own, virtuous, habitually submissive, she shall inherit her father's property, whether she may have been (expressly) appointed or not.</p>

 <p><a name="page_379"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 379</font></a></p>  
 <p>58. As her father's wealth becomes her property, though kinsmen be in existence, even so her son becomes the owner of his mother's and maternal grandfather's wealth.</p>  
 <p>59. <a name="fr_1263"></a><a href="#fn_1262"><font size="1">59</font></a> In default of them, uterine brothers or brother's sons, agnates (Sakulyas) and cognates (Bândhavas), pupils, or learned Brahmans are entitled to the inheritance.</p>  
 <p>60. <a name="fr_1264"></a><a href="#fn_1263"><font size="1">60</font></a> When a man dies leaving no issue, nor wife, nor brother, nor father, nor mother, all his Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as shall divide his property in due shares.</p>  
 <p>61. <a name="fr_1265"></a><a href="#fn_1264"><font size="1">61</font></a> Half the entire wealth, however, shall first be set apart for the benefit of the deceased (owner) and carefully assigned for his monthly, sixmonthly, and annual <i>S</i>râddhas.</p>  
 <p>62. <a name="fr_1266"></a><a href="#fn_1265"><font size="1">62</font></a> When there are several relatives, agnates (Sakulyas), and cognates (Bândhavas), whosoever of them is the nearest shall take the wealth of him who died leaving no issue.</p>  
 <p>63. <a name="fr_1267"></a><a href="#fn_1266"><font size="1">63</font></a> When a man dies without leaving either wife or male issue, the mother has to be considered as her son's heiress, or a brother (may succeed) if she consents to it.</p>  
 <p>64. <a name="fr_1268"></a><a href="#fn_1267"><font size="1">64</font></a> But on his death the mother shall take a son's share. The mothers shall share equally with the sons, the maidens shall take fourth-part shares.</p>

 <p>65, 66. <a name="fr_1269"></a><a href="#fn_1268"><font size="1">65</font></a> To a father the funeral ball (Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a) and water oblation shall be offered by his son; in default of a son, the widow (succeeds); in her default, a uterine brother; in default of him, the co-heirs (dâyâdâ<i>h</i>); afterwards, the property goes to the daughter's son.</p>  
 <p>67. <a name="fr_1270"></a><a href="#fn_1269"><font size="1">67</font></a> Should a Kshatriya, Vai<i>s</i>ya, or <i>S</i>ûdra die without leaving male issue, or wife, or brother, their property shall be taken (as escheat) by the king, for he is the lord of all.</p>  
 <p>68. <a name="fr_1271"></a><a href="#fn_1270"><font size="1">68</font></a> Except in the case of a Brahman; but a king bent on the practice of virtue must allot a maintenance to his women. Thus has the law of inheritance been declared.</p>  
 <p>69. For her food (he must assign) a Prastha of rice every afternoon, together with fuel, and one dress purchased for three Pa<i>n</i>as must be given to her every three months.</p>

 <p>for the expense of her dress, food, and for the washerman, shall be made over to the co-heirs.</p>  
 <p>71. (The widow) shall recite the Dhûmâvasânika prayer in the evening, bathe frequently, and pay no regard to dwelling, food, or clothing after her husband's death.</p>  
 <p>72. <a name="fr_1272"></a><a href="#fn_1271"><font size="1">72</font></a> He who (having been divided) is again living, through affection, together with his father or brother, or with his uncle even, is said to be reunited with them.</p>  
 <p>73. <a name="fr_1273"></a><a href="#fn_1272"><font size="1">73</font></a> When brothers formerly divided are again living together through affection and arrange a second division, the right of primogeniture does not accrue in that case.</p>  
 <p>74. When any one (brother) should die or anyhow renounce worldly interests, his share is not lost; it is allotted to his uterine brother.</p>  
 <p>75. If there be a sister, she is entitled to a share of his property. This is the law regarding (the wealth of) one destitute of issue, and who has no wife or father.</p>  
 <p>76. <a name="fr_1274"></a><a href="#fn_1273"><font size="1">76</font></a> When two (coparceners) have again established together, they shall mutually inherit their property.</p>  
 <p>77. <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1274"><font size="1">77</font></a> If among reunited coparceners any one should acquire property through learning, valour, or other (independent effort of his own), a double share must be given to him; the rest shall take equal shares.</p>

 <p>grandfather, the father, or the mother, (all that) shall not be taken from him (who possesses it); (he may keep), likewise, property acquired by valour and the wealth of his wife.</p>  
 <p>79. <a name="fr_1277"></a><a href="#fn_1276"><font size="1">79</font></a> Those by whom clothes and the like articles have been declared indivisible have not decided properly. The wealth of the rich depends on clothes and ornaments.</p>  
 <p>80. <a name="fr_1278"></a><a href="#fn_1277"><font size="1">80</font></a> (Such wealth) when withheld from partition will yield no profit; but neither can it be allotted to a single (coparcener). Therefore it has to be divided with some skill; or else it would be useless.</p>  
 <p>81. Clothes and ornaments are divided by (distributing the proceeds after) selling them; a written bond (concerning a debt, is divided) after recovering the sum lent; prepared food (is divided) by an exchange for (an equal amount of) unprepared food.</p>  
 <p>82. The water of a well or pool shall be drawn and used according to need. A single female (slave) shall be (successively) set to work at their houses (by the several sharers) according to their shares (of the inheritance).</p>  
 <p>83. If there are many of them, they shall be divided equally. The same rule applies to male slaves as well. Property obtained for a pious purpose shall be divided in equal shares.</p>  
 <p>84. Fields and embankments shall be divided according to their several shares. A common (road or) pasture-ground shall be always used by the coheirs in due proportion to their several shares.</p>

Vâ<i>k</i>aspatimi<i>s</i>ra, Kamalâkara, Nandapa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita, and other commentators explain the term mâtara<i>h</i>, 'mothers,' as denoting step-mothers who have no issue, whereas in the first clause the term 'mother' (<i>g</i>ananî), according to them, denotes a woman who has male issue. It seems more natural, however, to interpret the term 'mother' in the same way in both clauses. Vish<i>n</i>u (XVIII, 34, 35) has the analogous precept that mothers and maiden daughters shall receive shares corresponding to the shares of sons. Vish<i>n</i>u's rule relates to a division of property among sons differing in caste, and the present text of B<i>ri</i>haspati seems to apply to the same case.</p>
