 <p>is instituted by the sons, it is called by the learned, Partition of Property, a title of law.</p>  
 <p>* 2. <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">2</font></a> The father being dead, the sons shall divide the estate as they ought; (and so shall) daughters (divide the property) of their mother (when she dies); or, failing daughters, their issue.</p>  
 <p>* 3. <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">3</font></a> (The distribution of the property shall take place) when the mother has ceased to menstruate and the sisters are married, or when the father's sexual desire is extinguished and he has ceased to care for worldly interests.</p>  
 <p>* 4. <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">4</font></a> Or let a father distribute his property among his sons himself, when he is stricken in years, either allotting a larger share to the eldest son, or (distributing the property in any other way) following his own inclination.</p>

 <p>* 6. <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">6</font></a> Property gained by valour, or belonging to a wife, and the gains of science, are three kinds of wealth not subject to partition; and so is a favour conferred by the father (exempt from partition).</p>  
 <p>* 7. When the mother has bestowed (a portion of) her property on any (of her sons) from affection, the rule is the same in that case also; for the mother is equal to the father (as regards her competence to bestow gifts).</p>  
 <p>* 8. <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">8</font></a> What (was given) before the (nuptial) fire, what (was given) during the bridal procession, the husband's donation, and what was received from her brother, mother, or father, that is called the sixfold property of a woman (Strîdhana).</p>

 <p>* 9. <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">9</font></a> Such property of a woman shall go to her offspring; if she have no offspring, it is declared to go to her husband (if she was married to him) according to one of the four (praiseworthy) marriage forms, beginning with the Brâhma form; (if she was married) according to one of the other forms, it shall go to her parents.</p>  
 <p>* 10. <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">10</font></a> When one brother maintains the family of another brother, who is engaged in studying science, he shall receive a share of the wealth gained by that study, though he be ignorant (himself).</p>  
 <p>* 11. <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">11</font></a> A learned man is not bound to give a share of his own (acquired) wealth against his will to an unlearned co-heir, unless it have been gained by him using the paternal estate.</p>

 <p>when distributing his property. The mother shall receive the same share as a son (when the sons divide the property) after her husband's death.</p>  
 <p>* 13. <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">13</font></a> To the eldest son a larger share shall be allotted, and a less share is assigned to the youngest son. The rest shall take equal shares, and so shall an unmarried sister.</p>  
 <p>* 14. <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">14</font></a> The same rule applies to sons of a wife (Kshetra<i>g</i>as) lawfully begotten on her. For sons of lower caste, a decrease in the shares according to the order (of their caste) is ordained, in case they are born of women legally married.</p>  
 <p>* 15. <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">15</font></a> When a father has distributed his property amongst his sons, that is a lawful distribution for them (and cannot be annulled), whether the share of one be less, or greater than, or equal to the shares of the rest; for the father is the lord of all.</p>

 <p>* 18. A maiden's son, whose father is unknown and whose mother is not legally married (to his father), shall give a funeral ball (of rice) to his maternal grandfather and inherit his property.</p>  
 <p>* 19. <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">19</font></a> Those sons who have been begotten by one or by many on a woman not authorized (to raise issue to her deceased husband), shall all be disinherited;</p>

 <p>* 25. <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">25</font></a> If among several brothers one childless should die or become a religious ascetic, the others shall divide his property, excepting the Strîdhana.</p>

 <p>to ruin, though born in a noble family. Therefore the Lord of creatures has assigned a dependent condition to them.</p>  
 <p>* 31. The father protects her during her infancy, the husband protects her when she is grown up, and the sons (protect her) in her old age. A woman is unfit to enjoy independence.</p>  
 <p>* 32. <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">32</font></a> What is left (of the father's property), when the father's obligations have been discharged, and when the father's debts have been paid, shall be divided by the brothers, in order that the father may not continue a debtor.</p>  
 <p>* 33. <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">33</font></a> For those (brothers), for whom the initiatory ceremonies have not been duly performed by their father, they must be performed by the (other) brothers, (defraying the expense) from the paternal property.</p>

 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p>* 34. Or, no paternal wealth being left, the initiatory ceremonies must be invariably performed for their brothers by those previously initiated contributing (the required) funds from their own portions.</p>  
 <p>* 35. <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">35</font></a> One who, being authorized to look after the affairs of the family, charges himself with the management (of the family property), shall be supported by his brothers with (presents of) food, clothing, and vehicles.</p>  
 <p>* 36. <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">36</font></a> When the fact of a legal partition should be called into question, the decision of the dispute (which has arisen) among the sharers shall be founded on (the testimony of) kinsmen, the written deed recording the division of the estate, and the separate transaction of business.</p>  
 <p>* 37. <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">37</font></a> Among unseparated brothers, the performance of religious duties is single. When they have come to a partition, they have to perform their religious duties each for himself.</p>

 <p>* 38. <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">38</font></a> Giving, receiving, cattle, food, houses, fields, and servants must be regarded as separate among divided brothers, and so must cooking, religious duties, income, and expenditure (be kept separate for each of them).</p>  
 <p>* 39. <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">39</font></a> (The acts of) giving evidence, of becoming a surety, of giving, and of taking, may be mutually performed by divided brothers, but not by unseparated ones.</p>  
 <p>* 40. If (brothers or others) should transact such matters as these publicly with their co-heirs, they may be presumed to be separate in affairs, even though no written record (of the partition) be in existence.</p>  
 <p>* 41. <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">41</font></a> Those brothers who for ten years continue to live separate in point of religious duties and business transactions, should be regarded as separate; that is a settled rule.</p>  
 <p>* 42. <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">42</font></a> When a number of persons, the descendants of one man, are separate in point of (the performance of) religious duties, business transactions, and working</p>

 <p>* 43. They are quite at liberty to perform, according to pleasure, all (such transactions as) the gift or sale of their own shares. They are (in fact) masters of their own wealth.</p>  
 <p>* 44. <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">44</font></a> One born after partition shall receive his father's property exclusively. Or, if other sharers have reunited with the father, they shall come to a division (with the son born after partition). Such is the law.</p>

 <p>* 46. The son of a remarried woman, the son cast off, the adopted son, the son bought, the son made, and the son who has offered himself, are declared to be the twelve sons.</p>  
 <p>* 47. Among these, six are kinsmen and heirs, and six are not heirs (but) kinsmen. Each preceding one is declared to be superior (to the one</p>

 <p>* 49. After their father's death, these (sons) shall succeed to his wealth in order. Whenever a superior son is wanting, the one next to him in rank is entitled to succession.</p>  
 <p>* 50. <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">50</font></a> On failure of a son, the daughter (succeeds), because she continues the lineage just like (a son); both a son and a daughter continue the lineage of their father.</p>  
 <p>* 51. <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">51</font></a> On failure of daughters, the Sakulyas (are to succeed) and (after them) the Bândhavas; next, a member of the same caste. In default of all, that (wealth) goes to the king,</p>

 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_564">188:1</a> XIII, 1. The term 'sons' includes by implication grandsons and <a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a> more remote descendants. The term 'paternal' includes property of the grandfather and more remote ancestors as well. Mandlik's Mayûkha, p. 33 (IV, 3, 1, Borrodaile). Analogous remarks are found in most other Commentaries.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_565"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_565">189:2</a> 'Their issue' (tadanvaya<i>h</i>). According to the usual explanation, the male issue of the daughters is meant. However, there is nothing in the text to warrant an exclusion of the female issue of daughters. Manu IX, 104, 192; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 117; Gautama XXVIII, 1; Baudhâyana II, 3, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_566"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_566">189:3</a> According to the Mayûkha, the clause 'when the sisters are married' has to be construed with both the preceding and following clauses, the marriage of the sisters being required to precede both a division in the father's lifetime and a division in the mother's lifetime. See Mayûkha, p. 33 (translation, p. 39). The Dâyabhâga has a totally different reading of this text, which is censured in the Vîramitrodaya. Gautama XXVIII, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_567"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_567">189:4</a> The Dâyabhâga (II, 82, Colebrooke) states correctly that the unequal distribution referred to in the last clause of this text must be different from that sort of unequal distribution under which the eldest son is to receive a larger share than the rest. The Mitâksharâ school, on the other hand, recognises two different modes of <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a> distribution only: one equal, and the other with the customary deductions in favour of the eldest son, middlemost son, &amp;c., according to the order of seniority. The writers of this school, therefore, have endeavoured to refute the interpretation of the Dâyabhâga. See Vîramitrodaya, transl., p. 54.Manu IX, 112 foll.; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 114; Âpastamba II, 6, 14; Gautama XXVIII, 2; Vish<i>n</i>u XVII, 1; Baudhâyana II, 3, 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_568">190:5</a> As the management of the property and government of the family, under this rule, may devolve on the youngest brother even, it follows that the middlemost brother may get it à fortiori. This is expressly stated in the Dâyabhâga (III, 1, 15, Colebrooke). Manu IX, 108.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_569"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_569">190:6</a> 'What was received at the time of obtaining a wife is here called the "wealth of a wife;" meaning effects obtained on account of marriage.' Dâyabhâga (VI, I, 13, Colebrooke); Manu IX, 206; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 119.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_570"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_570">190:8</a> It may be asked by whom the gifts presented before the nuptial fire and during the bridal procession, i.e. at two different stages of the marriage ceremony, must have been presented in <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a> order to be Strîdhana. As all the other gifts classed as Strîdhana are presented by relations, it may be inferred that the nuptial gifts have to come from the same quarter. Kâtyâyana declares expressly that a gift made by a stranger is not Strîdhana. Manu IX, 194; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 143, 144; Vish<i>n</i>u XVII, 18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_571">191:9</a> See XII, 38 foll. The commentators are of opinion that the Gândharva form of marriage follows the same rule as those four forms which are referred to in the first half of this text. This, however, is an artificial interpretation, which has merely been devised for the purpose of making this text agree with an analogous rule of Manu (IX, 196). Manu IX, 195-197; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 144, 145; Vish<i>n</i>u XVII, 19-21; Vasish<i>th</i>a XVII, 46; Baudhâyana II, 2, 3, 43. Read <i>k</i>aturshvâhu<i>h</i> in the text.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_573">191:11</a> 'The word "paternal" intends joint property.' Dâyabhâga VI, 1, 17; Manu IX, 206; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 119; Gautama XXVIII, 30.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_574"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_574">191:12</a> The rule which assigns two shares to a father distributing <a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a> his property himself, is referred to the father's self-acquired property in the Mitâksharâ school, and to ancestral property in the Bengal school. This difference of interpretation is connected with the varying views taken in the several schools of law of the extent of the patria potestas in questions of proprietary right and inheritance. See Dâyabhâga II, 35, Colebrooke; Mitâksharâ I, 5, 7, Colebrooke. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 123; Vish<i>n</i>u XVIII, 34.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_575">192:13</a> The share of an unmarried daughter, according to the translation here given, would have to be equal to the shares of the middlemost brothers. According to <i>G</i>agannâtha, all that is meant by Nârada is this, that the daughter shall receive some portion of the property, the precise amount of it being left undecided.

 <p><a name="fn_577"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_577">192:15</a> The writers of the Bengal school give this text its plain <a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a> meaning, viz. that a father may distribute his property among his sons as he pleases. They add, however, that in doing so he must be guided by lawful motives, such as compassion on an incapable son, partiality for a pious son, and the like. See Dâyabhâga II, 74, 75 Colebrooke's Digest, V, 1, 32. The Mayûkha, on the other hand, declares that this rule of Nârada had legal force in the former ages of the world only. See Mandlik's Mayûkha, p. 35 (transl. p. 43). Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 116.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_578"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_578">193:16</a> This rule 'relates to the case where the father, through perturbation of mind occasioned by disease or the like, or through irritation against any one of his sons, or through partiality for the child of a favourite wife, makes a distribution not conformable to law.' Colebrooke's Dâyabhâga II, 83. The Mitâksharâ (I, 2, 13, 54), cutting down the privileges of the father everywhere, interprets this rule as a prohibition of any other mode of unequal distribution except that by which the customary deductions are made in favour of the eldest son, &amp;c.</p>

 <p>21. The commentators are at variance as to the precise meaning of the term 'hostile to his father.' Thus the Sarasvatîvilâsa declares it to denote one who forgets himself so far as to say, 'He is not my father.' The Dâyakramasaṅgraha says it means one who beats his father. According to <i>G</i>agannâtha and the Ratnâkara, it means 'one who attempts his father's life or commits other hostile acts against him (mâra<i>n</i>âdik<i>ri</i>t), and who fails to offer the customary funeral oblations to his father after his death.' See Colebrooke's Digest, V, 4, 320.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_583">194:22</a> Atrophy or pulmonary consumption is instanced as a chronic, and leprosy as an acute disease, in the Ratnâkara. See Colebrooke's Digest, loc. cit.</p>

The 'son of two fathers' is no doubt one procreated by Niyoga on the wife of one impotent, &amp;c. It is not equally clear why he is to obtain one half only of the property left by his two fathers, as he is elsewhere declared to succeed to both. According to the Ratnâkara, this rule 'relates to the case where the natural father has a son begotten in lawful wedlock, and the husband of the mother also has by some means (katha<i>m</i><i>k</i>it) obtained male issue by himself begotten.' See Colebrooke's Digest, V, 4, 242.Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 127; Manu IX, 145, 190; Baudhâyana II, 3, 18, 19.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_586">195:25</a> 25, 26. The fact that the widow is invested with a claim to maintenance merely under this text, whereas the leading texts of Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya and Vish<i>n</i>u constitute her heir to the property of a husband who has died without leaving male issue, has caused some difficulty to the commentators. Thus Madana says that this text must be held applicable to the widow of an undivided or reunited coparcener only, who is given a mere claim to maintenance by all writers of the Mitâksharâ school. The writers of the Bengal school, on the other hand, recognise the widow's right of inheritance in the case of undivided coparceners even. It appears, however, from the order of heirs given in 49-51, that Nârada does not make the widow an heir in any case.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_589"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_589">196:28</a> All the commentators declare that the right of guardianship goes in the order of proximity.

 <p>30. 'They go to ruin,' i.e. they are guilty of disloyalty and other offences; thus, because they do not know what is legal for those who live exactly according to sacred ordinances, and because they cannot be instructed, they would violate the duties of their class and the like. <i>G</i>agannâtha.

 <p><a name="fn_592"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_592">197:32</a> The term pit<i>ri</i>dâyebhyo, 'when the father's obligations have been discharged,' is differently explained by different commentators. Thus Varadarâ<i>g</i>a (Burnell's Vyavahâranir<i>n</i>aya, p. 18) says it denotes the father's funeral rites and the like. A<i>k</i>yuta, as quoted in Colebrooke's Dâyabhâga I, 47, note, refers it to sums of which payment has been promised by the father. Manu VIII, 166; IX, 204; Baudhâyana II, 3, 8; Gautama XXVIII, 1; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 117. Read dattvar<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_593"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_593">197:33</a> There appears to be some doubt as to what is meant here by the term sa<i>m</i>skâra, 'initiatory or sacramental ceremonies,' some commentators including the ceremony of marriage in that term, and others declaring the initiatory ceremonies to terminate with the investiture with the sacred thread. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 224.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_594"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_594">198:35</a> Some commentators explain this text as having reference to one who generously declines to take his share at the time of partition. His share shall be made up afterwards by the other brothers contributing severally a portion of their shares. However, there seems to be more foundation for the opinion of those commentators who interpret this text as ordaining the allotment of a preferential share or the presentation of special gifts to the manager of the family property. See Colebrooke's Digest, V, 2, 108.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_595"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_595">198:36</a> The commentators observe that the contest here referred to does not turn on the mode but on the fact of partition. See Colebrooke's Digest, V, 6, 381. The business here referred to consists of agriculture and the like acts, according to the Mitâksharâ. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 149.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_596"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_596">198:37</a> The term 'religious duties,' according to the Mitâksharâ, relates principally to the five Mahâya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as, 'great sacrifices' or 'sacraments.' Before division they are performed by one brother, generally the eldest brother, as representative of the rest. Manu IX, III; Gautama XXVIII, 4.</p>

The upshot of a long discussion of this text by <i>G</i>agannâtha is this, that none of the acts mentioned here may be regarded as conclusive evidence by itself, a great deal of collective evidence of all sorts having to be adduced in each case. See Colebrooke's Digest, V, 6, 387.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_599"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_599">199:41</a> The term 'brothers' is here used to denote coparceners generally. Sm<i>ri</i>ti<i>k</i>andrikâ XVI, 14.

'Working utensils,' such as household furniture, the separate possession of which is indicative of partition.

 <p><a name="fn_604"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_604">201:50</a> <i>G</i>imûtavâhana and other writers of the Bengal school restrict the daughter's right of succession, as declared in this text, to those daughters who are neither barren nor widowed.

 <p>51. The term Sakulya is apparently used to denote the agnates, and Bândhava to denote the cognates. Therefore the last term sa<i>g</i>âti cannot be referred to blood-relationship at all, and must denote connexion by membership of the same caste. It is true that the commentators explain it as denoting descent from the same <i>Ri</i>shi. See Colebrooke's Digest, V, 8, 448.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_606"></a><a href="sbe3345.htm#fr_606">202:52</a> 'His women,' i.e. the women of the deceased proprietor. Vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âne<i>s</i>vara, Nîlaka<i>n</i><i>th</i>a, and other commentators declare that the term strî, 'woman,' cannot denote the legitimate wives of a deceased heir, and must therefore mean his concubines. This interpretation has been called forth, no doubt, by the fact that, in the opinion of these commentators, the inheritance of one sonless belongs to the widow in the first instance, and does not go to others, where a legitimate widow is in existence.</p>
