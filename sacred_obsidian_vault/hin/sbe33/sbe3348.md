 <p><a name="fn_639"></a><a href="sbe3348.htm#fr_639">212:1</a> XVII, 1. The translation is according to the Vîramitrodaya. The subject of bets on animals is treated at great length in the Dhammathats of Burma, which are based on the law-codes of India. 'Other games,' such as e.g. <i>K</i>aturaṅga (Shatra<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>, the Indian chess). 'Birds,' such as pigeons, also bets on professional wrestlers, rams, &amp;c. Vîramitrodaya, p. 718. Manu IX, 223.</p>

That portion which has to be paid to the king (see paragraph 8) may also be held to be included in this rule, as B<i>ri</i>haspati says: 'Let the master of the gaming-house collect the stakes and pay his due to the winning party and to the king.' Âpastamba II, 10, 25, 12, 13; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 199, 200.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_641"></a><a href="sbe3348.htm#fr_641">213:3</a> The rendering of the first portion of this paragraph is conjectural. It might also be translated as follows: 'When the dice on being thrown fall twice repeated,' i.e. when the number is twice as high as at the preceding throw.</p>
