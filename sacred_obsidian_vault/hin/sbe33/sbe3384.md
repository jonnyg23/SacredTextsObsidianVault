 <p>1. <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1290"><font size="1">1</font></a> Gambling has been prohibited by Manu, because it destroys truth, honesty, and wealth. It has been permitted by other (legislators) when conducted so as to allow the king a share (of every stake).</p>  
 <p>2. It shall take place under the superintendence of keepers of gaming-houses, as it serves the purpose of discovering thieves. The same rule has to be observed in bets on prize-fights with animals.</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">3</font></a> When birds, rams, deer or other (animals) are caused to fight against one another, after a wager has been laid, it is called betting on animals (samâhvaya).</p>  
 <p>

 <p>4. <a name="fr_1293"></a><a href="#fn_1292"><font size="1">4</font></a> When any one is defeated in a prize-fight between two animals, the wager which has been laid shall be paid by the owner of the (defeated) animal.</p>  
 <p>5. A wager (or game) shall be made in public; false gamblers shall be banished.</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_1294"></a><a href="#fn_1293"><font size="1">6</font></a> When there is a point at issue between the two parties (in a game or wager, other) gamblers shall examine (and decide) the matter; if they are enemies (of either party), the king shall decide the dispute.</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_1295"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">7</font></a> One defeated in a secret game; or ignorant of the rules; or (defeated) by the use of false dice, or by deceit, though acquainted with the game, shall be released; and one who has lost his entire wealth in a game shall not be compelled to give the whole of it.</p>  
 <p>8. The keeper of the gaming-house shall receive the stakes and pay the victorious gambler and the king; he shall also act as witness in a dispute, assisted by three other gamblers.</p>  
 <p>9. Those wicked men who use false dice in a game, or rob the king of his due, or cheat by making false computations, are declared to be gamblers deserving punishment.</p>
