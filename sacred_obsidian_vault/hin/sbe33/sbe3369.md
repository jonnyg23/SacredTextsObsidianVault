 <p>2. <a name="fr_1010"></a><a href="#fn_1009"><font size="1">2</font></a> That (loan) is termed kusîda (a loan on interest) which is exacted by persons apprehending no sin (from the act), from a mean (kutsita) or wretched (sîdat) man, after having been increased to four or eight times the original amount (through the interest accruing on it).</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_1011"></a><a href="#fn_1010"><font size="1">3</font></a> An eightieth part (of the principal) accrues as interest on it (every month); and it is certainly doubled by such interest within a third of a year less than seven years (that is to say, within six years and eight months).</p>

 <p>sorts; by others, it is stated to be fivefold; and by others again, it is said to be of six kinds. Learn their (various) qualities.</p>  
 <p>5. Kâyikâ (bodily interest); kâlikâ (periodical interest); <i>k</i>akrav<i>ri</i>ddhi (compound interest); kâritâ (stipulated interest); <i>s</i>ikhâv<i>ri</i>ddhi (hair-interest); and bhogalâbha (interest by enjoyment): such are the six kinds of interest.</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_1013"></a><a href="#fn_1012"><font size="1">6</font></a> Kâyikâ interest is connected with bodily labour; kâlikâ is due every month; <i>k</i>akrav<i>ri</i>ddhi is interest on interest; kâritâ is interest promised by the borrower.</p>  
 <p>7, 8. When interest is received every day, it is termed <i>s</i>ikhâv<i>ri</i>ddhi (hair-interest, because it grows every day). Because it grows constantly like hair, and does not cease growing except on the loss of the head, that is to say, on payment of the principal, therefore it is called hair-interest. The use of a (mortgaged) house, or the produce of a field, is termed bhogalâbha (interest by enjoyment).</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_1014"></a><a href="#fn_1013"><font size="1">9</font></a> That kâritâ (stipulated) interest has to be paid always, which has been stipulated by the debtor himself, over and above (the ordinary rate of interest), and has been promised in times of distress.</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_1015"></a><a href="#fn_1014"><font size="1">10</font></a> When (such special) interest has been stipulated in any other manner, it must not be paid by any means.</p>

 <p>enjoyment shall be taken by the creditor so long as the principal remains unpaid.</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_1017"></a><a href="#fn_1016"><font size="1">12</font></a> But the use of a pledge after twice the principal has been realised from it, compound interest, and the exaction of the principal and interest (together as principal) is usury and reprehensible.</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_1018"></a><a href="#fn_1017"><font size="1">13</font></a> On gold (and other precious metals), the interest may make (the debt) double; on clothes and base metals (such as tin or lead), treble; on grain, it is allowed to rise to four times the original amount, and so on edible plants (or fruit), beasts of burden, and wool.</p>  
 <p>14. It is allowed to make (the debt) quintuple, on pot-herbs; sextuple, on seeds and sugar-cane; and it may make (the debt) octuple, on salt, oil, and spirituous liquor.</p>  
 <p>15. Likewise, on sugar and honey, if the loan be of old standing.</p>  
 <p>16. <a name="fr_1019"></a><a href="#fn_1018"><font size="1">16</font></a> On grass, wood, bricks, thread, substances from which spirits may be extracted, leaves, bones, leather, weapons, flowers, and fruits, no interest is ordained.</p>

 <p>be of four sorts; movable or immovable; to be kept only or to be used; to be released at any time, or limited as to time; stated in writing, or stipulated (orally) before witnesses.</p>  
 <p>18. <a name="fr_1021"></a><a href="#fn_1020"><font size="1">18</font></a> Should the creditor, actuated by avarice, use a pledge before interest has ceased to accrue on the loan (on becoming equal to the principal), or before the fixed period has expired, such use shall be stopped.</p>  
 <p>19. The pledge has to be kept carefully, like a deposit; interest is forfeited in case of its being damaged.</p>  
 <p>20. <a name="fr_1022"></a><a href="#fn_1021"><font size="1">20</font></a> A pledge having been used and rendered worthless (by such use), the principal (itself) is lost; if a very valuable pledge be spoiled, he must satisfy the pledger.</p>  
 <p>21. <a name="fr_1023"></a><a href="#fn_1022"><font size="1">21</font></a> If a pledge be destroyed by a fatal accident or by an act of the king, the debtor shall be caused either to deliver another pledge or to pay the debt.</p>  
 <p>22. <a name="fr_1024"></a><a href="#fn_1023"><font size="1">22</font></a> When the debtor restores the principal and asks for his pledge, it must be restored to him; otherwise the creditor is liable to punishment.</p>

 <p>23. <a name="fr_1025"></a><a href="#fn_1024"><font size="1">23</font></a> When a field or other (immovable property) has been enjoyed, and more than the principal realised by it, then the debtor shall recover his pledge, if the principal and interest has been actually got out of it (by the creditor).</p>  
 <p>24. (This law applies) when the debtor delivers a field to the creditor, with the following stipulation, 'This (field) shall be enjoyed by you, when interest has ceased (on becoming equal to the principal), that is certain. When the principal has been realised together with the interest, you shall restore (the field) to me.'</p>  
 <p>25. <a name="fr_1026"></a><a href="#fn_1025"><font size="1">25</font></a> When the time (for payment) has passed and interest has ceased (on becoming equal to the principal), the creditor shall be owner of the pledge; but, till ten days have elapsed, the debtor is entitled to redeem it.</p>  
 <p>26. <a name="fr_1027"></a><a href="#fn_1026"><font size="1">26</font></a> Notice having been given to the debtor's family, a pledge to be kept (only) may be used, after the principal has been doubled; and so may a pledge for a fixed period, on the expiration of that term.</p>  
 <p>27. <a name="fr_1028"></a><a href="#fn_1027"><font size="1">27</font></a> When the principal has been doubled, or the stipulated period expired in the case of a pledge delivered for a certain time only, the creditor</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a></p>  
 <p>becomes owner of the pledge, after having waited for a fortnight.</p>  
 <p>28. If the debtor should pay the debt during that interval, he may recover his pledge (even then).</p>  
 <p>29. <a name="fr_1029"></a><a href="#fn_1028"><font size="1">29</font></a> When the amount of the debt has been doubled (by the interest accruing on it), and the debtor is either dead or no longer present, (the creditor) may take his chattel and sell it before witnesses.</p>  
 <p>30. Or, its value having been estimated in an assembly, he may keep it for ten days; after which, having realised a sufficient sum to cover his demand, he should relinquish the balance.</p>  
 <p>31. <a name="fr_1030"></a><a href="#fn_1029"><font size="1">31</font></a> When a man neither enjoys a pledge, nor obtains it (from the debtor), nor points it out (to others), his written contract (concerning the pledge) is invalid, (just like) a document when the (subscribing) witnesses and debtor are dead.</p>  
 <p>32. <a name="fr_1031"></a><a href="#fn_1030"><font size="1">32</font></a> When a house or field has been mortgaged for use and the period (fixed for such use) has not expired, the debtor cannot recover his property, nor can the creditor (recover) his loan.</p>  
 <p>33. When the (stipulated) period has elapsed, both</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a></p>  
 <p>parties are at liberty to do so. But, even before (the stipulated period) has elapsed, they may make an arrangement by mutual consent.</p>  
 <p>34. <a name="fr_1032"></a><a href="#fn_1031"><font size="1">34</font></a> Where one field has been mortgaged to two creditors at the same time, it shall belong to that mortgagee who was the first to obtain possession of it.</p>  
 <p>35. <a name="fr_1033"></a><a href="#fn_1032"><font size="1">35</font></a> If both have possessed it for an equal time, it shall be held in common (or shared equally) by them. The same rule is ordained in the case of a gift or a sale.</p>  
 <p>36. <a name="fr_1034"></a><a href="#fn_1033"><font size="1">36</font></a> Which course should be adopted in cases of a competition between three different acts, the identical property having been sold, mortgaged, and given away on one and the same day?</p>  
 <p>37. The three parties should divide that lawful property of theirs among themselves in proportionate shares, the two first in the ratio of their respective claims, whereas the donee ought to obtain a full third.</p>  
 <p>38. <a name="fr_1035"></a><a href="#fn_1034"><font size="1">38</font></a> The pledgee can never be compelled to restore the pledge against his will, before the whole amount due to him has been paid, nor must (the pledge be obtained from him) by deceit or by (the mode called) <i>K</i>arita.</p>

 <p>39. <a name="fr_1036"></a><a href="#fn_1035"><font size="1">39</font></a> For appearance, for confidence, for payment, and for delivering the assets of the debtor: it is for these four different purposes that sureties have been ordained by the sages in the system (of law).</p>  
 <p>40. <a name="fr_1037"></a><a href="#fn_1036"><font size="1">40</font></a> The first says, 'I will produce (that man);' the second (says), 'He is a respectable man;' the third (says), 'I will pay the debt; the fourth (says), 'I will deliver his assets.'</p>  
 <p>41. <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1037"><font size="1">41</font></a> If the debtors fail in their engagements, the two first (sureties themselves, but not their sons) must pay the sum lent at the appointed time; both the two last (sureties), and in default of them their sons (are liable for the debt), when the debtors break their promise (to pay the debt).</p>  
 <p>42. <a name="fr_1039"></a><a href="#fn_1038"><font size="1">42</font></a> The creditor should allow time for the surety to search for a debtor who has absconded; a fortnight, a month, a month and a half, according to (the distance of) the place (where he is supposed to be hiding himself).</p>  
 <p>43. (Sureties) must not be excessively harassed; they should be made to pay the debt by instalments;</p>

 <p>they must not be attacked when the debtor is present: such is the law regarding sureties.</p>  
 <p>44. <a name="fr_1040"></a><a href="#fn_1039"><font size="1">44</font></a> When (a surety), being harassed, pays a proved debt which he has vouched for, (the debtor) shall pay him twice as much, after the lapse of a month and a half.</p>  
 <p>45. <a name="fr_1041"></a><a href="#fn_1040"><font size="1">45</font></a> Should foolish (sureties) in good faith pay the debt, though not required to do so, or on being required to pay a different debt, how and from whom can they recover that sum?</p>

 <p>48. <a name="fr_1044"></a><a href="#fn_1043"><font size="1">48</font></a> The father's debt must be paid first of all, and after that, a man's own debt; but a debt contracted by the paternal grandfather must always be paid before these two even.</p>  
 <p>49. <a name="fr_1045"></a><a href="#fn_1044"><font size="1">49</font></a> The father's debt, on being proved, must be paid by the sons as if it were their own; the grandfather's debt must be paid (by his son's sons) without</p>

 <p>50. <a name="fr_1046"></a><a href="#fn_1045"><font size="1">50</font></a> When a debt has been incurred, for the benefit of the household, by an uncle, brother, son, wife, slave, pupil, or dependant, it must be paid by the head of the family.</p>  
 <p>51. <a name="fr_1047"></a><a href="#fn_1046"><font size="1">51</font></a> Sons shall not be made to pay (a debt incurred by their father) for spirituous liquor, for losses at play, for idle gifts, for promises made under the influence of love or wrath, or for suretyship, nor the balance of a fine or toll (liquidated in part by their father).</p>

 <p>57. <a name="fr_1053"></a><a href="#fn_1052"><font size="1">57</font></a> When a debtor is fettered and conducted into (the creditor's) own house, where he is compelled to pay the debt by beating or other (forcible) means, it is called compulsion.</p>

The commentators agree <a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a> in explaining the term âdhi, 'a pledge,' as denoting a pledge to be used, such as e.g. a cow to be used with her milk, or landed property pledged together with its produce. The term bandha, 'a deposit,' is supposed to denote a pledge which must not be used; according to the Mayûkha, however, it means a pledge which is not actually delivered to the creditor, the debtor merely promising not to alienate it. 'A pledge of adequate value' is one corresponding in value to the principal together with the interest. Vîram. p. 293. The term sâkshimat, 'attested,' is referred to a debt contracted orally before witnesses, both by Colebrooke (Dig. I, 1, 11) and Mandlik (May. loc. cit.). This, however, is opposed to the gloss of the Vîramitrodaya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1009"></a><a href="sbe3369.htm#fr_1010">320:2</a> May. p. 102; Col. Dig. I; 1, 3. It is hardly necessary to point out that the etymology here proposed of the term kusîda, 'a loan on interest,' is entirely fanciful. It is really derived from ku and sîda, and denotes 'that which adheres closely, and cannot easily be got rid of.' The commentators explain the clause 'apprehending no sin' to imply that it is sinful otherwise to accept a gift from an unworthy person.</p>

There is, however, another reading (v<i>ri</i>ddhis tu na nivartate), under which the purport of this rule becomes quite different, viz. that there is absolutely no limit regarding the interest on the articles mentioned in it. This version is in harmony with the corresponding regulations of other legislators.</p>
