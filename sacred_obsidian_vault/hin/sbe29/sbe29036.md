 <p>1 <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">1-2</font></a>. 'Waters are ye by name; happy ones are ye by name; sappy ones are ye by name; undecaying ones are ye by name; fearless ones are ye by name; immortal ones are ye by name. Of you, being such, may I partake; receive me into your favour'with these words (the teacher) makes the student sip water three times,</p>

 <p>3 <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">3</font></a>. An optional gift is the fee for the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>4 <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">4</font></a>. After (the teacher) has led him round the fire, turning his right side towards it, (the student) goes through the village to beg food.</p>  
 <p>5. (Let him beg,) however, of his mother first,</p>  
 <p>6. Or of a woman who will not refuse.</p>  
 <p>7 <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">7</font></a>. Having announced the alms to his teacher, he may eat (the food himself) with the master's permission.</p>  
 <p>8. The daily putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and obedience to the teacher: these are the standing duties of a student.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_142"></a><a href="sbe29036.htm#fr_143">67:1-2</a> 6, 1, 2. Râma<i>k</i>andra: '. . . with this Mantra which the teacher tells him, and which he (the student) pronounces, he sips water <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a> three times . . . He (the teacher) then gives him again the staff, which he had given him before silently.' I do not think that this double handing over of the staff agrees with the real meaning of the text; Gobhila also (II, 10) and Â<i>s</i>valâyana (I, 22, 1) prescribe the da<i>n</i><i>d</i>apradâna after the repetition of the Sâvitrî, without mentioning that the same had been already done before; Pâraskara II, 2, II speaks of the handing over of the staff before the recital of the Sâvitrî, and does not state that it should be repeated afterwards.</p>  
 <p>All these ceremonies, the teaching of the Sâvitrî as well as the da<i>n</i><i>d</i>apradâna, were considered as forming part of the Upanayana, even though a longer or shorter space of time (chap. 5, 1-3) might elapse between the first arrival of the student at the teacher's house and the performing of these rites. This follows from chap. 11, Sûtras 2-4.</p>
