 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="sbe29077.htm#fr_288">129:17-18</a> 17, 18. The text has u<i>k</i><i>k</i>aistarâmu<i>k</i><i>k</i>aistarâm, and nî<i>k</i>aistarâ<i>m</i>nî<i>k</i>aistarâm. Nârâya<i>n</i>a(comp. the text of his scholion, p. 155 of the German edition) understands this in a different way; he says that in the water-pot mentioned in the fifth Sûtra two different sthânas are to be distinguished, a higher part of it and a lower (uttarâdharatayâ). Now when the sacrificer, for instance, as prescribed in Sûtra 6, invites the Lord of the celestial Serpents, and the celestial Serpents to wash themselves, the pouring out of water would have to be performed first thrice for the Lord of the celestial Serpents in the higher place, then thrice for the celestial Serpents in the lower place.</p>
