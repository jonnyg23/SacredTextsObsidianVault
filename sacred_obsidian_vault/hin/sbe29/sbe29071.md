 <p><a name="fn_274"></a><a href="sbe29071.htm#fr_275">120:1</a> 9, 1. It is not expressly stated in our text for what occasion the tarpa<i>n</i>a (i.e. satiating of deities, <i>Ri</i>shis, &amp;c. with water-offerings), which is treated of in chap. 9-10, shall be prescribed. The comparison of Baudhâyana II, 9 might perhaps lead us to believe that the ceremony in question is to be performed whenever the sacrificer takes a bath. But the two texts which are most closely connected with ours, the <i>S</i>âmbavya and Â<i>s</i>valâyana G<i>ri</i>hyas, seem to point clearly to another conclusion. The <i>S</i>âmbavya-sûtra transposes the rules about the tarpa<i>n</i>a to the place which would correspond to Sûtra II, 7, 28 of our text. The passage of the <i>S</i>âmbavya-sûtra runs thus: mûle ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>m</i> k<i>ri</i>tvâ yathoktam adbhi<i>h</i> parishi<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>aty athemâs (so the MS.) tarpayati Agni<i>h</i> Pra<i>g</i>âpatir Virûpâksha<i>h</i>, &amp;c. It ends: pitara<i>h</i> pitâmahâ<i>h</i> prapitâmahâ<i>h</i> Paila<i>h</i> Kaho<i>l</i>a<i>h</i> Kaushîtaka<i>h</i> (sic) Kaho<i>l</i>âya Kaushîtakaye svadhâstv iti pratipurusha<i>h</i> (sic) pit<i>rî</i><i>m</i>s tarpayitvâ. The last words are taken from the Sûtra IV, 6, 6 of our text. Thus there can be no doubt that <i>S</i>âmbavya intended to prescribe the tarpa<i>n</i>a for the conclusion of the <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a> vedâdhyayana. The same can be said of Â<i>s</i>valâyana, who also by the position which he assigns to the tarpa<i>n</i>a sections (III, 4) brings it into a similar connection with the vedâdhyayana (see Nârâya<i>n</i>a's commentary on Â<i>s</i>v., loc. cit.). We may also refer to the treatise about the study of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka, which is appended to the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya as its sixth book; there the tarpa<i>n</i>a is mentioned quite in the same connection (VI, 6, 10 seq.). I believe, therefore, that in our text, chapters 9 and 10 have found their place here as a sort of supplementary addition to chap. 6, 6, just as in the first book the list of Nakshatras seems likewise appended to the Sûtra I, 25, 5.</p>  
 <p>According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, snâta<i>h</i> in the first Sûtra would refer to the bath which forms part of the Samâvartana ceremony (see III, 1, 1), so that it would be the G<i>ri</i>hastha, who has taken the Samâvartana bath, to whom the following rules refer.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_275"></a><a href="sbe29071.htm#fr_276">121:3</a> Comp. the similar lists of Â<i>s</i>valâyana, G<i>ri</i>hya III, 4; <i>S</i>âmbavya, quoted in my German edition of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, p.153; and Baudhâyana II, 9 (S.B.E., vol. xiv, pp. 252 seq.). The last seems to be the most modern.</p>  
 <p>It should be observed that the section of the list contained in this Sûtra, as well as that given below, chap. 10, 3, is divided into <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a> two parts, in the first of which the name of the being to be worshipped is given in the nominative case, with the verb tripyatu, while in the second it stands in the accusative, with the verb tarpayâmi. The first part of this section contains the names of gods and of divine beings, such as the rivers, the mountains, &amp;c.; in the second part are found abstract qualities or notions, such as mati, dhriti, <i>s</i>ruti. Similarly in chapter 10, 3 the Vedic poets, a few ancient teachers, and wise women, such as Gârg or Sulabhâ, form the first part of the list, and then follow, in the accusative case, the names of such doctors as Sàükhâyana, Â<i>s</i>valâyana, Sâkalya. In Â<i>s</i>valâyana's Sûtra of the first of our two sections only the first part reoccurs, the second is omitted, while the second section is found there in its entirety, with the same difference of names given in the nominative and accusative cases. The conjectures, however, which I had once based on this difference (see my German edition, pp. 152, 153) as to the distinction of a more ancient part of the list, and of later supplements, are perhaps too hazardous.</p>
