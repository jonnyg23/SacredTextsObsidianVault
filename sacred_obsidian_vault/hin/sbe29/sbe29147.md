 <p>1 <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (The relations of the dead person) now carry (his sacred) fires and (his) sacrificial vessels in that direction.</p>

 <p>2. After them aged persons forming an odd number, men and women not going together, (carry) the dead body.</p>  
 <p>3. Some (say) that (the dead body should be carried) in a cart with a seat, drawn by cows.</p>  
 <p>4 <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">4</font></a>. (Some prescribe) a she-animal for covering (the dead body with its limbs):</p>  
 <p>5. A cow,</p>  
 <p>6. Or a she-goat of one colour.</p>  
 <p>7. Some (take) a black one.</p>  
 <p>8. They tie (a rope) to its left fore-foot and lead it behind (the dead body).</p>  
 <p>9. Then follow the relations (of the dead person), wearing their sacrificial cords below (round their body), with the hair-locks untied, the older fines first, the younger ones last.</p>  
 <p>10 <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">10</font></a>. When they have thus arrived at the place, the performer (of the rites) walks three times round the spot with his left side turned towards it, and with a <i>S</i>amî branch sprinkles water on it, with (the verse), 'Go away, withdraw, and depart from here' (Rig-veda X, 14, 9).</p>  
 <p>11. To the south-east, on an elevated corner (of that place), he places the Âhavanîya fire,</p>  
 <p>12 <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">12-13</font></a>. To the north-west the Gârhapatya fire,</p>  
 <p>13. To the south-west the Dakshi<i>n</i>a fire.</p>  
 <p>14 <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">14</font></a>. After that a person that knows (how to do it), piles up between the fires a pile of fuel.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. After sacrificial grass and a black antelope's skin with the hair outside has been spread out there, they place the dead body thereon, which they have carried so as to pass by the Gârhapatya fire on its north-side, turning its head towards the Âhavanîya.</p>  
 <p>16 <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">16</font></a>. To the north (of the body they place) the wife (of the deceased),</p>  
 <p>17. And a bow for a Kshatriya.</p>  
 <p>18 <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">18</font></a>. Her brother-in-law, being a representative of her husband, or a pupil (of her husband), or an aged servant, should cause her to rise (from that place) with (the verse), 'Arise, O wife, to the world of life' (Rig-veda X, 18, 8).</p>  
 <p>19 <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">19</font></a>. The performer (of the rites) should murmur (that verse), if a <i>S</i>ûdra (makes her rise from the pile).</p>  
 <p>20. With (the verse), 'Taking the bow out of the hand of the deceased' (Rig-veda X, 18, 9), (he takes away) the bow.</p>  
 <p>21. It has been stated (what is to be done) in case a <i>S</i>ûdra (should perform this act).</p>  
 <p>22 <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">22</font></a>. Having bent the bow, he should, before the piling up (of the things mentioned below, which are put on the dead body) is done, break it to pieces, and throw it (on the pile).</p>
