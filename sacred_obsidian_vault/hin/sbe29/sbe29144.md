 <p><a name="fn_561"></a><a href="sbe29144.htm#fr_562">232:1</a> 11, 1. 'Covered' is v<i>ri</i>ta; 'I ward off' is the causative of the same verb, vâraye.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="sbe29144.htm#fr_563">233:11_2</a> The Svasti-Âtreya is the part of the hymn V, 51, which very frequently contains the word svasti (vv. 11-15). There is a Khila appended to that hymn (Rig-veda, vol. iii, p. 30), which, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, is also to be murmured on this occasion.</p>
