 <p>3. The other (relations) remain pure.</p>  
 <p>4. (The impurity lasts) through one night or three nights.</p>  
 <p>5. They bury the body without burning it.</p>  
 <p>6. If (a child dies) during the impurity of his mother (caused by the child's birth), the impurity lasts till the (mother's) getting up (from child-bed), in the same way as the impurity caused by a child's birth.</p>  
 <p>7 <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">7</font></a>. In this case (of the child being younger than two years) no water libations (are performed).</p>  
 <p>8. If a child of more than two years dies, all his relations should follow (the corpse) to the cemetery</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (the rites) from the election of the site (for the <i>S</i>ma<i>s</i>âna) down to their descending into water (in order to bathe themselves) are the same as those prescribed for persons who have set up the (sacred <i>S</i>rauta) fires.</p>  
 <p>11. They burn him with his (sacred) domestic fire, if he has kept that;</p>  
 <p>12. Silently, with a common fire, other persons.</p>  
 <p>13. They should ask one who is related (to the deceased person) by blood or by marriage, for (his permission to perform) the water-libation, in the words, 'We shall perform the libation.'</p>  
 <p>14. (He replies), 'Do so now and never again,' if the deceased person was not a hundred years old.</p>  
 <p>15. (He says) only, 'Do so,' if he was.</p>  
 <p>16 <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">16</font></a>. All relations (of the deceased), to the seventh or to the tenth degree, descend into water.</p>  
 <p>17. If dwelling in the same village, (all) as far as they can trace their relationship.</p>  
 <p>18. They wear (only) one garment, and have the sacred cord suspended over the right shoulder.</p>  
 <p>19. With the fourth finger of the left hand they spirt away (the water) with (the words), 'May he drive evil away from us with his splendour' (Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXXV, 6).</p>  
 <p>20. Facing the south, they plunge (into the water).</p>  
 <p>21. They pour out with joined hands one libation of water to the deceased person with (the words), 'N.N.! This water to thee!'</p>  
 <p>22. When they have come out (of the water) and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 357</font></a></p>  
 <p>have sat down on a pure spot that is covered with grass, (those who are versed in ancient tales) should entertain them (by telling such tales).</p>  
 <p>23 <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">23</font></a>. They return to the village without looking back, in one row, the youngest walking in front.</p>  
 <p>24 <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">24</font></a>. In the doors of their houses they chew leaves of the Pi<i>k</i>umanda (or Nimba) tree, sip water, touch water, fire, cowdung, white mustard seeds, and oil, tread upon a stone, and then they enter.</p>  
 <p>25 <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">25-26</font></a>. Through a period of three nights they should remain chaste, sleep on the ground, do no work and charge nobody (to do it for them).</p>  
 <p>26. Let them eat food which they have bought or received (from. others); (they should eat it) only in the day-time, (and should eat) no meat.</p>

 <p>28 <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">28</font></a>. They should that night put milk and water in an earthen vessel into the open air with (the words), 'Deceased one, bathe here!'</p>  
 <p>29 <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">29-30</font></a>. The impurity caused by death lasts through three nights;</p>  
 <p>30. Through ten nights, according to some (teachers).</p>

 <p>32. They should intermit the standing rites, except those performed with the three (<i>S</i>rauta) fires,</p>  
 <p>33. And (with the exception of those performed) with the (sacred) domestic fire, according to some (teachers).</p>

 <p>37 <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">37</font></a>. The entering and what follows after it is the same (for these persons) as for the others.</p>  
 <p>38. (Their) impurity lasts through one or two fortnights.</p>  
 <p>39. The same (rites should be performed) when the teacher (has died),</p>  
 <p>40. Or the maternal grandfather or grandmother,</p>  
 <p>41. Or unmarried females.</p>  
 <p>42 <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">42</font></a>. For those who were married, the others should do it,</p>

 <p>44 <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">44</font></a>. If one dies while being absent on a journey, (his relations) shall sit (on the ground, as prescribed for impure persons) from the time when they have heard (of his death), performing the water libation</p>

 <p>45. If (that period has already) elapsed, through one night or three nights.</p>  
 <p>46. Optional is the water libation for an officiating priest, a father-in-law, a friend, for (distant) relations, for a maternal uncle, and for a sister's son;</p>  
 <p>47 <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">47</font></a>. And for married females.</p>

 <p>49. Some also kill a cow in honour of the deceased person.</p>  
 <p>50. When the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as are prepared, the deceased person, if he has sons, shall be considered as the first of the (three) Fathers (to whom Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as are offered).</p>  
 <p>51 <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">51</font></a>. The fourth one should be left out.</p>

 <p>53 <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">53</font></a>. But there is a rule, 'There can be no fourth Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a'for this is stated in the <i>S</i>ruti.</p>
