 <p>3. Or with (the verse), 'This is thy womb' (Rig-veda III, 29, to) he warms the two kindling sticks,</p>  
 <p>4. Or an (ordinary log of) wood.</p>

If the fire goes out, he sacrifices the two Sarvaprâya<i>s</i><i>k</i>itta oblations (oblations for general expiation) and (other oblations) with (the formulas), 'Protect us, Agni, that we may prosper. Svâhâ! Protect us that we may obtain all wealth. Svâhâ! The sacrifice protect, O resplendent one! Svâhâ! Protect everything, O hundredfold wise one. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>9. In the case of a breach of his vow let him fast and sacrifice (an oblation) of Â<i>g</i>ya with (the verse), 'Thou, Agni, art the lord of the vow' (Rig-veda VIII, 11, 1).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_296"></a><a href="sbe29082.htm#fr_297">133:1</a> 1, 1. The ceremony of Samâroha<i>n</i>a, by which the duties towards the sacred fire are suspended, by causing the fire to 'enter' into the sacrificer's body, or into the two Ara<i>n</i>is, or into another piece of wood, is already mentioned in several passages of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a texts; comp. the quotations given by Professor Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 3r 1. Comp. besides Â<i>s</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra III 10; Sâṅkhâyana-<i>S</i>raut. II, 17. The Samâroha<i>n</i>a into the sacrificer's own body is done by warming the hands at the sacred fire; see Â<i>s</i>v., loc. cit., Sûtra 6. In the Sâṅkhâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra the corresponding rule, which regards there of course the Âhitâgni, runs thus, 'If he performs the Samâroha<i>n</i>a, he warms his hands at the Gârhapatya fire, and then touches his Prâ<i>n</i>as with the words, "Come, enter into my Prâ<i>n</i>as."' On the two other cases, see the Sûtras 3 and 4. Sûtras 2, 3, 5 are taken word for word from the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_297"></a><a href="sbe29082.htm#fr_298">133:2</a> This Sûtra refers only to the case where he causes the fire to enter into himself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_298"></a><a href="sbe29082.htm#fr_299">133:5</a> Comp. the commentary on Â<i>s</i>v.-<i>S</i>raut., loc. cit. 8. He makes the fire redescend from his body or from the Ara<i>n</i>is by performing the Manthana (kindling the fire by attrition of the Ara<i>n</i>is).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_299"></a><a href="sbe29082.htm#fr_300">133:7</a> The Mantra alluded to here is given in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra. It <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a> runs thus, 'Redescend, O <i>G</i>âtavedas; carry again offerings to the gods, knowing us. Long life, offspring, wealth bestow on us; uninjured shine in our dwelling!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_300"></a><a href="sbe29082.htm#fr_301">134:8-9</a> These Sûtras stand in no connection with the Samâroha<i>n</i>a treated of before.</p>  
 <p>On the two Sarvaprâya<i>s</i><i>k</i>itta oblations see above, I, 9, 12 and the note there.</p>  
 <p>The vow spoken of in Sûtra 9 Nârâya<i>n</i>a refers to the restrictions regarding the food which the sacrificer and his wife are to eat on the Upavasatha days, connected with the festivals of the full and new moon.</p>
