 <p>1 <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">1</font></a>. After ten days the getting up (of the mother from childbed).</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Father and mother with washed heads, wearing (new) clothes which have not yet been washed;</p>  
 <p>3. And so also the child.</p>  
 <p>4 <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Let (the father) cook a mess of food in that same fire that has been kept from her confinement,</p>  
 <p>5. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities.</p>  
 <p>6. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede (the corresponding Nakshatra).</p>  
 <p>7 <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">7</font></a>. (He then makes two other oblations with the verses,) '(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis; may thy face and thy seat be full of ghee; drinking ghee, the sweet honey of the cow, protect, as a father (protects) his son, here N.N.' The tenth oblation of the mess of cooked food with the verse, 'Thou, Soma, givest bliss to the old one' (Rig-veda I, 91, 7).</p>  
 <p>8. Having pronounced aloud (the child's) name,</p>  
 <p>9. And caused the Brâhma<i>n</i>as to say auspicious words,</p>  
 <p>10. And having sacrificed in the same way every month to the Tithi of (the child's) birth,</p>  
 <p>11 <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">11</font></a>. He sacrifices, when one year has expired, on the (ordinary) domestic fire.</p>
