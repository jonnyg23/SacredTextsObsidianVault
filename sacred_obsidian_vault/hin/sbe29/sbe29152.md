Now at a <i>S</i>râddha ceremony, at that which is celebrated on the Parvan day, or for the attainment of special wishes, or at the Âbhyudayika <i>S</i>râddha (i.e. the <i>S</i>râddha celebrated when some good luck has happened), or at the Ekoddish<i>t</i>a <i>S</i>râddha (the <i>S</i>râddha directed to a single dead person)</p>  
 <p>2. He causes Brâhma<i>n</i>as who are endowed with learning, moral character, and correct conduct, or with one of these (characteristics), who have been invited in time, who have taken a bath, washed their feet, and sipped water, to sit down, as representatives of the Fathers, with their faces turned to the north, one for each one of the Fathers, or two for each, or three for each.</p>  
 <p>3. The larger their number is, the greater is the reward (which the sacrificer is entitled to expect).</p>  
 <p>4. But in no case one (Brâhma<i>n</i>a) for all (the fathers).</p>

 <p>10. Having poured water into three vessels of metal, of stone, and of earthen-ware, or (into three vessels) made of the same substance, over which he has put Darbha grass,</p>  
 <p>And having recited over (that water the verse), 'For luck and help the divine waters' (Rig-veda X, 9, 4), he pours sesamum seeds into it with (the formula), 'Sesamum art thou; Soma is thy deity; at the Gosava sacrifice thou hast been created by</p>

With (the part) of the other (i.e. left) hand between the thumb (and the fore-finger), because he wears the sacrificial cord over <i>h</i>is left shoulder, or with the right hand which he seizes with the left (he offers the Arghya water to the Fathers with the words), 'Father, this is thy Arghya. Grandfather, this is thy Arghya. Great-grandfather, this is thy Arghya'having first offered (ordinary) water (to the Fathers).</p>  
 <p>14. When he is going to hand over that (Arghya water to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as who represent the Fathers, he says once each time), 'Svadhâ! The Arghya water!'</p>  
 <p>15 <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">15</font></a>. Over (the Arghya water) which has been</p>

 <p>poured out, he should recite the verse, 'The celestial waters which have been produced on the earth, the aerial waters and the waters which are terrestrial, the gold-coloured ones, apt for sacrifice, may these waters bring us luck and be kind to us.' Pouring together what has been left (in the three Arghya vessels) he moistens his face with that water, if he desires that a son should be born to him.</p>  
 <p>16 <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">16</font></a>. 'He should not take up the first vessel, into which the Arghya water for the Fathers has been poured. Hidden the Fathers dwell therein: thus <i>S</i>aunaka has said.'</p>  
 <p>17 <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">17</font></a>. In that moment the gifts of perfumes, garlands, incense, lights, and clothes are offered (to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as).</p>  
 <p>18. Having taken some food (of the Sthâlîpâka prepared for the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>apit<i>ri</i>ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a), and having besmeared it with ghee, he asks (the Brâhma<i>n</i>as) for their permission by saying, 'I shall offer it in the fire,' or, 'I will sacrifice my offering in the fire,' or, 'I will offer it in the fire.'</p>  
 <p>19. The permission (is given in the words), 'It may be offered,' or, 'Sacrifice thy offering,' or, Offer it.'</p>

 <p>22. 'The mouth of the gods verily is the fire, the mouth of the Fathers is the hand'thus says the Brâhma<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>23. If in the hands, he assigns to them other food, after they have sipped water.</p>  
 <p>24 <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">24</font></a>. The food (is put together) with the food.</p>  
 <p>25 <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">25</font></a>. It is said, 'What is given away and offered, that brings prosperity.'</p>  
 <p>26 <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">26</font></a>. When he sees that they are satiated, he should recite (the verses) containing the word m a dh u, and (the verse), 'They have eaten, they have enjoyed themselves' (Rig-veda I, 82, 2).</p>  
 <p>27 <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">27</font></a>. Having asked them, 'Relished?' and having taken the food, whatever food he has used, together with the Sthâlîpâka, in order to make lumps thereof, he should offer the rest (to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as).</p>  
 <p>28. After they have either accepted (that rest of food), or left it (to him), and have finished eating, he should, before they have sipped water, put down the lumps for the Fathers.</p>

 <p>30 <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">30</font></a>. Having strewn the food on the ground and suspended the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, he should dismiss the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, (saying to them), 'Say Om! Svadhâ!'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_622"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_623">250:1</a> 7, 1. Comp. on the <i>S</i>râddha ceremonies in general the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 1, 1, and the quotations given there. The Pârva<i>n</i>a <i>S</i>râddha, which is celebrated on the new-moon day, is treated of by <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 1, the Âbhyudayika <i>S</i>râddha, IV, 4, the Ekoddish<i>t</i>a <i>S</i>râddha, IV, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_623"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_624">251:5</a> Anâdye. Of the different interpretations of this word which Nârâya<i>n</i>a gives, it may suffice here to quote two. The first <i>S</i>râddha may either mean the Pârva<i>n</i>a <i>S</i>râddha, because this stands first among the different kinds of <i>S</i>râddha ceremonies enumerated in Sûtra 1; or it may mean the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>îkara<i>n</i>a (see Sâṅkhâyana IV, 3), for this is the first occasion on which a dead person receives <i>S</i>râddha oblations together with two others of the Fathers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_624"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_625">251:6</a> The sacrifice to the Manes, as forming part of the <i>S</i>rauta ritual, is explained in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra II, 6 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_625"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_626">251:8</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 229.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_626"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_627">251:9</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 230. The reading of several words of the Mantra is doubtful, and the parallel texts, as Prof. Stenzler has not failed to observe, differ; especially the words pratnavadbhi<i>h</i> pratta<i>h</i> seem to me to be corrupt. The word pratnavat is only known to the Petersburg Dictionary as having the meaning, 'containing the word pratna,' which will not do here. Thus, I think that the reading pratnam adbhi<i>h</i> p<i>ri</i>kta<i>h</i> should be adopted; the translation would be, 'Anciently thou hast been mixed with water.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_627"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_628">252:12</a> Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 4, 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_628"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_629">252:13</a> The part of the hand above the thumb is called the 'Tîrtha belonging to the Manes;' see, for instance, Baudhâyana's Dharma-sûtra I, 8, 16. The sacrificer is here understood to wear his sacrificial cord suspended over the left shoulder (he is 'yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>opavîtin'). But as the oblation here treated of is directed to the Manes, it is required that he should be prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtin. Now he is considered as prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtin, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, not only if the cord is suspended over his right shoulder (which is the ordinary meaning of prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtin), but also if the hand with which he performs the rites, and the shoulder over which he wears the sacred cord, are either both right or both left. Thus here, acting with the left-hand and wearing the cord over the left shoulder, he becomes prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtin.</p>  
 <p>The last word (appûrvam) is separated by Nârâya<i>n</i>a from the rest, so that it forms a separate Sûtra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_629"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_630">252:15</a> The sacrificer gives the water to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and these <a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a> pour it out. Instead of p<i>ri</i>thivî sambabhûvu<i>h</i> (p<i>ri</i>thivî being intended as a locative; see Lanman, Noun-inflection in the Veda, p. 389) we should read, no doubt, as the parallel texts have, payasâ sambabhûvu<i>h</i>: 'The celestial waters which have united themselves with milk.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_632"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_633">253:20</a> The oblations alluded to in this Sûtra are prescribed in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra, II, 6, 12. They are directed to Soma pit<i>ri</i>mat and to Agni kavyavâhana.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_633"></a><a href="sbe29152.htm#fr_634">254:21</a> According to Manu (III, 212) this is done only in case there is no fire. Possibly abhyanu<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âyâm belongs to Sûtra 20, so that we should have to translate, 'He then sacrifices . . . if they give their permission. Or in the hands.'</p>
