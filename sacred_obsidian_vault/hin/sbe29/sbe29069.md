 <p><a name="fn_259"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_260">115:2</a> 7, 2. The translation of âkâlam given in my German edition (Während der betreffenden Zeit) is wrong: comp. the commentary there quoted at p. 150; Gautama XVI, 22; Professor Stenzler's note on Pâraskara II, II, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_261">115:7_6</a> Agha<i>m</i> sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>asodakayor mara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>. Nârâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_261"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_262">115:7</a> According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a the <i>k</i>a at the end of this Sûtra would <a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a> be intended to convey the meaning that on the pratipad days of each fortnight the study should also be interrupted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_263">116:8</a> The translation of nabhya is quite conjectural. Nârâya<i>n</i>a gives a different meaning to this word; comp. p. 150 of the German edition.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_263"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_264">116:11</a> Â<i>k</i>âryaputrâdaya<i>h</i>. Nârâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_265">116:21</a> The reason why the recitation of the Rig-veda is forbidden when the sound of a Sâman is heard, becomes manifest, for instance, from Âpastamba I, to, 7, where the discontinuance of the Veda-study is prescribed when the barking of dogs, the braying of asses, the cry of a wolf, &amp;c., the sound of musical instruments, of weeping, and of a Sâman is heard. Loud sounds like these would disturb the recitation of <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> or Ya<i>g</i>us texts. A very curious opinion has been recently brought forward by Professor Aufrecht (see his edition of the Rig-veda, second edition, vol. ii, p. xxxviii) that the incompatibility of the recitation of <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> hymns and of Sâmans 'beruht auf der Kenntniss von der Willkür and der zum Theil unwürdigen Weise, in welcher der alte Text des Rig-veda in diesem Gesangbuche (i.e. the Sâmavedâr<i>k</i>ika) behandelt ist.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_266">117:23</a> Grâmâra<i>n</i>ye grâmam (read, grâma?) evâra<i>n</i>ya<i>m</i> vana<i>m</i> tatra nâdhîyîta. Nârâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_266"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_267">117:29</a> Except during the rainy season. Nârâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_268">117:45</a> Nârâya<i>n</i>a also understands maithuna, and I think that the German translation ought to be corrected accordingly.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_268"></a><a href="sbe29069.htm#fr_269">118:53</a> I think that this Sûtra contains two different rules which have to be separated, viz. 1. vidyutstanayitnuvarshavar<i>g</i>a<i>m</i> kalpe; 2. varshavad ardhashash<i>th</i>eshu. The first of these rules would extend the cases of anadhyâya mentioned in this chapter to the study of the Kalpa-sûtra, except the cases of lightning, rain, &amp;c. The second would refer to the five months and a half following on the Utsarga ceremony (comp. chap. 6, 8), and would imply that during this time the same texts are to be studied or not, according as their study is allowed or forbidden during rainfall: i.e. the study of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ is to be discontinued, while that of the Kalpa is allowed to go on. Râma<i>k</i>andra and Nârâya<i>n</i>a differ from this interpretation; see p. 151 of the German edition.</p>
