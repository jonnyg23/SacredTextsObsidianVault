 <p>MOST of the questions referring to the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra of Â<i>s</i>valâyana will be treated of more conveniently in connection with the different subjects which we shall have to discuss in our General Introduction to the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras. Here I wish only to call attention to a well-known passage of Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, in which that commentator gives some statements on the works composed by Â<i>s</i>valâyana and by his teacher <i>S</i>aunaka. As an important point in that passage has, as far as I can see, been misunderstood by several eminent scholars, I may perhaps be allowed here to try and correct that misunderstanding, though the point stands in a less direct connection with the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra than with another side of the literary activity of Â<i>s</i>valâyana.</p>  
 <p>Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">1</font></a>, before speaking of Â<i>s</i>valâyana, makes the following statements with regard to Â<i>s</i>valâyana's teacher, <i>S</i>aunaka. 'There was,' he says, 'the <i>S</i>âkala Sa<i>m</i>hitâ (of the Rig-veda), and the Bâshkala Sa<i>m</i>hitâ; following these two Sa<i>m</i>hitâs and the twenty-one Brâhma<i>n</i>as, adopting principally the Aitareyaka and supplementing it by the other texts, he who was revered by the whole number of great <i>Ri</i>shis composed the first Kalpa-sûtra.' He then goes on to speak of Â<i>s</i>valâyana'<i>S</i>aunaka's pupil was the venerable Â<i>s</i>valâyana. He who knew everything he had learnt from that teacher, composed a Sûtra and announced (to <i>S</i>aunaka that he had done so) <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' <i>S</i>aunaka then destroyed his own Sûtra, and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a></p>  
 <p>determined that Â<i>s</i>valâyana's Sûtra should be adopted by the students of that Vedic <i>S</i>âkhâ. Thus, says Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, there were twelve works of <i>S</i>aunaka by which a correct knowledge of the Rig-veda was preserved, and three works of Â<i>s</i>valâyana. <i>S</i>aunaka's da<i>s</i>a granthâs were, the five Anukrama<i>n</i>îs, the two Vidbânas, the Bârhaddaivata, the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, and a Smârta work <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Â<i>s</i>valâyana, on the other hand, composed the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra in twelve Adhyâyas, the G<i>ri</i>hya in four Adhyâyas, and the fourth Âra<i>n</i>yaka: this is Â<i>s</i>valâyana's great Sûtra composition <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Here we have an interesting and important statement by which the authorship of a part of the Aitareyâra<i>n</i>yaka, which would thus be separated from the rest of that text, is ascribed, not to Mahidâsa Aitareya, but to an author of what may be called the historical period of Vedic antiquity, to Â<i>s</i>valâyana.</p>  
 <p>But what is the fourth Âra<i>n</i>yaka to which this passage refers? Is it the text which is now set down, for instance, in Dr. Râ<i>g</i>endralâla Mitra's edition, as the fourth Âra<i>n</i>yaka of the Aitareyinas?</p>  
 <p>Before we give an answer to this question, attention must be called to other passages referring, as it could seem, to another part, namely, the fifth part of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka.</p>  
 <p>Sâya<i>n</i>a, in his great commentary on the Rig-veda, very frequently quotes the pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>amâra<i>n</i>yaka as belonging to <i>S</i>aunaka. Thus in vol. i, p. 112, ed. Max Müller, he says: pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>amâra<i>n</i>yaka aush<i>n</i>ihat<i>ri</i><i>k</i>â<i>s</i>îtir iti kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>e <i>S</i>aunakena sûtrita<i>m</i> surûpak<i>ri</i>tnum ûtaya iti trî<i>n</i>y endra sânasi<i>m</i> rayim iti dve iti. There is indeed in the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka a chapter beginning with the words aush<i>n</i>ihi t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>â<i>s</i>îti<i>h</i>, in which the words quoted by Sâya<i>n</i>a occur <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Similar quotations, in</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p>  
 <p>which the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka is assigned to <i>S</i>aunaka, are found in Sâya<i>n</i>a's commentary on the Âra<i>n</i>yaka itself; see, for instance, p. 97, line 19, p. 116, line 3.</p>  
 <p>Thus it seems that the authorship of both the fourth and the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka was ascribed to teachers belonging to the Sûtra period of Vedic literature, viz. to <i>S</i>aunaka and to Â<i>s</i>valâyana respectively. And so we find the case stated by both Professor Weber, in his 'Vorlesungen über indische Literaturgeschichte <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' and Dr. Râ<i>g</i>endralâla Mitra, in the Introduction to his edition of the Aitareya Âra<i>n</i>yaka <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>But we must ask ourselves: Are the two books of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka collection, ascribed to those two authors, really two different books? It is a surprising fact that Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, while speaking of Â<i>s</i>valâyana's authorship of the fourth book, and while at the same time intending, as he evidently does, to give a complete list of <i>S</i>aunaka's compositions, does not mention the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka among the works of that author. In order to account for this omission the conjecture seems to suggest itself that Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, when speaking of the fourth Âra<i>n</i>yaka as belonging to Â<i>s</i>valâyana, means the same work which Sâya<i>n</i>a sets down as the fifth, and which he ascribes to <i>S</i>aunaka. At first sight this conjecture may seem perhaps rather hazardous or unnatural; however I believe that, if we compare the two texts themselves which are concerned, we shall find it very probable and even evident. What do those two Âra<i>n</i>yaka books contain? The fourth is very short: it does not fill more than one page in the printed edition. Its contents consist exclusively of the text of the Mahânâmnî or <i>S</i>akvarî verses, which seem to belong to a not less remote</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p>  
 <p>antiquity than the average of the Rig-veda hymns. They can indeed be considered as forming part of the Rig-veda Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, and it is only on account of the peculiar mystical holiness ascribed to these verses, that they were not studied in the village but in the forest <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and were consequently received not into the body of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ itself, but into the Âra<i>n</i>yaka. They are referred to in all Brâhma<i>n</i>a texts, and perhaps we can even go so far as to pronounce our opinion that some passages of the Rig-veda hymns themselves allude to the <i>S</i>akvarî verses:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>ya<i>k</i> <i>kh</i>akvarîshu b<i>ri</i>hatâ rave<i>n</i>endre <i>s</i>ushmam adadhâtâ Vasish<i>th</i>â<i>h</i> (Rig-veda VII, 33, 4).<br> <i>ri</i>kâ<i>m</i> tva<i>h</i> posham âste pupushvân gâyatra<i>m</i> tvo gâyati <i>s</i>akvarîshu (Rig-veda X, 71, 11).</dir>  
 <p>So much for the fourth Âra<i>n</i>yaka. The fifth contains a description of the Mahâvrata ceremony. To the same subject also the first book is devoted, with the difference that the first book is composed in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a style, the fifth in the Sûtra style <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Now which of these two books can it be that Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya reckons as belonging to the 'Â<i>s</i>valâyanasûtraka?' It is impossible that it should be the fourth, for the Mahânâmnî verses never were considered by Indian theologians as the work of a human author; they shared in the apaurusheyatva of the Veda, and to say that they have been composed by Â<i>s</i>valâyana, would be inconsistent with the most firmly established principles of the literary history of the Veda both as conceived by the Indians and by ourselves. And even if we were to admit that the Mahânâmnî verses can have been assigned, by an author like Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, to Â<i>s</i>valâyana,and we cannot admit</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a></p>  
 <p>this,there is no possibility whatever that he can have used the expression 'Â<i>s</i>valâyanasûtrakam' with regard to the Mahânâmnîs; to apply the designation of a Sûtra to the Mahânâmnî hymn would be no less absurd than to apply it to any Sûkta whatever of the <i>Ri</i>k-Sa<i>m</i>hitâ. On the other hand, the fifth book of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka is a Sûtra; it is the only part of the whole body of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka collection which is composed in the Sûtra style. And it treats of a special part of the Rig-veda ritual the rest of which is embodied in its entirety, with the omission only of that very part, in the two great Sûtras of Â<i>s</i>valâyana. There seems to me, therefore, to be little doubt as to the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka really being the text referred to by Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, though I do not know how to explain his setting down this book as the fourth. And I may add that there is a passage, hitherto, as far as I know, unnoticed, in Sâya<i>n</i>a's Sâma-veda commentary, in which that author directly assigns the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka not, as in the Rig-veda commentary, to <i>S</i>aunaka, but to Â<i>s</i>valâyana. Sâya<i>n</i>a there says <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">1</font></a>: yathâ bahv<i>ri</i>kâm adhyâpakâ mahâvrataprayogapratipâdakam Â<i>s</i>valâyananirmita<i>m</i> kalpasûtram ara<i>n</i>ye<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>dhîyamânâ<i>h</i> pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>amam âra<i>n</i>yakam iti vedatvena vyavaharanti.</p>  
 <p>Instead of asserting, therefore, that of the two last Âra<i>n</i>yakas of the Aitareyinas the one is ascribed to <i>S</i>aunaka, the other to Â<i>s</i>valâyana, we must state the case otherwise: not two Âra<i>n</i>yakas were, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a and Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, composed by those Sûtrakâras, but one, viz. the fifth, which forms a sort of supplement to the great body of the Sûtras of that <i>K</i>ara<i>n</i>a, and which is ascribed either to <i>S</i>aunaka or to Â<i>s</i>valâyana. Perhaps further research will enable us to decide whether that Sûtra portion of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka, or we may say quite as well, that Âra<i>n</i>yaka portion of the Sûtra, belongs to the author of the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra, or should be considered as a remnant of a more ancient composition, of which the portion studied in the forest has survived, while the portion</p>

 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p>which was taught in the village was superseded by the more recent Â<i>s</i>valâyana-sûtra.</p>  
 <p>There would be still many questions with which an Introduction to Â<i>s</i>valâyana would have to deal; thus the relation between Â<i>s</i>valâyana and <i>S</i>aunaka, which we had intended to treat of here with reference to a special point, would have to be further discussed with regard to several other of its bearings, and the results which follow therefrom as to the position of Â<i>s</i>valâyana in the history of Vedic literature would have to be stated. But we prefer to reserve the discussion of these questions for the General Introduction to the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras.</p>
