 <p>daughters of Pra<i>g</i>âpati (protect me). May one who does not know me, be below me. May (all) people be considerate in what they say.'</p>  
 <p>4. When he has arrived at the assembly, he should murmur, 'Superior (to my adversaries) I have come hither, brilliant, not to be contradicted. The lord of this assembly is a man insuperable in his power.'</p>  
 <p>5 <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_951"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Should he think, 'This person is angry with me,' he addresses him with (the verses), The destroying power of wrath and anger that dwells here on thy forehead, that the chaste, wise gods may take away.</p>  
 <p>'Heaven am I and I am Earth; we both take away thy anger; the she-mule cannot bring forth offspring; N.N.!'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_950"></a><a href="sbe29203.htm#fr_951">362:3</a> In Sanskrit the words sabha (court) and samiti (assembly) are of feminine gender. I have translated upa ma sa tish<i>th</i>et in the sense indicated by Pâ<i>n</i>ini I, 4, 87.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_951"></a><a href="sbe29203.htm#fr_952">363:5</a> Perhaps we should read garbhe<i>n</i>â<i>s</i>vataryâ<i>h</i> saha: we take away thy anger together with the offspring of the she-mule (that cannot foal). Comp. <i>K</i>ullavagga VII, 2, 5; S.B.E., XX, 238.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_952"></a><a href="sbe29203.htm#fr_953">363:6</a> It is impossible to give a sure restoration of this corrupt Mantra. Perhaps we should read something like this: â te vâ<i>k</i>am âsya â te h<i>ri</i>daya âdade. Comp. Hira<i>n</i>y.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 15, 6.</p>
