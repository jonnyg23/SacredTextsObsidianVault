 <p>1 <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (He says), 'Memory and reproach and knowledge, faith, and wisdom as the fifth, what is sacrificed, and what is given, and what is studied, and what is done, truth, learning, vow</p>  
 <p>'The vow which belongs to Agni together with Indra, with Pra<i>g</i>âpati, with the <i>Ri</i>shis, with the royal ones among the <i>Ri</i>shis, with the Fathers, with the royal ones among the Fathers, with the human beings, with the royal ones among the human beings, with shine, over-shine, after-shine, counter-shine, with gods and men, with Gandharvas and Apsaras, with wild animals and domestic animals,the vow, belonging to my own self, dwelling in my own self, that is my universal vow. Hereby, O Agni, I become addicted to the universal vow. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>2 <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">2</font></a>. With (the hymn), 'Mine, Agni, be vigour' (Rig-veda X, 128, 1), verse by verse, he should put pieces of wood (on the fire).</p>  
 <p>3 <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He should pass that night at a place where they will do honour to him.</p>

 <p>4 <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">4</font></a>. When, after having finished his (task of) learning, he has offered something to the teacher, or has received his permission, he should take a bath (which signifies the end of his studentship).</p>  
 <p>5. He (i.e. the Snâtaka) has to keep the following observances:</p>  
 <p>6. He shall not bathe in the night-time; he shall not bathe naked; he shall not lie down naked; he shall not look at a naked woman, except during sexual intercourse; he shall not run during rain; he shall not climb up a tree; he shall not descend into a well; he shall not swim with his arms across a river; he shall not expose himself to danger. 'A great being indeed is a Snâtaka'thus it is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_554"></a><a href="sbe29142.htm#fr_555">229:1</a> 9, 1. '"My memory and my non-memory, that is my double vow"in this way the twelve (parts of which the first section of the Mantra consists) should be recited.' Nârâya<i>n</i>a. I think the commentator is wrong here, and that section should rather be recited as it is given in the text without any alteration; it forms a regular <i>S</i>loka. Agne<i>h</i> instead of Agne is a conjecture of Prof. Stenzler, which I have adopted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_555"></a><a href="sbe29142.htm#fr_556">229:2</a> According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a the hymn should be recited including the Khila, so that ten pieces of wood are offered. Now the hymn consists of nine verses; there can be, consequently, only one Khailika verse, which is, I suppose, the first verse of the Khila quoted above, p. 228.</p>
