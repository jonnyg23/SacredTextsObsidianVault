 <p>3. With a loud voice (the words) following after the name.</p>  
 <p>4. 'Of inhalation and exhalation'(this he says) with a low voice,</p>  
 <p>5. And (the verse), 'Come hither, Indra, with thy lovely-sounding, fallow-coloured (horses)' (Rig-veda III, 45, 1).</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">6</font></a>. The aged one then murmurs, 'To inhalation and exhalation I, the wide-extended one, resort with thee. To the god Savit<i>ri</i> I give thee in charge'and the verse.</p>  
 <p>7. When he has finished (that verse), and has muttered, 'Om! Forwards! Blessing!' and recited (over the student the hymn), 'The great bliss of the three' (Rig-veda X, 185)(he should dismiss him).</p>  
 <p>8. On one who has been thus dismissed, danger comes from no sidethus it is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti).</p>  
 <p>9. If he hears (on his way) disagreeable voices of birds, he should murmur the two hymns, 'Shrieking, manifesting his being' (Rig-veda II, 42, 43), and (the verse), 'The divine voice have the gods created' (Rig-veda VIII, 100, 11).</p>  
 <p>10. 'Praise the renowned youth who sits on the war-chariot' (Rig-veda II, 33, 11)if (he hears disagreeable voices) of deer.</p>  
 <p>11. From the direction, or from the (being) from which he expects danger, towards that direction he should throw a fire-brand, burning on both sides, or having twirled about a churning-stick from the right to the left, with (the words), 'Safety be to me, Mitra</p>

 <p>and Varu<i>n</i>a; encounter the foes and burn them up with your flame. May they find none who knows them and no support; divided by discord may they go to death'</p>  
 <p>12. He turns the churning-stick downwards with (the verse), 'The combined wealth of both, heaped together' (Rig-veda X, 84, 7).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_558"></a><a href="sbe29143.htm#fr_559">230:1</a> 10, 1. Nârâya<i>n</i>a refers this rule to a student who has performed the Samâvartana and wishes to go away. But a comparison of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 18 seems to make it probable that the ceremony described here has nothing to do with the Samâvartana.</p>  
 <p>I take this chapter rather for a description of the way in which a student has to take leave of his teacher when setting out on a journey. 'His name' is the teacher's name, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
