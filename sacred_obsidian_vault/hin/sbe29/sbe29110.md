 <p>1. Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>2 <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Having prepared to the north of the fire the place for the <i>S</i>âmitra fire, having given drink (to the animal which he is going to sacrifice), having washed the animal, having placed it to the east (of the fire) with its face to the west, having made oblations with the two <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>as, 'Agni as our messenger' (Rig-veda I, 12, 1 seq.), let him touch (the animal) from behind with a fresh branch on which there are leaves, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I touch thee.'</p>  
 <p>3. He sprinkles it from before with water in which rice and barley are, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.'</p>  
 <p>4. Having given (to the animal) to drink of that (water), he should pour out the rest (of it) along its right fore-foot.</p>  
 <p>5. Having carried fire round (it), performing that act only (without repeating a corresponding Mantra), they lead it to the north.</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">6</font></a>. In front of it they carry a fire-brand.</p>

 <p>8 <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">8</font></a>. With the two Vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>n</i>î ladles the 'performer' touches the animal.</p>  
 <p>9. The sacrificer (touches) the performer.</p>  
 <p>10 <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">10</font></a>. To the west of the <i>S</i>âmitra (fire) he (the <i>S</i>amit<i>ri</i>) kills (the animal), the head of which is turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal's) navel, (the 'performer') draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with the two Agni<i>s</i>rapa<i>n</i>îs, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the <i>S</i>âmitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.</p>  
 <p>11 <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">11</font></a>. At the same fire they cook a mess of food.</p>  
 <p>12 <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">12</font></a>. Having cut off the eleven Avadânas (or portions which have to be cut off) from the animal, from all its limbs, having boiled them at the <i>S</i>âmitra (fire),</p>

 <p>and having warmed the heart on a spit, let him sacrifice first from the mess of cooked food (mentioned in Sûtra 11);</p>  
 <p>13. Or together with the Avadâna portions.</p>  
 <p>14 <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">14</font></a>. From each of the (eleven) Avadânas he cuts off two portions.</p>  
 <p>15 <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">15</font></a>. They perform the rites only (without corresponding Mantras) with the heart's spit (i.e. the spit on which the heart had been; see Sûtra 12).</p>

The Sâmitra fire (literally, the fire of the Samit<i>ri</i>, who prepares the flesh of the immolated animal) is the one mentioned below in Sûtras 7 and 10. Comp. Indische Studien, X, 345. 'I touch thee' is upâkaromi; comp. Kâtyâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VI, 3, 19. 26.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_422"></a><a href="sbe29110.htm#fr_423">176:6</a> It seems that this fire-brand is the same which had been carried round the animal, according to Sûtra 5. Comp. Kâtyâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VI, 5, 2-5.</p>

The act which is here attributed to the kart<i>ri</i> ('performer'), belongs in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual to the incumbencies of the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_425"></a><a href="sbe29110.htm#fr_426">177:10</a> On the way in which animals had to b. killed at sacrifices, see Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 222 seq.</p>

 <p>According to Kâtyâyana VI, 6, 8 seq. a grass-blade is placed on the dead animal's body before the navel (agre<i>n</i>a nâbhim); through that grass-blade he cuts into the body and draws out the omentum.</p>  
 <p>'That fire' is, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, not the Sâmitra but the Aupâsana fire. In the same way in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual the warming of the omentum is performed at the Sâmitra, the boiling at the Âhavanîya fire. Kâtyâyana VI, 6, 13. 16.</p>
