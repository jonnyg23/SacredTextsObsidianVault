 <p>1. He should initiate a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, when he is eight years old, or in the eighth year after the conception,</p>  
 <p>2. Â<i>s</i>valâyana, when he is eleven years old,</p>

 <p>3. A Vai<i>s</i>ya, when he is twelve years old.</p>  
 <p>4. Or according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different families).</p>  
 <p>5. He should feed the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. And they lead him (i.e. the boy who is to be initiated) on, with his head shaven all round, and decked with ornaments.</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_765"></a><a href="#fn_764"><font size="1">6</font></a>. (The teacher) makes him place himself to the west of the fire and say, 'I have come hither for the sake of studentship (brahma<i>k</i>arya).' And, 'I will be a student (brahma<i>k</i>ârin).'</p>  
 <p>7. He then makes him put on a garment with (the verse), 'In the way in which B<i>ri</i>haspati put the garment of immortality on Indra, thus I put (this garment) on thee, for the sake of long life, of old age, of strength, of splendour.'</p>  
 <p>8 <a name="fr_766"></a><a href="#fn_765"><font size="1">8</font></a>. He ties round him the girdle with (the verse which the youth recites), 'Here has come to me, keeping away evil words, purifying my kind as a <a href="errata.htm#1">purifier</a>, clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, with strength, this sisterly goddess, this blessed girdle.'</p>  
 <p>9 <a name="fr_767"></a><a href="#fn_766"><font size="1">9</font></a>. Or, 'A youth, well attired, dressed, came hither. He, being born, becomes glorious. Wise sages extol him, devout ones, turning their minds to the gods.'</p>  
 <p>10. Or silently.</p>  
 <p>11. He gives him the staff.</p>

 <p>12. (The student) accepts it with (the verse), 'My staff which fell down to the ground in the open air, that I take up again for the sake of long life, of holiness, of holy lustre.'</p>  
 <p>13 <a name="fr_768"></a><a href="#fn_767"><font size="1">13</font></a>. According to some (teachers he accepts the staff) in the way prescribed for the inauguration, because it is said, 'He enters upon a long Sattra (or sacrificial period).'</p>  
 <p>14. (The teacher) then with his joined hands fills (the student's) joined hands with water with the three (verses), 'Ye waters are' (Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 50 seqq.).</p>  
 <p>15 <a name="fr_769"></a><a href="#fn_768"><font size="1">15</font></a>. He then makes him look at the sun with (the verse), 'That eye' (Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXXVI, 24).</p>  
 <p>16 <a name="fr_770"></a><a href="#fn_769"><font size="1">16</font></a>. He then touches his heart, (reaching) over his right shoulder, with (the words), 'Into my will I take thy heart, &amp;c.'</p>  
 <p>17 <a name="fr_771"></a><a href="#fn_770"><font size="1">17</font></a>. He then seizes (the student's) right hand and says, 'What is thy name?</p>  
 <p>18. He replies, 'I am N.N., sir!'</p>  
 <p>19. He then says to him, 'Whose pupil (brahma<i>k</i>ârin) art thou?'</p>  
 <p>20 <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_771"><font size="1">20</font></a>. After (the student) has said, 'Yours!'(the</p>

 <p>teacher replies,) 'Indra's pupil art thou; Agni is thy teacher; I am thy teacher, N.N.!'</p>  
 <p>21. He then gives him in charge to living beings with (the formulas), 'To Pra<i>g</i>âpati I give thee in charge. To the god Savit<i>ri</i> I give thee in charge. To the waters, the herbs I give thee in charge. To Heaven and Earth I give thee in charge. To the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs I give thee in charge. To all beings I give thee in charge for the sake of freedom from harm.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_765"></a><a href="sbe29175.htm#fr_766">304:8</a> The commentators differ as to whether the Â<i>k</i>ârya or the youth should recite the verse. The comparison of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 2, 1 would rather tend to show that it is the teacher, but Gobhila II, 10 says expressly: athaina<i>m</i> tri<i>h</i> pradakshi<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>amekhalâ<i>m</i> pariharan vâ<i>k</i>ayatîya<i>m</i> duruktât paribâdhamânety <i>ri</i>tasya goptrîti vâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_766"></a><a href="sbe29175.htm#fr_767">304:9</a> Rig-veda III, 8, 4. The verse is originally addressed to Agni.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_767"></a><a href="sbe29175.htm#fr_768">305:13</a> <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a XI, 3, 3, 2: 'He enters upon a long Sattra, who enters upon Brahma<i>k</i>arya.' The student, when being initiated, ought to behave, consequently, in the same way as those who receive the inauguration (dîkshâ) for a long Sattra. This is the meaning of this Sûtra. The rules regarding the staff handed over by the Adhvaryu to the Ya<i>g</i>amâna at the dîkshâ ceremony are given by Kâtyâyana, <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VII, 4, 1-4.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_771"></a><a href="sbe29175.htm#fr_772">305:20</a> The words 'I am thy teacher' are omitted in one of Professor Stenzler's MSS. and in his translation. But they are given in the parallel passage of the <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a. The <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a> parallel passage in <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana (G<i>ri</i>hya II, 3, 1) also runs thus: Agnir â<i>k</i>âryas tava, asâv, aha<i>m</i> <i>k</i>obhau.</p>
