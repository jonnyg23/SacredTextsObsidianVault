 <p>3. And having strewn sesamum into an uneven number of water-pots,</p>

 <p>8. While they are eating, he shall murmur the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, the Sâvitrî, the Madhuvâtîya-verses (Rig-veda I, 90, 6 seq.), and verses addressed to the Manes and to (Soma) Pavamâna.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_230"></a><a href="sbe29063.htm#fr_231">106:1</a> 1, 1. Kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>as 1-4 contain the rules regarding the <i>S</i>râddha oblations directed to the Manes. The dinners offered in connection with these <i>S</i>râddha sacrifices to Brâhma<i>n</i>as and alsothough of this of course no notice is taken in Vedic textsto <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as stood in the first line among the exhibitions of liberality of lay people towards priests and monks. Thus we find among the stock phrases that constantly reoccur in the Pâli Pi<i>t</i>akas, the mention of Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as 'who have eaten the food given to them out of faith' (saddhâdeyyâni bho<i>g</i>anâni bhu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>itvâ)wherein the 'food given out of faith' (saddhâdeyya) either chiefly or exclusively means the <i>S</i>râddha dinners, which are so called because the sacrificer gives them 'full of faith' (<i>s</i>raddhâsamanvita, Manu III, 275) to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and through them to the Manes.</p>  
 <p>The principal form of <i>S</i>râddha is that treated of in chap. 1, which is designated in other texts (see, for instance, Â<i>s</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 7, 1) as pârva<i>n</i>a <i>s</i>râddha. There are, however, besides the parvan of the new moon, other times also considered as admissible for the performing of this monthly <i>S</i>râddha; see Gautama XV, 2 seq.; Âpastamba II, 16, &amp;c.; and comp. on the <i>S</i>râddhas in general the passages quoted by Professor Jolly, Das Dharma-sûtra des Vish<i>n</i>u (Sitzung der Bair. Akademie, phil. Classe, 7 Juni, 1879), pp. 46 seq.; Max Müller, 'India, what can it teach us?' pp. 234 Seq., 374 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_231"></a><a href="sbe29063.htm#fr_232">106:2</a> '"As the fathers" means: he invites the youngest, middle-aged, and eldest Brâhma<i>n</i>as to sit down in the place of the father, the grandfather, and the great-grandfather' (Nârâya<i>n</i>a). A similar explanation of pit<i>ri</i>vat is mentioned by Nârâya<i>n</i>a on Â<i>s</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a> IV, 7, 2. My German translation of this Sûtra ought to be altered accordingly.</p>  
 <p>Besides the Brâhma<i>n</i>as mentioned in this Sûtra, who represent the fathers, according to all the commentaries, other Brâhma<i>n</i>as had to be invited as representing the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs. Nârâya<i>n</i>a gives detailed statements as to the number of the pait<i>ri</i>ka and of the daivika Brâhma<i>n</i>as to be invited, and though at first sight a European reader would rather be inclined to doubt whether at the <i>S</i>râddha ceremony, as the author of the text intended to describe it, any Brâhma<i>n</i>as at all had to be present except the pait<i>ri</i>kas, the Sûtra 2, 5 shows that the commentators are quite right in their statements regarding both categories of Brâhma<i>n</i>as.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_232"></a><a href="sbe29063.htm#fr_233">107:5-7</a> It would be more natural to alter the division of the Sûtras, so as to bring âmantrya in the fifth, anna<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a in the seventh Sûtra. In this case we should have to translate: 5. After this, having (respectfully) spoken to them who have been adorned (by him with flowers, ornaments, &amp;c.); 6. And having put (food) into the fire, 7. And having assigned the food to them, &amp;c., he shall cause them to eat.The respectful address mentioned in the fifth Sûtra consists, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, in the announcement, 'Ye Brâhma<i>n</i>as, I will put (food) into the fire!' (comp. Â<i>s</i>v.-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 7, 18), which he subsequently does with the formulas, 'To Agni Kavyavâhana svâhâ! To Soma Pit<i>ri</i>mat svâhâ! To Yama Aṅgirasvat Pit<i>ri</i>mat svâhâ!' Comp. Baudhâyana II, 1 4, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_233"></a><a href="sbe29063.htm#fr_234">108:9</a> As to the way in which the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as should he offered, Nârâya<i>n</i>a refers to the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (IV, 4).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_234"></a><a href="sbe29063.htm#fr_235">108:10-11</a> 10, 11. Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ân evidently belongs to the tenth Sûtra, not, as the Indian tradition takes it, to the eleventh. Between the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as of the fathers and those belonging to the mothers he puts, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, for instance, Darbha grass.</p>
