Or also, if he does not know the <i>Ri</i>shis, deities, and metres, the teacher recites this verse, 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' (Rig-veda III, 62, 10), pâda by pâda, hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop, and says, when he has finished, 'This (verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gâyatrî; Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra is its <i>Ri</i>shi).'</p>

On the Sukriya vrata which has to be undergone before the Anuva<i>k</i>ana treated of in this chapter can be performed, see the note on chap. 4, 1, and below, chap. II, 9. One would have expected that in the arrangement of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana the rites belonging to the Sukriya vrata would precede the exposition of the Anuva<i>k</i>ana. Perhaps it was in consequence of the exact analogy of the Sukriya with the <i>S</i>âkvara, Vrâtika, Aupanishada vratas, that the description of the former has been postponed till the latter had to be treated of.</p>  
 <p>Râma<i>k</i>andra's Paddhati has the following remark here, 'Now the way of studying the Veda, called Anuva<i>k</i>ana, is set forth. This can be done only after the Sukriya vrata has been enjoined on the student; before that nothing but the Sâvitrî can be taught to him.'</p>

Nârâya<i>n</i>a states, in accordance with these Sûtras of the fifth chapter, that in case the student belongs to the second or third caste, an Ûha (i.e. a corresponding alteration of the formulas; from the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra, VI, 1, 3 the definition is quoted here <i>s</i>abdavikâram ûha<i>m</i> bruvate) takes place. If he is a Kshatriya, he has to say, 'Recite the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, sir!''Recite the verse of Hira<i>n</i>yastûpa (Rig-veda I, 35, 2), sir!' A Vai<i>s</i>ya has to say, 'Recite the <i>G</i>agatî, sir!''Recite the verse of Hira<i>n</i>yastûpa (or, of Vâmadeva, Rig-veda I, 35, 9 or IV, 40, 5), sir!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_153"></a><a href="sbe29037.htm#fr_154">70:17</a> Comp. Indische Studien, X, 132, note 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_154"></a><a href="sbe29037.htm#fr_155">71:18-20</a> I do not think that Professor Weber (Indische Studien, X, 132) has quite exactly rendered the meaning of these Sûtras when he says, 'The teacher then (i.e. after the formula of Sûtra 17 has been pronounced) teaches him first the <i>Ri</i>shi, the deity, and the metre of each Mantra. In case he does not know them himself for a Mantra, he recites the holy Sâvitrî (tat Savitur vare<i>n</i>yam). After this he teaches him in due order either (1) the single <i>Ri</i>shis, i.e. the hymns belonging to each <i>Ri</i>shi, or (2) the single Anuvâkas,' &amp;C.It does not seem quite probable to me that the student should have had to learn first the <i>Ri</i>shis, deities, and metres of the whole Veda, before the text of the hymns was taught him; I rather believe that hymn by hymn the indication of the <i>Ri</i>shis, &amp;c. preceded the anuva<i>k</i>ana of the text itself, and with this opinion the statement of Nârâya<i>n</i>a agrees, 'Eva<i>m</i> pûrvoktena prakâre<i>n</i>a <i>ri</i>shidevatâ<i>kh</i>anda<i>h</i>pûrvaka<i>m</i> ta<i>m</i> ta<i>m</i> Agnim î<i>l</i>a ityâdika<i>m</i> mantra<i>m</i> mâ<i>n</i>avakâyâ<i>k</i>âryo<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nubrûyât.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_155"></a><a href="sbe29037.htm#fr_156">71:19</a> According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a by esheti (literally, 'This [is the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>]') it is meant that the teacher, after having recited the Sâvitrî in the three ways mentioned, should say to the student, 'This <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> is in the Gâyatrî metre. If recited pâda by pâda, it has three pâdas. Thus also this <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, if recited hemistich by hemistich, has two Avasânas (pauses), the first at the end of the hemistich, the second at the end of the third <i>k</i>arma (or pâda). Thus also this <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> is recited without stopping; at the end of the three <i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>as, or of the twenty-four syllables, the pause (avasâna) should be made. Thus I recite to thee the Sâvitrî; I recite to thee the Gâyatrî; I recite to thee the verse of Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra.' 'For,' adds Nârâya<i>n</i>a, 'if the Gâyatrî has been recited, the whole complex of the Veda being of that very <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a> substance, a complete knowledge thereof has been produced.' The commentator then indicates a shorter form for the teacher's words which our Sûtra prescribes by esheti, 'This verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gâyatrî; its <i>Ri</i>shi is Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_156"></a><a href="sbe29037.htm#fr_157">72:21</a> The Kshudrasûktas are the hymns Rig-veda X, 129-191.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_157"></a><a href="sbe29037.htm#fr_158">72:24</a> 24 seq. This seems to be an abridged method by which students who had not the intention of becoming Vedic scholars, and probably chiefly students of the Kshatriya and Vai<i>s</i>ya caste, could fulfil their duty of learning the Veda; a student who knew the first and last hymn of a <i>Ri</i>shi, or of an Anuvâka, was, as would seem from these Sûtras, by a sort of fiction considered as though he had known the whole portion belonging to that <i>Ri</i>shi, or the whole Anuvâka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_158"></a><a href="sbe29037.htm#fr_159">72:27</a> Nârâya<i>n</i>a explains <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya by mantrasa<i>m</i>hitâ. He says, The Anuvâ<i>k</i>ana which has been declared here, is to be understood also with regard to the svâdhyâya, i.e. to the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ of the Mantras.' I think there is a blunder in the MS., and instead of tad api svâdhyâye . . . <i>g</i><i>ñ</i>eya<i>m</i> we ought to read tad <i>ri</i>shisvâdhyâye . . . <i>g</i><i>ñ</i>eya<i>m</i>. In this case we should have to translate the quoted passage, '. . . is to be understood with regard to the <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya, i.e. to, &amp;c.'I think, however, that the true meaning of the Sûtra is different from what Nârâya<i>n</i>a believes it to be. The expression vyâkhyâtam apparently conveys a reference to another treatise in which the rules regarding the <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya would seem to have been fully set forth. The <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra contains <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a> no passage which could be the one here referred to; we may suppose, therefore, that either a chapter of a Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya is quoted here, or a separate treatise on the special subject of the <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya. References to such treatises are found in the Sûtra texts in several instances, of which the most important is that in the Gobhila-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 5, 13, 'On what day the moon becomes full, the knowledge thereof is contained in a special text; that one either should study or ascertain when the Parvan is from those who have studied it.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_159"></a><a href="sbe29037.htm#fr_160">73:28</a> Nârâya<i>n</i>a: 'First stand the Mantras, then the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, because it contains the viniyoga (the ritual use of the Mantras), then the Sm<i>ri</i>ti texts such as Manu, &amp;c. When he has repeated these texts to the student, after the end of the Anuvâ<i>k</i>ana, the teacher should take from the student the Ku<i>s</i>a blades which had been taken up before for the sake of the Anuvâ<i>k</i>ana (see Sûtras 5 seq.),' &amp;c.The teacher is made the subject of this rule also by Râma<i>k</i>andra. On yathâsûktam Nârâya<i>n</i>a observes that according to some teachers these water oblations were directed to the <i>Ri</i>shis of the different hymns (<i>ri</i>shîn uddi<i>s</i>yeti ke<i>k</i>it). This statement seems to be countenanced by IV, 6, 6. Comp. the note below on IV, 9, 1.</p>
