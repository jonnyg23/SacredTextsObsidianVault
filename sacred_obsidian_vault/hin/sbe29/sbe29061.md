 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="sbe29061.htm#fr_226">103:1</a> 13, 1. On madhyâvarsha, comp. Weber, loc. cit., pp. 331, 337. Nârâya<i>n</i>a understands not 'in the middle of the rainy season,' but 'in the middle of the year' (see his note, p. 146 of the German edition). I cannot help thinking that the word madhyâvarshe, given by the MSS. here and in Pâraskara III, 3, 13, and explained by Nârâya<i>n</i>a, is a corrupt reading which we should correct into mâghyavarshe ('the festival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakshatra Maghâs'), or something like that. The MSS. of Â<i>s</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 5, 9 have mâghyâvarsha<i>m</i>, mâghâvarsha<i>m</i>, mâdhyâvarsha<i>m</i>. Vish<i>n</i>u (LXXVI, 1, comp. LXXVIII, 52, and Professor Jolly's note, Sacred Books of the East, VII, p. 240) mentions 'the three Ash<i>t</i>akâs, the three Anvash<i>t</i>akâs, a Mâgha day which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month Praush<i>th</i>apada.' Comp. Manu III, 273, varshâsu <i>k</i>a maghâsu <i>k</i>a; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 260.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="sbe29061.htm#fr_227">104:5</a> Instead of 'N.N.' (the text has the feminine amushyai) the sacrificer inserts the name of his mother. For mâsâs, ardhamâsâs I propose to read, mâsais, ardhamâsais.</p>
