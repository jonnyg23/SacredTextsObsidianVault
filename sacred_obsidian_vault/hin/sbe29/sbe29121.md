 <p>1. Having tied the girdle round him and given him the staff, he should impose the (observances of the) Brahma<i>k</i>arya on him</p>  
 <p>2. (With the words), 'A Brahma<i>k</i>ârin thou art. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Devoted to the teacher study the Veda.'</p>  
 <p>3. Twelve years lasts the Brahma<i>k</i>arya for (each) Veda, or until he has learnt it.</p>  
 <p>4. Let him beg (food) in the evening and in the morning.</p>  
 <p>5. Let him put fuel on (the fire) in the evening and in the morning.</p>  
 <p>6. Let him beg first of a man who will not refuse,</p>  
 <p>7. Or of a woman who will not refuse.</p>  
 <p>8. (In begging he should use the words), 'Sir, give food!'</p>  
 <p>9 <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">9</font></a>. Or, '(Sir, give) Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya (food).'</p>  
 <p>10 <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">10</font></a>. That (which he has received) he should announce to his teacher.</p>  
 <p>11. He should stand the rest of the day.</p>  
 <p>12 <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">12</font></a>. After sunset (the student) should cook the Brâhmaudana (or boiled rice with which the Brâhma<i>n</i>as are to be fed) for the Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya sacrifice (the sacrifice to be performed after a part of the Veda has been studied), and should announce to the teacher (that it is ready).</p>

 <p>13. The teacher should sacrifice, while the student takes hold of him, with the verse, 'The wonderful lord of the abode' (Rig-Veda I, 18, 6).</p>  
 <p>14. A second time with the Sâvitrî</p>  
 <p>15 <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">15</font></a>. And whatever else has been studied afterwards.</p>  
 <p>16. A third time to the <i>Ri</i>shis.</p>  
 <p>17. A fourth time (the oblation) to (Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.</p>  
 <p>18 <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">18</font></a>. Having given food to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as he should cause them to pronounce the end of the Veda (study).</p>  
 <p>19. From that time (the student) should eat no saline food; he should observe chastity, and should sleep on the ground through three nights, or twelve nights, or one year.</p>  
 <p>20 <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">20</font></a>. When he has fulfilled those observances, (the teacher) performs (for him) the 'production of intelligence,' (in the following way):</p>  
 <p>21 <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">21</font></a>. While (the student) towards an unobjectionable direction (of the horizon) sprinkles thrice (water) from the left to the right with a water-pot round a</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Palâ<i>s</i>a (tree) with one root, or round a Ku<i>s</i>a bunch, if there is no Palâ<i>s</i>a, (the teacher) causes him to say, 'O glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou, O glorious one, art glorious, thus, O glorious one, lead me to glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of the Veda for men.'</p>  
 <p>22 <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">22</font></a>. Thereby, beginning with his having the hair cut, and ending with the giving in charge, the imposing of observances has been declared.</p>  
 <p>23. Thus for one who has not been initiated before.</p>  
 <p>24. Now as regards one who has been initiated before:</p>  
 <p>25 <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">25</font></a>. The cutting of the hair is optional,</p>  
 <p>26 <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">26</font></a>. And the 'production of intelligence.'</p>  
 <p>27 <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">27</font></a>. On the giving in charge there are no express rules (in this case);</p>  
 <p>28 <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">28</font></a>. And on the time.</p>  
 <p>29 <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">29</font></a>. (He should recite to him) as the Sâvitrî (the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>),'That we choose of god Savit<i>ri</i>' (Rig-veda V, 82, 1).</p>
