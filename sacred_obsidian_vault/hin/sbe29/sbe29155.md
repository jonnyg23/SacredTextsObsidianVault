It seems to me that Professor Stenzler is not quite right in giving to the opening words of the text athâta<i>h</i>, which he translates 'nun also,' the explanation: 'das heisst, nach Beendigung des <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra von Kâtyâyana.' I think rather it can be shown that ata<i>h</i> does not contain a reference to something preceding; thus the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra, which forms the first part of the whole Sûtra collection, is opened in the same way by the words athâto<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>dhikâra<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_663"></a><a href="sbe29155.htm#fr_664">269:2</a> The description of the standard form of domestic sacrifice opens with an enumeration of the five so-called bhûsa<i>m</i>skâra (parisamuhya, &amp;c.). On the samûhana (for parisamuhya is derived <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a> from the root ûh, not from vah; comp. below, II, 4, 2: pâ<i>n</i>inâgnim parisamûhati), see <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 7, 11; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha-pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>a I, 37, &amp;c. On the lines drawn on the sacrificial surface, see <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 7, 6 seq.; Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 3, 1; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha-pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>a I, 47 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_664"></a><a href="sbe29155.htm#fr_665">270:4</a> Pûrvavat ('as above') can possibly, as Professor Stenzler understands it, have been said with regard to Kâtyâyana's rule, II, 3, 33: Tâbhyâm (scil. pavitrâbhyâm) utpunâti Savitur va iti. But it is also possible that the expression may refer to the second Sûtra of this chapter, where it is said, proksha<i>n</i>î<i>h</i> sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>tya. On upayamanân ku<i>s</i>ân, comp. Kâtyâyana I, 10, 6-8.</p>
