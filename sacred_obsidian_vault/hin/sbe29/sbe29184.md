 <p>2. If one has partaken of a <i>S</i>râddha dinner, if a meteor falls, or distant thundering is heard, or if the earth quakes, or if fiery apparitions are seen, and when a new season begins, (the study shall be interrupted) until the same time next day.</p>

 <p>if clouds appear, . . . ., (it shall be interrupted) through a period of three nights or till twilight has thrice passed.</p>

 <p>5. While running, while seeing a person of bad fame or who has lost his caste, if a miraculous or happy event happens, as long as (that which occasions the interruption of study) endures.</p>  
 <p>6. If hoar-frost (lies on the ground), if a musical instrument is heard, or the cry of a person in pain, at the border of the village, in a burial ground, or if a dog, an ass, an owl, a jackal, or a Sâman song is heard, or if a learned person approaches, as long as (that occasion) endures.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_827"></a><a href="sbe29184.htm#fr_828">323:1</a> 11, 1. 'Entire interruption' means, according to the commentators, that not only the study of the Veda itself, but also that of the Vedâṅgas, or even all sorts of worldly instruction are forbidden.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_828"></a><a href="sbe29184.htm#fr_829">323:3</a> I have left the words sarvarûpe <i>k</i>a untranslated. Evidently <a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a> sarvarûpa is identical with the doubtful word <i>s</i>avarûpa which twice occurs in the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya. See the discussion on that word in the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 12, 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_829"></a><a href="sbe29184.htm#fr_830">324:4</a> On antardivâkîrtye, comp. Manu V, 85. Gautama XVI, 19.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_830"></a><a href="sbe29184.htm#fr_831">324:8</a> The Tânûnaptra is an invocation directed to Tanûnapt<i>ri</i> (i.e. the wind) by which the officiating priests and the Ya<i>g</i>amâna at a Soma sacrifice pledge their faith to do no harm to each other. See Indische Studien, X, 362.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_831"></a><a href="sbe29184.htm#fr_832">325:12</a> The reading of the Mantra is doubtful. I think it should stand as Professor Stenzler has printed it, except that I should propose to correct yuvâ into yuvânâ (comp. Â<i>s</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>rauta VI, 12, 12). It is probable that the gods addressed are the two A<i>s</i>vins, who are called kavî and yuvânâ in several passages of the Vedas.</p>
