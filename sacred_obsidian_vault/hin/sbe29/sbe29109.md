 <p>1. Now the oblations of cooked food on the (two) Parvan (i.e. the new and full moon) days.</p>  
 <p>2. The fasting (which takes place) thereat has been declared by (the corresponding rules regarding) the Dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>n</i>amâsa sacrifices.</p>

 <p>3 <a name="fr_409"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And (so has been declared) the binding together of the fuel and of the Barhis,</p>  
 <p>4 <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">4</font></a>. And the deities (to whom those oblations belong), with the exception of the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>uyâ<i>g</i>a (offerings at which the formulas are repeated with low voice), and of Indra and Mahendra.</p>  
 <p>5. Other deities (may be worshipped) according to the wishes (which the sacrificer connects with his offerings).</p>  
 <p>6. For each single deity he pours out four handsful (of rice, barley, &amp;c.), placing two purifiers (i.e. Ku<i>s</i>a blades, on the vessel), with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out.'</p>  
 <p>7. He then sprinkles them (those four portions of Havis with water) in the same way as he had poured them out, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.'</p>  
 <p>8. When (the rice or barley grains) have been husked and cleansed from the husks three times, let him cook (the four portions) separately,</p>  
 <p>9. Or throwing (them) together.</p>  
 <p>10. If he cooks them separately, let him touch the grains, after he has separated them, (and say,) 'This to this god; this to this god.'</p>  
 <p>11. But if he (cooks the portions) throwing (them) together, he should (touch and) sacrifice them, after he has put (the single portions) into different vessels.</p>  
 <p>12 <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">12</font></a>. The portions of sacrificial food, when they</p>

 <p>have been cooked, he sprinkles (with Â<i>g</i>ya, takes them from the fire towards the north, places them on the Barhis, and sprinkles the fuel with Â<i>g</i>ya with the formula, 'This fuel is thy self, <i>G</i>âtavedas; thereby burn thou and increase, and, O burning One, make us increase and through offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and nourishment make us prosper. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>13 <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">13</font></a>. Having silently poured out the two Âghâras (or Â<i>g</i>ya oblations poured out with the Sruva, the one from north-west to south-east, the other from south-west to north-east), he should sacrifice the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions with (the formulas), 'To Agni svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>14 <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">14</font></a>. The northern one belonging to Agni, the southern one to Soma.</p>  
 <p>15 <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">15</font></a>. It is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti), The two eyes indeed of the sacrifice are the Â<i>g</i>ya portions,</p>  
 <p>16 <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">16</font></a>. 'Therefore of a man who is sitting with his face to the west the southern (i.e. right) eye is northern, the northern (i.e. left) eye is southern.'</p>  
 <p>17 <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">17</font></a>. In the middle (of the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions he</p>

 <p>sacrifices the other) Havis, or more to the west, finishing (the oblations) in the east or in the north.</p>  
 <p>18. To the north-east the oblation to (Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.</p>  
 <p>19 <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">19-20</font></a>. He cuts off (the Avadâna portions) from the Havis from the middle and from the eastern part;</p>  
 <p>20. From the middle, the eastern part and the western part (the portions have to be cut off) by those who make five Avadânas;</p>  
 <p>21. From the northern side the portion for Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.</p>  
 <p>22 <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">22</font></a>. Here he omits the second pouring (of Â<i>g</i>ya) over (what is left of) the sacrificial food.</p>  
 <p>23 <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">23</font></a>. 'What I have done too much in this ceremony, or what I have done here too little, all that may Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, he who knows it, make well sacrificed and well offered for me. To Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, to him who offers the oblations for general expiation, so that they are well offered, to him who makes us succeed in what we desire! Make us in all that we desire successful! Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>24 <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">24</font></a>. He pours out the full vessel on the Barhis.</p>  
 <p>25 <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">25</font></a>. This is the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha.</p>
