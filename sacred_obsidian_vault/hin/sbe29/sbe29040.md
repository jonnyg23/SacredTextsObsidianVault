 <p>2. Every day in the evening and in the morning,</p>  
 <p>3. He establishes the fire (in its proper place), wipes (with his hand the ground) round (it), sprinkles (water) round (it), bends his right knee,</p>  
 <p>4 <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">4</font></a>. (And puts fuel on the fire with the texts,) 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great <i>G</i>âtavedas; may he, <i>G</i>âtavedas, give faith and insight to me. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'Firewood art thou; may we prosper. Fuel art thou; splendour art thou; put splendour into me. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'Being inflamed make me prosperous in offspring and wealth. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>Thine is this fuel, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And may we grow and gain vigour. Svâhâ!'</p>

 <p>5. Having then sprinkled (water) round (the fire),</p>  
 <p>6. He approaches the fire with the verse, 'May Agni (vouchsafe) to me faith and insight, not-forgetting (what I have learned) and memory; may this praiseful <i>G</i>âtavedas give blessing to us.'</p>  
 <p>[7 <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">7</font></a>. He makes with ashes the tripu<i>n</i><i>dh</i>ra sign (the sign of three strokes) which is set forth in the (treatise on the) Saupar<i>n</i>avrata, which is revealed, which agrees with the tradition handed down by the ancients, with the five formulas 'The threefold age' (see above, I, 28, 9), one by one, on five (places), viz. the forehead, the heart, the right shoulder and the left, and then on the back.]</p>  
 <p>8. He who approaches the fire after having sacrificed thus, studies of these Vedas, one, two, three, or all.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="sbe29040.htm#fr_167">75:4</a> Nârâya<i>n</i>a: samidham iti mantraliṅgât samidhâ<i>m</i> homa<i>h</i>, mantrap<i>ri</i>thaktvât karmap<i>ri</i>thaktvam iti nyâyât.</p>  
 <p>In the Atharva-veda XIX, 64, 1 the MSS. have Agne samidham âhârsham. Professors Roth and Whitney have conjectured in this passage agre instead of Agne. It is shown by our passage and the corresponding ones in the other Sûtras that the true reading is Agnaye. Instead of ahârsham we should read âhârsham, as all the parallel texts have. In the passage 'Firewood art thou; might we prosper,' there is a play upon words untranslatable in English, 'edho<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>sy edhishîmahi.' Perhaps instead of samiddho mâ<i>m</i> samardhaya we should read sam<i>ri</i>ddho mâ<i>m</i> samardhaya. As the Mantra referred to the Samidh-offering, sam<i>ri</i>ddha could very easily be supplanted by the participle of sam-idh. In the parallel texts indicated p. 139 of the German edition it should be, Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 14 a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_167"></a><a href="sbe29040.htm#fr_168">76:7</a> This Sûtra is wanting in one of the Haug MSS. and in the <i>S</i>âmbavya MS.; Râma<i>k</i>andra's Paddhati takes no notice of it. I take it for a later addition. It should be noticed that the words dakshi<i>n</i>askandhe . . . <i>k</i>a pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>asu form a half <i>S</i>loka.</p>
