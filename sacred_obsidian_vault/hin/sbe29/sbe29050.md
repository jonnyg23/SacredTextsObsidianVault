 <p>1 <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">1</font></a>. If he wishes to have a house built, he draws with an Udumbara branch three times a line round (the building-ground) with (the words), 'Here I include the dwellings for the sake of food,' and sacrifices in (its) centre on an elevated spot,</p>  
 <p>2. (With the texts,) 'Who art thou? Whose art</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 93</font></a></p>  
 <p>thou? To whom do I sacrifice thee, desirous of (dwelling in the) village? Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'Thou art the gods' share on this (earth). From here have sprung the fathers who have passed away. The ruler has sacrificed, desirous of (dwelling in the) village, not omitting anything that belongs to the gods. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>3. Having had the pits for the posts dug,</p>  
 <p>4. He pours water-gruel into them,</p>  
 <p>5. And with (the verse), 'This branch of the immortal one I erect, a stream of honey, promoting wealth. The child, the young one, cries to it; the cow shall low to it, the unceasingly fertile one'he puts an Udumbara branch which has been besmeared with ghee into the pit for the right door-post.</p>  
 <p>6. 'This branch of the world I establish, a stream of honey, promoting wealth. The child, the young one, cries to it; the cow shall low to it that has a young calf'thus to the left.</p>  
 <p>7. In the same way at the two (pits) to the south, to the west, and to the north.</p>  
 <p>8. With (the verse), 'This branch of this tree, that drops ghee, I erect in the immortal. The child, the young one, cries to it; cows shall flock to it, unceasingly fertile ones'he erects the chief post.</p>  
 <p>9 <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">9</font></a>. 'May the young child come to it, may the calf . . . .; may they come to it with a cup of Parisrut, with pots of curds.</p>

The words bhuvanas pari give no sense; Pâraskara probably gives the true reading, â vatso <i>g</i>agadai<i>h</i> saha (III, 4, 4; comp. Sûtra 8: Vasû<i>m</i><i>s</i> <i>k</i>a Rudrân Âdityân Î<i>s</i>âna<i>m</i> <i>g</i>agadai<i>h</i> saha; <i>g</i>agada is explained in <i>G</i>ayarâma's commentary by anuga, anu<i>k</i>ara). The word <i>g</i>agada of course was exposed to all sorts of corruptions; <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a> thus the text of Â<i>s</i>valâyana has <i>g</i>âyatâ<i>m</i> saka; the Atharva-veda (III, 12, 7) <i>g</i>agatâ saha; and from this <i>g</i>agat to the bhuvana found in our text the way is not very long.</p>
