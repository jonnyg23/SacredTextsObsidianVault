 <p><a name="fn_430"></a><a href="sbe29111.htm#fr_431">178:1</a> 12, 1. There seems to be no doubt that Professor Stenzler is right in giving to <i>k</i>aitya in this chapter its ordinary meaning of religious shrine ('Denkmal'). The text shows that the Kaitya sacrifice was not offered like other sacrifices at the sacrificer's home, but that in some cases the offering would have to be sent, at least symbolically, to distant places. This confirms Professor Stenzler's translation of <i>k</i>aitya. Nârâya<i>n</i>a  explains <i>k</i>aitya by <i>k</i>itte bhava, and says, 'If he makes a vow to a certain deity, saying, "If I obtain such and such a desire, I shall offer to thee an Â<i>g</i>ya sacrifice, or a Sthâlîpâka, or an animal"and if he then obtains what he had wished for and 'performs that sacrifice to that deity: this is a <i>k</i>aitya sacrifice.' I do not know anything that supports this statement as to the meaning of <i>k</i>aitya.</p>

 <p>It is not clear whether besides this image of a messenger there was also a real messenger who had to carry the Bali to the <i>K</i>aitya, <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a> or whether the whole rite was purely symbolical, and based on the principle: In sacris ficta pro veris accipiuntur.</p>
