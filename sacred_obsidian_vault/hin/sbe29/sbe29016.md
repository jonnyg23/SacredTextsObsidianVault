 <p>upon the stone, (are repeated) in the same way for a second time,</p>

 <p><a name="fn_81"></a><a href="sbe29016.htm#fr_82">37:2</a> 14, 2. The treading on the stone is prescribed in chap. 13, 12.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_82"></a><a href="sbe29016.htm#fr_83">38:5</a> 5, 7. According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a it is the teacher who makes them walk the seven steps; the Paddhati says that the bridegroom or the Â<i>k</i>ârya causes her to do so. Comp. Pâraskara I, 8, 1; Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 7, 19, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_83"></a><a href="sbe29016.htm#fr_84">38:8</a> Comp. chap. 13, 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_84"></a><a href="sbe29016.htm#fr_85">38:9</a> Probably we should read mûrdhanî (acc. dual.), not mûrdhani. Â<i>s</i>valâyana has <i>s</i>irasî. Of course the heads of both the bridegroom and the bride were sprinkled with water; comp. Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 7, 20, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_85"></a><a href="sbe29016.htm#fr_86">38:12</a> The Sûryâ hymn is Rig-veda X, 85. Comp. the note above on chap. 13, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_86"></a><a href="sbe29016.htm#fr_87">39:13-15</a> These Sûtras, treating of the fee for the sacrifice, are identical with Pâraskara I, 8, 15-18. Apparently they are taken from the same lost original from which several identical passages in the Sûtras of Pâraskara and <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana seem to be derived (see the notes on chap. 5, 1; 13, 7). They stand rather out of place here, for they return to the same subject which had already been treated of in Sûtra 10, though in that Sûtra, as very frequently is the case in our text and in similar ones, only the case of the bridegroom being a Brâhma<i>n</i>a has been taken notice of.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_87"></a><a href="sbe29016.htm#fr_88">39:16</a> Comp. the passages quoted by Professor Stenzler on Pâraskara I, 8, 18. Nârâya<i>n</i>a has the following note: 'To a duhit<i>ri</i>mat, i.e. to the father of a girl who has no brother, he shall give a hundred cows and besides a chariot, in order to destroy the guilt brought about by marrying a girl who has no brother.' Possibly we should here emancipate ourselves from the authority of the commentators, and explain duhit<i>ri</i>mat 'he who gives his daughter in marriage,' the bride's father. Comp. Âpastamba II, 11, 18; II, 13, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, V, 343, note 2.</p>
