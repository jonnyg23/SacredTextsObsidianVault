 <p>5. Three for the fathers, one for the (newly) dead person,</p>  
 <p>6. And pours the pot that belongs to the (newly) dead person out into the pots of the fathers with the two verses, 'They who commonly' (Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi Sa<i>m</i>hitâ XIX, 45. 46).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_240"></a><a href="sbe29065.htm#fr_241">109:1</a> 3, 1. It appears to me that this whole chapter is a later addition to the original text. The last Sûtra of the preceding chapter, treating of the omission of the fourth 'father,' which forms, as shown in the preceding note, a consequence of the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>îkara<i>n</i>a, <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 110</font></a> supposes this ceremony to be known and to require no special explanation. Had the intention of the author been to treat of the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>îkara<i>n</i>a, this would have been the right place for mentioning the <i>k</i>aturthavisarga, and not, as we really read it, the end of the chapter treating of the Ekoddish<i>t</i>a. As pointing in the same direction I will mention that the <i>S</i>âmbavya-G<i>ri</i>hya, while giving the first, second, and fourth chapter of this Adhyâya, omits the third. Finally it seems decisive to me that the fifth (Pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>a) book of the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya treats of the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>îkara<i>n</i>a in a whole chapter (V, 9), which shows that the text itself, as the author of the Pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>a read it, gave no exposition of this ceremony.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_241"></a><a href="sbe29065.htm#fr_242">110:2</a> Nârâya<i>n</i>a says that tripaksha means either three pakshas, i.e. one month and a half, or one paksha deficient by three days, i.e. twelve days. We need not say that the latter explanation is inadmissible it evidently rests on a wrong conclusion drawn from a passage of another Sûtra quoted by him, in which it is stated that the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>îkara<i>n</i>a should be performed sa<i>m</i>vatsarânte dvâda<i>s</i>âhe vâ.</p>
