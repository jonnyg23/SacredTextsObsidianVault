 <p>1 <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (Now will be declared) the making water round about a servant who is disposed to run away.</p>  
 <p>2. While (the servant) is sleeping, he should discharge his urine into the horn of a living animal, and should three times walk round him, turning his left side towards him, and sprinkle (the urine) round him,</p>

 <p><a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a></p>  
 <p>with (the verse), 'From the mountain (on which thou art born), from thy mother, from thy sister, from thy parents and thy brothers, from thy friends I sever thee.</p>  
 <p>'Run-away servant, I have made water round thee. Having been watered round, where wilt thou go?'</p>  
 <p>3 <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">7_3</font></a>. Should he run away (nevertheless, his master) should establish a fire that has been taken from a wood that is on fire, and should sacrifice (in that fire) Ku<i>s</i>a plates (used for protecting the hands when holding a hot sacrificial pan) that have been anointed with ghee, with (the formula), 'May the stumbler stumble round thee, . . . . may he tie thee with Indra's fetter, loosen thee for me, and may he lead another one up (to me).'</p>  
 <p>4 <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Then he will quietly remain (in his master's house).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_893"></a><a href="sbe29197.htm#fr_894">350:1</a> 7, 1. Utûla-parimeha<i>h</i>. It is probable that utûla, as meaning a slave who habitually runs away, is connected with the use of that word as the name of a tribe in the north-west of India.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_894"></a><a href="sbe29197.htm#fr_895">351:7_3</a> Ukhâ yâbhyâ<i>m</i> g<i>ri</i>hyate tâv i<i>n</i><i>d</i>vau. Comm. on Kâtyâyana, <i>S</i>raut. XVI, 4, 2.</p>  
 <p>In the Mantra I propose to read, pari tvâ hvalano, &amp;c. Niv<i>ri</i>ttendravîrudha<i>h</i> seems to be corrupt; it seems to be a compound of niv<i>ri</i>tta, a second member which is doubtful, and vîrudh (the plant). The meaning may have been 'giving it up to consume the plants.'</p>
