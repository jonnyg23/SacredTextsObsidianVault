This Sûtra in my opinion should be understood as a supplementary addition to that chapter. Nârâya<i>n</i>a refers the rule here given to the case of any incident or danger (âpad) which prevents the sacrificer from performing the ceremony in its fuller form, as prescribed in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra.</p>
