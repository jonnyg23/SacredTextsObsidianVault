 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="../../img/tn_hin.jpg"></a><br><i>The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)</i>, by Max Müller, [1879], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p>1. Verily he who knows the babe <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">3</font></a> with his place <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">4</font></a>, his chamber <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">5</font></a>, his post <a name="fr_331"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and his rope <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">7</font></a>, he keeps off the seven relatives <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">8</font></a> who hate him. Verily by the young is meant the inner life, by his place this (body) <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">9</font></a>, by his chamber this (head), by his post the vital breath, by his rope the food.</p>  
 <p>2. Then the seven imperishable ones <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">10</font></a> approach him. There are the red lines in the eye, and by them Rudra clings to him. There is the water</p>

 <p>in the eye, and by it Par<i>g</i>anya clings to him. There is the pupil, and by it Âditya (sun) clings to him, There is the dark iris, and by it Agni clings to him. There is the white eye-ball, and by it Indra, clings to him. With the lower eye-lash the earth, with the upper eye-lash the heaven clings to him. He who knows this, his food does never perish.</p>  
 <p>3. On this there is this <i>S</i>loka:</p>  
 <p>'There <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">1</font></a> is a cup having its mouth below and its bottom above. Manifold glory has been placed into it. On its lip sit the seven <i>Ri</i>shis, the tongue as the eighth communicates with Brahman.' What is called the cup having its mouth below and its bottom above is this head, for its mouth (the mouth) is below, its bottom (the skull) is above. When it is said that manifold glory has been placed into it, the senses verily are manifold glory, and he therefore means the senses. When he says that the seven <i>Ri</i>shis sit on its lip, the <i>Ri</i>shis are verily the (active) senses, and he means the senses. And when he says that the tongue as the eighth communicates with Brahman, it is because the tongue, as the eighth, does communicate with Brahman.</p>  
 <p>4. These two (the two ears) are the <i>Ri</i>shis Gautama and Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a; the right Gautama, the left Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a. These two (the eyes) are the <i>Ri</i>shis Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra and <i>G</i>amadagni; the right Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra, the left <i>G</i>amadagni. These two (the nostrils) are the <i>Ri</i>shis Vasish<i>th</i>a and Ka<i>s</i>yapa; the right Vasish<i>th</i>a, the left Ka<i>s</i>yapa. The tongue is Atri, for with the tongue food is eaten, and Atri is meant for Atti, eating. He who knows this, becomes an eater of everything, and everything becomes his food.</p>
