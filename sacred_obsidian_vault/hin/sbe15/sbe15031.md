 <p><a name="fn_210"></a><a href="sbe15031.htm#fr_210">52:1</a> This verse has been translated as the commentator wishes it to be understood, in praise of that knowledge of Self which is only to be obtained after all other duties, and, more particularly, the study of the Veda, have been performed. The text is probably corrupt, and the interpretation fanciful.</p>
