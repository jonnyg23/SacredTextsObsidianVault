 <p>1. Then <i>G</i>âratkârava Ârtabhâga <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">2</font></a> asked. 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya,' he said, 'how many Grahas are there, and how many Atigrahas <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">3</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>'Eight Grahas,' he replied,' and eight Atigrahas.'</p>  
 <p>'And what are these eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas?'</p>  
 <p>2. 'Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath) is one Graha, and that is seized by Apâna (down-breathing) as the Atigrâha <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">4</font></a>, for one smells with the Apâna.'</p>  
 <p>3. 'Speech (vâ<i>k</i>) is one Graha, and that is seized by name (nâman) as the Atigrâha, for with speech one pronounces names.</p>  
 <p>4. 'The tongue is one Graha, and that is seized by taste as the Atigrâha, for with the tongue one perceives tastes.'</p>  
 <p>5. 'The eye is one Graha, and that is seized by form as the Atigrâha, for with the eye one sees forms.'</p>  
 <p>6. 'The ear is one Graha, and that is seized by sound as the Atigrâha, for with the ear one hears sounds.'</p>  
 <p>7. 'The mind is one Graha, and that is seized by</p>

 <p>desire as the Atigrâha, for with the mind one desires desires.'</p>  
 <p>8. 'The arms are one Graha, and these are seized by work as the Atigrâha, for with the arms one works work.'</p>  
 <p>9. 'The skin is one Graha, and that is seized by touch as the Atigrâha, for with the skin one perceives touch. These are the eight Grahas and the eight Atigrahas.'</p>  
 <p>10. 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya,' he said, 'everything is the food of death. What then is the deity to whom death is food?'</p>  
 <p>'Fire (agni) is death, and that is the food of water. Death is conquered again.'</p>  
 <p>11. 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya,' he said, 'when such a person (a sage) dies, do the vital breaths (prâ<i>n</i>as) move out of him or no?'</p>  
 <p>'No,' replied Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya; 'they are gathered up in him, he swells, he is inflated, and thus inflated the dead lies at rest.'</p>  
 <p>12. 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya,' he said, 'when such a man dies, what does not leave him?'</p>  
 <p>'The name,' he replied; 'for the name is endless, the Vi<i>s</i>vedevas are endless, and by it he gains the endless world.'</p>  
 <p>13. 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya,' he said,' when the speech of this dead person enters into the fire <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">1</font></a>, breath into the air, the eye into the sun, the mind into the moon, the hearing into space, into the earth the body, into the ether the self, into the shrubs the hairs of the body, into the trees the hairs of the head, when the</p>

 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Take my hand, my friend. We two alone shall know of this; let this question of ours not be (discussed) in public.' Then these two went out and argued, and what they said was karman (work), what they praised was karman <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">1</font></a>, viz. that a man becomes good by good work, and bad by bad work. After that <i>G</i>âratkârava Ârtabhâga held his peace.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_393"></a><a href="sbe15065.htm#fr_393">125:3</a> Graha is probably meant originally in its usual sacrificial sense, as a vessel for offering oblations. But its secondary meaning, in which it is here taken, is a taker, a grasper, i.e. an organ of sense, while atigraha is intended for that which is grasped, i.e. an object of sense.</p>
