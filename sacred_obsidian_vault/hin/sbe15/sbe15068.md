 <p>1. Then Kahola Kaushîtakeya asked. 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, 'he said, 'tell me the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self (Âtman), who is within all.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'This, thy Self, who is within all.'</p>  
 <p>'Which Self, O Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, is within all?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'He who overcomes hunger and thirst, sorrow, passion, old age, and death. When Brâhma<i>n</i>as know that Self, and have risen above the desire for sons <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">2</font></a>, wealth, and (new) worlds <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">3</font></a>, they wander about as mendicants. For a desire for sons is desire for wealth, a desire for wealth is desire for worlds. Both these are indeed desires. Therefore let a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, after he has done with learning,</p>

By whatever means he has become a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, he is such indeed <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Everything else is of evil.' After that Kahola Kaushîtakeya held his peace.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_406"></a><a href="sbe15068.htm#fr_406">130:1</a> Knowledge of the Self, which enables us to dispense with all other knowledge.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_407"></a><a href="sbe15068.htm#fr_407">130:2</a> Mr. Gough proposes as an alternative rendering: 'Let a Brâhma<i>n</i>a renounce learning and become as a child; and after renouncing learning and a childlike mind, let him become a quietist; and when he has made an end of quietism and non-quietism, he shall become a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a indeed.' Deussen takes a similar view, but I doubt whether 'the knowledge of babes' is not a Christian rather than an Indian idea, in spite of <i>S</i>aṅkara's remarks on Ved. Sûtra, III, 4, 50, which are strangely at variance with his commentary here. Possibly the text may be corrupt, for tish<i>th</i>âset too is a very peculiar form. We might conjecture balyena, as we have abalyam, in IV, 4, 1. In Kaush. Up. III, 3, âbâlyam stands for âbălyam, possibly for ăbălyam. The construction of kena syâd yena syât tened<i>ri</i><i>s</i>a eva, however, is well known.</p>
