 <p>1. When <i>G</i>anaka Vaideha was sitting (to give audience), Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya approached, and <i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, for what object did you come, wishing for cattle, or for subtle questions <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'For both, Your Majesty;</p>  
 <p>2. 'Let us hear what anybody may have told you.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha replied: '<i>G</i>itvan <i>S</i>ailini told me that speech (vâk) is Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'As one who had (the benefit of a good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did Sailini <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">2</font></a> tell you, that speech is Brahman; for what is the use of a dumb person? But did he tell you the body (âyatana) and the resting-place (pratish<i>th</i>â) of that Brahman?'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'He did not tell me.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands on one leg only <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'Then tell me, Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya.'</p>

 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'The tongue is its body, ether its place, and one should worship it as knowledge.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'What is the nature of that knowledge?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'Your Majesty, speech itself (is knowledge). For through speech, Your Majesty, a friend is known (to be a friend), and likewise the <i>Ri</i>g-Veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, Sâma-veda, the Atharvâṅgirasas, the Itihâsa (tradition), Purâ<i>n</i>a-vidyâ (knowledge of the past), the Upanishads, <i>S</i>lokas (verses), Sûtras (rules), Anuvyâkhyânas and Vyâkhyânas (commentaries <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">1</font></a>, &amp;c.); what is sacrificed, what is poured out, what is (to be) eaten and drunk, this world and the other world, and all creatures. By speech alone, Your Majesty, Brahman is known, speech indeed, O King, is the Highest Brahman. Speech does not desert him who worships that (Brahman) with such knowledge, all creatures approach him, and having become a god, he goes to the gods.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'I shall give you (for this) a thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'My father was of opinion that one should not accept a reward without having fully instructed a pupil.'</p>  
 <p>3. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Let us hear what anybody may have told you.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha replied: 'Udaṅka <i>S</i>aulbâyana told me that life (prâ<i>n</i>a) <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">2</font></a> is Brahman.'</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Udaṅka <i>S</i>aulbâyana tell you that life is Brahman; for what is the use of a person without life? But did he tell you the body and the resting-place of that Brahman?'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'He did not tell me.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands on one leg only.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'Then tell me, Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Breath is its body, ether its place, and one should worship it as what is dear.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'What is the nature of that which is dear?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'Your Majesty, life itself (is that which is dear);' because for the sake of life, Your Majesty, a man sacrifices even for him who is unworthy of sacrifice, he accepts presents from him who is not worthy to bestow presents, nay, he goes to a country, even when there is fear of being hurt <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the sake of life. Life, O King, is the Highest Brahman. Life does not desert him who worships that (Brahman) with such knowledge, all creatures approach him, and having become a god, he goes to the gods.'</p>

 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha replied: 'Barku Vârsh<i>n</i>a told me that sight (<i>k</i>akshus) is Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'As one who had (the benefit of a good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did Barku Vârshna tell you that sight is Brahman; for what is the use of a person who cannot see? But did he tell you the body and the resting-place of that Brahman?'</p>

 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'The eye is its body, ether its place, and one should worship it as what is true.'</p>  
 <p>Ganaka Vaideha said: 'What is the nature of that which is true?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'Your Majesty, sight itself (is that which is true); for if they say to a man who sees with his eye, "Didst thou see?" and he says, "I saw," then it is true. Sight, O King, is the Highest Brahman. Sight does not desert him who worships that (Brahman) with such knowledge, all creatures approach him, and having become a god, he goes to the gods.'</p>

 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'What is the nature of that which is endless?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, replied: 'Your Majesty, space (disa<i>h</i>) itself (is that which is endless), and therefore to whatever space (quarter) he goes, he never comes to the end of it. For space is endless. Space indeed, O King, is hearing <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and hearing indeed, O King, is the Highest Brahman.

 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'What is the nature of bliss?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'Your Majesty, mind itself; for with the mind does a man desire a woman, and a like son is born of her, and he is bliss.
