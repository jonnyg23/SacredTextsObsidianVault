 <p>'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya?'</p>  
 <p>'Three,' he said.</p>  
 <p>'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya?'</p>  
 <p>'Two,' he said.</p>

 <p>'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya?'</p>  
 <p>'One,' he said.</p>  
 <p>'Yes,' he said, and asked: 'Who are these three and three hundred, three and three thousand?'</p>  
 <p>2. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'They are only the various powers of them, in reality there are only thirty-three gods <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>He asked: 'Who are those thirty-three?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the twelve Âdityas. They make thirty-one, and Indra and Pra<i>g</i>âpati make the thirty-three <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>3. He asked: 'Who are the Vasus.'</p>

 <p>4. He asked: 'Who are the Rudras?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'These ten vital breaths (prâ<i>n</i>as, the senses, i.e. the five <i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânendriyas, and the five karmendriyas), and Âtman <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">1</font></a>, as the eleventh. When they depart from this mortal body, they make us cry (rodayanti), and because they make us cry, they are called Rudras.'</p>  
 <p>5. He asked: 'Who are the Âdityas?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'The twelve months of the year, and they are Âdityas, because they move along (yanti), taking up everything <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">2</font></a> (âdadânâ<i>h</i>). Because they move along, taking up everything, therefore they are called Âdityas.'</p>  
 <p>6. He asked: 'And who is Indra, and who is Pra<i>g</i>âpati?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'Indra is thunder, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice.'</p>  
 <p>He asked: 'And what is the thunder?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'The thunderbolt.'</p>  
 <p>He asked: 'And what is the sacrifice?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'The (sacrificial) animals.'</p>  
 <p>7. He asked: 'Who are the six?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'Agni (fire), P<i>ri</i>thivî (earth), Vâyu (air), Antariksha (sky), Âditya (sun), Dyu (heaven), they are the six, for they are all <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_430"><font size="1">3</font></a> this, the six.'</p>

 <p>He asked: 'Who are the two gods?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'Food and breath.'</p>  
 <p>He asked: 'Who is the one god and a half?'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya replied: 'He that blows.'</p>  
 <p>9. Here they say: 'How is it that he who blows like one only, should be called one and a half (adhyardha)?' And the answer is: 'Because, when the wind was blowing, everything grew (adhyardhnot).'</p>  
 <p>He asked: 'Who is the one god?'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_422"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_422">139:2</a> This disputation between Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya and Vidagdha <i>S</i>âkalya occurs in a simpler form in the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a, XI, p. 873. He is here represented as the first who defies Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, and whom Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya asks at once, whether the other Brâhmans had made him the ulmukâvakshaya<i>n</i>a, the cat's paw, literally one who has to take a burning piece of wood out of the fire (ardha. dagdhakâsh<i>th</i>am ulmukam; tasya vahirnirasanam avakshaya<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> vinâ<i>s</i>a<i>h</i>). The end, however, is different, for on asking the nature of the one god, the Prâ<i>n</i>a, he is told by Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya that he has asked for what he ought not to ask, and that therefore he will die and thieves will carry away his bones.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_427"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_427">140:3</a> The etymological explanation of Vasu is not quite clear, and <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></a> the commentator hardly explains our text. Perhaps vasu is meant for the world or the dwellers therein. The more usual explanation occurs in the <i>S</i>atap. Brâh. p. 1077, ete hîda<i>m</i> sarva<i>m</i> vâsayante tadyad ida<i>m</i> sarva<i>m</i> vâsayante tasmâd vasava iti; or on p. 874, where we read te yad ida<i>m</i> sarvam &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_428"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_428">141:1</a> Âtman is here explained as manas, the common sensory.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_431"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_431">142:1</a> I prefer to attribute this to <i>S</i>âkalya, who is still the questioner, and not Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya; but I am not quite satisfied that I am right in this, or in the subsequent distribution of the parts, assigned to each speaker. If <i>S</i>âkalya is the questioner, then the sentence, veda vâ aha<i>m</i> tam purusha<i>m</i> sarvasyâtmana<i>h</i> parâya<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> yam âttha, must belong to Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, because he refers to the words of another speaker. Lastly, the sentence vadaiva has to be taken as addressed to <i>S</i>âkalya. The commentator remarks that, he being the questioner, one expects pri<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a instead of vada. But Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya may also be supposed to turn round on <i>S</i>âkalya and ask him a question in turn, more difficult than the question addressed by <i>S</i>âkalya to Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, and in that case the last sentence must be taken as an answer, though an imperfect one, of <i>S</i>âkalya's. The commentator seems to think that after Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya told <i>S</i>âkalya to ask this question, <i>S</i>âkalya was frightened and asked it, and that then Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya answered in turn.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_432"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_432">142:2</a> The Mâdhyandina text varies considerably. It has the first time, <i>k</i>ashur loka<i>h</i> for agnir loka<i>h</i>. I keep to the same construction throughout, taking mano <i>g</i>yoti<i>h</i>, not as a compound, but like agnir loko yasya, as a sentence, i.e. mano <i>g</i>yotir yasya.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_437"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_437">143:5</a> The commentator explains satya, the true, by the eye, because the sun owes its origin to the eye.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_438"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_438">144:1</a> Read <i>s</i>rautra instead of <i>s</i>rotra; see B<i>ri</i>h. Âr. Up. II, 5, 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_439"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_439">144:2</a> Shadow, <i>kh</i>âyâ, is explained here by a<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âna, ignorance, not by <i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âna, knowledge.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_440"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_440">145:1</a> Aṅgârâvakshaya<i>n</i>a is explained as a vessel in which coals are extinguished, and Ânandagiri adds that Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, in saying that <i>S</i>âkalya was made an aṅgârâvakshaya<i>n</i>a by his fellow Brâhmans, meant that he was given up by them as a victim, in fact that he was being burnt or consumed by Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya. I should prefer to take aṅgârâvakshaya<i>n</i>a in the sense of ulmukâvakshaya<i>n</i>a, an instrument with which one takes burning coals from the fire to extinguish them, a pair of tongs. Read sanda<i>m</i>sa instead of sandesa. Kshi with ava means to remove, to take away. We should call an aṅgârâvakshaya<i>n</i>a a cat's paw. The Brâhma<i>n</i>as used <i>S</i>âkalya as a cat's paw.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_441"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_441">145:2</a> It seems better to take kim as the interrogative pronoun than as an interrogative particle.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_442"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_442">146:1</a> Heart stands here for buddhi and manas together. Comm.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_443"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_443">146:2</a> In the text, published by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca Indica, a sentence is left out, viz. h<i>ri</i>daya ity uvâ<i>k</i>a, h<i>ri</i>dayena hi rûpâ<i>n</i>i <i>g</i>ânâti, h<i>ri</i>daye hy eva rûpâ<i>n</i>i pratish<i>th</i>itâni bhavantîty.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_444"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_444">147:1</a> Dîkshâ is the initiatory rite for the Soma sacrifice. Having sacrificed with Soma which has to be bought, the sacrificer becomes endowed with wisdom, and wanders to the North, which is the quarter of Soma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_445"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_445">148:1</a> A term of reproach, it may be a ghost or preta, because ahani lîyate, it disappears by day.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_446"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_446">148:2</a> Because the prâ<i>n</i>a would run away, if it were not held back by the apâna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_447"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_447">148:3</a> Because the apâna would run down, and the prâ<i>n</i>a up, if they were not held back by the vyâna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_448"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_448">148:4</a> Because all three, the prâ<i>n</i>a, apâna, and vyâna, would run away in all directions, if they were not fastened to the udâna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_449"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_449">148:5</a> The Samâna can hardly be meant here for one of the five prâ<i>n</i>as, generally mentioned before the udâna, but, as explained by Dvivedagaṅga, stands for the Sûtrâtman. This Sûtrâtman abides in the Antaryâmin, and this in the Brahman (Kû<i>t</i>astha), which is <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></a> therefore described next. Could Samâna be here the same as in IV, 3, 7?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_450"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_450">149:1</a> See before, II, 3, 6; also IV, 2, 4; IV, 4, 22; IV, 5, 115.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_451"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_451">149:2</a> Dividing them according to the different abodes, worlds, and persons, and uniting them at last in the heart.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_452"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_452">150:1</a> In the Mâdhyandina-<i>s</i>âkhâ, p. 1080, tasmât tadâtunnât, instead of tasmât tadât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>ât.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_453"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_453">150:2</a> <i>S</i>aṅkara seems to have read snâvavat, instead of snâva, tat sthiram, as we read in both <i>S</i>âkhâs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_454"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_454">150:3</a> Here the Mâdhyandinas (p. 1080) add, <i>g</i>âta eva na <i>g</i>âyate, ko nv ena<i>m</i> <i>g</i>anayet puna<i>h</i>, which the Kâ<i>n</i>vas place later.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_455"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_455">150:4</a> Instead of a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>asâ, the Mâdhyandinas have anyata<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_456"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_456">150:5</a> The Mâdhyandinas have dhânâruha u vai, which is better than iva vai, the iva being, according to <i>S</i>aṅkara's own confession, useless. The thread of the argument does not seem to have been clearly perceived by the commentators. What the poet wants to say is, that a man, struck down by death, does not come to life again from seed, because human seed comes from the living only, while trees, springing from grain, are seen to come to life after the tree (which yielded the grain or the seed) is dead. Pretya-sambhava like pretya-bhâva, means life after death, and pretyasambhava, as an adjective, means coming to life after death.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_457"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_457">150:6</a> This line too is taken in a different sense by the commentator. According to him, it would mean: 'If you say, He has been born <a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></a> (and there is an end of all questioning), I say, No; he is born again, and the question is, How?' This is much too artificial. The order of the verses in the Mâdhyandina-<i>s</i>âkhâ is better on the whole, leading up more naturally to the question, 'From what root then does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled by death?' When the Brâhmans cannot answer, Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya answers, or the <i>S</i>ruti declares, that the root from whence a mortal springs again, after death, is Brahman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_458"></a><a href="sbe15072.htm#fr_458">151:1</a> <i>S</i>aṅkara explains râtir dâtu<i>h</i> as râter dâtu<i>h</i>, a reading adopted by the Mâdhyandinas. He then arrives at the statement that Brahman is the principle or the last source, also the root of a new life, both for those who practise works and for those who, having relinquished works, stand firm in knowledge. Regnaud (II, p. 138) translates: 'C'est Brahma (qui est) l'intelligence, le bonheur, la richesse, le but suprême de celui qui offre (des sacrifices), et de celui qui réside (en lui), de celui qui connaît.'</p>
