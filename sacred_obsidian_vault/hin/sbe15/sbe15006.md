 <p>THIS Upanishad has been so often edited and discussed that it calls for no special remarks. It forms part of the Satapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a. In the Mâdhyandina-<i>s</i>âkhâ of that Brâhma<i>n</i>a, which has been edited by Professor Weber, the Upanishad, consisting of six adhyâyas, begins with the fourth adhyâya (or third prapâ<i>th</i>aka) of the fourteenth book.</p>  
 <p>There is a commentary on the B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka-upanishad by Dviveda<i>s</i>rînârâya<i>n</i>asûnu Dvivedagaṅga, which has been carefully edited by Weber in his great edition of the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a from a MS. in the Bodleian Library, formerly belonging to Dr. Mill, in which the Upanishad is called Mâdhyandinîya-brâhma<i>n</i>a-upanishad.</p>  
 <p>In the Kâ<i>n</i>va-<i>s</i>âkhâ the B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka-upanishad forms the seventeenth book of the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a, consisting of six adhyâyas.</p>  
 <p>As <i>S</i>aṅkara's commentary and the gloss of Ânandatîrtha, edited by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca Indica, follow the Kâ<i>n</i>va-<i>s</i>âkhâ, I have followed the same text in my translation.</p>  
 <p>Besides Dr. Roer's edition of the text, commentary and gloss of this Upanishad, there is Poley's edition of the text. There is also a translation of it by Dr. Roer, with large extracts from <i>S</i>aṅkara's commentary.</p>
