 <p>1. Next follows the Uktha <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Verily, breath (prâ<i>n</i>a) is Uktha, for breath raises up (utthâpayati) all this. From him who knows this, there is raised a wise son, knowing the Uktha; he obtains union and oneness with the Uktha.</p>  
 <p>2. Next follows the Ya<i>g</i>us. Verily, breath is Ya<i>g</i>us, for all these beings are joined in breath <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">2</font></a>. For him who knows this, all beings are joined to procure his excellence; he obtains union and oneness with the Ya<i>g</i>us.</p>  
 <p>3. Next follows the Sâman. Verily, breath is the Sâman, for all these beings meet in breath. For him who knows this, all beings meet to procure his excellence; he obtains union and oneness with the Sâman.</p>  
 <p>4. Next follows the Kshatra. Verily, breath is the Kshatra, for breath is Kshatra, i.e. breath protects (trâyate) him from being hurt (ksha<i>n</i>ito<i>h</i>). He who knows this, obtains Kshatra (power), which requires no protection; he obtains union and oneness with Kshatra <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_570"></a><a href="sbe15091.htm#fr_570">195:1</a> Meditation on the hymn called uktha. On the uktha, as the principal part in the Mahâvrata, see Kaush. Up. III, 3; Ait. Âr. II, 1, 2. The uktha, yagus, sâman, &amp;c. are here represented as forms under which prâ<i>n</i>a or life, and indirectly Brahman, is to be meditated on.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="sbe15091.htm#fr_571">195:2</a> Without life or breath nothing can join anything else; therefore life is called ya<i>g</i>us, as it were yu<i>g</i>us.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_572"></a><a href="sbe15091.htm#fr_572">195:3</a> Instead of Kshatram atram, another <i>S</i>âkhâ, i.e. the Mâdhyandina, reads Kshatramâtram, which Dvivedagaṅga explains as, he <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a> obtains the nature of the Kshatra, or he obtains the Kshatra which protects (Kshatram âtram).</p>
