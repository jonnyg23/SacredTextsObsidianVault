 <p>1. Death said: 'The Self-existent pierced the openings (of the senses) so that they turn forward: therefore man looks forward, not backward into himself. Some wise man, however, with his eyes closed and wishing for immortality, saw the Self behind.'</p>  
 <p>2. 'Children follow after outward pleasures, and fall into the snare of wide-spread death. Wise men only, knowing the nature of what is immortal, do not look for anything stable here among things unstable.'</p>  
 <p>3. 'That by which we know form, taste, smell, sounds, and loving touches, by that also we know what exists besides. This is that (which thou hast asked for).'</p>  
 <p>4. 'The wise, when he knows that that by which he perceives all objects in sleep or in waking is the great omnipresent Self, grieves no more.'</p>  
 <p>5. 'He who knows this living soul which eats honey (perceives objects) as being the Self, always near, the Lord of the past and the future, henceforward fears no more. This is that.'</p>  
 <p>6. 'He who (knows) him <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">1</font></a> who was born first from</p>

 <p>the brooding heat <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a> (for he was born before the water), who, entering into the heart, abides therein, and was perceived from the elements. This is that.'</p>  
 <p>7. '(He who knows) Aditi also, who is one with all deities, who arises with Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath or Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha), who, entering into the heart, abides therein, and was born from the elements. This is that.'</p>  
 <p>8. 'There is Agni (fire), the all-seeing, hidden in the two fire-sticks, well-guarded like a child (in the womb) by the mother, day after day to be adored by men when they awake and bring oblations. This is that.'</p>  
 <p>9. 'And that whence the sun rises, and whither it goes to set, there all the Devas are contained, and no one goes beyond. This is that <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>10. 'What is here (visible in the world), the same is there (invisible in Brahman); and what is there, the same is here. He who sees any difference here (between Brahman and the world), goes from death to death.'</p>  
 <p>11. 'Even by the mind this (Brahman) is to be obtained, and then there is no difference whatsoever. He goes from death to death who sees any difference here.'</p>  
 <p>12. 'The person (purusha), of the size of a thumb <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">3</font></a>, stands in the middle of the Self (body?), as lord of the past and the future, and henceforward fears no more. This is that.'</p>  
 <p>13. 'That person, of the size of a thumb, is like a light without smoke, lord of the past and the future, he is the same to-day and to-morrow. This is that.'</p>

 <p>14. 'As rain-water that has fallen on a mountain-ridge runs down the rocks on all sides, thus does he, who sees a difference between qualities, run after them on all sides.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_119"></a><a href="sbe15013.htm#fr_119">15:1</a> The first manifestation of Brahman, commonly called Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, which springs from the tapas of Brahman. Afterwards only water and the rest of the elements become manifested. The text of these verses is abrupt, possibly corrupt. The two accusatives, tish<i>th</i>antam and tish<i>th</i>antim, seem to me to require veda to be supplied from verse 4.</p>
