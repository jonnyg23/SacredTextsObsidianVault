 <p>Now this is an examination of (what is meant by) Bliss (ânanda):</p>  
 <p>Let there be a noble young man, who is well read (in the Veda), very swift, firm, and strong, and let the whole world be full of wealth for him, that is one measure of human bliss.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that human bliss (2) is one measure of the bliss of human Gandharvas (genii),</p>

 <p>and likewise of a great sage (learned in the Vedas) who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of human Gandharvas is one measure of the bliss of divine Gandharvas (genii), and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of divine Gandharvas is one measure of the bliss of the Fathers, enjoying their long estate, and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of the Fathers is one measure of the bliss of the Devas, born in the Â<i>g</i>âna heaven (through the merit of their lawful works), (3) and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of the Devas born in the Â<i>g</i>âna heaven is one measure of the bliss of the sacrificial Devas, who go to the Devas by means of their Vaidik sacrifices, and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of the sacrificial Devas is one measure of the bliss of the (thirty-three) Devas, and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of the (thirty-three) Devas is one measure of the bliss of Indra, (4) and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of Indra is one measure of the bliss of B<i>ri</i>haspati, and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of B<i>ri</i>haspati is one measure of the bliss of Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.</p>  
 <p>One hundred times that bliss of Pra<i>g</i>âpati is one</p>

 <p>He who knows this, when he has departed this world, reaches and comprehends the Self which consists of food, the Self which consists of breath, the Self which consists of mind, the Self which consists of understanding, the Self which consists of bliss.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_227"></a><a href="sbe15041.htm#fr_227">61:2</a> In giving the various degrees of happiness, the author of the Upanishad gives us at the same time the various classes of human and divine beings which we must suppose were recognised in his time. We have Men, human Gandharvas, divine Gandharvas, Fathers (pitara<i>s</i> <i>k</i>iralokalokâ<i>h</i>), born Gods (âgâna<i>g</i>â devâ<i>h</i>), Gods by merit (karmadevâ<i>h</i>), Gods, Indra, B<i>ri</i>haspati, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, Brahman. Such a list would seem to be the invention of an individual rather than the result of an old tradition, if it did not occur in a very similar form in the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a, Mâdhyandina-<i>s</i>âkhâ XIV, 7, 1 ,31, Kâ<i>n</i>va-<i>s</i>âkhâ (B<i>ri</i>h. Âr. Up. IV, 3, 32). Here, too, the highest measure of happiness is ascribed to the Brahmaloka, and other beings are supposed to share a certain measure only of its supreme happiness. The scale begins in the Mâdhyandina-<i>s</i>âkhâ with men, who are followed by the Fathers (pitaro <i>g</i>italokâ<i>h</i>), the Gods by merit (karmadevâ<i>h</i>), the Gods by birth (âgânadevâ<i>h</i>, with whom the <i>S</i>rotriya is joined), the world of Gods, the world of Gandharvas, the world of Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the world of Brahman. In the B<i>ri</i>had-âra<i>n</i>yaka-upanishad we have Men, Fathers, Gandharvas, Gods by merit, Gods by birth, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Brahman. If we place the three lists side by side, we find--</p>  <div align="center">  <table border="0" width="779">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="33%">

 <p>The commentators do not help us much. <i>S</i>aṅkara on the Taittirîyaka-upanishad <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></a> explains the human Gandharvas as men who have become Gandharvas, a kind of fairies; divine Gandharvas, as Gandharvas by birth. The Fathers or Manes are called Kiraloka, because they remain long, though not for ever, in their world. The âgâna<i>g</i>a Gods are explained as born in the world of the Devas through their good works (smârta), while the Karmadevas are explained as born there through their sacred works (vaidika). The Gods are the thirty-three, whose lord is Indra, and whose teacher B<i>ri</i>haspati. Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Virâ<i>g</i>, Brahman Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha. Dvivedagaṅga, in his commentary on the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a, explains the Fathers as those who, proceeding on the Southern path, have conquered their world, more particularly by having themselves offered in their life sacrifices to their Fathers. The Karmadevas, according to him, are those who have become Devas by sacred works (<i>s</i>rauta), the Âgânadevas those who were gods before there were men. The Gods are Indra and the rest, while the Gandharvas are not explained. Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Virâ<i>g</i>, Brahman is Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha. Lastly, <i>S</i>aṅkara, in his commentary on the B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yakaupanishad, gives nearly the same explanation as before; only that he makes âgânadevâ<i>h</i> still clearer, by explaining them as gods âgânata<i>h</i>, i.e. utpattita<i>h</i>, from their birth.</p>  
 <p>The arrangement of these beings and their worlds, one rising above the other, reminds us of the cosmography of the Buddhists, but the elements, though in a less systematic form, existed evidently before. Thus we find in the so-called Gargî-brâhma<i>n</i>a (Satapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a XIV, 6, 6, 1) the following succession: Water, air, ether <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">a</font></a>, the worlds of the sky <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">b</font></a>, heaven, sun, moon, stars, gods, Gandharvas <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">c</font></a>, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, Brahman. In the Kaushîtaki-upanishad I, 3 (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 275) there is another series, the worlds of Agni, Vâyu, Varu<i>n</i>a, Indra, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Brahman. See Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 224.</p>
