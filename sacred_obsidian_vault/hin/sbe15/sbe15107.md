 <p>1. Then Bhârgava Vaidarbhi asked him: 'Sir, How many gods <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">1</font></a> keep what has thus been created, how many manifest this <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and who is the best of them?'</p>  
 <p>2. He replied: 'The ether is that god, the wind, fire, water, earth, speech, mind, eye, and ear. These, when they have manifested (their power), contend and say: We (each of us) support this body and keep it <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3 <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Then Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath, spirit, life), as the best, said to them: Be not deceived, I alone, dividing myself fivefold, support this body and keep it.</p>  
 <p>4. They were incredulous; so he, from pride, did as if he were going out from above. Thereupon,</p>

 <p>as he went out, all the others went out, and as he returned, all the others returned. As bees go out when their queen <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">1</font></a> goes out, and return when she returns, thus (did) speech, mind, eye, and ear; and, being satisfied, they praise Prâ<i>n</i>a, saying:</p>  
 <p>5. He is Agni (fire), he shines as Sûrya (sun), he is Par<i>g</i>anya (rain), the powerful (Indra), he is Vâyu, (wind), he is the earth, he is matter, he is God--he is what is and what is not, and what is immortal.</p>  
 <p>6. As spokes in the nave of a wheel, everything is fixed in Prâ<i>n</i>a, the verses of the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, Sâma-veda, the sacrifice, the Kshatriyas, and the Brâhmans.</p>  
 <p>7. As Pra<i>g</i>âpati (lord of creatures) thou movest about in the womb, thou indeed art born again. To thee, the Prâ<i>n</i>a, these creatures bring offerings, to thee who dwellest with the other prâ<i>n</i>as (the organs of sense).</p>  
 <p>8. Thou art the best carrier for the Gods, thou art the first offering <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">2</font></a> to the Fathers. Thou art the true work of the Rishis <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">3</font></a>, of the Atharvâṅgiras.</p>  
 <p>9. O Prâ<i>n</i>a, thou art Indra by thy light, thou art Rudra, as a protector; thou movest in the sky, thou art the sun, the lord of lights.</p>  
 <p>10. When thou showerest down rain, then, O Prâ<i>n</i>a, these creatures of thine are delighted <a name="fr_888"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">4</font></a>, hoping that there will be food, as much as they desire.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. Thou art a Vrâtya <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">1</font></a>, O Prâ<i>n</i>a, the only <i>Ri</i>shi <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the consumer of everything, the good lord. We are the givers of what thou hast to consume, thou, O Mâtari<i>s</i>va <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">3</font></a>, art our father.</p>  
 <p>12. Make propitious that body of thine which dwells in speech, in the ear, in the eye, and which pervades the mind; do not go away!</p>  
 <p>13. All this is in the power of Prâ<i>n</i>a, whatever exists in the three heavens. Protect us like a mother her sons, and give us happiness and wisdom.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_879"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_881">274:1</a> Devâ<i>h</i>, powers, organs, senses.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_880"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_882">274:2</a> Their respective power.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_881"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_883">274:3</a> This is <i>S</i>aṅkara's explanation, in which bâ<i>n</i>a is taken to mean the same as <i>s</i>arîra, body. But there seems to be no authority for such a meaning, and Ânandagiri tries in vain to find an etymological excuse for it. Bâ<i>n</i>a or Vâ<i>n</i>a generally means an arrow, or, particularly in Brâhma<i>n</i>a writings, a harp with many strings. I do not see how an arrow could be used as an appropriate simile here, but a harp might, if we take avash<i>t</i>abhya in the sense of holding the frame of the instrument, and vidhârayâma<i>h</i> in the sense of stretching and thereby modulating it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_882"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_884">274:4</a> On this dispute of the organs of sense, see B<i>ri</i>h. Up. VI, 1, p. 201; <i>Kh</i>ând. Up. V, 1 (S. B. E., vol. i, p. 72).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_883"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_885">275:1</a> In Sanskrit it is madhukararâ<i>g</i>a, king of the bees.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_884"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_886">275:2</a> When a <i>s</i>râddha is offered to the Pit<i>ri</i>s.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_885"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_887">275:3</a> Explained as the eye and the other organs of sense which the chief Prâ<i>n</i>a supports; but it is probably an old verse, here applied to a special purpose.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_886"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_888">275:4</a> Another reading is prâ<i>n</i>ate, they breathe.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_887"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_889">276:1</a> A person for whom the sa<i>m</i>skâras, the sacramental and initiatory rites, have not been performed. <i>S</i>aṅkara says that, as he was the first born, there was no one to perform them for him, and that he is called Vrâtya, because he was pure by nature. This is all very doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_888"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_890">276:2</a> Agni is said to be the <i>Ri</i>shi of the Âtharva<i>n</i>as.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_889"></a><a href="sbe15107.htm#fr_891">276:3</a> Instead of the irregular vocative Mâtari<i>s</i>va, there is another reading, Mâtari<i>s</i>vana<i>h</i>, i.e. thou art the father of Mâtari<i>s</i>van, the wind, and therefore of the whole world.</p>
