 <p>1. Then Uddâlaka Âruni <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">2</font></a> asked. 'Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya,' he said, 'we dwelt among the Madras in the houses of Pata<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ala Kâpya, studying the sacrifice. His wife was possessed of a Gandharva, and we asked him: "Who art thou?" He answered: "I am Kabandha Âtharva<i>n</i>a." And he said to Pata<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ala Kâpya and to (us) students: "Dost thou know, Kâpya, that thread by which this world and the other world, and all beings are strung together?" And Pata<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ala Kâpya replied: "I do not know it, Sir." He said again to Pata<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ala Kâpya and to (us) students: "Dost thou know, Kâpya, that puller (ruler) within (antaryâmin), who within pulls (rules) this world and the other world and all beings?" And Pata<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ala Kâpya replied: "I do not know it, Sir." He said again to Pata<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ala Kâpya and to (us) students: "He, O Kâpya, who knows that thread and him who pulls (it) within, he knows Brahman, he knows the worlds, he knows the Devas, he knows the Vedas, he knows the Bhûtas (creatures), he knows the Self, he knows everything." Thus did he (the Gandharva) say to them, and I know it. If thou, O Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, without knowing that string and the puller within, drivest away those Brahma-cows (the cows offered as a prize to him who best knows Brahman), thy head will fall off.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'O Gautama, I believe I know that thread and the puller within.'</p>

 <p>The other said: 'Anybody may say, I know, I know. Tell what thou knowest.'</p>  
 <p>2. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Vâyu (air) is that thread, O Gautama. By air, as by a thread, O Gautama, this world and the other world, and all creatures are strung together. Therefore, O Gautama, people say of a dead person that his limbs have become unstrung; for by air, as by a thread, O Gautama, they were strung together.'</p>  
 <p>The other said: 'So it is, O Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya. Tell now (who is) the puller within.'</p>  
 <p>3. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'He who dwells in the earth, and within the earth <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is, and who pulls (rules) the earth within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>4. 'He who dwells in the water, and within the water, whom the water does not know, whose body the water is, and who pulls (rules) the water within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>

 <p>6. 'He who dwells in the sky, and within the sky, whom the sky does not know, whose body the sky is, and who pulls (rules) the sky within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>7. 'He who dwells in the air (vâyu), and within the air, whom the air does not know, whose body the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></a></p>  
 <p>air is, and who pulls (rules) the air within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>8. 'He who dwells in the heaven (dyu), and within the heaven, whom the heaven does not know, whose body the heaven is, and who pulls (rules) the heaven within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>9. 'He who dwells in the sun (Âditya), and within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is, and who pulls (rules) the sun within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>10. 'He who dwells in the space (disah), and within the space, whom the space does not know, whose body the space is, and who pulls (rules) the space within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>11. 'He who dwells in the moon and stars (<i>k</i>andra-târakam), and within the moon and stars, whom the moon and stars do not know, whose body the moon and stars are, and who pulls (rules) the moon and stars within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>12. 'He who dwells in the ether (âkâsa), and within the ether, whom the ether does not know, whose body the ether is, and who pulls (rules) the ether within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>13. 'He who dwells in the darkness (tamas), and within the darkness, whom the darkness does not know, whose body the darkness is, and who pulls (rules) the darkness within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>14. 'He who dwells in the light (te<i>g</i>as), and within the light, whom the light does not know, whose</p>  
 <p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></a></p>  
 <p>body the light is, and who pulls (rules) the light within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>So far with respect to the gods (adhidaivatam); now with respect to beings (adhibhûtam).</p>  
 <p>15. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'He who dwells in all beings, and within all beings, whom all beings do not know, whose body all beings are, and who pulls (rules) all beings within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>

 <p>skin is, and who pulls (rules) the skin within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>22. 'He who dwells in knowledge <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and within knowledge, whom knowledge does not know, whose body knowledge is, and who pulls (rules) knowledge within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
 <p>23. 'He who dwells in the seed, and within the seed, whom the seed does not know, whose body the seed is, and who pulls (rules) the seed within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal; unseen, but seeing; unheard, but hearing; unperceived, but perceiving; unknown, but knowing. There is no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but he, there is no other perceiver but he, there is no other knower but he. This is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal. Everything else is of evil.' After that Uddâlaka Âruni held his peace.</p>
