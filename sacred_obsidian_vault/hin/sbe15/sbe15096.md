Thou art firm (as the sky). Thou art the abode of all (as the earth). Thou hast been saluted with Hiṅ (at the beginning of the sacrifice by the prastot<i>ri</i>).

Thou art light (as Agni, fire, the eater). Thou art the end. Thou art the absorption (of all things).'</p>  
 <p>5. Then he holds it (the Mantha) forth, saying</p>

In the morning he worships Âditya (the sun), with the hymn, 'Thou art the best lotus of the four quarters, may I become the best lotus among men.' Then returning as he came, he sits down behind the altar and recites the genealogical list <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. Uddâlaka Âruni told this (Mantha-doctrine) to his pupil Vâ<i>g</i>asaneya Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, and said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves spring forth.'</p>

 <p>13. Four things are made of the wood of the Udumbara tree, the sacrificial ladle (sruva), the cup (<i>k</i>amasa), the fuel, and the two churning sticks.</p>
