 <p>1. This is the truth. As from a blazing fire sparks, being like unto fire <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">1</font></a>, fly forth a thousandfold, thus are various beings brought forth from the Imperishable, my friend, and return thither also.</p>  
 <p>2. That heavenly Person is without body, he is both without and within, not produced, without breath and without mind, pure, higher than the high Imperishable <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. From him (when entering on creation) is born breath, mind, and all organs of sense, ether, air, light, water, and the earth, the support of all.</p>  
 <p>4. Fire (the sky) is his head, his eyes the sun and the moon, the quarters his ears, his speech the Vedas disclosed, the wind his breath, his heart the universe; from his feet came the earth; he is indeed the inner Self of all things <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. From him comes Agni (fire) <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the sun being the fuel; from the moon (Soma) comes rain (Par<i>g</i>anya); from the earth herbs; and man gives seed unto the woman. Thus many beings are begotten from the Person (purusha).</p>  
 <p>6. From him come the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, the Sâman, the</p>

 <p>7. From him the many Devas too are begotten, the Sâdhyas (genii), men, cattle, birds, the up and down breathings, rice and corn (for sacrifices), penance, faith, truth, abstinence, and law.</p>  
 <p>8. The seven senses (prâ<i>n</i>a) also spring from him, the seven lights (acts of sensation), the seven kinds of fuel (objects by which the senses are lighted), the seven sacrifices (results of sensation), these seven worlds (the places of the senses, the worlds determined by the senses) in which the senses move, which rest in the cave (of the heart), and are placed there seven and seven.</p>  
 <p>9. Hence come the seas and all the mountains, from him flow the rivers of every kind; hence come all herbs and the juice through which the inner Self subsists with the elements.</p>  
 <p>10. The Person is all this, sacrifice, penance, Brahman, the highest immortal; he who knows this hidden in the cave (of the heart), he, O friend, scatters the knot of ignorance here on earth.</p>
