 <p>1. In the imperishable and infinite Highest Brahman <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">1</font></a>, wherein the two, knowledge and ignorance, are hidden <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the one, ignorance, perishes <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the other, knowledge, is immortal; but he who controls both, knowledge and ignorance, is another <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. It is he who, being one only, rules over every germ (cause), over all forms, and over all germs; it is he who, in the beginning, bears <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">5</font></a> in his thoughts the wise son, the fiery, whom he wishes to look on <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">6</font></a> while he is born <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3 <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">8</font></a>. In that field <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">9</font></a> in which the god, after spreading out one net after another <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">10</font></a> in various ways, draws it together again, the Lord, the great Self <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">11</font></a>, having</p>

 <p>further created the lords <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">1</font></a>, thus carries on his lordship over all.</p>  
 <p>4. As the car (of the sun) shines, lighting up all quarters, above, below, and across, thus does that god, the holy, the adorable, being one, rule over all that has the nature of a germ <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. He, being one, rules over all and everything, so that the universal germ ripens its nature, diversifies all natures that can be ripened <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and determines all qualities <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Brahma (Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha) knows this, which is hidden in the Upanishads, which are hidden in the Vedas, as the Brahma-germ. The ancient gods</p>

 <p>and poets who knew it, they became it and were immortal.</p>  
 <p>7 <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">1</font></a>. But he who is endowed with qualities, and performs works that are to bear fruit, and enjoys the reward of whatever he has done, migrates through his own works, the lord of life, assuming all forms, led by the three Gu<i>n</i>as, and following the three paths <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8 <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">3</font></a>. That lower one also, not larger than a thumb, but brilliant like the sun, who is endowed with personality and thoughts, with the quality of mind and the quality of body, is seen small even like the point of a goad.</p>  
 <p>9. That living soul is to be known as part of the hundredth part of the point of a hair <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">4</font></a>, divided a hundred times, and yet it is to be infinite.</p>  
 <p>10. It is not woman, it is not man, nor is it neuter; whatever body it takes, with that it is joined <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">5</font></a> (only).</p>

 <p>12. That incarnate Self, according to his own qualities, chooses (assumes) many shapes, coarse or subtile, and having himself caused his union with them, he is seen as another and another <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">2</font></a>, through the qualities of his acts, and through the qualities of his body.</p>  
 <p>13 <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He who knows him who has no beginning and no end, in the midst of chaos, creating all things, having many forms, alone enveloping everything, is freed from all fetters.</p>  
 <p>14. Those who know him who is to be grasped by the mind, who is not to be called the nest (the body <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">4</font></a>), who makes existence and non-existence, the</p>

 <p><a name="fn_805"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_807">255:1</a> <i>S</i>aṅkara explains Brahmapare by brahma<i>n</i>o hira<i>n</i>yagarbhât pare, or by parasmin brahma<i>n</i>i, which comes to the same. Vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânâtman adds <i>kh</i>ândasa<i>h</i> paranipâta<i>h</i>. As the termination e may belong to the locative singular or to the nom. dual, commentators vary in referring some of the adjectives either to brahman or to vidyâvidye.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_806"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_808">255:2</a> Gû<i>dh</i>e, lokair <i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âtum a<i>s</i>akye, <i>S</i>aṅkarânanda.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_807"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_809">255:3</a> <i>S</i>aṅkara explains ksharam, by sa<i>m</i><i>s</i><i>ri</i>tikâra<i>n</i>am, am<i>ri</i>tam by mokshahetu<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_808"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_810">255:4</a> <i>S</i>aṅkara explains that he is different from them, being only the sâkshin, or witness. <i>S</i>aṅkarânanda seems to have read Somya, i.e. Somavatpriyadar<i>s</i>ana, as if <i>S</i>vetâ<i>s</i>vatvara addressed his pupil.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_809"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_811">255:5</a> Like a mother, see I, 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_810"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_812">255:6</a> Like a father.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_811"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_813">255:7</a> See on this verse the remarks made in the Introduction.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_812"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_814">255:8</a> The MSS. read yasmin for asmin, and patayas for yatayas, which the commentator explains by patîn.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_813"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_815">255:9</a> The world, or the mûlaprak<i>ri</i>ti, the net being the sa<i>m</i>sâra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_814"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_816">255:10</a> <i>S</i>aṅkara explains ekaikam by pratyekam, i.e. for every creature, such as gods, men, beasts, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_815"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_817">255:11</a> I doubt whether mahâtmâ should be translated by the great <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></a> Self, or whether great would not be sufficient. The whole verse is extremely difficult.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_816"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_818">256:1</a> From Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha to insects; or beginning with Marî<i>k</i>i.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_817"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_819">256:2</a> Cf. IV, 11; V, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_818"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_820">256:3</a> MS. B. has prâ<i>k</i>yân, and explains it by pûrvotpannân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_819"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_821">256:4</a> This is again a very difficult verse. I have taken vi<i>s</i>vayoni<i>h</i> as a name for Brahman, possessed of that devâtma<i>s</i>akti which was mentioned before, but I feel by no means satisfied. The commentators do not help, because they do not see the difficulty of the construction. If one might conjecture, I should prefer pa<i>k</i>et for pa<i>k</i>ati, and should write parinâmayed yat, and viniyo<i>g</i>ayed yat, unless we changed ya<i>k</i><i>k</i>a into ya<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_820"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_822">256:5</a> This verse admits of various translations, and requires also some metrical emendations. Thus Vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânâtman explains vedaguhyopanishatsu very ingeniously by the Veda, i.e. that part of it which teaches sacrifices and their rewards; the Guhya, i.e. the Âra<i>n</i>yaka, which teaches the worship of Brahman under various legendary aspects; and the Upanishads, which teach the knowledge of Brahman without qualities. These three divisions would correspond to the karmakâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a, yogakâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a, and <i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânakâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a (<i>G</i>aimini, Pata<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ali, Bâdarâyana). See Deussen, Vedânta, p. 20. Mr. Gough and Dr. Roer take Brahmayoni as 'the source of the Veda,' or as the source of Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha. The irregular form vedate may be due to a corruption of vedânte.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_821"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_823">257:1</a> Here begins the description of what is called the tvam (thou), as opposed to the tat (that), i.e. the living soul, as opposed to the Highest Brahman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_822"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_824">257:2</a> The paths of vice, virtue, and knowledge.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_823"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_825">257:3</a> Both MSS. (A. and B.) read ârâgramâtro by avaro 'pi d<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_824"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_826">257:4</a> An expression of frequent occurrence in Buddhist literature.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_825"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_827">257:5</a> A. and B. read yu<i>g</i>yate. A. explains yu<i>g</i>yate by sambadhyate. B. explains adyate bhakshyate tirobhûta<i>h</i> kriyate. <i>S</i>aṅkara explains rakshyate, sa<i>m</i>rakshyate, tattaddharmân âtmany adhyasyâbhimanyate.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_826"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_828">257:6</a> The MSS. vary considerably. Instead of mohair, A. and B. read homair. They read grâsâmbuv<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>ya <i>k</i>âtma. A. reads âtmaviv<i>ri</i>ddhi<i>g</i>anma, B. âtmaniv<i>ri</i>ddha<i>g</i>anmâ. A. has abhisamprapadye, B. abhisamprapadyate. My translation follows <i>S</i>aṅkara, who seems to have read âtmaviv<i>ri</i>ddhi<i>g</i>anma, taking the whole line <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></a> as a simile and in an adverbial form. Vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânâtman, however, differs considerably. He reads homai<i>h</i>, and explains homa as the act of throwing oblations into the fire, as in the Agnihotra. This action of the hands, he thinks, stands for all actions of the various members of the body. Grâsâmbuv<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i he takes to mean free distribution of food and drink, and then explains the whole sentence by 'he whose self is born unto some states or declines from them again, namely, according as he has showered food and drink, and has used his hands, eyes, feelings, and thoughts.' <i>S</i>aṅkarânanda takes a similar view, only he construes saṅkalpanam and spar<i>s</i>anam as two d<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>is, te eva d<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>î, tayor âtmâgnau prakshepâ homâ<i>h</i>; and then goes on, na kevalam etai<i>h</i>, ki<i>m</i> tv asmin sthâne <i>s</i>arire grâsâmbuv<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>yâ ka. He seems to read âtmaviv<i>ri</i>ddhaganmâ, but afterwards explains viv<i>ri</i>ddhi by vividhâ v<i>ri</i>ddhi<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_827"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_829">258:1</a> Forms as high as Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha or as low as beasts.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_828"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_830">258:2</a> Instead of aparo, B. reads avaro, but explains aparo.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_829"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_831">258:3</a> Cf. III, 7; IV, 14, 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_830"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_832">258:4</a> Nî<i>d</i>a is explained as the body, but <i>S</i>aṅkarânanda reads anilâkhyam, who is called the wind, as being prâ<i>n</i>asya prâ<i>n</i>am, the breath of the breath.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_831"></a><a href="sbe15104.htm#fr_833">259:1</a> <i>S</i>aṅkara explains kalâsargakaram by he who creates the sixteen kalâs, mentioned by the Âtharva<i>n</i>ikas, beginning with prâ<i>n</i>a, and ending with nâman; see Pra<i>s</i><i>ñ</i>a Up. VI, 4. Vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânâtman suggests two other explanations, 'he who creates by means of the kalâ, i.e. his inherent power;' or 'he who creates the Vedas and other sciences.' The sixteen kalâs are, according to <i>S</i>aṅkarânanda, prâ<i>n</i>a, <i>s</i>raddhâ, kha, vâyu, <i>g</i>yoti<i>h</i>, ap, p<i>ri</i>thivî, indriya, mana<i>h</i>, anna, vîrya, tapa<i>h</i>, mantra, karman, kâla (?), nâman.
