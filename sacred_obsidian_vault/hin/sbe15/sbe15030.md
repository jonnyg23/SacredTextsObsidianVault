 <p><a name="fn_209"></a><a href="sbe15030.htm#fr_209">51:1</a> This chapter is meant to show that knowledge alone, though it secures the highest object, is not sufficient by itself, but must be preceded by works. The learning of the Veda by heart and the practising of it so as not to forget it again, these two must always have been previously performed.</p>
