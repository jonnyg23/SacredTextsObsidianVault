 <p>1. Let him never turn away (a stranger) from his house, that is the rule. Therefore a man should by all means acquire much food, for (good) people say (to the stranger): 'There is food ready for him.' If he gives food amply, food is given to him amply. If he gives food fairly, food is given to him fairly. If he gives food meanly, food is given to him meanly.</p>  
 <p>2. He who knows this, (recognises and worships Brahman <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">2</font></a>) as possession in speech, as acquisition and possession in up-breathing (prâ<i>n</i>a) and down-breathing (apâna); as action in the hands; as walking in the feet; as voiding in the anus. These are the human recognitions (of Brahman as manifested in human actions). Next follow the recognitions (of</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Brahman) with reference to the Devas, viz. as satisfaction in rain; as power in lightning;</p>  
 <p>3. As glory in cattle; as light in the stars; as procreation, immortality, and bliss in the member; as everything in the ether. Let him worship that (Brahman) as support, and he becomes supported. Let him worship that (Brahman) as greatness (maha<i>h</i>), and he becomes great. Let him worship that (Brahman) as mind, and he becomes endowed with mind.</p>  
 <p>4. Let him worship that (Brahman) as adoration, and all desires fall down before him in adoration. Let him worship that (Brahman) as Brahman, and he will become possessed of Brahman. Let him worship this as the absorption of the gods <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">1</font></a> in Brahman, and the enemies who hate him will die all around him, all around him will die the foes whom he does not love.</p>  
 <p>He <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">2</font></a> who is this (Brahman) in man, and he who is that (Brahman) in the sun, both are one.</p>  
 <p>5. He who knows this, when he has departed this world, after reaching and comprehending the Self which consists of food, the Self which consists of breath, the Self which consists of mind, the Self which consists of understanding, the Self which consists of bliss, enters and takes possession of these worlds, and having as much food as he likes, and assuming as many forms as he likes, he sits down singing this Sâman (of Brahman): 'Hâvu, hâvu, hâvu!</p>

 <p>6. 'I am food (object), I am food, I am food! I am the eater of food (subject), I am the eater of food, I am the eater of food! I am the poet (who joins the two together), I am the poet, I am the poet! I am the first-born of the Right (<i>ri</i>ta). Before the Devas I was in the centre of all that is immortal. He who gives me away, he alone preserves me: him who eats food, I eat as food.</p>  
 <p>'I overcome the whole world, I, endowed with golden light <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He who knows this, (attains all this).' This is the Upanishad <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>
