 <p align="center">(Astika Parva continued)</p>  
 <p>"Sauti said, 'O ascetic, about this time the two sisters saw approaching near, that steed of complacent appearance named Uchchaihsravas who was worshipped by the gods, that gem of steeds, who arose at the churning of the Ocean for nectar. Divine, graceful, perpetually young, creation's master-piece, and of irresistible vigour, it was blest with every auspicious mark.'</p>  
 <p>"Saunaka asked, 'Why did the gods churn the Ocean for nectar, and under what circumstances and when as you say, did that best of steeds so powerful and resplendent spring?'</p>  
 <p>"Sauti said, 'There is a mountain named <i>Meru</i>, of blazing appearance, and looking like a heap of effulgence. The rays of the Sun falling on its</p>

 <p>peaks of golden lustre are dispersed by them. Decked with gold and exceedingly beautiful, that mountain is the haunt of the gods and the <i>Gandharvas</i>. It is immeasurable and unapproachable by men of manifold sins. Dreadful beasts of prey wander over its breasts, and it is illuminated by many divine life-giving herbs. It stands kissing the heavens by its height and is the first of mountains. Ordinary people cannot even think of ascending it. It is graced with trees and streams, and resounds with the charming melody of winged choirs. Once the celestials sat on its begemmed peak--in conclave. They who had practised penances and observed excellent vows for <i>amrita</i> now seemed to be eager seekers alter <i>amrita</i> (celestial ambrosia). Seeing the celestial assembly in anxious mood Nara-yana said to Brahman, 'Do thou churn the Ocean with the gods and the <i>Asuras</i>. By doing so, <i>amrita</i> will be obtained as also all drugs and gems. O ye gods, chum the Ocean, ye will discover <i>amrita</i>.'"</p>  
 <p>So ends the seventeenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.</p>
