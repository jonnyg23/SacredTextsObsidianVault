 <p align="center">(Astika Parva continued)</p>  
 <p>"Sauti said, 'That Brahmana of rigid vows then wandered over the earth for a wife but a wife found he not. One day he went into the forest, and recollecting the words of his ancestors, he thrice prayed in a faint voice for a bride. Thereupon Vasuki rose and offered his sister for the <i>Rishi's</i> acceptance. But the Brahmana hesitated to accept her, thinking her not to be of the same name with himself. The high-souled Jaratkaru thought within himself, 'I will take none for wife who is not of the same name with myself.' Then that <i>Rishi</i> of great wisdom and austere penances asked him, saying, 'Tell me truly what is the name of this thy sister, O snake.'</p>  
 <p>"Vasuki replied, 'O Jaratkaru, this my younger sister is called Jaratkaru. Given away by me, accept this slender-waisted damsel for thy spouse. O best of Brahmanas, for thee I reserved her. Therefore, take her.' Saying this, he offered his beautiful sister to Jaratkaru who then espoused her with ordained rites.'"</p>  
 <p>So ends the thirteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.</p>
