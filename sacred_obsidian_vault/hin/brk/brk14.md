 <p>§ 11. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brahma is Thought</span>.—The Vedic <i>brahma,</i> "prayer" or "spell," is naturally a function</p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>of intellect; and when it had risen to the rank of a cosmic Force, it retained this character. It is the universal subject of thought; but as it is itself the universe, and there is nothing beside, it is also its own object, like the Aristotelian νόησις νοήσεως; and as it is above the conditions of space, time, and causality, we can say of it only that it <i>exists,</i> and is <i>Thought.</i></p>  
 <p>Frequently, from the natural tendency to conceive a higher sphere of existence as a realm of light and thought as itself light, Brahma and the individual Self identified with it are described as supreme self-luminous light: B.A. IV. iv. 16, Ch. VIII. iii. 4, XII. 3, Kaṭh. v. 15, Śvet. VI. 14.</p>
