He had a wife who was possessed by a spirit <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">2</font></a>; we asked him who he was, and he answered that he was Kabandha Ātharvaṇa, and said to Patanchala Kāpya and to the students of sacrifice, "Knowest thou, Kāpya, that Thread whereby this world and the world beyond and all creatures are bound together?" "Nay, my lord," said Patanchala Kāpya, "I know it not." Then he said to Patanchala Kāpya and the students of sacrifice, "Knowest thou, Kāpya, that Inward Ruler who rules inwardly this world and the world beyond and all creatures?" "Nay, my lord," said Patanchala Kāpya, "I know him not." Then he said to Patanchala Kāpya and the students of sacrifice, "Verily, Kāpya, he who should know that Thread and that Inward Ruler knows Brahma, knows the worlds, knows the Vedas, knows the creatures, knows the Self, knows the All." This he said to them: this I know. If thou, Yājnavalkya, shalt drive home the Brahman's cows without knowing that Thread and that Inward Ruler, thy head shall split." <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>"Truly, Gautama," said he, "the wind is that Thread; for by the wind as thread, Gautama, this world and the world beyond and all creatures are bound together. Therefore, Gautama, they say of a man who has died that his limbs are relaxed; for by the wind as thread, Gautama, were they bound together."</p>  
 <p>"It is so, Yājnavalkya. Tell of the Inward Ruler."</p>
