 <p>NOR earth nor water, fire nor liquid air,<br> Nor ether, nor the powers, nor these in one;<br> Undifferentiated, in dreamless perfect rest,<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Nor castes nor their divisions, rite nor rule,<br> Are mine, nor fixing mind and thought and mood;<br> No longer dreaming things not Self art 'I' and 'mine,'<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Nor mother, father, nor the gods and worlds,<br> Nor Scriptures, offerings, shrines are there, they say,<br> In dreamlessness abandoned by the lonely Self;<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Nor sectary of Cause or Lord or Life<br> Knows That, nor follower of Saint or Rite,<br> In perfect union, pure of all but Self,<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Nor upward, downward, nor within, without;<br> Nor midward, backward, That, nor east nor west;<br> All-present everywhere in partless unity,<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Nor white nor black nor yellow, That, nor red;<br> Nor small nor very great nor short nor long;<br> Formless, yet like a light, a star;<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I. <a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>Nor teacher, teaching, learner, what is learned;<br> Nor thou nor I nor this expanded world;<br> Conscious of its own form, from error free,<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Nor waking, mine, nor dream, nor dreamless sleep;<br> Nor fire of life or heart or seeing soul;<br> These three are of unwisdom; but the fourth,<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Even expanded for the sake of Self--<br> Self, that, still perfect, on no other rests--<br> All the wide world besides is little worth.<br> That, the One, final, blest, alone, am I.</p>  
 <p>Nor is this first with any second to it;<br> Nor lonely this, nor yet has it compeers;<br> Nor is this secondless One void or filled with aught;<br> How shall I tell this perfect wisdom's crowd?</p>
