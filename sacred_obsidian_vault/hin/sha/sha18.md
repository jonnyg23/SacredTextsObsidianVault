 <p><i>The Seasons</i> is an unpretentious poem, describing in six short cantos the six seasons into which the Hindus divide the year. The title is perhaps a little misleading, as the description is not objective, but deals with the feelings awakened by each season in a pair of young lovers. Indeed, the poem might be called a Lover's Calendar. Kalidasa's authorship has been doubted, without very cogent argument. The question is not of much interest, as <i>The Seasons</i> would neither add greatly to his reputation nor subtract from it.</p>  
 <p>The whole poem contains one hundred and forty-four stanzas, or something less than six hundred lines of verse. There follow a few stanzas selected from each canto.</p>  <h3 align="center">SUMMER</h3>  
 <p></p><dir>Pitiless heat from heaven pours<br>   By day, but nights are cool;<br> Continual bathing gently lowers<br>   The water in the pool;<br> The evening brings a charming peace:<br>   For summer-time is here<br> When love that never knows surcease,<br>   Is less imperious, dear.  
 <p>Yet love can never fall asleep;<br>   For he is waked to-day<br> By songs that all their sweetness keep<br>   And lutes that softly play,<br> By fans with sandal-water wet<br>   That bring us drowsy rest,<br> By strings of pearls that gently fret<br>   Full many a lovely breast.</p>  
 <p>The sunbeams like the fires are hot<br>   That on the altar wake; <a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a><br> The enmity is quite forgot<br>   Of peacock and of snake;<br> The peacock spares his ancient foe,<br>   For pluck and hunger fail;<br> He hides his burning head below<br>   The shadow of his tail.</p>  
 <p>Beneath the garland of the rays<br>   That leave no corner cool,<br> The water vanishes in haze<br>   And leaves a muddy pool;<br> The cobra does not hunt for food<br>   Nor heed the frog at all<br> Who finds beneath the serpent's hood<br>   A sheltering parasol.</p>  
 <p>Dear maiden of the graceful song,<br>   To you may summer's power<br> Bring moonbeams clear and garlands long<br>   And breath of trumpet-flower,<br> Bring lakes that countless lilies dot,<br>   Refreshing water-sprays,<br> Sweet friends at evening, and a spot<br>   Cool after burning days.</p></dir>  <h3 align="center">THE RAINS</h3>  
 <p></p><dir>The rain advances like a king<br>   In awful majesty;<br> Hear, dearest, how his thunders ring<br>   Like royal drums, and see<br> His lightning-banners wave; a cloud<br>   For elephant he rides,<br> And finds his welcome from the crowd<br>   Of lovers and of brides.  
 <p>The clouds, a mighty army, march<br>   With drumlike thundering<br> And stretch upon the rainbow's arch<br>   The lightning's flashing string; <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a><br> The cruel arrows of the rain<br>   Smite them who love, apart<br> From whom they love, with stinging pain,<br>   And pierce them to the heart.</p>  
 <p>The forest seems to show its glee<br>   In flowering nipa plants;<br> In waving twigs of many a tree<br>   Wind-swept, it seems to dance;<br> Its ketak-blossom's opening sheath<br>   Is like a smile put on<br> To greet the rain's reviving breath,<br>   Now pain and heat are gone.</p>  
 <p>To you, dear, may the cloudy time<br>   Bring all that you desire,<br> Bring every pleasure, perfect, prime,<br>   To set a bride on fire;<br> May rain whereby life wakes and shines<br>   Where there is power of life,<br> The unchanging friend of clinging vines,<br>   Shower blessings on my wife.</p></dir>  <h3 align="center">AUTUMN</h3>  
 <p></p><dir>The autumn comes, a maiden fair<br>   In slenderness and grace,<br> With nodding rice-stems in her hair<br>   And lilies in her face.<br> In flowers of grasses she is clad;<br>   And as she moves along,<br> Birds greet her with their cooing glad<br>   Like bracelets' tinkling song.  
 <p>A diadem adorns the night<br>   Of multitudinous stars;<br> Her silken robe is white moonlight,<br>   Set free from cloudy bars;<br> And on her face (the radiant moon)<br>   Bewitching smiles are shown: <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a><br> She seems a slender maid, who soon<br>   Will be a woman grown.</p>  
 <p>Over the rice-fields, laden plants<br>   Are shivering to the breeze;<br> While in his brisk caresses dance<br>   The blossom-burdened trees;<br> He ruffles every lily-pond<br>   Where blossoms kiss and part,<br> And stirs with lover's fancies fond<br>   The young man's eager heart.</p></dir>  <h3 align="center">WINTER</h3>  
 <p></p><dir>The bloom of tenderer flowers is past<br>   And lilies droop forlorn,<br> For winter-time is come at last,<br>   Rich with its ripened corn;<br> Yet for the wealth of blossoms lost<br>   Some hardier flowers appear<br> That bid defiance to the frost<br>   Of sterner days, my dear.  
 <p>The vines, remembering summer, shiver<br>   In frosty winds, and gain<br> A fuller life from mere endeavour<br>   To live through all that pain;<br> Yet in the struggle and acquist<br>   They turn as pale and wan<br> As lonely women who have missed<br>   Known love, now lost and gone.</p>  
 <p>Then may these winter days show forth<br>   To you each known delight,<br> Bring all that women count as worth<br>   Pure happiness and bright;<br> While villages, with bustling cry,<br>   Bring home the ripened corn,<br> And herons wheel through wintry sky,<br>   Forget sad thoughts forlorn.</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">EARLY SPRING</h3>  
 <p></p><dir>Now, dearest, lend a heedful ear<br>   And listen while I sing<br> Delights to every maiden dear,<br>   The charms of early spring:<br> When earth is dotted with the heaps<br>   Of corn, when heron-scream<br> Is rare but sweet, when passion leaps<br>   And paints a livelier dream.  
 <p>When all must cheerfully applaud<br>   A blazing open fire;<br> Or if they needs must go abroad,<br>   The sun is their desire;<br> When everybody hopes to find<br>   The frosty chill allayed<br> By garments warm, a window-blind<br>   Shut, and a sweet young maid.</p>  
 <p>Then may the days of early spring<br>   For you be rich and full<br> With love's proud, soft philandering<br>   And many a candy-pull,<br> With sweetest rice and sugar-cane:<br>   And may you float above<br> The absent grieving and the pain<br>   Of separated love.</p></dir>  <h3 align="center">SPRING</h3>  
 <p></p><dir>A stalwart soldier comes, the spring,<br>   Who bears the bow of Love;<br> And on that bow, the lustrous string<br>   Is made of bees, that move<br> With malice as they speed the shaft<br>   Of blossoming mango-flower<br> At us, dear, who have never laughed<br>   At love, nor scorned his power. <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a>  
 <p>Their blossom-burden weights the trees; <br>   The winds in fragrance move;<br> The lakes are bright with lotuses,<br>   The women bright with love;<br> The days are soft, the evenings clear<br>   And charming; everything<br> That moves and lives and blossoms, dear,<br>   Is sweeter, in the spring.</p>  
 <p>The groves are beautifully bright<br>   For many and many a mile<br> With jasmine-flowers that are as white<br>   As loving woman's smile:<br> The resolution of a saint<br>   Might well be tried by this;<br> Far more, young hearts that fancies paint<br>   With dreams of loving bliss.</p></dir>
