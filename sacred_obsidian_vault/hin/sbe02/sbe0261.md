 <p><a name="fn_760"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_761">163:2</a> According to Haradatta the king's body represents the post (yûpa), his soul the sacrificial animal, the recovered property the reward for the priests or fee.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_761"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_762">163:3</a> Manu VII, 89; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 323, 324.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_763"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_764">163:6</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. II, 271-272. A yo<i>g</i>ana is a distance of 4 kro<i>s</i>a, kos.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_764"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_765">163:7</a> A kro<i>s</i>a, kos, or gâu, literally 'the lowing of a cow,' is variously reckoned at 1½-4 miles.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_765"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_766">163:8</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 272. This law is, with certain modifications, still in force. See Bombay Regulations, XII, 27 par.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_766"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_767">164:9</a> According to Haradatta, who quotes Gautama in his commentary, the <i>s</i>ulka is the 1/20th part of a merchant's gains. On account of the Sûtras immediately following, it is, however, more probable that the term is here used as a synonym of 'kara,' and includes all taxes. 'Lawful' taxes are, of course, those sanctioned by custom and approved of by the Sm<i>ri</i>tis.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_767"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_768">164:10</a> Manu VII, 133.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_768"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_769">164:11</a> Haradatta thinks that the rule applies to women of the Anuloma, the pure castes, only.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_769"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_770">164:14</a> 'Why does be say "intent on fulfilling the holy law?" Those shall not be free from taxes who perform austerities in order to make their magic charms efficacious.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_770"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_771">164:18</a> The ornaments would indicate that he was bent on mischief. Compare above, I, 11, 32, 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_771"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_772">165:19</a> 'The punishment must be proportionate to his property and the greatness of his offence. The term "with a bad purpose" is added, because he who has been sent by his teacher (to such a place) should not be punished.'--Haradatta. Manu VIII, 354; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. II, 284.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_772"></a><a href="sbe0261.htm#fr_773">165:24</a> 'I.e. a married woman to her husband or father-in-law an unmarried damsel to her father or to her brother.'--Haradatta.</p>
