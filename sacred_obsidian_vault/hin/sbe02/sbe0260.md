 <p>1. The general and special duties of all castes have been explained. But we will now declare those of a king in particular.</p>  
 <p>2. He shall cause to be built a town and a palace, the gates of both of which (must look) towards the south.</p>  
 <p>3. The palace (shall stand) in the heart of the town. <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. In front of that (there shall be) a hall. That is called the hall of invitation.</p>  
 <p>5. (At a little distance) from the town to the south, (he shall cause to be built) an assembly-house with doors on the south and on the north sides, so that one can see what passes inside and outside.</p>  
 <p>6. In all (these three places) fires shall burn constantly. <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. And oblations must be offered in these fires daily, just as at the daily sacrifice of a householder. <a name="fr_753"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. In the hall he shall put up his guests, at least those who are learned in the Vedas. <a name="fr_754"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p>9. Rooms, a couch, food and drink should be given to them according to their good qualities.</p>  
 <p>10. Let him not live better than his Gurus or ministers. <a name="fr_755"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. And in his realm no (Brâhma<i>n</i>a) should suffer hunger, sickness, cold, or heat, be it through want, or intentionally. <a name="fr_756"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. In the midst of the assembly-house, (the superintendent of the house) shall raise a play-table and sprinkle it with water, turning his hand downwards, and place on it dice in even numbers, made of Vibhîtaka (wood), as many as are wanted.</p>  
 <p>13. Men of the first three castes, who are pure and truthful, may be allowed to play there. <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Assaults of arms, dancing, singing, music, and the like (performances) shall be held only (in the houses) of the king's servants. <a name="fr_758"></a><a href="#fn_757"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. That king only takes care of the welfare of his subjects in whose dominions, be it in villages or forests, there is no danger from thieves. <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_758"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>
