 <p>5. (The additional share) of the eldest (son consists of) a twentieth part (of the estate), a male and a female (of animals with one row of front teeth, such as cows), a carriage yoked with animals that have two rows of front teeth, (and) a bull. <a name="fr_1487"></a><a href="#fn_1486"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p>9. Or let the eldest have two shares, <a name="fr_1491"></a><a href="#fn_1490"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>

 <p>49. They declare, that an assembly (parishad, shall consist) at least (of the ten following (members, viz.) four men who have completely studied the four Vedas, three men belonging to the (three) orders enumerated first, (and) three men who know (three) different (institutes of) law. <a name="fr_1527"></a><a href="#fn_1526"><font size="1">49</font></a></p>

 <p>51. For such a man is incapable of (unjustly) injuring or (unjustly) favouring created beings.</p>  
 <p>52. He who knows the sacred law obtains heavenly bliss, more than (other) righteous men, on account of his knowledge of, and his adherence to it.</p>  
 <p>53. Thus the sacred law (has been explained).</p>

Haradatta remarks that, according to Gautama, the sons alone shall divide the estate, and that the mother is not to receive a share, as other teachers, e.g. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 123, prescribe. Âpastamba II, 6, 13, 2 Manu IX, 104; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 117.</p>

Or the sons may divide the estate even during the lifetime of the father; when be desires it, i.e. by his permission. The time for such a (division is) when the mother is past child-bearing.'--Haradatta. The correctness of this interpretation of our Sûtra is corroborated by the exclusion of sons who have divided the family estate against the father's will (XV, 19) from the <i>S</i>râddha dinner. Âpastamba II, 6, 14, 1.</p>

After division each brother has to perform the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva and the other domestic ceremonies separately, while in a united family they are performed by the eldest brother. Thus a division of the family estate causes an increase of spiritual merit; see also Manu XI, III.</p>

The singular number (is used to denote) the species, (and the explanation is), "As many sheep as there are." For (the possession of) one would follow already from the phrase, "And one of each kind of animals." Another (commentator says), "Though the father may possess one sheep only, still it belongs to the youngest, and the phrase 'one of each kind of animals' refers to the case when there are many." . . . This (additional share is that) belonging to the youngest. (If there are more than three sons) the others obtain the share of the middle most.'--Haradatta.</p>

The residue of the estate <a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a> goes to the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as. If it is here stated that the son of an appointed daughter receives, even on failure of a legitimate son, a fourth part of the estate only, that refers to the son of an appointed daughter of lower caste, i.e. to a son who is born, when somebody makes the daughter of a wife of lower caste his appointed daughter, and does that by intent only.'--Haradatta.</p>

'What is exclusive of the additional share of the eldest, which has been declared above, Sûtra 5, (that) other (part) he shall obtain. The verb must be understood from the context. Regarding a son by a Kshatriya wife who is the eldest, but destitute of good qualities, the Mânava Dharma-<i>s</i>âstra declares (IX, 152-153), "Or (if no deduction be made)," &amp;c.'--Haradatta. The sense in which the Sûtra has been taken above, agrees with the explanation of the Ratnâkara adduced in the Digest loc. cit., though the reading of the text followed there seems to be different.</p>
