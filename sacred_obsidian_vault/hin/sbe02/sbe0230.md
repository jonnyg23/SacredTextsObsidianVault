 <p>1. After having eaten sesamum or having fasted on the full moon day of the month Srâva<i>n</i>a July-August), he may on the following day bathe in the water of a great river and offer (a burnt-oblation of) one thousand pieces of sacred fuel, whilst. reciting the Gâyatrî, or he may mutter (the Gâyatrî) as many times. <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Or he may perform Ish<i>t</i>is and Soma-sacrifices for the sake of purifying himself (from his sins), <a name="fr_486"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. After having eaten forbidden food, he must fast, until his entrails are empty. <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_486"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. That is (generally) attained after seven days.</p>

 <p>season (November-March) bathe in cold water both morning and evening.</p>  
 <p>6. Or he may perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance, which lasts twelve days.</p>  
 <p>7. The rule for the K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance of twelve days (is the following): For three days he must not eat in the evening, and then for three days not in the morning; for three days he must live on food which has been given unasked, and three days he must not eat anything. <a name="fr_488"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. If he repeats this for a year, that is called a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance, which lasts for a year.</p>  
 <p>9. Now follows another penance. He who has committed even a great many sins which do not cause him to fall, becomes free from guilt, if, fasting, he recites the entire <i>S</i>âkhâ of his Veda three times consecutively. <a name="fr_489"></a><a href="#fn_488"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. He who cohabits with a non-Aryan woman, he who lends money at interest, he who drinks (other) spirituous liquors (than Surâ), he who praises everybody in a manner unworthy of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, shall sit on grass, allowing his back to be scorched (by the sun).</p>  
 <p>11. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a removes the sin which he committed by serving one day and night (a man of) the black race, if he bathes for three years, eating at every fourth meal-time. <a name="fr_490"></a><a href="#fn_489"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>
