 <p>7. Also, if he has been bitten by (one of the animals mentioned) above (Sûtras 4-5). <a name="fr_1425"></a><a href="#fn_1424"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p>12. (The guilt of him who has intercourse) with the wife of a friend, a sister, a female belonging to the same family, the wife of a pupil, a daughter-in-law, or with a cow, is as great as that of (him who violates his Guru's) bed. <a name="fr_1427"></a><a href="#fn_1426"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. Some (declare, that the guilt of such a sinner is equal to) that of a student who breaks the vow of chastity. <a name="fr_1428"></a><a href="#fn_1427"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>

 <p>30. But (that is) certainly not (the case) when (the untruth) concerns a Guru.</p>

Haradatta, remarks that other twice-born men also must perform the same penance in case they drink liquor forbidden to them, see above, II, 20 note. He also states that the offence must have been committed intentionally and repeatedly in order to justify so severe an expiation. Regarding the effect of the purification after death, see above, XX, 16.</p>

My best MSS. read ghâtayet, 'shall cause to be killed,' instead of Professor Stenzler's khâdayet, 'shall cause to be devoured.' C. has khâdayet, but its commentary, as well as that given in the other MSS., shows that ghâtayet is the correct reading. The text of the commentary runs as follows: Anantaroktavishaye gata<i>h</i> pumân râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>â ghâtayitvyo [khâdayitavyo C.] vadhaprakâra<i>s</i><i>k</i>ânantaram eva vasish<i>th</i>ava<i>k</i>ane dar<i>s</i>ita<i>h</i>. The passages of Vasish<i>th</i>a XXI, 1-3, which Haradatta has quoted in explanation of Sûtra 14, prescribe that the adulterer is to be burnt. Another objection to the reading khâdayet is that the word would be superfluous. If Gautama had intended to prescribe the same punishment for the adulterer as for the woman, he would simply have said pumâ<i>m</i>sam.</p>
