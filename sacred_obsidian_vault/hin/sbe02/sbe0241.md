 <p>1. If he has any doubts regarding the caste and conduct of a person who has come to him in order to fulfil his duty (of learning the Veda), he shall kindle a fire (with the ceremonies prescribed for kindling the sacrificial fire) and ask him about his caste and conduct. <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. If he declares himself to be (of) good (family and conduct, the teacher elect) shall say, 'Agni who sees, Vâyu who hears, Âditya who brings to light, vouch for his goodness; may it be well with this person! He is free from sin.' Then he shall begin to teach him.</p>  
 <p>3. A guest comes to the house resembling a burning fire. <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. He is called a <i>S</i>rotriya who, observing the law (of studentship), has learned one recension of the Veda (which may be current in his family). <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. He is called a guest (who, being a <i>S</i>rotriya), approaches solely for the fulfilment of his religious duties, and with no other object, a householder who lives intent on the fulfilment of his duties. <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. The reward for honouring (such a guest) is immunity from misfortunes, and heavenly bliss. <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. He shall go to meet such (a guest), honour him according to his age (by the formulas of salutation prescribed), and cause a seat to be given to him.</p>  
 <p>8. Some declare that, if possible, the seat should have many feet. <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. The (householder himself) shall wash the feet of that (guest); according to some, two <i>S</i>ûdras shall do it.</p>  
 <p>10. One of them shall be employed in pouring water (over the guest, the other in washing his feet).</p>  
 <p>11. Some declare that the water for the (guest) shall be brought in an earthen vessel. <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. But (a guest) who has not yet returned home from his teacher shall not be a cause for fetching water. <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. In case a (student comes, the host) shall repeat the Veda (together with him) for a longer time (than with other guests).</p>  
 <p>14. He shall converse kindly (with his guest), and gladden him with milk or other (drinks), with eatables, or at least with water.</p>  
 <p>15. He shall offer to his guest a room, a bed, a mattress, a pillow with a cover, and ointment, and what else (may be necessary). <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. (If the dinner has been finished before the arrival of the guest), he shall call his cook and give him rice or yava for (preparing a fresh meal for) the guest. <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. (If dinner is ready at the arrival of the guest), he himself shall portion out the food and look at it, saying (to himself), 'Is this (portion) greater, or this?'</p>  
 <p>18. He shall say, 'Take out a larger (portion for the guest).'</p>  
 <p>19. A guest who is at enmity (with his host) shall not eat his food, nor (shall he eat the food of a host) who hates him or accuses him of a crime, or of one who is suspected of a crime. <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. For it is declared in the Veda that he (who eats the food of such a person) eats his guilt.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_581"></a><a href="sbe0241.htm#fr_582">114:1</a> <b>6</b>. The person desirous to study addresses his teacher elect with the following Mantra: Bhagavan maitre<i>n</i>a <i>k</i>akshushâ pa<i>s</i>ya <i>s</i>ivena manasânug<i>ri</i>hâ<i>n</i>a prasîda mâm adhyâpaya, 'venerable Sir, look on me with a friendly eye, receive me with a favourable mind, be kind and teach me.' The teacher elect then asks: Ki<i>m</i>gotro ’si saumya, kimâ<i>k</i>âra<i>h</i>, 'friend, of what family art thou? what is thy rule of conduct?'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_582"></a><a href="sbe0241.htm#fr_583">114:3</a> The object of this Sûtra is to show the absolute necessity of feeding a guest. For, if offended, he might burn the house with the flames of his anger.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="sbe0241.htm#fr_584">115:4</a> The object of this Sûtra is to complete the definition of the term 'guest' to be given in the following Sûtra. In my translation I have followed Haradatta's gloss. The literal sense of Âpastamba's words is,. 'He who, observing the law, has studied one recension of each (of the four) Vedas, becomes a <i>S</i>rotriya.' Haradatta says this definition would be contrary to the current acceptation of the term. That argument proves, however, nothing for Âpastamba's times.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="sbe0241.htm#fr_587">115:8</a> Haradatta states that this is also Âpastamba's opinion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_587"></a><a href="sbe0241.htm#fr_588">115:11</a> According to Haradatta, Âpastamba is of opinion that it should be brought in a pot made of metal.</p>
