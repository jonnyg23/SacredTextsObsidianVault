 <p><a name="fn_1329"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1330">270:1</a> <b>XVIII</b>. Manu V, 155. This Sûtra refers in the first instance to the inability of wives to offer on their own account <i>S</i>rauta or G<i>ri</i>hya-sacrifices, or to perform vows and religious ceremonies prescribed in the Purâ<i>n</i>as, without the permission of their husbands. As the word strî means both wife and woman, its ulterior meaning is, that women in general are never independent; see Manu V, 148; IX, 3; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya 1, 85.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1330"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1331">270:2</a> Âpastamba II, 10, 27, 6; Manu IX, 102.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1331"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1332">270:3</a> Manu V, 166; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 87.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1332"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1333">270:4</a> Âpastamba II, 10, 27, 2-3; Manu IX, 59-60; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 68. Apati, 'she whose husband is dead,' means literally, 'she who has no husband.' But as the case of a woman whose husband has gone abroad, is discussed below, it follows that the former translation alone is admissible. It must, of course, be understood that the widow has no children.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1333"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1334">271:5</a> The Gurus are here the husband's relatives, under whose protection the widow lives.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1334"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1335">271:6</a> Regarding the term Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a, see above, XIV, 13; a Sagotra is a relative bearing the same family name (laukika gotra) removed seven to thirteen degrees, or still further. A Samânapravara is one who is descended from the same <i>Ri</i>shi (vaidika gotra).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1335"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1336">271:8</a> Colebrooke V, Digest 265. Haradatta explains atidvitîya, 'not more than two (sons),' to mean 'not more than one son' (prathamam apatyam atîtya dvitîyam na <i>g</i>anayed iti). But see Manu IX, 61.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1336"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1337">271:9</a> Âpastamba II, 6, 13, 6-7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1337"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1338">271:10</a> Manu IX, 52.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1338"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1339">271:11</a> Manu IX, 145. Such a son is called Kshetra<i>g</i>a, see below, XXVIII, 32.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1339"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1340">271:12</a> Manu IX, 144.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1340"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1341">271:13</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 127. Such a son is called dvipit<i>ri</i> or dvyâmushyâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1341"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1342">272:15</a> Manu IX, 76. 'When the husband has disappeared, i.e. has gone to a foreign country, his wife, though childless, shall wait for six years. After (the lapse of) that (period) she may, if she desires it, produce a child (by cohabiting with a Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a), after having been authorised thereto by her Gurus. If the husband is heard of, i.e. that he dwells in such and such a country, she shall go to him.'--Haradatta. Kshapa<i>n</i>a, 'waiting,' is ambiguous, and may also mean being continent or emaciating herself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1342"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1343">272:17</a> I.e. before she goes to live with a Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a, or tries to follow her husband, in case his residence is known.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1343"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1344">272:20</a> Manu IX, 90-92; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 64.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1344"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1345">272:21</a> Manu IX, 88.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1345"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1346">272:22</a> Manu IX, 4; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 64. 'He who,' i.e. the father or guardian.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1346"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1347">273:24</a> Manu XI, 11, 13. Haradatta explains dharmatantra, 'a rite prescribed by the sacred law,' here, as well as Sûtra 32, by 'the means,' i.e. a sacrificial animal and the like required by one who is engaged in performing a sacred duty, i.e. a Pa<i>s</i>ubandha-sacrifice and the like.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1347"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1348">273:25</a> Manu XI, 12. 26-27. Manu XI, 14.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1348"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1349">273:28</a> Manu XI, 16; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya III, 43-</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1349"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1350">273:30</a> Manu XI, 7; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya III, 43-44.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1350"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1351">273:31</a> Manu XI, 21-22. Haradatta adds that a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who acts thus, must, of course, not be punished.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1351"></a><a href="sbe0282.htm#fr_1352">274:32</a> Haradatta refers this Sûtra to the case where 'a sacrificial animal or other requisites for a sacrifice are stolen from a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. It seems, however, more probable that it refers to the duty of the king to prevent, by all means in his power, a violation of the sacred duty to perform <i>S</i>rauta-sacrifices, and that it is intended to prescribe that he is to assist a man who is engaged in them and too poor to finish them.</p>
