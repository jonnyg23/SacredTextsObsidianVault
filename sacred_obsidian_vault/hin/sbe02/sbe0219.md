 <p><a name="fn_357"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_358">57:1</a> <b>16</b>. Haradatta takes â<i>k</i>am here to mean 'to drink water,' and thinks that it is forbidden to do this standing or in a bent position. Others refer the prohibition to 'sipping water for the sake of purification,' and translate, 'He shall not sip water standing or in a bent position (except in case of necessity),' i.e. if the bank of the river is so high that he cannot reach the water sitting down, and in this case he shall enter it up to his thighs or up to his navel.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_358"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_359">57:2</a> Manu II, 60 and 62; V, 139; and Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 20 and 27; Weber. Ind. Stud. X, 165. Haradatta observes, that the further particulars regarding purification by sipping water must be supplied from other Sm<i>ri</i>tis. The rule quoted by him is as follows: 'The performer should be sitting in a pure place, not on a seat, except when sipping water after dinner, and should sip thrice from his hand water which is free from bubbles and foam, and which he has attentively regarded, in such a quantity as would cover a Mâsha-bean. <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a> The water sipped by a Brahman should reach his heart, that sipped by a Kshatriya the throat, and that sipped by a Vai<i>s</i>ya the palate. A <i>S</i>ûdra sips once as much as to wet his tongue.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_359"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_360">58:7</a> The eyes are to be touched with the thumb and the fourth finger, either at once, or one after the other, the nostrils with the thumb and the second finger, the ears with the thumb and the small finger.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_360"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_361">58:9</a> Manu V, 138.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_361"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_362">58:11</a> Haradatta observes that this Sûtra shows, that every other foreign substance brought with the food into the mouth, makes the food 'leavings' and the eater impure. Manu V, 141.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_362"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_363">58:12</a> Manu V, 141 declares sipping to be unnecessary in this case.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_363"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_364">59:14</a> Manu V, 145.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_364"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_365">59:18</a> The term "ten days" is used in order to indicate the time of impurity generally. In some cases, as that of a Kshatriya, this lasts longer. In other cases, where the impurity lasts thirty-six hours only, (the abstention from dining in such houses is shorter.)'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 217.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_365"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_366">59:19</a> A lying-in woman is impure, and must not be touched during the first ten days after her confinement. During this time, she exclusively occupies the Sûtikâg<i>ri</i>ha, or lying-in chamber. Manu IV, 217.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_366"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_367">59:20</a> Haradatta remarks that in the case of the death of a person who is not a relation, it is customary to place at the distance of 'one hundred bows' a lamp and water-vessel, and to eat (beyond that distance).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_367"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_368">60:21</a> 'Food which is simply impure, may be purified by putting it on the fire, sprinkling it with water, touching it with ashes or earth, and praising it.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_368"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_369">60:22</a> Others say, that the food becomes unfit for eating, only, if in bringing it, the <i>S</i>ûdra has touched it.--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_369"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_370">60:23</a> Manu IV, 207; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 167. 'But this rule holds good only if the hair had been cooked with the food. If a hair falls into it at dinner, then it is to be purified by an addition of clarified butter, and may be eaten.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_370"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_371">60:24</a> Haradatta quotes a passage from Baudhâyana, which enumerates as 'unclean things' here intended, 'hair, worms or beetles, nail-parings, excrements of rats.' The rule must be understood as the preceding, i.e. in case these things have been cooked with the food.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_371"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_372">60:26</a> Manu IV, 207: Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 167, 168. This Sûtra must be read with Sûtra 23 above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_372"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_373">60:30</a> Manu IV, 208; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 167. Apapâtras are persons whom one must not allow to eat from one's dishes, e.g. <i>K</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>âlas, Patitas, a woman in her courses or during the ten days of impurity after confinement. See also above, I, 1, 3, 25.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_373"></a><a href="sbe0219.htm#fr_374">61:32</a> Haradatta thinks, that as the Sûtra has the feminine gender, dâsî, it does not matter if a male slave brings the food. But others forbid also this.</p>
