'Though four (orders) are enumerated, he uses the word "four," lest, in the absence of a distinct rule of the venerable teacher, one order only, that of the householder, should be allowed, as has been taught in other Sm<i>ri</i>tis.'--Haradatta. Manu VI, 87.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_722"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_723">153:2</a> Manu VI, 88.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_723"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_724">153:3</a> Manu II, 247-249, and above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_724"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_725">153:8</a> The meaning of the Sûtra is, that the studentship is a necessary preliminary for the Sa<i>m</i>nyâsin. If a man considers sufficiently purified by his life in that order, he may become a Sa<i>m</i>nyâsin immediately after its completion. Otherwise he may first become a householder, or a hermit, and enter the last <a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a> order, when his passions are entirely extinct. See also Manu VI, 36; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. III, 56-57.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_725"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_726">154:10</a> Manu VI, 33, 42-45; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. III, 58 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_726"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_727">154:12</a> 'Another (commentator) says, "Some declare that he is free from all injunctions and prohibitions, i.e. he need neither perform nor avoid any (particular actions),"'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_727"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_728">154:13</a> 'He shall seek, i.e. worship, the Âtman or Self, which has been described in the section on transcendental knowledge (I, 8).'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_728"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_729">154:15</a> Haradatta apparently takes the word <i>S</i>âstras to mean 'Dharma<i>s</i>âstras.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_729"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_730">154:17</a> 'That which follows' are the Yogas, which must be employed in order to cause the annihilation of pain, after the knowledge of the Âtman or Self has been obtained.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_730"></a><a href="sbe0256.htm#fr_731">155:21</a> 'But which is that one fire? Certainly not the G<i>ri</i>hya-fire, because he must remain chaste. Therefore the meaning intended is, "He shall offer a Samidh morn and evening in the common fire, just as formerly, (during his studentship)." Another commentator says, "Gautama declares that he shall kindle a fire according to the rule of the <i>S</i>râmanaka Sûtra. The <i>S</i>râmanaka Sûtra is the Vaikhânasa Sûtra. Having kindled a fire in the manner prescribed there, he shall sacrifice in it every morning and every evening."'--Haradatta. See also Manu VI, 4; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. III, 45.</p>
