 <p>9. He shall run after him, if he runs.</p>  
 <p>10. He shall not approach (his teacher) with shoes on his feet, or his head covered, or holding (implements) in his hand.</p>  
 <p>11. But on a journey or occupied in work, he may approach him (with shoes on, with his head covered, or with implements in his hand),</p>  
 <p>12. Provided he does not sit down quite near (to his teacher).</p>  
 <p>13. He shall approach his teacher with the same reverence as a deity, without telling idle stories, attentive and listening eagerly to his words.</p>  
 <p>14. (He shall not sit near him). with his legs crossed.</p>  
 <p>15. If (on sitting down) the wind blows from the pupil towards the master, he shall change his place. <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. (He shall sit) without supporting himself with his hands (on the ground),</p>  
 <p>17. Without leaning against something (as a wall or the like).</p>  
 <p>18. If the pupil wears two garments, he shall wear the upper one after the fashion of the sacred thread at the sacrifices. <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. But, if he wears a (lower) garment only, he shall wrap it around the lower part of his body.</p>  
 <p>20. He shall turn his face towards his teacher though the latter does not turn his towards him. <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. He shall sit neither too near to, nor too far (from the teacher),</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. (But) at such a distance, that (the teacher) may be able to reach him with his arms (without rising).</p>  
 <p>23. (He shall not sit in such a position) that the wind blows from the teacher, towards himself. <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. (If there is) only one pupil, he shall sit at the right hand (of the teacher).</p>  
 <p>25. (If there are) many, (they may sit) as it may be convenient.</p>  
 <p>26. If the master (is not honoured with a seat and) stands, the (pupil) shall not sit down.</p>  
 <p>27. (If the master is not honoured with a couch) and sits, the (pupil) shall not lie down on a couch.</p>  
 <p>28. And if the teacher tries (to do something), then (the pupil) shall offer to do it for him, if it is in his power.</p>  
 <p>29. And, if his teacher is near, he shall not embrace (the feet of) another Guru who is inferior (in dignity), <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. Nor shall he praise (such a person in the teacher's presence) by (pronouncing the name of) his family.</p>  
 <p>31. Nor, shall he rise to meet such an (inferior Guru) or rise after him, <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. Even if he be a Guru of his teacher.</p>  
 <p>33. But he shall leave his place and his seat, (in order to show him honour.)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. Some say, that (he may address) a pupil of his teacher by (pronouncing) his name, if he is also one of his (the pupil's) own Gurus. <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">34</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. But towards such a person who is generally revered for some other reason than being the teacher (e.g. for his learning), the (student) should behave as towards his teacher, though he be inferior in dignity to the latter.</p>  
 <p>36. After having eaten in his (teacher's) presence, he shall not give away the remainder of the food without rising. <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>
