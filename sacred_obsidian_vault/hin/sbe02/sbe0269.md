But those he should zealously perform. As the oblations to the gods and the other (Mahâya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as) are mentioned before the kindling of the domestic fire, they must be performed by a person who has not yet kindled the domestic fire with the aid of the common (kitchen) fire.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_945"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_946">201:7</a> As long as the family remains united, its head offers the oblations for all its members.</p>

Now with the aid of which fire must a man, who has not yet kindled the domestic fire, perform the Pu<i>m</i>savana, &amp;c.? Some answer that he shall use a common fire. But the opinion of the teacher (Gautama) is that he shall use the sacred fire which has been kindled on that occasion.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_947"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_948">201:9</a> Haradatta states that the Mahâya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as are again enumerated in order to show that a person who has kindled the sacred fire shall use this for them, not a common fire. He also states that a passage of U<i>s</i>anas, according to which some teachers prescribe the performance of the daily recitation near the sacred fire, shows that this rite too has a connection with the sacred fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_948"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_949">202:10</a> Âpastamba II, 2, 3, 16, where, however, as in all other works, the order of the offerings differs. Haradatta adds that the word 'oblations' is used in the Sûtra in order to indicate that the word svâhâ must be pronounced at the end of each Mantra, and that the expression 'in the fire' indicates that the Bali-offerings described in the following Sûtra must be thrown on the ground.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_949"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_950">202:11</a> Compare Âpastamba II, 2, 3, 20-II, 2, 4, 8; Manu III, 87-90, where, as elsewhere, the order of the offerings differs. According to Haradatta the deities intended are, Indra, Agni, Yama, Nir<i>ri</i>ti, Varu<i>n</i>a, Vâyu, Soma, and Î<i>s</i>âna. The first offering must be placed to the east, the next to the south-east, south, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_950"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_951">202:12</a> At all the doors, as many as there are, a Bali must be offered with the Mantra, 'To the Maruts, svâhâ.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_951"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_952">202:13</a> 'As he says "inside" (pravi<i>s</i>ya, literally "entering") he must stand outside while offering the Balis at the doors. At this occasion some require the following Mantra, "To the deities of the dwelling, svâhâ," because that is found in the Â<i>s</i>valâyana (G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra I, 2, 4). Others consider it necessary to mention the deities by name, and to present as many offerings as there are deities, while pronouncing the required words.'--Haradatta. The commentator then goes on to quote a passage from U<i>s</i>anas, which he considers applicable, because it contains the names of the G<i>ri</i>hadevatâs. I doubt, however, if the 'others' are right, and still more if, in case they should be right, it would be advisable to supply the names of the G<i>ri</i>hadevatâs from U<i>s</i>anas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_952"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_953">203:14</a> 'Because the word "and" occurs in Sûtra 11 after the word "to the deities presiding over the points of the horizon" a Bali-offering must be presented to the deities mentioned by the author in Sûtra 10, viz. to the earth, wind, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and to all the gods, after a Bali has been offered to Brahman.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_953"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_954">203:16</a> 'The Bali presented to Âkâ<i>s</i>a, "the ether," must be thrown up into the air, as Manu says, III, 90.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_954"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_955">203:17</a> 'Because of the word "and," he must, also, present Balis to the deities mentioned above.'--Haradatta. The commentator means to say that in the evening not only the 'Beings walking about at night' (nakta<i>m</i><i>k</i>ara) are to receive a portion, but all the other deities too, and that the Balikarma must be offered twice a day.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_956"></a><a href="sbe0269.htm#fr_957">203:20</a> According to Haradatta the term <i>S</i>rotriya here denotes one who has studied one Veda, (but see also Âpastamba II, 3, 6, 4; II, 4, 8, 5.) Vedapâraga is a man who has studied one Veda, together with the Aṅgas, Kalpa-sûtras, and Upanishads.</p>

'Now he promulgates a Sûtra which refers to those cases where one must necessarily make gifts, and where one incurs guilt by a refusal. . . . As the expression "outside the Vedi" is used, presents must be given to others also "inside the Vedi" (i.e. fees to priests, &amp;c.)'--Haradatta.</p>
