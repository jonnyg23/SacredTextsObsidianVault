 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="sbe0210.htm#fr_221">26:12</a> The term va<i>m</i>sya, 'ancestor,' for the teacher's teacher is explained by the circumstance, that Hindus consider a 'school,' consisting of a succession of teachers and pupils, as a spiritual family, and call it a vidyâva<i>m</i>sa, vidyâparamparâ. Manu II, 205.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_221"></a><a href="sbe0210.htm#fr_222">26:13</a> 'Another (commentator) says, "He, the pupil, must embrace their feet (at every meeting) from that time (when he first saw his teacher do it)." Because the word "but" is used in the Sûtra, he must do so even after he has returned home (on completion of his studies).'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_222"></a><a href="sbe0210.htm#fr_223">27:14</a> 'More than one teacher,' i.e. several, who have taught him the several Vedas. Each Brahman generally knowing one Veda only.</p>  
 <p>This passage shows, that the young Brahmans in olden time, just as now, went from one teacher to the other, learning from each what he knew. The rules, which seemingly enjoin a pupil to stay with one and the same teacher, refer only to the principle, that the pupil must stay with his teacher, until he has learnt the subject which he began with him.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_227"></a><a href="sbe0210.htm#fr_228">28:26</a> See above, I, 1, 1, 13, and note. Here also Haradatta states that the permission to. leave the teacher is to be restricted to those who have not solemnly bound themselves to their teacher by allowing him to perform the ceremony of initiation.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_230"></a><a href="sbe0210.htm#fr_231">28:29</a> 'Because (an older fellow-student) is of use to him, according to the verse: One-fourth (of his learning) a pupil receives from his teacher, one-fourth he acquires by his own intelligence, one-fourth from his fellow students, one-fourth he is taught by time.'-- Haradatta.</p>
