 <p>1. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a declares, 'The daily recitation (of the Veda) is austerity.' <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. In the same (sacred text) it is also declared, Whether he recites the daily portion of the Veda standing, or sitting, or lying down, he performs austerity thereby; for the daily recitation is austerity.' <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. Now the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-brâhma<i>n</i>a declares also, 'The daily recitation is a sacrifice at which the Veda is offered. When it thunders, when lightning flashes or thunderbolts fall, and when the wind blows violently, these sounds take the place of the exclamations Vasha<i>t</i> (Vausha<i>t</i> and Svâhâ). Therefore he shall recite the Veda whilst it thunders, whilst lightning flashes and thunderbolts fall, and whilst the wind blows violently, lest the Vasha<i>t</i> (should be heard) in vain. <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. The conclusion of the passage from that (Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-brâhma<i>n</i>a is found) in another <i>S</i>âkhâ (of the Veda).</p>  
 <p>5. 'Now, if the wind blows, or if it thunders, or if lightning flashes, or thunderbolts fall, then he shall recite one <i>Ri</i>k-verse (in case he studies the Rig-Veda), or one Ya<i>g</i>us (in case he studies the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda), or one Sâman (in case he studies the Sâma-veda), or (without having a regard to his particular Veda, the following Ya<i>g</i>us), "Bhû<i>h</i> Bhuva<i>h</i>, Suva<i>h</i>, in faith I offer true devotion." Then, indeed, his daily recitation is accomplished thereby for that day.' <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. If that is done, (if the passage of the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-brâhma<i>n</i>a is combined with that quoted in Sûtra 5, the former stands) not in contradiction with the decision of the Âryas. <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. For they (who know the law) teach both the continuance and the interruption (of the daily recitation of the Veda). That would be meaningless, if one paid attention to the (passage of the) Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-brâhma<i>n</i>a (alone).</p>  
 <p>8. For no (worldly) motive for the decision of those Âryas is perceptible; (and hence it must have a religious motive and be founded on a passage of the Veda). <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. (The proper interpretation therefore is, that) the prohibition to study (given above and by the</p>

 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>Âryas generally) refers only to the repetition of the sacred texts in order to learn them, not to their application at sacrifices.</p>  
 <p>10. (But if you ask, why the decision of the Âryas presupposes the existence of a Vedic passage, then I answer): All precepts were (originally) taught in the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, (but) these texts have been lost. Their (former existence) may, however, be inferred from usage. <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. But it is not (permissible to infer the former existence of) a (Vedic) passage in cases where pleasure is obtained (by following a rule of the Sm<i>ri</i>ti or a custom). <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. He who follows such (usages) becomes fit for hell.</p>  
 <p>13. Now follow (some rites and) rules that have been declared in the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. By way of laudation they are called 'great sacrifices ' or 'great sacrificial sessions.' <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. (These rites include): The daily Bali-offering</p>

 <p><a name="fn_301"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_302">45:1</a> <b>12</b>. 'It procures as much reward as penance.'--Haradatta. Manu II, 166; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 113. The phrase occurs frequently in the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, e.g. Taitt. Âr. II, 14, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_302"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_303">45:2</a> Regarding the proper position at the 'Veda-offering,' or daily recitation, see above, I, 3, 11, 2 3, and Taitt. Âr. II, 11, 3. Passages similar to the first part of the sentence quoted in this Sûtra occur Taitt. Âr II, 12, 3, and 15, 3. It ought to be observed that the Taitt. Âr. in both places has the word 'vra<i>g</i>an,' which is also read in the P. and P. U. MSS. The second part is taken apparently from the same work, II, 14, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_303"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_304">45:3</a> See <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a XI, 5, 6, 8, where a passage very similar to that quoted by Âpastamba occurs. Vasha<i>t</i> and the other exclamations, which are pronounced by the Hot<i>ri</i>-priest, serve as signals for the Adhvaryu to throw the oblations into the fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_304"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_305">46:5</a> 'Some suppose that the words Bhû<i>h</i> Bhuva<i>h</i> and Suva<i>h</i> &amp;c. (are to be used only) if one studies the Brâhma<i>n</i>a portion of the Veda, not every where.'-- Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_305"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_306">46:6</a> Haradatta explains Âryas by vi<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>â<i>h</i>, 'excellent ones,' i.e. persons who know the law, and he gives Manu as an instance.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_306"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_307">46:8</a> See above, I, 1, 4, 9 and 10. and notes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_307"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_308">47:10</a> How then is their existence known? 'They are inferred from usage.' '"Usage" means the teaching of the law-books and the practice. From that it is inferred that Manu and other (authors of law-books) knew such texts of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. For how could otherwise (<i>Ri</i>shis like Manu) teach in their works or practise (such customs) for which no authority is now found? And certainly they were intimately connected with the revealed texts (i.e. saw them).'-- Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_308"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_309">47:11</a> Compare above, I, 1, 4, 8-10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_309"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_310">47:13</a> The consequence of the introduction of these rules into a Sm<i>ri</i>ti work is, that their omission must be expiated by a Smârta penance and not by a <i>S</i>rauta one.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_310"></a><a href="sbe0215.htm#fr_311">47:14</a> The commentator observes, that, as these rites are called 'great sacrifices,' by way of laudation only, the particular laws binding on performers of real Soma-sacrifices cannot be transferred to the performers of these ceremonies. Regarding the <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a> term 'great sacrifices,' see also Taitt. Âr. II, 11, 10, 1 seq., and <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a XI, 59 6, 1.</p>
