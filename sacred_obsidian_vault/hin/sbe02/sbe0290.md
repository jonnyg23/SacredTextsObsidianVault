Haradatta states that ata<i>h</i>, 'therefore,' means 'because the K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ras cannot be performed if they have not been described,' while Sâya<i>n</i>a, on the Sâmavidhâna, asserts that it means 'because unpurified persons who are unable to offer sacrifices cannot gain heavenly bliss without performing austerities such as K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ras.' It is a remarkable fact that Haradatta does not seem to have been aware that the twenty-sixth chapter of Gautama is taken bodily from the Sâmavidhâna.</p>

Regarding the Sâmans and Mantras, see notes to Burnell's edition of the Sâmavidhâna, and above, XXV, 7. Haradatta remarks that in the Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. (V, 6, 1) the Mantras beginning ' The golden-coloured' are ten in number, and adds that 'if in some other <i>S</i>âkhâ eight are found, those must be taken.'</p>

The epithets given to the deity in the Sâmavidhâna can all be referred to the Sun, provided he is identified with the universal soul, while in the above Sûtra, Rudra and Indra have been introduced. It cannot be doubtful that the Sâmavidhâna gives an older and more authentic form of the prayer. My translation of the epithets, which are found in the Sâmavidhâna also, follows Sâya<i>n</i>a's gloss. Haradatta does not explain them. About Sobhya in the twelfth Mantra, which possibly might mean, 'he who dwells in a mirage, i.e. the Sa<i>m</i>sâra,' I feel doubtful. My MSS. read somya, and the Sâmavidhâna has saumya in the second Mantra. But I am unwilling to alter the word, as Professor Stenzler's reading may have been derived from a South-Indian MS., where bhya and mya do not resemble each other so, much as in the Devanâgarî characters.</p>
