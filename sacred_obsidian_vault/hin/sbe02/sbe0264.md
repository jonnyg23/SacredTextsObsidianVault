 <p>1. He who instigates to, he who assists in, and he who commits (an act, these three) share its rewards in heaven and its punishments in hell.</p>  
 <p>2. He amongst these who contributes most to the accomplishment (of the act obtains) a greater share of the result.</p>  
 <p>3. Both the wife and the husband have power over (their) common property. <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>5. Men of learning and pure descent, who are aged, clever in reasoning, and careful in fulfilling the duties (of their caste and order, shall be the judges) in lawsuits. <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. In doubtful cases (they shall give their decision) after having ascertained (the truth) by inference, ordeals, and the like (means). <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">6b</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. A person who is possessed of good qualities (may be called as a witness, and) shall answer the questions put to him according to the truth on an auspicious day, in the morning, before a kindled fire, standing near (a jar full of) water, in the presence of the king, and with the consent of all (of both parties and of the assessors), after having been exhorted (by the judge) to be fair to both sides. <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. If (he is found out speaking) an untruth, the king shall punish him. <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>12. They declare, that (this knowledge) is a supplement of the Atharva-Veda.</p>  
 <p>13. It is difficult to learn the sacred law from (the letter of) the Vedas (only); but by following the indications it is easily accomplished.</p>  
 <p>14. The indications for these (doubtful cases are), 'He shall regulate his course of action according to the conduct which is unanimously recognised in all countries by men of the three twice-born castes, who have been properly obedient (to their teachers), who are aged, of subdued senses, neither given to avarice, nor hypocrites. Acting thus he will gain both worlds.' <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. Some declare, that the remaining duties (which have not been taught here) must be learnt from women and men of all castes.</p>
