 <p><a name="fn_244"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_245">32:1</a> <b>9</b>. The Upâkarma is the ceremony which is performed every year at the beginning of the course of study. It is in fact the solemn opening of the Brahmanic term. 'Because Âpastamba uses the word evening (i.e. first part of the night) it is not sinful to study later in the night.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 95; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 142, 143; Weber, Ind. Stud. X. 130 and 134.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_245"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_246">33:2</a> The term lasts therefore for five months; (i.e. latter half of, Srâva<i>n</i>a, Bhârapada, Â<i>s</i>vina, Kârttika, Mârgasîrsha, and the first half of Pausha.) The Rohinî-day of Pausha is meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_246"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_247">33:3</a> 'According to this latter opinion the Upâkarma should be performed on the full moon of Bhâdrapada, as has been taught in another work (Manu IV, 95); the (time of the) Utsargana, (the solemn closing of the term) should be advanced; and after the Utsargana has been performed, one may study the Veda during the light nights of each month until the full moon of Srâva<i>n</i>a, in order to fix in one's mind the part learned already; and in the dark fortnight of each month one may study the Vedâṅgas, i.e. grammar and the rest (Manu IV, 98). On the full moon of Srâva<i>n</i>a the Upâkarma should be performed once more, and that part of the Veda should be studied which has not yet been learned.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_247"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_248">33:4</a> Nigarnâh, 'high-roads,' are squares and the like.--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_248"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_249">33:6</a> The Samyâ is either the pin in the bullock's yoke or the round stick, about a foot and a half in length, which is used for the preparation of the Vedi. Manu IV, 116; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 148.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_249"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_250">33:8</a> 'Nor anywhere near it within the throw of a Samyi.' This must be understood from. Sûtra 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_251">34:9</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 148.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_251"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_252">34:13</a> The last part of the Sûtra may also be interpreted: 'Thus she will be blessed with children.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_253">34:14</a> Manu IV, 108; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 148.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_254">34:18</a> Haradatta explains Bâhya, 'outcasts,' by 'robbers, such as Ugras and Nishâdas.' But, I think, it means simply such outcasts as live in the forest or outside the village in the Vâdî, like the Dhers, Mahârs, Mângs of the present day. Most of these tribes however, are or were given to thieving. See Kullûka on Manu X, 2 9, and the Petersburg Dict. s. v.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_257"></a><a href="sbe0212.htm#fr_258">35:28</a> '"For two days," i.e. on the day of the new moon and the preceding one, the fourteenth of the half month.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 113; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 146.</p>
