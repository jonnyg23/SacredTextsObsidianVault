 <p>9. And he shall not announce it (to the owner) if a cow does damage (by eating corn or grass in a field).</p>  
 <p>10. (Nor shall he call attention to it) if a cow is together with her calf, except for a particular reason.</p>  
 <p>11. And of a cow which is not a milch-cow he shall not say, 'She is not a milch-cow.' He must say, 'This is a cow which will become a milch-cow.'</p>
