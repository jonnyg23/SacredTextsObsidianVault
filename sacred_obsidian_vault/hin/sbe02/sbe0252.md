 <p>1. (If) rhinoceros' meat (is given to Brâhma<i>n</i>as seated) on (seats covered with) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a very long time. <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish called) <i>S</i>atabali, <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called) Vârdhrâ<i>n</i>asa.</p>  
 <p>4. Pure, with composed mind and full of ardour, he shall feed Brâhma<i>n</i>as who know the Vedas, and who are not connected with him by marriage, blood relationship, by the relationship of sacrificial priest and sacrificer, or by the relationship of (teacher and) pupil. <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. If strangers are deficient in the (requisite) good qualities, even a full brother who possesses them, may be fed (at a <i>S</i>râddha).</p>  
 <p>6. (The admissibility of) pupils (and the rest) has been declared hereby.</p>  
 <p>7. Now they quote also (in regard to this matter the following verse):</p>  
 <p>8. The food eaten (at a sacrifice) by persons related to the giver is, indeed, a gift offered to the goblins. It reaches neither the Manes nor the <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>gods. Losing its power (to procure heaven), it errs about in this world as a cow that has lost its calf runs into a strange stable.</p>  
 <p>9. The meaning (of the verse) is, that gifts which are eaten (and offered) mutually by relations, (and thus go) from one house to the other, perish in this world.</p>  
 <p>10. If the good qualities (of several persons who might be invited) are equal, old men and (amongst these) poor ones, who wish to come, have the preference.</p>  
 <p>11. On the day before (the ceremony) the (first) invitation (must be issued). <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. On the following day the second invitation takes place. <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. (On the same day also takes place) the third invitation (which consists in the call to dinner). <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_696"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Some declare, that every act at a funeral sacrifice must be repeated three times.</p>  
 <p>15. As (the acts are performed) the first time, so they must be repeated) the second and the third times.</p>  
 <p>16. When all (the three oblations) have been <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>

 <p>offered, he shall take a portion of the food of all (three), and shall eat a small mouthful of the remainder in the manner described (in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra).</p>  
 <p>17. But the custom of the Northerners is to pour into the hands of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, when they are seated on their seats, (water which has been taken from the water-vessel.) <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. (At the time of the burnt-offering which is offered at the beginning of the dinner) he addresses the Brâhma<i>n</i>as with this Mantra: 'Let it be taken out, and let it be offered in the fire.' <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. (They shall give their permission with this Mantra): 'Let it be taken out at thy pleasure, let it be offered in the fire at thy pleasure.' Having received this permission, he shall take out (some of the prepared food) and offer it.</p>  
 <p>20. They blame it, if dogs and Apapâtras are allowed to see the performance of a funeral-sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>21. The following persons defile the company if they are invited to a funeral-sacrifice, viz. a leper, a bald man, the violator of another man's bed, the son of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who follows the profession of a Kshatriya, and the son of (a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who by marrying first a <i>S</i>ûdra wife had himself become) a <i>S</i>ûdra, born from a Brâhma<i>n</i>a woman. <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>

 <p>22. The following persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral-sacrifice, viz. one who has studied the three verses of the Veda containing the word 'Madhu,' each three times; one who has studied the part of the Veda containing the word 'Supar<i>n</i>a' three times; a Tri<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>iketa; one who has studied the Mantras required for the four sacrifices (called A<i>s</i>vamedha, Purushamedha, Sarvamedha, and Pit<i>ri</i>medha); one who keeps five fires; one who knows the Sâman called <i>G</i>yesh<i>th</i>a; one who fulfils the duty of daily study; the son of one who has studied and is able to teach the whole Veda with its Aṅgas, and a <i>S</i>rotriya. <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. He shall not perform (any part of) a funeral sacrifice at night. <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. After having begun (a funeral-sacrifice), he shall not eat until he has finished it. <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>

Haradatta's explanation of the word '<i>S</i>ûdra' by 'a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who has become a <i>S</i>ûdra' is probably not because the son of a real <i>S</i>ûdra and of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a female is a Ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla, and has been disposed of by the preceding Sûtra.</p>

The explanation of Trisupar<i>n</i>a is not certain. Haradatta thinks that it may mean either a person who knows the three verses <i>K</i>atushkapardâ yuvati<i>h</i> supe<i>s</i>â, &amp;c., Taittirîya-brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 2, 1, 27, &amp;c., or one who knows the three Anuvâkas from the Taittirîya Âra<i>n</i>yaka X, 48-50, beginning, Brahmametu mâm, &amp;c. The word 'Tri<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>iketa' has three explanations:--<i>a</i>. A person who knows the Nâ<i>k</i>iketa-fire according to the Taittirîyaka, Ka<i>th</i>avallî, and the <i>S</i>atapatha, i.e. has studied the portions on the Nâ<i>k</i>iketa-fire in these three books. <i>b</i>. A person who has thrice kindled the Nâ<i>k</i>iketa-fire. <i>c</i>. A person who has studied the Anuvâka, called Vira<i>g</i>as. <i>K</i>aturmedha may also mean 'one who has performed the four sacrifices' enumerated above.</p>
