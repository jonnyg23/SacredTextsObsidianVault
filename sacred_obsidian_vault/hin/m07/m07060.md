 <p>"Narada said, 'Yayati, the son of Nahusha, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey to death. Having performed a hundred Rajasuyas, a hundred Horse-sacrifices, a thousand <i>Pundarikas</i>, a hundred <i>Vajapeyas</i>, a thousand <i>Atiratras</i>, innumerable <i>Chaturmasyas</i>, diverse <i>Agnishtomas</i>, and many other kinds of sacrifices, in all of which he made profuse gifts unto the Brahmanas, he gave away unto the Brahmanas, having counted it first, the whole of the wealth that existed on the earth in the possession of <i>Mlecchas</i> and other Brahmana-hating people. When the gods and the <i>Asuras</i> were arrayed for battle, king Yayati aided the gods. Having divided the earth into four parts, he gave it away unto four persons. Having performed various sacrifices and virtuously begotten excellent offspring upon (his wives) Devayani, the daughter of Usanas and Sarmishtha, king Yayati, who was like unto a celestial, roved through the celestial woods at his own pleasure, like a second Vasava. Acquainted with all the <i>Vedas</i>, when, however, he found that he was not satiated with the indulgence of his passions, he then, with his wives, retired into the forest, saying this:</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> 'Whatever of paddy and wheat and gold and animals and women there are on earth, even the whole of these is not sufficient for one man. Thinking of this, one should cultivate contentment.' Thus abandoning all his desires, and attaining to contentment, the lord Yayati, installing (his son) on his throne, retired into the forest. When he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the four cardinal virtues and who, superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou shouldst not, saying, '<i>Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya</i>', grieve for the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"</p>
