 <p>10. And moreover (the Sâ<u>n</u>khya doctrine) is objectionable on account of its contradictions.</p> 
 <p>The doctrine of the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, moreover, is full of contradictions. Sometimes they enumerate seven senses, sometimes eleven <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">2</font></a>. In some places they teach that the subtle elements of material things proceed from the great principle, in other places again that they proceed from self-consciousness. Sometimes they speak of three internal organs, sometimes of one only <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">3</font></a>. That their doctrine, moreover, contradicts <i>S</i>ruti, which teaches that the Lord is the cause of the world, and Sm<i>ri</i>ti, based on <i>S</i>ruti, is well known.--For these reasons also the Sâ<u>n</u>khya system is objectionable.</p> 
 <p>Here the Sâ<u>n</u>khya again brings a countercharge--The system of the Vedântins also, he says, must be declared to be objectionable; for it does not admit that that which suffers and that which causes suffering <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">4</font></a> are different classes of things (and thereby renders futile the well-established distinction of causes of suffering and suffering beings). For</p>

 <p>those who admit the one Brahman to be the Self of everything and the cause of the whole world, have to admit also that the two attributes of being that which causes suffering and that which suffers belong to the one supreme Self (not to different classes of beings). If, then, these two attributes belong to one and the same Self, it never can divest itself of them, and thus Scripture, which teaches perfect knowledge for the purpose of the cessation of all suffering, loses all its meaning. For--to adduce a parallel case--a lamp as long as it subsists as such is never divested of the two qualities of giving heat and light. And if the Vedântin should adduce the case of water with its waves, ripples, foam, &amp;c. <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">1</font></a>, we remark that there also the waves, &amp;c. constitute attributes of the water which remain permanently, although they by turns manifest themselves, and again enter into the state of non-manifestation; hence the water is never really destitute of waves, not any more than the lamp is ever destitute of heat and light.--That that which causes suffering, and that which suffers constitute different classes of things is, moreover, well known from ordinary experience. For (to consider the matter from a more general point of view) the person desiring and the thing desired <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">2</font></a> are understood to be separate existences. If the object of desire were not essentially different and separate from the person desiring, the state of being desirous could not be ascribed to the latter, because the object with reference to which alone he can be called desiring would already essentially be established in him (belong to him). The latter state of things exists in the case of a lamp and its light, for instance. Light essentially belongs to the lamp, and hence the latter never can stand in want of light; for want or desire can exist only if the thing wanted or desired is not yet obtained.</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 378</font></a></p> 
 <p>(And just as there could be no desiring person, if the object of desire and the desiring person were not essentially separate), so the object of desire also would cease to be an object for the desiring person, and would be an object for itself only. As a matter of fact, however, this is not the case; for the two ideas (and terms), 'object of desire' and 'desiring person,' imply a relation (are correlative), and a relation exists in two things, not in one only. Hence the desiring person and the object of desire are separate.--The same holds good with regard to what is not desired (object of aversion; anartha) and the non-desiring person (anarthin). An object of desire is whatever is of advantage to the desiring person, an object of aversion whatever is of disadvantage; with both one person enters into relation by turns. On account of the comparative paucity of the objects of desire, and the comparative multitude of the objects of aversion, both may be comprised under the general term, 'object of aversion.' Now, these objects of aversion we mean when we use the term 'causes of suffering,' while by the term 'sufferer' we understand the soul which, being one, enters into successive relations with both (i.e. the objects of desire and the objects of aversion). If, then, the causes of suffering and the sufferer constitute one Self (as the Vedânta teaches), it follows that final release is impossible.--But if, on the other hand, the two are assumed to constitute separate classes, the possibility of release is not excluded, since the cause of the connexion of the two (viz. wrong knowledge) may be removed.</p> 
 <p>All this reasoning--we, the Vedântins, reply--is futile, because on account of the unity of the Self the relation, whose two terms are the causes of suffering, and the sufferer cannot exist (in the Self).--Our doctrine would be liable to your objection if that which causes suffering and that which suffers did, while belonging to one and the same Self, stand to each other in the relation of object and subject. But they do not stand in that relation just because they are one. If fire, although it possesses different attributes, such as heat and light, and is capable of change, does neither burn nor illumine itself since it is one only; how can the</p> 
 <p><a name="page_379"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 379</font></a></p> 
 <p>one unchangeable Brahman enter with reference to itself into the relation of cause of suffering and sufferer?--Where then, it may be asked, does the relation discussed (which after all cannot be denied altogether) exist?--That, we reply, is not difficult to see <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The living body which is the object of the action of burning is the sufferer; the sun, for instance, is a cause of suffering (burning).--But, the opponent rejoins, burning is a pain, and as such can affect an intelligent being only, not the non-intelligent body; for if it were an affection of the mere body, it would, on the destruction of the body, cease of itself, so that it would be needless to seek for means to make it cease.--But it is likewise not observed, we reply, that a mere intelligent being destitute of a body is burned and suffers pain.--Nor would you (the Sâ<u>n</u>khya) also assume that the affection called burning belongs to a mere intelligent being. Nor can you admit <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">2</font></a> a real connexion of the soul and the body, because through such a connexion impurity and similar imperfections would attach to the soul <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Nor can suffering itself be said to suffer. And how then, we ask, can you explain the relation existing between a sufferer and the causes of suffering? If (as a last refuge) you should maintain that the sattva-gu<i>n</i>a is that which suffers, and the gu<i>n</i>a called passion that which causes suffering, we again object, because the intelligent principle (the soul) cannot be really connected with these two <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">4</font></a>. And if you should say that the soul suffers as it were because it leans towards <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">5</font></a> the sattva-gu<i>n</i>a, we point out that the employment of the phrase, 'as it were,' shows that the soul does not really suffer.</p>

 <p><a name="page_380"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 380</font></a></p> 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> If it is understood that its suffering is not real, we do not object to the phrase 'as it were <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' For the amphisbena also does not become venomous because it is 'a serpent as it were' ('like a serpent'), nor does the serpent lose its venom because it is 'like an amphisbena.' You must therefore admit that the relation of causes of suffering and of sufferers is not real, but the effect of Nescience. And if you admit, that, then my (the Vedântic) doctrine also is free from objections <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p> 
 <p>But perhaps you (the Sâ<u>n</u>khya) will say that, after all, suffering (on the part of the soul) is real <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">3</font></a>. In that case, however, the impossibility of release is all the more undeniable <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">4</font></a>, especially as the cause of suffering (viz. the pradhâna) is admitted to be eternal.--And if (to get out of this difficulty) you maintain that, although the potentialities of suffering (on the part of the soul) and of causing suffering (on the part of the pradhâna) are eternal, yet suffering, in order to become actual, requires the conjunction of the two--which conjunction in its turn depends on a special reason, viz. the non-discrimination of the pradhâna by the soul--and that hence, when that reason no longer exists, the conjunction of the two comes to an absolute termination, whereby the absolute release of the soul becomes possible; we are again unable to accept your explanation, because that on which the non-discrimination depends, viz. the gu<i>n</i>a, called Darkness, is acknowledged by you to be eternal.</p>

 <p><a name="page_381"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 381</font></a></p> 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And as  <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">1</font></a> there is no fixed rule for the (successive) rising and sinking of the influence of the particular gu<i>n</i>as, there is also no fixed rule for the termination of the cause which effects the conjunction of soul and pradhâna (i.e. non-discrimination); hence the disjunction of the two is uncertain, and so the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas cannot escape the reproach of absence of final release resulting from their doctrine. To the Vedântin, on the other hand, the idea of final release being impossible cannot occur in his dreams even; for the Self he acknowledges to be one only, and one thing cannot enter into the relation of subject and object, and Scripture, moreover, declares that the plurality of effects originates from speech only. For the phenomenal world, on the other hand, we may admit the relation of sufferer and suffering just as it is observed, and need neither object to it nor refute it.</p> 
 <p>Herewith we have refuted the doctrine which holds the pradhâna to be the cause of the world. We have now to dispose of the atomic theory.</p> 
 <p>We begin by refuting an objection raised by the atomists against the upholders of Brahman.--The Vai<i>s</i>eshikas argue as follows: The qualities which inhere in the substance constituting the cause originate qualities of the same kind in the substance constituting the effect; we see, for instance, that from white threads white cloth is produced, but do not observe what is contrary (viz. white threads resulting in a piece of cloth of a different colour). Hence, if the intelligent Brahman is assumed as the cause of the world, we should expect to find intelligence inherent in the effect also, viz. the world. But this is not the case, and consequently the intelligent Brahman cannot be the cause of the world.--This reasoning the Sûtrakâra shows to be fallacious, on the ground of the system of the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas themselves.</p>
