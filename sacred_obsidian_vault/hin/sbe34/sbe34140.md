 <p align="CENTER">REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!</p> 
 <p>1. If it be objected that (from the doctrine expounded hitherto) there would result the fault of there being no room for (certain) Sm<i>ri</i>tis; we do not admit that objection, because (from the rejection of our doctrine) there would result the fault of want of room for other Sm<i>ri</i>tis.</p> 
 <p>It has been shown in the first adhyâya that the omniscient Lord of all is the cause of the origin of this world in the same way as clay is the material cause of jars and gold of golden ornaments; that by his rulership he is the cause of the subsistence of this world once originated, just as the magician is the cause of the subsistence of the magical illusion; and that he, lastly, is the cause of this emitted world being finally reabsorbed into his essence, just as the four classes of creatures are reabsorbed into the earth. It has further been proved, by a demonstration of the connected meaning of all the Vedânta-texts, that the Lord is the Self of all of us. Moreover, the doctrines of the pradhâna, and so on, being the cause of this world have been refuted as not being scriptural.--The purport of the second adhyâya, which we now begin, is to refute the objections (to the doctrine established hitherto) which might be founded on Sm<i>ri</i>ti and Reasoning, and to show that the doctrines of the pradhâna, &amp;c. have only fallacious arguments to lean upon, and that the different Vedânta-texts do not contradict one another with regard to the mode of creation and similar topics.--The first point is to refute the objections based on Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p> 
 <p>Your doctrine (the pûrvapakshin says) that the omniscient</p> 
 <p><a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a></p> 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Brahman only is the cause of this world cannot be maintained, 'because there results from it the fault of there being no room for (certain) Sm<i>ri</i>tis.' Such Sm<i>ri</i>tis are the one called Tantra which was composed by a <i>ri</i>shi and is accepted by authoritative persons, and other Sm<i>ri</i>tis based on it <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for all of which there would be no room if your interpretation of the Veda were the true one. For they all teach that the non-intelligent pradhâna is the independent cause of the world. There is indeed room (a raison d'être) for Sm<i>ri</i>tis like the Manu-sm<i>ri</i>ti, which give information about matters connected with the whole body of religious duty, characterised by injunction <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">2</font></a> and comprising the agnihotra and similar performances. They tell us at what time and with what rites the members of the different castes are to be initiated; how the Veda has to be studied; in what way the cessation of study has to take place; how marriage has to be performed, and so on. They further lay down the manifold religious duties, beneficial to man, of the four castes and â<i>s</i>ramas <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">3</font></a>. The Kâpila Sm<i>ri</i>ti, on the other hand, and similar books are not concerned with things to be done, but were composed with exclusive reference to perfect knowledge as the means of final release. If then no room were left for them in that connexion also, they would be altogether purposeless; and hence we must explain the Vedânta-texts in such a manner as not to bring them into conflict with the Sm<i>ri</i>tis mentioned <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">4</font></a>.--But how, somebody may ask the pûrvapakshin, can the eventual fault of there being left no room for certain Sm<i>ri</i>tis be used as an objection against that sense of <i>S</i>ruti which--from various</p>

 <p>reasons as detailed under I, 1 and ff.--has been ascertained by us to be the true one, viz. that the omniscient Brahman alone is the cause of the world?--Our objection, the pûrvapakshin replies, will perhaps not appear valid to persons of independent thought; but as most men depend in their reasonings on others, and are unable to ascertain by themselves the sense of <i>S</i>ruti, they naturally rely on Sm<i>ri</i>tis, composed by celebrated authorities, and try to arrive at the sense of <i>S</i>ruti with their assistance; while, owing to their esteem for the authors of the Sm<i>ri</i>tis, they have no trust in our explanations. The knowledge of men like Kapila Sm<i>ri</i>ti declares to have been <i>ri</i>shi-like and unobstructed, and moreover there is the following <i>S</i>ruti-passage, 'It is he who, in the beginning, bears in his thoughts the son, the <i>ri</i>shi, kapila <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whom he wishes to look on while he is born' (<i>S</i>ve. Up. V, 2). Hence their opinion cannot be assumed to be erroneous, and as they moreover strengthen their position by argumentation, the objection remains valid, and we must therefore attempt to explain the Vedânta-texts in conformity with the Sm<i>ri</i>tis.</p> 
 <p>This objection we dispose of by the remark, 'It is not so because therefrom would result the fault of want of room for other Sm<i>ri</i>tis.'--If you object to the doctrine of the Lord being the cause of the world on the ground that it would render certain Sm<i>ri</i>tis purposeless, you thereby render purposeless other Sm<i>ri</i>tis which declare themselves in favour of the said doctrine. These latter Sm<i>ri</i>ti-texts we will quote in what follows. In one passage the highest Brahman is introduced as the subject of discussion, 'That which is subtle and not to be known;' the text then goes on, 'That is the internal Self of the creatures, their soul,' and after that remarks 'From that sprang the Unevolved, consisting of the three gu<i>n</i>as, O best of Brâhma<i>n</i>as.' And in another place it is said that 'the Unevolved is</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 293</font></a></p> 
 <p>dissolved in the Person devoid of qualities, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a.'--Thus we read also in the Purâ<i>n</i>a, 'Hear thence this short statement: The ancient Nârâya<i>n</i>a is all this; he produces the creation at the due time, and at the time of reabsorption he consumes it again.' And so in the Bhagavadgîtâ also (VII, 6), 'I am the origin and the place of reabsorption of the whole world.' And Âpastamba too says with reference to the highest Self, 'From him spring all bodies; he is the primary cause, he is eternal, he is unchangeable' (Dharma Sûtra I, 8, 23, 2). In this way Sm<i>ri</i>ti, in many places, declares the Lord to be the efficient as well as the material cause of the world. As the pûrvapakshin opposes us on the ground of Sm<i>ri</i>ti, we reply to him on the ground of Sm<i>ri</i>ti only; hence the line of defence taken up in the Sûtra. Now it has been shown already that the <i>S</i>ruti-texts aim at conveying the doctrine that the Lord is the universal cause, and as wherever different Smr<i>it</i>is conflict those maintaining one view must be accepted, while those which maintain the opposite view must be set aside, those Sm<i>ri</i>tis which follow <i>S</i>ruti are to be considered as authoritative, while all others are to be disregarded; according to the Sûtra met with in the chapter treating of the means of proof (Mîm. Sûtra I, 3, 3), 'Where there is contradiction (between <i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti) (Sm<i>ri</i>ti) is to be disregarded; in case of there being no (contradiction) (Sm<i>ri</i>ti is to be recognised) as there is inference (of Sm<i>ri</i>ti being founded on <i>S</i>ruti).'--Nor can we assume that some persons are able to perceive supersensuous matters without <i>S</i>ruti, as there exists no efficient cause for such perception. Nor, again, can it be said that such perception may be assumed in the case of Kapila and others who possessed supernatural powers, and consequently unobstructed power of cognition. For the possession of supernatural powers itself depends on the performance of religious duty, and religious duty is that which is characterised by injunction <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">1</font></a>; hence the sense of injunctions (i.e. of the Veda)</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 294</font></a></p> 
 <p>which is established first must not be fancifully interpreted in reference to the dicta of men 'established' (i.e. made perfect, and therefore possessing supernatural powers) afterwards only. Moreover, even if those 'perfect' men were accepted as authorities to be appealed to, still, as there are many such perfect men, we should have, in all those cases where the Sm<i>ri</i>tis contradict each other in the manner described, no other means of final decision than an appeal to <i>S</i>ruti.--As to men destitute of the power of independent judgment, we are not justified in assuming that they will without any reason attach themselves to some particular Sm<i>ri</i>ti; for if men's inclinations were so altogether unregulated, truth itself would, owing to the multiformity of human opinion, become unstable. We must therefore try to lead their judgment in the right way by pointing out to them the conflict of the Sm<i>ri</i>tis, and the distinction founded on some of them following <i>S</i>ruti and others not.--The scriptural passage which the pûrvapakshin has quoted as proving the eminence of Kapila's knowledge would not justify us in believing in such doctrines of Kapila (i.e. of some Kapila) as are contrary to Scripture; for that passage mentions the bare name of Kapila (without specifying which Kapila is meant), and we meet in tradition with another Kapila, viz. the one who burned the sons of Sagara and had the surname Vâsudeva. That passage, moreover, serves another purpose, (viz. the establishment of the doctrine of the highest Self,; and has on that account no force to prove what is not proved by any other means, (viz. the supereminence of Kapila's knowledge.) On the other hand, we have a <i>S</i>ruti-passage which proclaims the excellence of Manu <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">1</font></a>, viz. 'Whatever Manu said is medicine' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 2, 10, 2). Manu himself, where he glorifies the seeing of the one Self in everything ('he who equally sees the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self, he as a sacrificer to the Self attains self-luminousness,'</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p> 
 <p>i.e. becomes Brahman, Manu Sm<i>ri</i>ti XII, 91), implicitly blames the doctrine of Kapila. For Kapila, by acknowledging a plurality of Selfs, does not admit the doctrine of there being one universal Self. In the Mahâbhârata also the question is raised whether there are many persons (souls) or one; thereupon the opinion of others is mentioned, 'There are many persons, O King, according to the Sâ<u>n</u>khya and Yoga philosophers;' that opinion is controverted 'just as there is one place of origin, (viz. the earth,) for many persons, so I will proclaim to you that universal person raised by his qualities;' and, finally, it is declared that there is one universal Self, 'He is the internal Self of me, of thee, and of all other embodied beings, the internal witness of all, not to be apprehended by any one. He the all-headed, all-armed, all-footed, all-eyed, all-nosed one moves through all beings according to his will and liking.' And Scripture also declares that there is one universal Self, 'When to a man who understands the Self has become all things, what sorrow, what trouble can there be to him who once beheld that unity?' (Î<i>s</i>. Up 7); and other similar passages. All which proves that the system of Kapila contradicts the Veda, and the doctrine of Manu who follows the Veda, by its hypothesis of a plurality of Selfs also, not only by the assumption of an independent pradhâna. The authoritativeness of the Veda with regard to the matters stated by it is independent and direct, just as the light of the sun is the direct means of our knowledge of form and colour; the authoritativeness of human dicta, on the other hand, is of an altogether different kind, as it depends on an extraneous basis (viz. the Veda), and is (not immediate but) mediated by a chain of teachers and tradition.</p> 
 <p>Hence the circumstance that the result (of our doctrine) is want of room for certain Sm<i>ri</i>tis, with regard to matters contradicted by the Veda, furnishes no valid objection.--An additional reason for this our opinion is supplied by the following Sûtra.</p>
