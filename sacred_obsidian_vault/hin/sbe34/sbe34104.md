 <p>35. And because the kshattriyahood (of <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti) is understood from the inferential mark (supplied by his being mentioned) later on with <i>K</i>aitraratha (who was a kshattriya himself).</p> <i>
 </i><p>Gâna<i>s</i>ruti cannot have been a <i>S</i>ûdra by birth for that reason also that his being a kshattriya is understood from an inferential sign, viz. his being mentioned together (in one chapter) with the kshattriya <i>K</i>aitraratha Abhipratârin. For, later on, i.e. in the passage complementary to the sa<i>m</i>varga-vidyâ, a kshattriya <i>K</i>aitrarathi Abhipratârin is glorified, 'Once while <i>S</i>aunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni were being waited on at their meal a religious student begged of them' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. IV, 3, 5). That this Abhipratârin was a <i>K</i>aitrarathi (i.e. a descendant of <i>K</i>itraratha) we have to infer from his connexion with a Kâpeya. For we know (from <i>S</i>ruti) about the connexion of <i>K</i>itraratha himself with the Kâpeyas ('the Kâpeyas made <i>K</i>itraratha perform that sacrifice;' Tâ<i>nd</i>ya. Br. XX, 12, 5), and as a rule sacrificers of one and the same family employ officiating priests of one and the same family. Moreover, as we understand from Scripture ('from him a <i>K</i>aitrarathi descended who was a prince <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">2</font></a>') that he (<i>K</i>aitraratha) was a prince, we must</p>

 <p>understand him to have been a kshattriya. The fact now of <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti being praised in the same vidyâ with the kshattriya Abhipratârin intimates that the former also was a kshattriya. For as a rule equals are mentioned together with equals. That <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruti was a kshattriya we moreover conclude from his sending his door-keeper and from other similar signs of power (mentioned in the text).--Hence the <i>S</i>ûdras are not qualified (for the knowledge of Brahman).</p>
