 <p>1. We implore <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:1">1</a> with well-spoken words the vigorous <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:2">2</a> Agni who belongs to many people <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:3">3</a>, to the clans that worship the gods <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:4">4</a>, whom other people (also) magnify.</p>  
 <p>2. Men have placed Agni (on the altar) as the augmenter of strength. May we worship thee, rich in sacrificial food. Thus be thou here to-day gracious to us, a helper in our striving for gain, O good one!</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>3. We choose thee, the all-possessor, as our messenger and as our Hot<i>ri</i>. The flames of thee, who art great, spread around; thy rays touch the heaven.</p>  
 <p>4. The gods, Varu<i>n</i>a, Mitra, Aryaman, kindle thee, the ancient messenger. The mortal, O Agni, who worships thee, gains through thee every prize.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>5. Thou art the cheerful Hot<i>ri</i> and householder, O Agni, the messenger of the clans. In thee all the firm laws are comprised which the gods have made <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:5:1">1</a>.</p>  
 <p>6. In thee, the blessed one, O Agni, youngest god, all sacrificial food is offered. Sacrifice then thou who art gracious to us to-day and afterwards <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:6:1">1</a>, to the gods that we may be rich in valiant men.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>7. Him, the king, verily the adorers approach reverentially. With oblations men kindle Agni, having overcome all failures.</p>  
 <p>8. Destroying the foe <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:1">1</a>, they (victoriously) got through Heaven and Earth and the waters; they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>have made wide room for their dwelling. May the manly (Agni) <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:2">2</a>, after he has received the oblations, become brilliant at the side of Ka<i>n</i>va; may he neigh as a horse in battles.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>9. Take thy seat; thou art great. Shine forth, thou who most excellently repairest to the gods. O Agni, holy god, emit thy red, beautiful smoke, O glorious one!</p>  
 <p>10. Thou whom the gods have placed here for Manu as the best performer of the sacrifice, O carrier of oblations, whom Ka<i>n</i>va and Medhyâtithi, whom V<i>ri</i>shan and Upastuta <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:10:1">1</a> (have worshipped,) the winner of prizes.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>11. That Agni's nourishment has shone brightly whom Medhyâtithi and Ka<i>n</i>va have kindled on behalf of <i>Ri</i>ta <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:11:1">1</a>. Him do these hymns, him do we extol.</p>  
 <p>12. Fill (us with) wealth, thou self-dependent one, for thou, O Agni, hast companionship with the gods. Thou art lord over glorious booty. Have mercy upon us; thou art great.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>13. Stand up straight for blessing us, like the god Savit<i>ri</i>, straight a winner of booty, when we with our worshippers and with ointments <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:1">1</a> call thee <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:2">2</a> in emulation (with other people).</p>  
 <p>14. Standing straight, protect us by thy splendour from evil; burn down every ghoul <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:1">1</a>. Let us stand straight that we may walk and live. Find out our worship <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:2">2</a> among the gods.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>15. Save us, O Agni, from the sorcerer, save us from mischief, from the niggard. Save us from him</p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>who does us harm or tries to kill us, O youngest god with bright splendour!</p>  
 <p>16. As with a club <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:16:1">1</a> smite the niggards in all directions, and him who deceives us, O god with fiery jaws. The mortal who makes (his weapons) very sharp by night, may that impostor not rule over us.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>17. Agni has won abundance in heroes, Agni prosperity (for Ka<i>n</i>va). Agni and the two Mitras (i. e. Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a) have blessed Medhyâtithi, Agni (has blessed) Upastuta in the acquirement (of wealth) <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:17:1">1</a>.</p>  
 <p>18. Through Agni we call hither from afar Turva<i>s</i>a, Yadu, and Ugradeva. May Agni, our strength against the Dasyu, conduct Navavâstva, B<i>ri</i>hadratha, and Turvîti <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:18:1">1</a>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>19. Manu has established thee, O Agni, as a light for all people. Thou hast shone forth with Ka<i>n</i>va, born from <i>Ri</i>ta, grown strong, thou whom the human races worship.</p>  
 <p>20. Agni's flames are impetuous and violent; they are terrible and not to be withstood. Always burn down the sorcerers, and the allies of the Yâtus, every ghoul <a href="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:20:1">1</a>.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>The authorship of this hymn, and of the whole collection to which it belongs (I, 36–43), is ascribed to Ka<i>n</i>va Ghaura. Numerous passages show indeed that it was the family of the Ka<i>n</i>vas, or rather, to speak more accurately, a branch of that family, among which this group of hymns has been composed. But it is as great a mistake in this as in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>a number of similar cases to accept the founder of one of the great Brâhmanical families as an author of Vedic poems. Comp. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII, 215 seq.</p>  
 <p>The metre is alternately B<i>ri</i>hatî and Satob<i>ri</i>hatî, so that the hymn consists of strophes (Pragâtha) of two verses. Verse 1 = SV. I, 59. Verse 9 = VS. XI, 37; TS. IV, 1, 3, 3 (V, 1, 4, 5); TÂr. IV, 5, 2 (V, 4, 6); MS. II, 7, 3; IV, 9, 3. Verse 13 = SV. I, 57; VS. XI, 42; TS. IV, 1, 4, 2 (V, 1, 5, 3); MS. II, 7, 4. Verses 13, 14 = TB. III, 6, 1, 2; TÂr. IV, 20, 1; MS. IV, 13, 1. Verse 19 = SV. I, 54.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:1:1">1</a>. Literally, we entreat for you. Comp. on this use of the pronoun va<i>h</i>, Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 206. See also Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XX, 64.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:1:2">2</a>. The meaning of yahvá cannot be determined with full certainty.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:1:3">3</a>. There is no sufficient reason to change with Ludwig (IV, 254) purû<i>n</i>â´m to Pûrû<i>n</i>â´m, and thus to convert the metrically correct Pâda into an irregular one.—Comp. Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XXII, 593.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:1:4">4</a>. On devayatî´nâm, comp. Lanman, p. 399.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:5:1">1</a>. 'On thee all the eternal works are united, i. e. depend, which the gods have wrought; such as sun, stars, lightning.' M. M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:6:1">1</a>. With the third Pâda compare the third Pâda of verse 2. It is a galita.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:8:1">1</a>. The word 'the foe' (v<i>ri</i>tra) alludes to the name of the demon conquered by Indra; see H. O., Religion des Veda, 135, note 2.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:8:2">2</a>. The metre would become more correct by reading v<i>ri</i>shabhá<i>h</i> instead of v<i>rí</i>shâ. Or V<i>rí</i>sha<i>n</i>i, 'with V<i>ri</i>shan'? Comp. verse 10.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:10:1">1</a>. Medhyâtithi or Medhâtithi is very frequently mentioned in connection with Ka<i>n</i>va.</p>  
 <p>V<i>ri</i>shan is taken as a proper name by Boehtlingk-Roth and by Grassmann (not by Ludwig) in VI, 16, 15. Possibly they are right, but in no case can V<i>ri</i>shan of the sixth book, named by the side of Dadhya<i>ñ</i><i>k</i> and Atharvan, be identified with any probability with the V<i>ri</i>shan mentioned in our passage, who evidently belongs to the ancestors of the Ka<i>n</i>vas.</p>  
 <p>Upastuta is mentioned again together with Ka<i>n</i>va and Medhyâtithi in verse 17 of our hymn, together with Ka<i>n</i>va in VIII, 5, 25. Comp. I, 112, 15; VIII, 103, 8; X, 115, 8. 9; Bergaigne, Rel. Véd., II, 448.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:11:1">1</a>. Comp. I, 139, 2. yát ha tyát mitrâvaru<i>n</i>âv <i>ri</i>tâ´t ádhi âdadâ´the án<i>ri</i>tam svéna manyúnâ; X, 73, 5. mándamâna<i>h</i> <i>ri</i>tâ´t ádhi.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:13:1">1</a>. A<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>íbhi<i>h</i> can possibly mean 'who have salved themselves.' There is no reason to think of the anointing of the yûpa (sacrificial post), to which Sâya<i>n</i>a refers the word.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:13:2">2</a>. On vi-hvâ, comp. Pischel-Geldner, I, 144. There must be a technical reason, unknown to me, for the connection in which this verb repeatedly occurs, as is the case in our passage, with the noun vâghat: comp. III, 8, 10 (see below); VIII, 5, 16. purutrâ´ <i>k</i>it hí vâm narâ vihváyante manîshí<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> vâghádbhi<i>h</i> a<i>s</i>vinâ â´ gatam.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 14.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:14:1">1</a>. The exact meaning of atrín is unknown.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:14:2">2</a>. Geldner's conjectures on duvas seem rather bold</p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p>to me (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 233). Comp. vol. xxxii, pp. 203–206 (I, 165, 14).</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 16.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:16:1">1</a>. On ghanéva, see Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 334.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 17.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:17:1">1</a>. On Medhyâtithi and Upastuta, see the note on verse 10. Aufrecht (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 612) believes that in mitrótá an abbreviation of the name Mitrâtithi (X, 33, 7) is contained; he translates: 'Agni has promoted Mitrâtithi, Medhyâtithi, and Upastuta in the acquirement of wealth.' This is very ingenious, but I do not think that the reason which Aufrecht gives is sufficient: it cannot be understood, he says, why Mitra (or Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a) should be mentioned in a hymn exclusively addressed to Agni. But similar cases are quite frequent.—Prof. Max Müller writes: 'Could mitrâ stand for mitrâ<i>n</i>i? Agni has protected his friends and also Medhyâtithi.' Comp. also Lanman, p. 342.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 18.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:18:1">1</a>. On Turva<i>s</i>a and Yadu, comp. Muir, V, 286; Bergaigne, II, 354 seq.; Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Ges. XLII, 220. There is not the slightest reason for Ludwig's statement (IV, 254) that this hymn is a 'gebet um sig für den auf einem kriegszuge befindlichen Turvaçakönig.'</p>  
 <p>Ugradeva is not mentioned again. On Navavâstva and B<i>ri</i>hadratha, comp. X, 49, 6; VI, 20, 11; on Turvîti, the materials collected by Bergaigne, Rel. Véd., II, 358 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 20.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:36:20:1">1</a>. See verse 14, note 1.</p>
