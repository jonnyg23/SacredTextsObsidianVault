 <p>1. They have worshipped Vai<i>s</i>vânara with his broad stream of light with prayers <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:1:1">1</a> and treasures in order that he may walk on firm ground. For immortal Agni honours the gods, and from of old he has not violated the laws.</p>  
 <p>2. The wonderful messenger goes between the two worlds (heaven and earth), the Hot<i>ri</i> who has sat down, the Purohita of Manus. He takes care of his wide dwelling day by day, Agni who, incited by the gods, gives wealth for our prayers.</p>  
 <p>3. The priests have exalted with their thoughts Agni, the banner of sacrifices, the achiever of sacrifice <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:3:1">1</a>. From him in whom they have put together their (sacrificial) works and their prayers, the sacrificer desires blessings.</p>  
 <p>4. The father of sacrifices, the miraculous lord of those who know prayers (?) <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:1">1</a>, Agni, is the measure and rule <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:2">2</a> of the sacrificers; he has entered the two manifold-shaped worlds; the sage beloved by many people is glorified in his foundations.</p>  
 <p>5. The gods have established here in great beauty Agni the bright with his bright chariot, whose every law is golden <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:5:1">1</a>, Vai<i>s</i>vânara who dwells in the waters, who finds the sun, the diver, the swift one covered with strength, the quick one.</p>  
 <p>6. Agni, spreading out with his thought the manifold-adorned sacrifice, together with the gods and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the people of Manus, goes as a charioteer to and fro with (gods and men) who accomplish the sacrifice, the quick, domestic (god), the dispeller of curses.</p>  
 <p>7. Agni, be wakeful <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:7:1">1</a> in our life which may be blessed with offspring; swell with sap; shine upon us (plenty of) food. Stir up vigour and the great ones, O watchful (god). Thou art the U<i>s</i>i<i>g</i> (or willing one) of the gods, the good-minded (lord) of prayers.</p>  
 <p>8. The lord of the tribe, the vigorous <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:8:1">1</a> guest, the guider of prayers, the U<i>s</i>i<i>g</i> (or willing one) of those who invoke him, <i>G</i>âtavedas, the light of worship—him men constantly praise with adoration, with solicitations for their welfare.</p>  
 <p>9. The resplendent, joyous god, Agni on his chariot, has with his might encompassed the dwellings. May we honour in our house with beautiful prayers <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:9:1">1</a> his commands who is rich in manifold prosperity.</p>  
 <p>10. O Vai<i>s</i>vânara, I love thy statutes by which thou hast found the sun, O far-seeing one. When born thou hast filled the worlds, heaven and earth; Agni, thou encompassest all these (beings) by thyself.</p>  
 <p>11. For Vai<i>s</i>vânara's wonderful deeds he the sage alone has by his great skill mightily <a href="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:11:1">1</a> let loose (his powers?). Agni has been born exalting. both his parents, Heaven and Earth, rich in seed.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi and metre.—Verse 10 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 11 = TS. I, 5, 11, 1.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:1:1">1</a>. A meaning like 'prayer' seems to recommend itself for most of the passages in which the substantive víp occurs, for instance, V, 68, 1. prá va<i>h</i> mitrâ´ya gâyata váru<i>n</i>âya víp girâ´; IX, 22, 3. eté pûtâ´<i>h</i> vipa<i>s</i><i>k</i>íta<i>h</i> sómâsa<i>h</i> … vípâ´ ví â´na<i>s</i>u<i>h</i> dhíya<i>h</i>; IX, 65, 12. ayâ´ <i>k</i>ittá<i>h</i> vípâ´ anáyâ hári<i>h</i> pavasva dhâ´rayâ; III, 10, 5 (see below), &amp;c. As the verb vip means 'to be in trembling agitation,' the same word as a substantive may designate enthusiastic thoughts or prayers. Comp. vépate matî´, IX, 71, 3; X, II, 6, and the nouns vípra, vipa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ít, vipodhâ´. We need not enter here upon the question, whether some concrete trembling or shaking objects also were designated as vípa<i>h</i>, and whether Bergaigne (Religion Védique, I, p. vii) is right in taking the víp áya<i>h</i>-agrâ, with which Trita killed the boar (X, 99, 6), as a 'prière à pointe de fer' (comp. Macdonell, Journ. R. Asiatic Society, 1893, p. 431; 1895, p. 185).—In our verse vípa<i>h</i> may be either nominative or accusative. I have translated it as an accusative; in the case of the nominative the translation would be: 'The prayers have worshipped Vai<i>s</i>vânara with treasures.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:3:1">1</a>. The text has vidáthasya.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:4:1">1</a>. Ásura<i>h</i> vipa<i>h</i>-<i>k</i>ítâm. On the meaning of ásura, which implies the possession of secret, supernatural power, see H. O., Religion des Veda, 162 seq.—Comp. von Bradke, Dyâus Asura, pp. 64–65.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:4:2">2</a>. 'Richtschnur und Weg der Opferer,' Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 306.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:5:1">1</a>. Literally, 'whose rules are yellow.' The meaning is that Agni's whole sphere of activity bears the golden</p>  
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="green">p. 235</font></a></p>  
 <p>yellow colour. Sâya<i>n</i>a gives the interesting remark 'haritva<i>k</i>am iti <i>s</i>âkhântaram,' but no doubt hárivratam is right.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:7:1">1</a>. Comp. Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XIII, 297.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:8:1">1</a>. Comp. I, 36, 1, note 2.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:9:1">1</a>. Comp. II, 4, 1, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:3:11:1">1</a>. Prof. Max Müller proposes to translate, 'has sent forth his great song,' and observes, 'Might not b<i>ri</i>hat be like b<i>ri</i>hat sâ´ma, a name of a hymn?'</p>
