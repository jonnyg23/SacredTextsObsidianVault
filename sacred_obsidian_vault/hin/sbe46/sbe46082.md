 <p>1. This is that Agni with whom the desiring Indra took the pressed Soma into his body. Having obtained thousandfold strength like a horse, a racer <a href="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:1:1">1</a>, thou art praised, O <i>G</i>âtavedas!</p>  
 <p>2 <a href="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:1">1</a>. Thy splendour, O Agni, which dwells in heaven and on earth, in the plants, O worshipful one, and in the waters, wherewith thou hast spread through the wide air—that light of thine is fierce, waving <a href="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:2">2</a>, man-beholding.</p>  
 <p>3. Agni, thou goest to the floods of heaven. Thou hast spoken to the gods who are liberal (?) <a href="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:3:1">1</a>. (Thou goest) to the waters which (dwell) on high in the ether of the sun, and to those which approach below.</p>  
 <p>4. May the fires of the soil united with those on the hill-sides <a href="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:4:1">1</a>, without guile graciously accept our sacrifice and plentiful food free from all plague.</p>

 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi. The metre is Trish<i>t</i>ubh, except in verse 4 which is Anush<i>t</i>ubh.—A conjecture on the ritual use for which the hymn has been composed, see in the note on verse 4.—Verses 1–5 = VS. XII, 47–51; TS. IV, 2, 4, 2. 3; MS. II, 7, 11.—A sort of commentary on this hymn is found in the <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a VII, 1, 1, 22 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:22:1:1">1</a>. In the traditional text the words, 'a horse, a racer,' are accusatives. But it is the átya who attains</p>

M. M., vol. xxxii, pp. 116, 442, and on sápti, ibid. p. 102): see I, 130, 6; III, 2, 7; 38, 1 (V, 30, 14; IX, 93, 1; 96, 15, &amp;c.); VII, 24, 5; IX, 43, 5; 82, 2; 85, 5; 86, 3; 96, 20; X, 96, 10 (I, 52, 1, and III, 2, 3 do not contradict this). Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 105) believes that átyam ná stands for átya<i>h</i> ná, which seems impossible to me. But I think that we should correct the text and read átya<i>h</i> ná sápti<i>h</i>. The preceding accusatives have caused the blunder.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>

 <p>Note <a name="an_3:22:3:1">1</a>. In the translation of dhísh<i>n</i>ya I have followed Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 87, though this translation is quite uncertain. Should the meaning be: 'the gods who dwell on the dhish<i>n</i>ya altars'?</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:22:4:1">1</a>. Agni purîshya, i. e. the fire dwelling in the soil (comp. Roth in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 64), is mentioned very frequently in the Mantras belonging to the Agni<i>k</i>ayana, i. e. to the construction of the brick altar. Agni is considered as residing in the soil used at that rite. Now in the Ya<i>g</i>us texts the whole of our hymn occurs among the texts to be recited at the Agni<i>k</i>ayana (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 2, 4, 2, &amp;c.; comp. also Â<i>s</i>valâyana <i>S</i>rautasûtra IV, 8, 20). Perhaps we may conjecture, therefore, that the Agni<i>k</i>ayana rite in its simplest form was known already in the Rig-veda period, and that our hymn was destined for it.—The prâva<i>n</i>a fires (fires dwelling on the hill-sides) may be the fires dwelling in the rivers which run down the prava<i>n</i>as or descents.</p>
