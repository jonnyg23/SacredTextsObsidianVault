 <p>1. Driving away evil <a href="sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:1:1">1</a> with thy light, Agni, shine upon us with wealth—driving away evil with thy light.</p>  
 <p>2. Longing for rich fields, for a free path, and for wealth, we sacrifice—driving away evil with thy light.</p>  
 <p>3 <a href="sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:3:1">1</a>. When he stands forth as the most glorious one among them <a href="sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:3:2">2</a>, and when our liberal lords excel—driving away evil with thy light—</p>  
 <p>4. When through thee, Agni, the liberal lords, and when through thee we may multiply with offspring—driving away evil with thy light—</p>  
 <p>5. When the rays of the mighty Agni go forth on all sides—driving away evil with thy light—</p>  
 <p>6. For thou indeed, (O god) whose face is turned everywhere, encompassest (the world) everywhere—driving away evil with thy light.</p>  
 <p>7. Do thou carry us, as with a boat, across hostile powers, (O god) whose face is turned everywhere—driving away evil with thy light.</p>  
 <p>8. Do thou carry us across (evil) to welfare, as across a stream with a boat <a href="sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:8:1">1</a>—driving away evil with thy light.</p>

 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi. Metre, Gâyatrî. The hymn is addressed to Agni <i>S</i>u<i>k</i>i.—Verses 1–8 = AV. IV, 33, 1–8: TÂ. VI, 11, 1–2. Verse 1 = TÂ. VI, 10, 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:97:1:1">1</a>. Lanman (Sanskrit Reader, p. 363) translates: 'Driving away with flames our sin.' But aghá is not exactly sin.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:97:3:1">1</a>. In this verse as well as in the verses 4 and 5—all commencing with the words prá yát—the principal clauses are wanting. As to 3 meaning, however, these clauses are supplied by the refrain; 'driving away evil' of course means 'may he drive away evil.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:97:3:2">2</a>. 'Among them' seems to mean among the liberal lords.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:97:8:1">1</a>. Cf. Lanman, p. 434.</p>
