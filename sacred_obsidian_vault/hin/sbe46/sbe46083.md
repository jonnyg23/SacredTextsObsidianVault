 <p>1. Produced by attrition, well preserved in his abode, the young sage, the leader of worship, Agni ever young in the forests <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:1:1">1</a> that grow old—<i>G</i>âtavedas, has here assumed immortality <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:1:2">2</a>.</p>  
 <p>2. The two Bharatas <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:2:1">1</a>, Deva<i>s</i>ravas and Devavâta, in the midst of wealth have produced by attrition Agni the skilful (god). Agni, look forth with mighty wealth, and then be <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:2:2">2</a> for us a guide of food day by day.</p>  
 <p>3 <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:1">1</a>. The ten fingers have brought him to the birth, the ancient, beloved (Agni), well born in his mothers <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:2">2</a>. Praise, O Deva<i>s</i>ravas, the Agni of Devavâta who <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:3">3</a> should be the lord of people.</p>  
 <p>4. I have laid <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:1">1</a> thee <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:2">2</a> down in the best (place) of the earth <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:3">3</a>, in the place of I<i>l</i>â <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:3">3</a>, in the auspiciousness of days. O Agni, as the god who has belonged to Manus <a href="sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:4">4</a>, shine with wealth on the D<i>ri</i>shadvatî, on the Âpayâ, on the Sarasvatî.</p>  
 <p>5 = III, 1, 23.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>The <i>Ri</i>shis are Deva<i>s</i>ravas Bhârata and Devavâta Bhârata (see verse 2); the metre is Trish<i>t</i>ubh (verse 5 Satob<i>ri</i>hatî).—No verse occurs in the other Sa<i>m</i>hitâs.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:1:1">1</a>. The 'forests' are the fuel. 'Does the poet mean: Never consumed in the consumed wood or forests,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="green">p. 288</font></a></p>  
 <p>i. e. the fire burns and is kept alive while the wood is burnt up?' M. M.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:1:2">2</a>. Or, 'he has received the drink of immortality'—which may refer to the ghee offered in the fire.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:2:1">1</a>. On the tribe of the Bharatas having their seats, as verse 4 seems to show, on the borders of the Sarasvatî and of the D<i>ri</i>shadvatî, see H. O., Buddha (first edition), 413 seq.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:2:2">2</a>. This is an imperative in -tât, signifying, as Delbrück has shown (Syntaktische Forschungen, III, 2 seq.; Altindische Syntax, 363), an injunction to be carried out after something else has been done or has happened. Agni is first to look about (ví pa<i>s</i>ya), and shall then become (bhavatât) a guide of food, i. e. he shall lead plenty of food to the worshipper's house.—Prof. Max Müller translates ishâ´m netâ´, 'a guide to food.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:3:1">1</a>. Should this Satob<i>ri</i>hatî, standing alone among Trish<i>t</i>ubh verses, be considered as forming a distich together with verse 2? Comp. H. O., Die Hymnen des Rigveda, vol. i, p. 102, note 7.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:3:2">2</a>. The woods.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:3:3">3</a>. Agni, not Devavâta, is referred to.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:4:1">1</a>. Or, 'he has laid.' The form may be first or third person, present or perfect.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:4:2">2</a>. Agni is addressed.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:4:3">3</a>. The best place of the earth, the place of I<i>l</i>â (i. e. of the nourishment coming from the cow, of the ghee offered into Agni) is the sacrificial ground or more especially the spot on which the sacrificial fire is established.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:23:4:4">4</a>. Or 'to men.' The Padapâ<i>th</i>a has mâ´nushe, but mâ´nusha<i>h</i> seems more probable.</p>
