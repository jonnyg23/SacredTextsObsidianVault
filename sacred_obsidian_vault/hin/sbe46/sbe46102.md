 <p>1. Benevolent Agni has looked on the breaking of the shining dawns, on the bestowal of treasures. Come to the dwelling of the virtuous (mortal), ye A<i>s</i>vins. The god Sûrya rises with his light.</p>  
 <p>2. The god Savit<i>ri</i> has sent his light upward <a href="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:1">1</a>, shaking his banner <a href="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:2">2</a> like a warrior who fights for cows <a href="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:3">3</a>. Varu<i>n</i>a and Mitra follow the law, when they make the Sun rise on heaven.</p>  
 <p>3. Him whom (the gods) dwelling in firm peace, and never losing their object, have created for dispersing the darkness—Him, the Sun, the all-observer, the seven young fallow mares carry forward.</p>  
 <p>4. With (thy horses) most ready to run thou goest <a href="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:1">1</a> forward, spreading out thy web (of light), removing (from the world) the black cloth (of darkness), O god. The rays of the Sun have shaken <a href="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:2">2</a> the darkness, and have sunk it into the waters like a hide.</p>  
 <p>5. Unsupported, unattached, spread out downwards-turned—how is it that he <a href="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:5:1">1</a> does not fall down? By what power of his does he move? Who has seen (that)? Erected as the pillar of Heaven he protects the firmament.</p>

 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi and metre.—Verse 4 = TB. II, 4, 5, 4.</p>  
 <p>This hymn and the next evidently form a couple. They have the same number of verses, and are composed in the same metre. They are both addressed to Agni in his matutinal character, or rather to the A<i>s</i>vins, who are invoked to partake of the matutinal oblation (13, 1; 14, 1. 4). The first verse of 13 is quite similar to that of 14; the same may be said of the second verses of the two hymns; the concluding verse of both is identical.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_4:13:2:1">1</a>. Cf. above, IV, 6, 2.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_4:13:2:2">2</a>. Cf. Zend drafsha, 'banner.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_4:13:2:3">3</a>. Cf. IV, 40, 2. sátvâ bharishá<i>h</i> gavishá<i>h</i>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_4:13:4:1">1</a>. The Sun is addressed.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_4:13:4:2">2</a>. It is more natural to take dávidhvata<i>h</i> as nom. plur. than as gen. sing. (Ludwig).</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_4:13:5:1">1</a>. The Sun.</p>
