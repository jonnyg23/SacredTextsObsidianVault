 <p>1 <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:1">1</a>. Thee who hidest thyself in secret like a thief with an animal <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:2">2</a> (which he has stolen)—who hadst harnessed <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:3">3</a> adoration and carriedst adoration—</p>  
 <p>2. The wise unanimously followed by thy foot-marks <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:2:1">1</a>. All (gods) deserving worship (reverentially) sat down near thee.</p>  
 <p>3. The gods followed the laws of <i>Ri</i>ta. There was an encompassing as the heaven (encompasses) the earth <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:3:1">1</a>.</p>  
 <p>4. In the lap, in the womb of <i>Ri</i>ta, the waters nourish the fine child with praise, him who is well born.</p>  
 <p>5. Like good fortune, like a broad abode, like the fertile hill <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:5:1">1</a>, like the refreshing stream,</p>  
 <p>6. Like a racer urged forward in the race, like the rapids of the Sindhu <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:6:1">1</a>—who can hold him back?</p>  
 <p>7. (He is) the kinsman of the rivers, as a brother of his sisters. He eats the forests as a king (eats, i. e. takes the wealth of) the rich <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:7:1">1</a>.</p>  
 <p>8. When he has spread through the forests, driven by the wind, Agni shears the hair of the earth.</p>  
 <p>9. Sitting in the waters he hisses like a swan. (He is) most famous by his power of mind, he who belongs to the clans, awakening at dawn—</p>  
 <p>10. A performer of worship like Soma, the god born from <i>Ri</i>ta, like a young (?) <a href="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:10:1">1</a> beast, far-extending, far-shining.</p>

 <p>The authorship of the whole collection, I, 65–73, is ascribed to Parâ<i>s</i>ara <i>S</i>âktya. These hymns are addressed exclusively to Agni. The greater part of them (65–70) is composed in the Virâ<i>g</i> metre; comp. on this metre my Prolegomena, 95 seq. I have given there my reasons for considering that each verse consists of twenty, not of forty syllables.</p>  
 <p>This section ascribed to Parâ<i>s</i>ara has been treated of by Bollensen, Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XXII, 569 seq. No verse of these hymns composed in the metre Dvipadâ Virâ<i>g</i> (I, 65–70) occurs in the other Sa<i>m</i>hitâs.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:1:1">1</a>. Professor Max Müller proposes the following translation for verses 1 and 2: The wise (gods) together followed thee (Agni) when in hiding, by means of footsteps, as one follows a thief by the animal; they followed thee who accepts and carries adoration (to the gods). All the worshipful gods sat down (reverentially) near thee.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:1:2">2</a>. There is no reason for reading with Bartholomae (Studien zur indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 48) pa<i>s</i>vâ´n (gen. plur.) ná tâyúm.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:1:3">3</a>. Ludwig proposes yuvânám, which is quite unnecessary.—See also Gaedicke, 173.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:2:1">1</a>. We have here the well-known myth of the hidden Agni discovered by the gods. The 'wise ones,' (dhî´râ<i>h</i>) are no doubt the searching gods, the same who are called yá<i>g</i>atrâ<i>h</i> in the last Pâda, and who are expressly designated as devâ´<i>h</i> in verse 3. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:3:1">1</a>. Regarding the construction, see Gaedicke, 192.—Professor Max Müller's opinion on this phrase differs from</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>mine. He writes: 'I should prefer parîsh<i>t</i>i. But parish<i>t</i>i seems to mean a running about, reconnoitring, searching. "There was searching on earth as in heaven," lit. earth, like heaven, was reconnoitring-ground.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:5:1">1</a>. Comp. VIII, 50, 2. girí<i>h</i> ná bhu<i>g</i>mâ´. I believe that Boehtlingk-Roth, Bollensen, and Grassmann are right in correcting our passage accordingly; ra<i>n</i>vâ´, p<i>ri</i>thvî´, <i>s</i>ambhú follow the gender of the corresponding substantives, and the same may be expected here. Comp. Lanman, 530. The meaning is that Agni yields nourishment to all beings as a mountain fertilises the country by the waters which come down from it; comp. VIII, 49, 2. giré<i>h</i> iva prá rásâ<i>h</i> asya pinvire dátrâ<i>n</i>i purubaó<i>g</i>asa<i>h</i>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:6:1">1</a>. Regarding the construction, comp. Gaedicke, 252 seq.; Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, 95. Joh. Schmidt (Die Pluralbildungen der indogerm. Neutra, 305) and Ludwig (V, 524) are wrong in taking kshóda<i>h</i> as a locative or as an instrumental respectively.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:7:1">1</a>. Comp. Pischel-Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, p. xvi.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:65:10:1">1</a>. Can <i>s</i>í<i>s</i>vâ be the nominative of a stem <i>s</i>í<i>s</i>van which stands by the side of <i>s</i>í<i>s</i>u as <i>rí</i>bhvan of <i>ri</i>bhú? Prof. Max Müller proposes: 'Large like a cow with young, like a pregnant cow.'</p>
