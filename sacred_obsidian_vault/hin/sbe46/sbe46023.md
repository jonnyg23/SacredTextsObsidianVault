 <p>1. He who gives vigour like wealth acquired by the fathers <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:1:1">1</a>, who is a good guide like the instruction of a sage, who is pleased (by worship) like a comfortably resting guest <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:1:2">2</a>, (Agni) has crossed the (sacrificial) seat of the worshipper like a Hot<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p>2. He who being truthful like the god Savit<i>ri</i> <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:1">1</a> protects by his power of mind all settlements <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:2">2</a>, praised by many like impetuous splendour <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:3">3</a>, the truthful one has become dear like vital breath and worthy to be searched for <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:4">4</a>.</p>  
 <p>3 <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:3:1">1</a>. (Agni) who possessing every refreshment dwells on the earth like a god, like a king who has made himself (valiant) friends <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:3:2">2</a>, like heroes who sit in front and under shelter, like a blameless wife beloved by her husband—</p>  
 <p>4. Thee, O Agni, who art constantly kindled in the house, men have worshipped in their firm dwellings. They have placed in him rich splendour <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:4:1">1</a>. Be thou possessed of all life, a supporter of riches <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:4:2">2</a>.</p>  
 <p>5. May the liberal givers, O Agni, attain nourishment, may the rich <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:1">1</a> who bestow gifts (on us) attain to a full span of life. May we win in battles the booty of him who does not give <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:1">1</a>, obtaining a (rich) share before the gods, that we may win glory <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:2">2</a>.</p>  
 <p>6. The lowing milch-cows of <i>Ri</i>ta, assigned by Heaven, were exuberant with their full udders. The rivers imploring the favour (of the gods) from afar</p>  
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p>have broken through the midst of the rock with their floods.</p>  
 <p>7. Imploring favour from thee, O Agni, the worshipful (gods) have won glory in the sky. They have made Night and Dawn of different shapes; they have joined the black and red colour (to Night and Dawn).</p>  
 <p>8. And may we, our liberal givers and ourselves, be the mortals whom thou furtherest to wealth, O Agni <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:8:1">1</a>. Like a shadow thou followest the whole world, having filled the two worlds (Heaven and Earth) and the air <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:8:2">2</a>.</p>  
 <p>9. May we, O Agni, guarded by thee, conquer with our racers the racers, with our men the men, with our heroes the heroes (of our enemies). Being masters of the riches which their fathers <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:9:1">1</a> have conquered, may our rich (givers) reach a hundred winters.</p>  
 <p>10. May these hymns, O Agni, worshipper (of the gods), be grateful to thee, to thy mind and heart. May we be able to bridle thee, the well-harnessed wealth <a href="sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:10:1">1</a>, acquiring the glory which the gods have assigned us.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi and metre.—Verse 5 = MS. IV, 14, 15. Verse 7 = TB. II, 7, 12, 5. Verse 10 = MS. IV, 14, 15.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:1:1">1</a>. Agni is compared to wealth acquired by the fathers, being himself pit<i>ri</i>vitta, found by the forefathers</p>

 <p>of the Brâhmanic tribes. Prof. Max Müller proposes to translate: 'wealth inherited from the fathers.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:1:2">2</a>. Comp. VII, 42, 4, and see also VI, 16, 42.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:2:1">1</a>. The first Pâda is identical with the fourth of IX, 97, 48. There the expressions are referred to Soma.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:2:2">2</a>. On v<i>ri</i><i>g</i>ána, comp. the quotations given above, I, 60, 3, note 2; cf. IX, 87, 2. v<i>ri</i><i>g</i>ánam rákshamâ<i>n</i>a<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:2:3">3</a>. Comp. I, 64, 9. amáti<i>h</i> ná dar<i>s</i>atâ´.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:2:4">4</a>. Comp. II, 4, 1 (see below).</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:3:1">1</a>. The first three Pâdas are nearly identical with III, 55, 21.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:3:2">2</a>. As to the meaning of hitámitra, comp. X, 108, 3. mitrám ena dadhâma; see also X, 132, 5, and H. O., Religion des Veda, 186, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:4:1">1</a>. Comp. I, 72, 10 (see above).</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:4:2">2</a>. I cannot accept Pischel's translation of dharú<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> rayî<i>n</i>â´m, 'der Reichtum fliessen lässt' (Vedische Studien, I, 40).—'Be thou, who art rich in all food, the protector of riches.' M. M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:5:1">1</a>. On sûrí and arí, see Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 218 seq. Aryá<i>h</i> may also be nom. pl. and mean '(we) the poor ones.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:5:2">2</a>. 'May we win in battles the booty of the enemy, setting aside a share for the gods to their glory.' M. M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:8:1">1</a>. In the first Pâda one syllable is wanting. Perhaps the acc. plur. yâ´n had here dissyllabic value.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:73:8:2">2</a>. The last Pâda is identical with the second of X, 139, 2.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>

As sudhúr and sudhúra are epithets of horses, the poet of course could say, <i>s</i>akéma sudhûra<i>h</i> yámam te. But Agni is not only a horse; he is also wealth (II, 1, 12; IV, 2, 5, &amp;c.). The combination of the two metaphors explains the curious expression sudhúra<i>h</i> râyá<i>h</i>.</p>
