 <p>1. Agni is to be invoked as the first like a father, when he has been inflamed by Manus <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:1">1</a> in the abode of I<i>d</i> <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:2">2</a>. When he has invested himself with beauty, the wise immortal, he, the glorious strong (horse) is to be smoothed (by the worshippers as by grooms).</p>  
 <p>2. Agni with bright splendour, mayest thou hear my call with all my prayers, thou a wise immortal. The two tawny (horses) draw thy chariot or the two red (horses), or He the wide-ranging one has made the two ruddy (horses draw his chariot) <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:2:1">1</a>.</p>  
 <p>3. They have generated the well-born (Agni) in her who lies on her back <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:1">1</a>. Agni became a germ in the manifoldly-adorned (wives) <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:2">2</a>. Even in the … <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:3">3</a> the wise one dwells by night uncovered in his powers <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:4">4</a>.</p>  
 <p>4. I besprinkle with my offering, with Gh<i>ri</i>ta, Agni who abides turned towards all beings, who widely extends throughout, who is mighty in his vigour, who shows himself most capacious by the food (which he consumes), and robust <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:4:1">1</a>.</p>  
 <p>5. I besprinkle Him who is turned towards (us) from all sides; may he gladly accept that with his benevolent mind. Agni, who is like a beautiful youth, who has the appearance of one eagerly striving, is not to be touched, when he hurries around with his body.</p>  
 <p>6. Mayst thou know the portion (belonging to thee), being strong through thy desire. With thee as our messenger may we speak like Manu. Gaining</p>

 <p>wealth <a href="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:6:1">1</a> I invoke with my (sacrificial) ladle, with my eloquence, the faultless Agni who mixes the honey-drink.</p>  <h3 align="center">NOTES.</h3>  
 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi and metre. On the position of this hymn in the collection and its division into T<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, see the note on II, 9.—Verses 4–5 = VS. XI, 23–24; TS. IV, 1, 2, 4. 5; MS. II, 7, 2.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:1:1">1</a>. Comp. VII, 2, 3. Mánunâ sámiddham.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:1:2">2</a>. Í<i>d</i> is a synonym of í<i>d</i>â; i<i>l</i>á<i>h</i> padé means the same as í<i>l</i>âyâ<i>h</i> padé.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:2:1">1</a>. I cannot accept Prof. Lanman's scansion of this Pâda (Noun-Inflection, 342), utá arushâ´ha <i>k</i>akre víbh<i>ri</i>tra<i>h</i>. In my opinion the only reading in conformity with the use of Vedic poets is utâ´rushâ´ áha, &amp;c.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:3:1">1</a>. Comp. III, 29, 3 (see below). Of course the kindling-stick is alluded to.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:3:2">2</a>. The wives are the plants.—Comp. Lanman, p. 548.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:3:3">3</a>. The meaning of <i>s</i>íri<i>n</i>â (ἅπαξ λεγόμενον) is unknown. The Indian explanation ('night') of course is a guess, but this guess may be right.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:3:4">4</a>. 'Uncovered by the night,' M. M. On máhobhi<i>h</i>, cf. vol. xxxii, p. 197.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:4:1">1</a>. See vol. xxxii, p. 212.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:10:6:1">1</a>. There is no reason for conjecturing dhanasâ´m (Ludwig). Comp. X, 65, 10. indriyám sómam dhanasâ´<i>h</i> u îmahe.</p>
