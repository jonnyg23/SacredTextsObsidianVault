 <p>1. He who is inflamed after the primitive ordinances, is anointed with ointments <a href="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:1:1">1</a>, the giver of all treasures, he whose hair is flame, whose stately robe is ghee, the purifier, skilled in sacrifice, Agni—that he may sacrifice to the gods.</p>  
 <p>2. As thou hast performed, O Agni, the Hot<i>ri</i>'s duty for the Earth, as thou hast done it for Heaven, O <i>G</i>âtavedas, full of intelligence, in the same way sacrifice with this offering to the gods. Prosper this sacrifice to-day as thou hast done for Manus.</p>  
 <p>3. Thou hast three lives, O <i>G</i>âtavedas, and three births from the Dawn <a href="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:3:1">1</a>, O Agni! Being wise, sacrifice with these to the favour of the gods, and bring luck and welfare to the sacrificer.</p>  
 <p>4. Praising Agni full of splendour, full of beauty, we adore thee, O <i>G</i>âtavedas, deserving to be magnified. Thee the gods have made their messenger, their steward <a href="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:4:1">1</a>, and carrier of offerings, the navel of immortality.</p>  
 <p>5. O Agni, the Hot<i>ri</i> who before thee was an excellent sacrificer, who verily <a href="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:1">1</a> sat down and brought luck by himself <a href="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:2">2</a> sacrifice according to his rules, O intelligent one, and set down our sacrifice at the feast of the gods.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>The <i>Ri</i>shi is Kata Vai<i>s</i>vâmitra, the metre Trish<i>t</i>ubh.—Verse 1 = TB. I, 2, 1, 10. Verse 3 = TB. III, 2, 11, 2;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> MS. IV, 11, 1; 12, 5. Verse 4 = TB. III, 6, 9, 1; MS. IV, 13, 5.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:17:1:1">1</a>. Possibly the poet intended to allude also to the other meaning of aktúbhi<i>h</i>, which means both 'ointments' and 'nights.' The nights render Agni conspicuous and anoint (a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>) him as it were with beauty. I do not believe that the existence of a Vedic word aktú, 'ointment,' should be denied; cf. Bechtel, Nachrichten d. Göttinger Ges. d. Wiss. 1894, p. 398.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:17:3:1">1</a>. See Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 14. Prof. Max Müller translates: Three lives are thine, the dawns are thy three birthplaces, or three dawns are thy birthplaces.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:17:4:1">1</a>. See above, I, 58, 7, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:17:5:1">1</a>. Literally, 'doubly.' Grassmann is right in observing that the Vedic poets show a certain predilection for the word dvitâ´ when speaking of Agni's being established and doing his work at the sacrifice. Prof. Max Muller thinks of Agni's two homes, earth and heaven.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_3:17:5:2">2</a>. On the Hot<i>ri</i> more ancient than Agni, comp. Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I, 109. Probably this simply refers to the Agni or the fire used at former sacrifices.</p>
