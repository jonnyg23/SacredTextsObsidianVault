 <p>1. Come hither, O Vâyu, thou beautiful one <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:1:1">1</a>! These Somas are ready, drink of them, hear our call!</p>  
 <p>2. O Vâyu, the praisers celebrate thee with hymns, they who know the feast-days <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:2:1">1</a>, and have prepared the Soma.</p>  
 <p>3. O Vâyu, thy satisfying stream <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:3:1">1</a> goes to the worshipper, wide-reaching, to the Soma-draught.</p>  
 <p>4. O Indra and Vâyu, these (libations of Soma) are poured out; come hither for the sake of <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:4:1">1</a> our offerings, for the drops (of Soma) long for you.</p>  
 <p>5. O Indra and Vâyu, you perceive the libations, you who are rich in booty <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:5:1">1</a>; come then quickly hither!</p>  
 <p>6. O Vâyu and Indra, come near to the work <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:6:1">1</a> of the sacrificer, quick, thus is my prayer <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:6:2">2</a>, O ye men!</p>  
 <p>7. I call Mitra, endowed with holy strength <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:7:1">1</a>, and Varu<i>n</i>a, who destroys all enemies; who both fulfil a prayer accompanied by fat offerings <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:7:2">2</a>.</p>  
 <p>8. On the right way, O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, you have obtained great wisdom, you who increase the right and adhere to the right <a href="sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:8:1">1</a>;</p>  
 <p>9. These two sages, Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, the mighty, wide-ruling, give us efficient strength.</p>

 <p>Ascribed to Madhu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas Vai<i>s</i>vâmitra, and addressed to Vâyu (1-3), Indra and Vâyu (4-6), and to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a (7-9). Metre, Gâyatrî. Verse 4 = VS. VII, 8; XXXIII, 56; TS. I, 4, 4, 1; MS. I. 3, 6. Verse 7 = SV. II, 197; VS. XXXIII, 57: Verse 8 = SV. II, 198. Verse 9 = SV. II, 199.</p>  
 <p>This hymn, with the hymn I, 3, belongs to the Pra-uga ceremony. It consists of three t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:1:1">1</a>. Dar<i>s</i>ata, as applied to the wind, may be intended for visible, but its more general meaning is conspicuous, clarus, insignis.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:2:1">1</a>. Aharvid, which Benfey translates by tagekundig, Grassmann, die des Tages (Anbruch) kundig, seems to have two meanings. When applied to men, poets or priests, it means those who know (vid) the right days or seasons for every sacrifice, but when it is applied to certain deities, particularly those of the morning, it means finding (vind), bringing back the day, like lucifer. Thus the A<i>s</i>vins are called aharvidâ (VIII, 5, 9; 21). The power (daksha) of Vish<i>n</i>u is called aharvid, conquering, or bringing, the light of the day (I, 156, 4). The priests, as inviting these gods, might possibly themselves be called aharvid, bringing back the light of day, but this seems doubtful.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:3:1">1</a>. This verse, though it seems easy, is really full of difficulties. The meaning of dhenâ is very doubtful. It is explained as lips by native authorities, and would in that case be derived from dhe, to suck. But though this meaning is possible in some passages, particularly where dhene occurs in the dual, in other passages dhenâ seems clearly to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="green">p. 442</font></a></p>  
 <p>mean a stream of milk, or of some other liquid, poured out (vis<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a) from the clouds or at a sacrifice. It often occurs in the dual dhene, and has then been taken as the upper and lower lips (not the nares, as Roth suggests), distinguished from <i>s</i>ipre, the upper and lower jaws. See note on II, 34, 3. Sâya<i>n</i>a (Rv. Bh. I, 101, 10) explains it by <i>g</i>ihvopa<i>g</i>ihvike. Durga adds (Nirukta Bhâshya, VI, 17) âdhastye da<i>m</i>sh<i>t</i>re vâ <i>g</i>ihvopa<i>g</i>ihvike vâ, ity eke, tayor hy anna<i>m</i> dhîyate.</p>  
 <p>Benfey translates: 'Vâyu, deine vorkostende Lippe schreitet zum Opferer, weit hingestreckt zum Somatrank.' Prap<i>ri</i><i>ñ</i><i>k</i>atî can hardly mean vorkostend.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:4:1">1</a>. The instrumental práyobhi<i>h</i> is best translated here by 'for the sake of;' see Wenzel, Instrumental, p. 104.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:5:1">1</a>. On vâ<i>g</i>inî and vâ<i>g</i>a, see 'India, what can it teach us?' pp. 164, 166. The transition of meaning from vâ<i>g</i>a, booty, to vâ<i>g</i>a, wealth in general, finds an analogy in the German kriegen, to obtain, also in Gewinn, and A. S. winnan, to strive, to fight, to obtain. Vâ<i>g</i>inîvasû, in the dual, is a frequent epithet of the A<i>s</i>vins, II, 37, 5; V, 74, 6; 7; 75, 3; 78, 3; VIII, 5, 3; 12; 20; 8, 10; 9, 4; 10, 5; 22, 7; 14; 18; 26, 3; 85, 3; 101, 8; of Indra, III, 42, 5; X, 96, 8.</p>  
 <p>It differs little from vâ<i>g</i>inîvat, which is likewise applied to the A<i>s</i>vins, I, 120, 10, and comes to mean simply wealthy, liberal; cf. I, 122, 8; VII, 69, 1. Vâ<i>g</i>inîvati is an epithet of Ushas, Sarasvatî, and Sindhu. A common phrase is vâ´<i>g</i>ebhi<i>h</i> vâ<i>g</i>ínîvatî, lit. wealthy in wealth, cf. I, 3, 10. Vâ<i>g</i>inî occurs as the feminine of vâ<i>g</i>in, wealthy, or strong, but never in the sense of mare; cf. III, 61, 1. úsha<i>h</i> vâ´<i>g</i>ena vâ<i>g</i>ini, Ushas wealthy by wealth or booty; VI, 61, 6. Sarasvati vâ´geshu vâ<i>g</i>ini, Sarasvati, strong in battles; cf. I, 4, 8; 9. Native commentators generally explain vâ<i>g</i>ini by sacrifice, vâ<i>g</i>inîvasu, by dwelling in the sacrifice. I take vâ<i>g</i>ini in compounds like vâ<i>g</i>inîvasu as a collective</p>  
 <p><a name="page_443"><font size="1" color="green">p. 443</font></a></p>  
 <p>substantive, like padminî, ûhinî, vâhinî, tretinî, anîkinî, &amp;c., and in the sense of wealth; unless we may look upon vâ<i>g</i>inîvat as formed in analogy to such words as tavishî-mat, only that in this case tavishî exists in the sense of strength. Pischel's explanation, Ved. Stud. p. 9, rich in mares, takes for granted the existence of vâ<i>g</i>ini in the sense of mare. I have not found any passage where vâ<i>g</i>inî has necessarily that sense.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:6:1">1</a>. Nishk<i>ri</i>ta can hardly mean here what it means in later Sanskrit, a rendezvous.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:6:2">2</a>. On ítthâ´ dhiyâ´, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 184.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:7:1">1</a>. Pûtádaksha, cf. pûtákratu, VIII, 68, 17.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:7:2">2</a>. Gh<i>ri</i>tâ<i>k</i>î seems to be taken here in a technical sense, like gh<i>ri</i>tavat, i. e. with oblations of butter thrown into the fire. In I, 167, 3, I took gh<i>ri</i>tâ<i>k</i>î in the more general sense of bright, resplendent, while others ascribed to it the meaning of bringing fatness, i. e. rain. It may also mean accompanied by ghee. See B.-R. s. v.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:2:8:1">1</a>. <i>Ri</i>tasp<i>rí</i><i>s</i>, probably not very different from <i>ri</i>tasâ´p.</p>
