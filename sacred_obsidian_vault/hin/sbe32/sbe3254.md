 <p><a name="page_416"><font size="1" color="green">p. 416</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">MA<i>N</i><i>D</i>ALA X, HYMN 78.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ASH<i>T</i>AKA VIII, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 12-13.</h4>  <h4 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.</h4>  
 <p>1. Full of devotion like priests with their prayers, wealthy like pious men, who please the gods with their offerings, beautiful to behold like brilliant kings, without a blemish like the youths of our hamlets—</p>  
 <p>2. They who are gold-breasted like Agni with his splendour, quick to help like self-harnessed winds, good leaders like the oldest experts, they are to the righteous man like Somas, that yield the best protection.</p>  
 <p>3. They who are roaring and hasting like winds, brilliant like the tongues of fires, powerful like mailed soldiers, full of blessings like the prayers of our fathers,</p>  
 <p>4. Who hold together like the spokes of chariot-wheels, who glance forward like victorious heroes, who scatter gh<i>ri</i>ta <a href="sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:4:1">1</a> like wooing youths, who chant beautifully like singers, intoning a hymn of praise,</p>  
 <p>5. Who are swift like the best of horses, who are bounteous like lords of chariots on a suit, who are hastening on like water with downward floods, who are like the manifold <a href="sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:5:1">1</a> Aṅgiras with their (numerous) songs.</p>  
 <p>6. These noble sons of Sindhu <a href="sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:6:1">1</a> are like grinding-stones, they are always like Soma-stones <a href="sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:6:2">2</a>, tearing everything to pieces; these sons of a good mother are like playful children, they are by their glare like a great troop on its march.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="green">p. 417</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. Illumining the sacrifice <a href="sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:7:1">1</a> like the rays of the dawn, they shone forth in their ornaments like triumphant warriors; the Maruts with bright spears seem like running rivers, from afar they measure many miles.</p>  
 <p>8. O gods, make us happy and rich, prospering us, your praisers, O Maruts! Remember our praise and our friendship, for from of old there are always with you gifts of treasures.</p>

 <p>Ascribed to Syûmara<i>s</i>mi Bhârgava. None of its verses occurs elsewhere. Metre, I, 3, 4, 8 Trish<i>t</i>ubh; 2, 5-7 <i>G</i>agatî.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_10:78:4:1">1</a>. Gh<i>ri</i>taprush, Fett sprühend, Gluth austheilend, according to Grassmann; gh<i>ri</i>ta-sprühend, according to Ludwig. Sâya<i>n</i>a takes vareyáva<i>h</i> as wishing to give presents, and explains that such gifts were preceded by a gift of water, so that gh<i>ri</i>taprúsha<i>h</i> would mean, giving water or rain. The real meaning is difficult.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_10:78:5:1">1</a>. Vi<i>s</i>varûpa may have been meant in a more special and mythological sense.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_10:78:6:1">1</a>. Síndhu-mâtara<i>h</i> may be a synonym of P<i>ri</i><i>s</i>ni-mâtara<i>h</i>, sindhu being used as a name of the water in the sky. It may also mean, having the river Sindhu for their mother, i. e. coming from the region of the river. Bergaigne translates (II, 397), 'qui ont pour mère la rivière céleste. Cette rivière peut être une des formes de la vache qui passe aussi pour leur mère.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_10:78:6:2">2</a>. The grâ´vâ<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> and ádraya<i>h</i> are probably meant for stones used for pounding corn and squeezing Soma.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_10:78:7:1">1</a>. On adhvara<i>s</i>rî, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 53.</p>
