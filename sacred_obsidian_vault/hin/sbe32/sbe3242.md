 <p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="green">p. 352</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">MA<i>N</i><i>D</i>ALA V, HYMN 60.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ASH<i>T</i>AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 25.</h4>  <h4 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">To Agni and the Maruts</span>.</h4>  
 <p>1. I implore <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:1">1</a> Agni, the gracious, with salutations, may he sit down here, and gather what we have made <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:2">2</a>. I offer <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:3">3</a> (him sacrifice) as with racing chariots; may I, turning to the right, accomplish this hymn to the Maruts.</p>  
 <p>2. Those who approached on their glorious deer, on their easy chariots, the Rudras, the Maruts,—through fear of you, ye terrible ones, the forests even bend down, the earth shakes, and also the mountain (cloud).</p>  
 <p>3. At your shouting, even the mountain (cloud), grown large, fears, and the ridge of heaven trembles. When you play together, O Maruts, armed with spears, you run together like waters.</p>  
 <p>4. Like rich suitors the Maruts have themselves <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:4:1">1</a> adorned their bodies with golden ornaments; more glorious for glory <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:4:2">2</a>, and powerful on their chariots, they have brought together splendours on their bodies.</p>  
 <p>5. As brothers, no one being the eldest or the youngest, they have grown up together to happiness. Young is their clever father Rudra, flowing with plenty is P<i>ri</i><i>s</i>ni (their mother), always kind to the Maruts.</p>  
 <p>6. O happy Maruts, whether you are in the highest, or in the middle, or in the lowest heaven, from thence, O Rudras, or thou also, O Agni. take notice of this libation which we offer.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="green">p. 353</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. When Agni, and you, wealthy Maruts, drive down from the higher heaven over the ridges, give then, if pleased, you roarers, O destroyers of enemies <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:7:1">1</a>, wealth to the sacrificer who prepares (Soma juice).</p>  
 <p>8. Agni, be pleased to drink Soma with the brilliant Maruts, the singers, approaching in companies <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:8:1">1</a>, with the men (Âyus <a href="sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:8:2">2</a>), who brighten and enliven everything; do this, O Vai<i>s</i>vânara (Agni), thou who art always endowed with splendour.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="green">p. 354</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>This hymn, by the same poet, is supposed to be addressed either to the Maruts alone, or to the Maruts and Agni. The same might have been said of hymn 56 and others which are used for the Âgnimâruta <i>S</i>astra. See Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’histoire de la liturgie védique, p. 38. Metre, 1-6 Trish<i>t</i>ubh; 7, 8 <i>G</i>agatî. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., except verse i in AV. VII, 50, 3; TB. II, 7, 12, 4; MS. IV, 14, 11; verse 3 in TS. III, 1, 11, 5; MS. IV, 12, 5; verse 6 in TB. II, 7, 12, 4.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>The AV. reads svâ´vasum, prasaktó, pradakshi<i>n</i>ám, all of them inferior readings. The TB. agrees with RV., except that it seems to read prasaptá<i>h</i> (prakarshe<i>n</i>a samâgata<i>h</i>).</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:1:1">1</a>. That î<i>l</i> or î<i>d</i> has originally the meaning of imploring, asking, begging, we see from such passages as RV. III, 48, 3. upasthâya mâtáram ánnam ai<i>t</i><i>t</i>a, 'he, having approached his mother, asked for food,' unless we prefer to construe î<i>d</i> with two accusatives, 'he, having approached, asked his mother for food.' The same verb is also construed with the accusative of the god implored, the dative of the object, and the instrumental of the means by which he is implored. See RV. VIII, 71, 14. agním î<i>li</i>shva ávase gâ´thâbhi<i>h</i>, implore Agni with songs for his protection. Whether the root î<i>d</i> is distantly connected with either ish, to desire (Brugmann, I, 591), or with ard, to stir, or with ar, to go, is a question which admits of many, or of no answer.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:1:2">2</a>. Vi<i>k</i>i k<i>ri</i>tam seems to have the settled meaning of gathering in what one has made at play, or in battle; see X, 42, 9; 43, 5; IX, 97, 58; X, 102, 2. The same meaning is applicable here, though we may also translate, Take notice of our k<i>ri</i>ta or our karma, i. e. the sacrifice.' A similar thought is expressed in verse 6. Sâya<i>n</i>a explains vi<i>g</i>ânâtu and vi<i>k</i>inuyât.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:1:3">3</a>. Perhaps prá bhare means, 'I am carried forth,' as in V, 59, 4, where it is applied to the Maruts.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="green">p. 355</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:4:1">1</a>. See note 2 to I, 6, 4. Instead of svadhâ´bhi<i>h</i> we have svayám in VII, 56, 11.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:4:2">2</a>. <i>S</i>riyé <i>s</i>réyâ<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> is difficult to translate; cf. II, 33, 3. srésh<i>th</i>a<i>h</i> <i>s</i>riyâ´ asi. Ludwig translates, zu herlichkeit die herlichen.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:7:1">1</a>. On ri<i>s</i>âdas, see Aufrecht, Bezzenb. Beitr. XIV, p. 32.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:8:1">1</a>. On ga<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>rî´, see BR. s. v.; Lanman, 372; Benfey Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 108; Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, 53 seq. Ludwig translates scharenherlich, but what does that mean? 'Shining in their companies' is a possible meaning, but the analogy of abhi<i>s</i>rî´ and adhvara<i>s</i>rî´ points in another direction.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_5:60:8:2">2</a>. On the Âyus as a proper name, see Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. I, 62; II, 323.</p>
