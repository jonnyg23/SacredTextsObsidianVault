 <p>The most powerful instrument that has hitherto been applied to the emendation of Vedic texts, is the metre. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Metrical criticism.</font></span>Metre means measure, and uniform measure, and hence its importance for critical purposes, as second only to that of grammar. If our knowledge of the metrical system of the Vedic poets rests on a sound basis, any deviations from the general rule are rightly objected to; and if by a slight alteration they can be removed, and the metre be restored, we naturally feel inclined to adopt such emendations. Two safeguards, however, are needed in this kind of conjectural criticism. We ought to be quite certain that the anomaly is impossible, and we ought to be able to explain to a certain extent</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxviii</font></a></p>  
 <p>how the deviation from the original correct text could have occurred. As this subject has of late years received considerable attention, and as emendations of the Vedic texts, supported by metrical arguments, have been carried on on a very large scale, it becomes absolutely necessary to reexamine the grounds on which these emendations are supposed to rest. There are, in fact, but few hymns in which some verses or some words have not been challenged for metrical reasons, and I feel bound, therefore, at the very beginning of my translation of the Rig-veda, to express my own opinion on this subject, and to give my reasons why in so many cases I allow metrical anomalies to remain which by some of the most learned and ingenious among Vedic scholars would be pronounced intolerable.</p>  
 <p>Even if the theory of the ancient metres had not been so carefully worked out by the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhyas and the Anukrama<i>n</i>îs, an independent study of the Veda would have enabled us to discover the general rules by which the Vedic poets were guided in the composition of their works. Nor would it have been difficult to show how constantly these general principles are violated by the introduction of phonetic changes which in the later Sanskrit are called the euphonic changes of Sandhi, and according to which final vowels must be joined with initial vowels, and final consonants adapted to initial consonants, until at last each sentence becomes a continuous chain of closely linked syllables.</p>  
 <p>It is far easier, as I remarked before, to discover the original and natural rhythm of the Vedic hymns by reading them in the Pada than in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text, and after some practice our ear becomes sufficiently schooled to tell us at once how each line ought to be pronounced. We find, on the one hand, that the rules of Sandhi, instead of being generally binding, were treated by the Vedic poets as poetical licences only; and, on the other, that a greater freedom of pronunciation was allowed even in the body of words than would be tolerated in the later Sanskrit. If a syllable was wanted to complete the metre, a semivowel might be pronounced as a vowel, many a long vowel might</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxix"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxix</font></a></p>  
 <p>be protracted so as to count for two syllables, and short vowels might be inserted between certain consonants, of which no trace exists in the ordinary Sanskrit. If, on the contrary, there were too many syllables, then the rules of Sandhi were observed, or two short syllables contracted by rapid pronunciation into one; nay, in a few cases, a final m or s, it seems, was omitted. It would be a mistake to suppose that the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhyas were not aware of this freedom allowed or required in the pronunciation of the Vedic hymns. Though they abstained from introducing into the text changes of pronunciation which even we ourselves would never tolerate, if inserted in the texts of Homer and Plautus, in the Pâli verses of Buddha, or even in modern English poetry, the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya were clearly aware that in many places one syllable had to be pronounced as two, or two as one. They were clearly aware that certain vowels, generally considered as long, had to be pronounced as short, and that in order to satisfy the demands of the metre, certain changes of pronunciation were indispensable. They knew all this, but they did not change the text. And this shows that the text, as they describe it, enjoyed even in their time a high authority, that they did not make it, but that, such as it is, with all its incongruities, it had been made before their time. In many cases, no doubt, certain syllables in the hymns of the Veda had been actually lengthened or shortened in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text in accordance with the metre in which they are composed. But this was done by the poets themselves, or, at all events, it was not done by the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya. They simply register such changes, but they do not enjoin them, and in this we, too, should follow their example. It is, therefore, a point of some importance in the critical restoration and proper pronunciation of Vedic texts, that in the rules which we have to follow in order to satisfy the demands of the metre, we should carefully distinguish between what is sanctioned by ancient authority, and what is the result of our own observations. This I shall now proceed to do.</p>  
 <p>First, then, the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya distinctly admit</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxx"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxx</font></a></p>  
 <p>that, in order to uphold the rules they have themselves laid down, certain syllables are to be pronounced as two syllables. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Vyûha.</font></span>We read in Sûtra 527: 'In a deficient pâda the right number is to be provided for by protraction of semivowels (which were originally vowels), and of contracted vowels (which were originally two independent vowels).' It is only by this process that the short syllable which has been lengthened in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, viz. the sixth, or the eighth, or the tenth, can be shown to have occupied and to occupy that place where alone, according to a former rule, a short syllable is liable to be lengthened. Thus we read:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I, 161, 11. ūdvātsv̅̆a̅̄smâ̄ ăk<i>rĭ</i><i>n</i>ōtănâ̄ t<i>rĭ</i><i>n</i>am.</div>  
 <p>This would seem to be a verse of eleven syllables, in which the ninth syllable na has been lengthened. This, however, is against the system of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya. But if we protract the semivowel v in udvatsv, and change it back into u, which it was originally, then we gain one syllable, the whole verse has twelve syllables, na occupies the tenth place, and it now belongs to that class of cases which is included in a former Sûtra, 523.</p>  
 <p>The same applies to X, 103, 13, where we read:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">pr̅̆e̅̆tâ̄ <i>g</i>ăyătâ̄ nărā<i>h</i>.</div>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> This is a verse of seven syllables, in which the fifth syllable is lengthened, without any authority. Let us protract pretâ by bringing it back to its original component elements pra itâ, and we get a verse of eight syllables, the sixth syllable now falls under the general observation, and is lengthened in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ accordingly.</p>  
 <p>The same rules are repeated in a later portion of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya. Here rules had been given as to the number of syllables of which certain metres consist, and it is added (Sûtras 972, 973) that where that number is deficient, it should be completed by protracting contracted vowels, and by separating consonantal groups in which semivowels (originally vowels) occur, by means of their corresponding vowel.</p>  
 <p>The rules in both places are given in almost identically</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxi</font></a></p>  
 <p>the same words, and the only difference between the two passages is this, that, according to the former, semivowels are simply changed back into their vowels, while, according to the latter, the semivowel remains, but is separated from the preceding consonant by its corresponding vowel.</p>  
 <p>These rules therefore show clearly that the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, though they would have shrunk from altering one single letter of the authorised Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, recognised the fact that where two vowels had been contracted into one, they might yet be pronounced as two; and where a vowel before another vowel had been changed into a semivowel, it might either be pronounced as a vowel, or as a semivowel preceded by its corresponding vowel. More than these two modifications, however, the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya does not allow, or, at least, does not distinctly sanction. The commentator indeed tries to show that by the wording of the Sûtras in both places, a third modification is sanctioned, viz. the vocalisation, in the body of a word, of semivowels which do not owe their origin to an original vowel. But in both places this interpretation is purely artificial. Some such rule ought to have been given, but it was not given by the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya. It ought to have been given, for it is only by observing such a rule that in I, 61, 12, gōr nă pa̅̆rv̆ă̆ vĭ rădâ̄ tĭrā<i>s</i><i>k</i>â̆, we get a verse of eleven syllables, and thus secure for dâ in radâ the eighth place, where alone the short a could be lengthened. Yet we look in vain for a rule sanctioning the change of semivowels into vowels, except where the semivowels can rightly be called kshaipra-var<i>n</i>a (Sûtra 974), i. e. semivowels that were originally vowels. The independent (svâbhâvika) semivowels, as e. g. the v in parva, are not included; and to suppose that in Sûtra 527 these semivowels were indicated by var<i>n</i>a is impossible, particularly if we compare the similar wording of Sûtra 974 <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">a</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxii</font></a></p>  
 <p>We look in vain, too, in the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya for another rule according to which long vowels, even if they do not owe their origin to the coalescence of two vowels, are liable to be protracted. However, this rule, too, though never distinctly sanctioned, is observed in the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, for unless its author observed it, he could not have obtained in the verses quoted by the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya the number of syllables which he ascribes to them. According to Sûtra 937, the verse, RV. X, 134, 1, is a Mahâpaṅkti, and consists of six pâdas, of eight syllables each. In order to obtain that number, we must read:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">sāmrâ̄<i>g</i>ām <i>k</i>ārshă<i>n</i>î̄nâ̅̆m̅̄.</div>  
 <p>We may therefore say that, without allowing any actual change in the received text of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya distinctly allows a lengthened pronunciation of certain syllables, which in the Pada text form two syllables; and we may add that, by implication, it allows the same even in cases where the Pada text also gives but one instead of two syllables. Having this authority in our favour, I do not think that we use too much liberty if we extend this modified pronunciation, recognised in so many cases by the ancient scholars of India themselves, to other cases where it seems to us required as well, in order to satisfy the metrical rules of the Veda.</p>  
 <p>Secondly, I believe it can be proved that, if not the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, those at least who constituted <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Shortening of long vowels.</font></span>the Vedic text which was current in the ancient schools and which we now have before us, were fully aware that certain long vowels and diphthongs could be used as short. The authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya remark that certain changes which can take place before a short syllable only, take place likewise before the word no, although the vowel of this 'no' is by them supposed to be long. After having stated in Sûtra 523 that the eighth syllable of hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxiii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxiii</font></a></p>  
 <p>follows, they remark that for this purpose na<i>h</i> or no is treated as a short syllable:</p>  
 <p>X, 59, 4. dyŭ-bhī<i>h</i> hĭtā<i>h</i> <i>g</i>ărĭmâ̄ sŭ nă̂<i>h</i> āstū, (Sa<i>m</i>h. sû no astu.)</p>  
 <p>Again, in stating that the tenth syllable of hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable follows, the same exception is understood to be made in favour of na<i>h</i> or no, as a short syllable:</p>  
 <p>VII, 48, 4. nŭ dēvâ̄sā<i>h</i> vărĭvā<i>h</i> kārtănă nā<i>h</i>, (Sa<i>m</i>h. kārtănâ̄ nŏ, bhûta no, &amp;c.)</p>  
 <p>With regard to e being shortened before a short a where, according to rule, the a should be elided, we actually find that the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ gives a instead of e in RV. VIII, 72, 5. véti stótave ambyãm, Sa<i>m</i>h. véti stótava ambyãm. (Prâti<i>s</i>. 177, 5.)</p>  
 <p>I do not ascribe very much weight to the authority which we may derive from these observations with regard to our own treatment of the diphthongs e and o as either long or short in the Veda, yet in answer to those who are incredulous as to the fact that the vowels e and o could ever be short in Sanskrit, an appeal to the authority of those who constituted our text, and in constituting it clearly treated o as a short vowel, may not be without weight. We may also appeal to the fact that in Pâli and Prâk<i>ri</i>t every final o and e can be treated as either long or short <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">a</font></a>. Starting from this we may certainly extend this observation, as it has been extended by Professor Kuhn, but we must not extend it too far It is quite clear that in the same verse e and o can be used both as long and short. I give the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text:</p>  
 <p>I, 84, 17.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">ka îshate | tu<i>g</i>yate kō bĭbhâ̄yā<br> ko ma<i>m</i>sate | santam indrā<i>m</i> kŏ āntī,<br> kas tokâya | ka ibhâyōtă râ̄yē<br> adhi bravat | tanve kō <i>g</i>ănâ̄yā.</div>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxiv</font></a></p>  
 <p>But although there can be no doubt that e and o, when final, or at the end of the first member of a compound, may be treated in the Veda as anceps, there is no evidence, I believe, to show that the same licence applies to a medial or initial e or o. In IV, 45, 5, we must scan</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">usrâ<i>h</i> <i>g</i>arante prati vastō<i>h</i> ā<i>s</i>vĭnâ̄,</div>  
 <p>ending the verse with an epitritus tertius instead of the usual dijambus <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">a</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Thirdly, the fact that the initial short a, if following upon a word ending in o or e, is frequently not to be elided, is clearly recognised by the authors of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya (see <a href="sbe3205.htm#page_xlviii">p. xlviii</a>). Nay, that they wished it to be pronounced even in passages where, in accordance with the requirements of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, it had to disappear in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text, we may conclude from Sûtra 978. It is there stated that no pâda should ever begin with a word that has no accent. The exceptions to this rule are few, and they are discussed in Sûtras 978-987. But if the initial a were not pronounced in I, 1, 9, sá<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> pitâ´-iva sûnáve ágne su-upâyaná<i>h</i> bhava, the second pâda would begin with <font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>gne, a word which, after the elision of the initial a, would be a word without an accent <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">b</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Fourthly, the fact that other long vowels, besides e and o, may under certain circumstances be used as short in the Veda, is not merely a modern theory, but rests on no less an authority than Pâ<i>n</i>ini himself.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxv"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxv</font></a></p>  
 <p>Pâ<i>n</i>ini says, VI, I, 127, that i, u, <i>ri</i> (see RV. Bh. IV, 1, 12) at the end of a pada (but not in a compound <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">a</font></a>) may remain unchanged, if a different vowel follows, and that, if long, they may be shortened. He ascribes this rule, or, more correctly, the first portion of it only, to <i>S</i>âkalya, Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya 155 seq. <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">b</font></a> Thus <i>k</i>akrî atra may become <i>k</i>akrĭ atra or <i>k</i>akry atra. Madhû atra may become madhŭ atra or madhv atra. In VI, 1, 128, Pâ<i>n</i>ini adds that a, i, u, <i>ri</i> may remain unchanged before <i>ri</i>, and, if long, may be shortened, and this again according to the teaching of <i>S</i>âkalya, i. e. Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya 136 <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">c</font></a>. Hence brahmâ <i>ri</i>shi<i>h</i> becomes brahmă <i>ri</i>shi<i>h</i> or brahmarshi<i>h</i>; kumârî <i>ri</i><i>s</i>ya<i>h</i> becomes kumârĭ <i>ri</i><i>s</i>ya<i>h</i> or kumâry <i>ri</i><i>s</i>ya<i>h</i>. This rule enables us to explain a number of passages in which the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text either changes the final long vowel into a semivowel, or leaves it unchanged, when the vowel is a prag<i>ri</i>hya vowel. To the first class belong such passages as I, 163, 12; IV, 38, 10, vâ<i>g</i>î´ árvâ, Sa<i>m</i>h. vâ<i>g</i>yárvâ; VI, 7, 3, vâ<i>g</i>î´ agne, Sa<i>m</i>h. vâ<i>g</i>yãgne; VI, 20, 13, pakthî´ arkaí<i>h</i>, Sa<i>m</i>h. pakthyãrkaí<i>h</i>; IV, 22, 4, <i>s</i>ushmî´ â´ gó<i>h</i>, Sa<i>m</i>h. <i>s</i>ushmyâ´ gó<i>h</i>. In these passages î is the termination of a nom. masc. of a stem ending in in. Secondly, IV, 24, 8, pátnî á<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a, Sa<i>m</i>h. pátnyá<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a; IV, 34, 1, devî´ áhnâm, Sa<i>m</i>h. devyáhnâm; V, 75, 4, vâ´<i>n</i>î<i>k</i>i â´-hitâ, Sa<i>m</i>h. vâ´<i>n</i>î<i>k</i>yâ´hitâ; VI, 61, 4, avitrî´ avatu, Sa<i>m</i>h. avitryãvatu. In these passages the î is the termination of feminines. In X, 15, 4, ûtî´ arvâ´k, Sa<i>m</i>h. ûtyãrvâ´k, the final î of the instrumental ûtî ought not to have been changed into a semivowel, for, though not followed by íti, it is to be treated as prag<i>ri</i>hya; (Prâti<i>s</i>. 163, 5.) It is, however,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxvi</font></a></p>  
 <p>mentioned as an exception in Sûtra 174, 9. The same applies to II, 3, 4, védî íti asyâ´m, Sa<i>m</i>h. védyasyâ´m. The prag<i>ri</i>hya î ought not to have been changed into a semivowel, but the fact that it had been changed irregularly, was again duly registered in Sûtra 174, 5. These two prag<i>ri</i>hya î therefore, which have really to be pronounced short, were irregularly changed in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ into the semivowel; and as this semivowel, like all semivowels, may take vyavâya, the same object was attained as if it had been written by a short vowel. With regard to prag<i>ri</i>hya û, no such indication is given by the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text; but in such passages as I, 46, 13, <i>s</i>ambhû íti <i>s</i>am-bhû â´ gatam, Sa<i>m</i>h. <i>s</i>ambhû â´ gatam; V, 43, 4, bâhû´ íti ádrim, Sa<i>m</i>h. bâhû´ ádrim, the prag<i>ri</i>hya û of the dual can be used as short, like the û of madhû atra, given as an example by the commentators of Pâ<i>n</i>ini.</p>  
 <p>To Professor Kuhn, I believe, belongs the merit of having extended this rule to final â. That the â of the dual may become short, was mentioned in the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, Sûtra 309, though in none of the passages there mentioned is there any metrical necessity for this shortening (see <a href="sbe3205.htm#page_lii">p. lii</a>). This being the case, it is impossible to deny that where this â is followed by a vowel, and where Sandhi between the two vowels is impossible, the final â may be treated as short. Whether it must be so treated, depends on the view which we take of the Vedic metres, and will have to be discussed hereafter.</p>  
 <p>I agree with Professor Kuhn when he scans:</p>  
 <p>VI, 63, 1. kv̆ă tyâ̄ vālgû̄ pŭrŭ-hû̄tâ̆ ādyā, (Sa<i>m</i>h. puru-hûtâdya); and not kv̆ā ty̆â̄ vālgû̄ pŭrŭhû̄tâ̄dyā, although we might quote other verses as ending with an epitritus primus.</p>  
 <p>IV, 3, 13. mâ̄ vē<i>s</i>āsyă pră-mĭnătā<i>h</i> mâ̆ â̄pē<i>h</i>, (Sa<i>m</i>h. mâpe<i>h</i>,) although the dispondeus is possible.</p>  
 <p>I, 77, 1. kăthâ̄ dâ̄<i>s</i>ēmă āgnăyē kâ̆ āsmai, (Sa<i>m</i>h. kâsmai.)</p>  
 <p>VI, 24, 5. āryā<i>h</i> vă<i>s</i>āsyă părĭ-ētâ̆ āstī.</p>  
 <p>Even in a compound like tvâ-ûta, I should shorten the first vowel, e. g.</p>  
 <p>X, 148, 1. tmănâ̄ tănâ̄ sănŭyâ̄mă tvâ̆-û̄tâ̄<i>h</i>,</p>  
 <p>although the passage is not mentioned by the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxvii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxvii</font></a></p>  
 <p>among those where a short final vowel in the eighth place is not lengthened when a short syllable follows <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">a</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>But when we come to the second pâda of a Gâyatrî, and find there a long â, and that long â not followed by a vowel, I cannot agree with Professor Kuhn, that the long â, even under such circumstances, ought to be shortened. We may scan:</p>  
 <p>V, 5, 7. vâ̄tāsyă pātmăn î̄<i>l</i>ĭtâ̄ dāivyâ̄ hōtâ̄râ̄ mănŭshā<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>The same choriambic ending occurs even in the last pâda of a Gâyatrî, and is perfectly free from objection at the end of the other pâdas.</p>  
 <p>So, again, we may admit the shortening of au to o in sâno avye and sâno avyaye, as quoted in the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, 174 and 177, but this would not justify the shortening of au to av in Anush<i>t</i>ubh verses, such as</p>  
 <p>V, 86, 5.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">mārtâ̄yă dēvâū ădăbhâ̄,<br> ā<i>m</i><i>s</i>â̄-ivă dēvâ̄u ārvătē,</div>  
 <p>while, with regard to the Trish<i>t</i>ubh and <i>G</i>agatî verses, our views on these metres must naturally depend on the difficulties we meet with in carrying them out systematically.</p>  
 <p>There is no reason for shortening â in</p>  
 <p>V, 5, 10. dēvâ̄nâ̄m gūhyâ̄ nâ̄mâ̄nī.</p>  
 <p>It is the second pâda of a Gâyatrî here; and we shall see that, even in the third pâda, four long syllables occur again and again.</p>  
 <p>For the same reason I cannot follow Dr. Kuhn in a number of other passages where, for the sake of the metre, he proposes to change a long â into a short one. Such passages are in the Pada text:</p>  
 <p>VI, 46, 11. dīdyăvā<i>h</i> tīgmă-mû̄rdhâ̄nā<i>h</i>, not mû̄rdhâ̆nā<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>I, 15, 6. <i>rĭ</i>tŭnâ̄ yā<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ăm â̄<i>s</i>â̄thē, not â̄<i>s</i>â̆thē.</p>  
 <p>V, 66, 2. sāmyăk ăsūryăm â̄<i>s</i>â̄tē, not â̄<i>s</i>â̆tē.</p>  
 <p>V, 67, 1. vārshīsh<i>th</i>ām kshātrăm â̄sâ̄thē, not â̄<i>s</i>â̆thē. See Beiträge, vol. iii, p. 122.</p>  
 <p>I, 46, 6. tâ̄m āsmē râ̄sâ̄thâ̄m ĭshām, not râ̄sâ̆thâ̄m ĭshām.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxviii</font></a></p>  
 <p>IV, 32, 23. băbhrû̄ yâ̄mēshŭ <i>s</i>ōbhētē, not <i>s</i>ōbhĕtē.</p>  
 <p>IV, 45, 3. ŭtă prĭyām mădhŭnē yū<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>â̄thâ̄m răthām, not yū<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>â̆thâ̄m răthām.</p>  
 <p>V. 74, 3. kăm ā<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ă yū<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>â̄thē răthām, not yū<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>â̆thē răthām.</p>  
 <p>IV, 55, 1. dyâ̄vâ̄bhû̄mî̄ (íti) ădĭtē trâ̄sî̄thâ̄m nā<i>h</i>, not trâ̄sî̆thâ̄m nā<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>V, 41, 1. <i>rĭ</i>tāsyă vâ̄ sădăsĭ trâ̄sî̄thâ̄m nā<i>h</i>, not trâ̄sî̆thâ̄m nā<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>I must enter the same protest against shortening other long vowels in the following verses which Professor Kuhn proposes to make metrically correct by this remedy:</p>  
 <p>I, 42, 6. hĭrā<i>n</i>yăvâ̄<i>s</i>î̄māt-tămā, not vâ̄<i>s</i>î̆māt-tȃmā.</p>  
 <p>Here the short syllable of ga<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>rĭ-bhi<i>h</i> in V, 60, 8, cannot be quoted as a precedent, for the i in ga<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>ri, walking in companies, was never long, and could therefore not be shortened. Still less can we quote nâri-bhya<i>h</i> as an instance of a long î being shortened, for nâri-bhya<i>h</i> is derived from nâri<i>h</i>, not from nârî, and occurs with a short i even when the metre requires a long syllable; I, 43, 6. n<i>ri̅</i>-bhyā<i>h</i> nâ̄rĭ̄-bhy̆ā<i>h</i> găvē. The fact is, that in the Rig-veda the forms nârishu and nârî-bhya<i>h</i> never occur, but always nârishu, nâri-bhya<i>h</i>; while from vâ<i>s</i>î we never find any forms with short i, but always vâ´<i>s</i>îshu, vâ´<i>s</i>î-bhi<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Nor is there any justification for change in I, 25, 16. gâ̄vā<i>h</i> nă gāvyû̄tî̄<i>h</i> ănū, the second pâda of a Gâyatrî. Nor in V, 56, 3. <i>ri̅</i>kshā<i>h</i> nă vā<i>h</i> mărŭtā<i>h</i> <i>s</i>ĭmî̄-vâ̄n ămā<i>h</i>. In most of the passages mentioned by Professor Kuhn on p. 122, this peculiarity may be observed, that the eighth syllable is short, or, at all events, may be short, when the ninth is long:</p>  
 <p>VI, 44, 21. v<i>ri̅</i>sh<i>n</i>ē tē īndū<i>h</i> v<i>rĭ</i>shăbhă ̍ pî̄pâ̄yā.</p>  
 <p>I, 73, 1. sy̆ōnă-<i>s</i>î̄<i>h</i> ătĭthī<i>h</i> nă ̍ prî̄<i>n</i>â̄nāh.</p>  
 <p>VII, 13, 1. bhărē hăvī<i>h</i> nă bărhĭshĭ ̍ iprî̄<i>n</i>â̄nā<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>II, 28, 7. ēnā<i>h</i> k<i>ri̅</i><i>n</i>vāntăm ăsŭră ̍ bhrî̄<i>n</i>āntī.</p>  
 <p>Before, however, we can settle the question whether in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxix"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxix</font></a></p>  
 <p>these and other places certain vowels should be pronounced as either long or short, we must settle the more general <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Metre and Grammar.</font></span>question, what authority we have for requiring a long or a short syllable in certain places of the Vedic metres.</p>

M. Regnier was right, Professor Kuhn (Beiträge, vol. iv, p. 187) was wrong. Uva<i>t</i>a, no doubt, wishes to show that original (svâbhâvika) semivowels are liable to vyûha, or at least <a name="page_lxxxii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxii</font></a> to vyavâya; but though this is true in fact, Uva<i>t</i>a does not succeed in his attempt to prove that the rules of the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya sanction it.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_39"></a><a href="sbe3210.htm#fr_48">lxxxiv:a</a> See Professor Weber's pertinent remarks in Kuhn's Beiträge, vol. iii, p. 394. I do not think that in the verses adduced by Professor Kuhn, in which final o is considered by him as an iambus or trochee, this scanning is inevitable. Thus we may scan the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text:</p>  
 <p>I, 88, 2. rūkmō nă <i>k</i>ītr̆ā<i>h</i> sv̆ădhĭtî̄vâ̄n.</p>  
 <p>I, 141, 8. răthō nă ȳâ̆tă<i>h</i> <i>s</i>īkv̆ăbhī<i>h</i> k<i>rĭ</i>tō.</p>  
 <p>I, 174, 3. sī<i>m</i>hō nă dămĕ ăp̆â̄<i>m</i>sĭ vāstō<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>VI, 24, 3. ākshō nă <i>k</i>ākry̆ō<i>h</i> <i>s</i>̆û̄ră b<i>rĭ</i>hān</p>  
 <p>X, 3, 1. ĭnō r̆â̄gānn ărătīh sămīddhō.</p>  
 <p>This leaves but one of Professor Kuhn's examples (Beiträge, vol. iv, p. 192) unexplained: I, 191, 1. kaṅkato na kaṅkato, where iva for na would remove the difficulty.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_40"></a><a href="sbe3210.htm#fr_49">lxxxiv:b</a> This subject, the shortness of e and o in the Veda, has been admirably treated by Mr. Maurice Bloomfield, 'Final as before Sonants,' Baltimore, 1882. Reprinted from the American Journal of Philology, vol. iii, No. 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_41"></a><a href="sbe3210.htm#fr_50">lxxxv:a</a> There are certain compounds in which, according to Professor Kuhn, two vowels have been contracted into one short vowel. This is certainly the opinion of Hindu grammarians, also of the compiler of the Pada text. But most of them would admit of another explanation. Thus dhánvar<i>n</i>asa<i>h</i>, which is divided into dhánva-ar<i>n</i>asa<i>h</i>, may be dhánu-ar<i>n</i>asa<i>h</i> (RV. V, 45, 2). Dhánar<i>k</i>am, divided into dhána-ar<i>k</i>am, may have been dhána-<i>ri</i><i>k</i>am (RV. X, 46, 5). <i>S</i>atár<i>k</i>asam (RV. VII, too, 3) may be taken as <i>s</i>atá-<i>ri</i><i>k</i>asam instead of <i>s</i>atá-ar<i>k</i>asam.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="sbe3210.htm#fr_51">lxxxv:b</a> In the Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya the rule which allows vowel before vowel to remain unchanged, is restricted to special passages, and in some of them the two vowels are savar<i>n</i>a; cf. Sûtra 163.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="sbe3210.htm#fr_52">lxxxv:c</a> Cf. Vâ<i>g</i>asan. Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, IV, 48; Indische Studien, vol. ix, 309; vol. x, 406.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_44"></a><a href="sbe3210.htm#fr_53">lxxxvii:a</a> I see that Professor Kuhn, vol. iv, p. 186, has anticipated this observation in esh<i>t</i>au, to be read â̆-īsh<i>t</i>aū.</p>
