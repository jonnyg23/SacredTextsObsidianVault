 <p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">Note that the original lexicographic ordering of this index, preserved in this transcription, is based on the Sanskrit alphabet. Also see the transcription notes, below.—<i>JBH</i></font></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> following Index of Words was commenced by Professor Thibaut, and continued and finished by Dr. Winternitz. I beg to express my gratitude to both of them, more particularly to Dr. Winternitz, who has spared no pains in order to make the Index as complete and as accurate as possible.—F. M. M.</p>  
 <p>The Index contains all the words of the hymns translated in this volume, and besides, all the words about which something is said in the Notes.</p>  
 <p>The lists of passages are complete, except when three dots (…) are put after the word (e. g. á<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a …). </p>  
 <p>Three figures refer to Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala, hymn, and verse, a small figure to a note, e. g. X, 77, 2:1, stands for Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala X, hymn 77, verse 2, note 1 (the word occurs in X, 77, 2, and also in note 1).</p>  
 <p>If a word occurs in a note only, the passage is put in parentheses, e. g. (V, 61, 4<sup>1</sup>) means that the word occurs in note 1 on V, 61, 4, but <i>not</i> in V, 61, 4.</p>  
 <p>In the case of longer notes, it seemed advisable to refer to the page. <i>One</i> number refers to the page, e. g. (287) means that the word occurs in a note on page 287.</p>  <h4 align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">NOTES ON THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THIS INDEX.</font></h4>  
 <p><font size="-1" color="green">The format of this transcription of the index varies slightly from the printed version so that this section can be parsed automatically if needed.</font></p>  
 <p><font size="-1" color="green">In the printed edition, the main entry appeared on a line by itself, followed by a colon, with successive forms on the next line indented one level. Sub-entries appeared on separate lines, with more indentation. The entries have been, essentially, flattened in this transcription: in other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between entries and lines.</font></p>  
 <p><font size="-1" color="green">Only explicit page number references have been hyperlinked.</font></p>  
 <p><font size="-1" color="green">In the printed version, footnotes are indicated by superscripts. In this transcription, footnotes are prefixed by a colon following the verse number. For instance, X, 77, 2:1 originally appeared as X, 77, 2<sup>1</sup>. In the case where multiple superscripts appeared, a colon followed by the footnotes in square brackets: X, 77, 2:[1, 2] was originally X, 77, 2<sup>1, 2</sup>. However, footnotes with lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.) are transcribed with a superscript, e. g. Note <sup>a</sup>, as in the original. This only applies to the Index of Words section: everywhere else in the transcription of this book, superscripts are used to indicate footnotes as in the original.—<i>JBH</i></font></p>
