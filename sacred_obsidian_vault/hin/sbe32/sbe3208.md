 <p>Having said so much in vindication of the text of the Rig-veda as published by me, and in defence of my principles of criticism which seem to me so self-evident as hardly to deserve the name of canones critici, I feel bound at the same time both to acknowledge some inaccuracies that have occurred in the index at the end of each volume, and to defend some entries in that index which have been challenged without sufficient cause.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxviii</font></a></p>  
 <p>It has been supposed that in the index at the end of my fourth volume, the seventeenth verse of the 34th hymn in <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Sâya<i>n</i>a's quotations from the Sarvânukrama<i>n</i>î.</font></span>the seventh Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala has been wrongly assigned to Ahi Budhnya, and that one half only of that verse should have been reserved for that deity. I do not deny that we should be justified in deriving that sense from the words of the Anukrama<i>n</i>ikâ, but I cannot admit that my own interpretation is untenable. As Sâya<i>n</i>a does not speak authoritatively on the subject, I followed the authority of Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya. This commentator of the Anukrama<i>n</i>ikâ says: atra <i>k</i>a ab<i>g</i>âm ukthair ahim g<i>ri</i><i>n</i>îsha ity ardhar<i>k</i>o<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>b<i>g</i>anâmno <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">a</font></a> devasya stuti<i>h</i>; mâ no<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>hir budhnya ity ardhar<i>k</i>o<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>hirbudhnyanâmno devasya <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">b</font></a>. Another commentator says: ab<i>g</i>âm ukthair ardhar<i>k</i>o<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>hi<i>h</i>; uttaro mâ no<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>hir ity ahir budhnya<i>h</i>. From this we learn that both commentators looked upon the Dvipadâs as ardhar<i>k</i>as or half-verses, and ascribed the whole of verse 16 to Ahir ab<i>g</i>â<i>h</i>, the whole of verse 17 to Ahir budhnya<i>h</i>. It will be seen from an accurate examination of Sâya<i>n</i>a's commentary on verse 17, that in the second interpretation of the second half of verse 17, he labours to show that in this portion, too, Ahir budhnya<i>h</i> may be considered as the deity.</p>  
 <p>It is perfectly right to say that the words of the Anukrama<i>n</i>ikâ, ab<i>g</i>âm ahe<i>h</i>, signify that the verse beginning with ab<i>g</i>âm, belongs to Ahi. But there was no misprint in my index. It will be seen that Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya goes even beyond me, and calls that deity simply Ab<i>g</i>a, leaving out Ahi altogether, as understood. I was anxious to show the distinction between Ab<i>g</i>â Ahi<i>h</i> and Ahir Budhnya<i>h</i>, as the deities of the two successive verses, and I did not expect that any reader could possibly misinterpret my entry <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">c</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>With regard to hymns 91 and 92 of the seventh Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala, it is true, that in the index I did not mention that certain verses in which two deities are mentioned (91, 2;</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 4-7; 92, 2), must be considered as addressed not to Vâyu alone, but to Vâyu and Indra. It will be seen from Sâya<i>n</i>a's introduction to hymn 90, that he, too, wrongly limits the sentence of the Anukrama<i>n</i>ikâ, aindrya<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a yâ dvivaduktâ<i>h</i>, to the fifth and following verses of hymn 90, and that he never alludes to this proviso again in his introductory remarks to hymn 91 and 92, though, of course, he explains the verses, in which a dual occurs, as addressed to two deities, viz. Indra and Vâyu. The same omission, whether intentional or unintentional, occurs in Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya's commentary. The other commentary, however, assigns the verses of the three hymns rightly. The subject has evidently been one that excited attention in very early days, for in the Aitareya-brâhma<i>n</i>a, V, 20, we actually find that the word vâm which occurs in hymn 90, 1, and which might be taken as a dual, though Sâya<i>n</i>a explains it as a singular, is changed into te <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">a</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>In hymn VII, 104, rakshoha<i>n</i>au might certainly be added as an epithet of Indrâ-Somau, and Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya clearly takes it in that sense. The Anukrama<i>n</i>ikâ says: indrâsomâ pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âdhikaindrâsoma<i>m</i> râkshoghna<i>m</i> sâpâbhi<i>s</i>âpaprâyam.</p>  
 <p>In hymn VIII, 67, it has been supposed that the readings Samada and Sâmada instead of Sammada and Sâmmada were due to a misprint. This is not the case. That I was aware of the other spelling of this name, viz. Sammada and Sâmmada, I had shown in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (2nd ed.), p. 39, where I had translated the passage of the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-sûtras in which Matsya Sâmmada occurs, and had also called attention to the Â<i>s</i>valâyana-sûtras X, 7, and the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a XIII, 3, 1, 1,</p>

 <p><a name="page_lxx"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxx</font></a></p>  
 <p>where the same passage is found. I there spelt the name Sâmmada, because the majority of the MSS. were in favour of that spelling. In the edition of the Â<i>s</i>valâyana-sûtras, which has since been published by Râma Nârâya<i>n</i>a Vidyâra<i>n</i>ya, the name is spelt Sâmada. My own opinion is that Sâmmada is the right spelling, but that does not prove that Sâya<i>n</i>a thought so; and unless I deviated from the principles which I had adopted for a critical restoration of Sâya<i>n</i>a's text, I could not but write Sâmada in our passage. B 1 and B 4 omit sâmada, but both give samadâkhyasya; Ca. gives likewise samadâkhyasya, and A. semadâkhyasya. This, I believe, was meant by the writer for sammadâkhyasya, for in the passage from the Anukrama<i>n</i>î both A. and Ca. give sâmmado. I then consulted the commentary of Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, and there again the same MS. gave twice sâmmada, once sâmada, which is explained by samadâkhyamahâmînarâ<i>g</i>aputra<i>h</i>. A better MS. of Sha<i>d</i>guru<i>s</i>ishya, MS. Wilson 379 gives the readings sâmmado, sâmmada, and sammadâkhyasya. The other commentary gives distinctly sâmanda. [I have adopted sammada in the new edition.]</p>  
 <p>In IX, 68, Professor Aufrecht adopts what he considers the bold reading Vatsaprî; I prefer to be timid and allow Sâya<i>n</i>a his own reading Vatsaprĭ; see Sarvânukrama<i>n</i>î, ed. Macdonell, pp. 34, 146.</p>
