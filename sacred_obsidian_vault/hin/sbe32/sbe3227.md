 <p>1. Let us now proclaim for the robust <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:1">1</a> host, for the herald <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:2">2</a> of the powerful (Indra), their ancient greatness! O ye strong-voiced Maruts, you heroes, prove your powers on your march, as with a torch, as with a sword <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:3">3</a>!</p>  
 <p>2. Like parents bringing a dainty to <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:2:1">1</a> their own <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:2:2">2</a> son, the wild (Maruts) play playfully at the sacrifices. The Rudras reach the worshipper with their protection, strong in themselves, they do not fail the sacrificer.</p>  
 <p>3. For him to whom the immortal guardians have given fulness of wealth, and who is himself a giver of oblations, the Maruts, who gladden men with the milk (of rain), pour out, like friends, many clouds.</p>  
 <p>4. You who have stirred <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:1">1</a> up the clouds with might, your horses rushed <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:2">2</a> forth, self-guided. All beings who dwell in houses <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:3">3</a> are afraid of you, your march is brilliant with your spears thrust forth.</p>  
 <p>5. When they whose march is terrible have caused the rocks to tremble <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:1">1</a>, or when the manly Maruts have shaken the back of heaven, then every lord of the forest fears at your racing, each shrub flies out of your way <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:2">2</a>, whirling like chariot-wheels <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:3">3</a>.</p>  
 <p>6. You, O terrible Maruts, whose ranks are never broken, favourably <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:1">1</a> fulfil our prayer <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:2">2</a>! Wherever your gory-toothed <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:3">3</a> lightning bites <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:4">4</a>, it crunches <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:5">5</a> cattle, like a well-aimed bolt <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:6">6</a>.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. The Maruts whose gifts are firm, whose bounties are never ceasing, who do not: revile <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:7:1">1</a>, and who are highly praised at the sacrifices, they sing their song <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:7:2">2</a> for to drink the sweet juice: they know the first manly deeds of the hero (Indra).</p>  
 <p>8. The man whom you have guarded, O Maruts,—shield him with hundredfold strongholds from injury <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:8:1">1</a> and mischief,—the man whom you, O fearful, powerful singers, protect from reproach in the prosperity of his children.</p>  
 <p>9. On your chariots, O Maruts, there are all good things, strong weapons <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:1">1</a> are piled up clashing against each other. When you are on your journeys, you carry the rings <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:2">2</a> on your shoulders, and your axle turns the two wheels at once <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:3">3</a>.</p>  
 <p>10. In their manly arms there are many good things, on their chests golden chains <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:1">1</a>, flaring <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:2">2</a> ornaments, on their shoulders speckled deer-skins <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:3">3</a>, on their fellies sharp edges <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:4">4</a>; as birds spread their wings, they spread out splendours behind.</p>  
 <p>11. They, mighty by might, all-powerful powers <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:1">1</a>, visible from afar like the heavens <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:2">2</a> with the stars, sweet-toned, soft-tongued singers with their mouths <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:3">3</a>, the Maruts, united with Indra, shout all around.</p>  
 <p>12. This is your greatness <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:1">1</a> O well-born Maruts!—your bounty <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:3">3</a> extends far, as the sway <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:2">2</a> of Aditi <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:4">4</a>. Not even <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:5">5</a> Indra in his scorn <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:6">6</a> can injure that bounty, on whatever man you have bestowed it for his good deeds.</p>  
 <p>13. This is your kinship (with us), O Maruts, that you, immortals, in former years have often protected the singer <a href="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:13:1">1</a>. Having through this prayer granted a hearing to man, all these heroes together have become well-known by their valiant deeds.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. That we may long flourish, O Maruts, with your wealth, O ye racers, that our men may spread in the camp, therefore let me achieve the rite with these offerings.</p>  
 <p>15. May this praise, O Maruts, this song of Mândârya, the son of Mâna, the poet, ask you with food for offspring for ourselves! May we have an invigorating autumn, with quickening rain!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>This hymn is ascribed to Agastya, the reputed son of Mitrâvaru<i>n</i>au, and brother of Vasish<i>th</i>a. The metre in verses 1-13 is <i>G</i>agatî, in 14, 15 Trish<i>t</i>ubh. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:1:1">1</a>. Rabhasá, an adjective of rábhas, and this again from the root rabh, to rush upon a thing, â-rabh, to begin a thing. From this root rabh we have the Latin robur, in the general sense of strength, while in rabies the original meaning of impetuous motion has been more clearly preserved. The Greek λάβρος, too, as pointed out by Cowell, comes from this root. In the Vedic Sanskrit, derivatives from the root rabh convey the meaning both of quickness and of strength. Quickness in ancient languages frequently implies strength, and strength implies quickness, as we see, for instance, from the German snël, which, from meaning originally strong, comes to mean in modern German quick, and quick only. The German bald again, meaning soon, comes from the Gothic balths, the English bold. Thus we read:</p>  
 <p>I, 145, 3. <i>s</i>í<i>s</i>u<i>h</i> â´ adatta sám rábha<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>The child (Agni) acquired vigour.</p>  
 <p>Indra is called rabha<i>h</i>-dâ´<i>h</i>, giver of strength; and rabhasá, vigorous, is applied not only to the Maruts, who in V, 58, 5, are called rábhish<i>th</i>â<i>h</i>, the most vigorous, but also to Agni, II, 10, 4, and to Indra, III, 31, 12.</p>  
 <p>In the sense of rabid, furious, it occurs in</p>  
 <p>X, 95, 14. ádha enam v<i>rí</i>kâ<i>h</i> rabhasâ´sa<i>h</i> adyú<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May rabid wolves eat him!</p>  
 <p>In the next verse rabhasá, the epithet of the wolves, is replaced by á<i>s</i>iva, which means unlucky, uncanny.</p>  
 <p>In our hymn rabhasá occurs once more, and is applied there, in verse 10, to the a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>í or glittering ornaments of the Maruts. Here Sâya<i>n</i>a translates it by lovely, and it was most likely intended to convey the idea of lively or brilliant splendour, though it may mean also strong. See also IX, 96, 1.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:1:2">2</a>. Ketú, derived from an old root ki, in Sanskrit <i>k</i>i, to perceive, from which also <i>k</i>itra, conspicuous, ken-speckled, beautiful, means originally that by which a thing is perceived or known, whether a sign, or a flag, or a herald. It is the Gothic haidu, species. It then takes the more general sense of light and splendour. In our passage, herald seems to me the most appropriate rendering, though B. and R. prefer the sense of banner. The Maruts come before Indra, they announce the arrival of Indra, they are the first of his army.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:1:3">3</a>. The real difficulty of our verse lies in the two comparisons aidhâ´-iva and yudhâ´-iva. Neither of them occurs again in the Rig-veda. B. and R. explain aidhâ´ as an instrumental of aídh, flaming, or flame, and derive it from the root idh, to kindle, with the preposition â. Professor Bollensen in his excellent article Zur Herstellung des Veda (Orient and Occident, vol. iii, p. 473) says: 'The analysis of the text given in the Pada, viz. aidhâ´-iva and yudhâ´-iva, is contrary to all sense. The common predicate is tavishâ´<i>n</i>i kartana, exercise your power, you roarers, i. e. blow as if you meant to kindle the fire on the altar, show your power as if you went to battle. We ought therefore to read aidhé va and yudhé | va. Both are infinitives, aidh is nothing but the root idh + â, to kindle, to light.' Now this is certainly a very ingenious explanation, but it rests on a supposition which I cannot consider as proved, viz. that in the Veda, as in Pâli, the comparative particle iva may be changed, as shown in the preface to the first edition, to va. It must be admitted that the two short syllables of iva are occasionally counted in the Veda as one, but yudhé-iva, though it might become yudhá iva, would never in the Veda become yudhéva.</p>  
 <p>As yudhâ´ occurs frequently in the Veda, we may begin by admitting that the parallel form aidh must be explained in analogy to yudhâ´. Now yúdh is a verbal noun and means fighting. We have the accusative yúdham, I, 53, 7; the genitive yudhá<i>h</i>, VIII, 27, 17; the dative yudhé, I, 61, 13; the locative yudhí, I, 8, 3; the instrumental yudhâ´, I, 53, 7, &amp;c.; loc. plur. yut-sú, I, 91, 21. As long as yúdh</p>  
 <p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></a></p>  
 <p>retains the general predicative meaning of fighting, some of these cases may be called infinitives. But yúdh soon assumes not only the meaning of battle, battle-ground, but also of instrument of fighting, weapon. In another passage, X, 103, 2, yúdha<i>h</i> may be taken as a vocative plural, meaning fighters. Passages in which yúdh means clearly weapon, are, for instance,</p>  
 <p>V, 52, 6. â´ rukmaí<i>h</i> â´ yudhâ´ nára<i>h</i> <i>ri</i>shvâ´<i>h</i> <i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>î´<i>h</i> as<i>ri</i>kshata.</p>  
 <p>With their bright chains, with their weapon, the tall men have stretched forth the spears.</p>  
 <p>X, 55, 8. pîtvî´ sómasya divá<i>h</i> â´ v<i>ri</i>dhâná<i>h</i> <i>s</i>û´ra<i>h</i> ní<i>h</i> yudhâ´ adhamat dásyûn.</p>  
 <p>The hero, growing, after drinking the Soma, blew away from the sky the enemies with his weapon. See also X, 103, 4.</p>  
 <p>I therefore take yúdh in our passage also in the sense of weapon or sword, and, in accordance with this, I assign to aídh the meaning of torch. Whether aídh comes from idh with the preposition â, which, after all, would only give edh, or whether we have in the Sanskrit aídh the same peculiar strengthening which this very root shows in Greek and Latin <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">a</font></a>, would be difficult to decide. The torch of the Maruts is the lightning, the weapon the thunderbolt, and by both they manifest their strength; ferro et igne, as Ludwig remarks.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilson</span>: We proclaim eagerly, Maruts, your ancient greatness, for (the sake of inducing) your prompt appearance, as the indication of (the approach of) the showerer (of benefits). Loud-roaring and mighty Maruts, you exert your vigorous energies for the advance (to the sacrifice), as if it was to battle.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:2:1">1</a>. That úpa can be construed with the accusative is clear from many passages:</p>  
 <p>III, 35, 2. úpa imám ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ám â´ vahâta<i>h</i> índram.</p>  
 <p>Bring Indra to this sacrifice!</p>  
 <p>I, 25, 4. váya<i>h</i> ná vasatî´<i>h</i> úpa.</p>  
 <p>As birds (fly) to their nests.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></a></p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:2:2">2</a>. Nítya, from ni + tya <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">a</font></a>, means originally what is inside, internus, then what is one's own; and is opposed to nísh<i>t</i>ya, from nis + tya, what is outside, strange, or hostile. Nítya has been well compared with ni<i>g</i>á, literally eingeboren, then, like nítya, one's own. What is inside, or in a thing or place, is its own, is peculiar to it, does not move or change, and hence the secondary meanings of nítya, one's own, unchanging, eternal. Thus we find nítya used in the sense of internal or domestic:</p>  
 <p>I, 73, 4. tám tvâ nára<i>h</i> dáme â´ nítyam iddhám ágne sá<i>k</i>anta kshitíshu dhruvâ´su.</p>  
 <p>Our men worshipped thee, O Agni, lighted within the house in safe places.</p>  
 <p>This I believe to be a more appropriate rendering than if we take nítya in the sense of always, continuously lighted, or, as some propose, in the sense of eternal, everlasting.</p>  
 <p>VII, 1, 2. dakshâ´yya<i>h</i> yá<i>h</i> dáme â´sa nítya<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Agni who is to be pleased within the house, i. e. as belonging to the house, and, in that sense, who is to be pleased always. Cf. I, 140, 7; 141, 2; X, 12, 2, and III, 25, 5, where nítya<i>h</i>, however, may have been intended as an adjective belonging to the vocative sûno.</p>  
 <p>Most frequently nítya occurs with sûnú, I, 66, 1; 185, 2; tánaya, III, 15, 2; X, 39, 14; toká, II, 2, 11; âpí, VII, 88, 6; páti, I, 71, 1, and has always the meaning of one's own, very much like the later Sanskrit ni<i>g</i>a, which never occurs in the Rig-veda, though it makes its appearance in the Âtharva<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>Nísh<i>t</i>ya, extraneus, occurs three times in the Rig-veda:</p>  
 <p>VI, 75, 19. yá<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> svá<i>h</i> ára<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> yá<i>h</i> <i>k</i>a nísh<i>t</i>ya<i>h</i> <i>g</i>íghâ<i>m</i>sati.</p>  
 <p>Whoever wishes to hurt us, our own friend or a stranger from without.</p>  
 <p>X, 133, 5. yá<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> indra abhi-dâ´sati sá-nâbhi<i>h</i> yá<i>h</i> <i>k</i>a nísh<i>t</i>ya<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>He who infests us, O Indra, whether a relative or a stranger.</p>  
 <p>VIII, I, 13. mâ´ bhûma nísh<i>t</i>yâ<i>h</i>-iva índra tvád ára<i>n</i>â<i>h</i>-iva.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>Let us not be like outsiders, O Indra, not like strangers to thee.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilson</span>: Ever accepting the sweet (libation), as (they would) a son, they sport playfully at sacrifices, demolishing (all intruders).</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Wie einen nicht absterbenden Sohn das Madhu bringend.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:4:1">1</a>. Ávyata, a Vedic second aorist of vî (a<i>g</i>), to stir up, to excite. From it pravaya<i>n</i>a, a goad, pra-vetar, a driver. The Greek οἶ-σ-τρος, gad-fly, has been referred to the same root. See Fick, Wörterbuch, p. 170.</p>  
 <p>Roth (Wenzel, Instrumental, p. 54) translates: 'While you quickly throw yourselves into the mists;' from a verb vyâ.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:4:2">2</a>. Adhra<i>g</i>an, from dhra<i>g</i>, a root which, by metathesis of aspiration, would assume the form of dra<i>gh</i> or dragh. In Greek, the final medial aspirate being hardened, reacts on the initial media, and changes it to t, as bâhu becomes πῆχυς, budh πυθ, bandh, πενθ. This would give us τρεχ, the Greek root for running, Goth. thrag-jan.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:4:3">3</a>. Harmyá is used here as an adjective of bhúvana, and can only mean living in houses. It does not, however, occur again in the same sense, though it occurs several times as a substantive, meaning house. Its original meaning is fire-pit, then hearth, then house, a transition of meaning analogous to that of aedes. Most of the ancient nations begin their kitchen with a fire-pit. ‘They dig a hole in the ground, take a piece of the animal's raw hide, and press it down with their hands close to the sides of the hole, which thus becomes a sort of pot or basin. This they fill with water, and they make a number of stones red-hot in a fire close by. The meat is put into the water, and the stones dropped in till the meat is boiled. Catlin describes the process as awkward and tedious, and says that since the Assinaboins had learnt from the Mandans to make pottery, and had been supplied with vessels by the traders, they had entirely done away the custom, “excepting at public festivals; where they seem, like all others of the human family, to take pleasure in cherishing and perpetuating</p>  
 <p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></a></p>  
 <p>their ancient customs <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">a</font></a>.”’ This pit was called harmyá <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">b</font></a> or gharmá, which is the Latin formus. Thus we read:</p>  
 <p>VII, 56, 16. té harmye-sthâ´<i>h</i> <i>s</i>í<i>s</i>ava<i>h</i> ná <i>s</i>ubhrâ´<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>The Maruts bright like boys standing by the hearth.</p>  
 <p>From meaning fire-pit, or hearth, harmyá afterwards takes the more general sense of house:</p>  
 <p>VII, 55, 6. téshâm sám hanma<i>h</i> akshâ´<i>n</i>i yáthâ idám harmyám táthâ.</p>  
 <p>We shut their eyes as we shut this house (possibly, this oven).</p>  
 <p>VII, 76, 2. pratî<i>k</i>î´ â´ agât ádhi harmyébhya<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>The dawn comes near, over the house-tops.</p>  
 <p>X, 46, 3. <i>g</i>âtá<i>h</i> â´ harmyéshu.</p>  
 <p>Agni, born in the houses.</p>  
 <p>X, 73, 10. manyó<i>h</i> iyâya harmyéshu tasthau.</p>  
 <p>He came from Manyu, he remained in the houses.</p>  
 <p>In some of these passages harmyá might be taken in the sense of householder; but as harmyá in VII, 55, 6, has clearly the meaning of a building, it seems better not to assign to it unnecessarily any new significations.</p>  
 <p>If harmya or *harma meant originally a fire-pit, then a hearth, a house, we see the close connection between harma and gharma, harmya and gharmya. Thus by the side of harmyesh<i>th</i>a we find gharmyesh<i>th</i>a (RV. X, 106, 5). We find gharma meaning, not only heat in general, but fire-pit, hearth; and we find the same word used for what we should call the pit, a place of torture and punishment from which the gods save their worshippers, or into which they throw the evil-doers.</p>  
 <p>V, 32, 5. yûyutsantam támasi harmyé dhâ´<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>When thou, Indra, hadst placed <i>S</i>ush<i>n</i>a, who was anxious to fight, in the darkness of the pit.</p>  
 <p>In the next verse we find</p>  
 <p>asûryé támasi, in the ghastly darkness.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 5, 23. yuvám ká<i>n</i>vâya nâsatyâ ápi-riptâya harmyé <i>s</i>á<i>s</i>vat ûtî´<i>h</i> da<i>s</i>asyatha<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>You, Nâsatyas, always grant your aid to Ka<i>n</i>va when thrown into the pit.</p>  
 <p>This fiery pit into which Atri is thrown, and whence he, too, was saved by the A<i>s</i>vins, is likewise called gharmá, I, 112, 7; 119, 6; VIII, 73, 3; X, 80, 3.</p>  
 <p>Lastly we find:</p>  
 <p>X, 114, 10. yadâ´ yamá<i>h</i> bhávati harmyé hitá<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>When Yama is seated in the house, or in the nether world.</p>  
 <p>When the Pitars, too, the spirits of the departed, the Manes, are called gharma-sád, this is probably intended to mean, dwelling on the hearth (X, 15, 9 and 10), and not dwelling in the abode of Yama.</p>  
 <p>Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 234: 'Die ihr die Luft erfüllt mit eurer Kraft, hervorstürmt ihr selbst-gelenkten Laufes.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:5:1">1</a>. Nad certainly means to sound, and the causative might be translated by 'to make cry or shriek.' If we took párvata in the sense of cloud, we might translate, 'When you make the clouds roar;' if we took párvata for mountain, we might, with Professor Wilson, render the passage by 'When your brilliant coursers make the mountains echo.' But nad, like other roots which afterwards take the meaning of sounding, means originally to vibrate, to shake; and if we compare analogous passages where nad occurs, we shall see that in our verse, too, the Vedic poet undoubtedly meant nad to be taken in that sense:</p>  
 <p>VIII, 20, 5. á<i>k</i>yutâ <i>k</i>it va<i>h</i> á<i>g</i>man â´ nâ´nadati párvatâsa<i>h</i> vánaspáti<i>h</i>, bhû´mi<i>h</i> yâ´meshu re<i>g</i>ate.</p>  
 <p>At your racing even things that are immovable vibrate, the rocks, the lord of the forest; the earth quivers on your ways. (See I, 37, 7, note I.) Grassmann here translates nadáyanta by erschüttern, but in VIII, 20, 5 by erdröhnt.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:5:2">2</a>. See I, 37, 7, note 1.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:5:3">3</a>. Rathiyántî-iva does not occur again. Sâya<i>n</i>a explains it, like a woman who wishes for a chariot, or who rides in a chariot. I join it with óshadhi, and take it in the sense of upamânâd â<i>k</i>âre (Pâ<i>n</i>. III, 1, 10), i. e. to behave like or to be like a chariot, whether the comparison is meant to express simply the quickness of chariots or the whirling of their wheels. The Pada has rathiyántî, whereas the more regular form is that of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, rathîyántî. Cf. Prâti<i>s</i>âkhya, 587.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:6:1">1</a>. Su-<i>k</i>etúnâ, the instrumental of su-<i>k</i>etú, kindness, good-mindedness, favour. This word occurs in the instrumental only, and always refers to the kindness of the gods; not, like sumatí, to the kindness of the worshipper also:</p>  
 <p>I, 79, 9. â´ na<i>h</i> agne su-<i>k</i>etúnâ rayím vi<i>s</i>vâ´yu-poshasam, mâr<i>d</i>îkám dhehi <i>g</i>îváse.</p>  
 <p>Give us, O Agni, through thy favour wealth which supports our whole life, give us grace to live.</p>  
 <p>I, 127, 11. sá<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> nédish<i>th</i>am dádri<i>s</i>âna<i>h</i> â´ bhara ágne devébhi<i>h</i> sá-<i>k</i>anâ<i>h</i> su-<i>k</i>etúnâ mahá<i>h</i> râyá<i>h</i> su-<i>k</i>etûnâ.</p>  
 <p>Thou, O Agni, seen close to us, bring to us, in union with the gods, by thy favour, great riches, by thy favour!</p>  
 <p>I, 159, 5. asmábhyam dyâvâp<i>ri</i>thivî (íti) su-<i>k</i>etúnâ rayím dhattam vásu-mantam <i>s</i>ata-gvínam.</p>  
 <p>Give to us, O Dyâvâp<i>ri</i>thivî, by your favour, wealth, consisting of treasures and many flocks.</p>  
 <p>V, 51, 11. svastí dyâvâp<i>ri</i>thivî (íti) su-<i>k</i>etúnâ.</p>  
 <p>Give us, O Dyâvâp<i>ri</i>thivî, happiness through your favour!</p>  
 <p>V, 64, 2. tâ´ bâhávâ su-<i>k</i>etúnâ prá yantam asmai ár<i>k</i>ate.</p>  
 <p>Stretch out your arms with kindness to this worshipper! In one passage of the ninth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala (IX, 65, 30) we meet with su-<i>k</i>etúnam, as an accusative, referring to Soma, the gracious, and this would pre-suppose a substantive <i>k</i>etúna, which, however, does not exist.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:6:2">2</a>. Sumatí has, no doubt, in most passages in the Rig-veda, the meaning of favour, the favour of the gods. 'Let us obtain your favour, let us be in your favour,' are familiar expressions of the Vedic poets. But there are also numerous passages where that meaning is inapplicable, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></a></p>  
 <p>where, as in our passage, we must translate sumatí by prayer or desire.</p>  
 <p>In the following passages sumatí is clearly used in its original sense of favour, blessing, or even gift:</p>  
 <p>I, 73, 6 (7). su-matím bhíkshamâ<i>n</i>â<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Begging for thy favour.</p>  
 <p>I, 171, 1. su-ukténa bhikshe su-matím turâ´<i>n</i>âm.</p>  
 <p>With a hymn I beg for the favour of the quick Maruts.</p>  
 <p>I, 114, 3. a<i>s</i>yâ´ma te su-matím.</p>  
 <p>May we obtain thy favour! Cf. I, 114, 9:</p>  
 <p>I, 114, 4. su-matím ít vayám asya â´ v<i>ri</i><i>n</i>îmahe.</p>  
 <p>We choose his favour. Cf. III, 33, 1.</p>  
 <p>I, 117, 23. sádâ kavî (íti) su-matím â´ <i>k</i>ake vâm.</p>  
 <p>I always desire your favour, O ye wise A<i>s</i>vins.</p>  
 <p>I, 156, 3. mahá<i>h</i> te vish<i>n</i>o (íti) su-matím bha<i>g</i>âmahe.</p>  
 <p>May we, O Vish<i>n</i>u, enjoy the favour of thee, the mighty!</p>  
 <p>Bhiksh, to beg, used above, is an old desiderative form of bha<i>g</i>, and means to wish to enjoy.</p>  
 <p>III, 4, 1. su-matím râsi vásva<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Thou grantest the favour of wealth.</p>  
 <p>VII, 39, 1. ûrdhvá<i>h</i> agní<i>h</i> su-matím vásva<i>h</i> a<i>s</i>ret.</p>  
 <p>The lighted fire went up for the favour of wealth. Cf. VII, 60, 11; IX, 97, 26.</p>  
 <p>III, 57, 6. váso (íti) râ´sva su-matím vi<i>s</i>vá-<i>g</i>anyâm.</p>  
 <p>Grant us, O Vasu, thy favour, which is glorious among men!</p>  
 <p>VII, 100, 2. tvâm vish<i>n</i>o (íti) su-matím vi<i>s</i>vá-<i>g</i>anyâm—dâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Mayest thou, Vish<i>n</i>u, give thy favour, which is glorious among men!</p>  
 <p>X, 11, 7. yá<i>h</i> te agne su-matím márta<i>h</i> ákshat.</p>  
 <p>The mortal who obtained thy favour, O Agni.</p>  
 <p>II, 34, 15. arvâ´<i>k</i>î sâ´ maruta<i>h</i> yâ´ va<i>h</i> ûtí<i>h</i> ó (íti) sú vâ<i>s</i>râ´-iva su-matí<i>h</i> <i>g</i>igâtu.</p>  
 <p>Your help, O Maruts, which is to usward, your favour may it come near, like a cow!</p>  
 <p>VIII, 22, 4. asmâ´n á<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a su-matí<i>h</i> vâm <i>s</i>ubha<i>h</i> patî (íti) â dhenú<i>h</i>-iva dhâvatu.</p>  
 <p>May your favour, O A<i>s</i>vins, hasten towards us, like a cow!</p>  
 <p>But this meaning is by no means the invariable meaning of sumatí, and it will easily be seen that, in the following</p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>passages, the word must be translated by prayer. Thus when Sarasvatî is called (I, 3, 11) <i>k</i>étantî su-matînâ´m, this can only mean she who knows of the prayers, as before she is called <i>k</i>odayitrî´ sûn<i>rí</i>tânâm, she who excites songs of praise:</p>  
 <p>I, 151, 7. á<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a gíra<i>h</i> su-matím gantam asma-yû´ (íti).</p>  
 <p>Come towards the songs, towards the prayer, you who are longing for us. Cf. X, 20, 10.</p>  
 <p>II, 43, 3. tûsh<i>n</i>î´m â´sîna<i>h</i> su-matím <i>k</i>ikiddhi na<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Sitting quiet, listen, O <i>S</i>akuni (bird), to our prayer!</p>  
 <p>V, 1, 10. â´ bhándish<i>th</i>asya su-matím <i>k</i>ikiddhi.</p>  
 <p>Take notice of the prayer of thy best praiser! Cf. V, 33, I.</p>  
 <p>VII, 18, 4. â´ na<i>h</i> índra<i>h</i> su-matím gantu á<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a.</p>  
 <p>May Indra come to our prayer!</p>  
 <p>VII, 31, 10. prá-<i>k</i>etase prá su-matím k<i>ri</i><i>n</i>udhvam.</p>  
 <p>Make a prayer for the wise god!</p>  
 <p>IX, 96, 2. su-matím yâti á<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a.</p>  
 <p>He (Soma) goes near to the prayer.</p>  
 <p>X, 148, 3. rishî<i>n</i>âm vípra<i>h</i> su-matím <i>k</i>akâná<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Thou, the wise, desiring the prayer of the <i>Ri</i>shis.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 22, 6. tâ´ vâm adyá sumatí-bhi<i>h</i> <i>s</i>ubha<i>h</i> patî (íti) á<i>s</i>vinâ prá stuvîmahi.</p>  
 <p>Let us praise to-day the glorious A<i>s</i>vins with our prayers.</p>  
 <p>IX, 74, 1. tám îmahe su-matî´.</p>  
 <p>We implore him with prayer.</p>  
 <p>In our passage the verb pipartana, fill or fulfil, indicates in what sense sumatí ought to be taken. Su-matím pipartana is no more than kâ´mam pipartana, fulfil our desire! See VII, 62, 3. â´ na<i>h</i> kâ´mam pûpurantu; I, 158, 2. kâmapré<i>n</i>a-iva mánasâ. On sumná, see Burnouf, Études, p. 91, and Aufrecht, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 274.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:6:3">3</a>. Krívi<i>h</i>-datî has been a crux to ancient and modern interpreters. It is mentioned as a difficult word in the Nigha<i>n</i><i>t</i>u, and all that Yâska has to say is that it means possessed of cutting teeth (Nir. VI, 30. krivirdatî vikartanadantî). Professor Roth, in his note to this passage, says that krivi can never have the meaning of well, which is ascribed to it in the Nigha<i>n</i><i>t</i>u III, 23, but seems rather to mean an animal, perhaps the wild boar, κάπρος, with metathesis of v and r. He translates our passage: 'Where</p>  
 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p>your lightning with boar-teeth tears.' In his Dictionary, however, he only says, 'krivis, perhaps the name of an animal, and dant, tooth.' Sâya<i>n</i>a contents himself with explaining krívirdatî by vikshepa<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>îladantî, having teeth that scatter about.</p>  
 <p>My own translation is founded on the supposition that krívis, the first portion of krívirdatî, has nothing to do with krivi, but is a dialectic variety of kravís, raw flesh, the Greek κρέας, Latin caro, cruor. It means what is raw, bloody, or gory. From it the adjective krûra, horrible, cruentus (Curtius, Grundzüge, p. 142; Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 235). A name of the goddess Durgâ in later Sanskrit is krûradantî, and with a similar conception the lightning, I believe, is here called krívirdatî, with gory teeth.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:6:4">4</a>. It should be observed that in rádati the simile of the teeth of the lightning is carried on. For rádati may be supposed to have had in the Veda, too, the original meaning of râdere and rôdere, to scratch, to gnaw. Rada and radana in the later Sanskrit mean tooth. It is curious, however, that there is no other passage in the Rig-veda where rad clearly means to bite. It means to cut, in</p>  
 <p>I, 61, 12. gó<i>h</i> ná párva ví rada tira<i>s</i><i>k</i>â´.</p>  
 <p>Cut his joint through, as the joint of an ox.</p>  
 <p>But in most passages where rad occurs in the Veda, it has the meaning of giving. It is not the same which we have in the Zend râd, to give, and which Justi rightly identifies with the root râdh. But rad, to divide, may, like the German theilen in zutheilen, have taken the meaning of giving. Greek δαίω means to divide, but yields δαίς, portion, meal, just as Sanskrit day, to divide, yields dâyas, share, i. e. inheritance.</p>  
 <p>This meaning is evident in the following passages:</p>  
 <p>VII, 79, 4. tâ´vat usha<i>h</i> râ´dha<i>h</i> asmábhyam râsva yâ´vat stot<i>rí</i>-bhya<i>h</i> árada<i>h</i> g<i>ri</i><i>n</i>ânâ´.</p>  
 <p>Grant us, Ushas, so much wealth as thou hast given to the singers, when praised.</p>  
 <p>I, 116, 7. kakshî´vate aradatam púram-dhim.</p>  
 <p>You gave wisdom to Kakshîvat.</p>  
 <p>I, 169, 8. ráda marút-bhi<i>h</i> <i>s</i>urúdha<i>h</i> gó-agrâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>Give to the Maruts gifts, rich in cattle.</p>  
 <p>VII, 62, 3. ví na<i>h</i> sahásram <i>s</i>urúdha<i>h</i> radantu.</p>  
 <p>May they (the gods) give to us a thousand gifts!</p>  
 <p>I, 117, 11. vâ´<i>g</i>am víprâya—rádantâ.</p>  
 <p>Giving spoil to the sage!</p>  
 <p>VI, 61, 6. ráda pûshâ´-iva na<i>h</i> saním.</p>  
 <p>Give us, Sarasvatî, wealth, like Pûshan!</p>  
 <p>IX, 93, 4. rada índo (íti) rayím.</p>  
 <p>Give us, O Indra, wealth!</p>  
 <p>VII, 32, 18. rada-vaso (íti).</p>  
 <p>Indra, thou who givest wealth!</p>  
 <p>In many passages, however, this verb rad is connected with words meaning way or path, and it then becomes a question whether it simply means to grant a way, or to cut a way open for some one. In Zend, too, the same idiom occurs, and Professor Justi explains it by 'prepare a way.' I subjoin the principal passages:</p>  
 <p>VI, 30, 3. yát âbhya<i>h</i> árada<i>h</i> gâtúm indra.</p>  
 <p>That thou hast cut a way for them (the rivers). Cf. VII, 74, 4.</p>  
 <p>IV, 19, 2. prá vartanî´<i>h</i> arada<i>h</i> vi<i>s</i>vá-dhenâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Thou (Indra) hast cut open the paths for all the cows.</p>  
 <p>X, 75, 2. prá te aradat váru<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> yâ´tave pathá<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Varu<i>n</i>a cut the paths for thee to go.</p>  
 <p>VII, 87, 1. rádat pathá<i>h</i> váru<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> sû´ryâya.</p>  
 <p>Varu<i>n</i>a cut paths for Sûrya.</p>  
 <p>V, 80, 3. pathá<i>h</i> rádantî suvitâ´ya devî´.</p>  
 <p>She, the dawn, cutting open the paths for welfare.</p>  
 <p>VII, 60, 4. yásmai âdityâ´<i>h</i> ádhvana<i>h</i> rádanti.</p>  
 <p>For whom the Âdityas cut roads.</p>  
 <p>II, 30, 2. pathá<i>h</i> rádantî<i>h</i>—dhûnaya<i>h</i> yanti ártham.</p>  
 <p>Cutting their paths, the rivers go to their goal.</p>  
 <p>This last verse seems to show that the cutting open of a road is really the idea expressed by rad in all these passages. And thus we find the rivers themselves saying that Indra cut them out or delivered them:</p>  
 <p>III, 33, 6. índra<i>h</i> asmâ´n aradat vá<i>g</i>ra-bâhu<i>h</i>. Cf. X, 89, 7.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:6:5">5</a>. Ri<i>n</i>â´ti, like the preceding expressions krívirdatî and rádati, is not chosen at random, for though it has the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p>general meaning of crushing or destroying, it is used by the Vedic poets with special reference to the chewing or crunching by means of the teeth. For instance,</p>  
 <p>I, 148, 4. purû´<i>n</i>i dasmá<i>h</i> ní ri<i>n</i>âti <i>g</i>ámbhai<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Agni crunches many things with his jaws.</p>  
 <p>I, 127, 4. sthirâ´ <i>k</i>it ánnâ ní ri<i>n</i>âti ó<i>g</i>asâ.</p>  
 <p>Even tough morsels he (Agni) crunches fiercely. In a more general sense we find it used,</p>  
 <p>V, 41, 10. <i>s</i>o<i>k</i>í<i>h</i>-ke<i>s</i>a<i>h</i> ní ri<i>n</i>âti vánâ.</p>  
 <p>Agni with flaming hair swallows or destroys the forests.</p>  
 <p>IV, 19, 3. áhim vá<i>g</i>re<i>n</i>a ví ri<i>n</i>â<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Thou destroyedst Ahi with the thunderbolt.</p>  
 <p>X, 120, 1. sadyá<i>h</i> <i>g</i>a<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âná<i>h</i> ní ri<i>n</i>âti <i>s</i>átrûn.</p>  
 <p>As soon as born he destroys his enemies.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:6:6">6</a>. Súdhitâ-iva barhá<i>n</i>â. I think the explanation of this phrase given by Sâya<i>n</i>a may be retained. He explains súdhitâ by suhitâ, i. e. sush<i>th</i>u preritâ, well thrown, well levelled, and barhá<i>n</i>â by hatis, tatsâdhanâ hetir vâ, a blow or its instrument, a weapon. Professor Roth takes barhá<i>n</i>â as an instrumental, used adverbially, in the sense of powerfully, but he does not explain in what sense súdhitâ-iva ought then to be taken. We cannot well refer it to didyút, lightning, on account of the iva, which requires something that can form a simile of the lightning. Nor is su-dhitâ ever used as a substantive so as to take the place of svádhitîva. Sú-dhita has apparently many meanings, but they all centre in one common conception. Sú-dhita means well placed, of a thing which is at rest, well arranged, well ordered, secure; or it means well sent, well thrown, of a thing which has been in motion. Applied to human beings, it means well disposed or kind.</p>  
 <p>III, 23, 1. ní<i>h</i>-mathita<i>h</i> sú-dhita<i>h</i> â´ sadhá-sthe.</p>  
 <p>Agni produced by rubbing, and well placed in his abode.</p>  
 <p>VII, 42, 4. sú-prîta<i>h</i> agní<i>h</i> sú-dhita<i>h</i> dáme â´.</p>  
 <p>Agni, who is cherished and well placed in the house.</p>  
 <p>III, 29, 2. ará<i>n</i>yo<i>h</i> ní-hita<i>h</i> gâtá-vedâ<i>h</i> gárbha<i>h</i>-iva sú-dhita<i>h</i> garbhí<i>n</i>îshu.</p>  
 <p>Agni placed in the two fire-sticks, well placed like an embryo in the mothers. Cf. X, 27, 16.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>VIII, 60, 4. abhí práyâ<i>m</i>si sú-dhitâ â´ vaso (íti) gahi.</p>  
 <p>Come, O Vasu, to these well-placed offerings. Cf. I, 135, 4; VI, 15, 15; X, 53, 2.</p>  
 <p>X, 70, 8. sû-dhitâ havî´<i>m</i>shi.</p>  
 <p>The well-placed offerings.</p>  
 <p>IV, 2, 10 (adhvarám). VII, 7, 3 (barhí<i>h</i>).</p>  
 <p>As applied to â´yus, life, súdhita may be translated by well established, safe:</p>  
 <p>II, 27, 10. a<i>s</i>yâ´ma â´yû<i>m</i>shi sú-dhitâni pû´rvâ.</p>  
 <p>May we obtain the happy long lives of our forefathers.</p>  
 <p>IV, 50, 8. sá<i>h</i> ít ksheti sú-dhita<i>h</i> ókasi své.</p>  
 <p>That man dwells secure in his own house.</p>  
 <p>Applied to a missile weapon, súdhita may mean well placed, as it were, well shouldered, well held, before it is thrown; or well levelled, well aimed, when it is thrown:</p>  
 <p>I, 167, 3. mimyáksha yéshu sú-dhitâ—<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>í<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>To whom the well held spear sticks fast.</p>  
 <p>VI, 33, 3. tvám tâ´n indra ubháyân amítrân dâ´sâ v<i>ri</i>trâ´<i>n</i>i â´ryâ <i>k</i>a <i>s</i>ûra, vádhî<i>h</i> vánâ-iva sú-dhitebhi<i>h</i> átkai<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Thou, Indra, O hero, struckest both enemies, the barbarous and the Aryan fiends, like forests with well-aimed weapons.</p>  
 <p>Applied to a poem, súdhita means well arranged or perfect:</p>  
 <p>I, 140, 11. idám agne sú-dhitam dú<i>h</i>-dhitât ádhi priyâ´t û<i>m</i> (íti) <i>k</i>it mánmana<i>h</i> préya<i>h</i> astu te.</p>  
 <p>May this perfect prayer be more agreeable to thee than an imperfect one, though thou likest it.</p>  
 <p>VII, 32, 13. mántram ákharvam sú-dhitam. A poem, not mean, well contrived.</p>  
 <p>As applied to men, súdhita means very much the same as hitá, well disposed, kind:</p>  
 <p>IV, 6, 7. ádha mitrá<i>h</i> ná sú-dhita<i>h</i> pâvaká<i>h</i> agní<i>h</i> dîdâya mâ´nushîshu vikshú.</p>  
 <p>Then, like a kind friend, Agni shone among the children of man.</p>  
 <p>V, 3, 2. mitrám sú-dhitam.</p>  
 <p>VI, 15, 2. mitrám ná yám sú-dhitam.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 23, 8. mitrám ná <i>g</i>áne sú-dhitam <i>ri</i>tá-vani.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>X, 115, 7. mitrâ´sa<i>h</i> ná yé sú-dhitâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>At last sú-dhita, without reference to human beings, takes the general sense of kind, good:</p>  
 <p>III, 11, 8. pári ví<i>s</i>vâni sú-dhitâ agné<i>h</i> a<i>s</i>yâma mánma-bhi<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May we obtain through our prayers all the goods of Agni.</p>  
 <p>Here, however, práyâ<i>m</i>si may have to be supplied, and in that case this passage, too, should be classed with those mentioned above, VIII, 60, 4, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If then we consider that súdhita, as applied to weapons, means well held or well aimed, we can hardly doubt that barhá<i>n</i>â is here, as Sâya<i>n</i>a says, some kind of weapon. I should derive it from barhayati, to crush, which we have, for instance,</p>  
 <p>I, 133, 5. pi<i>s</i>áṅga-bh<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>im ambhri<i>n</i>ám pisâ´<i>k</i>im indra sám m<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a, sárvam ráksha<i>h</i> ní barhaya.</p>  
 <p>Pound together the fearful Pi<i>s</i>â<i>k</i>i with his fiery weapons, strike down every Rakshas.</p>  
 <p>II, 23, 8. b<i>rí</i>haspate deva-nída<i>h</i> ní barhaya.</p>  
 <p>B<i>ri</i>haspati strike down the scoffers of the gods. Cf. VI, 61, 3.</p>  
 <p>Barhá<i>n</i>â would therefore mean a weapon intended to crush an enemy, a block of stone, it may be, or a heavy club, and in that sense barhá<i>n</i>â occurs at least once more:</p>  
 <p>VIII, 63, 7. yát pâ´<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-<i>g</i>anyayâ vi<i>s</i>â´ índre ghóshâ<i>h</i> ás<i>ri</i>kshata, ást<i>ri</i><i>n</i>ât barhá<i>n</i>â vipá<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>When shouts have been sent up to Indra by the people of the five clans, then the club scattered the spears; or, then he scattered the spears with his club.</p>  
 <p>In other passages Professor Roth is no doubt right when he assigns to barhá<i>n</i>â an adverbial meaning, but I do not think that this meaning would be appropriate in our verse. Grassmann also translates, 'ein wohlgezielter Pfeil.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:7:1">1</a>. Alât<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â´sa<i>h</i>, a word which occurs but once more, and which had evidently become unintelligible even at the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>time of Yâska. He (Nir. VI, 2) explains it by alamâtardano megha<i>h</i>, the cloud which opens easily. This, at least, is the translation given by Professor Roth, though not without hesitation. Alamâtardana<i>h</i>, as a compound, is explained by the commentator as âtardanaparyâpta<i>h</i>, alam âtardayitum udakam, i. e. capable of letting off the water. But Devarâ<i>g</i>aya<i>g</i>van explains it differently. He says: alam paryâptam âtardanam hi<i>m</i>sâ yasya, bahûdakatvâ<i>k</i><i>kh</i>abalo megho vi<i>s</i>eshyate, i. e. whose injuring is great; the dark cloud is so called because it contains much water. Sâya<i>n</i>a. too, attempts several explanations. In III, 30, 10, he seems to derive it from t<i>ri</i>h, to kill, not, like Yâska, from t<i>ri</i>d, and he explains its meaning as the cloud which is exceedingly hurt by reason of its holding so much water. In our passage he explains it either as anât<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a, free from injury, or good hurters of enemies, or good givers of rewards.</p>  
 <p>From all this I am afraid we gain nothing. Let us now see what modern commentators have proposed in order to discover an appropriate meaning in this word. Professor Roth suggests that the word may be derived from râ, to give, and the suffix t<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a, and the negative particle, thus meaning, one who does not give or yield anything. But, if so, how is this adjective applicable to the Maruts, who in this very verse are praised for their generosity? Langlois in our passage translates, 'heureux de nos louanges;' in III, 30, 10, qui laissait flétrir les plantes.' Wilson in our passage translates, 'devoid of malevolence;' but in III, 30, 10, 'heavy.'</p>  
 <p>I do not pretend to solve all these difficulties, but I may say this in defence of my own explanation that it fulfils the condition of being applicable both to the Maruts and to the demon Bala. The suffix t<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a is certainly irregular, and I should much prefer to write alât<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a, for in that case we might derive lâtrin from lâtra, and to this lâtra, i. e. râtra, I. should ascribe the sense of barking. The root rai or râ means to bark, and has been connected by Professor Aufrecht with Latin rire, inrire, and possibly inritare <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">a</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="green">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p>thus showing a transition of meaning from barking, to provoking or attacking. The same root râ explains also the Latin lâtrare, to bark, allatrare, to assail; and, whatever ancient etymologists may say to the contrary, the Latin latro, an assailer. The old derivation 'latrones eos antiqui dicebant, qui conducti militabant, ἀπὸ τῆς λατρείας,' seems to me one of those etymologies in which the scholars of Rome, who had learnt a little Greek, delighted as much as scholars who know a little Sanskrit delight in finding some plausible derivation for any Greek or Latin word in Sanskrit. I know that Curtius (Grundzüge, p. 326) and Corssen (Kritische Nachträge, p. 239) take a different view; but a foreign word, derived from λάτρον, pay, hire, would never have proved so fertile as latro has been in Latin.</p>  
 <p>If then we could write alâtri<i>n</i>â´sa<i>h</i>, we should have an appropriate epithet of the Maruts, in the sense of not assailing or not reviling, in fact, free from malevolence, as Wilson translated the word, or rather Sâya<i>n</i>a's explanation of it, âtardanarahita. What gives me some confidence in this explanation is this, that it is equally applicable to the other passage where alât<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a occurs, III, 30, 10:</p>  
 <p>alât<i>ri</i><i>n</i>á<i>h</i> valá<i>h</i> indra vra<i>g</i>á<i>h</i> gó<i>h</i> purâ´ hánto<i>h</i> bháyamâna<i>h</i> ví âra.</p>  
 <p>Without barking did Vala, the keeper of the cow, full of tear, open, before thou struckest him.</p>  
 <p>If it should be objected that vra<i>g</i>á means always stable, and is not used again in the sense of keeper, one might reply that vra<i>g</i>á<i>h</i>, in the nom. sing., occurs in this one single passage only, and that bháyamâna<i>h</i>, fearing, clearly implies a personification. Otherwise, one might translate: 'Vala was quiet, O Indra, and the stable of the cow came open, full of fear, before thou struckest.' The meaning of alât<i>ri</i><i>n</i>á would remain the same, the not-barking being here used as a sign that Indra's enemy was cowed, and no longer inclined to revile or defy the power of Indra.

 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:8:1">1</a>. Abhí-hruti seems to have the meaning of assault, injury, insult. It occurs but once, but abhí-hrut, a feminine substantive with the same meaning, occurs several times. The verb hru, which is not mentioned in the Dhâtupâ<i>th</i>a, but has been identified with hvar, occurs in our hymn, verse 12:</p>  
 <p>I, 128, 5. sá<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> trâsate du<i>h</i>-itâ´t abhi-hrúta<i>h</i> <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sât aghâ´t abhi-hrúta<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>He protects us from evil, from assault, from evil speaking, from assault.</p>  
 <p>X, 63, 11. trâ´yadhvam na<i>h</i> du<i>h</i>-évâyâ<i>h</i> abhi-hrúta<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Protect us from mischievous injury!</p>  
 <p>I, 189, 6. abhi-hrútâm ási hí deva vishpá<i>t</i>.</p>  
 <p>For thou, god, art the deliverer from all assaults. Vishpá<i>t</i>, deliverer, from vi and spa<i>s</i>, to bind.</p>  
 <p>Ví-hruta, which occurs twice, means evidently what has been injured or spoiled:</p>  
 <p>VIII, 1, 12. íshkartâ ví-hrutam púnar (iti).</p>  
 <p>He who sets right what has been injured. Cf. VIII, 20, 26.</p>  
 <p>Ávi-hruta again clearly means uninjured, intact, entire:</p>  
 <p>V, 66, 2. tâ´ hí kshatrám ávi-hrutam—â´<i>s</i>âte.</p>  
 <p>For they both have obtained uninjured power.</p>

 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:9:1">1</a>. Tavishá certainly means strength, and that it is used in the plural in the sense of acts of strength, we can see from the first verse of our hymn and other passages. But when we read that tavishâ´<i>n</i>i are placed on the chariots of the Maruts, just as before bhadrâ´, good things, food, &amp;c., are mentioned, it is clear that so abstract a meaning as strength or powers would not be applicable here. We might take it in the modern sense of forces, i. e. your armies, your companions are on your chariots, striving with each other; but as the word is a neuter, weapons, as the means</p>  
 <p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></a></p>  
 <p>of strength, seemed a preferable rendering. As to mithasp<i>ri</i>dhya, see I, 119, 3, <a href="sbe3224.htm#page_164">p. 164</a>.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:9:2">2</a>. The rendering of this passage must depend on the question whether the khâdís, whatever they are, can be carried on the shoulders or not. We saw before (<a href="sbe3221.htm#page_120">p. 120</a>) that khâdís were used both as ornaments and as weapons, and that, when used as weapons, they were most likely rings or quoits with sharp edges. There is at least one other passage where these khâdís are said to be worn on the shoulders:</p>  
 <p>VII, 56, 13. á<i>m</i>seshu â´ maruta<i>h</i> khâdáya<i>h</i> va<i>h</i> váksha<i>h</i>-su rukmâ´<i>h</i> upa-<i>s</i>i<i>s</i>riyâ<i>n</i>â´<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>On your shoulders are the quoits, on your chests the golden chains are fastened.</p>  
 <p>In other places the khâdís are said to be in the hands, hásteshu, but this would only show that they are there when actually used for fighting. Thus we read:</p>  
 <p>I, 168, 3. â´ eshâm á<i>m</i>seshu rambhínî-iva rarabhe, hásteshu khâdí<i>h</i> <i>k</i>a k<i>ri</i>tí<i>h</i> <i>k</i>a sám dadhe.</p>  
 <p>To their shoulders there clings as if a clinging wife, in their hands the quoit is held and the dagger.</p>  
 <p>In V, 58, 2, the Maruts are called khâ´di-hasta, holding the quoits in their hands. There is one passage which was mentioned before (<a href="sbe3221.htm#page_112">p. 112</a>), where the khâdís are said to be on the feet of the Maruts, and on the strength of this passage Professor Roth proposes to alter prá-patheshu to prá-padeshu, and to translate, 'The khâdís are on your forefeet.' I do not think this emendation necessary. Though we do not know the exact shape and character of the khâdí, we know that it was a weapon, most likely a ring, occasionally used for ornament, and carried along either on the feet or on the shoulders, but in actual battle held in the hand. The weapon which Vish<i>n</i>u holds in one of his right hands, the so-called <i>k</i>akra, may be the modern representation of the ancient khâdí. What, however, is quite certain is this, that khâdí in the Veda never means food, as Sâya<i>n</i>a optionally interprets it. This interpretation is accepted by Wilson, who translates, 'At your resting-places on the road refreshments (are ready).' Nay, he</p>  
 <p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="green">p. 231</font></a></p>  
 <p>goes on in a note to use this passage as a proof of the advanced civilisation of India at the time of the Vedic <i>Ri</i>shis. 'The expression,' he says, 'is worthy of note, as indicating the existence of accommodations for the use of travellers: the prapatha is the choltri of the south of India, the sarái of the Mohammedans, a place by the road-side where the travellers may find shelter and provisions.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:9:3">3</a>. This last passage shows that the poet is really representing to himself the Maruts as on their journey, and he therefore adds, 'your axle turns the two (IV, 30, 2) wheels together,' which probably means no more than, 'your chariot is going smoothly or quickly.' Though the expression seems to us hardly correct, yet one can well imagine how the axle was supposed to turn the wheels as the horses were drawing the axle, and the axle acted on the wheels. Anyhow, no other translation seems possible. Samáyâ in the Veda means together, at once, and is the Greek (ὁμῇ, generally ὁμοῦ or ὁμῶς, the Latin simul. Cf. I, 56, 6; 73, 6; 113, 10; 163, 3; VII, 66, 15; IX, 75, 4; 85, 5; 97, 56.</p>  
 <p>V<i>ri</i>t means to turn, and is frequently used with reference to the wheels:</p>  
 <p>VIII, 46, 23. dá<i>s</i>a <i>s</i>yâvâ´<i>h</i>—nemím ní vav<i>ri</i>tu<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>The ten black horses turn down the felly or the wheel.</p>

 <p>I turn the poison out from here.</p>  
 <p>All the words used in this sentence are very old words, and we can with few exceptions turn them into Greek or Latin. In Latin we should have axis vos(ter) circos simul divertit. In Greek ἄξων ὑ(μῶν) κύκλω ὁμῇ …</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>

 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:10:3">3</a>. On éta in the sense of fallow deer, or, it may be, antelope, see I, 165, 5, note 2, page <a href="sbe3226.htm#page_196">196</a>.</p>  
 <p>Éta originally means variegated, and thus becomes a name of any speckled deer, it being difficult to say what exact species is meant. Sâya<i>n</i>a in our passage explains étâ<i>h</i> by <i>s</i>uklavar<i>n</i>â mâlâ<i>h</i>, many-coloured wreaths or chains, which may be right. Yet the suggestion of Professor Roth that étâ<i>h</i>, deer, stands here for the skins of fallow deer, is certainly more poetical, and quite in accordance with the Vedic idiom, which uses, for instance, go, cow, not only in the sense of milk,—that is done even in more homely English,—but also for leather, and thong. It is likewise in accordance with what we know of the earliest dress of the Vedic Indians, that deer-skins should here be mentioned. We learn from Â<i>s</i>valâyana's G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras, of which we now possess an excellent edition by Professor Stenzler, and a reprint of the text and commentary by Râma Nârâya<i>n</i>a Vidyâratna, in the Bibliotheca Indica, that a boy when he was brought to his tutor, i. e. from the eighth to possibly the twenty-fourth year, had to be well combed, and attired in a new dress. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a should wear the skin of an antelope (ai<i>n</i>eya), the Kshatriya the skin of a deer (raurava), the Vai<i>s</i>ya the skin of a goat (â<i>g</i>a). If they wore dresses, that of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a should be dark red (kâshâya), that of the Kshatriya bright red (mâ<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ish<i>th</i>a), that of the Vai<i>s</i>ya yellow (hâridra). The girdle of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a should be of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass, that of the Kshatriya a bow-string, that of the Vai<i>s</i>ya made of sheep's wool. The same regulations occur in other Sûtras, as, for instance, the Dharma-sûtras of the Âpastambîyas and Gautamas, though there are certain characteristic differences in each, which may be due either to local or to chronological causes. Thus according to the Âpastambîya-sûtras, which have been published by Professor Bühler, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a may wear the skin of the hari<i>n</i>a deer, or that of the antelope (ai<i>n</i>eyam), but the latter must be from the black antelope (k<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>am), and, a proviso is added, that if a man wears the black antelope skin, he must never spread it out to sit or sleep on it. As materials for the dress, Âpastamba</p>  
 <p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></a></p>  
 <p>allows <i>s</i>a<i>n</i>a, hemp <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">a</font></a>, or kshumâ, flax, and he adds that woollen dresses are allowed to all castes, as well as the kambala (masc.), which seems to be any cloth made of vegetable substances (darbhâdinirmitam <i>k</i>îram kambalam). He then adds a curious remark, which would seem to show</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></a></p>  
 <p>that the Brâhma<i>n</i>as preferred skins, and the Kshatriyas clothes, for he says that those who wish well to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as should wear a<i>g</i>ina, skins, and those who wish well to the Kshatriyas should wear vastra, clothes, and those who wish well to both should wear both, but, in that case, the skin should always form the outer garment. The Dharma-sûtras of the Gautamas, which were published in India, prescribe likewise for the Brâhma<i>n</i>a the black antelope skin, and allow clothes of hemp or linen (<i>s</i>â<i>n</i>akshauma<i>k</i>îra) as well as kutapas (woollen cloth) for all. What is new among the Gautamas is, that they add the kârpâsa, the cotton dress, which is important as showing an early knowledge of this manufacture. The kârpâsa dress occurs once more as a present to be given to the Potar priest (Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>rauta-sûtras IX, 4), and was evidently considered as a valuable present, taking precedence of the kshaumî or linen dress. It is provided that the cotton dress should not be dyed, for this, I suppose, is the meaning of avik<i>ri</i>ta. Immediately after, however, it is said, that some authorities say the dress should be dyed red (kâshâyam apy eke), the very expression which occurred in Âpastamba, and that, in that case, the red for the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's dress should be taken from the bark of trees (vârksha). Manu, who here, as elsewhere, simply paraphrases the ancient Sûtras, says, II, 41:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">kârsh<i>n</i>arauravabâstâni <i>k</i>armâ<i>n</i>i brahma<i>k</i>âri<i>n</i>a<i>h</i><br> vasîrann ânupûrvye<i>n</i>a <i>s</i>â<i>n</i>akshaumâvikâni <i>k</i>a.</div>  
 <p>'Let Brahma<i>k</i>ârins wear (as outer garments) the skins of the black antelope, the deer, the goat, (as under garments) dresses of hemp, flax, and sheep's wool, in the order of the three castes.'</p>  
 <p>The Sanskrit name for a dressed skin is a<i>g</i>ina, a word which does not occur in the Rig-Veda, but which, if Bopp is right in deriving it from a<i>g</i>á, goat, as αἰγίς from αἴξ, would have meant originally, not skin in general, but a goat-skin. The skins of the éta, here ascribed to the Maruts, would be identical with the ai<i>n</i>eya, which Â<i>s</i>valâyana ascribes to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, not, as we should expect, to the Kshatriya, if, as has been supposed, ai<i>n</i>eya is derived from ena, which is a secondary form, particularly in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="green">p. 235</font></a></p>  
 <p>feminine enî, of eta. There is, however, another word, e<i>d</i>a, a kind of sheep, which, but for Festus, might be haedus, and by its side e<i>n</i>a, a kind of antelope. These two forms pre-suppose an earlier er<i>n</i>a or ar<i>n</i>a, and point therefore in a different direction, though hardly to ἄρνες.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:10:4">4</a>. I translate kshurá by sharp edges, but it might have been translated literally by razors, for, strange as it may sound, razors were known, not only during the Vedic period, but even previous to the Aryan separation. The Sanskrit kshurá is the Greek ξυρός or ξυρόν. In the Veda we have clear allusions to shaving:</p>  
 <p>X, 142, 4. yadâ´ te vâ´ta<i>h</i> anu-vâ´ti <i>s</i>o<i>k</i>í<i>h</i>, váptâ-iva <i>s</i>má<i>s</i>ru vapasi prá bhû´ma.</p>  
 <p>When the wind blows after thy blast, then thou shavest the earth as a barber shaves the beard. Cf. I, 65, 4.</p>  
 <p>If, as B. and R. suggest, vaptar, barber, is connected with the more modern name for barber in Sanskrit, viz. nâpita. we should have to admit a root svap, in the sense of tearing or pulling, vellere, from which we might derive the Vedic svapû´ (VII, 56, 3), beak. Corresponding to this we find in Old High-German snabul, beak, (schnepfe, snipe,) and in Old Norse nef. The Anglo-Saxon neb means mouth and nose, while in modern English neb or nib is used for the bill or beak of a bird <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">a</font></a>. Another derivation of nâpita, proposed by Professor Weber (Kuhn's Beiträge, vol. i, p. 505), who takes nâpita as a dialectic form of snâpitar, balneator, or lavator, might be admitted if it could be proved that in India also the barber was at the same time a balneator. Burnouf, Lotus, p. 452, translating from the Sâma<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a-phala Sutta, mentions among the different professions of the people those of 'portier,' 'barbier,' and 'baigneur.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>

 <p>No one lives beyond the statute of the gods, even if he had a hundred lives.</p>  
 <p>VII, 5, 4. táva tri-dhâ´tu p<i>ri</i>thivî´ utá dyaú<i>h</i> vaí<i>s</i>vânara vratám agne sa<i>k</i>anta.</p>  
 <p>The earth and the sky followed thy threefold law, O Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara.</p>  
 <p>VII, 87, 7. yá<i>h</i> m<i>ri</i><i>l</i>áyâti <i>k</i>akrúshe <i>k</i>it â´ga<i>h</i> vayám syâma váru<i>n</i>e ánâgâ<i>h</i>, ánu vratâ´ni ádite<i>h</i> <i>ri</i>dhánta<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Let us be sinless before Varu<i>n</i>a, who is gracious even to him who has committed sin, performing the laws of Aditi!</p>  
 <p>II, 28, 8. náma<i>h</i> purâ´ te varu<i>n</i>a utá nûnám utá aparám tuvi-<i>g</i>âta bravâma, tvé hí kam párvate ná <i>s</i>ritâ´ni ápra<i>k</i>yutâni du<i>h</i>-dabha vratâ´ni.</p>  
 <p>Formerly, and now, and also in future let us give praise to thee, O Varu<i>n</i>a; for in thee, O unconquerable, all laws are grounded, immovable as on a rock.</p>  
 <p>A very frequent expression is ánu vratám, according to the command of a god, II, 38, 3; 6; VIII, 40, 8; or simply ánu vratám, according to law and order:</p>  
 <p>I, 136, 5. tám aryamâ´ abhí rakshati <i>ri</i><i>g</i>u-yántam ánu vratám.</p>  
 <p>Aryaman protects him who acts uprightly according to law.</p>  
 <p>Cf. III, 61, 1; IV, 13, 2; V, 69, 1.</p>  
 <p>3. The laws or ordinances or institutions of the gods are sometimes taken for the sacrifices which are supposed to be enjoined by the gods, and the performance of which is, in a certain sense, the performance of the divine will.</p>  
 <p>I, 93, 8. yá<i>h</i> agnî´shómâ havíshâ saparyâ´t devadrî´<i>k</i>â mánasâ yá<i>h</i> gh<i>ri</i>téna, tásya vratám rakshatam pâtám á<i>m</i>hasa<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>He who worships Agni and Soma with oblations, with a godly mind, or with an offering, protect his sacrifice, shield him from evil!</p>  
 <p>I, 31, 2. tvám agne prathamá<i>h</i> áṅgira<i>h</i>-tama<i>h</i> kaví<i>h</i> devâ´nâm pári bhûshasi vratám.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p>Agni, the first and wisest of poets, thou performest the sacrifice of the gods.</p>  
 <p>III, 3, 9. tásya vratâ´ni bhûri-poshí<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> vayám úpa bhûshema dáme â´ suv<i>ri</i>ktí-bhi<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Let us, who possess much wealth, perform with prayers the sacrifices of Agni within our house.</p>  
 <p>In another acceptation the vratas of the gods are what they perform and establish themselves, their own deeds:</p>  
 <p>III, 6, 5. vratâ´ te agne mahatá<i>h</i> mahâ´ni táva krátvâ ródasî (íti) â´ tatantha.</p>  
 <p>The deeds of thee, the great Agni, are great, by thy power thou hast stretched out heaven and earth.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 42, 1. ástabhnât dyâ´m ásura<i>h</i> vi<i>s</i>vá-vedâ<i>h</i> ámimîta varimâ´<i>n</i>am p<i>ri</i>thivyâ´<i>h</i>, a asîdat ví<i>s</i>vâ bhúvanâni sam-râ´<i>t</i> ví<i>s</i>vâ ít tâ´ni váru<i>n</i>asya vratâ´ni.</p>  
 <p>The wise spirit established the sky, and made the width of the earth, as king he approached all beings,—all these are the works of Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>VI, 14, 3. tû´rvanta<i>h</i> dásyum âyáva<i>h</i> vrataí<i>h</i> sî´kshanta<i>h</i> avratám.</p>  
 <p>Men fight the fiend, trying to overcome by their deeds him who performs no sacrifices; or, the lawless enemy.</p>  
 <p>Lastly, vratá comes to mean sway, power, or work, and the expression vraté táva signifies, at thy command, under thy auspices:</p>  
 <p>I, 24, 15. átha vayám âditya vraté táva ánâgasa<i>h</i> áditaye syâma.</p>  
 <p>Then, O Âditya, under thy auspices may we be guiltless before Aditi.</p>  
 <p>VI, 54, 9. pû´shan táva vraté vayám ni rishyema kádâ <i>k</i>aná.</p>  
 <p>O Pûshan, may we never fail under thy protection.</p>  
 <p>X, 36, 13. ye savitû<i>h</i> satyá-savasya ví<i>s</i>ve mitrásya vraté váru<i>n</i>asya devâ´<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>All the gods who are in the power of Savitar, Mitra, and Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>V, 83, 5. yásya vraté p<i>ri</i>thivî´ námnamîti yásya vraté <i>s</i>aphá-vat <i>g</i>árbhurîti, yásya vraté óshadhî<i>h</i> vi<i>s</i>vá-rûpâ<i>h</i> sá<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> par<i>g</i>anya máhi <i>s</i>árma ya<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="green">p. 240</font></a></p>  
 <p>At whose bidding the earth bows down, at whose bidding hoofed animals run about, at whose bidding the plants assume all shapes, mayest thou, O Par<i>g</i>anya, yield us great protection!</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:12:3">3</a>. Dâtrá, if derived from dâ, would mean gift, and that meaning is certainly the most applicable in some passages where it occurs:</p>  
 <p>IX, 97, 55. ási bhága<i>h</i> ási dâtrásya dâtâ´.</p>  
 <p>Thou art Bhaga, thou art the giver of the gift.</p>  
 <p>In other passages, too, particularly in those where the verb dâ or some similar verb occurs in the same verse, it can hardly be doubted that the poet took dâtrá, like dátra or dáttra, in the sense of gift, bounty, largess:</p>  
 <p>I, 116, 6. yám a<i>s</i>vinâ dadáthu<i>h</i> <i>s</i>vetám á<i>s</i>vam—tát vâm dâtrám máhi kîrtényam bhût.</p>  
 <p>The white horse, O A<i>s</i>vins, which you gave, that your gift was great and to be praised.</p>  
 <p>I, 185, 3. anehá<i>h</i> dâtrám ádite<i>h</i> anarvám huvé.</p>  
 <p>I call for the unrivalled, the uninjured bounty of Aditi.</p>  
 <p>VII, 56, 21. mâ´ va<i>h</i> dâtrâ´t maruta<i>h</i> ní<i>h</i> arâma.</p>  
 <p>May we not fall away from your bounty, O Maruts!</p>  
 <p>III, 54, 16. yuvám hí sthá<i>h</i> rayi-daú na<i>h</i> rayî<i>n</i>â´m dâtrám rakshethe.</p>  
 <p>For you, Nâsatyas, are our givers of riches, you protect the gift.</p>  
 <p>VI, 20, 7. <i>ri</i><i>g</i>í<i>s</i>vane dâtrám dâ<i>s</i>úshe dâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>To Ri<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>van, the giver, thou givest the gift.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 43, 33. tát te sahasva îmahe dâtrám yát ná upadásyati, tvát agne vâ´ryam vásu.</p>  
 <p>We ask thee, strong hero, for the gift which does not perish; we ask from thee the precious wealth.</p>  
 <p>X, 69, 4. dâtrám rakshasva yát idám te asmé (íti).</p>  
 <p>Protect this gift of thine which thou hast given to us.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 44, 18. î´<i>s</i>ishe vâ´ryasya hí dâtrásya agne svã<i>h</i>-pati<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>For thou, O Agni, lord of heaven, art the master of the precious gift. Cf. IV, 38, 1.</p>  
 <p>Professor Roth considers that dâtrá is derived rather from dâ, to divide, and that it means share, lot, possession. But there is not a single passage where the meaning of gift or</p>  
 <p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></a></p>  
 <p>bounty does not answer all purposes. In VII, 56, 21, mâ´ va<i>h</i> dâtrâ´t maruta<i>h</i> ní<i>h</i> arâma, is surely best translated by, 'let us not fall away from your bounty,' and in our own passage the same meaning should be assigned to dâtrá. The idea of dâtrá, bounty, is by no means incompatible with vratá, realm, dominion, sway, if we consider that the sphere within which the bounty of a king or a god is exercised and accepted, is in one sense his realm. What the poet therefore says in our passage is simply this, that the bounty of the Maruts extends as far as the realm of Aditi, i. e. is endless, or extends everywhere, Aditi being in its original conception the deity of the unbounded world beyond, the earliest attempt at expressing the Infinite.</p>  
 <p>As to dâ´tra occurring once with the accent on the first syllable in the sense of sickle, see M. M., 'Über eine Stelle in Yâska's Commentar zum Naigha<i>n</i><i>t</i>uka,' Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 1853, vol. vii, P. 375.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 78, 10. táva ít indra ahám â-<i>s</i>ásâ háste dâ´tram <i>k</i>aná â´ dade.</p>  
 <p>Trusting in thee alone, O Indra, I take the sickle in my hand.</p>  
 <p>This dâ´tra, sickle, is derived from do, to cut.</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi, the Infinite.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:12:4">4</a>. Aditi, an ancient god or goddess, is in reality the earliest name invented to express the Infinite; not the Infinite as the result of a long process of abstract reasoning, but the visible Infinite, visible, as it were, to the naked eye, the endless expanse beyond the earth, beyond the clouds, beyond the sky. That was called A-diti, the un-bound, the un-bounded; one might almost say, but for fear of misunderstandings, the Absolute, for it is derived from diti, bond, and the negative particle, and meant therefore originally what is free from bonds of any kind, whether of space or time, free from physical weakness, free from moral guilt. Such a conception became of necessity a being, a person, a god. To us such a name and such a conception seem decidedly modern, and to find in the Veda Aditi, the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Infinite, as the mother of the principal gods, is certainly, at first sight, startling. But the fact is that the thoughts of primitive humanity were not only different from our thoughts, but different also from what we think their thoughts ought to have been. The poets of the Veda indulged freely in theogonic speculations, without being frightened by any contradictions. They knew of Indra as the greatest of gods, they knew of Agni as the god of gods, they knew of Varu<i>n</i>a as the ruler of all, but they were by no means startled at the idea that their Indra had a mother, or that their Agni was born like a babe from the friction of two fire-sticks, or that Varu<i>n</i>a and his brother Mitra were nursed in the lap of Aditi. Some poet would take hold o the idea of an unbounded power, of Aditi, originally without any reference to other gods. Very soon these ideas met, and, without any misgivings, either the gods were made subordinate to, and represented as the sons of Aditi, or where Indra was to be praised as supreme, Aditi was represented as doing him homage.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 12, 14. utá sva-râ<i>g</i>e áditi<i>h</i> stómam índrâya <i>g</i>î<i>g</i>anat.</p>  
 <p>And Aditi produced a hymn for Indra, the king.</p>  
 <p>Here Professor Roth takes Aditi as an epithet of Agni, not as the name of the goddess Aditi, while Dr. Muir rightly takes it in the latter sense, and likewise retains stómam instead of sómam, as printed by Professor Aufrecht. Cf. VII, 38, 4.</p>  
 <p>The idea of the Infinite, as I have tried to show elsewhere, was most powerfully impressed on the awakening mind, or, as we now say, was revealed, by the East <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">a</font></a>. ‘It is impossible to enter fully into all the thoughts and feelings that passed through the minds of the early poets when they formed names for that far, far East from whence even the early dawn, the sun, the day, their own life, seemed to spring. A new life flashed up every morning before their eyes, and the fresh breezes of the dawn reached them like greetings from the distant lands beyond the mountains, beyond the clouds, beyond the dawn, beyond “the immortal</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></a></p>  
 <p>sea which brought us hither.” The dawn seemed to them to open golden gates for the sun to pass in triumph, and while those gates were open, their eyes and their mind strove in their childish way to pierce beyond the limits of this finite world. That silent aspect awakened in the human mind the conception of the Infinite, the Immortal, the Divine.’ Aditi is a name for that distant East, but Aditi is more than the dawn. Aditi is beyond the dawn, and in one place (I, 113, 19) the dawn is called 'the face of Aditi,' áditer ánîkam. Thus we read:</p>  
 <p>V, 62, 8. híra<i>n</i>ya-rûpam ushása<i>h</i> ví-ush<i>t</i>au áya<i>h</i>-sthû<i>n</i>am út-itâ sû´ryasya, â´ rohatha<i>h</i> varu<i>n</i>a mitra gártam áta<i>h</i> <i>k</i>akshâthe (íti) áditim dítim h.</p>  
 <p>Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, you mount your chariot, which is golden, when the dawn bursts forth, and has iron poles at the setting of the sun: from thence you see Aditi and Diti, i. e. what is yonder and what is here.</p>  
 <p>If we keep this original conception of Aditi clearly before our mind, the various forms which Aditi assumes, even in the hymns of the Veda, will not seem incoherent. Aditi is not a prominent deity in the Veda, she is celebrated rather in her sons, the Âdityas, than in her own person. While there are so many hymns addressed to Ushas, the dawn, or Indra, or Agni, or Savitar, there is but one hymn, X, 72, which from our point of view, though not from that of Indian theologians, might be called a hymn to Aditi. Nevertheless Aditi is a familiar name; a name of the past, whether in time or in thought only, and a name that lives on in the name of the Âdityas, the sons of Aditi, including the principal deities of the Veda.</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi and the Âdityas.</p>  
 <p>Thus we read:</p>  
 <p>I, 107, 2. ûpa na<i>h</i> devâ´<i>h</i> ávasâ â´ gamantu áṅgirasâm sâ´ma-bhi<i>h</i> stûyámânâ<i>h</i>, índra<i>h</i> indriyaí<i>h</i> marûta<i>h</i> marút-bhi<i>h</i> âdityaí<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> <i>s</i>árma ya<i>m</i>sat.</p>  
 <p>May the gods come to us with their help, praised by the songs of the Aṅgiras,—Indra with his powers, the Maruts with the storms, may Aditi with the Âdityas give us protection!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></a></p>  
 <p>X, 66, 3. índra<i>h</i> vásu-bhi<i>h</i> pári pâtu na<i>h</i> gáyam âdityaí<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> <i>s</i>árma ya<i>k</i><i>kh</i>atu, rudrá<i>h</i> rudrébhi<i>h</i> devá<i>h</i> m<i>ri</i><i>l</i>ayâti na<i>h</i> tvásh<i>t</i>â na<i>h</i> gnâ´bhi<i>h</i> suvitâ´ya <i>g</i>invatu.</p>  
 <p>May Indra with the Vasus watch our house, may Aditi with the Âdityas give us protection, may the divine Rudra with the Rudras have mercy upon us, may Tvash<i>t</i>ar with the mothers bring us to happiness!</p>  
 <p>III, 54, 20. âdityaí<i>h</i> nah áditi<i>h</i> <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>otu yá<i>k</i><i>kh</i>antu na<i>h</i> marûta<i>h</i> <i>s</i>árma bhadrám.</p>  
 <p>May Aditi with the Âdityas hear us, may the Maruts give us good protection!</p>  
 <p>In another passage Varu<i>n</i>a takes the place of Aditi as the leader of the Âdityas:</p>  
 <p>VII, 35, 6. <i>s</i>ám na<i>h</i> índra<i>h</i> vásu-bhi<i>h</i> devá<i>h</i> astu <i>s</i>ám âdityébhi<i>h</i> váru<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> su-<i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i>, <i>s</i>ám na<i>h</i> rudrá<i>h</i> rudrébhi<i>h</i> <i>g</i>álâsha<i>h</i> <i>s</i>ám na<i>h</i> tvásh<i>t</i>â gnâ´bhi<i>h</i> ihá <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>otu.</p>  
 <p>May Indra bless us, the god with the Vasus! May Varu<i>n</i>a, the glorious, bless us with the Âdityas! May the relieving Rudra with the Rudras bless us! May Tvash<i>t</i>ar with the mothers kindly hear us here!</p>  
 <p>Even in passages where the poet seems to profess an exclusive worship of Aditi, as in</p>  
 <p>V, 69, 3. prâtá<i>h</i> devî´m áditim <i>g</i>ohavîmi madhyándine út-itâ sû´ryasya,</p>  
 <p>I invoke the divine Aditi early in the morning, at noon, and at the setting of the sun,</p>  
 <p>Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, her principal sons, are mentioned immediately after, and implored, like her, to bestow blessings on their worshipper.</p>  
 <p>Her exclusive worship appears once, in VIII, 19, 14.</p>  
 <p>A very frequent expression is that of âdityâ´<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> without any copula, to signify the Âdityas and Aditi:</p>  
 <p>IV, 25, 3. ká<i>h</i> devâ´nâm áva<i>h</i> adyá v<i>ri</i><i>n</i>îte ká<i>h</i> âdityâ´n áditim <i>g</i>yóti<i>h</i> î<i>t</i><i>t</i>e.</p>  
 <p>Who does choose now the protection of the gods? Who asks the Âdityas, Aditi, for their light?</p>  
 <p>VI, 51, 5. ví<i>s</i>ve âdityâ<i>h</i> adite sa-<i>g</i>óshâ<i>h</i> asmábhyam <i>s</i>árma bahulám ví yanta.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></a></p>  
 <p>All ye Âdityas, Aditi together, grant to us your manifold protection!</p>  
 <p>X, 39, 11. ná tám râ<i>g</i>ânau adite kúta<i>h</i> <i>k</i>aná ná á<i>m</i>ha<i>h</i> a<i>s</i>noti du<i>h</i>-itám náki<i>h</i> bhayám.</p>  
 <p>O ye two kings (the A<i>s</i>vins), Aditi, no evil reaches him from anywhere, no misfortune, no fear (whom you protect). Cf. VII, 66, 6.</p>  
 <p>X, 63, 5. tâ´n â´ vivâsa námasâ suv<i>ri</i>ktí-bhi<i>h</i> mahá<i>h</i> âdityâ´n áditim svastáye.</p>  
 <p>I cherish them with worship and with hymns, the great Âdityas, Aditi, for happiness' sake.</p>  
 <p>X, 63, 17. evá platé<i>h</i> sûnú<i>h</i> avîv<i>ri</i>dhat va<i>h</i> ví<i>s</i>ve âdityâ<i>h</i> adite manîshî´.</p>  
 <p>The wise son of Plati magnified you, all ye Âdityas, Aditi!</p>  
 <p>X, 65, 9. par<i>g</i>ányâvâ´tâ v<i>ri</i>shabhâ´ purîshí<i>n</i>â indravâyû´ (íti) váru<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> mitrá<i>h</i> aryamâ´, devâ´n âdityâ´n áditim havâmahe yé pâ´rthivâsa<i>h</i> divyâ´sa<i>h</i> ap-sú yé.</p>  
 <p>There are Par<i>g</i>anya and Vâta, the powerful, the givers of rain, Indra and Vâyu, Varu<i>n</i>a, Mitra, Aryaman, we call the divine Âdityas, Aditi, those who dwell on the earth, in heaven, in the waters.</p>  
 <p>We may not be justified in saying that there ever was a period in the history of the religious thought of India, a period preceding the worship of the Âdityas, when Aditi, the Infinite, was worshipped, though to the sage who first coined this name, it expressed, no doubt, for a time the principal, if not the only object of his faith and worship.</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi and Daksha.</p>  
 <p>Soon, however, the same mental process which led on later speculators from the earth to the elephant, and from the elephant to the tortoise, led the Vedic poets beyond Aditi, the Infinite. There was something beyond that Infinite which for a time they had grasped by the name of Aditi, and this, whether intentionally or by a mere accident of language, they called dáksha, literally power or the powerful. All this, no doubt, sounds strikingly modern, yet, though the passages in which this dáksha is mentioned are few in number, I should not venture to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>say that they are necessarily modern, even if by modern we mean only later than 1000 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span> Nothing can bring the perplexity of the ancient mind, if once drawn into this vortex of speculation, more clearly before us than if we read:</p>  
 <p>X, 72, 4-5. âdite<i>h</i> dáksha<i>h</i> a<i>g</i>âyata dákshât û<i>m</i> (íti) áditi<i>h</i> pári,—áditi<i>h</i> hí á<i>g</i>anish<i>t</i>a dáksha yâ´ duhitâ´ táva, tâ´m devâ´<i>h</i> ánu a<i>g</i>âyanta bhadrâ´<i>h</i> am<i>rí</i>ta-bandhava<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Daksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha. For Aditi was born, O Daksha, she who is thy daughter; after her the gods were born, the blessed, who share in immortality.</p>  
 <p>Or, in more mythological language:</p>  
 <p>X, 64, 5. dákshasya vâ adite <i>g</i>ánmani vraté râ´<i>g</i>ânâ mitrâ´-váru<i>n</i>â â´ vivâsasi.</p>  
 <p>Or thou, O Aditi, nursest in the birthplace of Daksha the two kings, Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>Nay, even this does not suffice. There is something again beyond Aditi and Daksha, and one poet says:</p>  
 <p>X, 5, 7. ásat <i>k</i>a sát <i>k</i>a paramé ví-oman dákshasya <i>g</i>ánman ádite<i>h</i> upá-sthe.</p>  
 <p>Not-being and Being are in the highest heaven, in the birthplace of Daksha, in the lap of Aditi.</p>  
 <p>At last something like a theogony, though full of contradictions, was imagined, and in the same hymn from which we have already quoted, the poet says:</p>  
 <p>X, 72, 1-4. devâ´nâm nú vayám <i>g</i>â´nâ prá vo<i>k</i>âma vipanyáyâ, ukthéshu <i>s</i>asyámâneshu yá<i>h</i> (yát?) pá<i>s</i>yât ut-tare yugé. 1.</p>  
 <p>bráhma<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> páti<i>h</i> etâ´ sám karmâ´ra<i>h</i>-iva adhamat, devâ´nâm pûrvyé yugé ásata<i>h</i> sát a<i>g</i>âyata. 2.</p>  
 <p>devâ´nâm yugé prathamé ásata<i>h</i> sát a<i>g</i>âyata, tát â´<i>s</i>â<i>h</i> ánu a<i>g</i>âyanta tát uttâná-pada<i>h</i> pári. 3.</p>  
 <p>bhû´<i>h</i> <i>g</i>a<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>e uttâná-pada<i>h</i> bhuvá<i>h</i> â´<i>s</i>â<i>h</i> a<i>g</i>âyanta, ádite<i>h</i> dáksha<i>h</i> a<i>g</i>âyata, dákshât û<i>m</i> (íti) áditi<i>h</i> pári. 4.</p>  
 <p>1. Let us now with praise proclaim the births of the gods, that a man may see them in a future age, whenever these hymns are sung.</p>  
 <p>2. Brahma<i>n</i>aspati <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">a</font></a> blew them together like a smith (with</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="green">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>his bellows); in a former age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being.</p>  
 <p>3. In the first age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being, after it were born the Regions (space), from them Uttânapada;</p>  
 <p>4. From Uttânapad the Earth was born, the Regions were born from the Earth. Daksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha.</p>  
 <p>The ideas of Being and Not-being (τὸ ὄν and τὸ μὴ ὄν) are familiar to the Hindus from a very early time in their intellectual growth, and they can only have been the result of abstract speculation. Therefore dáksha, too, in the sense of power or potentia, may have been a metaphysical conception. But it may also have been suggested by a mere accident of language, a never-failing source of ancient thoughts. The name dáksha-pitara<i>h</i>, an epithet of the gods, has generally been translated by 'those who have Daksha for their father.' But it may have been used originally in a very different sense. Professor Roth has, I think, convincingly proved that this epithet dáksha-pitar, as given to certain gods, does not mean, the gods who have Daksha for their father, but that it had originally the simpler meaning of fathers of strength, or, as he translates it, 'preserving, possessing, granting faculties <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">a</font></a>.' This is particularly clear in one passage:</p>  
 <p>III, 27, 9. bhûtâ´nâm gárbham â´ dadhe, dákshasya, pitáram.</p>  
 <p>I place Agni, the source of all beings, the father of strength …</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>After this we can hardly hesitate how to translate the next verse:</p>  
 <p>VI, 50, 2. su-<i>g</i>yótisha<i>h</i>—dáksha-pit<i>rî</i>n—devâ´n.</p>  
 <p>The resplendent gods, the fathers of strength.</p>  
 <p>It may seem more doubtful, when we come to gods like Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, whom we are so much accustomed to regard as Âdityas, or sons of Aditi, and who therefore, according to the theogony mentioned before, would have the best claim to the name of sons of Daksha; yet here, too, the original and simple meaning is preferable; nay, it is most likely that from passages like this, the later explanation, which makes Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a the sons of Daksha, may have sprung.</p>  
 <p>VII, 66, 2. yâ´—su-dákshâ dáksha-pitarâ.</p>  
 <p>Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, who are of good strength, the fathers of strength.</p>  
 <p>Lastly, even men may claim this name; for, unless we change the accent, we must translate:</p>  
 <p>VIII, 63, 10. avasyáva<i>h</i> yushmâ´bhi<i>h</i> dáksha-pitara<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>We suppliants, being, through your aid, fathers of strength.</p>  
 <p>But whatever view we take, whether we take dáksha in the sense of power, as a personification of a philosophical conception, or as the result of a mythological misunderstanding occasioned by the name of dáksha-pitar, the fact remains that in certain hymns of the Rig-veda (VIII, 25, 5) Dáksha, like Aditi, has become a divine person, and has retained his place as one of the Âdityas to the very latest time of Purâ<i>n</i>ic tradition.</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi in her Cosmic Character.</p>  
 <p>But to return to Aditi. Let us look upon her as the Infinite personified, and most passages, even those where she is presented as a subordinate deity, will become intelligible.</p>  
 <p>Aditi, in her cosmic character, is the Beyond, the unbounded realm beyond earth, sky, and heaven, and originally she was distinct from the sky, the earth, and the ocean. Aditi is mentioned by the side of heaven and earth, which</p>  
 <p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></a></p>  
 <p>shows that, though in more general language she may be identified with heaven and earth in their unlimited character, her original conception was different. This we see in passages where different deities or powers are invoked together, particularly if they are invoked together in the same verse, and where Aditi holds a separate place by the side of heaven and earth:</p>  
 <p>I, 94, 16 (final). tát na<i>h</i> mitrá<i>h</i> váru<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> mamahantâm áditi<i>h</i> síndhu<i>h</i> p<i>ri</i>thivî´ utá dyaú<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a grant us this, may Aditi, Sindhu (sea), the Earth, and the Sky!</p>  
 <p>In other passages, too, where Aditi has assumed a more personal character, she still holds her own by the side of heaven and earth; cf. IX, 97, 58 (final):</p>  
 <p>I, 191, 6. dyaû<i>h</i> va<i>h</i> pitâ´ p<i>ri</i>thivî´ mâtâ´ sóma<i>h</i> bhrâ´tâ áditi<i>h</i> svásâ.</p>  
 <p>The Sky is your father, the Earth your mother, Soma your brother, Aditi your sister.</p>

 <p>The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Âdityas, the source of immortality, I tell it forth to the man of understanding, may he not offend the cow, the guiltless Aditi! Cf. I, 153, 3; IX, 96, 15; Vâ<i>g</i>asan. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ XIII, 49.</p>

 <p>Sky, father, Earth, kind mother, Fire, brother, bright gods, have mercy upon us! All Âdityas (and) Aditi together, grant us your manifold protection!</p>

 <p>Let us for welfare step into the divine boat, with good oars, faultless and leakless—the well-protecting Earth, the peerless Sky, the sheltering, well-guiding Aditi!</p>

 <p>Aditi, and Heaven and Earth.</p>  
 <p>Where two or more verses come together, the fact that Aditi is mentioned by the side of Heaven and Earth may seem less convincing, because in these Nivids or long strings of invocations different names or representatives of one and the same power are not unfrequently put together. For instance,</p>  
 <p>X, 36, 1-3. ushásânáktâ b<i>ri</i>hatî´ (íti) su-pé<i>s</i>asâ dyâ´vâkshâ´mâ váru<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> mitrá<i>h</i> aryamâ´, índram huve marúta<i>h</i> párvatân apá<i>h</i> âdityâ´n dyâ´vâp<i>ri</i>thivî´ (íti) apá<i>h</i> svãr (íti svã<i>h</i>). 1.</p>

 <p>1. There are the grand and beautiful Morning and Night, Heaven and Earth, Varu<i>n</i>a, Mitra, Aryaman; I call Indra, the Maruts, the Waters, the Âdityas, Heaven and Earth, the Waters, the Heaven.</p>  
 <p>2. May Heaven and Earth, the provident, the righteous, preserve us from sin and mischief! May the malevolent Nir<i>ri</i>ti not rule over us! This blessing of the gods we ask for to-day.</p>  
 <p>3. May Aditi protect us from all sin, the mother of Mitra and of the rich Varu<i>n</i>a! May we obtain heavenly light without enemies! This blessing of the gods we ask for to-day.</p>  
 <p>Here we cannot but admit that Dyâ´vâkshâ´mâ, heaven and earth, is meant for the same divine couple as Dyâ´vâp<i>ri</i>thivî´, heaven and earth, although under slightly differing names they are invoked separately. The waters are invoked twice in the same verse and under the same name; nor is there any indication that, as in other passages, the waters of the sky are meant as distinct from the waters of the sea. Nevertheless even here, Aditi, who in the third verse is called distinctly the mother of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, cannot well have been meant for the same deity as Heaven and Earth, mentioned in the second verse; and the author of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="green">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>these two verses, while asking the same blessing from both, must have been aware of the original independent character of Aditi.</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi as Mother.</p>  
 <p>In this character of a deity of the far East, of an Orient in the true sense of the word, Aditi was naturally thought of as the mother of certain gods, particularly of those that were connected with the daily rising and setting of the sun. If it was asked whence comes the dawn, or the sun, or whence come day and night, or Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, or any of the bright, solar, eastern deities, the natural answer was that they come from the Orient, that they are the sons of Aditi. Thus we read in</p>  
 <p>IX, 74, 3. urvî´ gávyûti<i>h</i> ádite<i>h</i> <i>ri</i>tám yaté.</p>  
 <p>Wide is the space for him who goes on the right path of Aditi.</p>  
 <p>In VIII, 25, 3, we are told that Aditi bore Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, and these in verse 5 are called the sons of Daksha (power), and the grandsons of <i>S</i>avas, which again means might: nápâtâ <i>s</i>ávasa<i>h</i> maná<i>h</i> sûnû´ (íti) dákshasya su-krátû (íti). In X, 36, 3, Aditi is called the mother of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a; likewise in X, 132, 6; see also VI, 67, 4. In VIII, 47, 9, Aditi is called the mother of Mitra, Aryaman, Varu<i>n</i>a, who in VII, 60, 5 are called her sons. In X, 11, 1, Varu<i>n</i>a is called yahvá<i>h</i> ádite<i>h</i>, the son of Aditi (cf. VIII, 19, 12); in VII, 41, 2, Bhaga is mentioned as her son. In X, 72, 8, we hear of eight sons of Aditi, but it is added that she approached the gods with seven sons only, and that the eighth (mârtâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>á, addled egg) was thrown away: ash<i>t</i>aú putrâ´sa<i>h</i> ádite<i>h</i> yé <i>g</i>âtâ´<i>h</i> tanvã<i>h</i> pári, devâ´n úpa prá ait saptá-bhi<i>h</i> párâ mârtâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ám âsyat.</p>  
 <p>In X, 63, 2, the gods in general are represented as born from Aditi, the waters, and the earth: yé sthá <i>g</i>âtâ´<i>h</i> ádite<i>h</i> at-bhyá<i>h</i> pári yé p<i>ri</i>thivyâ´<i>h</i> té me ihá <i>s</i>ruta hávam.</p>  
 <p>You who are born of Aditi, from the water, you who are born of the earth, hear ye all my call!</p>  
 <p>The number seven, with regard to the Âdityas, occurs also in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>IX, 114, 3. saptá dí<i>s</i>a<i>h</i> nâ´nâ-sûryâ<i>h</i> saptá hótâra<i>h</i> <i>ri</i>tví<i>g</i>a<i>h</i>, devâ´<i>h</i> âdityâ´<i>h</i> yé saptá tébhi<i>h</i> soma abhí raksha na<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>There are seven regions with their different suns, there are seven Hotars as priests, those who are the seven gods, the Âdityas, with them, O Soma, protect us!</p>  
 <p align="center">The Seven Âdityas.</p>  
 <p>This number of seven Âdityas requires an explanation. To say that seven is a solemn or sacred number is to say very little, for however solemn or sacred that number may be elsewhere, it is not more sacred than any other number in the Veda. The often-mentioned seven rivers have a real geographical foundation, like the seven hills of Rome. The seven flames or treasures of Agni (V, 1, 5) and of Soma and Rudra (VI, 74, I), the seven paridhis or logs at certain sacrifices (X, 90, 15), the seven Harits or horses of the sun, the seven Hotar priests (III, 7, 7; 10, 4), the seven cities of the enemy destroyed by Indra (I, 63, 7), and even the seven <i>Ri</i>shis (X, 82, 2; 109, 4), all these do not prove that the number of seven was more sacred than the number of one or three or five or ten used in the Veda in a very similar way. With regard to the seven Âdityas, however, we are still able to see that their number of seven or eight had something to do with solar movements. If their number had always been eight, we should feel inclined to trace the number of the Âdityas back to the eight regions, or the eight cardinal points of the heaven. Thus we read:</p>  
 <p>I, 35, 8. ash<i>t</i>aú ví akhyat kakúbha<i>h</i> p<i>ri</i>thivyâ´<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>The god Savitar lighted up the eight points of the earth (not the eight hills).</p>  
 <p>But we have seen already that though the number of Âdityas was originally supposed to have been eight, it was reduced to seven, and this could hardly be said in any sense of the eight points of the compass. Cf. Taitt. Âr. I, 7, 6.</p>  
 <p>As we cannot think in ancient India of the seven planets, I can only suggest the seven days or tithis of the four parvans of the lunar month as a possible prototype of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Âdityas. This might even explain the destruction of the eighth Âditya, considering that the eighth day of each parvan, owing to its uncertainty, might be represented as exposed to decay and destruction. This would explain such passages as,</p>  
 <p>IV, 7, 5. yá<i>g</i>ish<i>th</i>am saptá dhâ´ma-bhi<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Agni, most worthy of sacrifice in the seven stations.</p>  
 <p>IX, 102, 2. ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ásya saptá dhâ´ma-bhi<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>In the seven stations of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>The seven threads of the sacrifice may have the same origin:</p>  
 <p>II, 5, 2. â´ yásmin saptá ra<i>s</i>máya<i>h</i> tatâ´<i>h</i> ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ásya netári, manushvát daívyam ash<i>t</i>amám.</p>  
 <p>In whom, as the leader of the sacrifice, the seven threads are stretched out,—the eighth divine being is manlike (?).</p>  
 <p>The sacrifice itself is called, X, 124, 1, saptá-tantu, having seven threads.</p>  
 <p>X, 122, 3. saptá dhâ´mâni pari-yán ámartya<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Agni, the immortal, who goes round the seven stations.</p>  
 <p>X, 8, 4. usháh-usha<i>h</i> hí vaso (íti) ágram éshi tvám yamáyo<i>h</i> abhava<i>h</i> vi-bhâ´vâ, <i>ri</i>tâ´ya saptá dadhishe padâ´ni <i>g</i>anáyan mitrám tanvẽ svâ´yai.</p>  
 <p>For thou, Vasu (Agni), comest first every morning, thou art the illuminator of the twins (day and night). Thou holdest the seven places for the sacrifice, creating Mitra (the sun) for thy own body.</p>  
 <p>X, 5, 6. saptá maryâ´dâ<i>h</i> kaváya<i>h</i> tatakshu<i>h</i> tâ´sâm ékâm ít abhí a<i>m</i>hurá<i>h</i> gât.</p>  
 <p>The sages established the seven divisions, but mischief befell one of them.</p>  
 <p>I, 22, 16. áta<i>h</i> devâ´<i>h</i> avantu na<i>h</i> yáta<i>h</i> vísh<i>n</i>u<i>h</i> vi-<i>k</i>akramé p<i>ri</i>thivyâ´<i>h</i> saptá dhâ´ma-bhi<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May the gods protect us from whence Vish<i>n</i>u strode forth, by the seven stations of the earth!</p>  
 <p>Even the names of the seven or eight Âdityas are not definitely known, at least not from the hymns of the Rig-veda. In II, 27, 1, we have a list of six names: Mitrá, Aryamán, Bhága, Váru<i>n</i>a, Dáksha, Á<i>m</i><i>s</i>a<i>h</i>. These with Aditi would give us seven. In VI, 50, 1, we have Áditi,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Váru<i>n</i>a, Mitrá, Agní, Aryamán, Savitár, and Bhága. In I, 89, 3, Bhága, Mitrá, Áditi, Dáksha, Aryamán, Váru<i>n</i>a, Sóma, A<i>s</i>vínâ, and Sárasvatî are invoked together with an old invocation, pû´rvayâ ni-vídâ. In the Taittirîya-âra<i>n</i>yaka, I, 13, 3, we find the following list: 1. Mitra, 2. Varu<i>n</i>a, 3. Dhâtar, 4. Aryaman, 5. A<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, 6. Bhaga, 7. Indra, 8. Vivasvat, but there, too, the eighth son is said to be Mârtâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a, or, according to the commentator, Âditya.</p>  
 <p>The character of Aditi as the mother of certain gods is also indicated by some of her epithets, such as râ´<i>g</i>a-putrâ, having kings for her sons; su-putrâ´, having good sons; ugrá-putrâ, having terrible sons:</p>  
 <p>II, 27, 7. pípartu na<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> râ´<i>g</i>a-putrâ áti dvéshâ<i>m</i>si aryamâ´ su-gébhi<i>h</i>, b<i>ri</i>hát mitrásya váru<i>n</i>asya <i>s</i>árma úpa syâma puru-vî´râ<i>h</i> árish<i>t</i>â<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May Aditi with her royal sons, may Aryaman carry us on easy roads across the hatreds; may we with many sons and without hurt obtain the great protection of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a!</p>  
 <p>III, 4, 11. barhí<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> âstâm áditi<i>h</i> su-putrâ´.</p>  
 <p>May Aditi with her excellent sons sit on our sacred pile!</p>  
 <p>VIII, 67, 11. párshi dîné gabhîré â´ úgra-putre <i>g</i>íghâ<i>m</i>sata<i>h</i>, mâ´ki<i>h</i> tokásya na<i>h</i> rishat.</p>  
 <p>Protect us, O goddess with terrible sons, from the enemy in shallow or deep water, and no one will hurt our offspring!</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi identified with other Deities.</p>  
 <p>Aditi, however, for the very reason that she was originally intended for the Infinite, for something beyond the visible world, was liable to be identified with a number of finite deities which might all be represented as resting on Aditi, as participating in Aditi, as being Aditi. Thus we read:</p>  
 <p>I, 89, 10 (final). áditi<i>h</i> dyaû<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> antáriksham áditi<i>h</i> mâtâ´ sá<i>h</i> pitâ´ sá<i>h</i> putrá<i>h</i>, ví<i>s</i>ve devâ´<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> pá<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a <i>g</i>ánâ<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> <i>g</i>âtám áditi<i>h</i> <i>g</i>áni-tvam.</p>  
 <p>Aditi is the heaven, Aditi the sky, Aditi the mother, the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>father, the son. All the gods are Aditi, the five clans, the past is Aditi, Aditi is the future.</p>  
 <p>But although Aditi may thus be said to be everything, heaven, sky, and all the gods, no passage occurs, in the Rig-veda at least, where the special meaning of heaven or earth is expressed by Aditi. In X, 63, 3, where Aditi seems to mean sky, we shall see that it ought to be taken as a masculine, either in the sense of Âditya, or as an epithet, unbounded, immortal. In I, 72, 9, we ought probably to read p<i>ri</i>thvî´ and pronounce p<i>ri</i>thuvî´, and translate 'the wide Aditi, the mother with her sons;' and not, as Benfey does, 'the Earth, the eternal mother.'</p>  
 <p>It is more difficult to determine whether in one passage Aditi has not been used in the sense of life after life, or as the name of the place whither people went after death, or of the deity presiding over that place. In a well-known hymn, supposed to have been uttered by <i>S</i>una<i>h</i><i>s</i>epa when on the point of being sacrificed by his own father, the following verse occurs:</p>  
 <p>I, 24, 1. ká<i>h</i> na<i>h</i> mahyaí áditaye púna<i>h</i> dât, pitáram <i>k</i>a d<i>ri</i><i>s</i>éyam mâtáram <i>k</i>a.</p>  
 <p>Who will give us back to the great Aditi, that I may see father and mother?</p>  
 <p>As the supposed utterer of this hymn is still among the living, Aditi can hardly be taken in the sense of earth, nor would the wish to see father and mother be intelligible in the mouth of one who is going to he sacrificed by his own father. If we discard the story of <i>S</i>una<i>h</i><i>s</i>epa, and take the hymn as uttered by any poet who craves for the protection of the gods in the presence of danger and death, then we may choose between the two meanings of earth or liberty, and translate, either, Who will give us back to the great earth? or, Who will restore us to the great Aditi, the goddess of freedom?</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi and Diti.</p>  
 <p>There is one other passage which might receive light if we could take Aditi in the sense of Hades, but I give this translation as a mere guess:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>IV, 2, 11. râyé <i>k</i>a na<i>h</i> su-apatyâ´ya deva dítim <i>k</i>a râ´sva áditim urushya.</p>  
 <p>That we may enjoy our wealth and healthy offspring, give us this life on earth, keep off the life to come! Cf. I, 152, 6.</p>  
 <p>It should be borne in mind that Diti occurs in the Rig-veda thrice only, and in one passage it should, I believe, be changed into Aditi. This passage occurs in VII, 15, 12. tvám agne vîrá-vat yá<i>s</i>a<i>h</i> devá<i>h</i> ka savitâ´ bhága<i>h</i>, díti<i>h</i> <i>k</i>a dâti vâ´ryam. Here the name of Diti is so unusual, and that of Aditi, on the contrary, so natural, that I have little doubt that the poet had put the name of Aditi; and that later reciters, not aware of the occasional license of putting two short syllables instead of one, changed it into Aditi. If we remove this passage, then Diti, in the Rig-veda at least, occurs twice only, and each time together or in contrast with Aditi; cf. V, 62, 8, page <a href="#page_243">243</a>. I have no doubt, therefore, that Professor Roth is right when he says that Diti is a being without any definite conception, a mere reflex of Aditi. We can clearly watch her first emergence into existence through what is hardly more than a play of words, whereas in the epic and Purâ<i>n</i>ic literature this Diti (like the Suras) has grown into a definite person, one of the daughters of Daksha, the wife of Ka<i>s</i>yapa, the mother of the enemies of the gods, the Daityas. Such is the growth of legend, mythology and religion!</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi in her Moral Character.</p>  
 <p>Besides the cosmical character of Aditi, which we have hitherto examined, this goddess has also assumed a very prominent moral character. Aditi, like Varu<i>n</i>a, delivers from sin. Why this should be so, we can still understand if we watch the transition which led from a purely cosmical to a moral conception of Aditi. Sin in the Veda is frequently conceived as a bond or a chain from which the repentant sinner wishes to be freed:</p>  
 <p>VII, 86, 5. áva drugdhâ´ni pítryâ s<i>ri</i><i>g</i>a na<i>h</i> áva yâ´ vayám <i>k</i>ak<i>ri</i>má tanû´bhi<i>h</i>, áva râ<i>g</i>an pa<i>s</i>u-t<i>rí</i>pam ná tâyúm s<i>ri</i><i>g</i>á vatsám ná dâ´mna<i>h</i> vásish<i>th</i>am.</p>  
 <p>Absolve us from the sins of our fathers, and from those</p>  
 <p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></a></p>  
 <p>which we have committed with our own bodies. Release Vasish<i>th</i>a, O king, like a thief who has feasted on stolen cattle; release him like a calf from the rope <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">a</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>VIII, 67, 14. té na<i>h</i> âsná<i>h</i> v<i>rí</i>kâ<i>n</i>âm â´dityâsa<i>h</i> mumó<i>k</i>ata stenám baddhám-iva adite.</p>  
 <p>O Âdityas, deliver us from the mouth of the wolves, like a bound thief, O Aditi! Cf. VIII, 67, 18.</p>  
 <p><i>S</i>una<i>h</i><i>s</i>epa, who, as we saw before, wishes to be restored to the great Aditi, is represented as bound (dita) by ropes, and in V, 2, 7, we read:</p>  
 <p><i>s</i>úna<i>h</i>-<i>s</i>épam <i>k</i>it ní-ditam sahásrât yû´pât amu<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>h</i> á<i>s</i>amish<i>t</i>a hí sá<i>h</i>, evá asmát agne ví mumugdhi pâ´<i>s</i>ân hótar (íti) <i>k</i>ikitva<i>h</i> ihá tú ni-sádya.</p>  
 <p>O Agni, thou hast released the bound <i>S</i>una<i>h</i><i>s</i>epa from the stake, for he had prayed; thus take from us, too, these ropes, O sagacious Hotar, after thou hast settled here.</p>  
 <p>Expressions like these, words like dâ´man, bond, ní-dita, bound, naturally suggested á-diti, the un-bound or unbounded, as one of those deities who could best remove the bonds of sin or misery. If we once realise this concatenation of thought and language, many passages of the Veda that seemed obscure, will become intelligible.</p>  
 <p>VII, 51, 1. âdityâ´nâm ávasâ nû´tanena sakshîmáhi <i>s</i>árma<i>n</i>â <i>s</i>ám-tamena, anâgâ<i>h</i>-tvé aditi-tvé turâ´sa<i>h</i> imám ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ám dadhatu <i>s</i>róshamâ<i>n</i>â<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May we obtain the new favour of the Âdityas, their best protection; may the quick Maruts listen and place this sacrifice in guiltlessness and Aditi-hood.</p>  
 <p>I have translated the last words literally, in order to make their meaning quite clear. Â´gas has the same meaning as the Greek ἄγος, guilt, abomination; an-âgâs-tvá, therefore, as applied to a sacrifice or to the man who makes it, means guiltlessness, purity. Aditi-tvá, Aditi-hood, has a similar meaning, it means freedom from bonds, from anything that hinders the proper performance of a religious act; it may come to mean perfection or holiness.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>Aditi having once been conceived as granting this adititvá, soon assumed a very definite moral character, and hence the following invocations:</p>  
 <p>I, 24, 15. út ut-tamám varu<i>n</i>a pâ´<i>s</i>am asmát áva adhamám ví madhyamim <i>s</i>rathaya, átha vayám âditya vraté táva ánâgasa<i>h</i> áditaye syâma.</p>  
 <p>O Varu<i>n</i>a, lift the highest rope, draw off the lowest, remove the middle; then, O Âditya, let us be in thy service free of guilt before Aditi.</p>  
 <p>V, 82, 6. ánâgasa<i>h</i> áditaye devásya savitú<i>h</i> <i>h</i> savé, ví<i>s</i>vâ vâmâ´ni dhîmahi.</p>  
 <p>May we, guiltless before Aditi, and in the keeping of the god Savitar, obtain all goods! Professor Roth here translates Aditi by freedom or security.</p>  
 <p>I, 162, 22. anâgâ<i>h</i>-tvám na<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> k<i>ri</i><i>n</i>otu.</p>  
 <p>May Aditi give us sinlessness! Cf. VII, 51, 1.</p>

 <p>Whatever, O youthful god, we have committed against thee, men as we are, whatever sin through thoughtlessness, make us guiltless of Aditi, loosen the sins on all sides, O Agni!</p>  
 <p>VII, 93, 7. sáh agne enâ´ námasâ sám-iddha<i>h</i> á<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a mitrám váru<i>n</i>am índram vo<i>k</i>e<i>h</i>, yát sîm â´ga<i>h</i> <i>k</i>ak<i>ri</i>má tát sú m<i>ri</i><i>l</i>a tát aryamâ´ áditi<i>h</i> <i>s</i>i<i>s</i>rathantu.</p>  
 <p>O Agni, thou who hast been kindled with this adoration, greet Mitra, Varu<i>n</i>a, and Indra. Whatever sin we have committed, do thou pardon it! May Aryaman, Aditi loose it!</p>  
 <p>Here the plural <i>s</i>i<i>s</i>rathantu should be observed, instead of the dual.</p>

 <p>And may she, the thoughtful Aditi, come with help to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></a></p>  
 <p>us by day; may she kindly bring happiness to us, and carry away all enemies! Cf. X, 36, 3, page <a href="#page_251">251</a>.</p>  
 <p>X, 87, 18. â´ v<i>ri</i><i>s</i><i>k</i>yantâm áditaye du<i>h</i>-évâ<i>h</i>.</p>

 <p>Aditi, Mitra, and also Varu<i>n</i>a forgive, if we have committed any sin against you. May I obtain the wide and fearless light, O Indra! May not the long darkness reach us!</p>

 <p>May we be sinless before Varu<i>n</i>a, who is gracious even to him who has committed sin, and may we follow the laws of Aditi! Protect us always with your blessings!</p>  
 <p>Lastly, Aditi, like all other gods, is represented as a giver of worldly goods, and implored to bestow them on her worshippers, or to protect them by her power:</p>  
 <p>I, 43, 2. yáthâ na<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> kárat pá<i>s</i>ve n<i>rí</i>-bhya<i>h</i> yáthâ gáve, yáthâ tokâ´ya rudríyam.</p>  
 <p>That Aditi may bring Rudra's favour to our cattle, our men, our cow, our offspring.</p>  
 <p>I, 153, 3. pîpâ´ya dhenú<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> <i>ri</i>tâ´ya <i>g</i>ánâya mitrâvaru<i>n</i>â havi<i>h</i>-dé.</p>  
 <p>Aditi, the cow, gives food to the righteous man, O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, who makes offerings to the gods. Cf. VIII, 101, 15.</p>  
 <p>I, 185, 3. anehá<i>h</i> dâtrám ádite<i>h</i> anarvám huvé.</p>  
 <p>I call for the unrivalled, uninjured gift of Aditi. Here Professor Roth again assigns to Aditi the meaning of freedom or security.</p>  
 <p>VII, 40, 2. dídesh<i>t</i>u devî´ áditi<i>h</i> rék<i>n</i>a<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May the divine Aditi assign wealth!</p>  
 <p>X, 100, 1. â´ sarvá-tâtim áditim v<i>ri</i><i>n</i>îmahe.</p>  
 <p>We implore Aditi for health and wealth.</p>  
 <p>I, 94, 15. yásmai tvám su-dravi<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> dádâ<i>s</i>a<i>h</i> anâgâ<i>h</i>-tvám</p>  
 <p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></a></p>  
 <p>adite sarvá-tâtâ, yám bhadré<i>n</i>a <i>s</i>ávasâ <i>k</i>odáyâsi pra<i>g</i>â´-vatâ râ´dhasâ té syâma.</p>  
 <p>To whom thou, possessor of good treasures, grantest guiltlessness, O Aditi, in health and wealth <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">a</font></a>, whom thou quickenest with precious strength and with riches in progeny, may we be they! Cf. II, 40, 6; IV, 25, 5; X, 11, 2.</p>  
 <p>The principal epithets of Aditi have been mentioned in the passages quoted above, and they throw no further light on the nature of the goddess. She was called devî´, goddess, again and again; another frequent epithet is anarván, uninjured, unscathed. Being invoked to grant light (VII, 82, 10), she is herself called luminous, <i>g</i>yótishmatî, I, 136, 3; and svâ´rvatî, heavenly. Being the goddess of the infinite expanse, she, even with greater right than the dawn, is called úrû<i>k</i>î, VIII, 67, 12; uruvyá<i>k</i>as, V, 46, 6; uruvra<i>g</i>â, VIII, 67, 12; and possibly p<i>ri</i>thvî´ in I, 72, 9. As supporting everything, she is called dhârayátkshiti, supporting the earth, I, 136, 3; and vi<i>s</i>vá<i>g</i>anyâ, VII, 10, 4. To her sons she owes the names of râ´<i>g</i>aputrâ, II, 27, 7; suputrâ´, III, 4, 11; and ugráputrâ, VIII, 67, 11: to her wealth that of sudravi<i>n</i>as, I, 94, 15, though others refer this epithet to Agni. There remains one name pastyẫ, IV, 55, 3; VIII, 27, 5, meaning housewife, which again indicates her character as mother of the gods.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>I have thus given all the evidence that can be collected from the Rig-veda as throwing light on the character of the goddess Aditi, and I have carefully excluded everything that rests only on the authority of the Ya<i>g</i>ur- or Atharva-vedas, or of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Âra<i>n</i>yakas, because in all they give beyond the repetitions from the Rig-veda, they seem to me to represent a later phase of thought that ought not to be mixed up with the more primitive conceptions of the Rig-veda. Not that the Rig-veda is free from what seems decidedly modern, or at all events secondary and late. But it is well to keep the great collections, as such,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></a></p>  
 <p>separate, whatever our opinions may be as to the age of their component parts.</p>  
 <p>In the Atharva-veda Aditi appears more unintelligible, more completely mythological, than in the Rig-veda. We read, for instance, Atharva-veda VII, 6, 1:</p>  
 <p>‘Aditi is the sky, Aditi is the welkin, Aditi is mother, is father, is son; all the gods are Aditi, and the five clans of men; Aditi is what was, Aditi is what will be.</p>  
 <p>‘We invoke for our protection the great mother of the well-ruling gods, the wife of <i>Ri</i>ta, the powerful, never-aging, far-spreading, the sheltering, well-guiding Aditi.’</p>  
 <p>In the Taittirîya-âra<i>n</i>yaka and similar works the mythological confusion becomes greater still. Much valuable material for an analytical study of Aditi may be found in B. and R.'s Dictionary, and in several of Dr. Muir's excellent contributions to a knowledge of Vedic theogony and mythology.</p>  
 <p align="center">Aditi as an Adjective.</p>  
 <p>But although the foregoing remarks give as complete a description of Aditi as can be gathered from the hymns of the Rig-veda, a few words have to be added on certain passages where the word áditi occurs, and where it clearly cannot mean the goddess Aditi, as a feminine, but must be taken either as the name of a corresponding masculine deity, or as an adjective in the sense of unrestrained, independent, free.</p>  
 <p>V, 59, 8. mímâtu dyaú<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> vîtáye na<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May the boundless Dyú (sky) help us to our repast!</p>  
 <p>Here Aditi must either be taken in the sense of Âditya, or better in its original sense of unbounded, as an adjective belonging to Dyú, the masculine deity of the sky.</p>  
 <p>Dyú or the sky is called áditi or unbounded in another passage, X, 63, 3:</p>  
 <p>yébhya<i>h</i> mâtâ´ mádhu-mat pínvate páya<i>h</i> pîyû´sham dyaû<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> ádri-barhâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>The gods to whom their mother yields the sweet milk, and the unbounded sky, as firm as a rock, their food.</p>  
 <p>IV, 3, 8. kathâ´ <i>s</i>árdhâya marútâm <i>ri</i>tâ´ya kathâ´ sûré b<i>ri</i>haté p<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>yámâna<i>h</i>, práti brava<i>h</i> áditaye turâ´ya.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></a></p>  
 <p>How wilt thou tell it to the host of the Maruts, how to the bright heaven, when thou art asked? How to the quick Aditi?</p>  
 <p>Here Aditi cannot be the goddess, partly on account of the masculine gender of turâ´ya, partly because she is never called quick. Aditi must here be the name of one of the Âdityas, or it may refer back to sûré b<i>ri</i>haté. It can hardly be joined, as Professor Roth proposes, with <i>s</i>árdhâya marútâm, owing to the intervening sûré b<i>ri</i>haté.</p>  
 <p>In several passages áditi, as an epithet, refers to Agni:</p>  
 <p>IV, 1, 20 (final). ví<i>s</i>veshâm áditi<i>h</i> ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>íyânâm ví<i>s</i>veshâm átithi<i>h</i> mâ´nushâ<i>n</i>âm.</p>  
 <p>He, Agni, the Aditi, or the freest, among all the gods; he the guest among all men.</p>  
 <p>The same play on the words áditi and átithi occurs again:</p>  
 <p>VII, 9, 3. ámûra<i>h</i> kaví<i>h</i> áditi<i>h</i> vivásvân su-sa<i>m</i>sát mitrá<i>h</i> átithi<i>h</i> <i>s</i>ivá<i>h</i> na<i>h</i>, <i>k</i>itrá-bhânu<i>h</i> ushásâm bhâti ágre.</p>  
 <p>The wise poet, Aditi, Vivasvat, Mitra with his good company, our welcome guest, he (Agni) with brilliant light came at the head of the dawns.</p>  
 <p>Here, though I admit that several renderings are possible, Aditi is meant as a name of Agni, to whom the whole hymn is addressed, and who, as usual, is identified with other gods, or, at all events, invoked by their names. We may translate áditi<i>h</i> vivásvân by 'the brilliant Aditi,' or 'the unchecked, the brilliant,' or by 'the boundless Vivasvat,' but on no account can we take áditi here as the female goddess. The same applies to VIII, 19, 14, where Aditi, unless we suppose the goddess brought in in the most abrupt way, must be taken as a name of Agni; while in X, 92, 14, áditim anarvá<i>n</i>am, to judge from other epithets given in the same verse, has most likely to be taken again as an appellative of Agni. In some passages it would, no doubt, be possible to take Aditi as the name of a female deity, if it were certain that no other meaning could be assigned to this word. But if we once know that Aditi was the name of a male deity also, the structure of these passages becomes far more perfect, if we take Aditi in that sense:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p>IV, 39, 3. ánâgasam tám áditi<i>h</i> k<i>ri</i><i>n</i>otu sá<i>h</i> mitré<i>n</i>a váru<i>n</i>ena sa-<i>g</i>óshâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May Aditi make him free from sin, he who is allied with Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>We have had several passages in which Aditi, the female deity, is represented as sa<i>g</i>óshâ<i>h</i> or allied with other Âdityas, but if sá<i>h</i> is the right reading here, Aditi in this verse can only be the male deity. The pronoun sá cannot refer to tám.</p>  
 <p>With regard to other passages, such as IX, 81, 5; VI, 51, 3, and even some of those translated above in which Aditi has been taken as a female goddess, the question must be left open till further evidence can be obtained. There is only one more passage which has been often discussed, and where áditi was supposed to have the meaning of earth:</p>  
 <p>VII, 18, 8. du<i>h</i>-âdhyã<i>h</i> áditim sreváyanta<i>h</i> a<i>k</i>etása<i>h</i> ví <i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>bhre párush<i>n</i>îm.</p>  
 <p>Professor Roth in one of his earliest essays translated this line, 'The evil-disposed wished to dry the earth, the fools split the Parush<i>n</i>î,' and he supposed its meaning to have been that the enemies of Sudâs swam across the Parush<i>n</i>î in order to attack Sudâs. We might accept this translation, if it could be explained how by throwing themselves into the river, the enemies made the earth dry, though even then there would remain this difficulty that, with the exception of one other doubtful passage, discussed before, áditi never means earth. We might possibly translate: 'The evil-disposed, the fools, laid dry and divided the boundless river Parush<i>n</i>î.' This would be a description of a stratagem very common in ancient warfare, viz. diverting the course of a river and laying its original bed dry by digging a new channel, and thus dividing the old river. This is also the sense accepted by Sâya<i>n</i>a, who does not say that vigraha means dividing the waves of a river, as Professor Roth renders kûlabheda, but that it means dividing or cutting through its banks. In the Dictionary Professor Roth assigns to áditi in this passage the meaning of endless, inexhaustible.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="green">p. 264</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">Kaná.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:12:5">5</a>. Nothing is more difficult in the interpretation of the Veda than to gain an accurate knowledge of the power of particles and conjunctions. The particle <i>k</i>aná, we are told, is used both affirmatively and negatively, a statement which shows better than anything else the uncertainty to which every translation of Vedic hymns is as yet exposed. It is perfectly true that in the text of the Rig-veda, as we now read it, kaná means both indeed and no. But this very fact shows that we ought to distinguish where the first collectors of the Vedic hymns have not distinguished, and that while in the former case we read <i>k</i>aná, we ought in the latter to read <i>k</i>a ná.</p>  
 <p>I begin with those passages in which <i>k</i>aná is used emphatically, though originally it may have been a double negation.</p>

 <p>Even sleep does not remove all evil.</p>  
 <p>In this passage I formerly took <i>k</i>aná as affirmative, not as negative, and therefore assigned to prayotâ´ the same meaning which Sâya<i>n</i>a assigns to it, one who brings or mixes, whereas it ought to be, as rightly seen by Roth, one who removes.</p>

 <p>I should not give thee up, wielder of the thunderbolt, even for a great price, not for a thousand, not for ten thousand (?), not for a hundred, O Indra, thou who art possessed of a hundred powers!</p>  
 <p>VIII, 51, 7. kadâ´ <i>k</i>aná starî´<i>h</i> asi.</p>

 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:12:6">6</a>. Considering the particular circumstances mentioned in this and the preceding hymn, of Indra's forsaking his companions, the Maruts, or even scorning their help, one feels strongly tempted to take tyá<i>g</i>as in its etymological sense of leaving or forsaking, and to translate, by his forsaking you, or, if he should forsake you. The poet may have meant the word to convey that idea, which no doubt would be most appropriate here; but it must be confessed, at the same time, that in other passages where tyá<i>g</i>as occurs, that meaning could hardly be ascribed to it. Strange as it may seem, no one who is acquainted with the general</p>  
 <p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="green">p. 268</font></a></p>  
 <p>train of thought in the Vedic hymns can fail to see that tyá<i>g</i>as in most passages means attack, onslaught; it may be even the instrument of an attack, a weapon. How it should come to take this meaning is indeed difficult to explain, and I do not wonder that Professor Roth in his Dictionary simply renders the word by forlornness, need, danger, or by estrangement, unkindness, malignity. But let us look at the passages. and we shall see that these abstract conceptions are quite out of place:</p>  
 <p>VIII, 47, 7. ná tám tigmám <i>k</i>aná tyá<i>g</i>a<i>h</i> ná drâsad abhí tám gurú.</p>  
 <p>No sharp blow, no heavy one, shall come near him whom you protect.</p>  
 <p>Here the two adjectives tigmá, sharp, and gurú, heavy, point to something tangible, and I feel much inclined, to take tyá<i>g</i>as in this passage as a weapon, as something that is let off with violence, rather than in the more abstract sense of onslaught.</p>  
 <p>I, 169, 1. mahá<i>h</i> <i>k</i>it asi tyá<i>g</i>asa<i>h</i> varûtâ´.</p>  
 <p>Thou art the shielder from a great attack.</p>  
 <p>IV, 43, 4. ká<i>h</i> vâm mahá<i>h</i> <i>k</i>it tyá<i>g</i>asa<i>h</i> abhî´ke urushyátam mâdhvî dasrâ na<i>h</i> ûtî´.</p>  
 <p>Who is against your great attack? Protect us with your help, O A<i>s</i>vins, ye strong ones.</p>  
 <p>Here Professor Roth seems to join mahá<i>h</i> <i>k</i>it tyá<i>g</i>asa<i>h</i> abhî´ke urushyátam, but in that case it would be impossible to construe the first words, ká<i>h</i> vâm.</p>  
 <p>I, 119, 8. ága<i>k</i><i>kh</i>atam k<i>rí</i>pamâ<i>n</i>am parâ-váti pitú<i>h</i> svásya tyá<i>g</i>asâ ní-bâdhitam.</p>  
 <p>You went from afar to the suppliant, who had been struck down by the violence of his own father.</p>  
 <p>According to Professor Roth tyá<i>g</i>as would here mean forlornness, need, or danger. But níbâdhita is a strong verb, as we may see in</p>  
 <p>VIII, 64, 2. padâ´ pa<i>n</i>î´n arâdhása<i>h</i> ní bâdhasva mahâ´n asi.</p>  
 <p>Strike the useless Pa<i>n</i>is down with thy foot, for thou art great.</p>  
 <p>X, 18, 11. út <i>s</i>va<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>asva p<i>ri</i>thivi mâ´ ní bâdhathâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Open, O earth, do not press on him (i. e. the dead, who is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p>to be buried; cf. M. M., Über Todtenbestattung, Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. ix, p. xv).</p>  
 <p>VII, 83, 6. yátra râ´<i>g</i>a-bhi<i>h</i> da<i>s</i>á-bhi<i>h</i> ní-bâdhitam prá su-dâ´sam â´vatam t<i>rí</i>tsu-bhi<i>h</i> sahá.</p>  
 <p>Where you protected Sudâs with the T<i>ri</i>tsus, when he was pressed or set upon by the ten kings.</p>  
 <p>Another passage in which tyá<i>g</i>as occurs is,</p>  
 <p>VI, 62, 10. sánutyena tyá<i>g</i>asâ mártyasya vanushyatâ´m ápi <i>s</i>îrshâ´ vav<i>ri</i>ktam.</p>  
 <p>By your covert attack turn back the heads of those even who harass the mortal.</p>  
 <p>Though this passage may seem less decisive, yet it is difficult to see how tyá<i>g</i>asâ could here, according to Professor Roth, be rendered by forlornness or danger. Something is required by which enemies can be turned back. Nor can it be doubtful that <i>s</i>îrshâ´ is governed by vav<i>ri</i>ktam, meaning turn back their heads, for the same expression occurs again in I, 33, 5. párâ <i>k</i>it <i>s</i>îrshâ´ vav<i>ri</i><i>g</i>u<i>h</i> té indra áya<i>g</i>vâna<i>h</i> yá<i>g</i>va-bhi<i>h</i> spárdhamânâ<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Professor Ben fey translates this verse by, 'Kopfüber flohn sie alle vor dir;' but it may be rendered more literally, 'These lawless people fighting with the pious turned away their heads.'</p>  
 <p>X, 144, 6. evá tát índra<i>h</i> índunâ devéshu <i>k</i>it dhârayâte máhi tyá<i>g</i>a<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Indeed through this draught Indra can hold out against that great attack even among the gods.</p>  
 <p>X, 79, 6. kím devéshu tyá<i>g</i>a<i>h</i> éna<i>h</i> <i>k</i>akartha.</p>  
 <p>What insult, what sin hast thou committed among the gods?</p>  
 <p>In these two passages the meaning of tyá<i>g</i>as as attack or assault is at least as appropriate as that proposed by Professor Roth, estrangement, malignity.</p>  
 <p>There remains one passage, VI, 3, 1. yám tvám mitré<i>n</i>a váru<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> sa-<i>g</i>óshâ<i>h</i> déva pâ´si tyá<i>g</i>asâ mártam á<i>m</i>ha<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>I confess that the construction of this verse is not clear to me, and I doubt whether it is possible to use tyá<i>g</i>asâ as a verbal noun governing an accusative. If this were possible, one might translate, 'The mortal whom thou, O God (Agni),</p>  
 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Varu<i>n</i>a, together with Mitra, protectest by pushing back evil.' More probably we should translate, 'Whom thou protectest from evil by thy might.'</p>  
 <p>If it be asked how tyá<i>g</i>as can possibly have the meaning which has been assigned to it in all the passages in which it occurs; viz. that of forcibly attacking or pushing away, we can only account for it by supposing that tya<i>g</i>, before it came to mean to leave, meant to push off, to drive away with violence (verstossen instead of verlassen). This meaning may still be perceived occasionally in the use of tya<i>g</i>; e. g. devâs tya<i>g</i>antu mâm, may the gods forsake me! i. e. may the gods drive me away! Even in the latest Sanskrit tya<i>g</i> is used with regard to an arrow that is let off. 'To expel' is expressed by nis-tya<i>g</i>. Those who believe in the production of new roots by the addition of prepositional prefixes might possibly see in tya<i>g</i> an original ati-a<i>g</i>, to drive off; but, however that may be, there is evidence enough to show that tya<i>g</i> expressed originally a more violent act of separation than it does in ordinary Sanskrit, though here, too, passages occur in which tya<i>g</i> may be translated by to throw, to fling; for instance, khe dhûli<i>m</i> yas tya<i>g</i>ed u<i>k</i><i>k</i>air mûrdhni tasyaiva sâ patet, he who throws up dust in the air, it will fall on his head. Ind. Spr. 1582.</p>  
 <p>Mu<i>k</i>, too, is used in a similar manner; for instance, va<i>g</i>ram mokshyate té mahendra<i>h</i>, Mahâbh. XIV, 263. Cf. Dhammapada, ver. 389.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:166:13:1">1</a>. <i>S</i>á<i>m</i>sa, masc., means a spell, whether for good or for evil, a blessing as well as a curse. It means a curse, or, at all events, a calumny:</p>  
 <p>I, 18, 3. mâ´ na<i>h</i> <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> árarusha<i>h</i> dhûrtí<i>h</i> prá<i>n</i>ak mártyasya.</p>

 <p>Take far away the curse of the reviler! Cf. VII, 34, 12.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">It means blessing:</div>  
 <p>II, 31, 6. utá ya<i>h</i> <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sam u<i>s</i>í<i>g</i>âm-iva <i>s</i>masi.</p>  
 <p>We desire your blessing as a blessing for suppliants.</p>  
 <p>X, 31, 1. â´ na<i>h</i> devâ´nâm úpa vetu <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May the blessing of the gods come to us!</p>  
 <p>X, 7, 1. urushyá na<i>h</i> urú-bhi<i>h</i> deva <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sai<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Protect us, god, with thy wide blessings!</p>  
 <p>II, 23, 10. mâ´ na<i>h</i> du<i>h</i>-<i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> abhi-dipsú<i>h</i> î<i>s</i>ata prá su<i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sâ<i>h</i> matí-bhi<i>h</i> târishîmahi.</p>  
 <p>Let not an evil-speaking enemy conquer us; may we, enjoying good report, increase by our. prayers!</p>  
 <p>In some passages, however, as pointed out by Grassmann, <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa may best be rendered by singer, praiser. Grassmann marks one passage only,</p>  
 <p>II, 26, 1. <i>ri</i><i>g</i>ú<i>h</i> ít <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> vanavat vanushyatá<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>May the righteous singer conquer his enemies.</p>  
 <p>He admits, however, doubtfully, the explanation of B. R., that <i>ri</i><i>g</i>ú<i>h</i> <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> may be taken as one word, meaning, 'requiring the right.' This explanation seems surrendered by B. R. in the second edition of their Dictionary, and I doubt whether <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> can mean here anything but singer. That being so, the same meaning seems more appropriate in other verses also, which I formerly translated differently, e. g.</p>  
 <p>VII, 56, 19. imé <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sam vanushyatá<i>h</i> ní pânti.</p>  
 <p>They, the Maruts, protect the singer from his enemy.</p>  
 <p>Lastly, <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sa means praise, the spell addressed by men to the gods, or prayer:</p>  
 <p>I, 33, 7. prá sunvatá<i>h</i> stuvatá<i>h</i> <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sam âva<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>Thou hast regarded the prayer of him who offers libation and praise.</p>  
 <p>X, 42, 6. yásmin vayám dadhimá <i>s</i>á<i>m</i>sam índre.</p>  
 <p>Indra in whom we place our hope. Cf. â<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>s, Westergaard, Radices Linguae Sanscritae, s. v. <i>s</i>a<i>m</i>s.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_104"></a><a href="sbe3227.htm#fr_113">233:a</a> <i>S</i>a<i>n</i>a is an old Aryan word, though its meanings differ. Hesychius and Eustathius mention κάννα as being synonymous with ψίαθος, reed. Pollux gives two forms, κάννα and κάνα, (Pollux X, 166 πτανάκα δέ ἐστι ψίαθος ἡ ἐν τοῖς ἀκατίοις ἣν καὶ κάναν καλοῦσιν. VII, 176 κάνναι δὲ τὸ ἐκ κανάβων πλέγμα) This is important, because the same difference of spelling occurs also in κάνναβις and κάναοβς or κάννβος, a model, a lay figure, which Lobeck derives from κάνναι. In Old Norse we have hanp-r, in A. S. hænep, hemp, Old High-Germ. hanaf.</p>  
 <p>The occurrence of the word <i>s</i>a<i>n</i>a is of importance as showing at how early a time the Aryans of India were acquainted with the uses and the name of hemp. Our word hemp, the A. S. hænep, the Old Norse hanp-r, are all borrowed from Latin cannabis, which, like other borrowed words, has undergone the regular changes required by Grimm's law in Low-German, and also in High-German. hanaf. The Slavonic nations seem to have borrowed their word for hemp (Lith. kanapẽ) from the Goths, the Celtic nations (Ir. canaib) from the Romans (cf. Kuhn, Beiträge, vol. ii, p. 382). The Latin cannabis is borrowed from Greek, and the Greeks, to judge from the account of Herodotus, most likely adopted the word from the Aryan Thracians and Scythians (Her. IV, 74; Pictet, Les Aryens, vol. i, p. 314). Κάννβις being a foreign word, it would be useless to attempt an explanation of the final element bis, which is added to <i>s</i>a<i>n</i>a, the Sanskrit word for hemp. It may be visa, fibre, or it may be anything else. Certain it is that the main element in the name of hemp was the same among the settlers in Northern India, and among the Thracians and Scythians through whom the Greeks first became acquainted with hemp.</p>  
 <p>The history of the word κάνναβις must be kept distinct from that of the Greek κάννα or κάνα, reed. Both spellings occur, for Pollux, X, 166, writes πτανάκα δέ ἐστι ψίαθος ἡ ἐν τοῖς ἀκατίοις ἣν καὶ κάναν καλοῦσιν, but VII, 176, κάνναι δὲ τὸ ἐκ κανάβων πλέγμα. This word κάννα may be the same as the Sanskrit <i>s</i>a<i>n</i>a, only with this difference, that it was retained as common property by Greeks and Indians before they separated, and was applied differently in later times by the one and the other.</p>
