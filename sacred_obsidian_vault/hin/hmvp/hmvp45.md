 <p>believed to be divine, and the account of her birth and appearance on earth forms an interesting episode in the Rāmāyana. The story is told to Rāma by the hermit</p>  
 <p><a name="page_461"><font size="1" color="green">p. 461</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Visvamitra, as he was travelling with Rāma and his brother Lakshman. As soon as they reach the banks of the sacred stream,</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"They bathed, as Scripture bids, and paid<br>  Oblations due to god and shade."</small></div>  
 <p>As soon as they were seated, Rāma said-</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>            "'O saint, I yearn<br>  The three-pathed Gangā's tale to learn.<br>  Thus urged, the saint recounted both<br>  The birth of Gangā and her growth:<br>  The mighty hill with metals stored,<br>  Himālaya, is, the mountains’ lord,<br>  The father of a lovely pair<br>  Of daughters, fairest of the fair.<br>  Their mother, offspring of the will<br>  Of Meru, everlasting hill,<br>  Mena, Himālaya's darling, graced<br>  With beauty of her dainty waist.<br>  Gangā was elder-born; then came<br>  The fair one known by Umā's name.<br>  Then all the gods of heaven, in need<br>  Of Gangā's help their vows to speed,<br>  To great Himālaya came and prayed<br>  The mountain king to yield the maid.<br>  He, not regardless of the weal<br>  Of the three worlds, with holy zeal<br>  His daughter to the Immortals gave—<br>  Gangā, whose waters cleanse and save,<br>  Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,<br>  Purging all sinners, to the sea.<br>  The three-pathed Gangā thus obtained,<br>  The gods their heavenly homes regained.'" <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">*</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>The sage next tells Rāma that there was a mighty King of Ayodha named Sāgara <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">†</font></a> who, being childless, </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_462"><font size="1" color="green">p. 462</font></a></p>  
 <p>and most anxious to have a son, propitiated the saint Bhrigu (or, according to other accounts, his grandson) by penances extending over a hundred years. At length the saint, pleased with Sāgara's worship, said—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"From thee, O Sāgar, blameless king,<br>  A mighty host of sons shall spring,<br>  And thou shalt win a glorious name,<br>  Which none, O chief, but thou shalt claim;<br>  One of thy queens a son shall bear,<br>  Maintainer of thy race and heir;<br>  And of the other there shall be<br>  Some sixty thousand born to thee." <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">*</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>Hearing this, the wives are anxious to know which of them is to have the one son, and which the multitude; but this the Brāhman leaves them to decide. Kesini wishes for the one; and Sumati is pleased with the prospect of having sixty thousand.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Time passed. The elder consort bare<br>  A son called Ansumān, the heir.</small></div>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_463"><font size="1" color="green">p. 463</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span>  Then Sumati, the younger, gave<br>  Birth to a gourd, O hero brave,<br>  Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,<br>  Gave sixty thousand babes to view.<br>  All these with care the nurses laid<br>  In jars of oil; and there they stayed,<br>  Till, youthful age and strength complete,<br>  Forth speeding from each dark retreat,<br>  All peers in valour, years, and might,<br>  The sixty thousand came to light." <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">*</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>After a time King Sāgara determined to make an Asvamedha, or horse sacrifice, with the object of becoming the reigning Indra, or king of the gods. Preparations for this are accordingly made, and Prince Ansumān, the son of the elder wife, is appointed by the king to follow the horse set apart for the sacrifice; for, according to the ritual, it was to be set free, and allowed to wander for a whole year wherever it would. Indra, knowing the great merit that Sāgar would obtain by this sacrifice, and fearing that he might even lose his crown,</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Veiling his form in demon guise,<br>  Came down upon the appointed day,<br>  And drove the victim horse away." <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_430"><font size="1">†</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>The officiating priest, being aware of this, cries out—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Haste, king! now let the thief be slain;<br>  Bring thou the charger back again;<br>  The sacred rite prevented thus<br>  Brings scathe and woe to all of us."</small></div>  
 <p>King Sāgara, incited by the Brāhman, urges his sons to search until they find the stolen horse:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Brave sons of mine, I know not how<br>  These demons are so mighty now;</small></div>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_464"><font size="1" color="green">p. 464</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span>  The priests began the rites so well,<br>  All sanctified with prayer and spell.<br>  If in the depths of earth he hide,<br>  Or lurk beneath the ocean's tide,<br>  Pursue, dear sons, the robber's track;<br>  Slay him and bring the charger back.<br>  The whole of this broad earth explore,<br>  Sea-garlanded from shore to shore;<br>  Yea, dig her up with might and main,<br>  Until you see the horse again." <a name="fr_431"></a><a href="#fn_431"><font size="1">*</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>The sons commence their search. Each digs a league in depth, and by this means they reach the centre of the earth; but cannot see the horse. Alarmed at their destructive work, the gods repair to Brahmā, and tell him what is happening. He cheers them with the information that Vishnu, in the form of Kapila, will protect the Earth, his bride, and that these sons of Sāgara will be consumed to ashes. The gods, encouraged by these words, repair to their home and patiently wait for deliverance.</p>  
 <p>After digging sixty thousand leagues into the earth without obtaining any tidings of the horse, the princes return to their father, asking what can be done. Sāgara commands them to dig on, and continue their search until the horse is found. At length they</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Saw Vāsudeva (Vishnu) standing there.<br>  In Kapil's form he loved to wear;<br>  And near the everlasting God<br>  The victim charger cropped the sod.<br>  They saw with joy and eager eyes<br>  The fancied robber and the prize,<br>  And on him rushed the furious band,<br>  Crying aloud, 'Stand, villain! Stand!'</small></div>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_465"><font size="1" color="green">p. 465</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>'Avaunt! avaunt!' great Kapil cried,<br>  His bosom flusht with passion's tide;<br>  Then, by his might, that proud array<br>  All scorched to heaps of ashes lay." <a name="fr_432"></a><a href="#fn_432"><font size="1">*</font></a>,</small></div>  
 <p>Hearing no news of his sons, the king became anxious, and sent his grandson Ansumān to look after them. He inquires of all he meets on the earth, and is encouraged by the information that he shall certainly bring back the stolen horse. At length he reaches the spot where his brothers were consumed, and is overwhelmed with grief at their fate. At this moment his uncle Garuda appears and consoles him, saying—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Grieve not, O hero, for their fall,<br>  Who died a death approved of all.<br>  Of mighty strength they met their fate<br>  By Kapil's hand, whom none can mate.<br>  Pour forth for them no earthly wave,<br>  A holier flood their spirits crave.<br>  If, daughter of the Lord of Snow,<br>  Gangā would turn her stream below,<br>  Her waves, that cleanse all mortal stain,<br>  Would wash their ashes pure again.<br>  Yea, when her flood, whom all revere,<br>  Rolls o’er the dust that moulders here,<br>  The sixty thousand, freed from sin,<br>  A home in Indra's heaven shall win.<br>  Go, and with ceaseless labours try<br>  To draw the goddess from the sky.<br>  Return, and with thee take the steed;<br>  So shall thy grandsire's rite succeed." <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_433"><font size="1">†</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>The prince takes the steed; the sacrifice is completed, and for 30,000 years King Sāgara was thinking how he could induce Gangā to come down from heaven. At length, not having succeeded in forming a successful plan, the monarch himself went to heaven. Ansumān</p>

 <p>reigned in his stead, who, in his turn, tried to find some means of liberating his brothers. His son Dilipa also made a similar, but equally unsuccessful, effort. It was given to Dilipa's son Bhagirath to accomplish this work. Bhagirath had no son. He, in order to obtain this boon, and also to free his kinsmen from their sad fate, practised most severe austerities, until at length Brahmā said—</p>  
 <p>"Blest monarch, of a glorious race,<br>  Thy fervent rites have won my grace.<br>  Well hast thou wrought thine awful task:<br>  Some boon in turn, O hermit, ask." <a name="fr_434"></a><a href="#fn_434"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>To which Bhagirath replies as follows—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Let Sāgar's sons receive from me<br>  Libations that they long to see.<br>  Let Gangā with her holy wave<br>  The ashes of the heroes lave,<br>  That so my kinsmen may ascend<br>  To heavenly bliss that ne’er shall end.<br>  And give, I pray, O god, a son,<br>  Nor let my house be all undone."</small></div>  
 <p>To this the god replies—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>       "As thou prayest, it shall be.<br>  Gangā, whose waves in Swarga (Heaven) flow,<br>  Is daughter of the Lord of Snow.<br>  Win Siva, that his aid be lent<br>  To hold her in her mid descent,<br>  For earth alone will never bear<br>  These torrents hurled from upper air." <a name="fr_435"></a><a href="#fn_435"><font size="1">†</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>Brahmā then re-ascended to the skies; but Bhagirath remained for a whole year—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"With arms upraised, refusing rest,<br>  While with one toe the earth he prest."</small></div>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_467"><font size="1" color="green">p. 467</font></a></p>  
 <p>Siva, pleased with this devotion, promised to sustain the shock of the descent of the waters on his head; but Gangā was not at all pleased when commanded to descend to earth:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"'He calls me,' in her wrath she cried,<br>  'And all my flood shall sweep<br>  And whirl him in its whelming tide<br>  To hell's profoundest deep.'" <a name="fr_436"></a><a href="#fn_436"><font size="1">*</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>Siva, however, was a match for the wrathful deity. He held her in the coils of his hair until her anger abated, and then she fell into the Vindu lake, from whence proceed the seven sacred streams of India. This lake is not known; and of the seven streams mentioned, two only are familiar to geographers, the Ganges and the Indus. One branch of this stream followed Bhagirath wherever he went. On the way the waters flooded the sacrificial flame of Jahnu, a saint. In his anger he drank up its waters, and Bhagirath's work seemed to be fruitless. But at the intercession of the king and Brahmā, the saint allowed the waters to flow from his ears. From this fact one of the many names of Gangā is Jāhnavi, or daughter of Jahnu. At length Bhagirath reached the ocean, and descending to the depths where Sāgara's sons were lying, Gangā followed until her waters touched the ashes, when—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Soon as the flood their dust bedewed,<br>  Their spirits gained beatitude,<br>  And all in heavenly bodies dressed<br>  Rose to the skies’ eternal rest." <a name="fr_437"></a><a href="#fn_437"><font size="1">†</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>As a reward for his meritorious work, Brahmā' said to him—</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Long as the ocean's flood shall stand<br>  Upon the border of the land,</small></div>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_468"><font size="1" color="green">p. 468</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>So long shall Sāgar's sons remain,<br>  And, god-like, rank in heaven retain.<br>  Gangā thine eldest child shall be,<br>  Called from thy name Bhagirathi." <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="#fn_438"><font size="1">*</font></a></small></div>  
 <p>As a consequence of faith in this legend, one of the most frequented places of pilgrimage in India is Sāgar Island, the place where the river Ganges and ocean meet.</p>  
 <p>In addition to the Ganges, there are many other rivers regarded as sacred by the Hindus; the worship of these, and bathing in them, being productive of almost as great blessings as are to be obtained from Gangā herself. Some of these are considered as males and some as females. The following is not a complete list, but it contains the names of the rivers most generally worshipped.</p>  
 <p>Male rivers:—The Sona and the Brahmaputra.</p>  
 <p>Female rivers:—The Godāvarī, the Kāveri, the Atreyī, the Karaloyā, the Bahudā, the Gomati, the Sarayu, the Gandakī, the Varahī, the Charmanwatī, the Shatadru, the Vipāshā, the Goutamī, the Karmanāshā, the Airāvatī, the Chandrabhāgā, the Vitastā, the Sindhu, the Krishnā, the Vetravatī, the Bhairavā. <a name="fr_439"></a><a href="#fn_439"><font size="1">†</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_427"></a><a href="hmvp45.htm#fr_427">461:†</a> Sāgara's birth was supernatural. His father Bāhu, King of Ayodha, was expelled from his kingdom. The mother of Sāgara <a name="page_462"><font size="1" color="green">p. 462</font></a> accompanied her husband to the forest, but, owing to a poisonous drug having been given her by a rival wife, she could not bring forth her son, with whom she had been pregnant for seven years. When her husband died, she wished to be burned with his body; but this was prevented by a sage named Aurva, who assured her that her son would yet be born, and grow up to be a mighty king. When he was born, Aurva gave him the name Sāgara (<i>sa</i>, with, and <i>gara</i>, poison). Aurva himself was also born in an extraordinary manner. A king named Kritavirya was very liberal to the Bhrigus, and through his liberality they became rich. His descendants being poor, they asked help of the Bhrigus. On this being refused them, they made an onslaught on the Brāhmans of this family, slaying all they could find, even to children in the womb. One woman concealed her unborn child in her thigh. The Kshattriyas, hearing of this, tried to slay him, but he issued from his mother's thigh with such lustre that he blinded his persecutors. And because he was born from the thigh (<i>uru</i>) of his mother, he was called Aurva.</p>
