 <p>2. <a name="fr_491"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">2</font></a> After (the boy) has taken off his old (garment), (the teacher) makes him put on a (new) garment that has not yet been washed, with (the verses),</p>  
 <p>'The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread out, and who drew out the skirts on both sides, may those goddesses clothe thee with long life. Blessed with life put on this garment.</p>  
 <p>'Dress him; through (this) garment make him reach a hundred (years) of age; extend his life. B<i>ri</i>haspati has given this garment to king Soma that he may put it on.</p>  
 <p>'Mayst thou live to old age; put on the garment! Be a protector of the human tribes against imprecation. Live a hundred years, full of vigour; clothe thyself in the increase of wealth.'</p>

 <p>'Thou hast put on this garment for the sake of welfare; thou hast become a protector of thy friends against imprecation. Live a hundred long years; a noble man, blessed with life, mayst thou distribute wealth.'</p>  
 <p>4. <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">4</font></a> He then winds the girdle three times from left to right round (the boy, so that it covers) his navel. (He does so only) twice, according to some (teachers). (It is done) with (the verse),</p>

 <p>'Here she has come to us who drives away sin, purifying our guard and our protection, bringing us strength by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, the sister of the gods, this blessed girdle.'</p>  
 <p>5. On the north side of the navel he makes a threefold knot (in the girdle) and draws that to the south side of the navel.</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_494"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">6</font></a> He then arranges for him the skin (of an antelope, &amp;c., see Sûtra 7) as an outer garment, with (the Mantras),</p>  
 <p>'The firm, strong eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, powerful and flaming, a chaste, mobile vesture, this skin put on, a valiant (man), N.N.!</p>

 <p><a name="fn_496"></a><a href="sbe30047.htm#fr_496">148:8</a> In the first hemistich I propose to correct pari dadhmasi into pari dadmasi. The verse seems to be an adaptation of a Mantra which contained a form of the verb pari-dhâ (comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 24, 2); thus the reading pari . . . dadhmasi found in the MSS. may be easily accounted for. The second hemistich is very corrupt, but the Atharva-veda (loc. cit.: yathaina<i>m</i> <i>g</i>arase nayât) shows at least the general sense.</p>
