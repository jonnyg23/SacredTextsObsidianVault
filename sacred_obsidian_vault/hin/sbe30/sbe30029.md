 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)</i>, by Hermann Oldenberg, [1892], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">KÂ<i>N</i><i>D</i>IKÂ 7.</h3>  
 <p>1. <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">1</font></a> Now (follows) the <i>S</i>rava<i>n</i>â ceremony.</p>  
 <p>2. It has to be performed on the full-moon day (of the month <i>S</i>râva<i>n</i>a).</p>  
 <p>3. Having besmeared (a surface) to the east of the house (with cow-dung), they carry forward (to that place) fire taken from the (sacred) domestic fire.</p>  
 <p>4. He besmears four spots to the four sides (of the fire),</p>  
 <p>5. Towards the (four) directions,</p>  
 <p>6. (To the extent) of more than one prakrama (i.e. step).</p>  
 <p>7. He puts a dish on the fire and fries (in that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>dish) one handful of barley-grains, without burning them.</p>  
 <p>8. <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">8</font></a> To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks (the grains), separating (the husked and the unhusked grains?).</p>  
 <p>9. After he has carefully ground them to flour, and has thrown (that) into a wooden cup (<i>k</i>amasa), and covered it with a winnowing-basket, he puts it up (in the house).</p>  
 <p>10. Between (the besmeared surface) towards the south, and that towards the east (there should be) a passage.</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">11</font></a> After sunset he takes the wooden cup, (the spoon called) Darvi, and the winnowing-basket, and goes to (the fire) which has been carried forward (Sûtra 3).</p>  
 <p>12. He throws the flour into the winnowing-basket and fills the wooden cup with water.</p>  
 <p>13. He takes once a quantity of flour with the Darvi spoon, pours out water on the besmeared place to the east (of the fire), and offers (there) a Bali with (the words), 'O king of Serpents, dwelling towards the east, this is thy Bali!' (MB. II, 1, 1).</p>  
 <p>14. He pours the rest of the water over (that Bali, taking care) that it does not carry away the Bali.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>15. <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">15</font></a> Turning round from right to left, he besprinkles the wooden cup and the Darvi spoon, warms them, and (repeats the offering of a Bali) in the same way towards the south, towards the west, and towards the north, as the Mantra (MB. II, I, 1. 2) runs, without turning away (between the single Bali-offerings).</p>  
 <p>16. <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">16</font></a> After he has thrown the remnants (of flour) out of the basket into the fire, he goes to that fire which has not been carried forward.</p>  
 <p>17. <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">17</font></a> To the west of that fire he touches the earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Mantra, 'Adoration to the Earths'(MB. II, 1, 3).</p>  
 <p>18. In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).</p>  
 <p>19. Of that (milk-rice) he should make oblations with (the formulas), 'To <i>S</i>rava<i>n</i>a, to Vish<i>n</i>u, to Agni, to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, to the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>20. <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">20</font></a> The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.</p>  
 <p>21. To the north of the fire he places a bunch of Darbha grass with roots, and murmurs the Mantra, 'Soma the king' (ibid. 4), and, 'The agreement which you have made' (ibid. 5).</p>

 <p>22. On the following day he has flour of fried barley-grains prepared, and in a new pot, covering (it with another pot), he puts it up (in his house).</p>  
 <p>23. <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">23</font></a> (Of that flour) he should silently offer Balis day by day in the evening, before the sacrifice, until the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î day.</p>
