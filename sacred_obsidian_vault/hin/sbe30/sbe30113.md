 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)</i>, by Hermann Oldenberg, [1892], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">PA<i>T</i>ALA 7, SECTION 20.</h3>  
 <p>1. <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">1</font></a> With the next (verse, II, 18, 10) he has the Î<i>s</i>âna led to the southern (hut),</p>  
 <p>2. With worldly words the 'bountiful goddess' to the northern (hut),</p>  
 <p>3. To the middle (between the two huts) the 'conqueror.'</p>  
 <p>4. He gives them water to drink in the same order in which they have been led (to their places), takes three portions of boiled rice (from the Sthâlîpâka prepared for Î<i>s</i>âna), takes (these portions of rice) to the fire, makes (the three gods) touch them with the next (formulas, II, 18, II-13), sacrifices of these portions, to each god of the portion which belongs to him, with the next (formulas, II, 18, 14-30), cuts off (Avadânas) from all (portions), and sacrifices with the next Ya<i>g</i>us (II, 18, 31) to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.</p>  
 <p>5. Having worshipped (the god Î<i>s</i>âna) with the next Ya<i>g</i>us (II, 18, 32), he distributes with the next (formulas, II, 18, 33-39) leaves together with portions of boiled rice, two (leaves) with each (Ya<i>g</i>us), then ten to the divine hosts (II, 18, 40), and ten to the (divine hosts) that follow (and are referred to in the next Ya<i>g</i>us, II, 18, 41).</p>

 <p>6. With the next (formulas, II, 18, 42-45) he does the same as before (i.e. he distributes two leaves with each Mantra).</p>  
 <p>7. Having formed a lump of boiled rice, he puts it into a basket of leaves, and with the next Ya<i>g</i>us (II, 18, 46) hangs it up on a tree.</p>  
 <p>8. Here he should murmur the Rudra texts (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 5),</p>  
 <p>9. Or the first and last (Anuvâka).</p>  
 <p>10. He places his cows around the fire so that the smoke (of the sacrifice) may reach them.</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">11</font></a> With his firmly shut fist full of Darbha grass he besprinkles (them) with scents; the bull first.</p>  
 <p>12. He should perform a sacrifice to Kshetrapati, without a fire, in the path used by his cows.</p>  
 <p>13. He has (the Kshetrapati) led to his place in the same way as the Î<i>s</i>âna (see above, Sûtra 1).</p>  
 <p>14. He puts (portions of boiled rice) into four or seven leaves, naming (the god).</p>  
 <p>15. <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">15</font></a> Let him sacrifice quickly; the god has a strong digestion (?).</p>  
 <p>16. With the next two (verses, II, 18, 47. 48) he does worship (to Kshetrapati).</p>  
 <p>17. The Sthâlîpâka (belonging to Î<i>s</i>âna) he gives to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as to eat;</p>  
 <p>18. That belonging to Kshetrapati his uterine relations eat,</p>  
 <p>19. Or as is the custom in their family.</p>
