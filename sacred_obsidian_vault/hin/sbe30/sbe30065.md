 <p>2. Having put (the fire into a vessel) they carry that (nuptial) fire behind (the newly-married couple).</p>

 <p>5. Besides, if (the fire) goes out, the wife or the husband should fast.</p>  
 <p>6. When (the bridegroom with his bride) has come to his house, he says to her, 'Cross (the threshold) with thy right foot first; do not stand on the threshold.'</p>  
 <p>7. In the hall, in its easterly part, he puts down the fire and puts wood on it.</p>  
 <p>8. To the west of the fire he spreads out a red bull's skin with the neck to the east, with the hair outside.</p>

 <p>10. They sit silently until the stars appear.</p>  
 <p>11. When the stars have appeared, he goes forth from the house (with his wife) in an easterly or northerly direction, and worships the quarters (of the horizon) with (the hemistich), 'Ye goddesses, ye six wide ones' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 7, 14, 2).</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">12</font></a> (He worships) the stars with (the Pâda), 'May we not be deprived of our offspring;'</p>  
 <p>13. The moon with (the Pâda), 'May we not get into the power of him who hates us, O king Soma!</p>  
 <p>14. He worships the seven <i>Ri</i>shis (ursa major) with (the verse), 'The seven <i>Ri</i>shis who have led to firmness she, Arundhatî, who stands first among the six K<i>ri</i>ttikâs (pleiads):may she, the eighth one, who leads the conjunction of the (moon with the) six K<i>ri</i>ttikâs, the first (among conjunctions) shine upon us!' Then he worships the polar star with (the formula), 'Firm dwelling, firm origin. The firm one art thou, standing on the side of firmness. Thou art the pillar of the stars; thus protect me against my adversary.</p>  
 <p>Adoration be to the Brahman, to the firm, immovable one! Adoration be to the Brahman's son, Pra<i>g</i>âpati! Adoration to the Brahman's children,</p>

 <p>to the thirty-three gods! Adoration to the Brahman's children and grandchildren, to the Aṅgiras!</p>  
 <p>He who knows thee (the polar star) as the firm, immovable Brahman with its children and with its grandchildren, with such a man children and grandchildren will firmly dwell, servants and pupils, garments and woollen blankets, bronze and gold, wives and kings, food, safety, long life, glory, renown, splendour, strength, holy lustre, and the enjoyment of food. May all these things firmly and immovably dwell with me!'</p>
