 <p>1. <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">1</font></a> For Vai<i>s</i>ampâyana, Paliṅgu, Tittira [sic], Ukha, Âtreya, the author of the Pada-text, Kau<i>n</i><i>d</i>inya the author of the commentary, for the authors of the Sûtras, for Satyâshâ<i>dh</i>a (Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>s</i>in), for the handers-down of the text, for the teachers, the <i>Ri</i>shis, the hermits dwelling in the woods, the chaste ones, for those who have only one wife.</p>  
 <p>2. They prepare (seats) each for his own fathers and maternal ancestors.</p>  
 <p>3. With (the words), 'For N.N. I prepare (a seat); for N.N. I prepare (a seat)' (he prepares) a seat.</p>  
 <p>4. With (the words), 'I satiate N.N.; I satiate N.N.' (he makes offerings of) water.</p>  
 <p>5. With (the words), 'Adoration to N: N.! Adoration to N.N.!' (he offers) perfumes, flowers, incense, and lamps.</p>  
 <p>6. With (the words), 'To N.N. svâhâ! To N.N. svâhâ!' (he offers) food.</p>  
 <p>7. With (the words), 'I satiate N.N.; I satiate N.N.' (he offers) water with fruits in it.</p>  
 <p>8. Having worshipped them with (the words), 'Adoration to N.N.! Adoration to N.N.!'</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_709"></a><a href="#fn_709"><font size="1">9</font></a> Having put wood on the fire to the west of the surface (on which he had performed the Tarpa<i>n</i>a),</p>

 <p>and having performed the rites down to the Vyâh<i>ri</i>ti oblations (&amp;c., as above, chap. 18, 3-7).</p>  
 <p>10. With the two (verses), 'From joint to joint,' 'Thou who with a hundred' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 2, 9, 2) they plant Dûrvâ grass at the shore of the water.</p>  
 <p>11. They stir up waves in the water and run a race in an easterly or northerly direction until they lose their breath.</p>  
 <p>12. When they have returned (from that race? or when they have returned from the whole ceremony to the village?) they offer cakes, coarsely ground grain, and boiled rice to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_710"><font size="1">13</font></a> The same (rites are repeated) when they have finished the study of the whole Veda, with the exception of the planting of Dûrvâ grass, of (stirring up) the water, and of the race.</p>  
 <p>14. Thus they satiate daily (after the Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a) the gods, the <i>Ri</i>shis, and the Fathers with water; they satiate them with water.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_708"></a><a href="sbe30092.htm#fr_708">245:1</a> 20, 1. The Kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ânukrama of the Âtreyî-<i>s</i>âkhâ, which has been printed by Professor Weber in his edition of the Taittirîya Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, vol. ii, p. 356, shows that the dative Paliṅgave ought to be corrected to Paiṅgaye. The 'v<i>ri</i>ttikâra' is there called not Kau<i>n</i><i>d</i>inya, but Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>ina.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_709"></a><a href="sbe30092.htm#fr_709">245:9</a> There is only one difference between the text of this Sutra <a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a> and that of chap. 18, 3-7: instead of hutvâ trîn âdito<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nuvâkân adhîyate (18, 4) we read here, hutvâ prathamenânuvâkenâdhîyate, which I believe must be translated, 'Having sacrificed with the first Anuvâka, they recite (that Anuvâka).' Mât<i>ri</i>datta says, hutvâ prathamottamânuvâkam adhîyate.</p>
