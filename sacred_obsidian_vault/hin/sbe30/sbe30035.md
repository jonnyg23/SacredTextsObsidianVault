 <p>5. He then should place pâtra vessels of water near the pits.</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">6</font></a> Seizing, again with his left hand, (the first) vessel, he should pour it out from right to left on the Darbha grass in the eastern pit, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.!

 <p>11. After he has put down (the three Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as), he murmurs, 'Here, O Fathers, enjoy yourselves; show your manly vigour each for his part' (MB. II, 3, 6).</p>  
 <p>12. He should turn away, (should hold his breath,) and turning back before he emits his breath, he should murmur, 'The Fathers have enjoyed themselves; they have shown their manly vigour each for his part' (ibid. 7).</p>  
 <p>13. Seizing, again with his left hand, a Darbha blade (anointed with collyrium; chap. 2, 30), he should put it down, from right to left, on the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a in the eastern pit, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! This collyrium is thine, and is that of those who follow thee here, and of those whom thou followest. To thee Svadhâ!'</p>

Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of vital breath!' (MB. II, 3, 8);</p>  
 <p>19. On the middle (pit), turning the inside of the left hand upwards, with (the formula), 'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of terror! Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of sap!' (MB., loc. cit.);</p>  
 <p>20. On the last (pit), turning the inside of the right hand upwards, with (the formula), 'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of comfort! Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of wrath!' (MB. II, 3, 9).</p>  
 <p>21. Then joining his hands he murmurs, 'Adoration to you, O Fathers! O Fathers! Adoration to you!' (MB., loc. cit.).</p>

 <p>26. Seizing, again with his left hand, the vessel of water (Sûtra 5), he should sprinkle (water) round the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as from right to left, with (the verse), 'Bringing sap' (MB. II, 3, 13).</p>  
 <p>27. The middle Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a (offered to the grandfather) the wife (of the sacrificer) should eat, if she is desirous of a son, with (the verse), 'Give fruit to the womb, O Fathers' (MB. II, 3, 14).</p>
