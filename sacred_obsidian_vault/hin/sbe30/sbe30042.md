 <p><a name="fn_444"></a><a href="sbe30042.htm#fr_444">129:1</a> 10, 1 seq. The Arghya reception; Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 4, 5 seq.; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha II, 62-65. The first words of the Mantra quoted in Sûtra 1 are corrupt. The Mantra is evidently an adaptation of the well-known verse addressed to the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î (Gobhila III, 9, 9; Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a II, 2, 1), or to the Ash<i>t</i>akâ (Pâraskara III, 3, 5, 8): prathamâ ha vyuvâsa, &amp;c. The first word arha<i>n</i>â ('duly'), containing an allusion to the occasion of the Arghya ceremony, to which this Mantra is adapted, seems to be quite right; the third word may be, as Dr. Knauer conjectures, uvâsa ('she has dwelt,' or perhaps rather 'she has shone'). For the second word I am not able to suggest a correction.</p>
