 <p>2. Now (follows) the way for appeasing anger.</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">3</font></a> He addresses the angry person with (the verses), 'The power of wrath that dwells here on thy forehead, destroying thy enemy (?), may the chaste, wise gods take that away.</p>  
 <p>'If thou shootest, as it were, the thought dwelling in thy face, upwards to thy forehead, I loosen the anger of thy heart like the bow-string of an archer.</p>  
 <p>'Day, heaven, and earth: we appease thy anger, as the womb of a she-mule (cannot conceive).'</p>  
 <p>4. Now (follows) the way for obtaining the victory in disputes.</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">5</font></a> He puts wood on the fire at night-time in an inner apartment, performs the rites down to the Vyâh<i>ri</i>ti oblations, and sacrifices small grains mixed with A ya, with (the verse), 'Tongueless one, thou who art without a tongue!

Out of every limb I take thy speech. Wheresoever thy speech dwells, thence I take it away.</p>

 <p>'Rudra with the dark hair-lock! Hero! At every contest strike down this my adversary, as a tree (is struck down) by a thunderbolt.</p>  
 <p>'Be defeated, be conquered, when thou speakest. Sink down under the earth, when thou speakest, struck down by me irresistibly (?) with the hammer of . . . (?). That is true what I speak. Fall down, inferior to me, N.N.!'</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="sbe30059.htm#fn_588"><font size="1">7</font></a> He touches the assembly-hall (in which the contest is going on), and murmurs, 'The golden-armed, blessed (goddess), whose eyes are not faint, who is decked with ornaments, seated in the midst of the gods, has spoken for my good. Svâhâ!'</p>
