 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_283">77:1</a> 3, 1 seq. The Upâkara<i>n</i>a ceremony; Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 2, 16 seq. Regarding the different terms for this ceremony, comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 5, 2; Â<i>s</i>valâyana III, 5, 3; Pâraskara II, 10, 2. Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>s</i>in says: <i>s</i>rava<i>n</i>âpaksha oshadhîshu <i>g</i>âtâsu hastena paur<i>n</i>amâsyâ<i>m</i> vâdhyâyopâkarma.It seems impossible to me to adopt an explanation of this Sûtra, which gives to praush<i>th</i>apadî another meaning than that based on the constant use of these feminines derived from the names of Nakshatras, i.e. the day of the full moon which falls under such or such a Nakshatra. Hasten a, therefore, necessarily refers to another day besides the Praush<i>th</i>apadî, on which the Upâkara<i>n</i>a may be celebrated. Perhaps we may conjecture, praush<i>th</i>apadî<i>m</i> hastena vopâkara<i>n</i>am.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_284"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_284">77:2</a> Comp. above, II, 10, 39.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_285"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_285">78:5</a> The <i>Kh</i>andas book is the first Sâmavedâr<i>k</i>ika in which the verses are arranged according to their metre.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_286"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_286">78:6</a> It is not quite clear from the text, in what connection the rites described in Sûtras 6-8 stand with those treated of in the preceding Sûtras. The expression yathârtham used in Sûtra 5 ('yathârtham iti karma<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> parisamâptir u<i>k</i>yate,' Comm.; comp. above, I, 3, 12 note) clearly indicates the close of the ceremony; on the other hand the comparison of Pâraskara II, 10, 15 seq., <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 5, 10 seq., Â<i>s</i>valâyana III, 5, 10, seems to show that the acts stated in Sûtras 6-8 form part of the ceremony described before.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_287">78:8</a> I do not try to translate this very obscure Sûtra according to the commentary, in which khâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika is explained as 'the number (of pupils).' Perhaps the word is a misspelling for ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâ or the like, and means sections of the texts. Comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 2, 23. The construction (â<i>k</i>ântodakâ<i>h</i> . . . kârayet) is quite irregular.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_288">78:9</a> I.e. they do not continue their study. The day sacred to Savit<i>ri</i> is the day under the constellation of Hasta, mentioned in Sûtra 1, for Savit<i>ri</i> is the presiding deity over that Nakshatra (comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 26, 11).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_289">78:10</a> Comp. the note on Sûtra 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_290"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_290">79:12</a> Regarding the Tarpa<i>n</i>a ceremony comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana 1V, 9, s note. From the word 'and' the commentator concludes that the libations are offered not only to the Â<i>k</i>âryas, but also to the <i>Ri</i>shis, &amp;c. (Sûtra 15).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_291"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_291">79:13</a> Comp. Gautama XVI, 1; Vasish<i>th</i>a XIII, 1; Âpastamba I, 9, 1, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_292"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_292">79:14</a> Âpastamba I, 9, 2, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_293"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_293">79:15</a> This is a description of the Utsarga ceremony; comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 6, 6; Â<i>s</i>valâyana III, 5, 21-23; Pâraskara II, 12.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_294"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_294">79:16</a> The most natural way of interpreting the text would be, in my opinion, to assume that the 'second Upâkara<i>n</i>a' (pratyupâkara<i>n</i>a) is identical with the Utsarga. The second Upâkara<i>n</i>a thus would in the same time conclude the first term for studying the <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a> Veda, and open a second term. The distinction of two such periods, which may be called two terms, is frequently met with in other texts, for instance, in Vasish<i>th</i>a XIII, 5-7 (S.B.E. XIV, 63); Manu IV, 98. According to the commentary, on the other hand, the second Upâkara<i>n</i>a is performed at the beginning of the northerly course of the sun (comp. Sûtras 10-12); it is stated that after that ceremony the Uttara (i.e. the Uttarâr<i>k</i>ika?) and the Rahasya texts are studied. It deserves to be noticed that Manu (IV, 96) prescribes the performing of the Utsarga either under the Nakshatra Pushya (i.e. Tishya), or on the first day of the bright fortnight of Mâgha, which is considered as coinciding, at least approximately, with the beginning of the northerly course of the sun.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_295"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_295">80:18</a> Comp. Manu IV, 105.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_296"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_296">80:22</a> These are the days of the ancient Vedic <i>k</i>âturmâsya sacrifices.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_297"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_297">81:29</a> The definition of a <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>a, or instructed person, is given in Baudhâyana I, 1, 6 (S.B.E. XIV, 143).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_299"></a><a href="sbe30025.htm#fr_299">81:34</a> <i>K</i>itya means <i>K</i>itya agni, the piled-up fire-altar, the construction of which is treated of, for instance, in the <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a VI-X. Prof. Weber has devoted to the rites connected with the <i>k</i>itya agni a very detailed paper, Indische Studien, XIII, 217 seq. That <i>k</i>itya does not mean here anything different from <i>k</i>itya agni is shown by the Mânava-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3: yadi . . . akshi vâ spandet kar<i>n</i>o vâ kro<i>s</i>ed agni<i>m</i> vâ <i>k</i>ityam ârohet <i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>âna<i>m</i> vâ ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ed yûpa<i>m</i> vopasp<i>ri</i><i>s</i>et, &amp;c.</p>
