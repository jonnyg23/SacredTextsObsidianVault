 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>When it is said that Soma is bought for a goat, gold, &amp;c., that it is re-bought from the priests by means of a fee, or that at the time of the Dîkshâ, the purification and initiation of a sacrificer, clothes, gold, grain, &amp;c., should be given, these are cases not of aut-aut but of et-et.</p>  
 <p>The Soma-plant, which is supposed to be bought from northern barbarians, is botanically described in an Âyur-vedic extract, quoted in the Dhûrtasvâmi-bhâshya<i>t</i>îkâ (MS. E.I.H. 531, p. 3<sup>b</sup>), as</p>

 <p>This passage, quoted from some Âyur-vedic text, is still the only one which gives an approximative description of the Soma-plant. Dr. Hooker says that the predicates 'sour and milky' point to Sarcostemma, but the question is not decided yet. For further information see George Watt, The Soma Plant, an extract from the third volume of the Dictionary of Economic Products of India, and Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, pp. 14 seq.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_63_c">63<sup>c</sup></a></font></span></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>Amâ-vâsyâ is the dwelling together, i.e. the conjunction, of sun and moon, an astronomical expression which was adopted in the common language of the people at a very early time. It does not occur, however, in the <i>Ri</i>g-veda. In our Sûtra amâvâsyâ is used in the sense both of new moon and new-moon sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_64">64</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">SÛTRA LXIV.</h3>  
 <p>And let a man sacrifice with the Paur<i>n</i>amâsyâ sacrifice at the time of the Paur<i>n</i>amâsî, full moon, thus it is said.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>Here the full moon is called paur<i>n</i>amâsî, the sacrifice paur<i>n</i>amâsyâ. Satyavrata joins the two Sûtras in one, and leaves out ya<i>g</i>eteti, which may have belonged to the commentary.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">SÛTRA LXV.</h3>  
 <p>Let a man observe that full-moon day as a day of abstinence on which the moon comes out full before.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65_c">65<sup>c</sup></a></font></span></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>The full moon (paur<i>n</i>amâsî) is really the very moment on which the moon is full and therefore begins to decrease. That moment on which sun and moon are, as the Hindus said, at the greatest distance from each other, is called the parva-sandhi, the juncture of the two phases of the moon. Thus the name of paur<i>n</i>amâsî belongs to the last day of the one and to the first day (pratipad) of the other phase, and both days might be called paur<i>n</i>amâsî. If therefore the moon is full on the afternoon, the evening, or the twilight of one day, that day should be observed as a fast-day, and the next day should be the day of sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>The meaning of purastâd, which I have translated by before, is doubtful. One commentator says it has no object, and should be dropped, purastâd ity etat padam asmin sûtra idânîm anvaya<i>m</i> na labhate prayo<i>g</i>anâbhâvât. Purastâd, before, may, however, mean before the second day, on which the real sacrifice takes place, and the commentator mentions purastât-paur<i>n</i>amâsî as a name of the <i>k</i>aturda<i>s</i>î-yuktâ, i.e. the full moon beginning on the fourteenth day. The same kind of full moon is also called Anumati, Pûrvâ-paur<i>n</i>amâsî, and Sandhyâ-paur<i>n</i>amâsî, while that which takes place on the pratipad, the first day of the lunar phase, is called Râkâ, Uttarâ-paur<i>n</i>amâsî, Astamitoditâ, and <i>S</i>va<i>h</i>pûritâ.</p>  
 <p>Corresponding to these two kinds of Paur<i>n</i>amâsî there are also two kinds of Amâvâsyâ. That which falls on the fourteenth day is called Pûrvâ-amâvâsyâ, or Sinîvâlî, the ἕνη καὶ νέα; that which falls on the pratipad, the first day of the new phase, is called Kuhû, Uttarâ-amâvâsyâ. <i>S</i>voyuktâ. See also Ait.-Brâhm. II, 4; Nir. XI, 31-32.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>In that case the day before should be observed as a day of abstinence. The real full moon would then take place in the fore-noon, pûrvâh<i>n</i>e, of the next day. Abstinence, upavâsa, consists in abstaining from meat and from maithuna, in shaving beard and head, cutting the nails, and, what seems a curious provision, in speaking the truth. See Kâty.-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtras II, I, 8-12.</p>

 <p>The Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins mention a third, the Kharvikâ full moon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_67_c">67<sup>c</sup></a></font></span></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>Kharva means small. If one divides the night into twelve parts, and if in a portion of the twelfth part the greatest distance of sun and moon takes place, then the full moon is called kharvikâ, also kshî<i>n</i>â. Or, if on the sixteenth day, the full moon takes place before noon, that also is called kharvikâ paur<i>n</i>amâsî. In that case abstinence or fasting takes place on the sixteenth day (tasyâ<i>m</i> sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>e<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>hany upavâsa<i>h</i>). Both paur<i>n</i>amâsîs are also called sadyaskâlâ.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>This Sûtra has to be connected with Sûtra LXV. The abstinence takes place on the day, if the actual new moon, the nearest approach of sun and moon, falls on the afternoon, at night, or at twilight. And this new moon, the junction of the fifteenth day and the pratipad, is called Kuhû. We should read amâvâsyâm.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>In that case, when the real new moon takes place in the fore-noon, abstinence is observed on the day before, and the new moon is called Sinîvâlî. Satyavrata reads <i>s</i>vo yukta iti vâ instead of <i>s</i>vo na drash<i>t</i>âra iti vâ. Drash<i>t</i>âra<i>h</i> should be explained as îkshitâra<i>h</i>, 'they will not see it.' There is much difference of opinion on this subject among different <i>S</i>âkhâs, Sûtrakâras, and their commentators; see Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. III, 4, 9; Weber, Ind. Stud., V, p. 228.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
 <p>This Sûtra is variously explained: Satyavrata's commentary, which I have followed in the translation, explains pradhânâni as âgneyâdîni, i.e. the chief parts of such a sacrifice as the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>n</i>amâsa; vidhânâni as aṅgâni. Kapardisvâmin's commentary also explains vidhânâni as the aṅgâni of a pradhânam; pradhânam as pûr<i>n</i>amâsa, &amp;c. It would therefore mean that such ceremonies as the âgneya (ash<i>t</i>a-kapâla), âgnîshomîya (ekâda<i>s</i>a-kapâla), and upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u, which form the pradhânas of the Dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>n</i>amâsa, retain throughout the same vidhânas or aṅgas as prescribed in one Prakara<i>n</i>a, viz. the Dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>n</i>amâsa. The Aṅgas or members are all the things used for sacrificial purposes, milk, butter, grains, animals, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71">71</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">SÛTRA LXXI.</h3>

 <p>Here the rules (vidhis) are again the Aṅgas, which belong to a sacrifice, as the members belong to the body.</p>

 <p>Nirde<i>s</i>a is explained as vi<i>s</i>esha-<i>s</i>ruti, and the meaning is supposed to be that unless such a special rule is given, the Aṅgas of all the Pradhâna acts remain the same, as, for instance, the Paryagnikara<i>n</i>a, the Prayâ<i>g</i>as, &amp;c. Special instructions are when it is said: payasâ maitravaru<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> srî<i>n</i>âti, sruve<i>n</i>a puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>am anakti, he cooks the Maitravaru<i>n</i>a with milk, he anoints the Puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a with the spoon, &amp;c.</p>
