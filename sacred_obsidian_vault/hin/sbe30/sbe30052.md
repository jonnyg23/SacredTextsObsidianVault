 <p>1. After he has studied the Veda, the bath (which signifies the end of his studentship, is taken by him).</p>  
 <p>2. We shall explain that (bath).</p>

 <p>4. <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">4</font></a> He goes to a place near which water is, puts wood on the fire, performs the rites down to the oblations made with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, and puts a piece of Palâ<i>s</i>a wood on (the fire) with (the verse), 'Let us prepare this song like a chariot, for <i>G</i>âtavedas who deserves it, with our prayer. For his foresight in this assembly is a bliss to us. Agni! Dwelling in thy friendship may we not suffer harm. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>5. Then he sacrifices with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis as above,</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">6</font></a> (And another oblation with the verse), 'The threefold age of <i>G</i>amadagni, Ka<i>s</i>yapa's threefold age, the threefold age that belongs to the gods: may that threefold age be mine. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>7. (Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varu<i>n</i>a,' &amp;c. (see above, I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sûtra).</p>

Good luck!' he discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these (Mantras), 'Agni, lord of the vow, I have kept the vow.'</p>

With (the words), '(Loosen) the lowest (fetter),' (he takes off) the under garment; with (the words), '(Take) away the middle (fetter),' the girdle. With (the words), 'And may we, O Âditya, under thy law (&amp;c.),' (he deposes) his staff. The girdle, the staff, and the black antelope's skin he throws into water, sits down to the west of the fire, facing the east, and touches the razor (with which he is going to be shaven), with (the formula), 'Razor is thy name; the axe is thy father. Adoration to thee! Do no harm to me!'</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">11</font></a> Having handed over (that razor) to the barber, he touches the water with which his hair is to be moistened, with (the formula), 'Be blissful, (O waters), when we touch you.' [(The barber) then pours together warm and cold water. Having poured warm (water) into cold (water)]</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">12</font></a> (The barber) moistens the hair near the right ear with (the words), 'May the waters moisten thee for life, for old age and splendour' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ I, 2, 1, 1).</p>

 <p>17. He has the beard shaven first, then the hair in his arm-pits, then the hair (on his head), then the hair of his body, then (he has) his nails (cut).</p>  
 <p>18. A person who is kindly disposed (towards the student), gathers the hair, the beard, the hair of the body, and the nails (that have been cut off), in a lump of bull's dung, and buries (that lump of dung) in a cow-stable, or near an Udumbara tree, or in a clump of Darbha grass, with (the words), 'Thus I</p>
