 <p>1. <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a> For the Mahânâmnî verses (the Vrata is to be kept) twelve years,</p>  
 <p>2. (Or) nine, six, three (years).</p>  
 <p>3. These are the various possibilities.</p>  
 <p>4. Or also one year, according to some (teachers).</p>  
 <p>5. (In this case), however, the observances are enhanced.</p>  
 <p>6. (Keeping the Vrata through one year is allowed only) if (the student's) ancestors have learnt the Mahânâmnî verses.</p>  
 <p>7. There is also a Brâhma<i>n</i>a of the Rauruki (<i>S</i>âkhâ, in which it is said):</p>  
 <p>8. 'The mothers forsooth say to their sons, when they suckle them:</p>  
 <p>9. '"Become men, my little sons, who endeavour to accomplish the <i>S</i>akvarî-vrata!"'</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">10</font></a> During (the Vrata preparatory to the study of) these (i.e. the Mahânâmnî verses), touching water at the time of each Savana (is prescribed).</p>  
 <p>11. Let him not eat in the morning before he has touched water.</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">12</font></a> In the evening, after he has touched water, he should not eat, before he has put the piece of wood on the fire.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. He should wear dark clothes.</p>  
 <p>14. He should eat dark food.</p>  
 <p>15. Let him be devoted to his teacher.</p>  
 <p>16. Let him make way for nobody.</p>  
 <p>17. He should be addicted to austerities.</p>  
 <p>18. He should stand in day-time.</p>  
 <p>19. He should sit at night.</p>  
 <p>20. And when it is raining, he should not retire to a covered place.</p>  
 <p>21. He should say to (the god) when he sends rain, 'The <i>S</i>akvarîs are water.'</p>  
 <p>22. When (the god) sends lightning, he should say to him, 'Such forsooth is the nature of the <i>S</i>akvarîs.'</p>  
 <p>23. When (the god) thunders, he should say to him, 'The great voice of the great (cow)!'</p>  
 <p>24. Let him not cross a river without touching water.</p>  
 <p>25. Let him not ascend a ship.</p>  
 <p>26. If his life is in danger, however, he may ascend (a ship), after having touched water.</p>  
 <p>27. In the same way (he should touch water) having disembarked.</p>  
 <p>28. For in water the virtue of the Mahânâmnîs is contained.</p>  
 <p>29. If he practises these duties, (the god) Par<i>g</i>anya will send rain according to his wish.</p>  
 <p>30. <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">30</font></a> The rules about dark (clothes), standing, sitting, (making) way, and (dark) food may be considered as optional.</p>  
 <p>31. After he has kept his vow through one third (of the prescribed time, the teacher) should</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>sing to him the (first) Stotriya verse (of the Mahânâmnîs).</p>  
 <p>32. In the same way the two other Stotriya verses (after two-thirds of the time and at the end of the whole time).</p>  
 <p>33. Or all (the three verses) at the end of the whole (time).</p>  
 <p>34. He should sing them to (the student) who has fasted and shuts his eyes.</p>  
 <p>35. <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">35</font></a> Having filled a brass vessel with water, having thrown into it all sorts of herbs, and dipped (the student's) hands into it, the teacher should veil (the student's eyes) from left to right with a (new) garment that has not yet been washed.</p>  
 <p>36. <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">36</font></a> Or he should sing (the Mahânâmnîs to him) immediately after he has veiled (his eyes).</p>  
 <p>37. <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">37</font></a> With veiled eyes, keeping silence, he should abstain from food through a period of three nights, or through one day and one night.</p>  
 <p>38. Or he should stand in the forest till sunset (and spend the night in the village).</p>  
 <p>39. On the next morning he should put wood on the fire in the forest, should sacrifice with the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, and should cause the student to look at (the following objects, viz.)</p>  
 <p>40. Fire, Â<i>g</i>ya, the sun, a Brahman, a bull, food, water, curds,</p>  
 <p>41. With (the words), 'The sky have I beheld! Light have I beheld!'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p>42. In that way all (the objects stated in Sûtra 40) three times.</p>  
 <p>43. <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">43</font></a> After the ceremony for averting evil has been performed, the student respectfully salutes the teacher.</p>  
 <p>44. Thus he has to break the silence (enjoined upon him).</p>  
 <p>45. <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">45</font></a> A bull, a brass vessel, a garment, an optional gift (of a cow): this is the sacrificial fee.</p>  
 <p>46. The first time he may choose (either a bull or a brass vessel).</p>  
 <p>47. Let him provide his teacher with clothes, according to some (teachers).</p>  
 <p>48. <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">48</font></a> A mess of cooked food, sacred to Indra, (is prepared). Let him sacrifice of that (food) with this verse, 'To the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, to the Sâman we sacrifice' (Sâma-veda I, 369), or (with the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful' (ibid. I, 171), or with both (verses).</p>  
 <p>49. <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">49</font></a> This (he should do) at (all) the Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya ceremonies.</p>

 <p>50. <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">50</font></a> The Mantra has to be altered everywhere (so that he has to say), 'I have kept (the vow),' 'I have been able,' 'Thereby I have prospered,' 'I have undergone.'</p>  
 <p>51. <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">51</font></a> The fee to be given after the study of the Parvans is, a goat for the Agni-Parvan, a ram for the Indra-Parvan, a cow for the Pavamâna-Parvan.</p>  
 <p>52. After (the student) has returned (from the forest), he should entertain his teacher and his retinue with food,</p>  
 <p>53. And his fellow-students who have come together.</p>  
 <p>54. The way to sing the <i>G</i>yesh<i>th</i>asâmans has been explained by (the statements given with regard to) the Mahânâmnî-(vrata).</p>  
 <p>55. <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">55</font></a> Here the following standing duties are to be observed:</p>  
 <p>56. He should not have intercourse with a <i>S</i>ûdrâ woman.</p>  
 <p>57. He should not eat bird's flesh.</p>  
 <p>58. <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">58</font></a> He should avoid (constantly living on) the same grain, and in the same place, and wearing one garment.</p>  
 <p>59. He should perform the rite of 'touching water' with water drawn out (of a pond, &amp;c.).</p>

 <p>61. Nor drink (from such a vessel),</p>  
 <p>62. <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">62</font></a> (Or rather) from (the time of) his being taught (the <i>G</i>yesh<i>th</i>asâmans, after the whole preparatory time, or after one third of that time), according to some (teachers).</p>
