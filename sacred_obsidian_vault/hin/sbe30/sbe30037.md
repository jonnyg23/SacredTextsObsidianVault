 <p>4. In the night-time (he pronounces that Mantra so that it ends with the word) 'goods' (vasu), in the day-time (so that it ends) with 'wealth' (dhanam).</p>  
 <p>5. With the three verses, 'This praise' (MB. II, 4, 2-4) he should wipe along (with his hands) around (the fire).</p>

 <p>7. And at (ceremonies) which are connected with special wishes, the Prapada formula (MB. II, 4, 5)(in the following way):</p>  
 <p>8. He should murmur (the Prapada formula), 'Austerities and splendour,' should perform one suppression of breath, and should, fixing his thoughts on the object (of his wish), emit his breath, when beginning the Virûpâksha formula.</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">9</font></a> When undertaking ceremonies for the obtainment of special wishes, let him fast during three (days and) nights,</p>

 <p>12. <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">12</font></a> He should (simply) fast, however, before such ceremonies as are performed on sacrificial days (i.e. on the first day of the fortnight).</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">13</font></a> (At a ceremony) which ought to be performed immediately (after the occurrence by which it has been caused), the consecration follows after (the ceremony itself).</p>  
 <p>14. Let him recite the Prapada formula (Sûtras 7. 8), sitting in the forest on Darbha grass,</p>  
 <p>15. Of which the panicles are turned towards the east, if he is desirous of holy lustre,</p>

 <p>with (the verse), 'He who has a thousand arms, the protector of cow-keepers' (MB. II, 4, 7).</p>  
 <p>19. Having murmured the Kautomata verse (ibid. 8) over fruits of a big tree, he should give them</p>  
 <p>20. To a person whose favour he wishes to gain.</p>  
 <p>21. One (fruit) more (than he gives to that person), an even number (of fruits), he should keep himself.</p>  
 <p>22. There are the five verses, 'Like a tree' (MB. II, 4, 9-13).</p>  
 <p>23. <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">23</font></a> With these firstly a ceremony (is performed) for (obtaining property on) the earth.</p>

 <p>26. In which he can see his image.</p>  
 <p>27. <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">27</font></a> This observance (forms part) of (all) fortnightly observances.</p>

 <p>whom he hopes to obtain wealth); then he will obtain wealth.</p>  
 <p>31. With the second (verse) one who desires that his stock of horses and elephants may increase, should sacrifice fried grains, while the sun has a halo.</p>

It is stated that the recitation of the Virûpâksha and Prapada formulas and also the parisamûhana (Sûtra 5) should be omitted at the so-called Kshiprahomas, i.e. at sacrifices performed without the assistance of a ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avid. See Bloomfield's notes on G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha I, 92. 96. Regarding the way in which a prâ<i>n</i>âyâma ('suppression of breath') is performed, comp. Vasish<i>th</i>a XXV, 13 (S.B.E. XIV, p. 126).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_407"></a><a href="sbe30037.htm#fr_407">115:9</a> 9 seq. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 1, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_408"></a><a href="sbe30037.htm#fr_408">115:10</a> There are two meals a day. The words of this Sûtra, 'Or three meals,' are explained in the commentary in the following way. He should, if he does not entirely abstain from food through three days, take only three meals during that time, i.e. he should take one meal a day. The commentator adds that some read abhaktâni instead of bhaktâni ('or he should omit three meals'), in which case the result would be the same. I prefer the reading <a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a> bhaktâni, and propose to supply, not, 'he should eat,' but 'he should omit' ('abho<i>g</i>anam,' Sûtra 9). Possibly the meaning is that three successive meals should be omitted; thus also the compiler of the Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya seems to have understood this Sûtra. </p>
 <p><a name="fn_409"></a><a href="sbe30037.htm#fr_409">116:11</a> Comp., for instance, below, chap. 6, 1.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_411"></a><a href="sbe30037.htm#fr_411">116:13</a> My translation of this Sûtra differs from the commentary. There it is said: 'An occurrence which is perceived only when it has happened (sannipatitam eva), and of which the cause by which it is produced is unknown, for instance the appearance of a halo, is called sânnipâtika. Such sânnipâtika ceremonies are uparish<i>t</i>âddaiksha. The dîkshâ is the preparatory consecration (of the sacrificer), for instance by three days of fasting. A ceremony which has its dîkshâ after itself is called uparish<i>t</i>âddaiksha.' Similarly the commentary on Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 1, 3 says, 'uparish<i>t</i>ât sânnipâtike naimittike karma k<i>ri</i>tvâbho<i>g</i>anam.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_412"></a><a href="sbe30037.htm#fr_412">117:23</a> The commentary explains pârthivam, 'p<i>ri</i>thivyartha<i>m</i> kriyate, iti pârthivam, grâmakshetrâdyartham;' similarly the commentary on Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 1, 13 says, 'p<i>ri</i>thivîpatitvaprâptyartham idam ukta<i>m</i> karma.'</p>
