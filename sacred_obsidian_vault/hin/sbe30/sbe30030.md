 <p>1. <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">1</font></a> On the full-moon day of (the month) Â<i>s</i>vayu<i>g</i>a, at the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka ceremony, a mess of boiled rice-grains with milk, sacred to Rudra, (is prepared).</p>  
 <p>2. Of that (milk-rice) let him sacrifice, the first oblation with (the verse), 'To us, O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a' (Sâma-veda I, 220), the second with (the verse), 'Not in our offspring' (<i>Ri</i>g-veda I, 114, 8),</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">3</font></a> And (eight Â<i>g</i>ya oblations) with the 'cow's names' (i.e. with the formulas), 'The lovely one art thou,' &amp;c., with each (name) separately.</p>  
 <p>4. <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">4</font></a> The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.</p>  
 <p>5. Having carried the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka around the fire, turning his right side towards (the fire), and having caused the Brâhma<i>n</i>as to look at it (i.e. at the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka), he should look at it himself with (the verse</p>

 <p>repeated by the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and by the-sacrificer), 'That bright eye, created by the gods, which rises on the eastmay we see it a hundred autumns; may we live a hundred autumns!'</p>  
 <p>6. After he has entertained the Brâhma<i>n</i>as with food and has eaten himself, (the sacrificer and his family) should tie (to their arms, necks, &amp;c.) amulets made of lac together with all sorts of herbs, for the sake of prosperity.</p>  
 <p>7. In the evening he should feed the cows with the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka, and should let the calves join them.</p>  
 <p>8. Thus (the cows) will thrive.</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">9</font></a> At the sacrifice of the first fruits a mess of boiled rice-grains with milk, sacred to Indra and Agni, (is prepared).</p>  
 <p>10. Having sacrificed first a Havis offering of that (milk-rice), he sacrifices over that (oblation) four Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with (the verses), 'To him who bears a hundred weapons,' &amp;c. (MB. II, 1, 9-12).</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">11</font></a> The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.</p>  
 <p>12. The rest of the remnants of the sacrificial food he should give to eat to all (persons present) who have received the initiation (Upanayana).</p>  
 <p>13. Having 'spread under' water once, he should cut off two portions of the boiled rice-grains.</p>  
 <p>14. Three (portions are cut off) by descendants of Bh<i>ri</i>gu.</p>  
 <p>15. And over (these portions) water (is poured).</p>

 <p>19. After he has cut off a greater portion,</p>

 <p>21. Having sipped water, they should touch their mouths, their heads, and their limbs from above downwards, with (the verse), 'This art thou' (ibid. 14).</p>  
 <p>22. In the same way (sacrifices of the first fruits are performed) of <i>S</i>yâmâka (panicum frumentaceum) and of barley.</p>  
 <p>23. (At the sacrifice) of <i>S</i>yâmâka (the Mantra with which the food is partaken of [comp. Sûtra 16], is), 'May Agni eat as the first' (ibid. 15).</p>  
 <p>24. (At the sacrifice) of barley, 'This barley, mixed with honey' (ibid. 16).</p>
