 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Raising his right arm, putting the head into (the upavîta), he suspends (the cord) over his left shoulder, so that it hangs down on his right side: thus he becomes ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>opavîtin.</p>  
 <p>3. Raising his left arm, putting the head into (the upavîta), he suspends it over his right shoulder, so that it hangs down on his left side: thus he becomes prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtin.</p>  
 <p>4. Prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtin, however, he is only at sacrifices offered to the Manes.</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">5</font></a> Having gone in a northern direction from the fire, having washed his hands and feet, and having seated himself, he should sip water three times and wipe off (the water) twice.</p>  
 <p>6. Having besprinkled his feet (with water) let him besprinkle his head.</p>  
 <p>7. Let him touch the organs of his senses with water:</p>  
 <p>8. The two eyes, the nose, the two ears.</p>  
 <p>9. Whatever (limb of his body) requires his consideration (whether it is pure or not), that he should touch with water (i.e. with a wet hand).</p>  
 <p>10. Here they say:</p>  
 <p>11. Let him not touch (himself with water, or sip water) while walking,</p>  
 <p>12. Nor standing,</p>  
 <p>13. Nor laughing,</p>  
 <p>14. Nor looking about,</p>  
 <p>15. Nor without bending down,</p>

 <p>17. <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">17</font></a> Nor except with the (proper) Tîrtha,</p>  
 <p>18. Nor uttering a sound,</p>  
 <p>19. Nor without looking (at the water),</p>  
 <p>20. <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">20</font></a> Nor with his shoulders put back,</p>  
 <p>21. <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">21</font></a> Nor wearing a part of his under garment as if it were an upper garment,</p>  
 <p>22. Nor with warm water,</p>  
 <p>23. Nor with foamy water,</p>  
 <p>24. And in no case wearing sandals,</p>  
 <p>25. <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">25</font></a> (Not) with a turban on his head (?),</p>  
 <p>26. (Not with his garment) tied round his neck,</p>  
 <p>27. And not stretching out his feet.</p>  
 <p>28. <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">28</font></a> When he has finally touched (water) again, he becomes pure.</p>  
 <p>29. <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">29</font></a> Let him, however, sip only water that reaches his heart.</p>  
 <p>30. For if he does otherwise, he remains impure.</p>  
 <p>31. Now the cases in which he has to touch (water) a second time.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_106"></a><a href="sbe30005.htm#fr_106">16:1</a> 2, 1-4. Rules regarding the Upavîta. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 1, 4-6. Compare the detailed description of the nine threads of which the Upavîta-string should consist, in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha II, 48 seqq. A string was evidently considered as the regular and preferable form of the Upavîta; with regard to the second kind of Upavîta mentioned in Sûtra 1, the commentary says, 'A garment (is used), <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a> if the Upavîta has been lost, for instance, in a forest, and if it is impossible to get a string.' A similar remark is given with reference to the third kind of Upavîta, the rope of Ku<i>s</i>a grass.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_107"></a><a href="sbe30005.htm#fr_107">17:5</a> 5-32. Rules regarding the â<i>k</i>amana and upaspar<i>s</i>ana. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 1, 7-10; Manu II, 60 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_108"></a><a href="sbe30005.htm#fr_108">18:17</a> As to the Tîrthas (or parts of the hand) sacred to the different deities or beings, comp. Vasish<i>th</i>a III, 64 seqq., &amp;c. See also Manu II, 58.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_109"></a><a href="sbe30005.htm#fr_109">18:20</a> According to the commentary he has to hold his hands between his knees. Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 10, 8. Thus the shoulders are brought forward.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_110"></a><a href="sbe30005.htm#fr_110">18:21</a> 21-27. These Sûtras form three regular <i>S</i>loka hemistichs. Only at the end of the second hemistich there is a metrical irregularity (sopânatka<i>h</i> kva<i>k</i>it standing at the end of the verse).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_111"></a><a href="sbe30005.htm#fr_111">18:25</a> Kâsaktika<i>h</i>, which the commentary explains as a compound of ka, 'the head,' and âsaktikâ = âvesh<i>t</i>ikâ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_114"></a><a href="sbe30005.htm#fr_114">19:32</a> This Sûtra again forms a Sloka, though a slightly irregular Sloka.</p>
