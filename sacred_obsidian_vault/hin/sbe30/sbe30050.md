 <p>2. <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">2</font></a> One (of these pieces of wood he puts on the fire) with (the Mantra), 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great <i>G</i>âtavedas. As thou art inflamed, Agni, through that piece of wood, thus inflame me through wisdom, insight, offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and through the enjoyment of food. Svâhâ!'</p>

 <p>6. <a name="fr_519"></a><a href="#fn_519"><font size="1">6</font></a> 'Thou hast given thy consent;' 'Thou hast given thy impulse'thus he changes the end of each Mantra.</p>  
 <p>7. He then worships the (following) deities (with the following Mantras),</p>  
 <p>8. <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">8</font></a> Agni with (the words), 'Agni, lord of the vow, I shall keep the vow;'</p>  
 <p>9. Vâyu with (the words), 'Vâyu, lord of the vow, (&amp;c.);'</p>  
 <p>10. Âditya (the sun) with (the words), 'Âditya, lord of the vow, (&amp;c.);'</p>

This is thy son; I give him in charge to thee;' and he worships the sun with (the Mantra), 'That bright eye created by the gods which rises in the east: may we see it a hundred autumns; may we live a hundred autumns; may we</p>

May Indra with the Maruts here give (that) to thee; may the sun with the Vasus give (it) to thee'with (this verse the teacher) gives him a staff, and then hands over to him a bowl (for collecting alms).</p>  
 <p>15. Then he says to him, 'Go out for alms.'</p>

 <p>19. (The teacher accepts it) with the words, 'Good alms they are.'</p>

May after thee, the prosperous one, the well-born, many brothers and friends be born'with (this verse the teacher) takes (for himself) the former garment (of the student).</p>  
 <p>21. When the food (with which the Brâhma<i>n</i>as shall be entertained) is ready, (the student) takes some portion of boiled rice, cakes, and flour, mixes</p>
