 <p>house, touch them! To the protectress of the house svâhâ! Protector of the door, touch them! To the protector of the door svâhâ! Protectress of the door, touch them! To the protectress of the door svâhâ!'with (these formulas) he puts down four leaves; (then other leaves) with (the formulas), 'Noisy ones, touch them! To the noisy ones svâhâ! Quivered ones. . . ye that run in the rear . . . Minglers (?) . . . Choosers . . . Eaters, touch them! To the eaters svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>3. Then again ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts, touch them! To the divine hosts svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>4. Then other ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts that are named and that are not named, touch them! To them svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">5</font></a> Then he makes a basket of leaves, puts into it a lump of boiled rice with an 'under-spreading' (of Â<i>g</i>ya) and sprinkling (Â<i>g</i>ya) on it, goes outside his pasture-grounds, and hangs (the basket) up at a tree with (the formula), 'Quivered ones, touch it! To the quivered ones svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">6</font></a> He then performs worship (before that basket) with (the formula), 'Adoration to the quivered one, to him who wears the quiver! To the lord of the thieves adoration!'</p>

 <p>9. He has him (i.e. the Kshetrapati? an ox representing Kshetrapati?) led (to his place) in the same way as the <i>s</i>ûlagava (chap. 8, § 2).</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">10</font></a> He sacrifices quickly, (for) the god has a strong digestion (?).</p>  
 <p>11. He then performs worship with (the two verses), 'With the lord of the field,' 'Lord of the field' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 1, 14, 2. 3).</p>  
 <p>12. Of (the remains of that sacrificial food) sacred to Kshetrapati his uterine relations should partake, according as the custom of their family is.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_669"></a><a href="sbe30081.htm#fr_669">222:1</a> 9, 1. The text has bau<i>dh</i>yavihâra, on which the commentary observes, bau<i>dh</i>yâni palâ<i>s</i>apar<i>n</i>âni, teshâ<i>m</i> vihâro vihara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> nânâde<i>s</i>eshu sthâpana<i>m</i> bau<i>dh</i>yavihâra<i>h</i>, karmanâma vâ. The bau<i>dh</i>yavihâra is, as its description clearly shows, a ceremony for propitiating Rudra and his hosts and for averting evil from the cattle and the fields. The commentary understands it as forming part of the <i>s</i>ûlagava described in chap. 8, and with this opinion it would agree very well that no indication of the time at which the bau<i>dh</i>yavihâra ought to be performed (such as âpûryamâ<i>n</i>apakshe pu<i>n</i>ye nakshatre) is given. Comp. also Âpastamba VII, 20, 5 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_670"></a><a href="sbe30081.htm#fr_670">223:5</a> I have translated avadhâya (instead of avadâya), as Âpastamba VII, 20, 7 reads.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_672"></a><a href="sbe30081.htm#fr_672">223:7</a> The commentary explains surodaka as rain-water, or as rainwater which has fallen while the sun was shining.</p>

The meaning of the expression 'that (enam) mess of sacrificial food' is doubtful; the commentary says, enam iti pûrvâpeksham pûrvavad aupâsana evâsyâpi <i>s</i>rapa<i>n</i>ârtham.The last words (on four or on seven leaves) the commentator transfers to the next Sûtra, but he mentions the different opinion of other authorities.</p>
