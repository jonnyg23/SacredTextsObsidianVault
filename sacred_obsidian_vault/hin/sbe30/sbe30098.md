 <p>1. Having before the sacrifice gone round the fire, so that their right sides are turned towards it,</p>  
 <p>2. <a name="fr_735"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">2</font></a> They sit down in their former position, and while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras), with (the Mantras), 'To Soma, the acquirer of a wife, Svâhâ!' (M. I, 4, I-16), one oblation with each Mantra.</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_736"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">3</font></a> He then causes her, to the north of the fire, to tread with her right foot on a stone, with (the verse), 'Tread' (M. I, 5, 1).</p>  
 <p>4. Having 'spread under' Â<i>g</i>ya into her joined hands, he pours roasted grain twice (into them), and sprinkles Â<i>g</i>ya over it.</p>  
 <p>5. Some say that an uterine relation of hers pours the grain (into her hands).</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_737"></a><a href="#fn_737"><font size="1">6</font></a> He (?) sacrifices (that grain) with (the verse), 'This wife' (M. I, 5, 2).</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_738"><font size="1">7</font></a> Having gone round the fire, with the right side turned towards it, with the next three (verses; M. I, 5, 3-5) he makes her tread on the stone as above (M. I, 5, 6).</p>  
 <p>8. And the oblation (is performed) with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 7).</p>  
 <p>9. (Then follow) again the circumambulation (M. I, 5, 8-10), the injunction to tread on the stone</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (I, 5, 11), and the oblation with the next (verse; I, 5, 12);</p>  
 <p>10. (Then) the circumambulation again (I, 5, 13-15).</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_739"></a><a href="#fn_739"><font size="1">11</font></a> He enters upon the performance of the <i>G</i>aya and following oblations.</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_740"></a><a href="#fn_740"><font size="1">12</font></a> Having performed (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire), and having untied the rope with the next two verses (I, 5, 16. 17), he should then make her depart (from her father's house in a vehicle), or should have her taken away.</p>  
 <p>13. Having put that fire (with which the marriage rites have been performed, into a vessel), they carry it behind (the newly-married couple).</p>  
 <p>14. It should be kept constantly.</p>  
 <p>15. If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition,</p>  
 <p>16. Or it should be fetched from the house of a <i>S</i>rotriya.</p>  
 <p>17. Besides, if (the fire) goes out, one of them, either the wife or the husband, should fast.</p>  
 <p>18. Or he may sacrifice with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 18), and not fast.</p>  
 <p>19. The next (verse; M. I, 6, 1) is for putting the chariot (on which the young couple is to depart), in position;</p>  
 <p>20. With the next two (verses; M. I, 6, 2. 3), he puts the two animals to the chariot;</p>  
 <p>21. First the right one.</p>  
 <p>22. When she mounts (the chariot), he recites over her the next (verses; M. I, 6, 4-7).</p>  
 <p>

 <p>23. With the next (verse; M. I, 6, 8), he spreads out two threads in the wheel-tracks (in which the chariot is to go), a dark-blue one in the right (track), a red one in the left.</p>  
 <p>24. With the next (verses; M. I, 6, 9-11), he walks on these (threads).</p>  
 <p>25. And when they pass by bathing-places, posts, or cross-roads, let him murmur the next (verse; M. I, 6, 12).</p>
