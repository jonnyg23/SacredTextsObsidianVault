 <p>'May Agni come hither, the first of gods. May he release the offspring of this wife from the fetter of death. That may this king Varu<i>n</i>a grant, that this wife may not weep over distress (falling to her lot) through her sons. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'May Agni Gârhapatya protect this woman. May he lead her offspring to old age. With fertile womb may she be the mother of living children. May she experience delight in her sons. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'May no noise that comes from thee, arise in the house by night. May the (she-goblins called) the weeping ones take their abode in another (woman)</p>

 <p>'May Heaven protect thy back, Vâyu thy thighs, and the two A<i>s</i>vins thy breast. May Savit<i>ri</i> protect thy suckling sons. Until the garment is put on (thy sons?), may B<i>ri</i>haspati guard (them?), and the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs afterwards. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'Childlessness, the death of sons, evil, and distress, I take (from thee), as a wreath (is taken) from the head, and (like a wreath) I put all evil on (the head of) our foes. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'With this well-disposed prayer which the gods have created, I kill the Pi<i>s</i>â<i>k</i>as that dwell in thy womb. The flesh-devouring death-bringers I cast down. May thy sons live to old age. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>8. After he has sacrificed with (the verses), 'This, O Varu<i>n</i>a,' 'For this I entreat thee,' 'Thou Agni,' Thus thou, Agni,' 'Thou, Agni, art quick,' 'Pra<i>g</i>âpati'he makes her tread on a stone, with (the verse), 'Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Destroy those who seek to do thee harm; overcome thy enemies.'</p>  
 <p>9. To the west of the fire he strews two layers of northward-pointed Darbha grass, the one more to the west, the other more to the east. On these both (the bridegroom and the bride) station themselves, the one more to the west, the other more to the east.</p>
