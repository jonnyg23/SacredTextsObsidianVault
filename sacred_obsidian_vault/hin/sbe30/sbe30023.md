 <p><a name="fn_259"></a><a href="sbe30023.htm#fr_259">69:1</a> 1, 1. After the description of the regular Upanayana here follow, in chaps. 1 and 2, statements regarding the special Vratas which the Vedic student has to undergo, or rather which he may undergo, in the time of his studentship. Comp. the corresponding statements on the Vratas of the <i>Ri</i>gvedins, <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 11 and 12. By the followers of the Sâma-veda the ceremony of the Godâna, or cutting of the beard (comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 28, 19; Pâraskara II, 1, 7 seq.; Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 18), was put into connection with their system of Vratas; the undergoing of the Godânavrata enabled the student to study the Pûrvâr<i>k</i>ika of the Sâma-veda. In the commentary on Gobhila III, 1, 28 we find the following statements with regard to this Vrata as well as to the other Vratas mentioned in Sûtra 28: 'The Upanayana-vrata has been declared to refer to the study of the Sâvitrî (comp. Bloomfield's notes on G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha II, 42. 43); the Godâna-vrata, to the study of the collections of verses sacred to the gods Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavamâna (this is the Pûrvâr<i>k</i>ika of the Sâma-veda); the Vrâtika-vrata, to the study of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka, with the exclusion of the <i>S</i>ukriya sections; the Âditya-vrata, to the study of the <i>S</i>ukriya sections; the Aupanishada-vrata, to the study of the Upanishad-Brâhma<i>n</i>a; the <i>G</i>yaish<i>th</i>asâmika-vrata, to the study of the Â<i>g</i>yadohas.' The Vratas were connected with a repetition of the Upanayana ceremony (Sûtras 10 seq.) in the way stated in my note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 12, 1.Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 5, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="sbe30023.htm#fr_260">69:2</a> Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 28, 19, 'The Godânakarman is identical with the <i>K</i>û<i>d</i>âkarman.' Pâraskara II, 1, 7, At the Ke<i>s</i>ânta ceremony he says, "Hair and beard" (instead of "hair," as at the <i>K</i>û<i>d</i>âkara<i>n</i>a).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_261"></a><a href="sbe30023.htm#fr_261">70:3</a> At the <i>K</i>û<i>d</i>âkara<i>n</i>a the child sits in the mother's lap and others perform the rites for him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="sbe30023.htm#fr_262">70:10</a> See the note on Sûtra 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_263"></a><a href="sbe30023.htm#fr_263">70:11</a> Comp. above, II, 10, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="sbe30023.htm#fr_264">71:28</a> The meaning of these expressions has been explained in the note on Sûtra 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="sbe30023.htm#fr_265">71:30</a> According to the commentary some study the <i>S</i>ukriyas as a part of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka; these do not undergo the Âditya-vrata. Others, for instance the Kauthumas, separate the <i>S</i>ukriyas from the Âra<i>n</i>yaka and keep a special vow, the Âditya-vrata, by which they are enabled to study those texts.</p>
