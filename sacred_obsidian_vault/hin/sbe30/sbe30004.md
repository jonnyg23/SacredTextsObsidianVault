 <p>2. He should perform (the ceremonies) wearing the sacrificial cord on his left shoulder and having sipped water.</p>  
 <p>3. During the northern course of the sun, at the time of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day, before noon: this he should know as the (proper) time (for performing the ceremonies).</p>  
 <p>4. And as the prescription (is stated with regard to the time of the single ceremonies).</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">5</font></a> All (ceremonies) are accompanied by the Anvâhârya (<i>S</i>râddha).</p>

Beginning from the centre of it he should draw a line from west to east, (another line) from south to north which touches that line at its western end, and three lines from west to east (touching the northwards-turned line at three different points) in its midst (i.e. at neither of its ends). He then should besprinkle (those lines with water).</p>  
 <p>10. In this way the Laksha<i>n</i>a (i.e. the preparation of the place for the sacred fire) is performed everywhere.</p>  
 <p>11. With the words 'Bhûr, bhuva<i>h</i>, sva<i>h</i>,' they carry the fire forward (to that place) so that they have it in front of them.</p>

 <p>13. In this way, on the coincidence of an (auspicious) Tithi and an (auspicious) Nakshatra, (or of such a Nakshatra) and a Parvan</p>  
 <p>14. On the full-moon day or on the new-moon day: then he should celebrate the setting up of his (sacred domestic) fire.</p>  
 <p>15. <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">15</font></a> He should get fire from a Vai<i>s</i>ya's house or from a frying-pan, and should set it up (as his sacred fire);</p>  
 <p>16. Or (he should fetch it) from the house of one who offers many sacrifices, be it a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, or a Râ<i>g</i>anya, or a Vai<i>s</i>ya.</p>  
 <p>17. Or he may kindle another fire by attrition and may set it up.</p>  
 <p>18. That is pure, but it does not bring prosperity.</p>  
 <p>19. He may do what he likes (of the things stated as admissible in the last Sûtras.</p>  
 <p>20. <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">20</font></a> When he puts (at the end of his studentship) the last piece of wood (on the fire), or when he sacrifices when going to seize the hand of a wife, that fire he should keep.</p>  
 <p>21. That becomes his (sacred) domestic fire.</p>

 <p>24. Before the time has come for setting the fire in a blaze, he should fetch in the evening and in the morning from a hidden place the water with which the different acts (such as sipping water) are performed.</p>  
 <p>25. Or (he should fetch water only) in the evening.</p>  
 <p>26. Or he should draw it out of a water-pot or of a barrel.</p>  
 <p>27. <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">27</font></a> Before sunset he should set the fire in a blaze, and sacrifice the evening oblation after sunset.</p>  
 <p>28. In the morning he should set the fire in a blaze before sunrise, and should sacrifice the morning oblation before sunrise or after it.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_96"></a><a href="sbe30004.htm#fr_96">13:5</a> I cannot give this translation of the words 'sarvâ<i>n</i>y evânvâhâryavanti' without expressing my doubts as to whether the commentator, whom I have followed, is right. He says: 'anu pa<i>s</i><i>k</i>âd âhriyate yasmât prak<i>ri</i>ta<i>m</i> karma iti, anu pa<i>s</i><i>k</i>âd âhriyate yat prastutât (prak<i>ri</i>tât?) karma<i>n</i>a iti <i>k</i>ânvâhârya<i>m</i> nândîmukha<i>s</i>râddha<i>m</i> dakshi<i>n</i>â <i>k</i>o<i>k</i>yate.' It is evident that the first explanation of anvâhârya as a ceremony after which the chief sacrifice follows, is inadmissible. Below, IV, 4, 3. 4, Gobhila himself defines the Anvâhârya <i>S</i>râddha as a monthly ceremony (comp. Manu III, 123; Max Müller, India, p. 240); it is, consequently, different from a <i>S</i>râddha accompanying each G<i>ri</i>hya sacrifice. The <i>S</i>loka which the commentary quotes from a 'g<i>ri</i>hyântara' seems to me not to remove the doubt; I think rather that it contains a speculation based on this very passage of Gobhila, taken in the sense in <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a> which the commentator takes it, and on the Sûtras IV, 4, 3. 4. Thus I rather believe that we ought to understand anvâhârya as a mess of food like that offered after the dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>n</i>amâsau sacrifices to the officiating priests (Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, 133), and I propose to translate: All (sacrifices) are followed by (the offering of) the Anvâhârya food (to the priest).</p>
