 <p>'Your limb that this flesh-devouring (Agni) has burnt, leading you to the worlds (of the Fathers), <i>G</i>âtavedas, that I restore to you again. Unviolated with all your limbs arise, O Fathers! Svadhâ! Adoration!</p>  
 <p>'Carry the Â<i>g</i>ya, <i>G</i>âtavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of Â<i>g</i>ya flow to them; may their wishes with all their desires be fulfilled! Svadhâ! Adoration!'</p>

 <p>4. He then touches the food with (the formulas), 'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid. I sacrifice thee into the Brahman's mouth. I sacrifice thee into the up-breathing and down-breathing of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. Thou art imperishable; do not perish for the Fathers yonder, in yon world! The earth is steady; Agni is its surveyor in order that what has been given may not be lost.</p>  
 <p>'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &amp;c. Do not perish for the grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The air is steady; Vâyu is its surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost.</p>  
 <p>'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &amp;c. Do not perish for the great-grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The heaven is steady; Âditya is its surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost.'</p>

Before the verse, 'Carry the Â<i>g</i>ya,' the Udî<i>k</i>yas, as Mât<i>ri</i>datta states, insert the words, 'He then makes oblations of Â<i>g</i>ya (with the Mantra, &amp;c.).' According to this reading the words of the second Sûtra, 'In the same way, &amp;c.,' would refer only to these last oblations.</p>
