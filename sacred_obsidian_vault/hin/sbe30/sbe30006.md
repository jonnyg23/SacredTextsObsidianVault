 <p>2. To the west with (the words), 'Anumati! Give thy consent!'</p>  
 <p>3. To the north with (the words), 'Sarasvatî! Give thy consent!'</p>  
 <p>4. With (the words), 'God Savit<i>ri</i>! Give thy impulse!' (Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 1, 1) he should sprinkle (water) round the fire once or thrice so as to keep his right side turned towards it</p>  
 <p>5. Interchanging the points at which he begins and ends the (sprinkling of water), and sprinkling so as to encompass what he is going to offer (with the streams of water).</p>

 <p>8. If it consists in curds or milk or rice gruel, (he should sacrifice it) with a brazen bowl, or with the pot in which the oblations of boiled rice are prepared, or also with the (sacrificial spoon called) Sruva;</p>

 <p>10. In the morning the first (oblation) with (the formula), 'To Sûrya Svâhâ!' the second again silently, again in the middle and in the north-eastern part (of the fire).</p>  
 <p>11. Having put a piece of wood (on the fire), and having again sprinkled (water) round it, he should pour out again his joined hands full of water in the same way (as prescribed in the Sûtras 1-3); in the Mantras he says, 'Thou hast given thy consent' (instead of 'Give thy consent').</p>

 <p><a name="fn_115"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_115">19:3</a> Rules regarding the daily morning and evening sacrifice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_116"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_116">19:1</a> 1-5. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 2, 17-21.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_117"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_117">19:6</a> The sacrificial food is either k<i>ri</i>ta (prepared) or ak<i>ri</i>ta (unprepared). A mess of boiled rice, for instance, is k<i>ri</i>ta, rice grains are ak<i>ri</i>ta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_118"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_118">20:7</a> 7-12. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 5, 10-12. Prodaka in Sûtra 7 is explained by pragatodaka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_119"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_120">20:10</a> 9-10. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya, l.l. 13-15.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_119">20:9</a> The first oblation is made in the middle, the second, sacred to Pra<i>g</i>âpati (<i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 3, 15, &amp;c.), in the north-eastern part of the sacred fire. The tenth Sûtra of course is to be understood in the same way.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_121"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_121">20:12</a> The water is that mentioned chap. 1, 24. With regard to <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a> yathârtham the commentary says, 'yathârtha<i>m</i> karmâpavargavihita<i>m</i> Vâmadevyagânâdika<i>m</i> prâtarâhutipa<i>s</i><i>k</i>âdvihita<i>m</i> brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> vâ kuryâd iti vâkya<i>s</i>esha<i>h</i>.' Similarly in the note on II, 4, 11 it is said, 'yathârtham iti karma<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> parisamâptir u<i>k</i>yate;' II, 8, 17: 'yathârtha<i>m</i> tantrasamâpana<i>m</i> kuryât,' &amp;c. In my translation I have adopted the opinion of Professor Weber (Indische Studien, V, 375), according to whom yathârtham simply means, '(he should behave) as required by circumstances;' '(he should do) what happens to be his business.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_122"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_122">21:13</a> The last words are â <i>g</i>îvitâvabh<i>ri</i>thât, which literally means 'till the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha bath of his life.' The Avabh<i>ri</i>tha bath is the bath taken at the end of certain sacrifices, so that the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha of life signifies death.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_123"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_123">21:15</a> Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 5, 17.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_124">21:16</a> 16-18. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya, l.l. 18, 19. In my translation of Sûtra 17 I have adopted, though not quite without doubt, the conjecture of Professor Roth given in Professor Knauer's note, p. 137. Professor Roth writes <i>ri</i>tebhaṅgayâ vâ<i>k</i>â or <i>ri</i>tebhagayâ vâ<i>k</i>â: he says simply 'om,' and not 'ó-o-ó-o-ó-om.' According to the commentary Sûtra 17 would refer to the wife, not to the husband.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="sbe30006.htm#fr_125">21:18</a> The MSS. give mâkhyâ and mâkshâ. We ought to read, tan ma kshâyîty upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u. Comp. Âpastamba II, 2, 3, 11</p>
