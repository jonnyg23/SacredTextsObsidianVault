I, 14, 1-7); then he enters upon the performance of the <i>G</i>aya and following oblations, and performs (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). (The remains of) the (sacrificial food) with butter, he should give to eat to an even number of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, at least to two, and should cause them to pronounce wishes for his success.</p>

I, 15, 2-4) over it, should tie (its root) with the next (verse; M.
