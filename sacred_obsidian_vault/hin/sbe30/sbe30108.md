II, 11, 20), and has taken him on his lap with the next Ya<i>g</i>us (M. II, II, 21), with the next (three) (versesII, 11, 22; 12, 1. 2one by one) he addresses the child, kisses him on his head, and murmurs (the third verse) into his right ear.</p>  
 <p>2. And he gives him a Nakshatra name.</p>

 <p>means of the piece of gold, some of the mixture) to eat. With the next five (verses, II, 12, 6-10) he bathes him. Then he pours curds and ghee together and gives him this (mixture which is called) 'sprinkled butter' (p<i>ri</i>shadâ<i>g</i>ya) to eat out of a brass vessel, with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis to which the syllable 'Om' is added as the fourth (II, 12, 11-14). The remainder he should mix with water and pour out in a cow-stable.</p>  
 <p>5. With the next (verse, M. II, 13, 1) he places (the child) in the mother's lap; with the next (II, 13, 2) he causes her to give him her right breast; with the next two (verses, II, 13, 3. 4) he touches the earth, and after (the child) has been laid down, (he touches him) with the next (formula, II, 13, 5).</p>  
 <p>6. With the next Ya<i>g</i>us (II, 13, 6) he places a water-pot at (the child's) head, sacrifices mustard seeds and rice-chaff with his joined hands three times with each of the next (formulas, II, 13, 7-14, 2), repeating each time the word Svâhâ, and says (to the people who are accustomed to enter the room in which his wife lies), 'Whenever you enter, strew silently (mustard seeds with rice-chaff) on the fire.'</p>

 <p>9. (It should be a name) of two syllables or of four syllables; the first part should be a noun; the second a verb; it should have a long vowel (or) the Visarga at the end, should begin with a sonant, and contain a semi-vowel.</p>
