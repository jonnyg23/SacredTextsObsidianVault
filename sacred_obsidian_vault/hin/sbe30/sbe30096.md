 <p>2. Under the Phalgunî (Nakshatra) marriage is celebrated.</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">3</font></a> A daughter whom he wishes to be dear (to her husband), a father should give in marriage under the Nish<i>t</i>yâ (Nakshatra); thus she becomes dear (to her husband); she does not return (to her father's) house: this is an observance based on a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>4. <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">4</font></a> The word Invakâs means M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>iras; the word Nish<i>t</i>yâ means Svâti.</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">5</font></a> At the wedding one cow;</p>  
 <p>6. In the house one cow:</p>  
 <p>7. With the (first cow) he should prepare an Argha reception for the bridegroom as for a guest,</p>  
 <p>8. With the other (the bridegroom [?] should do so) for a person whom he reveres.</p>  
 <p>9. These are the occasions for killing a cow: (the arrival of) a guest, (the Ash<i>t</i>akâ sacrifice offered to) the Fathers, and marriage.</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">10</font></a> Let (the wooer) avoid in his wooing a girl that sleeps, or cries, or has left home.</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">11</font></a> And let him avoid one who has been given (to another), and who is guarded (by her relations), and one who looks wicked (?), or who is a most</p>

 <p>excellent one (?), or (who is like the fabulous deer) <i>s</i>arabha (?), a hunch-back, a girl of monstrous appearance, a bald-headed girl, a girl whose skin is like a frog's (?), a girl who has gone over to another family (?), a girl given to sensual pleasures (?), or a herdess, or one who has too many friends, or who has a fine younger sister, or one whose age is too near to that of the bridegroom (?).</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_732"><font size="1">12</font></a> Girls who have the name of a Nakshatra, or of a river, or of a tree, are objectionable.</p>  
 <p>13. And all girls in whose names the last letter but one is r or l, one should avoid in wooing.</p>  
 <p>14. If possible, he should place (the following) objects hidden before the girl, and should say to her, 'Touch (one of these things).'</p>  
 <p>15. (The objects are), different kinds of seeds mixed together, loose earth from (the kind of sacrificial altar called) vedi, an earth-clod from a field, cow-dung, and an earth-clod from a cemetery.</p>  
 <p>16. <a name="fr_733"></a><a href="#fn_733"><font size="1">16</font></a> If she touches one of the former (objects, this portends) prosperity as characterized (by the nature of what she has touched).</p>  
 <p>17. The last is regarded as objectionable.</p>  
 <p>18. Let him marry a girl of good family and character, with auspicious characteristics, and of good health.</p>  
 <p>19. Good family, a good character, auspicious characteristics, learning, and good health: these are the accomplishments of a bridegroom.</p>

It is clear that with the first cow the bride's father has to receive the bridegroom. The 'house' mentioned in Sûtra 6 seems to be the house of the newly-married couple. In the expression 'whom he reveres,' 'he,' according to the commentaries, is the bridegroom.</p>
