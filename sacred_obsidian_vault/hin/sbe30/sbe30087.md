 <p>1. On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers.</p>  
 <p>2. <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">2</font></a> Having put wood on the fire and strewn southward-pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, he sacrifices the oblation for the touching of the animal (see below), with (the verse), 'This cow I touch for the Fathers; may my assembled fathers gladly accept it (which is offered) with fat and ghee, with the word svadhâ; may it satiate my fathers in the other world. Svadhâ! Adoration!' Then he touches (the cow) with one (blade of) sacrificial grass and with an unforked Vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>n</i>î of Udumbara wood, with (the formula), 'I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.'</p>  
 <p>3. He sprinkles (the cow with water) with (the words), 'I sprinkle thee agreeable to the Fathers.'</p>

 <p>carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned to the west, its feet to the south.</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">5</font></a> After it has been killed, he silently 'strengthens' its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.</p>  
 <p>6. With the Vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>n</i>î of Udumbara wood he roasts the omentum; with spits of Udumbara wood the other (parts mentioned in Sûtra 5) separately.</p>  
 <p>7. After he has roasted them, and has sprinkled Â<i>g</i>ya over them, and has taken them from the fire, he sprinkles water round (the fire) from right to left, puts a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), and sacrifices with a Darvi spoon of Udumbara wood the omentum, spreading under and sprinkling over it (Â<i>g</i>ya), with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum, <i>G</i>âtavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of fat flow to them; may their wishes with all their desires be fulfilled. Svadhâ! Adoration!'</p>  
 <p>8. <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">8</font></a> He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sûtra 5) he should offer to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and should feed them (with those parts of the cow).</p>  
 <p>9. When the food (for the Brâhma<i>n</i>as) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadânas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and from the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations</p>

 <p>thereof with the verses, 'Behold the Ekâsh<i>t</i>akâ, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadhâ. By the Brâhma<i>n</i>as that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessing) to me! Svadhâ! Adoration!'</p>  
 <p>'The Ekâsh<i>t</i>akâ, devoting herself to austerities, the consort of the year, exuberant (with milk), has poured forth milk. May you live on that milk, O Fathers, all together. May this (food) be well offered and well sacrificed by me! Svadhâ! Adoration!</p>  
 <p>'The image of the year' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. V, 7, 2, 1).</p>  
 <p>10. After he has sacrificed, he cuts off (the Avadânas) from the food and from the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes an oblation with (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavâhana Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t svadhâ! Adoration!'</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">11</font></a> The known (rites) down to the pouring out of the handfuls of water (are performed here) as at the monthly (<i>S</i>râddha).</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">12</font></a> The gifts of food and presents, however, are not necessary here.</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">13</font></a> On the following day, he prepares food for the Fathers with the rest of the meat, and sacrifices with (the two verses), 'Thou, Agni, art quick,' (and), Pra<i>g</i>âpati!' (see above, I, 1, 3, 5).</p>
