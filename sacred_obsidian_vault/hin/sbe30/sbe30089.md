 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)</i>, by Hermann Oldenberg, [1892], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">PRA<i>S</i>NA II, PA<i>T</i>ALA 7, SECTION 17.</h3>  
 <p>1. <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">1</font></a> We shall explain the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î ceremony.</p>  
 <p>2. <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">2</font></a> On the full-moon day of Mârga<i>s</i>îrsha he puts wood on the fire, strews (Darbha grass) on the entire surface round the fire, cooks a mess of sacrificial food with milk, sprinkles it (with Â<i>g</i>ya), takes it from the fire, performs the rites down to the Vyâh<i>ri</i>ti oblations, and sacrifices (four oblations) with (the following Mantras):</p>  
 <p>'This offering, the creeping of I<i>d</i>â, rich in ghee, moving and not moving, accept gladly, O <i>G</i>âtavedas.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> What domestic animals there are, of all shapes, all seven kinds of them: may they gladly dwell here and may they prosper. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'The night which men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'Bringing bliss to the cattle, to the wife, bringing bliss by night and by day, may this (night) which is the consort of the year, be auspicious to us. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'The full-moon night, bringing abundance, visiting one after another, dividing the months and fortnights: may this (night), the full one, protect us. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">3</font></a> He sacrifices the oblation to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t with (the verse), 'Agni, make this (sacrifice) full that it may be well offered. Be victorious, O god, in all battles. Shine far and wide, showing us a wide path. Bestow on us long life, full of splendour and free from decay. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>4. Then he washes his hands and touches the earth with (the formulas), 'In power I establish myself, in royalty. Among the horses I establish myself, among the cows. In the limbs I establish myself, in the self. In the Prâ<i>n</i>as I establish myself, in prosperity. In Heaven and Earth I establish myself, in sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>'May the three times eleven gods, the thirty-three, the gracious ones, whose Purohita is B<i>ri</i>haspati, on the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>may the gods with (all) the gods give me bliss!'</p>  
 <p>5. The master of the house sits down at their southerly end,</p>

 <p>6. The other persons to the north,</p>  
 <p>7. According to their seniority.</p>  
 <p>8. They who know the Mantras among them, murmur the Mantras (which will be stated).</p>  
 <p>9. With (the verse), 'Be soft to us, O earth, free from thorns; grant us rest; afford us wide shelter' (Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 10), and with the two (verses), 'Verily of the mountains' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 2, 12, 2. 3) they lie down on their right sides.</p>  
 <p>10. With (the verse), 'Up! with life' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 2, 8, 1) they arise.</p>  
 <p>11. When they have arisen, they murmur, 'We have arisen; we have become immortal.'</p>  
 <p>12. In that way they (lie down and) arise that night three times.</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">13</font></a> Having served food to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and having caused them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' they rest that night.</p>

Dr. Kirste (Preface, p. viii), accordingly, believes that the three last chapters may be later additions. It may be observed in connection with this, that in the Âpastambîya-G<i>ri</i>hya, which throughout is so closely related to our text, the ceremonies of the Upâkara<i>n</i>a and Utsar<i>g</i>ana, of which these three chapters treat, are not described.</p>
