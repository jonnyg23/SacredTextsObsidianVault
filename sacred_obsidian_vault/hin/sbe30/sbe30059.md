 <p>1. When he has first seen the new moon, he sips water, and holding (a pot of) water (in his hands) he worships (the moon) with the four (verses), 'Increase' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 4, 32), 'May thy milk' (ibid. IV, 2, 7, 4), 'New and new again (the moon) becomes, being born' (ibid. II, 4, 14, 1), 'That Soma which the Âdityas make swell' (ibid. II, 4, 14, 1).</p>

 <p>2. <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">2</font></a> When he has yawned, he murmurs, '(May) will and insight (dwell) in me.'</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">3</font></a> If the skirt (of his garment) is blown upon him (by the wind), he murmurs, 'A skirt art thou. Thou art not a thunderbolt. Adoration be to thee. Do no haft to me.'</p>  
 <p>4. He should tear off a thread (from that skirt) and should blow it away with his mouth.</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">5</font></a> If a bird has befouled him with its excrements, he murmurs, 'The birds that timidly fly together with the destroyers, shall pour out on me happy, blissful splendour and vigour.'</p>  
 <p>Then let him wipe off that (dirt) with something else than his hand, and let him wash himself with water.</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">6</font></a> 'From the sky, from the wide air a drop of water has fallen down on me, bringing luck. With my senses, with my mind I have united myself, protected by the prayer that is brought forth by the righteous ones'this (verse) he should murmur, if a drop of water unexpectedly falls down on him.</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">7</font></a> 'If a fruit has fallen down from the top of a tree, or from the air, it is Vâyu (who has made it fall). Where it has touched our bodies or the garment, (there) may the waters drive away destruction'this (verse) he should murmur, if a fruit unexpectedly falls down on him.</p>

 <p>whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells at the cross-roads!'this (formula) he murmurs when he comes to a cross-road;</p>  
 <p>9. 'Adoration to him who dwells among cattle, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among cattle!'thus at a dung-heap;</p>  
 <p>10. 'Adoration to him who dwells among the serpents, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among the serpents!'thus at a place that is frequented by serpents.</p>  
 <p>11. 'Adoration to him who dwells in the air, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the air!'this (formula) let him murmur, if overtaken by a tornado.</p>  
 <p>12. 'Adoration to him who dwells in the waters, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the waters!'this (formula) he murmurs when plunging into a river which is full of water.</p>  
 <p>13. 'Adoration to him who dwells there, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells there!'this (formula) he murmurs when approaching a beautiful place, a sacrificial site, or a big tree.</p>  
 <p>14. <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">14</font></a> If the sun rises whilst he is sleeping, he shall fast that day and shall stand silent during that day;</p>  
 <p>15. The same during the night, if the sun sets whilst he sleeps.</p>

 <p>touching it, he would bring upon himself (the guilt of) whatever faults have been committed at that sacrifice. If he touches one (sacrificial post), he should say, 'This is thy wind;' if two (posts), 'These are thy two winds;' if many (posts), 'These are thy winds.'</p>  
 <p>17. <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">17</font></a> 'The voices that are heard after us (?) and around us, the praise that is heard, and the voices of the birds, the deer's running (?) athwart: that we fear (?) from our enemies'this (verse) he murmurs when setting out on a road.</p>  
 <p>18. <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">18</font></a> 'Like an Udgât<i>ri</i>, O bird, thou singest the Sâman; like a Brahman's son thou recitest thy hymn, when the Soma is pressed.</p>  
 <p>'A blessing on us, O bird; bring us luck and be kind towards us!'(This Mantra) he murmurs against an inauspicious bird;</p>  
 <p>19. <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">19</font></a> 'If thou raisest thy divine voice, entering upon living beings, drive away our enemies by thy voice. O death, lead them to death!'(thus) against a solitary jackal.</p>  
 <p>20. Then he throws before the (jackal, as it were), a fire-brand that burns at both ends, towards that region (in which the jackal's voice is heard), with (the words), 'Fire! Speak to the fire! Death! Speak to the death!' Then he touches water,</p>
