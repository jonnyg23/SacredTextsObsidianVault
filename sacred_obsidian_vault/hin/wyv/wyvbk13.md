 <p>I TAKE within me Agni first, for increase of my wealth,<br> good offspring, manly strength:<br> So may the Deities wait on me.<br> 2 Thou art the waters back, the womb of Agni, around the<br> ocean as it swells and surges.<br> Waxing to greatness, resting on the lotus, spread forth in<br> amplitude with heaven's own measure.<br> 3 Eastward at first was Brahma generated. Vena oerspread<br> the bright Ones from the summit,<br> Disclosed his deepest nearest revelations, womb of existent<br> and of non-existent.<br> 4 In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all<br> created being.<br> He fixed and holdeth up this earth and heaven. Worship<br> we Ka the God with our oblation.<br> 5 The Drop leaped onward through the earth and heaven,<br> along this place and that which was before it.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the Drop still<br> moving to the common dwelling.<br> 6 Homage be paid to Serpents unto all of them that are on<br> earth,<br> To those that dwell in air, to those that dwell in sky be<br> homage paid.<br> 7 To those that are the demons darts, to those that live upon<br> the trees,<br> To all the Serpents that lie low in holes be adoration paid.<br> 8 Or those that are in heaven's bright sphere, or those that<br> dwell in the Sun's beams:<br> Serpents, whose home has been prepared in waters, homage<br> unto them!<br> 9 Put forth like a wide-spreading net thy vigour: go like a<br> mighty King with his attendants.<br> Thou, following thy swift net, shootest arrows: transfix the<br> fiends with darts that burn most fiercely.<br> 10 Forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons: follow them<br> closely glowing in thy fury.<br> Spread with thy tongue the wingèd flames, O Agni: unfettered<br> cast thy firebrands all around thee.<br> 11 Send thy spies forward, fleetest in thy motion: be, neer<br> deceived, the guardian of this people<br> From him who, near or far, is bent on evil, and let no<br> trouble sent from thee oercome us.<br> 12 Rise up, O Agni, spread thee out before us, burn down our<br> foes, thou who hast sharpened arrows.<br> Him, blazing Agni! who hath worked us mischief, consume<br> thou utterly like dried-up stubble.<br> 13 Rise, Agni, drive off those who fight against us: make<br> manifest thine own celestial vigour.<br> Slacken the strong bows of the demon-driven: destroy our<br> foemen whether kin or stranger.<br> I settle thee with Agni's fiery ardour.</p>

 <p>14 Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth<br> is he:<br> He quickeneth the waters seed.<br> I settle thee with the great strength of Indra.<br> 15 Thou art the leader of the rite and region to which with<br> thine auspicious teams thou tendest.<br> Thy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making<br> thy tongue the oblation-bearer, Agni!<br> 16 Steady art thou, sustainer, laid by Visvakarman in thy<br> place.<br> Let not the ocean nor the bird harm thee: unshaking, steady<br> earth.<br> 17 Thee let Prajâpati settle on the waters back, in Ocean's<br> course,<br> Thee the capacious, widely spread. Thou art the Wide<br> One: spread thee wide<br> 18 Thou art the earth, the ground, thou art the all-sustaining<br> Aditi, she who supporteth all the world.<br> Control the earth, steady the earth, do thou the earth no<br> injury.<br> 19 For all breath, out-breath; through-breath, upward-breathing,<br> for high position, for prescribed observance,<br> May Agni keep thee safe with great well-being, with the<br> securest shelter. As aforetime with Angiras, with that<br> Deity lie steady.<br> 20 Upspringing from thine every joint, upspringing from each<br> knot of thine,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thus with a thousand, Dûrvâ! with a hundred do thou<br> stretch us out.<br> 21 Thou spreading with a hundred, thou that branched with<br> a thousand shoots,<br> Thee, such, with our oblation will we worship, O celestial<br> Brick.<br> 22 Thy lights, O Agni, in the Sun that with their beams<br> oerspread the sky,<br> With all of those assist thou us to-day to light and progeny.<br> 23. Lights of yours in the Sun, O Gods, or lights that are in<br> kine and steeds,<br> O Indra-Agni, with all those vouchsafe us light, Brihaspati!<br> 24 The Far.-Refulgent held the light. The Self-Refulgent held<br> the light.<br> Thee, luminous, may Prajâpati settle upon the back of Earth.<br> Give, to all breathing, all the light, to out-breath, to diffusive<br> breath.<br> Thy Sovran Lord is Agni. With that Deity, as with Angiras,<br> lie firmly settled in thy place.<br> 25 Madhu and Mâdhava, the two Spring seasonsthou art<br> the innermost cement of Agni.<br> May Heaven and Earth, may Waters, Plants and Agnis<br> help, separate, accordant, my precedence.<br> May all the Fires twixt heaven and earth, one-minded,<br> well-fitted, gather round these two Spring seasons,<br> As the Gods gathering encompass Indra: firm with that<br> Deity, Angiras-like, be seated.<br> 26 Thou art Ashâdhâ, Conquering One. Conquer our foemen,<br> conquer thou the men who fain would-fight with us.<br> A thousand manly powers hast thou: so do thou aid and<br> quicken me.</p>

 <p>27 The winds waft sweets, the rivers pour sweets for the man<br> who keeps the Law:<br> So may the plants be sweet for us.<br> 28 Sweet be the night and sweet the dawns, sweet the terrestrial<br> atmosphere:<br> Sweet be our Father Heaven to us.<br> 29 May the tall tree be full of sweets for us and, and full of<br> sweets the Sun:<br> May our milch-kine be sweet for us.<br> 30 Seat thyself in the deepness of the waters, lest Sûrya, lest<br> Vaisvânara Agni scorch thee.<br> With wing unclipped, survey created beings: may rain<br> that cometh down from heaven attend thee.<br> 31 He crept across the three heaven-reaching oceans, the Bull<br> of Bricks, the Master of the Waters.<br> Clad in the world with his, the Well-Made's, vesture, go<br> whither those before thee have departed.<br> 32 May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, besprinkle this our<br> sacrifice,<br> And feed us full with nourishments.<br> 33 Look ye on Vishnu's works whereby the Friend of Indra,<br> close allied,<br> Hath let his holy ways be seen.</p>

Hence engendered, forth from<br> these wombs at first came Jâtavedas.<br> By Gâyatrî, by Trishtup, by Anushtup, may he who knows<br> bear to the Gods oblation.<br> 35 Take thou thine ease for food, for store of riches, for might<br> in splendour, and for strength and offspring.<br> Thou art all-ruling, independent Ruler: both fountains of<br> Sarasvatî protect thee!<br> 36 O radiant Agni, harness thou thy steeds which are most excellent!<br> They bear thee as thy spirit wills.<br> 37 Yoke, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invoke the<br> Gods:<br> As ancient Hotar take thy seat.<br> 38 Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves<br> in inmost heart and spirit.<br> I look upon the flowing streams of butter: the golden reed<br> is in the midst of Agni.<br> 39 Thee for the praise-verse, thee for sheen, thee for bright<br> splendour, thee for light.<br> This hath become the energetic spirit of all the world and of<br> Vaisvânara Agni.<br> 40 Agni, all-luminous with light, splendid with splendour, golden<br> One.<br> Giver of thousands art thou: for a thousand thee.</p>
