 <p>PURUSHA hath a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a<br> thousand feet.<br> Pervading earth on every side he fills a space ten fingers<br> broad.<br> 2 Purusha is in truth this All, what hath been and what yet<br> shall be;<br> Lord, too, of immortality which waxes greater still by food.<br> 3 So mighty in his grandeur; yea, greater than this is Purusha.<br> All creatures are one fourth of him, three fourths eternal<br> life in heaven.</p>

 <p>4 With three fourths Purusha rose up: one fourth of him<br> again was here.<br> Thence he moved forth to every side over what eats not<br> and what eats.<br> 5 From him Virâj was born; again Purusha from Virâj was<br> born.<br> When born, he spread to west and east beyond the boundaries<br> of earth.<br> 6 From that great General Sacrifice the dripping fat was<br> gathered up.<br> He formed the creatures of the air and animals both wild<br> and tame.<br> 7 From that great General Sacrifice Richas and Sâma hymns<br> were born:<br> Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus<br> had its birth from it.<br> 8 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows<br> of teeth<br> From it were generated kine, from it were goats and sheep<br> produced.<br> 9 They balmed as victim on the grass Purusha born in earliest<br> time.<br> With him the Deities and all Sâdhyas and Rishis sacrificed.<br> 10 When they divided Purusha how many portions did they<br> make?</p>

 <p>What was his mouth? what were his arms? what are the<br> names of thighs and feet?<br> 11 The Brâhman was his mouth, of both his arms was the<br> Râjanya made.<br> His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sûdra was<br> produced.<br> 12 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye<br> the Sun had birth;<br> Vâyu and Prâna from his ear, and from his mouth was Agni<br> born.<br> 13 Forth from his navel came mid-air; the sky was fashioned<br> from his head;<br> Earth from his feet, and from his ear the Quarters. Thus<br> they formed the worlds.<br> 14 When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as offering<br> Spring was the butter, Autumn the oblation, Summer was<br> the wood.<br> 15 Then seven were his enclosing-sticks, his kindling-brands<br> were three times seven,<br> When Gods, performing sacrifice, bound as their victim<br> Purusha.<br> 16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim: these were the earliest<br> holy ordinances.<br> The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where<br> the Sâdhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.</p>

 <p>17 In the beginning he was formed, collected from waters, earth,<br> and Visvakarman's essence.<br> Fixing the form thereof Tvashtar proceedeth. This was at<br> first the mortal's birth and godhead.<br> 18 I know this mighty Purusha whose colour is like the Sun,<br> beyond the reach of darkness.<br> He only who knows him leaves Death behind him. There is<br> no path save this alone to travel.<br> 19 In the womb moves Prajâpati: he, never becoming born, is<br> born in sundry figures.<br> The wise discern the womb from which he springeth. In<br> him alone stand all existing creatures.<br> 20 He who gives light and heat to Gods, first, foremost Agent<br> of the Gods,<br> Born ere the Godsto him the bright, the holy One, be<br> reverence<br> 21 Thus spake the Gods at first, as they begat the bright and<br> holy One:<br> The Brahman who may know thee thus shall have the Gods<br> in his control.<br> 22 Beauty and Fortune are thy wives: each side of thee are<br> Day and Night.<br> The constellations are thy form: the Asvins are thine open<br> jaws.<br> Wishing, wish yonder world for me, wish that the Universe<br> be mine.</p>
