 <p>ENVELOPED by the Lord must be This Alleach thing that<br> moves on earth.<br> With that renounced enjoy thyself. Covet no wealth of<br> any man.<br> 2 One, only doing Karma here, should wish to live a hundred<br> years.<br> No way is there for thee but this. So Karma cleaveth not<br> to man.<br> 3 Aye, to the Asuras belong those worlds enwrapt in blinding<br> gloom.<br> To them, when life on earth is done, depart the men who<br> kill the Self.</p>

 <p>4 Motionless, one, swifter than Mindthe Devas failed to<br> oertake it speeding on before them.<br> It, standing still, outstrips the others running. Herein Both<br> Mâtarisvan stablish Action.<br> 5 It moveth; it is motionless. It is far distant; it is near.<br> It is within This All; and it surrounds This All externally.<br> 6 The man who in his Self beholds all creatures and all things<br> that be,<br> And in all beings sees his Self, thence doubts no longer,<br> ponders not.<br> 7 When, in the man who clearly knows, Self hath become all<br> things that are,</p>

 <p>What wilderment, what grief is there in him who sees the<br> One alone?<br> 8 He hath attained unto the Bright, Bodiless, Woundless,<br> Sinewless, the Pure which evil hath not pierced.<br> Far-sighted, wise, encompassing, he self-existent hath<br> prescribed aims, as propriety demands, unto the<br> everlasting Years.<br> 9 Deep into shade of blinding gloom fall Asambhûti's<br> worshippers.<br> They sink to darkness deeper yet who on Sambhûti are<br> intent.<br> 10 One fruit, they say, from Sambhava, another from Asambhava.<br> Thus from the sages have we heard who have declared this<br> lore to us.<br> 11 The man who knows Sambhûti and Vinâsa simultaneously,<br> He, by Vinâsa passing death, gains by Sambhûti endless life.</p>

 <p>12 To blinding darkness go the men who make a cult of<br> Nescience.<br> The devotees of Science enter darkness that is darker still.<br> 13 Different is the fruit, they say, of Science and of Nescience.<br> Thus from the sages have we heard who have declared this<br> lore to us.<br> 14 The man who knoweth well these two, Science and Nescience,<br> combined,<br> Oercoming death by Nescience by Science gaineth endless<br> life.<br> 15 My breath reach everlasting Air! In ashes let my body end.<br> OM! Mind, remember thou; remember thou my sphere;<br> remember thou my deeds.</p>

 <p>16 By goodly path lead us to riches, Agni, thou God who<br> knowest all our works and wisdom.<br> Remove the sin that makes us stray and wander: most<br> ample adoration will we bring thee.<br> 17 The Real's face is hidden by a vessel formed of golden light.<br> The Spirit yonder in the Sun, the Spirit dwelling there am I.<br> OM! Heaven! Brahma!</p>
