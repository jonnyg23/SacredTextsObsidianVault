 <p>1 I CRAVE help from the Imperial Lords, from Indra-Varuṇa; may they<br> Both favour one of us like me.<br> 2 Guardians of men, ye ever come with ready succour at the call<br> Of every singer such as I.<br> 3 Sate you, according to your wish, O Indra-Varuṇa, with wealth:<br> Fain would we have you nearest us.<br> 4 May we be sharers of the powers, sharers of the benevolence<br> Of you who give strength bounteously.<br> 5 Indra and Varuṇa, among givers of thousands, meet for praise,<br> Are Powers who merit highest laud.<br> 6 Through their protection may we gain great store of wealth, and heap it up<br> Enough and still to spare, be ours.<br> 7 O Indra-Varuṇa, on you for wealth in many a form I call:<br> Still keep ye us victorious.<br> 8 O Indra-Varuṇa, through our songs that seek to win you to ourselves,<br> Give us at once your sheltering help.<br> 9 O Indra-Varuṇa, to you may fair praise which I offer come,<br> Joint eulogy which ye dignify.</p>
