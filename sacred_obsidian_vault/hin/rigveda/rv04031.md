 <p>1. WITH what help will he come to us, wonderful, ever-waxing Friend;<br> With what most mighty company?<br> 2 What genuine and most liberal draught will spirit thee with juice to burst<br> Open een strongly-guarded wealth?<br> 3 Do thou who art Protector of us thy friends who praise thee<br> With hundred aids approach us.<br> 4 Like as a courser's circling wheel, so turn thee hitherward to us,<br> Attracted by the hymns of men.<br> 5 Thou seekest as it were thine own stations with swift descent of powers:<br> I share thee even with the Sun.<br> 6 What time thy courage and his wheels together, Indra, run their course<br> With thee and with the Sun alike,<br> 7 So even, Lord of Power and Might, the people call thee Maghavan,<br> Giver, who pauses not to think.<br> 8 And verily to him who toils and presses Soma juice for thee<br> Thou quickly givest ample wealth.<br> 9 No, not a hundred hinderers can check thy gracious bounty's flow,<br> Nor thy great deeds when thou wilt act.<br> 10 May thine assistance keep us safe, thy hundred and thy thousand aids:<br> May all thy favours strengthen us.<br> 11 Do thou elect us this place for friendship and prosperity,<br> And great celestial opulence.<br> 12 Favour us, Indra, evermore with overflowing store of wealth:<br> With all thy succours aid thou us.<br> 13 With new protections, Indra, like an archer, open thou for us<br> The stables that are filled with kine.<br> 14 Our chariot, Indra, boldly moves endued with splendour, neer repulsed,<br> Winning for us both kine and steeds.<br> 15 O Sūrya, make our fame to be most excellent among the Gods,<br> Most lofty as the heaven on high.</p>
