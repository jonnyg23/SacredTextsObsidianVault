 <p>1. To him, the far-renowned, the wise Ordainer, ancient and glorious, a song I offer.<br> Enthroned in oil, the Asura, bliss-giver, is Agni, firm support of noble, riches.<br> 2 By holy Law they kept supporting Order, by help of sacrifice, in loftiest heaven,<br> They who attained with born men to the unborn, men seated on that stay, heaven's firm sustainer.<br> 3 Averting woe, they labour hard to bring him, the ancient, plenteous food as power resistless.<br> May he, born newly, conquer his assailants: round him they stand as round an angry lion.<br> 4 When, like a mother, spreading forth to nourish, to cherish and regard each man that liveth,<br> Consuming all the strength that thou hast gotten, thou wanderest round, thyself, in varied fashion.<br> 5 May strength preserve the compass of thy vigour, God! that broad stream of thine that beareth riches.<br> Thou, like a thief who keeps his refuge secret, hast holpen Atri to great wealth, by teaching.</p>
