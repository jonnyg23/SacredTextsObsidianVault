 <p>1. YE, Waters, are beneficent: so help ye us to energy<br> That we may look on great delight.<br> 2 Give us a portion of the sap, the most auspicious that ye have,<br> Like mothers in their longing love.<br> 3 To you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye send us on;<br> And, Waters, give us procreant strength.<br> 4 The Waters. be to us for drink, Goddesses for our aid and bliss:<br> Let them stream to us health and strength.<br> 5 1 beg the Floods to give us balm, these Queens who rule oer precious things,<br> And have supreme control of men.<br> 6 Within the Waters-Soma thus hath told me-dwell all balms that heal,<br> And Agni, he who blesseth all.<br> 7 O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm,<br> So that I long may see the Sun.<br> 8 Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought,<br> If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me.<br> 9 The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come:<br> O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.</p>
