 <p>1. YOUR spy hath called to you to give prosperity. I sing to Heaven and Earth and offer sacrifice.<br> They bathe their steeds and hasten through the firmament: they spread abroad their radiance through the sea of cloud.<br> 2 Earth shakes and reels in terror at their onward rush, like a full ship which, quivering, lets the water in.<br> Marked on their ways are they, visible from afar: the Heroes press between in mighty armament.<br> 3 As the exalted horn of bulls for splendid might, as the Sun's eye set in the firmament's expanse,<br> Like vigorous horses ye are beauteous to behold, and for your glory show like bridegrooms, O ye Men.<br> 4 Who, O ye Maruts, may attain the mighty lore of you the mighty, who may reach your manly deeds?<br> Ye, verily, make earth tremble like a ray of light what time ye bring your boons to give prosperity,<br> 5 Like steeds of ruddy colour, scions of one race, as foremost champions they have battled in the van.<br> The Heroes have waxed strong like we.1grown manly youths; with floods of rain they make the Sun's eye fade away,<br> 6 Having no eldest and no youngest in their band, no middlomost, preeminent they have waxed in might,<br> These Sons of Pṛśni, sprung of noble ancestry: come hitberward to us, ye bridegrooms of the sky.<br> 7 Like birds of air they flew with might in lengthened lines from heaven's high ridges to the borders of the sky.<br> The steeds who carry them, as Gods and mortals know, have caused the waters of the mounuains to desGend.<br> 8 May Dyaus, the Infinite, roar for our banquet: may Dawns toil for us, glittering with moisture.<br> Lauded by thee, these Maruts, Sons o Rudra, O Ṛṣi, have sent down the heavenly treasure.</p>
