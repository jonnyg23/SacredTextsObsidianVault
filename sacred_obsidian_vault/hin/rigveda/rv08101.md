 <p>1. ENDOWED, O Gods, with your primeval wisdom, come quickly with your chariot, O ye Holy.<br> Come with your mighty powers, O ye Nāsatyas; come hither, drink ye this the third libation.<br> 2 The truthful Deities, the Three-and-Thirty, saw you approach before the Ever-Truthful.<br> Accepting this our worship and libation, O Aśvins bright with fire, drink ye the Soma.<br> 3 Aśvins, that work of yours deserves our wonder,the Bull of heaven and earth and air's mid region;<br> Yea, and your thousand promises in battle, -to all of these come near and drink beside us.<br> 4 Here is your portion laid for you, ye Holy: come to these songs of ours, O ye Nāsatyas.<br> Drink among us the Soma full of sweetness, and with your powers assist the man who worships.</p>
