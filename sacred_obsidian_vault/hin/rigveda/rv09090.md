 <p>1. URGED On, the Father of the Earth and Heaven hath gone forth like a car to gather booty,<br> Going to Indra, sharpening his weapons, and in his hand containing every treasure.<br> 2 To him the tones of sacred song have sounded, Steer of the triple height, the Life-bestower.<br> Dwelling in wood as Varuṇa in rivers, lavishing treasure he distributes blessings<br> 3 Great Conqueror, warnor-girt, Lord of all heroes, flow on thy way as he who winneth riches;<br> With sharpened. arms, with swift bow, never vanquished in battle, vanquishing in fight the foemen.<br> 4 Giving security, Lord of wide dominion, send us both earth and heaven with all their fulness.<br> Striving to win the Dawns, the light, the waters, and cattle, call to us abundant vigour.<br> 5 O Soma, gladden Varuṇa and Mitra; cheer, Indu Pavamana! Indra, Viṣṇu.<br> Cheer thou the Gods, the Company of Maruts: Indu, cheer mighty Indra to rejoicing.<br> 6 Thus like a wise and potent King flow onward, destroying with thy vigour all misfortunes.<br> For our well-spoken hymn give life, O Indu. Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
