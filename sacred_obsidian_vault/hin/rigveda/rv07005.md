 <p>1. BRING forth your song of praise to mighty Agni, the speedy messenger of earth and heaven,<br> Vaiśvānara, who, with those who wake, hath waxen great in the lap of all the Gods Immortal.<br> 2 Sought in the heavens, on earth is Agni stablished, leader of rivers, Bull of standing waters.<br> Vaiśvānara when he hath grown in glory, shines on the tribes of men with light and treasure.<br> 3 For fear of thee forth fled the dark-hued races, scattered abroad, deserting their possessions,<br> When, glowing, O Vaiśvānara, for Pūru, thou Agni didst light up and rend their castles.<br> 4 Agni Vaiśvānara, both Earth and Heaven submit them to thy threefold jurisdiction.<br> Refulgent in thine undecaying lustre thou hast invested both the worlds with splendour.<br> 5 Agni, the tawny horses, loudly neighing our resonant hymns that drop with oil, attend thee;<br> Lord of the tribes, our Charioteer of riches, Ensign of days, Vaiśvānara of mornings.<br> 6 In thee, O bright as Mitra, Vasus seated the might of Aduras, for they loved thy spirit.<br> Thou dravest Dasyus from their home, O Agni, and broughtest forth broad light to light the Ārya.<br> 7 Born in the loftiest heaven thou in a moment reachest, like wind, the place where Gods inhabit.<br> Thou, favouring thine offspring, roaredst loudly when giving life to creatures, Jātavedas.<br> 8 Send us that strength, Vaiśvānara, send it, Agni, that strength, O Jātavedas, full of splendour,<br> Wherewith, all-bounteous God, thou pourest riches, as fame wide-spreading, on the man who offers.<br> 9 Agni, bestow upon our chiefs and nobles that famous power, that wealth which feedeth many.<br> Accordant with the Vasus and the Rudras, Agni, Vaiśvānara, give us sure protection.</p>
