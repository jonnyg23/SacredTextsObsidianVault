 <p>1. BOTH boons,may Indra, hitherward turned, listen to this prayer of ours,<br> And mightiest Maghavan with thought inclined to us come near to drink the Soma juice.<br> 2 For him, strong, independent Ruler, Heaven and Earth have fashioned forth for power and might.<br> Thou seatest thee as first among thy peers in place, for thy soul longs for Soma juice.<br> 3 Fill thyself full, O Lord of wealth, O Indra, with the juice we shed.<br> We know thee, Lord of Bay Steeds victor in the fight, vanquishing een the invincible.<br> 4 Changeless in truth, O Maghavan Indra, let it be as thou in wisdom willest it.<br> May we, O fair of check, win booty with thine aid, O Thunderer, swiftly seeking it.<br> 5 Indra, with all thy saving helps give us assistance, Lord of power.<br> For after thee we follow even as glorious bliss, thee, Hero, finder-out of wealth.<br> 6 Increaser of our steeds and multiplying kine, a golden well, O God, art thou,<br> For no one may impair the gifts laid up in thee. Bring me whatever thing I ask.<br> 7 For thou,come to the worshipper!wilt find great wealth to make us rich.<br> Fill thyself full, O Maghavan, for gain of kine, full, Indra, for the gain of steeds.<br> 8 Thou as thy gift bestowest many hundred herds, yea, many thousands dost thou give.<br> With singers' hymns have we brought the Fort-render near, singing to Indra for his grace.<br> 9 Whether the simple or the sage, Indra, have offered praise to thee,<br> He Śatakratu! by his love hath gladdened thee, ambitious! ever pressing on!<br> 10 If he the Strong of arm, the breaker-down of forts, the great Destroyer, hear my call,<br> We, seeking riches cry to Indra, Lord of wealth, to Śatakratu with our lauds.<br> 11 We count not then as sinners, nor as niggardly or foolish men,<br> When with the Soma juice which we have shed we make Indra, the Mighty One, our Friend.<br> 12 Him have we yoked in fight, the powerful Conqueror, debt-claimer, not to be deceived.<br> Best charioteer, the Victor marks each fault, he knows the strong to whom he will come near.<br> 13 Indra, give us security from that whereof we are afraid.<br> Help us, O Maghavan, let thy succour give us this: drive away foes and enemies.<br> 14 For thou, O liberal Lord of bounty, strengthenest his ample home who worships thee.<br> So Indra, Maghavan, thou Lover of the Song, we with pressed Soma call on thee,<br> 15 Indra is Vṛtra-slayer, guard, our best defender from the foe.<br> May he preserve our last and middlemost, and keep watch from behind us and before.<br> 16 Defend us from behind, below, above, in front, on all sides, Indra, shield us well.<br> Keep far away from us the terror sent from heaven: keep impious weapons far away.<br> 17 Protect us, Indra, each to-day, each morrow, and each following day.<br> Our singers, through all days, shalt thou, Lord of the brave, keep safely both by day and night.<br> 18 A crushing Warrior, passing rich is Maghavan, endowed with all heroic might.<br> Thine arms, O Śatakratu, are exceeding strong, arms which have grasped the thunderbolt.</p>
