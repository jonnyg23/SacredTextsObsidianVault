 <p>1. WE will invoke this day your car, far-spreading, O Aśvins, even the gathering, of the sunlight,<br> Car praised in hymns, most ample, rich in treasure, fitted with seats, the car that beareth Sūrya.<br> 2 Aśvins, ye gained that glory by your Godhead, ye Sons of Heaven, by your own might and power.<br> Food followeth close upon your bright appearing when stately horses in your chariot draw you.<br> 3 Who bringeth you to-day for help with offered oblation, or with hymns to drink the juices?<br> Who, for the sacrifice's ancient lover, turneth you hither, Aśvins, offering homage?<br> 4 Borne on your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice of ours, Nāsatyas.<br> Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma give riches to the people who adore you.<br> 5 Come hitherward to us from earth, from heaven, borne on your golden chariot rolling lightly.<br> Suffer not other worshippers to stay you here are ye bound by earlier bonds of friendship.<br> 6 Now for us both, mete out, O Wonder-Workers, riches exceeding great with store of heroes,<br> Because the men have sent you praise, O Aśvins, and Ajamīlhas come to the laudation.<br> 7 Wheneer I gratified you here together, your grace was given us, O ye rich in booty.<br> Protect, ye Twain, the singer of your praises: to you, Nāsatyas, is my wish directed.</p>
