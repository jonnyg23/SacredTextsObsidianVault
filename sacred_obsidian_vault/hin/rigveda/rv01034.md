 <p>1 Ye who observe this day be with us even thrice: far-stretching is you bounty, Aśvins and your course.<br> To you, as to a cloak in winter, we cleave close: you are to be drawn nigh unto us by the wise.<br> 2 Three are the fellies in your honey-bearing car, that travels after Soma's loved one, as all know.<br> Three are the pillars set upon it for support: thrice journey ye by night, O Aśvins, thrice by day.<br> 3 Thrice in the self-same day, ye Gods who banish want, sprinkle ye thrice to-day our sacrifice with meath;<br> And thrice vouchsafe us store of food with plenteous strength, at evening, O ye Aśvins, and at break of day.<br> 4 Thrice come ye to our home, thrice to the righteous folk, thrice triply aid the man who well deserves your help.<br> Thrice, O ye Aśvins, bring us what shall make us glad; thrice send us store of food as nevermore to fail.<br> 5 Thrice, O ye Aśvins, bring to us abundant wealth: thrice in the Gods assembly, thrice assist our thoughts.<br> Thrice, grant ye us prosperity, thrice grant us fame; for the Sun's daughter hath mounted your three-wheeled car.<br> 6 Thrice, Aśvins, grant to us the heavenly medicines, thrice those of earth and thrice those that the waters hold,<br> Favour and health and strength bestow upon my son; triple protection, Lords of Splendour, grant to him.<br> 7 Thrice are ye to be worshipped day by day by us: thrice, O ye Aśvins, ye travel around the earth.<br> Car-borne from far away, O ye Nāsatyas, come, like vital air to bodies, come ye to the three.<br> 8 Thrice, O ye Aśvins, with the Seven Mother Streams; three are the jars, the triple offering is prepared.<br> Three are the worlds, and moving on above the sky ye guard the firm-set vault of heaven through days and nights.<br> 9 Where are the three wheels of your triple chariot, where are the three seats thereto firmly fastened?<br> When will ye yoke the mighty ass that draws it, to bring you to our sacrifice. Nāsatyas?<br> 10 Nāsatyas, come: the sacred gift is offered up; drink the sweet juice with lips that know the sweetness well.<br> Savitar sends, before the dawn of day, your car, fraught with oil, various-coloured, to our sacrifice.<br> 11 Come, O Nāsatyas, with the thrice-eleven Gods; come, O ye Aśvins, to the drinking of the meath.<br> Make long our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off our enemies; be with us evermore.<br> 12 Borne in your triple car, O Aśvins, bring us present prosperity with noble offspring.<br> I cry to you who hear me for protection be ye our helpers where men win the booty.</p>
