 <p>1. THESE songs of mine go forth as lauds of Agni, the disposing Sage,<br> Whose worshipper is neer oerthrown.<br> 2 Wise Agni Jātavedas, I beget a song of praise for thee.<br> Who willingly receivest it.<br> 3 Thy sharpened flames, O Agni, like the gleams of light that glitter through,<br> Devour the forests with their teeth.<br> 4 Gold-coloured, bannered with the smoke, urged by the wind, aloft to heaven<br> Rise, lightly borne, the flames of fire.<br> 5 These lightly kindled fiery flames are all around made visible,<br> Even as the gleanings of the Dawns.<br> 6 As Jātavedas speeds along, the dust is black beneath his feet,<br> When Agni spreads upon the earth.<br> 7 Making the plants his nourishment, Agni devours and wearies not,<br> Seeking the tender shrubs again.<br> 8 Bending him down with all his tongues, he flickers with his fiery glow<br> Splendid is Agni in the woods.<br> 9 Agni, thine home is in the floods: into the plants thou forcest way,<br> And as their Child art born anew.<br> 10 Worshipped with offerings shines thy flame, O Agni, from the sacred oil,<br> With kisses on the ladle's mouth.<br> 11 Let us serve Agni with our hymns, Disposer, fed on ox and cow,<br> Who bears the Soma on his back.<br> 12 Yea, thee, O Agni, do we seek with homage and with fuel, Priest<br> Whose wisdom is most excellent.<br> 13 O worshipped with oblations, pure Agni, we call on thee as erst,<br> Did Bhṛgu, Manus, Aṅgiras.<br> 14 For thou, O Agni, by the fire, Sage by the Sage, Good by the Good,<br> Friend by the Friend, art lighted up.<br> 15 So wealth in thousands, food with store of heroes give thou to the sage,<br> O Agni, to the worshipper.<br> 16 O Agni, Brother, made by strength, Lord of red steeds and brilliant sway,<br> Take pleasure in this laud of mine.<br> 17 My praises, Agni, go to thee, as the cows seek the stall to meet,<br> The lowing calf that longs for milk.<br> 18 Agni, best Aṅgiras, to thee all people who have pleasant homes,<br> Apart, have turned as to their wish.<br> 19 The sages skilled in holy song and thinkers with their thoughts have urged<br> Agni to share the sacred feast.<br> 20 So, Agni, unto thee the Priest, Invoker, strong in forays, pray<br> Those who spin out the sacrifice.<br> 21 In many a place, the same in look art thou, a Prince oer all the tribes<br> In battles we invoke thine aid.<br> 22 Pray thou to Agni, pray to him who blazes served with sacred oil:<br> Let him give ear to this our call.<br> 23 We call on thee as such, as one who hears, as Jātavedas, one,<br> Agni! who beats away our foes.<br> 24 I pray to Agni, King of men, the Wonderful, the President<br> Of holy Laws: may he give ear.<br> 25 Him like a bridegroom, him who stirs all people, like a noble horse,<br> Like a fleet steed, we instigate.<br> 26 Slaying things deadly, burning up foes, Rākṣasas, on every side,<br> Shine, Agni, with thy sharpened flame.<br> 27 Thou whom the people kindle even as Manus did, best Aṅgiras!<br> O Agni, mark thou this my speech.<br> 28 O Agni, made by strength! be thou born in the heavens or born in floods,<br> As such we call on thee with songs.<br> 29 Yea, all the people, all the folk who have good dwellings, each apart,<br> Send food for thee to eat thereof.<br> 30 O Agni, so may we, devout, gazed at by men, throughout our days,<br> Pass lightly over all distress.<br> 31 We venerate with cheerful hearts the cheerful Agni, dear to all,<br> Burning, with purifying flame.<br> 32 So thou, O Agni rich in light, beaming like Sūrya with thy rays<br> Boldly demolishest the gloom,<br> 33 We pray to thee for this thy gift, Victor the gift that faileth not,<br> O Agni, choicest wealth from thee.</p>
