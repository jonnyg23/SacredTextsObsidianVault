 <p>1 THE other fires are, verily, thy branches; the Immortals all rejoice in thee, O Agni.<br> Centre art thou, Vaiśvānara, of the people, sustaining men like a deep-founded pillar.<br> 2 The forehead of the sky, earth's centre, Agni became the messenger of earth and heaven.<br> Vaiśvānara, the Deities produced thee, a God, to be a light unto the Ārya.<br> 3 As in the Sun firm rays are set for ever, treasures are in Vaiśvānara, in Agni.<br> Of all the riches in the hills, the waters, the herbs, among mankind, thou art the Sovran.<br> 4 As the great World-halves, so are their Son's praises; skilled, as a man, to act, is he the Herald.<br> Vaiśvānara, celestial, truly mighty, most manly One, hath many a youthful consort.<br> 5 Even the lofty heaven, O Jātavedas Vaiśvānara, hath not attained thy greatness.<br> Thou art the King of lands where men are settled, thou hast brought comfort to the Gods in battle.<br> 6 Now will I tell the greatness of the Hero whom Pūru's sons follow as Vṛtra's slayer:<br> Agni Vaiśvānara struck down the Dasyu, cleave Śambara through and shattered down his fences.<br> 7 Vaiśvānara, dwelling by his might with all men, far-shining, holy mid the Bharadvājas,<br> Is lauded, excellent, with hundred praises by Purūṇītha, son of Śatavani.</p>
