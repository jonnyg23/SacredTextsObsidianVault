 <p>1. No peril, no severe distress, ye Gods, affects the mortal man,<br> Whom Aryaman and Mitra lead, and Varima, of one accord, beyond his foes.<br> 2 This very thing do we desire, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,<br> Whereby ye guhrd the mortal man from sore distress, and lead him safe beyond his foes.<br> 3 These are, each one, our present helps, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.<br> Best leaders, best deliverers to lead us on and bear as safe beyond our foes.<br> 4 Ye compass round and guard each man, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:<br> In your dear keeping may we be, ye who are excellent as guides beyond our foes.<br> 5 Ādityas are beyond all foes,Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:<br> Strong Rudra with the Marut host, Indra, Agni let us call for weal beyond our foes.<br> 6 These lead us safely over all, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,<br> These who are Kings of living men, over all troubles far away beyond our foes.<br> 7 May they give bliss to aid us well, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:<br> May the Ādityas, when we pray, grant us wide shelter and defence beyond our foes.<br> 8 As in this place, O Holy Ones, ye Vasus freed even the Gaud when her feet were fettered.<br> So free us now from trouble and affliction: and let our life be lengthened still, O Api.</p>
