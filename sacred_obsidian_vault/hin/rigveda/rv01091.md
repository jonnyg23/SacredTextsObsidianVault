 <p>1. Thou, Soma, art preeminent for wisdom; along the straightest path thou art our leader.<br> Our wise forefathers by thy guidance, Indu, dealt out among the Gods their share of treasure.<br> 2 Thou by thine insight art most wise, O Soma, strong by thine energies and all possessing,<br> Mighty art thou by all thy powers and greatness, by glories art thou glorious, guide of mortals.<br> 3 Thine are King Varuṇa's eternal statutes, lofty and deep, O Soma, is thy glory.<br> All-pure art thou like Mitra the beloved, adorable, like Aryaman, O Soma.<br> 4 With all thy glories on the earth, in heaven, on mountains, in the plants, and in the waters,<br> With all of these, well-pleased and not in anger, accept, O royal Soma, our oblations.<br> 5 Thou, Soma, art the Lord of heroes, King, yea, Vṛtra-slayer thou:<br> Thou art auspicious energy.<br> 6 And, Soma, let it be thy wish that we may live and may not die:<br> Praise-loving Lord of plants art thou.<br> 7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness,<br> And energy that he may live.<br> 8 Guard us, King Soma, on all sides from him who threatens us: never let<br> The friend of one like thee be harmed.<br> 9 With those delightful aids which thou hast, Soma, for the worshipper,<br> Even with those protect thou us.<br> 10 Accepting this our sacrifice and this our praise, O Soma, come,<br> And be thou nigh to prosper us.<br> 11 Well-skilled in speech we magnify thee, Soma, with our sacred songs:<br> Come thou to us, most gracious One.<br> 12 Enricher, healer of disease, wealth-finder, prospering our store,<br> Be, Soma, a good Friend to us.<br> 13 Soma, be happy in our heart, as milch-kine in the grassy meads,<br> As a young man in his own house.<br> 14 O Soma, God, the mortal man who in thy friendship hath delight,<br> Him doth the mighty Sage befriend.<br> 15 Save us from slanderous reproach, keep us., O Soma, from distress:<br> Be unto us a gracious Friend.<br> 16 Soma, wax great. From every side may vigorous powers unite in thee:<br> Be in the gathering-place of strength.<br> 17 Wax, O most gladdening Soma, great through all thy rays of light, and be<br> A Friend of most illustrious fame to prosper us.<br> 16 In thee be juicy nutriments united, and powers and mighty foe-subduing vigour,<br> Waxing to immortality, O Soma: win highest glories for thyself in heaven.<br> 19 Such of thy glories as with poured oblations men honour, may they all invest our worship.<br> Wealth-giver, furtherer with troops of heroes, sparing the brave, come, Soma, to our houses.<br> 20 To him who worships Soma gives the milch-cow, a fleet steed and a man of active knowledge,<br> Skilled in home duties, meet for holy synod, for council meet, a glory to his father.<br> 21 Invincible in fight, saver in battles, guard of our camp, winner of light and water,<br> Born amid hymns, well-housed, exceeding famous, victor, in thee will we rejoice, O Soma.<br> 22 These herbs, these milch-kine, and these running waters, all these, O Soma, thou hast generated.<br> The spacious firmament hast thou expanded, and with the light thou hast dispelled the darkness.<br> 23 Do thou, God Soma, with thy Godlike spirit, victorious, win for us a share of riches.<br> Let none prevent thee: thou art Lord of valour. Provide for both sides in the fray for booty.</p>
