 <p>1. AGNI, your dearest Guest, I laud, him who is loving as a friend,<br> Who brings us riches like a car.<br> 2 Whom as a far-foreseeing Sage the Gods have, from the olden time,<br> Established among mortal men.<br> 3 Do thou, Most Youthful God, protect the men who offer, hear their songs,<br> And of thyself preserve their seed.<br> 4 What is the praise wherewith, O God, Aṅgiras, Agni, Son of Strength,<br> We, after thine own wish and thought,<br> 5 May serve thee, O thou Child of Power, and with what sacrifice's plan?<br> What prayer shall I now speak to thee?<br> 6 Our God, make all of us to dwell in happy habitations, and<br> Reward our songs with spoil and wealth.<br> 7 Lord of the house, what plenty fills the songs which thou inspirest now,<br> Thou whose hymn helps to win the kine?<br> 8 Hirn Wise and Strong they glorify, the foremost Champion in the fray,<br> And mighty in his dwelling-place.<br> 9 Agni, he dwells in rest and peace who smites and no one smites again:<br> With hero sons he prospers well</p>
