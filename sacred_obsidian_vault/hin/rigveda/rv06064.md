 <p>1. THE radiant Dawns have risen up for glory, in their white splendour like the waves of waters.<br> She maketh paths all easy, fair to travel, and, rich, hath shown herself benign and friendly.<br> 2 We see that thou art good: far shines thy lustre; thy beams, thy splendours have flown up to heaven.<br> Decking thyself, thou makest bare thy bosom, shining in majesty, thou Goddess Morning.<br> 3 Red are the kine and luminous that bear her the Blessed One who spreadeth through the distance.<br> The foes she chaseth like a valiant archer, like a swift warrior she repelleth darkness.<br> 4 Thy ways are easy on the hills: thou passest Invincible! Se1f-luminous! through waters.<br> So lofty Goddess with thine ample pathway, Daughter of Heaven, bring wealth to give us comfort.<br> 5 Dawn, bring me wealth: untroubled, with thine oxen thou bearest riches at thy will and pleasure;<br> Thou who, a Goddess, Child of Heaven, hast shown thee lovely through bounty when we called thee early.<br> 6 As the birds fly forth from their restingplaces, so men with store of food rise at thy dawning.<br> Yea, to the liberal mortal who rernaineth at home, O Goddess Dawn, much good thou bringest.</p>
