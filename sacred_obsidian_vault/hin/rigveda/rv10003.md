 <p>1. O KING, the potent and terrific envoy, kindled for strength, is manifest in beauty.<br> He shines, all-knowing, with his lotty splendour: chasing black Night he comes with white-rayed Morning.<br> 2 Having oercome the glimmering Black with beauty, and bringing forth the dame the Great Sire's Daughter,<br> Holding aloft the radiant light of Sūrya, as messenger of heaven he shines with treasures.<br> 3 Attendant on the Blessed Dame the Blessed hath come: the Lover followeth his Sister.<br> Agni, far-spreading with conspicuous lustre, hath compassed Night with whitelyshining garments.<br> 4 His goings-forth kindle as twere high voices the goings of the auspicious Friend of Agni.<br> The rays, the bright beams of the strong-jawed, mighty, adorable Steer are visible as he cometh.<br> 5 Whose radiant splendours flow, like sounds, about us, his who is lofty, brilliant, and effulgent,<br> Who reaches heaven with best and brightest lustres, sportive and piercing even to the summit.<br> 6 His powers, whose chariot fellies gleam and glitter have loudly roared while, as with teams, he hasted.<br> He, the most Godlike, far-extending envoy, shines with flames ancient, resonant, whitely-shining.<br> 7 So bring us ample wealth: seat thee as envoy of the two youthful Matrons, Earth and Heaven.<br> Let Agni rapid with his rapid, horses, impetuous with impetuous Steeds, come hither.</p>
