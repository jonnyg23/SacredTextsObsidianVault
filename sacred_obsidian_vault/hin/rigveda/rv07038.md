 <p>1. ON high hath Savitar, this God, extended the golden lustre which he spreads around him.<br> Now, now must Bhaga be invoked by mortals, Lord of great riches who distributes treasures.<br> 2 Rise up, O Savitar whose hands are golden, and hear this man while sacrifice is offered,<br> Spreading afar thy broad and wide effulgence, and bringing mortal men the food that feeds them.<br> 3 Let Savitar the God he hymned with praises, to whom the Vasus, even, all sing glory.<br> Sweet be our lauds to him whose due is worship: may he with all protection guard our princes.<br> 4 Even he whom Aditi the Goddess praises, rejoicing in God Savitar's incitement:<br> Even he who praise the high imperial Rulers, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, sing in concert.<br> 5 They who come emulous to our oblation, dispensing bounty, from the earth and heaven.<br> May they and Ahibudhnya hear our calling: guard us Varūtrī with the Ekadhenus.<br> 6 This may the Lord of Life, entreated, grant us,the wealth which Savitar the God possesses.<br> The mighty calls on Bhaga for protection, on Bhaga calls the weak to give him riches.<br> 7 Bless us the Vajins when we call, while slowly they move, strong Singers, to the Gods assembly.<br> Crushing the wolf, the serpent, and the demons, may they completely banish all affliction.<br> 8 Deep-skilled in Law eternal, deathless, Singers, O Vajins, help us in each fray for booty.<br> Drink of this meath, he satisfied, be joyful: then go on paths which Gods are wont to travel.</p>
