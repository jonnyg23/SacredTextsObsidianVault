 <p>1 WHAT shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently wise,<br> That shall be dearest to his heart?<br> 2 That Aditi may grant the grace of Rudra to our folk, our kine,<br> Our cattle and our progeny;<br> 3 That Mitra and that Varuṇa, that Rudra may remember us,<br> Yea, all the Gods with one accord.<br> 4 To Rudra Lord of sacrifice, of hymns and balmy medicines,<br> We pray for joy and health and strength.<br> 5 He shines in splendour like the Sun, refulgent as bright gold is he,<br> The good, the best among the Gods.<br> 6 May he grant health into our steeds, wellbeing to our rams and ewes,<br> To men, to women, and to kine.<br> 7 O Soma, set thou upon us the glory of a hundred men,<br> The great renown of mighty chiefs.<br> 8 Let not malignities, nor those who trouble Soma, hinder us.<br> Indu, give us a share of strength.<br> 9 Soma! head, central point, love these; Soma! know these as serving thee,<br> Children of thee Immortal, at the highest place of holy law.</p>
