 <p>1. HERE by ordainers was this God appointed first Invoker, best at worship, to be praised at rites:<br> Whom Apnavāna, and the Bhṛgus caused to shine bright-coloured in the wood, spreading from home to home.<br> 2 When shall thy glory as a God, Agni, be suddenly shown forth.<br> For mortal men have held thee fast, adorable in all their homes,<br> 3 Seeing thee faithful to the Law, most sapient, like the starry heaven,<br> Illumining with cheerful ray each solemn rite in every house.<br> 4 Vivasvān's envoy living men have taken as their ensign, swift,<br> The ruler over all mankind, moving like Bhṛgu in each home.<br> 5 Him the intelligent have they placed duly as Invoking Priest,<br> Welcome, with sanctifying flame, best worshipper, with sevenfold might;<br> 6 In his Eternal Mothers, in the wood, concealed and unapproached,<br> Kept secret though his flames are bright seeking on all sides, quickly found.<br> 7 That as food spreads forth in this earthly udder, Gods may rejoice them in the home of Order,<br> Great Agni, served with reverence and oblation, flies ever to the sacrifice, the Faithful.<br> 8 Bird of each rite, skilled in an envoy's duties, knowing both worlds and that which lies between them,<br> Thou goest from of old a willing Herald, knowing full well heaven's innermost recesses.<br> 9 Bright God, thy path is black: light is before thee: thy moving splendour is the chief of wonders.<br> When she, yet unimpregnate, hath conceived thee, even when newly born thou art an envoy.<br> 10 Yet newly born, his vigour is apparent when the wind blows upon his fiery splendour,<br> His sharpened tongue he layeth on the brushwood, and with his teeth een solid food consumeth.<br> 11 When he hath borne off food with swift flame swiftly, strong Agni makes himself a speedy envoy,<br> Follows the rustling of the wind, consuming, and courser-like, speeds, drives the swift horse onward.</p>
