 <p>1. THIS is that Agni, he by whose protection, favour, and help. the singer is successful;<br> Who with the noblest flames of glowing fuel comes forth encompassed with far-spreading lustre.<br> 2 Agni, the Holy One, the everlasting, who shines far beaming with celestial splendours;<br> He who hath come unto his friends with friendship, like a fleet steed who never trips or stumbles.<br> 3 He who is Lord of all divine oblation, shared by all living men at break of morning,<br> Agni to whom our offerings are devoted, in whom rests he whose car, through might, is scatheless.<br> 4 Increasing by his strength. while lauds content him, with easy flight unto the Gods he travels.<br> Agni the cheerful Priest, best Sacrificer, balms with his tongue the Gods with whom he mingles.<br> 5 With songs and adorations bring ye hither Agni who stirs himself at dawn like Indra,<br> Whom sages laud with hymns as Jātavedas of those who wield the sacrificial ladle.<br> 6 In whom all goodly treasures meet together, even as steeds and riders for the booty.<br> Inclining hither bring us help, O Agni, even assistance most desired by Indra.<br> 7 Yea, at thy birth, when thou hadst sat in glory, thou, Agni, wast the aim of invocations.<br> The Gods came near, obedient to thy sunimons, and thus attained their rank as chief Protectors.</p>
