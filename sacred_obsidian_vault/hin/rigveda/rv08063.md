 <p>1. EXERTING all our strength with thoughts of power we glorify in speech<br> Agni your dear familiar Friend, the darling Guest in every home.<br> 2 Whom, served with sacrificial oil like Mitra, men presenting gifts<br> Eulogize with their songs of praise<br> 3 Much-lauded Jātavedas, him who bears oblations up to heaven<br> Prepared in service of the Gods.<br> 4 To noblest Agni, Friend of man, best Vṛtra-slayer, are we come,<br> Him in whose presence Rksa's son, mighty Srutarvan, waxes great;<br> 5 To deathless Jātavedas, meet for praise, adored, with sacred oil,<br> Visible through the gloom of night<br> 6 Even Agni whom these priestly men worship with sacrificial gifts,<br> With lifted ladles offering them.<br> 7 O Agni, this our newest hymn hath been addressed from us to thee,<br> O cheerful Guest, well-born, most wise, worker of wonders, neer deceived.<br> 8 Agni, may it be dear to thee, most grateful, and exceeding sweet:<br> Grow mightier, eulogized therewith.<br> 9 Splendid with splendours may it be, and in the battle with the foe<br> Add loftier glory to thy fame.<br> 10 Steed, cow, a lord of heroes, bright like Indra, who shall fill the car.<br> Whose high renown ye celebrate, and people praise each glorious deed.<br> 11 Thou whom Gopavana made glad with song, O Agni Aṅgiras,<br> Hear this my call, thou Holy One.<br> 12 Thou whom the priestly folk implore to aid the gathering of the spoil,<br> Such be thou in the fight with foes.<br> 13 I, called to him who reels with joy, Srutarvan, Rksa's son, shall stroke<br> The heads of four presented steeds, like the long wool of fleecy rams.<br> 14 Four coursers with a splendid car, Savistha's horses, fleet of foot,<br> Shall bring me to the sacred feast, as flying steeds brought Tugra's son.<br> 15 The very truth do I declare to thee, Paruṣṇī, mighty flood.<br> Waters! no man is there who gives more horses than Savistha gives.</p>
