 <p>1. To Agni, to this God of yours I sing aloud with utmost power.<br> May he come to us with the Gods, and sit, best Offerer, on the grass.<br> 2 The Holy, whose are earth and heaven, and succour waits upon his strength;<br> Him men who bring oblations laud, and they who wish to gain, for grace.<br> 3 He is the Sage who guides these men, Leader of sacred rites is he.<br> Him your own Agni, serve ye well, who winneth and bestoweth wealth.<br> 4 So may the gracious Agni grant most goodly shelter for our use;<br> Whence in the heavens or in the floods he shall pour wealth upon our lands.<br> 5 The singers kindle him, the Priest, Agni the Lord of tribes of men,<br> Resplendent and without a peer through his own excellent designs.<br> 6 Help us, thou Brahman, best of all invokers of the Gods in song.<br> Beam, Friend of Maruts, bliss on us, O Agni, a most liberal God.<br> 7 Yea, grant us treasure thousandfold with children and with nourishment,<br> And, Agni, splendid hero strength, exalted, wasting not away.</p>
