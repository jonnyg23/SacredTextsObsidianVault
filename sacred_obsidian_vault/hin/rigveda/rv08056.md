 <p>1. Now pray we to these Ksatriyas, to the Ādityas for their aid,<br> These who are gracious to assist.<br> 2 May Mitra bear us oer distress, and Varuṇa and Aryaman,<br> Yea, the Ādityas, as they know.<br> 3 For wonderful and meet for praise is these Ādityas saving help<br> To him who offers and prepares.<br> 4 The mighty aid of you, the Great, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,<br> We claim to be our sure defence.<br> 5 Guard us, Ādityas, still alive, before the deadly weapon strike:<br> Are yc not they who hear our call?<br> 6 What sheltering defence ye have for him who toils in pouring gifts,<br> Graciously bless ye us therewith.<br> 7 Ādityas, Gods, from sorrow there is freedom; for the sinless, wealth,<br> O ye in whom no fault is seen.<br> 8 Let not this fetter bind us fast: may he release us for success;<br> For strong is Indra and renowned.<br> 9 O Gods who fain would lend your aid, destroy not us as ye destroy<br> Your enemies who go astray.<br> 10 And thee too, O Great Aditi, thee also, Goddess, I address,<br> Thee very gracious to assist.<br> 11 Save us in depth and shallow from the foe, thou Mother of Strong Sons<br> Let no one of our seed be harmed.<br> 12 Far-spread! wide-ruling! grant that we, unharmed by envy, may expand<br> Grant that our progeny may live.<br> 13 Those who, the Princes of the folk, in native glory, neer deceived,<br> Maintain their statutes, void of guile<br> 14 As such, from mouth of ravening wolves, O ye Ādityas, rescue us,<br> Like a bound thief, O Aditi.<br> 15 Ādityas, let this arrow, yea, let this malignity depart<br> From us or eer it strike us dead.<br> 16 For, Bountiful Ādityas, we have evermore enjoyed your help,<br> Both now and in die days of old.<br> 17 To every one, O ye Most Wise, who turneth even from sin to you,<br> Ye Gods vouchsafe that he may live.<br> 18 May this new mercy profit us, which, ye Ādityas, frees like one,<br> Bound from his bonds, O Aditi.<br> 19 O ye Ādityas, this your might is not to be despised by us:<br> So be ye graciously inclined.<br> 20 Let not Vivasvān's weapon nor the shaft, Ādityas, wrought with skill,<br> Destroy us ere old age be nigh.<br> 21 On every side dispel all sin, Ādityas, all hostility,<br> Indigence, and combined attack.</p>
