 <p>1. STONE-DARTING Indra. Wondrous One, what wealth is richly given from thee,<br> That bounty, Treasure-Finder! bring filling both thy hands, to us.<br> 2 Bring what thou deemest worth the wish, O Indra, that which is in heaven.<br> So may we know thee as thou art, boundless in thy munificence.<br> 3 Thy lofty spirit, far-renowned as fain to give and prompt to win,<br> With this thou rendest een the firm, Stone-Darter! so to gain thee strength.<br> 4 Singers with many songs have made Indra propitious to their fame,<br> Him who is King of human kind, most liberal of your wealthy ones.<br> 5 To him, to Indra must be sung the poet's word, the hymn of praise.<br> To him, accepter of the prayer, the Atris raise their songs on high, the Atris beautify their songs.</p>
