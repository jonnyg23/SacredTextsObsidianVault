 <p>1. AGNI the Herald, like a horse, is led forth at our solemn rite,<br> God among Gods adorable.<br> 2 Three times unto our solemn rite comes Agni like a charioteer,<br> Bearing the viands to the Gods.<br> 3 Round the oblations hath he paced, Agni the Wise, the Lord of Strength,<br> Giving the offerer precious boons.<br> 4 He who is kindled eastward for Sṛñjaya, Devāvata's son,<br> Resplendent, tamer of the foe.<br> 5 So mighty be the Agni whom the mortal hero shall command,<br> With sharpened teeth and bountiful.<br> 6 Day after day they dress him, as they clean a horse who wins the prize.<br> Dress the red Scion of the Sky.<br> 7 When Sahadeva's princely son with two bay horses thought of me,<br> Summoned by him I drew not back.<br> 8 And truly those two noble bays I straightway took when offered me,<br> From Sahadeva's princely son.<br> 9 Long, O ye Aśvins, may he live, your care, ye Gods, the princely son.<br> Of Sahadeva, Somaka.<br> 10 Cause him the youthful prince, the son of Sahadeva, to enjoy<br> Long life, O Aśvins, O ye Gods.</p>
