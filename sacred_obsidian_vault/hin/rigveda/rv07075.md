 <p>1. BORN in the heavens the Dawn hath flushed, and showing her majesty is come as Law ordaineth.<br> She hath uncovered fiends and hateful darkness; best of Aṅgirases, hath waked the pathways.<br> 2 Rouse us this day to high and happy fortune: to great felicity, O Dawn, promote us.<br> Vouchsafe us manifold and splendid riches, famed among mortals, man-befriending Goddess!<br> 3 See, lovely Morning's everlasting splendours, bright with their varied colours, have approached us.<br> Filling the region of mid-air, producing the rites of holy worship, they have mounted.<br> 4 She yokes her chariot far away, and swiftly visits the lands where the Five Tribes are settled,<br> Looking upon the works and ways of mortals, Daughter of Heaven, the world's Imperial Lady.<br> 5 She who is rich in spoil, the Spouse of Sūrya, wondrously opulent, rules all wealth and treasures.<br> Consumer of our youth, the seers extol her: lauded by priests rich Dawn shines out refulgent.<br> 6 Apparent are the steeds of varied colour, the red steeds carrying resplendent Morning.<br> On her all-lovely car she comes, the Fair One, and brings rich treasure for her faithful servant.<br> 7 True with the True and Mighty with the Mighty, with Gods a Goddess, Holy with the Holy,<br> She brake strong fences down and gave the cattle: the kine were lowing as they greeted Morning.<br> 8 O Dawn, now give us wealth in kine and heroes, and horses, fraught with manifold enjoyment.<br> Protect our sacred grass from man's reproaches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
