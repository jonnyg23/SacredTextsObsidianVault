 <p>1. ADVANCING, sending forth her rays, the Daughter of the Sky is seen.<br> Uncovering, that we may see, the mighty gloom, the friendly Lady makes the light.<br> 2 The Sun ascending, the refulgent Star, pours down his beams together with the Dawn.<br> O Dawn, at thine arising, and the Sun's, may we attain the share allotted us.<br> 3 Promptly we woke to welcome thee, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky,<br> Thee, Bounteous One, who bringest all we long to have, and to the offerer health and wealth.<br> 4 Thou, dawning, workest fain to light the great world, yea, heaven, Goddess! that it may be seen.<br> We yearn to be thine own, Dealer of Wealth: may we be to this Mother like her sons.<br> 5 Bring us that wondrous bounty, Dawn, that shall be famed most far away.<br> What, Child of Heaven, thou hast of nourishment for man, bestow thou on us to enjoy.<br> 6 Give to our princes opulence and immortal fame, and strength in herds of kine to us.<br> May she who prompts the wealthy, Lady of sweet strains, may Uṣas dawn our foes away.</p>
