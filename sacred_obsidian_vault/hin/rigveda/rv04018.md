 <p>1. THIS is the ancient and accepted pathway by which all Gods have come into existence.<br> Hereby could one be born though waxen mighty. Let him not, otherwise, destroy his Mother.<br> 2 Not this way go I forth: hard is the passage. Forth from the side obliquely will I issue.<br> Much that is yet undone must I accomplish; one must I combat and the other question.<br> 3 He bent his eye upon the dying Mother: My word I now withdraw. That way I follow.<br> In Tvaṣṭar's dwelling India drank the Soma, a hundredworth of juice pressed from the mortar.<br> 4 What strange act shall he do, he whom his Mother bore for a thousand months and many autumns?<br> No peer hath he among those born already, nor among those who shall be born hereafter.<br> 5 Deeming him a reproach, his mother hid him, Indra, endowed with all heroic valour.<br> Then up he sprang himself, assumed his vesture, and filled, as soon as born, the earth and heaven.<br> 6 With lively motion onward flow these waters, the Holy Ones, shouting, as twere, together.<br> Ask them to. tell thee what the floods are saying, what girdling rock the waters burst asunder.<br> 7 Are they addressing him with words of welcome? Will the floods take on them the shame of Indra?<br> With his great thunderbolt my Son hath slaughtered Vṛtra, and set these rivers free to wander.<br> 8 I cast thee from me, mine,thy youthful mother: thee, mine own offspring, Kusava hath swallowed.<br> To him, mine infant, were the waters gracious. Indra, my Son, rose up in conquering vigour.<br> 9 Thou art mine own, O Maghavan, whom Vyaṁsa struck to the ground and smote thy jaws in pieces.<br> But, smitten through, the mastery thou wonnest, and with thy bolt the Dāsa's head thou crushedst.<br> 10 The Heifer hath brought forth the Strong, the Mighty, the unconquerable Bull, the furious Indra.<br> The Mother left her unlicked Calf to wander, seeking himself, the path that he would follow.<br> 11 Then to her mighty Child the Mother turned her, saying, My son, these Deities forsake thee.<br> Then Indra said, about to slaughter Vṛtra, O my friend Vṛtra, stride full boldly forward.<br> 12 Who was he then who made thy Mother widow? Who sought to stay thee lying still or moving?<br> What God, when by the foot thy Sire thou tookest and slewest, was at hand to give thee comfort?<br> 13 In deep distress I cooked a dog's intestines. Among the Gods I found not one to comfort.<br> My consort I beheld in degradation. The Falcon then brought me the pleasant Soma.</p>
