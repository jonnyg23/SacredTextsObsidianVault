 <p>1. HE in the ancient way by strength engendered, lo! straight hath taken to himself all wisdom.<br> The waters and the bowl have made him friendly. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.<br> 2 At Āyu's ancient call he by his wisdom gave all this progeny of men their being,<br> And, by refulgent light, heaven and the waters. The Gods possessed the wealth. bestowing Agni.<br> 3 Praise him, ye Āryan folk, as chief performer of sacrifice adored and ever toiling,<br> Well-tended, Son of Strength, the Constant Giver. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.<br> 4 That Mātariśvan rich in wealth and treasure, light-winner, finds a pathway for his offspring.<br> Guard of our folk, Father of earth and heaven. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.<br> 5 Night and Dawn, changing each the other's colour, meeting together suckle one same Infant:<br> Golden between the heaven and earth he shineth. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.<br> 6 Root of wealth, gathering-place of treasures, banner of sacrifice, who grants the suppliant's wishes:<br> Preserving him as their own life immortal, the Gods possessed the wealth-bestowing Agni.<br> 7 Now and of old the home of wealth, the mansion of what is born and what was born aforetime,<br> Guard of what is and what will be hereafter,the Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.<br> 8 May the Wealth-Giver grant us conquering riches; may the Wealth-Giver grant us wealth with heroes.<br> May the Wealth-Giver grant us food with offspring, and length of days may the Wealth-Giver send us.<br> 9 Fed with our fuel, purifying Agni, so blaze to us auspiciously for glory.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
