 <p>1. As one brings forth his car when fain for combat, so bring we power to theeregard us, Indra<br> Well skilled in song, thoughtful in spirit, seeking great bliss from one like thee amid the Heroes.<br> 2 Indra, thou art our own with thy protection, a guardian near to men who love thee truly,<br> Active art thou, the liberal man's defender, his who draws near to thee with right devotion.<br> 3 May Indra, called with solemn invocations. the young, the Friend, be men's auspicious keeper,<br> One who will further with his aid the singer, the toiler, praiser, dresser of oblations.<br> 4 With laud and song let me extol that Indra in whom of old men prospered and were mighty.<br> May he, implored, fulfil the prayer for plenty of him who worships, of the living mortal.<br> 5 He, Indra whom the Aṅgirases' praise delighted, strengthened their prayer and made their goings prosper.<br> Stealing away the mornings with the sunlight, he, lauded, crushed even Aśna's ancient powers.<br> 6 He verily, the God, the glorious Indra, hath raised him up for man, best Wonder-Worker.<br> He, self-reliant, mighty and triumphant, brought low the dear head of the wicked Dāsa.<br> 7 Indra the Vṛtra-slayer, Fort-destroyer, scattered the Dāsa hosts who dwelt in darkness.<br> For men hath he created earth and waters, and ever helped the prayer of him who worships.<br> 8 To him in might the Gods have ever yielded, to Indra in the tumult of the battle.<br> When in his arms they laid the bolt, he slaughtered the Dasyus and cast down their forts of iron.<br> 9 Now may that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to him who lauds thee.<br> Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
