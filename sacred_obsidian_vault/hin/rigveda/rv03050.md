 <p>1. LET Indra drink, All-hail! for his is Soma,the mighty Bull come, girt by Maruts, hither.<br> Far-reaching, let him fill him with these viands, and let our offering sate his body's longing.<br> 2 I yoke thy pair of trusty Steeds for swiftness, whose faithful service from of old thou lovest.<br> Here, fair of cheek! let thy Bay Coursers place thee: drink of this lovely welleffused libation.<br> 3 With milk they made Indra their good Preserver, lauding for help and rule the bounteous rainer.<br> Impetuous God, when thou hast drunk the Soma, enraptured send us cattle in abundance.<br> 4 With kine and horses satisfy this longing with very splendid bounty still extend it.<br> Seeking the light, with hymns to thee, O Indra, the Kuśikas have brought their gift, the singers.<br> 5 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered;<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
