 <p>1. Now praise, as one who strives for strength, the harnessing of Agni's car,<br> The liberal, the most splendid One;<br> 2 Who, guiding worshippers aright, withers, untouched by age, the foe:<br> When worshipped fair to look upon;<br> 3 Who for his glory is extolled at eve and morning in our homes,<br> Whose statute is inviolate;<br> 4 Who shines refulgent like the Sun, with brilliance and with fiery flame,<br> Decked with imperishable sheen.<br> 5 Him Atri, Agni, have our songs Strengthened according to his sway:<br> All glories hath he made his own.<br> 6 May we with Agni's, Indra's help, with Soma's, yea, of all the Gods,<br> Uninjured dwell together still, and conquer those who fight with us.</p>
