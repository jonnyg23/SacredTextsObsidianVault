 <p>1. THE Season was the parent, and when born therefrom it entered rapidly the floods wherein it grows.<br> Thence was it full of sap, streaming with milky juice: the milk of the plant's stalk is chief and meet for lauds.<br> 2 They come trooping together bearing milk to him, and bring him sustenance who gives support to all.<br> The way is common for the downward streams to flow. Thou who didst these things first art worthy of our lauds.<br> 3 One priest announces what the institutor gives: one, altering the forms, zealously plies his task,<br> The third corrects the imperfections left by each. Thou who didst these things first art worthy of our lauds.<br> 4 Dealing out food unto their people there they sit, like wealth to him who comes, more than the back can bear.<br> Greedily with his teeth he eats the master's food. Thou who didst these things first art worthy of our lauds.<br> 5 Thou hast created earth to look upon the sky: thou, slaying Ahi, settest free the river's paths.<br> Thee, such, a God, the Gods have quickened with their lauds, even as a steed with waters: meet for praise art thou.<br> 6 Thou givest increase, thou dealest to us our food: thou milkest from the moist the dry, the rich in sweets.<br> Thou by the worshipper layest thy precious store: thou art sole Lord of all. Meet for our praise art thou.<br> 7 Thou who hast spread abroad the streams by stablished law, and in the field the plants that blossom and bear seed;<br> Thou who hast made the matchless lightnings of the sky,vast, compassing vast realms, meet for our praise art thou.<br> 8 Who broughtest Nārmara with all his wealth, for sake of food, to slay him that the fiends might be destroyed,<br> Broughtest the face unclouded of the strengthening one, performing much even now, worthy art thou of praise.<br> 9 Thou boundest up the Dāsa's hundred friends and ten, when, at one's hearing, thou helpest thy worshipper.<br> Thou for Dabhīti boundest Dasyus not with cords; Thou wast a mighty help. Worthy of lauds art thou.<br> 10 All banks of rivers yielded to his manly might; to him they gave, to him, the Strong, gave up their wealth.<br> The six directions hast thou fixed, a five-fold view: thy victories reached afar. Worthy of lauds art thou.<br> 11 Meet for high praise, O Hero, is thy power, that with thy single wisdom thou obtainest wealth,<br> The life-support of conquering Jātūṣṭhira. Indra, for all thy deeds, worthy of lauds art thou.<br> 12 Thou for Turvīti heldest still the flowing floods, the river-stream for Vayya easily to pass<br> Didst raise the outcast from the depths, and gavest fame unto the halt and blind. Worthy of lauds art thou.<br> 13 Prepare thyself to grant us that great bounty, O Vasu, for abundant is thy treasure.<br> Snatch up the wonderful, O Indra, daily. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
