 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XLI. Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.</h3>  
 <p>1 NEER is he injured whom the Gods Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,<br> The excellently wise, protect.<br> 2 He prospers ever, free from scathe, whom they, as with full hands, enrich,<br> Whom they preserve from every foe.<br> 3 The Kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies,<br> And lead him safely oer distress.<br> 4 Thornless, Ādityas, is the path, easy for him who seeks the Law:<br> With him is naught to anger you.<br> 5 What sacrifice, Ādityas, ye Heroes guide by the path direct,<br> May that come nigh unto your thought.<br> 6 That mortal, ever unsubdued, gains wealth and every precious thing,<br> And children also of his own.<br> 7 How, my friends, shall we prepare Aryaman's and Mitra's laud,<br> Glorious food of Varuṇa?<br> 8 I point not out to you a man who strikes the pious, or reviles:<br> Only with hymns I call you nigh.<br> 9 Let him not love to speak ill words: but fear the One who holds all four<br> Within his hand, until they fall.</p>
