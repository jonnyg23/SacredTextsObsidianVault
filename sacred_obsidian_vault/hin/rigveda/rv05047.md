 <p>1. URGING to toil and making proclamation, seeking Heaven's Daughter comes the Mighty Mother:<br> She comes, the youthful Hymn, unto the Fathers, inviting to her home and loudly calling.<br> 2 Swift in their motion, hasting to their duty, reaching the central point of life immortal,<br> On every side about the earth and heaven go forth the spacious paths without a limit.<br> 3 Steer, Sea, Red Bird with strong wings, he hath entered the dwelling-place of the Primeval Father.<br> A gay-hued Stone set in the midst of heaven, he hath gone forth and guards mid-air's two limits.<br> 4 Four bear him up and give him rest and quiet, and ten invigorate the Babe for travel.<br> His kine most excellent, of threefold nature, pass swiftly round the boundaries of heaven.<br> 5 Wondrous, O people, is the mystic knowledge that while the waters stand the streams are flowing:<br> That, separate from his Mother, Two support him, closely-united, twins, here made apparent.<br> 6 For him they lenghten prayers and acts of worship: the Mothers weave garments for him their offspring.<br> Rejoicing, for the Steer's impregning contact, his Spouses move on paths or heaven to meet him.<br> 7 Be this our praise, O Varuṇa and Mitra may this be health and force to us, O Agni.<br> May we obtain firm ground and room for resting: Glory to Heaven, the lofty habitation!</p>
