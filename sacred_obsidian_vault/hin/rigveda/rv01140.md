 <p>1. To splendid Agni seated by the altar, loving well his home, I bring the food as twere his place of birth.<br> I clothe the bright One with my hymn as with a robe, him with the car of light, bright-hued, dispelling gloom.<br> 2 Child of a double birth he grasps at triple food; in the year's course what he hath swallowed grows anew.<br> He, by another's mouth and tongue a noble Bull, with other, as an elephant, consumes the trees.<br> 3 The pair who dwell together, moving in the dark bestir themselves: both parents hasten to the babe,<br> Impetuous-tongued, destroying, springing swiftly forth, one to be watched and cherished, strengthener of his sire.<br> 4 For man, thou Friend of men, these steeds of thine are yoked, impatient, lightly running, ploughing blackened lines,<br> Discordant-minded, fleet, gliding with easy speed, urged onward by the wind and rapid in their course.<br> 5 Dispelling on their way the horror of black gloom, making a glorious show these flames of his fly forth,<br> When oer the spacious tract he spreads himself abroad, and rushes panting on with thunder and with roar.<br> 6 Amid brown plants he stoops as if adorning them, and rushes bellowing like a bull upon his wives.<br> Proving his might, he decks the glory of his form, and shakes his horns like one terrific, hard to stay.<br> 7 Now covered, now displayed he grasps as one who knows his resting-place in those who know him well.<br> A second time they wax and gather Godlike power, and blending both together change their Parents' form.<br> 8 The maidens with long, tresses hold him in embrace; dead, they rise up again to meet the Living One.<br> Releasing them from age with a loud roar he comes, filling them with new spirit, living, unsubdued.<br> 9 Licking the mantle of the Mother, far and wide he wanders over fields with beasts that flee apace.<br> Strengthening all that walk, licking up all around, a blackened path, forsooth, he leaves whereer he goes.<br> 10 O Agni, shine resplendent with our wealthy chiefs, like a loud-snorting bull, accustomed to the house.<br> Thou casting off thine infant wrappings blazest forth as though thou hadst put on a coat of mail for war.<br> 11 May this our perfect prayer be dearer unto thee than an imperfect prayer although it please thee well.<br> With the pure brilliancy that radiates from thy form, mayest thou grant to us abundant store of wealth.<br> 12 Grant to our chariot, to our house, O Agni, a boat with moving feet and constant oarage,<br> One that may further well our wealthy princes and all the folk, and be our certain refuge.<br> 13 Welcome our laud with thine approval, Agni. May earth and heaven and freely flowing rivers<br> Yield us long life and food and corn and cattle, and may the red Dawns choose for us their choicest.</p>
