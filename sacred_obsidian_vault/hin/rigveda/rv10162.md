 <p>1. MAY Agni, yielding to our prayer, the Rakṣas-slayer, drive away<br> The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb.<br> 2 Agni, concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of the flesh,<br> The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb.<br> 3 That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving embryo,<br> That which will kill the babe at birth,even this will we drive far away.<br> 4 That which divides thy legs that it may lie between the married pair,<br> That penetrates and licks thy side,even this will we exterminate.<br> 5 What rests by thee in borrowed form of brother, lover, or of lord,<br> And would destroy thy Progeny,even this will we exterminate.<br> 6 That which through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and lies down by thee,<br> And will destroy thy progeny,even this will we exterminate.</p>
