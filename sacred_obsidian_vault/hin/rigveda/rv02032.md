 <p>1. GRACIOUSLY further, O ye Heaven and Earth, this speech striving to win reward, of me your worshipper.<br> First rank I give to you, Immortal, high extolled! I, fain to win me wealth, to you the mighty Pair.<br> 2 Let not man's guile annoy us, secret or by day: give not us up a prey to these calamities.<br> Sever not thou our friendship: think thereon for us. This, with a heart that longs for bliss, we seek from thee.<br> 3 Bring hither with benignant mind the willing Cow teeming with plenteous milk, full, inexhaustible.<br> O thou invoked by many, day by day I urge thee with my word, a charger rapid in his tread.<br> 4 With eulogy I call on Rākā swift to hear may she, auspicious, hear us, and herself observe.<br> With never-breaking needle may she sew her work, and give a hero son most wealthy, meet for praise.<br> 5 All thy kind thoughts, O Rākā, lovely in their form, wherewith thou grantest wealth to him who offers gifts<br> With these come thou to us this day benevolent, O Blessed One, bestowing food of thousand sorts.<br> 6 O broad-tressed Sinīvālī, thou who art the Sister of the Gods,<br> Accept the offered sacrifice, and, Goddess, grant us progeny.<br> 7 With lovely fingers, lovely arms, prolific Mother of many sons<br> Present the sacred gifts to her, to Sinīvālī Queen of men.<br> 8 Her, Sinīvālī, her, Gungū, her, Rākā, her, Sarasvatī, Indrāṇī to mine aid I call, and Varuṇānī for my weal.</p>
