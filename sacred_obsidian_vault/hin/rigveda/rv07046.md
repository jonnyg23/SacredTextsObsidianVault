 <p>1. To Rudra bring these songs, whose bow is firm and strong, the self-dependent God with swiftly-flying shafts,<br> The Wise, the Conqueror whom none may overcome, armed with sharp-pointed weapons: may he hear our call.<br> 2 He through his lordship thinks on beings of the earth, on heavenly beings through his high imperial sway.<br> Come willingly to our doors that gladly welcome thee, and heal all sickness, Rudra., in our families.<br> 3 May thy bright arrow which, shot down by thee from heaven, flieth upon the earth, pass us uninjured by.<br> Thou, very gracious God, hast thousand medicines: inflict no evil on our sons or progeny.<br> 4 Slay us not, nor abandon us, O Rudra let not thy noose, when thou art angry, seize us.<br> Give us trimmed grass and fame among the living. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
