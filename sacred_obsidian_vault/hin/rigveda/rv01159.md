 <p>1. I PRAISE with sacrifices mighty Heaven and Earth at festivals, the wise, the Strengtheners of Law.<br> Who, having Gods for progeny, conjoined with Gods, through wonder-working wisdom bring forth choicest boons.<br> 2 With invocations, on the gracious Father's mind, and on the Mother's great inherent power I muse.<br> Prolific Parents, they have made the world of life, and for their brood all round wide immortality.<br> 3 These Sons of yours well skilled in work, of wondrous power, brought forth to life the two great Mothers first of all.<br> To keep the truth of all that stands and all that moves, ye guard the station of your Son who knows no guile.<br> 4 They with surpassing skill, most wise, have measured out the Twins united in their birth and in their home.<br> They, the refulgent Sages, weave within the sky, yea, in the depths of sea, a web for ever new.<br> 5 This is to-day the goodliest gift of Savitar: this thought we have when now the God is furthering us.<br> On us with loving-kindness Heaven and Earth bestow riches and various wealth and treasure hundredfold!</p>
