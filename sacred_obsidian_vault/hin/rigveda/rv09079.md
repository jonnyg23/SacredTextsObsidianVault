 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN LXXIX. Soma Pavamana.</h3>  
 <p>1. SPONTANEOUS let our drops of Soma juice flow on, pressed, golden-hued, among the Gods of lofty heaven.<br> Perish among us they who give no gifts of food! perish the godless! May our prayers obtain success.<br> 2 Forward to us the drops, distilling meath, shall flow, like riches for whose sake we urge the horses on.<br> Beyond the crafty hindering of all mortal men may we continually bear precious wealth away.<br> 3 Yea, yerily, foe of hate shown to himself is he, yea, verity, destroyer too of other hate.<br> As thirst subdueth in the desert, conquer thou, O Soma Pavarnana, men of evil thoughts.<br> 4 Near kin to thee is he, raised loftiest in the heavens: upon the earth's high ridge thy scions have grown forth.<br> The press-stones chew and crunch thee on the ox's hide: sages have milked thee with their hands into the streams.<br> 5 So do they hurry on thy strong and beauteous juice, O Indu, as the first ingredient of the draught.<br> Bring low, thou Pavamana, every single foe, and be thy might shown forth as sweet and gladdening drink.</p>
