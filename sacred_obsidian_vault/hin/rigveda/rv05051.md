May the Ādityas bring us health and happiness.<br> 13 May all the Gods, may Agni the beneficent, God of all men, this day be with us for our weal.<br> Help us the Ṛbhus, the Divine Ones, for our good. May Rudra bless and keep us from calamity.<br> 14 Prosper us, Mitra, Varuṇa. O wealthy Pathya, prosper us.<br> Indra and Agni, prosper us; prosper us thou, O Aditi.<br> 15 Like Sun and Moon may we pursue in full prosperity our path,<br> And meet with one who gives again, -who knows us well and slays us not.</p>
