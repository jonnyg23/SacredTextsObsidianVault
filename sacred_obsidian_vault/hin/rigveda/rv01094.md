 <p>1 FOR Jātavedas worthy of our praise will we frame with our mind this eulogy as twere a car.<br> For good, in his assembly, is this care of ours. Let us not, in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 2 The man for whom thou sacrificest prospereth, dwelleth without a foe, gaineth heroic might.<br> He waxeth strong, distress never approacheth him. Let us not, in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 3 May we have power to kindle thee. Fulfil our thoughts. In thee the Gods eat the presented offering,<br> Bring hither the Ādityas, for we long for them. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 4 We will bring fuel and prepare burnt offerings, reminding thee at each successive festival.<br> Fulfil our thought that so we may prolong our lives. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 5 His ministers move forth, the guardians of the folk, protecting quadruped and biped with their rays.<br> Mighty art thou, the wondrous herald of the Dawn. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 6 Thou art Presenter and the chief Invoker, thou Director, Purifier, great High Priest by birth.<br> Knowing all priestly work thou perfectest it, Sage. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 7 Lovely of form art thou, alike on every side; though far, thou shinest brightly as if close at hand.<br> O God, thou seest through even the dark of night. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 8 Gods, foremost be his car who pours libations out, and let our hymn prevail oer evil-hearted men.<br> Attend to this our speech and make it prosper well. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 9 Smite with thy weapons those of evil speech and thought, devouring demons, whether near or tar away.<br> Then to the singer give free way for sacrifice. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 10 When to thy chariot thou hadst yoked two red steeds and two ruddy steeds, wind-sped, thy roar was like a bull's.<br> Thou with smoke-bannered flame attackest forest trees. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 11 Then at thy roar the very birds are terrified, when, eating-up the grass, thy sparks fly forth abroad.<br> Then is it easy for thee and thy car to pass. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 12 He hath the Power to soothe Mitra and Varuṇa: wonderful is the Maruts wrath when they descend.<br> Be gracious; let their hearts he turned to us again. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 13 Thou art a God, thou art the wondrous Friend of Gods, the Vasu of the Vasus, fair in sacrifice.<br> Under, thine own most wide protection may we dwell. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 14 This is thy grace that, kindled in thine own abode, invoked with Soma thou soundest forth most benign,<br> Thou givest wealth and treasure to the worshipper. Let us not in thy friendship, Agni, suffer harm.<br> 15 To whom thou, Lord of goodly riches, grantest freedom from every sin with perfect wholeness,<br> Whom with good strength thou <a href="errata.htm#2">quickenest</a>, with children and wealthmay we be they, Eternal Being.<br> 16 Such, Agni, thou who knowest all good fortune, God, lengthen here the days of our existence.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
