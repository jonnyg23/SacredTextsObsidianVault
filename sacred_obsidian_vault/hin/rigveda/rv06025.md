 <p>1. WITH thine assistance, O thou Mighty Indra, be it the least, the midmost, or the highest,<br> Great with those aids and by these powers support us, Strong God! in battle that subdues our foemen.<br> 2 With these discomfit hosts that fight against us, and check the opponent's wrath, thyself uninjured.<br> With these chase all our foes to every quarter: subdue the tribes of Dāsas to the Ārya.<br> 3 Those who array themselves as foes to smite us, O Indra, be they kin or be they strangers,<br> Strike thou their manly strength that it be feeble, and drive in headlong flight our foemen backward.<br> 4 With strength of limb the hero slays the hero, when bright in arms they range them for the combat.<br> When two opposing hosts contend in battle for seed and offspring, waters, kine, or corn-lands.<br> 5 Yet no strong man hath conquered thee, no hero, no brave, no warrior trusting in his valour.<br> Not one of these is match for thee, O Indra. Thou far surpassest all these living creatures.<br> 6 He is the Lord of both these armies' valour when the commanders call them to the conflict:<br> When with their ranks expanded they are fighting with a great foe or for a home with heroes.<br> 7 And when the people stir themselves for battle, be thou their saviour, Indra, and protector,<br> And theirs, thy manliest of our friends, the pious, the chiefs who have installed us priests, O Indra.<br> 8 To thee for high dominion hath been for evermore, for slaughtering the Vṛtras,<br> All lordly power and might, O Holy Indra, given by Gods for victory in battle.<br> 9 So urge our hosts together in the combats: yield up the godless bands that fight against us.<br> Singing, at morn may we find thee with favour, yea, Indra, and een now, we Bharadvājas.</p>
