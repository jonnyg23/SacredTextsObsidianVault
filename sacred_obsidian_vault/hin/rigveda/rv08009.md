 <p>1. To help and favour Vatsa now, O Aśvins, come ye hitherward.<br> Bestow on him a dwelling spacious and secure, and keep malignities away.<br> 2 All manliness that is in heaven, with the Five Tribes, or in mid-air,<br> Bestow, ye Aśvins, upon us.<br> 3 Remember Kaṇva first of all among the singers, Aśvins, who<br> Have thought upon your wondrous deeds.<br> 4 Aśvins, for you with song of praise this hot oblation is effused,<br> This your sweet Soma juice, ye Lords of ample wealth, through which ye think upon the foe.<br> 5 Whatever ye have done in floods, in the tree, Wonder-Workers, and in growing plants,<br> Therewith, O Aśvins, succour me.<br> 6 What force, Nāsatyas, ye exert, whatever, Gods, ye tend and heal,<br> This your own Vatsa gains not by his hymns alone: ye visit him who offers gifts.<br> 7 Now hath the Ṛṣi splendidly thought out the Aśvins' hymn of praise.<br> Let the Atharvan pour the warm oblation forth, and Soma very rich in sweets.<br> 8 Ye Aśvins, now ascend your car that lightly rolls upon its way.<br> May these my praises make you speed hitherward like a cloud of heaven.<br> 9 When, O Nāsatyas, we this day make you speed hither with our hymns,<br> Or, Aśvins, with our songs of praise, remember Kanya specially.<br> 10 As erst Kakṣīvān and the Ṛṣi Vyaśva, as erst Dīrghatamas invoked your presence,<br> Or, in the sacrificial chambers, Vainya Pṛthi, so be ye mindful of us here, O Aśvins.<br> 11 Come as home-guardians, saving us from foemen, guarding our living creatures and our bodies,<br> Come to the house to give us seed and offspring,<br> 12 Whether with Indra ye be faring, Aśvins, or resting in one dwelling-place with Vāyu,<br> In concord with the Ṛbhus or Ādityas, or standing still in Viṣṇu's striding-places.<br> 13 When I, O Aśvins, call on you to-day that I may gather strength,<br> Or as all-conquering might in war, be that the Aśvins' noblest grace.<br> 14 Now come, ye Aśvins, hitherward: here are oblations set for you;<br> These Soma-draughts to aid Yadu and<br> Turvaśa, these offered you mid Kaniva's Sons.<br> 15 Whatever healing balm is yours, Nisatyas, near or far away,<br> Therewith, great Sages, grant a home to Vatsa and to Vimada.<br> 16 Together with the Goddess, with the Aśvins' Speech have I awoke.<br> Thou, Goddess, hast disclosed the hymn, and holy gift from mortal men.<br> 17 Awake the Aśvins, Goddess Dawn! Up Mighty Lady of sweet strains!<br> Rise, straightway, priest of sacrifice! High glory to the gladdening draught!<br> 18 Thou, Dawn, approaching with thy light shinest together with the Sun,<br> And to this man-protecting home the chariot ofthe Aśvins comes.<br> 19 When yellow stalks give forth the juice, as cows from udders pour their milk,<br> And voices sound the song of praise, the Aśvins' worshippers show first.<br> 20 Forward for glory and for strength, protection that shall conquer men,<br> And power and skill, most sapient Ones!<br> 21 When Aśvins, worthy of our lauds, ye seat you in the father's house.<br> With wisdom or the bliss ye bring.</p>
