 <p>1. Be, like thyself, O Indra, strong for our delight: here lauded, aid us, Maghavan, drinker of the juice.<br> Savitar with the Gods protect us: hear ye Twain. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 2 Bring swift, for offering, the snare that suits the time, to the pure-drinker Vāyu, roaring as he goes,<br> To him who hath approached the draught of shining milk. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 3 May Savitar the God send us full life, to each who sacrifices, lives aright and pours the juice<br> That we with simple hearts may wait upon the Gods. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 4 May Indra evermore be gracious unto us, and may King Soma meditate our happiness,<br> Even as men secure the comfort of a friend. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 5 Indra hath given the body with its song and strength: Bṛhaspati, thou art the lengthener of life.<br> The sacrifice is Manu, Providence, our Sire. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 6 Indra possesseth might celestial nobly formed: the singer in the house is Agni, prudent Sage.<br> He is the sacrifice in synod, fair, most near. We ask for freedom and complete felicity,<br> 7 Not often have we sinned against you secretly, nor, Vasus, have we openly provoked the Gods.<br> Not one of its, ye Gods, hath worn an alien shape. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 8 May Savitar remove from us our malady, and may the Mountains keep it far away from where<br> The press-stone as it sheds the meath rings loudly forth. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 9 Ye Vasus, let the stone, the presser stand erect: avert all enmities and keep them far remote.<br> Our guard to be adored is Savitar this God. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 10 Eat strength and fatness in the pasture, kine, who are balmed at the reservoir and at the seat of Law.<br> So let your body be our body's medicine. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 11 The singer fills the spirit: all mens, love hath he. Indra takes kindly care of those who pour the juice.<br> For his libation is the heavenly udder full. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.<br> 12 Wondrous thy spirit-filling light, triumpliant; thy hosts save from decay and are resistless.<br> The pious votary by straightest pathway speeds to possess the best of all the cattle.</p>
