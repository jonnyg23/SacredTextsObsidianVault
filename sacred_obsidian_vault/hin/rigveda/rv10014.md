 <p>1. HONOUR the King with thine oblations, Yama, Vivasvān's Son, who gathers men together,<br> Who travelled to the lofty heights above us, who searcbes out and shows the path to many.<br> 2 Yama first found for us a place to dwell in: this pasture never can be taken from<br> Us.<br> Men born on earth tread their own paths that lead them whither our ancient Fathers have departed.<br> 3 Mitali prospers there with Kavyas, Yama with Aṅgiras' sons, Bṛhaspati with Rkvans:<br> Exalters of the Gods, by Gods exalted, some joy in praise and some in our oblation.<br> 4 Come, seat thee on this bed of grass, O Yama, in company with Aṅgirases and Fathers.<br> Let texts recited by the sages bring thee O King, let this oblation make thee joyful.<br> 5 Come, Yama, with the Aṅgirases the Holy, rejoice thee here with children of Virūpa.<br> To sit on sacred grass at this our worship, I call Vivasvān, too, thy Father hither.<br> 6 Our Fathers are Aṅgirases, Navagvas, Atharvans, Bhṛgus who deserve the Soma.<br> May these, the Holy, look on us with favour, may we enjoy their gracious loving-kindness.<br> 7 Go forth, go forth upon the ancient pathways whereon our sires of old have gone before us.<br> 'Mere shalt thou look on both the Kings enjoying their sacred food, God Varuṇa and Yama.<br> 8 Meet Yama, meet the Fathers, meet the merit of free or ordered acts, in highest heaven.<br> Leave sin and evil, seek anew thy dwelling, and bright with glory wear another body.<br> 9 Go hence, depart ye, fly in all directions: this place for him the Fathers have provided.<br> Yama bestows on him a place to rest in adorned with days and beams of light and waters.<br> 10 Run and outspeed the two dogs, Saramā's offspring, brindled, four-eyed, upon thy happy pathway.<br> Draw nigh then to the gracious-minded Fathers where they rejoice in company with Yama.<br> 11 And those two dogs of thine, Yama, the watchers, four-eyed, who look on men and guard the pathway,<br> Entrust this man, O King, to their protection, and with prosperity and health endow him.<br> 12 Dark-hued, insatiate, with distended nostrils, Yama's two envoys roam among the People;<br> May they restore to us a fair existence here and to-day, that we may see the sunlight.<br> 13 To Yama pour the Soma, bring to Yama consecrated gifts:<br> To Yama sacrifice prepared and heralded by Agni goes.<br> 14 Offer to Yama holy gifts enriched with butter, and draw near:<br> So may he grant that we may live long days of life among the Gods.<br> 15 Offer to Yama, to the King, oblation very rich in meath:<br> Bow down before the Ṛṣis of the ancient times, who made this path in days of old.<br> 16 Into the six Expanses flies the Great One in Trkadrukas.<br> The Gāyatrī, the Tṛṣṭup, all metres in Yama are contained.</p>
