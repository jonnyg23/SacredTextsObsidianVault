 <p>1. THIS stream Sarasvatī with fostering current comes forth, our sure defence, our fort of iron.<br> As on a car, the flood flows on, surpassing in majesty and might all other waters.<br> 2 Pure in her course from mountains to the ocean, alone of streams Sarasvatī hath listened.<br> Thinking of wealth and the great world of creatures, she poured for Nahuṣa her milk and fatness.<br> 3 Friendly to man he grew among the women, a strong young Steer amid the Holy Ladies.<br> He gives the fleet steed to our wealthy princes, and decks their bodies for success in battle.<br> 4 May this Sarasvatī be pleased and listen at this our sacrifice, auspicious Lady,<br> When we with reverence, on our knees, implore her close-knit to wealth, most kind to those she loveth.<br> 5 These offerings have ye made with adoration: say this, Sarasvatī, and accept our praises;<br> And, placing us under thy dear protection, may we approach thee, as a tree, for shelter.<br> 6 For thee, O Blest Sarasvatī, Vasiṣṭha hath here unbarred the doors d sacred Order.<br> Wax, Bright One, and give strength to him who lauds thee. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
