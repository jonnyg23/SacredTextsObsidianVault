 <p>1. THE welcome speaker in the storm of battle uttered with might this prayer to win the Aśvins,<br> When the most liberal God, for Paktha, rescued his parents, and assailed the seven Hotras.<br> 2 Cyavāna, purposing deceptive presents, with all ingredients, made the altar ready.<br> Most sweet-voiced Tūrvayāṇa poured oblations like floods of widely fertilizing water.<br> 3 To his oblations, swift as thought, ye hurried, and welcomed eagerly the prayers he offered.<br> With arrows in his hand the Very Mighty forced from him all obedience of a servant.<br> 4 I call on you the Sons of Dyaus, the Aśvins, that a dark cow to my red kine be added.<br> Enjoy my sacrifice, come to my viands contented, not deceiving expectation. '<br> 5 Membrum suum virile, quod vrotentum fuerat, mas ille retraxit. Rursus illud quod in juvenem filiam sublatum fuerat, non aggressurus, ad se rerahit.<br> 6 Quum jam in medio connessu, semiperfecto opere, amorem in puellam pater impleverat, ambo discedentes seminis paulum in terrae superficiem sacrorum sede effusum emiserunt.<br> 7 Quum pater suam nilam adiverat, cum eā congressus suum semen supra <a href="errata.htm#26">viram</a> effudit. Tum Dii benigni precem (brahma) <a href="errata.htm#27">progenuerunt</a>, et Vastoshpatim, legum sacrarum custodem, formaverunt.<br> 8 Ille tauro similis spumam in certamine jactavit, tunc discedens pusillaximis huc profectus est. Quasi dextro pede claudus processit, "inutiles fuerunt illi mei complexus," ita locutus.<br> 9 'The fire, burning the people, does not approach quickly (by day): the naked (<i>Rākṣasas</i> approach) not Agni by night; the giver of fuel, and the giver of food, he, the upholder (of the rite), is born, overcoming enemies by his might.'<br> 10 Uttering praise to suit the rite Navagvas came speedily to win the damsel's friendship.<br> They who approached the twice-strong stable's keeper, meedless would milk the rocks that naught had shaken.<br> 11 Swift was new friendship with the maid they quickly accepted it as genuine seed and bounty.<br> Milk which the cow Sabardughā had yielded was the bright heritage which to thee they offered.<br> 12 When afterwards they woke and missed the cattle, the speaker thus in joyful mood addressed them:<br> Matchless are singers through the Vasu's nature; he bringeth them all food and all possessions.<br> 13 His followers then who dwelt in sundry places came and desired too slay the son of Nṛṣad.<br> Resistless foe, be found the hidden treasure of Śuṣṇa multiplied in numerous offspring.<br> 14 Thou, called Effulgence, in whose threefold dwelling, as in the light of heaven, the Gods are sitting,<br> Thou who art called Agni or Jātavedas, Priest, hear us, guileless Priest of holy worship.<br> 15 And, Indra, bring, that I may laud and serve them, those Two resplendent glorious Nāsatyas,<br> Blithe, bounteous, man-like, to the sacrificer, honoured among our men with offered viands.<br> 16 This King is praised and honoured as Ordainer: himself the bridge, the Sage speeds oer the waters.<br> He hath stirred up Kakṣīvān, stirred up Agni, as the steed's swift wheel drives the felly onward.<br> 17 Vaitarana, doubly kinsman, sacrificer, shall milk the cow who neer hath calved, Sabardhu,<br> When I encompass Varuṇa and Mitra with lauds, and Aryaman in safest shelter.<br> 18 Their kin, the Prince in heaven, thy nearest kinsman, turning his thought to thee thus speaks in kindness:<br> This is our highest bond: I am his offspring. How many others came ere I succeeded?<br> 19 Here is my kinship, here the place I dwell in: these are my Gods; I in full strength am present.<br> Twice-born am I, the first-born Son of Order: the Cow milked this when first she had her being.<br> 20 So mid these tribes he rests, the friendly envoy, borne on two paths, refulgent Lord of fuel.<br> When, like a line, the Babe springs up erectly, his Mother straight hath borne him strong to bless us.<br> 21 Then went the milch-kine forth to please the damsel, and for the good of every man that liveth.<br> Hear us, O wealthy Lord; begin our worship. Thou hast grown mighty through Āśvaghna's virtues.<br> 22 And take thou notice of us also, Indra, for ample riches, King whose arm wields thunder!<br> Protect our wealthy nobles, guard our princes unmenaced near thee, Lord of Tawny Coursers.<br> 23 When he goes forth, ye Pair of Kings, for booty, speeding to war and praise to please the singer,<br> I was the dearest sage of those about him,let him lead these away and bring them safely.<br> 24 Now for this noble man's support and comfort, singing with easy voice we thus implore thee:<br> Impetuous be his son and fleet his courser: and may I be his priest to win him glory.<br> 25 If, for our strength, the priest with adoration to win your friendship made the laud accepted,<br> That laud shall be a branching road to virtue for every one to whom the songs are suited.<br> 26 Glorified thus, with holy hymns and homage:Of noble race, with Waters, God-attended<br> May he enrich us for our prayers and praises: now can the cow be milked; the path is open.<br> 27 Be to us, then, ye Gods who merit worship, be ye of one accord our strong protection,<br> Who went on various ways and brought us vigour, ye who are undeceivable explorers.</p>
