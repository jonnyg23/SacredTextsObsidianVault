 <p>1. I WILL declare the mighty deeds of Viṣṇu, of him who measured out the earthly regions,<br> Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting down his footstep, widely striding.<br> 2 For this his mighty deed is Viṣṇu lauded, like some wild beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming;<br> He within whose three wide-extended paces all living creatures have their habitation.<br> 3 Let the hymn lift itself as strength to Viṣṇu, the Bull far-striding, dwelling on the mountains,<br> Him who alone with triple step hath measured this common dwelling-place, long, far extended.<br> 4 Him whose three places that are filled with sweetness, imperishable, joy as it may list them,<br> Who verily alone upholds the threefold, the earth, the heaven, and all living creatures.<br> 5 May I attain to that his well-loved mansion where men devoted to the Gods are happy.<br> For there springs, close akin to the Wide-Strider, the well of meath in Viṣṇu's highest footstep.<br> 6 Fain would we go unto your dwelling-places where there are many-horned and nimble oxen,<br> For mightily, there, shineth down upon us the widely-striding Bull's sublimest mansion.</p>
