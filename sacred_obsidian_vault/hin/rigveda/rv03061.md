 <p>1. O Uṣas, strong with strength, endowed witli knowledge, accept the singer's praise, O wealthy Lady.<br> Thou, Goddess, ancient, young, and full of wisdom, movest, all-bounteous! as the Law ordaineth.<br> 2 Shine forth, O Morning, thou auspicious Goddess, on thy bright car awaking pleasant voices.<br> Let docile horses of far-reaching splendour convey thee hitherward, the goldencoloured.<br> 3 Thou, Morning, turning thee to every creature, standest on high as ensign of the Immortal,<br> To one same goal ever and ever wending now, like a wheel, O newly-born, roll hi ther.<br> 4 Letting her reins drop downward, Morning cometh, the wealthy Dame, the Lady of the dwelling;<br> Bringing forth light, the Wonderful, the Blessed hath spread her from the bounds of earth and heaven.<br> 5 Hither invoke the radiant Goddess Morning, and bring with reverence your hymn to praise her.<br> She, dropping sweets, hath set in heaven her brightness, and, fair to look on, hath beamed forth her splendour.<br> 6 From heaven, with hymns, the Holy One was wakened: brightly to both worlds came the wealthy Lady.<br> To Morning, Agni, when she comes refulgent, thou goest forth soliciting fair riches.<br> 7 On Law's firm base the speeder of the Mornings, the Bull, hath entered mighty earth and heaven.<br> Great is the power of Varuṇa and Mitra, which, bright, hath spread in every place its splendour.</p>
