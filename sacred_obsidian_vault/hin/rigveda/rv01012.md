 <p>1 WE choose Agni the messenger, the herald, master of all wealth,<br> Well skilled in this our sacrifice.<br> 2 With callings ever they invoke Agni, Agni, Lord of the House,<br> Oblation-bearer, much beloved.<br> 3 Bring the Gods hither, Agni, born for him who strews the sacred grass:<br> Thou art our herald, meet for praise.<br> 4 Wake up the willing Gods, since thou, Agni, performest embassage:<br> Sit on the sacred grass with Gods.<br> 5 O Agni, radiant One, to whom the holy oil is poured, burn up<br> Our enemies whom fiends protect.<br> 6 By Agni Agni is inflamed, Lord of the House, wise, young, who bears<br> The gift: the ladle is his mouth.<br> 7 Praise Agni in the sacrifice, the Sage whose ways are ever true,<br> The God who driveth grief away.<br> 8 God, Agni, be his strong defence who lord of sacrificial gifts,<br> Worshippeth thee the messenger.<br> 9 Whoso with sacred gift would fain call Agni to the feast of Gods,<br> O Purifier, favour him.<br> 10 Such, Agni, Purifier, bright, bring hither to our sacrifice,<br> To our oblation bring the Gods.<br> 11 So lauded by our newest song of praise bring opulence to us,<br> And food, with heroes for our sons.<br> 12 O Agni, by effulgent flame, by all invokings of the Gods,<br> Show pleasure in this laud of ours.</p>
