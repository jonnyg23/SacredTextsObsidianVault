 <p>1. MAY mighty Heaven and Earth, most meet for honour, be present here with light and gleaming splendours;<br> When, fixing them apart, vast, most extensive, the Steer roars loudly in far-reaching courses.<br> 2 The Goddesses with Gods, holy with holy, the Two stand pouring out their rain, exhaustless:<br> Faithful and guileless, having Gods for children, leaders of sacrifice with shining splendours.<br> 3 Sure in the worlds he was a skilful Craftsman, he who produced these Twain the Earth and Heaven.<br> Wise, with his power he brought both realms, together spacious and deep, well-fashioned, unsupported.<br> 4 O Heaven and Earth, with one accord promoting, with high protection as of Queens, our welfare,<br> Far-reaching, universal, holy, guard us. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.<br> 5 To both of you, O Heaven and Earth, we bring our lofty song of praise,<br> Pure Ones! to glorify you both.<br> 6 Ye sanctify each other's form, by your own proper might ye rule,<br> And from of old observe the Law.<br> 7 Furthering and fulfilling, ye, O Mighty, perfect Mitra's Law.<br> Ye sit around our sacrifice.</p>
