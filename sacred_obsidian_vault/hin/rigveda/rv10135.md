 <p>1. IN the Tree clothed with goodly leaves where Yama drinketh with the Gods,<br> The Father, Master of the house, tendeth with love our ancient Sires.<br> 2 I looked reluctantly on him who cherishes those men of old,<br> On him who treads that evil path, and then I yearned for this again.<br> 3 Thou mountest, though thou dost not see, O Child, the new and wheel-less car<br> Which thou hast fashioned mentally, onepoled but turning every way.<br> 4 The car which thou hast made to roll hitherward from the Sages, Child!<br> This hath the Sāman followed close, hence, laid together on a ship.<br> 5 Who was the father of the child? Who made the chariot roll away?<br> Who will this day declare to us how the funeral gift was made?<br> 6 When the funeral gift was placed, straightway the point of flame appeared.<br> A depth extended in the front: a passage out was made behind.<br> 7 Here is the seat where Yama dwells, that which is called the Home of Gods:<br> Here minstrels blow the flute for him here he is glorified with songs.</p>
