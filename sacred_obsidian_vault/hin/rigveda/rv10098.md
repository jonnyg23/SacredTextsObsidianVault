 <p>1. COME, be thou Mitra, Varuṇa, or Pūṣan, come, O Bṛhaspati, to mine oblation:<br> With Maruts, Vasus, or Ādityas, make thou Parjanya pour for Santanu his rain-drops.<br> 2 The God, intelligent, the speedy envoy whom thou hast sent hath come to me, Devapi:<br> Address thyself to me and turn thee hither within thy lips will I put brilliant language.<br> 3 Within my mouth, Bṛhaspati, deposit speech lucid, vigorous, and free from weakness,<br> Thereby to win for Santanu the rain-fall. The meath-rich drop from heaven hath passed within it.<br> 4 Let the sweet drops descend on us, O Indra: give us enough to lade a thousand wagons.<br> Sit to thy Hotar task; pay worship duly, and serve the Gods, Devapi, with oblation.<br> 5 Knowing the God's good-will, Devapi, Ṛṣi, the son of Rstisena, sate as Hotar.<br> He hath brought down from heaven's most lofty summit the ocean of the rain, celestial waters.<br> 6 Gathered together in that highest ocean, the waters stood by deities obstructed.<br> They burried down set free by Arstisena, in gaping clefts, urged onward by Devapi.<br> 7 When as chief priest for Santanu, Devapi, chosen for Hotar's duty, prayed beseeching,<br> Graciously pleased Bṛhaspati vouchsafed him a voice that reached the Gods and won the waters.<br> 8 O Agni whom Devapi Arstisena, the mortal man, hath kindled in his glory,<br> Joying in him with all the Gods together, urge on the sender of the rain, Parjanya.<br> 9 All ancient Ṛṣis with their songs approached thee, even thee, O Much-invoked, at sacrifices.<br> We have provided wagon-loads in thousands: come to the solemn rite, Lord of Red Horses.<br> 10 The wagon-loads, the nine-and-ninety thousand, these have been offered up to thee, O Agni.<br> Hero, with these increase thy many bodies, and, stimulated, send us rain from heaven.<br> 11 Give thou these ninety thousand loads, O Agni, to Indra, to the Bull, to be his portion.<br> Knowing the paths which Deities duly travel, set mid the Gods in heaven Aulana also.<br> 12 O Agni, drive afar our foes, our troubles chase malady away and wicked demons.<br> From this air-ocean, from the lofty heavens, send down on us a mighty flood of waters.</p>
