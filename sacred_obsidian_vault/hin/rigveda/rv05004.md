 <p>1. O AGNI, King and Lord of wealth and treasures, in thee is my delight at sacrifices.<br> Through thee may we obtain the strength we long for, and overcome the fierce attacks of mortals.<br> 2 Agni, Eternal Father, offering-bearer, fair to behold, far-reaching, far-refulgent,<br> From well-kept household fire beam food to feed us, and measure out to us abundant glory.<br> 3 The Sage of men, the Lord of human races, pure, purifying Agni, balmed with butter,<br> Him the Omniscient as your Priest ye stablish: he wins among the Gods things worth the choosing.<br> 4 Agni, enjoy, of one accord with Iḷā, striving in rivalry with beams of Sūrya,<br> Enjoy, O Jātavedas, this our fuel, and bring the Gods to us to taste oblations.<br> 5 As dear House-Friend, guest welcome in the dwelling, to this our sacrifice come thou who knowest.<br> And, Agni, having scattered all assailants, bring to us the possessions of our foemen.<br> 6 Drive thou away the Dasyu with thy weapon. As, gaining vital power for thine own body,<br> O Son of Strength, the Gods thou satisfiest, so in fight save us, most heroic Agni.<br> 7 May we, O Agni, with our lauds adore thee, and with our gifts, fair-beaming Purifier!<br> Send to us wealth containing all things precious: bestow upon us every sort of riches.<br> 8 Son of Strength, Agni, dweller in three regions, accept our sacrifice and our oblation.<br> Among the Gods may we be counted pious: protect us with a triply-guarding shelter.<br> 9 Over all woes and dangers, Jātavedas, bear us as in a boat across a river.<br> Praised with our homage even as Atri praised thee, O Agni, be the guardian of our bodies.<br> 10 As I, remembering thee with grateful spirit, a mortal, call with might on thee Immortal,<br> Vouchsafe us high renown, O Jātavedas, and may I be immortal by my children.<br> 11 The pious man, O Jātavedas Agni, to whom thou grantest ample room and pleasure,<br> Gaineth abundant wealth with sons and horses, with heroes and with kine for his well-being.</p>
