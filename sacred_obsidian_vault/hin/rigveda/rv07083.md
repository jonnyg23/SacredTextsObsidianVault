 <p>1. LOOKING to you and your alliance, O ye Men, armed with broad axes they went forward, fain for spoil.<br> Ye smote and slew his Dāsa and his Āryan enemies, and helped Sudās with favour, Indra-Varuṇa.<br> 2 Where heroes come together with their banners raised, in the encounter where is naught for us to love,<br> Where all things that behold the light are terrified, there did ye comfort us, O Indra-Varuṇa.<br> 3 The boundaries of earth were seen all dark with dust: O Indra-Varuṇa, the shout went up to heaven.<br> The enmities of the people compassed me about. Ye heard my calling and ye came to me with help.<br> 4 With your resistless weapons, Indra-Varuṇa, ye conquered Bheda and ye gave Sudās your aid.<br> Ye heard the prayers of these amid the cries of war: effectual was the service of the Trtsus' priest.<br> 5 O Indra-Varuṇa, the wickedness of foes and mine assailants' hatred sorely trouble me.<br> Ye Twain are Lords of riches both of earth and heaven: so grant to us your aid on the decisive day.<br> 6 The men of both the hosts invoked you in the fight, Indra and Varuṇa, that they might win the wealth,<br> What time ye helped Sudās, with all the Trtsu folk, when the Ten Kings had pressed him down in their attack.<br> 7 Ten Kings who worshipped not, O Indra-Varuṇa, confederate, in war prevailed not oer Sudās.<br> True was the boast of heroes sitting at the feast: so at their invocations Gods were on their side.<br> 8 O Indra-Varuṇa, ye gave Sudās your aid when the Ten Kings in battle compassed him about,<br> There where the white-robed Trtsus with their braided hair, skilled in song worshipped you with homage and with hymn.<br> 9 One of you Twain destroys the Vṛtras in the fight, the Other evermore maintains his holy Laws.<br> We call on you, ye Mighty, with our hymns of praise. Vouchsafe us your protection, Indra-Varuṇa.<br> 10 May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great shelter spreading far.<br> We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Savitar's song of praise, the God who strengthens Law.</p>
