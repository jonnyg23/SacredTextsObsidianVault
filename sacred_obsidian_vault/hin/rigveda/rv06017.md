 <p>1. DRINK Soma, Mighty One, for which, when lauded, thou breakest through the cattle-stall, O Indra;<br> Thou who, O Bold One, armed with thunder smotest Vṛtra with might, and every hostile being.<br> 2 Drink it thou God who art impetuous victor, Lord of our hymns, with beauteousjaws, the Hero,<br> Render of kine-stalls, car-borne, thunder-wielding, so pierce thy way to wondrous strength, O Indra.<br> 3 Drink as of old, and let the draught delight thee. hear thou our prayer and let our songs exalt thee.<br> Make the Sun visible, make food abundant, slaughter the foes, pierce through and free the cattle.<br> 4 These gladdening drops, O Indra, Self-sustainer, quaffed shall augment thee in thy mighty splendour.<br> Yea, let the cheering drops delight thee greatly, great, perfect, strong, powerful, all-subduing.<br> 5 Gladdened whereby, bursting the firm enclosures, thou gavest splendour to the Sun and Morning.<br> The mighty rock that compassed in the cattle, neer moved, thou shookest from its seat, O Indra.<br> 6 Thou with thy wisdom, power, and works of wonder, hast stored the ripe milk in the raw cows' udders<br> Unbarred the firm doors for the kine of Morning, and, with the Aṅgirases, set free the cattle.<br> 7 Thou hast spread out wide earth, a mighty marvel, and, high thyself, propped lofty heaven, O Indra.<br> Both worlds, whose Sons are Gods, thou hast supported, young, Mothers from old time ofholy Order.<br> 8 Yea, Indra, all the Deities installed thee their one strong Champion in the van for battle.<br> What time the godless was the Gods assailant, Indra they chose to win the light of heaven.<br> 9 Yea, een that heaven itself of old bent backward before thy bolt, in terror of its anger,<br> When Indra, life of every living creature, smote down within his lair the assailing Dragon.<br> 10 Yea, Strong One! Tvaṣṭar turned for thee, the Mighty, the bolt with thousand spikes and hundred edges,<br> Eager and prompt at will, wherewith thou crushedst the boasting Dragon, O impetuous Hero.<br> 11 He dressed a hundred buffaloes, O Indra, for thee whom all accordant Maruts strengthen.<br> He, Pūṣan Viṣṇu, poured forth three great vessels to him, the juice that cheers, that slaughters Vṛtra.<br> 12 Thou settest free the rushing wave of waters, the floods' great swell encompassed and obstructed.<br> Along steep slopes their course thou tumedst, Indra, directed downward, speeding to the ocean.<br> 13 So may our new prayer bring thee to protect us, thee well-armed Hero with thy bolt of thunder,<br> Indra, who made these worlds, the Strong, the ty, who never groweth old, the victory-giver.<br> 14 So, Indra, form us brilliant holy singers for strength, for glory, and for food and riches.<br> Give Bharadvāja hero patrons, Indra Indra, be ours upon the day of trial.<br> 15 With this may we obtain strength God-appointed, and brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters.</p>
