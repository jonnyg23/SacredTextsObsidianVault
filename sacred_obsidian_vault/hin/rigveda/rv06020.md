 <p>1. GIVE us wealth, Indra, that with might, as heaven oertops the earth, oercomes our foes in battle<br> Wealth that brings thousands and that wins the corn-lands, wealth, Son of Strength! that vanquishes the foeman.<br> 2 Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by the Gods entrusted,<br> When thou, Impetuous! leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra the Dragon who enclosed the waters.<br> 3 Indra, Strong, Victor, Mightier than the mighty, addressed with prayer and perfect in his splendour,<br> Lord of the bolt that breaketh forts in pieces, became the King of the sweet juice of Soma..<br> 4 There, Indra, while the light was won, the Paṇis f1ed, 'neath a hundred blows, for wise Dasoni,<br> And greedy Śuṣṇa's magical devices nor left he any of their food remaining.<br> 5 What time the thunder fell and Śuṣṇa perished, all life's support from the great Druh was taken.<br> Indra made room for his car-drivcr Kutsa who sate beside him, when he gained the sunlight.<br> 6 As the Hawk rent for him the stalk that gladdens, he wrenched the head from Namuci the Dāsa.<br> He guarded Nam, Sayya's son, in slumber, and sated him with food, success, and riches.<br> 7 Thou, thunder-armed, with thy great might hast shattered Pipru's strong forts who knew the wiles of serpents.<br> Thou gavest to thy worshipper Ṛjiśvan imperishable Wealth, O Bounteous Giver.<br> 8 The crafty Vetasu, the swift Dasni, and Tugra speedily with all his servants,<br> Hath Indra, gladdening with strong assistance, forced near as twere to glorify the Mother.<br> 9 Resistless, with the hosts he battles, bearing in both his arms the Vṛtra-slaying thunder.<br> He mounts his Bays, as the car-seat an archer: yoked at a word they bear the lofty Indra.<br> 10 May we, O Indra, gain by thy new favour: so Parus laud thee, with their sacrifices,<br> That thou hast wrecked seven autumn forts, their shelter, slain Dāsa tribes and aided Purukutsa.<br> 11 Favouring Uśanā the son of Kavi, thou wast his ancient strengthener, O Indra.<br> Thou gavest Navavāstva. as a present, to the great father gavest back his grandson.<br> 12 Thou, roaring Indra, drovest on the waters that made a roaring sound like rushing rivers,<br> What time, O Hero, oer the sea thou broughtest, in safety broughtest Turvaśa and Yadu.<br> 13 This Indra, was thy work in war: thou sentest Dhuni and Cumuri to sleep and slumber.<br> Dabhīti lit the flame for thee, and worshipped with fuel, hymns, poured Soma, dressed oblations.</p>
