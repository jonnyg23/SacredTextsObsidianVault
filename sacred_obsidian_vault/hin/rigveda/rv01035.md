 <p>1 AGNI I first invoke for our prosperity; I call on Mitra, Varuṇa, to aid us here.<br> I call on Night who gives rest to all moving life; I call on Savitar the God to lend us help.<br> 2 Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest the immortal and the mortal,<br> Borne in his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God who looks on every creature.<br> 3 The God moves by the upward path, the downward; with two bright Bays, adorable, he journeys.<br> Savitar comes, the God from the far distance, and chases from us all distress and sorrow.<br> 4 His chariot decked with pearl, of various colours, lofty, with golden pole, the God hath mounted,<br> The many-rayed One, Savitar the holy, bound, bearing power and might, for darksome regions.<br> 5 Drawing the gold-yoked car his Bays, white-footed, have manifested light to all the peoples.<br> Held in the lap of Savitar, divine One, all men, all beings have their place for ever.<br> 6 Three heavens there are; two Savitar's, adjacent: in Yama's world is one, the home of heroes,<br> As on a linch-pin, firm, rest things immortal: he who hath known it let him here declare it.<br> 7 He, strong of wing, hath lightened up the regions, deep-quivering Asura, the gentle Leader.<br> Where now is Sūrya, where is one to tell us to what celestial sphere his ray hath wandered?<br> 8 The earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three desert regions and the Seven Rivers.<br> God Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice treasures unto him who worships.<br> 9 The golden-handed Savitar, far-seeing, goes on his way between the earth and heaven,<br> Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads the bright sky through the darksome region.<br> 10 May he, gold-handed Asura, kind Leader, come hither to us with his help and favour.<br> Driving off Rākṣasas and Yātudhānas, the God is present, praised in hymns at evening.<br> 11 O Savitar, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established in the air's mid-region:<br> O God, come by those paths so fair to travel, preserve thou us from harm this day, and bless us.</p>
