 <p>1. MY thought with fine discernment hath discovered the Cow who wanders free without a herdsman,<br> Her who hath straightway poured me food in plenty: Indra and Agni therefore are her praisers.<br> 2 Indra and Pūṣan, deft of hand and mighty, well-pleased have drained the heaven's exhaustless udder.<br> As in this praise the Gods have all delighted, may I win blessing here from you, O Vasus.<br> 3 Fain to lend vigour to the Bull, the siste.. with reverence recognize the germ within him.<br> The Cows come lowing hither to the Youngling, to him endued with great and wondrous beauties.<br> 4 Fixing with thought, at sacrifice, the press-stones, I bid the well-formed Heaven and Earth come hither;<br> For these thy flames, which give men boons in plenty, rise up on high, the beautiful, the holy.<br> 5 Agni, thy meath-sweet tongue that tastes fair viands, which among Gods is called the far-extended,<br> Therewith make all the Holy Odes be seated here for our help, and feed them with sweet juices.<br> 6 Let thy stream give us drink, O God, O Agni, wonderful and exhaustless like the rain-clouds.<br> Thus care for us, O Vasu Jātavedas, show us thy loving-kindness, reaching all men.</p>
