 <p>1. THIS here is Soma, neer restrained, active, all-conquering bursting forth,<br> Ṛṣi and Sage by sapience,<br> 2 All that is bare he covers oer, all that is sick he medicines;<br> The blind man sees, the cripple walks.<br> 3 Thou, Soma, givest wide defence against the hate of alien men,<br> Hatreds that waste and weaken us.<br> 4 Thou by thine insight and thy skill, Impetuous One, from heaven and earth<br> Drivest the sinner's enmity.<br> 5 When to their task they come with zeal, may they obtain the Giver's grace,<br> And satisfy his wish who thirsts.<br> 6 So may he find what erst was lost, so may be speed the pious man,<br> And lengthen his remaining life.<br> 7 Gracious, displaying tender love, unconquered, gentle in thy thoughts,<br> Be sweet, O Soma, to our heart.<br> 8 O Soma, terrify us not; strike us not with alarm, O King:<br> Wound not our heart with dazzling flame.<br> 9 When in my dwelling-place I see the wicked enemies of Gods,<br> King, chase their hatred far away, thou Bounteous One, dispel our foes.</p>
