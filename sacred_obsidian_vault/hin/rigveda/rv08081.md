INVITE ye Indra with a song to drink your draught of Soma juice,<br> All-conquering Śatakratu, most munificent of all who live.<br> 2 Lauded by many, much-invoked, leader of song, renowned of old:<br> His name is Indra, tell it forth.<br> 3 Indra the Dancer be to us the giver of abundant strength:<br> May he, the mighty, bring it near.<br> 4 Indra whose jaws are strong hath drunk of worshipping Sudaksa's draught,<br> The Soma juice with barley mixt.<br> 5 Call Indra loudly with your songs of praise to drink the Soma juice.<br> For this is what augments his stiength.<br> 6 When he hath drqnk its gladdening drops, the God with vigour of a God<br> Hath far surpassed all things that are.<br> 7 Thou speedest down to succour us this ever-conquering God of yours,<br> Him who is drawn to all our songs<br> 8 The Warrior not to he restrained, the Soma-drinker neer oerthrown,<br> The Chieftain of resistless might.<br> 9 O Indra, send us riches, thou Omniscient, worthy of our praise:<br> Help us in the decisive fray.<br> 10 Even thence, O Indra, come to us with food that gives a hundred powers,<br> With food that gives a thousand powers.<br> 11 We sought the wisdom of the wise. Śakra, Kine-giver, Thunder-armed!<br> May we with steeds oercome in fight.<br> 12 We make thee, Śatakratu, find enjoyment in the songs we sing.<br> Like cattle in the pasture lands.<br> 13 For, Śatakratu, Thunder-armed, all that we craved, as men are wont,<br> All that we hoped, have we attained.<br> 14 Those, Son of Strength, are come to thee who cherish wishes in their hearts<br> O Indra, none excelleth thee.<br> 15 So, Hero, guard us with thy care, with thy most liberal providence,<br> Speedy, and terrible to foes.<br> 16 O Śatakratu Indra, now rejoice with that carouse of thine<br> Which is most splendid of them all<br> 17 Even, Indra, that carouse which slays the Vṛtras best, most widely famed,<br> Best giver of thy power and might.<br> 18 For that which is thy gift we know, true Soma-drinker, Thunder-armed,<br> Mighty One, amid all the folk.<br> 19 For Indra, Lover of Carouse, loud be our songs about the juice:<br> Let poets sing the song of praise.<br> 20 We summon Indra to the draught, irl whom all glories rest, in whom<br> The seven communities rejoice.<br> 21 At the Trikadrukas the Gods span sacrifice that stirs the mind:<br> Let our songs aid and prosper it.<br> 22 Let the drops pass within thee as the rivers flow into the sea:<br> O fndra, naught excelleth thee.<br> 23 Thou, wakeful Hero, by thy might hast taken food of Soma juice,<br> Which, Indra, is within thee now.<br> 24 O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, let Soma be ready for thy maw,<br> The drops be ready for thy forms.<br> 25 Now Srutakaksa sings his song that cattle and the steed may come,<br> That Indra's very self may come.<br> 26 Here, Indra, thou art ready by our Soma juices shed for thee,<br> Śakra, at hand that thou mayst give.<br> 27 Even from far away our songs reach thee, O Caster of the Stone:<br> May we come very close to thee.<br> 28 For so thou art the hero's Friend, a Hero, too, art thou, and strong:<br> So may thine heart be won to us.<br> 29 So hath the offering, wealthiest Lord, been paid by all the worshippers:<br> So dwell thou, Indra, even with me.<br> 30 Be not thou like a slothfid priest, O Lord of spoil and wealth: rejoice<br> In the pressed Soma blent with milk.<br> 31 O Indra, let not ill designs surround us in the sunbeams' light:<br> This may we gain with thee for Friend.<br> 32 With thee to help us, Indra, let us answer all our enemies:<br> For thou art ours and we are thine.<br> 33 Indra, the poets and thy friends, faithful to thee, shall loudly sing<br> Thy praises as they follow thee.</p>
