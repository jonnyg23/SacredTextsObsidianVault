 <p>1. You, foeman-slaying Varuṇa and Mitra, we invoke with song,<br> Who, as with penfold of your arms, encompass round the realm of light.<br> 2 Stretch out your arms with favouring love unto this man who singeth hymns,<br> For in all places is sung forth your evergracious friendliness.<br> 3 That I may gain a refuge now, may my steps be on Mitra's path.<br> Men go protected in the charge of this dear Friend who harms us not.<br> 4 Mitra and Varuṇa, from you may I, by song, win noblest meed.<br> That shall stir envy in the homes of wealthy chiefs and those who praise.<br> 5 With your fair splendours, Varuṇa and Mitra, to our gathering come,<br> That in their homes the wealthy chiefs and they who are your friends may thrive.<br> 6 With those, moreover, among whom ye hold your high supremacy,<br> Vouchsafe us room that we may win strength for prosperity and wealth.<br> 7 When morning flushes, Holy Ones! in the Gods realm where white Cows shine,<br> Supporting Arcananas, speed, ye Heroes, with your active feet hither to my pressed Soma juice.</p>
