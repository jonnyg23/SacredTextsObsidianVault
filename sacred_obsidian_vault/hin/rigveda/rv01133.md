 <p>1. WITH sacrifice I purge both earth and heaven: I burn up great she-fiends who serve not Indra,<br> Where throttled by thy hand the foes were slaughtered, and in the pit of death lay pierced and mangled.<br> 2 O thou who castest forth the stones crushing the sorceresses heads,<br> Break them with thy wide-spreading foot, with thy wide-spreading mighty foot.<br> 3 Do thou, O Maghavan, beat off these sorceresses' daring strength.<br> Cast them within the narrow pit. within the deep and narrow pit.<br> 4 Of whom thou hast ere now destroyed thrice-fifty with thy fierce attacks.<br> That deed they count a glorious deed, though small to thee, a glorious deed.<br> 5 O Indra, crush and bray to bits the fearful fiery-weaponed fiend:<br> Strike every demon to the ground.<br> 6 Tear down the mighty ones. O Indra, hear thou us. For heaven hath glowed like earth in fear, O Thunder-armed, as dreading fierce heat, Thunder-armed!<br> Most Mighty mid the Mighty Ones thou speedest with strong bolts of death,<br> Not slaying men, unconquered Hero with the brave, O Hero, with the thrice-seven brave.<br> 7 The pourer of libations gains the home of wealth, pouring his gift conciliates hostilities, yea, the hostilities of Gods.<br> Pouring, he strives, unchecked and strong, to win him riches thousandfold.<br> Indra gives lasting wealth to him who pours forth gifts, yea, wealth he gives that long shall last.</p>
