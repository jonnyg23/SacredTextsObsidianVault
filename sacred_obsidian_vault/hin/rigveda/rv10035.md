 <p>1. THESE fires associate with Indra are awake, bringing their light when first the Dawn begins to shine.<br> May Heaven and Earth, great Pair, observe our holy work. We claim for us this day the favour of the Gods.<br> 2 Yea, for ourselves we claim the grace of Heaven and Earth, of Śaryaṇāvān, of the Hills and Mother Streams.<br> For innocence we pray to Sūrya and to Dawn. So may the flowing Soma bring us bliss to-day.<br> 3 May the great Twain, the Mothers, Heaven and Earth, this day preserve us free from sin for peace and happiness.<br> May Morning sending forth her light drive sin afar. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 4 May this first Dawn bring us the host of gracious Gods: rich, may it richly shine for us who strive for wealth.<br> The wrath of the malignant may we keep afar. We pray to kindled Agni for feilicity.<br> 5 Dawns, who come forward with the bright beams of the Sun, and at your earliest flushing bring to us the light,<br> Shine ye on us to-day auspicious, for renown. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 6 Free from all sickness may the Mornings come to us, and let our fires mount upward with a lofty blaze.<br> The Aśvin Pair have harnessed their swift-moving car. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 7 Send us to-day a portion choice and excellent, O Savitar, for thou art he who dealeth wealth.<br> I cry to Dhiṣaṇā, Mother of opulence. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 8 Further me this declaring of Eternal Law, the Law of Gods, as we mortals acknowledge it!<br> The Sun goes up beholding all the rays of morn. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 9 This day we pray with innocence in strewing grass, adjusting pressing-stones, and perfecting the hymn.<br> Thou in the Ādityas keeping movest restlessly. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 10 To our great holy grass I bid the Gods at morn to banquet, and will seat them as the seven priests,<br> Varuṇa, Indra, Mitra, Bhaga for our gain. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 11 Come hither, O Ādityas, for our perfect weal: accordant help our sacrifice that we may thrive.<br> Pūṣan, Bṛhaspati, Bhaga, both Aśvins, and enkindled Agni we implore for happiness.<br> 12 Ādityas, Gods, vouchsafe that this our home may be praise-worthy, prosperous, our heroes' sure defence,<br> For cattle, for our sons, for progeny, for life. We pray to kindled Agni for felicity.<br> 13 This day may all the Maruts, all he near us with aid: may all our fires be well enkindled.<br> May all Gods come to us with gracious favour. May spoil and wealth he ours, and all possessions.<br> 14 He whom ye aid, O Deities, in battle, whom ye protect and rescue from affliction,<br> Who fears no danger at your milk-libation, -such may we be to feast the Gods, ye Mighty.</p>
