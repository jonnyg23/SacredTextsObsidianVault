 <p>1 INDRA the singers with high praise, Indra reciters with their lauds,<br> Indra the choirs have glorified.<br> 2 Indra hath ever close to him his two bay steeds and word-yoked car,<br> Indra the golden, thunder-armed.<br> 3 Indra hath raised the Sun on high in heaven, that he may see afar:<br> He burst the mountain for the kine.<br> 4 Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained,<br> With awful aids, O awful One.<br> 5 In mighty battle we invoke Indra, Indra in lesser fight,<br> The Friend who bends his bolt at fiends.<br> 6 Unclose, our manly Hero, thou for ever bounteous, yonder cloud,<br> For us, thou irresistible.<br> 7 Still higher, at each strain of mine, thunder-armed Indra's praises rise:<br> I find no laud worthy of him.<br> 8 Even as the bull drives on the herds, he drives the people with his might,<br> The Ruler irresistible:<br> 9 Indra who rules with single sway men, riches, and the fivefold race<br> Of those who dwell upon the earth.<br> 10 For your sake from each side we call Indra away from other men:<br> Ours, and none others, may he be.</p>
