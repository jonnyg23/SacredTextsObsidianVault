 <p>1. HIS honouring rite whose grass is trimmed is offered swiftly to you, in Manu's wise, accordant,<br> The rite which Indra-Varuṇa shall carry this day to high success and glorious issue.<br> 2 For at Gods worship they are best through vigour; they have become the strongest of the Heroes;<br> With mighty strength, most liberal of the Princes, Chiefs of the host, by Law made Vṛtra's slayers.<br> 3 Praise those Twain Gods for powers that merit worship, Indra and Varuṇa, for bliss, the joyous.<br> One with his might and thunderbolt slays Vṛtra; the other as a Sage stands near in troubles.<br> 4 Though dames and men have waxen strong and mighty, and all the Gods selfpraised among the Heroes,<br> Ye, Indra-Varuṇa, have in might surpassed them, and thus were ye spread wide, O Earth and Heaven.<br> 5 Righteous is he, and liberal and helpful who, Indra-Varuṇa, brings you gifts with gladness.<br> That bounteous man through food shall conquer faemen, and win him opulence and wealthy people.<br> 6 May wealth which ye bestow in food and treasure on him who brings you gifts and sacrifices,<br> Wealth, Gods! which breaks the curse of those who vex us, be, Indra-Varuṇa, een our own possession.<br> 7 So also, Indra-Varuṇa, may our princes have riches swift to save, with Gods to guard them-<br> They whose great might gives victory in battles, and their triumphant glory spreads with swiftness.<br> 8 Indra. and Varuṇa, Gods whom we are lauding, mingle ye wealth with our heroic glory.<br> May we, who praise the strength of what is mighty, pass dangers, as with boats we cross the waters.<br> 9 Now will I sing a dear and far-extending hymn to Varuṇa the God, sublime, imperial Lord,<br> Who, mighty Governor, Eternal, as with flame, illumines both wide worlds with majesty and power.<br> 10 True to Law, Indra-Varuṇa, drinkers of the juice, drink this pressed Soma which shall give you rapturous joy.<br> Your chariot cometh to the banquet of the Gods, to sacrifice, as it were home, that ye may drink.<br> 11 Indra and Varuṇa, drink your fill, ye Heroes, of this invigorating sweetest Soma.<br> This juice is shed by us that ye may quaff it: on this trimmed grass be seated, and rejoice you</p>
