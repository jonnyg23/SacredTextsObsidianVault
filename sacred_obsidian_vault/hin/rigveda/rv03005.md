 <p>1. AGNI who shines against the Dawns is wakened. The holy Singer who precedes the sages.<br> With far-spread lustre, kindled by the pious, the Priest hath thrown both gates of darkness open.<br> 2 Agni hath waxen mighty by laudations, to be adored with hymns of those who praise him.<br> Loving the varied shows of holy Order at the first flush of dawn he shines as envoy.<br> 3 Amid men's homes hath Agni been established, fulfilling with the Law, Friend, germ of waters.<br> Loved and adored, the height he hath ascended, the Singer, object of our invocations.<br> 4 Agni is Mitra when enkindled duly, Mitra as Priest, Varuṇa, Jātavedas;<br> Mitra as active minister, and House-Friend, Mitra of flowing rivers and of mountains.<br> 5 The Earth's, the Bird's dear lofty place he guardeth, he guardeth in his might the course of Sūrya,<br> Guardeth the Seven-headed in the centre, guardeth sublime the Deities enjoyment.<br> 6 The skilful God who knows all forms of knowledge made for himself a fair form, meet for worship.<br> This Agni guards with care that never ceases the Soma's skin, the Bird's place rich in fatness.<br> 7 Agni hath entered longingly the longing shrine rich with fatness, giving easy access.<br> Resplendent, pure, sublime and purifying, again, again he renovates his Mothers.<br> 8 Born suddenly, by plants he grew to greatness, when tender shoots with holy oil increased him,<br> Like waters lovely when they hasten downward may Agni in his Parents' lap protect us.<br> 9 Extolled, the Strong shone forth with kindled fuel to the earth's centre, to the height of heaven.<br> May Agni, Friend, adorable Mātariśvan, as envoy bring the Gods unto our worship.<br> 10 Best of all luminaries lofty Agni supported with his flame the height of heaven,<br> When, far from Bhṛgus, Mātariśvan kindled the oblation-bearer where he lay in secret.<br> 11 As holy food, Agni to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels.<br> To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-word.</p>
