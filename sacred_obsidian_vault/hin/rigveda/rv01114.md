 <p>1. To the strong Rudra bring we these our songs of praise, to him the Lord of Heroes with the braided hair,<br> That it be well with all our cattle and our men, that in this village all be healthy and well-fed.<br> 2 Be gracious unto us, O Rudra, bring us joy: thee, Lord of Heroes, thee with reverence will we serve.<br> Whatever health and strength our father Manu won by sacrifice may we, under thy guidance, gain.<br> 3 By worship of the Gods may we, O Bounteous One, O Rudra, gain thy grace, Ruler of valiant men.<br> Come to our families, bringing them bliss: may we, whose heroes are uninjured, bring thee sacred gifts,<br> 4 Hither we call for aid the wise, the wanderer, impetuous Rudra, perfecter of sacrifice.<br> May he repel from us the anger of the Gods: verily we desire his favourable grace.<br> 5 Him with the braided hair we call with reverence down, the wild-boar of the sky, the red, the dazzling shape.<br> May he, his hand filled full of sovran medicines, grant us protection, shelter, and a home secure.<br> 6 To him the Maruts Father is this hymn addressed, to strengthen Rudra's might, a song more sweet than sweet.<br> Grant us, Immortal One, the food which mortals eat: be gracious unto me, my seed, my progeny.<br> 7 O Rudra, harm not either great or small of us, harm not the growing boy, harm not the full-grown man.<br> Slay not a sire among us, slay no mother here, and to our own dear bodies, Rudra, do not harm.<br> 8 Harm us not, Rudra, in our seed and progeny, harm us not in the living, nor in cows or steeds,<br> Slay not our heroes in the fury of thy wrath. Bringing oblations evermore we call to thee.<br> 9 Even as a herdsman I have brought thee hymns of praise: O Father of the Maruts, give us happiness,<br> Blessed is thy most favouring benevolence, so, verily, do we desire thy saving help.<br> 10 Far be thy dart that killeth men or cattle: thy bliss be with us, O thou Lord of Heroes.<br> Be gracious unto us, O God, and bless us, and then vouchsafe us doubly-strong protection.<br> 11 We, seeking help, have spoken and adored him: may Rudra, girt by Maruts, hear our calling.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
