 <p>1. THIS deathless Indu, like a steed, strong and of full vitality,<br> Belongs to thee, the Orderer.<br> 2 Here, by us, for the worshipper, is the wise bolt that works with skill.<br> It brings the bubbling beverage as a dexterous man brings the effectual strong drink.<br> 3 Impetuous Ahīśuva, a bull among cows of his,<br> looked down upon the restless Hawk.<br> 4 That the strong-pinioned Bird hath brought, Child of the Falcon, from afar,<br> What moves upon a hundred wheels along the female Dragon's path.<br> 5 Which, fair, unrobbed, the Falcon brought thee in his foot, the red-hued dwelling of the juice;<br> Through this came vital power which lengthens out our days, and kinship through its help awoke.<br> 6 So Indra is by lndu's power; een among Gods will it repel great treachery.<br> Wisdom, Most Sapient One, brings force that lengthens life.
