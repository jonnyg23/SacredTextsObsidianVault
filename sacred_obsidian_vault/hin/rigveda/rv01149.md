 <p>1. HITHER he hastens to give, Lord of great riches, King of the mighty, to the place of treasure.<br> The pressing-stones shall serve him speeding near us.<br> 2 As Steer of men so Steer of earth and heaven by glory, he whose streams all life hath drunken,<br> Who hasting forward rests upon the altar.<br> 3 He who hath lighted up the joyous castle, wise Courser like the Steed of cloudy heaven,<br> Bright like the Sun, with hundredfold existence.<br> 4 He, doubly born, hath spread in his effulgence through the three luminous realms, through all the regions,<br> Best sacrificing Priest where waters gather.<br> 5 Priest doubly born, he through his love of glory hath in his keeping all things worth the choosing,<br> The man who brings him gifts hath noble offspring.</p>
