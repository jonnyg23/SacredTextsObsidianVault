 <p>1. GREAT Indra will I laud, in whom all people who drink the Soma have attained their longing;<br> Whom, passing wise, Gods, Heaven and Earth, engendered, formed by a Master's hand, to crush the Vṛtras.<br> 2 Whom, most heroic, borne by Tawny Coursers, verily none subdueth in the battle;<br> Who, reaching far, most vigorous, hath shortened the Dasyu's life with Warriors bold of spirit.<br> 3 Victor in fight, swift mover like a warhorse, pervading both worlds, rainer down of blessings,<br> To he invoked in war like Bhaga, Father, as twere, of hymns, fair, prompt to hear, strength-giver.<br> 4 Supporting heaven, the high back of the region, his car is Vāyu with his team of Vasus.<br> Illumining the nights, the Sun's creator, like Dhiṣaṇā he deals forth strength and riches.<br> 5 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered;<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers treasure.</p>
