 <p>1. YEA, through the power of your sweet juice, ye Holy! the Marut host is glad at sacrifices.<br> They cause even spacious heaven and earth to tremble, they make the spring flow when they come, the Mighty.<br> 2 The Maruts watch the man who sings their praises, promoters of the thought of him who worships.<br> Seat you on sacred grass in our assembly, this day, with friendly minds, to share the banquet.<br> 3 No others gleam so brightly as these Maruts with their own forms, their golden gauds, their weapons.<br> With all adornments, decking earth and heaven, they heighten, for bright show, their common splendour.<br> 4 Far from us be your blazing dart, O Maruts, when we, through human frailty, sin against you.<br> Let us not he exposed to that, ye Holy! May your most loving favour still attend us.<br> 5 May even what we have done delight the Maruts, the blameless Ones, the bright, the purifying.<br> Further us, O ye Holy, with your kindness: advance us mightily that we may prosper.<br> 6 And may the Maruts, praised by all their titles, Heroes, enjoy the taste of our oblations.<br> Give us of Amṛta for the sake of offspring: awake the excellent fair stores of riches.<br> 7 Hither, ye Maruts, praised, with all your succours, with all felicity come to our princes,<br> Who, of themselves, a hundredfold increase us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
