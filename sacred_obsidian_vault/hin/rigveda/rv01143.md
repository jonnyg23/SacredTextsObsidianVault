 <p>1. To Agni I present a newer mightier hymn, I bring my words and song unto the Son of Strength,<br> Who, Offspring of the Waters, bearing precious things sits on the earth, in season, dear Invoking Priest.<br> 2 Soon as he sprang to birth that Agni was shown forth to Mātariśvan in the highest firmament.<br> When he was kindled, through his power and majesty his fiery splendour made the heavens and earth to shine.<br> 3 His flames that wax not old, beams fair to look upon of him whose face is lovely, shine with beauteous sheen.<br> The rays of Agni, him whose active force is light, through the nights glimmer sleepless, ageless, like the floods.<br> 4 Send thou with hymns that Agni to his own abode, who rules, one Sovran Lord of wealth, like Varuṇa,<br> Him, All-possessor, whom the Bhṛgus with their might brought to earth's central point, the centre of the world.<br> 5 He whom no force can stay, even as the Maruts roar, like to a dart sent forth, even as the bolt from heaven,<br> Agni with sharpened jaws chews up and eats the trees, and conquers them as when the warrior smites his foes.<br> 6 And will not Agni find enjoyment in our praise, will not the Vasu grant our wish with gifts of wealth?<br> Will not the Inspirer speed our prayers to gain their end? Him with the radiant glance I laud with this my song.<br> 7 The kindler of the flame wins Agni as a Friend, promoter of the Law, whose face is bright with oil.<br> Inflamed and keen, refulgent in our gatherings, he lifts our hymn on high clad in his radiant hues.<br> 8 Keep us incessantly with guards that cease not, Agni, with guards auspicious, very mighty.<br> With guards that never slumber, never heedless, never beguiled. O Helper, keep our children.</p>
