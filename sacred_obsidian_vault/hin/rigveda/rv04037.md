 <p>1. COME to our sacrifice, Vājas, Ṛbhukṣans, Gods, by the paths which Gods are wont to travel,<br> As ye, gay Gods, accept in splendid weather the sacrifice among these folk of Manus.<br> 2 May these rites please you in your heart and spirit; may the drops clothed in oil this day approach you.<br> May the abundant juices bear you onward to power and strength, and, when imbibed, delight you.<br> 3 Your threefold going near is God-appointed, so praise is given you, Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans.<br> So, Manus-like, mid younger folk I offer, to you who are aloft in heaven, the Soma.<br> 4 Strong, with fair chains of gold and jaws of iron, ye have a splendid car and well-fed horses.<br> Ye Sons of Strength, ye progeny of Indra, to you the best is offered to delight you.<br> 5 Ṛbhukṣans! him, for handy wealth, the mightiest comrade in the fight,<br> Him, Indra's equal, we invoke, most bounteous ever, rich in steeds.<br> 6 The mortal man whom, Ṛbhus, ye and Indra favour with your help,<br> Must be successful, by his thoughts, at sacrifice and with the steed.<br> 7 O Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, free for us the paths to sacrifice,<br> Ye Princes, lauded, that we may press forward to each point of heaven.<br> 8 O Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, ye Nāsatyas, Indra, bless this wealth,<br> And, before other men's, the steed, that ample riches may be won.</p>
