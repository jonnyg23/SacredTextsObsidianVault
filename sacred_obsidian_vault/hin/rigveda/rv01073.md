 <p>1. HE who gives food, like patrimonial riches and guides aright like some wise man's instruction,<br> Loved like a guest who lies in pleasant lodging,may he, as Priest, prosper his servant's dwelling.<br> 2 He who like Savitar the God, true-minded protecteth with his power. all acts of vigour,<br> Truthful, like splendour, glorified by many, like breath joy-giving,all must strive to win him.<br> 3 He who on earth dwells like a king surrounded by faithful friends, like a God all-sustaining,<br> Like heroes who preside, who sit in safety: like as a blameless dame dear to her husband.<br> 4 Thee, such, in settlements secure, O Agni, our men serve ever kindled in each dwelling.<br> On him have they laid splendour in abundance: dear to all men, bearer be he of riches.<br> 5 May thy rich worshippers win food, O Agni, and princes gain long life who bring oblation.<br> May we get booty from our foe in battle, presenting to the Gods their share for glory.<br> 6 The cows of holy law, sent us by Heaven, have swelled with laden udders, loudly lowing;<br> Soliciting his favour, from a distance the rivers to the rock have flowed together.<br> 7 Agni, with thee, soliciting thy favour, the holy Ones have gained glory in heaven.<br> They made the Night and Dawn of different colours, and set the black and purple hues together.<br> 8 May we and those who worship be the mortals whom thou, O Agni, leadest on to riches.<br> Thou hast filled earth and heaven and air's mid-region, and followest the whole world like a shadow.<br> 9 Aided by thee, O Agni, may we conquer steeds with steeds, men with men, heroes with heroes,<br> Lords of the wealth transmitted by our fathers: and may our princes live a hundred winters.<br> 10 May these our hymns of praise, Agni, Ordainer, be pleasant to thee in thy heart and spirit.<br> May we have power to hold thy steeds of riches, laying on thee the God-sent gift of glory.</p>
