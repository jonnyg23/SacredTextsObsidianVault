 <p>1. Now give we praise to Dadhikrās the rapid, and mention in our laud the Earth and Heaven.<br> May the Dawns flushing move me to exertion, and bear me safely over every trouble.<br> 2 I praise the mighty Steed who fills my spirit, the Stallion Dadhikrāvan rich in bounties,<br> Whom, swift of foot and shining bright as Agni, ye, Varuṇa and Mitra, gave to Pūrus.<br> 3 Him who hath honoured, when the flame is kindled at break of dawn, the Courser Dadhikrāvan,<br> Him, of one mind with Varuṇa and Mitra may Aditi make free from all transgression.<br> 4 When we remember mighty Dadhikrāvan our food and strength, then the blest name of Maruts,<br> Varuṇa, Mitra, we invoke for welfare, and Agni, and the thunder-wielding Indra.<br> 5 Both sides invoke him as they call on Indra when they stir forth and turn to sacrificing.<br> To us have Varuṇa and Mitra granted the Courser Dadhikrās, a guide for mortals.<br> 6 So have I glorified with praise strong Dadhikrāvan, conquering Steed.<br> Sweet may he make our mouths; may he prolong the days we have to live.</p>
