 <p>1. THE pressers from the Soma-press send forth thy juice for rapturous joy<br> The speckled sap runs like a flood.<br> 2 With strength we follow through the sieve him who brings might and wins the kine,<br> Enrobed in water with his juice.<br> 3 Pour on the sieve the Soma, neer subdued in waters, waterless,<br> And make it pure for Indra's drink.<br> 4 Moved by the purifier's thought, the Soma flows into the sieve:<br> By wisdom it hath gained its home.<br> 5 With humble homage, Indra, have the Soma-drops flowed forth to thee,<br> Contending for the glorious prize.<br> 6 Purified in his fleecy garb, attaining every beauty, he<br> Stands, hero-like, amid the kine.<br> 7 Swelling, as twere, to heights of heaven, the stream of the creative juice<br> Falls lightly on the cleansing sieve.<br> 8 Thus, Soma, purifying himwho knoweth song mid living men,<br> Thou wanderest through the cloth of wool.</p>
