 <p>1. MAKE me a bull among my peers, make me my rivals, conqueror:<br> Make me the slayer of my foes, a sovran ruler, lord of kine<br> 2 I am my rivals slayer, like Indra unwounded and unhurt,<br> And all these enemies of mine are vanquished and beneath my feet.<br> 3 Here, verily, I bind you fast, as the two bow-ends with the string.<br> Press down these men, O Lord of Speech, that they may humbly speak to me.<br> 4 Hither I came as conqueror with mighty all-effecting power,<br> And I have mastered all your thought, your synod, and your holy work.<br> 5 May I be highest, having gained your strength in war, your skill in peace<br> my feet have trodden on your heads.<br> Speak to me from beneath my feet, as frogs from out the water croak, as frogs from out the water croak.</p>
