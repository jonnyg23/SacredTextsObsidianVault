 <p>1. THE gold-hued juice, poured out upon the filter, is started like a car sent forth to conquer.<br> He hath gained song and vigour while they cleansed him, and hath rejoiced the Gods with entertainments.<br> 2 He who beholdeth man hath reached the filter: bearing his name, the Sage hath sought his dwelling.<br> The Ṛṣis came to him, seven holy singers, when in the bowls he settled as Invoker.<br> 3 Shared by all Gods, mobt wise, propitious, Soma goes, while they cleanse him, to his constant station.<br> Let him rejoice in all his lofty wisdom to the Five Tribes the Sage attains with labour.<br> 4 In thy mysterious place, O Pavamana Soma, are all the Gods, the Thrice-Eleven.<br> Ten on the fleecy height, themselves, self-prompted, and seven fresh rivers, brighten and adorn thee.<br> 5 Now let this be the truth of Pavamana, there where all singers gather them together,<br> That he hath given us room and made the daylight, hath holpen Manu and repelled the Dasyu.<br> 6 As the priest seeks the station rich in cattle, like a true King who goes to great assemblies,<br> Soma hath sought the beakers while they cleansed him, and like a wild bull, in the wood hath settled.</p>
