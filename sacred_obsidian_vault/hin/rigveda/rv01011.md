 <p>1 ALL sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea,<br> The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord of strength.<br> 2 Strong in thy friendship, Indra, Lord of power and might, we have no fear.<br> We glorify with praises thee, the never-conquered conqueror.<br> 3 The gifts of Indra from of old, his saving succours, never fail,<br> When to the praise-singers he gives the boon of substance rich in kine.<br> 4 Crusher of forts, the young, the wise, of strength unmeasured, was he born<br> Sustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much-extolled.<br> 5 Lord of the thunder, thou didst burst the cave of Vala rich in cows.<br> The Gods came pressing to thy side, and free from terror aided thee,<br> 6 I, Hero, through thy bounties am come to the flood addressing thee.<br> Song-lover, here the singers stand and testify to thee thereof.<br> 7 The wily Śuṣṇa, Indra! thou oerthrewest with thy wondrous powers.<br> The wise beheld this deed of thine: now go beyond their eulogies.<br> 8 Our songs of praise have glorified Indra who ruleth by his might,<br> Whose precious gifts in thousands come, yea, even more abundantly.</p>
