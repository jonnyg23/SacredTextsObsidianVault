 <p>1. AŚVINS, your ancient priest invites you hither to gladden you with draughts of meath of Soma.<br> Our gift is on the grass, our song apportioned: with food and strength come hither, O Nāsatyas.<br> 2 That car of yours, swifter than thought, O Aśvins, which drawn by brave steeds cometh to the people,<br> Whereon ye seek the dwelling of the pious,come ye thereon to our abode, O Heroes.<br> 3 Ye freed sage Atri, whom the Five Tribes honoured, from the strait pit, ye Heroes with his people,<br> Baffling the guiles of the malignant Dasyu, repelling them, ye Mighty in succession.<br> 4 Rebha the sage, ye mighty Heroes, Aśvins! whom, like a horse, vile men had sunk in water,<br> Him, wounded, with your wondrous power ye rescued: your exploits of old time endure for ever.<br> 5 Ye brought forth Vandana, ye Wonder-Workers, for triumph, like fair gold that hath been buried,<br> Like one who slumbered in destruction's bosom, or like the Sun when dwelling in the darkness.<br> 6 Kakṣīvān, Pajra's son, must laud that exploit of yours, Nāsatyas, Heroes, ye who wander!<br> When from the hoof of your strong horse ye showered a hundred jars of honey for the people.<br> 7 To Kṛṣṇa's son, to Viśvaka who praised you, O Heroes, ye restored his son Viṣṇāpū.<br> To Ghoṣā, living in her father's dwelling, stricken in years, ye gave a husband, Aśvins.<br> 8 Ruṣatī, of the mighty people, Aśvins, ye gave to Śyāva of the line of Kaṇva.<br> This deed of yours, ye Strong Ones should be published, that ye gave glory to the son of Nṛṣad.<br> 9 O Aśvins, wearing many forms at pleasure, on Pedu ye bestowed a fleet-foot courser,<br> Strong, winner of a thousand spoils, resistless the serpent slayer, glorious, triumphant.<br> 10 These glorious things are yours, ye Bounteous Givers; prayer, praise in both worlds are your habitation.<br> O Aśvins, when the sons of Pajra call you, send strength with nourishment to him who knoweth.<br> 11 Hymned with the reverence of a son, O Aśvins ye Swift Ones giving booty to the singer,<br> Glorified by Agastya with devotion, established Viśpalā again, Nāsatyas.<br> 12 Ye Sons of Heaven, ye Mighty, whither went ye, sought ye, for his fair praise the home of Kāvya.<br> When, like a pitcher full of gold, O Aśvins, on the tenth day ye lifted up the buried?<br> 13 Ye with the aid of your great powers, O Aśvins, restored to youth the ancient man Cyavāna.<br> The Daughter of the Sun with all her glory, O ye Nāsatyas, chose your car to bear her.<br> 14 Ye, ever-youthful Ones, again remembered Tugra, according to your ancient manner:<br> With horses brown of hue that flew with swift wings ye brought back Bhujyu from the sea of billows.<br> 15 The son of Tugra had invoked you, Aśvins; borne on he went uninjured through the ocean.<br> Ye with your chariot swift as thought, well-harnessed, carried him off, O Mighty Ones, to safety.<br> 16 The quail had invocated you, O Aśvins, when from the wolf's devouring jaws ye freed her.<br> With conquering car ye cleft the mountain's ridges: the offspring of Viśvāc ye killed with poison.<br> 17 He whom for furnishing a hundred wethers to the she-wolf, his wicked father blinded,<br> To him, Ṛjrāśva, gave ye eyes, O Aśvins; light to the blind ye sent for perfect vision.<br> 18 To bring the blind man joy thus cried the she-wolf: O Aśvins, O ye Mighty Ones, O Heroes,<br> For me Ṛjrāśva, like a youthful lover, hath. cut piecemeal one and a hundred wethers.<br> 19 Great and weal-giving is your aid, O Aśvins, ye, objects of all thought, made whole the cripple.<br> Purandhi also for this cause invoked you, and ye, O mighty, came to her with succours.<br> 20 Ye, Wonder-Workers, filled with milk for Śayu the milkless cow, emaciated, barren;<br> And by your powers the child of Purumitra ye brought to Vimada to be his consort.<br> 21 Ploughing and sowing barley, O ye Aśvins, milking out food for men, ye Wonder-Workers,<br> Blasting away the Dasyu with your trumpet, ye gave far-spreading light unto the Ārya.<br> 22 Ye brought the horse's head, Aśvins, and gave it unto Dadhyac the offspring of Atharvan.<br> True, he revealed to you, O Wonder-Workers, sweet Soma, Tvaṣṭar's secret, as your girdle.<br> 23 O Sages, evermore I crave your favour: be gracious unto all my prayers, O Aśvins.<br> Grant me, Nāsatyas, riches in abundance, wealth famous and accompanied with children.<br> 24 With liberal bounty to the weakling's consorts ye, Heroes, gave a son Hiraṇyahasta;<br> And Śyāva, cut into three several pieces, ye brought to life again, O bounteous Aśvins.<br> 25 These your heroic exploits, O ye Aśvins, done in the days. of old, have men related.<br> May we, addressing prayer to you, ye Mighty, speak with brave sons about us to the synod.</p>
