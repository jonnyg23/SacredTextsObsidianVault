 <p>1. THEN was not non-existent nor existent: there was no realm of air, no sky beyond it.<br> What covered in, and where? and what gave shelter? Was water there, unfathomed depth of water?<br> 2 Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there, the day's and night's divider.<br> That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.<br> 3 Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos.<br> All that existed then was void and form less: by the great power of Warmth was born that Unit.<br> 4 Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit.<br> Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent.<br> 5 Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it then, and what below it?<br> There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action here and energy up yonder<br> 6 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation?<br> The Gods are later than this world's production. Who knows then whence it first came into being?<br> 7 He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it,<br> Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not.</p>
