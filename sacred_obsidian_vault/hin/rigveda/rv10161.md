 <p>1. FOR life I set thee free by this oblation from the unknown decline and from Consumption;<br> Or, if the grasping demon have possessed him, free him from her, O Indra, thou and Agni.<br> 2 Be his days ended, be he now departed, be he brought very near to death already,<br> Out of Destruction's lap again I bring him, save him for life to last a hundred autumns.<br> 3 With hundred-eyed oblation, hundred-autumned, bringing a hundred lives, have I restored him,<br> That Indra for a hundred years may lead him safe to the farther shore of all misfortune.<br> 4 Live, waxing in thy strength, a hundred autumns, live through a hundred springs, a hundred winters.<br> Through hundred-lived oblation Indra, Agni, Bṛhaspati, Savitar yield him for a hundred!<br> 5 So have I found and rescued thee thou hast returned with youth renewed.<br> Whole in thy members! I have found thy sight and all thy life for thee.</p>
