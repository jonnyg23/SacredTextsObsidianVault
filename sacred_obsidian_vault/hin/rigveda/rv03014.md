 <p>1 THE pleasant Priest is come into the synod, true, skilled in sacrifice, most wise, Ordainer.<br> Agni, the Son of Strength, whose car is lightning, whose hair is flame, hath shown on earth his lustre.<br> 2 To thee I offer reverent speech: accept it: to thee who markest it, victorious, faithful!<br> Bring, thou who knowest, those who know, and seat thee amid the sacred grass, for help, O Holy.<br> 3 The Two who show their vigour, Night and Morning, by the wind's paths shall haste to thee O Agni.<br> When men adorn the Ancient with oblations, these seek, as on two chariot-seats, the dwelling.<br> 4 To thee, strong Agni! Varuṇa and Mitra and all the Maruts sang a song of triumph,<br> What time unto the people's lands thou camest, spreading them as the Sun of men, with lustre.<br> 5 Approaching with raised hands and adoration, we have this day fulfilled for thee thy longing.<br> Worship the Gods with most devoted spirit, a Priest with no unfriendly thought, O Agni.<br> 6 For, Son of Strength, from thee come many succours, and powers abundant that a God possesses.<br> Agni, to us with speech that hath no falsehood grant riches, real, to be told in thousands.<br> 7 Whatever, God, in sacrifice we mortals have wrought is all for thee, strong, wise of purpose!<br> Be thou the Friend of each good chariot's master. All this enjoy thou here, immortal Agni.</p>
