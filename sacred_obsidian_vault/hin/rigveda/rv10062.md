 <p>1. YE, who, adorned with guerdon through the sacrifice, have won you Indra's friendship and eternal life,<br> Even to you be happiness, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.<br> 2 The Fathers, who drave forth the wealth in cattle, have in the year's courses cleft Vala by Eternal Law:<br> A lengthened life be yours, O ye Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.<br> 3 Ye raised the Sun to heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad earth, the Mother, out on every side.<br> Fair wealth of progeny be yours, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.<br> 4 This kinsman in your dwellingplace speaks pleasant words: give car to this, ye Ṛṣis, children of the Gods.<br> High Brahman dignity be yours, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.<br> 5 Distinguished by their varied form, these Ṛṣis have been deeply moved.<br> These are the sons of Aṅgirases: from Agni have they sprung to life.<br> 6 Distinguished by their varied form, they sprang from Agni, from the sky.<br> Navagva and Daśagva, noblest Aṅgiras, he giveth bounty with the Gods.<br> 7 With Indra for associate the priests have cleared the stable full of steeds and kine,<br> Giving to me a thousand with their eightmarked cars, they gained renown among the Gods.<br> 8 May this man's sons be multiplied; like springing corn may Manu grow,<br> Who gives at once in bounteous gift a thousand kine, a hundred steeds.<br> 9 No one attains to him, as though a man would grasp the heights of heaven.<br> Savarnya's sacrificial meed hath broadened like an ample flood.<br> 10 Yadu and Turva, too, have given two Dāsas, well-disposed, to serve,<br> Together with great store of kine.<br> 11 Blest be the hamlet's chief, most liberal Manu, and may his bounty rival that of Sūrya.<br> May the God let Ssvarni's life be leng<br> thened, with whom, unwearied, we have lived and prospered.</p>
