 <p>1. STRONG rapturous joy, praise, glory are with Indra: impetuous God, he quaffs the juice of Soma:<br> That Maghavan whom men must laud with singing, Heaven-dweller, King of songs, whose help is lasting.<br> 2 He, Friend of man, most wise, victorious Hero, hears, with far-reaching aid, the singer call him.<br> Excellent, Praise of Men, the bard's Supporter, Strong, he gives strength, extolled in holy synod.<br> 3 The lofty axle of thy wheels, O Hero, is not surpassed by heaven and earth in greatness.<br> Like branches of a tree, Invoked of many manifold aids spring forth from thee, O Indra.<br> 4 Strong Lord, thine energies, endowed with vigour, are like the paths of kine converging homeward.<br> Like bonds of cord, Indra, that bind the younglings, no bonds are they, O thou of boundless bounty.<br> 5 One act to-day, another act tomorrow oft Indra makes what is not yet existeni.<br> Here have we Mitra, Varuṇa, and Pūṣan to overcome the foeman's domination.<br> 6 By song and sacrifice men brought the waters from thee, as from a mountain's ridge, O Indra.<br> Urging thy might, with these fair lauds they seek thee, O theme of song, as horses rush tobattle.<br> 7 That Indra whom nor months nor autumn seasons wither with age, nor fleeting days enfeeble,<br> Still may his body Wax, een now so mighty, glorified by the lauds and hymns that praise him.<br> 8 Extolled, he bends not to the strong, the steadfast, nor to the bold incited by the Dasyu.<br> High mountains are as level plains to Indra: even in the deep he finds firm ground to rest on.<br> 9 Impetuous Speeder through all depth and distance, give strengthening food, thou drinker of the juices.<br> Stand up erect to help us, unreluctant, what time the gloom of night brightens to morning.<br> 10 Hasting to help, come hither and protect him, keep him from harm when he is here, O Indra.<br> At home, abroad, from injury preserve him. May brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters.</p>
