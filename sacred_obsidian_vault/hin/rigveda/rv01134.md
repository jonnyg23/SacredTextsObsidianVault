 <p>1. VĀYU, let fleet-foot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast, to drink first of the juice we pour, to the first draught of Soma juice.<br> May our glad hymn, discerning well, uplifted, gratify thy mind.<br> Come with thy team-drawn car, O Vāyu, to the gift, come to the sacrificer's gift.<br> 2 May the joy-giving drops, O Vāyu gladden thee, effectual, well prepared, directed to the heavens, strong, blent with milk and seeking heaven;<br> That aids, effectual to fulfil, may wait upon our skilful power.<br> Associate teams come hitherward to grant our prayers: they shall address the hymns we sing.<br> 3 Two red steeds Vāyu yokes, Vāyu two purple steeds, swift-footed, to the chariot, to the pole to draw, most able, at the pole, to draw.<br> Wake up intelligence, as when a lover wakes his sleeping love.<br> Illumine heaven and earth, make thou the Dawns to shine, for glory make the Dawns to shine.<br> 4 For thee the radiant Dawns in the far-distant sky broaden their lovely garments forth in wondrous beams, bright-coloured in their new-born beams.<br> For thee the nectar-yielding Cow pours all rich treasures forth as milk.<br> The Marut host hast thou engendered from the womb, the Maruts from the womb of heaven.<br> 5 For thee the pure bright quickly-flowing Soma-drops, strong in their heightening power, hasten to mix themselves, hasten to the water to be mixed.<br> To thee the weary coward prays for luck that he may speed away.<br> Thou by thy law protectest us from every world, yea, from the world of highest Gods.<br> 6 Thou, Vāyu, who hast none before thee, first of all hast right to drink these offerings of Soma juice, hast right to drink the juice out-poured,<br> Yea, poured by all invoking tribes who free themselves from taint of sin,<br> For thee all cows are milked to yield the Soma-milk, to yield the butter and the milk.</p>
