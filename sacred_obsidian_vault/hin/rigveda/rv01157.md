 <p>1. AGNI is wakened: Sūrya riseth from the earth. Mighty, refulgent Dawn hath shone with all her light.<br> The Aśvins have equipped their chariot for the course. God Savitar hath moved the folk in sundry ways.<br> 2 When, Aśvins, ye equip your very mighty car, bedew, ye Twain, our power with honey and with oil.<br> To our devotion give victorious strength in war: may we win riches in the heroes' strife for spoil.<br> 3 Nigh to us come the Aśvins' lauded three-wheeled car, the car laden with meath and drawn by fleet-foot steeds,<br> Three-seated, opulent, bestowing all delight. may it bring weal to us, to cattle and to men.<br> 4 Bring hither nourishment for us, ye Aśvins Twain; sprinkle us with your whip that drops with honey-dew.<br> Prolong our days of life, wipe out our trespasses; destroy our foes, be our companions and our Friends.<br> 5 Ye store the germ of life in female creatures, ye lay it up within all living beings.<br> Ye have sent forth, O Aśvins passing mighty, the fire, the sovrans of the wood, the waters,<br> 6 Leeches are ye with medicines to heal us, and charioteers are ye with skill in driving.<br> Ye Strong, give sway to him who brings oblation and with his heart pours out his gift before you.</p>
