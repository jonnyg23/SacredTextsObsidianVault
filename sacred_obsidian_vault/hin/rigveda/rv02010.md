 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN X. Agni.</h3>  
 <p>1. AGNI, first, loudly calling, like a Father, kindled by man upon the seat of worship.<br> Clothed in his glory, deathless, keen of insight, must be adorned by all, the Strong, the Famous.<br> 2 May Agni the resplendent hear my calling through all my songs, Immortal, keen of insight.<br> Dark steeds or ruddy draw his car, or carried in sundry ways he makes them red of colour.<br> 3 On wood supine they got the well-formed Infant: a germ in various-fashioned plants was Agni;<br> And in the night, not compassed round by darkness, he dwells exceeding wise, with rays of splendour.<br> 4 With oil and sacred gifts I sprinkle Agni who makes his home in front of all things living,<br> Broad, vast, through vital power oer all expanded, conspicuous, strong with all the food that feeds him.<br> 5 I pour to him who looks in all directions: may he accept it with a friendly spirit.<br> Agni with bridegroom's grace and lovely colour may not be touched when all his form is fury.<br> 6 By choice victorious, recognize thy portion: with thee for envoy may we speak like Manu.<br> Obtaining wealth, I call on perfect Agni who with an eloquent tongue dispenses sweetness.</p>
