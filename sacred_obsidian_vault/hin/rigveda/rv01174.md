 <p>1. THOU art the King of all the Gods, O Indra: protect the men, O Asura, preserve us.<br> Thou Lord of Heroes, Maghavan, our saver, art faithful, very rich, the victory-giver.<br> 2 Indra, thou humbledst tribes that spake with insult by breaking down seven autumn forts, their refuge.<br> Thou stirredst, Blameless! billowy floods, and gavest his foe a prey to youthful Purukutsa.<br> 3 With whom thou drivest troops whose lords are heroes, and bringest daylight now, much worshipped Indra,<br> With them guard lion-like wasting active Agni to dwell in our tilled fields and in our homestead.<br> 4 They through the greatness of thy spear, O Indra, shall, to thy praise, rest in this earthly station.<br> To loose the floods, to seek, for kine, the battle, his Bays he mounted boldly seized the booty.<br> 5 Indra, bear Kutsa, him in whom thou joyest: the dark-red horses of the Wind are docile.<br> Let the Sun roll his chariot wheel anear us, and let the Thunderer go to meet the foemen.<br> 6 Thou Indra, Lord of Bays, made strong by impulse, hast slain the vexers of thy friends, who give not.<br> They who beheld the Friend beside the living were cast aside by thee as they rode onward.<br> 7 Indra, the bard sang forth in inspiration: thou madest earth a covering for the Dāsa.<br> Maghavan made the three that gleam with moisture, and to his home brought Kuyavāc to slay him.<br> 8 These thine old deeds new bards have sung, O Indra. Thou conqueredst, boundest many tribes for ever.<br> Like castles thou hast crushed the godless races, and bowed the godless scorner's deadly weapon.<br> 9 A Stormer thou hast made the stormy waters flow down, O Indra, like the running rivers.<br> When oer the flood thou broughtest them, O Hero, thou keptest Turvaśa and Yadu safely.<br> 10 Indra, mayst thou be ours in all occasions, protector of the men, most gentle-hearted,<br> Giving us victory over all our rivals. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
