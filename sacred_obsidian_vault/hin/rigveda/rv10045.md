 <p>1. FIRST Agni sprang to life from out of Heaven: the second time from us came Jātavedas.<br> Thirdly the Manly-souled was in the waters. The pious lauds and kindles him the Eternal.<br> 2 Agni, we know thy three powers in three stations, we know thy forms in many a place divided.<br> We know what name supreme thou hast in secret: we know the source from which thou hast proceeded.<br> 3 The Manly-souled lit thee in sea and waters, man's Viewer lit thee in the breast of heaven,<br> There as thou stoodest in the third high region the Steers increased thee in the water's bosom.<br> 4 Agni roared out, like Dyaus what time he thunders: he licked the ground about the plants he flickered.<br> At once, when born, he looked around enkindled, and lightened heaven and earth within with splendour.<br> 5 The spring of glories and support of riches, rouser of thoughts and guardian of the Soma,<br> Good Son of Strength, a King amid the waters, in forefront of the Dawns he shines enkindled.<br> 6 Germ of the world, ensign of all creation, be sprang to life and filled the earth and heavens.<br> Even the firm rock he cleft when passing over, when the Five Tribes brought sacrifice to Agni.<br> 7 So among mortals was Immortal Agni stablished as holy wise and willing envoy.<br> He waves the red smoke that he lifts above him, striving to reach the heavens with radiant lustre.<br> 8 Like gold to look on, far he shone refulgent, beaming imperishable life for glory,<br> Agni by vital powers became immortal when his prolific Father Dyaus begat him.<br> 9 Whoso this day, O God whose flames are lovely, prepares a cake, O Agni, mixt with butter,<br> Lead thou and further him to higher fortune, to bliss bestowed by Gods, O thou Most Youthful.<br> 10 Endow him, Agni, with a share of glory, at every song of praise sung forth enrich him.<br> Dear let him be to Sūrya, dear to Agni, preeminent with son and children's children.<br> 11 While, Agni, day by day men pay thee worship they win themselves all treasures worth the wishing.<br> Allied with thee, eager and craving riches, they have disclosed the stable filled with cattle.<br> 12 Agni, the Friend of men, the Soma's keeper, Vaiśvānara, hath been lauded by the Ṛṣis.<br> We will invoke benignant Earth and Heaven: ye Deities, give us wealth with hero children.</p>
