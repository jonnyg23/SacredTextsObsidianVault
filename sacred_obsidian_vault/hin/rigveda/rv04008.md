 <p>1. YOUR envoy who possesses all, Immortal, bearer of your gifts,<br> Best worshipper, I woo with song.<br> 2 He, Mighty, knows the gift of wealth, he knows the deep recess of heaven:<br> He shall bring hitherward the Gods.<br> 3 He knows, a God himself, to guide Gods to the righteous in his home:<br> He gives een treasures that we love.<br> 4 He is the Herald: well-informed, he doth his errand to and fro,<br> Knowing the deep recess of heaven.<br> 5 May we be they who gratify Agni with sacrificial gifts,<br> Who cherish and enkindle him.<br> 6 Illustrious for wealth are they, and hero deeds, victorious,<br> Who have served Agni reverently.<br> 7 So unto us, day after day, may riches craved by many come,<br> And power and might spring up for us.<br> 8 That holy Singer in his strength shoots forth his arrows swifter than<br> The swift shafts of the tribes of men.</p>
