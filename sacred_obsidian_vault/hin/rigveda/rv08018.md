 <p>1. Now let the mortal offer prayer to win the unexampled grace<br> Of these Ādityas and their aid to cherish life.<br> 2 For not an enemy molests the paths which these Ādityas tread:<br> Infallible guards, they strengthen us in happiness.<br> 3 Now soon may Bhaga, Savitar, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman<br> Give us the shelter widely spread which we implore.<br> 4 With Gods come thou whose fostering care none checks, O Goddesss Aditi:<br> Come, dear to many, with the Lords who guard us well.<br> 5 For well these Sons of Aditi know to keep enmities aloof,<br> Unrivalled, giving ample room, they save from woe.<br> 6 Aditi guard our herd by day, Aditi, free from guile, by night,<br> Aditi, ever strengthening, save us from grief!<br> 7 And in the day our hymn is this: May Aditi come nigh to help,<br> With loving-kindness bring us weal and chase our foes.<br> 8 And may the Aśvins, the divine Pair of Physicians, send us health:<br> May they remove iniquity and chase our foes.<br> 9 May Agni bless us with his fires, and Sūrya warm us pleasantly:<br> May the pure Wind breathe sweet on us, and chase our foes.<br> 10 Drive ye disease and strife away, drive ye away malignity:<br> Ādityas, keep us ever far from sore distress.<br> 11 Remove from us the arrow, keep famine, Ādityas! far away:<br> Keep enmities afar from us, Lords of all wealth!<br> 12 Now, O Ādityas, grant to us the shelter that lets man go free,<br> Yea, even the sinner from his sin, ye Bounteous Gods 1<br> 13 Whatever mortal with the powe r of demons fain would injure us,<br> May he, impetuous, suffer harm by his own deeds.<br> 14 May sin oertake our human foe, the man who speaketh evil thing,<br> Him who would cause our misery, whose heart is false.<br> 15 Gods, ye are with the simple ones, ye know each mortal in your hearts;<br> Ye, Vasus, well discriminate the false and true.<br> 16 Fain would we have the sheltering aid of mountains and of water-floods:<br> Keep far from us iniquity, O Heaven and Earth.<br> 17 So with auspicious sheltering aid do ye, O Vasus, carry us<br> Beyond all trouble and distress, borne in your ship.<br> 18 Ādityas, ye Most Mighty Ones, grant to our children and their seed<br> Extended term of life that they may live long days.<br> 19 Sacrifice, O Ādityas, is your inward monitor: be kind,<br> For in the bond of kindred we are bound to you.<br> 20 The Maruts high protecting aid, the Aśvins, and the God who saves,<br> Mitra and Varuṇa for weal we supplicate.<br> 21 Grant us a home with triple guard, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa!<br> Unthreatened, Maruts! meet for praise, and filled with men.<br> 22 And as we human beings, O Ādityas, are akin to death,<br> Graciously lengthen ye our lives that we may live.</p>
