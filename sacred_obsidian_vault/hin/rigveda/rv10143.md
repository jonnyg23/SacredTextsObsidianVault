 <p>1. YE made that Atri, worn with eld, free as a horse to win the goal.<br> When ye restored to youth and strength Kakṣīvān like a car renewed,<br> 2 Ye freed that Atri like a horse, and brought him newly-born to earth.<br> Ye loosed him like a firm-tied knot which Gods unsoiled by dust had bound.<br> 3 Heroes who showed most wondrous power to Atri, strive to win fair songs;<br> For then, O Heroes of the sky, your hymn of praise shall cease no more.<br> 4 This claims your notice, Bounteous Gods! - oblation, Aśvins! and our love,<br> That ye, O Heroes, in the fight may bring us safe to ample room.<br> 5 Ye Twain to Bhujyu tossed about in ocean at the region's end,<br> Nāsatyas, with your winged sterds came nigh, and gave him strength to win.<br> 6 Come with your joys, most liberal Gods, Lords of all treasures, bringing weal.<br> Like fresh full waters to a well, so, Heroes come and be with us.</p>
