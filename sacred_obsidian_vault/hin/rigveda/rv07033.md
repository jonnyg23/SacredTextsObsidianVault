 <p>1. THESE who wear hair-knots on the right, the movers of holy thought, white-robed, have won me over.<br> I warned the men, when from the grass I raised me, Not from afar can my Vasisthas help you.<br> 2 With <a href="errata.htm#18">Soma</a> they brought Indra from a distance, Over Vaisanta, from the strong libation.<br> Indra preferred Vasisthas to the Soma pressed by the son of Vayata, Pasadyumna.<br> 3 So, verily, with these he crossed the river, in company with these he slaughtered Bheda.<br> So in the fight with the Ten Kings, Vasisthas! did Indra help Sudās through your devotions.<br> 4 I gladly, men I with prayer prayed by our fathers have fixed your axle: ye shall not be injured:<br> Since, when ye sang aloud the Sakvari verses, Vasisthas! ye invigorated Indra.<br> 5 Like thirsty men they looked to heaven, in battle with the Ten Kings, surrounded and imploring.<br> Then Indra heard Vasiṣṭha as he praised him, and gave the Trtsus ample room and freedom.<br> 6 Like sticks and staves wherewith they drive the cattle, Stripped bare, the Bharatas were found defenceless:<br> Vasiṣṭha then became their chief and leader: then widely. were the Trtsus' clans extended.<br> 7 Three fertilize the worlds with genial moisture: three noble Creatures cast a light before them.<br> Three that give warmth to all attend the morning. All these have they discovered, these Vasisthas.<br> 8 Like the Sun's growing glory is their splendour, and like the sea's is their unflathomed greatness.<br> Their course is like the wind's. Your laud, Vasisthas, can never be attained by any other.<br> 9 They with perceptions of the heart in secret resort to that which spreads a thousand branches.<br> The Apsaras brought hither the Vasisthas wearing the vesture spun for them by Yama.<br> 10 A form of lustre springing from the lightning wast thou, when Varuṇa and Mitra saw thee.<br> Tliy one and only birth was then, Vasiṣṭha, when from thy stock Agastya brought thee hither.<br> 11 Born of their love for Urvasi, Vasiṣṭha thou, priest, art son of Varuṇa and Mitra;<br> And as a fallen drop, in heavenly fervour, all the Gods laid thee on a lotus-blossorn.<br> 12 He thinker, knower both of earth and heaven, endowed with many a gift, bestowing thousands,<br> Destined to wear the vesture spun by Yama, sprang from the Apsaras to life, Vasiṣṭha.<br> 13 Born at the sacrifice, urged by adorations, both with a common flow bedewed the pitcher.<br> Then from the midst thereof there rose up Māna, and thence they say was born the sage Vasiṣṭha.<br> 14 He brings the bearer of the laud and Sāman: first shall he speak bringing the stone for pressing.<br> With grateful hearts in reverence approach him: to you, O Pratrdas, Vasiṣṭha cometh.</p>
