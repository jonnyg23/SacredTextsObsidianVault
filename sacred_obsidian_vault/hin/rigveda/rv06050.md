 <p>1. I CALL with prayers on Aditi your Goddess, on Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa for favour,<br> On Aryaman who gives unasked, the gracious, on Gods who save, on Savitar and Bhaga.<br> 2 Visit, to prove us free from sin, O Sūrya Lord of great might, the bright Gods sprung from Dakṣa,<br> Twice-born and true, observing sacred duties, Holy and full of light, whose tongue is Agni.<br> 3 And, O ye Heaven and Earth, a wide dominion, O ye most blissful Worlds, our lofty shelter,<br> Give ample room and freedom for our dwelling, a home, ye Hemispheres, which none may rival.<br> 4 This day invited may the Sons of Rudra, resistless, excellent, stoop down to meet us;<br> For, when beset with slight or sore affliction, we ever call upon the Gods, the Maruts;<br> 5 To whom the Goddess Rodasī clings closely, whom Pūṣan follows bringing ample bounty.<br> What time ye hear our call and come, O Maruts, upon your separate path all creatures tremble.<br> 6 With a new hymn extol, O thou who singest, the Lover of the Song, the Hero Indra.<br> May he, exalted, hear our invocation, and grant us mighty wealth and strength when lauded.<br> 7 Give full protection, Friends of man, ye Waters, in peace and trouble, to our sons and grandsons.<br> For ye are our most motherly physicians, parents of all that standeth, all that moveth.<br> 8 May Savitar come hither and approach us, the God who rescues, Holy, goldenhanded,<br> The God who, bounteous as the face of Morning, discloses precious gifts for him who worships.<br> 9 And thou, O Son of Strength, do thou turn hither the Gods to-day to this our holy service.<br> May I for evermore enjoy thy bounty and, Agni, by thy grace be rich in heroes.<br> 10 Come also to my call, O ye Nāsatyas, yea, verily, through my prayers, ye Holy Sages.<br> As from great darkness ye delivered Atri, protect us, Chiefs, from danger in the conflict.<br> 11 O Gods, bestow upon us riches, splendid with strength and heroes, bringing food in plenty.<br> Be gracious, helpful Gods of earth, of heaven, born of the Cow, and dwellers in the waters.<br> 12 May Rudra and Sarasvatī, accordant, Viṣṇu and Vāyu, pour down gifts and bless us;<br> Ṛbhukṣan, Vāja, and divine Vidhatar, Parjanya, Vāta make our food abundant.<br> 13 May this God Savitar, the Lord, the Offspring of Waters, pouring down his dew be gracious,<br> And, with the Gods and Dames accordant, Tvaṣṭar; Dyaus with the Gods and Prthivi with oceans.<br> 14 May Aja-Ekapād and Ahibudhnya, and Earth and Ocean hear our invocation;<br> All Gods who strengthen Law, invoked and lauded, and holy texts uttered by sages, help us.<br> 15 So with my thoughts and hymns of praise the children of Bharadvāja sing aloud to please you.<br> The Dames invoked, and the resistless Vasus, and all ye Holy Ones have been exalted.</p>
