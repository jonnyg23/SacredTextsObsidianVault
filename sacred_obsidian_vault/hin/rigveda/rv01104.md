 <p>1. THE altar hath been made for thee to rest on: come like a panting courser and be seated.<br> Loosen thy flying Steeds, set free thy Horses who bear thee swiftly nigh at eve and morning.<br> 2 These men have come to Indra for assistance: shall he not quickly come upon these pathways?<br> May the Gods quell the fury of the Dāsa, and may they lead our folk to happy fortune.<br> 3 He who hath only wish as his possession casts on himself, casts foam amid the waters.<br> Both wives of Kuyava in milk have bathed them: may they be drowned within the depth of Śiphā.<br> 4 This hath his kinship checked who lives beside us: with ancient streams forth speeds and rules the Hero,<br> Añjasī, Kuliśī, and Virapatnī, delighting him, bear milk upon their waters.<br> 5 Soon as this Dasyu's traces were discovered, as she who knows her home, he sought the dwelling.<br> Now think thou of us, Maghavan, nor cast us away as doth a profligate his treasure.<br> 6 Indra, as such, give us a share of sunlight, of waters, sinlessness, and reputation.<br> Do thou no harm to our yet unborn offspring: our trust is in thy mighty Indra-power.<br> 7 Now we, I think, in thee as such have trusted: lead us on, Mighty One, to ample riches.<br> In no unready house give us, O Indra invoked of many, food and drink when hungry.<br> 8 Slay us not, Indra; do not thou forsake us: steal not away the joys which we delight in.<br> Rend not our unborn brood, strong Lord of Bounty! our vessels with the life that is within them.<br> 9 Come to us; they have called thee Soma-lover: here is the pressed juice. Drink thereof for rapture.<br> Widely-capacious, pour it down within thee, and, invocated, hear us like a Father.</p>
