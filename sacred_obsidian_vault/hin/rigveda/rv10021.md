 <p>1. WITH offerings of our own we choose thee, Agni, as Invoking Priest,<br> For sacrifice with trimmed grass,at your glad carouse-piercing and brightly shining. Thou art waxing great.<br> 2 The wealthy ones adorn thee, they who bring us horses as their gift:<br> The sprinkling ladle, Agni,at your glad carouse -and glowing offering taste thee. Thou art waxing great.<br> 3 The holy statutes rest by thee, as twere with ladles that oerflow.<br> Black and white-gleaming colours,at your glad carouse-all glories thou assurnest. Thou art waxing great.<br> 4 O Agni, what thou deemest wealth, Victorious and Immortal One!<br> Bring thou to give us vigour,at your glad carouse -splendid at sacrifices. Thou art waxing great.<br> 5 Skilled in all lore is Agni, he whom erst Atharvan brought to life.<br> He was Vivasvān's envoy, at your glad carouse-the weIl-loved friend of Yama, Thou art waxing great.<br> 6 At sacrifices they adore thee, Agni, when the rite proceeds.<br> All fair and lovely treasures-at your glad carouse-thou givest him who offers. Thou art waxing great.<br> 7 Men, Agni, have established thee as welcome Priest at holy rites,<br> Thee whose face shines with butter,at your glad carouse-bright, with eyes most observant. Thou art waxing great.<br> 8 Wide and aloft thou spreadest thee, O Agni, with thy brilliant flame.<br> A Bull art thou when bellowing,at your glad carouse-thou dost impregn the Sisters. Thou art waxing great.</p>
