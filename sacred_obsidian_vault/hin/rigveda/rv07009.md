 <p>1. ROUSED from their bosom is the Dawns' beloved, the joyous Priest, most sapient, Purifier.<br> He gives a signal both to Gods and mortals, to Gods oblations, riches to the pious.<br> 2 Most wise is he who, forcing doors of Paṇis, brought the bright Sun to us who feedeth many.<br> The cheerful Priest, men's Friend and home-companion, through still night's darkness he is made apparent.<br> 3 Wise, ne.'er deceived, uncircumscribed, refulgent, our gracious guest, a Friend with good attendants,<br> Shines forth with wondrous light before the Mornings; the young plants hath he entered, Child of Waters.<br> 4 Seeking our gatherings, he, your Jātavedas, hath shone adorable through human ages,<br> Who gleams refulgent with his lovely lustre: the kine have waked to meet him when enkindled.<br> 5 Go on thy message to the Gods, and fail not, O Agni, with their band who pray and worship.<br> Bring all the Gods that they may give us riches, Sarasvatī, the Maruts, Aśvins, Waters.<br> 6 Vasiṣṭha, when enkindling thee, O Agni, hath slain jarutha. Give us wealth in plenty.<br> Sing praise in choral song, O Jātavedas. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
