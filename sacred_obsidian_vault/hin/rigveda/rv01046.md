 <p>1 Now Morning with her earliest light shines forth, dear Daughter of the Sky:<br> High, Aśvins, I extol your praise,<br> 2 Sons of the Sea, mighty to save discoverers of riches, ye<br> Gods with deep thought who find out wealth.<br> 3 Your giant coursers hasten on over the region all in flames, <br> When your car flies with winged steeds.<br> 4 He, liberal, lover of the flood, Lord of the House, the vigilant,<br> Chiefs! with oblations feeds you full.<br> 5 Ye have regard unto our hymns, Nāsatyas, thinking of our words:<br> Drink boldly of the Soma juice.<br> 6 Vouchsafe to us, O Aśvin Pair, such strength as, with attendant light,<br> May through the darkness carry us.<br> 7 Come in the ship of these our hymns to bear you to the hither shore<br> O Aśvins, harness ye the car.<br> 8 The heaven's wide vessel is your own on the flood's shore your chariot waits<br> Drops, with the hymn, have been prepared.<br> 9 Kaṇvas, the drops are in the heaven; the wealth is at the waters' place:<br> Where will ye manifest your form?<br> 10 Light came to lighten up the branch, the Sun appeared as it were gold:<br> And with its tongue shone forth the dark.<br> 11 The path of sacrifice was made to travel to the farther goal:<br> The road of heaven was manifest.<br> 12 The singer of their praise awaits whatever grace the Aśvins give,<br> who save when Soma gladdens them.<br> 13 Ye dwellers with Vivasvān come, auspicious, as to Manu erst;<br> come to the Soma and our praise.<br> 14 O circumambient Aśvins, Dawn follows the brightness of your way:<br> Approve with beams our solemn rites.<br> 15 Drink ye of our libations, grant protection, O ye Aśvins Twain,<br> With aids which none may interrupt.</p>
