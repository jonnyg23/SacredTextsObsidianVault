 <p>1. FORWARD upon their way proceed the ready teams, the lovely songs.<br> Further them glorious Pūṣan with yoked chariot, and the Mighty Twain!<br> 2 With sacred hymns let this man here, this singer, win the God to whom<br> Belong this majesty and might. He hath observed our eulogies.<br> 3 Pūṣan the Strong hath knowledge of sweet praises even as Indu hath.<br> He dews our corn with moisture, he bedews the pasture of our kine.<br> 4 We will bethink ourselves of thee, O Pūṣan, O thou God, as One.<br> Who brings fulfilment of our hymns, and stirs the singer and the sage.<br> 5 joint-sharer of each sacrifice, the driver of the chariot steeds;<br> The Ṛṣi who is good to man, the singer's Friend and faithful Guard.<br> 6 One who is Lord of Suca, Lord of Suca caring for herself:<br> Weaving the raiment of the sheep and making raiment beautiful.<br> 7 The mighty Lord of spoil and wealth, Strong Friend of all prosperity;<br> He with light movement shakes his beard, lovely and neer to be deceived.<br> 8 O Pūṣan, may those goats of thine turn hitherward thy chariot-pole.<br> Friend of all suppliants; art thou, born in old time, and arm and sure.<br> 9 May the majestic Pūṣan speed our chariot with his power and might.<br> May he increase our store of wealth and listen to this call of ours.</p>
