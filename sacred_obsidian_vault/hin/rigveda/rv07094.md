 <p>1. As rain from out the cloud, for you, Indra and Agni, from my soul<br> This noblest praise hath been produced.<br> 2 Do ye, O Indra-Agni, hear the singer's call: accept his songs.<br> Ye Rulers, grant his heart's desire.<br> 3 Give us not up to poverty, ye Heroes, Indra-Agni, nor<br> To slander and reproach of men.<br> 4 To Indra and to Agni we bring reverence, high and holy hymn,<br> And, craving help, softwords with prayer.<br> 5 For all these holy singers here implore these Twain to succour them,<br> And priests that they may win them strength.<br> 6 Eager to laudyou, we with songs invoke you, bearing sacred food,<br> Fain for success in sacrifice.<br> 7 Indra and Agni, come to us with favour, ye who conquer men:<br> Let not the wicked master us.<br> 8 At no time let the injurious blow of hostile mortal fall on us:<br> O Indra-Agni, shelter us.<br> 9 Whatever wealth we crave of you, in gold, in cattle, or in steeds,<br> That, Indra-Agni, let us gain;<br> 10 When heroes prompt in worship call Indra and Agni, Lords of steeds,<br> Beside the Soma juice effused.<br> 11 Call hither with the song and lauds those who best slay the foemen, those<br> Who take delight in hymns of praise.<br> 12 Slay ye the wicked man whose thought is evil of the demon kind.<br> Slay him who stays the waters, slay the Serpent with your deadly dart.</p>
