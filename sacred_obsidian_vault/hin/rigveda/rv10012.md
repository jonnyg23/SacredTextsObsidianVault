 <p>1. HEAVEN and Earth, first by everlasting Order, speakers of truth, are near enough to hear us,<br> When the God, urging men to worship. sitteth as Priest, assuming all his vital vigour.<br> 2 As God comprising Gods by Law Eternal, bear, as the Chief who knoweth, our oblation,<br> Smoke-bannered with the fuel, radiant, joyous, better to praise and worship, Priest for ever.<br> 3 When the cow's nectar wins the God completely, men here below are heaven's sustainers.<br> All the Gods came to this thy heavenly Yajus which from the motley Pair milked oil and water.<br> 4 1 praise your work that ye may make me prosper: hear, Heaven and Earth, Twain Worlds that drop with fatness.<br> While days and nights go to the world of spirits, here let the Parents with sweet meath refresh us<br> 5 Hath the King siezed us? How have we offended against his holy ordinance? Who knoweth?<br> For even Mitra mid the Gods is angry there are both song and strength for those who come not.<br> 6 Tis hard to understand the Immortal's nature, where she who is akin becomes astranger.<br> Guard ceaselessly, great Agni, him who ponders Yama's name, easy to be comprehended.<br> 7 They in the synod where the Gods rejoice them, where they are seated in Vivasvān's dwelling,<br> Have given the Moon his beams, the Sun his splendour-the Two unweariedly maintain their brightness.<br> 8 The counsel which the Gods meet to consider, their secret plan,of that we have no knowledge.<br> There let God Savitar, Aditi, and Mitra proclaim to Varuṇa that we are sinless.<br> 9 Hear us, O Agni, in your comninn dwell ing: harness thy rapid car, the car of Amṛta.<br> Bring Heaven and Earth, the Deities' Parents, hither: stay with us here, nor from the Gods be distant.</p>
