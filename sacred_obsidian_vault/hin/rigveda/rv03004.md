 <p>1. BE friendly with each kindled log of fuel, with every flash bestow the boon of riches.<br> Bring thou the Gods, O God, unto our worship: serve, well-inclined, as Friend thy friends, O Agni.<br> 2 Agni whom daily Varuṇa and Mitra the Gods bring thrice a day to this our worship,<br> Tanūnapāt, enrich with meath our service that dwells with holy oil, that offers honour.<br> 3 The thought that bringeth every boon proceedeth to worship first the Priest of the libation,<br> That we may greet the Strong One with our homage. Urged, may he bring the Gods, best Sacrificer.<br> 4 On high your way to sacrifice was made ready; the radiant flames went upward to the regions.<br> Full in the midst of heaven the Priest is seated: sirew we the sacred grass where Gods may rest them.<br> 5 Claiming in mind the seven priests' burntoblations, inciting all, they came in settled order.<br> To this our sacrifice approach the many who show in hero beauty at assemblies.<br> 6 Night and Dawn, lauded, hither come together, both smiling, different are their forms in colour,<br> That Varuṇa and Mitra may accept us, and Indra, girt by Maruts, with his glories.<br> 7. I crave the grace of heaven's two chief Invokers: the seven swift steeds joy in their wonted manner.<br> These speak of truth, praising the truth eternal, thinking on Order as the guards of Order.<br> 8 May Bhāratī with all her Sisters, Iḷā accordant with the Gods, with mortalls Agni,<br> Sarasvatī with all her kindred Rivers, come to this grass, Three Goddesses, and seat them.<br> 9 Well pleased with us do thou O God, O Tvaṣṭar, give ready issue to our procreant vigour,<br> Whence springs the hero, powerful, skilled in action, lover of Gods, adjuster of the press-stones.<br> 10 Send to the Gods the oblation, Lord of Forests; and let the Immolator, Agni, dress it.<br> He as the truer Priest shall offer worship, for the Gods generations well he knoweth.<br> 11 Come thou to us, O Agni, duly kindled, together with the potent Gods and Indra.<br> On this our grass sit Aditi, happy Mother, and let our Hail delight the Gods Immortal.</p>
