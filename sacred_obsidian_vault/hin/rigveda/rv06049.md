He, when his love impelled him, went to Arka.<br> May he vouchsafe us gear with gold to grace it: may Pūṣan make each prayer of ours efective.<br> 9 May Herald Agni, fulgent, bring for worship Tvaṣṭar adored, in homes and swift to listen,<br> Glorious, first to share, the life-bestower, the ever active God, fair-armed, fair-handed.<br> 10 Rudra by day, Rudra at night we honour with these our songs, the Universe's Father.<br> Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the Sage impels us.<br> 11 Ye who are youthful, wise, and meet for worship, come, Martits, to the longing of the singer.<br> Coming, as erst to Aṅgiras, O Heroes, ye animate and quicken een the desert.<br> 12 Even as the herdsman driveth home his cattle, I urge my songs to him the strong swift Hero<br> May he, the glorious, lay upon his body the singer's hymns, as stars bedeck the heaven.<br> 13 He who for man's behoof in his afiliction thrice measured out the earthly regions, Viṣṇu-<br> When one so great as thou affordeth shelter, may we with wealth and with ourselves be happy.<br> 14 Sweet be this song of mine to Ahibudhnya, Parvata, Savitar, with Floods and Lightnings;<br> Sweet, with the Plants, to Gods who seek oblations. May liberal Bhaga speed us on to riches.<br> 15 Give riches borne on cars, with many heroes, contenting men, the guard of mighty Order.<br> Give us a lasting home that we may battle with godless bands of men who fight against us, and meet with tribes to whom the Gods are gracious.</p>
