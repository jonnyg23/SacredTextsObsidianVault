 <p>1. CHASING with light our sin away, O Agni, shine thou wealth on us.<br> May his light chase our sin away.<br> 2 For goodly fields, for pleasant homes, for wealth we sacrifice to thee.<br> May his light chase our sin away.<br> 3 Best praiser of all these be he; foremost, our chiefs who sacrifice.<br> May his light chase our sin away.<br> 4 So that thy worshippers and we, thine, Agni, in our sons may live.<br> May his light chase our sin away.<br> 5 As ever-conquering Agni's beams of splendour go to every side,<br> May his light chase our sin away.<br> 6 To every side thy face is turned, thou art triumphant everywhere.<br> May his light chase our sin away.<br> 7 O thou whose face looks every way, bear us past foes as in a ship.<br> May his light chase our sin away.<br> 8 As in a ship, convey thou us for our advantage oer the flood.<br> May his light chase our sin away.</p>
