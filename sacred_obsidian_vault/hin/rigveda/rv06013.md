 <p>1. FROM thee, as branches from a tree, O Agni, from thee, Auspicious God! spring all our blessings-<br> Wealth swiftly, strength in battle with our foemen, the rain besought of heaven, the flow of waters.<br> 2 Thou art our Bhaga to send wealth thou dwellest, like circumambient air, with wondrous splendour.<br> Friend art thou of the lofty Law, like Mitra, Controller, Agni! God! of many a blessing.<br> 3 Agni! the hero slays with might his foeman; the singer bears away the Paṇi's booty-<br> Even he whom thou, Sage, born in Law, incitest by wealth, accordant with the Child of Waters.<br> 4 The man who, Son of Strength 1 with sacrifices, hymns, lauds, attracts thy fervour to the altar,<br> Enjoys each precious thing, O God, O Agni, gains wealth of corn and is the lord of treasures.<br> 5 Grant, Son of Strength, to men for their subsistence such things as bring high fame and hero children.<br> For thou with might givest much food in cattle even to the wicked wolf when he is hungry.<br> 6 Eloquent, Son of Strength, Most Mighty, Agni, vouchsafe us seed and offspring, full of vigour.<br> May I by all my songs obtain abundance. May brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters.</p>
