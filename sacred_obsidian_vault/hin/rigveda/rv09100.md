 <p>1. THE Guileless Ones are singing praise to Indra's well beloved Friend,<br> As, in the morning of its life, the mothers lick the new-born calf.<br> 2 O Indu, while they cleanse thee bring, O Soma, doubly-waxing wealth<br> Thou in the worshipper's abode causest all treasures to increase.<br> 3 Set free the. song which mind hath yoked, even as thunder frees the rain:<br> All treasures of the earth and heaven, O Soma, thou dost multiply.<br> 4 Thy stream when thou art pressed runs on like some victorious warrior's steed<br> Hastening onward through the fleece like a fierce horse who wins the prize.<br> 5 Flow on, Sage Soma, with thy stream to give us mental power and strength,<br> Effused for Indra, for his drink, for Mitra and for Varuṇa.<br> 6 Flow to the filter with thy stream, effused, best winner, thou, of spoil,<br> O Soma, as most rich in sweets for Indra, Viṣṇu, and the Gods.<br> 7 The mothers, void of guiles, caress thee Golden-coloured, in the sieve,<br> As cows, O Pavamana, lick the new-born calf, as Law commands.<br> 8 Thou, Pavamana, movest on with wondrous rays to great renown.<br> Striving within the votary's house thou drivest all the glooms away.<br> 9 Lord of great sway, thou liftest thee above the heavens, above the earth.<br> Thou, Pavamana hast assumed thy coat of mail in majesty.</p>
