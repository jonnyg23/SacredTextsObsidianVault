 <p>1. To Indra, to the Mighty Steer, may these gold-coloured juices go,<br> Drops rapidly produced, that find the light of heaven.<br> 2 Effused, this juice victorious flows for Indra, for his maintenance.<br> Soma bethinks him of the Conqueror, as he knows.<br> 3 May Indra in his raptures gain from him the grasp that gathers spoil,<br> And, winning waters, wield the steerstrong thunderbolt.<br> 4 Flow vigilant for Indra, thou Soma, yea, Indu, run thou on:<br> Bring hither splendid strength that finds the light of heaven.<br> 5 Do thou, all-beautiful, purify for Indra's sake the mighty juice,<br> Path-maker thou, far seeing, with a thousand ways.<br> 6 Best finder of prosperity for us, most rich in sweets for Gods,<br> Proceed thou loudly roaring on a thousand paths.<br> 7 O Indu, with thy streams, in might, flow for the banquet of the Gods:<br> Rich in meath, Soma, in our beaker take thy place.<br> 8 Thy drops that swim in water have exalted Indra to delight:<br> The Gods have drunk thee up for immortality.<br> 9 Stream opulence to us, ye drops of Soma, pressed and purified,<br> Pouring down rain from heaven in hoods, and finding light.<br> 10 Soma, while filtered, with his wave flows through the long wool of the sheep,<br> Shouting while purified before the voice of song.<br> 11 With songs they send the Mighty forth, sporting in wood, above the fleece:<br> Our psalms have glorified him of the triple height.<br> 12 Into the jars hath he been loosed, like an impetuous steed for war,<br> And lifting up his voice, while filtered, glided on.<br> 13 Gold-hued and lovely in his course, througb tangles of the wool he flows,<br> And pours heroic fame upon the worshippers.<br> 14 Flow thus, a faithful votary: the streams of meath have been effused.<br> Thou comest to the filter, singing, from each side.</p>
