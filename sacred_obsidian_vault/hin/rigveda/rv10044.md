 <p>1. MAY Sovran Indra come to the carousal, he who by Holy Law is strong and active,<br> The overcomer of all conquering forces with his great steer-like power that hath no limit.<br> 2 Firm-seated is thy car, thy Steeds are docile; thy hand, O King, holds, firmly grasped, the thunder.<br> On thy fair path, O Lord of men, come quickly: we will increase thy powers when thou hast drunken.<br> 3 Let strong and mighty Steeds who bear this Mighty Indra, the Lord of men, whose arm wields thunder,<br> Bring unto us, as sharers of our banquet, the Steer of conquering might, of real vigour.<br> 4 So like a Bull thou rushest to the Lord who loves the trough, the Sage, the prop of vigour, in the vat,<br> Prepare thine energies, collect them in thyself: be for our profit as the Master of the wise.<br> 5 May precious treasures come to us-so will I pray. Come to the votary's gift offered with beauteous laud.<br> Thou art the Lord, as such sit on this holy grass: thy vessels are inviolate as Law commands.<br> 6 Far went our earlist invocation of the Gods, and won us glories that can never be surpassed.<br> They who could not ascend the ship of sacrifice, sink down in desolation, trembling with alarm.<br> 7 So be the others, evil-hearted, far away, whose horses, difficult to harness, have been yoked.<br> Here in advance men stand anear to offer gifts, by whom full many a work that brings reward is done.<br> 8 He firmly fixed the plains and mountains as they shook. Dyaus thundered forth and made the air's mid-region quake.<br> He stays apart the two confronting bowls; he sings lauds in the potent Soma's joy when he hath drunk.<br> 9 I bear this deftly-fashioned goad of thine, wherewith thou, Maghavan, shalt break the strikers with the hoof.<br> At this libation mayst thou be well satisfied. Partake the juice, partake the worship, Maghavan.<br> 10 O Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with store of grain and cattle.<br> May we allied, as first in rank, with princes obtain possessions by our own exertion.<br> 11 Bṛhaspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and from below, from sinners.<br> May Indra from the front and from the centre, as Friend to friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.</p>
