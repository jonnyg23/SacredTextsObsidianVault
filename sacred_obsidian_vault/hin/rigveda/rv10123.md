 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN CXXIII. Vena.</h3>  
 <p>1. SEE, Vena, born in light, hath driven hither, on chariot of the air, the Calves of Pṛśni.<br> Singers with hymns caress him as an infant there where the waters and the sunlight mingle.<br> 2 Vena draws up his wave from out the ocean. mist-born, the fair one's back is made apparent,<br> Brightly he shone aloft on Order's summit: the hosts sang glory to their common birthplace.<br> 3 Full many, lowing to their joint-possession, dwelling together stood the Darling's Mothers.<br> Ascending to the lofty height of Order, the bands of singers 'sip the sweets of Amṛta.<br> 4 Knowing his form, the sages yearned to meet him: they have come nigh to hear the wild Bull's bellow.<br> Performing sacrifice they reached the river: for the Gandharva found the immortal waters.<br> 5 The Apsaras, the Lady, sweetly smiling, supports her Lover in sublimest heaven.<br> In his Friend's dwelling as a Friend he wanders: he, Vena, rests him on his golden pinion.<br> 6 They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on a strong-winged bird that mounteth sky-ward;<br> On thee with wings of gold, Varuṇa's envoy, the Bird that hasteneth to the home of Yama.<br> 7 Erect, to heaven hath the Gandharva mounted, pointing at us his many-coloured weapons;<br> Clad in sweet raiment beautiful to look on, for he, as light, produceth forms that please us.<br> 8 When as a spark he cometh near the ocean, still looking with a vulture's eye to heaven,<br> His lustre, joying in its own bright splendour, maketh dear glories in the lowest region.</p>
