 <p>1. LET Brahmans and Aṅgirases come forward, and let the roar of cloudy heaven surround us.<br> Loud low the Milch-kine swimming in the waters: set be the stones that grace our holy service.<br> 2 Fair, Agni, is thy long-known path to travel: yoke for the juice tfiy bay, thy ruddy horses,<br> Or red steeds, Hero-bearing, for the chamber. Seated, I call the Deities' generations.<br> 3 They glorify your sacrifice with worship, yet the glad Priest near them is left unequalled.<br> Bring the Gods hither, thou of many aspects: turn hitherward Aramati the Holy.<br> 4 What time the Guest hath made himself apparent, at ease reclining in the rich man's dwelling,<br> Agni, well-pleased, well-placed within the chamber gives to a house like this wealth worth the choosing.<br> 5 Accept this sacrifice of ours, O Agni; glorify it with Indra and the Maruts.<br> Here on our grass let Night and Dawn be seated: bring longing Varuṇa and Mitra hither.<br> 6 Thus hath Vasiṣṭha praised victorious Agni, yearning for wealth that giveth all subsistence.<br> May he bestow on us food, strength, and riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
