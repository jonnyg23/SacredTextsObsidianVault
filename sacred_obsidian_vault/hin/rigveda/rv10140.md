 <p>1. AGNI, life-power and fame are thine: thy fires blaze mightily, thou rich in wealth of beams!<br> Sage, passing bright, thou givest to the worshipper, with strength, the food that merits laud.<br> 2 With brilliant, purifying sheen, with perfect sheen thou liftest up thyself in light.<br> Thou, visiting both thy Mothers, aidest them as Son: thou joinest close the earth and heaven.<br> 3 O Jātavedas, Son of Strength, rejoice ihyself, gracious, in our fair hymns and songs.<br> In thee are treasured various forms of strengthening food, born nobly and of wondrous help.<br> 4 Agni, spread forth, as Ruler, over living things: give wealth to us, Immortal God.<br> Thou shinest out from beauty fair to look upon: thou leadest us to conquering power.<br> 5 To him, the wise, who orders sacrifice, who hath great riches un der his control,<br> Thou givest blest award of good, and plenteous food, givest him wealth that conquers all.<br> 6 The men have set before them them for their welfare Agni, strong, visible to all, the Holy.<br> Thee, Godlike One, with ears to hear, most famous, men's generations magnify with praise-songs.</p>
