 <p>1. GREAT power is in the beam of light, sing praise to, Agni, to the God<br> Whom men have set in foremost place like Mitra with their eulogies.<br> 2 He by the splendour of his arms is Priest of every able man.<br> Agni conveys oblation straight, and deals, as Bhaga deals, his boons.<br> 3 All rests upon the laud and love of him the rich, high-flaming God,<br> On whom, loud-roaring, men have laid great strength as on a faithful friend.<br> 4 So, Agni, be the Friend of these with liberal gift of hero strength.<br> Yea, Heaven and Earth have not surpassed this Youthful One in glorious fame.<br> 5 O Agni, quickly come to us, and, glorified, bring precious wealth.<br> So we and these our princes will assemble for the good of all. Be near in fight to prosper us.</p>
