 <p>1. To him, your own, the best among the good, I bring eulogy, like oblation in the kindled fire.<br> We invocate for help Indra untouched by eld, who maketh all decay, strengthened, for ever young.<br> 2 Without whom naught exists, Indra the Lofty One; in whom alone all powers heroic are combined.<br> The Soma is within him, in his frame vast strength, the thunder in his hand and wisdom in his head.<br> 3 Not by both worlds is thine own power to be surpassed, nor may thy car be stayed by mountains or by seas.<br> None cometh near, O Indra, to thy thunderbolt, when with swift steeds thou fliest over many a league.<br> 4 For all men bring their will to him the Resolute, to him the Holy One, to him the Strong they cleave.<br> Pay worship with oblation, strong and passing wise. Drink thou the Soma, Indra, through the mighty blaze.<br> 5 The vessel of the strong flows forth, the flood of meath, unto the Strong who feeds upon the strong, for drink,<br> Strong are the two Adhvaryus, strong are both the stones. They press the Soma that is strong for him the Strong.<br> 6 Strong is thy thunderbolt, yea, and thy car is strong; strong are thy Bay Steeds and thy weapons powerful.<br> Thou, Indra, Bull, art Lord of the strong gladdening drink. with the strong Soma, Indra, satisfy thyself.<br> 7 I, bold by prayer, come near thee in thy sacred rites, thee like a saving ship, thee shouting in the war.<br> Verily he will hear and mark this word of ours: we will pour Indra forth as twere a spring of wealth.<br> 8 Turn thee unto us ere calamity come nigh, as a cow full of pasture turns her to her calf.<br> Lord of a Hundred Powers, may we once firmly cling to thy fair favours even as husbands to their wives.<br> 9 Now let that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, yield in return a boon to him who lauds thee.<br> Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
