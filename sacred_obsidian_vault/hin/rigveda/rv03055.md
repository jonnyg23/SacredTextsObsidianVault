 <p>1. AT the first shining of the earliest Mornings, in the Cow's home was born the Great Eternal.<br> Now shall the statutes of the Gods be valid. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion -<br> 2 Let not the Gods here injure us, O Agni, nor Fathers of old time who know the region,<br> Nor the sign set between two ancient dwellings. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 3 My wishes fly abroad to many places: I glance back to the ancient sacrifices.<br> Let us declare the truth when fire is kindled. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 4 King Universal, born to sundry quarters, extended through the wood be lies on couches.<br> One Mother rests: another feeds the Infant. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 5 Lodged in old plants, he grows again in younger, swiftly within the newly-born and tender.<br> Though they are unimpregned, he makes them fruitful. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 6 Now lying far away, Child of two Mothers, he wanders unrestrained, the single youngling.<br> These are the laws of Varuṇa and Mitra. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 7 Child of two Mothers, Priest, sole Lord in synods, he still precedes while resting as foundation.<br> They who speak sweetly bring him sweet addresses. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 8 As to a friendly warrior when he battles, each thing that comes anear is seen to meet him.<br> The hymn commingles with the cow's oblation. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 9 Deep within these the hoary envoy pierceth; mighty, he goeth to the realm of splendour,<br> And looketh on us, clad in wondrous beauty. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 10 Viṣṇu, the guardian, keeps the loftiest station, upholding dear, immortal dwelling-places.<br> Agni knows well all these created beings. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 11 Ye, variant Pair, have made yourselves twin beauties: one of the Twain is dark, bright shines the other;<br> And yet these two, the dark, the red, are Sisters. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 12 Where the two Cows, the Mother and the Daughter, meet and give suck yielding their lordly nectar,<br> I praise them at the seat of law eternal. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 13 Loud hath she lowed, licking the other's youngling. On what world hath the Milch-cow laid her udder?<br> This Iḷā streameth with the milk of Order. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 14 Earth weareth beauties manifold: uplifted, licking her Calf of eighteen months, she standeth.<br> Well-skilled I seek the seat of law eternal. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 15 Within a wondrous place the Twain are treasured: the one is manifest, the other hidden.<br> One common pathway leads in two directions. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 16 Let the milch-kine that have no calves storm downward, yielding rich nectar, streaming, unexhausted,<br> These who are ever new and fresh and youthful. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 17 What time the Bull bellows in other regions, another herd receives the genial moisture;<br> For he is Bhaga, King, the earth's Protector. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 18 Let us declare the Hero's wealth in horses, O all ye folk: of this the Gods have knowledge.<br> Sixfold they bear him, or by fives are harnessed. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 19 Tvaṣṭar the God, the omniform. Creator, begets and feeds mankind in various manner.<br> His, verily, arc all these living creatures. Great is the Gods supreme dominion.<br> 20 The two great meeting Bowls hath he united: each of the Pair is laden with histreasure.<br> The Hero is renowned for gathering riches. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.<br> 21 Yea, and on this our earth the All-Sustainer dwells like a King with noble friends about him.<br> In his protection heroes rest in safety. Great is the Cods' supreme and sole dominion.<br> 22 Rich in their gifts for thee are herbs and waters, and earth brings all her wealth for thee, O Indra.<br> May we as friends of thine share goodly treasures. Great is the Gods supreme and sole dominion.</p>
