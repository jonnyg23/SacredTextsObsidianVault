 <p>1. To Vadhryasva when. be worshipped her with gifts she gave fierce Divodāsa, canceller of debts.<br> Consumer of the churlish niggard, one and all, thine, O Sarasvatī, are these effectual boons.<br> 2 She with her might, like one who digs for lotus-stems, hath burst with her strong waves the ridges of the hills.<br> Let us invite with songs and holy hymns for help Sarasvatī who slayeth the Paravatas.<br> 3 Thou castest down, Sarasvatī, those who scorned the Gods, the brood of every Bṛsaya skilled in magic arts.<br> Thou hast discovered rivers for the tribes of men, and, rich in wealth! made poison flow away from them.<br> 4 May the divine Sarasvatī, rich in her wealth, protect us well,<br> Furthering all our thoughts with might<br> 5 Whoso, divine Sarasvatī, invokes thee where the prize is set,<br> Like Indra when he smites the foe.<br> 6 Aid us, divine Sarasvad, thou who art strong in wealth and power<br> Like Pūṣan, give us opulence.<br> 7 Yea, this divine Sarasvatī, terrible with her golden path,<br> Foe-slayer, claims our eulogy.<br> 8 Whose limitless unbroken flood, swift-moving with a rapid rush,<br> Comes onward with tempestuous roar.<br> 9 She hath spread us beyond all foes, beyond her Sisters, Holy One,<br> As Sūrya spreadeth out the days.<br> 10 Yea, she most dear amid dear stream, Seven-sistered, graciously inclined,<br> Sarasvatī hath earned our praise.<br> 11 Guard us from hate Sarasvatī, she who hath filled the realms of earth,<br> And that wide tract, the firmament!<br> 12 Seven-sistered, sprung from threefold source, the Five Tribes' prosperer, she must be<br> Invoked in every deed of might.<br> 13 Marked out by majesty among the Mighty Ones, in glory swifter than the other rapid Streams,<br> Created vast for victory like a chariot, Sarasvatī must be extolled by every sage.<br> 14 Guide us, Sarasvatī, to glorious treasure: refuse us not thy milk, nor spurn us from thee.<br> Gladly accept our friendship and obedience: let us not go from thee to distant countries.<br> <br>  </p>
