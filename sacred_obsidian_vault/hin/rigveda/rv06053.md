 <p>1. LORD of the path, O Pūṣan, we have yoked and bound thee to our hymn,<br> Even as a car, to win the prize.<br> 2 Bring us the wealth that men require, a manly master of a house,<br> Free-handed with the liberal meed.<br> 3 Even him who would not give, do thou,<br> O glowing Pūṣan, urge to give,<br> And make the niggard's soul grow soft.<br> 4 Clear paths that we may win the prize; scatter our enemies afar.<br> Strong God, be all our thoughts fulfilled.<br> 5 Penetrate with an awl, O Sage, the hearts of avaricious churls,<br> And make them subject to our will.<br> 6 Thrust with thine awl, O Pūṣan: seek that which the niggard's heart holds dear,<br> And make him subject to our will.<br> 7 Tear up and read in pieces, Sage, the hearts of avaricious churls,<br> And make them subject to our will.<br> 8 Thou, glowing Pūṣan, carriest an awl that urges men to prayer;<br> Therewith do thou tear up and rend to shreds the heart of every one.<br> 9 Thou bearest, glowing Lord! a goad with horny point that guides the cows<br> Thence do we seek thy gift of bliss.<br> 10 And make this hymn of ours produce kine, horses, and a store of wealth<br> For our delight and use as men.</p>
