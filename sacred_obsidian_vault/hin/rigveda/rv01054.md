 <p>1 URGE us not, Maghavan, to this distressful fight, for none may comprehend the limit of thy strength.<br> Thou with fierce shout hast made the woods and rivers roar: did not men run in crowds together in their fear?<br> 2 Sing hymns of praise to Śakra, Lord of power and might; laud thou and magnify Indra who heareth thee,<br> Who with his daring might, a Bull exceeding strong in strength, maketh him master of the heaven and earth.<br> 3 Sing forth to lofty Dyaus a strength-bestowing song, the Bold, whose resolute mind hath independent sway.<br> High glory hath the Asura, compact of strength, drawn on by two Bay Steeds: a Bull, a Car is he.<br> 4 The ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake; thou, daring, of thyself smotest through Śambara,<br> When bold with gladdening juice, thou warredst with thy bolt, sharp and two-edged, against the banded sorcerers.<br> 5 When with a roar that fills the woods, thou forcest down on wind's head the stores which Śuṣṇa kept confined,<br> Who shall have power to stay thee firm and eager-souled from doing still this day what thou of old hast done?<br> 6 Thou helpest Narya, Turvaśa, and Yadu, and Vayya's son Turvīti, Śatakratu!<br> Thou helpest horse and car in final battle thou breakest down the nine-and-ninety castles.<br> 7 A hero-lord is he, King of a mighty folk, who offers free oblations and promotes the Law,<br> Who with a bounteous guerdon welcomes hymns of praise: for him flows down the abundant stream below the sky.<br> 8 His power is matchless, matchless is his wisdom; chief, through their work, be some who drink the Soma,<br> Those, Indra, who increase the lordly power, the firm heroic strength of thee the Giver.<br> 9 Therefore for thee are these abundant beakers Indra's drink, stone-pressed juices held in ladles.<br> Quaff them and satisfy therewith thy longing; then fix thy mind upon bestowing treasure.<br> 10 There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters flow: in Vṛtra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay concealed.<br> But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following after flood, down steep declivities.<br> 11 So give us, Indra, bliss-increasing glory give us great sway and strength that conquers people.<br> Preserve our wealthy patrons, save our princes; vouchsafe us wealth and food with noble offspring.</p>
