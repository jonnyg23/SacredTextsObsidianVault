 <p>1. Come hither, O ye Sons of Strength, ye Ṛbhus; stay not afar, ye Children of Sudhanvan.<br> At this libation is your gift of treasure. Let gladdening draughts approach you after Indra's.<br> 2 Hither is come the Ṛbhus' gift of riches; here was the drinking of the well-pressed Soma,<br> Since by dexterity and skill as craftsmen ye made the single chalice to be fourfold <br> 3 Ye made fourfold the chalice that wag single: ye spake these words and said, O Friend, assist us;<br> Then, Vājas! gained the path of life eternal, deft-handed Ṛbhus, to the Gods assembly.<br> 4 Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom?<br> Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Ṛbhus, of die meath of Soma.<br> 5 Ye with your cunning made your Parents youthful; the cup, for Gods to drink, ye formed with cunning;<br> With cunning, Ṛbhus, rich in treasure, fashioned the two swift Tawny Steeds who carry Indra.<br> 6 Whoso pours out for you, when days are closing, the sharp libation for your joy, O Vājas,<br> For him, O mighty Ṛbhus, ye, rejoicing, have fashioned wealth with plenteous store of heroes.<br> 7 Lord of Bay Steeds, at dawn the juice thou drankest: thine, only thine, is the noonday libation.<br> Now drink thou with the wealth-bestowing Ṛbhus, whom for their skill thou madest friends, O Indra.<br> 8 Ye, whom your artist skill hath raised to Godhead have set you down above in heaven like falcons.<br> So give us riches, Children of Sudhanvan, O Sons of Strength; ye have become immortal.<br> 9 The third libation, that bestoweth treasure, which ye have won by skill, ye dexterous-handed,<br> This drink hath been effused for you, O Ṛbhus . drink it with high delight, with joy like Indra's.</p>
