 <p>1. Wno are these radiant men in serried rank, Rudra's young heroes borne by noble steeds?<br> 2 Verily no one knoweth whence they sprang: they, and they only, know each other's birth.<br> 3 They strew each other with their blasts, these Hawks: they strove together, roaring like the wind.<br> 4 A sage was he who knew these mysteries, what in her udder mighty Pṛśni bore.<br> 5 Ever victorious, through the Maruts, be this band of Heroes, nursing manly strength,<br> 6 Most bright in splendour, flectest on their way, close-knit to glory, strong with varied power.<br> 7 Yea, mighty is your power and firm your strength: so, potent, with the Maruts, be the band.<br> 8 Bright is your spirit, wrathful are your minds: your bold troop's minstrel is like one inspired.<br> 9 Ever avert your blazing shaft from us, and let not your displeasure reach us here<br> 10 Your dear names, conquering Maruts, we invoke, calling aloud till we are satisfied.<br> 11 Well-armed, impetuous in their haste, they deck themselves, their forms, with oblations: to you, the pure, ornaments made of gold.<br> 12 Pure, Maruts, pure yourselves, are your oblations: to you, the pure, pure sacrifice I offer.<br> By Law they came to truth, the Law's observers, bright by their birth, and pure, and sanctifying.<br> 13 Your rings, O Maruts, rest upon your shoulders, and chains of gold are twined upon your bosoms.<br> Gleaming with drops of rain, like lightning-flashes, after your wont ye whirl about your weapons.<br> 14 Wide in the depth of air spread forth your glories, far, most adorable, ye bear your titles.<br> Maruts, accept this thousandfold allotment of household sacrifice and household treasure.<br> 15 If, Maruts, ye regard the praise recited here at this mighty singer invocation,<br> Vouchsafe us quickly wealth with noble heroes, wealth which no man uho hateth us may injure.<br> 16 The Maruts, fleet as coursers, while they deck them like youths spectators of a festal meeting,<br> Linger, like beauteous colts, about the dwelling, like frisking calves, these who pour down the water.<br> 17 So may the Maruts help us and be gracious, bringing free room to lovely Earth and Heaven.<br> Far be your bolt that slayeth men and cattle. Ye Vasus, turn yourselves to us with blessings.<br> 18 The priest, when seated, loudly calls you, Maruts, praising in song your universal bounty.<br> He, Bulls! who hath so much in his possession, free from duplicity, with hymns invokes you.<br> 19 These Maruts bring the swift man to a stand-still, and strength with mightier strength they break and humble<br> These guard the singer from the man who hates him and lay their sore displeasure on the wicked.<br> 20 These Maruts rouse even the poor and needy: the Vasus love him as an active champion.<br> Drive to a distance, O ye Bulls, the darkness: give us full store of children and descendants.<br> 21 Never, O Maruts, may we lose your bounty, nor, car-borne Lords! be hitidmost when ye deal it.<br> Give us a share in that delightful treasure, the genuine wealth that, Bulls! is your possession.<br> 22 What time the men in fury rush together for running streams, for pastures, and for houses.<br> Then, O ye Maruts, ye who spring from Rudra, be our protectors in the strife with foemen.<br> 23 Full many a deed ye did for our forefathers worthy of lauds which, even of old, they sang you.<br> lle strong man, with the Maruts, wins in battle, the charger, with the Maruts, gains the booty.<br> 24 Ours, O ye Maruts, be the vigorous Hero, the Lord Divine of men, the strong Sustainer,<br> With whom to fair lands we may cross the waters, and dwell in our own home with you beside us.<br> 25 May Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni, Waters, and Plants, and Trees accept our praises.<br> May we find shelter in the Marut's bosom. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
