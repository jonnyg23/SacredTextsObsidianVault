 <p>1. WITH this his golden splendour purifying him, he with his own allies subdues all enemies, as Sara with his own allies.<br> Cleansing himself with stream of juice he shines forth yellow-hued and red, when with the praisers he encompasses all forms, with praisers having seven mouths.<br> 2 That treasure of the Paṇis thou discoveredst; thou with thy mothers deckest thee in thine abode, with songs of worship in thine home.<br> As twere from far, the hymn is heard, where holy songs resound in joy. He with the ruddy-hued, threefold hath won life-power, he, glittering, hath won life-power.<br> 3 He moves intelligent, directed to the East. The very beauteous car rivals the beams of light, the beautiful celestial car.<br> Hymns, lauding manly valour, came, inciting Indra to success, that ye may be unconquered, both thy bolt and thou, both be unconquered in the war.</p>
