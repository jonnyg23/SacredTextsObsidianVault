 <p>1. In sweetest and most gladdening stream<br> flow pure, O Soma, on thy way,<br> Pressed out for Indra, for his drink.<br> 2 Fiend-queller, Friend of all men, he hath with the wood attained unto<br> His place, his iron-fashioned home.<br> 3 Be thou best Vṛtra-slayer, best granter of bliss, most liberal:<br> Promote our wealthy princes' gifts.<br> 4 Flow onward with thy juice unto the banquet of the Mighty Gods:<br> Flow hither for our strength and fame.<br> 5 O Indu, we draw nigh to thee, with this one object day by day:<br> To thee alone our prayers are said<br> 6 By means of this eternal fleece may Sūrya's Daughter purify<br> Thy Soma that is foaming forth.<br> 7 Ten sister maids of slender form seize him within the press and hold<br> Him firmly on the final day.<br> 8 The virgins send him forth: they blow the the skin musician-like and fuse<br> The triple foe-repelling meath.<br> 9 Inviolable milch-kine round about him blend for Indra's drink,<br> The fresh young Soma with their milk.<br> 10 In the wild raptures of this draught, Indra slays all the Vṛtras: he,<br> The Hero, pours his wealth on us.</p>
