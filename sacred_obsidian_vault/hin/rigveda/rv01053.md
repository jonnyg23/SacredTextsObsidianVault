 <p>1 WE will present fair praise unto the Mighty One, our hymns to Indra in Vivasvān's dwelling-place;<br> For he hath neer found wealth in those who seem to sleep: those who give wealth to men accept no paltry praise.<br> 2 Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley, thou art Lord and guard of wealth:<br> Man's helper from of old, not disappointing hope, Friend of our friends, to thee as such we sing this praise.<br> 3 Indra, most splendid, powerful, rich in mighty deeds, this treasure spread around is known to be thine own.<br> Gather therefrom, O Conqueror, and bring to us: fail not the hope of him who loves and sings to thee.<br> 4 Well pleased with these bright flames and with these Soma drops, take thou away our poverty with seeds and kine.<br> With Indra scattering the Dasyu through these drops, freed from their hate may we obtain abundant food.<br> 5 Let us obtain, O Indra, plenteous wealth and food, with strength exceeding glorious, shining to the sky:<br> May we obtain the Goddess Providence, the strength of heroes, special source of cattle, rich in steeds.<br> 6 These our libations strength-inspiring, Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with Vṛtra, Hero Lord,<br> What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand Vṛtras, thou resistless in thy might.<br> 7 Thou goest on from fight to fight intrepidly, destroying castle after castle here with strength.<br> Thou, Indra, with thy friend who makes the foe bow down, slewest from far away the guileful Namuci.<br> 8 Thou hast struck down in death Karañja, Parṇaya, in Atithigva's very glorious going forth.<br> Unyielding, when Ṛjiśvan compassed them with siege, thou hast destroyed the hundred forts of Vaṅgṛida.<br> 9 With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of men,<br> With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Suśravas.<br> 10 Thou hast protected Suśravas with succour, and Tūrvayāṇa with thine aid, O Indra.<br> Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Āyu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty.<br> 11 May we protected by the Gods hereafter remain thy very prosperous friends, O Indra.<br> Thee we extol, enjoying through thy favour life long and joyful and with store of heroes.</p>
