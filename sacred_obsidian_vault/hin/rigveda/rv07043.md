 <p>1. SING out the pious at your sacrifices to move with adorations Earth and Heaven-<br> The Holy Singers, whose unmatched devotions, like a tree's branches, part in all directions.<br> 2 Let sacrifice proceed like some fleet courser: with one accord lift ye on high the ladles.<br> Strew sacred grass meet for the solenm service: bright flames that love the Gods have mounted upward.<br> 3 Like babes in arms reposing on their mother, let the Gods sit upon the grass's summit.<br> Let general fire make bright the flame of worship: scorn us not, Agni, in the Gods assembly.<br> 4 Gladly the Gods have let themselves be honoured, milking the copious streams of holy Order.<br> The highest might to-day is yours, the Vasits': come ye, as many as ye are, one-minded.<br> 5 So, Agni, send us wealth among the people: may we be closely knit to thee, O Victor,<br> Unharmed, and rich, and taking joy together. Preserve us evermore, ye ods, with blessings.</p>
