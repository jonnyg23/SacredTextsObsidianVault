 <p>1. I WILL sing near, for grace, your God Agni, for he is good to us.<br> Son of the Brands, may he give gifts, and, righteous, save us from the foe.<br> 2 For he is true, whom men of old enkindled, and the Gods themselves,<br> The Priest with the delicious tongue, rich with the light of glorious beams.<br> 3 With wisdom that surpasseth all, with gracious will most excellent,<br> O Agni, worthy of our choice, shine wealth on us through hymns of praise.<br> 4 Agni is King, for he extends to mortals and to Gods alike.<br> Agni is bearer of our gifts. Worship ye Agni with your thoughts.<br> 5 Agni gives to the worshipper a son, the best, of mightiest fame,<br> Of deep devotion, neer subdued, bringer of glory to his sire.<br> 6 Agni bestows the hero-lord who conquers with the men in fight.<br> Agni bestows the fleet-foot steed, the victor never overcome.<br> 7 The mightiest song is Agni's: shine on high, thou who art rich in light.<br> Like the Chief Consort of a King, riches and strength proceed from thee.<br> 8 Resplendent are thy rays of light: loud is thy voice like pressing-stones.<br> Yea, of itself thy thunder goes forth like the roaring of the heaven.<br> 9 Thus, seeking riches, have we paid homage to Agni Conqueror.<br> May he, most wise, as with a ship, carry us over all our foes.</p>
