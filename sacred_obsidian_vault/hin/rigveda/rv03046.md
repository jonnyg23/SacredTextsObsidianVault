 <p>1. OF thee, the Bull, the Warrior, Sovran Ruler, joyous and fierce, ancient and ever youthful,<br> The undecaying One who wields the thunder, renowned and great, great are the exploits, Indra.<br> 2 Great art thou, Mighty Lord, through manly vigour, O fierce One, gathering spoil, subduing others,<br> Thyself alone the universe's Sovran: so send forth men to combat and to rest them.<br> 3 He hath surpassed all measure in his brightness, yea, and the Gods, for none may be his equal.<br> Impetuous Indra in his might cxccedcth wide vast mid-air and heaven and earth together.<br> 4 To Indra, even as rivers to the ocean, flow forth from days of old the Soma juices;<br> To him wide deep and mighty from his birth-time, the well of holy thoughts, aIl-comprehending.<br> 5 The Soma, Indra, which the earth and heaven bear for thee as a mother bears her infant,<br> This they send forth to thee, this, vigorous Hero! Adhvaryus purify for thee to drink of.</p>
