 <p>1. FLOW on to Indra, Soma, carefully effused: let sickness stay afar together with the fiends.<br> Let not the double-tongued delight them with thy juice. here be thy flowing drops laden with opulence.<br> 2 O Pavamana, urge us forward in the fight thou art the vigour of the Gods, the well-loved drink.<br> Smite thou our enemies who raise the shout of joy: Indra, drink Soma juice, and drive away our foes.<br> 3 Unharmed, best Cheerer, thou, O Indu, flowest on: thou, even thou thyself, art Indra's noblest food.<br> Full many a wise man lifts to thee the song of praise, and hails thee with a kiss as Sovran of this world.<br> 4 Wondrous, with hundred streams, hymned in a thousand songs, Indu pours out for Indra his delightrul meath.<br> Winning us land and waters, flow thou hitherward: Rainer of bounties, Soma, make broad way for us.<br> 5 Roaring within the beaker thou art balmed with milk: thou passest through the fleecy filter all at once.<br> Carefully cleansed and decked like a prizewinning steed, O Soma, thou hast flowed down within Indra's throat.<br> 6 Flow onward sweet of flavour for the Heavenly Race, for Indra sweet, whose name is easily invoked:<br> Flow sweet for Mitra, Varuṇa, and Vāyu, rich in meath, inviolable for Bṛhaspati.<br> 7 Ten rapid fingers deck the Courser in the jar: with hymns the holy singers send their voices forth.<br> The filtering juices hasten to their eulogy, the drops that gladden find their way to Indra's heart.<br> 8 While thou art purified pour on us hero strength, great, far-extended shelter, spacious pasturage.<br> Let no oppression master this our holy work: may we, O Indu, gain all opulence through thee.<br> 9 The Steer who sees afar hath risen above the sky: the Sage hath caused the lights of heaven to give their shine.<br> The. King is passing through the filter with a roar: they drain the milk of heaven from him who looks on men.<br> 10 High in the vault of heaven, unceasing, honey-tongued, the Loving Ones drain out the mountain-haunting Steer,<br> The drop that hath grown great in waters, in the lake meath-rich, in the stream's wave and in the cleansing sieve.<br> 11 The Loving Ones besought with many voices the Eagle who had flown away to heaven.<br> Hymns kiss the Youngling worthy of laudation, resting on earth, the Bird of golden colour.<br> 12 High to heaven's vault hath the Gandharva risen, beholding all his varied forms and figures.<br> His ray hath shone abroad with gleaming splendour: pure, he hath lighted both the worlds, the Parents.</p>
