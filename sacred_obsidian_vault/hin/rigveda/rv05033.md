 <p>1. GREAT praise to Indra, great and strong mid heroes, I ponder thus, the feeble to the Mighty,<br> Who with his band shows favour to this people, when lauded, in the fight where spoil is gathered.<br> 2 So made attentive by our hymns, Steer! Indra! thou fastenedst the girth of thy Bay Coursers,<br> Which, Maghavan, at thy will thou drivest hither. With these subdue for us the men who hate us.<br> 3 They were not turned to us-wtrd, lofty Indra! while yet through lack of prayer they stood unharnessed.<br> Ascend this chariot, thou whose hand wields thunder, and draw the rein, O Lord of noble horses.<br> 4 Thou, because many lauds are thine, O Indra, wast active warring in the fields<br> for cattle.<br> For Sūrya in his own abode thou, Hero, formedst in fights even a Dāsa's nature.<br> 5 Thine are we, Indra; thine are all these people, conscious of might, whose cars are set in motion.<br> Some hero come to us, O Strong as Ahi beauteous in war, to be invoked like Bhaga.<br> 6 Strength much to be desired is in thee, Indra: the Immortal dances forth his hero exploits.<br> Such, Lord of Treasure, give us splendid riches. I praise the Friend's gift, his whose wealth is mighty.<br> 7 Thus favour us, O Indra, with ihy succour; Hero, protect the bards who sing thy praises.<br> Be friendly in the fray to those who offer the skin of beautiful and well-pressed Soma.<br> 8 And these ten steeds which Trasadasyu gives me, the goldrich chief, the son of Purukutsa,<br> Resplendent in their brightness shall convey me. Gairiksita willed it and so came I hither.<br> 9 And these, bestowed as sacrificial guerdon, the powerful tawny steeds of Marutasva;<br> And thousands which kind Cyavatana gave me, abundantly bestowed for my adornment.<br> 10 And these commended horses, bright and active, by Dhvanya son of Laksmana presented,<br> Came unto me, as cows into the Ṛṣi Samvarana's stall, with magnitude of riches.</p>
