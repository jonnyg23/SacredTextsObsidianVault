 <p>1. SOON as the young Bull sprang into existence he longed to taste the pressed-out Soma's liquor.<br> Drink thou thy fill, according to thy longing, first, of the goodly mixture blent with Soma.<br> 2 That day when thou wast born thou, fain to taste it, drankest the plant's milk which the mountains nourish.<br> That milk thy Mother first, the Dame who bare thee, poured for thee in thy mighty Father's dwelling.<br> 3 Desiring food he came unto his Mother, and on her breast beheld the pungent Soma.<br> Wise, he moved on, keeping aloof the others, and wrought great exploits in his varied aspects.<br> 4 Fierce, quickly conquering, of surpassing vigour, he framed his body even as he listed.<br> Een from his birth-time Indra conquered Tvaṣṭar, bore off the Soma and in beakers drank it.<br> 5 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered;<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
