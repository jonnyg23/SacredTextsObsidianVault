 <p>1. THEY for the Bold and Lovely One ply manly vigour like a bow:<br> joyous, in front of songs they weave bright raiment for the Lord Divine.<br> 2 And he, made beautiful by night, dips forward into strengthening food',<br> What time the sacrificer's thoughts speed on his way the Golden-hued.<br> 3 We cleanse this gladdening drink of his the juice which Indra chiefly drinks-<br> That which kine took into their mouths, of old, and princes take it now.<br> 4 To him, while purifying, they have raised the ancient psalm of praise:<br> And sacred songs which bear the names of Gods have supplicated him.<br> 5 They purify him as he drops, courageous, in the fleecy sieve.<br> Him they instruct as messenger to bear the sage's morning prayer.<br> 6 Soma, best Cheerer, takes his seat, the while they cleanse him in the bowls.<br> He as it were impregns the cow, and babbles on, the Lord of Song.<br> 7 He is effused and beautified, a God for Gods, by skilful men.<br> He penetrates the mighty floods collecting all he knows therein.<br> 8 Pressed, Indu, guided by the men, thou art led to the cleaning sieve.<br> Thou, yielding Indra highest joy, takest thy seat within the bowls.</p>
