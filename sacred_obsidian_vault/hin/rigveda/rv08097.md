 <p>1. As highest of the Maghavans, preeminent among the Bulls,<br> Best breaker-down of forts, kine-winner, Lord of wealth, we seek thee, Indra Maghavan.<br> 2 Thou who subduedst Āyu, Kutsa, Atithigva, waxing daily in thy might,<br> As such, rousing thy power, we invocate thee now, thee Śatakratu, Lord of Bays.<br> 3 The pressing-stones shall pour for us the essence of the meath of all,<br> Drops that have been pressed out afar among the folk, and those that have been pressed near us.<br> 4 Repel all enmities and keep thern far away: let all win treasure for their own.<br> Even among Sistas are the stalks that make thee glad, where thou with Soma satest thee.<br> 5 Come, Indra, very near to us with aids of firmly-based resolve;<br> Come, most auspicious, with thy most auspicious help, good Kinsman, with good kinsmen, come!<br> 6 Bless thou with progeny the chief of men, the lord of heroes, victor in the fray.<br> Aid with thy powers the men who sing thee lauds and keep their spirits ever pure and bright.<br> 7 May we be such in battle as are surest to obtain thy grace:<br> With holy offerings and invocations of the Gods, we mean, that we may win the spoil.<br> 8 Thine, Lord of Bays, am I. Prayer longeth for the spoil. Still with thy help I seek the fight.<br> So, at the raiders' head, I, craving steeds and kine, unite myself with thee alone.</p>
