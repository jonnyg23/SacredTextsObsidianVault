 <p>1. THIS hymn will I make for the Marut host who bright in native splendour cast the mountains down.<br> Sing the great strength of those illustrious in renown, who stay the heat, who sacrifice on heights of heaven.<br> 2 O Maruts, rich in water, strengtheners of life are your strong bands with harnessed steeds, that wander far.<br> Trita roars out at him who aims the lightning-flash. The waters sweeping round are thundering on their way.<br> 3 They gleam with lightning, Heroes, Casters of the Stone, wind-rapid Maruts, overthrowers of the bills,<br> Oft through desire to rain coming with storm of hail, roaring in onset, violent and exceeding strong.<br> 4 When, mighty Rudras, through the nights and through the days, when through the sky and realms of air, shakers of all,<br> When over the broad fields ye drive along like ships, een to strongholds ye come, Maruts, but are not harmed.<br> 5 Maruts, this hero strength and majesty of yours hath, like the Sun, extended oer a lengthened way,<br> When in your course like deer with splendour unsubdued ye bowed the hill that gives imperishable rain.<br> 6 Bright shone your host, ye Sages, Maruts, when ye smote the waving tree as when the worm consumeth it.<br> Accordant, as the eye guides him who walks, have ye led our devotion onward by an easy path.<br> 7 Never is he, O Maruts, slain or overcome, never doth he decay neer is distressed or harmed;<br> His treasures, his resources, never waste away, whom. whether he be prince or Ṛṣi, ye direct.<br> 8 With harnessed team like heroes overcoming troops, the friendly Maruts, laden with their water-casks,<br> Let the spring flow, and when impetuous' they roar they inundate the earth with floods of pleasant meath.<br> 9 Free for the Maruts is the earth with sloping ways, free for the rushing Ones is heaven with steep descents.<br> The paths of air's mid-region are precipitous, precipitous the mountains with their running streams.<br> 10 When, as the Sun hath risen up, ye take delight, O bounteous radiant Maruts, Heroes of the sky,<br> Your coursers weary not when speeding onṭheir way, and rapidly ye reach the end of this your path.<br> 11 Lances are on your shoulders, anklets on your feet, gold chains are on your breasts, gems, Maruts, on your car.<br> Lightnings aglow with flame are flashing in your hands, and visors wroughtof gold are laid upon your heads.<br> 12 Maruts, in eager stir ye shake the vault of heaven, splendid beyond conception, for its shining fruit.<br> They gathered when they let their deeds of might flash forth. The Pious Ones send forth a far-resounding shout.<br> 13 Sage Maruts, may we be the drivers of the car of riches ful I of life that have been given by you.<br> O Maruts, let that wealth in thousands dwell with us which never vanishes like Tisya from the sky.<br> 14 Maruts, ye further wealth with longedfor heroes, further the Ṛṣi skilled in chanted verses.<br> Ye give the Bhārata as his strength, a charger, and ye bestow a king who quickly listens.<br> 15 Of you, most swift to succour! I solicit wealth wherewith we may spread forth mid men like as the Sun.<br> Accept, O Maruts, graciously this hymn of mine that we may live a hundred winters through its power.</p>
