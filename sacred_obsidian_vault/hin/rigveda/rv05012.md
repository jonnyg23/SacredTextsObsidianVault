 <p>1. To Agni, lofty Asura, meet for worship, Steer of eternal Law, my prayer I offer;<br> I bring my song directed to the Mighty like pure oil for his mouth at sacrifices.<br> 2 Mark the Law, thou who knowest, yea, observe it: send forth the full streams of eternal Order.<br> I use no sorcery with might or falsehood the sacred Law of the Red Steer I follow.<br> 3 How hast thou, follower of the Law eternal, become the knower of a new song, Agni?<br> The God, the Guardian of the seasons, knows me: the Lord of him who won this wealth I know not.<br> 4 Who, Agni, in alliance with thy foeman, what splendid helpers won for them their riches?<br> Agni, who guard the dwelling-place of falsehood? Who are protectors of the speech of liars?<br> 5 Agni, those friends of thine have turned them from thee: gracious of old, they have become ungracious.<br> They have deceived themselves by their own speeches, uttering wicked words against the righteous.<br> 6 He who pays sacrifice to thee with homage, O Agni, keeps the Red Steer's Law eternal;<br> Wide is his dwelling. May the noble offspring of Nahuṣa who wandered forth come hither.</p>
