 <p>1. COME hither, Indra, with Bay Steeds, joyous, with tails like peacocks' plumes.<br> Let no men cheek thy course as fowlers stay the bird: pass oer them as oer desert lands.<br> 2 He who slew Vṛtra, burst the cloud, brake the strongholds and drave the floods,<br> Indra who mounts his chariot at his Bay Steeds' cry, shatters een things that stand most firm.<br> 3 Like pools of water deep and full, like kine thou cherishest thy might;<br> Like the milch-cows that go well-guarded to the mead, like water-brooks that reach the lake.<br> 4 Bring thou us wealth with power to strike, our share, 'gainst him who calls it his.<br> Shake, Indra, as with hooks, the tree for ripened fruit, for wealth to satisfy our wish.<br> 5 Indra, self-ruling Lord art thou, good Leader, of most glorious fame.<br> So, waxen in thy strength, O thou whom many praise, be thou most swift to hear our call.</p>
