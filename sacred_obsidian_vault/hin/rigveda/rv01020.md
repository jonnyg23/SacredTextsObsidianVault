 <p>1 FOR the Celestial Race this song of praise which gives wealth lavishly<br> Was made by singers with their lips.<br> 2 They who for Indra, with their mind, formed horses harnessed by a word,<br> Attained by works to sacrifice.<br> 3 They for the two Nāsatyas wrought a light car moving every way:<br> They formed a nectar-yielding cow.<br> 4 The Ṛbhus with effectual prayers, honest, with constant labour, made<br> Their Sire and Mother young again.<br> 5 Together came your gladdening drops with Indra by the Maruts girt,<br> With the Ādityas, with the Kings.<br> 6 The sacrificial ladle, wrought newly by the God Tvaṣṭar's hand<br> Four ladles have ye made thereof.<br> 7 Vouchsafe us wealth, to him who pours thrice seven libations, yea, to each<br> Give wealth, pleased with our eulogies.<br> 8 As ministering Priests they held, by pious acts they won themselves,<br> A share in sacrifice with Gods.</p>
