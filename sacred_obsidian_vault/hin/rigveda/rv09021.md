 <p>1. To Indra flow these running drops, these Somas frolicsome in mood.<br> Exhilarating, finding light;<br> 2 Driving off foes, bestowing room upon the presser, willingly<br> Bringing their praiser vitalforce.<br> 3 Lightly disporting them, the drops flow to one common reservoir,<br> And fall into the river's wave.<br> 4 These Pavamanas have obtained all blessings much to be desired,<br> Like coursers harnessed to a car.<br> 5 With view to us, O Soma-drops, bestow his manifold desire<br> On him who yet hath given us naught.<br> 6 Bring us our wish with this design, as a wright brings his new-wrought wheel:<br> Flow pure and shining with the stream.<br> 7 These drops have cried with resonant voice: like swift steeds they have run the course,<br> And roused the good man's hymn to life.</p>
