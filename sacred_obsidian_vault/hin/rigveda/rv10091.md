 <p>1. BRISK, at the place of Iḷā, hymned by men who wake, our own familiar Friend is kindled in the house;<br> Hotar of all oblation, worthy of our choice, Lord, beaming, trusty friend to one who loveth him.<br> 2 He, excellent in glory, guest in every house, finds like a swift-winged bird a home in every tree.<br> Benevolent to men, he scorns no living man: Friend to the tribes of men he dwells with every tribe.<br> 3 Most sage with insight, passing skilful with thy powers art thou, O Agni, wise with wisdom, knowing all.<br> As Vasu, thou alone art Lord of all good things, of all the treasures that the heavens and earth produce.<br> 4 Foreknowing well, O Agni, thou in Iḷā's place hast occupied thy regular station balmed with oil.<br> Marked are thy comings like the comings of the Dawns, the rays of him who shineth spotless as the Sun.<br> 5 Thy glories are, as lightnings from the rainy cloud, marked, many-hued, like heralds of the Dawns approach,<br> When, loosed to wander over plants and forest trees, thou crammest by thyself thy food into thy mouth.<br> 6 Him, duly coming as their germ, have plants received: this Agni have maternal Waters brought to life.<br> So in like manner do the forest trees and plants bear him within them and produce him evermore.<br> 7 When, sped and urged by wind, thou spreadest thee abroad, swift piercing through thy food according to thy will,<br> Thy never-ceasing blazes, longing to consume, like men on chariots, Agni, strive on every side.<br> 8 Agni, the Hotar-priest who fills the assembly full, Waker of knowledge, chief Controller of the thought,<br> Him, yea, none other than thyself, doth man elect at sacrificial offerings great and small alike.<br> 9 Here, Agni, the arrangers, those attached to thee, elect thee as their Priest in sacred gatherings,<br> When men with strewn clipt grass and sacrificial gifts offer thee entertainment, piously inclined.<br> 10 Thine is the Herald's task and Cleanser's duly timed; Leader art thou, and Kindler for the pious man.<br> Thou art Director, thou the ministering Priest: thou art the Brahman, Lord and Master in our home.<br> 11 When mortal man presents to thee Immortal God, Agni, his fuel or his sacrificial gift,<br> Then thou art his Adhvaryu, Hotar, messenger, callest the Gods and orderest the sacrifice.<br> 12 From us these hymns in concert have gone forth to him, these. holy words, these Ṛcas, songs and eulogies,<br> Eager for wealth, to Jātavedas fain for wealth: when they have waxen strong they please their Strengthener.<br> 13 This newest eulogy will I speak forth to him, the Ancient One who loves it. May he hear our voice.<br> May it come near his heart and make it stir with love, as a fond well-dressed matron clings about her lord.<br> 14 He in whom horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are offered up,<br> To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth.<br> 15 Into thy mouth is poured the offering, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle.<br> Vouchsafe us wealth. strength-winning, blest with heroes, wealth lofty, praised by men, and full of splendour.</p>
