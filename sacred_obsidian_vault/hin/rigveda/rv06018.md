 <p>1. GLORIFY him whose might is all-surpassing, Indra the much-invoked who fights uninjured.<br> Magnify with these songs the never-vanquished, the Strong, the Bull of men, the Mighty Victor.<br> 2 He, Champion, Hero, Warrior, Lord of battles, impetuous, loudly roaring, great destroyer,<br> Who whirls the dust on high, alone, oerthrower, hath made all races of mankind his subjects.<br> 3 Thou, thou alone, hast tamed the Dasyus; singly thou hast subdued the people for the Ārya.<br> In this, or is it not, thine hero exploit, Indra? Declare it at the proper season.<br> 4 For true, I deem, thy strength is, thine the Mighty, thine, O Most Potent, thine the Conquering Victor;<br> Strong, of the strong, Most Mighty, of the mighty, thine, driver of the churl to acts of bounty.<br> 5 Be this our ancient bond of friendship with you and with Aṅgirases here who speak of Vala.<br> Thou, Wondrous, Shaker of things firm, didst smite him in his fresh strength, and force his doors and castles.<br> 6 With holy thoughts must he be called, the Mighty, showing his power in the great fight with Vṛtra.<br> He must be called to give us seed and offspring, the Thunderer must he moved and sped to battle.<br> 7 He in his might, with name that lives for ever, hath far surpassed all human generations.<br> He, most heroic, hath his home with splendour, with glory and with riches and with valour.<br> 8 Stranger to guile, who neer was false or faithless, bearing a name that may be well remembered,<br> Indra crushed Cumuri, Dhuni, Śambara, Pipru, and Śuṣṇa, that their castles fell in ruin.<br> 9 With saving might that must be praised and lauded, Indra, ascend thy car to smite down Vṛtra.<br> In thy right hand hold fast thy bolt of thunder, and weaken, Bounteous Lord, his art and magic.<br> 10 As Agni, as the dart burns the dry forest, like the dread shaft burn down the fiends, O Indra;<br> Thou who with high deep-reaching spear hast broken, hast covered over mischief and destroyed it.<br> 11 With wealth, by thousand paths come hither, Agni, paths that bring ample strength, O thou Most Splendid.<br> Come, Son of Strength, oer whom, Invoked of many! the godless hath no power to keep thee distant.<br> 12 From heaven, from earth is bruited forth the greatness of him the firm, the fiery, the resplendent.<br> No foe hath he, no counterpart, no refuge is there from him the Conqueror full of wisdom<br> 13 This day the deed that thou hast done is famous, when thou, for him, with many thousand others<br> Laidest low Kutsa, Āyu, Atithigva, and boldly didst deliver Tūrvayāṇa.<br> 14 In thee, O God, the wisest of the Sages, all Gods were joyful when thou slewest Ahi.<br> When lauded for thyself, thou gavest freedom to sore-afflicted Heaven and to the people.<br> 15 This power of thine both heaven and earth acknowledge, the deathless Gods acknowledge it, O Indra.<br> Do what thou neer hast done, O Mighty Worker: beget a new hymn at thy sacrifices.</p>
