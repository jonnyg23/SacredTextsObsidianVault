 <p>1. GREAT is this might of yours, Indra and Soma: the first high exploits were your own achievements.<br> Ye found the Sun ye found the light of heaven: ye killed all darkness and the Gods blasphemers.<br> 2 Ye, Indra-Soma, gave her light to Morning, and led the Sun on high with all his splendour.<br> Ye stayed the heaven with a supporting pillar, and spread abroad apart, the Earth, the Mother.<br> 3 Ye slew the flood -obstructing serpent Vṛtra, Indra and Soma: Heaven approved your exploit.<br> Ye urged to speed the currents of the rivers, and many seas have ye filled full with waters.<br> 4 Ye in the unripe udders of the milch-kine have set the ripe milk, Indra, thou, and Soma.<br> Ye have held fast the unimpeded whiteness within these many-coloured moving creatures.<br> 5 Verily ye bestow, Indra and Soma, wealth, famed, victorious, passing to our children.<br> Ye have invested men, ye Mighty Beings, with manly strength that conquers in the battle.</p>
