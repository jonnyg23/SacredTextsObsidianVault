THIS Agni is the Lord of great felicity and hero Strength;<br> Lord of wealth in herds of kine; Lord of the battles with the foe.<br> 2 Wait, Maruts, Heroes, upon him the Prosperer in whom is bliss-increasing wealth;<br> Who in fights ever conquer evil-hearted men, who overcome the enemy.<br> 3 As such, O Agni, deal us wealth and hero might, O Bounteous One!<br> Most lofty, very glorious, rich in progeny, free from disease and full of power.<br> 4 He who made all that lives, who passes all in might, who orders service to the Gods,<br> He works among the Gods, he works in hero strength, yea, also in the praise of men.<br> 5 Give us not up to indigence, Agni, nor want of hero sons,<br> Nor, Son of Strength, to lack of cattle, nor to blame. Drive. thou our enemies away.<br> 6 Help us to strength, blest Agni! rich in progeny, abundant, in our sacrifice.<br> Flood us with riches yet more plenteous, bringing weal, with high renown, most Glorious One!</p>
