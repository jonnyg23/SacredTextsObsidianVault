 <p>1 WHEN thus, like flame, from far away, Maruts, ye cast your measure forth,<br> To whom go Ye, to whom, O shakers of the earth, moved by whose wisdom, whose design?<br> 2 Strong let your weapons be to drive away your foes, firm for resistance let them be.<br> Yea, passing glorious must be your warrior might, not as a guileful mortal's strength.<br> 3 When what is strong ye overthrow, and whirl about each ponderous thing,<br> Heroes, your course is through the forest trees of earth, and through the fissures of the rocks.<br> 4 Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the earth:<br> Ye Rudras, may the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid defiance even now.<br> 5 They make the mountains rock and reel, they rend the forest-kings apart.<br> Onward, ye Maruts, drive, like creatures drunk with wine, ye, Gods with all your company.<br> 6 Ye to your chariot have yoked the spotted deer: a red deer, as a leader, draws.<br> Even the Earth herself listened as ye came near, and men were sorely terrified.<br> 7 O Rudras, quickly we desire your succour for this work of ours.<br> Come to us with your aid as in the days of old, so now for frightened Kaṇva's sake.<br> 8 Should any monstrous foe, O Maruts, sent by you or sent by mortals threaten us,<br> Tear ye him from us with your power and with your might, and with the succours that are yours.<br> 9 For ye, the worshipful and wise, have guarded Kaṇva perfectly.<br> O Maruts, come to us with full protecting help, as lightning flashes seek the rain.<br> 10 Whole strength have ye, O Bounteous Ones; perfect, earth-shakers, is your might.<br> Maruts, against the poet's wrathful enemy send ye an enemy like a dart.</p>
