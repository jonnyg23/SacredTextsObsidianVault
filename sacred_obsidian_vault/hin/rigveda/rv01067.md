 <p>1. VICTORIOUS in the wood, Friend among men, ever he claims obedience as a King.<br> Gracious like peace, blessing like mental power, Priest was he, offering-bearer, full of thought.<br> 2 He, bearing in his hand all manly might, crouched in the cavern, struck the Gods with fear.<br> Men filled with understanding find him there, when they have sting prayers formed within their heart.<br> 3 He, like the Unborn, holds the broad earth up; and with effective utterance fixed the sky.<br> O Agni, guard the spots which cattle love: thou, life of all, hast gone from lair to lair.<br> 4 Whoso hath known him dwelling in his lair, and hath approached the stream of holy Law,<br> They who release him, paying sacred rites,truly to such doth he announce great wealth.<br> 5 He who grows mightily in herbs, within each fruitful mother and each babe she bears,<br> Wise, life of all men, in the waters home,for him have sages built as twere a seat.</p>
