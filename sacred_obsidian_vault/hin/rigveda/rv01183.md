 <p>1. MAKE ready that which passes thought in swiftness, that hath three wheels and triple seat, ye Mighty,<br> Whereon ye seek the dwelling of the pious, whereon, threefold, ye fly like birds with pinions.<br> 2 Light rolls your easy chariot faring earthward, what time, for food, ye, full of wisdom, mount it.<br> May this song, wondrous fair, attend your glory: ye, as ye travel, wait on Dawn Heaven's Daughter.<br> 3 Ascend your lightly rolling car, approaching the worshipper who turns him to his duties,<br> Whereon ye come unto the house to quicken man and his offspring, O Nāsatyas, Heroes.<br> 4 Let not the wolf, let not the she-wolf harm you. Forsake me not, nor pass me by or others.<br> Here stands your share, here is your hymn, ye Mighty: yours are these vessels, full of pleasant juices.<br> 5 Gotama, Purumīlha, Atri bringing oblations all invoke you for protection.<br> Like one who goes straight to the point directed, ye Nāsatyas, to mine invocation.<br> 6 We have passed oer the limit of this darkness: our praise hath been bestowed on you, O Aśvins.<br> Come hitherward by paths which Gods have travelled. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
