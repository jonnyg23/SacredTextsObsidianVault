 <p>1. Now do I glorify their mighty cohort, the company of these the youthful Maruts,<br> Who ride impetuous on with rapid horses, and radiant in themselves, are Lords of Amṛta.<br> 2 The mighty glittering band, arm-bound with bracelets, givers of bliss, unmeasured in their greatness,<br> With magical powers, bountiful, ever-roaring,these, liberal Heroes, venerate thou singer.<br> 3 This day may all your water-bringers, Maruts, they who impel the falling rain, approach us.<br> This fire, O Maruts, hath been duly kindled; let it find favour with you, youthful Sages.<br> 4 Ye raise up for the folk an active ruler whom, Holy Ones! a Master's hand hath fashioned.<br> Ye send the fighter hand to hand, armmighty, and the brave hero, Maruts with good horses.<br> 5 They spring forth more and more, strong in their glories, like days, like spokes where none are last in order.<br> Highest and mightiest are the Sons of Pṛśni. Firm to their own intention cling the Maruts.<br> 6 When ye have hastened on with spotted coursers, O Maruts, on your cars with strong-wrought fellies,<br> The waters are disturbed, the woods are shattered. Let Dyaus the Red Steer send his thunder downward.<br> 7 Even Earth hath spread herself wide at their coming, and they as husbands have with power impregned her.<br> They to the pole have yoked the winds for coursers: their sweat have they made rain, these Sons of Rudra.<br> 8 Ho! Maruts, Heroes, skilled in Law, immortal, be gracious unto us, ye rich in treasures,<br> Ye hearers of the truth, ye sage and youthful, grown mighty, dwelling on the lofty mountains.</p>
