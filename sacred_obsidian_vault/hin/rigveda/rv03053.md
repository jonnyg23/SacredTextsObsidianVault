 <p>1. ON a high car, O Parvata and Indra, bring pleasant viands, with brave heroes, hither.<br> Enjoy the gifts, Gods, at our sacrifices wax strong by hymns, rejoice in our oblation.<br> 2 Stay still, O Maghavan, advance no farther. a draught of well-pressed Soma will I give thee.<br> With sweetest song I grasp, O Mighty Indra, thy garment's hem as a child grasps his father's.<br> 3 Adhvaryu, sing we both; sing thou in answer: make we a laud acceptable to Indra.<br> Upon this sacrificer's grass he seated: to Indra shall our eulogy be uttered.<br> 4 A wife, O Maghavan is home and dwelling: so let thy Bay Steeds yoked convey thee hither.<br> Whenever we press out for thee the Soma, let Agni as our Herald speed to call thee.<br> 5 Depart, O Maghavan;again come hither: both there and here thy goat is Indra, Brother,<br> Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and where thqu loosest thy loud-neighing Courser.<br> 6 Thou hast drunk Soma, Indra, turn thee homeward; thy joy is in thy home, thy racious Consort;<br> Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and thy strong Courser is set free with guerdon.<br> 7 Bounteous are these, Aṅgirases, Virupas: the Asura's Heroes and the Sons of Heaven.<br> They, giving store of wealth to Viśvāmitra, prolong his life through countless Soma-pressings.<br> 8 Maghavan weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body,<br> Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a moment, through fit prayers, from heaven.<br> 9 The mighty sage, God-born and God-incited, who looks on men, restrained the billowy river.<br> When Viśvāmitra was Sudās's escort, then Indra through the Kuśikas grew friendly.<br> 10 Like swans, prepare a song of praise with pressing-stones, glad in your hymns with juice poured forth in sacrifice.<br> Ye singers, with the Gods, sages who look on men, ye Kutikas drink up the Soma's savoury meath.<br> 11 Come forward, Kuśikas, and be attentive; let loose Sudās's horse to win him riches.<br> East, west, and north, let the King slay the foeman, then at earth's choicest place perform his worship.<br> 12 Praises to Indra have I sung, sustainer of this earth and heaven. This prayer of Viśvāmitra keeps secure the race of Bharatas.<br> 13 The Viśvāmitras have sung forth this prayer to Indra Thunder-aimed:<br> So let him make us prosperous.<br> 14 Among the Kikatas what do thy cattle? They pour no milky draught, they heat no caldron.<br> Bring thou to us the wealth of Pramaganda;give up to us, O Maghavan, the low-born.<br> 15 Sasarpari, the gift of Jamadagnis, hath lowed with mighty voice dispelling famine.<br> The Daughter of the Sun hath spread our glory among the Gods, imperishable, deathless.<br> 16 Sasarpari brought glory speedily to these, over the generations of the Fivefold Race;<br> Daughter of Paksa, she bestows new vital power, she whom the ancient Jamadagnis gave to me.<br> 17 Strong be the pair of oxen, firm the axles, let not the pole slip nor the yoke be broken.<br> May Indra, keep the yoke-pins from decaying: attend us, thou whose fellies are uninjured.<br> 18 O Indra, give our bodies strength, strength to the bulls who draw the wains,<br> Strength to our seed and progeny that they may live, for thou art he who giveth strength.<br> 19 Enclose thee in the heart of Khayar timber, in the car wrought of Sinsapa put firmness.<br> Show thyself strong, O Axle, fixed and strengthened: throw us not from the car whereon we travel.<br> 20 Let not this sovran of the wood leave us forlorn or injure us.<br> Safe may we be until we reach our homes and rest us and unyoke.<br> 21 With various aids this day come to us, Indra, with best aids speed us, Maghavan, thou Hero.<br> Let him who hatcth us fall headlong downward: him whom we hate let vital breath abandon.<br> 22 He heats his very axe, and then cuts a mere Semal blossom off.<br> O Indra, like a caldron cracked and seething, so he pours out foam.<br> 23 Men notice not the arrow, O ye people; they bring the red beast deeming it a bullock.<br> A sluggish steed men run not with the courser, nor ever lead an ass before a charger.<br> 24 These men, the sons of Bhārata, O Indra, regard not severance or close connexion.<br> They urge their own steed as it were another's, and take him, swift as the bow's string, to battle.</p>
