 <p>1. DOWN to the stream a maiden came, and found the Soma by the way.<br> Bearing it to her home she said, For Indra will I press thee out, for Śakra will I press thee out.<br> 2 Thou roaming yonder, little man, beholding every house in turn,<br> Drink thou this Soma pressed with teeth, accompanied with grain and curds, with cake of meal and song of praise.<br> 3 Fain would we learn to know thee well, nor yet can we attain to thee.<br> Still slowly and in gradual drops, O Indu, unto Indra flow.<br> 4 Will he not help and work for us? Will he not make us wealthier?<br> Shall we not, hostile to our lord, unite ourselves to Indra now?<br> 5 O Indra, cause to sprout again three places, these which I declare,<br> My father's head, his cultured field, and this the part below my waist.<br> 6 Make all of these grow crops of hair, you cultivated field of ours,<br> My body, and my father's head.<br> 7 Cleansing Apala, Indra! thrice, thou gavest sunlike skin to her,<br> Drawn, Śatakratu! through the hole of car, of wagon, and of yoke.</p>
