 <p>1. WE have beheld her earliest lights approaching: her many glories part, on high, asunder.<br> On car sublime, refulgent, wending hither, O Uṣas, bring the Wealth that makes us happy.<br> 2 The fire well-kindIed sings aloud to greet her, and with their hymns the priests are chaming welcome.<br> Uṣas approaches in her splendour, driving all evil darkness far away, the Goddess.<br> 3 Apparent eastward are those lights of Morning, sending out lustre, as they rise, around them.<br> She hath brought forth Sun, sacrifice, and Agni, and far away hath fled detested darkness.<br> 4 Rich Daughter of the Sky, we all behold her, yea, all men look on Dawn as she is breaking.<br> fler car that moves self-harnessed hath she mounted, the car drawn onward by her well-yoked horses.<br> 5 Inspired with loving thoughts this day to greet thee, we and our wealthy nobles have awakened.<br> Show yourselves fruitful, Dawns, as ye are rising. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
