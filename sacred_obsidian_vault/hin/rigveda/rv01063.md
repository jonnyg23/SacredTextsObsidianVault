 <p>1. THOU art the Mighty One; when born, O Indra, with power thou terrifiedst earth and heaven;<br> When, in their fear of thee, all firm-set mountains and monstrous creatures shook like dust before thee.<br> 2 When thy two wandering Bays thou drawest hither, thy praiser laid within thine arms the thunder,<br> Wherewith, O Much-invoked, in will resistless, thou smitest foemen down and many a castle.<br> 3 Faithful art thou, these thou defiest, Indra; thou art the Ṛbhus' Lord, heroic, victor.<br> Thou, by his side, for young and glorious Kutsa, with steed and car in battle slewest Śuṣṇa,<br> 4 That, as a friend, thou furtheredst, O Indra, when, Thunderer, strong in act, thou crushedst Vṛtra;<br> When, Hero, thou, great-souled, with easy conquest didst rend the Dasyus in their<br> distant dwelling.<br> 5 This doest thou, and art not harmed, O Indra, een in the anger of the strongest mortal.<br> Lay thou the race-course open for our horses: as with a club, slay, Thunder-armed! our foemen.<br> 6 Hence men invoke thee, Indra, in the tumult of battle, in the light-bestowing conflict.<br> This aid of thine, O Godlike One, was ever to be implored in deeds of might in combat.<br> 7 Warring for Purukutsa thou, O Indra, Thunder-armed! breakest down the seven castles;<br> Easily, for Sudās, like grass didst rend them, and out of need, King, broughtest gain to Pūru.<br> 8 O Indra, God who movest round about us, feed us with varied food plenteous as water<br> Food wherewithal, O Hero, thou bestowest vigour itself to flow to us for ever.<br> 9 Prayers have been made by Gotamas, O Indra, addressed to thee, with laud for thy Bay Horses.<br> Bring us in noble shape abundant riches. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.</p>
