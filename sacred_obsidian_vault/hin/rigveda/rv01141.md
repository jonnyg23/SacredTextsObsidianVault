 <p>1. YEA, verily, the fair effulgence of the God for glory was established, since he sprang from strength.<br> When he inclines thereto successful is the hymn: the songs of sacrifice have brought him as they flow<br> 2 Wonderful, rich in nourishment, he dwells in food; next, in the seven auspicious Mothers is his home.<br> Thirdly, that they might drain the treasures of the Bull, the maidens brought forth him for whom the ten provide.<br> 3 What time from out the deep, from the Steer's wondrous form, the Chiefs who had the power produced him with their strength;<br> When Mātariśvan rubbed forth him who lay concealed, for mixture of the sweet drink, in the days of old.<br> 4 When from the Highest Father he is brought to us, amid the plants he rises hungry, wondrously.<br> As both together join to expedite his birth, most youthful he is born resplendent in his light.<br> 5 Then also entered he the Mothers, and in them pure and uninjured he increased in magnitude.<br> As to the first he rose, the vigorous from of old, so now he runs among the younger lowest ones.<br> 6 Therefore they choose him Herald at the morning rites, pressing to him as unto Bhaga, pouring gifts,<br> When, much-praised, by the power and will of Gods, he goes at all times to his mortal worshipper to drink.<br> 7 What time the Holy One, wind-urged, hath risen up, serpent-like winding through the dry grass unrestrained,<br> Dust lies upon the way of him who burneth all, black-winged and pure of birth who follows sundry paths.<br> 8 Like a swift chariot made by men who know their art, he with his red limbs lifts himself aloft to heaven.<br> Thy worshippers become by burning black of hue: their strength flies as before a hero's violence.<br> 9 By thee, O Agni, Varuṇa who guards the Law, Mitra and Aryaman, the Bounteous, are made strong;<br> For, as the felly holds the spokes, thou with thy might pervading hast been born encompassing them round.<br> 10 Agni, to him who toils and pours libations, thou, Most Youthful! sendest wealth and all the host of Gods.<br> Thee, therefore, even as Bhaga, will we set anew, young Child of Strength, most wealthy! in our battle-song.<br> 11 Vouchsafe us riches turned to worthy ends, good luck abiding in the house, and strong capacity,<br> Wealth that directs both worlds as they were guiding-reins, and, very Wise, the Gods assent in sacrifice.<br> 12 May he, the Priest resplendent, joyful, hear us, he with the radiant car and rapid horses.<br> May Agni, ever wise, with best directions to bliss and highest happiness conduct us.<br> 13 With hymns of might hath Agni now been lauded, advanced to height of universal kingship.<br> Now may these wealthy chiefs and we together spread forth as spreads the Sun above the rain-clouds.</p>
