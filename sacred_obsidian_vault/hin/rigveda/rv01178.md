 <p>1. IF, Indra, thou hast given that gracious hearing where with thou helpest those who sang thy praises.<br> Blast not the wish that would exalt us may I gain all from thee, and pay all man's devotions.<br> 2 Let not the Sovran Indra disappoint us in what shall bring both Sisters to our dwelling.<br> To him have run the quickly flowing waters. May Indra come to us with life and friendship.<br> 3 Victorious with the men, Hero in battles, Indra, who hears the singer's supplication,<br> Will bring his car nigh to the man who offers, if he himself upholds the songs that praise him.<br> 4 Yea, Indra, with the men, through love of glory consumes the sacred food which friends have offered.<br> The ever-strengthening song of him who worships is sung in fight amid the clash of voices.<br> 5 Aided by thee, O Maghavan, O Indra, may we subdue our foes who count them mighty.<br> Be our protector, strengthen and increase us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
