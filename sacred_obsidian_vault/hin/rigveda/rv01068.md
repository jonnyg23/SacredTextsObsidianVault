 <p>1. COMMINGLING, restless, he ascends the sky, unveiling nights and all that stands or moves,<br> As he the sole God is preeminent in greatness among all these other Gods.<br> 2 All men are joyful in thy power, O God, that living from the dry wood thou art born.<br> All truly share thy Godhead while they keep, in their accustomed ways, eternal Law.<br> 3 Strong is the thought of Law, the Law's behest; all works have they performed; he quickens all.<br> Whoso will bring oblation, gifts to thee, to him, bethinking thee, vouchsafe thou wealth.<br> 4 Seated as Priest with Manu's progeny, of all these treasures he alone is Lord.<br> Men yearn for children to prolong their line, and are not disappointed in their hope.<br> 5 Eagerly they who hear his word fulfil his wish as sons obey their sire's behest.<br> He, rich in food, unbars his wealth like doors: he, the House-Friend, hath decked heaven's vault with stars.</p>
