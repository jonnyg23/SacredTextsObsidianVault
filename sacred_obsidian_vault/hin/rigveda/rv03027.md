 <p>1. IN ladle dropping oil your food goes in oblation up to heaven,<br> Goes to the Gods in search of bliss.<br> 2 Agni I laud, the Sage inspired, crowner of sacrifice through song,<br> Who listens and gives bounteous gifts.<br> 3 O Agni, if we might obtain control of thee the potent God,<br> Then should we overcome our foes.<br> 4 Kindled at sacrifices he is Agni, hallower, meet for praise,<br> With flame for hair: to him we seek.<br> 5 Immortal Agni, shining far, enrobed with oil, well worshipped, bears<br> The gifts of sacrifice away.<br> 6 The priests with ladles lifted up, worshipping here with holy thought,<br> Have brought this Agni for our aid.<br> 7 Immortal, Sacrificer, God, with wondrous power he leads the way,<br> Urging the great assembly on.<br> 8 Strong, he is set on deeds ofstrength. In sacrifices led in front,<br> As Singer he completes the rite.<br> 9 Excellent, he was made by thought. The Germ of beings have I gained,<br> Yea, and die Sire of active strength.<br> 10 Thee have I stablished, Excellent, O strengthened by the sage's prayer,<br> Thee, Agni, longing, nobly bright.<br> 11 Agni, the swift and active One, singers, at time of sacrifice,<br> Eagerly kindle with their food.<br> 12 Agni the Son of Strength who shines up to the heaven in solemn rites,<br> The wise of heart, I glorify.<br> 13 Meet to be lauded and adored, showing in beauty through the dark,<br> Agni, the Strong, is kindled well.<br> 14 Agni is kindled as a bull, like a horsebearer of the Gods:<br> Men with oblations worship him.<br> 15 Thee will we kindle as a bull, we who are Bulls ourselves, O Bull.<br> Thee, Agni, shining mightily.</p>
