 <p>1 HIS bright rays bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that lives,<br> Sūrya, that all may look on him.<br> 2 The constellations pass away, like thieves, together with their beams,<br> Before the all-beholding Sun.<br> 3 His herald rays are seen afar refulgent oer the world of men,<br> Like flames of fire that burn and blaze.<br> 4 Swift and all beautiful art thou, O Sūrya, maker of the light,<br> Illuming all the radiant realm.<br> 5 Thou goest to the hosts of Gods, thou comest hither to mankind,<br> Hither all light to be beheld.<br> 6 With that same eye of thine wherewith thou lookest brilliant Varuṇa,<br> Upon the busy race of men,<br> 7 Traversing sky and wide mid-air, thou metest with thy beams our days,<br> Sun, seeing all things that have birth.<br> 8 Seven Bay Steeds harnessed to thy car bear thee, O thou farseeing One,<br> God, Sūrya, with the radiant hair.<br> 9 Sūrya hath yoked the pure bright Seven, the daughters of the car; with these,<br> His own dear team, he goeth forth.<br> 10 Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have come<br> To Sūrya, God among the Gods, the light that is most excellent.<br> 11 Rising this day, O rich in friends, ascending to the loftier heaven,<br> Sūrya remove my heart's disease, take from me this my yellow hue.<br> 12 To parrots and to starlings let us give away my yellowness,<br> Or this my yellowness let us transfer to Haritāla trees.<br> 13 With all his conquering vigour this Āditya hath gone up on high,<br> Giving my foe into mine hand: let me not be my foeman's prey.</p>
