 <p>1. HE whom the priests in sundry ways arranging the sacrifice, of one accord, bring hither,<br> Who was appointed as a learned Brahman, -what is the sacrificer's knowledge of him?<br> 2 Kindled in many a spot, still One is Agni; Silrya is One though high oer all he shineth.<br> Illumining this All, still One is usas. That which is One hath into All developed.<br> 3 The chariot bright and radiant, treasure-laden, three-wheeled, with easy seat, and lightly rolling,<br> Which She of Wondrous Wealth was born to harness,this car of yours I call. Drink what remaineth.</p>
