 <p>1. THE robes which ye put on abound with fatness: uninterrupted courses are your counsels.<br> All falsehood, Mitra-Varuṇa! ye conquer, and closely cleave unto the Law Eternal.<br> 2 This might of theirs hath no one comprehended. True is the crushing word the sage hath uttered,<br> The fearful four-edged bolt smites down the three-edged, and those who hate the Gods first fall and perish.<br> 3 The Footless Maid precedeth footed creatures. Who marketh, Mitra-Varuṇa, this your doing?<br> The Babe Unborn supporteth this world's burthen, fulfilleth Law and overcometh falsehood.<br> 4 We look on him the darling of the Maidens, always advancing, never falling downward,<br> Wearing inseparable, wide-spread raiment, Mitra's and Varuṇa's delightful glory.<br> 5 Unbridled Courser, born but not of horses, neighing he flieth on with back uplifted.<br> The youthful love mystery thought-surpassing, praising in Mitra-Varuṇa, its glory.<br> 6 May the milch-kine who favour Māmateya prosper in this world him who loves devotion.<br> May he, well skilled in rites, be food, and calling Aditi with his lips give us assistance.<br> 7 Gods, Mitra-Varuṇa, with love and worship, let me make you delight in this oblation.<br> May our prayer be victorious in battles, may we have rain from heaven to make us prosper.</p>
