 <p>1. WHEN we have pressed the juice we laud thee, Indra, and when, Most Valorous we have won the booty.<br> Bring us prosperity, as each desires it under thine own protection may we conquer.<br> 2 Sublime from birth, mayst thou O Indra, Hero, with Sūrya overcome the Dāsa races.<br> As by a fountain's side, we bring the Soma that lay concealed, close-hidden in the waters.<br> 3 Answer the votary's hymns, for these thou knowest, craving the Ṛṣis prayer, thyself a Singer<br> May we be they who take delight in Somas: these with sweet food for thee, O Chariot-rider.<br> 4 These holy prayers, O Indra, have I sung thee: grant to the men the strength of men, thou Hero.<br> Be of one mind with those in whom thou joyest: keep thou the singers safe and their companions.<br> 5 Listen to Pṛthi's call, heroic Indra, and be thou lauded by the hymns of Venya,<br> Him who hath sung thee to thine oil-rich dwelling, whose rolling songs have sped thee like a torrent.</p>
