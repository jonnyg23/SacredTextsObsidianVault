 <p>1. I HAVE enriched the singer with surpassing wealth; I have allowed the holy hymn to strengthen me.<br> I, furtherer of him who offers sacrifice, have conquered in each fight the men who worship not.<br> 2 The People of the heavens, the waters, and the earth have stablished me among the Gods with Indra's name.<br> I took unto myself the two swift vigorous Bays that speed on divers paths, and the fierce bolt for strength.<br> 3 With deadly blows I smote Atka for Kavi's sake; I guarded Kutsa well with these saving helps.<br> As Śuṣṇa's slayer I brandished the dart of death: I gave not up the Āryan name to Dasyu foes.<br> 4 Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus I gave as prey to Kutsa, father-like, to succour him.<br> I was a worthy King to rule the worshipper, when I gave Tuji dear inviolable gifts.<br> 5 I gave up Mṛgaya to Srutarvan as his prey because he ever followed me and kept my laws.<br> For Āyu's sake I caused Veta to bend and bow, and into Savya's hand delivered Padgrbhi.<br> 6 1, I crushed Navavāstva of the lofty car, the Dāsa, as the Vṛtra-slayer kills the fiends;<br> When straightway on the region's farthest edge I brought the God who makes the lights to broaden and increase.<br> 7 I travel round about borne onward in my might by the fleet-footed dappled Horses of the Sun.<br> When man's libation calls me to the robe of state I soon repel the powerful Dasyu with my blows.<br> 8 Stronger am I than Nabus, I who slew the seven: I glorified with might Yadu and Turvaga.<br> I brought another low, with strength I bent his strength: I let the mighty nine-and-ninety wax in power.<br> 9 Bull over all the streams that flow along the earth, I took the Seven Rivers as mine own domain.<br> I, gifted with great wisdom, spread the floods abroad: by war I found for man the way to high success.<br> 10 I set within these cows the white milk which no God, not even Tvaṣṭar's self, had there deposited,<br> Much-longed-for, in the breasts, the udders of the kine, the savoury sweets of meath, the milk and Soma juice.<br> 11 Even thus hath Indra Maghavan, truly bounteous, sped Gods and men with mighty operation.<br> The pious glorify all these thine exploits, Lord of Bay Coursers, Strong, and Selfresplendent.</p>
