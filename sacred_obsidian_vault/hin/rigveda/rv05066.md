 <p>1. O SAPIENT man, call the Two Gods, the very wise, who slay the foe.<br> For Varuṇa, whose form is Law, place offerings for his great delight.<br> 2 For they have won unbroken sway in full perfection, power divine.<br> And, like high laws, the world of man hath been made beautiful as light.<br> 3 Therefore we praise you that your cars may travel far in front of ours-<br> You who accept the eulogy of Ratahavya with his hymns.<br> 4 And ye show wMom, Wondrous Gods with fulness of intellIgence.<br> By men's discernment are Ve marked, O ye whose might is purified.<br> 5 This is the Law sublime, O Earth: to aid the Ṛṣis toil for fame<br> The Two, wide-spreading, are prepared. They come with ample overflow.<br> 6 Mitra, ye Gods with wandering eyes, would that the worshippers and we<br> Might strive to reach the realm ye rule, most spacious and protected well,</p>
