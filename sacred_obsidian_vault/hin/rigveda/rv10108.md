 <p>1. WHAT wish of Saramā hath brought her hither? The path leads far away to distant places.<br> What charge hast thou for us? Where turns thy journey? How hast thou made thy way oer Rasā's waters.<br> 2 I come appointed messenger of Indra, seeking your ample stores of wealth, O Paṇis.<br> This hath preserved me from the fear of crossing: thus have I made my way oer Rasā's waters.<br> 3 What is that Indra like, what is his aspect whose envoy, Saramā, from afar thou comest?<br> Let him approach, and we will show him friendship: he shall be made the herdsman of our cattle.<br> 4 I know him safe from harm: but he can punish who sent me hither from afar as envoy.<br> Him rivers flowing with deep waters bide not. Low will ye be, O Paṇis, slain by Indra.<br> 5 These are the kine which, Saramā, thou seekest, flying, O Blest One, to the ends of heaven.<br> Who will loose these for thee without a battle? Yea, and sharp-pointed are our warlike weapons.<br> 6 Even if your wicked bodies, O ye Paṇis, were arrow-proof, your words are weak for wounding;<br> And were the path to you as yet unmastered, Bṛhaspati in neither case will spare you.<br> 7 Paved with the rock is this our treasure-chamber; filled full of precious things, of kine, and horses.<br> These Paṇis who are watchful keepers guard it. In vain hast thou approached this lonely station.<br> 8 Ṛṣis will come inspirited with Soma, Aṅgirases unwearied, and Navagvas.<br> This stall of cattle will they part among them: then will the Paṇis wish these words unspoken.<br> 9 Even thus, O Saramā, hast thou come hither, forced by celestial might to make the journey.<br> Turn thee not back, for thou shalt be our sister: O Blest One, we will give thee of the cattle.<br> 10 Brotherhood, sisterhood, I know not either: the dread Aṅgirases and Indra know them.<br> They seemed to long for kine when I departed. Hence, into distance, be ye gone, O Paṇis.<br> 11 Hence, far away, ye Paṇis! Let the cattle lowing come forth as holy Law commandeth,<br> Kine which Bṛhaspati, and Soma, Ṛṣis, sages, and pressing-stones have found when hidden.</p>
