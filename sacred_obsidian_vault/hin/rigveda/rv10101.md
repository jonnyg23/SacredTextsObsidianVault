 <p>1. WAKE with one mind, my friends, and kindle Agni, ye who are many and who dwell together.<br> Agni and Dadhikrās and Dawn the Goddess, you, Gods with Indra, I call down to help us.<br> 2 Make pleasant hymns, spin out your songs and praises: build ye a ship equipped with oars for transport.<br> Prepare the implements, make all things ready, and let the sacrifice, my friends, go forward.<br> 3 Lay on the yokes, and fasten well the traces: formed is the furrow, sow the seed within it.<br> Through song may we find bearing fraught with plenty: near to the ripened grain approach the sickle.<br> 4 Wise, through desire of bliss from Gods, the skilful bind the traces fast, And lay the yokes on either side.<br> 5 Arrange the buckets in their place securely fasten on the straps.<br> We will pour forth the well that hath a copious stream, fair-flowing well that never fails.<br> 6 I pour the water from the well with pails prepared and goodly straps,<br> Unfailing, full, with plenteous stream.<br> 7 Refresh the horses, win the prize before you: equip a chariot fraught with happy fortune.<br> Pour forth the well with stone wheel, wooden buckets, the drink of heroes, with the trough for armour.<br> 8 Prepare the cow-stall, for there drink your heroes: stitch ye the coats of armour, wide and many.<br> Make iron forts, secure from all assailants let not your pitcher leak: stay it securely.<br> 9 Hither, for help, I turn the holy heavenly mind of you the Holy Gods, that longs for sacrifice.<br> May it pour milk for us, even as a stately cow who, having sought the pasture, yields a thousand streams.<br> 10 Pour golden juice within the wooden vessel: with stone-made axes fashion ye and form it.<br> Embrace and compass it with tenfold girdle, and to both chariot-poles attach the car-horse.<br> 11 Between both poles the car-horse goes pressed closely, as in his dwelling moves the doubly-wedded.<br> Lay in the wood the Soviran of the Forest, and sink the well although ye do not dig it.<br> 12 Indra is he, O men, who gives us happiness: sport, urge the giver of delight to win us strength<br> Bring quickly down, O priests, hither to give us aid, to drink the Soma, Indra Son of Nistigri.</p>
