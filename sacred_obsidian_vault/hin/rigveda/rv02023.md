 <p>1. WE call thee, Lord and Leader of the heavenly hosts, the wise among the wise, the famousest of all,<br> The King supreme of prayers, O Brahmaṇaspati: hear us with help; sit down in place of sacrifice.<br> 2 Bṛhaspati, God immortal! verily the Gods have gained from thee, the wise, a share in holy rites.<br> As with great light the Sun brings forth the rays of morn, so thou alone art Father of all sacred prayer.<br> 3 When thou hast chased away revilers and the gloom, thou mountest the refulgent car of sacrifice;<br> The awful car, Bṛhaspati, that quells the foe, slays demons, cleaves the stall of kine, and finds the light.<br> 4 Thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress oertakes not him who offers gifts to thee.<br> Him who hates prayer thou punishest, Bṛhaspati, quelling his wrath: herein is thy great mightiness.<br> 5 No sorrow, no distress from any side, no foes, no creatures double-tongued have overcome the man,<br> Thou drivest all seductive fiends away from him whom, careful guard, thou keepest Brahmaṇaspati.<br> 6 Thou art our keeper, wise, preparer of our paths: we, for thy service, sing to thee with hymns of praise.<br> Bṛhaspati, whoever lays a snare for us, him may his evil fate, precipitate, destroy.<br> 7 Him, too, who threatens us without offence of ours, the evilminded, arrogant, rapacious man,<br> Him turn thou from our path away, Bṛhaspati: give us fair access to this banquet of the Gods.<br> 8 Thee as protector of our bodies we invoke, thee, saviour, as the comforter who loveth us.<br> Strike, O Bṛhaspati, the Gods revilers down, and let not the unrighteous come to highest bliss.<br> 9 Through thee, kind prosperer, O Brahmaṇaspati, may we obtain the wealth of Men which all desire:<br> And all our enemies, who near or far away prevail against us, crush, and leave them destitute.<br> 10 With thee as our own rich and liberal ally may we, Bṛhaspati, gain highest power of life.<br> Let not the guileful wicked man be lord of us:still may we prosper, singing goodly hymns of praise.<br> 11 Strong, never yielding, hastening to the battle-cry, consumer of the foe, victorious in the strife,<br> Thou art sin's true avenger, Brahmaṇaspati, who tamest een the fierce, the wildly passionate.<br> 12 Whoso with mind ungodly seeks to do us harm, who, deeming him a man of might mid lords, would slay,<br> Let not his deadly blow reach us, Bṛhaspati; may we humiliate the strong ill-doer's wrath.<br> 13 The mover mid the spoil, the winner of all wealth, to be invoked in fight and reverently adored,<br> Bṛhaspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who fain would injure us.<br> 14 Burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand, those who have scorned thee in thy manifested might.<br> Show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise: destroy the evil speakers, O Bṛhaspati.<br> 15 Bṛhaspati, that which the foe deserves not which shines among the folk effectual, splendid,<br> That, Son of Law I which is with might refulgent-that treasure wonderful bestow thou on us.<br> 16 Give us not up to those who, foes in ambuscade, are greedy for the wealth of him who sits at ease,<br> Who cherish in their heart abandonment of Gods. Bṛhaspati, no further rest shall they obtain.<br> 17 For Tvaṣṭar, he who knows each sacred song, brought thee to life, preeminent oer all the things that be.<br> Guilt-scourger, guilt-avenger is Bṛhaspati, who slays the spoiler and upholds the mighty Law.<br> 18 The mountain, for thy glory, cleft itself apart when, Aṅgiras! thou openedst the stall of kine.<br> Thou, O Bṛhaspati, with Indra for ally didst hurl down water-floods which gloom had compassed round.<br> 19 O Brahmaṇaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn and prosper thou our children.<br> All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
