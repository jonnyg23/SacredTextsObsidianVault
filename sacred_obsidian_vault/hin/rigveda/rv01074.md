 <p>1. As forth to sacrifice we go, a hymn to a hymn let us say,<br> Who hears us even when afar;<br> 2 Who, from of old, in carnage, when the people gathered, hath preserved<br> His household for the worshipper.<br> 3 And let men say, Agni is born, een he who slayeth Vṛtra, he<br> Who winneth wealth in every fight.<br> 4 Him in whose house an envoy thou lovest to taste his offered gifts,<br> And strengthenest his sacrifice,<br> 5 Him, Aṅgiras, thou Son of Strength, all men call happy in his God,<br> His offerings, and his sacred grass.<br> 6 Hitherward shalt thou bring these Gods to our laudation and to taste.<br> These offered gifts, fair-shining One.<br> 7 When, Agni, on thine embassage thou goest not a sound is heard of steed or straining of thy car.<br> 8 Aided by thee uninjured, strong, one after other, goes he forth:<br> Agni, the offerer forward steps.<br> 9 And splendid strength, heroic, high, Agni, thou grantest from the Gods,<br> Thou God, to him who offers gifts.</p>
