 <p>1. THAT noblest Furtherer hath appeared, to whom men bring their holy works.<br> Our songs of praise have risen aloft to Agni who was barn to give the Ārya strength.<br> 2 Agni of Divodāsa turned, as twere in majesty, to the Gods.<br> Onward he sped along the mother earth, and took his station in the height of heaven.<br> 3 Him before whom the people shrink when he performs his glorious deeds,<br> Him who wins thousands at the worship of the Gods, himself, that Agni, serve with son s.<br> 4 The mortal man whom thou wouldst lead to opulence, O Vasu, he who brings thee gifts.<br> He, Agni, wins himself a hero singing lauds, yea, one who feeds a thousand men.<br> 5 He with the steed wins spoil even in the fenced fort, and gains imperishable fame.<br> In thee, O Lord of wealth, continually we lay all precious offerings to the Gods.<br> 6 To him who dealeth out all wealth, who is the cheerful Priest of men,<br> To him, like the first vessels filled with savoury juice, to Agni go the songs of praise.<br> 7 Votaries, richly-gifted, deck him with their songs, even as the steed who draws the car.<br> On both, Strong Lord of men! on child and grandson pour the bounties which our nobles give.<br> 8 Sing forth to him, the Holy, most munificent, sublime with his refulgent glow,<br> To Agni, ye Upastutas.<br> 9 Worshipped with gifts, enkindled, splendid, Maghavan shall win himself heroic fame.<br> And will not his most newly shown benevolence come to us with abundant strength?<br> 10 Priest, presser of the juice! praise now the dearest Guest of all our friends,<br> Agni, the driver of the cars.<br> 11 Who, finder-out of treasures open and concealed, bringeth them hither, Holy One;<br> Whose waves, as in a cataract, are hard to pass, when he, through song, would win him strength.<br> 12 Let not the noble Guest, Agni, be wroth with us: by many a man his praise is sung,<br> Good Herald, skilled in sacrifice.<br> 13 O Vasu, Agni, let not them be harmed who come in any way with lauds to thee.<br> Even the lowly, skilled in rites, with offered gifts, seeketh thee for the envoy's task.<br> 14 Friend of the Maruts, Agni, come with Rudras to the Soma-draught,<br> To Sobhar's fair song of praise, and be thou joyful in the light.<br> VALAKHILYA</p>
