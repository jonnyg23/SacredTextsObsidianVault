 <p>1. IF I, O Indra, were, like thee, the single Sovran of all wealth,<br> My worshipper should be rich in kine.<br> 2 I should be fain, O Lord of Power, to strengthen and enrich the sage,<br> Were I the Lord of herds of kine.<br> 3 To worshippers who press the juice thy goodness, Indra, is a cow<br> Yielding in plenty kine and steeds.<br> 4 None is there, Indra, God or man, to hinder thy munificence,<br> The wealth which, lauded, thou wilt give.<br> 5 The sacrifice made Indra strong when he unrolled the earth, and made<br> Himself a diadem in heaven.<br> 6 Thine aid we claim, O Indra, thine who after thou hast waxen great<br> Hast won all treasures for thine own.<br> 7 In Soma's ecstasy Indra spread the firmament and realms of light,<br> When he cleft Vala limb from limb.<br> 8 Showing the hidden he drave forth the cows for the Aṅgirases,<br> And Vala he cast headlong down.<br> 9 By Indra were the lumirious realms of heaven established and secured,<br> Firm and immovable from their place.<br> 10 Indra, thy laud moves quickly like a joyous wave of water-floods:<br> Bright shine the drops that gladden thee.<br> 11 For thou, O Indra, art the God whom hymns and praises magnify:<br> Thou blessest those who worship thee.<br> 12 Let the two long-maned Bay Steeds bring Indra to drink the Soma juice,<br> The Bountiful to our sacrifice.<br> 13 With waters' foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuci,<br> Subduing all contending hosts.<br> 14 The Dasyus, when they fain would climb<br> by magic arts and mount to heaven,<br> Thou, Indra, castest down to earth.<br> 15 As Soma-drinker conquering all, thou scatteredst to every side<br> Their settlement who poured no gifts.</p>
