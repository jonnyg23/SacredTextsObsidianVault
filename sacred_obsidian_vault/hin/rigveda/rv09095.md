 <p>1. Loud neighs the Tawny Steed when started, settling deep in the wooden vessel while they cleanse him.<br> Led by the men he takes the milk for raiment: then shall he, through his powers, engender praise-songs.<br> 2 As one who rows drives on his boat, he, Gold-hued, sends forth his voice, loosed on the path of Order.<br> As God, the secret names of Gods he utters, to be declared on sacred grass more widely.<br> 3 Hastening onward like the waves of waters, our holy hymns are pressing nigh to Soma.<br> To him they come with lowly adoration, and, longing, enter him who longs to meet them.<br> 4 They drain the stalk, the Steer who dwells on mountains, even as a Bull who decks him on the upland.<br> Hymns follow and attend him as he bellows: Trita bears Varuṇa aloft in ocean.<br> 5 Sending thy voice out as Director, loosen the Invoker's thought, O Indu, as they cleanse thee.<br> While thou and Indra rule for our advantage, may we be masters of heroic vigour.</p>
