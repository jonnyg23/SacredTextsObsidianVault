 <p>1. WITH all the succours that are yours, O Aśvins, hither come to us:<br> Wonderful, borne on paths of gold, drink ye the meath with Soma juice.<br> 2 Come now, ye Aśvins, on your car decked with a sun-bright canopy,<br> Bountiful, with your golden forms, Sages with depth of intellect.<br> 3 Come hither from the Nahusas, come, drawn by pure hymns, from mid-air.<br> O Aśvins, drink the savoury juice shed in the Kaṇvas' sacrifice.<br> 4 Come to us hither from the heavens, come from mid-air, well-loved by us:<br> Here Kaṇva's son hath pressed for you the pleasant meath of Soma juice.<br> 5 Come, Aśvins, to give car to us, to drink the Soma, Aśvins, come.<br> Hail, Strengtheners of the praise-song speed onward, ye Heroes, with your thoughts.<br> 6 As, Heroes, in the olden time the Ṛṣis called you to their aid,<br> So now, O Aśvins, come to us, come near to this mine eulogy.<br> 7 Even from the luminous sphere of heaven come to us, ye who find the light,<br> Carers for Vatsa, through our prayers and lauds, O yewho hearour call.<br> 8 Do others more than we adore the Aśvins with their hymns of praise?<br> The Ṛṣi Vatsa, Kaṇva's son, hath magnified you with his songs.<br> 9 The holy singer with his hymns hath called you, Aśvins, hither-ward;<br> Best Vṛtra-slayers, free from stain, as such bring us felicity.<br> 10 What time, ye Lords of ample wealth, the Lady mounted on your car,<br> Then, O ye Aśvins, ye attained all wishes that your hearts desired.<br> 11 Come thence, O Aśvins, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments:<br> Vatsa the sage, the sage's son, hath sung a song of sweets to you.<br> 12 Cheerers of many, rich in goods, discoverers of opulence,<br> The Aśvins, Riders through the sky, have welcomed this my song of praise.<br> 13 O Aśvins, grant us all rich gifts wherewith no man mav interfere.<br> Make us observe the stated times: give us not over to reproach.<br> 14 Whether, Nāsatyas, ye be nigh, or whether ye be far away,<br> Come thence, O Aśvins, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments.<br> 15 Vatsa the Ṛṣi with his songs, Nāsatyas, hath exalted you:<br> Grant him rich food distilling oil, graced with a thousand ornaments.<br> 16 Bestow on him, O Aśvins, food that strengthens, and that drops with oil,<br> On him who praises you for bliss, and, Lords of bounty, prays for wealth.<br> 17 Come to us, ye who slay the foe, Lords of rich treasure, to this hymn.<br> O Heroes, give us high renown and these good things of earth for help.<br> 18 The Priyamedhas have invoked you with all succours that are yours,<br> You, Aśvins, Lords of solemn rites, with calls entreating you to come.<br> 19 Come to us, Aśvins, ye Who bring felicity, auspicious Ones,<br> To Vatsa who with prayer and hymn, lovers of song, hath honoured you.<br> 20 Aid us, O Heroes, for those hymns for which ye helped GoSarya erst,<br> Gave Vaśa, Dasavraja aid, and Kaṇva and Medhatithi:<br> 21 And favoured Trasadasyu, ye Heroes, in spoil-deciding fray:<br> For these, O Aśvins, graciously assist us in acquiring strength.<br> 22 O Aśvins, may pure hymns of ours, and songs and praises, honour you:<br> Best slayers everywhere of foes, as such we fondly yearn for you.<br> 23 Three places of the Aśvins, erst concealed, are made apparent now.<br> Both Sages, with the flight of Law come hither unto those who live.</p>
