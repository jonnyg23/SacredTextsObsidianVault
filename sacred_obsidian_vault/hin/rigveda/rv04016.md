 <p>1. IMPETUOUS, true, let Maghavan come hither, and let his Tawny Coursers speed to reach us.<br> For him have we pressed juice exceeding potent: here, praised with song, let him effect his visit.<br> 2 Unyoke, as at thy journey's end, O Hero, to gladden thee today at this libation.<br> Like Uśanā, the priest a laud shall utter, a hymn to thee, the Lord Divine, who markest.<br> 3 When the Bull, quaffing, praises our libation, as a sage paying holy rites in secret,<br> Seven singers here from heaven hath he begotten, who een by day have wrought their works while singing.<br> 4 When heaven's fair light by hymns was made apparent (they made great splendour shine at break of morning),<br> He with his succour, best of Heroes, scattered the blinding darkness so that men saw clearly.<br> 5 Indra, Impetuous One, hath waxed immensely: he with his vastness hath filled earth and heaven.<br> Een beyond this his majesty extendeth who hath exceeded all the worlds in greatness.<br> 6 Śakra who knoweth well all human actions hath with his eager Friends let loose the waters.<br> They with their songs cleft een the mountain open and willingly disclosed the stall of cattle.<br> 7 He smote away the floods' obstructer, Vṛtra; Earth, conscious, lent her aid to speed thy thunder.<br> Thou sentest forth the waters of the ocean, as Lord through power and might, O daring Hero.<br> 8 When, Much-invoked! the water's rock thou cleftest, Saramā showed herself and went before thee.<br> Hymned by Aṅgirases, bursting the cow-stalls, much strength thou foundest for us as our leader.<br> 9 Come, Maghavan, Friend of Man, to aid the singer imploring thee in battle for the sunlight.<br> Speed him with help in his inspired invokings: down sink the sorcerer, the prayerless Dasyu.<br> 10 Come to our home resolved to slay the Dasyu: Kutsa longed eagerly to win thy friendship.<br> Alike in form ye both sate in his dwelling the faithful Lady was in doubt between you.<br> 11 Thou comest, fain to succour him, with Kutsa,a goad that masters both the Wind-God's horses,<br> That, holding the brown steeds like spoil for capture, the sage may on the final day be present.<br> 12 For Kutsa, with thy thousand, thou at day-break didst hurl down greedy Śuṣṇa, foe of harvest.<br> Quickly with Kutsa's friend destroy the Dasyus, and roll the chariot-wheel of Sūrya near us.<br> 13 Thou to the son of Vidathin, Ṛjiśvan, gavest up mighty Mṛgaya and Pipru.<br> Thou smotest down the swarthy fifty thousand, and rentest forts as age consumes a garment.<br> 14 What time thou settest near the Sun thy body, thy form, Immortal One, is seen expanding:<br> Thou a wild elephant with might invested. like a dread lion as thou wieldest weapons.<br> 15 Wishes for wealth have gone to Indra, longing for him in war for light and at libation,<br> Eager for glory, labouring with praisesongs: he is like home, like sweet and fair nutrition.<br> 16 Call we for you that Indra, prompt to listen, him who hath done so much for men's advantage;<br> Who, Lord of envied bounty, to a singer like me brings quickly booty worth the capture.<br> 17 When the sharp-pointed arrow, O thou Hero, flieth mid any conflict of the people,<br> When, Faithful One, the dread encounter cometh, then be thou the Protector of our body.<br> 18 Further the holy thoughts of Vamadeva be thou a guileless Friend in fight for booty.<br> We come to thee whose providence protects us: wide be thy sway for ever for thy singer.<br> 19 O Indra, with these men who love thee truly, free givers, Maghavan, in every battle,<br> May we rejoice through many autumns, quelling our foes, as days subdue the nights with splendour.<br> 20 Now, as the Bhṛgus wrought a car, for Indra the Strong, the Mighty, we our prayer have fashioned,<br> That he may, neer withdraw from us his friendship, but be our bodies' guard and strong defender.<br> 21 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell. high like rivers for the singer.<br> For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays, is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
