 <p>1. CALL we for aid on Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni and the Marut host and Aditi.<br> Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress.<br> 2 Come ye Ādityas for our full prosperity, in conquests of the foe, ye Gods, bring joy to us.<br> Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress.<br> 3 May the most glorious Fathers aid us, and the two Goddesses, Mothers of the Gods, who strengthen Law.<br> Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress.<br> 4 To mighty Narāśaṁsa, strengthening his might, to Pūṣan, ruler over men, we pray with hymns.<br> Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress.<br> 5 Bṛhaspati, make us evermore an easy path: we crave what boon thou hast for men in rest and stir.<br> Like as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress.<br> 6 Sunk in the pit the Ṛṣi Kutsa called, to aid, Indra the Vṛtra-slayer, Lord of power and might.<br> Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress.<br> 7 May Aditi the Goddess guard us with the Gods: may the protecting God keep us with ceaseless care.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
