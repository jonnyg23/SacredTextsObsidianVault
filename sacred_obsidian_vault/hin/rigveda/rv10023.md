 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XXIII. Indra.</h3>  
 <p>1. INDRA, whose right hand wields the bolt, we worship, driver of Bay Steeds seeking sundered courses.<br> Shaking his beard with might he hath arisen, casting his weapons forth and dealing bounties.<br> 2 The treasure which his Bay Steeds found at sacrifice,this wealth made opulent Indra slayer of the foe.<br> Ṛbhu, Ṛbhukṣan, Vāja-he is Lord of Might. The Dāsa's very name I utterly destroy.<br> 3 When, with the Princes, Maghavari, famed of old, comes nigh the thunderbolt of gold, and the Controller's car<br> Which his two Tawny Coursers draw, then Indra is the Sovran Lord of power whose glory spreads afar.<br> 4 With him too is this rain of his that comes like herds: Indra throws drops of moisture on his yellow beard.<br> When the sweet juice is shed he seeks the pleasant place, and stirs the worshipper as wind disturbs the wood.<br> 5 We laud and praise his several deeds of valour who, fatherlike, with power hath made us stronger;<br> Who with his voice slew many thousand wicked ones who spake in varied manners with contemptuous cries.<br> 6 Indra, the Vimadas have formed for thee a laud, copious, unparalleled, for thee Most Bountiful.<br> We know the good we gain from him the Mighty One when we attract him as a herdsman calls the kine.<br> 7 Neer may this bond of friendship be dissevered, the Ṛṣi Vimada's and thine, O Indra.<br> We know thou carest for us as a brother with us, O God, be thine auspicious friendship.</p>
