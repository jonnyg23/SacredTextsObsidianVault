 <p>1. CHEER thee with draughts to win us bliss: Soma, pierce Indra in thy strength.<br> Thou stormest trembling in thy rage, and findest not a foeman nigh.<br> 2 Make our songs penetrate to him who is the Only One of men;<br> For whom the sacred food is spread, as the steer ploughs the barley in.<br> 3 Within whose hands deposited all the Five Peoples treasures rest.<br> Mark thou the man who injures us and kill him like the heavenly bolt.<br> 4 Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee not.<br> Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.<br> 5 Thou helpest him the doubly strong whose hymns were sung unceasingly.<br> When Indra fought, O Soma, thou helpest the mighty in the fray.<br> 6 As thou, O Indra, to the ancient singers wast ever joy, like water to the thirsty,<br> So unto thee I sing this invocation. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
