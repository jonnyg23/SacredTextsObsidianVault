 <p>1. AGNI is set upon the earth well kindled; he standeth in the presence of all beings.<br> Wise, ancient, God, the Priest and Purifier, let Agni serve the Gods for he is worthy.<br> 2 May Narāśaṁsa lighting up the chambers, bright in his majesty through threefold heaven,<br> Steeping the gift with oil diffusing purpose, bedew the Gods at chiefest time of worship.<br> 3 Adored in heart, as is thy right, O Agni, serve the Gods first to-day before the mortal.<br> Bring thou the Marut host. Ye men do worship to Indra seated on the grass, eternal.<br> 4 O Grass divine, increasing, rich in heroes, strewn for <a href="errata.htm#9">wealth's</a> sake, well laid upon this altar,<br> On this bedewed with oil sit ye, O Vasus, sit all ye Gods, ye Holy, ye Ādityas.<br> 5 Wide be the Doors, the Goddesses, thrown open, easy to pass, invoked, through adorations,<br> Let them unfold, expansive, everlasting, that sanctify the class famed, rich in heroes.<br> 6 Good work for us, the glorious Night and Morning, like female weavers, waxen from aforetime,<br> Yielders of rich milk, interweave in concert the long-extended thread, the web of worship.<br> 7 Let the two heavenly Heralds, first, most wise, most fair, present oblation duly with the sacred verse,<br> Worshipping God at ordered seasons decking them at three high places at the centre of the earth.<br> 8 Sarasvatī who perfects our devotion, Iḷā divine, Bhāratī all surpassing,<br> Three Goddesses, with power inherent, seated, protect this holy Grass, our flawless refuge!<br> 9 Born is the pious hero swift of hearing, like gold in hue, well formed, and full of vigour.<br> May Tvaṣṭar lengthen our line and kindred, and may they reach the place which Gods inhabit.<br> 10 Vanaspati shall stand anear and start us, and Agni with his arts prepare oblation.<br> Let the skilled heavenly Immolator forward unto the Gods the offering thrice anointed.<br> 11 Oil has been mixt: oil is his habitation. In oil he rests: oil is his proper province.<br> Come as thy wont is: O thou Steer, rejoice thee; bear off the oblation duly consecrated.</p>
