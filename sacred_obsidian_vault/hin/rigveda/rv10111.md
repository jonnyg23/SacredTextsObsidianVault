 <p>1. BRING forth your sacred song ye prudent singers, even as are the thoughts of human beings.<br> Let us draw Indra with true deeds anear us: he loves our songs, the Hero, and is potent.<br> 2 The hymn shone brightly from the seat of worship: to the kine came the Bull, the Heifer's Offipring<br> With mighty bellowing hath he arisen, and hath pervaded even the spacious regions.<br> 3 Indra knows, verily, how to hear our singing, for he, victorious, made a path for Sūrya.<br> He made the Cow, and be became the Sovran of Heaven, primeval, matchless, and unshaken.<br> 4 Praised by Aṅgirases, Indra demolished with might the works of the great watery monster<br> Full many regions, too, hath he pervaded, and by his truth supported earth's foundation.<br> 5 The counterpart of heaven and earth is Indra: he knoweth all libations, slayeth Śuṣṇa.<br> The vast sky with the Sun hath he extended, and, best otpillars, stayed it with a pillar.<br> 6 The Vṛtra-slaver with his bolt felled Vṛtra: the magic of the godless, waxen mighty,<br> Here hast thou, Bold Assailant, boldly conquered. Yea, then thine arms, O Maghavan, were potent.<br> 7 When the Dawns come attendant upon Sūrya their rays discover wealth of divers colours.<br> The Star of heaven is seen as twere approaching: none knoweth aught of it as it departeth.<br> 8 Far have they gone, the first of all these waters, the waters that flowed forth when Indra sent them.<br> Where is their spring, and where is their foundation? Where now, ye Waters, is your inmost centre?<br> 9 Thou didst free rivers swallowed by the Dragon; and rapidly they set themselves in motion,<br> Those that were loosed and those that longed for freedom. Excited now to speed they run unresting.<br> 10 Yearning together they have sped to Sindhu: the Fort-destroyer, praised, of old, hath loved them.<br> Indra, may thy terrestrial treasures reach us, and our full songs of joy approach thy dwelling.</p>
