 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN LVII. Indra.</h3>  
 <p>1 To him most liberal, lofty Lord of lofty wealth, verily powerful and strong, I bring my hymn,<br> Whose checkless bounty, as of waters down a slope, is spread abroad for all that live, to give them strength.<br> 2 Now all this world, for worship, shall come after theethe offerer's libations like floods to the depth,<br> When the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thunderbolt of Indra, shatterer wrought of gold.<br> 3 To him the terrible, most meet for lofty praise, like bright Dawn, now bring gifts with reverence in this rite,<br> Whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been created, like bay steeds, to move with speed.<br> 4 Thine, Indra, praised by many, excellently rich! are we who trusting in thy help draw near to thee.<br> Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as earth loves all her creatures, love thou this our hymn.<br> 5 Great is thy power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil, O Maghavan, the wish of this thy worshipper.<br> After thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength: to thee and to thy power this earth hath bowed itself.<br> 6 Thou, who hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast shattered into pieces this broad massive cloud.<br> Thou hast sent down the obstructed floods that they may flow: thou hast, thine own for ever, all victorious might.</p>
