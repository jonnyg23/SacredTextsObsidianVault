 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XL. Brahmaṇaspati</h3>  
 <p>1 O BRAHMAṆASPATI, stand up: God-serving men we pray to thee.<br> May they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra, most swift, be thou with them.<br> 2 O Son of Strength, each mortal calls to thee for aid when spoil of battle waits for him.<br> O Maruts, may this man who loves you well obtain wealth of good steeds and hero might.<br> 3 May Brahmaṇaspati draw nigh, may Sūnṛtā the Goddess come,<br> And Gods bring to this rite which gives the five-fold gift the Hero, lover of mankind.<br> 4 He who bestows a noble guerdon on the priest wins fame that never shall decay.<br> For him we offer sacred hero-giving food, peerless and conquering easily.<br> 5 Now Brahmaṇaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn of praise,<br> Wherein Indra and Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, the Gods, have made their dwelling place.<br> 6 May we in holy synods, Gods! recite that hymn, peerless, that brings felicity.<br> If you, O Heroes, graciously accept this word, may it obtain all bliss from you.<br> 7 Who shall approach the pious? who the man whose sacred grass is trimmed?<br> The offerer with his folk advances more and more: he fills his house with precious things.<br> 8 He amplifies his lordly might, with kings he slays: een mid alarms he dwells secure<br> In great or lesser fight none checks him, none subdues,the wielder of the thunderbolt.</p>
