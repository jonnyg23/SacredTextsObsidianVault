 <p>1. WELL knowing I have bound me, horselike, to the pole: I carry that which bears as on and gives us help.<br> I seek for no release, no turning back therefrom. May he who knows the way, the Leader, guide me straight.<br> 2 O Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, and Mitra, give, O ye Gods, and Marut host, and Viṣṇu.<br> May both Nāsatyas, Rudra, heavenly Matrons, Pūṣan, Sarasvatī, Bhaga, accept us.<br> 3 Indra and Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aditi, the Waters, Mountains, Maruts, Sky, and Earth and Heaven,<br> Viṣṇu I call, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, and Bhaga, Samsa, Savitar that they may help.<br> 4 May Viṣṇu also and Vāta who injures none, and Soma granter of possessions give us joy;<br> And may the Ṛbhus and the Aśvins, Tvaṣṭar and Vibhvan remember us so that we may have wealth.<br> 5 So may the band of Maruts dwelling in the sky, the holy, come to us to sit on sacred grass;<br> Bṛhaspati and Pūṣan grant us sure defence, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman guard and shelter us.<br> 6 And may the Mountains famed in noble eulogies, and the fair-gleaming Rivers keep us safe from harm.<br> May Bhaga the Dispenser come with power and grace, and far-pervading Aditi listen to my call.<br> 7 May the Gods Spouses aid us of their own freewill, aid us to offspring and the winning of the spoil.<br> Grant us protection, O ye gracious Goddesses, ye who are on the earth or in the waters' realm.<br> 8 May the Dames, wives of Gods, enjoy our presents, Rat, Aśvini, Agnāyī, and Indrāṇī.<br> May Rodasī and Varuṇānī hear us, and Goddesses come at the Matrons' season.</p>
