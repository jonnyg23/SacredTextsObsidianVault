 <p>1. AT dawn let Agni, much-beloved guest of the house, be glorified;<br> Immortal who delights in all oblations brought by mortal men.<br> 2 For Dvita who receives through wealth of native strength maimed offerings,<br> Thy praiser even gains at once the Soma-drops, Immortal Gods!<br> 3 Nobles, with song I call that car of yours that shines with lengthened life,<br> For, God who givest steeds! that car hither and thither goes unharmed.<br> 4 They who have varied ways of thought, who guard the lauds within their lips,<br> And strew the grass before the light, have decked themselves with high renown.<br> 5 Immortal Agni, give the chiefs, heroes who institute the rite,<br> Heroes illustrious, lofty fame, who at the synod met for praise presented me with fifty steeds.</p>
