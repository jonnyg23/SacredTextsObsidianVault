 <p>1. FOR thee this Soma is effused, O Indra: drink of this juice; for thee the stream is flowing-<br> Soma, which thou thyself hast made and chosen, even Indu, for thy special drink to cheer thee.<br> 2 Like a capacious car hath it been harnessed, the Mighty; to acquire abundant treasures.<br> Then in the sacrifice they celebrated all triumphs won by Nahus -n the battle.<br> 3 Like Vāyu with his team, moving at pleasure, most gracious when invoked like both Nāsatyas,<br> Thou art thyself like the Wealth-Giver, Soma! who grants all boons, like song-inspiring Pūṣan.<br> 4 Like Indra who hath done great deeds, thou, Soma, art slayer of the Vṛtras, Fort-destroyer.<br> Like Pedu's horse who killed the brood of serpents, thus thou, O Soma, slayest every Dasyu.<br> 5 Like Agni loosed amid the forest, fiercely he winneth splendour in the running waters.<br> Like one who fights, the roaring of the mighty, thus Soma Pavamana sends his current.<br> 6 These Somas passing through the fleecy filter, like rain descending from the clouds of heaven,<br> Have been effused and poured into the beakers, swiftly like rivers running lowly seaward.<br> 7 Flow onward like the potent band of Maruts, like that Celestial Host whom none revileth.<br> Quickly be gracious unto us like waters, like sacrifice victorious, thousand-fashioned.<br> 8 Thine are King Varuṇa's eternal statutes, lofty and deep, O Soma, is thy glory.<br> All-pure art thou like Mitra the beloved, adorable, like Aryaman, O Soma.</p>
