 <p>1. TEN sisters, pouring out the rain together, swift-moving thinkers of the sage, adorn him.<br> Hither hath run the gold-hued Child of Sūrya and reached the vat like a fleet vigorous courser.<br> 2 Even as a youngling crying to his mothers, the bounteous Steer hath flowed along to waters.<br> As youth to damsel, so with milk he hastens on to the. chose meeting-place, the beaker.<br> 3 Yea, swollen is the udder of the milch-cow: thither in streams goes very sapient Indu.<br> The kine make ready, as with new-washed treasures, the Head and Chief with milk within the vessels.<br> 4 With all the Gods, O Indu Pavamana, while thou art roaring send us wealth in horses.<br> Hither upon her car come willing Plenty, inclined to us, to give us of her treasures.<br> 5 Now unto us mete riches, while they cleansethee, all-glorious, swelling wealth, with store of heroes.<br> Long be his life who worships, thee, O Indu. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.</p>
