 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN III. Agni.</h3>  
 <p>1. TRUE, guardian of the Law, thy faithful servant wins ample light and dwells in peace, O Agni,<br> Whom thou, as Varuṇa in accord with Mitra, guardest, O God, by banishing his trouble.<br> 2 He hath paid sacrifices, toiled in worship, and offered gifts to wealth-increasing Agni.<br> Him the displeasure of the famous moves not, outrage and scorn affect not such a mortal.<br> 3 Bright God, whose look is free from stain like Sūrya's, thou, swift, what time thou earnestly desirest,<br> Hast gear to give us. Come with joy at evening, where, Child of Wood, thou mayest also tarry.<br> 4 Fierce is his gait and vast his wondrous body: he champeth like a horse with bit and bridle,<br> And, darting forth his tongue, as twere a hatchet, burning the woods, smelteth them like a smelter.<br> 5 Archer-like, fain toshoot, he sets his arrow, and whets his splendour like the edge of iron:<br> The messenger of night with brilliant pathway, like a tree-roosting bird of rapid pinion.<br> 6 In beams of morn he clothes him like the singer, and bright as Mitra with his splendour crackles.<br> Red in the night, by day the men's possession: red, he belongs to men by day, Immortal.<br> 7 Like Heaven's when scattering beams his voice was uttered: among the plants the radiant Hero shouted,<br> Who with his glow in rapid course came hither to fill both worlds, well-wedded Dames, with treasure.<br> 8 Who, with supporting streams and rays that suit him, hath flashed like lightning with his native vigour.<br> Like the deft Maker of the band of Maruts, the bright impetuous One hath shone refulgent.</p>
