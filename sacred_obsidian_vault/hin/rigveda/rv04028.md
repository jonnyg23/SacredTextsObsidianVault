 <p>1. ALLIED with thee, in this thy friendship, Soma, Indra for man made waters flow together,<br> Slew Ahi, and sent forth the Seven Rivers, and opened as it were obstructed fountains.<br> 2 Indu, with thee for his confederate, Indra swiftly with might pressed down the wheel of Sūrya.<br> What rolled, all life's support, on heaven's high summit was separated from the great oppressor.<br> 3 Indra smote down, Agni consumed, O Indu, the Dasyus ere the noontide in the conflict.<br> Of those who gladly sought a hard-won dwelling he cast down many a thousand with his arrow.<br> 4 Lower than all besides hast thou, O Indra, cast down the Dasyus, abject tribes of Dāsas.<br> Ye drave away, ye put to death the foemen, and took great vengeance with your murdering weapons.<br> 5 So, of a truth, Indra and Soma, Heroes, ye burst the stable of the kine and horses,<br> The stable which the bar or stone obstructed; and piercing through set free the habitations.</p>
