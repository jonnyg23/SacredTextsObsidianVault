 <p>1. AT Jātavedas' holy gathering I will tell aloud the conquering might of the swift red-hued Steer.<br> A pure and fresher hymn flows to Vaiśvānara, even as for Agni lovely Soma is made pure.<br> 2 That Agni, when in loftiest heaven he sprang to life, Guardian of Holy Laws, kept and observed them well.<br> Exceeding wise, he measured out the firmament. Vaiśvānara attained to heaven by mightiness.<br> 3 Wonderful Mitra propped the heaven and earth apart, and covered and concealed<br> the darkness with his light.<br> He made the two bowls part asunder like two skins. Vaiśvānara put forth all his creative power.<br> 4 The Migbty seized him in the bosom of the floods: the people waited on the King who should be praised.<br> As envoy of Vivasvān MatariSvan brought Agni Vaiśvānara hither from far away.<br> 5 In every age bestow upon the singers wealth, worthy of holy synods, glorious, ever new.<br> King, undecaying, as it were with sharpened bolt, smite down the sinner like a tree with lightning-flash.<br> 6 Do thou bestow, O Agni, on our wealthy chiefs, rule, with good heroes, undecaying, bending not.<br> So may we win for us strength. O Vaiśvānara, hundredfold, thousandfold, O Agni, by thy help.<br> 7 O thou who dwellest in three places, Helper, keep with effective guards our princely patrons.<br> Keep our band, Agni, who have brought thee presents. Lengthen their lives, Vaiśvānara, when lauded.</p>
