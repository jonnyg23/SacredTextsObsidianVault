 <p>1. COME thou to what the stones have pressed, drink Soma, O thou Soma's Lord,<br> Indra best Vṛtra-slayer Strong One, with the Strong.<br> 2 Strong is the stone, the draught is strong, strong is this Soma that is pressed,<br> Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong.<br> 3 As strong I call on thee the Strong, O Thunder-armed, with various aids,<br> Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong.<br> 4 Impetuous, Thunderer, Strong, quelling the mighty, King, potent, Vṛtra-slayer, Soma-drinker,<br> May he come hither with his yoked Bay Horses; may Indra gladden him at the noon libation.<br> 5 O Sūrya, when the Asura's descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness,<br> All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing.<br> 6 What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu's magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra,<br> By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function.<br> 7 Let not the oppressor with this dread, through anger swallow me up, for I am thine, O Atri.<br> Mitra art thou, the sender of true blessings: thou and King Varuṇa be both my helpers.<br> 8 The Brahman Atri, as he set the press-stones, serving the Gods with praise and adoration,<br> Established in the heaven the eye of Sūrya, and caused Svarbhanu's magic arts to vanish.<br> 9 The Atris found the Sun again, him whom Svarbhanu of the brood<br> Of Asuras had pierced with gloom. This none besides had power to do.</p>
