 <p>1. WISE, verily, are creatures through his greatness who stayed ever, spacious heaven and earth asunder;<br> Who urged the high and mighty sky to motion, the Star of old, and spread the earth before him.<br> 2 With mine own heart I commune on the question how Varuṇa and I may be united.<br> What gift of mine will he accept unangered? When may I calmly look and find him gracious?<br> 3 Fain to know this is my sin I question others: I seek the wise, O Varuṇa, and ask them.<br> This one same answer even the sages gave me, "Surely this Varuṇa is angry with thee."<br> 4 What, Varuṇa, hath been my chief transgression, that thou wouldst slay the friend who sings thy praises?<br> Tell me, Unconquerable Lord, and quickly sinless will I approach thee with mine homage.<br> 5 Free us from sins committed by our fathers, from those wherein we have ourselves offended.<br> O King, loose, like a thief who feeds the cattle, as from the cord a calf, set free Vasiṣṭha.<br> 6 Not our own will betrayed us, but seduction, thoughtlessness, Varuṇa wine, dice, or anger.<br> The old is near to lead astray the younger: even sleep removeth not all evil-doing.<br> 7 Slavelike may I do service to the Bounteous, serve, free from sin, the God inclined to anger.<br> This gentle Lord gives wisdom to the simple: the wiser God leads on the wise to riches.<br> 8 O Lord, O Varuṇa, may this laudation come close to thee and lie within thy spirit.<br> May it be well with us in rest and labour. Preserve us ever-more, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
