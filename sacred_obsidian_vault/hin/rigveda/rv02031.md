 <p>1. HELP, Varuṇa and Mitra, O ye Twain allied with Vasus, Rudras, and Ādityas, help our car,<br> That, as the wild birds of the forest from their home, our horses may fly forth, glad, eager for renown.<br> 2 Yea, now ye Gods of one accord speed on our car what time among the folk it seeks an act of might;<br> When, hasting through the region with the stamp of hoofs, our swift steeds trample on the ridges of the earth.<br> 3 Or may our Indra here, the Friend of all mankind, coming from heaven, most wise, girt by the Marut host,<br> Accompany, with aid untroubled by a foe, our car to mighty gain, to win the meed of strength.<br> 4 Or may this Tvaṣṭar, God who rules the world with power, one-minded with the Goddesses speed forth our car;<br> Iḷā and Bhaga the celestial, Earth and Heaven, Pūṣan, Purandhi, and the Aśvins, ruling Lords.<br> 5 Or, seen alternate, those two blessed Goddesses, Morning and Night who stir all living things to act:<br> While with my newest song I praise you both, O Earth, that from what moves not ye may spread forth threefold food.<br> 6 Your blessing as a boon for suppliants we desire: the Dragon of the Deep, and Aja-Ekapād,<br> Trita, Ṛbhukṣan, Savitar shall joy in us, and the Floods swift Child in our worship and our prayer.<br> 7 These earnest prayers I pray to you, ye Holy: to pay you honour, living men have formed them,<br> Men fain to win the prize and glory. May they win, as a car-horse might the goal, your notice.</p>
