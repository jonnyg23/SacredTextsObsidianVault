 <p>1. WHAT Mātariśvan, piercing, formed by friction, Herald of all the Gods. in varied figure,<br> Is he whom they have set mid human houses, gay-hued as light and shining forth for beauty.<br> 2 They shall not harm the man who brings thee praises: such as I am, Agni my help approves me.<br> All acts of mine shall they accept with pleasure, laudation from the singer who presents it.<br> 3 Him in his constant seat men skilled in worship have taken and with praises have established.<br> As, harnessed to a chariot fleet-foot horses, at his command let bearers lead him forward.<br> 4 Wondrous, full many a thing he chews and crunches: he shines amid the wood with spreading brightness.<br> Upon his glowing flames the wind blows daily, driving them like the keen shaft of an archer.<br> 5 Him, whom while yet in embryo the hostile, both skilled and fain to harm, may never injure,<br> Men blind and sightless through his splendour hurt not: his never-failing lovers have preserved him.</p>
