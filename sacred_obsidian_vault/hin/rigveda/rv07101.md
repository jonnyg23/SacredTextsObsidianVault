 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN CI. Parjanya.</h3>  
 <p>1 SPEAK forth three words, the words which light precedeth, which milk this udder that produceth nectar.<br> Quickly made manifest, the Bull hath bellowed, engendering the germ of plants, the Infant.<br> 2 Giver of growth to plants, the God who ruleth over the waters and all moving creatures,<br> Vouchsafe us triple shelter for our refuge, and threefold light to succour and befriend us.<br> 3 Now he is sterile, now begetteth offspring, even as he willeth doth he change his figure.<br> The Father's genial flow bedews the Mother; therewith the Sire, therewith the son is nourished.<br> 4 In him all living creatures have their being, and the three heavens with triply-flowing waters.<br> Three reservoirs that sprinkle down their treasure shed their sweet streams around him with a murmur.<br> 5 May this my song to Sovran Lord Parjanya come near unto his heart and give him pleasure.<br> May we obtain the showers that bring enjoyment, and God-protected plants with goodly fruitage.<br> 6 He is the Bull of all, and their impregner: he holds the life of all things fixed and moving.<br> May this rite save me till my hundredth autumn. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
