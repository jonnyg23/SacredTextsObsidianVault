 <p>1. Now must we praise and honour Savitar the God: at this time of the day the men must call to him,<br> Him who distributes wealth to Manu's progeny, that he may grant us here riches most excellent.<br> 2 For thou at first producest for the holy Gods the noblest of all portions, immortality:<br> Thereafter as a gift to men, O Savitar, thou openest existence, life succeeding life.<br> 3 If we, men as we are, have sinned against the Gods through want of thought, in weakness, or through insolence,<br> Absolve us from the guilt and make us free from sin, O Savitar, alike among both Gods and men.<br> 4 None may impede that power of Savitar the God whereby he will maintain the universal world.<br> What the fair-fingered God brings forth on earth's expanse or in the height of heaven, that work of his stands sure.<br> 5 To lofty hills thou sendest those whom Indra leads, and givest fixed abodes with houses unto these.<br> However they may fly and draw themselves apart, still, Savitar, they stand obeying thy behest.<br> 6 May the libations poured to thee thrice daily, day after day, O Savitar, bring us blessing.<br> May Indra, Heaven, Earth, Sindhu with the Waters, Aditi with Ādityas, give us shelter.</p>
