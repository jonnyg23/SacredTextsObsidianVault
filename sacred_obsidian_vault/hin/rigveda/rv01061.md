 <p>1 EVEN to him, swift, strong and high. exalted, I bring my song of praise as dainty viands,<br> My thought to him resistless, praise-deserving, prayers offered most especially to Indra.<br> 2 Praise, like oblation, I present, and utter aloud my song, my fair hymn to the Victor.<br> For Indra, who is Lord of old, the singers have decked their lauds with heart and mind and spirit.<br> 3 To him then with my lips mine adoration, winning heaven's light, most excellent, I offer,<br> To magnify with songs of invocation and with fair hymns the Lord, most bounteous Giver.<br> 4 Even for him I frame a laud, as fashions the wright a chariot for the man who needs it,<br> Praises to him who gladly hears our praises, a hymn well-formed, all-moving, to wise Indra.<br> 5 So with my tongue I deck, to please that Indra, my hymn, as twere a horse, through love of glory,<br> To reverence the Hero, bounteous Giver, famed far and wide, destroyer of the castles.<br> 6 Even for him hath Tvaṣṭar forged the thunder, most deftly wrought, celestial, for the battle,<br> Wherewith he reached the vital parts of Vṛtra, striking-the vast, the mighty with the striker.<br> 7 As soon as, at libations of his mother, great Viṣṇu had drunk up the draught, he plundered.<br> The dainty cates, the cooked mess; but One stronger transfixed the wild boar, shooting through the mountain.<br> 8 To him, to Indra, when he slew the Dragon, the Dames, too, Consorts of the Gods, wove praises.<br> The mighty heaven and earth hath he encompassed: thy greatness heaven and earth, combined, exceed not.<br> 9 Yea, of a truth, his magnitude surpasseth the magnitude of earth, mid-air, and heaven.<br> Indra, approved by all men, self-resplendent, waxed in his home, loud-voiced and strong for battle.<br> 10 Through his own strength Indra with bolt of thunder cut piece-meal Vṛtra, drier up of waters.<br> He let the floods go free, like cows imprisoned, for glory, with a heart inclined to bounty.<br> 11 The rivers played, through his impetuous splendour, since with his bolt he compassed them on all sides.<br> Using his might and favouring him who worshipped, he made a ford, victorious, for Turvīti.<br> 12 Vast, with thine ample power, with eager movement, against this Vṛtra cast thy bolt of thunder.<br> Rend thou his joints, as of an ox, dissevered, with bolt oblique, that floods of rain may follow.<br> 13 Sing with new lauds his exploits wrought aforetime, the deeds of him, yea, him who moveth swiftly,<br> When, hurling forth his weapons in the battle, he with impetuous wrath lays low the foemen.<br> 14 When he, yea, he, comes forth the firm. Set mountains and the whole heaven and earth, tremble for terror.<br> May Nodhas, ever praising the protection of that dear Friend, gain quickly strength heroic.<br> 15 Now unto him of these things hath been given what he who rules alone oer much, electeth.<br> Indra hath helped Etaśa, Soma-presser, contending in the race of steeds with Sūrya.<br> 16 Thus to thee, Indra, yoker of Bay Coursers, the Gotamas have brought their prayers to please thee.<br> Bestow upon them thought, decked with all beauty. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.</p>
