 <p>1. THE Ancient's Milch-cow yields the things we long for: the Son of Dakṣiṇā travels between them.<br> She with the splendid chariot brings refulgence. The praise of Uṣas hath awoke the Aśvins.<br> 2 They bear you hither by well-orderd statute: our sacred offerings rise as if to parents.<br> Destroy in us the counsel of the niggard come hitherward, for we have shown you favour.<br> 3 With lightly-rolling car and well-yoked horses hear this, the press-stone's song, ye Wonder-Workers.<br> Have not the sages of old time, ye Aśvins, called you most prompt to come and stay misfortune?<br> 4 Remember us, and come to us, for ever men, as their wont is, invocate the Aśvins.<br> Friends as it were have offered you these juices, sweet, blent with milk at the first break of morning.<br> 5 Even through many regions, O ye Aśvins high praise is yours among mankind, ye Mighty-<br> Come, helpers, on the paths which Gods have travelled: here your libations of sweet meath are ready.<br> 6 Ancient your home, auspicious is your friendship: Heroes, your wealth is with the house of Jahnu.<br> Forming again with you auspicious friendship, let us rejoice with draughts of meath together.<br> 7 O Aśvins, Very Mighty ones, with Vāyu and with his steeds, one-minded, ever-youthful,<br> Nāsatyas, joying in the third day's Soma, drink it, not hostile, Very Bounteous Givers.<br> 8 Aśvins, to you are brought abundant viands in rivalry with sacred songs, unceasing.<br> Sprung from high Law your car, urged on by press-stones, goes round the earth and heaven in one brief moment.<br> 9 Aśvins, your Soma sheds delicious sweetness: drink ye thereof and come unto our dwelling.<br> Your car, assuming many a shape, most often goes to the Soma-presser's place of meeting.</p>
