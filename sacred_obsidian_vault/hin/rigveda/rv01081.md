 <p>1. THE men have lifted Indra up, the Vṛtra slayer, to joy and strength:<br> Him, verily, we invocate in battles whether great or small: be he our aid in deeds of might.<br> 2 Thou, Hero, art a warrior, thou art giver of abundant spoil.<br> Strengthening een the feeble, thou aidest the sacrificer, thou givest the offerer ample wealth.<br> 3 When war and battles are on foot, booty is laid before the bold.<br> Yoke thou thy wildly-rushing Bays. Whom wilt thou slay and whom enrich? Do thou, O Indra, make us rich.<br> 4 Mighty through wisdom, as he lists, terrible, he hath waxed in strength.<br> Lord of Bay Steeds, strong-jawed, sublime, he in joined hands for glory's sake hath grasped his iron thunderbolt.<br> 5 He filled the earthly atmosphere and pressed against the lights in heaven.<br> None like thee ever hath been born, none, Indra, will be born like thee. Thou hast waxed mighty over all.<br> 6 May he who to the offerer gives the foeman's man-sustaining food,<br> May Indra lend his aid to us. Deal forthabundant is thy wealththat in thy bounty I may share.<br> 7 He, righteous-hearted, at each time of rapture gives us herds of kine.<br> Gather in both thy hands for us treasures of many hundred sorts. Sharpen thou us, and bring us wealth.<br> 8 Refresh thee, Hero, with the juice outpoured for bounty and for strength.<br> We know thee Lord of ample store, to thee have sent our hearts' desires: be therefore our Protector thou.<br> 9 These people, Indra, keep for thee all that is worthy of thy choice.<br> Discover thou, as Lord, the wealth of men who offer up no gifts: bring thou to us this wealth of theirs.</p>
