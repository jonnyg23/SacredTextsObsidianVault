 <p>1. THEE Agni, God, Imperial Lord of all mankind, do mortal men<br> With understanding kindle at the sacrifice.<br> 2 They laud thee in their solemn rites, Agni, as Minister and Priest,<br> Shine forth in thine own home as guardian of the Law.<br> 3 He, verily, who honours thee with fuel, Knower of all life,<br> He, Agni! wins heroic might, he prospers well.<br> 4 Ensign of sacrifices, he, Agni, with Gods is come to us,<br> Decked by the seven priests, to him who bringeth gifts.<br> 5 To Agni, the Invoking Priest, offer your best, your lofty speech,<br> To him Ordainer-like who brings the light of songs.<br> 6 Let these our hymns make Agni grow, whence, meet for laud, he springs to life,<br> To mighty strength and great possession, fair to see.<br> 7 Best Sacrificer, bring the Gods, O Agni, to the pious man:<br> A joyful Priest, thy splendour drive our foes afar<br> 8 As such, O Purifier, shine on us heroic glorious might:<br> Be nearest Friend to those who laud thee, for their weal.<br> 9 So, wakeful, versed in sacred hymns, the holy singers kindly thee.<br> Oblation-bearer, deathless, cherisher of strength.</p>
