 <p>1. RESPLENDENT with thy wide-extending lustre, dispel the terrors of the fiends who hate us<br> May lofty Agni be my guide and shelter, the easily-invoked, the good Protector.<br> 2 Be thou To us, while now the morn is breaking, be thou a guardian when the Sun hath mounted..<br> Accept, as men accept a true-born infant, my laud, O Agni nobly born in body.<br> 3 Bull, who beholdest men, through many mornings, among the dark ones shine forth red, O Agni.<br> Lead us, good Lord, and bear us over trouble: Help us who long, Most Youthful God, to riches.<br> 4 Shine forth, a Bull invincible, O Agni, winning by conquest all the forts and treasures,<br> Thou Jātavedas who art skilled in guiding, the chief high saving sacrifice's Leader.<br> 5 Lighting Gods hither, Agni, wisest Singer, bring thou to us many and flawless shelters.<br> Bring vigour, like a car that gathers booty: bring us, O Agni, beauteous Earth and Heaven.<br> 6 Swell, O thou Bull and give those powers an impulse, een Earth and Heaven who yield their milk in plenty,<br> Shining, O God, with Gods in clear effulgence. Let not a mortal's evil will obstruct us.<br> 7 Agni, as holy food to thine invoker, give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels.<br> To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-ward.</p>
