 <p>1. YE Twain are wondrous strong, well-skilled in arts that heal, both bringers of delight, ye both won Dakṣa's praise.<br> Viśvaka calls on you as such to save his life. Break ye not off our friendship, come and set me free.<br> 2 How shall he praise you now who is distraught in mind? Ye Twain give wisdom for the gainof what is good.<br> Viśvaka calls on you as such to save his life. Break ye not off our friendship, come and set me free.<br> 3 Already have ye Twain, possessors of great wealth, prospered Viṣṇāpū thus for gain of what is good.<br> Viśvaka calls on you as such to save his life. Break ye not off our friendship, come and set me free.<br> 4 And that Impetuous Hero, winner of the spoil, though he is far away, we call to succour us,<br> Whose gracious favour, like a father's, is most sweet. Break ye not off our friendship, come and set me free.<br> 5 About the holy Law toils Savitar the God the horn of holy Law hath he spread far and wide.<br> The holy Law hath quelled even mighty men of war. Break ye not off our ftiendship, come and act me free.</p>
