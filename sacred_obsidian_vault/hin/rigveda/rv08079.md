 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN LXXIX. Indra.</h3>  
 <p>1. MAY Indra, who in every fight must be invoked, be near to us.<br> May the most mighty Vṛtra-slayer, meet for praise, come to libations and to hymns.<br> 2 Thou art the best of all in sending bounteous gifts, true art thou, lordly in thine act.<br> We claim alliance with the very Glorious One, yea, with the Mighty Son of Strength.<br> 3 Prayers unsurpassed are offered up to thee the Lover of the Song.<br> Indra, Lord of Bay Steeds, accept these fitting hymns, hymns which we have thought out for thee.<br> 4 For thou, O Maghavan, art truthful, neer subdued and bringest many a Vṛtra low.<br> As such, O Mightiest Lord, Wielder of Thunder, send wealth hither to the worshipper.<br> 5 O Indra, thou art far-renowned, impetuous, O Lord of Strength.<br> Alone thou slayest with the guardian of mankind resistless never-conquered foes.<br> 6 As such we seek thee now, O Asura, thee most wise, craving thy bounty as our share.<br> Thy sheltering defence is like a mighty cloak. So may thy glories reach to us.</p>
