 <p>1. IN the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all created beings.<br> He fixed and holdeth up this earth and heaven. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 2 Giver of vital breath, of power and vigour, he whose commandments all the Gods acknowledge -.<br> The Lord of death, whose shade is life immortal. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 3 Who by his grandeur hath become Sole Ruler of all the moving world that breathes and slumbers;<br> He who is Loord of men and Lord of cattle. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 4 His, through his might, are these snow-covered mountains, and men call sea and Rasā his possession:<br> His arms are these, his are these heavenly regions. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 5 By him the heavens are strong and earth is stedfast, by him light's realm and sky-vault are supported:<br> By him the regions in mid-air were measured. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 6 To him, supported by his help, two armies embattled look while trembling in their spirit,<br> When over them the risen Sun is shining. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 7 What time the mighty waters came, containing the universal germ, producing Agni,<br> Thence sprang the Gods one spirit into being. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 8 He in his might surveyed the floods containing productive force and generating Worship.<br> He is the God of gods, and none beside him. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 9 Neer may he harm us who is earth's Begetter, nor he whose laws are sure, the heavens' Creator,<br> He who brought forth the great and lucid waters. What God shall we adore with our oblation?<br> 10 Prajāpati! thou only comprehendest all these created things, and none beside thee.<br> Grant us our hearts' desire when we invoke thee: may we have store of riches in possession.</p>
