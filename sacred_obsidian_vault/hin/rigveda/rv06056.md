 <p>1. WHOSO remembers Pūṣan as cater of mingled curd and meal<br> Need think no more upon the God.<br> 2 And he is best of charioteers. Indra, the hero's Lord, allied<br> With him as Friend, destroys the foes.<br> 3 And there the best of charioteers hath guided through the speckled cloud<br> The golden wheel of Sūra's car.<br> 4 Whateer we speak this day to thee, Wise, Wondrous God whom many praise,<br> Give thou fulfilment of our thought.<br> 5 Lead on this company of ours, that longs for kine, to win the spoil:<br> Thou, Pūṣan, art renowned afar.<br> 6 Prosperity we crave from thee, afar from sin and near to wealth,<br> Tending to perfect happiness both for to. morrow and to-day.</p>
