 <p>1. ENJOY, O Agni, this my Fuel, welcome the oil-filled ladle where we pour libation.<br> Rise up for worship of the Gods, wise Agni, on the earth's height, while days are bright with beauty.<br> 2 May he who goes before the Gods come hither with steeds whose shapes are varied, Narasarhsa.<br> May he, most Godlike, speed our offered viands with homage God-ward on the path of Order.<br> 3 Men with oblations laud most constant Agni, and pray him to perform an envoy's duty.<br> With lightly-rolling car and best draught-horses, bring the Gods hither and sit down as Hotar.<br> 4 May the delight of Gods spread out transversely: may it be with us long in length and fragrant.<br> O Holy Grass divine, with friendly spirit bring thou the willing Gods whose Chief is Indra.<br> 5 Touch ye the far-extending height of heaven or spring apart to suit the wide earth's measure.<br> Yearning, ye Doors, with those sublime in greatness, seize eagerly the heavenly Car that cometh.<br> 6 Here in this shrine may Dawn and Night, the Daughters of Heaven, the skilful Goddesses, be seated.<br> In your wide lap, auspicious, willing Ladies may the Gods seat them with a willing spirit.<br> 7 Up stands the stone, high burns the fire enkindled: Aditi's lap contains the Friendly Natures<br> Ye Two Chief Priests who serve at this our worship, may ye, more skilled, win for us rich possessions.<br> 8 On our wide grass, Three Goddesses be seated: for you have we prepared and made it pleasant.<br> May Iḷā, she whose foot drops oil, the Goddess, taste, man-like, sacrifice and well-set presents.<br> 9 Since thou, God Tvaṣṭar, hast made beauty perfect, since hou hast been the Aṅgirases' Companion,<br> Willing, most wealthy, Giver of possessions, grant us the Gods assembly, thou who knowest.<br> 10 Well-knowing, binding with thy cord, bring hither, Lord of the Wood, the Deities' assembly.<br> The God prepare and season our oblations may Heaven and Earth be gracious to my calling.<br> 11 Agni, bring hither Varuṇa to help us, Indra from heaven, from air's mid-realm the Maruts.<br> On sacred grass all Holy ones be seated and let the Immortal Gods rejoice in Svāhā.</p>
