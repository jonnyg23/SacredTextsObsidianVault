 <p>1. AGNI, accept this flaming brand, this waiting with my prayer on thee:<br> Hear graciously these songs of praise.<br> 2 With this hymn let us honour thee, seeker of horses, Son of Strength,<br> With this fair hymn, thou nobly born.<br> 3 As such, lover of song, with songs, wealth-lover, giver of our wealth!<br> With reverence let us worship thee.<br> 4 Be thou for us a liberal Prince, giver and Lord of precious things.<br> Drive those who hate us far away.<br> 5 Such as thou art, give rain from heaven, give strength which no man may resist:<br> Give food exceeding plentiful.<br> 6 To him who lauds thee, craving help, most youthful envoy! through our song,<br> Most holy Herald! come thou nigh.<br> 7 Between both races, Agni, Sage, well skilled thou passest to and fro,<br> As envoy friendly to mankind.<br> 8 Befriend us thou as knowing all. Sage, duly worship thou the Gods,<br> And seat thee on this sacred grass.</p>
