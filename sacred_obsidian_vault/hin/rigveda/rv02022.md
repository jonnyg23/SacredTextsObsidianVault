 <p>1. At the Trikadrukas the Great and Strong hath drunk drink blent with meal. With Viṣṇu hath he quaffed the poured out Soma juice, all that he would.<br> That hath so heightened him the Great, the Wide, to do his mighty work.<br> So may the God attain the God, true Indu Indra who is true.<br> 2 So he resplendent in the battle overcame Krivi by might. He with his majesty hath filled the earth and heaven, and waxen strong.<br> One share of the libation hath he swallowed down: one share he left.<br> So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.<br> 3 Brought forth together with wisdom and mighty power thou grewest great; with hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act;<br> Giving prosperity, and lovely wealth to him who praiseth thee. So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.<br> 4 This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work, worthy to be told forth in heaven,<br> What time thou sentest down life with a God's own power, freeing the floods.<br> All that is godless may he conquer with his might, and, Lord of Hundred Powers, find for us strength and food.</p>
