 <p>1. THEY who lay quiet for a year, the Brahmans who fulfil their vows,<br> The Frogs have lifted up their voice, the voice Parjanya hath inspired.<br> 2 What time on these, as on a dry skin lying in the pool's bed, the floods of heaven descended,<br> The music of the Frogs comes forth in concert like the cows lowing with their calves beside them.<br> 3 When at the coming of the Rains the water has poured upon them as they yearned and thirsted,<br> One seeks another as he talks and greets him with cries of pleasure as a son his father.<br> 4 Each of these twain receives the other kindly, while they are revelling in the flow of waters,<br> When the Frog moistened by the rain springs forward, and Green and Spotty both combine their voices.<br> 5 When one of these repeats the other's language, as he who learns the lesson of the teacher,<br> Your every limb seems to be growing larger as ye converse with eloquence on the waters.<br> 6 Onc is Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat the other, one Frog is Green and one of them is Spotty.<br> They bear one common name, and yet they vary, and, talking, modulate the voice diversely.<br> 7 As Brahmans, sitting round the brimful vessel, talk at the Soma-rite of Atiratra,<br> So, Frogs, ye gather round the pool to honour this day of all the year, the first of Rain-time.<br> 8 These Brahmans with the Soma juice, performing their year-long rite, have lifted up their voices;<br> And these Adhvaryus, sweating with their kettles, come forth and show themselves, and none are hidden.<br> 9 They keep the twelve month's God-appointed order, and never do the men neglect the season.<br> Soon as the Rain-time in the year returneth, these who were heated kettles gain their freedom.<br> 10 Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat have granted riches, and Green and Spotty have vouchsafed us treasure.<br> The Frogs who give us cows in hundreds lengthen our lives in this most fertilizing season.</p>
