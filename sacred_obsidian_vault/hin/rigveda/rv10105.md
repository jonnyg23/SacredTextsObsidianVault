 <p>1. WHEN, Vasu, wilt thou love the laud? Now let the channel bring the stream.<br> The juice is ready to ferment.<br> 2 He whose two Bay Steeds harnessed well, swerving, pursue the Bird's tail-plumes,<br> With Rowing manes, like heaven and earth, he is the Lord with power to give.<br> 3 Bereft of skill is Indra, if, like some outwearied man he fears<br> The sinner, when the Mighty hath prepared himself for victory.<br> 4 Indra with these drives round, until he meets with one to worship him:<br> Indra is Master of the pair who snort and swerve upon their way.<br> 5 Borne onward by the long-maned Steeds who stretch themselves as twere for food,<br> The God who wears the helm defends them with his jaws.<br> 6 The Mighty sang with Lofty Ones: the Hero fashioned with his strength,<br> Like skilful Mātariśvan with his power and might,<br> 7 The bolt, which pierced at once the vitals of the Dasyu easy to be slain,<br> With jaw uninjured like the wondrous firmament.<br> 8 Grind off our sins: with song will we conquer the men who sing no hymns:<br> Not easily art thou pleased with prayerless sacrifice.<br> 9 When threefold flame burns high for thee, to rest on poles of sacrifice,<br> Thou with the living joyest in the self-bright Ship.<br> 10 Thy glory was the speckled cup, thy glory was the flawless scoop.<br> Wherewith thou pourest into thy receptacle.<br> 11 As hundreds, O Immortal God, have sung to thee, so hath Sumitra, yea, Durmitra praised thee here,<br> What time thou holpest Kutsa's son, when Dasyus fell, yea, holpest Kutsa's darling when the Dasyus died.</p>
