 <p>1. I CALL your chariot to receive united praise mid princely men,<br> Strong Gods who pour down wealth, of never vanquished might!<br> 2 Ye to Varosusaman come, Nāsatyas, for this glorious rite.<br> With your protecting aid. Strong Gods, who pour down wealth.<br> 3 So with oblations we invoke you, rich in ample wealth, to-day,<br> When night hath passed, O ye who send us plenteous food.<br> O Aśvins, Heroes, let your car, famed, best to travel, come to us,<br> And, for his glory, mark your zealous servant's lauds.<br> 5 Aśvins, who send us precious gifts, even when offended, think of him:<br> For ye, O Rudras, lead us safe beyond our foes.<br> 6 For, Wonder-Workers, with fleet steeds ye fly completely round this All,<br> Stirring our thoughts, ye Lords of splendour, honey-hued.<br> 7 With all-sustaining opulence, Aśvins, come hitherward to us,<br> Ye rich and noble Heroes, neer to be oerthrown.<br> 8 To welcome this mine offering, O ye Indra-like Nāsatyas, come<br> As Gods of best accord this day with other Gods.<br> 9 For we, like Vyaśva, lifting up our voice like oxen, call on you:<br> With all your loving kindness, Sages, come to us.<br> 10 O Ṛṣi, laud the Aśvins well. Will they not listen to thy call?<br> Will they not burn the Paṇis who are nearer them?<br> 11 O Heroes, listen to the son of Vyaśva, and regard me here,<br> Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, of one accord.<br> 12 Gods whom we yearn for, of your gifts, of what ye bring to us, bestow<br> By princes' hands on me, ye Mighty, day by day.<br> 13 Him whom your sacrifices clothe, even as a woman with her robe,<br> The Aśvins help to glory honouring him well.<br> 14 Whoso regards your care of men as succour widest in its reach,<br> About his dwelling go, ye Aśvins, loving us.<br> 15 Come to us ye who pour down wealth, come to the home which men must guard:<br> Like shafts, ye are made meet for sacrifice by song.<br> 16 Most fetching of all calls, the laud, as envoy, Heroes, called to you<br> Be it your own, O Aśvin Pair.<br> 17 Be ye in yonder sea of heaven, or joying in the home of food,<br> Listen to me, Immortal Ones.<br> 18 This river with his lucid flow attracts you, more than all the streams,<br> Even Sindhu with his path of gold.<br> 19 O Aśvins, with that glorious fame come hither, through our brilliant song,<br> Come ye whose ways are marked with light.<br> 20 Harness the steeds who draw the car, O Vasu, bring the well-fed pair.<br> O Vāyu, drink thou of our meath: come unto our drink-offerings.<br> 21 Wonderful Vāyu, Lord of Right, thou who art Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law,<br> Thy saving succour we elect.<br> 22 To Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law we pray for wealth whereof he hath control:<br> For glory we seek vayu, men with juice effused.<br> 23 From heaven, auspicious Vāyu, come drive hither with thy noble steeds:<br> Come on thy mighty car with wide-extending seat.<br> 24 We call thee to the homes of men, thee wealthiest in noble food,<br> And liberal as a press-stone with a horse's back.<br> 25 So, glad and joyful in thine heart, do thou, God, Vāyu, first of all<br> Vouchsafe us water, strength, and thought.</p>
