 <p>1. SERVED with oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Aṅgiras' son, Bṛhaspati, the Holy,<br> With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly, as a bull, to Earth and Heaven.<br> 2 Bṛhaspati, who made for such a people wide room and verge when Gods were invocated,<br> Slaying his enemies, breaks down their castles, quelling his foes and conquering those who hate him.<br> 3 Bṛhaspati in war hath won rich treasures, hath won, this God, the great stalls filled with cattle.<br> Striving to win waters and light, resistless, Bṛhaspati with lightning smites the foeman.</p>
