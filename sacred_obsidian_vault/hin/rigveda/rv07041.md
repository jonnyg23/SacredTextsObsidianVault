 <p>1. AGNI at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuṇa and Mitra, and the Aśvins twain.<br> Bhaga at dawn, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, Soma at dawn, Rudra we will invoke at dawn.<br> 2 We will invoke strong, early-conquering Bhaga, the Son of Aditi, the great supporter:<br> Thinking of whom, the poor, yea, even the mighty, even the King himself says, Give me Bhaga.<br> 3 Bhaga our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this song, and give us wealth, O Bhaga.<br> Bhaga, augment our store of kine and horses, Bhaga, may we be rich in men and heroes.<br> 4 So may felicity be ours at present, and when the day approaches, and at noontide;<br> And may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in the Deities' loving-kindness.<br> 5 May Bhaga verily be bliss-bestower, and through him, Gods! may happiness attend us.<br> As such, O Bhaga, all with might invoke thee: as such be thou our Champion here, O Bhaga.<br> 6 To this our worship may all Dawns incline them, and come to the pure place like Dadhikrāvan.<br> As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring us hitherward Bhaga who discovers treasure.<br> 7 May blessed Mornings dawn on us for ever, with wealth of kine, of horses, and of heroes,<br> Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
