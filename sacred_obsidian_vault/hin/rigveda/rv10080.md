 <p>1. AGNI bestows the fleet prize-winning courser: Agni, the hero famed and firm in duty.<br> Agni pervades and decks the earth and heaven, and fills the fruitful dame who teems with heroes.<br> 2 Blest be the wood that feeds the active Agni: within the two great worlds hath Agni entered.<br> Agni impels a single man to battle, and with him rends in pieces many a foeman.<br> 3 Agni rejoiced the car of him who praised lim, and from the waters burnt away jarutha.<br> Agni saved Atri in the fiery cavem, and made Nrmedha rich with troops of children.<br> 4 Agni hath granted wealth that decks the hero, and sent the sage who wins a thousand cattle.<br> Agni hath made oblations rise to heaven: to every place are Agni's laws extended.<br> 5 With songs of praise the Ṛṣis call on Agni; on Agni, heroes worsted in the foray.<br> Birds flying in the region call on Agni around a thousand cattle Agni wanders.<br> 6 Races of human birth pay Agni worship, men who have sprung from Nahus' line adore him.<br> Stablished in holy oil is Agni's pasture, on the Gandharva path of Law and Order.<br> 7 The Ṛbhus fabricated prayer for Agni, and we with mighty hymns have called on Agni.<br> Agni, Most Youthful God, protect the singer: win us by worship, Agni, great possessions.</p>
