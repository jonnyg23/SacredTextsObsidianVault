 <p>1. LIKE cars that thunder on their way, like coursers eager for renown,<br> Have Soma-drops flowed forth for wealth.<br> 2 Forth have they rushed from holding hands, like chariots that are urged to speed,<br> Like joyful songs of singing-men.<br> 3 The Somas deck themselves with milk, as Kings are graced with eulogies,<br> And, with seven priests, the sacrifice.<br> 4 Pressed for the gladdening draught, the drops flow forth abundantly with song,<br> The Soma juices in a stream.<br> 5 Winning Vivasvān's glory and producing Morning's light, the Suns<br> Pass through the openings of the cloth.<br> 6 The singing-men of ancient time open the doors of sacred songs,<br> Men, for the mighty to accept.<br> 7 Combined in close society sit the seven priests, the brother-hood,<br> Filling the station of the One.<br> 8 He gives us kinship with the Gods, and with the Sun unites our eye:<br> The Sage's ofrspring hath appeared.<br> 9 The Sun with his dear eye beholds that quarter of the heavens which priests<br> Have placed within the sacred cell.</p>
