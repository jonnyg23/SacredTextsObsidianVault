 <p>1. PRESENT to Varuṇa thine hymn, Vasiṣṭha, bright, most delightful to the Bounteous Giver,<br> Who bringeth on to us the Bull, the lofty, the Holy, laden with a thousand treasures.<br> 2 And now, as I am come before his presence, I take the face of Varuṇa for Agni's.<br> So might he bring-Lord also of the darkness-the light in heaven that I may see its beauty!<br> 3 When Varuṇa and I embark together and urge our boat into the midst of ocean,<br> We, when we ride oer ridges of the waters, will swing within that swing and there be happy.<br> 4 Varuṇa placed Vasiṣṭha in the vessel, and deftly with his niight made him a Ṛṣi.<br> When days shone bright the Sage made him a singer, while the heavens broadened and the Dawns were lengthened.<br> 5 What hath become of those our ancient friendships, when without enmity we walked together?<br> I, Varuṇa, thou glorious Lord, have entered thy lofty home, thine house with thousand portals.<br> 6 If he, thy true ally, hath sinned against thee, still, Varuṇa, he is the friend thou lovedst.<br> Let us not, Living One, as sinners I know thee: give shelter, as a Sage, to him who lauds thee.<br> 7 While we abide in these fixed habitations, and from the lap of Aditi win favour,<br> May Varuṇa untie the bond that binds us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
