 <p>1. WITH this my reverent hymn I call Agni for you, the Son of Strength,<br> Dear, wisest envoy, served with noble sacrifice, immortal messenger of all.<br> 2 His two red horses, all-supporting, let him yoke: let him, well-worshipped, urge them fast.<br> Then hath the sacrifice good prayers and happy end, and heavenly gift of wealth to men.<br> 3 The flame of him the Bountiful, the Much-invoked, hath mounted up,<br> And his red-coloured smoke-clouds reach and touch the sky: the men are kindling Agni well.<br> 4 Thee, thee Most Glorious One we make our messenger. Bring the Gods hither to the feast.<br> Give us, O Son of Strength, all food that fcedeth man: give that for which we pray to thee.<br> 5 Thou, Agni, art the homestead's Lord, our Herald at the sacrifice.<br> Lord of all boons, thou art the Cleanser and a Sage. Pay worship, and enjoy the good.<br> 6 Give riches to the sacrificer, O Most Wise, for thou art he who granteth wealth.<br> Inspire with zeal each priest at this our solemn rite; all who are skilled in singing praise.<br> 7 O Agni who art worshipped well, dear let our princes he to thee,<br> Our wealthy patrons who are governors of men, who part, as gifts, their stalls of kine.<br> 8 They in whose home, her hand bearing the sacred oil, Iḷā sits down well-satisfied-<br> Guard them, Victorious God, from slander and from harm. give us a refuge famed afar.<br> 9 Do thou, a Priest with pleasant tongue, most wise, and very near to us,<br> Agni, bring riches hither to our liberal chiefs, and speed the oflering of our gifts.<br> 10 They who bestow as bounty plenteous wealth of steeds, moved by desire of great renown-<br> Do thou with saving help preserve them from distress, Most Youthful! with a hundred forts.<br> 11 The God who gives your wealth demands a full libation poured to him.<br> Pour ye it forth, then fill the vessel full again: then doth the God pay heed to you.<br> 12 Him have the Gods appointed Priest of sacrifice, oblation-bearer, passing wise.<br> Agni gives wealth and valour to the worshipper, to folk who offer up their gifts.</p>
