 <p>1. INDRA and Agni, surely ye as Conquerors will give us wealth,<br> Whereby in fight we may oercome that which is strong and firmly fixed, as Agni burns the woods with wind. Let all the others die away.<br> 2 We set no snares to tangle you; Indra we worship and adore, Hero of heroes mightiest.<br> Once may he come unto us with his Steed, come unto us to win us strength, and to complete the sacrifice.<br> 3 For, famous Indra-Agni, ye are dwellers in the midst of frays.<br> Sages in wisdom, ye are knit to him who seeketh you as friends. Heroes, bestow on him his wish.<br> 4 Nabhāka-like, with sacred song Indra's and Agni's praise I sing,<br> Theirs to whom all this world belongs, this heaven and this mighty earth which bear rich treasure in their lap.<br> 5 To Indra and to Agni send your prayers, as was Nabhāka's wont,<br> Who oped with sideway opening the sea with its foundations sevenIndra all powerful in his might.<br> 6 Tear thou asunder, as of old, like tangles of a creeping plant,<br> Demolish thou the Dāsa's might. May we with Indra's help divide the treasure he hath gathered up.<br> 7 What time with this same song these men call Indra-Agni sundry ways,<br> May we with our own heroes quell those who provoke us to the fight, and conquer those who strive with us.<br> 8 The Two refulgent with their beams rise and come downward from the sky.<br> By Indra's and by Agni's hest, flowing away, the rivers, run which they released from their restraint.<br> 9 O Indra, many are thine aids, many thy ways of guiding us,<br> Lord of the Bay Steeds, Hinva's Son. To a Good Hero come our prayers, which soon shall have accomplishment.<br> 10 Inspire him with your holy hymns, the Hero bright and glorious,<br> Him who with might demolisheth even the brood of Śuṣṇa, and winneth for us the heavenly streams.<br> 11 Inspire him worshipped with fair rites, the glorious Hero truly brave.<br> He brake in pieces Śuṣṇa's brood who still expected not the stroke, and won for us the heavenly streams. Let all the others die away.<br> 12 Thus have we sung anew to Indra-Agni, as sang our sires, Aṅgirases, and Mandhātar.<br> Guard us with triple shelter and preserve us: may we be masters of a store of riches.</p>
