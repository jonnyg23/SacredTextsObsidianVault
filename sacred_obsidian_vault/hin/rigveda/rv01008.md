 <p>1 INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquering wealth,<br> Most excellent, to be our aid;<br> 2 By means of which we may repel our foes in battle hand to hand,<br> By thee assisted with the car.<br> 3 Aided by thee, the thunder-armed, Indra, may we lift up the bolt,<br> And conquer all our foes in fight.<br> 4 With thee, O India, for ally with missile-darting heroes, may<br> We conquer our embattled foes.<br> 5 Mighty is Indra, yea supreme; greatness be his, the Thunderer:<br> Wide as the heaven extends his power<br> 6 Which aideth those to win them sons, who come as heroes to the fight,<br> Or singers loving holy thoughts.<br> 7 His belly, drinking deepest draughts of Soma, like an ocean swells,<br> Like wide streams from the cope of heaven.<br> 8 So also is his excellence, great, vigorous, rich in cattle, like<br> A ripe branch to the worshipper.<br> 9 For verily thy mighty powers, Indra, are saving helps at once<br> Unto a worshipper like me.<br> 10 So are his lovely gifts; let lauds and praises be to Indra sung,<br> That he may drink the Soma juice.</p>
