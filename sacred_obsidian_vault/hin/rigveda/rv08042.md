 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XLII Varuṇa.</h3>  
 <p>1. LORD of all wealth, the Asura propped the heavens, and measured out the broad earth's wide expanses.<br> He, King supreme, approached all living creatures. All these are Varuṇa's holy operations.<br> 2 So humbly worship Varuṇa the Mighty revere the wise Guard of World Immortal.<br> May he vouchsafe us triply-barred protection. O Earth and Heaven, within your lap preserve us.<br> 3 Sharpen this song of him who strives his utmost, sharpen, God Varuṇa, his strength and insight;<br> May we ascend the ship that bears us safely, whereby we may pass over all misfortune.<br> 4 Aśvins, with songs the singer stones have made you hasten hitherward,<br> Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.<br> 5 As the sage Atri with his hymns, O Aśvins, called you eagerly,<br> Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.<br> 6 So have I called you to our aid, even as the wise have called of old,<br> Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.</p>
