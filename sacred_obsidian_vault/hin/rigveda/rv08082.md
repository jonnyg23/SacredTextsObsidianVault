 <p>1. SURYA, thou mountest up to meet the Hero famous for his wealth,<br> Who hurls the bolt and works for man<br> 2 Him who with might of both his arms brake nine-and-ninety castles down,<br> Slew Vṛtra and smote Ahi dead.<br> 3 This Indra is our gracious Friend. He sends us in a full broad stream<br> Riches in horses, kine, and corn.<br> 4 Whatever, Vṛtra-slayer! thou, Sūrya, hast risen upon to-day,<br> Tbat, Indra, all is in thy power.<br> 5 When, Mighty One, Lord of the brave, thou thinkest thus, I shall not die,<br> That thought of thine is true indeed.<br> 6 Thou, Indra, goest unto all Soma libations shed for thee,<br> Both far away and near at hand.<br> 7 We make this Indra very strong to strike the mighty Vṛtra dead:<br> A vigorous Hero shall he be.<br> 8 Indra was made for giving, set, most mighty, oer the joyous draught.<br> Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song.<br> 9 By song as twere, the powerful bolt which none may parry was prepared<br> Lofty, invincible he grew.<br> 10 Indra, Song-lover, lauded, make even in the wilds fair ways for us,<br> Whenever, Maghavan, thou wilt.<br> 11 Thou whose commandment and behest of sovran sway none disregards,<br> Neither audacious man nor God.<br> 12 And both these Goddesses, Earth, Heaven, Lord of the beauteous helm! revere<br> Thy might which no one may resist.<br> 13 Thou in the black cows and the red and in the cows with spotted skin<br> This white milk hast deposited.<br> 14 When in their terror all the Gods shrank from the Dragon's furious might,<br> Fear of the monster fell on them.<br> 15 Then he was my Defender, then, Invincible, whose foe is not,<br> The Vṛtra-slayer showed his might.<br> 16 Him your best Vṛtra-slayer, him the famous Champion of mankind<br> I urge to great munificence,<br> 17 To come, Much-lauded! Many-named with this same thought that longs for milk,<br> Wheneer the Soma juice is shed.<br> 18 Much-honoured by libations, may the Vṛtra-slayer wake for us:<br> May Śakra listen to our prayers.<br> 19 O Hero, with that aid dost thou delight us, with what succour bring<br> Riches to those who worship thee?<br> 20 With whose libation joys the Strong, the Hero with his team who quells<br> The foe, to drink the Soma juice?<br> 21 Rejoicing in thy spirit bring thousandfold opulence to us:<br> Enrich thy votary with gifts.<br> 22 These juices with their wedded wives flow to enjoyment lovingly:<br> To waters speeds the restless one.<br> 23 Presented strengthening gifts have sent Indra away at sacrifice,<br> With might, onto the cleansing bath.<br> 24 These two who share his feast, Bay Steeds with golden manes, shall bring him to<br> The banquet that is laid for him.<br> 25 For thee, O Lord of Light, are shed these Soma-drops, and grass is strewn<br> Bring Indra to his worshippers.<br> 26 May Indra give thee skill, and lights of heaven, wealth to his votary<br> And priests who praise him: laud ye him.<br> 27 O Śatakratu, wondrous strength and all our lauds I bring to thee:<br> Be gracious to thy worshippers.<br> 28 Bring to us all things excellent, O Śatakratu, food and strength:<br> For, Indra, thou art kind to us.<br> 2§ O Śatakratu, bring to us all blessings, all felicity:<br> Fbr, Indra, thou art kind to us.<br> 30 Bearing the Soma juice we call, best Vṛtra-slayer, unto thee:<br> For, Indra, thou art kind to us.<br> 31 Come, Lord of rapturous, joys, to our libation with thy Bay Steeds, come<br> To our libation with thy Steeds.<br> 32 Known as best Vṛtra-slayer erst, as Indra Śatakratu, come<br> With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.<br> 33 O Vṛtra-slayer, thou art he who drinks these drops of Soma: come<br> With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.<br> 34 May Indra give, to aid us, wealth handy that rules the Skilful Ones:<br> Yea, may the Strong give potent wealth.</p>
