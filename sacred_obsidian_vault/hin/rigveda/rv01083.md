 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN LXXXIII. Indra.</h3>  
 <p>1. INDRA, the mortal man well guarded by thine aid goes foremost in the wealth of horses and of kine.<br> With amplest wealth thou fillest him, as round about the waters clearly seen afar fill Sindhu full.<br> 2 The heavenly Waters come not nigh the priestly bowl: they but look down and see how far mid-air is spread:<br> The Deities conduct the pious man to them: like suitors they delight in him who loveth prayer.<br> 3 Praiseworthy blessing hast thou laid upon the pair who with uplifted ladle serve thee, man and wife.<br> Unchecked he dwells and prospers in thy law: thy power brings blessing to the sacrificer pouring gifts.<br> 4 First the Aṅgirases won themselves vital power, whose fires were kindled through good deeds and sacrifice.<br> The men together found the Paṇi's hoarded wealth, the cattle, and the wealth in horses and in kine.<br> 5 Atharvan first by sacrifices laid the paths then, guardian of the Law, sprang up the loving Sun.<br> Uśanā Kāvya straightway hither drove the kine. Let us with offerings honour Yama's deathless birth.<br> 6 When sacred grass is trimmed to aid the auspicious work, or the hymn makes its voice of praise sound to the sky.<br> Where the stone rings as twere a singer skilled in laud,Indra in truth delights when these come near to him.</p>
