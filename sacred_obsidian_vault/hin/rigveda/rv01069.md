 <p>1. BRIGHT, splendid, like Dawn's lover, he hath filled the two joined worlds as with the light of heaven.<br> When born, with might thou hast encompassed them: Father of Gods, and yet their Son wast thou.<br> 2 Agni, the Sage, the humble, who discerns like the cow's udder, the sweet taste of food,<br> Like a bliss-giver to be drawn to men, sits gracious in the middle of the house.<br> 3 Born in the dwelling like a lovely son, pleased, like a strong steed, he bears on the folk.<br> What time the men and I, with heroes, call, may Agni then gain all through Godlike power.<br> 4 None breaks these holy laws of thine when thou hast granted audience to these chieftains here.<br> This is thy boast, thou smotest with thy peers, and joined with heroes dravest off disgrace.<br> 5 Like the Dawn's lover, spreading light, well-known as hued like morn, may he remember me.<br> They, bearing of themselves, unbar the doors: they all ascend to the fair place of heaven.</p>
