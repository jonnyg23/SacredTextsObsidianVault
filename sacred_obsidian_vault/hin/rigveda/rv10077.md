 <p>1. As with their voice from cloud they sprinkle treasure so are the wise man's liberal sacrifices.<br> I praise their Company that merits worship as the good Martits' priest to pay them honour.<br> 2 The youths have wrought their ornaments for glory through many nights,this noble band of Maruts.<br> Like stags the Sons of Dyatis have striven onward, the Sons of Aditi grown strong like pillars.<br> 3 They who extend beyond the earth and heaven, by their own mass, as from the cloud spreads Sūrya;<br> Like mighty Heroes covetous of glory, like heavenly gallants who destroy the wicked.<br> 4 When ye come nigh, as in the depth of waters, the earth is loosened, as it were, and shaken.<br> This your all-feedin sacrifice approaches: come all united, fraught, as twere with viands.<br> 5 Ye are like horses fastened to the chariot poles, luminous with your beams, with splendour as at dawn;<br> Like self-bright falcons, punishers of wicked men, like hovering birds urged forward, scattering rain around.<br> 6 When ye come forth, O Maruts, from the distance, from the great treasury of rich possessions,<br> Knowing, O Vasus, boons that should be granted, even from afar drive back the men who hate us.<br> 7 He who, engaged in the rite's final duty brings, as a man, oblation to the Maruts,<br> Wins him life's wealthy fulness, blest with heroes: he shall be present, too, where Gods drink Soma.<br> 8 For these are helps adored at sacrifices, bringing good fortune by their name Ādityas.<br> Speeding on cars let them protect our praises, delighting in our sacrifice and worship.</p>
