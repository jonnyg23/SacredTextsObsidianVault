 <p>1. HE hath sent forth, bright, radiant, and refulgent, like the Dawn's Lover, his far-spreading lustre.<br> Pure in his splendour shines the golden Hero: our longing thoughts hath he aroused and wakened.<br> 2 He, like the Sun, hath shone while Morn is breaking, and priests who weave the sacrifice sing praises,<br> Agni, the God, who knows their generations and visits Gods, most bounteous, rapid envoy.<br> 3 Our songs and holy hymns go forth to Agni, seeking the God and asking him for riches,<br> Him fair to see, of goodly aspect, mighty, men's messenger who carries their oblations.<br> 4 joined with the Vasus, Agni, bring thou Indra bring hither mighty Rudra with the Rudras,<br> Aditi good to all men with Ādityas, Bṛhaspati All-bounteous, with the Singers.<br> 5 Men eagerly implore at sacrifices Agni, Most Youthful God, the joyous Herald.<br> For he is Lord and Ruler over riches, and for Gods worship an unwearied envoy.</p>
