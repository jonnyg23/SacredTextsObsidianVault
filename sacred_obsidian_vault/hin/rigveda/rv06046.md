 <p>1. THAT we may win us wealth and power we poets, verily, call on thee:<br> In war men call on thee, Indra, the hero's Lord, in the steed's race-course call on thee.<br> 2 As such, O Wonderful, whose hand holds thunder, praised as mighty, Caster of the Stone!<br> Pour on us boldly, Indra, kine and chariotsteeds, ever to be the conqueror's strength.<br> 3 We call upon that Indra, who, most active, ever slays the foe:<br> Lord of the brave, Most Manly, with a thousand powers, help thou and prosper us in fight.<br> 4 Rcisama, thou forcest men as with a bull, with anger, in the furious fray.<br> Be thou our Helper in the mighty battle fought for sunlight, water, and for life.<br> 5 O Indra, bring us name and fame, enriching, mightiest, excellent,<br> Wherewith, O Wondrous God, fair-visored, thunder-armed, thou hast filled full this earth and heaven.<br> 6 We call on thee, O King, Mighty amid the Gods, Ruler of men, to succour us.<br> All that is weak in us, Excellent God, make firm: make our foes easy to subdue.<br> 7 All strength and valour that is found, Indra, in tribes of Nahusas, and all the splendid fame that the Five Tribes enjoy<br> Bring, yea, all manly powers at once.<br> 8 Or, Maghavan, what vigorous strength in Trksi lay, in Druhyus or in Paru's folk,<br> Fully bestow on us, that, in the conquering fray, we may subdue our foes in fight.<br> 9 O Indra, grant a happy home, a triple refuge triply strong.<br> Bestow a dwelling-place on the rich lords and me, and keep thy dart afar from these.<br> 10 They who with minds intent on spoil subdue the foe, boldly attack and smite him down,<br> From these, O Indra Maghavan who lovest song, be closest guardian of our lives.<br> 11 And now, O Indra, strengthen us: come near and aid us in the fight,<br> What time the feathered shafts are flying in the air, the arrows with their sharpened points.<br> 12 Give us, where heroes strain their bodies in the fight, the shelter that our fathers loved.<br> To us and to our sons give refuge: keep afar all unobserved hostility.<br> 13 When, Indra, in the mighty fray thou urgest chargers to their speed,<br> On the uneven road and on a toilsome path, like falcons, eager for renown,<br> 14 Speeding like rivers rushing down a steep descent, responsive to the urging call,<br> That come like birds attracted to the bait, held in by reins in both the driver's hands.</p>
