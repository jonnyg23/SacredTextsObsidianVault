 <p>1. WIN, to assist you, Rudra, Lord of worship, Priest of both worlds, effectual<br> Sacrificer,<br> Agni, invested with his golden colours, before the thunder strike and lay you senseless.<br> 2 This shrine have we made ready for thy coming, as the fond dame attires her for her husband.<br> Performer of good work, sit down before us, invested while these flames incline to meet thee.<br> 3 A hymn, O Priest, to him who hears, the gentle, to him who looks on men, exceeding gracious,<br> A song of praise sing to the God Immortal, whom the stone, presser of the sweet juice, worships.<br> 4 Even as true knower of the Law, O Agni, to this our solemn rite he thou attentive.<br> When shall thy songs of festival be sung thee? When is thy friendship shown within our dwelling?<br> 5 Why this complaint to Varuṇa, O Agni? And why to Heaven? for what is our transgression?<br> How wilt thou speak to Earth and bounteous Mitra? What wilt thou say to Aryaman and Bhaga?<br> 6 What, when thou blazest on the lesser altars, what to the mighty Wind who comes to bless us,<br> True, circumambient? what to Earth, O Agni, what wilt thou say to man-destroying Rudra?<br> 7 How to great Pūṣan who promotes our welfare,to honoured Rudra what, who gives oblations?<br> What sin of ours to the far-striding Viṣṇu, what, Agni, wilt thou tell the Lofty Arrow.<br> 8 What wilt thou tell the truthful band of Maruts, how answer the great Sun when thou art questioned?<br> Before the Free, before the Swift, defend us: fulfil heaven's work, all-knowing Jātavedas.<br> 9 I crave the cow's true gift arranged by Order: though raw, she hath the sweet ripe juice, O Agni.<br> Though she is black of hue with milk she teemeth, nutritious, brightly shining, all-sustaining.<br> 10 Agni the Bull, the manly, hath been sprinkled with oil upon his back, by Law eternal.<br> He who gives vital power goes on unswerving. Pṛśni the Bull hath milked the pure wiiite udder.<br> 11 By Law the Aṅgirases cleft the rock asunder, and sang their hymns together with the cattle.<br> Bringing great bliss the men encompassed Morning: light was apparent at the birth of Agni.<br> 12 By Law the Immortal Goddesses the Waters, with meath-rich waves, O Agni, and uninjured,<br> Like a strong courser lauded in his running, sped to flow onward swiftly and for ever.<br> 13 Go never to the feast of one who harms us, the treacherous neighbour or unworthy kinsman.<br> Punish us not for a false brother's trespass. Let us not feel the might of friend or foeman.<br> 14 O Agni, keep us safe with thy protection, loving us, honoured God! and ever guarding.<br> Beat thou away, <a href="errata.htm#14">destroy</a> severe affliction slay een the demon when he waxes mighty.<br> 15 Through these our songs of praise be gracious, Agni; moved by our prayers, O Hero, touch our viands.<br> Accept, O Aṅgiras, these our devotions, and let the praise which Gods desire address thee.<br> 16 To thee who knowest, Agni, thou Disposer, all these wise secret speeches have I uttered,<br> Sung to thee, Sage, the charming words of wisdom, to thee, O Singer, with. my thoughts and Praises.</p>
