 <p>1. LET every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding God.<br> Each one solicits him for wealth and seeks renown to prosper him.<br> 2 These, leading God, are thine, and these here ready to speak after us.<br> As such may we attain to wealth and wait with services on thee.<br> 3 So further honour as our guests the Hero Gods and then the Dames.<br> May he remove and keep afar our foes and all who block our path.<br> 4 Where fire is set, and swiftly runs the victim dwelling in the trough,<br> He wins, with heroes in his home, friendly to man, like constant streams.<br> 5 May these thy riches, Leader God! that rule the car, be blest to us,<br> Yea, blest to us for wealth and weal. This will we ponder praising strength, this ponder as we praise the God.</p>
