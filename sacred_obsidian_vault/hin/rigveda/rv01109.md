 <p>1. LONGING for weal I looked around, in spirit, for kinsmen, Indra-Agni, or for brothers.<br> No providence but yours alone is with me so have I wrought for you this hymn for succour.<br> 2 For I have heard that ye give wealth more freely than worthless son-in-law or spouse's brother.<br> So offering to you this draught of Soma, I make you this new hymn, Indra and Agni,<br> 3 Let us not break the cords: with this petition we strive to gain the powers of our forefathers.<br> For Indra-Agni the strong drops are joyful, for here in the bowl's lap are both the press-stones.<br> 4 For you the bowl divine, Indra and Agni, presses the Soma gladly to delight you.<br> With hands auspicious and fair arms, ye Aśvins, haste, sprinkle it with sweetness in the waters.<br> 5 You, I have heard, were mightiest, Indra-Agni, when Vṛtra fell and when the spoil was parted.<br> Sit at this sacrifice, ye ever active, on the strewn grass, and with the juice delight you.<br> 6 Surpassing all men where they shout for battle, ye Twain exceed the earth and heaven in greatness.<br> Greater are ye than rivers and than mountains, O Indra-Agni, and all things beside them.<br> 7 Bring wealth and give it, ye whose arms wield thunder: Indra and Agni, with your powers protect us.<br> Now of a truth these be the very sunbeams wherewith our fathers were of old united.<br> 8 Give, ye who shatter forts, whose hands wield thunder: Indra and Agni, save us in our battles.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
