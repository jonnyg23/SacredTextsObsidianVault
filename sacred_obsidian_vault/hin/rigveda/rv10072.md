 <p>1. LET US with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the Gods,<br> That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.<br> 2 These Brahmaṇaspati produced with blast and smelting, like a Smith,<br> Existence, in an earlier age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.<br> 3 Existence, in the earliest age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.<br> Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.<br> 4 Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the earth were born.<br> Dakṣa was born of Aditi, and Aditi was Dakṣa's Child.<br> 5 For Aditi, O Dakṣa, she who is thy Daughter, was brought forth.<br> After her were the blessed Gods born sharers of immortal life.<br> 6 When ye, O Gods, in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood,<br> Thence, as of dancers, from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose.<br> 7 When, O ye Gods, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow,<br> Then ye brought Sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.<br> 8 Eight are the Sons of Adid who from her body sprang to life.<br> With seven she went to meet the Gods she cast Martanda far away.<br> 9 So with her Seven Sons Aditi went forth to meet the earlier age.<br> She brought Martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.</p>
