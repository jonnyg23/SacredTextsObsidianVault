 <p>1. PASSED through, the fleece in thousand streams the Soma, purified, flows on<br> To Indra's, Viyu's special place.<br> 2 Sing forth, ye men who long for help, to Pavamana, to the Sage,<br> Effused to entertain the Gods.<br> 3 The Soma-drops with thousand powers are purified for victory,<br> Hymned to become the feast of Gods.<br> 4 Yea, as thou flowest bring great store of food that we may win the spoil<br> Indu, bring splendid manly might.<br> 5 May they in flowing give us wealth in thousands, and heroic power,<br> These Godlike Soma-drops effused.<br> 6 Like coursers by their drivers urged, they were poured forth, for victory,<br> Swift through the woollen straining-cloth.<br> 7 Noisily flow the Soma-drops, like milch-kine lowing to their calves:<br> They have run forth from both the hands.<br> 8 As Gladdener whom Indra loves, O Pavamana, with a roar<br> Drive all our enemies away.<br> 9 O Pavamamas, driving off the godless, looking on the light,<br> Sit in the place of sacrifice.</p>
