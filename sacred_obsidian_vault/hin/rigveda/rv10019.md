TURN, go not farther on your way: visit us, O ye Wealthy Ones.<br> Agni and Soma, ye who bring riches again, secure us wealth.<br> 2 Make these return to us again, bring them beside us once again.<br> May. Indra give them back to us, and Agni drive them hither-ward.<br> 3 Let them return to us again: under this herdsman let them feed.<br> Do thou, O Agni, keep them here, and let the wealth we have remain.<br> 4 1 call upon their herdsman, him who knoweth well their coming nigh,<br> Their parting and their home-return, and watcheth their approach and rest.<br> 5 Yea, let the herdsman, too, return, who marketh well their driving-forth;<br> Marketh their wandering away, their turning back and coming home.<br> 6 Home-leader, lead them home to us; Indra, restore to us our kine:<br> We will rejoice in them alive.<br> 7 1 offer you on every side butter and milk and strengthening food.<br> May all the Holy Deities pour down on us a flood of wealth.<br> 8 O thou Home-leader, lead them home, restore them thou who bringest home.<br> Four are the quarters of the earth; from these bring back to us our kine,</p>
