 <p>1 WAKEN the Aśvin Pair who yoke their car at early morn: may they<br> Approach to drink this Soma juice.<br> 2 We call the Aśvins Twain, the Gods borne in a noble car, the best<br> Of charioteers, who reach the heavens.<br> 3 Dropping with honey is your whip, Aśvins, and full of pleasantness<br> Sprinkle therewith the sacrifice.<br> 4 As ye go thither in your car, not far, O Aśvins, is the home<br> Of him who offers Soma juice.<br> 5 For my protection I invoke the golden-handed Savitar.<br> He knoweth, as a God, the place.<br> 6 That he may send us succour, praise the Waters Offspring Savitar:<br> Fain are we for his holy ways.<br> 7 We call on him, distributer of wondrous bounty and of wealth,<br> On Savitar who looks on men.<br> 8 Come hither, friends, and seat yourselves Savitar, to be praised by us,<br> Giving good gifts, is beautiful.<br> 9 O Agni, hither bring to us the willing Spouses of the Gods,<br> And Tvaṣṭar, to the Soma draught.<br> 10 Most youthful Agni, hither bring their Spouses, Hotrā, Bhāratī,<br> Varūtrī, Dhiṣaṇā, for aid.<br> 11 Spouses of Heroes, Goddesses, with whole wings may they come to us<br> With great protection and with aid.<br> 12 Indrāṇī, Varuṇānī, and Agnāyī hither I invite,<br> For weal, to drink the Soma juice.<br> 13 May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, bedew for us our sacrifice,<br> And feed us full with nourishments.<br> 14 Their water rich with fatness, there in the Gandharva's steadfast place,<br> The singers taste through sacred songs.<br> 15 Thornless be thou, O Earth, spread wide before us for a dwelling-place:<br> Vouchsafe us shelter broad and sure.<br> 16 The Gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence Viṣṇu strode<br> Through the seven regions of the earth!<br> 17 Through all this world strode Viṣṇu; thrice his foot he planted, and the whole<br> Was gathered in his footstep's dust.<br> 18 Viṣṇu, the Guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps; thenceforth<br> Establishing his high decrees.<br> 19 Look ye on Viṣṇu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra, close-allied,<br> Hath let his holy ways be seen.<br> 20 The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Viṣṇu is,<br> Laid as it were an eye in heaven.<br> 21 This, Viṣṇu's station most sublime, the singers, ever vigilant,<br> Lovers of holy song, light up.</p>
