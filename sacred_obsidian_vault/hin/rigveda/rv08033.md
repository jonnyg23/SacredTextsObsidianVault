 <p>1. WE compass thee like waters, we whose grass is trimmed and Soma pressed.<br> Here where the filter pours its stream, thy worshippers round thee, O Vṛtra-slayer, sit.<br> 2 Men, Vasu! by the Soma, with lauds call thee to the foremost place:<br> When comest thou athirst unto the juice as home, O Indra, like a bellowing bull?<br> 3 Boldly, Bold Hero, bring us spoil in thousands for the Kaṇvas' sake.<br> O active Maghavan, with eager prayer we crave the yellow-hued with store ol kine.<br> 4 Medhyātithi, to Indra sing, drink of the juice to make thee glad.<br> Close-knit to his Bay Steeds, bolt-armed, beside the juice is he: his chariot is of gold.<br> 5 He Who is praised as strong of hand both right and left, most wise and hold:<br> Indra who, rich in hundreds, gathers thousands up, honoured as breaker-down of forts.<br> 6 The bold of heart whom none provokes, who stands in bearded confidence;<br> Much-lauded, very glorious, overthrowing foes, strong Helper, like a bull with might.<br> 7 Who knows what vital ower he wins, drinking beside the flowing juice?<br> This is the fair-checked God who, joying in the draught, breaks down the castles in his strength.<br> 8 As a wild elephant rushes on this way and that way, mad with heat,'<br> None may compel thee, yet come hither to the draught: thou movest mighty in thy power.<br> 9 When he, the Mighty, neer oerthrown, steadfast, made ready for the fight,<br> When Indra Maghavan lists to his praiser's call, he will not stand aloof, but come.<br> 10 Yea, verily, thou art a Bull, with a bull's rush. whom none may stay:<br> Thou Mighty One, art celebrated as a Bull, famed as a Bull both near and far.<br> 11 Thy reins are very bulls in strength, bulls' strength is in thy golden whip.<br> Thy car, O Maghavan, thy Bays are strong as bulls: thou, Śatakratu, art a Bull.<br> 12 Let the strong presser press for thee. Bring hither, thou straight-rushing Bull.<br> The mighty makes the mighty run in flowing streams for thee whom thy Bay Horses bear.<br> 13 Come, thou most potent Indra, come to drink the savoury Soma juice.<br> Maghavan, very wise, will quickly come to hear the songs, the prayer, the hymns of praise.<br> 14 When thou hast mounted on thy car let thy yoked Bay Steeds carry thee,<br> Past other men's libations, Lord of Hundred Powers, thee, Vṛtra-slayer, thee our Friend.<br> 15 O thou Most Lofty One, accept our laud as nearest to thine heart.<br> May our libations be most sweet to make thee glad, O Soma-drinker, Heavenly Lord.<br> 16 Neither in thy decree nor mine, but in another's he delights,<br> The man who brought us unto this.<br> 17 Indra himself hath said, The mind of woman brooks not discipline,<br> Her intellect hath little weight.<br> 18 His pair of horses, rushing on in their wild transport, draw his car:<br> High-lifted is the stallion's yoke.<br> 19 Cast down thine eyes and look not up. More closely set thy feet. Let none<br> See what thy garment veils, for thou, a Brahman, hast become a dame.</p>
