 <p>1. I WAS aforetime Manu, I was Sūrya: I am the sage Kakṣīvān, holy singer.<br> Kutsa the son of Ārjuni I master. I am the sapient Uśanā behold me.<br> 2 I have bestowed the earth upon the Ārya, and rain upon the man who brings oblation.<br> I guided forth the loudly-roaring waters, and the Gods moved according to my pleasure.<br> 3 In the wild joy of Soma I demolished Śambara's forts, ninety-and-nine, together;<br> And, utterly, the hundredth habitation, when helping Divodāsa Atithigva.<br> 4 Before all birds be ranked this Bird, O Maruts; supreme of falcons be this fleet-winged Falcon,<br> Because, strong- pinioned, with no car to bear him, he brought to Manu the Godloved oblation.<br> 5 When the Bird brought it, hence in rapid motion sent on the wide path fleet as thought he hurried.<br> Swift he returned with sweetness of the Soma, and hence the Falcon hath acquired his glory.<br> 6 Bearing the stalk, the Falcon speeding onward, Bird bringing from afar the draught that gladdens,<br> Friend of the Gods, brought, grasping fast, the Soma which be bad taken from yon loftiest heaven.<br> 7 The Falcon took and brought the Soma, bearing thousand libations with him, yea, ten thousand.<br> The Bold One left Malignities behind him, wise, in wild joy of Soma, left the foolish.</p>
