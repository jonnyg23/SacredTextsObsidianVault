 <p>1. To this our sacrifice come Ṛbhu, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Indra with the gift of riches,<br> Because this day hath Dhiṣaṇā the Goddess set drink for you: the gladdening draughts have reached you.<br> 2 Knowing your birth and rich in gathered treasure, Ṛbhus, rejoice together with the Ṛtus.<br> The gladdening draughts and wisdom have approached you: send ye us riches with good store of heroes.<br> 3 For you was made this sacrifice, O Ṛbhus, which ye, like men, won for yourselves aforetime.<br> To you come all who find in you their pleasure: ye all wereeven the two elderVājas.<br> 4 Now for the mortal worshipper, O Heroes, for him who served you, was the gift of riches.<br> Drink, Vājas, Ṛbhus! unto you is offered, to gladden you, the third and great libation.<br> 5 Come to us, Heroes, Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, glorified for the sake of mighty treasure.<br> These draughts approach you as the day is closing, as cows, whose calves are newly-born, their stable.<br> 6 Come to this sacrifice of ours, ye Children of Strength, invoked with humble adoration.<br> Drink of this meath, Wealth-givers, joined with Indra with whom ye are in full accord, ye Princes.<br> 7 Close knit with Varuṇa drink the Soma, Indra; close-knit, Hymn-lover! with the Maruts drink it:<br> Close-knit with drinkers first, who drink in season; close-knit with heavenly Dames who give us treasures.<br> 8 Rejoice in full accord with the Ādityas, in concord with the Parvatas, O Ṛbhus;<br> In full accord with Savitar, Divine One; in full accord with floods that pour forth riches.<br> 9 Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the Milch-cow and the pair of horses,<br> Made armour, set the heaven and earth asunder,far- reaching Heroes, they have made good offspring.<br> 10 Ye who have wealth in cattle and in booty, in heroes, in rich sustenance and treasure,<br> Such, O ye Ṛbhus, first to drink, rejoicing, give unto us and those who laud our present.<br> 11 Ye were not far: we have not left you thirsting, blameless in this our sacrifice, O Ṛbhus.<br> Rejoice you with the Maruts and with Indra, with the Kings, Gods! that ye may give us riches.</p>
