 <p>1. YE Twain are Priests of sacrifice, winners in war and holy works:<br> Indra and Agni, mark this well.<br> 2 Ye bounteous riders on the car, ye Vṛtra-slayers unsubdued:<br> Indra and Agni, mark this well.<br> 3 The men with pressing-stones have pressed this meath of yours which gives delight:<br> Indra, and Agni, mark this well.<br> 4 Accept our sacrifice for weal, sharers of praise! the Soma shed:<br> Indra and Agni, Heroes, come.<br> 5 Be pleased with these libations which attract you to our sacred gifts<br> Indra and Agni, Heroes, come.<br> 6 Accept this eulogy of mine whose model is the Gāyatrī:<br> Indra and Agni, Heroes, Come.<br> 7 Come with the early-faring Gods, ye who are Lords of genuine wealth:<br> Indra-Agni, to the Soma-draught<br> 8 Hear ye the call of Atris, hear Śyāvāśva as he sheds the juice:<br> Indra-Agni to the Soma-draught<br> 9 Thus have I called you to our aid as sages called on you of old:<br> Indra-Agni to the Soma draught!<br> 10 Indra's and Agni's grace I claim, Sarasvatī's associates<br> To whom this psalm of praise is sung.</p>
