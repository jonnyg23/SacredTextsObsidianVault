 <p>1. I CALL the Gods of lofty glory for our weal, the makers of the light, well-skilled in sacrifice;<br> Those who have waxen mightily, Masters of all wealth, Immortal, strengthening Law, the Gods whom Indra leads.<br> 2 For the strong band of Maruts will we frame a hymn: the chiefs shall bring forth sacrifice for Indra's troop,<br> Who, sent by Indra and advised by Varuṇa, have gotten for themselves a share of Sūrya's light<br> 3 May Indra with the Vasus keep our dwelling safe, and Aditi with Ādityas lend us sure defence.<br> May the God Rudra with the Rudras favour us, and Tvaṣṭar with the Dames further us to success.<br> 4 Aditi, Heaven and Earth, the great eternal Law, Indra, Viṣṇu, the Maruts, and the lofty Sky.<br> We call upon Ādityas, on the Gods, for help, on Vasus, Rudras, Savitar of wondrous deeds.<br> 5 With Holy Thoughts Sarasvān, firm-lawed Varuṇa, great Vāyu, Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, and the Aśvins Twain,<br> Lords of all wealth, Immortal, furtherers of prayer, grant us a triply-guarding refuge from distress.<br> 6 Strong be the sacrifice, strong be the Holy Ones, strong the preparers of oblation, strong the Gods.<br> Mighty be Heaven and Earth, true to eternal Law, strong be Parjanya, strong be they who laud the Strong.<br> 7 To win us strength I glorify the Mighty Twain, Agni and Soma, Mighty Ones whom many laud.<br> May these vouchsafe us shelter with a triple guard, these whom the strong have served in worship of the Gods.<br> 8 Potent, with firm-fixt laws, arranging sacrifice, visiting solemn rites in splendour of the day,<br> Obeying Order, these whose priest is Agni, free from falsehood, poured the waters out when Vṛtra died.<br> 9 The Holy Ones engendered, for their several laws, the heavens and earth, the waters, and the plants and trees.<br> They filled the firmament with heavenly light for help: the Gods embodied Wish and made it beautiful.<br> 10 May they who bear up heaven, the Ṛbhus deft of hand, and Vāta and Parjanya of the thundering Bull,<br> The waters and the plants, promote the songs we sing: come Bhaga, Rati, and the Vaijns to my call.<br> 11 Sindhu, the sea, the region, and the firmament, the thunder, and the ocean, Aja-Ekapād,<br> The Dragon of the Deep, shall listen to my words, and all the Deities and Princes shall give ear.<br> 12 May we, be yours, we men, to entertain the Gods: further our sacrifice and give it full success.<br> Ādityas, Rudras, Vasus, givers of good gifts, quicken the holy hymns which we are singing now<br> 13 I follow with success upon the path of Law the two celestial Hotars, Priests of oldest time.<br> We pray to him who dwelleth near, Guard of the Field, to all Immortal Gods who never are remiss.<br> 14 Vasiṣṭha's sons have raised their voices, like their sire. Ṛṣi-like praying to the Gods for happiness.<br> Like friendly-minded kinsmen, come at our desire, O Gods, and shake down treasures on us from above.<br> 15 Immortal Gods have I, Vasiṣṭha, lauded, Gods set on high above all other beings.<br> May they this day grant us wide space and freedom: ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
