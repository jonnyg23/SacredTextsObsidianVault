 <p>1. MIGHTY are ye, and far-extended, Heaven and Earth: both Worlds are evermore to us like two young Dames.<br> Guard us thereby from stronger foe; guard us hereby to give us strength.<br> 2 In each succeeding sacrifice that mortal honoureth the Gods,<br> He who, most widely known and famed for happiness, inviteth them.<br> 3 Ye who are Rulers over all, great is your sovran power as Gods.<br> Ye all possess all majesty: all must be served in sacrifice.<br> 4 These are the joyous Kings of Immortality, Parijman, Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa.<br> What else is Rudra, praised of men? the Maruts, Bhaga, Pūṣaṇa?<br> 5 Come also to our dwelling, Lords of ample wealth, common partakers of our waters, Sun and Moon,<br> When the great Dragon of the Deep hath settled down upon their floors.<br> 6 And let the Aśvins, Lords of splendour, set us free,both Gods, and, with their Laws, Mitra and Varuṇa.<br> Through woes, as over desert lands, he speeds to ample opulence.<br> 7 Yea, let the Aśvins Twain he gracious unto us, even Rudras, and all Gods, Bhaga, Rathaspati;<br> Parijman, Ṛbhu, Vāja, O Lords of all wealth Ṛbhukṣaṇas.<br> 8 Prompt is Ṛbhukṣan, prompt the worshipper's strong drink: may thy fleet Bay Steeds, thine who speedest on, approach.<br> Not mans but God's is sacrifice whose psalm is unassailable.<br> 9 O God Savitar, harmed by none, lauded, give us a place among wealthy princes.<br> With his Car-steeds at once 'hath our Indra guided the reins and the car of these men.<br> 10 To these men present here, O Heaven and Earth, to us grant lofty fame extending over all mankind.<br> Give us a steed to win us strength, a steed with wealth for victory.<br> 11 This speaker, Indrafor thou art our Friendwherever he may be, guard thou, Victor! for help, ever for help<br> Thy wisdom, Vasu! prosper him.<br> 12 So have they strengthened this mine hymn which seems to take its bright path to the Sun, and reconciles the men:<br> Thus forms a carpenter the yoke of horses, not to be displaced.<br> 13 Whose chariot-seat hath come again laden with wealth and bright with gold,<br> Lightly, with piercing ends, as twere two ranks of heroes ranged for fight.<br> 14 This to Duḥśīma Pṛthavāna have I sung, to Vena, Rama, to the nobles, and the King.<br> They yoked five hundred, and their love of us was famed upon their way.<br> 15 Besides, they showed us seven-and-seventy horses here.<br> Tānva at once displayed his gift, Pārthya at once displayed his gift; and straightway Māyava showed his.</p>
