 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XVII. Agni.</h3>  
 <p>1. GOD, may a mortal call the Strong hither, with solemn rites, to aid,<br> A man call Agni to protect when sacrifice is well prepared.<br> 2 Near him thou seemest mightier still in native glory, set to hold<br> Apart yon flame-hued vault of heaven, lovely beyond the thought of man.<br> 3 Yea, this is by the light of him whom powerful song hath bound to act,<br> Whose beams of splendour flash on high as though they sprang from heavenly seed.<br> 4 Wealth loads the Wonder-Worker's car through his, the very wise One's power.<br> Then, meet to be invoked among all tribes, is Agni glorified.<br> 5 Now, too, the princes shall obtain excellent riches by our lips.<br> Protect us for our welfare: lend thy succour, O thou Son of Strength. Be near in fight to prosper us.</p>
