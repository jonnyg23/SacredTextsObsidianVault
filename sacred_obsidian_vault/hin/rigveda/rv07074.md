 <p>1. THESE morning sacrifices call you, Aśvins, at the break of day.<br> For help have I invoked you rich in power and might: for, house by house ye visit all.<br> 2 O Heroes, ye bestow wonderful nourishment. send it to him whose songs are sweet<br> Accordant, both of you, drive your car down to us, and drink the savoury Soma juice.<br> 3 Approach ye and be near to us. drink, O ye Aśvins, of the meath.<br> Draw forth the milk, ye Mighty, rich in genuine wealth: injure us not, and come to us.<br> 4 The horses that convey you in their rapid flight down to the worshipper's abode,<br> With these your speedy coursers, Heroes, Aśvins, come, ye Gods, come well-inclined to us.<br> 5 Yea, verily, our princes seek the Aśvins in pursuit of food.<br> These shall give lasting glory to our liberal lords, and, both Nāsatyas, shelter us.<br> 6 Those who have led the way, like cars, offending none, those who are guardians of the men-<br> Also through their own might the heroes have grown strong, and dwell in safe and happy homes.</p>
