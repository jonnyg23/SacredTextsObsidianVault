 <p>1. BE gathered all the audience of the synod: let us begin their praise whose course is rapid.<br> Whateer God Savitar this day produces, may we be where the Wealthy One distributes.<br> 2 This, dealt from heaven ' may both the Worlds vouchsafe us, and Varuṇa, Indra, Aryaman, and Mitra.<br> May Goddess Aditi assign us riches, Vāyu and Bhaga make them ours for ever.<br> 3 Strong be the man and full of power, O Maruts, whom ye, borne on by spotted coursers, favour.<br> Him, too, Sarasvatī and Agni further, and there is none to rob him of his riches.<br> 4 This Varuṇa is guide of Law, he, Mitra, and Aryaman, the Kings, our work have finished.<br> Divine and foeless Aditi quickly listens. May these deliver us unharmed from trouble.<br> 5 With offerings I propitiate the branches of this swift-moving God, the bounteous Viṣṇu.<br> Hence Rudra gained his Rudra-strength: O Aśvins, ye sought the house that hath celestial viands.<br> 6 Be not thou angry here, O glowing Pūṣan, for what Varūtrī and the Bounteous gave us.<br> May the swift-moving Gods protect and bless us, and Vāta send us rain, wha wanders round us.<br> 7 Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas, and holy Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni.<br> May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
