 <p>1. ARAYI, one-eyed limping hag, fly, ever-screeching, to the hill.<br> We frighten thee away with these, the heroes of Sirimbitha.<br> 2 Scared from this place and that is she, destroyer of each germ unborn.<br> Go, sharp-horned Brāhmaṇaspti and drive Arayi far away.<br> 3 Yon log that floats without a man to guide it on the river's edge,<br> Seize it, thou thing with hideous jaws, and go thou far away thereon.<br> 4 When, foul with secret stain and spot, ye hastened onward to the breast,<br> All Indra's enemies were slain and passed away like froth and foam.<br> 5 These men have led about the cow, have duly carried Agni round,<br> And raised their glory tg the Gods. Who will attack them with success?</p>
