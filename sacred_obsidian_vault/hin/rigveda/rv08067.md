 <p>1. BRING us a thousand, Indra, as our guerdon for the Soma juice:<br> Hundreds of kine, O Hero, bring.<br> 2 Bring cattle, bring us ornament, bring us embellishment and steeds,<br> Give us, besides, two rings of gold.<br> 3 And, Bold One, bring in ample store rich jewels to adorn the ear,<br> For thou, Good Lord, art far renowned.<br> 4 None other is there for the priest, Hero! but thou, to give him gifts,<br> To win much spoil and prosper him.<br> 5 Indra can never be brought low, Śakra can never be subdued:<br> He heareth and beholdeth all.<br> 6 He spieth out the wrath of man, he who can never be deceived:<br> Ere blame can come he marketh it.<br> 7 He hath his stomach full of might, the Vṛtra-slayer, Conqueror,<br> The Soma-drinker, ordering all.<br> 8 In thee all treasures are combined, Soma all blessed things in thee,<br> Uninjured, easy to bestow.<br> 9 To thee speeds forth my hope that craves the gift of corn, and kine and gold,<br> Yea, craving horses, speeds to thee.<br> 10 Indra, through hope in thee alone even this sickle do I grasp.<br> Fill my hand, Maghavan, with all that it can hold of barley cut or gathered up.</p>
