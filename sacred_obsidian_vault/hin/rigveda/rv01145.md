 <p>1. Ask ye of him for he is come, he knoweth it; he, full of wisdom, is implored, is now implored.<br> With him are admonitions and with him commands: he is the Lord of Strength, the Lord of Power and Might.<br> 2 They ask of him: not all learn by their questioning what he, the Sage, hath grasped, as twere, with his own mind.<br> Forgetting not the former nor the later word, he goeth on, not careless, in his mental power.<br> 3 To him these ladles go, to him these racing mares: he only will give ear to all the words I speak.<br> All-speeding, victor, perfecter of sacrifice, the Babe with flawless help hath mustered vigorous might.<br> 4 Whateer he meets he grasps and then runs farther on, and straightway, newly born, creeps forward with his kin.<br> He stirs the wearied man to pleasure and great joy what time the longing gifts approach him as he comes.<br> 5 He is a wild thing of the flood and forest: he hath been laid upon the highest surface.<br> He hath declared the lore of works to mortals, Agni the Wise, for he knows Law, the Truthful.</p>
