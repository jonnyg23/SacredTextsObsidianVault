 <p>1. O THUNDERER, zealous worshippers gave thee drink this time yesterday.<br> So, Indra, listen here to those who bring the laud: come near unto our dwellingplace.<br> 2 Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed, rejoice thee: this we crave. Here the disposers wait on thee.<br> Thy loftiest glories claim our lauds beside the juice, O Indra, Lover of the Song.<br> 3 Turning, as twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all good things.<br> When he who will be born is born with power we look to treasures as our heritage.<br> 4 Praise him who sends us wealth, whose bounties injure none: good are the gifts which Indra. grants.<br> He is not worth with one who satisfies his wish: he turns his mind to giving boons.<br> 5 Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.<br> Father art thou, aIl-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor of the vanquisher.<br> 6 The Earth and Heaven clung close to thy victorious might as to their calf two mother-cows.<br> When thou attackest Vṛtra all the hostile bands shrink and faint, Indra, at thy wrath.<br> 7 Bring to your aid the Eternal One, who shoots and none may shoot at him,<br> Inciter, swift, victorious, best of Charioteers. Tugrya's unvanquished Strengthener;<br> 8 Arranger of things unarranged, een Śatakratu, source of might,<br> Indra, the Friend of all, for succour we invoke, Guardian of treasure, sendjng wealth.</p>
