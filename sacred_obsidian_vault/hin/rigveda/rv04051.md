 <p>1. FORTH from the darkness in the region eastward this most abundant splendid light hatb mounted.<br> Now verily the far-refulgent Mornings, Daughters of Heaven, bring welfare to the people.<br> 2 The richly-coloured Dawns have mounted eastward, like pillars planted at our sacrifices,<br> And, flushing far, splendid and purifying, unbarred the portals of the fold of darkness.<br> 3 Dispelling gloom this day the wealthy Mornings urge liberal givers to present their treasures.<br> In the unlightened depth of darkness round them let niggard traffickers sleep unawakened.<br> 4 O Goddesses, is this your car, I ask you, ancient this day, or is it new, ye Mornings,<br> Wherewith, rich Dawns, ye seek with wealth Navagva, Daśagva Aṅgira, the seven-toned singer?<br> 5 With horses harnessed by eternal Order, Goddesses, swiftly round the worlds ye travel,<br> Arousing from their rest, O Dawns, the sleeping, and all that lives, man, bird, and beast, to motion.<br> 6 Which among these is eldest, and where is she through whom they fixed the Ṛbhus' regulations?<br> What time the splendid Dawns go forth for splendour, they are not known apart, alike, unwasting.<br> 7 Blest were these Dawns of old, shining with succour, true with the truth that springs from holy Order;<br> With whom the toiling worshipper, by praises, hymning and lauding, soon attained to riches.<br> 8 Hither from eastward all at once they travel, from one place spreading in the selfsame manner.<br> Awaking, from the seat of holy Order the Godlike Dawns come nigh like troops of cattle.<br> 9 Thus they go forth with undiminished colours, these Mornings similar, in self-same fashion,<br> Concealing the gigantic might of darkness with radiant bodies bright and pure and shining.<br> 10 O Goddesses, O Heaven's refulgent Daughters, bestow upon us wealth with store of children.<br> As from our pleasant place of rest ye rouse us may we be masters of heroic vigour.<br> 11 Well-skilled in lore of sacrifice, ye Daughters of Heaven, refulgent Dawns, I thus address you.<br> May we be glorious among the people. May Heaven vouchsafe us this, and Earth the Goddess,</p>
