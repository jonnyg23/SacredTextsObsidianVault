 <p>1. EVEN as a car to give us aid, we draw thee hither for our bliss,<br> Strong in thy deeds, checking assault, Lord, Mightiest Indra, of the brave!<br> 2 Great in thy power and wisdom, Strong, with thought that comprehendeth all<br> Thou hast filled full with majesty.<br> 3 Thou very Mighty One, whose hands by virtue of thy greatness grasp,<br> The golden bolt that breaks its way.<br> 4 Your Lord of might that neer hath bent, that ruleth over all mankind,<br> I call, that he, as he is wont, may aid the chariots and the men.<br> 5 Whom, ever furthering, in frays that win the light, in both the hosts<br> Men call to succour and to help.<br> 6 Indra, the Strong, the measureless, worthy of praise, Most Bountiful,<br> Sole Ruler even over wealth.<br> 7 Him, for his ample bounty, him, this Indra do I urge to drink,<br> Who, as his praise was sung of old, the Dancer, is the Lord of men.<br> 8 Thou Mighty One, whose friendship none of mortals ever hath obtained<br> None will attain unto thy might.<br> 9 Aided by thee, with thee allied, in frays for water and for sun,<br> Bolt-armed! may we win ample spoil.<br> 10 So seek we thee with sacrifice and songs, chief Lover of the Song,<br> As, in our battles Indra, thou to Purumayya gavest help.<br> 11 O Thunderer, thou whose friendship and whose onward guidance both are sweet,<br> Thy sacrifice must be prepared.<br> 12 To us, ourselves, give ample room, give for our dwelling ample room<br> Give ample room to us to live.<br> 13 We count the banquet of the Gods a spacious pathway for the men,<br> And for the cattle, and the car.<br> 14 Six men, yea, two and two, made glad with Soma juice, come near to me<br> With offerings pleasant to the taste.<br> 15 Two brown-hued steeds, Indrota's gift, two bays from Rksa's son were mine,<br> From Asvamedha's son two red.<br> 16 From Atithigva good car-steeds; from Arksa rein-obeying steeds,<br> From Asvamedha beauteous ones.<br> 17 Indrota, Atithigva's son, gave me six horses matched with mares<br> And Patakratu gave besides.<br> 18 Marked above all, amid the brown, is the red mare Vṛṣanvati,<br> Obedient to the rein and whip.<br> 19 O bound to me by deeds of might, not even the man who loves to blame.<br> Hath found a single fault in you.</p>
