 <p>1. YOUR radiant Chariot-whither goes it on its way?-who decks it for you, Heroes, for its happy course,<br> Starting at daybreak, visiting each morning every house, borne hitherward through prayer unto the sacrifice?<br> 2 Where are ye, Aśvins, in the evening, where at morn? Where is your haltingplace, where rest ye for the night?<br> Who brings you homeward, as the widow bedward draws her husband's brother, as the bride attracts the groom?<br> 3 Early ye sing forth praise as with a herald's voice, and, meet for worship, go each morning to the house.<br> Whom do ye ever bring to ruin? Unto whose libations come ye, Heroes, like two Sons of Kings?<br> 4 Even as hunters follow two wild elephants, we with oblations call you down at morn and eve.<br> To folk who pay you offierings at appointed times, Chiefs, Lords of splendour, ye bring food to strengthen them.<br> 5 To you, O Aśvins, came the daughter of a King, Ghoṣā, and said, O Heroes, this I beg of you:<br> Be near me in the day, he near me in the night: help me to gain a car-borne chieftain rich in steeds.<br> 6 O Aśvins, ye are wise: as Kutsa comes to men, bring your car nigh the folk of him who sings your praise.<br> The bee, O Aśvins, bears your honey in her mouth, as the maid carries it purified in her hand.<br> 7 To Bhujyu and to Vaśa ye come near with help, O Aśvins, to Sinjara and to Uśanā.<br> Your worshipper secures your friendship for himself. Through your protection I desire felicity.<br> 8 Krsa and Śayu ye protect, ye Aśvins Twain: ye Two assist the widow and the worshipper;<br> And ye throw open, Aśvins, unto those who win the cattle-stall that thunders with its serenfold mouth.<br> 9 The Woman hath brought forth, the Infant hath appeared, the plants of wondrous beauty straightway have sprung up.<br> To him the rivers run as down a deep descent, and he this day becomes their master and their lord.<br> 10 They mourn the living, cry aloud, at sacrifice: the men have set their thoughts upon a distant cast.<br> A lovely thing for fathers who have gathered here,a joy to husbands,are the wives their arms shall clasp<br> 11 Of this we have no knowledge. Tall it forth to us, now the youth rests within the chambers of the bride.<br> Fain would we reach the dwelling of the vigorous Steer who loves the kine, O Aśvins: this is our desire.<br> 12 Your favouring grace hath come, ye Lords of ample wealth: Aśvins, our longings are stored up within your hearts.<br> Ye, Lords of splendour, have become our twofold guard: may we as welcome friends reach Aryaman's abode.<br> 13 Even so, rejoicing in the dwelling-place of man, give hero sons and riches to the eloquent.<br> Make a ford, Lords of splendour, where men well may drink: remove the spiteful tree-stump standing in the path.<br> 14 O Aśvins, Wonder-Workers, Lords of lustre, where and with what folk do ye delight yourselves to-day?<br> Who hath detained them with him? Whither are they gone? Unto what sage's or what worshipper's abode?</p>
