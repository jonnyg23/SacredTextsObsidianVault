 <p>1. WE have oerpassed the limit of this darkness while, worshipping the Gods, we sang their praises.<br> The song invoketh both Immortal Aśvins far-reaching, born of old, great WonderWorkers.<br> 2 And, O Nāsatyas, man's dear Priest is seated, who brings to sacrifice and offers worship,<br> Be near and taste the pleasant juice, O Aśvins: with food, I call you to the sacrifices.<br> 3 We choosing you, have let our worship follow its course: ye Steers, accept this hymn with favour.<br> Obeying you as your appointed servant, Vasiṣṭha singing hath with lauds aroused you.<br> 4 And these Two Priests come nigh unto our people, united, demon-slayers, mighty-handed.<br> The juices that exhilarate are mingled. Injure us not, but come with happy fortune.<br> 5 Come from the west, come from the cast, Nāsatyas, come, Aśvins, from below and from above us.<br> Bring wealth from all sides for the Fivefold People. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
