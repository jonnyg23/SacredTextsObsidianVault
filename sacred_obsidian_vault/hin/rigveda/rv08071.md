 <p>1. HASTE forward to us from afar, or, Vṛtra-slayer, from anear,<br> To meet the offering to the meath.<br> 2 Strong are the Soma-draughts; come nigh: the juices fill thee with delight:<br> Drink boldly even as thou art wont'.<br> 3 Joy, Indra, in the strengthening food et it content thy wish and thought,<br> And be delightful to thine heart.<br> 4 Come to us thou who hast no foe: we call thee down to hymns of praise,<br> In heaven's sublimest realm of light.<br> 5 This Soma here expressed with stones and dressed with milk for thy carouse,<br> Indra, is offered up to thee.<br> 6 Graciously, Indra, hear my call. Come and obtain the draught, and sate<br> Thyself with juices blent with milk.<br> 7 The Soma, Indra, which is shed in chalices and vats for thee,<br> Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof.<br> 8 The Soma seen within the vats, as in the flood the Moon is seen,<br> Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof.<br> 9 That which the Hawk brought in his claw, inviolate, through the air to thee,<br> Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof.</p>
