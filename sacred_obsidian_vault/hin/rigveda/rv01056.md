 <p>1 FOR this man's full libations held in ladles, he hath roused him, eager, as a horse to meet the mare.<br> He stays his golden car, yoked with Bay Horses, swift, and drinks the Soma juice which strengthens for great deeds.<br> 2 To him the guidance-following songs of praise flow full, as those who seek gain go in company to the flood.<br> To him the Lord of power, the holy synod's might, as to a hill, with speed, ascend the loving ones.<br> 3 Victorious, great is he; in manly battle shines, unstained with dust, his might, as shines a mountain peak;<br> Wherewith the iron one, fierce een against the strong, in rapture, fettered wily Śushṇa fast in bonds.<br> 4 When Strength the Goddess, made more strong for help by thee, waits upon Indra as the Sun attends the Dawn,<br> Then. he who with his might unflinching kills the gloom stirs up the dust aloft, with joy and triumphing.<br> 5 When thou with might, upon the framework of the heaven, didst fix, across, air's region firmly, unremoved,<br> In the light-winning war, Indra, in rapturous joy, thou smotest Vṛtra dead and broughtest floods of rain.<br> 6 Thou with thy might didst grasp, the holder-up of heaven, thou who art mighty also in the seats of earth.<br> Thou, gladdened by the juice, hast set the waters free, and broken Vṛtra's stony fences through and through.</p>
