To Mitra bring, with holy oil, oblation.<br> 2 Foremost be he who brings thee food, O Mitra, who strives to keep thy sacred Law, Āditya.<br> He whom thou helpest neer is slain or conquered, on him, from near or far, falls no affliction.<br> 3 joying in sacred food and free from sickness, with knees bent lowly on the earth's broad surface,<br> Following closely the Āditya's statute, may we remain in Mitra's gracious favour.<br> 4 Auspicious and adorable, this Mitra was born with fair dominion, King, Disposer.<br> May we enjoy the grace of him the Holy, yea, rest in his propitious loving-kindness.<br> 5 The great Āditya, to be served with wor. ship, who stirreth men, is gracious to the singer.<br> To Mitra, him most highly to be lauded, offer in fire oblation that he loveth.<br> 6 The gainful grace of Mitra,. God, supporter of the race of man,<br> Gives splendour of most.glorious fame.<br> 7 Mitra whose glory spreads afar, he who in might surpasses heaven,<br> Surpasses earth in his renown.<br> 8 All the Five Races have repaired to Mitra, ever strong to aid,<br> For he sustaineth all the Gods.<br> 9 Mitra to Gods, to living men, to him who strews the holy grass,<br> Gives food fulfilling sacred Law.</p>
