 <p>1 To drink the Soma, Agni, come, to our service and our songs.<br> With all these Gods; and worship them.<br> 2 The Kaṇvas have invoked thee; they, O Singer, sing thee songs of praise<br> Agni, come hither with the Gods;<br> 3 Indra, Vāyu, Bṛhaspati, Mitra, Agni, Pūṣan, Bhaga,<br> Ādityas, and the Marut host.<br> 4 For you these juices are poured forth that gladden and exhilarate,<br> The meath-drops resting in the cup.<br> 5 The sons of Kaṇva fain for help adore thee, having strewn the grass,<br> With offerings and all things prepared.<br> 6 Let the swift steeds who carry thee, thought-yoked and dropping holy oil,<br> Bring the Gods to the Soma draught.<br> 7 Adored, the strengtheners of Law, unite them, Agni, with their Dames:<br> Make them drink meath, O bright of tongue.<br> 8 Let them, O Agni, who deserve worship and praise drink with thy tongue<br> The meath in solemn sacrifice.<br> 9 Away, from the Sun's realm of light, the wise invoking Priest shall bring<br> All Gods awaking with the dawn.<br> 10 With all the Gods, with Indra, with Vāyu, and Mitra's splendours, drink,<br> Agni, the pleasant Soma juice.<br> 11 Ordained by Manu as our Priest, thou sittest, Agni, at each rite:<br> Hallow thou this our sacrifice.<br> 12 Harness the Red Mares to thy car, the Bays, O God, the flaming ones:<br> With those bring hitherward the Gods.</p>
