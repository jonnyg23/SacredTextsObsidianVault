 <p>1 Come, fain for booty let us seek to Indra: yet more shall he increase his care that guides us.<br> Will not the Indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this wealth, of cattle?<br> 2 I fly to him invisible Wealth-giver as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie,<br> With fairest hymns of praise adoring Indra, whom those who laud him must invoke in battle.<br> 3 Mid all his host, he bindeth on the quiver: he driveth cattle from what foe he pleaseth:<br> Gathering up great store of riches, Indra. be thou no trafficker with us, most mighty.<br> 4 Thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy Dasyu, alone, yet going with thy helpers, Indra!<br> Far from the floor of heaven in all directions, the ancient riteless ones fled to destruction.<br> 5 Fighting with pious worshippers, the riteless turned and fled, Indra! with averted faces.<br> When thou, fierce Lord of the Bay Steeds, the Stayer, blewest from earth and heaven and sky the godless.<br> 6 They met in fight the army of the blameless: then the Navagvas put forth all their power.<br> They, like emasculates with men contending, fled, conscious, by steep paths from Indra, scattered.<br> 7 Whether they weep or laugh, thou hast oerthrown them, O Indra, on the sky's extremest limit.<br> The Dasyu thou hast burned from heaven, and welcomed the prayer of him who pours the juice and lauds thee.<br> 8 Adorned with their array of gold and jewels, they oer the earth a covering veil extended.<br> Although they hastened, they oercame not Indra: their spies he compassed with the Sun of morning.<br> 9 As thou enjoyest heaven and earth, O Indra, on every side surrounded with thy greatness,<br> So thou with priests hast blown away the Dasyu, and those who worship not with those who worship.<br> 10 They who pervaded earth's extremest limit subdued not with their charms the Wealth-bestower:<br> Indra, the Bull, made his ally the thunder, and with its light milked cows from out the darkness.<br> 11 The waters flowed according to their nature; he raid the navigable streams waxed mighty.<br> Then Indra, with his spirit concentrated, smote him for ever with his strongest weapon.<br> 12 Indra broke through Ilībiśa's strong castles, and Śuṣṇa with his horn he cut to pieces:<br> Thou, Maghavan, for all his might and swiftness, slewest thy fighting foeman with thy thunder<br> 13 Fierce on his enemies fell Indra's weapon: with. his sharp bull he rent their forts in pieces.<br> He with his thunderbolt dealt blows on Vṛtra; and conquered, executing all his purpose.<br> 14 Indra, thou helpest Kutsa whom thou lovedst, and guardedst brave Daśadyu when he battled,<br> The dust of trampling horses rose to heaven, and Śvitrā's son stood up again for conquest.<br> 15 Śvitrā's mild steer, O Maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land, mid Tugra's houses.<br> Long stood they there before the task was ended: thou wast the master of the foemen's treasure.</p>
