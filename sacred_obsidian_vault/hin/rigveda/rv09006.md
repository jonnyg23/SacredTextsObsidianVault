 <p>1. SOMA, flow on with pleasant stream, a Bull devoted to the Gods,<br> Our Friend, unto the woollen sieve.<br> 2 Pour hitherward, as Indra's Self, Indu, that gladdening stream of thine,<br> And send us coursers full of strength.<br> 3 Flow to the filter hitherward, pouring that ancient gladdening juice,<br> Streaming forth power and high renown.<br> 4 Hither the sparkling drops have flowed, like waters down a steep descent<br> They have reached Indra purified.<br> 5 Whom, having passed the filter, ten dames cleanse, as twere a vigorous steed,<br> While he disports him in the wood,<br> 6 The steer-strong juice with milk pour forth, for feast and service of the Gods,<br> To him who bears away the draught.<br> 7. Effused, the God flows onward with his stream to Indra, to the God,<br> So that his milk may strengthen him.<br> 8 Soul of the sacrifice, the juice effused flows quickly on: he keeps<br> His ancient wisdom of a Sage.<br> 9 So pouring forth, as Indra's Friend, strong drink, best Gladdener! for the feast,<br> Thou, even in secret, storest hymns.</p>
