 <p>1 YE Aśvins, rich in treasure, Lords of splendour, having nimble hands,<br> Accept the sacrificial food.<br> 2 Ye Aśvins, rich in wondrous deeds, ye heroes worthy of our praise,<br> Accept our songs with mighty thought.<br> 3 Nāsatyas, wonder-workers, yours are these libations with clipt grass:<br> Come ye whose paths are red with flame.<br> 4 O Indra marvellously bright, come, these libations long for thee,<br> Thus by fine fingers purified.<br> 5 Urged by the holy singer, sped by song, come, Indra, to the prayers,<br> Of the libation-pouring priest.<br> 6 Approach, O Indra, hasting thee, Lord of Bay Horses, to the prayers.<br> In our libation take delight.<br> 7 Ye Viśvedevas, who protect, reward, and cherish men, approach<br> Your worshipper's drink-offering.<br> 8 Ye Viśvedevas, swift at work, come hither quickly to the draught,<br> As milch-kine hasten to their stalls.<br> 9 The Viśvedevas, changing shape like serpents, fearless, void of guile,<br> Bearers, accept the sacred draught<br> 10 Wealthy in spoil, enriched with hymns, may bright <a href="errata.htm#0">Sarasvatī</a> desire,<br> With eager love, our sacrifice.<br> 11 Inciter of all pleasant songs, inspirer of all gracious thought,<br> Sarasvatī accept our rite<br> 12 Sarasvatī, the mighty flood,she with her light illuminates,<br> She brightens every pious thought.</p>
