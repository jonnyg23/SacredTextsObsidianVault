 <p>1. GLORIFY thou Bṛhaspati, the scatheless, who must be praised with hymns, sweet-tongued and mighty,<br> To whom as leader of the song, resplendent, worthy of lauds, both Gods and mortals listen.<br> 2 On him wait songs according to the season even as a stream of pious men set moving.<br> Bṛhaspatifor he laid out the expanseswas, at the sacrifice, vast Mātariśvan.<br> 3 The praise, the verse that offers adoration, may he bring forth, as the Sun sends his arms out,<br> He who gives daily light through this God's wisdom, strong as a dread wild beast, and inoffensive.<br> 4 His song of praise pervades the earth and heaven: let the wise worshipper draw it, like a courser.<br> These of Bṛhaspati, like hunters' arrows, go to the skies that change their hue like serpents.<br> 5 Those, God, who count thee as a worthless bullock, and, wealthy sinners, live on thee the Bounteous,<br> On fools like these no blessing thou bestowest: Bṛhaspati, thou punishest the spiteful.<br> 6 Like a fair path is he, where grass is pleasant, though hard to win, a Friend beloved most early.<br> Those who unharmed by enemies behold us, while they would make them bare, stood closely compassed.<br> 7 He to whom songs of praise go forth like torrents, as rivers eddying under banks flow sea-ward<br> Bṛhaspati the wise, the eager, closely looks upon both, the waters and the vessel.<br> 8 So hath Bṛhaspati, great, strong and mighty, the God exceeding powerful, been brought hither.<br> May he thus lauded give us kine and horses. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
