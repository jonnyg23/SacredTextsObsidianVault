 <p>1. WATER and milk hath he endued, sent forth to thee: the men have drained him with the filters and the stones.<br> Drink, Indra, from the Hotar's bowlfirst right is thineSoma hallowed and poured with Vaṣaṭ and Svāhā.<br> 2 Busied with sacrifice, with spotted deer and spears, gleaming upon your way with ornaments, yea, our Friends,<br> Sitting on sacred grass, ye Sons of Bhārata, drink Soma from the Potar's bowl, O Men of heaven.<br> 3 Come unto us, ye swift to listen: as at home upon the sacred grass sit and enjoy yourselves.<br> And, Tvaṣṭar, well-content be joyful in the juice with Gods and Goddesses in gladsome company.<br> 4 Bring the Gods hither, Sage, and offer sacrifice: at the three altars seat thee willingly, O Priest.<br> Accept for thy delight the proffered Soma meath: drink from the Kindler's bowl and fill thee with thy share.<br> 5 This is the strengthener of thy body's manly might: strength, victory for all time are placed within thine arms.<br> Pressed for thee, Maghavan, it is offered unto thee: drink from the chalice of this Brahman, drink thy fill.<br> 6 Accept the sacrifice; mark both of you, my call: the Priest hath seated him after the ancient texts.<br> My prayer that bids them come goes forth to both the Kings: drink ye the Soma meath from the Director's bowl.</p>
