 <p>1. YE Vasus Twain, ye Rudras full of counsel, grant us, Strong Strengtheners, when ye stand beside us,<br> What wealth Aucathya craves of you, great Helpers when ye come forward with no niggard succour.<br> 2 Who may give you aught, Vasus, for your favour, for what, at the Cow's place, ye grant through worship?<br> Wake for us understanding full of riches, come with a heart that will fulfil our longing.<br> 3 As erst for Tugra's son your car, sea-crossing, strong, was equipped and set amid the waters,<br> So may I gain your shelter and protection as with winged course a hero seeks his army.<br> 4 May this my praise preserve Ucathya's offspring: let not these Twain who fly with wings exhaust me.<br> Let not the wood ten times up-piled consume me, when fixed for you it bites the ground it stands on.<br> 5 The most maternal streams, wherein the Dāsas cast me securely bound, have not devoured me.<br> When Traitana would cleave my head asunder, the Dāsa wounded his own breast and shoulders.<br> 6 Dīrghatamas the son of Mamatā hath come to length of days in the tenth age of human kind.<br> He is the Brahman of the waters as they strive to reach their end and aim: their charioteer is he.</p>
