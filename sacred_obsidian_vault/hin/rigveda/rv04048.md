 <p>1. TASTE offerings never tasted yet, as bards enjoy the foeman's wealth.<br> O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.<br> 2 Removing curses, drawn by teams, with Indra, seated by thy side,<br> O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.<br> 3 The two dark treasuries of wealth that wear<br> all beauties wait on thee.<br> O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.<br> 4 May nine-and-ninety harnessed steeds who yoke them at thy will bring thee.<br> O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.<br> 5 Harness, O Vāyu, to thy car a hundred well-fed tawny steeds,<br> Yea, or a thousand steeds, and let thy chariot come to us with might.</p>
