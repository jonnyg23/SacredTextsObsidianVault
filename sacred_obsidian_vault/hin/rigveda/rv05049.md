 <p>1. THIS day I bring God Savitar to meet you, and Bhaga who allots the wealth of mortals.<br> You, Aśvins, Heroes rich in treasures, daily seeking your friendship fain would I turn hither.<br> 2 Knowing full well the Asura's time of coming, worship God Savitar with hymns and praises.<br> Let him who rightly knoweth speak with homage to him who dealeth out man's noblest treasure.<br> 3 Not for reward doth Pūṣan send his blessings, Bhaga, or Aditi: his garb is splendour.<br> May Indra, Visniu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni produce auspicious days, the Wonder-Workers.<br> 4 Sending the shelter which we ask, the foeless Savitar and the Rivers shall approach us.<br> When I, the sacrifice's priest, invite them, may we he lords of wealth and rich possessions.<br> 5 They who devote such worship to the Vasus, singing their hymns to Varuṇa and Mitra,<br> Vouchsafe them ample room, far off be danger. Through grace of Heaven and Earth may we be happy.</p>
