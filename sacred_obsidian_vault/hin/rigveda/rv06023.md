 <p>1. THOU art attached to pressed-out Soma, Indra, at laud, at prayer, and when the hymn is chanted;<br> Or when with yoked Bays, Maghavan, thou comest, O Indra, bearing in thine arms the thunder.<br> 2 Or when on that decisive day thou holpest the presser of the juice at Vṛtra's slaughter;<br> Or when thou, while the strong one feared, undaunted, gavest to death, Indra, the daring Dasyus.<br> 3 Let Indra drink the pressed-out Soma, Helper and mighty Guide of him who sings his praises.<br> He gives the hero room who pours oblations, and treasure even to the lowly singer.<br> 4 Een humble rites with his Bay steeds he visits: he wields the bolt, drinks Soma, gives us cattle.<br> He makes the valiant rich in store of heroes, accepts our praise and hears the singer's calling.<br> 5 What he hath longed for we have brought to Indra, who from the days of old hath done us service.<br> While Soma flows we will sing hymn, and laud him, so that our prayer may streng. then Indra's vigour.<br> 6 Thou hast made prayer the means of thine exalting, therefore we wait on thee with hymns, O Indra.<br> May we, by the pressed Soma, Somadrinker! bring thee, with sacrifice, blissful sweet refreshment.<br> 7 Mark well our sacrificial cake, delighted Indra, drink Soma and the milk commingled.<br> Here on the sacrificer's grass be seated: give ample room to thy devoted servant.<br> 8 O Mighty One, be joyful as thou willest. Let these our sacrifices reach and find thee;<br> And may this hymn and these our invocations turn thee, whom many men invoke, to help us.<br> 9 Friends, when thejuices flow, replenish duly your own, your bounteous Indra with the Soma.<br> Will it not aid him to support us? Indra. spares him who sheds the juice to win his favour.<br> 10 While Soma flowed, thus Indra hath been lauded, Ruler of nobles, mid the Bharadvājas,<br> That Indra may become the singer's patron and give him wealth in every kind of treasure.</p>
