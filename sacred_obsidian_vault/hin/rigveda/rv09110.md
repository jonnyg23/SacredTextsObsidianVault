 <p>1. O'ERPOWERING Vṛtras, forward run to win great strength:<br> Thou speedest to subdue like one exacting debts.<br> 2 In thee, effused, O Soma, we rejoice ourselves for great supremacy in fight.<br> Thou, Pavamana, enterest into mighty deeds,<br> 3 O Pavamana, thou didst generate the Sun, and spread the moisture out with power,<br> Hasting to us with plenty vivified with milk.<br> 4 Thou didst produce him, Deathless God mid mortal men for maintenance of Law and lovely Amṛta:<br> Thou evermore hast moved making strength flow to us.<br> 5 All round about hast thou with glory pierced for us as twere a never-failing well for men to drink,<br> Borne on thy way in fragments from the presser's arms.<br> 6 Then, beautifully radiant, certain Heavenly Ones, have sung to him their kinship as they looked thereon,<br> And Savitar the God opens as twere a stall.<br> 7 Soma, the men of old whose grass was trimmed addressed the hymn to thee for mighty strength and for renown:<br> So, Hero, urge us onward to heroic power.<br> 8 They have drained forth from out the great depth of the sky the old primeval milk of heaven that claims the laud:<br> They lifted up their voice to Indra athis birth.<br> 9 As long as thou, O Pavamana, art above this earth and heaven and all existence in thy might,<br> Thou standest like a Bull the chief amid the herd.<br> 10 In the sheep's wool hath Soma Pavamana flowed, while they cleanse him, like a playful infant,<br> Indu with hundred powers and hundred currents.<br> 11 Holy and sweet, while purified, this Indu flows on, a wave of pleasant taste, to Indra,<br> Strength-winner, Treasure-finder, Life. bestower.<br> 12 So flow thou on, subduing our assailants, chasing the demons hard to beencountered,<br> Well-armed and conquering our foes, O Soma.</p>
