 <p>1. To Soma who is purified as ordering Priest the song is raised:<br> Bring meed, as twere, to one who makes thee glad with hymns.<br> 2 Blended with milk and curds he flows on through the long wool of the sheep.<br> The Gold-hued, purified, makes him three seats for rest.<br> 3 On through the long wool of the sheep to the meath-dropping vat he flows:<br> The Ṛṣis sevenfold quire hath sung aloud to him.<br> 4 Shared by all Gods, Infallible, the Leader of our holy hymns,<br> Golden-hued Soma, being cleansed, hath reached the bowls.<br> 5 After thy Godlike qualities, associate with Indra, go,<br> As a Priest purified by priests, Immortal One.<br> 6 Like a car-horse who shows his strength, a God effused for Deities.<br> The penetrating Pavamana flows along.</p>
