 <p>1. THE King whose face is decked with oil is kindled with homage offered by his faithful servant.<br> The men, the priests adore him with oblations. Agni hath shone forth when the dawn is breaking.<br> 2 Yea, he hath been acknowledged as most mighty, the joyous Priest of men, the youthful Agni.<br> He, spreading oer the earth, made light around him, and grew among the plants with blackened fellies..<br> 3 How dost thou decorate our hymn, O Agni? What power dost thou exert when thou art lauded?<br> When, Bounteous God, may we be lords of riches, winners of precious wealth which none may conquer?<br> 4 Far famed is this the Bhārata's own Agni he shineth like the Sun with lofty splendour.<br> He who hath vanquished Pūru in the battle, the heavenly guest hath glowed in full refulgence.<br> 5 Full many oblations are in thee collected: with all thine aspects thou hast waxen gracious.<br> Thou art already famed as praised and lauded, yet still, O nobly born, increase thy body.<br> 6 Be this my song, that winneth countless treasure, engendered with redoubled force for Agni,<br> That, splendid, chasing sickness, slaying demons, it may delight our friend and bless the singers.<br> 7 We, the Vasisthas, now implore thee, Agni, O Son of Strength, the Lord of wealth and riches.<br> Thou hast brought food to singers and to nobles. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
