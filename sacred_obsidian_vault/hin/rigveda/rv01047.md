 <p>1 AŚVINS, for you who strengthen Law this sweetest Soma hath been shed.<br> Drink this expressed ere yesterday and give riches to him who offers it.<br> 2 Come, O ye Aśvins, mounted on your triple car three-seated, beautiful of form<br> To you at sacrifice the Kaṇvas send the prayer: graciously listen to their call.<br> 3 O Aśvins, ye who strengthen Law, drink ye this sweetest Soma juice.<br> Borne on your wealth-fraught car come ye this day to him who offers, ye of wondrous deeds.<br> 4 Omniscient Aśvins, on the thrice-heaped grass bedew with the sweet juice the sacrifice.<br> The sons of Kaṇva, striving heavenward, call on you with draughts of Soma juice out-poured.<br> 5 O Aśvins, with those aids wherewith ye guarded Kaṇva carefully,<br> Keep us, O Lords of Splendour: drink the Soma juice, ye strengtheners of holy law.<br> 6 O Mighty Ones, ye gave Sudās abundant food, brought on your treasure-laden car;<br> So now vouchsafe to us the wealth which many crave, either from heaven or from the sea.<br> 7 Nāsatyas, whether ye be far away or close to Turvaśa,<br> Borne on your lightly-rolling chariot come to us, together with the sunbeams come.<br> 8 So let your coursers, ornaments of sacrifice, bring you to our libations here.<br> Bestowing food on him who acts and gives aright, sit, Chiefs, upon the sacred grass.<br> 9 Come, O Nāsatyas, on your car decked with a sunbright canopy,<br> Whereon ye ever bring wealth to the worshipper, to drink the Soma's pleasant juice.<br> 10 With lauds and songs of praise we call them down to us, that they, most rich, may succour us;<br> For ye have ever in the Kaṇvas' well-loved house, O Aśvins, drunk the Soma juice.</p>
