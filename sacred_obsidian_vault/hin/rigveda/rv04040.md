 <p>1. LET us recite the praise of Dadhikrāvan: may all the Mornings move me to exertion;<br> Praise of the Lord of Waters, Dawn, and Agni, Bṛhaspati Son of Aṅgiras, and Sūrya.<br> 2 Brave, seeking war and booty, dwelling with the good and with the swift, may he hasten the food of Dawn.<br> May he the true, the fleet, the lover of the course, the bird-like Dadhikrāvan, bring food, strength, and light.<br> 3 His pinion, rapid runner, fans him m his way, as of a bird that hastens onward to its aim,<br> And, as it were a falcon's gliding through the air, strikes Dadhikrāvan's side as he speeds on with might.<br> 4 Bound by the neck and by the flanks and by the mouth, the vigorous Courser lends new swiftness to his speed.<br> Drawing himself together, as his strength allows, Dadhikrās springs along the windings of the paths.<br> 5 The Haṁsa homed in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the priest beside the altar, in the house the guest,<br> Dweller in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born of flood, kine, truth, mountain, he is holy Law.</p>
