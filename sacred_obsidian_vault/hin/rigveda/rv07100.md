 <p>1 NEER doth the man repent, who, seeking profit, bringeth his gift to the far-striding Viṣṇu.<br> He who adoreth him with all his spirit winneth himself so great a benefactor.<br> 2 Thou, Viṣṇu, constant in thy courses, gavest good-will to all men, and a hymn that lasteth,<br> That thou mightst move us to abundant comfort of very splendid wealth with store of horses.<br> 3 Three times strode forth this God in all his grandeur over this earth bright with a hundred splendours.<br> Foremost be Viṣṇu, stronger than the strongest: for glorious is his name who lives for ever.<br> 4 Over this earth with mighty step strode Viṣṇu, ready to give it for a home to Manu.<br> In him the humble people trust for safety: he, nobly born, hath made them spacious dwellings.<br> 5 To-day I laud this name, O gipivista, I, skilled in rules, the name of thee the Noble.<br> Yea, I the poor and weak praise thee the Mighty who dwellest in the realm beyond this region.<br> 6 What was there to be blamed in thee, O Viṣṇu, when thou declaredst, I am Sipivista?<br> Hide not this form from us, nor keep it secret, since thou didst wear another shape in battle.<br> 7 O Viṣṇu, unto thee my lips cry Vaṣaṭ! Let this mine offering, Sipivista, please thee.<br> May these my songs of eulogy exalt thee. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
