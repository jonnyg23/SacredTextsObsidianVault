 <p>1. SONG-LOVER! like a charioteer come songs to thee when Soma flows.<br> O Indra, they have called to thee as mother-kine unto their calves.<br> 2 Bright juices bitherward have sped thee, Indra, Lover of the Song.<br> Drink, Indra, of this flowing sap: in every house tis set for thee.<br> 3 Drink Soma to inspirit thee, juice, Indra, which the Falcon brought:<br> For thou art King and Sovran Lord of all the families of men.<br> 4 O Indra, hear Tirasci's call, the call of him who serveth thee.<br> Satisfy him with wealth of kine and valiant offspring: Great art thou.<br> 5 For he, O Indra, hath produced for thee the newest gladdening song,<br> A hymn that springs from careful thought, ancient, and full of sacred truth.<br> 6 That Indra will we laud whom songs and hymns of praise have magnified.<br> Striving to win, we celebrate his many deeds of hero might.<br> 7 Come now and let us glorify pure Indra with pure Sāma hymns.<br> Let the pure milky draught delight him strengthened by pure songs of praise.<br> 8 O Indra, come thou pure to us, with pure assistance, pure thyself.<br> Pure, send thou riches down to us, and, meet for Soma, pure, be glad.<br> 9 O Indra, pure, vouchsafe us wealth, and, pure, enrich the worshipper.<br> Pure, thou dost strike the Vṛtras dead, and strivest, pure, to win the spoil.</p>
