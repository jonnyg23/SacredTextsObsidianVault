 <p>1. GODS, whatsoeer the Dove came hither seeking, sent to us as the envoy of Destruction,<br> For that let us sing hymns and make atonement. Well be it with our quadrupeds and bipeds.<br> 2 Auspicious be the Dove that hath been sent us, a harmless bird, ye Gods, within our dwelling.<br> May Agni, Sage, be pleased with our oblation, and may the Missile borne on wings avoid us.<br> 3 Let not the Arrow that hath wings distract us: beside the fire-place, on the hearth it settles.<br> May, it bring welfare to our men and cattle: here let the Dove, ye Gods, forbear to harm us.<br> 4 The screeching of the owl is ineffective and when beside the fire the Dove hath settled,<br> To him who sent it hither as an envoy, to him be reverence paid, to Death, to Yama.<br> 5 Drive forth the Dove, chase it with holy verses: rejoicing, bring ye hither food and cattle,<br> Barring the way against all grief and trouble. Let the swift bird fly forth and leave us vigour.</p>
