 <p>1. THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to the Kings Ādityas.<br> May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuṇa Dakṣa, and Aṁśa.<br> 2 With one accord may Aryaman and Mitra and Varuṇa this day accept this praise-song<br> Ādityas bright and pure as streams of water, free from all guile and falsehood, blameless, perfect.<br> 3 These Gods, Ādityas, vast, profound, and faithful, with many eyes, fain to deceive the wicked,<br> Looking within behold the good and evil near to the Kings is even the thing most distant.<br> 4 Upholding that which moves and that which moves not, Ādityas, Gods, protectors of all being,<br> Provident, guarding well the world of spirits, true to eternal Law, the debt-exactors.<br> 5 May I, Ādityas, share m this your favour which, Aryaman, brings profit een in danger.<br> Under your guidance, Varuṇa and Mitra, round troubles may I pass, like rugged places.<br> 6 Smooth is your path, O Aryaman and Mitra; excellent is it, Varuṇa, and thornless.<br> Thereon, Ādityas, send us down your blessing: grant us a shelter hard to be demolished.<br> 7 Mother of Kings, may Aditi transport us, by fair paths Aryaman, beyond all hatred.<br> May we uninjured, girt by many heroes, win Varuṇa's and Mitra's high protection.<br> 8 With their support they stay three earths, three heavens; three are their functions in the Gods assembly.<br> Mighty through Law, Ādityas, is your greatness; fair is it, Aryaman, Varuṇa, and Mitra.<br> 9 Golden and splendid, pure like streams of water, they hold aloft the three bright heavenly regions.<br> Neer do they slumber, never close their eyelids, faithful, far-ruling for the righteous mortal.<br> 10 Thou over all, O Varuṇa, art Sovran, be they Gods, Asura! or be they mortals.<br> Grant unto us to see a hundred autumns ours be the blest long lives of our forefathers.<br> 11 Neither the right nor left do I distinguish, neither the cast nor yet the west, Ādityas.<br> Simple and guided by your wisdom, Vasus! may I attain the light that brings no danger.<br> 12 He who bears gifts unto the Kings, true Leaders, he whom their everlasting blessings prosper,<br> Moves with his chariot first in rank and wealthy, munificent and lauded in assemblies.<br> 13 Pure, faithful, very strong, with heroes round him, he dwells beside the waters rich with pasture.<br> None slays, from near at hand or from a distance, him who is under the Ādityas guidance.<br> 14 Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa, forgive us however we have erred and sinned against you.<br> May I obtain the broad light free from peril: O Indra, let not during darkness seize us.<br> 15 For him the Twain united pour their fulness, the rain from heaven: he thrives most highly favoured.<br> He goes to war mastering both the mansions: to him both portions of the world are gracious.<br> 16 Your guiles, ye Holy Ones, to quell oppressors, your snares spread out against the foe, Ādityas,<br> May I car-borne pass like a skilful horseman: uninjured may we dwell in spacious shelter.<br> 17 May I not live, O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear friend's destitution.<br> King, may O never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
