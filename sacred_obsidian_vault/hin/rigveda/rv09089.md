 <p>1. THIS Chariot-horse hath moved along the pathways, and Pavamana flowed like rain from heaven.<br> With us hath Soma with a thousand currents sunk in the wood, upon his Mother's bosom.<br> 2. King, he hath clothed him in the robe of rivers, mounted the straightest-going ship of Order.<br> Sped by the Hawk the drop hath waxed in waters: the father drains it, drains the Father's offspring.<br> 3 They come to him, red, tawny, Lord of Heaven, the watchful Guardian of the meath, the Lion.<br> First, Hero in the fight, he seeks the cattle, and with his eye the Steer is our protector.<br> 4 They harness to the broad-wheeled car the mighty Courser whose back bears meath, unwearied, awful.<br> The twins, the sisters brighten him, and strengthen-these children of one damethe vigorous Racer.<br> 5 Four pouring out the holy oil attend him, sitting together in the same container.<br> To him they flow, when purified, with homage, and still, from every side, are first about him.<br> 6 He is the buttress of the heavens, supporter of earth, and in his hand are all the people.<br> Be the team's Lord a well to thee the singer: cleansed is the sweet plant's stalk for deed of glory.<br> 7 Fighting, uninjured come where Gods are feasted; Soma, as Vitra-slayer flow for Indra.<br> Vouchsafe us ample riches very splendid may we be masters of heroic vigour.</p>
