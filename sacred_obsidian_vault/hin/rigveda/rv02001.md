 <p>1. THOU, Agni, shining in thy glory through the days, art brought to life from out the waters, from the stone:<br> From out the forest trees and herbs that grow on ground, thou, Sovran Lord of men art <a href="errata.htm#8">generated</a> pure.<br> 2 Thine is the Herald's task and Cleanser's duly timed; Leader art thou, and Kindler for the pious man.<br> Thou art Director, thou the ministering Priest: thou art the Brahman, Lord and Master in our home.<br> 3 Hero of Heroes, Agni! Thou art Indra, thou art Viṣṇu of the Mighty Stride, adorable:<br> Thou, Brahmaṇaspati, the Brahman finding wealth: thou, O Sustainer, with thy wisdom tendest us.<br> 4 Agni, thou art King Varuṇa whose laws stand fast; as Mitra, Wonder-Worker, thou must be implored.<br> Aryaman, heroes' Lord, art thou, enriching all, and liberal Aṁśa in the synod, O thou God.<br> 5 Thou givest strength, as Tvaṣṭar, to the worshipper: thou wielding Mitra's power hast kinship with the Dames.<br> Thou, urging thy fleet coursers, givest noble steeds: a host of heroes art thou with great store of wealth.<br> 6 Rudra art thou, the Asura of mighty heaven: thou art the Maruts host, thou art the Lord of food,<br> Thou goest with red winds: bliss hast thou in thine home. As Pūṣan thou thyself protectest worshippers.<br> 7 Giver of wealth art thou to him who honours thee; thou art God Savitar, granter of precious things.<br> As Bhaga, Lord of men! thou rulest over wealth, and guardest in his house him who hath served thee well.<br> 8 To thee, the people's Lord within the house, the folk press forward to their King most graciously inclined.<br> Lord of the lovely look, all things belong to thee: ten, hundred, yea, a thousand are outweighed by thee.<br> 9 Agni, men seek thee as a Father with their prayers, win thee, bright-formed, to brotherhood with holy act.<br> Thou art a Son to him who duly worships thee, and as a trusty Friend thou guardest from attack.<br> 10 A Ṛbhu art thou, Agni, near to be adored thou art the Sovran Lord of foodful spoil and wealth.<br> Thou shinest brightly forth, thou burnest to bestow: pervading sacrifice, thou lendest us thine help.<br> 11 Thou, God, art Aditi to him who offers gifts: thou, Hotrā, Bhāratī, art strengthened by the song.<br> Thou art the hundred-wintered Iḷā to give strength, Lord of Wealth! Vṛtra-slayer and Sarasvatī.<br> 12 Thou, Agni, cherished well, art highest vital power; in thy delightful hue are glories visible.<br> Thou art the lofty might that furthers each design: thou art wealth manifold, diffused on every side.<br> 13 Thee, Agni, have the Ādityas taken as their mouth; the Bright Ones have made thee, O Sage, to be their tongue.<br> They who love offerings cling to thee at solemn rites: by thee the Gods devour the duly offered food.<br> 14 By thee, O Agni, all the Immortal guileless Gods cat with thy mouth the oblation that is offered them.<br> By thee do mortal men give sweetness to their drink. Bright art thou born, the embryo of the plants of earth.<br> 15 With these thou art united, Agni; yea thou, God of noble birth, surpassest them in majesty,<br> Which, through the power of good, here spreads abroad from thee, diffused through both the worlds, throughout the earth and heaven.<br> 16 The princely worshippers who send to those who sing thy praise, O Agni, guerdon graced with kine and steeds,<br> Lead thou both these and us forward to higher bliss. With brave men in the assembly may we speak aloud.</p>
