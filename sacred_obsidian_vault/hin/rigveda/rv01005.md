 <p>1 O COME ye hither, sit ye down: to Indra sing ye forth, your song,<br> companions, bringing hymns of praise.<br> 2 To him the richest of the rich, the Lord of treasures excellent,<br> Indra, with Soma juice outpoured.<br> 3 May he stand by us in our need and in abundance for our wealth:<br> May he come nigh us with his strength.<br> 4 Whose pair of tawny horses yoked in battles foemen challenge not:<br> To him, to Indra sing your song.<br> 5 Nigh to the Soma-drinker come, for his enjoyment, these pure drops,<br> The Somas mingled with the curd.<br> 6 Thou, grown at once to perfect strength, wast born to drink the Soma juice,<br> Strong Indra, for preëminence.<br> 7 O Indra, lover of the song, may these quick Somas enter thee:<br> May they bring bliss to thee the Sage.<br> 8 Our chants of praise have strengthened thee, O Śatakratu, and our lauds<br> So strengthen thee the songs we sing.<br> 9 Indra, whose succour never fails, accept these viands thousandfold,<br> Wherein all manly powers abide.<br> 10 O Indra, thou who lovest song, let no man hurt our bodies, keep<br> Slaughter far from us, for thou canst.</p>
