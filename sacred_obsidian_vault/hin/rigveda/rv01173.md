 <p>1. THE praise-song let him sing forth bursting bird-like: sing we that hymn which like heaven's light expandeth,<br> That the milk-giving cows may, unimpeded call to the sacred grass the Gods assembly.<br> 2 Let the Bull sing with Bulls whose toil is worship, with a loud roar like some wild beast that hungers.<br> Praised God! the glad priest brings his heart's devotion; the holy youth presents twofold oblation.<br> 3 May the Priest come circling the measured stations, and with him bring the earth's autumnal fruitage.<br> Let the Horse neigh led near, let the Steer bellow: let the Voice go between both worlds as herald,<br> 4 To him we offer welcomest oblations, the pious bring their strength-inspiring praises.<br> May Indra, wondrous in his might, accept them, car-borne and swift to move like the Nāsatyas.<br> 5 Praise thou that Indra who is truly mighty, the car-borne Warrior, Maghavan the Hero;<br> Stronger in war than those who fight against him, borne by strong steeds, who kills enclosing darkness;<br> 6 Him who surpasses heroes in his greatness: the earth and heavens suffice not for his girdles.<br> Indra endues the earth to be his garment, and, God-like, wears the heaven as twere a frontlet,<br> 7 Thee, Hero, guardian of the brave in battles, who roamest in the van,to draw thee hither,<br> Indra, the hosts agree beside the Soma, and joy, for his great actions, in the Chieftain.<br> 8 Libations in the sea to thee are pleasant, when thy divine Floods come to cheer these people.<br> To thee the Cow is sum of all things grateful when with the wish thou seekest men and princes.<br> 9 So may we in this One be well befriended, well aided as it were through praise of chieftains,<br> That Indra still may linger at our worship, as one led swift to work, to hear our praises.<br> 10 Like men in rivalry extolling princes, our Friend be Indra, wielder of the thunder.<br> Like true friends of some city's lord within them held in good rule with sacrifice they help him.<br> 11 For every sacrifice makes Indra stronger, yea, when he goes around angry in spirit;<br> As pleasure at the ford invites the thirsty, as the long way brings him who gains his object.<br> 12 Let us not here contend with Gods, O Indra, for here, O Mighty One, is thine own portion,<br> The Great, whose Friends the bounteous Maruts honour, as with a stream, his song who pours oblations.<br> 13 Addressed to thee is this our praise, O Indra: Lord of Bay Steeds, find us hereby advancement.<br> So mayst thou lead us on, O God, to comfort. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
