 <p>1. SIT down, O friends, and sing aloud to him who purifies himself:<br> Deck him for glory, like a child, with holy rites.<br> 2 Unite him bringing household wealth, even as a calf, with mother kine,<br> Him who hath double strength, the God, delighting juice.<br> 3 Purify him who gives us power, that he, most Blessed One, may be<br> A banquet for the Troop, Mitra, and Varuṇa.<br> 4 Voices have sung aloud to thee as finderout of wealth for us:<br> We clothe the hue thou wearest with a robe of milk.<br> 5 Thou, Indu, art the food of Gods, O Sovran of all gladdening drinks:<br> As Friend for friend, be thou best finder of success.<br> 6 Drive utterly away from us each demon, each voracious fiend,<br> The godless and the false: keep sorrow far away.</p>
