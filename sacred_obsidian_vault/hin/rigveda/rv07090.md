 <p>1. To you pure juice, rich in meath, are offered by priest: through longing for the Pair of Heroes.<br> Drive, Vāyu, bring thine harnessed horses hither: drink the pressed Soma till it make thee joyful.<br> 2 Whoso to thee, the Mighty, brings oblation, pure Soma unto thee, pure-drinking Vāyu,<br> That man thou makest famous among mortals: to him strong sons are born in quick succession.<br> 3 The God whom both these worlds brought forth for riches, whom heavenly Dhiṣaṇā for our wealth appointeth,<br> His team of harnessed horses waits on Vāyu, and, foremost, on the radiant Treasure-bearer.<br> 4 The spotless Dawns with fair bright days have broken; they found the spacious light when they were shining.<br> Eagerly they disclosed the stall of cattle: floods streamed for them as in the days aforetime.<br> 5 These with their truthful spirit, shining brightly, move on provided with their natural insight.<br> Viands attend the car that beareth Heroes, your car, ye Sovran Pair, Indra and Vāyu.<br> 6 May these who give us heavenly light, these rulers, with gifts of kine and horses, gold and treasures.<br> These princes, through full life, Indra and Vāyu! oercome in battle with their steeds and heroes.<br> 7 Like coursers seeking fame will we Vasisthas, O Indra-Vāyu, with our fair laudations.<br> Exerting all our power call you to aid us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
