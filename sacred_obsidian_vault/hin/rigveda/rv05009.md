 <p>1. BEARING; oblations mortal men, O Agni, worship thee the God.<br> I deem thee Jātavedas: bear our offerings, thou, unceasingly.<br> 2 In the man's home who offers gifts, where grass is trimmed, Agni is Priest,<br> To whom all sacrifices come and strengthenings that win renown.<br> 3 Whom, as an infant newly-born, the kindling-sticks have brought to life,<br> Sustainer of the tribes of men, skilled in well-ordered sacrifice.<br> 4 Yea, very hard art thou to grasp, like offspring of the wriggling snakes,<br> When thou consumest many woods like an ox, Agni, in the mead.<br> 5 Whose flames, when thou art sending forth the smoke, completely reach the mark,<br> When Tṛta in the height of heaven, like as a smelter fanneth thee, een as a smelter sharpeneth thee.<br> 6 O Agni, by thy succour and by Mitra's friendly furtherance,<br> May we, averting hate, <a href="errata.htm#17">subdue</a> the wickedness of mortal men.<br> 7 O Agni, to our heroes bring such riches, thou victorious God.<br> May he protect and nourish us, and help in gaining strength: be thou near us in fight for our success.</p>
