 <p>1. THE Cow, the famous Mother of the wealthy Maruts, pours her milk:<br> Both horses of the cars are yoked,<br> 2 She in whose bosom all the Gods, and Sun and Moon for men to see,<br> Maintain their everlasting Laws.<br> 3 This all the pious sing to us, and sacred poets evermore:<br> The Maruts to the Soma-draught<br> 4 Here is the Soma ready pressed of this the Maruts drink, of this<br> Self-luminous the Aśvins drink.<br> 5 Of this, moreover, purified, set in three places, procreant,<br> Drink Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.<br> 6 And Indra, like the Herald Priest, desirous of the milky juice,<br> At early morn will quaff thereof.<br> 7 When have the Princes gleamed and shone through waters as through troops of foes'?<br> When hasten they whose might ispure?<br> 8 What favour do I claim this day of you<br> great Deities, you who are<br> Wondrously splendid in yourselves?<br> 9 1 call, to drink the Soma, those Maruts who spread all realms of earth<br> And luminous regions of the sky.<br> 10 You, even such, pure in your might, you, O ye Maruts, I invoke<br> From heaven to drink this Somajuice.<br> 11 The Maruts, those who have sustained and propped the heavens and earth apart,<br> I call to drink this Soma juice.<br> 12 That vigorous band of Maruts that abidetb in the mountains, I<br> Invoke to drink this Soma juice.</p>
