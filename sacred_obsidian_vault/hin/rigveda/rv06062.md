 <p>1. I LAUD the Heroes Twain, this heaven's Controllers: singing with songs of praise I call the Aśvins,<br> Fain in a moment, when the morns are breaking, to part the earth's ends and the spacious regions.<br> 2 Moving to sacrifice through realms of lustre they light the radiance of the car that bears them.<br> Traversing many wide unmeasured spaces, over the wastes ye pass, and fields, and waters.<br> 3 Ye to that bounteous path of yours, ye mighty, have ever borne away our thoughts with horses,<br> Mind-swift and full of vigour, that the trouble of man who offers gifts might cease and slumber.<br> 4 So ye, when ye have yoked your chariothorses, come to the hymn of the most recent singer.<br> Our true and ancient Herald Priest shall bring you, the Youthful, bearing splendour, food, and vigour.<br> 5 With newest hymn I call those Wonder-Workers, ancient and brilliant, and exceeding mighty,<br> Bringers of bliss to him who lauds and praises, bestowing varied bounties on the singer.<br> 6 So ye, with birds, out of the sea and waters bore Bhujyu, son of Tugra, through the regions.<br> Speeding with winged steeds through dustless spaces, out of the bosom of the flood they bore him.<br> 7 Victors, car-borne, ye rent the rock asunder: Bulls, heard the calling of the eunuch's consort.<br> Bounteous, ye filled the cow with milk for Śayu: thus, swift and zealous Ones, ye showed your favour.<br> 8 Whateer from olden time, Heaven, Earth! existeth great object of the wrath of Gods and mortals,<br> Make that, Ādityas, Vasus, sons of Rudra, an evil brand to one allied with demons.<br> 9 May he who knows, as Varuṇa and Mitra, air's realm, appointing both the Kings in season,<br> Against the secret fiend cast forth his weapon, against the lying words that strangers utter.<br> 10 Come to our home with friendly wheels, for offipring; come on your radiant chariot rich in heroes.<br> Strike off, ye Twain, the heads of our assailants who with man's treacherous attack approach us.<br> 11 Come hitherward to us with teams of horses, the highest and the midmost and the lowest.<br> Bountiful Lords, throw open to the singer doors een of the firm-closed stall of cattle.</p>
