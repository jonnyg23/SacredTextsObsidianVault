 <p>1. A HOME is made for thee to dwell in, Indra: O Much-invoked, go thitherwith the heroes.<br> That thou, to prosper us, mayst be our Helper, vouchsafe us wealth, rejoice with draughts of Soma.<br> 2 Indra, thy wish, twice-strong, is comprehended: pressed is the Soma, poured are pleasant juices.<br> This hymn of praise, from loosened tongue, made perfect, draws Indra to itself with loud invoking.<br> 3 Come, thou Impetuous; God, from earth or heaven; come to our holy grass to drink the Soma.<br> Hither to me let thy Bay Horses bring thee to listen to our hymns and make thee joyful.<br> 4 Come unto us with all thine aids, accordant, Lord of Bay Steeds, accepting our devotions,<br> Fair-helmeted, oercoming with the mighty, and lending us the strength of bulls, O Indra.<br> 5 As to the chariot pole a vigorous courser, this laud is brought to the great strong Upholder.<br> This hymn solicits wealth of thee: in heaven, as twere above the sky, set thou our glory.<br> 6 With precious things. O Indra, thus content us: may we attain to thine exalted favour.<br> Send our chiefs plenteous food with hero children. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
