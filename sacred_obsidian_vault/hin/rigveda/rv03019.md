 <p>1. AGNI, quick, sage, infallible, all-knowing, I choose to be our Priest at this oblation.<br> In our Gods service he, best skilled, shall worship: may he obtain us boons for strength and riches.<br> 2 Agni, to thee I lift the oil-fed ladle, bright, with an offering, bearing our oblation.<br> From the right hand, choosing the Gods attendance, he with rich presents hath arranged the worship.<br> 3 Of keenest spirit is the man thou aidest give us good offspring, thou who givest freely.<br> In power of wealth most rich in men. O Agni, of thee, the Good, may we sing forth fair praises.<br> 4 Men as they worship thee the God, O Agni, have set on thee full many a brilliant, aspect.<br> So bring Most Youthful One, the Gods assembly, the Heavenly Host which thou to-day shalt honour.<br> 5 When Gods anoint thee Priest at their oblation, and seat thee for thy task as Sacrificer,<br> O Agni, be thou here our kind defender, and to ourselves vouchsafe the gift of glory.</p>
