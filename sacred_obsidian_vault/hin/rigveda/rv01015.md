 <p>1 O INDRA drink the Soma juice with Ṛtu; let the cheering drops<br> Sink deep within, which settle there.<br> 2 Drink from the Purifier's cup, Maruts, with Ṛtu; sanctify<br> The rite, for ye give precious gifts.<br> 3 O Neṣṭar, with thy Dame accept our sacrifice; with Ṛtu drink,<br> For thou art he who giveth wealth.<br> 4 Bring the Gods, Agni; in the three appointed places set them down:<br> Surround them, and with Ṛtu drink.<br> 5 Drink Soma after the Ṛtus, from the Brāhmaṇa's bounty: undissolved,<br> O Indra, is thy friendship's bond.<br> 6 Mitra, Varuṇa, ye whose ways are firma Power that none deceives,<br> With Ṛtu ye have reached the rite.<br> 7 The Soma-pressers, fain for wealth, praise the Wealth-giver in the rite,<br> In sacrifices praise the God.<br> 8 May the Wealth-giver grant to us riches that shall be far renowned.<br> These things we gain, among the Gods.<br> 9 He with the Ṛtu fain would drink, Wealth-giver, from the Neṣṭar's bowl.<br> Haste, give your offering, and depart.<br> 10 As we this fourth time, Wealth-giver, honour thee with the Ṛtus, be<br> A Giver bountiful to us.<br> 11 Drink ye the meath, O Aśvins bright with flames, whose acts are pure, who with<br> Ṛtus accept the sacrifice.<br> 12 With Ṛtu, through the house-fire, thou, kind Giver, guidest sacrifice:<br> Worship the Gods for the pious man.</p>
