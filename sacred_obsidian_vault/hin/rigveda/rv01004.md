 <p>1 As a good cow to him who milks, we call the doer of fair deeds,<br> To our assistance day by day.<br> 2 Come thou to our libations, drink of Soma; Soma-drinker thou!<br> The rich One's rapture giveth kine.<br> 3 So may we be acquainted with thine innermost benevolence:<br> Neglect us not, come hitherward.<br> 4 Go to the wise unconquered One, ask thou of Indra, skilled in song,<br> Him who is better than thy friends.<br> 5 Whether the men who mock us say, Depart unto another place,<br> Ye who serve Indra and none else;<br> 6 Or whether, God of wondrous deeds, all our true people call us blest,<br> Still may we dwell in Indra's care.<br> 7 Unto the swift One bring the swift, man-cheering, grace of sacrifice,<br> That to the Friend gives wings and joy.<br> 8 Thou, Śatakratu, drankest this and wast the Vṛtras slayer; thou<br> Helpest the warrior in the fray.<br> 9 We strengthen, Śatakratu, thee, yea, thee the powerful in fight,<br> That, Indra, we may win us wealth.<br> 10 To him the mighty stream of wealth, prompt friend of him who pours the juice,<br> Yea, to this Indra sing your song.</p>
