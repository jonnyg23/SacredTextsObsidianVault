 <p>1. RUN onward to the reservoir and seat thee: cleansed by the men speed forward to the battle.<br> Making thee beauteous like an able courser, forth to the sacred grass with reins they lead thee.<br> 2 Indu, the well-armed God, is flowing onward, who quells the curse and guards from treacherous onslaught,<br> Father, begetter of the Gods, most skilful, the buttress of the heavens and earth's supporter.<br> 3. Ṛṣi and Sage, the Champion of the people, cleft and sagacious, Uśanā in wisdom,<br> He hath discovered even their hidden nature, the Cows' concealed and most mysterious title.<br> 4 This thine own Soma rich in meath, O Indra, Steer for the Steer, hath flowed into the filter.<br> The strong Free-giver, winning hundreds, thousands, hath reached the holy grass that never fails him.<br> 5 These Somas are for wealth of countless cattle, renown therefor, and mighty strength immortal.<br> These have been sent forth, urified by strainers, like steeds who rusg to battle fain for glory.<br> 6 He, while he cleanses him, invoked of many, hath flowed to give the people all enjoyment.<br> Thou whom the Falcon brought, bring, dainty viands, bestir thyself and send us wealth and booty.<br> 7 This Soma, pressed into the cleansing filter, hath run as twere a host let loose, the Courser;<br> Like a strong bull who whets his horns kpen-pointed, like a brave warrior in the fray for cattle.<br> 8 He issued forth from out the loftiest mountain, and found kine hidden somewhere in a stable.<br> Soma's stream clears itself for thee, O Indra, like lightning thundering through the clouds of heaven,<br> 9 Cleansing thyselr, and borne along with Indra, Soma, thou goest round the herd of cattle.<br> May thy praise help us, Mighty One, prompt Giver, to the full ample food which thou bestowest.</p>
