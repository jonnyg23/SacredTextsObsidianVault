 <p>1. THY right hand have we grasped in ours, O Indra, longing for treasure, Treasure-Lord of treasures!<br> Because we know thee, Hero, Lord of cattle: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.<br> 2 Wealth, fully armed, good guard and kind protector, sprung from four seas, the prop and stay of treasures,<br> Fraught with great bounties, meet for praise and glory; vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.<br> 3 Wealth, with good Brahmans, Indra! God-attended, high, wide, and deep, arid based on broad foundations,<br> Strong, with famed Ṛṣis, conquering our foemen: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.<br> 4 Victorious, winning strength, with hero sages, confirmed in power, most useful, wealth-attracting,<br> True, Indra! crushing forts and slaying Dasyus: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.<br> 5 Wealthy in heroes and in cars and horses, strength hundredfold and thousandfold, O Indra,<br> With manly sages, happy troops, Iight-winning: vouchsafe us mighty and resplentdent riches.<br> 6 To Saptagu the sage, the holy-minded, to him, Bṛhaspati, the song approaches,<br> Aṅgiras' Son who must be met with homage: vouchsafe us mighty and reslendent riches.<br> 7 My lauds, like envoys, craving loving-kindness, go forth to Indra with their strong entreaty,<br> Moving his heart and uttered by my spirit: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.<br> 8 Grant us the boon for which I pray, O Indra, a spacious home unmatched among the people.<br> To this may Heaven and Earth accord approval: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.</p>
