 <p>1 THIS is that Agni whence the longing Indra took the pressed Soma deep within his body.<br> Winner of spoils in thousands, like a courser, with praise art thou exalted, Jātavedas.<br> 2 That light of thine in heaven and earth, O Agni, in plants, O Holy One, and in the waters,<br> Wherewith thou hast spread wide the air's mid-region-bright is that splendour, wavy, man-beholding.<br> 3 O Agni, to the sea of heaven thou goest: thou hast called hither Gods beheld in spirit.<br> The waters, too, come hither, those up yonder in the Sun's realm of light, and those beneath it.<br> 4 Let fires that dwell in mist, combined with those that have their home in floods,<br> Guileless accept our sacrifice, great viands free from all disease.<br> 5 Agni, as holy food to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels.<br> To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-ward.</p>
