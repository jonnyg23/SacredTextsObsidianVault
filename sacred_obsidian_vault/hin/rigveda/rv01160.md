 <p>1. THESE, Heaven and Earth, bestow prosperity on all, sustainers of the region, Holy Ones and wise,<br> Two Bowls of noble kind: between these Goddesses the God, the fulgent Sun, travels by fixed decree.<br> 2 Widely-capacious Pair, mighty, that never fail, the Father and the Mother keep all creatures safe:<br> The two world-halves, the spirited, the beautiful, because the Father hath clothed them in goodly forms.<br> 3 Son of these Parents, he the Priest with power to cleanse, Sage, sanctifies the worlds with his surpassing power.<br> Thereto for his bright milk he milked through all the days the party-coloured Cow and the prolific Bull.<br> 4 Among the skilful Gods most skilled is he, who made the two world-halves which bring prosperity to all;<br> Who with great wisdom measured both the regions out, and stablished them with pillars that shall neer decay.<br> 5 Extolled in song, O Heaven and Earth, bestow on us, ye mighty Pair, great glory and high lordly sway,<br> Whereby we may extend ourselves ever over the folk; and send us strength that shall deserve the praise of men.</p>
