 <p>1. ALLIED with thee in friendship, Indra, these, thy priests, remembering Holy Law, rent Vṛtra limb from limb,<br> When they bestowed the Dawns and let the waters flow, and when thou didst chastise dragons at Kutsa's call.<br> 2 Thou sentest forth productive powers, clavest the hills, thou dravest forth the kine, thou drankest pleasant meath.<br> Thou gavest increase through this Tree's surpassing might. The Sun shone by the hymn that sprang from Holy Law.<br> 3 In the mid-way of heaven the Sun unyoked his car: the Ārya found a match to meet his Dam foe.<br> Associate with Ṛjiśvan Indra overthrew the solid forts of Pipru, conjuring Asura.<br> 4 He boldly cast down forts which none had eer assailed: unwearied he destroycd the godless treasure-stores.<br> Like Sun and Moon he took the stronghold's wealth away, and, praised in song, demolished foes with flashing dart.<br> 5 Armed with resistless weapons, with vast power to cleave, the Vṛtra-slayer whets his darts and deals fordi wounds.<br> Bright Uṣas was afraid of Indra's slaughtering bolt: she went upon her way and left her chariot there.<br> 6 These are thy famous exploits, only thine, when thou alone hast left the other reft of sacrifice.<br> Thou in the heavens hast set the ordering of the Moons: the Father bears the felly portioned out by thee.</p>
