 <p>1. YE Aśvins, hither come to us: Nāsatyas, be not disinclined.<br> Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.<br> 2 O Aśvins, like a pair of deer, like two wild cattle to the mead:<br> Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.<br> 3 O Aśvins rich in gifts, accept our sacrifice to prosper it:<br> Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.<br> 4 As Atri when descending to the cavern called on you loudly like a wailing woman.<br> Ye came to him, O Aśvins, with the freshest and most auspicious fleetness of a falcon.<br> 5 Tree, part asunder like the side of her who bringeth forth a child.<br> Ye Aśvins, listen to my call: loose Saptavadhri from his bonds.<br> 6 For Saptavadhri, for the seer affrighted when he wept and wailed,<br> Ye, Aśvins, with your magic powers rent up the tree and shattered it.<br> 7 Like as the wind on every side ruffles a pool of lotuses,<br> So stir in thee the babe unborn, so may the ten-month babe descend.<br> 8 Like as the wind, like as the wood, like as the sea is set astir,<br> So also, ten-month babe, descend together with the after-birth.<br> 9 The child who hath for ten months' time been lying in his mother's side,<br> May he come forth alive, unharmed, yea, living from the living dame.</p>
