 <p>1. WHEN beauties strive for him as for a charger, then strive the songs like soldiers for the sunlight.<br> Acting the Sage, he flows enrobed in waters and song as twere a stall that kine may prosper.<br> 2 The worlds expand to hirn who from aforetime found light to spread the law of life eternal.<br> The swelling songs, like kine within the stable, in deep devotion call aloud on Indu.<br> 3 When the sage bears his holy wisdom round him, like a car visiting all worlds, the Hero,<br> Becoming fame, mid Gods, unto the mortal, wealth to the skilled, worth praise mid the Ever-present,<br> 4 For glory born be hath come forth to glory: he giveth life and glory to the singers.<br> They, clothed in glory, have become immortal. He, measured in his course, makes frays successful.<br> 5 Stream to us food and vigour, kine and horses: give us broad lights and fill thGods with rapture.<br> All ther are easy things for thee to master thou, Pavamana Soma, quellest foemen.</p>
