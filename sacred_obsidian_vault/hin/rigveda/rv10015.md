 <p>1. MAY they ascend, the lowest, highest, midmost, the Fathers who deserve a share of Soma-<br> May they who have attained the life of spirits, gentle and righteous, aid us when we call them.<br> 2 Now let us pay this homage to the Fathers, to those who passed of old and those who followed,<br> Those who have rested in the earthly region, and those who dwell among the Mighty Races.<br> 3 1 have attained the gracious-minded Fathers, I have gained son and progeny from Viṣṇu.<br> They who enjoy pressed juices with oblation seated on sacred grass, come oftenest hither.<br> 4 Fathers who sit on sacred grass, come, help us: these offerings have we made for you; accept them.<br> So come to us with most auspicious favour, and give us health and strength without a trouble.<br> 5 May they, the Fathers, worthy of the Soma, invited to their favourite oblations.<br> Laid on the sacred grass, come nigh and listen: may they be gracious unto us and bless us.<br> 6 Bowing your bended knees and seated southward, accept this sacrifice of ours with favour.<br> Punish us not for any sin, O Fathers, which we through human frailty have committed.<br> 7 Lapped in the bosom of the purple Mornings, give riches to the man who brings oblations.<br> Grant to your sons a portion of that treasure, and, present, give them energy, ye Fathers.<br> 8 Our ancient Fathers who deserve the Soma, who came, most noble, to our Soma banquet,<br> With these let Yama, yearning with the yearning, rejoicing eat our offerings at his pleasure.<br> 9 Come to us, Agni, with the gracioug Fathers who dwell in glowing light, the very Kavyas,<br> Who thirsted mid the Gods, who hasten hither, oblation winners, theme of singers' praises.<br> 10 Come, Agni, come with countless ancient Fathers, dwellers in light, primeval, God-adorers,<br> Eaters and drinkers of oblations, truthful, who travel with the Deities and Indra.<br> 11 Fathers whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh: ye kindly leaders, take ye each your proper place.<br> Eat sacrificial food presented on the grass: grant riches with a multitude of hero sons.<br> 12 Thou, Agni Jātavedas, when entreated, didst bear the offerings which thou madest fragrant,<br> And give them to the Fathers who did cat them with Svadha. Eat, thou God, the gifts we bring thee.<br> 13 Thou, Jātavedas, knowest well the number of Fathers who are here and who are absent,<br> Of Fathers whom we know and whom we know not: accept the sacrifice wellprepared with portions.<br> 14 They who, consumed by fire or not cremated, joy in their offering in the midst of heaven,<br> Grant them, O Sovran Lord, the world of spirits and their own body, as thy pleasure wills it.</p>
