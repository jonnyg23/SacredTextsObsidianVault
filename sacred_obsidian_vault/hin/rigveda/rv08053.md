 <p>1. MAY our hymns give thee great delight. Display thy bounty, Thunderer.<br> Drive off the enemies of prayer.<br> 2 Crush with thy foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty art thou<br> There is not one to equal thee.<br> 3 Thou art the Lord of Soma pressed, Soma impressed is also thine.<br> Thou art the Sovran of the folk.<br> 4 Come, go thou forth, dwelling in heaven and listening to the prayers of men:<br> Thou fillest both the heavens and earth.<br> 5 Even that hill with rocky heights, with hundreds, thousands, held within.<br> Thou for thy worshippers brakest through.<br> 6 We call on thee both night and day to taste the flowing Soma juice:<br> Do thou fulfil our heart's desire.<br> 7 Where is that ever-youthful Steer, strong. necked and never yet bent down?<br> What Brahman ministers to him?<br> 8 To whose libation doth the Steer, betake him with delight therein?<br> Who takes delight in Indra now?<br> 9 Whom, Vṛtra-slayer, have thy gift and hero powers accompanied?<br> Who is thy dearest in the laud?<br> 10 For thee among mankind, among the Pūrus is this Soma shed.<br> Hasten thou hither: drink thereof.<br> 11 This, growing by Soma and by Śaryaṇāvān, dear to thee,<br> In Ārjīkīya, cheers thee best.<br> 12 Hasten thou hitherward, and drink this for munificence to-day,<br> Delightful for thine eager draught.</p>
