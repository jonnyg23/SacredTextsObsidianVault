 <p>"Dhritarashtra said,--'Tell me, O Sanjaya, of the period of life, the strength, the good and bad things, the future, past and present, of the residents, O <i>Suta</i>, of this <i>Varsha</i> of Bharata, and of the Himavat-varsha, as also of Hari-varsha, in detail."</p>  
 <p>"Sanjaya said,--'O bull of Bharata's race, four <i>Yugas</i> set in Bharata's <i>Varsha</i>, <i>viz.</i>, <i>Krita</i>, <i>Treta</i>, <i>Dwapara</i>, and <i>Kali</i>. The <i>Yuga</i> that sets in first is <i>Krita</i>. O Lord; after the expiry of <i>Krita</i> comes <i>Treta</i>; after expiry of <i>Treta</i> comes <i>Dwapara</i>; and after that last of all, sets in <i>Kali</i>. Four thousand years, O best of the Kurus, are reckoned as the measure of life, O best of kings, in the <i>Krita</i> epoch. Three thousand years is the period in <i>Treta</i>, O ruler of men. At present in <i>Dwapara</i>, persons live on Earth for two thousand years. In <i>Kali</i>, however, O bull of Bharata's race, there is no fixed limit of life's measure, in so much that men die while in the womb, as also soon after birth. In the <i>Krita</i> age, O king, men are born and beget children, by hundreds and thousands, that are of great strength and great power, endued with the attribute of great wisdom, and possessed of wealth and handsome features. In that age are born and begotten <i>Munis</i> endued with wealth of asceticism, capable of great exertion, possessed of high souls, and virtuous, and truthful in speech. The Kshatriyas also, born in that age are of agreeable features, able-bodied, possessed of great energy, accomplished in the use of the bow, highly skilled in battle and exceedingly brave. In the <i>Treta</i> age, O king, all the Kshatriya kings were emperors ruling from sea to sea. In <i>Treta</i> are</p>

 <p>begotten brave Kshatriyas not subject to any one, endued with long lives, possessed of heroism, and wielding the bow in battle with great skill. When <i>Dwapara</i> sets in, O king, all the (four) orders born become capable of great exertion, endued with great energy, and desirous of conquering one another. The men born in <i>Kali</i>, O king, are endued with little energy, highly wrathful, covetous, and untruthful. Jealousy, pride, anger, deception, malice and covetousness, O Bharata, are the attributes of creatures in the <i>Kali</i> age. The portion that remains, O king, of this the <i>Dwapara</i> age, is small, O ruler of men. The <i>Varsha</i> known as Haimavat is superior to Bharatavarsha, while Harivarsha is superior to Hainavatvarsha, in respect of all qualities.'</p>
