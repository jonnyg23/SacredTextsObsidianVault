 <p>"Arjuna said, 'What is that <i>Brahman</i>, what is <i>Adhyatma</i>, what is action, O best of male beings? What also has been said to be <i>Adhibhuta</i>, and what is called <i>Adhidaiva</i>? Who is here <i>Adhiyajna</i>, and how, in this body, O slayer of Madhu? And how at the time of departure art thou to be known by those that have restrained their self'?--</p>  
 <p>"The Holy One said, <i>'Brahman</i> is the Supreme and indestructible. Adhyatma is said to be its own manifestation. The offering (to any godhead in a sacrifice) which causeth the production and development of all--this is called action. <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">3</font></a> Remembering me alone in (his) last moments, he that, casting off his body, departeth (hence), cometh into my essence. There is no doubt in this. Whichever form (of godhead) one remembereth when one casteth off, at the end, (his) body, unto that one he goeth, O son of Kunti, having habitually meditated on it always. Therefore, think of me at all times, and engage in battle. Fixing thy mind and understanding on me, thou wilt, without doubt, come even to me. Thinking (of the Supreme) with a mind not running to other objects and endued with abstraction in the form of uninterrupted application, one goeth, O son of Pritha, unto the Divine and Supreme male Being. He who at the time of his departure, with a steady mind, endued with reverence, with power of abstraction, and directing the life-breath called <i>Prana</i> between the eye-brows, thinketh of that ancient seer, who is the ruler (of all), who is minuter than the minutest atom, who is the ordainer of all, who is inconceivable in form, and who is beyond all darkness, cometh unto that Divine and Supreme Male Being, I will tell thee in brief about that seat which persons conversant with the Vedas declare to be indestructible, which is entered by ascetics freed from all longings, and in expectation of which (people) practise the vows of <i>Brahmacharins</i>. Casting off (this) body, he who departeth, stopping up all the doors, confining the mind within the heart, placing his own life-breath called <i>Prana</i> between the eye-brows, resting on continued meditation,</p>

 <p>uttering this one syllable <i>Om</i> which is <i>Brahman</i>, and thinking of me, attaineth to the highest goal. <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">1</font></a> He who always thinketh of me with mind ever withdrawn from all other objects, unto that devotee always engaged on meditation, I am, O Partha, easy of access. High-souled persons who have achieved the highest perfection, attaining to me, do not incur re-birth which is the abode of sorrow and which is transient, All the worlds, O Arjuna, from the abode of <i>Brahman</i> downwards have to go through a round of births, on attaining to me, however, O son of Kunti, there is no re-birth. <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">2</font></a> They who know a day of Brahman to end after a thousand <i>Yugas</i>, and a night (of his) to terminate after a thousand <i>Yugas</i> are persons that know day and night. <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">3</font></a> On the advent of (Brahman's) day everything that is manifest springeth from the unmanifest; and when (his) night cometh, into that same which is called unmanifest all things disappear. That same assemblage of creatures, springing forth again and again, dissolveth on the advent of night, and springeth forth (again), O son of Pritha, when day cometh, constrained (by the force of action, etc.) <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">4</font></a>. There is, however, another entity, unmanifest and eternal, which is beyond that unmanifest, and which is not destroyed when all the entities are destroyed. It is said to be unmanifest and indestructible. They call it the highest goal, attaining which no one hath to come back. That is my Supreme seat. That Supreme Being, O son of Pritha, He within whom are all entities, and by whom all this is permeated, is to be attained by reverence undirected to any other object. I will tell thee the times, O bull of Bharata's race, in which devotees departing (from this life) go, never to return, or to return. The fire, the Light, the day, the lighted fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice, departing from here, the persons knowing <i>Brahma</i> go through this path to <i>Brahma</i>. <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">5</font></a> Smoke, night, also the dark-fortnight (and) the six months of the southern solstice, (departing) through this path, devotee, attaining to the lunar light, returneth. The bright and the dark, these two paths, are regarded to be the eternal (two paths) of the universe. By the one, (one) goeth never to return; by the other, one (going) cometh back. Knowing these two paths, O son of Pritha, no devotee is deluded. Therefore, at all times, be endued with devotion, O Arjuna. The meritorious fruit that is prescribed for the (study of the) <i>Vedas</i>, for sacrifices, for ascetic austerities and for gifts, a devotee knowing all this (that hath been said here),</p>

 <p><a name="fn_210"></a><a href="m06031.htm#fr_210">72:1</a> <i>Adhyatman</i> is explained as all that by which <i>Brahman</i> is to be attained. All actions mean the whole course of duties and practices leading to the knowledge of <i>Brahman</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_212"></a><a href="m06032.htm#fr_212">72:3</a> <i>Bhava</i> is production, and <i>Udbhava</i> is growth or development. Thus Sreedhara.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_214"></a><a href="m06032.htm#fr_214">73:2</a> All these regions being destructible and liable to re-birth, those that live there are equally liable to death and re-birth.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_216"></a><a href="m06032.htm#fr_216">73:4</a> In this round of births and deaths, the creatures themselves are not free agents, being all the while subject to the influence of Karma, as explained by the commentators.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_217"></a><a href="m06032.htm#fr_217">73:5</a> The commentators explain the word fire, the light, day, &amp;c., as several godheads presiding over particular times.</p>
