 <p>"Dhritarashtra said.---"Thou art intelligent, O Sanjaya, and acquainted with the truth (about everything). Thou hast duly given a description of the island in brief. Tell us now of the island in detail. Tell us now of the dimension of the expanse of land that lies in the portion looking like a hare. Thou mayst then speak of the portion resembling <i>peepul</i> tree."</p>  
 <p>Vaisampayana said,--"Thus addressed by the king, Sanjaya began to say.</p>  
 <p>"Sanjaya said,--'Stretching from east to west, are these six mountains that are equal <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">2</font></a> and that extend from the eastern to the western ocean. They are Himavat, Hemakuta, that best of mountains called Nishadha, Nila abounding with stones of <i>lapis lazuli</i>, Sweta white as the moon, and the mountains called Sringavat composed of all kinds of metals. <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">3</font></a> These are the six mountains, O king, which are always the resorts of <i>Siddhas</i> and <i>Charanas</i>. The space lying between each of these measures a thousand <i>Yojanas</i>, and thereon are many delightful kingdoms. And these divisions are called <i>Varshas</i>, O Bharata. In all those kingdoms reside creatures of diverse species. This (the land where we are) is in the <i>Varsha</i> that is called after Bharata. Next to it (northwards) is the <i>Varsha</i> called after Himavat. The land that is beyond Hemakuta is called <i>Harivarsha</i>, South of the Nila range and on the north of the Nishadha is a mountain, O king, called Malyavat that stretches from east to west. Beyond Malyavat northwards is the mountain called Gandhamadana. <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">4</font></a> Between these two (<i>viz.</i>, Malyavat and Gandhamadana) is a globular mountain called Meru made of gold. Effulgent as the morning sun, it is like fire without smoke. <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">5</font></a> It is eighty-four thousand Yojanas high, and, O king, its depth also is eighty-four Yojanas. It standeth</p>

 <p>bearing the worlds above, below and transversely. Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands, <i>viz.</i>, Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have achieved the merit of righteousness. The bird Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that all the birds on Meru were of golden plumage, reflected that he should leave that mountain inasmuch as there was no difference between the good, middling, and bad birds. The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru, as also the moon with (his) attendant constellation, and the Wind-god too. The mountain, O king, is endued with celestial fruits and flowers, and it is covered all over with mansions made of furnished gold. There, on that mountain, O king, the celestials, the <i>Gandharvas</i>, the <i>Asuras</i>, and the <i>Rakshasas</i>, accompanied by the tribes of <i>Apsaras</i>, always sport. There Brahman, and Rudra, and also Sakra the chief of the celestials, assembled together, performed diverse kinds of sacrifices with plentiful gifts. Tumvuru, and Narada and Viswavasu, and the Hahas and the Huhus, repairing thither, adored the foremost of the celestials with diverse hymns. The high-souled seven <i>Rishis</i>, and Kasyapa the lord of creatures, repair thither, blessed be thou, on every <i>parva</i> day. <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a> Upon the summit of that mountain, Usanas, otherwise called the Poet, sporteth with the <i>Daityas</i> (his disciples). <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">2</font></a> The jewels and gems (that we see) and all the mountains abounding in precious stones are of Meru. Therefrom a fourth part is enjoyed by the holy Kuvera. Only a sixteenth part of that wealth he giveth unto men. On the northern side of Meru is a delightful and excellent forest of <i>Karnikaras</i>, covered with the flowers of every season, <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">3</font></a> and occupying a range of hills. There the illustrious <i>Pasupati</i> himself, the creator of all things, surrounded by his celestial attendants and accompanied by Uma, sporteth bearing a chain of <i>Karnikara</i> flowers (on his neck) reaching down to his feet, and blazing with radiance with his three eyes resembling three risen suns. Him <i>Siddhas</i> truthful in speech, of excellent vows and austere ascetic penances, can behold. Indeed, Maheswara is incapable of being seen by persons of wicked conduct. From the summit of that mountain, like a stream of milk, O ruler of men, the sacred and auspicious Ganga, otherwise called Bhagirathi, adored by the most righteous, of universal form and immeasurable and issuing out with terrific noise, falleth with impetuous force on the delightful lake of <i>Chandramas</i>. <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">4</font></a> Indeed that sacred lake, like an ocean, hath been formed by <i>Ganga</i> herself. (While leaping from the mountains), Ganga, incapable of being supported by even the mountains, was held for a hundred thousand years by the bearer of <i>Pinaka</i> </p>

 <p>on his head. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a> On the western side of Meru, O king, is <i>Ketumala</i>. <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">2</font></a> And there also is <i>Jamvukhanda</i>. Both are great seats of humanity, O king. <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">3</font></a> There, O Bharata, the measure of human life is ten thousand years. The men are all of a golden complexion, and the women are like <i>Apsaras</i>. And all the residents are without sickness, without sorrow, and always cheerful. The men born there are of the effulgence of melted gold. On the summits of Gandhamadana, Kuvera the lord of the <i>Guhyakas</i>, with many <i>Rakshasas</i> and accompanied by tribes of <i>Apsaras</i>, passeth his time in joy. Besides Gandhamadana there are many smaller mountains and hills. The measure of human life there is eleven thousand years. There, O king, the men are cheerful, and endued with great energy and great strength and the women are all of the complexion of the lotus and highly beautiful. Beyond <i>Nila</i> is (the <i>Varsha</i> called) <i>Sweta</i>, beyond <i>Sweta</i> is (the <i>Varsha</i> called) <i>Hiranyaka</i>. Beyond <i>Hiranyaka</i> is (the <i>Varsha</i> called) <i>Airavata</i> covered with provinces. The last <i>Varsha</i> in the (extreme) north and Bharata's <i>Varsha</i> in the (extreme) south are both, O king, of the form of a bow. These five <i>Varshas</i> (<i>viz.</i>, <i>Sweta</i>, <i>Hiranyaka</i>, <i>Elavrita</i>, <i>Harivarsha</i>, and <i>Haimavat-varsha</i>) are in the middle, of which <i>Elavrita</i> exists in the very middle of all. Amongst these seven <i>Varshas</i> (the five already mentioned and <i>Airavata</i> and <i>Bharata</i>) that which is further north excels the one to its immediate south in respect of these attributes, <i>viz.</i>, the period of life, stature, health, righteousness, pleasure, and profit. In these <i>Varshas</i>, O Bharata, creatures (though of diverse species) yet, live together. Thus, O king, is Earth covered with mountains. The huge mountains of Hemakuta are otherwise called Kailasa. There, O king, Vaisravana passeth his time in joy with his <i>Guhyakas</i>. Immediately to the north of Kailasa and near the mountains of Mainaka there is a huge and beautiful mountain called <i>Manimaya</i> endued with golden summits. Beside this mountain is a large, beautiful, crystal and delightful lake called <i>Vindusaras</i> with golden sands (on its beach). There king Bhagiratha, beholding Ganga (since) called after his own name, resided for many years. There may be seen innumerable sacrificial stakes made of gems, and <i>Chaitya</i> tree made of gold. It was there that he of a thousand eyes and great fame won (ascetic) success by performing sacrifices. There the Lord of all creatures, the eternal Creator of all the worlds, endued with supreme energy surrounded by his ghostly attendants, is adored. There Nara and Narayana, Brahman, and Manu, and Sthanu as the fifth, are (ever present). And there the celestial stream Ganga having three currents, <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">4</font></a> issuing out of the region of Brahman, first showed herself, and then dividing</p>

 <p>herself into seven streams, became Vaswokasara, Nalini, the sin-cleansing Saraswati, Jamvunadi, Sita, Ganga and Sindhu as the seventh. The Supreme Lord hath (himself) made the arrangement with reference to that inconceivable and celestial stream. It is there that <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">1</font></a> sacrifices have been performed (by gods and <i>Rishis</i>) on a thousand occasions after the end of the <i>Yuga</i> (when creation begins). As regards the Saraswati, in some parts (of her course) she becometh visible and in some parts not so. This celestial sevenfold Ganga is widely known over the three worlds. <i>Rakshasas</i> reside on Himavat, <i>Guhyakas</i> on Hemakuta, and serpents and Nagas on Nishadha, and ascetics on Gokarna. The Sweta mountains are said to be the abode of the celestial and the <i>Asuras</i>. The <i>Gandharvas</i> always reside on Nishadhas, and the regenerate <i>Rishis</i> on Nila. The mountains of Sringavat also are regarded as the resort of the celestials.</p>  
 <p>"'These then, O great king, are the seven <i>Varshas</i> of the world as they are divided. Diverse creatures, mobile <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">2</font></a> and immobile, are placed in them all. Diverse kinds of prosperity, both providential and human, are noticeable in them. They are incapable of being counted. Those desirous, however, of their own good believe (all this), I have now told thee of that delightful region (of land) of the form of a hare about which thou hadst asked me. At the extremities of that region are the two <i>Varshas</i>, <i>viz.</i>, one on the north and the other on the south. Those two also have now been told to thee. Then again the two islands <i>Naga-dwipa</i> and <i>Kasyapa-dwipa</i> are the two ears of this region of the form of a hare. The beautiful mountains of Maleya, O king, having rocks like plates of copper, form another (prominent) part of Jamvudwipa that having its shape resembling a hare.'"</p>
