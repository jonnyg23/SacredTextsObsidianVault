He then pours water into it (the hole), for whatever is injured or torn in this earth that is healed by water: by means of the water he thus joins together and heals what is injured and torn in her.</p>

XI, 38] 'Let flow the divine waters, the honey-sweet, for health, for progeny!'--honey means sap (essence): thus, 'the sapful, for health, for progeny;'--'from their seed let plants spring forth, full-berried!' for full-berried plants indeed spring forth from the seat of the waters.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:3">6:4:3:3</a></font></span>3. He then heals her with air <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for whatever is injured and torn in this earth that is healed by the air: by means of air he thus joins together and heals what is injured and torn in her.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:4">6:4:3:4</a></font></span>4. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 39] 'May Vâyu Mâtari<i>s</i>van heal,'--Vâyu Mâtari<i>s</i>van, doubtless, is he (the wind) that blows yonder;--'the broken heart of thee stretched out with upward look!' for this (hole) is the broken heart of this earth stretched out with upward look;--'thou who goest along by the breath of the gods,'--for he (the wind) indeed goes along by means of the breath of all the gods;--'to thee, Ka, be vasha<i>t</i> (success), O god!'--Ka ('Who?') doubtless is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, for him he makes this earth to be the Vasha<i>t</i>, for there is so far no other oblation than that.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:5">6:4:3:5</a></font></span>5. He then heals her by means of the quarters, for whatever is injured and torn in this earth, that is healed by the quarters: by means of the quarters he thus draws and joins together what is injured and torn in her. He joins together this and this quarter <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whence these two quarters are joined</p>

 <p>together; then this one and this one, whence these two also are joined together: first thus, then thus; then thus, then thus. This is moving (from left) to right, for so (it goes) to the gods: with this and this one a means of healing is prepared; with this and this one he heals.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:6">6:4:3:6</a></font></span>6. He then takes up together the black antelope skin and the lotus-leaf; for the lotus-leaf is the womb, and with the womb he takes up that infused seed: whence the infused seed is taken up by the womb. [He does so, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 40] 'Wellborn with splendour, the refuge and shelter, hath he settled down in the light;' for well-born he is, and he settles down in the refuge, and shelter, and light.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:7">6:4:3:7</a></font></span>7. He then ties it (the lump) up: he thereby keeps the seed within the womb; whence the seed kept within the womb does not escape. With a string (he ties it), for with the string they yoke the draught beast;--with a triple one of reed grass: the significance of this has been told <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:8">6:4:3:8</a></font></span>8. He lays it round (the skin), with, 'Invest thyself, O lustrous Agni, in the many-coloured garment!' In the sacrifice the cord is Varu<i>n</i>ic; having thereby made it non-Varu<i>n</i>ic, he makes him put on (the skin) as one would make a garment be put on.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:9">6:4:3:9</a></font></span>9. He then takes it and rises;--that Agni being yonder sun, he thus causes yonder sun to rise;--with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 41) <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">2</font></a>, 'Rise, thou of good rites,'--the sacrifice doubtless is a rite: thus, 'rise thou, well</p>

 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>worthy of sacrifice;'--'Guard us with godly wisdom!'--that is, 'whatever divine wisdom is thine, therewith guard us!'--'Most brilliant to see with great light,'--that is, 'in order to be seen most brilliant with great light;'--'hither, O Agni, come thou with praises!'--the praises <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">1</font></a> are the steeds: thus, 'hither, O Agni, come with the steeds.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:4:3:10">6:4:3:10</a></font></span>10. He then lifts it upwards from there towards the east; for this Agni is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun upwards from here in the east, and hence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the east. [He does so, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 42; <i>Ri</i>k S. I, 36, 13] 'Upright for our protection, stand thou like the god Savit<i>ri</i>!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'upright, as a bestower <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">2</font></a> of strength,'--for standing upright he (the sun) indeed bestows <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">2</font></a> strength, food;--'when we utter our call with the shining offerers'--the shining offerers <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">3</font></a>, doubtless, are his (the sun's) rays: it is these he means. He lifts it up beyond the reach of his arms, for beyond the reach of his arms is that (sun) from here. He then lowers it; and having lowered it, he holds it above the navel: the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

Thus, according to Kâty. XVI, 3, 4, the sunwise movement is <a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a> obtained by the hand moving from east (along the south) to west, and then from south (along the west) to north.</p>
