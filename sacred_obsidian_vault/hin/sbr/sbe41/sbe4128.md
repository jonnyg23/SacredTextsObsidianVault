 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:1">6:1:1:1</a></font></span>1. Verily, in the beginning there was here the non-existent <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">1</font></a>. As to this they say, 'What was that non-existent?' The <i>Ri</i>shis, assuredly,--it is they that were the non-existent <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">2</font></a>. As to this they say, 'Who were those <i>Ri</i>shis?' The <i>Ri</i>shis, doubtless, were the vital airs: inasmuch as before (the existence of) this universe, they, desiring it, wore themselves out (rish) with toil and austerity, therefore (they are called) <i>Ri</i>shis.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:2">6:1:1:2</a></font></span>2. This same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra. He, by his power (indriya), kindled those (other) vital airs from the midst; and inasmuch as he kindled (indh), he is the kindler (indha): the kindler <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">3</font></a> indeed,--him they call 'Indra' mystically</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (esoterically), for the gods love the mystic. They (the vital airs), being kindled, created seven separate persons <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">1</font></a> (purusha).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:3">6:1:1:3</a></font></span>3. They said, 'Surely, being thus, we shall not be able to generate: let us make these seven persons one Person!' They made those seven persons one Person: they compressed two of them <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">2</font></a> (into) what is above the navel, and two of them (into) what is below the navel; (one) person was (one) wing (or side), (one) person was (the other) wing, and one person was the base (i.e. the feet).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:4">6:1:1:4</a></font></span>4. And what excellence, what life-sap (rasa) there was in those seven persons, that they concentrated above, that became his head. And because (in it) they concentrated the excellence (<i>s</i>rî), therefore it is (called) the head (<i>s</i>iras). It was thereto that the breaths resorted (<i>s</i>ri): therefore also it is the head (<i>s</i>iras). And because the breaths did so resort (<i>s</i>ri) thereto, therefore also the breaths (vital airs, and their organs) are elements of excellence (<i>s</i>rî). And because they resorted to the whole (system) therefore (this is called) body (<i>s</i>arîra).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:5">6:1:1:5</a></font></span>5. That same Person became Pra<i>g</i>âpati (lord of generation). And that Person which became Pra<i>g</i>âpati is this very Agni (fire-altar), who is now (to be) built.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:6">6:1:1:6</a></font></span>6. He verily is composed of seven persons, for this Person (Agni) is composed of seven persons <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>

 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a></p>  
 <p>to wit, the body (trunk) of four, and the wings and tail of three; for the body of that (first) Person (was composed of) four, and the wings and tail of three. And inasmuch as he makes the body larger by one person, by that force the body raises the wings and tail.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:7">6:1:1:7</a></font></span>7. And as to the fire which is deposited on the built (altar),--whatever excellence, whatever life-sap there was in those seven persons, that they now concentrate above, that is his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) head. On that same (head) all the gods are dependent (<i>s</i>rita), for it is there that offering is made to all the gods: therefore also it is the head (<i>s</i>iras).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:8">6:1:1:8</a></font></span>8. Now this Person Pra<i>g</i>âpati desired, 'May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced!' He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, 'the Brahman (Veda) is the foundation of everything here.' Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:9">6:1:1:9</a></font></span>9. He created the waters out of Vâ<i>k</i> (speech, that is) the world; for speech belonged to it <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">1</font></a>: that was</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a></p>  
 <p>created (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded (âp) whatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (âpa<i>h</i>); and because it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (vâr).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:10">6:1:1:10</a></font></span>10. He desired, 'May I be reproduced from these waters!' He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. 'Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, 'The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.' For even before that Person the Brahman was created <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">1</font></a>: it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda, that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni's mouth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:11">6:1:1:11</a></font></span>11. Now the embryo which was inside was created as the foremost (agri): inasmuch as it was created foremost (agram) of this All, therefore (it is called) Agri: Agri, indeed, is he whom they mystically call <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">2</font></a> Agni; for the gods love the mystic. And the tear (a<i>s</i>ru, n.) which had formed itself <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">3</font></a> <a href="errata.htm#12">became</a> the 'a<i>s</i>ru' (m.): 'a<i>s</i>ru' indeed is what they mystically call 'a<i>s</i>va' (horse), for the gods love the</p>

 <p>mystic. And that which, as it were, cried <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">1</font></a> (ras), became the ass (râsabha). And the juice which was adhering to the shell (of the egg) became the he-goat (a<i>g</i>a <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">2</font></a>). And that which was the shell became the earth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:12">6:1:1:12</a></font></span>12. He desired, 'May I generate, this (earth) from these waters!' He compressed it <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">3</font></a> and threw it into the water. The juice which flowed from it became a tortoise; and that which was spirted upwards (became) what is produced above here over the wafers. This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the water: all this (universe) appeared as one form only, namely, water.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:13">6:1:1:13</a></font></span>13. He desired, 'May it become more than one, may it reproduce itself!' He toiled and practised austerity; and worn out with toil and austerity, he created foam. He was aware that 'this indeed looks different, it is becoming more (than one): I must toil, indeed!' Worn out with toil and austerity, he created clay, mud, saline soil and sand, gravel (pebble), rock, ore, gold, plants and trees: therewith he clothed this earth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:14">6:1:1:14</a></font></span>14. This (earth), then, was created as (consisting of) these same nine creations. Hence they say, 'Threefold (three times three) is Agni;' for Agni is this (earth), since thereof the whole Agni (fire-altar) is constructed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:1:1:15">6:1:1:15</a></font></span>15. 'This (earth) has indeed become (bhû) a foundation!' (he thought): hence it became the earth (bhûmi). He spread it out (prath), and it</p>

 <p>became the broad one (or earth, p<i>ri</i>thivî). And she (the earth), thinking herself quite perfect <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">1</font></a>, sang; and inasmuch as she sang (gâ), therefore she is Gâyatrî. But they also say, 'It was Agni, indeed, on her (the earth's) back, who thinking himself quite perfect, sang; and inasmuch as he sang (gâ), therefore Agni is Gâyatra.' And hence whosoever thinks himself quite perfect, either sings or delights in song <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="sbe4128.htm#fr_283">143:2</a> In the original, 'the non-existent' is the subject of the clause, not the predicate as would appear from the translation. A similar transposition seems often advisable in English, for the sake of emphasis, and on other grounds.
