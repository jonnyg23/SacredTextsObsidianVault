He draws the A<i>m</i><i>s</i>u <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a> (graha), just for completeness’ sake, for it is <a href="errata.htm#2">therefor</a> that he draws</p>

 <p>the A<i>m</i><i>s</i>u. After that he draws those recognised Agnish<i>t</i>oma cups <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a> up to the Âgraya<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:2">5:1:2:2</a></font></span>2, He then draws the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>yas <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">2</font></a>: and whatever the gods (Agni, Indra, and Sûrya) won by them, even that he wins by them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:3">5:1:2:3</a></font></span>3. He then draws the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in: and whatever Indra won thereby, even that he (the sacrificer) wins thereby.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:4">5:1:2:4</a></font></span>4. He then draws those five Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups (for Indra; the first) with the text (V. S. IX, 2), 'Thee, the firm-seated, the man-seated, the mind-seated! Thou art taken with a support <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">3</font></a>: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb' (i.e. thy home): thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for of these</p>

 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>worlds this one, to wit the earth, is the firm one: this same world he thereby wins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:5">5:1:2:5</a></font></span>5. [The second with,] 'Thee, the water-seated, the ghee-seated, the ether-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for among these worlds that ether (mentioned in the formula) is this air: he thereby wins this air-world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:6">5:1:2:6</a></font></span>6. [The third with,] 'Thee, the earth-seated, the air-seated, the sky-seated, the god-seated, the heaven-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for god-seated, heaven-seated indeed is yonder world of the gods: the world of the gods he thereby wins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:7">5:1:2:7</a></font></span>7. [The fourth with V. S. IX, 3,] 'The waters’ invigorating essence, being contained in the sun,--that which is the essence of the waters’ essence, that, the most excellent, I take for you! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for the waters’ essence is he that blows (or purifies) yonder (the wind), and he is contained in the sun, he blows from the sun: that same essence he thereby wins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:8">5:1:2:8</a></font></span>8. [The fifth with IX, 4,] 'Ye cups, of strengthening libations, inspiring the sage with thought,--I have gathered together the pith and sap of you, the handleless! Thou art taken with a support: thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Indra!' therewith he deposits it;--pith means essence: it is the essence he thereby wins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:9">5:1:2:9</a></font></span>9. These, then, are five Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups he draws; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, and there are five seasons in the year,--he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati: therefore he draws five Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:10">5:1:2:10</a></font></span>10. He (the Adhvaryu) then draws seventeen (other) cups of Soma, and (the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>) seventeen cups of Surâ (spirituous liquor), for to Pra<i>g</i>âpati belong these two (saps of) plants, to wit the Soma and the Surâ;--and of these two the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Surâ untruth, misery, darkness: both these (saps of) plants he thereby wins; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins everything here, since he wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed is everything here.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:11">5:1:2:11</a></font></span>11. Now as to why he draws seventeen cups of Soma;--Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a>: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>its measure, with that much he thus wins its truth, its prosperity, its light.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:12">5:1:2:12</a></font></span>12. And why he draws seventeen cups of Surâ;--Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, with that much he thus wins its untruth, its misery, its darkness.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:13">5:1:2:13</a></font></span>13. These two amount to thirty-four cups; for there are thirty-three gods, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the thirty-fourth: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:14">5:1:2:14</a></font></span>14. Now when he buys the king (Soma), he at the same time buys for a piece of lead the Parisrut (immature spirituous liquor) from a long-haired man near by towards the south. For a long-haired man is neither man nor woman; for, being a male, he is not a woman; and being long-haired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And that lead is neither iron nor gold; and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Surâ <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a>: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long-haired man.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:15">5:1:2:15</a></font></span>15. And on the preceding day they prepare two</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>earth-mounds <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the one in front of the axle, and the other behind the axle: 'Lest we should deposit together the cups of Soma, and the cups of Surâ,'--this is why, on the preceding day, they prepare two mounds, one in front, and the other behind the axle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:16">5:1:2:16</a></font></span>16. Now, when they take the Vasatîvarî water <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">2</font></a> (into the havirdhâna shed) by the front door, the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> takes in the Parisrut-liquor by the back door. From the south they bring in the drinking vessels. The Adhvaryu, seated in front of the axle, with his face towards the west, draws the cups of Soma; and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, seated behind the axle, with his face towards the east, draws the cups of Surâ. The Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> a cup of Surâ; the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> a cup of Surâ: in this way they draw them alternately.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:17">5:1:2:17</a></font></span>17. Neither does the Adhvaryu hold the Soma-cup beyond the axle towards the back, nor the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> the Surâ-cup beyond the axle towards the front, thinking, 'Lest we should confound light and darkness!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:18">5:1:2:18</a></font></span>18. The Adhvaryu holds the Soma-cup just over the axle, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> the Surâ-cup just below</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>the axle, with (V. S. IX, 4), 'United ye are: unite me with happiness!' Thinking, 'Lest we should say "evil",' they withdraw them again, with, 'Disunited ye are: disunite me from evil!' Even as one might tear a single reed from a clump of reed-grass, so do they thereby tear him from out of all evil: there is not in him so much sin as the point of a grass-blade. They deposit the two (cups each time on the mounds).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:2:19">5:1:2:19</a></font></span>19. Thereupon the Adhvaryu draws the Madhu-graha (honey-cup) in a golden vessel, and deposits it in the middle of the Soma-grahas. He then draws the Ukthya, then the Dhruva. And when, at the last chant (of the evening press feast <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a>), he has poured those Soma-grahas one by one into the cups of the officiating priests, they make offering and drink them. At the midday-pressing it is told regarding the honey-cup, and the cups of Surâ: thereof then <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_35"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_35">5:1</a> Regarding this cup, or libation (consisting, it would seem, of imperfectly pressed Soma-plants in water), see part ii, p. 424, note 1. Here, and in the sequel, the author only refers to those points of ceremonial in which the performance differs from that of the ordinary Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice, as described in part ii.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_37"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_37">6:2</a> That is, the three Atigrâhyas (part ii, p. 402, note 2), required for the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotras at the midday feast, when performed in their proper 'p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a' form, as they are at the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya sha<i>d</i>aha, and at a Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it-ekâha with all the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as. See IV, 5, 4, 24. The authorities of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us adopt a somewhat different arrangement. The Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups are likewise called by them Atigrâhyas (Taitt. S. I, 7, 22; T. B. I, 3, 9), and these are apparently drawn by them immediately after the second of the ordinary three Atigrâhyas, the one belonging to Indra (T. S. vol. i, p. 996,--but see ib. p. 1955, where it is stated that they are drawn immediately after the Âgraya<i>n</i>a,--that is, probably, if the ordinary Atigrâhyas are not required). Then follows (the third ordinary Atigrâhya?), then the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in, and thereupon the seventeen cups for Pra<i>g</i>âpati.--Sâya<i>n</i>a remarks on our passage,--teshâm (atigrâhyâ<i>n</i>âm) prak<i>ri</i>tigatâ tritvasa<i>m</i>khyaiva <i>s</i>âkhântaravat sa<i>m</i>khyântarânupade<i>s</i>ât.

 <p><a name="fn_38"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_38">6:3</a> For an explanation of these notions, see part ii, p. 260, notes 1 and 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_39"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_39">8:1</a> See I, 5, 2, 17, where the principal formulas used in making oblations are computed as consisting together of seventeen syllables. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br. 18, 6 insists especially on the symbolic identity of Pra<i>g</i>âpati and the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya on the double ground that the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya consists of seventeen stotras, and has for its characteristic mode of chanting the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma, or seventeen-versed hymn. That this is indeed so will appear from a glance at the chief chants. The Bahishpavamâna-stotra, which in the ordinary Agnish<i>t</i>oma is chanted in the triv<i>ri</i>t-stoma, consisting of three triplets, or nine verses (see part ii, p. 310), is at the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya made to consist of seventeen verses, by the insertion of eight verses (S.V. II, 180-82; 186-90) between the second and third triplets. Again, the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna, ordinarily chanted in fifteen verses (part ii, p. 333), here consists of seventeen, viz. II, 105-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 663 (one verse); II, 663-4 (sung as triplet, in two tunes = six verses); <a href="errata.htm#3">II, 663, in a different tune again</a> (one verse); II, 821-23 <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a> (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. Similarly, the Ârbhava-pavamâna (chanted at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma also in the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma, cf. part ii, p. 315; but here with modifications) consists of II, 165-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 42, 44 (two verses); II, 47-9 (in two tunes = six verses); <a href="errata.htm#4">II, 720-22</a> (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. For the similarly constructed Vâ<i>g</i>apeya hymn see page 11, note 1. See also Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. VIII, 11, 15 seq., where the number of officiating priests, as well as that of the various sacrificial fees, is fixed at seventeen. Similarly, Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. IX, 9, 2-3 says that there are either to be seventeen dikshâs, or the whole ceremony is to be performed in seventeen days.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_40"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_40">9:1</a> According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, the difference between surâ and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &amp;c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_41"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_41">10:1</a> The mounds (khara) thrown up in the havirdhâna cart-shed, are used for placing the cups of Soma (and Surâ) after they are drawn, until they are used for the libations. See the plan of the sacrificial ground at the end of part ii; only that on the present occasion there is to be a second mound, for the placing of the Surâ-cups, under or just behind the axle of the southern Soma-cart (in the place where the Nârâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa cups to the Fathers were temporarily deposited at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma; see III, 6, 2, 25 with note). On this occasion a small door is also made in the southern wall of the cart-shed, by breaking through the hurdle.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_42">10:2</a> Part ii, p. 222 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_43">11:1</a> The last chant (at the evening feast) of the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya sacrifice is the so-called Vâ<i>g</i>apeya-sâman, or B<i>ri</i>hat-stotra (Sâmav. II, 975-7), chanted, to the B<i>ri</i>hat tune, in the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma; the three verses being, by repetitions, raised to the number of seventeen.--'When he has poured . . . they offer it:' this is apparently a case of the absolute construction of the gerund in '-ya,' cf. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 108.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_44"></a><a href="sbe4104.htm#fr_44">11:2</a> On these cups, or libations, see <a href="sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:28">V, I, 5, 28</a>.</p>
