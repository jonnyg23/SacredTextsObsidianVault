 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:1">6:3:1:1</a></font></span>1. The gods then said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst they were meditating, Savit<i>ri</i> saw those Sâvitra (formulas); and inasmuch as Savit<i>ri</i> saw them, they are called Sâvitra. He offered that eightfold-taken libation; and when he had offered it, he saw this eightfold-appointed Ashâ<i>dh</i>â <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which had been created aforetime.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:2">6:3:1:2</a></font></span>2. Now when they said, 'Meditate ye!' they doubtless meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' and inasmuch as they saw it whilst meditating (<i>k</i>etay), therefore it is a layer (<i>k</i>iti). And the libation is a sacrifice; and inasmuch as he saw it after sacrificing (ish<i>t</i>vâ), it is a brick (ish<i>t</i>akâ).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:3">6:3:1:3</a></font></span>3. Now that same (libation of ghee), while being a single one, he offers as an eightfold one <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">1</font></a> with eight formulas: whence this ('invincible' brick), while being a single one, is eightfold appointed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:4">6:3:1:4</a></font></span>4. He offers while raising upwards (the spoon);--he thereby raises this earth upwards by means of its forms <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">2</font></a>: whence this earth is raised (above the water) by its forms.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:5">6:3:1:5</a></font></span>5. He offers it continuously;--for at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should come thither after them! They saw that continuous libation for preventing the Rakshas, the fiends, from coming after them: hence he offers it continuously.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:6">6:3:1:6</a></font></span>6. And, again, why he offers that libation;--this Agni is Savit<i>ri</i>, and him he gratifies at the outset by this libation; and having sacrificed to, and gratified, him (Agni), he then puts him together. And inasmuch as by this (libation) he gratifies Savit<i>ri</i>, they (the formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:7">6:3:1:7</a></font></span>7. And, again, why he offers this libation;--this Agni is Savit<i>ri</i>, and him he pours out as seed at the outset by this libation; and whatlike seed is poured into the womb suchlike (offspring) is born. And inasmuch as by this (libation) he pours out Savit<i>ri</i> as seed, they (the offering-formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:8">6:3:1:8</a></font></span>8. Both an offering-spoon (sru<i>k</i>) and a dipping-spoon (sruva) are used thereat; for the offering-spoon is speech, and the dipping-spoon is breath; and with speech and breath the gods sought this sacred rite at the beginning: hence there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:9">6:3:1:9</a></font></span>9. And, again, why there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon,--what Pra<i>g</i>âpati was, that indeed is this dipping-spoon, for the dipping-spoon is the breath, and the breath is Pra<i>g</i>âpati. And what Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) was, that is this offering-spoon; for Vâ<i>k</i> is a female, and the offering-spoon (sru<i>k</i>, f.) is a female; and those waters which went forth from the world of Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">1</font></a>, they are this (ghee) which he offers (in) this libation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:10">6:3:1:10</a></font></span>10. He offers it continuously, for those waters flowed continuously. And inasmuch as that Pra<i>g</i>âpati entered the waters with the threefold science <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that is these prayers (ya<i>g</i>us) with which this (priest) now offers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:11">6:3:1:11</a></font></span>11. The first three which there are, are these (three) worlds; and what fourth prayer there is that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p>is the threefold science, that is the <i>G</i>agatî,--the <i>G</i>agatî being all the metres, and all the metres (making up) the threefold science; and what last four (prayers) there are, they are the quarters: now Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed is those worlds and the quarters; and that (<i>g</i>agatî verse in the middle) is the threefold science.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:12">6:3:1:12</a></font></span>12. He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 1), 'Harnessing first the mind,'--Pra<i>g</i>âpati, assuredly, is he that harnesses, he harnessed the mind for that holy work; and because he harnessed the mind for that holy work, therefore he is the harnessing one.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:13">6:3:1:13</a></font></span>13. 'Savit<i>ri</i>, stretching out the thoughts,'--for Savit<i>ri</i> is the mind, and the thoughts are the vital airs;--'gazing reverently at Agni's light,'--that is, having seen Agni's light;--'bore up from the earth;' for upwards from the earth he indeed bears this (offering).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:14">6:3:1:14</a></font></span>14. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 2] 'With harnessed mind we,'--he thereby harnesses the mind for this work, for with unharnessed mind one cannot now do anything;--'at the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>,'--that is impelled (sped) by the god Savit<i>ri</i>,--'with power (we strive) for the heavenly;'--'that by this holy work he may go to the heavenly world,' he thereby means to say; 'with power,' he says, for by power (energy) one goes to the heavenly world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:15">6:3:1:15</a></font></span>15. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 3] 'Savit<i>ri</i>, having harnessed the gods,'--Savit<i>ri</i> is the mind, and the gods are the vital airs;--'going by thought to the light, to heaven,'--for as such as are going to the heavenly world by thought (devotion) he has harnessed them for this holy work;--'going to produce a mighty light,'--the mighty light assuredly is yonder sun, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>he is this Agni, and him they are indeed going to fit together (or, restore);--'may Savit<i>ri</i> speed them!'--that is, 'may they perform this holy work, sped by Savit<i>ri</i>.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:16">6:3:1:16</a></font></span>16. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 4] 'They harness the mind, and they harness the thoughts,'--for both the mind and the vital airs he harnesses for this holy work;--'the priests of the priest,'--the priest is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the priests are the gods;--'of the great inspirer of devotion,'--the great inspirer of devotion <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">1</font></a> is Pra<i>g</i>âpati;--'he hath assigned the priestly offices,'--now when he (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) is built up, then he assigns the priestly offices, for the priestly offices are assigned over the built-up (fire-altar);--'the finder of rites,'--for he indeed found this rite;--'he alone,' for he alone found this whole holy rite;--'mighty is the praise of the god Savit<i>ri</i>,'--that is, 'great is the praise of the god Savit<i>ri</i>.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:17">6:3:1:17</a></font></span>17. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 5 <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 13, 1] 'By devotions I harness your old inspiration,'--the old inspiration (brahman) doubtless is the vital air, and devotion is food, and that food is this oblation: by means of this oblation, by means of this food, he harnesses the vital airs for this holy work,--'May the praise spread abroad on the lord's path,'--this he says in order that there may be for the Sacrificer the praise of fame among both gods and men;--'may all sons of the immortal hear!'--the immortal one doubtless is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and his sons are all the gods;--'who have resorted</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>to the heavenly abodes;'--the heavenly abodes are these worlds: the gods that are in these worlds, with regard to them he says this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:18">6:3:1:18</a></font></span>18. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 6; <i>Ri</i>k S. V, 81, 3] 'Whose course the others have followed,'--for Pra<i>g</i>âpati first performed this rite, whereupon the gods performed it;--'the gods with vigour, the god's greatness,'--the greatness is the sacrifice, thus: 'the gods with vigour (followed) the god's sacrifice, his energy;'--'that dappled steed who hath measured the terrestrial (regions),'--whatsoever is on this earth that is terrestrial, all that he measures out; for with his rays he reaches down to it;--'the regions, he the god Savit<i>ri</i> by his greatness,'--the regions are these worlds, and the god Savit<i>ri</i> is yonder sun: he measures them by his greatness.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:19">6:3:1:19</a></font></span>19. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 7] 'God Savit<i>ri</i>, speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his share!'--the god Savit<i>ri</i> is yonder sun, and his share is the sacrifice, that he means to say when he says 'speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice!'--'May the heavenly, thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought!'--the heavenly Gandharva is yonder sun, and thought is (sacrificial) food; thus, 'May the food-cleanser cleanse our food!'--'May the lord of speech render agreeable our speech!'--this sacred rite is speech, and the lord of speech is the breath: thus, 'May the breath render agreeable this rite of ours!!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:20">6:3:1:20</a></font></span>20. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 8] 'Further, O god Savit<i>ri</i>, this our sacrifice!'--the god Savit<i>ri</i> is yonder sun, and whatever sacrificial rite he furthers, that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p>reaches its end safely and auspiciously;--'as one pleasant to the gods,'--that is, as one which shall please the gods;--'friend-gaining, ever-winning, wealth-winning, heaven-winning,'--that is, one that may gain all this;--'Make the hymn-tune successful with the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> (verse), the Rathantara with the Gâyatra (metre), and the B<i>ri</i>hat, moving in Gâyatra measures!'--thus the sâmans (hymns);--'Hail!' thus the sacrificial formulas: this threefold science is first produced, even as it was there and then produced. And the Agni who was produced, he is this Agni (fire-altar) who is built up from hence upwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:21">6:3:1:21</a></font></span>21. These then are the eight Sâvitra (formulas <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">1</font></a>);--the Gâyatrî has eight syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by just so much he pours him out as seed. There are nine of them, the call of 'Hail' (being) the ninth,--there are nine regions, and Agni is the regions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is. his measure, by so much he pours him out as seed. There are ten of them, the libation (being) the tenth,--the Virâ<i>g</i> has ten syllables, and Agni is Virâ<i>g</i> (the widely shining <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">2</font></a>); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:22">6:3:1:22</a></font></span>22. This libation having been offered, Agni went away from the gods. The gods said, 'Agni is the</p>

 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>cattle (or, an animal), let us search for him by means of the (different kinds of) cattle: he will become manifest unto his own form.' They searched for him by means of the cattle, and he became manifest to his own form: and hence even to this day the animal becomes manifest to its own form (kind) <a name="fr_402"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">1</font></a>, cow to cow, horse to horse, and man to man.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:23">6:3:1:23</a></font></span>23. They said, 'Surely, if we search with all of them, they will become used up and affording no livelihood; and if not with all, we shall get him (Agni) incomplete.' They saw one animal (as a substitute) for two animals <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">2</font></a>, namely, the ass (as a substitute) for the cow and the sheep; and because they saw that one beast (would do) for two beasts, therefore that one (the he-ass), whilst being one, doubly impregnates <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:24">6:3:1:24</a></font></span>24. The sham-man <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">4</font></a> (they saw to be a substitute) for man,--a sham-man doubtless is he who pleases neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor men. Thus they searched by means of all the beasts, and yet they (the beasts) did not come to be used up and affording no livelihood.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:25">6:3:1:25</a></font></span>25. With three he searches,--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him. They are five</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p>by way of (mystic) correspondence <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--Agni (the fire-altar) has five layers; five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:26">6:3:1:26</a></font></span>26. They are fastened with halters of reed-grass to guard (Agni) against injury <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--Agni went away from the gods; he entered into a reed, whence it is hollow, and whence inside it is, as it were, smoke-tinged: (thus) that, the reed, is Agni's womb, and Agni is these cattle; and the womb does not injure the child. For <a name="fr_408"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">3</font></a> it is from a womb that he who is born is born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' thus he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:27">6:3:1:27</a></font></span>27. They (the halters) are triple (strings), for Agni is threefold. They are made like a horse's halter, for the horse's halter lies all round the mouth, and the womb lies all round the child: thus it is made like the womb.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:28">6:3:1:28</a></font></span>28. They (the animals) stand facing the east, first the horse, then the ass, then the he-goat; for this</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p>is their proper order. For that horse (a<i>s</i>va) is the tear (a<i>s</i>ru) which there (at the creation) formed itself; and that ass (râsabha) is that which, as it were, cried (ras); and that he-goat (a<i>g</i>a, unborn) is the juice which adhered to the shell; and that clay which they are about to fetch is nothing else than the shell (of the egg): for it was from these forms that he was created at first <a name="fr_409"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and from them he thus produces him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:29">6:3:1:29</a></font></span>29. They stand on the south side;--for the gods at that time were afraid, lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite their sacrifice from the south. They saw that thunderbolt, yonder sun; for this horse is indeed yonder sun; and by means of that thunderbolt they drove off the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now by this thunderbolt drive off the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:30">6:3:1:30</a></font></span>30. On the right (south) side is the Âhavanîya fire, and on the left (north) lies that spade; for the Âhavanîya (m.) is a male, and the spade (abhri, f.) a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">2</font></a>. [It lies] at a cubit's distance, for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:31">6:3:1:31</a></font></span>31. It should be made of bamboo. Agni went away from the gods. He entered into a bamboo-stem; whence that is hollow. On both sides he made himself those fences, the knots, so as not</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p>to be found out; and wherever he burnt through, those spots came to be.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:32">6:3:1:32</a></font></span>32. It (the spade) should be spotted, for such a one is of Agni's nature. If he cannot procure a spotted one, it may be unspotted, but hollow it must be, to guard (Agni) from injury <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">1</font></a>;--(for) such a one alone is of Agni's nature; that, the bamboo, is Agni's womb; and this (lump of) clay is Agni; and the womb does not injure the child. For it is from a womb that he who is born is born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' so he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:33">6:3:1:33</a></font></span>33. It may be a span long, for the voice here speaks but as far as a span's distance <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">2</font></a>. It is, however, a cubit long, for the cubit is the arm, and strength is exerted by the arm: it thus becomes equal to his strength.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:34">6:3:1:34</a></font></span>34. It may be sharp on one side only, for on one of the two sides is there a keen edge to this speech of ours <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">3</font></a>. But indeed it is one that is sharp on both sides, for on both sides is there a keen edge to this speech of curs, inasmuch as it speaks both what is divine and what is human <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and both truth and untruth: therefore it is one that is sharp on both sides.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:35">6:3:1:35</a></font></span>35. And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--the strength of the spade doubtless is on that side on which there is its sharp edge: he thus lays strength into it on both sides.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:36">6:3:1:36</a></font></span>36. And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--when the gods had there discovered him (Agni), they dug him out from these worlds; and in like manner does he now, after discovering him, dig him out from these worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:37">6:3:1:37</a></font></span>37. When it digs thus (downwards), then it digs him out from this world; and when it moves upwards, then from yonder world; and when it moves about between the two, then from the air-world: it thus digs him out from all these worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:38">6:3:1:38</a></font></span>38. He takes it up, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 9), 'At the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>, I take thee by the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, by the hands of Pûshan, by the Gâyatrî metre, Aṅgiras-like!' By means of those deities he thus takes it up, impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>; by the Gâyatrî metre: he thus imparts the Gâyatrî metre to it. 'From the Earth's seat, Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">1</font></a>!'--</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>now soil means cattle: thus, 'from the earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!'--'by the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!' he thereby takes it with the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre and thus lays into it the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre.</p>

XI, 10] 'A spade thou art,'--for a spade it is: he thus takes it by means of the truth;--'A woman thou art!'--the spade is a thunderbolt, and the woman is a female, and a female injures no one: he thus appeases it so as not to do any injury. 'By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in the seat!' the seat no doubt is this (spot): thus, 'By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in this seat (place).'--'By the <i>G</i>agatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!' he thus takes it up by means of the <i>G</i>agatî metre, and lays the <i>G</i>agatî metre into it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:40">6:3:1:40</a></font></span>40. With three (formulas) he takes it up,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus takes it. Having taken it up with three (formulas), he addresses it with a fourth; for the gods having thus taken it with three (formulas), then laid vigour into it by means of a fourth; and in like manner does he now, after taking it up with three (formulas), lay strength into it with the fourth.</p>

 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>it up by means of the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre, and lays the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre into it: for his undertaking that spade of bamboo is thus made to be those metres.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:42">6:3:1:42</a></font></span>42. Some, indeed, make it of gold, saying, 'It is spoken of as golden.' Let him not do so: in that it is the metres, thereby that (spade) is gold, immortal gold, the immortal metres.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:43">6:3:1:43</a></font></span>43. He takes it up with four (formulas), for all speech consists of four syllables: 'vâk' (speech) is one syllable, and 'aksharam' (syllable) consists of three syllables. Now that monosyllable 'vâk' is the same as this last one, the Anush<i>t</i>ubh; and that trisyllable 'aksharam' is the same as those former formulas: he thus digs up Agni by the whole speech, and equips it with the whole speech,--hence with four (formulas).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:3:1:44">6:3:1:44</a></font></span>44. And, again, why with four (formulas);--there are four quarters: he thus lays speech into the four quarters, whence speech speaks in the four quarters. He takes it up both by metres and by formulas, that makes eight--there are four quarters, and four intermediate quarters: he thus lays speech into all the quarters, whence speech speaks in all the quarters.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_415"></a><a href="sbe4134.htm#fr_415">201:1</a> Mahîdhara says, Agni is called 'purîshya,' because loose soil (purîsha) is put in the fire-pan (ukhâ), on which the fire is then placed. It also doubtless refers to the loose soil which is spread over the different layers of the altar, thus serving as mortar to the bricks. In this epithet of Agni, 'purîsha' seems, however, to be taken in yet another, more subtle sense, the author apparently connecting with it its etymological meaning of 'that which fills, fillings, Germ. Füllung, Füllsel;' whilst the reference to cattle might also seem to point to the later ordinary meaning, 'faeces, manure.' Mahîdhara, on the force of the symbolical identification 'pa<i>s</i>avo vai purîsham,' seems straightway to take 'purîsha' as a synonym of 'pa<i>s</i>u,' when he says,--purîshebhya<i>h</i> pa<i>s</i>ubhyo hita<i>h</i> purîshya<i>h</i>. Sâya<i>n</i>a's comment here is corrupt,--pa<i>s</i>avo vai purîsha<i>m</i> pûra<i>n</i>âmûhi(?) kârya<i>m</i> pa<i>s</i>ava<i>h</i> pûrayanti.</p>
