 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:3">5:4:5:3</a></font></span>3. And because he there stole after (anu-sam-s<i>ri</i>p) with those deities, hence the name Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>pa<i>h</i>. And because he becomes consecrated on the tenth day, therefore (this ceremony is called) Da<i>s</i>apeya <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And because each time ten (men) steal along <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">3</font></a> after each cup, therefore also it is called Da<i>s</i>apeya.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:4">5:4:5:4</a></font></span>4. Here now they say,--'Let him steal forth after enumerating ten Soma-drinking grandfathers <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">4</font></a>: it is thus that he obtains for himself the Soma-draught of this (Da<i>s</i>apeya), for it is a "drinking of ten."'

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:5">5:4:5:5</a></font></span>5. For, surely, it was by those same deities that Varu<i>n</i>a obtained the Soma-draught of that (Consecration-ceremony); and in like manner does this one now obtain the Soma-draught of that (ceremony): let him therefore steal forth after enumerating those same deities. Now as soon as the completing oblation <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">2</font></a> of that Consecration-ceremony comes to an end,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:6">5:4:5:6</a></font></span>6. He prepares those (sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p) oblations,--a cake on twelve, or eight, potsherds for Savit<i>ri</i>; for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>, Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:7">5:4:5:7</a></font></span>7. He then prepares a (rice) pap for Sarasvatî,--for Sarasvatî is speech, and it was with speech that Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with speech. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:8">5:4:5:8</a></font></span>8. He then prepares a cake on ten potsherds for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>,--for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> (the fashioner, creator) rules over living forms, and with Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the living forms, Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in</p>

 <p>like manner does this one now steal along with Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the living forms. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:9">5:4:5:9</a></font></span>9. He then prepares a pap for Pûshan;--for Pûshan is cattle, and with cattle Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with cattle. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:10">5:4:5:10</a></font></span>10. He then prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra;--for Indriya means energy, vigour, and with vigour Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with energy, with vigour. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:11">5:4:5:11</a></font></span>11. He then prepares a pap for B<i>ri</i>haspati;--for B<i>ri</i>haspati means holiness, and with holiness Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in likes manner does this one now steal along with holiness. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:12">5:4:5:12</a></font></span>12. He then prepares a barley pap for Varu<i>n</i>a;--with what vehemence Varu<i>n</i>a seized the creatures, with that vehemence Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with vehemence. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:13">5:4:5:13</a></font></span>13. The deities of the Upasad are the (eighth, ninth, and) tenth <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">1</font></a>. At these (oblations) he presents</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p>  
 <p>five lotus-flowers. That wreath of twelve lotus-flowers he puts on himself; that is the initiation: by that initiation he initiates himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:14">5:4:5:14</a></font></span>14. And as to why there are twelve (flowers),--there being twelve months in the year, and the year being All, it is by the All that he thus initiates him: what flowers there are of the lotus, they are a form (an image) of the sky, they are a form of the stars; and what seed-stalks there are, they are a form of the air; and what suckers there are, they are a form of this (earth): thus he initiates him (to rule) over these worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:15">5:4:5:15</a></font></span>15. And having bought the King (Soma) <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and</p>

 <p>tied him up in two parts, they drive him around. Having then placed one-half on the throne-seat, he proceeds therewith. Having then placed on the throne-seat that portion which was deposited in the Brahman's house, he proceeds with the guest-meal. Whilst he is proceeding with the guest-meal, he performs the Upasads. Whilst he is performing the Upasads,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:16">5:4:5:16</a></font></span>16. He prepares those (three) oblations,--a cake on eight potsherds for Agni; a pap for Soma; and a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish<i>n</i>u. Thus he performs the sacrifice in this way, if it pleases him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:17">5:4:5:17</a></font></span>17. But let him not do it in this way; for he who departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who departs from the path of the Upasads certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice: let him therefore not depart from the path of the Upasads.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:18">5:4:5:18</a></font></span>18. Now when he offers to Agni, he steals along with Agni, with fiery spirit; and when he offers to Soma, he steals along with Soma, the King; and when he offers to Vish<i>n</i>u,--Vish<i>n</i>u being the sacrifice,--he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own (or, takes it in).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:19">5:4:5:19</a></font></span>19. This same (Da<i>s</i>apeya) is an Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice (performed) with the seventeenfold (stoma) <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">1</font></a> for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the</p>

 <p>sacrifice <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">1</font></a>: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:20">5:4:5:20</a></font></span>20. Twelve heifers with first calf are the sacrificial fee for this (sacrifice); for twelve months there are in the year, and the year is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:21">5:4:5:21</a></font></span>21. These (heifers) have twelve embryo calves,--that makes twenty-four; for twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the year is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:22">5:4:5:22</a></font></span>22. He gives them to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman. To the Udgât<i>ri</i> (chanter) he gives the gold wreath, to the Hot<i>ri</i> the gold plate, to the two Adhvaryus two golden mirrors, to the Prastot<i>ri</i> (<a href="errata.htm#10">presenter</a>) a horse, to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a a sterile cow, to the Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin a bull, to the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> and Pot<i>ri</i> two garments, to the A<i>kh</i>âvâka (a cart) laden with barley, and yoked (with an ox) on one side, to the Agnîdh an ox <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:4:5:23">5:4:5:23</a></font></span>23. Now there are here either twelve or thirteen <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">3</font></a> presents,--for either twelve or thirteen are there months in the year, and the year is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it he makes it his own.</p>

Cf. Taitt. S. I, 8, 17; Taitt. Br. I, 8, 1.</p>

The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has 'indre<i>n</i>âsmai,' and so Sâya<i>n</i>a (MS. I. O<font size="-1" color="green">.</font> 657): asmai apas<i>ri</i>tâya vîryâya tadadhînakara<i>n</i>ârtham indre<i>n</i>a; yad vâ vibhaktivyatyaya<i>h</i>, anena vîrye<i>n</i>a vîryavatâ indre<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_222"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_222">114:1</a> It seems rather strange that Varu<i>n</i>a and Vish<i>n</i>u should be included amongst the deities, with whose help Varu<i>n</i>a sought to recover his vigour, or Vish<i>n</i>u the sacrifice; but--’Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_223"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_223">114:2</a> That is, da<i>s</i>a (ten) and peya (drink, beverage).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_224">114:3</a> For an explanation of the noiseless mode of moving with bent bodies, called sarpa<i>n</i>am, 'creeping,' see part ii, pp. 299, 450. It is in this way they are to move when they betake themselves to the respective fire-places for performing the sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p oblations; as they also do when betaking themselves to the Sadas to drink the cups of Soma at the Soma-feast on the next day. When libations of Soma-juice are made from the ten cups (<i>k</i>amasa, see part ii, p. 287), each cup is to be followed by ten Brâhmans who then take part in consuming the liquor in the Sadas--there being thus altogether one hundred Brâhmans taking part in these potations. The contents of the Sacrificer's cup, on the other hand, may be drunk by ten Ra<i>g</i>anyas (i.e. himself and nine others). See Kâty. XV, 8, 18-20; Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 179.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_225">114:4</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a takes this literally as meaning that he is to call out the name of the Sacrificer's grandfather, then the grandfather of that one and so on. The commentary on Kâty. XV, 8, 16, on the other hand, apparently takes it to mean ten forefathers of the Sacrificer who have performed Soma-sacrifices, from the grandfather upwards.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_226">114:5</a> That is, an excessive demand, or, a weighing down, or crushing of the Sacrificer, making it impossible for him to perform the ceremony at all.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_227"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_227">115:1</a> That is to say, after pronouncing the mantra, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 30. agreeing partly with <a href="sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:2">paragraph 2</a> above, viz. beginning, 'By Savit<i>ri</i>, the impeller; by Sarasvatî, speech,' . . . and ending, 'by Vish<i>n</i>u, the tenth deity, impelled I steal forth.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_228"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_228">115:2</a> For the Udavasânîyâ ish<i>t</i>i, see part ii, p. 389.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_229"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_229">115:3</a> The lotus-flowers presented on this occasion are gold ones, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, or optionally ordinary white or gold ones, according to Kâty. XV, 8, 5-6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_230"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_230">116:1</a> For the Upasad, or preliminary oblations of ghee to Agni, Soma, and Vish<i>n</i>u, to be performed twice daily for (usually) three days preceding an ordinary Soma-sacrifice, see part ii, p. 104. At the Da<i>s</i>apeya, the ten Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations take as it were the place of the ordinary Upasads, the latter being performed on the last three preliminary days along with, and to the same deities as, the last three Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations; or, according to some authorities, <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a> being substituted for them. There seems also some difference of opinion as to the exact time when the other preliminary ceremonies--the procession and entrance of king Soma, the guest-meal, &amp;c.--are to take place, see <a href="sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:15">paragraph 15</a>.--According to Kâty. XV, 8,14, these ceremonies are to take place on the seventh day (which the commentator, however, takes to mean the seventh day of the light fortnight of <i>K</i>aitra; the first seven Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations being, according to him, performed on the day before). The Kâ<i>n</i>vas, however, perform these offerings on separate days.--The Taittirîya authorities seem also to be at variance with each other as to the exact relation of the Upasads and the last three Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations, the deities of the two being, according to their scheme, only partly identical. According to Âpastamba (and Taitt. Br.) the first seven Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>ps are performed on so many days and, moreover, one Dîkshâ on the seventh day. Then on the last three days the Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>ps and Upasads are combined in this way, that the eighth day's Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p is performed previous to, the ninth between, the tenth after the two daily Upasad-performances.--Each of the ten oblations also requires a special set of fires for its performance, the first being laid down immediately north of the one used for the Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya ceremony, the second immediately north of the first, &amp;c.; the last Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblation being performed in the fire-shed (<i>s</i>âlâ) of the Da<i>s</i>apeya proper. Kâty. XV, 8, 2-3; cf. Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 176.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_231"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_231">117:1</a> Namely, at the beginning of the Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya, or Consecration-ceremony, when Soma-plants are purchased sufficient to last <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> for both that ceremony and the succeeding Da<i>s</i>apeya; the portion destined for the latter ceremony being meanwhile deposited in the Brahman's house.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_232"></a><a href="sbe4122.htm#fr_232">118:1</a> All the chants (stotra) of the Da<i>s</i>apeya are to be executed in the seventeenfold mode of chanting, or Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma; for an example of which see part ii, p. 315, note 1.</p>
