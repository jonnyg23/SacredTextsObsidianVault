 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:1">5:1:1:1</a></font></span>1. Once upon a time the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, strove together. And the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">1</font></a> of ruin.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:2">5:1:1:2</a></font></span>2. But the gods went on making offerings unto one another. Pra<i>g</i>âpati gave himself up to them: thus the sacrifice <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">2</font></a> became theirs; and indeed the sacrifice is the food of the gods <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:3">5:1:1:3</a></font></span>3. They then spake, 'To which of us shall this <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">4</font></a> belong?' They did not agree together, saying,</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 2</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'To me! to me!' Not being agreed, they said, 'Let us run a race for it: whichever of us shall win, to him it shall belong!'--'So be it!' so they ran a race for it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:4">5:1:1:4</a></font></span>4. Then B<i>ri</i>haspati hasted up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me, (so that) impelled by thee, I may win this!' Then Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>, he won: he became everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures and procreation) indeed is everything here. By offering therewith he (B<i>ri</i>haspati) ascended to that upper region. Therefore who so knoweth, and who so knoweth not,--they say, 'That upper region belongeth to B<i>ri</i>haspati.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:5">5:1:1:5</a></font></span>5. Thus they who of old used to offer the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, ascended to that upper region. From there Aupâvi <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruteya descended again: thenceforward (all men) descend again.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:6">5:1:1:6</a></font></span>6. Indra offered that (Vâ<i>g</i>apeya),--he became everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati  is everything here: by offering therewith he ascended to that upper region.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:7">5:1:1:7</a></font></span>7. Thus they who of old used to offer the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, ascended to that upper region. From there Aupâvi <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruteya descended' again: thenceforward (all men) descend again.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:8">5:1:1:8</a></font></span>8. And whosoever offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, he becomes everything here, he wins everything here; for he wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed is everything here.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:9">5:1:1:9</a></font></span>9. Here now they say, 'One must not offer the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins everything here,--for he wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is everything here,--he leaves nothing remaining here: his people (or offspring) is like to become worse (off).'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:10">5:1:1:10</a></font></span>10. Let him none the less sacrifice: whatever (priests) thus know that sacrifice properly, in respect of the Ri<i>k</i>, the Ya<i>g</i>us, and the Sâman, and such as are proficient, let them assist him in offering it; for verily this is the perfection of that sacrifice, when wise (priests) assist him in offering it: let him therefore sacrifice by all means.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:11">5:1:1:11</a></font></span>11. Now truly this (the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya) is the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's own sacrifice, inasmuch as B<i>ri</i>haspati (the lord of prayer and devotion) performed it; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or priestly dignity), and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman. And it is also that of the Râ<i>g</i>anya, inasmuch as Indri performed it; for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or ruling power), and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:12">5:1:1:12</a></font></span>12. To the king (râ<i>g</i>an) doubtless belongs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya; for by offering the Râ<i>g</i>asûya he becomes king; and unsuited for kingship is the Brâhma<i>n</i>a. And, moreover, the Râ<i>g</i>asûya is the lower, and the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya the higher (sacrifice).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:13">5:1:1:13</a></font></span>13. For by offering the Râ<i>g</i>asûya <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">1</font></a> he becomes king, and by the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya (he becomes) emperor (samrâ<i>g</i>); and the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher: a king might indeed wish to become emperor, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher; but the emperor would not wish to become king, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:14">5:1:1:14</a></font></span>14. Thus that (king) who, by performing the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, becomes emperor, possesses himself of everything here. Previously to each performance (of an ish<i>t</i>i <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">2</font></a>) he offers that oblation to Savit<i>ri</i> (the sun), with the text, 'O divine Savit<i>ri</i>, impel (prosper) the sacrifice, impel Pra<i>g</i>âpati for his portion!'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:15">5:1:1:15</a></font></span>15. And even as then B<i>ri</i>haspati hasted up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me, (so that) impelled by thee I may win it!' and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impelled it for him; and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he won it; even so does this (sacrificing king) now haste up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion--Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me: may I win it, impelled by thee!' and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impels it for him, and he wins it impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:1:16">5:1:1:16</a></font></span>16. Wherefore he says (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 1), 'God Savit<i>ri</i>, speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his portion! May the heavenly. thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought! May the Lord of Speech render our meat palatable, hail!' For the Lord of Speech is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and meat means food: 'May Pra<i>g</i>âpati this day make palatable this our food!' thus he thereby says. This same oblation he offers till the day before the Soma-feast, for thus that performance of his has been commenced; and he (Savit<i>ri</i>, the Sun) becomes serene during that sacrifice.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_32"></a><a href="sbe4103.htm#fr_32">2:1</a> For want of a simpler and more homely set of terms for the derivatives of the verb sû 'to animate' here used, those used in the preceding volumes are here generally adhered to, though, as there, somewhat reluctantly. The simple 'to bless, blessing, &amp;c.' might sometimes fit quite well, though no doubt they imply an idea altogether foreign to the etymological meaning of this verb, and could not possibly be used, as is the case here, of the animating influence of the sun. Sometimes 'to speed' has been chosen, where the etymological connection with Savit<i>ri</i> is not insisted upon; while in other passages 'to consecrate, consecration, &amp;c.' might probably come nearer to the meaning of the original.
