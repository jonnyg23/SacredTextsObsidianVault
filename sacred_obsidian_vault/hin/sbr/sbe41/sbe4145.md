 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:1">6:6:1:1</a></font></span>1. Many <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">1</font></a> are the oblations, in the building of the fire-altar, as well as at any other (special ceremony) than the building of the fire-altar. For there are supernumerary rites,--supernumerary are those which are (performed) over and above another rite: of these <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">2</font></a> are the building of the altar (Agni<i>k</i>ityâ), the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha; and because they are over and above the other (normal) rites, therefore they are supernumerary.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:2">6:6:1:2</a></font></span>2. A cake <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">1</font></a> on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u,--that is the initiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice;--one on twelve potsherds to Vai<i>s</i>vânara, and a pap to the Âdityas,--these two belong to Agni.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:3">6:6:1:3</a></font></span>3. Now were he to prepare only the one for Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, and not the other two oblations, then only the initiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice would be performed, and not those of Agni (the fire-altar); and were he to prepare only the other two oblations, and not the one to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, only the initiation (offering) of Agni would be performed, and not that of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:4">6:6:1:4</a></font></span>4. He prepares both that of the sacrifice, and those of Agni, for this rite is both a rite of sacrifice, and a rite of fire: first (comes) that of the sacrifice, and then that of the fire, for the rite of the fire is an accessory rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:5">6:6:1:5</a></font></span>5. Now as regards that (cake) for Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, its mystic import is the same as what is (implied) in a preparatory ceremony. And the (cake) on twelve potsherds for Vai<i>s</i>vânara is for</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>the obtainment of all the fires, Vai<i>s</i>vânara being all the fires;--it is one of twelve potsherds, for twelve months are a year, and Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the year.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:6">6:6:1:6</a></font></span>6. And, again, as to why he prepares one for Vai<i>s</i>vânara,--it is because he is about to produce Agni as Vai<i>s</i>vânara (belonging, or dear to, all men): in the initiation offering he first pours him forth as seed, and whatlike the seed is that is poured into the womb, suchlike is (the child) born therefrom; and inasmuch as he now pours forth that (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara as seed, therefore he is born hereafter as Vai<i>s</i>vânara.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:7">6:6:1:7</a></font></span>7. And why he prepares those two (other) oblations,--Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the ruling power, and that Âditya pap is the people: he thus makes both the ruling power and the people. The Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake) he prepares first, and having thereby made the ruling power, he makes the people.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:8">6:6:1:8</a></font></span>8. That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake) is one single (oblation), having one single deity: he thus makes the ruling power to be concentrated in one (person), and excellence to be concentrated in one. The other, the pap, has many deities, for the pap is a multiplicity of rite-grains, and those Âdityas are a multiplicity of gods: he thus bestows multiplicity on the people. Thus much as to the deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:9">6:6:1:9</a></font></span>9. Now as regards the self (or body of Agni). The Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake) is the head, and that Âditya pap is the body: he thus makes both the head and the body. The Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake) he prepares first; and having thereby made the head, he then makes the body.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:10">6:6:1:10</a></font></span>10. That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake) is one single (oblation), for the head is, as it were, one only; and the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a></p>  
 <p>other, the pap, has many deities, for that pap is a multiplicity of rice-grains, and this body is a multiplicity of limbs: he thus bestows on the body a multiplicity of limbs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:11">6:6:1:11</a></font></span>11. That (pap) is (prepared) on ghee, for the Âdityas are consumers of ghee: he thus gratifies them, each by his own share, by his own liquor. These offerings are (made) silently, for here in the sacrifice there is seed, and silently seed is infused.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:12">6:6:1:12</a></font></span>12. He then offers the Audgrabha<i>n</i>a (libations) <a name="fr_486"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for by the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as (elevatory libations) the gods raised themselves from this world to the heavenly world: and inasmuch as (thereby) they raised themselves (ud-grabh), they are called 'audgrabha<i>n</i>a;'--and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as, now raise himself from this world to the heavenly world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:13">6:6:1:13</a></font></span>13. There are many of these, in the building of the fire-altar as well as at any other (special ceremony): the significance of this has been told. They are of both kinds: (the significance) of this has been told;--first those of the sacrifice, and then those of the fire: (the significance) of this also has been told.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:14">6:6:1:14</a></font></span>14. He offers five of the sacrifice <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--the sacrifice is fivefold: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, by so much he thus pours it forth as seed. Seven (libations) of the fire,--the fire(-altar) consists of seven layers <a name="fr_488"></a><a href="#fn_486"><font size="1">3</font></a>; seven seasons are a year, and</p>

 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Those two kinds (of libations) amount to twelve,--twelve months are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:15">6:6:1:15</a></font></span>15. He offers <a name="fr_489"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 66-67), 'The Purpose, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from purpose, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels (yokes, uses) it for this rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:16">6:6:1:16</a></font></span>16. 'Mind, Wisdom, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from the mind indeed this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:17">6:6:1:17</a></font></span>17. 'Thought, knowledge, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from thought, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:18">6:6:1:18</a></font></span>18. 'The distinction of Speech, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from speech, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:19">6:6:1:19</a></font></span>19. 'To Pra<i>g</i>âpati, to Manu, hail!'--Mann, forsooth, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, for he thought out (man) all this (universe); and Pra<i>g</i>âpati, indeed, of old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:20">6:6:1:20</a></font></span>20. 'To Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, hail!'--Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, doubtless, is the year; and the year, indeed,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>of old performed this rite; and he now makes use thereof for this rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:21">6:6:1:21</a></font></span>21. He then offers the one to Savit<i>ri</i>, for Savit<i>ri</i>, indeed, of old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite,--(Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 67; <i>Ri</i>k S. V, 50, 1), 'Every mortal would choose the friendship of the divine Guide; every one craves riches, and would have glory for him to prosper, hail!' He who chooses the friendship of the god Savit<i>ri</i>, chooses both glory and prosperity; and he who performs this rite, indeed chooses his friendship.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:22">6:6:1:22</a></font></span>22. Now some offer these Audgrabha<i>n</i>a libations into the fire-pan itself, saying, 'These, surely, are offered for (special) objects of desire, and that fire-pan is the Sacrificer's self: we thus secure for the Sacrificer's self all his objects of desire.' Let him not do so; for the fire which is kindled (in the fire-pan) is the essence of the completed sacrifice and of those libations, and when he puts the fire-pan on the fire, after the sacrifice has been completed and the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as offered, then the sacrifice mounts it (the pan), and it bears the sacrifice: let him, therefore, put the fire-pan on the fire only after the sacrifice is complete, and the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as have been offered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:23">6:6:1:23</a></font></span>23. It is covered with a layer of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass, just for the purpose that it may blaze up. And as to why it is with a layer of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass, (it is done) to avoid injury, for that Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass is a womb, and the womb does not injure the child; for he who is born, is born from a womb: 'May he (Agni), when he is born, be born from the womb,' thus he thinks.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6:6:1:24">6:6:1:24</a></font></span>24. Inside <a name="fr_490"></a><a href="#fn_488"><font size="1">1</font></a> there is a layer of hemp, just for the purpose that it may blaze up. And as to its being a layer of hemp,--the inner membrane (amnion) of the womb from which Pra<i>g</i>âpati was born consists of flax, and the outer membrane (chorion) of hemp: hence the latter is foul-smelling, for it is the outer membrane of the embryo. [It is so used] to avoid injury, for the outer membrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the outer membrane of the embryo that he who is born is born: 'May he (Agni), when he is born, be born from the outer membrane of the embryo!' thus he thinks.</p>

This discussion seems to be introduced here on account of the additional oblation (that to Vai<i>s</i>vânara) offered at the initiation ceremony. As an 'additional' or special, oblation at the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, Sâya<i>n</i>a refers to the pap of wild rice (<a href="sbe4106.htm#5:1:4:12">V, 1, 4, 12</a>); whilst at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya the one to Anumati (<a href="sbe4110.htm#5:2:3:4">V, 2, 3, 4</a>) is said to belong to the same category.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_483"></a><a href="sbe4145.htm#fr_485">247:1</a> These and the subsequent offerings form part of the Dîkshâ, or initiation ceremony, for the Soma-sacrifice to be performed after the completion of the fire-altar. This initiation ceremony commences on the day of new moon, a week after the preparation of the ukhâ, or fire-pan. An integral part of (the first day of) this ceremony is the kindling of a fire in the ukhâ--the 'Ukhya Agni'--which ultimately serves to supply the fires for the brick altars built on the completion of the period of initiation. The Dîkshâ is, as a rule, to be performed daily for a year, during which time the fire has to be kept up in the ukhâ, and carried about by the Sacrificer for a time each day. while the cake to Agni-Vish<i>n</i>u here mentioned is the ordinary cake-offering prescribed for the Dîkshâ of the normal Soma-sacrifice (see III, 1, 3, 1), the Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake is peculiar to the Agni<i>k</i>ayana.</p>
