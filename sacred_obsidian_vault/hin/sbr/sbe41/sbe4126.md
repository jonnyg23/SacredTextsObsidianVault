There is a reddish-white (he-goat as the victim) for the A<i>s</i>vins <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the A<i>s</i>vins are reddish-white. There is an ewe with teats in the dewlap <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">2</font></a> for Sarasvatî; and a bull he seizes for Indra Sutrâman (the good protector) <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Difficult to obtain are beasts with such perfections; if he cannot obtain any</p>

 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>  
 <p>with such perfections, they may slaughter only goats, for they are easier to cook. And if they seize only goats, that for the A<i>s</i>vins is a red one. Then as to why he performs this sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:2">5:5:4:2</a></font></span>2. Now Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> had a three-headed, six-eyed son <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He had three mouths; and because he was thus shapen, he was called Vi<i>s</i>varûpa ('All-shape').</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:3">5:5:4:3</a></font></span>3. One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other food. Indra hated him, and cut off those heads of his.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:4">5:5:4:4</a></font></span>4. And from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock sprang forth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for king Soma is brown.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:5">5:5:4:5</a></font></span>5. And from the one which was spirit-drinking, a sparrow sprang; whence the latter talks like one who is joyful, for when one has drunk spirits, one talks as one who enjoys himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:6">5:5:4:6</a></font></span>6. And from the one which was for other (kinds of) food, a partridge sprang; whence the latter is exceedingly variegated: ghee drops indeed have, as it were, dropped on his wings in one place, and honey-drops, as it were, in another; for suchlike was the-food he consumed with that (mouth).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:7">5:5:4:7</a></font></span>7. Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> was furious: 'Has he really slain my son?' He brought Soma juice withheld from Indra <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and as that Soma-juice was, when produced, even so it remained withheld from Indra.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:8">5:5:4:8</a></font></span>8. Indra thought within himself: 'There now, they are excluding me from Soma!' and even uninvited he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, as the stronger (would consume the food) of the weaker. But it hurt him: it flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; only from his mouth it did not flow. Hence there was an atonement; but had it flown also from his mouth, then indeed there would have been no atonement.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:9">5:5:4:9</a></font></span>9. For there are four castes, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the Râ<i>g</i>anya, the Vai<i>s</i>ya, and the <i>S</i>ûdra; but there is not one of them that vomits Soma; but were there any one of them, then indeed there would be atonement.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:10">5:5:4:10</a></font></span>10. From what flowed from the nose a lion sprang; and from what flowed from the ears a wolf sprang; and from what flowed from the lower opening wild beasts sprang, with the tiger as their foremost; and what flowed from the upper opening that was the foaming spirit (parisrut). And thrice he spit out: thence were produced the (fruits called) 'kuvala, karkandhu, or badara <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' He (Indra) became emptied out of everything, for Soma is everything.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:11">5:5:4:11</a></font></span>11. Being thus purged by Soma, he walked about as one tottering. The A<i>s</i>vins cured him by this (offering), and caused him to be supplied with everything, for Soma is everything. By offering he indeed became better.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:12">5:5:4:12</a></font></span>12. The gods spake, 'Aha! these two have saved him <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the well-saved (sutrâta):' hence the name Sautrâma<i>n</i>î.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:13">5:5:4:13</a></font></span>13. Let him also cure by this (ceremony) one purged by Soma;--he whom Soma purges is indeed emptied out of everything, for Soma is everything. He now causes him to be supplied with everything, for Soma is everything; and by offering he indeed becomes better: let him therefore cure thereby also one purged by Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:14">5:5:4:14</a></font></span>14. And as to why the performer of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya performs this offering. He who performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya assuredly gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and instituted by the gods indeed is this offering, the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î: 'May offering be made by me with this one also! may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus (he thinks, and) therefore the performer of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya performs this offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:15">5:5:4:15</a></font></span>15. And as to why there is (a victim) for the A<i>s</i>vins,--it was the A<i>s</i>vins who cured him; and in like manner does he (the priest) now cure him through those same A<i>s</i>vins: that is why there is (a victim) for the A<i>s</i>vins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:16">5:5:4:16</a></font></span>16. And why there is one for Sarasvatî,--Sarasvatî assuredly is speech, and it was by speech that the A<i>s</i>vins cured him; and in like manner does he now cure him by speech: that is why there is one for Sarasvatî.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:17">5:5:4:17</a></font></span>17. And why there is one for Indra,--Indra assuredly is the deity of the sacrifice, and it is by this (offering) that he now heals him: this is why there is one for Indra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:18">5:5:4:18</a></font></span>18. On (the meat-portions of) those victims he throws hairs of a lion, hairs of a wolf, and hairs of a tiger, for that was what sprang therefrom, when Soma flowed right through him. He now supplies</p>  
 <p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a></p>  
 <p>him therewith, and makes him whole: therefore he throws those (hairs) thereon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:19">5:5:4:19</a></font></span>19. But let him not do it so; for he who throws them on the (portions of) the victims, urges the animals on from behind with a clawed (prickly) fire-brand. Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented liquor (parisrut <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">1</font></a>),--thus he does not urge on the animals from behind with a clawed fire-brand; and thus alone he supplies him therewith, and makes him whole: let him therefore throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:20">5:5:4:20</a></font></span>20. Now on the day before, he mixes the spirituous liquor (while muttering, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 30, 'Get done for the A<i>s</i>vins! get done for Sarasvatî! get done for Indra, the good protector!' When that liquor is (done) he proceeds with that (offering).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:21">5:5:4:21</a></font></span>21. They take up two fires; on the northern altar <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">2</font></a> (they lay down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one, thinking, 'Lest we should offer together the Soma-libations, and the Surâ (liquor) -libations:' therefore they take up two fires, and on the northern altar (they lay down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one. And when he proceeds with the omenta, then he proceeds with that spirituous liquor.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:22">5:5:4:22</a></font></span>22. He purifies it with stalks of Darbha-grass, thinking, 'Let it be pure,'--with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 31), 'The inviting <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">3</font></a> Soma, purified by the purifying</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (strainer), has overflown backwards, Indra's mated friend.' He then pours in flour of 'kuvala, karkandhu, and badara' berries, for when he (Indra) spit out thrice, that was what was produced therefrom: therewith he now supplies him and makes him whole,--therefore he pours in that (flour).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:23">5:5:4:23</a></font></span>23. He then draws either one or three cups <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--but only one should be drawn, for there is one puroru<i>k</i>-formula, one invitatory prayer, and one offering prayer; therefore only one (cup) should be drawn.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:24">5:5:4:24</a></font></span>24. He draws it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 32), 'Yea, even as the owners of barley cut their barley, spreading it asunder in due order, so hither, hither, bring thou the nourishments of them that offer up the devotional invocation of the Barhis <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">2</font></a>!--Thou art taken with a support--thee for the A<i>s</i>vins, thee for Sarasvatî, thee for Indra, the good protector!' And if he draw three (cups), let him draw them with that same (verse); but let him in that case draw them with separate 'supports <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' He then says, 'Recite the</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a></p>  
 <p>invitatory prayer to the A<i>s</i>vins, to Sarasvatî, and to Indra Sutrâman!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:25">5:5:4:25</a></font></span>25. He recites (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 33; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 131, 4), 'Ye, O A<i>s</i>vins, lords of splendour, having quaffed the cheering (Soma) together with Namu<i>k</i>i, the Âsura, helped Indra in his deeds!' Having called for the <a href="errata.htm#11"><i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i></a>, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to the A<i>s</i>vins, to Sarasvatî, and to Indra Sutrâman!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:26">5:5:4:26</a></font></span>26. He prays (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 34; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 131, 5), 'As the parents (stand by) their son, so the two A<i>s</i>vins have stood by thee, O Indra, with wise plans and wonderful deeds; when thou quaffedst the cheering (Soma), Sarasvatî cured thee, O Lord, by her services.' Twice the Hot<i>ri</i> utters the Vasha<i>t</i>, twice the Adhvaryu offers and fetches drink. And if he draw three (cups of liquor), then after the offering of that one the other two are offered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:27">5:5:4:27</a></font></span>27. Now there is a pitcher perforated either with a hundred, or with nine, holes. If it is one with a hundred holes,--man lives up to a hundred (years), and has a hundred energies, and a hundred powers: therefore it is perforated with a hundred holes. And if with nine holes,--there are in man those nine vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine holes.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:28">5:5:4:28</a></font></span>28. This (pitcher), hung up by a sling, they hold just over the Âhavanîya <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He pours into it what spirituous liquor has been left over, and whilst it is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>  
 <p>trickling through, he stands by worshipping with the three verses <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the Pitara<i>h</i> Somavanta<i>h</i> (the Fathers accompanied by Soma), with three verses of the Pitaro Barishada<i>h</i> (the Fathers seated on the barhis), and with three verses of the Pitaro Agnishvâttâ<i>h</i> (the Fathers consumed by the fire). And as to why he thus stands by worshipping,--when Soma flowed through Indra, what part of it then went to the Fathers--there being three kinds of Fathers--therewith he now supplies him and makes him whole: therefore he thus stands by worshipping.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:29">5:5:4:29</a></font></span>29. He then prepares those oblations <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--a cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savit<i>ri</i>, a barley pap for Varu<i>n</i>a, and a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:30">5:5:4:30</a></font></span>30. And why there is one for Savit<i>ri</i>,--Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods, and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he now heals <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">3</font></a>: therefore there is one for Savit<i>ri</i>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:31">5:5:4:31</a></font></span>31. And why there is one for Varu<i>n</i>a,--Varu<i>n</i>a is the injurer, and he thus heals him even by him who is the injurer: therefore there is one for Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:32">5:5:4:32</a></font></span>32. And why there is one for Indra,--Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and he thus heals him by him who is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore there is one for Indra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:33">5:5:4:33</a></font></span>33. And if by that (Sautrâma<i>n</i>î-offering) he would heal one purged by Soma <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">1</font></a>, then--(after) the after-offering (of the animal sacrifice) has been performed, and the two spoons separated--he proceeds with those (three) oblations <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">2</font></a>. For it is towards the back part that Soma flows through, and at the back part (of the sacrifice) he thus closes him up by that sacrificial essence. Let him in that case prepare a cake on two potsherds for the A<i>s</i>vins; and when he proceeds with the offering of the omenta, then he also proceeds with that two-kapâla cake for the A<i>s</i>vins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:34">5:5:4:34</a></font></span>34. Let him, however, not do it in this way; for verily whosoever departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who does this indeed departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence at the very time when they proceed with the omenta of those victims, let them then proceed also with those (three) oblations, and let him not then prepare a two-kapâla cake for the A<i>s</i>vins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:4:35">5:5:4:35</a></font></span>35. A castrated bull is the sacrificial fee for this</p>

Or a draught-mare;--the draught-mare is neither male nor female; for in that it pulls the cart it is not a female; and being a female, it is not a male: therefore a draught-mare (may be) the fee.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_254"></a><a href="sbe4126.htm#fr_254">129:1</a> The last three Soma-sacrifices of the Inauguration-ceremony are not even alluded to by the author, their performance involving no features different from those of the normal Soma-sacrifice. The Vyush<i>t</i>i-dvirâtra, or 'two nights’ ceremony of the dawn,' consists of an Agnish<i>t</i>oma and an Atirâtra Soma-sacrifice, to be performed a month after the Ke<i>s</i>avapanîya (or, according to Taitt. Br. I, 8, 10, a fortnight after, viz. on the new-moon, and the first day of the light fortnight respectively). Finally, the Kshatra-dh<i>ri</i>ti, or 'wielding of the ruling-power,' an Agnish<i>t</i>oma, is performed a month later, or on the full-moon of <i>S</i>râva<i>n</i>a (about 1 August). Some authorities, however, allow the Soma-sacrifices of the Inauguration-ceremony to conclude with the Ke<i>s</i>avapanîya Atirâtra (Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XV, 9, 26), perhaps for the very reason that no mention is made in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a of the remaining three Soma-days. The final Soma-sacrifice is followed, in the succeeding fortnight of the waxing moon, by the performance of the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, some peculiar features of which the author now proceeds to consider. This ceremony (one of the objects of which is the expiation of any excess committed in the consumption of Soma-juice) is considered in the sacrificial system as the last of the seven forms of Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a; being a combination of the ish<i>t</i>i with the animal sacrifice. As this ceremony is also performed after the Agni<i>k</i>ayana, or construction of the fire-altar, it is more fully dealt with by the author later on (Kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a XII, 7 seq.).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="sbe4126.htm#fr_267">135:1</a> That is, over the southern one of the two new fires, the one laid down on a raised mound.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_268"></a><a href="sbe4126.htm#fr_268">136:1</a> These triplets to the Fathers are given Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 49-51; 55-57; 58-60.--The Taitt. ritual here has a curious variation. After the remainder of the (pure) liquor has been offered to the Fathers, a Brâhman is to be bought over to drink the dregs; and if such an one cannot be found (willing to do it), they are to be poured away on an ant-hill. This is to be done for the sake of atonement.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_269"></a><a href="sbe4126.htm#fr_269">136:2</a> That is, according to Kâtyâyana (XV, 10, 19) and Sâya<i>n</i>a, the pa<i>s</i>u-puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a, or cakes of the animal offering. The performance of these is irregular, inasmuch as their deities are not the same as those of the animal sacrifice (the A<i>s</i>vins, Sarasvatî, and Indra Sutrâman). Taitt. Br. I, 8, 6, 1, however, explains that in this case the animal sacrifices are without 'animal cakes,' the libations of liquor, which indeed are offered to the same deities, being in lieu of them.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_270"></a><a href="sbe4126.htm#fr_270">136:3</a> The object of the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î offering is to heal or 'make whole' the Sacrificer.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_271"></a><a href="sbe4126.htm#fr_271">137:1</a> That is to say, if it is performed, independently of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, as a special offering with a view to expiating any excess committed at a Soma-sacrifice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_272"></a><a href="sbe4126.htm#fr_272">137:2</a> A glance at the list of contents prefixed to part ii will show how this shifting of the Pa<i>s</i>u-puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a would alter the regular order of procedure.</p>
