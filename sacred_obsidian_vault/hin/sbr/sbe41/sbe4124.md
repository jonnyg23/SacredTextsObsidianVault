 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:1">5:5:2:1</a></font></span>1. He performs the oblations of teams (prayu<i>g</i>â<i>m</i> havî<i>m</i>shi). The reason why he performs the oblations of teams, is that the anointed thereby yokes the seasons, and thus yoked those seasons draw him along, and he follows the seasons thus yoked: therefore he performs the oblations of teams.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:2">5:5:2:2</a></font></span>2. There are twelve of these (oblations), for there are twelve months in the year: that is why there are twelve. 'Let him make offering month by month,' they say. Who knows about (the life of) man <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">2</font></a>? Let him therefore not make offering month by month. Moving eastward he offers six of them each at the distance of the yoke-pin's throw from the other <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and then turning backward he offers six, each at a yoke-pin's throw from the other.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:3">5:5:2:3</a></font></span>3. But let him not do it thus. He prepares those first six so as to have a common barhis <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">1</font></a>, after the manner of those deities (of the first six oblations); even as in early spring they <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">2</font></a> would yoke their team and go onward until the rainy season, so does he now yoke the six seasons, and thus yoked the six seasons draw him forward and he follows the six seasons thus yoked until the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:4">5:5:2:4</a></font></span>4. He prepares the last six oblations so as to have a common barhis, after the manner of those (six) deities. Even as they would return again towards the rainy season, so does he yoke the six seasons, and thus yoked the six seasons draw him towards the rainy season, and he follows the six seasons thus yoked, in the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the original fire are the sacrificial fee. And as to why the (oxen) drawing the original fire are the sacrificial fee,--the consecrated (king) now yokes the seasons, and it being oxen that (actually) draw (and thus represent the seasons), therefore the (oxen) drawing the original fire are the sacrificial fee.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:5">5:5:2:5</a></font></span>5. Now as to this the Kurupa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âlas used formerly to say, 'It is the seasons that, being yoked, draw us, and we follow the seasons thus yoked.' It was because their kings were performers of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya that they spake thus.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:6">5:5:2:6</a></font></span>6. There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, a pap for Soma, a cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savit<i>ri</i>, a pap for B<i>ri</i>haspati, a cake on ten potsherds for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, and one on twelve potsherds for (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara--these are the first six oblations.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:7">5:5:2:7</a></font></span>7. The six last are paps,--a pap for Sarasvatî, a pap for Pûshan, a pap for Mitra, a pap for Kshetrapati (the Landlord or Lord of the manor), a pap for Varu<i>n</i>a, and a pap for Aditi,--these are the last six paps.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:8">5:5:2:8</a></font></span>8. Thereupon they seize <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">1</font></a> a reddish-white (cow) which is clearly with calf, (as a victim) for Aditi. The mode of procedure regarding her is the same as that of the eight-footed barren cow <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Now, Aditi being this earth, it is her embryo (child) he thereby causes him (the king) to be. The sacrificial fee for this (cow-offering) is just such a reddish-white cow that is clearly with calf.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:2:9">5:5:2:9</a></font></span>9. They then seize a dappled one, which is clearly with calf, (as a victim) for the Maruts. The mode of procedure regarding this one is the same. The Maruts being the clans, he thereby makes him the embryo <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the clans. The sacrificial fee for this (cow-offering) is just such a dappled (cow) that is clearly with calf.</p>

The one that is seized for Aditi, (some) seize for the Âdityas,--the Âdityas being the All, he (the priest) thereby makes him the embryo of the All (universe). And the one that is seized for the Maruts, (some) seize for the All-gods,--the All-gods being the All, he thereby makes him the embryo of the All.</p>
