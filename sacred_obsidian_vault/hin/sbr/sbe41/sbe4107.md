 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:1">5:1:5:1</a></font></span>1. Now when they run a race, he thereby wins this same (terrestrial) world. And when the Brahman sings a Sâman on the cart-wheel set up on (a post) reaching to his navel, he thereby wins the air-world. And when he erects the sacrificial post, he thereby wins the world of the gods. Hence that threefold performance.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:2">5:1:5:2</a></font></span>2. The Brahman mounts a cart-wheel, set up on (a post) as high as his navel <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 10),</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'At the impulse (sava) of the god Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of B<i>ri</i>haspati!' thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a sacrifices; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or sanctity), and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:3">5:1:5:3</a></font></span>3. And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of Indra!' for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or power), and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:4">5:1:5:4</a></font></span>4. Thrice he sings the Sâman <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Having thrice sung it, he descends with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of B<i>ri</i>haspati!'--thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a sacrifices, for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:5">5:1:5:5</a></font></span>5. And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices,--with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of Indra!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:6">5:1:5:6</a></font></span>6. They put up seventeen drums along the edge of the altar, from the Âgnîdhra backwards (towards</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>the west); for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati; but Pra<i>g</i>âpati is speech, and that doubtless is the supreme speech which is (the outcome) of seventeen drums: he thus wins the supreme speech, the supreme Pra<i>g</i>âpati. Seventeen there are, because Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:7">5:1:5:7</a></font></span>7. One of these drums he (the Brahman) beats (while praying) with a sacrificial formula: thereby all of them become beaten with a sacrificial formula.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:8">5:1:5:8</a></font></span>8. He beats it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 11), 'O B<i>ri</i>haspati, win the race! lift ye up your voice unto B<i>ri</i>haspati: make ye B<i>ri</i>haspati win the race!' thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a sacrifices; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:9">5:1:5:9</a></font></span>9. And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'O Indra, win the race! lift ye up your voice unto Indra: make ye Indra win the race!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:10">5:1:5:10</a></font></span>10. And when those race-running chariots <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">1</font></a> have come up again, he takes down one of those drums with a sacrificial formula; whereby they all become taken down with a formula.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:11">5:1:5:11</a></font></span>11. He takes it down, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I X, 12), 'This hath been your true concord whereby ye (drums) have caused B<i>ri</i>haspati to win the race;--B<i>ri</i>haspati ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!' thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacrifices; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:12">5:1:5:12</a></font></span>12. And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices, with, 'This hath been your true concord whereby ye have caused Indra to twin the race;--Indra ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:13">5:1:5:13</a></font></span>13. A Râ<i>g</i>anya then <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a> shoots seventeen arrow's ranges northwards from the edge of the altar; for as much as is one arrow's range, so much is Pra<i>g</i>âpati crosswise; and as much as are seventeen arrow's ranges, so much is Pra<i>g</i>âpati lengthwise.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:14">5:1:5:14</a></font></span>14. And as to why a Râ<i>g</i>anya shoots,--he, the Râ<i>g</i>anya is most manifestly of Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures): hence, while being one, he rules over many; and because 'pra<i>g</i>âpati' has four syllables, and 'râ<i>g</i>anya <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">2</font></a>' also has four syllables, therefore a Râ<i>g</i>anya shoots. He shoots seventeen arrow's ranges, because Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thereby wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:15">5:1:5:15</a></font></span>15. And whichever (horse) he yokes with a formula, up to that the Sacrificer now steps <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">3</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 13), 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>,</p>

 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>of true impulsion, may I win the race of the race-winning B<i>ri</i>haspati!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:16">5:1:5:16</a></font></span>16. And even as then B<i>ri</i>haspati hasted up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion,--Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me: impelled by thee, may I win this!' and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>, he won; in like manner does he thereby haste up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion,--Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods,--saying, 'Impel this for me: impelled by thee, may I win!' and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impels it for him, and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he wins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:17">5:1:5:17</a></font></span>17. And if a pupil of the Adhvaryu's or some (other) theological student were to know that prayer, stepping up he makes (the Sacrificer) say, 'O coursers!'--for horses are indeed coursers: therefore he says, 'O coursers'--'wealth-winners!' for wealth is food: 'food-winners' he thereby says;--'keeping the roads,' for they indeed run keeping (within) the roads;--'measuring the stages;' for measuring the stages they run over the course;--'go ye to the winning-post!' In order that the evil-doers, the Rakshas, may not hurt them midways, he thus says this.--They run the race, they beat the drums, and he (the Brahman) sings the Sâman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:18">5:1:5:18</a></font></span>18. He (the Adhvaryu) then <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a> either offers or addresses (the horses) with those two <i>g</i>agatî-verses: whether he offers, or whether he addresses (the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>horses), the significance (of the performance) is the same.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:19">5:1:5:19</a></font></span>19. He offers, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 14; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 40, 4), 'That courser speedeth after the whip, fettered at the neck and shoulder and mouth: may Dadhikrâ win according to his power; may he run along the windings of the roads, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:20">5:1:5:20</a></font></span>20. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 15; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 40, 3], 'And of him, the running, speeding, there fanneth like the wing of the eager bird,--as of the gliding eagle,--about the breast of Dadhikrâvan passing along with might, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:21">5:1:5:21</a></font></span>21. He then either offers or addresses (the horses) with the following tristich: this is twofold, because he either offers or addresses. Whether he offers, or addresses (the horses), the significance is the same: he thereby speeds those running horses, imbues them with energy. There are here three earths, namely this one, and two beyond it: these he thereby wins.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:22">5:1:5:22</a></font></span>22. He addresses (the horses, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 16; <i>Ri</i>k S. VII, 38, 7), 'Auspicious be the coursers unto us at the invocations in the divine service, running their measured course, with beautiful song; swallowing the dragon, the wolf, the evil spirits: may they ever keep away from us affliction!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:23">5:1:5:23</a></font></span>23. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 17; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 64, 6], 'Those racers, wont to hear the calls, may they all hear our call, the coursers running their measured course: they, the winners of thousands, eager to win at the winning of oblations, who have carried off great gain in the contests.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:24">5:1:5:24</a></font></span>24. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 18; <i>Ri</i>k S. VII, 38, 8], 'In</p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>every race, help us, ye racers, at the prizes, ye wise, immortal knowers of the divine law: drink of this mead, be gladdened, and satisfied walk ye on the paths trodden by the gods!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:25">5:1:5:25</a></font></span>25. He then <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">1</font></a> steps over against (the horses) with the Bârhaspatya pap, and touches it; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins food, since 'vâ<i>g</i>a-peya' is the same as 'anna-peya:' whatever food he has thus gained that he now, having reached that goal, brings in contact with himself, puts within himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:26">5:1:5:26</a></font></span>26. He touches it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 19), 'May gain of wealth come to me!' wealth means food: he thus says, 'May gain of food come (accrue) to me;'--'May these two, Heaven and Earth, the all-shaped, come to me!' for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Heaven and Earth;--'May father and mother come to me!' for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is both father and mother;--'May Soma come to me with immortality!' for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:27">5:1:5:27</a></font></span>27. He makes the horses smell it, with, 'Ye coursers!' for horses are coursers: therefore he says, 'Ye coursers! wealth-winners!' wealth is food: 'food-winners' he thereby says;--'having run the course--' for 'starting (upon the course)' he said before, as then they were indeed starting; but now he says, 'having run,' for they indeed have run (the race): therefore he says, 'having run;'--'smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion--' for this is B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion: therefore he says, 'Smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion;'--'taking (it) in!' whereby. he imbues the Sacrificer with energy. And as to why</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>he makes the horses smell,--he made them smell before, thinking, 'May I win this (world);' and now (he does so) thinking, 'I have won this (world) that is why he makes the horses smell.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:5:28">5:1:5:28</a></font></span>28. Now on one of those race-running (rival) chariots there has been standing either a Vai<i>s</i>ya, or a Râ<i>g</i>anya; he now sits down on the northern hip of the altar. Thereupon the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer, taking the honey-cup, step out by the front, door (of the cart-shed), and place it in the Vai<i>s</i>ya's, or Râ<i>g</i>anya's, hand. And the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, taking the cups of Surâ, steps out by the back door. He walks round by the back of the hall, and placing one (of the cups) in the Vai<i>s</i>ya's, or Râ<i>g</i>anya's, hand, he says, 'With this I buy Him of thee!' For the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Surâ is untruth, misery, darkness: he thus imbues the Sacrificer with truth, prosperity, and light; and smites the Vai<i>s</i>ya with untruth, misery, and darkness;--whatever benefit (or enjoyment) he desires, he obtains for himself by those (cups of Surâ). But that cup of honey he presents to the Brahman, together with the golden vessel. In presenting it to the Brahman, he imbues himself with immortal life; for gold is immortal life;--and whatsoever benefit he desires that he thereby obtains for himself.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_64"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_64">22:2</a> According to the Taittirîya ritualists, as quoted by Sâya<i>n</i>a (Taitt. S. I, 7, 8), the wheel after being mounted by the Brahman is to be turned round thrice in a sunwise motion;--the (pointed) end of the post being apparently inserted in the navel of the wheel, lying horizontally upon it. The turning wheel is there compared with the Va<i>g</i>ra, or disk-shaped thunderbolt. While the wheel is turning round its axle, the Brahman sings the Sâman. Cf. also Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. V, 12, 9 seq., according to which authority, however, the Brahman <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a> would seem only to put his arms on the wheel, and turn it round, while singing.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_65"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_65">23:1</a> Viz. the 'vâ<i>g</i>inâ<i>m</i> sâman' (Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>y. Br. 18; 7, 12), Sâmav. I, 435 'àvir maryâ â vâ<i>g</i>am vâ<i>g</i>ino agman,' &amp;c. 'The fiery steeds have gathered fiery mettle, the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>; win ye the heaven, O coursers!' Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. V, 12, 14. This singing of the Sâman takes place while the race lasts, the Brahman remaining all the time on the cart-wheel put up on a short post on (or near) the utkara, or heap of rubbish.--The author then anticipates in this and the next two paragraphs what the Brahman is to do when he descends from the wheel after the race is over. The placing of the drums next referred to must also be imagined as taking place whilst the Brahman is mounting the wheel.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_66"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_66">24:1</a> Besides the Sacrificer's chariot inside the vedi, sixteen others, each drawn by four horses, have been got ready, outside the vedi, for the race to the udumbara branch, as its goal and turning-point. In paragraphs <a href="sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:10">10</a>-<a href="sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:12">12</a> the author again anticipates what is to be done with the drums after the race has taken place, just in order to deal with that item of the ceremonial as a whole.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_67"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_67">25:1</a> That is, after (or at the same time when) the drums are put up. He is to shoot northwards through the space between the utkara and <i>k</i>âtvâla. At the end of the seventeenth arrow's range he plants an udumbara branch in the ground to serve as the goal round which the chariots are to turn sunwise on their way back to the sacrificial ground.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_68"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_68">25:2</a> Pronounce 'râ-<i>g</i>a-ní-a.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_69"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_69">25:3</a> In the Taittirîya ritual (Taitt. S. I, 7, 7, 2; Taitt. Br. I, 3, 5, 4) the Sacrificer steps up to the chariot with the three Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, with appropriate formulas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_70"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_70">26:1</a> That is, he does so whilst the cars are running; the offering or prayers being intended to make the Sacrificer's car win the race.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_71"></a><a href="sbe4107.htm#fr_71">28:1</a> That is, after the cars have come back, that of the Sacrificer keeping ahead of the others.</p>
