 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:1">5:5:5:1</a></font></span>1. He prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Vish<i>n</i>u. Now as to why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within V<i>ri</i>tra, to wit, the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, the Ya<i>g</i>us, and the Sâman. Indra wished to hurl the thunderbolt at him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:2">5:5:5:2</a></font></span>2. He said to Vish<i>n</i>u, 'I will hurl the thunderbolt at V<i>ri</i>tra, stand thou by me!'--'So be it!' said Vish<i>n</i>u, 'I will stand by thee: hurl it!' Indra aimed the thunderbolt at him. V<i>ri</i>tra was afraid of the raised thunderbolt.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:3">5:5:5:3</a></font></span>3. He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas. He (Indra) aimed at him a second time.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:4">5:5:5:4</a></font></span>4. He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Rik-verses. He aimed at him a third time.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:5">5:5:5:5</a></font></span>5. 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Sâman-hymns (or tunes). Therefore they spread the sacrifice even to this day in the same way with those (three) Vedas, first with the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas, then with the <i>Ri</i>k-verses, and then with the Sâman-hymns; for thus he (V<i>ri</i>tra) at that time gave them up to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:6">5:5:5:6</a></font></span>6. And that which had been his (V<i>ri</i>tra's) seat, his retreat, that he shattered, grasping it and tearing it out <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">1</font></a>: it became this offering. And because the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a threefold (tridhâtu) one, therefore this is called the Traidhâtavî (ish<i>t</i>i).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:7">5:5:5:7</a></font></span>7. And as to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vish<i>n</i>u, it is because Indra raised the thunderbolt, and Vish<i>n</i>u stood by him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:8">5:5:5:8</a></font></span>8. And why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve months in the year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year: therefore it is one of twelve potsherds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:9">5:5:5:9</a></font></span>9. He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas; then one of barley, that being a form of the <i>Ri</i>k-verses; then one of rice, that being a form of the Sâman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasânîyâ-ish<i>t</i>i (completing oblation) for the performer of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:10">5:5:5:10</a></font></span>10. For, verily, he who performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya gains for himself (the benefit of) all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; for him the sacrifice becomes as it were exhausted, and he, as it were, turns away from it. Now the whole sacrifice is just as great as that triple Veda; and this (offering) now is made a form of that (Veda, or</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacrifice); this is its womb, its seat: thus he commences once more the sacrifice by means of that triple Veda; and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted, and he does not turn away from it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:11">5:5:5:11</a></font></span>11. And, verily, he who performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this offering, the Traidhâtavî (ish<i>t</i>i), is instituted by the gods: 'May this offering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus he thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for him who performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:12">5:5:5:12</a></font></span>12. And also for him who would give (to the priests) a thousand (cows) or more <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">1</font></a>, let this be the completing offering. For he who gives a thousand or more becomes as it were emptied out; and that triple Veda is the thousandfold progeny of Vâ<i>k</i> (speech): him who was emptied out he thus fills up again with a thousand; and therefore let it be for him also the completing offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:13">5:5:5:13</a></font></span>13. And also for those who would sit through (perform) a long sacrificial session <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for a year or more, let this be the completing offering. For by those who sit through a long sacrificial session, for a year or more, everything is obtained, everything conquered; but this (offering) is everything: let it therefore be for them also the completing offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:14">5:5:5:14</a></font></span>14. And indeed one may also practise magic by this (offering); for it was thereby that Âra<i>n</i>i bewitched</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Bhadrasena Â<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atrava <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">1</font></a>: 'Quick, then, spread (the barhis)!' thus Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya used to say. And by this (offering) indeed Indra also shattered V<i>ri</i>tra's retreat; and, verily, he who therewith practises magic shatters thereby the retreat (of his enemy): therefore one may also practise magic with this (offering).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:15">5:5:5:15</a></font></span>15. And, indeed, one may also heal thereby; for, verily, whomsoever one would heal by a single <i>ri</i><i>k</i>, by a single ya<i>g</i>us, by a single sâman, him he would indeed render free from disease; how much more so by the triple Veda! Therefore one may also heal by this (offering).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:16">5:5:5:16</a></font></span>16. Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">2</font></a> each are the sacrificial fee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgât<i>ri</i>), nor recites (like the Hot<i>ri</i>), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred mânas each.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:17">5:5:5:17</a></font></span>17. Three milch cows (he gives) to the Hot<i>ri</i>;--for three milch cows mean abundance, and the Hot<i>ri</i> means abundance: therefore (he gives) three milch cows to the Hot<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:18">5:5:5:18</a></font></span>18. Three garments (he gives) to the Adhvaryu;--for the Adhvaryu 'spreads' the sacrifice, and the garments spread themselves (over the body) <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">1</font></a>: therefore (he gives) three garments to the Adhvaryu. A bullock (he gives) to the Agnîdh <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:5:5:19">5:5:5:19</a></font></span>19. Now there are here either twelve, or thirteen gifts <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and there are either twelve or thirteen months in the year;--the offering thus is of equal measure with the year: that is why there are either twelve or thirteen sacrificial gifts.</p>
