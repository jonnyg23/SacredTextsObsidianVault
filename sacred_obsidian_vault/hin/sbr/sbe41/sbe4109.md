 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:1">5:2:2:1</a></font></span>1. He now proceeds with the Bârhaspatya pap. Its svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t remains yet unoffered, when he (the Adhvaryu) brings <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">2</font></a> him (the Sacrificer) some food; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins food, vâ<i>g</i>apeya being the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he (the Sacrificer) has thereby gained, that he (the Adhvaryu) now brings to him.</p>

In a vessel of udumbara wood--the Udumbara tree being sustenance, (that is) food--for the obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is in a vessel of udumbara wood. He first brings water, then milk, then (other) kinds of food, as they occur to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:3">5:2:2:3</a></font></span>3. Now some bring seventeen kinds of food,</p>

 <p>saying, 'Seventeenfold is Pra<i>g</i>âpati.' But let him not do so: surely all the food is not appropriated to Pra<i>g</i>âpati <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and, compared to him, what is man that he should appropriate to himself all food? Hence, while bringing every kind of food that occurs to him, let him not bring of some one (particular) kind of food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:4">5:2:2:4</a></font></span>4. And whatever food he does trot bring to him, let him (the Sacrificer) forswear <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">2</font></a> that, and not eat of it as long as he lives: thus he does not go to the end, thus he lives long. Of all that food brought together he offers the (seven) Vâ<i>g</i>a-prasavanîya <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">3</font></a> oblations, cutting out (pieces) with the dipping-spoon. Thus to whatever deities he is now offering, they give an impulse to him, and impelled by them he</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:5">5:2:2:5</a></font></span>5. He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 23-29), 'The impulse of strength impelled of old that king Soma in the plants, in the waters: may they be rich in honey for us! may we be wakeful in the kingdom, placed in the front, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:6">5:2:2:6</a></font></span>6. 'The impulse of strength spread over this sky, and over all these worlds, as the all-ruler; knowing he causeth him to give gifts who wisheth not to give: may he bestow upon us wealth with the full muster of heroes, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:7">5:2:2:7</a></font></span>7. 'Yea, the impulse of strength prevailed over all these worlds, on every side; from days of yore the king goeth about knowing, increasing the people, and the well-being amongst us, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:8">5:2:2:8</a></font></span>8. 'To king Soma, to Agni we cling <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">1</font></a> for help, to the Âdityas, to Vish<i>n</i>u, to Sûrya, to the Brahman B<i>ri</i>haspati, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:9">5:2:2:9</a></font></span>9. 'Urge thou Aryaman, B<i>ri</i>haspati, Indra to the giving of gifts, Vâ<i>k</i> <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Vish<i>n</i>u, Sarasvatî, and the vigorous Savit<i>ri</i>, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:10">5:2:2:10</a></font></span>10. 'O Agni, speak to us here, be thou gracious unto us! bestow blessings upon us, O winner of thousands, for thou art the giver of wealth, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:11">5:2:2:11</a></font></span>11. 'May Aryaman bestow blessings upon us, and Pûshan, and B<i>ri</i>haspati! may the divine Vâ<i>k</i> give us gifts, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:12">5:2:2:12</a></font></span>12. With the remaining (offering material) he sprinkles him (the Sacrificer); he thereby sprinkles</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>him with food, bestows food upon him: for this reason he sprinkles him with the remaining (material) <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:13">5:2:2:13</a></font></span>13. He sprinkles with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 30), 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, (I sprinkle) thee, by the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, by the hands of Pûshan!' he thus sprinkles (consecrates) him by the hands of gods;--'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvatî Vâ<i>k</i>, the leader;' for Sarasvatî is Vâ<i>k</i> (speech): he thus places him in the leading of Vâ<i>k</i>, the leader.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:14">5:2:2:14</a></font></span>14. Here now some say, 'I place thee in the leading of the leader of all the gods;' for all the gods are the All: he thus places him in the leading of the leader of the All. But let him not say so; let him rather say, 'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvatî Vâ<i>k</i>;' for Sarasvatî is Vâ<i>k</i>: he thus places him in the leading of Vâ<i>k</i>.--'I consecrate thee, N.N., with the supreme rulership of B<i>ri</i>haspati!' therewith he mentions the (Sacrificer's) name: he thus makes him attain to the fellowship of B<i>ri</i>haspati, and to co-existence in his world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:15">5:2:2:15</a></font></span>15. He then says,' All-ruler is he, N.N.! All-ruler is he, N.N.!' Him, thus indicated, he thereby indicates to the gods: 'Of mighty power is he who has been consecrated; he has become one of yours; protect him!' thus he thereby says. Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:16">5:2:2:16</a></font></span>16. He then either offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas of) the U<i>g</i><i>g</i>iti oblations <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Whether he offers or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the significance is the same.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:17">5:2:2:17</a></font></span>17. He makes him say (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 31-34), 'With the (word of) one syllable Agni won the breath: may I win that!-- -- <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">2</font></a> With the (metre of) seventeen syllables Pra<i>g</i>âpati won the seventeenfold stoma: may I win that!' whatever those deities won by means of those (formulas), that he now wins by them. There are seventeen (formulas), for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:18">5:2:2:18</a></font></span>18. Thereupon he says, 'Recite (the invitatory formula) to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t!' Now, as to why this rite is performed between two oblations. Pra<i>g</i>âpati, truly, is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and, indeed, they are even now produced after this one: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati in the very middle: therefore that rite is performed between two oblations. Having made (the Âgnîdhra) utter the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t!' and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:19">5:2:2:19</a></font></span>19. He then puts the I<i>d</i>â on (the i<i>d</i>âpâtrî). The I<i>d</i>â having been invoked <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he, having touched water, draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he sets the chant agoing <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">2</font></a>. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the Stotra, in attendance at the <i>S</i>astra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:20">5:2:2:20</a></font></span>20. Here now some, having performed that, perform that <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">3</font></a>; but let him not do it thus; for the Stotra is his (the Sacrificer's) own self, and the <i>S</i>astra is his people (or <a href="errata.htm#7">offspring</a>): thereby then he ruins the Sacrificer; he goes astray, he stumbles;--hence having performed that, let him perform that:--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:2:21">5:2:2:21</a></font></span>21. He puts the I<i>d</i>â on (the dish). The I<i>d</i>â having been invoked, he, having touched water, draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he sets the (P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-) Stotra agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation (<i>s</i>astra).</p>

Of this his food that has been brought together, let him set aside (uddharet) one (particular kind of) food: let him forswear that (tad udbruvîta), and not eat of it as long as he lives (yâva<i>g</i> <i>g</i>îvet). By that much also (or, even so long, tâvad api vai prâ<i>g</i>apate<i>h</i> sarvam annam anavaruddham) all the food of Pra<i>g</i>âpati is not appropriated; and who is man (compared) to him, that he should appropriate to himself all food?
