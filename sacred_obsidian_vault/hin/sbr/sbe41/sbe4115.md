 <p>and Soma. Having performed the offering of the omentum thereof; he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Thereupon the offerings of the Divine Quickeners (Devasû) are prepared.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:2">5:3:3:2</a></font></span>2. For Savit<i>ri</i> Satyaprasava (of true impulse) he prepares a cake from fast-grown (plâ<i>s</i>uka) rice <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">2</font></a>, on either twelve, or eight, potsherds; for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods: 'May I be quickened <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">3</font></a>, impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>!' thus (he thinks). And as to (its being) of fast-grown rice: 'May they quickly impel me!' he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:3">5:3:3:3</a></font></span>3. For Agni G<i>ri</i>hapati (the house-lord) he then prepares a cake on eight potsherds from quick-grown (â<i>s</i>u) rice <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for the house-lord's position means prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, over</p>

 <p>that Agni, the house-lord, leads him to hold the position of a master of the house. And as to its being of quick-grown rice: 'May they quickly lead me!' so he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:4">5:3:3:4</a></font></span>4. For Soma Vanaspati (the wood-lord or tree) he then prepares a pap of <i>s</i>yâmâka millet: thereby Soma, the wood-lord, quickens him for the plants. And as to its being prepared of <i>s</i>yâmâka,--they, the <i>s</i>yâmâkas among plants doubtless are most manifestly Soma's own: therefore it is prepared of <i>s</i>yâmâka grain.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:5">5:3:3:5</a></font></span>5. For B<i>ri</i>haspati Vâ<i>k</i> <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">1</font></a> (speech) he then prepares a pap of wild rice: thereby B<i>ri</i>haspati quickens him for speech. And as to its being prepared of wild rice,--B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and they, the wild rice-plants, are ripened by the Brahman <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">2</font></a>: hence it is prepared of wild rice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:6">5:3:3:6</a></font></span>6. For Indra <i>G</i>yesh<i>th</i>a (the most excellent) he then prepares a pap of red rice-grains (hâyana) <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">3</font></a>: thereby Indra, the most excellent, leads him to excellence (or, lordship). And as to its being prepared of red rice: outstanding doubtless are those plants, the red rice, and outstanding is Indra: therefore it is prepared of red rice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:7">5:3:3:7</a></font></span>7. For Rudra Pa<i>s</i>upati (lord of beasts) he then prepares a Raudra pap of gavedhukâ seeds (coix barbata): thereby Rudra, the lord of beasts, quickens</p>

 <p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a></p>  
 <p>him for cattle. And as to its being prepared of gavedhukâ seed;--that God is (the recipient of) refuse (remains of offering), and gavedhukâ seeds are refuse: therefore it is (prepared) of gavedhukâ seed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:8">5:3:3:8</a></font></span>8. For Mitra Satya (the True) he then prepares a pap of Nâmba <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">1</font></a> seed: thereby Mitra the True quickens him for the Brahman. And as to its being prepared of Nâmba seed,--to Varu<i>n</i>a, no doubt, belong those plants which grow in ploughed ground; but those, the Nâmba plants, belong to Mitra: therefore it is (prepared) of Nâmba seed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:9">5:3:3:9</a></font></span>9. For Varu<i>n</i>a Dharmapati (the lord of the law) he then prepares a Varu<i>n</i>a pap of barley: thereby Varu<i>n</i>a, the lord of the law, makes him lord of the law; and that truly is the supreme state, when one is lord of the law; for whosoever attains to the supreme state, to him they come in (matters of) law: therefore to Varu<i>n</i>a Dharmapati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:10">5:3:3:10</a></font></span>10. He then proceeds with the cake for Agni-Soma. The Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of that (oblation) remains yet unoffered, when he proceeds with those (other) oblations.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:11">5:3:3:11</a></font></span>11. Thereupon, taking hold of him (the Sacrificer) by the right arm, he mutters (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 39, 40), 'May Savit<i>ri</i> quicken thee for (powers of) quickening (ruling) <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Agni for householders, Soma for trees, B<i>ri</i>haspati for speech, Indra for lordship, Rudra for cattle, Mitra for truth, Varu<i>n</i>a for the lord of the law.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:12">5:3:3:12</a></font></span>12. 'Quicken him, O gods, to be unrivalled!'</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> --he thereby says, 'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an enemy; for great chiefdom, for great lordship!' in this there is nothing obscure;--'for man-rule!' 'for the ruling of men,' he thereby says;--'for Indra's energy!' 'for vigour' he means to say when he says, 'for Indra's energy;'--'him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and such (a woman),'--whatever be his parentage, with reference to that he says this;--'of such and such a people,' that is to say, of the people whose king he is;--'this man, O ye (people) <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is your king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!' He thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king); the Brâhman alone he excepts: therefore the Brâhman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma for his king.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:13">5:3:3:13</a></font></span>13. Now those gods have the power of quickening, whence their name 'devasû' (Divine Quickeners). It is those gods who now quicken him thus, and quickened (consecrated) by them he will be consecrated on the morrow.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:14">5:3:3:14</a></font></span>14. They are double-named, for a coupling means strength: 'May the strong quicken (him),' thus he thinks, and therefore they are double-named.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:3:3:15">5:3:3:15</a></font></span>15. He now says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.' And as to why that ceremony is performed here between two offerings <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--verily Pra<i>g</i>âpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which all these creatures were produced,--</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>  
 <p>and so they are even now produced after this one. Thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the very middle of that Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and quickens him in the middle: this is why that ceremony is performed between two offerings. Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>. he says, 'Urge for Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t!' and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is pronounced.</p>

The Dîkshâ is performed immediately after the expiration of the dark fortnight following the full-moon of Phalgunî, that is to say, on the first day of <i>K</i>aitra (about the middle of March).--According to Katy. XV, 3, 47 both the Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya and Da<i>s</i>apeya require special offering-places, the latter being north of the former.
