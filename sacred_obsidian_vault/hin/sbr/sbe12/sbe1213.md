 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:1">1:3:2:1</a></font></span>1. Now the sacrifice is the man. The sacrifice is the man for the reason that the man spreads (performs) it; and that in being spread it is made of exactly the same extent as the man <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">1</font></a>: this is the reason why the sacrifice is the man.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:2">1:3:2:2</a></font></span>2. The <i>g</i>uhû (spoon) further belongs to that (man-shaped sacrifice), and so does the upabh<i>ri</i>t; and the dhruvâ <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">2</font></a> represents its trunk. Now it is from the</p>

 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>trunk that all these limbs proceed, and for this reason the entire sacrifice proceeds from the dhruvâ.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:3">1:3:2:3</a></font></span>3. The dipping-spoon (sruva, masc.) is no other than the breath. This breath passes through (or, goes to) all the limbs, and for that reason the dipping-spoon goes to all the offering-spoons (sru<i>k</i>, fem.).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:4">1:3:2:4</a></font></span>4. That <i>g</i>uhû further is to him no other than yonder sky, and the upabh<i>ri</i>t this atmosphere, and the dhruvâ this same (earth). Now it is from this (earth) that all the worlds originate: and from the dhruvâ, therefore, the whole sacrifice proceeds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:5">1:3:2:5</a></font></span>5. The dipping-spoon then is no other than that blowing one (the wind); it is this that sweeps across all these worlds: and for that reason the sruva goes to all the offering-spoons.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:6">1:3:2:6</a></font></span>6. Now when this sacrifice is being performed, it is performed for the gods, the seasons, and the metres (or sacred texts). To the gods belongs what sacrificial food there is, to wit, king Soma and the sacrificial cake: all this he takes, while announcing it with the formula, 'I take thee, agreeable to so and so!' for thus it becomes theirs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:7">1:3:2:7</a></font></span>7. And whatever oblations of butter are taken, they are taken for the seasons and the metres. Every one of them he takes in the form of butter without announcing it (to any particular deity). In the <i>g</i>uhû he takes of it four times (with the sruva from the pot), in the upabh<i>ri</i>t eight times <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:8">1:3:2:8</a></font></span>8. Now when he takes of it four times (with the sruva) in the <i>g</i>uhû, he takes it for the seasons, since</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>he takes it for the fore-offerings <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the fore-offerings are the seasons: all this he takes in the form of butter without making any announcement, in order to avoid sameness; for if he were to take it with the formulas 'For Spring (I take) thee!' 'For Summer--thee!' he would commit (the fault of) a repetition <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any announcement.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:9">1:3:2:9</a></font></span>9. When, on the other hand, he takes eight times (with the sruva) in the upabh<i>ri</i>t, he takes it for the metres <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">3</font></a>, since it is for the after-offerings <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">1</font></a> that he takes it; and the after-offerings are the metres: all this he takes in the form of butter without making any announcement, in order to avoid sameness; for were he to take it with the formulas 'For the Gâyatrî--thee!' 'For the Trish<i>t</i>ubh--thee!' he would commit a repetition: he therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any announcement.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:10">1:3:2:10</a></font></span>10. Again, when he takes four times (with the sruva)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the dhruvâ, he takes it for the whole sacrifice, and all this he takes in the form of butter without making any announcement. To whom indeed should he announce it, since he cuts it off for all the deities? He therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any announcement.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:11">1:3:2:11</a></font></span>11. Now the sacrificer stands behind the <i>g</i>uhû, and he who means evil to him stands behind the upabh<i>ri</i>t. The eater stands behind the <i>g</i>uhû, and what (or, he who) is to be eaten stands behind the upabh<i>ri</i>t. And the <i>g</i>uhû, indeed, is the eater, and the upabh<i>ri</i>t is that which is to be eaten. In the <i>g</i>uhû he takes four times (with the sruva), and in the upabh<i>ri</i>t eight times.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:12">1:3:2:12</a></font></span>12. Now when he takes four times (butter) in the <i>g</i>uhû, he thereby makes the eater more limited, smaller; and when he takes eight times in the upabh<i>ri</i>t, he makes that which is to be eaten more unlimited, more abundant: for a flourishing condition indeed exists where the eater is smaller and that which is to be eaten more abundant.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:13">1:3:2:13</a></font></span>13. In taking four times in the <i>g</i>uhû, he takes (altogether) more butter, and in taking eight times in the upabh<i>ri</i>t he takes less butter.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:14">1:3:2:14</a></font></span>14. For when, in taking four times (butter with the sruva) in the <i>g</i>uhû, he takes more butter, he thereby, in making the eater more limited, smaller, imparts vigour and strength to him. And when, in taking eight times in the upabh<i>ri</i>t, he takes less butter, he thereby, in making that which (or, him who) is to be eaten more unlimited, more abundant, makes it (or, him) vigourless and weaker. And thus a king who has established himself among a numberless people, subdues them even from a single dwelling,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p>and takes possession of whatever he likes <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">1</font></a>: with that very same energy (the Adhvaryu acts) when he takes a greater quantity of butter in the <i>g</i>uhû. Now what he takes in the <i>g</i>uhû, that he offers with the <i>g</i>uhû; and what he takes in the upabh<i>ri</i>t, that also he offers with the <i>g</i>uhû.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:15">1:3:2:15</a></font></span>15. And in reference to this point they say: 'Wherefore then is he to take it in the upabh<i>ri</i>t, if he does not offer it with the upabh<i>ri</i>t?' Now, if he were to offer it with the upabh<i>ri</i>t, those subjects (of the king) would assuredly become separated from him, nor would there be either an eater or what is to be eaten. When, on the other hand, he pours (the butter) together and thus offers it with the <i>g</i>uhû, thereby the people pay tribute to the Kshatriya. Hence by what he takes in the upabh<i>ri</i>t, the Vai<i>s</i>ya (man of the people), under the rule of the Kshatriya, becomes possessed of cattle; and when he pours (the butter) together and offers it with the <i>g</i>uhû, thereby the Kshatriya, whenever he likes, says, 'Hallo Vai<i>s</i>ya, just bring to me what thou hast stored away!' Thus he both subdues him and obtains possession of anything he wishes by dint of this very energy.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:16">1:3:2:16</a></font></span>16. These butter-portions, then, are taken for the metres. Now what he takes in the <i>g</i>uhû (by ladling) four times (with the sruva), that he takes for the gâyatrî; and what he takes in the upabh<i>ri</i>t (by ladling) eight times, that he takes for the trish<i>t</i>ubh and <i>g</i>agatî; and what he takes in the dhruvâ (by</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p>ladling) four times, that he takes for the anush<i>t</i>ubh. For the anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and from speech all this (universe) springs: hence it is from the dhruvâ that the whole sacrifice originates. The anush<i>t</i>ubh also is this (earth), and from it all this (universe) originates: hence it is from the dhruvâ that the whole sacrifice originates.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:17">1:3:2:17</a></font></span>17. He takes (butter with the sruva), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 31), 'Verily, thou art the favourite resort (or, dainty) of the gods!' He thereby makes that butter the most favourite resort of the gods: for this reason he says, 'verily, thou art the favourite resort of the gods!'--'An unassailable means of worship!' the butter is indeed a thunderbolt: therefore he says, 'an unassailable means of worship!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:3:2:18">1:3:2:18</a></font></span>18. Once he puts (butter with the sruva) into the <i>g</i>uhû with this formula, three times silently. With the same formula he puts (butter) once into the upabh<i>ri</i>t, seven times silently. With the same formula he puts once (butter) into the dhruvâ, three times silently. Now, as to this, they say, 'Thrice he should take with the formula in each case, for threefold is the sacrifice.' Nevertheless (it is done) only once with each (spoon), for it is just in this way that the taking thrice (with a formula) is accomplished.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_236"></a><a href="sbe1213.htm#fr_236">78:1</a> The sacrifice is the representation of the sacrificer himself; and hence its dimensions are to be those of a man, viz. the altar (vedi) on its western side is to measure a fathom, or space between the extreme ends of the outstretched arms (? of the sacrificer), which is supposed to be equal to the size of a man; see I, 2, 5, 14. Originally these measurements were no doubt relative to the size of the sacrificer; but it is doubtful whether this was still the case at the time of our author.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_237"></a><a href="sbe1213.htm#fr_237">78:2</a> For a description of these spoons, see <a href="sbe1211.htm#page_67">p. 67</a>, note <a href="sbe1212.htm#fn_207">2</a>. The <i>g</i>uhû is supposed to represent the right, and the upabh<i>ri</i>t the left arm, and the dhruvâ the trunk.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_238"></a><a href="sbe1213.htm#fr_238">79:1</a> He takes butter in the <i>g</i>uhû and upabh<i>ri</i>t by four or eight ladlings with the dipping-spoon. As we learn further on, the quantity taken in the <i>g</i>uhû, by ladling four times, should exceed that in the upabh<i>ri</i>t, although the latter requires eight ladlings. Cf. Katy. II, 7, 13.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_239"></a><a href="sbe1213.htm#fr_242">80:1</a> On the prayâ<i>g</i>as, or oblations of clarified butter introductory to, and the anuyâ<i>g</i>as, oblations of the same material made subsequently to, the chief sacrifice, see I, 5, 3, 1 seq., and I, 8, 2, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_240"></a><a href="sbe1213.htm#fr_240">80:2</a> Repetition of one and the same sacrificial act on the same day is to be avoided, as far as possible. The repetition in the present case would consist in his announcing the butter-oblations to the several deities in the same way as he has done in regard to the rice-portions. See I, 1, 2, 17-18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_241"></a><a href="sbe1213.htm#fr_241">80:3</a> On the frequent symbolical employment of the metres in the ritual, as the embodiment of supreme harmony and the efficacy of prayer, see Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, 8 seq. The three principal Vedic metres are the gâyatrî (three times eight syllables), the trish<i>t</i>ubh (four times eleven syllables), and the <i>g</i>agatî (four times twelve syllables); and three anuyâ<i>g</i>as there are at these sacrifices, viz. to the barhis or sacrificial grass, to Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa and Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t respectively. In the present instance (see par. 16) the trish<i>t</i>ubh and <i>g</i>agatî metres are taken together as one, and as a fourth is added the anush<i>t</i>ubh (four times eight syllables).</p>
