 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:1">2:1:2:1</a></font></span>1. He may set up the two fires <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">1</font></a> under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs; for they, the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs, are doubtless Agni's asterism, so that if he sets up his fires under Agni's asterism, (he will bring about) a correspondence (between his fires and the asterism): for this reason he may set up his fires under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:2">2:1:2:2</a></font></span>2. Moreover, the other lunar asterisms (consist of) one, two, three or four (stars), so that the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs are the most numerous (of asterisms) <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">2</font></a>: hence he thereby obtains an abundance. For this reason he may set up his fires under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:3">2:1:2:3</a></font></span>3. And again, they do not move away from the eastern quarter, whilst the other asterisms do move from the eastern quarter. Thus his (two fires) are established in the eastern quarter: for this reason he may set up his fires under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:4">2:1:2:4</a></font></span>4. On the other hand (it is argued) why he should not set up the fires under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs. Originally, namely, the latter were the wives of the Bears (<i>ri</i>ksha); for the seven <i>Ri</i>shis <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">3</font></a> were in former times</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a></p>  
 <p>called the <i>Ri</i>kshas (bears). They were, however, precluded from intercourse (with their husbands), for the latter, the seven <i>Ri</i>shis, rise in the north, and they (the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs) in the east. Now it is a misfortune for one to be precluded from intercourse (with his wife): he should therefore not set up his fires under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs, lest he should thereby be precluded from intercourse.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:5">2:1:2:5</a></font></span>5. But he may nevertheless set up (his fire under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs); for Agni doubtless is their mate, and it is with Agni that they have intercourse: for this reason he may set up (the fire under the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:6">2:1:2:6</a></font></span>6. He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of Rohi<i>n</i>î. For under Rohi<i>n</i>î it was that Pra<i>g</i>âpati, when desirous of progeny (or creatures), set up his fires. He created beings, and the creatures produced by him remained invariable and constant <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">1</font></a>, like (red) cows (rohi<i>n</i>î): hence the cow-like nature of Rohi<i>n</i>î. Rich in cattle and offspring therefore he becomes whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Rohi<i>n</i>î.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:7">2:1:2:7</a></font></span>7. Under Rohi<i>n</i>î, indeed, the cattle set up their fires, thinking that they might attain to (ruh) the desire (or love) of men. They did attain to the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a></p>  
 <p>desire of men; and whatever desire the cattle then obtained in regard to men, that same desire he obtains, in regard to cattle, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under Rohi<i>n</i>î.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:8">2:1:2:8</a></font></span>8. He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of) M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha. For M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha, indeed, is the head of Pra<i>g</i>âpati <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and the head (<i>s</i>iras) means excellence (<i>s</i>rî), for the head does indeed mean excellence: hence they say of him who is the most excellent (<i>s</i>resh<i>th</i>a) of a community, that he is the head of that community. Excellence therefore he attains whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:9">2:1:2:9</a></font></span>9. On the other hand (it is argued) why one should not set up his fire under M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The latter, indeed, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's body. Now, when they (the gods) on that occasion pierced him <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">3</font></a> with what is called 'the three-knotted arrow,' he abandoned that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a></p>  
 <p>body, for the body is a mere relic (or dwelling, vâstu), unholy and sapless. He should therefore not set up his fires under M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:10">2:1:2:10</a></font></span>10. But he may, nevertheless, set them up (under M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha). For, assuredly, the body of that god, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, is neither a relic nor unholy, <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he may therefore set up (his fires under M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha). 'Under the Punarvasû he should perform the Punarâdheya <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' thus (it is prescribed).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:11">2:1:2:11</a></font></span>11. He may also set up his fires under the Phalgunîs. They, the Phalgunîs, are Indra's asterism <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and even correspond to him in name; for indeed Indra is also called Ar<i>g</i>una, this being his mystic name; and they (the Phalgunîs) are also called Ar<i>g</i>unîs. Hence he overtly calls them Phalgunîs, for who dares to use his (the god's) mystic name? Moreover, the sacrificer himself is Indra, so that he in that case sets up his fires under his own asterism. Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; and accordingly his Agnyâdheya is thereby brought</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a></p>  
 <p>into relation with Indra. He may set up the fires under the first (Pûrva-phalgunîs)--whereby an advancing (successful) sacrifice accrues to him; or he may set them up under the second (Uttara-phalgunîs)--whereby a progressive (uttarâvat) improvement accrues to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:12">2:1:2:12</a></font></span>12. Let him set up his fires under the asterism Hasta <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whosoever should wish that (presents) should be offered him: then indeed (that will take place) forthwith; for whatever is offered with the hand (hasta), that indeed is given to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:13">2:1:2:13</a></font></span>13. He may also set up his fires under <i>K</i>itrâ. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, were contending for superiority. Both parties were desirous of rising to yonder world, the sky. The Asuras then constructed the fire (altar) called rauhi<i>n</i>a (fit to ascend by), thinking, 'Thereby we shall ascend (â-ruh) to the sky <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:14">2:1:2:14</a></font></span>14. Indra then considered <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">1</font></a>, 'If they construct that (fire-altar), they will certainly prevail over us.' He secured a brick and proceeded thither, passing himself off for a Brâhman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:15">2:1:2:15</a></font></span>15. 'Hark ye!' he said, 'I, too, will put on this (brick) for myself!' 'Very well,' they replied. He put it on. That fire (altar) of theirs wanted but very little to be completely built up,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:16">2:1:2:16</a></font></span>16. When he said, 'I shall take back this (brick) which belongs to me.' He took hold of it and pulled it out; and on its being pulled out, the fire-altar fell down; and along with the falling fire-altar the Asuras fell down. He then converted those bricks into thunderbolts and clove the (Asuras') necks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:17">2:1:2:17</a></font></span>17. Thereupon the gods assembled and said, 'Wonderfully (<i>k</i>itram) indeed it has fared with us who have slain so many enemies!' Hence the wonderful nature (<i>k</i>itrâtva) <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the asterism</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>K</i>itrâ; and verily wonderfully it fares with him, and he slays his rivals, his spiteful enemy, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under <i>K</i>itrâ. A Kshatriya, therefore, should especially desire to take advantage of this asterism; since such a one is anxious to strike, to vanquish his enemies.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:18">2:1:2:18</a></font></span>18. Originally these (nakshatras) were so many different powers (kshatra), just as that sun yonder. But as soon as he rose, he took from them (â-dâ) their energy, their power; therefore he (the sun) is called Âditya, because he took from them their energy, their power <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:1:2:19">2:1:2:19</a></font></span>19. The gods then said, 'They who have been powers, shall no longer (na) be powers (kshatra) <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' Hence the powerlessness (na-kshatratvam) of the nakshatras. For this reason also one need only take the sun for one's nakshatra (star), since he took away from them their energy, their power. But if he (the sacrificer) should nevertheless be desirous of having a nakshatra (under which to set up his fires), then assuredly that sun is a faultless nakshatra for him; and through that auspicious day (marked by the rising and setting of the sun) he should endeavour to obtain the benefits of whichever of those asterisms he might desire. Let him therefore take the sun alone for his nakshatra <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

Hence the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs are also called Bahulâs, 'the numerous.' In the later accounts, however, a larger number of stars is attributed to several nakshatras. Cf. Weber, Nakshatra, II, pp. 368, 381. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has: 'Other nakshatras are (i.e. consist of) four; and there is here an abundance, so that he thereby obtains abundance.'</p>

In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 2, it is stated that Pra<i>g</i>âpati created Agni under (the asterism) Rohi<i>n</i>î, and that the gods then set up that fire under the same asterism.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_652"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_656">284:1</a> For the mythical allusions in this and the succeeding paragraphs, we have to compare <i>S</i>at. Br. I, 7, 4, 1; Ait. Br. III, 33. According to the version of the myth given in the latter work, Pra<i>g</i>âpati transformed himself into a roe-buck (<i>ri</i><i>s</i>ya) and approached his own daughter (either the sky, or the dawn), who had assumed the shape of a doe (rohit). Out of their most fearful forms the gods then fashioned a divine being called Bhûtavat (i.e. Rudra), in order to punish Pra<i>g</i>âpati for his incestuous deed. The latter was accordingly pierced by Bhûtavat's arrow and bounded up to the sky, where he became the constellation called M<i>ri</i>ga (i.e. M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha), while his daughter became the asterism Rohi<i>n</i>î. The arrow on the other hand, with which Pra<i>g</i>âpati was pierced, became the constellation called 'the three-knotted arrow (perhaps the girdle of Orion).'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_654"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_658">284:3</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, 'When, on that occasion, that god (viz. Rudra) pierced him with the three-knotted arrow.'</p>

The direction has been inserted in this place on account of the position of Punarvasû, as the fifth mansion, between M<i>ri</i>ga<i>s</i>îrsha, the third, and (Pûrva and Uttara) Phalgunîs, the ninth and tenth mansions, in the original order of the nakshatras.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_657"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_661">285:3</a> In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 4, the Pûrve Phalgunî are assigned to Aryaman, and the Uttare Phalgunî to Bhaga. While, however, both these asterisms are there recommended for the agnyâdheya, the Pûrve Phalgunî are rejected as unsuitable further on, in par. 8 (? a later addition).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_658"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_662">286:1</a> In the Taitt. Br. this asterism is not mentioned as suitable for the agnyâdheya. The Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>. II, 1, to omits both Hasta and <i>K</i>itrâ; but permits the asterisms Vi<i>s</i>âkhe and Uttare Prosh<i>th</i>apade.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_659"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_663">286:2</a> In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 4-6 this myth is related as follows: 'There were Asuras, named Kâlaka<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>as. They constructed a fire (altar) with a view to (gaining) the world of heaven. They put, every man of them, a brick to it. Indra, passing himself off for a Brâhman, put a brick on for himself, saying, "This one, <i>K</i>îtra (the wonderful or bright one) by name, is for me!" They climbed up to heaven; Indra, however, pulled out his brick, and they tumbled down. And they who tumbled down, became spiders: two of them flew up, and they became the two heavenly dogs.' On this myth, Dr. A. Kuhn, 'Über entwickelungsstufen der mythenbildung,' p. 129, remarks: 'The myth given in Homer's Od. xi, 305-325, of Otos and Ephialtes, who, in order to fight the immortal gods, piled Ossa on Olympos, and Pelion on Ossa, of ἵν᾽ οὐρανὸς, and who are destroyed by Apollon, shows an obvious resemblance to these Indian myths; the more so, if we divest the latter of their Brâhmanical form, by which altar-bricks are substituted <a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a> for mountains; and if we hear in mind that the later versions of the myth, e.g. in the well-known passage of Ovid, put the Gigantes in the place of the Aloades.' See also Weber, Nakshatra, II, p. 372.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_660"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_664">287:1</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text here proceeds thus: The gods then were afraid and said, 'If those (Asuras) complete (samâsyanti) that (fire-altar), they will prevail over us.' Then Indra having fastened a brick with the lightning-band (ârke<i>n</i>a dâmnâ) went thither passing himself off for a Brâhman. He said, 'I, too, will put on this (brick) for myself.' They said, 'On then (upa hi)!' He put it on. That (fire-altar) wanted but very little to be built up, when he said, 'I shall take this (brick) which is mine,' Take it then (â hi)!' they said. Then seizing it (tâm abhihâya) he pulled it out. On its being pulled out the fire-altar tumbled down. On the fire-altar having tumbled down he made thunderbolts with those bricks and smote those (Asuras). Then the gods prevailed and the Asuras were worsted, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_661"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_665">287:2</a> Or, perhaps, its identity with (Indra's brick) <i>K</i>itrâ; cf. preceding note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_662"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_666">288:1</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads: Tâni ha vâ etâni kshatrâ<i>n</i>i nânaiva tepur yathâsau vâ sûrya<i>s</i> <i>k</i>andramâ vâ; teshâ<i>m</i> hodyann evâditya<i>h</i> kshatra<i>m</i> vîrya<i>m</i> tega<i>h</i> pralulopa, tad vaishâm âdade.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_663"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_667">288:2</a> This etymology of nakshatra is of course quite fanciful. For Aufrecht's probably correct derivation of the word from nakta-tra, 'night-protector,' cf. Zeitschrift für vergl. Sprachf., VIII, pp. 71, 72. See also Weber, Nakshatra; II, p. 268.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_664"></a><a href="sbe1241.htm#fr_668">288:3</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads: Tasmân na nakshatram âdriyeta yadaivaisha kadâ <i>k</i>odîyâd apy âdadhîtaisha hi sarvâ<i>n</i>i kshatrâ<i>n</i>i <a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 289</font></a> yadyu nakshatrakâma<i>h</i> syâd upo âsîta nakshatram ahâsya bhavati no etasyânudayo ’sti tasmâd v apy upaina(m â)sîta, 'he need therefore not attend to any nakshatra; but may set up his fires at any time when that (sun) rises, for he (the sun) is all the kshatras.
