Verily, whoever exists, he, in being born, is born as (owing) a debt to the gods, to the <i>Ri</i>shis, to the fathers, and to men <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_437"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:2">1:7:2:2</a></font></span>2. For, inasmuch as he is bound to sacrifice, for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to the gods: hence when he sacrifices to them, when he makes</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a></p>  
 <p>offerings to them, he does this (in discharge of his debt) to them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:3">1:7:2:3</a></font></span>3. And further, inasmuch as he is bound to study (the Veda), for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to the <i>Ri</i>shis: hence it is to them that he does this; for one who has studied (the Veda) they call 'the <i>Ri</i>shis' treasure-warden.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:4">1:7:2:4</a></font></span>4. And further, inasmuch as he is bound to wish for offspring, for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to the fathers: hence when there is (provided by him) a continued, uninterrupted lineage, it is for them that he does this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:5">1:7:2:5</a></font></span>5. And further, inasmuch as he is bound to practise hospitality, for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to men: hence when he harbours them, when he offers food to them, it is (in discharge of his debt) to them that he does so. Whoever does all these things, has discharged his duties: by him all is obtained, all is conquered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:6">1:7:2:6</a></font></span>6. And, accordingly, in that he is born as (owing) a debt to the gods, in regard to that he satisfies (ava-day) them by sacrificing; and when he makes offerings in the fire, he thereby satisfies them in regard to that (debt): hence whatever they offer up in the fire, is called avadânam (sacrificial portion) <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_438"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:7">1:7:2:7</a></font></span>7. Now this (oblation) consists of four cuttings; (the reason for this is, that) there is here first, the invitatory prayer (anuvâkyâ), then the offering-prayer (yâ<i>g</i>yâ), then the vasha<i>t</i>-call, and as the fourth, the deity for which the sacrificial food is</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (destined): for in this way the deities are dependent on the sacrificial portions, or the portions are dependent on the deities: hence what fifth cutting there is (made by some), that is redundant, for--for whom is he to cut it? For this reason it consists of four cuttings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:8">1:7:2:8</a></font></span>8. But a fivefold cutting also takes place (with some people): fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, and five seasons there are in the year,--such is the perfection of the fivefold cutting; and he, assuredly, will have abundant offspring and cattle for whom, knowing this, the fivefold cutting is made. The fourfold cutting, however, is the approved (practice) among the Kuru-Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âlas, and for this reason a fourfold cutting takes place (with us <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_439"><font size="1">1</font></a>).</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:9">1:7:2:9</a></font></span>9. Let him cut off only a moderate quantity; for were he to cut off a large quantity, he would make it human; and what is human is inauspicious at the sacrifice. Let him therefore cut off only a moderate quantity, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:10">1:7:2:10</a></font></span>10. Having made an under-layer of butter (in the <i>g</i>uhû-spoon) and cut off twice from the havis, he then pours over it some butter. There are, indeed, two (kinds of) oblations; the oblation of Soma being one, and the oblation of (or rather, with) butter being the other. Now the one, viz. the Soma-oblation, is (an oblation) by itself; and the other, viz. the butter-oblation, is the same as the offering of havis (rice, milk, &amp;c.) and the animal offering <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_440"><font size="1">1</font></a>; hence he thereby makes it (the cake) butter, and therefore butter is on both sides of it. Butter, doubtless, is palatable to the gods; hence he thereby renders it palatable to the gods: for this reason butter is on both sides of it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:11">1:7:2:11</a></font></span>11. The invitatory prayer (anuvâkyâ, f.), doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the offering-prayer (yâ<i>g</i>yâ, f.) is this (earth)--these two are females. With each of these two the vasha<i>t</i>-call (vasha<i>t</i>kâra, m.) makes up a pair <a name="fr_444"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Now the vasha<i>t</i>, indeed,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>is no other than that scorching one (the sun). When he rises he approaches yonder (sky); and when he sets he approaches this (earth): hence whatever is brought forth here by these two, that they bring forth through that male.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:12">1:7:2:12</a></font></span>12. Having recited the invitatory prayer and pronounced the offering-prayer <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he afterwards (pa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ât) utters the vasha<i>t</i> formula; for from behind (pa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ât) the male approaches the female: hence, after placing those two in front, he causes them to be approached by that male, the vasha<i>t</i>. For the same reason let him make the offering either simultaneously with the vasha<i>t</i> or (immediately) after the vasha<i>t</i> has been pronounced.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:13">1:7:2:13</a></font></span>13. A vessel of the gods, doubtless, is that vasha<i>t</i>. Even as, after ladling, one would mete out (food) into a vessel, so here. If, on the other hand, he were to make the offering before the vasha<i>t</i>, it would be lost, as would be that (food) falling to the ground: for this reason also let him make the offering either simultaneously with the vasha<i>t</i> or after it has been pronounced.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:14">1:7:2:14</a></font></span>14. As seed is poured into the womb, so here. If, on the other hand, he were to make the offering before the vasha<i>t</i>, it would be lost, as would be the seed poured not into the womb: for this reason also let him make the offering either simultaneously with the vasha<i>t</i> or after it has been pronounced.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:15">1:7:2:15</a></font></span>15. The invitatory formula, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the offering-formula is this (earth). The gâyatrî metre also is this (earth), and the trish<i>t</i>ubh</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>is yonder (sky) <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">1</font></a> He recites the gâyatrî verse, thereby reciting yonder (sky), for the invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ) is yonder (sky). He recites this (earth), for the gâyatrî verse (viz. the offering-formula) is this (earth).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:16">1:7:2:16</a></font></span>16. He then presents the offering with a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">2</font></a>, thereby presenting it by means of this</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (earth), for the offering-formula (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) is this (earth). Over yonder (sky) he places the vasha<i>t</i>, for yonder (sky) also is the trish<i>t</i>ubh. Thereby he makes those two (sky and earth) yoke-fellows; and as such they feed together; and after their common meal all these creatures get food <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:17">1:7:2:17</a></font></span>17. Let him pronounce the invitatory formula lingering, as it were: the invitatory formula, namely, is yonder (sky), and the b<i>ri</i>hat(-sâman) also is yonder (sky), since its form is that of the b<i>ri</i>hat. With the offering-formula let him, as it were, hurry on fast: the offering-formula, doubtless, is this (earth), and the rathantara(-sâman) also is this (earth), since its form is that of the rathantara <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">2</font></a>. With the invitatory formula he calls (the gods), and with the</p>

 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>offering-formula he presents (food to them): hence the invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ) has some such form as 'I call,' 'We call,' 'Come hither!' 'Sit on the barhis!' for with it he calls. With the offering-formula (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) he offers: hence the offering-formula has some such form as, 'Accept the sacrificial food!' 'Relish the sacrificial food!' 'Accept the potation (âv<i>ri</i>shâyasva)!' 'Eat! Drink! There <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' for by it he offers that which (is indicated by) 'there!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:18">1:7:2:18</a></font></span>18. Let the invitatory formula be one that has its distinctive indication (in the form of the name of the respective deity) at the beginning (in front): for the invitatory formula is yonder (sky); and that (sky) yonder has the moon, the stars, and the sun for its mark below <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:19">1:7:2:19</a></font></span>19. The offering-formula then should be one that has its characteristic indication (further) back <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">3</font></a>; for the offering-formula is this (earth), and this same (earth) has plants, trees, waters, fire, and these creatures for its mark above.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:20">1:7:2:20</a></font></span>20. Verily, that invitatory formula alone is auspicious, in the first word of which he utters the (name of the) deity; and that offering-formula alone is auspicious in the last word of which he pronounces the vasha<i>t</i> upon the deity <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for the (name</p>

 <p>of the) deity constitutes the vigour of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (verse): hence after thus enclosing it <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">1</font></a> on both sides with vigour, he offers the sacrificial food to that deity for which it is intended.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:21">1:7:2:21</a></font></span>21. He pronounces (the syllable) vauk <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for, assuredly, the vasha<i>t</i>-call is speech; and speech means seed: hence he thereby casts seed. 'Sha<i>t</i>' (he pronounces), because there are six seasons: he thereby casts that seed into the seasons, and the seasons cause that seed so cast to spring up here as creatures. This is the reason why he pronounces the vasha<i>t</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:22">1:7:2:22</a></font></span>22. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, entered upon their father Pra<i>g</i>âpati's inheritance <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">3</font></a>, to wit, these two half-moons. The gods entered upon the one which waxes, and the Asuras on the one which wanes.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:23">1:7:2:23</a></font></span>23. The gods were desirous as to how they might appropriate also the one that had fallen to the Asuras. They went on worshipping and toiling. They saw this havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, to wit, the new- and full-moon sacrifices, and performed them; and by performing them they likewise appropriated the one--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:24">1:7:2:24</a></font></span>24. Which belonged to the Asuras. Now when these two revolve, then the month is produced; and month (revolving) after month, the year (is produced). But the year, doubtless, means all; hence the gods thereby appropriated all that belonged to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Asuras, they deprived their enemies, the Asuras, of all. And in the same way he (the sacrificer) who knows this appropriates all that belongs to his enemies, deprives his enemies of all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:25">1:7:2:25</a></font></span>25. That (half-moon) which belonged to the gods is (called) yavan, for the gods possessed themselves (yu, 'to join') of it; and that which belonged to the Asuras is ayavan, because the Asuras did not possess themselves of it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:7:2:26">1:7:2:26</a></font></span>26. But they also say contrariwise:--That which belonged to the gods is (called) ayavan, because the Asuras did not get possession of it; and that which belonged to the Asuras is yavan, because the gods did get possession of it. The day is (called) sabda, the night sagarâ, the months yavya, the year sumeka <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">1</font></a>: sveka ('eminently one'), doubtless, is the same as sumeka. And since the Hot<i>ri</i> is concerned with these--to wit, the yavan and the ayavan, which (according to some) is yavan--they call (his office) yâvihotram <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_437"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_440">190:1</a> The wording of this passage is very ambiguous; so much so indeed, that it could also be taken in the sense that 'whoever exists, is born as (one to whom) a debt (is owed) from the gods,' &amp;c.; cf. I, 1, 2, 19: 'Whichever deities are chosen (for the oblations), they consider it as a debt (clue from them), that they are bound to fulfil whatever wish he entertains while taking the oblation.' But see Taitt. Br. VI, 3, 10, 5: 'Verily, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who is born, is born as owing a debt in respect to three things: in the shape of sacred study (brahma<i>k</i>arya) to the <i>Ri</i>shis, in the shape of sacrifice to the gods, and in the shape of offspring to the fathers. Free from debt, verily, is he who has a son, who is a sacrificer, who lives (for a time with a guru) as a religious student.' Ath.-veda VI, 117, 3 (Taitt. Br. III, 7, 9, 8): 'May we be debtless in this, debtless in the other, debtless in the third, world! What worlds (paths, Taitt. Br.) there are trodden by the gods and trodden by the fathers,--may we abide debtless on all (those) paths!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_438"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_441">191:1</a> The word is really derived from ava-dâ (do), 'to cut off.' The Taitt. Br. gives the same fanciful etymological explanation of the term as here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_439"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_442">192:1</a> The four 'cuttings' of which each oblation of rice-cake consists are made in the following way: first, some clarified butter, 'cut out' or drawn from the butter in the dhruvâ-spoon by means of the sruva (dipping-spoon) and poured into the <i>g</i>uhû (this is called the upastara<i>n</i>a or under-layer of butter); second and third, two pieces of the size of a thumb's joint, cut out from the centre and the fore-part of the rice-cake and laid on that butter; and fourth, some clarified butter poured on these pieces of cake (the technical name of this basting of butter being abhighâra<i>n</i>a). The family of the <i>G</i>amadagnis, which is mentioned as always making five cuttings (Kâty. I, 9, 3-4), take three pieces of cake instead of two, viz. an additional one from the back (or west) part of the cake. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ika Deva on Kâty. quotes a couplet from some Sm<i>ri</i>ti, in which the Vatsas, the Vidas, and the Ârsh<i>t</i>ishe<i>n</i>as are mentioned beside the <i>G</i>amadagnis, as pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âvattina<i>h</i> or making five cuttings. At the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>uyâ<i>g</i>a (low-voiced offering),--which is performed between the cake-oblation to Agni and that to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and between the cake-oblation to Agni and that to Indra-Agni (or the sânnâyya, or oblation of sweet and sour milk, to Indra) at the new moon, and which consists entirely of butter,--the four cuttings are effected in the same way as described <a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a> page <a href="sbe1228.htm#page_174">174</a> note. At the sânnâyya, two (or three) sruva-fuls of both the sweet and the sour milk take the place of the two (or three) pieces of cake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_440"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_443">193:1</a> See page <a href="sbe1206.htm#page_26">26</a>, note <a href="sbe1206.htm#fn_125">1</a>. The parts of the cakes or the sânnâyya, from which cuttings have been made, he bastes, each once, with butter taken with the sruva from the butter-pot; and whenever butter is ladled with the sruva from the dhruvâ into the <i>g</i>uhû, the former is replenished from the butter-pot.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_441"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_444">193:2</a> Tayor mithunam asti vasha<i>t</i>kâra eva, 'to these two the vasha<i>t</i>-call is the complement in forming a pair.' On the vasha<i>t</i> (vausha<i>t</i>) and the other two formulas, see note on I, 5, 2, 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_442"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_445">194:1</a> The usual formalities, which have been detailed before (see page <a href="sbe1228.htm#page_174">174</a> note), have, of course, to be gone through at each oblation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_443"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_446">195:1</a> In this passage the invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ or puro'nuvâkyâ), which is in the gâyatrî metre, is identified with the sky, and the offering-formula (yâ<i>g</i>yâ), which is in the trish<i>t</i>ubh metre, with the earth. On the other hand, the gâyatrî also is the earth (cf. I, 4, I, 34), and the trish<i>t</i>ubh the sky; so that, according to this mode of reasoning, there is not only an intimate connection between the two metres, but actual identity. The gâyatrî verse, used as invitatory formula, on the occasion of the rice-cake offering to Agni, is Rig-veda VIII, 4.4, 16 [agnir mûrdhâ diva<i>h</i> kakut, 'Agni, the head and summit of the sky,' &amp;c.]; with that to Agni and Soma, at the full-moon sacrifice, Rig-veda I, 93, 3 [agnîshomau savedasau, sahûtî vanatam gira<i>h</i>, 'O Agni and Soma, of self-same wealth and invocation, accept this song!' &amp;c.]; and to Indra and Agni, at the new moon, Rig-veda VII, 94, 7 [indrâgnî avasâ gatam, 'O Indra and Agni, come to us with favour I' &amp;c.] or with the (optional) milk-offering (sânnâyyam), at the new moon, Rig-veda I, 8, 1 [endra sânasi<i>m</i> rayim, hither, O Indra, bring abundant treasure!!' &amp;c.], if to Indra; or Rig-veda VIII, 6, 1 [mahâṅ indro ya o<i>g</i>asâ par<i>g</i>anyo v<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>imâṅ iva, 'the Great Indra, who in might is equal to the rainy thunder-cloud,' &amp;c.], if to Mahendra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_444"></a><a href="sbe1231.htm#fr_447">195:2</a> The trish<i>t</i>ubh verse, used as offering-formula with the oblation of cake to Agni, both at the new and full moon, is Rig-veda X, 8, 6 [bhuvo ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>asya ra<i>g</i>asa<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a netâ . . . agne . . ., 'be thou the leader of the sacrifice and welkin, . . . O Agni!' &amp;c.]; with that to Agni and Soma, at the full moon, Rig-veda I, 93, 5 [yuvam etâni divi ro<i>k</i>anâni . . . agnîshomau . . ., 'you, O Agni and Soma, (fixed) those lights in the heaven,' &amp;c.]; with that to Indra and Agni, at the new moon, Rig-veda VII, 93 4 [gîrbhir vipra<i>h</i> pramatim i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>amâna, .. indrâgnî . . ., 'the bard, seeking your grace by songs . . ., O Indra and Agni,' &amp;c.]; and with the milk-offering, at the same sacrifice, if to Indra, Rig-veda X, 180, 1 [pra sasâhishe puruhûta <i>s</i>atrûn . . . indrâ . . ., thou, O Indra, the much-invoked, hast vanquished the enemies!' &amp;c.]; or, if to Mahendra, Rig-veda X, 50, 4 [bhuvas <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a> tvam indra brahma<i>n</i>â mahân, 'mighty, O Indra, mayest thou be through (our) prayer!' &amp;c.].</p>

The rain is the food of the earth; and the food, produced thereby, in its turn furnishes food for the sky (or the gods) in the form of oblations.</p>

In these symbolical combinations the b<i>ri</i>hat and rathantara, which must never be used together, are often employed as the enclosing chants, representative of the womb. They are already mentioned in Rig-veda X, 181. See also <i>S</i>at. Br. IX, 1, 2, 36-37. Taitt. S. VII, 1, I, 4, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is said to have first created from his mouth Agni together with the Gâyatrî, the Rathantara-sâman, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and the goat; and then from his chest and arms Indra, the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman, the Râ<i>g</i>anya, and the ram.</p>

Our author identifies it with su-eka. The words sabdam (<i>s</i>abdam, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec., ? = the sounding one) and sagarâ are obscure; yavya here apparently means, 'consisting of the yavas or half-months.'</p>
