 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:1">2:3:1:1</a></font></span>1. The Agnihotra, doubtless, is the Sun. It is because he rose in front (agre) of that offering <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_740"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that the Agnihotra is the Sun.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:2">2:3:1:2</a></font></span>2. When he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, 'I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering);' and when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, 'I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering):' and for this reason, they say, the Agnihotra is the Sun.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:3">2:3:1:3</a></font></span>3. And when he sets, then he, as an embryo, enters that womb, the fire; and along with him thus becoming an embryo, all these creatures become embryos; for, being coaxed, they lie down contented <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_741"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The reason, then, why the night envelops that (sun), is that embryos also are, as it were, enveloped.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:4">2:3:1:4</a></font></span>4. Now when he offers in the evening after sunset, he offers for the good of that (sun) in the embryo state, he benefits that embryo; and since he offers for the good of that (sun) in the embryo state, therefore embryos here live without taking food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:5">2:3:1:5</a></font></span>5. And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, then he produces that (sun-child) and, having become a light, it rises shining. But, assuredly, it would not rise, were he not to make that offering: this is why he performs that offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:6">2:3:1:6</a></font></span>6. Even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so does it (the sun-child) free itself from the night, from evil: and, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, he frees himself from all evil, even as a snake frees itself from its skin; and after his birth all these creatures are born; for they are set free according to their inclination.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:7">2:3:1:7</a></font></span>7. Then, as to his taking out the Âhavanîya (from the Gârhapatya) before the setting of the sun;--the rays, doubtless, are all those gods; and what highest light there is, that, indeed, is either Pra<i>g</i>âpati or Indra. Now all the gods approach the house of him who performs the Agnihotra: but whosesoever (offering) they approach before the fire has been taken out, from that the gods turn away, and he fails in it; and after the failure of that (offering) from which the gods turn away, people say, that, whether one knows it or not, the sun went down on account of that (fire) not having been taken out.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:8">2:3:1:8</a></font></span>8. And another reason why he takes out the Âhavanîya before the setting of the sun, is this. In like manner as, when one's better comes to visit</p>  
 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p>  
 <p>one, he would honour him by trimming his house, so here: for whosesoever (offering) they approach, after the fire has been taken out, his Âhavanîya (house) they enter, in his Âhavanîya they repose.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:9">2:3:1:9</a></font></span>9. Now when he offers in the evening after the sun has set, he thereby offers to them after they have entered his fire-house; and when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he offers to them before they go away. Therefore Âsuri said, 'The Agnihotra of those who offer after sunrise we regard as useless <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">1</font></a>: it is as if one were to take food to an empty dwelling.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:10">2:3:1:10</a></font></span>10. That which affords (the means of) subsistence is of two kinds; namely, either rooted or rootless. On both of these, which belong to the gods, men subsist. Now cattle are rootless and plants are rooted. From the rootless cattle eating the rooted plants and drinking water, that juice is produced.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:11">2:3:1:11</a></font></span>11. Now when he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, 'I will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on this which belongs to them.' And when he afterwards takes his evening meal, he eats what remains of the offering, and whereof oblative portions (bali) have been distributed all round <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:12">2:3:1:12</a></font></span>12. And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, 'I will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on this which belongs to them.' And when he afterwards takes his meal in the day-time, he eats what remains of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p>offering, and whereof oblative portions have been distributed all round; for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:13">2:3:1:13</a></font></span>13. Here now they say,--All other sacrifices come to an end, but the Agnihotra does not come to an end. Although that which lasts for twelve years is indeed limited, this (Agnihotra) is nevertheless unlimited, since, when one has offered in the evening, he knows that he will offer in the morning; and when one has offered in the morning, he knows that he will again offer in the evening. Hence that Agnihotra is unlimited, and in consequence of this its unlimitedness, creatures are here born unlimited. And, verily, he who thus knows the unlimitedness of the Agnihotra, is himself born unlimited in prosperity and offspring.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:14">2:3:1:14</a></font></span>14. Having milked <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">1</font></a> he puts that (milk) on (the Gârhapatya fire), because it has to be cooked. Here now they say, 'When it rises to the brim, then we shall offer it!' He must not however let it rise to the brim, since he would burn it, if he were to let it rise to the brim; and unproductive indeed is burnt seed: he must not, therefore, let it rise to the brim.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:15">2:3:1:15</a></font></span>15. He should not offer it without having put it on the fire; for since this is Agni's seed, therefore it is hot (<i>s</i><i>ri</i>ta, 'cooked'); and by putting it on the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>fire, it is indeed heated: let him, therefore, offer (of the milk) only after he has put it on the fire.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:16">2:3:1:16</a></font></span>16. He illumines it (with a burning straw) <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">1</font></a> in order that he may know when it is done. He then pours some water to it (with the sruva), both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice. For when it rains here; then plants spring up; and in consequence of the plants being eaten and the water drunk, this juice is produced: hence it is in order to supplement the juice (that he pours water to it); and therefore, if it should happen to him to have to drink pure milk, let him have one drop of water poured into it, both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:17">2:3:1:17</a></font></span>17. Thereupon he ladles four times (milk with the sruva into the Agnihotra ladle <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">2</font></a>), for in a fourfold way was that milk supplied <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He then takes a kindling-stick (samidh), and hastes up (to the Âhavanîya, with the ladle) to make the libation on the burning (stick) <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_748"><font size="1">4</font></a>. He offers the first libation</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (pûrvâhuti) without putting down (the spoon) beside (the fire, on the grass-bunch). For, were he to put it down beside (the fire), it would be as if, in taking food to somebody, one were to put it down on one's way thither. But when (he makes the libation) without previously putting it down, it is as if, in taking food to somebody, one puts it down only after taking it to him. The second (libation he then makes) after putting it down: he thereby makes these two (libations) of various vigour. Now these two: libations are mind and speech: hence he thereby separates mind and speech from each other; and thus mind and speech, even while one and the same (samâna), are still distinct (nânâ).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:18">2:3:1:18</a></font></span>18. Twice he offers in the fire, twice he wipes (the spout of the spoon), twice he eats (of the milk), and four times he ladles <a name="fr_753"></a><a href="#fn_749"><font size="1">1</font></a>;--these are ten (acts), for</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a></p>  
 <p>of ten syllables consists the virâ<i>g</i> stanza, and the sacrifice is virâ<i>g</i> (shining): he thereby converts the sacrifice into the virâ<i>g</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:19">2:3:1:19</a></font></span>19. Now what he offers up in the fire, that he offers to the gods; and thereby the gods are (admitted to the sacrifice) <a name="fr_754"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And what he wipes off (the spoons), that he offers to the fathers and plants; and thereby the fathers and plants are (admitted). And what he eats after offering, that he offers to men; and thereby men are (admitted).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:20">2:3:1:20</a></font></span>20. Verily, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the sacrifice are forlorn; to those creatures that are not forlorn he thus offers a share at the opening of the sacrifice; and thus beasts (cattle) are made to share in it along with (men), since beasts are behind men <a name="fr_755"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:21">2:3:1:21</a></font></span>21. On this point Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said, 'It (the Agnihotra) must not be looked upon as a (havis-) sacrifice, but as a domestic sacrifice (pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a); for while in any other (havis-)sacrifice he pours into the fire all that he cuts off (from the sacrificial dish and puts) into the offering spoon,--here, after offering and stepping outside <a name="fr_756"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he sips water and licks out (the milk); and this indeed (is a characteristic) of the domestic offering.' This then is the animal</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a></p>  
 <p>characteristic <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">1</font></a> of that (Agnihotra), for the domestic offering pertains to beasts (or cattle).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:22">2:3:1:22</a></font></span>22. Now the first of these libations, doubtless, is the same as that which Pra<i>g</i>âpati offered in the beginning <a name="fr_758"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and as those (gods) thereupon continued (to sacrifice) <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">3</font></a>,--namely, Agni, that blower (Vâyu), and Sûrya,--so this second libation is offered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:23">2:3:1:23</a></font></span>23. What first libation (pûrvâhuti) is made, that is the deity of the Agnihotra <a name="fr_760"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and to that (deity) it is accordingly offered; and what second one (uttarâhuti) is made, that indeed is equivalent to the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (Agni, the maker of good offering); whence he offers it on the north part (of the fire), since that is the region of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t <a name="fr_761"></a><a href="#fn_757"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Moreover, this second libation is made in order to effect a pairing, for a couple forms a productive pair.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:24">2:3:1:24</a></font></span>24. These two libations, then, form a duad: the past and the future, the born and the to-be-born, the actual <a name="fr_762"></a><a href="#fn_758"><font size="1">6</font></a> and the hope, the to-day and the morrow,--(these are) after the manner of that duad.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:25">2:3:1:25</a></font></span>25. The past is the self, for certain is that which is past, and certain also is that which is a self. The future, on the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is that which is to be, and uncertain also is progeny.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:26">2:3:1:26</a></font></span>26. The born is the self, for certain is that which is born, and certain also is the self. The to-be-born,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a></p>  
 <p>on the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is what is to be born, and uncertain also is progeny.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:27">2:3:1:27</a></font></span>27. The actual is the self, for certain is what is actual, and certain also is the self. And hope is progeny, for uncertain is hope, and uncertain also is progeny.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:28">2:3:1:28</a></font></span>28. The to-day is the self, for certain is what is to-day, and certain also is the self. The morrow is progeny, for uncertain is the morrow, and uncertain also is progeny.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:29">2:3:1:29</a></font></span>29. Now that first libation is offered on account of the self: he offers it with a sacred text, for certain is the sacred text, and certain also is the self. And that second one is offered on account of progeny: he offers it silently, for uncertain is what (is done) silently, and uncertain also is progeny.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:30">2:3:1:30</a></font></span>30. [In the evening] he offers (the first libation), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. III, 9, 10), 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' and in the morning with, 'Sûrya (the sun) is the light, the light is Sûrya, Svâhâ!' Thus offering is made with the truth; for, truly, when the sun goes down, then Agni (fire) is the light, and when the sun rises, then Sûrya is the light; and whatever is offered with the truth, that, indeed, goes to the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:31">2:3:1:31</a></font></span>31. Here now Takshan recited for Âru<i>n</i>i <a name="fr_763"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who wished to obtain holy lustre (brahmavar<i>k</i>asa, inspired nature), 'Agni is lustre, light is lustre;'--'Sûrya is lustre, light is lustre.' Holy lustre, therefore, he obtains whosoever, knowing this, thus offers the Agnihotra.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 336</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:32">2:3:1:32</a></font></span>32. That (other text), however, has the characteristic form of generation. In saying, 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' he encloses that seed, the light, on both sides with the deity; and the seed, thus enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus enclosing it on both sides he causes it to be brought forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:33">2:3:1:33</a></font></span>33. And when, in the morning, he says, 'Sûrya is the light, the light is Sûrya, Svâhâ!' he encloses that seed, the light, on both sides with the deity, and the seed, thus enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus enclosing it on both sides he causes it to be brought forth; and this, indeed, is the characteristic form of generation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:34">2:3:1:34</a></font></span>34. But <i>G</i>îvala <i>K</i>ailaki said <a name="fr_764"></a><a href="#fn_760"><font size="1">1</font></a>, 'Âru<i>n</i>i merely causes conception to take place, not birth: let him therefore offer with that (text, in par. 32) in the evening.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:35">2:3:1:35</a></font></span>35. Then, in the morning, by the text, "The light is Sûrya, Sûrya is the light," he places that seed, the light, outside by means of the deity; and the seed thus brought outside he causes to be born.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:36">2:3:1:36</a></font></span>36. They also say, 'In the evening he offers Sûrya in Agni, and in the morning he offers Agni in Sûrya <a name="fr_765"></a><a href="#fn_761"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' Such, indeed, is the case with those who offer after sunrise; for when the sun sets then Agni is the light, and when the sun rises then Sûrya is the light. Here no offence is committed on his (the sacrificer's) part; but an offence is indeed committed where offering is not made distinctly to that deity (viz. Agni or Sûrya resp.), which is the deity of the Agnihotra.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:37">2:3:1:37</a></font></span>37. He may also offer (in the evening) with this text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. III, 10), 'Along with the divine Savit<i>ri</i>--,' whereby it (the sacrifice) becomes possessed of Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion; '--along with the Night, wedded to Indra--,' whereby he effects a union with the night, and makes it (the sacrifice) possessed of Indra, for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; '--may Agni graciously accept!

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:3:1:38">2:3:1:38</a></font></span>38. And in the morning with, 'Along with the divine Savit<i>ri</i>--,' whereby it becomes possessed of Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion; '--along with the Dawn, wedded to Indra,' or 'along with the Day . . . .--,' whereby he effects a union either with the day or the dawn <a name="fr_767"></a><a href="#fn_763"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and makes it (the sacrifice) possessed of Indra; for Indra is the deity of sacrifice; '--may Sûrya graciously accept!

IV, 14, 1 he has the Agnihotra cow--standing south of the sacrificial ground and facing the east or north--milked by anybody except a Sûdra. The vessel to be used is of earthenware, and must have been made by an Ârya. The Adhvaryu then takes the vessel, and having entered the Âhavanîya house by the east door and passed over to the Gârhapatya, puts it there on coals previously shifted northwards from the fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_745"></a><a href="sbe1248.htm#fr_749">331:1</a> According to Kâty. IV, 14, 5 the Adhvaryu illumines the milk with a burning straw; pours some water to it with the sruva or dipping-spoon; then illumines it once more; and lifts up the pot three several times, putting it down each time further north of the fire. Thereupon he warms the two spoons; and wipes them with his hand; and having warmed them once more, he says to the sacrificer, 'I ladle!' The latter, while standing, replies, 'Om, ladle!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_746"></a><a href="sbe1248.htm#fr_750">331:2</a> For the Agnihotra-hava<i>n</i>î, or offering-spoon (sru<i>k</i>), used at the morning and evening libation, and made of Vikankata wood (Flacourtia Sapida), see <a href="sbe1211.htm#page_67">p. 67</a>, note <a href="sbe1212.htm#fn_207">2</a>. In the case of those who make five cuttings from the havis (pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âvattin, cf. <a href="sbe1231.htm#page_192">p. 192</a> note) he takes five sruva-fuls. Kâty. IV, 14, 10, Comm.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_748"></a><a href="sbe1248.htm#fr_752">331:4</a> While holding a billet or kindling-stick (samidh) over the (handle of) the milk-ladle, he [first holds the latter close over the Gârhapatya fire, and thereupon] takes it to the Âhavanîya, keeping <a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a> it on a level with his mouth, except in the middle between the two fires, where he lowers it for a moment to the level of his navel. He then crouches down [bending his right knee, and looking eastwards, by the north-west corner of the Âhavanîya], puts the billet on [the centre of] the fire, and makes the first libation (pûrvâhuti) on the burning stick (see the formula, par. 30. The sacrificer, as usual, pronounces the dedicatory formula, viz. 'This to Agni!' and, 'This to Sûrya!' respectively). Thereupon he lays down the ladle on the kûr<i>k</i>a [a grass-bunch, placed behind the Âhavanîya fire-place, to serve as a seat, and to wipe the hands on; according to others, a flat piece of Vara<i>n</i>a wood], then takes it up again and silently makes the second libation (uttarâhuti) on the north part of the fire. Kâty. IV, 14, 12-17 with Schol.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_749"></a><a href="sbe1248.htm#fr_753">332:1</a> He ladles four sruva-fuls of milk into the Agnihotra ladle, and makes in the Âhavanîya fire two libations from this milk (so as to leave the larger quantity in the ladle to be eaten). He then wipes twice the spout of the ladle. [In each of the two other fires he thereupon makes likewise two libations with the sruva, of one spoonful each.] The milk left in the ladle he eats, on the completion of the six libations, by twice taking it out with his ring-finger.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_751"></a><a href="sbe1248.htm#fr_755">333:2</a> Instead of this paragraph, the Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads: 'Behind men are beasts; behind the gods are birds, plants, trees, and whatever else exists here. Thus he makes these creatures share in the sacrifice, those that are not forlorn here.' Compare I, 5, 2, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_752"></a><a href="sbe1248.htm#fr_756">333:3</a> Uts<i>ri</i>pya is variously explained by the commentators here and on Kâty. IV, 14, 27, as 'having gone out,' or 'having slowly moved forward,' or 'having risen,' or 'having poured out (the milk).'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_762"></a><a href="sbe1248.htm#fr_766">337:1</a> Here the Kâ<i>n</i>va text begins a new paragraph. The author's object seems to be to show that those who offer the Agnihotra after sunrise, commit a mistake in not offering to Sûrya unmistakably; for while before sunrise, Sûrya is still reposing in Agni, and the oblation, in being poured into the fire, is consequently made to Sûrya directly, those offering after sunrise should rather use the formula 'To Sûrya Svâhâ!' Cf. paragraph 9.</p>

IV, 14, II, the milk which is left in the pot may be drunk by a Brâhman, but by no one else; not even in his own house is a Kshatriya or Vai<i>s</i>ya allowed to drink it.</p>
