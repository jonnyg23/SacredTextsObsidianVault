THE PI<i>N</i><i>D</i>APIT<i>RI</i>YA<i>G</i><i>Ñ</i>A <font size="-1">OR</font> OBLATION OF OBSEQUIAL CAKES TO THE FATHERS.</h4>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:1">2:4:2:1</a></font></span>1. Now the living beings once approached Pra<i>g</i>âpati--beings doubtless mean creatures--and said, 'Ordain unto us in what manner we are to live!' Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial cord <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">1</font></a> and bending the right knee, approached him. To them he said, 'The sacrifice (shall be) your food; immortality your sap; and the sun your light!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:2">2:4:2:2</a></font></span>2. Then the fathers approached, wearing the cord on the right shoulder, and bending the left knee. To them he said, 'Your eating (shall be) monthly; your cordial (svadhâ) your swiftness of thought; and the moon your light!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:3">2:4:2:3</a></font></span>3. Then the men approached him, clothed and bending their bodies. To them he said, 'Your eating (shall be) in the evening and in the morning; your offspring your death; and the fire (Agni) your light!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:4">2:4:2:4</a></font></span>4. Then the beasts approached him. To them he granted their own choice, saying, 'Whensoever ye shall find anything, whether in season or out of season,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a></p>  
 <p>ye shall eat it!' Hence whenever they find anything, whether in season or out of season, they eat it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:5">2:4:2:5</a></font></span>5. Thereupon--so they say--the Asuras also straightway <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">1</font></a> approached him. To them he gave darkness (tamas) and illusion (mâyâ): for there is indeed what is called the illusion of the Asuras. Those creatures, it is true, have perished; but creatures still subsist here in the very manner which Pra<i>g</i>âpati ordained unto them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:6">2:4:2:6</a></font></span>6. Neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor beasts transgress (this ordinance); some of the men alone transgress it. Hence whatever man grows fat; he grows fat in unrighteousness, since he totters and is unable to walk because of his having grown fat by doing wrong. One should therefore eat only in the evening and morning; and whosoever, knowing this, eats only in the evening and morning, reaches the full measure of life; and whatever he speaks, that is (true); because he observes that divine truth. For, verily, that is Brâhmanic lustre (te<i>g</i>as), when one knows to keep His (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) law.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:7">2:4:2:7</a></font></span>7. Now that (lustre) indeed belongs to him who presents (food) to the fathers once a month. When that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he presents (food) to them; for that moon doubtless is king Soma, the food of the gods. Now during that night (of new moon) it fails them, and when it fails, he presents (food to them), and thereby establishes concord (between the gods and fathers). But were he to present (food) to them when it is not failing, he would indeed cause a quarrel between the gods and fathers: hence he presents</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (food) to them when that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:8">2:4:2:8</a></font></span>8. He presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon, doubtless, belongs to the gods; the mid-day to men; and the afternoon to the fathers: therefore he presents (food to the fathers) in the afternoon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:9">2:4:2:9</a></font></span>9. While seated behind the Gârhapatya, with his face turned toward the south <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the sacrificial cord on his right shoulder, he takes that (material for the offering from the cart) <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Thereupon he rises from thence and threshes (the rice) while standing north of the Dakshi<i>n</i>a fire and facing the south. Only once he cleans (the rice) <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">3</font></a>; for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away, and therefore he cleans it only once.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:10">2:4:2:10</a></font></span>10. He then boils it. While it stands on the (Dakshi<i>n</i>a) fire, he pours some clarified butter on it;--for the gods they pour the offering into the fire; for men they take (the food) off the fire; and for the fathers they do in this very manner: hence, they pour the ghee on it while it stands on the fire.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:11">2:4:2:11</a></font></span>11. After removing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two libations in the fire. For, in establishing his sacrificial fires, and in performing the new and full-moon sacrifice, that (householder) resorts to the gods. Here, however, he is engaged in a</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 364</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacrifice to the fathers: hence he thereby propitiates the gods, and being permitted by the gods, he presents that (food) to the fathers. This is why, on removing (the rice), he offers to the gods two libations in the fire.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:12">2:4:2:12</a></font></span>12. He offers both to Agni and Soma <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">1</font></a>. To Agni he offers, because Agni is allowed a share in every (offering); and to Soma he offers, because Soma is sacred to the fathers. This is why he offers both to Agni and Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:13">2:4:2:13</a></font></span>13. He offers <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">2</font></a> with the formulas (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 29 a, b), 'To Agni, the bearer of what is meet for the wise, svâhâ!' 'To Soma, accompanied by the fathers, svâhâ <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">3</font></a>!' He then puts the pot-ladle on the fire,--that being in lieu of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Thereupon he draws (with the wooden sword) one line (furrow) south of the Dakshi<i>n</i>a fire <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">5</font></a>,--that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a></p>  
 <p>being in lieu of the altar: only one line he draws, because the fathers have passed away once for all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:14">2:4:2:14</a></font></span>14. He then lays down a firebrand at the farther (south) end (of the line). For were he to present that (food) to the fathers, without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Rakshas would certainly tamper with it. And thus the Asuras and Rakshas do not tamper with that (food) of the fathers: this is why he lays down the firebrand at the farther end (of the line).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:15">2:4:2:15</a></font></span>15. He lays it down, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 30), 'Whatsoever Asuras roam about at will <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">1</font></a>, assuming various shapes <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--be they large-bodied or small-bodied <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">3</font></a>,--may Agni expel them from this world!' Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas, and therefore he lays (the firebrand) down in this way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:16">2:4:2:16</a></font></span>16. He then takes the water-pitcher and makes (the fathers) wash (their hands ) <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">4</font></a>, merely <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">5</font></a> saying, 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:17">2:4:2:17</a></font></span>17. Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one stroke, and cut off near the root;--the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men, and the root-part to the fathers: therefore they are cut off near the root. And with one stroke they are severed, because the fathers have passed away once for all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:18">2:4:2:18</a></font></span>18. He spreads them (along the line) with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents [to the fathers the three (round) cakes of rice] <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He presents them thus <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--for to the gods they offer thus; for men they ladle out (the food in any way they please) <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way: therefore he presents (the cakes to them) thus.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:19">2:4:2:19</a></font></span>19. With, 'N.N., this for thee!' he presents (one cake) to the sacrificer's father. Some add, 'and for those who come after thee!' but let him not say this, since he himself is one of those to whom (it would be offered) in common <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">4</font></a>: let him</p>

 <p>therefore merely say, 'N.N., this for thee!' as to the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., this for thee!' as to his grandfather; and 'N.N., this for thee!' as to his great-grandfather. He presents (the food) in an order (directed) away from the present time, because it is away from hence that the fathers have once for all departed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:20">2:4:2:20</a></font></span>20. He then mutters (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 31 a), 'Here, O fathers, regale yourselves: like bulls come hither, each to his own share!' whereby he says, 'Eat ye each his own share!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:21">2:4:2:21</a></font></span>21. He then turns round (to the left), so as to face the opposite (north) side: for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers). 'Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until his breath fail,' say some, 'for thus far extends the vital energy.' However <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">1</font></a>, having remained so for a moment--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:22">2:4:2:22</a></font></span>22. He again turns round (to the right) and mutters (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 31 b), 'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they have come each to his own share;' whereby he means to say, 'They have eaten each his own share <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:23">2:4:2:23</a></font></span>23. Thereupon he takes the water-pitcher and makes them wash themselves <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">3</font></a>, merely saying,</p>

(naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest) when he has taken his meal, so here.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:2:24">2:4:2:24</a></font></span>24. He then pulls down the tuck <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">2</font></a> (of the sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance. The tuck is sacred to the fathers (pit<i>ri</i>devatyâ): therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck. Now obeisance means worship (or sacrifice): hence he thereby renders them worthy of worship. Six times he performs obeisance; for there are six seasons, and the fathers are the seasons: for this reason he performs obeisance six times. He mutters (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 32 g), 'Give us houses, O fathers!' for the fathers are the guardians (î<i>s</i>ate) of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacrificial performance. After the cakes have been put back (in the dish containing the remains of boiled rice) he (the sacrificer) smells at (the rice); this (smelling) being the sacrificer's share. The</p>

According to Mahâdeva, he (who presents the pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as, viz. either the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer) has previously to put on a garment with a tuck (nîvimat paridhânam), i.e. with the da<i>s</i>â, or unwoven edge of the upper garment, tucked up under the waistband. This he is to pull out. Kâtyâyana has the following rules: IV, I, 15, Having made (them) wash themselves as before, and having loosened (visra<i>m</i>sya) the tuck, he makes obeisance with 'adoration to your vigour, O fathers!' &amp;c. (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 32 a-f). [According to the Comm., he adds the formula, 'Give us houses, O fathers! we will give to you of what is (ours).' Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 32, 9.] 16, With 'Put on this your garment, O fathers!' (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 32 h), he throws three threads (pieces of <a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 369</font></a> yarn), one on each cake. 17, Or, woollen fringe [or, wool or fringe (da<i>s</i>â), according to others]. 18, Or, hairs of the sacrificer (pulled out from the chest near the heart), if he is advanced in years. 19, He pours [the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes] with 'Ye (O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal ghee and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!' (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 34.) 20, [The Adhvaryu] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer smells at them. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he throws) into the fire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the middle cake with, 'Bestow offspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with lotuses; that there may he a man here!' (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 33.) [According to the comment, the other two cakes are thrown into the water or fire; or eaten by a priest.] For other variations, see Donner, Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>apit<i>ri</i>ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a. The Kâ<i>n</i>va recension, on the whole, agrees with our text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_820"></a><a href="sbe1253.htm#fr_824">369:1</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has as follows: 'Therefore he says, Give us houses, O fathers!' He then smells at the pot (ukhâ): that is the sacrificer's share. They again put down the cakes together (with the rice in the pot! samavadadhati). The once-severed (stalks of grass) they put on the fire. The firebrand he again shifts to (the fire; apy-ar<i>g</i>ati).</p>
