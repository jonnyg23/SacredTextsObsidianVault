 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4">2:5:4</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:1">2:5:4:1</a></font></span>1. Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew V<i>ri</i>tra <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">3</font></a>; by means of it they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he (the Sacrificer) thereby now slay his wicked, spiteful enemy, and gain the victory: this is why he performs this sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:2">2:5:4:2</a></font></span>2. The mode of its performance (is as follows): They raise an uttara-vedi <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">4</font></a>; they use clotted butter <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and they churn the fire. There are nine</p>

 <p>fore-offerings and nine after-offerings <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and three Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us. In the first place there are those five oblations <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:3">2:5:4:3</a></font></span>3. Now as to why there is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni. With Agni, (shaped into) a sharp point (te<i>g</i>as) <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">3</font></a>, indeed, they (the gods) slew him (V<i>ri</i>tra); and Agni, that sharp point, swerved not: hence there is (a cake) for Agni.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:4">2:5:4:4</a></font></span>4. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Soma. With the aid of Soma, the king, indeed they slew him, they who have Soma for their king: hence there is a pap for Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:5">2:5:4:5</a></font></span>5. Then as to why there is a cake on twelve, or eight <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">4</font></a>, potsherds for Savit<i>ri</i>. Savit<i>ri</i>, indeed, is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods; and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> they slew him: hence there is (a cake) for Savit<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:6">2:5:4:6</a></font></span>6. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Sarasvatî. Sarasvatî in truth is Speech; and Speech indeed it was that cheered them up, saying, 'Strike! slay <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">5</font></a>!' Hence there is a pap for Sarasvatî.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:7">2:5:4:7</a></font></span>7. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Pûshan. Pûshan doubtless is this earth <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and this</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 419</font></a></p>  
 <p>earth, indeed, gave him (V<i>ri</i>tra) up to slaughter; and they slew him, thus given up by her: hence there is a rice-pap for Pûshan.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:8">2:5:4:8</a></font></span>8. Then follows a cake on twelve, potsherds for Indra and Agni; for by means of that they slew him, since Agni means fiery glow (te<i>g</i>as), and Indra means manly power, and by means of these two powers they did indeed slay him. Moreover, Agni is the priesthood, and Indra is the nobility; having allied these two, having closely united the priesthood with the nobility, they (the gods) slew him by means of these two powers: hence there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:9">2:5:4:9</a></font></span>9. Then follows a rice-part for Mahendra. For before the slaying of V<i>ri</i>tra he was indeed Indra; but after slaying V<i>ri</i>tra he became Mahendra (the great Indra), even as (a king becomes) a mahârâ<i>g</i>a, after obtaining the victory: hence there is a rice-pap for Mahendra. And thereby indeed he renders him great (strong), for the slaying of V<i>ri</i>tra: for this reason also there is a rice-pap for Mahendra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:10">2:5:4:10</a></font></span>10. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Vi<i>s</i>vakarman. To the gods, indeed, on performing the Sâkamedha-sacrifice and obtaining the victory (over V<i>ri</i>tra), that sacred work (karman) was made complete (vi<i>s</i>va), and all was conquered; and so is that sacred work made complete, and all is conquered, by him who has performed the Sâkamedha-sacrifice and obtained the victory: hence there is a cake on one potsherd for Vi<i>s</i>vakarman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:5:4:11">2:5:4:11</a></font></span>11. And, verily, by performing this sacrifice the gods became what race, what prosperity of the gods there now is; and that same race he propagates,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_420"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 420</font></a></p>  
 <p>that same prosperity he attains, whosoever, knowing this, performs this sacrifice. Let him therefore perform this sacrifice.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_937"></a><a href="sbe1259.htm#fr_941">418:6</a> This identification of Pûshan with the earth is very strange, the more so as, at II, 5, 1, 11, special stress is laid on the male nature of Pûshan. Perhaps it is in his character of bountiful bestower of food and cattle, or as the tutelary god of travellers, that he is so identified.</p>
