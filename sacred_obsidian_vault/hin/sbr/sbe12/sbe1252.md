 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:1">2:4:1:1</a></font></span>1. Now after the performance of the Agnihotra he (optionally <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">2</font></a>) .approaches the fires with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. III, 37), 'Earth! ether! sky!' In saying 'Earth! ether! sky!' he renders his speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that (speech) thus rendered propitious he invokes a blessing:--'May I be well supplied with offspring!' whereby he prays for offspring; '--well supplied with men!' whereby he prays for men (heroes); '--well supplied with viands!' whereby he prays for prosperity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:2">2:4:1:2</a></font></span>2. That long (form of) fire-worship is a prayer for blessing, and so is this (short) one a prayer for blessing: hence even with this much he obtains all, and he may therefore worship the fires with it. 'Therewith, indeed, we perform,' so spake Âsuri.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:3">2:4:1:3</a></font></span>3. Now, when he is about to set out on a journey <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he approaches first the Gârhapatya, and thereupon the Âhavanîya.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:4">2:4:1:4</a></font></span>4. The Gârhapatya he approaches with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. III, 37 b seq.), 'Thou, that art friendly to man, protect my offspring!' He (Agni Gârhapatya), truly, is the guardian of offspring; and therefore he now makes over to him his offspring for protection.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:5">2:4:1:5</a></font></span>5. He then approaches the Âhavanîya, with 'Thou, that art worthy of praise, protect my cattle!' He (Agni), truly, is the guardian of cattle, and therefore he now makes over to him his cattle for protection <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:6">2:4:1:6</a></font></span>6. Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers to be the boundary <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_791"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he breaks silence. And when he returns from his journey he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him (or any other person before one has rendered homage to the fires).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:7">2:4:1:7</a></font></span>7. He first approaches the Âhavanîya fire, and thereupon the Gârhapatya. The Gârhapatya doubtless is a house (g<i>ri</i>hâ<i>h</i>), and a house is a safe resting-place: so that he thereby (finally <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">3</font></a>) establishes himself in a house, that is, in a safe resting-place.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:8">2:4:1:8</a></font></span>8. He approaches the Âhavanîya fire, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. III, 38 seq.), 'We have approached (thee), the all-knowing, the most liberal dispenser of</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 359</font></a></p>  
 <p>goods: O Agni, sovereign lord, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down he sweeps the blades of grass <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">1</font></a> (into the fire).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:9">2:4:1:9</a></font></span>9. Thereupon he approaches the Gârhapatya, with the text, 'He, Agni Gârhapatya, is the lord of the house, the most liberal dispenser of goods to our offspring: O Agni, lord of the house, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down, he sweeps off the blades of grass. In this way (householders) mostly approach the fires with muttered prayer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:10">2:4:1:10</a></font></span>10. However, one may also approach the fires silently,--and that for this reason:--If in the place (where one lives), a Brâhman or noble--in short, a better man--resides, one dares not say to him, 'I am going on a journey, take care of this (property) of mine <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' Now in this (sacrificial ground) one's betters indeed reside, viz. the divine Agnis: who, then, would dare to say to them, 'I am going on a journey, take ye care of this (property) of mine!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:11">2:4:1:11</a></font></span>11. The gods assuredly see through the mind of man: that (Agni) Gârhapatya therefore knows that he (the householder) now approaches in order to give</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a></p>  
 <p>himself up to him. Silently he approaches the Âhavanîya fire: that (Agni) Âhavanîya knows that he now approaches in order to give himself up to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:12">2:4:1:12</a></font></span>12. Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers the boundary line, he releases his speech. And when he returns from the journey, he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:13">2:4:1:13</a></font></span>13. He first approaches the Âhavanîya, and thereupon the Gârhapatya. Silently he approaches the Âhavanîya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades. Silently he approaches the Gârhapatya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2:4:1:14">2:4:1:14</a></font></span>14. Then as to the observances in regard to (the entering of) his house. Now when a householder comes home from a journey, his house trembles greatly for fear of him, thinking, 'What will he say here? what will he do here?' It is therefore for fear of him that speaks or does anything on this occasion that the house trembles and is liable to crush his family; but him who neither speaks nor does anything, his house receives with confidence, thinking, 'He has not spoken here, he has not done anything here!' And should he be ever so angry at anything on this occasion, let him rather do on the next day whatever he might wish to say or do. This then is the observance in regard to the house <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_790"></a><a href="sbe1252.htm#fr_794">358:1</a> The Vâ<i>g</i>. S. gives also the formulas with which the Dakshi<i>n</i>âgni should be approached, after the other two fires, by the householder, both in starting on, and returning from, his journey. See Kâty. IV, 12, 13; 18. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text does not allude to the Dakshi<i>n</i>a fire any more than ours.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_791"></a><a href="sbe1252.htm#fr_795">358:2</a> According to the Paddhati on Katy. IV, 12, he has to maintain silence as long as he can see the roof of one of his fire-houses; but according to the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana <i>s</i>âkhâ he has to do so only as long as he can see one of the fires.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_792"></a><a href="sbe1252.htm#fr_796">358:3</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads 'antata<i>h</i>.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_793"></a><a href="sbe1252.htm#fr_797">359:1</a> According to Kâty. IV, 12, 18-19 he [after performing ablutions, and lustrating the Âhavanîya and Dakshi<i>n</i>a fire-places, and taking out these fires from the Gârhapatya] approaches the Âhavanîya, while holding pieces of fire-wood in his hand, and mutters the formula given above. He then sits down and silently puts on the fire a piece of wood and the grass that has fallen around the fire. According to the Kâ<i>n</i>va text he mutters the second half of the formula ('O Agni,' &amp;c.) while sweeping the grass (into the fire).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_794"></a><a href="sbe1252.htm#fr_798">359:2</a> In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 10, 6, a householder who is about to start on a journey is apparently recommended to entrust his house to a Brâhman, who may be staying in it.</p>

III, 41-43, lines 1 and 2, wherewith he approaches (upatish<i>th</i>ate) the house. See Katy. IV, 12, 22. According to Katy. ib. 23, he then enters <a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 361</font></a> the house with the formula Vâ<i>g</i>. S. III, 43, line 3, 'For safety, for peace I resort to thee: be there kindliness, happiness, all-hail, and blessing!' Thereupon, according to the Schol., he is to proceed in accordance with the rules laid down in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras; cf. Pârask. G. I, 18; Â<i>s</i>v. G. I, 15, 9.</p>
