When he (the Adhvaryu) is about to make the second libation with the offering-spoon (sru<i>k</i>), he (twice) lays his joined hands (a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ali) on the ground before the two offering-spoons (<i>g</i>uhû and upabh<i>ri</i>t), with the formulas (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 7 b), 'Adoration to the gods!' 'Svadhâ to the fathers!' Thereby he propitiates the gods and the fathers, now that</p>

 <p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 128</font></a></p>  
 <p>he is about to perform the duties of the sacrificial priest. With the formula, 'May ye two be easy to manage for me!' he takes the two offering-spoons: he thereby means to say, 'May ye two be easy to handle for me; may I be able to handle you!'--He further says (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II. 8), 'May I this day offer up the butter to the gods unspilt!' whereby he means to say, 'May I to-day perform an undisturbed sacrifice to the gods!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:2">1:4:5:2</a></font></span>2. And again, 'May I not sin against thee with my foot, O Vish<i>n</i>u!' Vish<i>n</i>u, indeed, is the sacrifice: it is the latter therefore that he propitiates by saying, 'may I not sin against thee!' Further, 'May I step into thy wealth-abounding shade, O Agni!' whereby he says, 'may I step into thy auspicious shade, O Agni <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">1</font></a>!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:3">1:4:5:3</a></font></span>3. Further, 'Thou art the abode of Vish<i>n</i>u!' Vish<i>n</i>u, indeed, is the sacrifice, and near to this he now stands: this is why he says, 'thou art the abode of Vish<i>n</i>u!'--'Here Indra performed his heroic deed <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">2</font></a>;' for it was while standing in this place that Indra drove off towards the south the evil spirits, the Rakshas: for this reason he says, 'here Indra performed his heroic deed.'--'Erect stood the cult;' cult,</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a></p>  
 <p>namely, means sacrifice, hence he thereby says 'erect stood the sacrifice.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:4">1:4:5:4</a></font></span>4. Further (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 9): 'O Agni, take thou upon thyself the office of Hot<i>ri</i>, take thou upon thyself the part of messenger!' for Agni is both Hot<i>ri</i> and messenger to the gods: hence he thereby says, 'know thou <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">1</font></a> both (offices) which thou art (holding) for the gods!'--'May earth and heaven guard thee! Guard thou earth and heaven!' there is nothing obscure in this.--'Indra, by this butter-oblation, may be the maker of good offering (svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t) for the gods! Svâhâ!' Indra, indeed, is the deity of sacrifice; therefore he says 'Indra, by this butter-oblation . . . 'It is for speech that he makes this sprinkling, and Indra is speech' so say some; and for this reason also he says Indra, by this butter-oblation. . .'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:5">1:4:5:5</a></font></span>5. Having then returned (to his former position behind the altar), without letting the two offering-spoons touch each other, he mixes (some of the butter left in the <i>g</i>uhû) with (that in) the dhruvâ. Now the second libation (which he has just offered) is the head of the sacrifice, and the dhruvâ is its body <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">2</font></a>: hence he thereby replaces the head on the body. And the second libation, moreover, is the head of the sacrifice, and the head (<i>s</i>iras) represents excellence (<i>s</i>rî), for the head does indeed represent excellence: hence, of one who is the most excellent (<i>s</i>resh<i>th</i>a) of a community, people say that he is 'the head of that community.'</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:6">1:4:5:6</a></font></span>6. The sacrificer, assuredly, stands behind the dhruvâ, and he who means evil to him stands behind the upabh<i>ri</i>t <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Hence if he were to mix (the butter remaining in the <i>g</i>uhû) with (that in) the upabh<i>ri</i>t, he would bestow excellence on him who means evil to the sacrificer; but in this, way he bestows that excellence on the sacrificer himself: for this reason he mixes (the butter in the gull with (that in) the dhruvâ.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:7">1:4:5:7</a></font></span>7. He mixes it, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 9 h), 'Light with light!' for light (lustre), indeed, is the butter in the one (spoon) and light also is that in the other. Thereby these two lights unite with each other, and for this reason he mixes (the butter) in this manner.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:8">1:4:5:8</a></font></span>8. Now a dispute once took place between Mind and Speech as to <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">2</font></a> which was the better of the two. Both Mind and Speech said, 'I am excellent!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:9">1:4:5:9</a></font></span>9. Mind said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for thou dost not speak anything that is not understood by me; and since thou art only an imitator of what is done by me and a follower in my wake, I am surely better than thou!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:10">1:4:5:10</a></font></span>10. Speech said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for what thou knowest I make known, I communicate.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:11">1:4:5:11</a></font></span>11. They went to appeal to Pra<i>g</i>âpati for his decision. He, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, decided in favour of Mind, saying (to Speech), 'Mind is indeed better than thou, for thou art an imitator of its deeds and a follower in its wake; and inferior, surely, is he who imitates his better's deeds and follows in his wake.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:12">1:4:5:12</a></font></span>12. Then Speech (vâ<i>k</i>, fem.) being thus gainsaid, was dismayed and miscarried. She, Speech, then said to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, 'May I never be thy oblation-bearer, I whom thou hast gainsaid!' Hence whatever at the sacrifice is performed for Pra<i>g</i>âpati, that is performed in a low voice; for speech would not act as oblation-bearer for Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:5:13">1:4:5:13</a></font></span>13. That germ (retas) the gods then brought away in a skin or in some (vessel). They asked: 'Is it here (atra)?' and therefore it developed into Atri. For the same reason one becomes guilty by (intercourse) with a woman who has just miscarried (âtreyî); for it is from that woman, from the goddess Speech, that these (germs) originate <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_322"></a><a href="sbe1221.htm#fr_324">128:1</a> While he pronounces this formula (and while the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the formula of invitation to the gods, cf. note on I, 4, 2, 26) the Adhvaryu steps to the south side of the altar (and Âhavanîya fire) and in so doing must take care always to keep the left foot before the right (Kâty. III. 1, 16, 18) and not to touch the top of the prastara, ib. 17, schol. In returning (par. 5) to his former position he has to keep the right foot before the left.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_323"></a><a href="sbe1221.htm#fr_325">128:2</a> With this and the succeeding formulas, the Adhvaryu makes the second libation (cf. note on I, 4, 4, 1). Before the butter is poured into the fire the sacrificer pronounces the dedicatory formula, 'Om! for Indra this, not for me!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_324"></a><a href="sbe1221.htm#fr_326">129:1</a> Ve<i>h</i>, in the formula, our author refers to vid, 'to know,' instead of to vî, 'to strive after, undertake.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_326"></a><a href="sbe1221.htm#fr_328">130:1</a> The same idea has been expressed above, I, 3, 2, 11.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_327"></a><a href="sbe1221.htm#fr_329">130:2</a> Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 11, 4: 'Mind and Speech (or Voice) were contending against one another.' 'I will carry the oblation to the gods!' said Speech. 'I (will carry it) to the gods!' said the Mind. They went to Pra<i>g</i>âpati to question him. Pra<i>g</i>âpati said (to Speech), 'Thou art the handmaid (dûtî) of the mind, for what one thinks in one's mind that one speaks with one's speech.' [Speech replied], 'Then indeed they shall not offer to thee with speech!' For this reason they offer to Pra<i>g</i>âpati with the mind; for Pra<i>g</i>âpati, as it were, is the mind, &amp;c.</p>
