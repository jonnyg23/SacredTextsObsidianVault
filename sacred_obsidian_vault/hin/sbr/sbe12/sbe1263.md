Now when it is said, that the gods, by means of the Sâkamedha -offerings, slew V<i>ri</i>tra and gained that supreme authority which they now wield,--it is rather by means of all the Seasonal sacrifices that the gods slew V<i>ri</i>tra; it is by all of them that they gained that supreme authority which they now wield.</p>

They spake, 'With what king, with what leader <a name="fr_1008"></a><a href="#fn_1004"><font size="1">1</font></a> shall we fight?' Agni spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Agni for their king, with Agni for their leader, they gained four months; and with the Brahman (sacerdotium) and the threefold science they encompassed them.</p>

Varu<i>n</i>a spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Varu<i>n</i>a for their king, with Varu<i>n</i>a for their leader, they gained other four months; and with the Brahman and the threefold science they encompassed them.</p>

And, accordingly, when he performs the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, he thereby gains four months, with Agni for his king, with Agni for his leader. Then (in shaving) are used a porcupine's quill spotted in three places, and a copper razor; that three-spotted porcupine's quill resembles the threefold science, and the copper razor resembles the Brahman; for the Brahman is fire, and fire is of reddish (lohita) colour: hence a copper (loha) razor is used. Therewith he has (his head) shaved all round <a name="fr_1009"></a><a href="#fn_1005"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and thus he (the Adhvaryu) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.</p>

And when he performs the Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsa offerings, he thereby gains other four months, with Varu<i>n</i>a for his king, with Varu<i>n</i>a for his leader. Then a three-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used, wherewith he has himself shaved all round; and thus he (the priest) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.</p>

And when he performs the Sâkamedha offerings, he thereby gains other four months, with Indra for his king, with Indra for his leader. Then a three-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used, wherewith he has himself shaved; and thus he (the priest) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.</p>

And when he performs the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, then he becomes Agni, and attains to union with Agni and to co-existence in his world.
