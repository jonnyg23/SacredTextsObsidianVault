He now takes the black antelope skin <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for completeness of the sacrifice. For once upon a time the sacrifice escaped the gods, and having become a black antelope roamed about. The gods having thereupon found it and stripped it of its skin, they brought it (the skin) away with them.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:2">1:1:4:2</a></font></span>2. Its white and black hairs represent the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>-verses and the Sâman-verses; to wit, the white the Sâman and the black the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>; or conversely, the black the Sâman and the white the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>. The brown and the yellow ones, on the other hand, represent the Ya<i>g</i>us-texts.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:3">1:1:4:3</a></font></span>3. Now this same threefold science is the sacrifice; that manifold form, that (varying) colour of this (science) is what is (represented by) this black antelope skin. For the completeness of the sacrifice (he takes the skin): hence the rite of initiation (for the Soma-sacrifice) is likewise performed on the black antelope skin;--for the completion of the sacrifice: hence it is also used for husking and bruising (the rice) on, in order that nothing of the oblation may get spilt; and that, if any grain or flour should now be spilt on it, the sacrifice would still remain securely established in the sacrifice. For this reason it is used for husking and bruising upon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:4">1:1:4:4</a></font></span>4. He thus takes the black antelope skin, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S: I, 14 a): 'Bliss-bestowing (<i>s</i>arman) art thou!' For <i>k</i>arman ('hide') is the name of that (skin of the) black deer used among men, but <i>s</i>arman (bliss) is (that used) among the gods; and for this reason he says, 'Bliss-bestowing art thou!' He shakes it, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 14 b), 'Shaken off is the Rakshas, shaken off are the enemies!' whereby he repels from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas. He shakes it whilst holding it apart from the vessels <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a>; whereby he shakes off whatever impure matter there may have been on it.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:5">1:1:4:5</a></font></span>5. He spreads it (on the ground with the hairy side upwards, and) with its neck-part turned to the west <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 14 c): 'The skin of Aditi art thou! May Aditi acknowledge thee!' For Aditi is this earth, and whatever is on her, that serves as a skin to her: for this reason he says, 'The skin of Aditi art thou!' And 'may Aditi acknowledge thee!' he says, because one who is related (to another) acknowledges (him). Thereby he establishes a mutual understanding between her and the black antelope skin, (thinking) 'they will not hurt each other.' While it is still being held down with his left hand,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:6">1:1:4:6</a></font></span>6. He at once takes the mortar with his right hand, fearing lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, might rush in here in the meantime. For the priest (brâhma<i>n</i>a) <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">2</font></a> is the repeller of the Rakshas: therefore, whilst it is still being held down with his left hand,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:7">1:1:4:7</a></font></span>7. He puts the mortar (on it), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 14 d, e): 'A wooden stone (adri) art thou!'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>or 'A broad-bottomed stone (grâvan) art thou!' For, just as there (in the Soma-sacrifice) they press king Soma out with stones (grâvan), thus here also he prepares the oblation (havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a) by means of the mortar and pestle, and the large and small mill-stones <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Now 'stones (adraya<i>h</i>)' is the common name of these, and therefore he says, 'a stone art thou.' And 'wooden,' he calls it, because this one (the mortar) really is made of wood <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Or, he says, 'a broad-bottomed stone (grâvan) art thou,' because it is both a stone and broad-bottomed. He adds: 'May Aditi's skin acknowledge (receive) thee!' whereby he establishes a mutual understanding between it (the mortar) and the black antelope skin, thinking: 'they will not injure each other.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:8">1:1:4:8</a></font></span>8. He then pours the (two portions of) rice (from the winnowing basket into the mortar), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 15 a): 'Thou art the body of Agni, thou the releaser of speech!' For it is (material for) sacrifice, and hence (by being offered in the fire) it becomes Agni's body. 'The releaser of speech,' he adds, because he now releases that speech which he restrained when he was about to take the rice (from the cart). The reason why he now releases his speech, is that the sacrifice has now obtained a firm footing in the mortar, that it has become diffused; and for this reason he says, 'the releaser of speech!'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:9">1:1:4:9</a></font></span>9. Should he, however (by some accident), utter any human sound before this time, let him in that case mutter some <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> or Ya<i>g</i>us-text addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for Vish<i>n</i>u is the sacrifice, so that he thereby again obtains a hold on the sacrifice, and penance is thereby done by him (for not keeping silent). He adds: 'For the pleasure of the gods I seize thee!' for the oblation is taken with the intention 'that it shall gladden the gods.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:10">1:1:4:10</a></font></span>10. He now takes the pestle, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 14 b), 'A large, wooden stone art thou!' for it is a large stone, and made of wood, too. He thrusts it down, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 14 c), 'Do thou prepare this oblation for the gods <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">2</font></a>! do thou prepare it thoroughly!' thereby saying, 'Get this oblation ready for the gods! get it quite ready!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:11">1:1:4:11</a></font></span>11. He then calls the Havishk<i>ri</i>t <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">3</font></a> (preparer of the sacrificial food), 'Havishk<i>ri</i>t, come hither! Havishk<i>ri</i>t, come hither!' The Havishk<i>ri</i>t <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">4</font></a> no doubt is speech, so that he thereby frees speech from</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>restraint. And speech, moreover, represents sacrifice <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">1</font></a>, so that he thereby again calls the sacrifice to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:12">1:1:4:12</a></font></span>12. Now there are four different forms of this call, viz. 'come hither (ehi)!' in the case of a Brâhman; 'approach (âgahi)!' and 'hasten hither (âdrava)!' in the case of a Vai<i>s</i>ya and a member of the military caste (râ<i>g</i>anyabandhu <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">2</font></a>); and 'run hither (âdhâva)!' in that of a <i>S</i>ûdra. On this occasion he uses the call that belongs to a Brâhman, because that one is best adapted for a sacrifice, and is besides the most gentle:. let him therefore say, 'come hither (ehi)!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:13">1:1:4:13</a></font></span>13. Now in former times it was no other than the wife (of the sacrificer) who rose at this (call, to act) as Havishk<i>ri</i>t; therefore now also (she or) some one (priest) <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">3</font></a> rises in answer to this call. And at the time when he (the Adhvaryu) calls the Havishk<i>ri</i>t, one of the priests <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">4</font></a> beats the two mill-stones.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The reason why they produce this discordant noise, is this:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:14">1:1:4:14</a></font></span>14. Manu was in possession of a bull <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Into him had entered an Asura-killing, foe-killing voice; and by his snorting and roaring the Asuras and Rakshas were continually being crushed. Thereupon the Asuras said to one another: 'Evil, alas! this bull inflicts upon us! how can we possibly destroy him?' Now Kilâta and Âkuli were the two priests (brahman) of the Asuras.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:15">1:1:4:15</a></font></span>15. These two said, 'God-fearing, they say, is Manu: let us two then ascertain!' They then went to him and said: 'Manu! we will sacrifice for thee!' He said: 'Wherewith?' They said: 'With this bull!' He said: 'So be it!' On his (the bull's) being killed the voice went from him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:16">1:1:4:16</a></font></span>16. It entered into Manâvî, the wife of Manu; and when they heard her speak, the Asuras and Rakshas were continually being crushed. Thereupon the Asuras said to one another: 'Hereby even greater evil is inflicted on us, for the human voice speaks more!' Kilâta and Âkuli then said: 'God-fearing, they say, is Manu: let us then ascertain!' They went to him and said: 'Manu! we will sacrifice for thee!' He said: 'Wherewith?'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> They said: 'With this thy wife!' He said: 'So be it!' And on her being killed that voice went from her.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:17">1:1:4:17</a></font></span>17. It entered into the sacrifice itself, into the sacrificial vessels; and thence those two (Asura priests) were unable to expel it. This same Asura-killing, foe-killing voice sounds forth (from the millstones when they are beaten with the wedge). And for whomsoever that knows this, they produce this discordant noise on the present occasion, his enemies are rendered very miserable.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:18">1:1:4:18</a></font></span>18. He beats the mill-stones with the wedge, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 16 a): 'A honey-tongued cock (kukku<i>t</i>a <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">1</font></a>) art thou (O wedge)!' For honey-tongued indeed was he (the bull) for the gods, and poison-tongued for the Asuras: hence he thereby says: 'What thou wert for the gods, that be thou for us!' He adds: 'Sap and strength do thou call hither! with thy help may we conquer in every battle!' In these words there is nothing that is obscure.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:19">1:1:4:19</a></font></span>19. Thereupon <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">2</font></a> he (the Adhvaryu) takes the winnowing basket, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 14 b): 'Rain-grown art thou!' For rain-grown it is indeed, whether it be made of reeds or of cane or of rushes, since it is the rain that makes these grow.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:20">1:1:4:20</a></font></span>20. He then pours out the (threshed) rice (from the mortar into the winnowing basket), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 16 c): 'May the rain-grown acknowledge (receive) thee!' For rain-grown also are these (grains), whether they be rice or barley, since it is the rain that makes them grow. By these words he establishes an understanding between them and the winnowing basket, in the hope 'that they will not injure each other.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:21">1:1:4:21</a></font></span>21. He now winnows (the rice), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 16 d): 'Cleared off is the Rakshas! cleared off are the evil-doers!' The husks (which have fallen on the ground) he throws away <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 16 e), 'Expelled is the Rakshas!' for those evil spirits, the Rakshas, he thereby expels.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:22">1:1:4:22</a></font></span>22. He then separates (the husked grains from the unhusked), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 16 f): 'May the wind separate you!' For it is that wind (which is produced by the winnowing) which here purifies (or blows, pavate); and it is the wind that separates everything here (on earth) that undergoes separation: therefore it also separates here those (two kinds of grain) from each other. Now when they are undergoing this process, and whilst he is separating <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">2</font></a> (the husked, so as to drop them into a pot),--</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:23">1:1:4:23</a></font></span>23. He addresses (those in the pot) thus (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I, 16 g): 'May the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, the golden-handed, receive you with a flawless <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">1</font></a> hand!' By this he says: 'May they be well received!' He then cleans them thrice <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for threefold is the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:1:4:24">1:1:4:24</a></font></span>24. Here now some clean them with the formula: 'For the gods get clean! for the gods get clean!' But let him not do so: for this oblation is intended for some particular deity; and if he were to say, 'For the gods get clean!' he would make it one intended for all the deities, and would thereby raise a quarrel among the deities. Let him therefore do the cleaning silently!</p>

The two strainers also remain in the sprinkling water]. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. II, 3, 40.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_121"></a><a href="sbe1206.htm#fr_121">23:2</a> The skin of the black antelope may be regarded as one of the symbols of Brâhmanical worship and civilisation. Thus it is said in Manu II, 22-23: 'That which lies between these two mountain ranges (the Himâlaya and the Vindhya), from the eastern to the western ocean, the wise know as Âryâvarta (the land of the Âryas). Where the black antelope naturally roams about, that should be known as the land suitable for sacrifice; what lies beyond that is the country of the Mle<i>k</i><i>kh</i>as (barbarians).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_122"></a><a href="sbe1206.htm#fr_122">24:1</a> According to some exegetes the Adhvaryu himself must step beyond (i.e. aside from) the vessels when he shakes the skin; according to others, he should not move, but only hold the skin <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a> apart from the vessels, so that no impure matter should fall on them. Some also maintain that the skin should only be shaken once, whilst others think it should be done three times. Cf. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. II, 4, 2. Schol.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_123"></a><a href="sbe1206.htm#fr_123">25:1</a> Special mention is here made of this feature, since as a rule (Kâty. I, 10, 4) the skin is spread with its neck-part turned eastwards. He lays it down on the north side of the sacrificial ground, either west of the utkara (the mound formed by the earth dug out in constructing the altar, and by other rubbish) or exactly north of the Gârhapatya. Schol. on Kâty. II, 4, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="sbe1206.htm#fr_124">25:2</a> Only a Brâhman can perform sacrifice. If, as is permitted in certain ceremonies, a Kshatriya or Vai<i>s</i>ya officiates, he, as it were, becomes a Brâhman (and is addressed as such) for the occasion, by means of the dîkshâ, or rite of initiation. Cf. <i>S</i>at. Br. III, 2, I, 39; XIII, 4, 1, 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="sbe1206.htm#fr_125">26:1</a> Here, as in I, 5, 2, 11 (havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>e ’tha saumye ’dhvare), we have the simple division of the Srauta-sacrifices into oblations (of ghee, milk, rice, barley, &amp;c.) and libations (of Soma). More usually the pa<i>s</i>ubandhu, or animal-sacrifice, is added as a third division. See also I, 7, 2, 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_126"></a><a href="sbe1206.htm#fr_126">26:2</a> The mortar (ulûkhala) and pestle (musala) are to be made of very hard wood, viz. both of vara<i>n</i>a wood (Cratæga Roxburghii), or the mortar of palâ<i>s</i>a wood (Butea Frondosa), and the pestle of <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a> khadira wood (Acacia Catechu). The former is to be of the height of the knee, and the latter three aratnis (cubits) long. Schol. on Kâty. I, 3, 36; M. Müller, Die Todtenbestattung bei den Brahmanen, Zeitsch. der D. Morg. Ges.

 <p><a name="fn_127"></a><a href="sbe1206.htm#fr_127">27:1</a> Kâty. <i>S</i>r. II, 2, 6-7 lays down the general rule, that if the Brahman or Adhvaryu (and according to some, the sacrificer also) by some slip were to utter any sound during the time for which restraint of speech (vâg-yama) is enjoined, they must atone for the transgression by muttering some mantra addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u, such as the couplet (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 38, 45), 'Widely, O Vish<i>n</i>u, stride!' &amp;c., or the formula (ib. I, 4), 'O Vish<i>n</i>u, preserve the sacrifice!'</p>

According to Âpastamba, 'either a maidservant or the wife grinds; or the wife threshes and the <i>S</i>ûdra woman grinds' (cf. Schol. on Kâty. <i>S</i>r. II, 5, 7). Similarly Bhâradv. and Hira<i>n</i>y.; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 38, n. 2. Similar cases of differences between the ritualistic practices of the present time and those of former times are very frequently alluded to in the ritualistic books; and are of especial interest, as they afford some insight into the gradual development of the sacrificial ceremonial.
