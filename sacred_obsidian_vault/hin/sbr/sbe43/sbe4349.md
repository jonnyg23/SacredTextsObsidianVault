This built fire-altar, in truth, (includes) all these sacrifices:--when he slaughters an animal victim, that is the Agnyâdheya (establishment of the sacred fires) <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">1</font></a>; when he collects (the materials for) the fire-pan, that constitutes the oblations of the Agnyâdheya; when he performs the initiation,</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a></p>  
 <p>that is the Agnihotra; and when the initiated puts two logs on (the fire) <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">1</font></a>, these are the two oblations of the Agnihotra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:1:5:2">10:1:5:2</a></font></span>2. He puts them on in the evening and in the morning, for in the evening and in the morning the Agnihotra oblations are offered;--with one and the same formula, for with one and the same formula the two Agnihotra oblations are offered <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Then the driving about (of the fire in the pan <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">3</font></a>), and the taking down (to the water) of the ashes, these two (constitute) the New and Full-moon offerings; and when he builds the Gârhapatya hearth <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">4</font></a>, that is the <i>K</i>âturmâsya (seasonal offerings); and what takes place from (the building of) the Gârhapatya up to the (sowing of) all-herb (seed <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">5</font></a>, that constitutes) the ish<i>t</i>is <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and what takes place after the all-herb (sowing) and prior to (the building</p>

 <p>of) the layers, that is the animal sacrifices <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">2</font></a> which are (performed) at these sacrifices are just these Vish<i>n</i>u-strides; and what muttering of formulas there is that is the Vâtsapra <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

The first layer is the Soma-sacrifice; the second the Râ<i>g</i>asûya as prior to the consecrations <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">4</font></a>; the third the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya; the fourth the A<i>s</i>vamedha (horse-sacrifice); and the fifth the Agnisava <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Then the sâmans he sings around the built (altar) are the Mahâvrata(-sâman); the Udgât<i>ri</i>'s preliminary muttering (of the text of his chants) on that occasion is the <i>S</i>atarudriya; the 'shower of wealth' the Great Litany; and what takes place subsequent to (the singing of) the sâmans, and prior to the shower of wealth, that is the Hot<i>ri</i>'s preliminary muttering on that occasion; and what takes place after the shower of wealth is the G<i>ri</i>hamedhas <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">6</font></a> (house-sacrifices). Such are all the sacrifices: these he secures by (building) the fire-altar.</p>

Verily, he who (regularly) performs the Agnihotra eats food in the evening and in the morning (when he comes to be) in yonder world, for so much sustenance is there in that sacrifice. And he who performs the New and Full-moon sacrifice (eats food) every half-month; and he who performs the Seasonal sacrifice (does so) every four months; and be who performs the animal sacrifice (twice a year, eats food) every six months; and the Soma-sacrificer once a year; and the builder of the fire-altar at his pleasure eats food every hundred years, or abstains therefrom <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for a hundred years is as much as immortality <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">2</font></a>, unending and everlasting: and, verily, for him who knows this, there shall thus be immortality, unending and everlasting; and whatever he as much as touches, as it were, with a reed, shall be for him immortal, unending and everlasting.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_545"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_554">296:1</a> Though no animal sacrifice takes place at the Agnyâdhâna, the latter, as the fundamental ceremony pre-supposed by all subsequent sacrificial performances, is here compared with the immolation of five victims (VI, 2, 1, 15 seq.) which, taking place as it does on the Upasavatha, or day of preparation, i.e. the day before the Soma-sacrifice on the newly built fire-altar, is, as it were, a preliminary ceremony.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_546"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_555">297:1</a> This refers to the two samidhs (kindling-sticks) put on the Ukhya Agni,--one in the evening, and one in the morning,--after the ashes had been cleared out of the fire-pan (ukhâ); see VI, 6, 4, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_547"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_556">297:2</a> Both in the evening and in the morning two libations of milk are offered (the pûrvâhuti and the uttarâhuti), but only the first is offered with a formula, the evening formula being, 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, hail!' whilst the morning formula is, 'Sûrya is the light, the light is Sûrya, hail!' See II, 3, 1, 30. For alternative formulas--'With the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, with the Night (or Dawn, respectively) wedded to Indra, may Agni (or Indra, respectively) graciously accept, hail!' see II, 3, 1, 37. 38.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_548"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_557">297:3</a> See VI, 8, 1, 1 seq. Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it to refer to the Agnipra<i>n</i>ayana, or leading forward of the fire to the fire-altar; but that would not fit in well with the ceremony next referred to, viz. the removal of the fishes of the Ukhyâgni, or fire in the pan; for which see VI, 8, 2, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_549"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_558">297:4</a> VII, 1, 1, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_550"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_559">297:5</a> Viz. on the newly ploughed altar-site, see VII, 2, 4, 13 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_560">297:6</a> That is, offerings for the fulfilment of some special wishes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_561">298:1</a> That is, animal sacrifices performed independently of other ceremonies.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_562">298:2</a> See VI, 7, 2, 12 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_554"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_563">298:3</a> See VI, 7, 4, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_555"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_564">298:4</a> That is, the ceremonies connected with the Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya oblations, V, 2, 2, 4 seq.; and the devasû-havî<i>m</i>shi, or oblations to the Divine Quickeners (by whom the king is supposed to be first consecrated), V, 3, 3, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_556"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_565">298:5</a> See <a href="sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:9">IX, 3, 4, 7. 9</a>. It is strange that the Agnisava should be mentioned here, as it is said to be confined to the Agni<i>k</i>ayana. It would seem that some independent ceremony, such as the B<i>ri</i>haspatisava (consecration of B<i>ri</i>haspati, cf. V, 2, 1, 19; and part iii, introd. p. xxiv seq.), may he referred to.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_557"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_566">298:6</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a identifies these with the offerings of sacrificial sessions (sattra), during which the Sacrificer is indeed called the G<i>ri</i>hapati, or master of the house; see IV, 6, 3, 5 seq.; and part ii, p. 97, note 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_558"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_567">299:1</a> That is to say, the food eaten the first time will sustain him for a hundred years, after which time he may, or may not, take food, being sure of everlasting life and a godlike nature.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_559"></a><a href="sbe4349.htm#fr_568">299:2</a> Or, perhaps, for so long lasts the Amrita (the food of the immortals);--agni<i>m</i> <i>k</i>itavân purushas tu <i>s</i>atasa<i>m</i>khyâkeshu sa<i>m</i>vatsareshu teshu kâmam aparimitam a<i>s</i>nâti yato yâvanta<i>h</i> <i>s</i>ata<i>m</i> sa<i>m</i>vatsarâs tâvad am<i>ri</i>tam devatvaprâpakam anantam aparimitam annum bhavati.
