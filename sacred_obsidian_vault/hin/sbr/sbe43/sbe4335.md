 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:1">9:3:1:1</a></font></span>1. He then offers the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake). That Agni has now been completely restored; he now is that deity, (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara (belonging to all men): to him he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him a deity, <a href="errata.htm#2">for</a> whatever deity an oblation is prepared that is a deity, but not one for whom no (oblation) is prepared. It is one of twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the year.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:2">9:3:1:2</a></font></span>2. And, again, as to why he offers the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake),--it is as the Vai<i>s</i>vânara that he is about to produce that Agni: on that former occasion, at the initiation-offering <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he pours him out in the form of seed: and what the seed is like that is poured.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>  
 <p>into the womb, such like (is the child that) is born; and inasmuch as there he pours out Vai<i>s</i>vânara in the form of seed, therefore he now is born as Vai<i>s</i>vânara. Silently <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">1</font></a> it is (performed) there, for there seed (is implied) in the sacrifice, and silently seed is infused; but distinctly on the present occasion, for distinct (manifest) is the seed when born.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:3">9:3:1:3</a></font></span>3. Now, that Vai<i>s</i>vânara is all these worlds: this earth is the All (vi<i>s</i>va), and Agni is its man (nara); the air is the All, and Vâyu (the wind) is its man (ruler); the sky is the All, and Âditya (the sun) is its man.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:4">9:3:1:4</a></font></span>4. And these worlds are the same as this head,--this (lower part of the head) is the earth, the plants (being) the hair of its beard: this is the All, and Agni is Speech, he is the man. That (speech) is at the top thereof, for Agni is on the top of this (earth).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:5">9:3:1:5</a></font></span>5. This (central part of the face) is the air, whence it is hairless, for hairless, as it were, is the air; it is this All, and Vâyu (the wind) is the breath, he is the man; he is in the middle thereof, for the wind is in the middle of the air.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:6">9:3:1:6</a></font></span>6. The sky is the (upper part of the) head, and the stars are the hair; it is the All, and Âditya (the sun) is the eye, he is the man: it is in the lower part of the (upper) head, for the sun is below the sky. Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the head thereof, and this built-up Agni (the altar) is the body: thus, having completed his body, he restores the head thereto.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:7">9:3:1:7</a></font></span>7. He then offers the (cakes) to the Maruts;--</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Maruts’ (cakes) are the vital airs: he thus puts the vital airs into him (Agni). [He does so] after offering the Vai<i>s</i>vânara; for the Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the head: he thus puts vital airs into the head.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:8">9:3:1:8</a></font></span>8. That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara oblation) is a single one, for single, as it were, is the head; the others (viz. the Mârutas) are seven in number, of seven potsherds each; and though 'seven-seven' means 'many times,' here it is only seven <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thus places seven vital airs in the head.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:9">9:3:1:9</a></font></span>9. That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara oblation) is (performed in a) distinct (voice), for the head is distinct; but indistinct the other (oblations), for indistinct, as it were, are the vital airs. Standing he offers the former, for the head stands, so to speak; sitting the others, for the vital airs are, so to speak, seated.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:10">9:3:1:10</a></font></span>10. Now, the first two Mâruta (oblations) he offers are these two vital airs (in the ears): he offers them in the middle <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (oblations), for these two vital airs are in the middle of the head.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:11">9:3:1:11</a></font></span>11. And the second pair are these two (vital airs</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the eyes); he offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:12">9:3:1:12</a></font></span>12. And the third pair are these two (vital airs in the nostrils). He offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs. The one to be recited in the forest <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">1</font></a> is speech: it is to be recited in the forest, for by speech one gets into much terrible (trouble).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:13">9:3:1:13</a></font></span>13. And, again, as to why he offers the Vai<i>s</i>vânara and Mârutas,--the Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the ruling power (chieftaincy), and the Mârutas are the clan: he thus sets up both the chief and the clan. The Vai<i>s</i>vânara he offers first: thus, having set up the chief, he sets up the clan.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:14">9:3:1:14</a></font></span>14. The former is a single (oblation): he thus makes the ruling power (chieftaincy) to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:15">9:3:1:15</a></font></span>15. The former is (offered in a) distinct (voice), for the ruling power is something distinct, so to speak; and the others are indistinct, for indistinct, so to speak, is the clan. Standing he offers the former, for the ruling power (the chief) stands, so to speak; and sitting (he offers) the others, for the clan sits, so to speak.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:16">9:3:1:16</a></font></span>16. The former he offers with the offering-ladle,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>when the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered, with both an invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ) and an offering-formula (yâ<i>g</i>yâ); with the hand the others sitting, with the Svâhâ-call: he thus makes the clan subservient and obedient to the chieftain.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:17">9:3:1:17</a></font></span>17. As to this they say, 'How do these (Mâruta oblations) also come to be offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vasha<i>t</i>-call, and with invitatory and offering formulas?' Well, the first three feet of those seven-footed Mâruta (verses), being a three-footed Gâyatrî, are the invitatory formula, and the last four, being a four-footed Trish<i>t</i>ubh, are the offering-formula. The one is the bowl, and the other the handle (of the offering-ladle), and the Svâhâ-call is the Vasha<i>t</i>-call: in this way, then, these (Mâruta oblations) also become offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vasha<i>t</i>-call, and with invitatory and offering-formulas.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:18">9:3:1:18</a></font></span>18. And the first Mâruta (cake) which he offers on the right (south) side, is the seven (rivers) which flow eastwards. It is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven of. those (rivers) which flow eastwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:19">9:3:1:19</a></font></span>19. And the first (cake) which he offers on the left (north) side, is the seasons; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven seasons.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:20">9:3:1:20</a></font></span>20. And the second (cake) which he offers on the right side, is animals; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven domestic animals. He offers it close to the preceding one (representing the rivers): he thus settles animals near water.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:21">9:3:1:21</a></font></span>21. And the second (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the seven <i>Ri</i>shis; it is one of seven potsherds, for the seven <i>Ri</i>shis are seven in number.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus establishes the seven <i>Ri</i>shis in the seasons.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:22">9:3:1:22</a></font></span>22. And the third (cake) which he offers on the right side, is the vital airs; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven vital airs in the head. He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus puts the vital airs so as to be close to (not separated from) the head.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:23">9:3:1:23</a></font></span>23. And the third (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the metres; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven metres increasing by four (syllables respectively). He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus places the metres close to the <i>Ri</i>shis.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:24">9:3:1:24</a></font></span>24. And the Ara<i>n</i>ye<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nû<i>k</i>ya is the seven (rivers) which flow westwards; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven of those (rivers) which flow westwards. It is that downward vital air of his. That Ara<i>n</i>ye<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nû<i>k</i>ya belongs to this Pra<i>g</i>âpati; for the forest (ara<i>n</i>ya) is, as it were, concealed, and concealed, as it were, is that downward vital air; whence those who drink of these (downward flowing) rivers become most vile, most blasphemous, most lascivious in their speech. Whenever he here speaks of them as belonging to the Maruts, he makes them food for him (Agni) <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">1</font></a> and offers it to him, and gratifies him thereby.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:25">9:3:1:25</a></font></span>25. That Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake), doubtless, is yonder sun, and the Mâruta (cakes) are those rays. They are of seven potsherds each, for the troops of the Maruts consist of seven each.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:3:1:26">9:3:1:26</a></font></span>26. He offers (the first Mâruta cake), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 80), 'The clear-lighted, and the bright- lighted, and the true-lighted, and the light, and the clear, and the law-observing, and the sinless one!'--these are their names: having completed that disk (of the sun, in the shape of the Vai<i>s</i>vânara), he bestows those rays on it by calling them by their names.</p>

Whilst the initiation-offering of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice consists only of a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, that of the Agni<i>k</i>ayana requires two further oblations, viz. a cake on twelve potsherds to Vai<i>s</i>vânara, and a rice-pap with ghee to the Âdityas; cf. part iii, p. 247 note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_348"></a><a href="sbe4335.htm#fr_354">208:1</a> Or, rather, in a low voice, the name of the deity being pronounced in an undertone while the oblation is poured into the fire; see VI, 6, 1, 11. No special formula is, however, used on either occasion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_349"></a><a href="sbe4335.htm#fr_355">209:1</a> See <a href="sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:2">VIII, 1, 1, 2</a>. Also VI, 5, 3, 11, where the translation should be altered accordingly.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_350"></a><a href="sbe4335.htm#fr_356">209:2</a> In baking the cakes, the Vai<i>s</i>vânara is placed on the centre of the fire, and the first two Mâruta cakes are placed north and south of it, then the following pair of cakes behind the first, but more closely together, and behind these the third pair, still more closely together, and finally the last cake forming, as it were, the apex of a phalanx of Mâruta cakes (or wind-deities) protecting (that of) Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara. In offering the cakes a similar method is to be followed; except that the first pair of Mâruta cakes may be offered, not in the fire itself, but on the previously flattened out Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake lying on the fire. Whilst the Kâtîya-sûtra (XVIII, 4, 23) admits this as an alternative mode (though not very clearly expressed), our passage seems to require it as the only possible mode. Both the Vai<i>s</i>vânara and the Mâruta cakes are offered whole.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_351"></a><a href="sbe4335.htm#fr_357">210:1</a> 'Ara<i>n</i>ye<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nû<i>k</i>ya' is the technical term applied to the odd, or seventh, Mâruta oblation. According to Sâya<i>n</i>a it is so called after an anuvâka of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, to be recited only in the forest. Possibly, however, it is to the particular formula (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXIX, 7), also called 'vimukha' (? to be pronounced 'with averted face'), and containing the names of the seven most terrible Maruts, that the name applies.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_352"></a><a href="sbe4335.htm#fr_358">212:1</a> Probably, inasmuch as the Maruts (and the Mâruta oblations) represent the clansmen who are considered the legitimate 'food' or the chief, Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara.</p>
