Now at the house of Aru<i>n</i>a Aupave<i>s</i>i <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">1</font></a> these came once together,--Satyaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a Paulushi, Mahâ<i>s</i>âla <i>G</i>âbâla, Bu<i>d</i>ila Â<i>s</i>vatarâ<i>s</i>vi, Indradyumna Bhâllaveya, and <i>G</i>ana<i>s</i>ârkarâkshya. They took counsel together regarding (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara, but did not agree as to Vai<i>s</i>vânara <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

They went to A<i>s</i>vapati Kaikeya. He ordered for them separate dwellings, separate honours, separate Soma-sacrifices each with a thousand gifts. In the morning, still at variance with one another, they</p>

 <p>came again to him, with fuel in their hands <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">1</font></a>, saying, 'We want to become thy pupils.'</p>

He said, 'How is this, venerable sirs, when ye are learned in the scriptures, and sons of men learned in the scriptures?' They replied, 'Venerable sir, thou knowest Vai<i>s</i>vânara thoroughly: teach us him!' He said, 'I do indeed know Vai<i>s</i>vânara thoroughly: put your fuel on (the fire), ye are become my pupils <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_797"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_810">393:2</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a takes this to mean, 'he (Aru<i>n</i>a) was unable to instruct them in regard to Vai<i>s</i>vânara,'--so<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>ru<i>n</i>as teshâ<i>m</i> satyaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âdînâ<i>m</i> pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ânâ<i>m</i> vai<i>s</i>vânaravidyâ<i>m</i> bodhayitu<i>m</i> na samiyâya sa<i>m</i>gata<i>h</i> <i>s</i>akto nâbhavat,--probably, however, 'samiyâya' is better taken impersonally ('there was no agreement between them'), as is done by the St. Petersb. Dict.; though <i>Kh</i>ând. XI, 3 favours Sâya<i>n</i>a's view.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_798"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_811">393:3</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a takes 'samprati' in its ordinary sense of 'now.' The knowledge of Vai<i>s</i>vânara implied here, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, means the knowledge of the supreme deity (parame<i>s</i>vara).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_799"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_812">394:1</a> That is, in the way in which pupils approach their teacher.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_800"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_813">394:2</a> Literally, 'Ye have entered (my tuition);' upetâ stha upâsînâ bhavatha. Sây.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_801"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_814">394:3</a> Or, perhaps, 'what Vai<i>s</i>vânara knowest thou?'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_802"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_815">394:4</a> 'Pratish<i>th</i>â' (rest, foundation) also commonly means 'the feet.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_803"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_816">394:5</a> It is not quite clear whether the words 'or the feet, &amp;c.' really (as Sâya<i>n</i>a takes them) form part of the king's speech, or whether they are merely meant as explanatory of the latter part of the king's remarks. If Sâya<i>n</i>a be right, the words 'the feet would be unknown by thee,' seem to admit of a double meaning, viz. 'thou wouldst <a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 395</font></a> have become footless,' or 'not even Vai<i>s</i>vânara's feet would have been known by thee;' though in the latter sense some particle such as 'eva' might have been expected. Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, seems to take these words in yet another sense (if, indeed, he had not another reading before him),--vai<i>s</i>vânarasyâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânât pâdau te tava viparîtagrâhi<i>n</i>o amlâsyatâm amlânau gamanâsamarthâv abhavishyatâ<i>m</i> yadi mâ<i>m</i> nâgamishya<i>h</i>; ittha<i>m</i> doshaparyavasânayuktam ekade<i>s</i>a<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânam eva nâva<i>s</i>esha ity âha, pâdau to viditâv iti vai<i>s</i>vânarasya pâdamâtra<i>m</i> tvayâ vidita<i>m</i> na tu k<i>ri</i>tsno vai<i>s</i>vânara<i>h</i>; ata<i>h</i> sâdhv akârshîr yat tvam âgato<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>sîty abhiprâya<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_804"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_817">396:1</a> Or, perhaps better, 'of Soma's fire.' The <i>Kh</i>ândogya-upanishad has 'Sute<i>g</i>as (of beautiful splendour, or light),' instead of 'sutate<i>g</i>as.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_805"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_818">396:2</a> According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, this refers to the cooking, or baking, of the cakes (puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a) connected with the Soma-sacrifice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_806"></a><a href="sbe4371.htm#fr_819">397:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a apparently takes this thus: but the gods, knowing well that (essential element) which is merely of the space of a span, have become successful;--yat tv eva<i>m</i> yathoktâvayavai<i>h</i> p<i>ri</i>thivîpâdâdibhir dyumûrdhântair avayavair vi<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>am eka<i>m</i> vastu tat prâde<i>s</i>amâtra<i>m</i> prâde<i>s</i>apramâ<i>n</i>am iva devâ<i>h</i> suvidita<i>h</i> samyag <i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âtavanto<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>bhisampannâ<i>h</i> prâptaphalâ babhûvur ity artha<i>h</i>. Though this interpretation looks very plausible, the accent of 'súvidita' would scarcely admit of the word being taken as a bahuvrîhi compound. In the words which follow, Sâya<i>n</i>a takes 'them (enân)' to refer to the bodily parts of Vai<i>s</i>vânara, identified with the imperfect doctrines of the king's disciples. It is, indeed, quite possible that 'the gods' are here identified with the special Vai<i>s</i>vânaras, the unity of whom, in the one Purusha, or Atman (self), the Brâhma<i>n</i>a endeavours to inculcate.</p>
