 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:1">8:3:2:1</a></font></span>1. He then lays down a Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (all-light brick). Now the middle Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis is Vâyu <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for Vâyu (the wind) is all the light in the air-world: it is Vâyu he thus places therein. He places it so as not to be separated from the regional (bricks): he thus places Vâyu in the regions, and hence there is wind in all the regions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:2">8:3:2:2</a></font></span>2. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis,--the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis, doubtless, is offspring (or creatures), for offspring indeed is all the light: he thus lays generative power (into that world). He places it so as not to be separated from the regional ones <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he thus places creatures in the regions, and hence there are creatures in all the regions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:3">8:3:2:3</a></font></span>3. [He lays it down, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 14], 'May Vi<i>s</i>vakarman settle thee!' for Vi<i>s</i>vakarman saw this third layer <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">3</font></a>;--'on the back of the air, thee the brilliant one!' for on the back of the air that brilliant Vâyu indeed is.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:4">8:3:2:4</a></font></span>4. 'For all up-breathing, down-breathing, through-breathing,'--for the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis is breath,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>and breath indeed is (necessary) for this entire universe;--'give all the light!'--that is, 'give the whole light;'--'Vâyu is thine over-lord,'--it is Vâyu he thus makes the over-lord of that (layer and the air-world). Having settled it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas over it: the significance of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:5">8:3:2:5</a></font></span>5. He then lays down two Ritavyâ (seasonal <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">1</font></a> bricks);--the two seasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus places therein.[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 15], 'Nabha and Nabhasya, the two rainy seasons,' these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avakâ-plants and covers them</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>with avakâ-plants <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for avakâ-plants mean water he thus bestows water on that season, whence it rains most abundantly in that season.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:6">8:3:2:6</a></font></span>6. Then the two upper ones, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, I6), 'Isha and Ûr<i>g</i>a, the two autumnal seasons,'--these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them only once: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avakâ-plants, for the avakâ-plants mean water: he thus bestows water before that season, whence it rains before that season. He does not cover them afterwards, whence it does not likewise rain after (that season).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:7">8:3:2:7</a></font></span>7. And as to why he places these (four bricks) in this (layer),--this fire-altar is the year, and the year is the same as these worlds, and the middlemost layer is the air (-world) thereof; and the rainy season and autumn are the air (-world) thereof: hence when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni) what (part) of his body these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:8">8:3:2:8</a></font></span>8. And, again, as to why he places them in this (layer),--this Agni (the fire-altar) is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year. Now the middlemost layer is the middle of this (altar), and the rainy season and the autumn are the middle of that (year): hence when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) what part of his</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>body these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:9">8:3:2:9</a></font></span>9. There are here four seasonal (bricks) he lays down in the middlemost layer; and two in each of the other layers,--animals (cattle) are four-footed, and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places animals in the air, and hence there are animals that have their abode in the air.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:10">8:3:2:10</a></font></span>10. And, again, why there are four,--animals are four-footed, and animals are food; and the middle-most layer is the middle (of Agni's body): he thus puts food in the middle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:11">8:3:2:11</a></font></span>11. And, again, why there are four,--'antariksha' (air) consists of four syllables, and the other layers (<i>k</i>iti) consist of two syllables; hence as much as the air consists of, so much he makes it in laying it down.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:12">8:3:2:12</a></font></span>12. And, again, why there are four,--this Agni (altar), doubtless, is an animal: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence an animal is biggest towards the middle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:13">8:3:2:13</a></font></span>13. There are here four <i>Ri</i>tavyâs, the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis being the fifth, and five Di<i>s</i>yâs,--this makes ten: the Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and the Virâ<i>g</i> is food, and the middlemost layer is the middle;--he thus puts food in the middle (of the body). He lays them down so as not to be separated from the naturally-perforated one <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital air. Subsequently (to the central brick) he lays them down: subsequently</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>to (or upon) the vital air he thus places food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:2:14">8:3:2:14</a></font></span>14. He then lays down the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>t <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">1</font></a> (bricks);--the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts (breath-holders), doubtless, are the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays into (Agni's body). There are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the forepart (of the altar),--for there are these vital airs in front,--with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 17), 'Protect my vital strength! protect mine up-breathing! protect my down-breathing! protect my through-breathing! protect mine eye! protect mine ear! increase my speech! animate my mind! protect my soul (or body)! give me light!'--He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal ones, for the vital air is wind: he thus establishes the wind in the seasons.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="sbe4312.htm#fr_114">47:1</a> The three Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis bricks, placed in (the fourth easterly place from the centre of) the first, third and fifth layer respectively, are supposed to represent the regents of the three worlds--earth, air and sky--which these three layers represent, viz. Agni, Vâyu and Âditya (Sûrya). See VI, 3, 3, 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_114"></a><a href="sbe4312.htm#fr_115">47:2</a> Though, properly speaking, the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis lies close to only one of the Di<i>s</i>yâs, viz. the eastern one, it may at any rate be said to lie close to the range of the Di<i>s</i>yâs. Here, too, the sense 'immediately after, not separated from them in respect of time,' would suit even better.</p>

 <p>These two <i>Ri</i>tavyâs are placed beside (east of) the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis, one north of the other, just over those of the first and second layers, that is to say, in the fifth space from the centre.
