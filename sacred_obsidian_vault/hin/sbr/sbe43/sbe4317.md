These, then, are seventeen bricks he lays down,--the year, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, is seventeenfold, he is the progenitor: it is thus by this seventeenfold year, by Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the progenitor, that he caused these creatures to be generated. And what he generated, he created; and inasmuch as he created (s<i>ri</i><i>g</i>), therefore they are called creations (s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i). Having created them, he made them enter his own self: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now cause these creatures to be generated by that seventeenfold year, by Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the progenitor; and having created them, he makes them enter his own self <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">1</font></a>.

 <p>range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (he lays down these bricks): the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> being the ribs, and the ribs the middle (of the body), it is in the very middle that he causes these creatures to enter him. He lays them on all sides: from all sides he thus makes these creatures to enter him.</p>

Whilst the bricks of the south side are further specified as consisting of a brick, a foot square, lying on the cross-spine, being flanked on both sides by half-foot bricks, and these again by square bricks; no particulars are given regarding the other sides. Most likely, however, as indicated in the accompanying sketch, four square bricks, two on each side of the cross-spine, are to form the left (north) side, whilst the front and hind sides are to consist of two <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a> square bricks lying north and south of the spine, and flanked by half-foot bricks.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_144"></a><a href="sbe4317.htm#fr_145">72:2</a> Professor Delbrück, in his Altindische Syntax, pp. 136, 257, 265, takes 'stoshyâmahe' in this passage in a passive sense--'by whom shall we be praised?' I think, however, that this is a mistake, and Harisvâmin's commentary certainly takes it in the same sense as I have done; and, indeed, the paragraphs which follow seem to me to make it quite clear that no other interpretation is possible. Pra<i>g</i>âpati is about to perform the 's<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>is,' i. e. the creation of living beings by means of sacrifice (his own self). He requires the assistance of the Prâ<i>n</i>as (vital airs) in order to produce creatures endowed with breath, and he also appeals to (the three most prominent of) them in their capacity as <i>Ri</i>shis (VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.) to officiate as his (Udgât<i>ri</i>) priests. They ask, 'Wherewith shall we sing praises?' and he answers, 'With me and with your own selves.' The wherewith,' according to Harisvâmin, refers both to the 'stotriyâ' verses to be used, and to the deities of the s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i-stotras. That the former, at all events, is indeed the case, a glance at the subsequent paragraphs shows, where the stotriyâs are identified with the vital airs, and, when their number (ten) becomes exhausted, with parts of the year (Pra<i>g</i>âpati), and of his (the Sacrificer's, or Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) body. As regards the deities whom Harisvâmin considers to be likewise implied, this also is by no means improbable, though I must confess that it did not occur to me, before I looked at the commentary. In the Udgât<i>ri</i>'s text-books, the chanting of stotras is usually interpreted as symbolising the production of 'food' (cf., for instance, Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya-Br. I, 3, 6, 'anna<i>m</i> karishyâmy anna<i>m</i> pravishyâmy anna<i>m</i> <i>g</i>anayishyâmi'), whilst here it seems identified with the production of life, or breath itself (cf. ib. 5, 'b<i>ri</i>haspatis tvâ yunaktu devebhya<i>h</i> prâ<i>n</i>âya &amp;c.'); and, accordingly, in Sat. Br. X, 3, 1, 1, 7, the principal vital air, the breath proper, is called 'pra<i>g</i>anana-prâ<i>n</i>a.'</p>
