 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:1">10:5:1</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:1:1">10:5:1:1</a></font></span>1. The mystic import of this Fire-altar, doubtless, is Speech; for it is with speech that it is built: with the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, the Ya<i>g</i>us and the Sâman as the divine (speech); and when he (the Adhvaryu) speaks with human speech, 'Do ye this! do ye that!' then also it (the altar) is built therewith.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:1:2">10:5:1:2</a></font></span>2. Now, this speech is threefold--the <i>Ri</i>k-verses, the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas, and the Sâman-tunes;--thereby the Fire-altar is threefold, inasmuch as it is built with that triad. Even thus, then, it is threefold; but in this respect also it is threefold, inasmuch as three kinds of bricks are put into it--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names; and these limbs of men also are of three kinds--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:1:3">10:5:1:3</a></font></span>3. This body (of the altar), indeed, is threefold; and with this threefold body he obtains the threefold divine Am<i>ri</i>ta (nectar, immortality). Now all these (bricks) are called 'ish<i>t</i>akâ (f.),' not 'ish<i>t</i>aka<i>h</i> (m.),' nor 'ish<i>t</i>akam (n.):' thus (they are called) after the form of speech (vâ<i>k</i>, f.), for everything here is speech--whether feminine (female), masculine (male), or neuter--for by speech everything here is obtained. Therefore he 'settles' all (the bricks) <a name="fr_725"></a><a href="#fn_713"><font size="1">1</font></a> with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvâ, f.)!' not with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruva<i>h</i>, m.)!' or with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvam, n.)!' for it is that Speech he is constructing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:1:4">10:5:1:4</a></font></span>4. Now, this speech is yonder sun, and this (Agni, the Fire-altar) is Death: hence whatsoever is on this side of the sun all that is field by Death; and he who builds it (the Fire-altar) on this side thereof, builds it as one held by Death, and he surrenders his own self unto Death; but he who builds it thereabove, conquers recurring Death, for by his knowledge that (altar) of his is built thereabove.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:1:5">10:5:1:5</a></font></span>5. This speech, indeed, is threefold--the <i>Ri</i>k-verses, the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas, and the Sâman-tunes the <i>Ri</i>k-verses are the orb, the Sâman-tunes the light, and the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas the man (in the sun); and that immortal element, the shining light, is this lotus-leaf <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_714"><font size="1">2</font></a>: thus, when he builds up the Fire-altar</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 366</font></a></p>  
 <p>after laying down the lotus-leaf, it is on that immortal element that he builds for himself a body consisting of the <i>Ri</i>k, the Ya<i>g</i>us, and the Sâman; and he becomes immortal.</p>
