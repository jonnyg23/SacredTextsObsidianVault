 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:1:2:1">10:1:2:1</a></font></span>1. Pra<i>g</i>âpati was desirous of gaining these worlds. He saw this bird-like body, the Fire-altar: he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a></p>  
 <p>fashioned it, and thereby gained this (terrestrial) world. He saw a second bird-like body, the (chant of the) Great Rite <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he fashioned it, and thereby gained the air. He saw a third bird-like body, the Great Litany <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he fashioned it, and thereby gained the sky.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:1:2:2">10:1:2:2</a></font></span>2. This built Fire-altar, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, the Great Rite the air, and the Great Litany the sky: all these, the Fire-altar, the Great Rite, and the Great Litany, one ought therefore to undertake together, for these worlds were created together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of these worlds this (terrestrial) one was created first. Thus with regard to the deity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:1:2:3">10:1:2:3</a></font></span>3. Now with regard to the body. The Fire-altar is the mind, the (chant of the) Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake together, for mind, breath, and speech belong together; as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because the mind is prior to the breathings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:1:2:4">10:1:2:4</a></font></span>4. The Fire-altar, indeed, is the body (trunk), the Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake together, for body, breath, and speech belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is produced the trunk is produced first.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:1:2:5">10:1:2:5</a></font></span>5. The Fire-altar, indeed, is the head, the Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany the body:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a></p>  
 <p>one ought therefore to undertake all these together, for head, breath, and body belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is born the head is born first; and hence, whenever all these are undertaken together the Great Litany, indeed, is accounted the highest (âtamâm) <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the Great Litany is the body (or self, âtman).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:1:2:6">10:1:2:6</a></font></span>6. As to this they say, 'If all these are difficult to obtain together, what (means of) obtaining them is there?'--In the <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma (form of the) Agnish<i>t</i>oma <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">2</font></a>: let him perform offering with the <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma Agnish<i>t</i>oma.</p>

In this <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma Agnish<i>t</i>oma the Bahishpavamâna (stotra) is (in) the Triv<i>ri</i>t (stoma)--that is the head of the rite; the two other Pavamânas are (in) the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a and Saptada<i>s</i>a (stomas)--they are the two wings; the Hot<i>ri</i>'s</p>

Now these two, the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a and Saptada<i>s</i>a, have thirty-two hymn-verses: twenty-five of these are the twenty-five-fold body <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and the seven which remain over are the Parimâd (sâmans), for these are the cattle (or animals), (for) cattle are sporting all around us (pari-mâd <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">2</font></a>)--thus much, then, is the</p>

And the Hot<i>ri</i> recites seven metres--each subsequent one-versed (metre) increasing by four (syllables)--with the Virâ<i>g</i> as an eighth: these (eight) consist of three eighties and forty-five syllables. Now by the eighties thereof the eighties (of the mahad uktham) <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">1</font></a> are obtained, for the Great Litany is counted (or recited) by eighties (of triplets); and of the forty-five (syllables which remain) twenty-five are this twenty-five-fold body <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and where the body is there, indeed, are (included) the head, and the wings and tail; and the twenty (syllables which remain) are the insertion <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">3</font></a>;--thus much, then, is the Great Litany: thereby he obtains the Great Litany even in this (Agnish<i>t</i>oma). All these (three) are indeed obtained in the <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma Agnish<i>t</i>oma: let him, therefore, perform offering with the <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma Agnish<i>t</i>oma.</p>

In the <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma the order of stomas is that set forth in <a href="sbe4346.htm#10:1:2:7">paragraph 7</a>, viz.: a. Bahishpavamâna-stotra in the Triv<i>ri</i>t (nine-versed); b. Â<i>g</i>ya-stotras, and c. Mâdhyandina-pavamâna-stotra, in the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a (fifteen-versed); d. P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotras, and e.

Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sâman (Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya) in the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (twenty-one-versed) stoma, or hymn-form. In the Gosh<i>t</i>oma, on the other hand, the succession of stomas is a. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a, b. Triv<i>ri</i>t, c. d. Saptada<i>s</i>a, e. f. Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a; and in the Âyush<i>t</i>oma: a. Triv<i>ri</i>t, b. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a, (c. d.) Saptada<i>s</i>a, (e. f.) Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a. Cf. part ii, p. 402, note 4; for the scheme of Stotras (and Sastras), ib. p. 325, note 2. The Agnish<i>t</i>oma is singled out here for the reason that the Mahâvrata-day takes the form of an Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice.</p>

They are given, figured for chanting, in the Ara<i>n</i>yagâna of the Sâma-veda (Calc. ed., ii, p. 387 seq.). This performance takes place immediately after the Adhvaryu has given the sign for, and the Udgât<i>ri</i> 'yoked,' the Mahâvrata-stotra or sâman (i. e. the Hot<i>ri</i>'s P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>astotra of the Great Rite),--or, according to some authorities, before either the 'yoking,' or the Adhvaryu's summons,--and thus serves as an introduction to the central and chief element of the Great Rite, the Mahâvrata-sâman. According to the ritual symbolism, these preliminary sâmans are intended to supply the newly completed Pra<i>g</i>âpati with hair (feathers) and nails; but the performance would rather seem to he a solemn mode of doing homage (upasthânam) to the different parts of the bird-like altar and the sacrificial ground; thus corresponding to a similar, though simpler, ceremony performed on the completion of the fire-altar in its simplest form, as described at <a href="sbe4331.htm#9:1:2:35">IX, 1, 2, 35</a>-<a href="sbe4331.htm#9:1:2:43">43</a>.
