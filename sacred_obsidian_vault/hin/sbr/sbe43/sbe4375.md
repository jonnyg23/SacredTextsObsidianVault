 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:1">10:6:5:1</a></font></span>1. Verily, there was nothing here in the beginning: by Death this (universe) was covered, by hunger, for Death is hunger. He created for himself this mind, thinking, 'May I have a soul.' He went on worshipping. Whilst he was worshipping the waters were produced. 'Verily, to me worshipping (ar<i>k</i>) water (kam) has been produced,' thus (he thought): this, indeed, is the Arka-nature of the Arkya <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and, verily, there is joy (kam) for him who thus knows the Arka-nature of the Arkya.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:2">10:6:5:2</a></font></span>2. The Arka, doubtless, is the waters; and the cream (froth) which was on the waters was compacted, and became this earth. Thereon he wearied himself, and the glow and essence (sweat) of him thus wearied and heated developed into Fire.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:3">10:6:5:3</a></font></span>3. He made himself threefold--(Agni being one-third), Âditya one-third, and Vâyu one-third: that is this threefold breath. The eastern quarter was his head, this and that (intermediate quarters) are his fore-feet, the western quarter his tail, this and that (intermediate quarters) his thighs, the southern and northern quarters his flanks; the sky his back, the air his belly, and this (earth) his chest:--on the waters he was established any and everywhere, and so indeed is he established who knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:4">10:6:5:4</a></font></span>4. He desired, 'May a second self be produced for me.' By his mind he entered into union with speech,--(to wit) Death with hunger: the seed which was produced became the year, for theretofore there was no year. For as long as the year he (Death) carried him (within him), and at the end of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 403</font></a></p>  
 <p>that time he produced him <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He opened his mouth (to devour) the new-born one, and he (the child) cried 'bhâ<i>n</i>'; thus speech was produced.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:5">10:6:5:5</a></font></span>5. He bethought him, 'Surely, if I kill him, I shall gain but little food <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' By that speech and that soul of his he created all this (universe) whatsoever there is,--<i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (hymn-verses), Ya<i>g</i>us (formulas), Sâman (hymn-tunes), metres, sacrifices, men, and beasts. And whatsoever he created he set about devouring; and because he eats (ad) everything, hence the name 'Aditi'; and, verily, he who thus knows the nature of Aditi becomes an eater of everything, and all food becomes his.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:6">10:6:5:6</a></font></span>6. He desired, 'May I again sacrifice by yet another sacrifice.' He wearied himself and practised austerity. From him, thus wearied and heated, glory and vigour departed; and glory and vigour, indeed, are the vital airs. The vital airs having departed, that body of his began to swell. The mind was yet in the body;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:7">10:6:5:7</a></font></span>7. He desired, 'May this (body) of mine be sacrificially pure: may I thereby be possessed of a self!' Thereupon the horse (a<i>s</i>va) was produced; and because that which was swelling <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">3</font></a> (a<i>s</i>vat) became pure (medhya) therefore the name A<i>s</i>vamedha (belongs to that sacrifice). He, indeed, knows the A<i>s</i>vamedha who thus knows him <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:8">10:6:5:8</a></font></span>8. He bethought him of leaving it unrestrained <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">1</font></a>. At the end of a year he slaughtered it for his own self, and made over the (sacrificial) animals to the deities: therefore they slaughter the consecrated (victim) as one that, in its nature as Pra<i>g</i>âpati, represents all the deities. But the A<i>s</i>vamedha, in truth, is he that shines yonder (the sun), and the year is his body. The Arka is this Fire, and these worlds are his bodies. These two are the Arka and A<i>s</i>vamedha; but these, indeed, become again one deity, to wit, Death. And, verily, whosoever knows this, conquers recurrent Death, and Death has no hold on him: Death is his own self; he attains all life, and becomes one of those deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:6:5:9">10:6:5:9</a></font></span>9. Now the line of succession (of teachers). The same as far as Sâ<i>m</i><i>g</i>îvîputra. Sâ<i>m</i><i>g</i>îvîputra (received it) from Mâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ûkâyani, Mâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ûkâyani from Mâ<i>n</i>davya, Mâ<i>n</i>davya from Kautsa, Kautsa from Mâhitthi, Mâhitthi from Vâmakakshâya<i>n</i>a, Vâmakakshâya<i>n</i>a from Vâtsya, Vâtsya from <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya, <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya from Ku<i>s</i>ri, Ku<i>s</i>ri from Yag<i>ñ</i>ava<i>k</i>as Râ<i>g</i>astambâyana, Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ava<i>k</i>as Râ<i>g</i>astambâyana from Tura Kâvasheya, Tura Kâvasheya from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, Pra<i>g</i>âpati from Brahman (n.). Brahman is the self-existent: reverence be to Brahman!</p>
