 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:1">8:4:4:1</a></font></span>1. Now, then, as to the order of proceeding. That (brick) which contains the Triv<i>ri</i>t (thrice-threefold stoma) he places in front, that containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma) at the back, that containing the fifteenfold (stoma) on the right (south) side, that containing the seventeenfold (stoma) on the left (north) side.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:2">8:4:4:2</a></font></span>2. Now when the one containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t had been laid down, Death lay in wait for Pra<i>g</i>âpati in the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma), thinking, 'After that he will lay down this one: I will here seize upon him!' He (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) was aware of him, and having seen him, he walked round and laid down (at the back) the (brick) containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma). Death came thither, and he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) laid down the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma). Death came to the fifteenfold one, and he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) laid down the one (on the north side) containing the seventeenfold (stoma). It was here <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">1</font></a> that he put down and confounded Death; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now put down and confound all evils</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:3">8:4:4:3</a></font></span>3. Then as to the subsequent (bricks). Alongside of the one (in front) containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t he lays down one containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t; alongside of that (at the back) containing the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (he lays down) one containing the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a; alongside of that (on the south, or right, side) containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a (he lays down) one containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a; alongside of that (on the north, or left, side) containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a (he lays down) one containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a. And because he thus changes in laying them down <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">1</font></a>, therefore they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas; and because these stomas are then otherwise with regard to the former ones <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">2</font></a>, therefore also they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas. And in this way the gods laid them down, and otherwise the Asuras; whereupon the gods succeeded, and the Asuras came to naught: he who knows this, succeeds of himself, and his hateful enemy comes to naught.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:4">8:4:4:4</a></font></span>4. Now, this Agni (fire-altar) is an animal, and he is made up (restored) here whole and entire. His head is the two (bricks) containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t; and as to why these two are such as contain the Triv<i>ri</i>t,--the head is threefold (triv<i>ri</i>t). There are two of them, because the head consists of two bones (kapâla). He lays them down in front, for this head is in the front (of the animal).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:5">8:4:4:5</a></font></span>5. The two (behind) containing the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a are the foundation (the feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a,--the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>a foundation. There are two of them,--because the foundation is a pair (of feet). He places them behind, because this foundation (the hind-feet) is behind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:6">8:4:4:6</a></font></span>6. The two containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">1</font></a> are the arms (or fore-feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a,--the arms are fifteenfold. There are two of them, because these arms are two. He places them on the sides, because these two arms are at the sides.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:7">8:4:4:7</a></font></span>7. The two containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a are food. And as to why they are such as contain the Saptada<i>s</i>a,--food is seventeenfold. There are two of them, because 'anna' (food) has two syllables. He lays them down close to those containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a he thus puts the food close to the arms. Those containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a are on the outside, and those containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a on the inside: he thus encloses the food on both sides by the arms.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:8">8:4:4:8</a></font></span>8. And those he places in the middle are the body (trunk). He places them on the range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (bricks), for--the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the body)--this body is in the middle (of the limbs) <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">2</font></a>. He places them in every direction, for this body (extends) in every direction. And as to what other (space) there is besides this, that is left over;--and what is left over for the gods, that is these metres;--and as to these</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>metres, they are cattle;--and as to cattle, they are (objects of) good fortune;--and as to these (objects of) good fortune, they are yonder sun: he is that one to the south of them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:9">8:4:4:9</a></font></span>9. Now some lay down these (rows of bricks <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">1</font></a>) immediately after the two containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t, saying, 'They are the tongue and the jaws: those fourteen are the jaws, and those six are the tongue.' Let him not do so: they cause a redundancy,--it would be just as if one were to put two other jaws to the already existing jaws, as if one were to put another tongue to the already existing tongue. That (brick) wherein the head is indeed (includes) the jaws and the tongue.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:10">8:4:4:10</a></font></span>10. Now some lay down (these bricks) in the intermediate (south-eastern) space of it (the altar) <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">2</font></a>, saying, 'This is the sun: we thus place yonder sun in that direction.' Let him not do so: surely there are those other rites <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">3</font></a> by which he places him in that (direction).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:4:4:11">8:4:4:11</a></font></span>11. Some, again, lay them down on the right</p>

But let him place them in front; for where the head is there are also the jaws and the tongue: and thus he places the signs of good fortune at the head (or, in the mouth, mukhata<i>h</i>), whence they say that he who has a (peculiar) mark in his mouth <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">4</font></a> has good luck.</p>

This, indeed, is Brahman's layer: inasmuch as they (the gods) laid down the Brahman <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">5</font></a>, therefore it is Brahman's layer. It is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Pra<i>g</i>âpati <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">6</font></a>, it is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's layer. It is the <i>Ri</i>shis’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the <i>Ri</i>shis <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">7</font></a>, it is the <i>Ri</i>shis’ layer. It is Vâyu's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Vâyu <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">8</font></a>, it is Vâyu's layer. It is the Stomas’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the hymn-forms <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">9</font></a>, it is the Stomas’</p>

 <p>layer. It is the layer of the vital airs: inasmuch as they laid down the vital airs <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">1</font></a>, it is the layer of the vital airs. Hence, whatsoever one may know, that comes to be included in the ancestry, in the kinship <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">2</font></a> of this layer.--He then lays down two Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs (space-filling bricks) in that corner <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">3</font></a>: the significance of these (will be explained) farther on <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">4</font></a>.

 <p><a name="fn_147"></a><a href="sbe4318.htm#fr_148">78:1</a> The Sanskrit text, as usual, makes our gerundial clause the principal clause: 'because he lays them down in changing them.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_151"></a><a href="sbe4318.htm#fr_152">80:1</a> Viz. the row of fourteen bricks lying behind the two front bricks, and the row of six bricks again placed behind these. It will he remembered that only the northern one of the two front bricks was laid down at first, and that then three others were placed in the different directions, after which the row of fourteen was laid down behind the front one; and similarly the laying down of the second front brick was separated from that of the second row by the laying down of three other bricks in the different quarters.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_152"></a><a href="sbe4318.htm#fr_153">80:2</a> In that case, the two shank-sized bricks are laid down in the south-east corner, and the rows of smaller bricks are placed to the north of them. See Kâty. <i>S</i>rautas. XIV, I0, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_153"></a><a href="sbe4318.htm#fr_154">80:3</a> See, for instance, VI, 7, 3, 9 where the Ukhya Agni, representing the sun, is held up by the Agni<i>k</i>it (sacrificer) in the south-easterly direction. The south-east corner is sacred to Agni.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_156"></a><a href="sbe4318.htm#fr_157">81:3</a> This clause is rather abrupt, and is, moreover, hardly logical. It is not clear whether it is the two southern bricks that are compared with the woman, or the bricks to be placed alongside of them on the north (left) side.</p>
