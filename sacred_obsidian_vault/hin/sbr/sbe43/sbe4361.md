 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:1">10:4:1:1</a></font></span>1. When the gods restored the relaxed Pra<i>g</i>âpati, they poured him, as seed, into the fire-pan (ukhâ) as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb<font size="-1" color="green">.</font> In the course of a year they prepared for him this food, to wit, the fire-altar built here, and enclosed it in a body; and, being enclosed in a body, it became the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:2">10:4:1:2</a></font></span>2. In like manner does the Sacrificer now pour his own self (or body), as seed, into the fire-pan as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb. In the course of a year he prepares for it (his self) this food, to wit, the fire-altar here built, and encloses it in a body, and, being enclosed in a body, it becomes the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:3">10:4:1:3</a></font></span>3. He places him (the Ukhya Agni, on the fire-altar) with 'Vausha<i>t</i> <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' for 'vauk' is he (Agni),</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a></p>  
 <p>and 'sha<i>t</i> (six)' is this six-layered food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to this body, for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:4">10:4:1:4</a></font></span>4. Now that Arka <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">1</font></a> (flame) is this very fire which they bring here; and the Kya <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">1</font></a> is this his food, to wit, the fire-altar built here: that (combined) makes the Arkya <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">2</font></a> in respect of the Ya<i>g</i>us. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this vrata <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">3</font></a> (rite) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata (sâman) in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food,--that (combined) makes the Uktha (<i>s</i>astra, recitation) <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">4</font></a> in respect of the <i>Ri</i>k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:5">10:4:1:5</a></font></span>5. Now Indra and Agni were created as the Brahman (priesthood) and the Kshatra (nobility): the Brahman was Agni and the Kshatra Indra. When created, the two were separate. They spake, 'Whilst being thus, we shall be unable to produce creatures (people): let us both become one form!' The two became one form.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:6">10:4:1:6</a></font></span>6. Now those two, Indra and Agni, are the same as these two, to wit, the gold plate and the (gold) man <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">5</font></a>: Indra is the gold plate, and Agni the man.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> They are made of gold: gold means light, and Indra and Agni are the light; gold means immortal life, and Indra and Agni mean immortal life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:7">10:4:1:7</a></font></span>7. It is these two, Indra and Agni, that they build up. Whatever is of brick that is Agni: whence they bake that (part) by fire, and all that is baked by fire is Agni. And what filling of earth there is (in the altar) that. is Indra: whence they do not bake that (part) by fire, lest it should be Agni, and not Indra. Thus it is these two, Indra and Agni, that are built up.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:8">10:4:1:8</a></font></span>8. And the two become that one form, to wit, the fire which is placed on the built (altar), and hence those two, by means of that form, produce creatures. Now Agni, indeed, is this single brick <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and into this the whole Agni passes: this, indeed, is the perfection of bricks,--it is that one syllable (akshara) 'vauk,' it is this into which the whole Agni passes, and which is the perfection of syllables.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:9">10:4:1:9</a></font></span>9. It is this that the <i>Ri</i>shi saw when he said, 'I praise what hath been and what will be, the Great Brahman, the one Akshara,--the manifold Brahman, the one Akshara; for, indeed, all the gods, all beings pass into that Akshara (imperishable</p>

 <p>element <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">1</font></a>): it is both the Brahman and the Kshatra; and the Brahman is Agni, and the Kshatra Indra; and the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i> (all the gods) are Indra and Agni.<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> But the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i> (the All-gods) are also the peasantry: hence it is Priesthood, Nobility, and Peasantry.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:10">10:4:1:10</a></font></span>10. And, indeed, <i>S</i>yâpar<i>n</i>a Sâyakâyana, knowing this, once said, 'If this my sacrificial performance were complete, my own race would become the kings (nobles), Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and peasants of the Salvas; but even by that much of my work which has been completed <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">2</font></a> my race will surpass the Salvas in both ways;'--for this (Agni, the fire-altar), indeed, is (social) eminence and fame, and an eater of food <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:11">10:4:1:11</a></font></span>11. And regarding this, Sâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya, having instructed Vâmakakshâya<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">1</font></a>, said, 'Thou wilt become eminent, famous, and an eater of food (rich);' and, indeed, he who knows this becomes eminent, famous, and an eater of food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:12">10:4:1:12</a></font></span>12. And this Agni is no other than Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 346</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The gods, having restored this Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati, in the course of a year prepared this food for him, to wit, this Mahâvratîya cup of Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:13">10:4:1:13</a></font></span>13. The Adhvaryu draws it by means of a cup, and inasmuch as he draws (grah) it<font size="-1" color="green">,</font> it is (called) a draught (graha, cup of Soma). The Udgât<i>ri</i> (chanter), by the Mahâvrata (sâman), puts flavour (vital sap) into it; and the Mahâvrata (sâman) being (composed of) all those (five) sâmans, he thus puts flavour into it by means of all sâmans (hymn-tunes). The Hot<i>ri</i> puts flavour into it by means of the Great Recitation; and the Great Recitation being (composed of) all those <i>Ri</i>k-verses: he thus puts flavour into it by all the <i>Ri</i>k-verses.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:14">10:4:1:14</a></font></span>14. And when they chant the hymn, and he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) afterwards recites (the <i>s</i>astra) <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he (the Adhvaryu) offers that (cup of Soma) to him (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) as the Vasha<i>t</i>-call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and 'sha<i>t</i>' this sixfold food <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_672"><font size="1">2</font></a>: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to his body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:15">10:4:1:15</a></font></span>15. Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar</p>

 <p>built here; and the Kya is this his food, to wit, the Mahâvratîya-graha: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya<i>g</i>us. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the <i>Ri</i>k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:16">10:4:1:16</a></font></span>16. And this Agni is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the year <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">1</font></a>: the Sâvitra (oblations) are one half thereof, and the Vai<i>s</i>va-karma<i>n</i>a (oblations) <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">2</font></a> the (other) half; the Sâvitra are eight digits (kalâ <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_675"><font size="1">3</font></a>) thereof, and the Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (the other) eight; and that which is performed between them is the seventeenfold Pra<i>g</i>âpati. Now what a digit is to men that a syllable (akshara) is to the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:17">10:4:1:17</a></font></span>17. And 'loma (hair)' is two syllables, 'tvak <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">4</font></a> (skin)' two, 'as<i>ri</i>k (blood)' two, 'medas (fat)' two, 'mâ<i>m</i>sam (flesh)' two, 'snâva (sinew)' two, 'asthi (bone)' two, 'ma<i>g</i><i>g</i>â (marrow) <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">5</font></a>' two,--that makes sixteen digits; and the vital air which circulates therein, is the seventeenfold Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:18">10:4:1:18</a></font></span>18. These sixteen digits convey the food to that vital air; and when they take to conveying no food to it, then it consumes them and departs (from the body): hence he who is hungry here, feels very</p>

 <p>restless, consumed as he is by his vital airs; and hence he who suffers from fever becomes very thin, for he is consumed by his vital airs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:19">10:4:1:19</a></font></span>19. Now for that seventeenfold Pra<i>g</i>âpati they prepared this seventeenfold food, the Soma-sacrifice: those sixteen digits of his are these sixteen officiating priests,--one should not, therefore, take a seventeenth priest <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">1</font></a> lest one should do what is excessive;--and what vital sap there is here--the oblations that are offered--that is the seventeenfold food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:20">10:4:1:20</a></font></span>20. And when they chant the hymn, and when he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) afterwards recites (the <i>s</i>astra), he (the Adhvaryu) offers to him that food as the Vasha<i>t</i>-call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>sha<i>t</i>' this sixfold food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to his body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:21">10:4:1:21</a></font></span>21. Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar built here; and the Kya is this his food, to wit, the Soma-sacrifice: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya<i>g</i>us. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the <i>Ri</i>k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. With this food he went upwards; and he who</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a></p>  
 <p>went upwards is yonder sun, and that food wherewith he went up is that moon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:22">10:4:1:22</a></font></span>22. He who shines yonder is indeed that Arka (flame), and that moon is his food, the Kya: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya<i>g</i>us. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the <i>Ri</i>k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. Thus much as to the deity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:1:23">10:4:1:23</a></font></span>23. Now as to the body. The Arka (flame), doubtless, is the breath (vital air), and the Kya is its food: that makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya<i>g</i>us. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the <i>Ri</i>k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. And, indeed, that (Agni) is that (sun) as to the deity, and this (breath) as to the body.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_669"></a><a href="sbe4361.htm#fr_680">344:3</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a takes this as intended to explain the 'in both' ways' of the quotation, viz. in regard to '<i>s</i>rî' (social distinction) on the one hand, and to 'ya<i>s</i>as' (fame) and food (material prosperity) on the other. There is, however, nothing in the text to favour any such grouping of the distinctive objects of aspiration associated with the three classes (var<i>n</i>atrayâtmakatvam upa<i>g</i>ivya karma<i>n</i>a<i>h</i>, <i>s</i>rîya<i>s</i>o<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nnâdalaksha<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> phalam. Sâya<i>n</i>a), or with men generally (cf. Aitareyâr. I, 4, 2, 10). Perhaps it means both in an intellectual and material point of view. The Syâpar<i>n</i>as seem to have been a rather self-assertive family of priests. The Aitareya Brâhma<i>n</i>a tells the following story about them (VII, 27):--Vi<i>s</i>vantara Saushadmana, setting aside the <i>S</i>yâpar<i>n</i>as, got up a sacrifice without them. The Syâpar<i>n</i>as, becoming aware of this, came to the sacrifice and sat them down inside the sacrificial ground. On seeing them, Vi<i>s</i>vantara said, 'There sit those doers of evil deeds, those speakers of foul language, the Syâpar<i>n</i>as: turn them out let them not sit inside my sacrificial ground!'--'So be it!' they said, and <a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a> turned them out. In being turned out, they cried aloud, 'At a sacrifice of <i>G</i>aname<i>g</i>aya, son of Parikshit, performed without the Ka<i>s</i>yapas, the Asitam<i>ri</i>gas from amongst the Ka<i>s</i>yapas won the Soma-drink from the Bhûtavîras (who were officiating). In them they had heroic men on their side: what hero is there amongst us who will win that Soma-drink?'--'Here is that hero of yours,' said Râma Mârgaveya. Râma Mârgaveya was a <i>S</i>yâpar<i>n</i>îya, learned in sacred lore. When they rose to leave, he said, 'O king, will they turn out of the sacrificial ground even one so learned as me?'--'Whoever thou art, what knowest thou, vile Brâhman?'--'When the gods turned Indra away because he had outraged Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'s son Vi<i>s</i>varûpa, and laid low V<i>ri</i>tra, and thrown devotees before the jackals, and slain the Arurmaghas, and retorted on B<i>ri</i>haspati (the teacher of the gods)--then Indra was deprived of the Soma-cup; and along with him the Kshatriyas were deprived of the Soma-cup. By stealing the Soma from Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, Indra obtained a share in the Soma-cup, but to this day the Kshatriyas are deprived of the Soma-cup: how can they turn out from the sacrificial ground one who knows how the Kshatriya race can be put in possession of the Soma-cup from which they are deprived?'--'Knowest thou (how to procure) that drink, O Brâhman?'--'I know it indeed.'--'Tell us then, O Brahman?'--'To thee, O king, I will tell it,' he said. Ultimately the <i>S</i>yâpar<i>n</i>as are reinstated in their sacrificial duties. Cf. R. Roth, Zur Litteratur and Geschichte des Weda, p. 118. At VI, 2, I, 39, Syâpar<i>n</i>a Sâyakâyana was stated to have been the last who was in the habit of immolating five victims instead of two, as became afterwards the custom.</p>
