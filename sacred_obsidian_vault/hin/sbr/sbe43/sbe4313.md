He then lays down the <i>Kh</i>andasyâ <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">2</font></a> (metres’ bricks). Now the metres are cattle, and the middle-most layer is the air: he thus places cattle in the air, whence cattle have their abode in the air.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:2">8:3:3:2</a></font></span>2. And, again, as to why he lays down <i>Kh</i>andasyâs,--the metres are cattle, and cattle are food, and the middlemost layer is the middle (of Agni, the altar): he thus places food in the middle (of Agni's body).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:3">8:3:3:3</a></font></span>3. He lays them down by twelves,--for the <i>G</i>agatî consists of twelve syllables, and the <i>G</i>agatî is cattle, and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places cattle in the air, whence cattle have their abode in the air.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:4">8:3:3:4</a></font></span>4. And, again, why (he lays them down) by twelves,--the <i>G</i>agatî consists of twelve syllables, and the <i>G</i>agatî is cattle, and cattle is food, and the middlemost layer is the middle: he thus places food in the middle. He places them so as not to be separated from the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital airs subsequently (to them he places them): he thus bestows food after (bestowing) the vital airs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:5">8:3:3:5</a></font></span>5. [He lays down the right set, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 18], 'The metre Measure;'--the measure (mâ), doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for this world is, as it were, measured (mita);--'the metre Fore-measure!'--the fore-measure (pramâ), doubtless, is the air-world, for the air-world is, as it were, measured forward from this world;--'The metre Countermeasure,'--the counter-measure (pratimâ), doubtless, is yonder (heavenly) world, for yonder world is, as it were, counter-measured <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the air;--'The metre Asrîvayas,'--'asrîvayas,' doubtless, is food: whatever food there is in these worlds that is 'asrîvayas.' Or, whatever food (anna) flows (sravati) from these</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>worlds that is 'asrîvayas.' Hereafter, now, he puts down only defined metres.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:6">8:3:3:6</a></font></span>6. 'The Paṅkti metre! the Ush<i>n</i>ih metre! the B<i>ri</i>hatî metre! the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre! the Virâ<i>g</i> metre! the Gâyatrî metre! the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre! the <i>G</i>agatî metre!' these eight defined metres, including the Virâ<i>g</i>, he puts down.--[The back set, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 19], 'The metre Earth! the metre Air! the metre Heaven! the metre Years! the metre Stars! the metre Speech! the metre Mind! the metre Husbandry! the metre Gold! the metre Cow! the metre Goat! the metre Horse!' he thus puts down those metres which are sacred to those particular deities.--[The left set, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 20], 'The deity Fire! the deity Wind! the deity Sun! the deity Moon! the deity Vasava<i>h</i>! the deity Rudrâ<i>h</i>! the deity Âdityâ<i>h</i>! the deity Maruta<i>h</i>! the deity Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i>! the deity B<i>ri</i>haspati! the deity Indra! the deity Varu<i>n</i>a!'--these deities, doubtless, are metres: it is these he thus lays down.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:7">8:3:3:7</a></font></span>7. He lays down both defined and undefined (metres). Were he to lay down such as are all defined, then the food would have an end, it would fail; and (were he to lay down) such as are all undefined, then the food would be invisible, and one would not see it at all. He lays down both defined and undefined ones: hence the defined (certain) food which is eaten does not fail.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:8">8:3:3:8</a></font></span>8. These then are those (sets of) twelve he lays down,--that makes thirty-six, and the B<i>ri</i>hatî consists of thirty-six syllables: this is that same B<i>ri</i>hatî, the air, which the gods then saw as a third</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>layer. In that (b<i>ri</i>hatî set of bricks) the gods come last (or, are highest).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:9">8:3:3:9</a></font></span>9. And, again, as to why he lays down these bricks. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati became relaxed, all living beings went from him in all directions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:10">8:3:3:10</a></font></span>10. Now that same Pra<i>g</i>âpati who became relaxed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and those living beings which went from him are these bricks: hence when he lays down these (bricks), he thereby puts back into him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati-Agni) those same living beings which went from him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:11">8:3:3:11</a></font></span>11. Now when he first lays down ten (Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts), they are the moon. There are ten of these,--the Virâ<i>g</i>; consists of ten syllables, and the Virâ<i>g</i> is food, and the moon is food. And when subsequently he lays down thirty-six (<i>Kh</i>andasyâs), they are the half-months and months--twenty-four half-months and twelve months: the moon, doubtless, is the year, and all living beings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:3:3:12">8:3:3:12</a></font></span>12. And when the gods restored him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati-Agni), they put all those living beings inside him, and in like manner does this one now put them therein. He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal (bricks): he thus establishes all living beings in the seasons.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="sbe4313.htm#fr_121">51:2</a> The thirty-six <i>Kh</i>andasyâ bricks are laid down, in three sets of twelve each, along the edge of the body of the altar where the two wings and the tail join it; six bricks being placed on each side of the respective spine. At the back the bricks are not, however, placed close to the edge separating the body from the tail, but sufficient space is left (a foot wide) for another set of bricks to be laid down behind the <i>Kh</i>andasyâs.</p>
