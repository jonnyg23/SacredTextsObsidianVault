But, indeed, distinction, royal sway, departs from him who performs the horse-sacrifice; and when a man attains to distinction, the lute is played to him. Two Brâhma<i>n</i>ical lute-players sing (and play) for a year; for that--to wit, the lute--is a form (attribute) of distinction: it is distinction they thus confer upon him.</p>

Concerning this they say, ‘Were both to be Brâhma<i>n</i>as who sing, noble rank (or political power) would depart from him; for he--to wit, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a--is a form of the priestly office; and the nobility takes no delight in the priestly office (or priesthood).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:1:5:3">13:1:5:3</a></font></span>3. ‘And were both to be Râ<i>g</i>anyas (nobles), spiritual lustre would depart from him; for he--to wit, the Râ<i>g</i>anya--is a form of noble rank, and spiritual lustre takes no delight in noble rank.' One of those who sing is a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and the other a Râ<i>g</i>anya; for the Brâhma<i>n</i>a means priestly office, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya noble rank: thus his distinction (social position) comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:1:5:4">13:1:5:4</a></font></span>4. Concerning this they say, ‘Were both to sing by day, his distinction would be apt to fall away from him: for that--to wit, the day--is a form of the priestly dignity; and when the king chooses he may oppress (despoil) the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, but he will fare the worse (or, become the poorer) for it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:1:5:5">13:1:5:5</a></font></span>5. 'And if both (were to sing) at night, spiritual lustre would fall away from him; for that--to wit, the night--is a form of the nobility, and spiritual lustre takes no delight in the nobility.' The Brâhma<i>n</i>a sings by day <a name="fr_720"></a><a href="#fn_716"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya at night <a name="fr_721"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and thus, indeed, his distinction comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility <a name="fr_722"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Brâhma<i>n</i>a sings <a name="fr_723"></a><a href="#fn_719"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a belongs the fulfilment of wishes <a name="fr_724"></a><a href="sbe44079.htm#fn_720"><font size="1">2</font></a>: it is with the fulfilment of wishes he (the Brâhma<i>n</i>a) thus endows him (the Sacrificer). 'Such war he waged,--such battle he won!' such (are the topics about which) the Râ<i>g</i>anya sings; for the battle is the Râ<i>g</i>anya's strength: it is with strength he thus endows him. Three stanzas the one sings, and three stanzas the other, they amount to six,--six seasons make up a year: he thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the seasons, in the year. To both of them he presents a hundred; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is vitality and energy, vital power, he confers upon him.</p>
