 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:1">14:2:1:1</a></font></span>1. He now offers (the first of) the two Rauhi<i>n</i>a (cakes) <a name="fr_1256"></a><a href="#fn_1248"><font size="1">2</font></a>:--(Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVII, 21), 'May the day</p>

 <p>be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!' with this text both (cakes are offered) in the morning;--'May the night be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!' with this text both (cakes are offered) in the evening.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:2">14:2:1:2</a></font></span>2. And as to why he offers two Rauhi<i>n</i>a (cakes),--the two Rauhi<i>n</i>as doubtless are Agni and Âditya (the sun), for by means of these two deities sacrificers ascend (ruh) to heaven.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:3">14:2:1:3</a></font></span>3. And, indeed, the Rauhi<i>n</i>as are also day and night, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by the day and the night, whence he is encompassed by the day and the night.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:4">14:2:1:4</a></font></span>4. And, indeed, the Rauhi<i>n</i>as are also these two</p>  
 <p><a name="page_474"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 474</font></a></p>  
 <p>worlds, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by these two worlds, whence he is encompassed by these two worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:5">14:2:1:5</a></font></span>5. And, indeed, the Rauhi<i>n</i>as are also the two eyes, and the Pravargya is the head: he thus places the eye in the head.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:6">14:2:1:6</a></font></span>6. He now takes a rope, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 1), 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, I take thee, with the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan: Aditi's <a name="fr_1257"></a><a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">1</font></a> zone thou art;'--the mystic import of this is the same as before <a name="fr_1258"></a><a href="#fn_1250"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:7">14:2:1:7</a></font></span>7. He then calls the cow, whilst stepping behind the Gârhapatya (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 2), 'I<i>d</i>â, come hither! Aditi, come hither! Sarasvatî, come hither!' for the cow is I<i>d</i>â, and the cow is Aditi, and the cow is Sarasvatî. And he also calls her by her (real) name, with these (formulas), 'N.N. <a name="fr_1259"></a><a href="#fn_1251"><font size="1">3</font></a>, come hither!' thus thrice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:8">14:2:1:8</a></font></span>8. When she comes, he lays (the rope) round her (horns), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 3), 'Aditi's zone thou art, Indrâ<i>n</i>î's head-band;'--for Indrâ<i>n</i>î is Indra's beloved wife, and she has a most variegated head-band: 'that thou art' he thereby means to say, and that he indeed thereby makes it to be.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:9">14:2:1:9</a></font></span>9. He then lets the calf to it (to suck), with, 'Pûshan thou art,'--Pûshan, doubtless, is he that blows here (the wind), for that one supports <a name="fr_1260"></a><a href="#fn_1252"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (push) all this (universe); and the Pravargya also is that (wind): it is him he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Pûshan thou art.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:10">14:2:1:10</a></font></span>10. He then leads it (the calf) away <a name="fr_1261"></a><a href="#fn_1253"><font size="1">1</font></a> with, 'Afford (milk) for the Gharma!' for the Gharma, doubtless, is that fluid which this (cow) lets flow: he thus means to say thereby, 'Allow her a share!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:11">14:2:1:11</a></font></span>11. He then causes it to flow into the milking-bowl, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX XVIII, 4), 'Flow for the A<i>s</i>vins!'--with regard to the A<i>s</i>vins he thus says this, for it was the A<i>s</i>vins who restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for the A<i>s</i>vins!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:12">14:2:1:12</a></font></span>12, 'Flow for Sarasvatî!'--Sarasvatî, doubtless, is Speech, and with speech the A<i>s</i>vins then restored the head of the Sacrifice: it is those (A<i>s</i>vins) he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for Sarasvatî!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:13">14:2:1:13</a></font></span>13. 'Flow for Indra!'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and it was indeed by him who is the deity of the sacrifice that the A<i>s</i>vins then restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for Indra!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:14">14:2:1:14</a></font></span>14. The (spilt) drops he then consecrates with, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice, and therefore he says, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>

He then touches her udder <a name="fr_1262"></a><a href="#fn_1254"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 5; <i>Ri</i>g-v. I, 164, 49), 'This ever-flowing, grateful udder of thine,'--that is to say, 'This udder of thine placed in secret <a name="fr_1263"></a><a href="#fn_1255"><font size="1">2</font></a>;'--'treasure-giving, wealth-granting, bountiful,'--that is to say, 'which is a giver of treasures, a granter of wealth, and precious;'--'whereby thou furtherest all desirable things,'--that is to say, 'whereby thou supportest all the gods and all creatures;'--'O Sarasvatî, move that hither for us to suck,'--Sarasvatî, doubtless, is Speech, and so is this (cow) which yields the Gharma milk; and Speech is worship: thus he means to say, 'Grant us worship whereby we may please the gods.' He then steps up to the site of the Gârhapatya with, 'I pass along the wide aerial realm,'--the mystic import of this is the same as before <a name="fr_1264"></a><a href="#fn_1256"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:16">14:2:1:16</a></font></span>16. He then takes the two lifting-sticks <a name="fr_1265"></a><a href="#fn_1257"><font size="1">4</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 6), 'The Gâyatrî metre thou art,--the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre thou art,'--he thus takes them with both the Gâyatrî and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metres;--'with heaven and earth I encompass thee,'--for the two lifting-sticks are indeed these two, heaven and earth; and the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun within these two, heaven and earth. Thereupon (having lifted up the pot) he sweeps it clean with a branch of reed grass: the mystic import of this is the same as before.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:17">14:2:1:17</a></font></span>17. He then puts it on the 'supporting' tray <a name="fr_1266"></a><a href="#fn_1258"><font size="1">1</font></a> with, 'By the air I support thee,'--for the 'supporting' tray is the air, since everything here is supported by the air; and the 'supporting' tray also is the belly, for all food and drink here is supported (held) by the belly: therefore he says, 'By the air I support thee.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:18">14:2:1:18</a></font></span>18. He then pours in the goat's milk <a name="fr_1267"></a><a href="#fn_1259"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for that (Mahâvîra pot) when heated, becomes glowing: he thus soothes it, and when soothed he pours the cow's milk into it--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:19">14:2:1:19</a></font></span>19. With, 'O Indra and ye A<i>s</i>vins!'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice; and 'Ye A<i>s</i>vins' he says, because the A<i>s</i>vins at that time restored the head of the sacrifice, and it is them he thus pleases: therefore he says, 'O Indra and ye A<i>s</i>vins!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:20">14:2:1:20</a></font></span>20. 'Of bees’ honey'--this is indeed honey;--'drink ye the Gharma (hot draught),'--that is to say, drink ye the liquor;'--'ye true ones,'--those (deities) are indeed true (vasu), for it is</p>

 <p><a name="page_478"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 478</font></a></p>  
 <p>they that maintain (vâsaya) all this (universe);--'worship ye, vâ<i>t</i>!' thus this comes to be for him as if it were offered with the Vasha<i>t</i>-call.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:21">14:2:1:21</a></font></span>21. 'Hail to Sûrya's ray, the rain-winner <a name="fr_1268"></a><a href="#fn_1260"><font size="1">1</font></a>!'--for one of the sun's rays is called 'rain-winner,' whereby he supports all these creatures: it is that one he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Hail to Sûrya's ray, the rain-winner!' The call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before <a name="fr_1269"></a><a href="#fn_1261"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:1:22">14:2:1:22</a></font></span>22. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation <a name="fr_1270"></a><a href="#fn_1262"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1248"></a><a href="sbe44121.htm#fr_1256">472:2</a> According to the Sûtras and the Taitt. Âr., the southern cake <a name="page_473"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 473</font></a> is offered at this juncture of the performance, whilst the northern one is offered later on (see <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41">XIV, 2, 2, 41</a>). For both cakes one and the same text is used, viz. the first of the two here mentioned at the morning performance, whilst the second is used at the afternoon performance. The cakes, being one-kapâla ones (the two 'rauhi<i>n</i>ahavanî' ladles serving as kapâlas), must be offered entire. Cf. Kâty. XXVI, 4, 14; 6, 18; Âpast. XV, 10, 1; 11, 5; 12, 7; Taitt. Âr. IV, 10, 4. Though our Brâhma<i>n</i>a expresses itself in a rather peculiar way, its statement, here and at <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41">XIV, 2, 2, 41</a>, is perhaps meant to imply the same mode of procedure. If this is the case, the two paragraphs would mean,--at this juncture of the two performances he offers the two southern (northern, at <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41">XIV, 2, 2, 41</a>) cakes,--the two cakes (the southern and the northern one) of the morning performance requiring the first, and those of the afternoon performance the second, text. It is not impossible, however, that the author intends a different mode of procedure or wishes to leave it purposely vague. If we were to read 'rauhi<i>n</i>am' for 'rauhi<i>n</i>au,' the text would be more in accordance with the practice prescribed in the Sûtras. Cf. also Mahîdh. (on Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVII, 21)--where read 'rauhi<i>n</i>au' instead of 'pravargyau'--who adopts the procedure here explained.</p>
