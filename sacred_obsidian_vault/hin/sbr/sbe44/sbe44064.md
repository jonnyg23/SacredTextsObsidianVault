If, however, the Brahman should not know (these formulas and oblations), any one who knows them may perform them; but (let him do so) after applying for leave to the Brahman, and with his permission. Now as to the meaning of these (formulas). Vasish<i>th</i>a knew the Virâ<i>g</i> <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">1</font></a>: Indra coveted it.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:6:1:41">12:6:1:41</a></font></span>41. And Indra then taught the <i>Ri</i>shi this expiation from the Agnihotra up to the Great Litany. And formerly, indeed, the Vasish<i>th</i>as alone knew these utterances, whence formerly only one of the Vasish<i>th</i>a family became Brahman; but since nowadays anybody (may) study them, anybody (may) now become Brahman <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">2</font></a>.
