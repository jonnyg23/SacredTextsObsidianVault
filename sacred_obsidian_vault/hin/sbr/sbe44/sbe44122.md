And when the Hot<i>ri</i> recites this (verse), 'Let Brahma<i>n</i>aspati go forward, let the goddess Sûn<i>ri</i>tâ go forward,'--the Adhvaryu, stepping forward, makes offering (by muttering) the wind-names. For at this time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Svâhâ-call before (its being taken to) the Âhavanîya, being thus offered they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it with the Svâhâ-call before</p>

XXXVIII, 7,] 'To the wind Ocean (I offer) thee, hail!'--the (aerial) ocean (samudra) indeed is he who blows here, for from out of that ocean all the gods and all the beings issue forth (samud-dru): it is to him (Vâyu, the wind) he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Ocean (I consecrate) thee, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:3">14:2:2:3</a></font></span>3. 'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!'--the flood (sarira) indeed is he who blows here, for from out of that flood all the gods and all the creatures come forth together (saha irate): it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:4">14:2:2:4</a></font></span>4. 'To the wind Unassailable--thee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--thee, hail!'--unassailable and irresistible indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Unassailable--thee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--thee, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:5">14:2:2:5</a></font></span>5. 'To the wind Favourable--thee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--thee, hail!'--favourable and an ogress-ridder indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Favourable--thee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--thee, hail!'</p>

 <p><a name="page_480"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 480</font></a></p>  
 <p>moreover, it is thereby made to be like the morning Soma-pressing, and the midday-pressing <a name="fr_1271"></a><a href="#fn_1263"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

'To Indra, accompanied by the Âdityas,--thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Indra--thee;' and when he says, 'accompanied by the Âdityas,' thereby he allows a share to the Âdityas along with Indra; and, moreover, it is made like the evening-pressing <a name="fr_1272"></a><a href="#fn_1263"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

'To Indra, the slayer of the evil-minded,--thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Indra--thee;' and as to his saying, 'to the slayer of the evil-minded,' the evil-minded one being an enemy, he thereby means to say, 'To Indra, the slayer of enemies,--thee!' This is his (Indra's) special share: even as there is a share for a chief <a name="fr_1273"></a><a href="#fn_1264"><font size="1">2</font></a>, so is this his (share) apart from the (other) gods.</p>

XXXVIII, 9,] 'To Yama, accompanied by the Aṅgiras and the Fathers,--thee, hail!'--Yama indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Yama--thee;' and as to his saying, 'accompanied by the Aṅgiras and the Fathers,'--when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers,--the Fathers being three in number <a name="fr_1274"></a><a href="#fn_1265"><font size="1">1</font></a>: thus it is to these he thereby allows a share along (with Yama).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:12">14:2:2:12</a></font></span>12. These are twelve names,--twelve months are in a year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and therefore there are twelve (names).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:13">14:2:2:13</a></font></span>13. He then pours (the spilt milk and ghee) from the tray into the Mahâvîra (pot) with, 'Hail to the Gharma!'--the Gharma (hot draught) is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'Hail to the Gharma!'--the call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1266"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:14">14:2:2:14</a></font></span>14. When it has been poured in, he mutters, 'Hail, the Gharma to the Fathers!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed</p>

 <p><a name="page_482"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 482</font></a></p>  
 <p>away, and went to the Fathers--the Fathers being three in number: it is these he thus pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:15">14:2:2:15</a></font></span>15. He recites no anuvâkyâ (invitatory) formula, for once for all the Fathers have passed away: therefore he recites no anuvâkyâ. Having stepped across <a name="fr_1276"></a><a href="#fn_1267"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the Srausha<i>t</i> <a name="fr_1277"></a><a href="#fn_1268"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), 'Pronounce the offering-formula (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) of the Gharma;' and on the Vasha<i>t</i>-call being uttered he offers--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:16">14:2:2:16</a></font></span>16. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 10), 'All regions (hath he worshipped), seated in the south,'--that is to say, 'every region (has he worshipped), seated on the south;'--'all gods hath he worshipped here,'--that is, 'every god has he worshipped here;'--'of the sweet Gharma, consecrated by Svâhâ (hail!), drink ye, O A<i>s</i>vins!'--with regard to the A<i>s</i>vins he says this; for the A<i>s</i>vins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:17">14:2:2:17</a></font></span>17. And, having offered, he (thrice) shakes (the Mahâvîra) upwards, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 11), 'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this sacrifice place thou in heaven!'--for the Gharma (hot milk-draught), the sacrifice, is yonder sun, and he indeed is 'placed' in the heavens, is</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_483"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 483</font></a></p>  
 <p>established in the heavens: it is thus him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this sacrifice place thou in heaven!' On the repetition of the Vasha<i>t</i>, he offers--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:18">14:2:2:18</a></font></span>18. With, 'Hail to Agni, worthy of sacrifice!'--this is in lieu of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (offering), for Agni is the maker of good offering;--'may blessing result from the sacrificial texts!' for by the sacrificial texts that (sun) is established (as the Mahâvîra) in this world: thus it is them he thereby pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:19">14:2:2:19</a></font></span>19. The Brahman (priest) pronounces the anumantra<i>n</i>a (formula of consecration); for the Brahman is the best physician among the officiating priests: thus he heals this sacrifice by means of him who is the best physician among the priests.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:20">14:2:2:20</a></font></span>20. [He does so, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 12.] 'O A<i>s</i>vins, drink ye the Gharma!'--with regard to the A<i>s</i>vins he says this, for the A<i>s</i>vins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:21">14:2:2:21</a></font></span>21. 'The hearty <a name="fr_1278"></a><a href="#fn_1269"><font size="1">1</font></a> one with daily <a name="fr_1279"></a><a href="#fn_1270"><font size="1">2</font></a> favours,'--</p>

 <p>this is indistinct, for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is indistinct (undefined), and the sacrifice is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the sacrifice, he thus heals;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:22">14:2:2:22</a></font></span>22. 'To the web-weaver,'--the web-weaver, doubtless, is he that shines yonder, for he moves along these worlds as if along a web; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'To the web-weaver'--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:23">14:2:2:23</a></font></span>23. 'To Heaven and Earth be reverence!' he thus propitiates heaven and earth, within which everything here is contained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:24">14:2:2:24</a></font></span>24. Thereupon the Sacrificer (mutters),--the Sacrificer being the sacrifice, he thus heals the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:25">14:2:2:25</a></font></span>25. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:26">14:2:2:26</a></font></span>26. 'Heaven and Earth have approved of it <a name="fr_1280"></a><a href="#fn_1271"><font size="1">1</font></a>'--he says this with regard to heaven and earth, within which everything here is contained;--'may gifts accrue here!'--whereby he means to say, 'may there be riches for us here.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:27">14:2:2:27</a></font></span>27. The rising (milk) he then consecrates by the anumantra<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_1281"></a><a href="#fn_1272"><font size="1">2</font></a>, 'For freshness swell thou!'</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> --whereby he means to say, 'For rain . . .;'--'for vigour swell thou!'--he thereby means the vigour, the life-sap, which results from the rain;--'for the Brahman swell thou!'---he thereby means the priesthood;--'for the Kshatra swell thou!'--he thereby means the nobility;--'for Heaven and Earth swell thou!'--he thereby means these two, the heaven and the earth, within which everything here is contained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:28">14:2:2:28</a></font></span>28. When it rises upwards; it rises for (the benefit of) the Sacrificer; when on the front side, it does so for the gods; when on the right (south) side, it does so for the Fathers; when at the back (west side), it does so for the cattle; when on the left (north) side, it does so for (the Sacrificer's) offspring: in any case no fault is incurred by the Sacrificer, for it always rises upwards; and in whatever direction it rises in that it rises. When the drops cease,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:29">14:2:2:29</a></font></span>29. He steps out towards the north-east with, 'A well-supporting support thou art,'--he who shines yonder is indeed a support, for he supports everything here, and by him everything here is supported; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby, pleases, and therefore he says, 'A well-supporting support thou art.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:30">14:2:2:30</a></font></span>30. He then places (the Mahâvîra) on the mound with, 'Incapable of injuring, preserve thou our powers!'--'Not angry <a name="fr_1282"></a><a href="#fn_1273"><font size="1">1</font></a>, preserve our wealth,'</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_486"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 486</font></a></p>  
 <p>is what he thereby means to say;--'preserve the priesthood, preserve the nobility, preserve the people!'--'preserve all that,' is what he thereby means to say.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:31">14:2:2:31</a></font></span>31. He then offers by means of the pieces of (split) wood <a name="fr_1283"></a><a href="#fn_1274"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--the pieces of wood being the vital airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:32">14:2:2:32</a></font></span>32. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVIII, 15), 'Hail to Pûshan, to the cream!'--Pûshan, doubtless, is he who blows here, for he (the wind) supports (push) everything here; and the breath also is that (wind): it is breath he thus bestows upon him, whence he says, 'Hail to Pûshan, to the cream!' The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before. Having offered (by means of the first piece) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick <a name="fr_1284"></a><a href="#fn_1275"><font size="1">2</font></a> (paridhi).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:33">14:2:2:33</a></font></span>33.

 <p>sounding-holes (pratirava), doubtless, are the vital airs, for everything here is pleased (pratirata) with the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the third stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:35">14:2:2:35</a></font></span>35.

'Hail to Heaven and Earth!'--heaven and earth being the out (and in)-breathing and the up-breathing, it is the out and up-breathing he thus bestows upon him.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:37">14:2:2:37</a></font></span>37. 'Hail to the All-gods!'--the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i> being the vital airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him.

And as to why he does not look at it, he does so thinking, 'Lest Rudra should do me harm.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:39">14:2:2:39</a></font></span>39. There are seven of these oblations, for seven in number are these (channels of the) vital airs in the head: it is these he thus bestows upon him.</p>

He then pours (the remaining milk and ghee) from the Mahâvîra into the supporting-tray with, 'Hail, light with light!'--for light indeed the milk was in the one (vessel), and light it is in the other, and these two lights thus unite with each other. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the mystic import of this is the same as before.</p>

 <p>same significance as in the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya. The pieces of wood he throws into the fire. They then proceed with the Upasad. And thus the head of the sacrifice has been set right in the very same manner in which the A<i>s</i>vins then restored it.</p>

One must not perform the Pravargya at one's first Soma-sacrifice, since that would be sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but at the second or the third (Soma-sacrifice); for at first the gods went on worshipping and toiling with the headless sacrifice, therefore (he should do so) at the second or the third (sacrifice). Moreover, it will become heated and ablaze;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:45">14:2:2:45</a></font></span>45. And were he to perform the Pravargya at the first Soma-sacrifice, that (Mahâvîra) of his, when heated and ablaze, would burn up his family and cattle, and also his life, and the Sacrificer would be liable to perish: therefore (let him perform it) at the second or third (sacrifice).</p>

Here now they say, 'Seeing that the Pravargya is headless, whereby, then, does the Agnihotra become possessed of a head for him?' Let him say, 'By the Âhavanîya.'--'How the New and Full-moon sacrifices?' Let him say, 'By the ghee and the cake.'--'How the Seasonal sacrifices?' Let him say, 'By the oblation of clotted curds <a name="fr_1295"></a><a href="#fn_1286"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'--'How the animal sacrifice?'

Well, those two--to wit, the butter-portions--being the eyes of the sacrifice, and so also the two Rauhi<i>n</i>a (cakes)--(it is so) lest he should overtop eye by eye.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:2:2:53">14:2:2:53</a></font></span>53. And, again, they say, 'Seeing that they make offering to the gods by means of wooden (vessels), wherefore does he offer this (Gharma) by means of one made of clay?' When the Sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away and entered the heaven and the earth. Now this (earth) is clay, and yonder (sky) is water; and the Mahâvîra (vessels) are made of clay and water: thus he supplies and completes it (the Pravargya) with that life-sap.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1269"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1278">483:1</a> The exact meaning of 'hârdvânam' is doubtful. Mahîdhara analyses it by 'hârd' = 'h<i>ri</i>d', + 'vâna,' blowing, going, hence 'heart-wafting, going to the heart = dear to the heart.' The St. Petersb. Dict. takes the word to be 'hârd-van,' in the sense of 'herzstärkend' (heart-sustaining, invigorating--? literally, 'possessed of heartiness'). The Taitt. Âr. has 'hârdivânam' instead. The author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a apparently considers the term as obscure, and uses this circumstance for his own symbolic purposes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1270"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1279">483:2</a> Perhaps the author means to characterise also the epithet <a name="page_484"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 484</font></a> 'ahar-diva' (lit. 'day-daily,' cf. Germ. tagtäglich; Aberdonian 'daily-day') as obscure. Mahîdhara takes it to mean 'relating to morning and evening,' as applying to the two performances of the Pravargya,</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1271"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1280">484:1</a> They approved of it by saying 'Well done'; Mahîdh.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1272"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1281">484:2</a> That is, as would seem, he speaks the anumantra<i>n</i>a in order to consecrate whatever milk might have been spilled in bubbling over. Possibly, however, he is to do so at the time when the pot bubbles over (though the 'atha' would rather be out of place in that case). The Taittirîyas differ somewhat on this point of the performance. <a name="page_485"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 485</font></a> After the Gharma-milk has been offered, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> fills the Mahâvîra pot, whilst it is held over the fire, with boiled sour curds and whey (dadhi), whilst muttering the text, 'The A<i>s</i>vins drank the Gharma . . .,' and with the texts; 'For freshness swell thou,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1273"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1282">485:1</a> The author apparently takes 'ameni' in the sense of 'amanyu.' <a name="page_486"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 486</font></a> The St. Petersb. Dict. assigns to it the meaning 'not shooting, incapable of shooting.'</p>

They are dipped into the remains of the hot milk and ghee, the liquid adhering to them being then offered.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1275"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1284">486:2</a> That is, that one of the three fresh sticks enclosing the fire which is laid down first, along the back, or west side, and forms the base of a triangle the apex of which points eastwards. Cf. I, 3, 4, 1 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1276"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1285">486:3</a> This meaning is, by the St. Petersb. Dict., assigned to 'prati-rava' <a name="page_487"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 487</font></a> (otherwise 'echo'), the proper term for the sounding-holes being 'upa-rava,' cf. III, 5, 4, 1, where they are likened to the eyes and ears, as channels of the vital airs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1277"></a><a href="sbe44122.htm#fr_1286">487:1</a> If this rendering (St. Petersb. Dict.) of ûrdhvabarhis' is correct--the term being apparently based on the Fathers’ epithet 'barhishada<i>h</i>,' 'seated on the barhis' (sacrificial grass-covering of the altar-ground)--the force of 'ûrdhva' in the compound is very peculiar. Mahîdhara takes it in the sense of 'having their barhis pointed upwards,' i.e. towards the east (!), the peculiar feature of the barhis in the present case--as far as the participation of the Fathers in the drinking of the Gharma is concerned--being its having the tops of the grass-stalks turned to the east instead of to the south, as is the case in all ceremonies relating to the Fathers. The term 'ûrdhvabarhis' might possibly mean 'having their (special) barhis above,' i.e. in the world of the Fathers, where they would be supposed to partake of the libations of hot milk; whilst yet another (suggested by the next paragraph) would be that of 'having the barhis above them;' which would, however, be more appropriate if the secreting of the stick under the barhis applied to the present, instead of the next one.</p>

Cf. XII, 8, 3, 30. According to Âpast. <i>S</i>r. XV, 11, 12, the priests and the Sacrificer partake of the residue in the order--Hot<i>ri</i>, Adhvaryu, Brahman, Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, Agnîdh, and Sacrificer; or, optionally (ib. 14), only the Sacrificer drinks of it, whilst the priests merely smell it. Cf. the eating of the whey (of clotted curds), II, 4, 4, 25, to which the present eating of the remains is stated, by Kâty.
