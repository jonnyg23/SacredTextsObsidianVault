And when they enter upon the concluding Atirâtra (of the sacrificial session), then, indeed, having gained the Year, they establish themselves in the world of heaven. And were any one to ask them, 'To what deity are ye offering sacrifice this day? what deity are ye? with what deity do ye dwell?' let them name of those (deities) the one to whom they may be nearest (in the performance of the Sattra). And,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a></p>  
 <p>verily, such (sacrificers) are seated (sad) in the good <a name="fr_436"></a><a href="#fn_436"><font size="1">1</font></a> (place), for they are for ever seated among the good deities; and the others are mere partakers in the sacrificial session <a name="fr_437"></a><a href="#fn_437"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and if any one were, during a sacrificial session, to speak evil of such initiates as know this, let them say to him, 'We cut thee off from those deities;' and he becomes the worse, and they themselves become the better for it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:3:23">12:1:3:23</a></font></span>23. That same year contains three great rites (mahâvrata):--the great rite on the <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day, the great rite on the Vishuvat day, and the great rite <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="#fn_438"><font size="1">3</font></a> on the Mahâvrata day itself. Now, those of old used, indeed, to enter upon (perform) that (year's session) with three great rites, and they became glorious, truth-speaking, and faithful to their vow; but if nowadays any (sattrins) were to perform it on this wise, they assuredly would crumble away even as a jar of unbaked clay would crumble away if water were poured into it. They (who do so) perform too much: that (object) of theirs is gained by truth, by toil, by fervid devotion, by faith, by sacrifice, and by oblations.</p>
