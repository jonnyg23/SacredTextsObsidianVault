 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:1">11:4:4:1</a></font></span>1. Now, as to the successful issue of the sacrificial food. Now, indeed, there are six doors to the Brahman <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">3</font></a>--to wit, fire, wind, the waters, the moon, lightning, and the sun.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:2">11:4:4:2</a></font></span>2. He who offers with slightly burnt sacrificial food, enters through the fire-door <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the Brahman;</p>

 <p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a></p>  
 <p>and, by entering through the fire-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:3">11:4:4:3</a></font></span>3. And he who offers with sacrificial food that has fallen (on the ground) enters through the wind-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the wind-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:4">11:4:4:4</a></font></span>4. And he who offers with uncooked sacrificial food, enters through the water-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the water-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:5">11:4:4:5</a></font></span>5. And he who offers with slightly browned sacrificial food, enters through the moon-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the moon-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:6">11:4:4:6</a></font></span>6. And he who offers with browned sacrificial food, enters through the lightning-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the lightning-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:7">11:4:4:7</a></font></span>7. And he who offers with well-cooked sacrificial food, enters through the sun-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the sun-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman. This, then, is the successful issue of the sacrificial food, and, verily, whosoever thus knows this to be the successful issue of the sacrificial food, by him offering is made with wholly successful sacrificial food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:8">11:4:4:8</a></font></span>8. Then, as to the successful issue of the sacrifice. Now, whatever part of the sacrifice is incomplete</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (nyûna) that part of it is productive for him <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and what is redundant in it that is favourable to cattle; and what is broken (disconnected) <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">2</font></a> in it that makes for prosperity; and what is perfect in it that is conducive to heaven.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:9">11:4:4:9</a></font></span>9. And if he think, 'There has been that which was incomplete in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is productive for me: I shall have offspring produced (in men and cattle).'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:10">11:4:4:10</a></font></span>10. And if he think, 'There has been that which was redundant in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is favourable to cattle for me: I shall become possessed of cattle.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:11">11:4:4:11</a></font></span>11. And if he think, 'There has been that which was disconnected in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That makes for my prosperity: Prosperity, surrounded by splendour, fame and holy lustre, will accrue to me.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:4:12">11:4:4:12</a></font></span>12. And if he think, 'There has been that which was perfect in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is conducive to heaven for me: I shall become one of those in the heavenly world.' This then is the successful issue of the sacrifice; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this to be the successful issue of the sacrifice, by him offering is made by a wholly successful sacrifice.</p>
