Of old, indeed, they were wont to seize this victim as one dedicated to Savit<i>ri</i>, but now they seize it as one dedicated to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, saying, 'Savit<i>ri</i>, in truth, is the same as Pra<i>g</i>âpati.' It is therefore after having thrown together the (sacrificial) fires that they ought to perform this (animal) sacrifice on the G<i>ri</i>hapati's own fires, thinking, 'May we also have a share in this tail (of the. victim) wherewith they are now making offering together to the wives</p>
