Even as some of the havis (offering-material) may be spilled before it is offered, so also (part) of the victim is here spilled in that they let loose the sprinkled (horse) before it is slain. When he offers the Stokîyâs (oblations of drops), he offers that (horse) as a complete offering <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">1</font></a>--so as to make good any spilling <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for unspilled is any (part) of the offered (material) that is spilled. A thousand (oblations of drops) he offers for the obtainment of the heavenly world, for the heavenly world is equal in extent to a thousand.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:1:3:2">13:1:3:2</a></font></span>2. Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offer measured (a specified number of oblations), he would gain for himself something limited:' he offers unspecified (oblations) for the obtainment of the unlimited. And indeed Pra<i>g</i>âpati spake, 'Verily, upon the oblations of drops I establish the A<i>s</i>vamedha, and by it, when established, I pass upward from hence.'</p>

XXII, 6,] 'To Agni, hail!'--to Agni he thus offers it (the horse <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">3</font></a>);--'to Soma, hail!'--to Soma he thus offers it;--'to the joy of the waters, hail!'--to the waters he thus offers it;--'to Savit<i>ri</i>, hail!'--to Savit<i>ri</i></p>

 <p>he thus offers it;--'to Vâyu, hail!'--to Vâyu (the wind) he thus offers it;--'to Vish<i>n</i>u, hail!'--to Vish<i>n</i>u he thus offers it to;--'Indra, hail!'--to Indra he thus offers it;--'to B<i>ri</i>haspati, hail!'--to B<i>ri</i>haspati he thus offers it;--'to Mitra, hail!'--to Mitra he thus offers it;--'to Varu<i>n</i>a, hail!'--to Varu<i>n</i>a he thus offers it:--so many, doubtless, are all the gods: it is to them he offers it. He offers them straight away <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">1</font></a> for the obtainment of the heavenly world, for straight away, as it were, is the heavenly world.</p>

And this <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">4</font></a> indeed he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) has declared to be the perfection of the sacrifice, so as to prevent falling away (spilling), for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material).</p>

 <p>victim is here spilled in that they let loose the sprinkled (horse) before it is slaughtered. When he offers (the oblations relating to) the Forms <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">1</font></a> (rûpa), he offers that (horse) as one that is wholly offered, so as to make good any spilling; for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:1:3:6">13:1:3:6</a></font></span>6. Concerning this they say, 'The Forms are no offering: they should not be offered.' But, indeed, they also say, 'Therein assuredly the horse-sacrifice becomes complete that he performs (the oblations relating to) the Forms: they should certainly be offered.' And, indeed, one puts that (Sacrificer) out of his resting-place, and raises a rival for him when one offers for him oblations elsewhere than in the fire <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">1</font></a>, where there is no resting-place.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:1:3:7">13:1:3:7</a></font></span>7. Prior to the (first) oblation to Savit<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he (the Adhvaryu) offers, once only, (the oblations relating to) the Forms <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the Âhavanîya, whilst going rapidly over (the formulas): he thus offers the oblations at his (the Sacrificer's) resting-place, and raises no rival for him. He offers at each opening of sacrifice <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_709"><font size="1">4</font></a>, for the continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:1:3:8">13:1:3:8</a></font></span>8. Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offer</p>

 <p>at each opening of sacrifice, he would be deprived of his cattle, and would become poorer.' They should be performed once only: thus he is not deprived of his cattle, and does not become poorer. Forty-eight (oblations) he offers;--the <i>G</i>agatî consists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of <i>G</i>âgata (movable) nature: by means of the <i>G</i>agatî he (the Adhvaryu) thus wins cattle for him (the Sacrificer). One additional (oblation) he offers, whence one man is apt to thrive amongst (many) creatures (or subjects).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_700"></a><a href="sbe44076.htm#fr_704">281:1</a> According to Kâty. XX, 2, 3-5, he offers either a thousand oblations, or as many as he can offer till the dripping of the water from the horse has ceased. For every ten oblations he uses the formulas here given, after which he begins again from the beginning. The 'straight on' apparently means that he is neither to break the order of the deities, nor to offer more than one oblation at a time to the same deity.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_704"></a><a href="sbe44076.htm#fr_708">282:1</a> These forty-nine oblations performed after the letting loose of the horse, are called Prakramas (i.e. steps, or movements); cf. <a href="sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:4">XIII, 4, 3, 4</a>; Kâty.

 <p><a name="fn_705"></a><a href="sbe44076.htm#fr_709">282:2</a> These (rather pedantic) formulas, all of them ending in 'svâhâ,' occupy two Ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâs of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, consisting of 24 and 25 formulas respectively:--1.

 <p><a name="fn_706"></a><a href="sbe44076.htm#fr_710">283:1</a> According to Kâty.
