XX, 2, 19), or as a seat or stool which has the appearance of a pad (pî<i>th</i>a<i>m</i> kûr<i>k</i>âk<i>ri</i>ti,? i.e. with a pad on it). According to Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. X, 6, 19) the king is surrounded by his sons and ministers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_927"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_931">361:1</a> Or, perhaps, 'raise this Sacrificer above (or, up to) the things of the past;' but see <a href="sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:15">paragraph 15</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_928"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_932">361:2</a> That is, the 'revolving, recurrent, or cyclic legend,' so called because it is renewed every ten days during the year.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_929"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_933">361:3</a> Harisvâmin explains this interjection, as if it were 'hvayai' = pratihvayai, 'I will respond, I am ready to respond;' and, though this is probably a fanciful explanation, the arrangements made on this occasion are clearly such as to suggest a studied resemblance to the call and counter-call of the two priests on all occasions of a solemn utterance of sacrificial formulas, or the recitation of hymns, as at the Prâtaranuvâka (part ii, p. 226 seqq.). Kâty. XX, 3, 2, accordingly, calls it the Adhvaryu's 'pratigara,' or response. Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. X, 6, 13 makes the Adhvaryu's answer 'ho hotar'; and Sâṅkh. <i>S</i>r. XVI, 1 'hoyi hotar.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_930"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_934">361:4</a> The Hot<i>ri</i>'s utterances on the ten days of the revolving period (as set forth in passages 2-14) occur also, with some variations of detail, in the manuals defining the Hot<i>ri</i>'s duties, viz. the Â<i>s</i>valâyana (X, 7) and <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana (XVI, 2) Sûtras (whilst the works of the Taittirîyakas seem to have nothing corresponding to this performance). Both Sûtras omit 'râ<i>g</i>â' each time. Â<i>s</i>valâyana, moreover, omits also the 'iti' along with it, because he does not interrupt the formula by an insertion, as is done here (ity âha) <a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a> and in the <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. (iti prathame, &amp;c.). Gârgya Nârâya<i>n</i>a, on Â<i>s</i>v. X, 7, 1, takes the opening words 'prathame (&amp;c.) <font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>hani' to form part of the formulas:--'on the first day Manu Vaivasvata (is king); but it is clear from the other two authorities that this cannot have been intended by the author of that Sûtra.--The commentator on <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. XVI, 2 remarks, 'Manur Vaivasvato râ<i>g</i>ety-evam-âdikam âkhyâna<i>m</i> pariplavâkhya<i>m</i> prathamâhany â<i>k</i>ash<i>t</i>e . . . tasya râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>o manushyâ vi<i>s</i>a<i>h</i> pra<i>g</i>âs ta ima âsate<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>dyâpi svadharmân na <i>k</i>alanti,' thus apparently taking 'râ<i>g</i>â' to form part of the formula, or rather of the topic of which the legend to be recited was to treat. This commentary thus apparently assumes that the legend begins with 'Manur Vaivasvato râ<i>g</i>â'; and that the subsequent clause leads on to the recitation of the Vedic text that is to follow (cf. note on paragraph 8);--though. possibly this latter clause (as Professor M. Müller seems to take it) may only be an argumentative one, giving the reason why the householders are to be instructed. Cf. M. Müller, Hist. of Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 37 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_931"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_935">362:1</a> 'Householders should be brought thither' (i.e. should be made to join this performance); Â<i>s</i>v.-sûtra. <i>S</i>âṅkh. has merely 'thereby he instructs householders.' G<i>ri</i>hamedhina<i>h</i> are those who regularly perform the five great domestic sacrifices (mahâya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_932"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_936">362:2</a> Or, more closely, the Veda is the, or consists of, <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (verses). Sâṅkh. S. reads '<i>ri</i><i>k</i>o veda<i>h</i>' (the Veda of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, gen. sing.) instead of '<i>ri</i><i>k</i>a<i>h</i>' (nom. pl.), and in the subsequent paragraph also, it repeats the word 'veda' (Ya<i>g</i>urveda, Atharvaveda, Aṅ<i>g</i>iraso veda<i>h</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_933"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_937">362:3</a> That is, as would seem,--as if he were to recite it (or, as when he recites it) in the course of the ordinary sacrificial performance--as in <i>S</i>astras, the Prâtaranuvâka, &amp;c. The text would, however, also admit of the translation--'thus saying, let him go over (the legend) as if he were reciting a hymn of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>,' but it is not quite easy to see how a similar interpretation would suit subsequent paragraphs (11-14). Moreover, both Â<i>s</i>v. and Sâṅkh. omit 'vyâ<i>k</i>akshâ<i>n</i>a iti,' and read 'nigadet,' 'let him recite (a hymn),' <a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a> instead of 'anudravet (let him run, or go, over = anupûrvam u<i>k</i><i>k</i>ârayet, Harisv.).' Yet, the commentary on <i>S</i>âṅkh. supplies the 'iva,' explaining as he does, 'sûkta<i>m</i> ki<i>m</i><i>k</i>id â<i>k</i>akshâ<i>n</i>a ivânuvadet;' from which (if it is not simply quoted from our Brâhma<i>n</i>a) it would almost seem as if he, too, thought of the legend rather than a hymn of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>. The verb 'vyâ-<i>k</i>aksh,' as against 'ni-gad,' seems to imply a clear articulation--perhaps even with all the stops or pauses, at the end of every half-verse, or pâda, as the case might be. Sâya<i>n</i>a (on Taitt. Br. II, 2, 1, 4; 2, 6) explains 'vyâ<i>k</i>akshîta' by 'vispash<i>t</i>am u<i>k</i><i>k</i>ârayet (or, pa<i>th</i>et).' The available MS. of Harisvâmin's commentary on our text is, as usual, incorrect, but as far as it goes, it seems to favour the recitation of the legend at this place,--'vyâ<i>k</i>akshâ<i>n</i>a iti vâkya<i>s</i>as <i>k</i>idan (r. <i>kh</i>indan) agai<i>s</i> <i>k</i>âbhidad (?) ity artha<i>h</i>,'--which I take to mean that he is to pause after each sentence, as he would do when reciting a hymn.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_934"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_938">363:1</a> That is, according to Harisvâmin,--'Compare this Sacrificer in song with the old righteous kings.' Katy. XX, 3, 8 refers to these latter as 'râ<i>g</i>arshis,' or royal sages--in which case the recitation of the legend itself would only come in here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_935"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_939">363:2</a> For the formulas used with this series of forty-nine oblations, see <a href="sbe44076.htm#13:1:3:5">XIII, 1, 3, 5</a> with notes thereon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_936"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_940">363:3</a> That is to say, according to Harisvâmin, the course of procedure laid down in <a href="sbe44076.htm#13:1:3:7">XIII, 1, 3, 7</a>, according to which these oblations are to be made on the Âhavanîya, and not either on the southern fire, or on a footprint of the horse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_937"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_941">364:1</a> That is to say, the Prakramas which are only performed on the first day of the year, whilst the three oblations to Savit<i>ri</i> are repeated each day.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_938"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_942">364:2</a> See XIII, 1, 4, 3; 6, 2. These oblations are made just prior to the evening performance of the Agnihotra, when the Âhavanîya has been got ready for the latter. The Taittirîyakas seem to make these four oblations on the horse's feet at the place where the keepers pass the night (viz. the carpenter's house) during the greater part of the year; and only in the last month, when a stable of A<i>s</i>vattha wood has been put up for the horse near (or on) the offering-ground, these oblations take place on the Âhavanîya. See comm. on Taitt. Br. III, 8, 12 (p. 609; cp. p. 700). At III, 9, 14 (p. 703), on the other hand, it is stated that the Râ<i>g</i>anya's singing is to take place in the evening at the time of the Dh<i>ri</i>ti-homas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_939"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_943">364:3</a> Taitt. Br. III, 9, 54, 4, again mentions three topics, one for each stanza--viz. 'thus (i.e. in the same way as P<i>ri</i>thu, Bharata, Bhagîratha, Yudhish<i>th</i>ira &amp;c., comm.) didst thou overpower (the enemies), thus (i.e. surrounded by heroic warriors, fighting on elephants, steeds, chariots, and on foot, with bows and arrows, spears, swords, &amp;c.) didst thou battle, thus didst thou fight such and such battle (i.e. like Yudhish<i>th</i>ira, Dushyanta, &amp;c., having engaged in a battle attended by thousands of great heroes, thou, armed only with thy sharp sword, didst slay the king of Kashmir, Magadha, Pu<i>n</i><i>d</i>ra, &amp;c., comm.).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_940"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_944">365:1</a> When the comm. on <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. remarks, 'Yamo Vaivasvato râ<i>g</i>ety âheti divitîya evâhani <i>S</i>atapathe dar<i>s</i>anât,' this would seem to refer to the addition of either 'râ<i>g</i>â,' or 'ahani,' but not to any legend of Y. V., since such a one does not occur in this work; though various passages in the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> might no doubt have sufficed to construct some such legend as would have served on this occasion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_941"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_945">365:2</a> The same commentator refers to the 'Â<i>s</i>vamedhika' as the section to be recited,--'prakara<i>n</i>ât,' because of the treatment (therein of this subject).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_942"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_946">365:3</a> Instead of 'atharva<i>n</i>âm eka<i>m</i> parva,' the <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. has 'bhesha<i>g</i>am (medicine),' which the commentator--against the opinion of those who take it to mean the hymn <i>Ri</i>g-veda X, 97 (treating of the magic powers of herbs)--makes a special work of the Âtharva<i>n</i>ikas; whilst the Â<i>s</i>v. S. reads 'yad bhesha<i>g</i>a<i>m</i> ni<i>s</i>ânta<i>m</i> <a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 366</font></a> syât tan nigadet'--'let him tell some approved medicine (i. e: some specific, or charm against disease).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_943"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_947">366:1</a> The comm. on Sâṅkh. S. remarks, 'Somo Vaish<i>n</i>ava iti <i>k</i>aturthe; Somo Vaish<i>n</i>avo râ<i>g</i>eti Satapatha<i>s</i>rute<i>h</i>; pratîkagraha<i>n</i>âny etâni.' This seems to show clearly that he takes this as merely the opening words of the legend. Here, again, his words can hardly be taken to refer to a legend regarding Soma in the Satapatha-Brâhma<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_944"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_948">366:2</a> 'Yuvatî<i>h</i> <i>s</i>obhanâ upadi<i>s</i>ati, tasyaitâ<i>h</i> (? tasyaitâbhya<i>h</i>) sabhâyâm anyâsâm aprave<i>s</i>ât,' comm. on <i>S</i>âṅkh. S., --? because no other (Apsaras) but these come to his court.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_945"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_949">366:3</a> The <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. has 'let him recite the Ghora'--which the commentator again takes to be the title of a special work of the Atharvans--whilst the Â<i>s</i>v. S. reads 'let him recite some approved ghora (magic spell or operation).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_946"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_950">367:1</a> 'Arbuda<i>h</i> Kâdraveyo râ<i>g</i>ety âheti <i>s</i>rute<i>h</i> (thus also on the name of the next king),' comm. on <i>S</i>âṅkh. S.</p>

S. explains by 'those knowing the Kâ<i>s</i>yapîya and other treatises (tantra) on venoms.' Instead of the conjunctive double '<i>k</i>a,' the <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. has a single 'vâ'--the snakes, or (rather) snake-charmers--and Â<i>s</i>v. S. an explanatory 'iti'--the snakes, i.e. snake-charmers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_948"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_952">367:3</a> The <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. has, 'let hire recite the Sarpavidyâ' (i.e. either the Gâru<i>d</i>â or Kaṅkaniyâ sarpavidyâ, as the comm. explains); the Â<i>s</i>v. S. 'let him recite the Vishavidyâ (science of venoms).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_949"></a><a href="sbe44104.htm#fr_953">367:4</a> The etymology and exact meaning of 'selaga' is doubtful:--here, again, whilst 'pâpak<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i>' is added either appositionally, or attributively (wicked selagas), the <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. adds it by means of 'vâ,' and the Â<i>s</i>v. S. by 'iti'--both apparently meant in an explanatory sense. The Ait. Br., on the other hand, has VII, 1, 'selagâ vâ pâpak<i>ri</i>to vâ;' and VIII, 11, 'nishâdâ vâ selagâ vâ pâpak<i>ri</i>to vâ.' The comm. on Â<i>s</i>v. S. explains 'selaga' by 'maddened by a snake;' the comm. on <i>S</i>âṅkh. S. by 'selagâ<i>h</i> se<i>n</i>yâgâyanya<i>h</i> (?) pâpak<i>ri</i>to vâ mle<i>kh</i>â<i>h</i>.'</p>

Â<i>s</i>v. S. has 'yat ki<i>m</i><i>k</i>it pi<i>s</i>â<i>k</i>asa<i>m</i>yukta<i>m</i> ni<i>s</i>ântam,' 'some approved (spell or operation?) connected with the Pi<i>s</i>â<i>k</i>as, or demons.'</p>
