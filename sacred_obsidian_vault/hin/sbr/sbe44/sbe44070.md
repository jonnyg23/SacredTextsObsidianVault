Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, seeing his son slain, brought Soma suitable for witchery, and withheld from Indra. Indra, committing a desecration of the sacrifice, by main force drank off his (Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'s) Soma juice. He went asunder in every direction,--from his mouth and vital airs his excellence and fame passed</p>

 <p>away, and entered the cattle, whence cattle are one's fame: and famous, indeed, is he who, knowing this, is consecrated <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">1</font></a> by the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:2">12:8:3:2</a></font></span>2. The two A<i>s</i>vins and Sarasvatî then prepared for him this sacrifice, the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, for the purpose of healing him, and thereby consecrated him: thereby he became the highest of gods, and so does he who is consecrated by that (offering) become the highest among his own people.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:3">12:8:3:3</a></font></span>3. He consecrates him on a black antelope skin; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">2</font></a>: it is at the sacrifice he thus consecrates him; on the hairy side (of the skin), for the hair is the metres: it is on the metres (or sacred writ) he thus consecrates him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:4">12:8:3:4</a></font></span>4. On a throne-seat he consecrates him, for imperial dignity is seated (established) on a throne-seat: by means of imperial dignity he thus causes him to attain imperial dignity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:5">12:8:3:5</a></font></span>5. It is made of udumbara wood, for the udumbara (ficus glomerata) is strength: for the sake of strength he thus is consecrated. It is knee-high, for knee-high is this (terrestrial) world, and it is for (the rule of) this world that the Kshatriya is consecrated; and the ruler (kshatra) indeed he becomes who is consecrated by the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î: therefore it is knee-high, and of unlimited size horizontally (in width and depth),--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:6">12:8:3:6</a></font></span>6. For the throne-seat means royal dignity, and of unlimited prosperity is royal dignity. It is covered with plaited reed-work, for reed-grass is meet for sacrifice. Two of its feet stand on the</p>

 <p>northern, and two on the southern altar-ground <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the northern vedi is this (terrestrial) world, and the southern one the world of the Fathers: he thus consecrates him for both worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:7">12:8:3:7</a></font></span>7. Concerning this, Gaurîviti <i>S</i>âktya, knowing this, once said, 'Like rulers <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">2</font></a>, assuredly, we shall be in yonder world!' Perhaps <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">3</font></a> it was Rishabha Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>atura, king of the Svikna, who had told him so.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:8">12:8:3:8</a></font></span>8. He places the throne-seat, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 1), 'Thou art the womb of the Kshatra, thou art the navel of the Kshatra!' for it indeed is the womb and navel of the Kshatra (ruling power).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:9">12:8:3:9</a></font></span>9. He then spreads the black antelope skin thereon, with, 'May it not injure thee! do not</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>injure me!' for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice: (thus it is spread) for the safety of the sacrifice and his own self.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:10">12:8:3:10</a></font></span>10. He then mounts it, with a verse to Varu<i>n</i>a (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 2), for Varu<i>n</i>a is the king of the gods: by means of his own deity he thus consecrates him <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law, Varu<i>n</i>a, in the home-steads, for supreme rule, he the wise!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:11">12:8:3:11</a></font></span>11. He then throws down a gold and a silver plate (beneath his feet, the silver one beneath the left foot) with, 'Protect (me) from death!' (the gold one beneath the right foot <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">2</font></a> with,) 'Protect (me) from lightning!' The Virâ<i>g</i>, doubtless, is the rain, and of this there are these two terrible forms, lightning and hail; of these the gold plate is of the form of lightning, and the silver one of that of hail: against these two deities he affords protection to him, whence he who has performed the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î has no fear of these two deities, as he also who thus knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:12">12:8:3:12</a></font></span>12. He consecrates him by sprinkling him with the fat gravy of the sacrificial animals, for the gravy of the animals means excellence: with that excellence, the essence of cattle, he thus sprinkles him. But that gravy is also the highest kind of food: with the highest kind of food he thus sprinkles him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:13">12:8:3:13</a></font></span>13. There are hoof-cups (of gravy), for on hoofs cattle support themselves: he thus causes him to obtain a support. There are thirty-three (such)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>cupfuls, for thirty-three in number are all the deities: by means of all the deities he thus consecrates him. He offers them with <i>g</i>agatî verses, for animals are of <i>g</i>âgata (movable) nature: by means of the <i>G</i>agatî he thus secures cattle for him. With sixteen verses (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 80-94) he offers, for animals are of sixteen parts: he thus bestows excellence (or prosperity) on him part by part.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:14">12:8:3:14</a></font></span>14. 'With lead the wise, with wool and thread <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">1</font></a> the sages weave the web, the sacrifice: the A<i>s</i>vins, Savit<i>ri</i>, Sarasvatî, and Varu<i>n</i>a healed the form of Indra <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' Each time he has offered two (cupfuls) together, he pours the residue into a bowl (sata): he thereby establishes the days and nights, the half-months, the months, and the seasons in the year, and hence these days and nights, half-months, months, and seasons are established (contained) in the year.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:15">12:8:3:15</a></font></span>15. The bowl is made of reed, for the reed has its birth-place in the waters, and the waters are all the deities: by means of all the deities he thus consecrates him.</p>  
 <p>16. A rubbing down (of the Sacrificer) with all manner of sweet-smelling substances takes place (before sprinkling him with fat), for such a rubbing down with all manner of sweet-smelling substances means supreme fragrance: with fragrance he thus consecrates (anoints) him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:17">12:8:3:17</a></font></span>17. He sprinkles him (with the fat gravy) in front while (himself) looking towards the back (west), for</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a></p>  
 <p>from the front food is visibly eaten. On. every side (he sprinkles him) whilst moving round: he thus bestows food on him from all quarters, whence food is secured from all quarters by him who has performed the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, or even by him who thus knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:18">12:8:3:18</a></font></span>18. With a formula to the A<i>s</i>vins he sprinkles him first <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">1</font></a>, then with one to Sarasvatî, then with one to Indra: it is by means of these deities he thus consecrates him. Now, some consecrate him by means both of these deities and those utterances, 'bhû<i>h</i> bhuva<i>h</i>, svar,' 'for,' say they, 'these utterances ("earth, air, heaven") mean all this (universe) it is by means of all this (universe) we thus consecrate him.' Let him, however, not do so, but let him only consecrate him by means of those deities, for those deities, indeed, are all this (universe).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:19">12:8:3:19</a></font></span>19. He consecrates him prior to the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (offering), for the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t is the Kshatra: he thus consecrates him by means of the Kshatra (or, by a Kshatriya). And he consecrates him between (the oblation to) the Lord of the Forest <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, for the lord of the forest (or the tree) is Soma, and the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (maker of good offering) is Agni: he thus consecrates him after encompassing him by Agni and Soma; whence both those who know, and those who do not, say, 'A Kshatriya is the consecrator of a Kshatriya <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:20">12:8:3:20</a></font></span>20. They then lift him up <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">2</font></a> knee-high, then navel-high, then as high as the mouth; for the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya doubtless is the same as the consecration, and the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is a consecration; and even as there, at the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, he (the Sacrificer) mounts the sacrificial stake <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">3</font></a>, like that is this rite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:21">12:8:3:21</a></font></span>21. As to this they say, 'But, surely, he who is consecrated by the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î moves away from this world.' Well, he descends again upon the black antelope skin, and, the black antelope skin being the sacrifice, he thus finally establishes himself on the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:22">12:8:3:22</a></font></span>22. [He descends <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">4</font></a>, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 10,] 'Firmly <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">5</font></a> I establish myself in the Kshatra (lordship), in royal sway,'--in lordship and royal sway he thus establishes himself so as not to lose lordship and royal sway;--'firmly in horses I establish</p>

 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>myself, and in kine,'--in the midst of horses and kine he thus establishes himself so as not to lose horses and kine;--'firmly in the limbs I establish myself, and in the body,'--in the limbs and in the body he thus establishes himself so as not to lose his limbs and his body;--'firmly in the vital airs I establish myself, and in prosperity,'--in the vital airs and in prosperity he thus establishes himself so as not to lose the vital airs and prosperity;--'firmly in heaven and on earth I establish myself, and in the sacrifice,'--he thus establishes himself in these two, heaven and earth, within which is all this (universe).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:23">12:8:3:23</a></font></span>23. He <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">1</font></a> then sings a Sâman (hymn-tune), for the Sâman means lordship (kshatra): with lordship he thus consecrates him; or the Sâman means imperial sway: by means of imperial sway he thus causes him to attain imperial sway. And, indeed, the Sâman is the essence of all the Vedas: he thus consecrates him with the essence of all the Vedas.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:24">12:8:3:24</a></font></span>24. He sings it on a b<i>ri</i>hatî verse <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for established on the B<i>ri</i>hatî, as his excellence and foundation,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>that sun shines <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_646"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thus establishes him on the B<i>ri</i>hatî, as his excellence and foundation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:25">12:8:3:25</a></font></span>25. He sings it on a b<i>ri</i>hatî verse relating to Indra, for this sacrifice, the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has Indra for his support: he thus consecrates him on his own support (or resting-place).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:26">12:8:3:26</a></font></span>26. And as to why (these hymns) are called 'bracers <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">2</font></a>;' it is because by means of these Sâmans the gods braced Indra up to energy, or vital power: in like manner do the officiating priests, by means of these Sâmans, brace the Sacrificer up to energy, or vital power. 'Sa<i>m</i><i>s</i>ravase, vi<i>s</i>ravase, satya<i>s</i>ravase, <i>s</i>ravase <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">3</font></a>'--these are the Sâmans: they proclaim</p>

 <p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a></p>  
 <p>him in these worlds. There are four <i>finales</i>, for there are four quarters: they thus establish him in all the quarters. All (the priests) join in the <i>finale:</i> with one mind they thus bestow excellence upon him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:27">12:8:3:27</a></font></span>27. As to this they say, 'Seeing that this Sâman is sung, wherein then does the recitation (uktha) of this Sâman consist, and what is its foundation; for unsuccessful is what is chanted unless it be followed by a recitation?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:28">12:8:3:28</a></font></span>28. 'Thrice eleven are the gods;' this, indeed, is the recitation <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">1</font></a> belonging to that Sâman, this its foundation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:29">12:8:3:29</a></font></span>29. Or he (the Adhvaryu) takes a thirty-third cupful (of gravy), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 11-12  <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">1</font></a>), 'Thrice</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a></p>  
 <p>eleven are the gods,'--for there are indeed thrice eleven gods;--'three-and-thirty, bountiful,'--for there are thirty-three gods; 'with B<i>ri</i>haspati for their Purohita,'--B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman (n.): he thus means to say, 'With the Brahman for their Purohita (family-priest);'--'at the impulse (sava) of the god Savit<i>ri</i>,'--that is, 'impelled by the god Savit<i>ri</i>;'--'may the gods protect me through the gods!' for the gods indeed consecrate him through the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:30">12:8:3:30</a></font></span>30. 'The first with the second,'--for the first (gods, on earth) consecrate him along with the second ones (in the air);--'the second with the third,'--for the second ones consecrate him along with the third ones (in the sky);--'the third with <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">1</font></a> the truth,'--for the third ones consecrate him with the truth;--'the truth with the sacrifice,'--for the truth consecrates him with the sacrifice;--'the sacrifice with sacrificial texts,'--for the sacrifice consecrates him with sacrificial texts;--'sacrificial texts with hymn-tunes,'--for sacrificial texts (ya<i>g</i>us) consecrate him along with hymn-tunes 'hymn-tunes with hymn-verses,'--for hymn-tunes consecrate him along with hymn-verses (<i>ri</i><i>k</i>):--'hymn-verses with invitatory verses,'--for hymn-verses consecrate him along with invitatory verses;--'invitatory verses with offering-verses,'--for invitatory verses consecrate him along with offering-verses;--'offering-verses with Vasha<i>t</i>-calls,'--for offering-verses consecrate him</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a></p>  
 <p>along with Vasha<i>t</i>-calls;--'Vasha<i>t</i>-calls with oblations,'--for Vasha<i>t</i>-calls consecrate him along with oblations;--'May the oblations render successful my wishes! bhû<i>h</i>! svâhâ!'--having thus consecrated him by means of those deities from first to last, he thus, by means of oblations, renders all his wishes successful. Having then solicited an invitation from the officiating priests, he (the Sacrificer) drinks <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">1</font></a> (the remains of the cup of vasâ), for the officiating priests are the seasons: it is thus in the seasons that he solicits art invitation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:3:31">12:8:3:31</a></font></span>31. He drinks it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

 <p><a name="fn_640"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_642">254:2</a> According to Kâty. Sr. XIX, 4, 19-2I, the Adhvaryu first touches him, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

 <p><a name="fn_643"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_645">254:5</a> The function of 'prati' here seems to be to strengthen the preposition in the verb 'prati-tish<i>th</i>âmi.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_644"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_646">255:1</a> According to the commentator on Kâty. XIX, 5, 1, the Brahman sings, whilst Lâ<i>t</i>y. V, 4, 16-19 gives directions from which the Udgât<i>ri</i> would seem to be expected to perform this duty. When the Sacrificer is being anointed, the Udgât<i>ri</i> is to step between the (northern and southern) fires and, as soon as he is called upon by the Adhvaryu, he is to commence the Sâman. It would probably depend on the Brahman's previous studies, whether or not he was sufficiently conversant with the complicated details of the hymnology.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_646"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_648">256:1</a> Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 42, refers to a parallel passage in Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya-Br. VII, 4, 7--'By means of the Bahishpavamâna (of the morning service) the gods carried off Âditya, the sun, to heaven; but he did not stop there. At midday they then fixed him by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî, and for this reason the B<i>ri</i>hatî metre is used for the Pavamâna-stotra at the midday service.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_647"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_649">256:2</a> Literally, sharpeners or sharpenings (sa<i>m</i><i>s</i>âna).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_648"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_650">256:3</a> These words--apparently meaning 'for fame all round, for fame far and wide, for true fame, for fame' (or, perhaps, for hearing, or, rather, being heard of all round,' &amp;c.)--are used to form the <i>finales</i> (nidhana) in which all the priests are to join; cf. Sâmav., Calc. ed., I, pp. 533-4, where the figured text is given. According to Katy. XIX, 5, 4-5; Lâ<i>t</i>y. V, 4, 19, the words, 'sa<i>m</i><i>g</i>ityai, vi<i>g</i>ityai, satya<i>g</i>ityai, <i>g</i>ityai' (for complete victory, victory far and wide, &amp;c.), and 'sampush<i>t</i>yai, vipush<i>t</i>yai,' &amp;c. (for complete prosperity, &amp;c.), are to be used instead, in the case of a Kshatriya and Vai<i>s</i>ya respectively, either optionally or necessarily. Though these four words are here, and elsewhere, spoken of as so many different Sâmans, only 'the last of them ('<i>s</i>ravase') forms the <i>finale</i> of a Sâman in the ordinary sense of the word; the others being merely combined with certain musical ejaculations, or expletives (stobhas). All the four 'Sâmans' begin with the same phrase (varying only in the verb)--'sa<i>m</i> tvâ hinvanti (ri<i>n</i>anti, <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> tatakshur, <i>s</i>i<i>s</i>anti) dhîtibhi<i>h</i>,' i, e. 'they make thee up (or urge thee on) with prayers,' serving as a kind of prelude (prastâva) the single words of which are given among the Stobhas (Sâmav„ Calc. ed., II, p. 522, last line), as, indeed, the words 'sa<i>m</i><i>s</i>ravase,' &amp;c., themselves are (ib., p. 520). In the first three Sâmans this phrase is followed by the <i>finale</i> consisting of the respective characteristic word preceded by the Stobha 'auhovâ.' In the last Sâman, on the other hand, the introductory phrase is followed by the choral setting of the verse 'B<i>ri</i>had indrâya gâyata' (see <a href="#page_255">p. 255</a>, n. <a href="#fn_645">2</a>), which, in its turn, is followed again by the first phrase, with a slightly modified modulation, ending with 'auhovâ <i>s</i>ravase.' Whilst joining in the <i>finale</i>, the priests, according to Lâ<i>t</i>y. V, 4, 17, are to lay their hands on the head of the Sacrificer.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_649"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_652">257:1</a> According to Katy. Sr. XIX, 4, 24; 5, 8 seq.; 7, 1 seq., the thirty-third libation of gravy is taken with the text, XX, 32, 'yo bhûtânâm adhipati<i>h</i> (he who is the over-lord of creatures),' &amp;c.; whilst, on the conclusion of the Sastra, or Hot<i>ri</i>'s recitation, the Sacrificer offers the libation from that last cup with XX, 11-12, and drinks the remainder with XX, 13. The Sastra, recited in response to the Sâman, consists of the section of .eleven verses, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 80-90, the first and last verses of which are recited thrice; whilst the 'âhâva' (<i>s</i>o<i>m</i>sâvom, 'let us praise, om!') is inserted by him before each triplet of the remaining nine verses. The two verses used whilst the Sacrificer offers (XX, 11-12) are likewise recited by the <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a> Hot<i>ri</i>, as a 'nivid,' being either added at the end of the Sastra, or inserted before the ninth or tenth verse; the whole recitation thus consisting of seventeen verses.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_650"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_653">258:1</a> Mahîdhara takes the instrumental throughout as a sociative (saha satyena).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_651"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_654">259:1</a> According to Kâty. XIX, 5, 9, the priests themselves first smell the remainder of the fat gravy, with the text (XX, 34), 'The protector of my breath thou art,' &amp;c. Cf. also <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:42">XIV, 2, 2, 42</a>, with note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_652"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_655">259:2</a> The use of 'prayati' in this sense (here and Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 1) is peculiar; being apparently derived from 'pra-yam,' one would expect it to have some such meaning as 'offer, gift.' This and the other predicates, according to Mahîdhara, are to show the state of feeling of beings towards the (royal) Sacrificer. The repetition of 'ânati' (bowing, prostration, submission) is strange. A strong alliterative cadence is noticeable in the verse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_653"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_656">259:3</a> ? Hardly 'return' here; rather, perhaps, 'attaining to (the other worlds),' or, possibly, 'the turning to him, gathering round him (of the people).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_654"></a><a href="sbe44070.htm#fr_657">259:4</a> ? Or, he now calls these to himself in the meantime.</p>
