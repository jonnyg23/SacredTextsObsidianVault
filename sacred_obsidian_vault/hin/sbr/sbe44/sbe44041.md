Verily, even as this cart-wheel, or a potter's wheel, would creak <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">1</font></a> if not steadied, so, indeed, were these worlds unfirm and unsteadied.</p>

By means of the mountains and rivers he stablished this (earth), by means of the birds and sun-motes <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">2</font></a> the air, and by means of the clouds and stars the sky.</p>

He then exclaimed, 'Wealth!'--now, wealth <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">3</font></a> (mahas) means cattle, whence they (cattle) thrive (mahîyante <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">4</font></a>) exceedingly in the homestead of one who possesses many of them; and this (Sacrificer), indeed, possesses many of them, and in his homestead they do thrive exceedingly. Wherefore, if people were either to forcibly drive him from his home, or to bid him go forth, let him, after performing the Agni-hotra, approach (the fires) saying, 'Wealth'; and he becomes firmly established by offspring and cattle, and is not deprived of his home.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_390"></a><a href="sbe44041.htm#fr_390">126:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a apparently takes 'krand' in the sense of 'to shake, or wabble,'--'even as a cart-wheel or some other wheel, not standing on the ground for want of the wooden rest (âlambana-kâsh<i>th</i>a,? axle-pin) or some other thing, would wabble (hvalet).' What Sâya<i>n</i>a means to say, probably, is that the verb used by the author expresses the effect of the action intended.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_391"></a><a href="sbe44041.htm#fr_391">126:2</a> Or, sun-beams (ra<i>s</i>mi), as Sâya<i>n</i>a takes 'marî<i>k</i>i'; cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 9, note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_392"></a><a href="sbe44041.htm#fr_392">126:3</a> Or, joy;--cp. II, 3, 4, 25, which would seem to be the passage referred to in the present paragraph.</p>
