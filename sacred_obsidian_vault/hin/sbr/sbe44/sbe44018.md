Now these two, mind and speech, whilst being one and the same, are, as it were, distinct from each other: therefore they tie up the calf and its mother with one and the same rope; and the fire <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">1</font></a>, indeed, is faith, and the ghee truth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:3:1:2">11:3:1:2</a></font></span>2. Now, as to this <i>G</i>anaka of Videha once asked Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, 'Knowest thou the Agnihotra, Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya?'--'I know it, O king,' he said.--'What is it?'--'Milk, indeed.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:3:1:3">11:3:1:3</a></font></span>3. 'If there were no milk, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With rice and barley.'--'If there were no rice and barley, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With what other herbs there are.'--'If there were no other herbs, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With what forest herbs there are.'--'If there were no forest herbs, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With fruit of trees.'--'If there were no fruit of trees, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With water.'--'If there were no water, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:3:1:4">11:3:1:4</a></font></span>4. He spake, 'Then, indeed, there would be nothing whatsoever here, and yet there would be offered--the truth in faith.'--'Thou knowest the Agnihotra, Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya: I give thee a hundred cows,' said <i>G</i>anaka.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:3:1:5">11:3:1:5</a></font></span>5. Concerning this point there are also these</p>

 <p>verses:--'Knowing what <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">1</font></a>, does the offerer of the Agnihotra stay away from his house? how is his wisdom (manifested) <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">2</font></a>? how is he kept up by his fires <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">3</font></a>?'--whereby he means to say, 'How, then, is there no staying away from home on his part <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">4</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:3:1:6">11:3:1:6</a></font></span>6. 'He who is the swiftest in the worlds <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">5</font></a>, that wise one is found staying abroad: thus (is manifested) his wisdom, thus he is kept up by his fires;'--he thereby means the mind: it is owing to his mind that there is no staying away from home on his part.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:3:1:7">11:3:1:7</a></font></span>7. 'When, having gone far away, he heedeth not there his duty, wherein is that offering of his offered; (and wherein) do they, at his house, perform the offering of the progress?'--that is to say,--'When, having gone far away, he there heeds not his duty, wherein does that offering of his come to be offered?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:3:1:8">11:3:1:8</a></font></span>8. 'He who waketh in the worlds and sustaineth all beings, in him that offering of his is offered, (and in him) do they, at his house, perform the offering</p>
