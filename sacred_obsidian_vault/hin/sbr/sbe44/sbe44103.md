Whilst this (offering to Pûshan) is being performed, the horse, having been cleansed, is led up--being one which is marked with all colours, or which is perfect in speed, worth a thousand (cows), in its prime, and without its match under the right-side yoke <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:2">13:4:2:2</a></font></span>2. And as to its being one marked with all colours, it is for the sake of his (the Sacrificer's) obtaining and securing everything, for colour (outward appearance) is everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything. And as to its being perfect in speed, it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing vigour, for speed is vigour. And as to its being worth a thousand (cows), it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything. And as to its being in its prime, it is for the sake of his obtaining unlimited vigour, for such a one that is in the prime (of youth) increases to unlimited vigour. And as to its being without its match under the right-side yoke, it is for the sake of his obtaining yonder (sun), for that (horse) indeed is he that shines yonder, and assuredly there is no one to rival him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:3">13:4:2:3</a></font></span>3. As to this, Bhâllaveya, however, said, 'That horse should be of two colours, black-spotted <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for that (horse) was produced from Pra<i>g</i>âpati's eye, and this eye is of two colours, white and black: he thus endows it with its own colour.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:4">13:4:2:4</a></font></span>4. But Sâtyaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>i said, 'That horse should be of three colours, its forepart black, its hindpart white, with a wain for its mark in front;--when its forepart is black it is the same as this black of the eye; and when its hindpart is white it is the same as this white of the eye; and when it has a wain for its mark in front, that is the pupil: such</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a></p>  
 <p>a one, indeed, is perfect in colour <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' Whichever of these, then, should be ready at hand, either a many-coloured one, or one of two colours, or one of three colours with a wain for its mark, let him slaughter it: but in speed it should certainly be perfect.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:5">13:4:2:5</a></font></span>5. In front (of the sacrificial ground) there are those keepers of it ready at hand,--to wit, a hundred royal princes, clad in armour; a hundred warriors armed with swords; a hundred sons of heralds and headmen, bearing quivers filled with arrows <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and a hundred sons of attendants <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">3</font></a> and charioteers, bearing staves;--and a hundred exhausted, worn out horses <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">4</font></a> amongst which, having let loose that (sacrificial horse), they guard it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:6">13:4:2:6</a></font></span>6. He then prepares an (ish<i>t</i>i) offering to Savit<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">5</font></a>--a cake on twelve potsherds to Savit<i>ri</i> Prasavit<i>ri</i>--thinking, May Savit<i>ri</i> impel this my sacrifice!' for Savit<i>ri</i> (the sun), indeed, is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:7">13:4:2:7</a></font></span>7. For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses;</p>

 <p>and the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V<i>ri</i>tra <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">1</font></a>. [The verses, <i>Ri</i>g-veda V, 82, 9; VII, 45, 1], 'He who calleth forth all these beings (with his call, may he, Savit<i>ri</i>, quicken us)!' and 'May the divine Savit<i>ri</i> come hither, treasure-laden, (filling the air whilst driving with his steeds; holding in his hand many things meet for man; and laying to rest and awakening the world),' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and offering formulas of the chief oblation. Those of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t are two virâ<i>g</i>-verses <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:8">13:4:2:8</a></font></span>8. Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish<i>t</i>i) are being performed, a Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">3</font></a>), sings three strophes composed by himself (on topics <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">4</font></a> such as), 'Such a sacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this has been explained <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:9">13:4:2:9</a></font></span>9. He then prepares a second (offering)--a cake on twelve potsherds to Savit<i>ri</i> Âsavit<i>ri</i>--thinking, 'May Savit<i>ri</i> propel this my sacrifice!' for Savit<i>ri</i>, indeed, is the propeller (âsavit<i>ri</i>).</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:10">13:4:2:10</a></font></span>10. For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses; and the two butter-portions are possessed of that which is <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">1</font></a>: the (truly) existent he thereby obtains. [The verses, <i>Ri</i>g-veda V, 82, 5; VII, 45, 31 'All troubles, O divine Savit<i>ri</i>, (keep from us, do thou send us that which is good)!' and 'May that mighty god Savit<i>ri</i> (the lord of treasure, send us treasure; shedding wide-spread lustre, may he bestow upon us the joys of mortal life)!' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and offering formulas of the chief oblation. Those of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t are two anush<i>t</i>ubh verses <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Silver is the priests’ fee,--for the sake of variety of colour, and also for the sake of (the horse's) going outside <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">3</font></a> and not going away. It weighs a hundred (grains), for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is life, and energy, vigour, he thus secures for himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:11">13:4:2:11</a></font></span>11. Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish<i>t</i>i) are being performed, a Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune), sings three strophes composed by himself (on topics such as), 'Such a sacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:12">13:4:2:12</a></font></span>12. He then prepares a third (offering)--a cake</p>

 <p><a name="page_358"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 358</font></a></p>  
 <p>on twelve potsherds to Savit<i>ri</i> Satyaprasava ('of true impulse'); for that, indeed, is the true impulse which is Savit<i>ri</i>'s: 'May he impel with true impulse this my sacrifice!' so he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:13">13:4:2:13</a></font></span>13. For this (ish<i>t</i>i) there are again seventeen kindling-verses. The two butter-portions are possessed of 'wealth <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' with a view to his obtaining and securing vigour, for wealth is vigour (strength). [The verses, <i>Ri</i>g-veda V, 82, 7; IV, 54, 4,] 'The all-divine, true lord (we hope to gain this day by our hymns, Savit<i>ri</i> of true impulsion),' and 'Indestructible is that (work) of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, (that he will ever sustain the whole world: whatever he, the fair-fingered, bringeth forth over the extent of the earth and the expanse of the sky, that is truly his own),' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and offering formulas of the chief offering. Those of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (he makes) the regular ones <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">2</font></a>, thinking, 'Lest I should depart from the path of sacrifice:' he thus finally establishes himself in the well-ordered sacrifice. Trish<i>t</i>ubh-verses they are for the sake of his gaining and securing (Indra's) energy, vigour, for the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is the vigour in Indra. The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:14">13:4:2:14</a></font></span>14. Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish<i>t</i>i) are</p>

 <p>being performed, a Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune), sings three strophes composed by himself (on topics such as), 'Such a sacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:15">13:4:2:15</a></font></span>15. When this (offering) is completed, the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer rise, and whisper in the horse's right ear (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXII, 19), 'Plenteous by thy mother, strengthful by dry father . . .!' the meaning of this has been explained <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">1</font></a>. They then set it free towards the north-east, for that--to wit, the north-east--is the region of both gods and men: they thus consign it to its own region, in order to its suffering no injury, for one who is established in his own home suffers no injury.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:16">13:4:2:16</a></font></span>16. He says, 'O ye gods, guardians of the regions, guard ye this horse, consecrated for offering unto the gods!' The (four kinds of) human guardians of the (four) regions have been told, and these now are the divine ones, to wit, the Âpyas, Sâdhyas, Anvâdhyas <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">2</font></a> and Maruts; and both of these, gods and men, of one mind, guard it for a year without turning (driving) it back. The reason why they do not turn it back, is that it is he that shines yonder,--and who, forsooth, is able to turn him back? But were they to turn it back, everything here assuredly would go backward (go to ruin): therefore they guard it without turning it back.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:2:17">13:4:2:17</a></font></span>17. He says, 'Ye guardians of the quarters, those who go on to the end of this (horse-sacrifice) will</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a></p>  
 <p>become (sharers of) the royal power, they will become kings worthy of being consecrated; but those who do not go on to the end of this (sacrifice) will be excluded from royal power, they will not become kings, but nobles and peasants, unworthy of being consecrated: do not ye therefore be heedless, and keep it (the horse) from water suitable for bathing and from mares! And whenever ye meet with any kind of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, ask ye them, "O Brâhma<i>n</i>as, how much know ye of the A<i>s</i>vamedha?" and those who know naught thereof ye may despoil; for the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything, and he who, whilst being a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, knows naught of the A<i>s</i>vamedha, knows naught of anything, he is not a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and as such liable to be despoiled. Ye shall give it drink, and throw down fodder for it; and whatever prepared food there is in the country all that shall be prepared for you. Your abode shall be in the house of a carpenter of these (sacrificers <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">1</font></a>), for there is the horse's resting-place.'</p>
