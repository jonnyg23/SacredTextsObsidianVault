 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:1">12:8:1:1</a></font></span>1. Now, when Indra's energies, or vital powers, departed from him, the gods restored them by means of this very sacrifice. Both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor are filled: they thereby restore to him his energies, or vital powers. On the northern fire they offer (from) the cups of milk, and thereby provide him <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">1</font></a> with the bright liquor, with the Soma-drink.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:2">12:8:1:2</a></font></span>2. He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 32), 'By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice,'--the buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the sacrifice the sacrificer <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--'the barhis-seated one, supplied with Surâ and goodly heroes,' supplied with Surâ, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;--'they who bestow Soma,'--they thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;--'with the deities in heaven,'--they thus place him with the deities in heaven;--'may we enjoy ourselves,'--the Soma-juice, indeed, conduces</p>

 <p><a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a></p>  
 <p>to joy, and so does the Surâ-liquor: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Surâ he thus secures;--'worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!'--for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:3">12:8:1:3</a></font></span>3. He drinks <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">1</font></a> with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 34), 'The (Soma) which the A<i>s</i>vins (brought away) from Namu<i>k</i>i, the Asura,'--for the two A<i>s</i>vins indeed brought away that (Soma juice) from Namu<i>k</i>i;--'and Sarasvatî distilled for the sake of Indra's strength,'--for Sarasvatî indeed distilled it for the sake of Indra's strength;--'that clear, sweet draught,'--for clear and sweet indeed is that draught, Soma;--'King Soma I now drink,'--it is thus king Soma that comes to be drunk by him. The cups of Surâ-liquor they offer (from) on the southern fire <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and thereby keep him (the Sacrificer) from evil <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:4">12:8:1:4</a></font></span>4. He (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) offers (libations from the cups of Surâ-liquor <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">4</font></a>), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 33), 'What essence there is of thine, gathered from the plants,' for this Surâ-liquor, indeed, is the essence</p>

 <p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a></p>  
 <p>of both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and the plants he thus causes him to prosper;--'the strength of the Soma-juice together with the Surâ-liquor,'--he thereby secures what strength there is in the Soma-juice and in the Surâ-liquor;--'by that exhilarating drink quicken thou the Sacrificer,'--that is, 'by that exhilarating drink gladden thou the Sacrificer;'--'Sarasvatî, the A<i>s</i>vins, Indra, and Agni,'--by deities he (the priest) thus causes the sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and sacrifice the Sacrificer. Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor), and thereby cause to prosper what is unprosperous with him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:5">12:8:1:5</a></font></span>5. He drinks, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 35), 'Whatever is mingled herewith of the juicy Soma,'--he thereby secures for him the essence (juice) of the effused (extracted) and the infused <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">1</font></a> (Soma);--'which Indra drank with eagerness,'--for Indra, indeed, drank it with eagerness;--'that (essence) thereof (I drink) with propitious mind,'--for unpropitious, as it were, to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a is that drink, the Surâ-liquor: having thus made it propitious, he takes it to himself;--'King Soma I drink,'--it is thus king Soma that comes to be drunk by him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:6">12:8:1:6</a></font></span>6. Here, now, other Adhvaryus hire some Râ<i>g</i>anya or Vai<i>s</i>ya with the view that he shall drink that (liquor); but let him not do this; for, indeed, this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of whoever drinks (the liquor <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">2</font></a>) on</p>

 <p>this occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to outside the enclosing-stones <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three) utterances (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 36):--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:7">12:8:1:7</a></font></span>7. 'To the Svadhâ-loving Fathers be Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the Fathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the Fathers.--'To the Svadhâ-loving grandfathers he Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the grandfathers.--'To the Svadhâ-loving great-grandfathers be Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the great-grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the great-grandfathers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:8">12:8:1:8</a></font></span>8. Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, 'The Fathers have drunk:' he thereby bestows food on them;--'the Fathers have enjoyed themselves:' he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;--'the Fathers have become satisfied:' he thereby satisfies them;--'may the Fathers cleanse themselves!' he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is a means of purification <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:9">12:8:1:9</a></font></span>9. By three implements of purification he purifies,--three in number are these worlds: by means of these worlds he thus purifies him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:10">12:8:1:10</a></font></span>10. With 'pâvamânî <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">1</font></a> (verses)' they purify; for pâvamânîs are a means of purification: by a means of purification they thus purify him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:11">12:8:1:11</a></font></span>11. With three (verses) they purify each time,--there are three vital airs, the in-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is by means of these that they purify him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:12">12:8:1:12</a></font></span>12. With nine (verses) they purify,--there are nine vital airs: by means of the vital airs they purify him, and when purified they establish him again in the vital airs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:13">12:8:1:13</a></font></span>13. They purify by means of a (goat's hair and sheep's wool) strainer,--such a strainer doubtless is a form (symbol) of goats and sheep: by means of goats and sheep they thus purify him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:14">12:8:1:14</a></font></span>14. They purify by means of a tail-whisk,--such a tail-whisk doubtless is a form of kine and horses: with kine and horses they thus purify him.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:15">12:8:1:15</a></font></span>15. They purify by means of gold,--that (metal), to wit, gold, doubtless is a form of the gods: by means of a form of the gods they thus purify him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:16">12:8:1:16</a></font></span>16. They purify him by means of Surâ-liquor, for the Surâ is purified: they thus purify him by that which is purified; and even as the liquor, whilst being purified, is cleared of impure matter <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">1</font></a>, so is that Sacrificer thereby freed from all evil who, knowing this, performs the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, or who even knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:17">12:8:1:17</a></font></span>17. Here, now, they ask, 'Is the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î to be performed, or is it not to be performed, seeing that (in any case) they continuously repel from him all evil?' As to this Revottaras Sthapati Pâ<i>t</i>ava Kâkra once said, 'Even after making the surrender, one ought certainly to perform the sacrifice; for the Sacrificer is the body of the sacrifice, and the officiating priests are its limbs; and wherever the body is pure there the limbs also are pure; both of them, indeed, purify him, and both of them repel the evil from him: therefore even after making the surrender (of one's own self) one ought certainly to sacrifice.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:18">12:8:1:18</a></font></span>18. But, indeed, those who perform at the southern fire, go down to the world of the Fathers. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being (material of) sacrifice, it is by sacrifice that they establish themselves in the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:19">12:8:1:19</a></font></span>19. He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 45), 'The Fathers who, one in form and one in mind, live in Yama's realm,--may their world,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 237</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Svadhâ, adoration, and sacrifice prosper among the gods!' he thereby commits the Fathers to Yama, and he also conquers the world of the Fathers. Having, all of them, invested themselves sacrificially <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">1</font></a>, they betake themselves to the northern fire, for the northern fire <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">2</font></a> is this (terrestrial) world <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">3</font></a>: they thus establish themselves in this world. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being sacrifice, it is from out of the sacrifice that they establish themselves in the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:20">12:8:1:20</a></font></span>20. He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 46), 'Mine own (people) who are one in form and one in mind, living among the living,--may their fortune prosper with me, in this world, for a hundred years!' he thereby secures the good fortune of his own people, and he also confers long life on them. Whilst they hold on to each other, he (the Adhvaryu) offers milk, for milk is vital air and food: in the vital air, in food, they thus finally establish themselves.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:21">12:8:1:21</a></font></span>21. He offers, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 47), 'Two paths for mortals have I heard of, (that of the Fathers and that of the gods <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">4</font></a>),'--'two paths</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a></p>  
 <p>indeed there are,' they say, 'those of the gods and of the Fathers,'--'thereon all that liveth here passeth,' for thereon, indeed, everything living here passes;--'what there is between the father and the mother,'--the father, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the mother is this (earth): by means of these two he leads the Fathers to the world of heaven. He (the Sacrificer) alone drinks what is left from the offering <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">1</font></a>: to himself alone he thus takes prosperity, for milk is prosperity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:1:22">12:8:1:22</a></font></span>22. He drinks it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 48), 'May this oblation be productive for me,'--for productive indeed it is, whether it be milk or Soma;--'possessed of ten heroes,'--the ten heroes, doubtless, are the vital airs: vital airs he thus takes to himself;--'possessed of all the troops,'--all the troops, doubtless, are the limbs: it is limbs he thus takes to himself;--'for well-being: breath-winning,'--the breath of life he thus wins;--'race-winning,'--a race (offspring) he thus wins;--'cattle-winning,'--cattle he thus wins;--'place-winning'--for it is for a place (in heaven) that he sacrifices: it is that he gains;--'safety-winning,'--the (place of) safety, doubtless, is the heavenly world: in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes himself;--'May Agni raise for me abundant offspring,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p>and bestow ye upon us food, milk, and seed!' it is to those (priests) who offer for him that he thus says, 'Bestow ye all this upon me!' By means of gold they cleanse themselves <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for gold is immortal life: in immortal life they thus finally establish themselves.</p>

According to Kâty. XIX, 3, 17, and Mahîdhara on Vâ<i>g</i>. S.
