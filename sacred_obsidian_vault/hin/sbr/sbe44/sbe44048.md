 <p>feet (men) go forward (prayanti): that part of them which is white is of the form of the day, and that which is black is (of the form) of the night; the nails are of the form of herbs and trees.

Thus that year is established in respect of the body; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that year to be established in respect of the body, establishes himself by means of offspring and cattle in this, and by immortality in the other, world.</p>
