 <p>against the gods, O divine gods, we have committed, from that sin may Agni deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--he thereby delivers him from the sin committed against the gods.--'Whether by day, whether by night we have committed sins, from that sin may Vâyu deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--he thereby delivers him from whatever sin he commits by day and night.---'Whether waking, whether in sleep we have committed sins, from that sin may Sûrya deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--what is awake is men, and what is asleep is the Fathers: he thus delivers him from guilt against men and Fathers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:9:2:3">12:9:2:3</a></font></span>3. 'Whatever sin we have committed in the village, in the forest'--for either in the village or in the forest sin is committed: therefrom he delivers him;--'whatever in the assembly'--from the sin of the assembly he thereby delivers him;--'whatever in our organs of sense'--from the sin against the gods he thereby delivers him;--'whatever against the <i>S</i>ûdra or the Arya, whatever against the right of any one, thereof thou art the expiation,'--from all that sin he thereby delivers him.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'O laving bath, laving thou glidest along,'--the bath, indeed, is that whirlpool (now produced) in the water, and that indeed is either Varu<i>n</i>a's son or brother: it is him he thereby praises;--'with the help of the gods have I expiated <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">1</font></a> the sin committed against gods,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed against gods;--'with the help of mortals that committed against mortals,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed against mortals;--'preserve me, O God, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me against all inflictions!'</p>

'In the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart,'--for the ocean is the waters, and water is sap: with that sap he thus supplies him;--'may the plants and waters unite with thee!'--he thereby supplies him with both kinds of sap, that which is in plants, and that which is in water--He goes two steps northward from out (of the water); for as much as the step is the briskness in man: with what briskness there is in him he thus leaves evil behind him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:9:2:6">12:9:2:6</a></font></span>6. With, 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water in his joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a covenant with the thunderbolt;--and with, 'May they he unfriendly unto him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction he who is hateful to him may be, and he thereby discomfits him.</p>

He bathes, and (thereby) drives the darkness (of sin) from himself.</p>

He walks along without looking back, and approaches the Âhavanîya,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:9:2:9">12:9:2:9</a></font></span>9. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:9:2:10">12:9:2:10</a></font></span>10. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 23), 'A kindler thou art:</p>

 <p>may we prosper <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' he takes a kindling-stick, for a kindler of Agni (the fire) the kindling-stick indeed is. With, 'Enkindling thou art, fire thou art: lay thou fire into me!' he puts the kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya: he thereby kindles the fire, and, thus kindled, it kindles him with fire (energy) <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:9:2:11">12:9:2:11</a></font></span>11. Being about to offer a pap to Aditi <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he prepares it: Aditi being this (earth), he who offers Aditi's (pap) performs the sacrifice on this (earth), and by offering firmly establishes himself thereon. The sacrificial fee is a milch cow (with calf): the milch cow being this (earth), he milks out from the latter all his desires. The calf he gives away at the former (pap-offering to Aditi <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">4</font></a>), and the mother-cow at the latter; for when a calf sucks the mother-cow, the latter gives milk when she is given away, and from her, when given away, he thus milks all his desires.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:9:2:12">12:9:2:12</a></font></span>12. As to this they say, 'Surely, he who goes down to the water for the purificatory bath falls away from this world!' Well, when he has come out from the bath, he offers a dish of curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a; now Mitra is this (terrestrial) world,</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Varu<i>n</i>a yonder world, and the dish of curds is what there is here between (those two): thus, when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, he establishes himself in these worlds. And Mitra, indeed, is the in-breathing, Varu<i>n</i>a the off-breathing, and the dish of curds the food: thus when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, he finally establishes himself in the vital air, in food.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_661"></a><a href="sbe44072.htm#fr_665">265:1</a> Cf. III, 8, 5, 10, where the text varies slightly--'That they say, we swear by the Inviolable (cows, or waters), by Varu<i>n</i>a, therefrom deliver us, O Varu<i>n</i>a!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_662"></a><a href="sbe44072.htm#fr_666">266:1</a> Cf. II, 5, 2, 47; IV, 4, 5, 22, where the formula has 'ava ayâsisham' (correct,--'with the help of the gods have I wiped out the sin committed against the gods') instead of 'ava yakshi.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_663"></a><a href="sbe44072.htm#fr_667">267:1</a> Having put on fresh garments, the Sacrificer and his wife are led out by the Unnet<i>ri</i>, the mantra being muttered at the same time; and they then return with the priests to the offering-ground, whilst the Âmatrîyâ-hymn (on <i>Ri</i>g-veda S. VIII, 48, 3, 'we have drunk Soma . . .') is sung: see part ii, p. 385, note 2; Kâty. <i>S</i>raut. X, 9, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_664"></a><a href="sbe44072.htm#fr_668">267:2</a> Mahîdhara takes 'svar' in the sense of 'svarga,' heaven; whilst the Brâhma<i>n</i>a seems rather to take it as referring to the earth or dry land on which the Sacrificer now steps.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_665"></a><a href="sbe44072.htm#fr_669">268:1</a> The text of the formula 'edho<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>sy edhishîmahi' is evidently meant to suggest a connection (real or alliterative) between 'edha' (root 'indh') and the final verb (root 'edh').</p>
 <p><a name="fn_666"></a><a href="sbe44072.htm#fr_670">268:2</a> According to Kâty. XIX, 5, 20, and Mahîdhara, he now offers on the kindling-stick an oblation of ghee, with the text, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 23, 'Hither come the earth, the dawn, the sun, and all this world.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_668"></a><a href="sbe44072.htm#fr_672">268:4</a> This offering takes place at the beginning of the performance of the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, cf. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XIX, 1, 5-10. The dish of curds which according to this paragraph is to follow the second pap to Aditi, may, according to Kâtyâyana, be offered before it.</p>
