When the victims have been bound (to the stakes), the Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water in order to sprinkle the horse. Whilst the Sacrificer holds on to him behind, he (in sprinkling the horse) runs rapidly through the formula used at the Soma-sacrifice <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and then commences the one for the A<i>s</i>vamedha.</p>

XXIII, 13,] 'May Vâyu favour thee with cooked kinds of food <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">3</font></a>,'--Vâyu (the wind) indeed cooks it <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">4</font></a>;--'the dark-necked one with he-goats,'--the dark-necked one, doubtless,</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:7:3">13:2:7:3</a></font></span>3. 'The Nyagrodha with cups,'--for when the gods were performing sacrifice, they tilted over those Soma-cups, and, turned downwards, they took root, whence the Nyagrodhas (ficus indica), when turned downwards (nya<i>k</i>), take root (roha <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">1</font></a>).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:7:4">13:2:7:4</a></font></span>4. 'The cotton-tree with growth,'--he confers growth on the cotton-tree (salmalia malabarica), whence the cotton-tree grows largest amongst trees <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:7:5">13:2:7:5</a></font></span>5. 'This male, fit for the chariot,'--he supplies the chariot with a horse, whence the horse draws nothing else than a chariot.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:7:6">13:2:7:6</a></font></span>6. 'Hath come hither on his four feet,'--therefore the horse, when standing, stands on three feet, but, when harnessed, it pulls with all its feet at one and the same time.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:7:7">13:2:7:7</a></font></span>7. 'May the spotless Brahman protect us!'--the spotless <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">3</font></a> Brahman (m.), doubtless, is the moon:</p>

XXIII, 14,] 'Trimmed up is the car with the cord,'--with cord one indeed completes the car <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whence a car, when enveloped (with cords <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">2</font></a>), is very handsome.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:7:9">13:2:7:9</a></font></span>9. 'Trimmed up is the steed with the rein,'--with the rein one indeed completes the horse, whence the horse, when curbed by the rein, looks most beautiful.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:7:10">13:2:7:10</a></font></span>10. 'Trimmed up in the waters was the water-born,'--the horse, indeed, has sprung from the womb of the waters <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">3</font></a>: with its own (mother's) womb he thus supplies it;--'Brahman (m.), with Soma for his leader,'--he thus makes it go to heaven with Soma for its leader.</p>

 <p>here, neither suffer harm,'--he thereby cheers it;--'on easy paths thou goest to the gods,'--he thereby shows him the paths leading to the gods;--'where dwell the pious, whither they have gone,'--he thereby makes it one who shares the same world with the pious;--'thither the god Savit<i>ri</i> shall lead thee,'--it is, indeed, Savit<i>ri</i> that leads him to the heavenly world.--Whilst whispering <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">1</font></a> 'I sprinkle thee, acceptable unto Pra<i>g</i>âpati,' he then holds (the sprinkling water) under (its mouth).</p>

Having satisfied the horse, and consecrated again the sprinkling water, he sprinkles the other victims: thereof hereafter.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_803"></a><a href="sbe44088.htm#fr_807">316:1</a> Here the original text in Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 12, has simply 'the pi<i>s</i>aṅgilâ was the night.' Mahîdhara explains 'pi<i>s</i>aṅgilâ' by 'pi<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>gila,' 'beauty-devouring,' inasmuch as the night swallows, or conceals, all beauty (or form). Neither this nor the other explanation (= pi<i>s</i>aṅga, ruddy-brown) suits the day; but Harisvâmin, who does not explain the name, remarks that the night here is taken to include the day. Cf. <a href="sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:18">XIII, 5, 2, 18</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_804"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_808">316:2</a> Viz. Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 9; see III, 7, 4, 4-5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_805"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_809">316:3</a> The author seems to take 'pa<i>k</i>atai<i>h</i>' in the sense of 'cooking.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_807"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_811">317:1</a> Or, whence the Nyagrodhas grow downwards. This refers to the habit of the Indian fig-tree, of sending down from the branches numerous slender roots which afterwards become fresh stems. Cp. the corresponding legend in Ait. Br. VII, 30, told there by way of explaining why Kshatriyas, being forbidden to drink Soma, should drink the juice extracted from the descending roots of the Indian fig-tree. Another reason why the Indian fig-tree (also called 'va<i>t</i>a') is here connected with the priests’ Soma-cups (<i>k</i>amasa), is that this is one of the kinds of wood used in making those cups (cf. Katy, I, 3, 36 comm.).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_808"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_812">317:2</a> According to Stewart and Brandis, Forest Flora, p. 31, the cotton-tree (or silk-cotton tree) is a very large tree of rapid growth, attaining a height of 150 ft., and a girth of 40 ft.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_809"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_813">317:3</a> Lit. 'the non-black Brahman,' explained as one who has no black spots; though it is difficult to see why the moon should be favoured with this epithet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_810"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_814">318:1</a> In Indian vehicles the different parts are held together by cords. For a drawing see Sir H. M. Elliot, The Races of the N.W. Provinces. of India, II, p. 342. The word for 'cord' and 'rein' is the same in Sanskrit.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_811"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_815">318:2</a> Paryuta<i>h</i> = parivesh<i>t</i>ito ra<i>g</i><i>g</i>ubhi<i>h</i>, comm.; hardly 'hung all round (with ornaments),' as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_814"></a><a href="sbe44089.htm#fr_818">319:1</a> Cp. I, 4, 5, 12: 'Hence whatever at the sacrifice is performed for Pra<i>g</i>âpati, that is performed in a low voice (under the breath); for speech would not act as oblation-bearer for Pra<i>g</i>âpati.' Pra<i>g</i>âpati, as representing generation, is often spoken of as 'undefined' or 'unexpressed (secret)'; and so is what is muttered in a low voice.</p>
