 <p>the northern country. By him a gold coin was offered; for in the time of our forefathers a prize used to be offered by chosen (priests) when driving about, for the sake of calling out the timid <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">1</font></a> to a disputation. Fear then seized the Brâhma<i>n</i>as of the northern people:--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:2">11:4:1:2</a></font></span>2. 'This fellow is a Kurupa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âla Brahman, and son of a Brahman--let us take care lest he should deprive us of our domain: come, let us challenge him to a disputation on spiritual matters.'--'With whom for our champion?'--'With Svaidâyana.' Svaidâyana, to wit, was <i>S</i>aunaka.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:3">11:4:1:3</a></font></span>3. They said, 'Svaidâyana, with thee as our champion we will fight this fellow.' He said, 'Well, then, stay ye here quietly: I will just make his acquaintance <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' He went up to him, and when he had come up, he (Uddâlaka) greeted him saying,</p>

 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'Svaidâyana!'--'Halloo, son of Gautama!' replied the other, and straightway, began to question him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:4">11:4:1:4</a></font></span>4. 'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen (offering-priest), who knows in the Full and New-moon sacrifices eight butter-portions (offered) previously, five portions of sacrificial food in the middle, six (portions) of Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:6">11:4:1:6</a></font></span>6. 'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices, whereby creatures here are born with hair; whereby, for the second time, as it were, the hair of the beard and the arm-pits and other parts of the body <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">2</font></a> grow on them; whereby it is on the head that one first</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:7">11:4:1:7</a></font></span>7. 'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices whereby the seed of the boy is not productive, whereby in his middle age it is productive, and whereby again in his last stage of life it is not productive;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:8">11:4:1:8</a></font></span>8. 'And he who knows the golden, brilliant-winged Gâyatrî who bears the Sacrificer to the heavenly world.' Then he (Uddâlaka) gave up to him the gold coin, saying, 'Thou art learned, Svaidâyana; and, verily, gold is given unto him who knows gold;' and he (Svaidâyana), having concealed it <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">1</font></a>, went away. They asked him, 'How did that son of Gautama behave?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:9">11:4:1:9</a></font></span>9. He said, 'Even as a Brahman, and the son of a Brahman: the head would fly off of whosoever should (dare to) challenge him to a disputation <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' They then went away in all directions. He (Uddâlaka) then came back to him, with fire-wood</p>

 <p>in his hand <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and said, 'I want to become thy pupil.'--'What wouldst thou study?'--'Even those questions which thou didst ask me--explain them to me!' He said, 'I will tell them to thee even without thy becoming my pupil.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:10">11:4:1:10</a></font></span>10. And he then spoke thus to him:--The two libations of ghee, the five fore-offerings, and, eighth, Agni's butter-portion--these are the eight butter-portions (offered) previously. Soma's butter-portion, being the first of the portions of sacrificial food--for Soma is sacrificial food,---Agni's cake, Agni-Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni-Soma's cake, and (the offering to) Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t--these are the five portions of sacrificial food in the middle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:11">11:4:1:11</a></font></span>11. The fore-portion, the I<i>d</i>â, what he hands to the Agnîdh <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Brahman's portion, the Sacrificer's portion, and the Anvâhârya (mess of rice)--these are the six (portions) of Pra<i>g</i>âpati. The three after-offerings, the four Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as, and, eighth, the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us--these are the eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:12">11:4:1:12</a></font></span>12. And inasmuch as the fore-offerings are without invitatory formulas <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">3</font></a>, therefore creatures are horn here without teeth; and inasmuch as the chief oblations have invitatory formulas, therefore they (the teeth) grow in them; and inasmuch as the after-offerings are without invitatory formulas, therefore they (the teeth) decay in them; and inasmuch as the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as as have invitatory formulas,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>therefore they (the teeth) come to remain permanently with them; and inasmuch as the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us is without invitatory formula, therefore they all decay again in the last stage of life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:13">11:4:1:13</a></font></span>13. And inasmuch as, after uttering the invitatory formula, he offers with the offering-formula, therefore the lower (teeth) grow first, then the upper ones; and inasmuch as, after uttering a gâyatrî verse as invitatory formula, he offers with a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">1</font></a>, therefore the lower (teeth) are smaller, and the upper ones broader; and inasmuch as he pours out the two libations of ghee in a forward direction <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">2</font></a>, therefore the incisors are larger; and inasmuch as the two sa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>yâs <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">3</font></a> are in the same metre, therefore the molars are of equal size.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:14">11:4:1:14</a></font></span>14. And inasmuch as he spreads a cover of sacrificial grass (on the Vedi), therefore creatures here are born with hair; and inasmuch as he for the second time, as it were, spreads the Prastara-bunch <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">4</font></a>, therefore, for the second time, as it were, the hair of the beard and the arm-pits, and other parts of the body grow; and inasmuch as at first he only throws the Prastara-bunch after (the oblations into the fire), therefore it is on the head that one first becomes grey; and inasmuch as he then throws after it all the sacrificial grass of the altar-ground, therefore,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the last stage of life, one again becomes grey all over.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:15">11:4:1:15</a></font></span>15. And inasmuch as the fore-offerings have ghee for their offering-material, a boy's seed is not productive, but is like water, for ghee is like water; and inasmuch as, in the middle of the sacrifice, they sacrifice with sour curds <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">1</font></a> and with cake, therefore it is productive in his middle stage of life, for thick-flowing, as it were, is (that havis), and thick-flowing, as it were, is seed; and inasmuch as the after-offerings have ghee for their offering-material, it again is not productive in his last stage of life, and is like water, for ghee, indeed, is like water.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:4:1:16">11:4:1:16</a></font></span>16. The Vedi (altar-ground), doubtless, is the Gâyatrî: the eight butter-portions (offered) previously are her right wing, and the eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently are her left wing: that same golden, brilliant-winged Gâyatrî, indeed, bears the Sacrificer who knows this to the heavenly world.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_191"></a><a href="sbe44021.htm#fr_191">50:4</a> Prof. Geldner takes 'dhâvayâ<i>m</i> <i>k</i>akâra<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> in a causal sense <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a>, 'er verursachte einen Anflauf' (he caused people to crowd together, or to come to him in crowds). Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, takes it in the same sense as we have. done,--ârtvi<i>g</i>yâya v<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i> sann udagde<i>s</i>ân <i>g</i>agâma. The Gopatha-Br., further on, has the remark 'sa vai gotamasya putra ûrdhva<i>m</i> v<i>ri</i>to<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>dhâvît' (!).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_192"></a><a href="sbe44021.htm#fr_192">51:1</a> It is by no means certain whether the interpretation of the paragraph as here adapted is the right one. Prof. Geldner takes it thus,--'He (Udd.) had taken a gold piece with him; for in times of old the chosen (priests) who caused a crowd to gather round them, used to take a single gold piece with them with a view to their proposing a riddle (or problem) whenever they were afraid.' The Gopatha-Br. has a different reading, which is likewise far from clear:--tasya ha nishka upâhito babhûva, upavâdâd bibhyato yo ma brâhma<i>n</i>o<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nû<i>k</i>âna upavadishyati tasmâ etam pradâsyâmîti;--by him a gold coin was offered (? by him a gold plate had been put on, i.e. was worn round the neck) being afraid of obloquy (?): 'I shall give this to any learned Brahman who will speak up against me,' thus (he thought).</p>

In the St. Petersb. Dict. the meaning 'bristly' is assigned to it, as applied to the hair of the beard.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_196"></a><a href="sbe44021.htm#fr_196">53:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a takes 'upaguhya' in the sense of 'having embraced (him),' that being the meaning the verb has in classical Sanskrit;--ta<i>m</i> Svaidâyanam upaguhya âliṅgya Uddâlakas tasmât sthânân ni<i>s</i><i>k</i>akrâma nishkrântavân. The Gopatha-Br. has 'tad upayamya' (having taken it) instead. Svaidâyana evidently did not wish the other Brahmans to know that he had had the better of the Kurupa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âla.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_199"></a><a href="sbe44021.htm#fr_199">54:2</a> Viz. the 'sha<i>d</i>avatta,' or share consisting of six 'cuttings,' for which see I, 8, 1, 41 with note.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_201"></a><a href="sbe44021.htm#fr_201">55:1</a> Whilst the gâyatrî verse consists of 3 × 8 syllables, the trish<i>t</i>ubh has 4 × 11 syllables.</p>

The 'iti' after 'puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>ena' is taken by Sâya<i>n</i>a in the sense of '<i>k</i>a'; and though this cannot be accepted, it is not very easy to see what force it can have here.</p>
