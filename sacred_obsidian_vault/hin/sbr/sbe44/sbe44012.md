He recites a gâyatrî invitatory formula <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">1</font></a>: the gâyatrî consisting of three feet, these worlds being three in number <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">2</font></a>, it is these worlds the gods thereby established.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:2:2">11:2:2:2</a></font></span>2. He offers with a trish<i>t</i>ubh (verse): the trish<i>t</i>ubh consisting of four feet, and cattle being four-footed, it is cattle the gods thereby established in these established worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:2:3">11:2:2:3</a></font></span>3. The Vasha<i>t</i>-call consists of two syllables (vausha<i>t</i>): man being two-footed; it is two-footed man they thereby established among the established cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:2:4">11:2:2:4</a></font></span>4. Two-footed man, then, is established here among cattle. In like manner this (Sacrificer) establishes thereby the worlds; and in the established worlds he establishes cattle, and among the established cattle he establishes himself: thus, indeed, is that man established among cattle, who, knowing this, offers sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:2:5">11:2:2:5</a></font></span>5. And when he offers, after the Vasha<i>t</i> has been uttered,--that Vasha<i>t</i>-call being yonder shining (sun), and he being the same as Death <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">3</font></a>--he thereby consecrates him (the Sacrificer) after death, and causes him to be born from out of it, and he is</p>

 <p>delivered from that death. And the sacrifice, indeed, becomes his body: thus, having become the sacrifice, he is delivered from that death, and all his chief offerings are thereby delivered from that death <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:2:6">11:2:2:6</a></font></span>6. And, verily, whatever offering he there performs, that offering becomes his body in yonder world; and when he who knows this departs this world then that offering, being behind him, calls out to him, 'Come hither, here I am, thy body;' and inasmuch as it calls out (invokes, âhvayati), it is called 'âhuti' (offering or invocation).</p>
