Verily, man is born thrice, namely in this way:--first he is born from his mother and father; and when he to whom the sacrifice inclines performs offering he is born a second time; and when he dies, and they place him on the fire, and when he</p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p>thereupon comes into existence again, he is born a third time;--wherefore they say, 'Man is born thrice.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:1:2">11:2:1:2</a></font></span>2. He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites those eleven kindling-verses <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--there are these ten vital airs in man, and the body in which these vital airs are established is the eleventh,--so great, indeed, is man: he thus causes him to be born complete. And what comes after the kindling-verses that is the foundation: thus, having caused him to be born, he establishes him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:1:3">11:2:1:3</a></font></span>3. There are nine utterances of impulsion (or quickening) <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--there are these nine vital airs in man: he thereby causes him to be born a second time; and the (Adhvaryu's) call and (the Âgnîdhra's) response <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">3</font></a> are the foundation. And when there, on the occasion of the throwing <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">4</font></a> (of the grass-bunch</p>

 <p>into the fire), birth is spoken of, he thereby causes him to be born a third time: on this occasion the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">1</font></a> are the foundation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:1:4">11:2:1:4</a></font></span>4. For thrice, indeed, man is born, and it is just in this way that he causes him to be born thrice from the sacrifice. Of those eleven (kindling-verses) he recites thrice the first and last:--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:1:5">11:2:1:5</a></font></span>5. This makes fifteen kindling-verses,--there are two libations of ghee (âghâra <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">2</font></a>), five fore-offerings, the I<i>d</i>â, three after-offerings, the Sûktavâka, and <i>S</i>amyorvâka <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">3</font></a>--that makes thirteen oblations. And when there, at the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as, he takes up at the same time (the two spoons); and the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">4</font></a>:--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:1:6">11:2:1:6</a></font></span>6. That makes fifteen oblations:--for these fifteen oblations those fifteen kindling-verses (serve, as it were, as) invitatory formulas; and for these invitatory formulas these (serve as) offering-formulas--whatever formula (is used) there (at those oblations) and what Nigada (is used at the invocation of the I<i>d</i>â <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">5</font></a>) that is of the form of offering-formulas. Thereby, then, those oblations of his come to be supplied with invitatory formulas through those kindling-verses; and through those oblations those invitatory formulas come to be supplied with both offering-formulas and oblations.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="sbe44011.htm#fr_124">24:2</a> According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, this refers either to the formula by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the kindling-verses, and which, he says, consists of nine syllables (samidhyamânâyânubrûhi); or to nine preliminary formulas (forming a nigada) pronounced by the Hot<i>ri</i> before the performance of the fore-offerings, see I, 5, 2, 1 seqq. These latter formulas are probably those intended by the author; the former formula being the less likely to be referred to, as, in its above form of nine syllables, it is indeed allowed to be used optionally by the Âpastambasûtra, but not by the authorities of the white Ya<i>g</i>us, who use the formula '(Hotar) Agnaye samidhyamânâyânubrûhi;' see <i>S</i>at. Br. I, 3, 5, 2. 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="sbe44011.htm#fr_125">24:3</a> Viz. the two calls--'O<i>m</i> <i>s</i>râvaya' and 'Astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>,' see part i, p. 132, note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_126"></a><a href="sbe44011.htm#fr_126">24:4</a> The word 's<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i' usually means 'creation,' but in accordance with the primary meaning of the verb 's<i>ri</i><i>g</i>,' it apparently refers here (as Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to think) to the throwing of the anointed Prastara, as the representative of the Sacrificer, into the Âhavanîya fire, thus insuring for the Sacrificer his despatch to, and renewed life in, the heavenly world. With reference to <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a> this throwing of the grass-bunch into the fire (I, 8, 3, 11 seq.; 9, 2, 19) some of the Sûtras use, indeed, the verb 's<i>ri</i><i>g</i>,' cf.
