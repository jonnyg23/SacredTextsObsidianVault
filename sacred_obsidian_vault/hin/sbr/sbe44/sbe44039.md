Such a (sacrificial stake) as has much substance <a name="fr_384"></a><a href="#fn_384"><font size="1">1</font></a> is not auspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should not make such a one his sacrificial stake: but such a one as is of little hardness is auspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should make such a one his sacrificial stake.</p>

And such a one as is bent at the top, and bent outwards <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the middle, is a type of hunger (poverty); and if any one makes such a one his sacrificial stake, his dependants will certainly be hungry; therefore let no one wishing for food make such a one his sacrificial stake. But such a one as is bent at the top and bent inwards in the middle, is a type of food (prosperity): therefore let him who wishes for food make such a one his sacrificial stake.</p>
