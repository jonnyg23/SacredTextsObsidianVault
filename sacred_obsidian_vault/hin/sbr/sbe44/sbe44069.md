 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:1">12:8:2:1</a></font></span>1. Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the (Soma-)sacrifice. He took it and performed it. When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw this sacrificial performance, the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, and performed it, and then he was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice is, as it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it were, taken from him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:2">12:8:2:2</a></font></span>2. Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î: as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so, indeed, does he replenish himself,--he replenishes himself by offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, or he who (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins the heavenly world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:3">12:8:2:3</a></font></span>3. As to this Suplan Sâr<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya asked Pratîdar<i>s</i>a Aibhâvata <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">2</font></a>, 'Seeing that neither does one</p>

 <p>become initiated, nor are Soma-shoots <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">1</font></a> thrown down (to be pressed), how then does the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î become a Soma-sacrifice?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:4">12:8:2:4</a></font></span>4. He replied, 'The observance of the fast, assuredly, is the head of the sacrifice, and the initiation its body. And the truth, doubtless, is of the form of the fast-observance, and faith of that of the initiation. And mind is of the form of the Sacrificer, and speech of that of the sacrifice.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:5">12:8:2:5</a></font></span>5. Thus, when he enters upon the fast-observance, he thereby restores the head to the body of the sacrifice, and he puts truth into faith, and the Sacrificer into the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:6">12:8:2:6</a></font></span>6. Therefore at this sacrifice (the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î) the fast-observance <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">2</font></a> is the initiation. Now, the fast-observance is a male, and the initiation a female; and the truth is a male, and faith a female; and the mind is a male, and speech a female; and the Sacrificer is the male to his wife, whence wherever there is a husband there is a wife: and at the very outset of the sacrifice he thus sets up couples with a view to production.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:7">12:8:2:7</a></font></span>7. 'And, indeed, those (materials) are the Soma-shoots at this sacrifice,' they say, 'to wit, the malted rice, the malted barley, and the fried rice.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:8">12:8:2:8</a></font></span>8. The malted rice <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">3</font></a>, indeed, is of the form of the</p>

 <p>morning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world, and the latter relates to the A<i>s</i>vins, and Â<i>s</i>vina milk he pours (into the Surâ-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the Sacrificer <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">1</font></a>) with the morning-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:9">12:8:2:9</a></font></span>9. And the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for the midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvatî <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the Sârasvata milk he pours (into the Surâ) the second night: he thus provides him with the midday-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:10">12:8:2:10</a></font></span>10. And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for the evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra milk he pours (into the Surâ) the third night: he thus provides him with the evening-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:11">12:8:2:11</a></font></span>11. The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Surâ) the first night, the milk of two the second</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:12">12:8:2:12</a></font></span>12. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIX, 2), 'Hereof pour ye to the juice,' he pours in (the milk) for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing;--'(to) the Soma who is the supreme offering,'--for this, to wit, Soma, is indeed the supreme offering (-material): he thus makes it <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">1</font></a> to be the supreme offering;--'the manly one who hath rushed into the waters,' for both with water and between it is he (Soma) indeed pressed out;--'I have pressed out Soma by stones,' for by means of stones Soma is indeed pressed out: it is thus by means of stones he presses it out for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:13">12:8:2:13</a></font></span>13. As to this they say, ‘That Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, surely, is of the form of both effused (extracted) and infused <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">2</font></a> (Soma);--to wit, that essence of both water and plants, the milk, is of the form of the effused (Soma); and that essence of food, the liquor, is of the form of infused (Soma): by both (kinds of) pressings he thus expresses it, by both pressings he secures it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:14">12:8:2:14</a></font></span>14. As to this they say, 'Seeing that the Soma-juice is pressed out by stones, how as to the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î?'

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Âprî-verses;' for the directions (praisha) are in the B<i>ri</i>hatî (metre), and the pressing-stones are of bârhata nature: by means of stones the Soma-juice is indeed pressed out, and by means of stones he now presses it out for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:15">12:8:2:15</a></font></span>15. All (the praishas) contain (the word) 'payas' (milk), for in the form of milk Soma is (here) pressed <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">1</font></a>; they all contain (the word) 'Soma,' for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word) 'parisrut' (spirituous liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) 'gh<i>ri</i>ta' (ghee), for this--to wit, ghee--doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word) 'madhu' (honey), for this--to wit, honey--is manifestly a form of Soma: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:16">12:8:2:16</a></font></span>16. They all refer to the A<i>s</i>vins <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for the sake of healing-power <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">3</font></a>; they all refer to Sarasvatî, for the obtainment of food; they all refer to Indra, for the obtainment of energy, or vital power.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:17">12:8:2:17</a></font></span>17. And, again, as to why they all refer to the A<i>s</i>vins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra,--these, indeed, were the deities who first</p>

 <p>prepared this sacrifice (the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î); with the help of these deities he thus prepares it; and, besides, he also provides these deities with a share.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:18">12:8:2:18</a></font></span>18. The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and relate to the same deities,--for the sake of continuity and uninterruptedness of the race (offspring). All of them relate to the A<i>s</i>vins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:19">12:8:2:19</a></font></span>19. The Âprî-formulas <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">2</font></a> are anush<i>t</i>ubh verses; for the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and with speech Soma is pressed: he thus presses it with speech, for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-sacrifice. All of them relate to the A<i>s</i>vins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>

 <p><i>g</i>âgata metre; for the <i>G</i>agatî is this (earth), and by means of her Soma is pressed: by means of her he thus presses it for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing. All of them relate to the A<i>s</i>vins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:21">12:8:2:21</a></font></span>21. This Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ish<i>t</i>i-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:22">12:8:2:22</a></font></span>22. The Adhvaryus <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">1</font></a> drink (the contents of) the Â<i>s</i>vina (cup), for the A<i>s</i>vins are the Adhvaryus of the gods: they thus consume each his own share in his own abode.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:23">12:8:2:23</a></font></span>23. The Hot<i>ri</i>, Brahman, and Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a (drink that) of the Sârasvata (cup), for the Hot<i>ri</i> is the voice of the sacrifice, the Brahman its heart, and the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a its mind: they thus consume each his own share in his own abode.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:24">12:8:2:24</a></font></span>24. The Sacrificer drinks (that of) the Aindra (cup), for this sacrifice, the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has his abode along with Indra: he thus consumes his own share in his own abode.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:25">12:8:2:25</a></font></span>25. The Â<i>s</i>vina cup, indeed, is the eye, the Sârasvata one the vital air, and the Aindra one</p>

 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>speech. From the Â<i>s</i>vina (cup) he pours (the remains) into the Sârasvata one, whereby he combines his eye with the vital airs; from the Sârasvata cup) into the Aindra one, whereby he combines his vital airs with his speech, and also establishes his vital airs in (the channel of) speech, whence all the vital airs are established on speech.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:26">12:8:2:26</a></font></span>26. Three (men) drink the Â<i>s</i>vina (cup), to wit, the Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, and Agnîdh; for this eye is threefold--the white, the black, and the pupil: he thus bestows on him the eye in accordance with its form.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:27">12:8:2:27</a></font></span>27. Three (drink) the Sârasvata (cup), the Hot<i>ri</i>, Brahman, and Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a; for threefold divided is this vital air--the in (and out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: he thus bestows on him the vital air in accordance with its form.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:28">12:8:2:28</a></font></span>28. Singly the Sacrificer drinks the Aindra (cup), for single is that distinction of the vital airs, speech: singly and solely to himself does he take that distinction, speech; whence he who has performed the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î becomes singly and solely the most distinguished among his own people, and so does even he who knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:29">12:8:2:29</a></font></span>29. The officiating priests (<i>ri</i>tvi<i>g</i>), doubtless, are the seasons (<i>ri</i>tu), and the draughts (of liquor) are the months;--six priests drink, for there are six seasons: by means of the priests he thus secures the seasons.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:30">12:8:2:30</a></font></span>30. There are twelve draughts <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and twelve</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>months: by means of the draughts he thus secures the months. The priests drink again and again by turns, whence the seasons and months succeed one another by turns.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:31">12:8:2:31</a></font></span>31. The thirteenth draught the Sacrificer takes, for, indeed, that thirteenth month is manifestly the year itself: it is this he secures by obtaining (that draught). And, indeed, the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is the same as the year, and by means of this he wins everything, and secures everything for himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:32">12:8:2:32</a></font></span>32. There are three victims, for three in number are these worlds: it is these worlds he thereby secures,--to wit, this (terrestrial) world by that of the A<i>s</i>vins, the air by that of Sarasvatî, and the sky by that of Indra: he thus wins and secures these worlds for himself in accordance with their (peculiar) form and deity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:33">12:8:2:33</a></font></span>33. There are three sacrificial cakes, for there are three seasons: it is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the summer by that of Indra, the rainy season by that of Savit<i>ri</i>, and the winter by that of Varu<i>n</i>a: he thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their (peculiar) form and deity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:34">12:8:2:34</a></font></span>34. There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are six seasons: it is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the spring and summer by the two Â<i>s</i>vina (cups), the rainy season and autumn by the two Sârasvata ones, and the winter and dewy season by the two Aindra ones: he thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their form and deity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:35">12:8:2:35</a></font></span>35. The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous, and relate to the same deities--</p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>for the sake of the continuity and uninterruptedness of the seasons. They are all of them invitatory-formulas and all offering-formulas <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whence all the seasons pass onwards, and all of them return. All (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the seasons are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of day and night: it is the day and the night he thus secures for himself; whence both the seasons and the months are established on day and night.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:8:2:36">12:8:2:36</a></font></span>36. The Sautrâma<i>n</i>î, truly, is the same as the year, and the same as the moon; and the Sacrificer is manifestly the sun: his vedi (altar-ground) is this earth, his uttara-vedi the air, his barhis the sky, his officiating priests the quarters, his fuel the trees, his ghee the waters, his oblations the plants, his fire Agni himself, his sa<i>m</i>sthâ (the particular form of sacrifice) the year--and, indeed, everything here, whatever there is, is the year; whence he who has performed the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î wins everything, and secures everything for himself.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_621"></a><a href="sbe44069.htm#fr_623">243:3</a> The two A<i>s</i>vins are the physicians of the gods. Cf. IV, 1, 5, 8 seqq.; <a href="sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:3">XII, 7, 2, 3</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_622"></a><a href="sbe44069.htm#fr_624">244:1</a> This refers to the puro<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>nuvâkyâs and yâ<i>g</i>yâs of the oblations of omentum (vapâ) of the three victims. For these formulas the three verses, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 67-69, are used in such a way that verse 1 forms the anuvâkyâ, and verse 2 the yâ<i>g</i>yâ, of the A<i>s</i>vins’ oblation; verse 2 the anuvâkyâ, and verse 3 the yâ<i>g</i>yâ, of Sarasvatî's oblation; and verse 3 the anuvâkyâ, and verse 1 the yâ<i>g</i>yâ, of Indra's oblation. In each of the three verses all the three deities are mentioned.--In exactly the same way the three verses, XX, 70-72, are used as the anuvâkyâs and yâ<i>g</i>yâs of the three pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>as; and 73-75 as those of the chief oblations (havis) of meat-portions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_623"></a><a href="sbe44069.htm#fr_625">244:2</a> The Âprîs (propitiatory verses, cf. part ii, p. 185) are the offering-formulas (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) of the eleven (or twelve) fore-offerings (prayâ<i>g</i>a) of the animal sacrifice. Those used on the present occasion are the twelve verses given, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XX, 55-66; there being on this occasion (in the second and third places) fore-offerings both to Tanûnapât and Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa. In each of these verses, again, all three deities are referred to.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_624"></a><a href="sbe44069.htm#fr_626">244:3</a> I do not exactly know what formulas are thereby referred to. <a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a> It can hardly be the praishas of the anuyâ<i>g</i>as (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXI, 48-58), as these are not in the <i>g</i>agatî, but in the (ârshî) trish<i>t</i>ubh metre; though certainly each of them contains the names of the three deities.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_626"></a><a href="sbe44069.htm#fr_628">246:1</a> Viz. inasmuch as three priests partake of each of the first two cups of milk, and of the first two cups of Surd-liquor, and each priest drinks twice.</p>
