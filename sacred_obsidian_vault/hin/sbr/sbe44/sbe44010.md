 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:8:1">11:1:8:1</a></font></span>1. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, once strove together. Then the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause of ruin <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:8:2">11:1:8:2</a></font></span>2. But the gods went on offering unto one another. Pra<i>g</i>âpati gave himself up to them, and the sacrifice became theirs; for, indeed, the sacrifice is the food of the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:8:3">11:1:8:3</a></font></span>3. Having given himself up to the gods, he created that counterpart of himself, to wit, the sacrifice: whence people say, 'The sacrifice is Pra<i>g</i>âpati;' for he created it as a counterpart of himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:8:4">11:1:8:4</a></font></span>4. By this (Full and New-moon) sacrifice he redeemed himself from the gods. Now when he (the Sacrificer) enters on the fast, he thereby gives himself up to the gods, even as Pra<i>g</i>âpati thereby gave himself up to the gods. Let him therefore endeavour to pass that night (with his mind) completely restrained <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">3</font></a>, in the same way as he would</p>

 <p>proceed with (material for) an oblation, for he becomes an oblation to the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:8:5">11:1:8:5</a></font></span>5. And when (on the following day) he performs the sacrifice, then he redeems himself by sacrifice from the gods, even as Pra<i>g</i>âpati thereby redeemed himself: when he takes out the material for (the chief) sacrificial dish, he redeems the sacrifice by the material for the sacrificial dish; the sacrificial dish (he redeems) by the invitatory formula, the invitatory formula by the portion cut (from the sacrificial dish), the portion by the offering-formula, the offering--formula by the Vasha<i>t</i>-call, and the Vasha<i>t</i>-call by the oblation. His oblation itself is still unredeemed,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:8:6">11:1:8:6</a></font></span>6. And that sacrifice of his is like a tree with its top broken off. He redeems the oblation by the Anvâhârya (mess of rice) <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and because he thereby supplies (anv-â-harati) what is wanting in the sacrifice, therefore it is called Anvâhârya. Thus, then, that entire sacrifice of his comes to be redeemed; and that sacrifice becomes the Sacrificer's self in yonder world. And, verily, the Sacrificer who, knowing this, performs that (offering of) redemption comes into existence in yonder world with a complete body.</p>
