 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:1">12:1:1:1</a></font></span>1. Verily, this sacrifice is the same as this blowing (wind): it is that <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">1</font></a> they wish to secure who take the vow of initiation for a year. Of them the G<i>ri</i>hapati is initiated first <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for the G<i>ri</i>hapati is this (terrestrial) world, and upon this world everything here is established; and so, indeed, are his fellow-sacrificers established in the G<i>ri</i>hapati: it is thus after they have become established on a firm foundation that they are initiated.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:2">12:1:1:2</a></font></span>2. He (the Adhvaryu) then initiates the Brahman (priest). Now the Brahman is the moon, and the moon is Soma, and plants belong to Soma <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">3</font></a>: he thus connects the plants with this (terrestrial) world. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate (tear up) the plants from this (terrestrial) world, and they would be liable to dry up: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:3">12:1:1:3</a></font></span>3. He then initiates the Udgât<i>ri</i>. Now, the Udgât<i>ri</i> is the thunder-cloud, and from the thundercloud rain is produced: he thus connects the rain</p>

 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the plants. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate the rain from the plants, and (the cloud) would be liable to lack rain: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:4">12:1:1:4</a></font></span>4. He then initiates the Ho tri. Now, the Hot<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">1</font></a> is Agni in respect of the deity, and speech in respect of the body; and rain is food: he thus connects both Agni (fire) and speech with food. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate fire and speech from food, and (people) would be liable to starve: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:5">12:1:1:5</a></font></span>5. The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> then initiates the Adhvaryu. Now, the Adhvaryu is the mind <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and the Hot<i>ri</i> is speech: he thus connects mind and speech with one another. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate mind and speech, and (people) would be liable to perish: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:6">12:1:1:6</a></font></span>6. He then initiates the Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin for the Brahman, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Prastot<i>ri</i> for the Udgât<i>ri</i>, for under</p>

 <p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p>  
 <p>him the former is. He then initiates the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a for the Hot<i>ri</i>, for under him the former is. These four the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> initiates.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:7">12:1:1:7</a></font></span>7. The Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> then initiates the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> for the Adhvaryu, for under him the former is. It is after the fitting out <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">1</font></a> of these nine that the others are fitted out; for there are nine vital airs: he thus lays the vital airs into them; and so they attain the full term of life, and so they do not depart this world before their (full) term of life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:8">12:1:1:8</a></font></span>8. He then initiates the Pot<i>ri</i> for the Brahman, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Pratihart<i>ri</i> for the Udgât<i>ri</i>, for under him the former is. He then initiates the A<i>kh</i>âvâka for the Hot<i>ri</i>, for under him the former is. These four the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> initiates.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:9">12:1:1:9</a></font></span>9. The Unnet<i>ri</i> then initiates the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> for the Adhvaryu, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Âgnîdhra for the Brahman, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ for the Udgât<i>ri</i>, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Grâvastut for the Hot<i>ri</i>, for under him the former is. These four the Unnet<i>ri</i> initiates.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:10">12:1:1:10</a></font></span>10. Either a Snâtaka <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, or some one else who is not initiated, then initiates the Unnet<i>ri</i>; for they say, 'No pure one should purify.' This is the regular order of initiation <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">3</font></a>;</p>

 <p>and; assuredly, only when, knowing this <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">1</font></a>, they become initiated, they make ready the sacrifice even whilst being initiated, and along with the getting ready of the sacrifice security of property accrues to the performers of the sacrificial session (Sattra); and, along with the accruing of security of property to the performers of the session, security of property also accrues to that district in which they perform the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:1:1:11">12:1:1:11</a></font></span>11. Now, the Unnet<i>ri</i> is initiated last of these, and when they come out from the purificatory bath it is he that comes out first; for the Unnet<i>ri</i> is the vital air: he thus lays vital air into them on both sides; and so they attain the full term of life, and so they do not depart this world before their (full) term of life. This is the regular order of initiation: and, assuredly, he should become initiated only where such as know this become initiated.</p>
