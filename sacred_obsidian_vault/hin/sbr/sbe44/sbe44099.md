 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:3:6:1">13:3:6:1</a></font></span>1. When the horse was slaughtered, the life-sap <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">4</font></a> went out of it; it became the A<i>s</i>vastomîya (set of oblations <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">5</font></a>): when he offers the A<i>s</i>vastomîya (oblations) he indeed supplies the horse with life-sap.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:3:6:2">13:3:6:2</a></font></span>2. He performs it with ghee; for ghee is life-sap, and the A<i>s</i>vastomîya is life-sap: by means of life-sap</p>

 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a></p>  
 <p>he thus puts life-sap into it. He performs with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the favourite resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their favourite resource.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:3:6:3">13:3:6:3</a></font></span>3. Having performed the A<i>s</i>vastomîya (set of) oblations, he offers the Dvipadâs <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for the A<i>s</i>vastomîya is the horse, and the Dvipadâ is man, for man is two-footed (dvipâd), supported on two (feet): he thus supplies him with a support.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:3:6:4">13:3:6:4</a></font></span>4. Concerning this they say, 'Is the A<i>s</i>vastomîya to be offered first, or the Dvipadâ?' The A<i>s</i>vastomîya, surely, is cattle, and the Dvipadâ is man: inasmuch as he performs the Dvipadâs after performing the A<i>s</i>vastomîya, man subsequently establishes himself amongst cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:3:6:5">13:3:6:5</a></font></span>5. Sixteen A<i>s</i>vastomîya oblations he performs, for animals (cattle) consist of sixteen parts <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">2</font></a>: that is the measure of cattle, and he thus supplies cattle with their (right) measure; Were he to offer either less or more, he would deprive cattle of their (right) measure. Sixteen he offers, for cattle consist of sixteen parts: that is the measure of cattle, and he thus supplies cattle with their (right) measure. He offers no other as a final oblation <a name="fr_879"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">3</font></a>: were he to offer another as a final oblation, he would lose</p>

 <p><a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a></p>  
 <p>his support. The Dvipadâs he offers last, for Dvipadâs are a support: he thus finds a support (establishes himself). With, 'To <i>G</i>umbaka hail!' he offers, at the purificatory bath, the last oblation <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for <i>G</i>umbaka is Varu<i>n</i>a: by sacrifice he thus manifestly redeems himself from Varu<i>n</i>a. He offers it on the head of a white-spotted <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_877"><font size="1">2</font></a>, baldheaded (man) with protruding teeth <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_878"><font size="1">3</font></a> and reddish brown eyes; for that is Varu<i>n</i>a's form: by (that) form (of his) he thus redeems himself from Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:3:6:6">13:3:6:6</a></font></span>6. Having stepped out (of the water) he prepares twelve messes of cooked rice for the priests, or performs twelve ish<i>t</i>is. Concerning this they say, 'These to wit, ish<i>t</i>is--are a form of sacrifice: were he to perform ish<i>t</i>is, the sacrifice would be ready to incline towards him; but he would become the worse for it, for, surely, of exhausted strength now are the metres (offering formulas) of him who has performed the Soma-sacrifice;--how could he make use of them so soon? For when the sacrifice is complete, Vâ<i>k</i> (speech and sacred writ <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">4</font></a>) is wholly gained, and, being gained, it now is exhausted in strength, and, as it were, wounded and mangled; but sacrifice is speech: hence he should not make use of it.'</p>

Having stepped out (of the water) he should certainly prepare twelve messes of rice for the priests; for cooked rice is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: it is the year, the sacrifice, he thus gains, and the sacrifice becomes ready to incline towards him, and he does not become the worse for it.</p>
