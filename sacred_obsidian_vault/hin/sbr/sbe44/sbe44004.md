Now when they spread (and perform) the sacrifice, they kill it; and when they press out king Soma, they kill him; and when they 'quiet' and cut up the victim, they kill it,--it is by means of the mortar and pestle, and by the two mill-stones that they kill the Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a (grain-offering).</p>

And having killed the sacrifice, he pours it, as seed, into the fire as its womb, for, indeed, the fire is the womb of the sacrifice, from out of it it is produced: let him therefore perform those ten oblations <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a> for which the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:3">11:1:2:3</a></font></span>3. And, indeed, this sacrifice is the blowing (wind): he blows here, as it were, as a single one, but when he has entered into man, he is divided into ten parts;--with the vital airs thus distributed, it (the sacrifice) is born from out of its womb, the fire: this is that Virâ<i>g</i> of ten syllables, this is that perfection, the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:4">11:1:2:4</a></font></span>4. There may, however, be nine (oblations) <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--he thus forms a defective (lesser, lower) Virâ<i>g</i> with a view to production; for from the lesser <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">3</font></a>, indeed, creatures are produced here: this is that perfection, the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:5">11:1:2:5</a></font></span>5. But there may be one additional (oblation) <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">4</font></a>,that one remains over for Pra<i>g</i>âpati: this is that perfection, the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:6">11:1:2:6</a></font></span>6. And there may be two additional (oblations) <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">5</font></a>,</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> --a productive pair consists of two: thus a productive pair is produced; this is that perfection, the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:7">11:1:2:7</a></font></span>7. And there may be three additional ones <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--a productive pair consists of two, and that which is produced is the third: this is that perfection, the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:8">11:1:2:8</a></font></span>8. And there may be four additional ones <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--as the one so the four. There are these three worlds; these worlds he thus gains by three (oblations); and Pra<i>g</i>âpati, indeed, is the fourth beyond these worlds: by the fourth (oblation) he thus gains Pra<i>g</i>âpati,--this is that perfection, the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:9">11:1:2:9</a></font></span>9. That (sacrifice) which is defective in two (oblations) <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">3</font></a> is indeed defective, it is not a sacrifice; and that which is excessive in respect of five (oblations) is indeed excessive, it is not a sacrifice: this is that perfection as regards the ten, the twenty, thus up to a thousand <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:10">11:1:2:10</a></font></span>10. Verily, they who perform the Full and New-moon sacrifice, run a race <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">5</font></a>. One ought to perform it during fifteen years;--in these fifteen years there are three hundred and sixty full moons and new</p>

 <p>moons; and there are in a year three hundred and sixty nights: it is the nights he thus gains.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:11">11:1:2:11</a></font></span>11. He should then offer for another fifteen years; in these fifteen years there are three hundred and sixty full moons and new moons; and there are in a year three hundred and sixty days it is the days he thus gains, and the year itself he thus gains.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:12">11:1:2:12</a></font></span>12. Now, indeed, the gods were at first mortal; and only when they had gained the year they were immortal; for the year is everything, and the imperishable means everything: thereby then accrues to him imperishable merit, the imperishable world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:1:2:13">11:1:2:13</a></font></span>13. He who, knowing this, offers (the Full and New-moon sacrifice) for thirty years, becomes one of the race-runners, whence one ought to offer sacrifice for not less than thirty years. But if he be a performer of the Dâkshâya<i>n</i>a sacrifice <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he need only offer for fifteen years, for therein that perfection is brought about, since he performs (every month) two Full-moon and two New-moon offerings, and thus that perfection is indeed brought about therein.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_75"></a><a href="sbe44004.htm#fr_75">3:1</a> These ten oblations of the New and Full-moon sacrifice (as the model for Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as generally), as enumerated by Sâya<i>n</i>a, are (<i>a</i>) at full moon--five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, two cake-offerings to Agni, and Agni-Soma, and a low-voiced offering to Agni-Soma, (<i>b</i>) at new moon--five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, a cake to Agni, a low-voiced offering to Vish<i>n</i>u, and an offering of (sweet and sour) milk, or Sânnâyya, to Indra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_76"></a><a href="sbe44004.htm#fr_76">3:2</a> Viz. inasmuch as, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, at the Full-moon sacrifice the offering to Agni-Soma only takes place in the case of one who is a Soma-offerer. I find, however, no authority for this.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_79"></a><a href="sbe44004.htm#fr_79">3:5</a> According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, the second additional offering is the oblation of clotted ghee to Vanaspati (the lord of the forest, or <a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a> the tree, i.e. the sacrificial stake, or Soma) at the animal sacrifice. Cf. part ii, p. 208.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_80"></a><a href="sbe44004.htm#fr_80">4:1</a> These three oblations, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, are the three after-offerings (to the Barhis, to Nârâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa, and to Agni), see part i, p. 230 seqq.</p>
