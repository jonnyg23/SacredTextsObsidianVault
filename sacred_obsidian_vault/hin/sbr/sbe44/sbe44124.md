 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:3:2:19">14:3:2:19</a></font></span>19. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXIX, 4), 'The mind's purpose,'--by the mind, indeed, everything is gained here: by the mind he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:3:2:20">14:3:2:20</a></font></span>20.

 <p><a name="page_509"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 509</font></a></p>  
 <p>are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the havis) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma); but, indeed, when the New and Full-moon sacrifices overflow all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the New and Full-moon sacrifices overflow for him who thus knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:3:2:28">14:3:2:28</a></font></span>28. The Pravargya, indeed, is the Seasonal sacrifices, for the Seasonal sacrifices are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the havis) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the Seasonal sacrifices overflow then all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the Seasonal sacrifices overflow for him who thus knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:3:2:29">14:3:2:29</a></font></span>29. The Pravargya, indeed, is the Animal sacrifice, for the Animal sacrifice is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the meat) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; and when it is standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the animal offering overflows all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the animal offering overflows for him who thus knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:3:2:30">14:3:2:30</a></font></span>30. The Pravargya, indeed, is Soma, for Soma is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it is poured out then it is the (Gharma) placed on the fire; when it is drawn (into the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_510"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 510</font></a></p>  
 <p>cups) then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when Soma overflows all the gods and all beings avail themselves thereof; and, verily, Soma overflows for him who thus knows this; and, verily, no sacrifice whatever is offered without the Pravargya for him who thus knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:3:2:31">14:3:2:31</a></font></span>31. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule thereof is the same as at the creation <a name="fr_1326"></a><a href="#fn_1316"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>
