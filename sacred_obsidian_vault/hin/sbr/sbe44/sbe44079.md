'Go thou along the way of the Âdityas!'--to the Âdityas he thus makes it go.--'Ye divine guardians of the quarters, protect this horse, sprinkled for sacrifice to the gods!'--the guardians of the quarters are a hundred princes born in wedlock: to them he commits it;--'here is joy: here let it rejoice!--here is safe keeping, here is its own safe keeping, hail!' For a year he offers the (four Dh<i>ri</i>ti) oblations <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_723"><font size="1">2</font></a>--(amounting to) sixteen nineties, for they are the horse's chain <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_724"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and it is therewith alone that he chains it; whence the horse when let loose returns to its chain: (they amount to) sixteen nineties <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_725"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for these (oblations of safe keeping) are the horse's chain, and it is therewith alone that he chains it, whence the horse, when let loose, does not (entirely) abandon its chain.</p>

Wherefore let him who holds royal sway perform the horse-sacrifice; for, verily, whosoever performs the horse-sacrifice, without possessing power, is poured (swept) away.--Now, were unfriendly, men to get hold of the horse, his sacrifice would be cut in twain, and he would become the poorer for it. A hundred men clad in armour guard it for the continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice; and he will not become the poorer for it; (but if it be lost) they should fetch another (horse), and sprinkle it: this is the expiation in that case.</p>
