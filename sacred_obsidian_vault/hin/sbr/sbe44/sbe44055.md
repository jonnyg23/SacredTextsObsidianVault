 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:1">12:3:3:1</a></font></span>1. The gods were once performing the initiation ceremony for a (sacrificial session) of a thousand years. When five hundred years had passed with them, everything here was worn out--to wit, Stomas, and P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, and metres (texts).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:2">12:3:3:2</a></font></span>2. The gods then perceived that unexhausted element of the sacrifice, and by means of that unexhausted element they obtained what success there was in the Veda; and, verily, for him who thus knows this, the Vedas are unexhausted, and the work of the officiating priests is pet-formed with the unexhausted threefold science.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:3">12:3:3:3</a></font></span>3. Now, this is that unexhausted element of the sacrifice:--o-<i>s</i>râvaya, astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>, ya<i>g</i>a, ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe, and vausha<i>t</i> <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">2</font></a>. In these five utterances there are seventeen syllables:--o-<i>s</i>râvaya consists of four syllables, astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i> of four syllables, ya<i>g</i>a of two syllables, ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe of five syllables;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:4">12:3:3:4</a></font></span>4. And the Vasha<i>t</i>-call consists of two syllables. This is the seventeenfold Pra<i>g</i>âpati, as established in the deity and in the body, and, verily, whosoever thus knows that seventeenfold Pra<i>g</i>âpati, as established in the deity and in the body, establishes himself by offspring and cattle in this, and by immortality in the other, world.</p>

The gods then spake, 'Find ye out that sacrificial performance which shall be a substitute for one of a thousand years; for what man is equal thereto that he could get through with (a performance of) a thousand years?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:6">12:3:3:6</a></font></span>6.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:7">12:3:3:7</a></font></span>7. They saw the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya-sha<i>d</i>aha to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of the Dvâda<i>s</i>âha, for there are those (same) Stomas, those P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, and those metres <a name="fr_495"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:8">12:3:3:8</a></font></span>8. They saw the Dvâda<i>s</i>âha to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of (a session of) a year <a name="fr_496"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for there are those (same) Stomas, those P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, and those metres.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:9">12:3:3:9</a></font></span>9. They saw the (session of a) year to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of the Tâpa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ita <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">4</font></a>, for there are those (same) Stomas, those P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, and those metres.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:10">12:3:3:10</a></font></span>10. They saw the Tâpa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ita to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of the thousand years’ performance, for there are those (same) Stomas, those P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, and those metres.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:11">12:3:3:11</a></font></span>11. He passes a year with the rites of initiation,</p>

 <p>a year with the Upasads, and a year with the pressings of Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:12">12:3:3:12</a></font></span>12. When he passes a year with the rites of initiation he thereby secures for himself the first part of the performance of a thousand years; and when he passes a year with the Upasads he thereby secures for himself the central part of the performance of a thousand years; and when he passes a year with the pressings he thereby secures for himself the last part of the performance of a thousand years.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:13">12:3:3:13</a></font></span>13. Twelve months he passes with the rites of initiation, twelve with the Upasads, and twelve with the pressings,--that makes thirty-six. Now the B<i>ri</i>hatî (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî the gods strove to reach heaven, and by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî they indeed attained heaven; and in like manner does this one, by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî, now strive to reach heaven, and by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî he indeed attains heaven; and whatever object of desire there is in the B<i>ri</i>hatî, that he thereby secures for himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:3:14">12:3:3:14</a></font></span>14. But, indeed, there is that triad that is performed together,--the Agni (fire-altar), the Arkya, and the Mahad Uktham (great litany). When he passes a year with the rites of initiation, and a year with the Upasads, thereby the Agni and the Arka are secured by him; and when he passes a year with the pressings, thereby the Mahad Uktham is secured by him: this, then, to wit, the Tâpa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ita, is the substitute for the performance of a thousand years, and this, to wit, the Tâpa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ita, conduces to the procreation of creatures.</p>
