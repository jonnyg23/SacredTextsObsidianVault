Now at the time when he there <a name="fr_1220"></a><a href="#fn_1212"><font size="1">2</font></a> proceeds with the guest-meal, he who intends to perform the Pravargya, prior to the Upasads <a name="fr_1221"></a><a href="#fn_1213"><font size="1">3</font></a>, spreads Ku<i>s</i>a grass with its tops directed towards the east, in front of the Gârhapatya, and places the vessels thereon in pairs <a name="fr_1222"></a><a href="#fn_1214"><font size="1">4</font></a>,--the Upayamanî (tray) and the Mahâvîra (pot), the pair of lifting-sticks <a name="fr_1223"></a><a href="#fn_1215"><font size="1">5</font></a>, the</p>

 <p>two milking-bowls, the two Rauhi<i>n</i>a-plates, the two offering spoons for the Rauhi<i>n</i>a (cakes), and whatever other (implement) there is,--these make ten, for the Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is Virâ<i>g</i>: he thus makes this to be equal to the Virâ<i>g</i>, the sacrifice. And as to their being in pairs,--a pair means strength, for when two take hold of each other they exert strength; and a pair (couple) means a productive union: with a productive union he thus supplies and completes it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:2">14:1:3:2</a></font></span>2. Then the Adhvaryu takes the (lustral) sprinkling water, and, stepping up, says, 'Brahman, we shall proceed: Hot<i>ri</i>, sing praises!' for the Brahman is seated on the right (south) side as the guardian of the sacrifice: to him he thus says, 'Sit thou undistracted: we are about to restore the head of the Sacrifice;' and 'Hot<i>ri</i>, sing praises!' he says, because the Hot<i>ri</i> is the sacrifice: he thus thereby says to him, 'Restore the head of the sacrifice!' and accordingly the Hot<i>ri</i> begins to recite--</p>

 <p>sun, and he is born day by day from afore (in the east); and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The Brahman (n.), firstborn from afore.' He then sprinkles (the vessels): the import of this is the same as before <a name="fr_1225"></a><a href="#fn_1217"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:4">14:1:3:4</a></font></span>4. He sprinkles (the chief Mahâvîra) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVII, 11), 'For Yama thee!'--Yama, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, for it is he who controls (yam) everything here, and by him everything here is controlled; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Yama (I sprinkle) thee.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:5">14:1:3:5</a></font></span>5. 'For Makha thee!'--Makha, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Makha thee.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:6">14:1:3:6</a></font></span>6. 'For Sûrya's heat thee!'--Sûrya, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Sûrya's heat thee.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:7">14:1:3:7</a></font></span>7. Having taken out a post <a name="fr_1226"></a><a href="#fn_1218"><font size="1">2</font></a> by the front door (of the <i>s</i>âlâ), he drives it into the ground on the south side (of the <i>s</i>âlâ <a name="fr_1227"></a><a href="#fn_1219"><font size="1">3</font></a>), so that the Hot<i>ri</i>, whilst singing praises, may look upon it; for the Hot<i>ri</i> is the sacrifice, and he thereby restores the sacrifice to this (earth), and she causes the Gharma (milk) to rise.</p>

Having turned round the Emperor's throne-seat <a name="fr_1228"></a><a href="#fn_1220"><font size="1">1</font></a> in front of the Âhavanîya, he places it south thereof, and north of the King's (Soma's) throne-seat <a name="fr_1229"></a><a href="#fn_1221"><font size="1">2</font></a>, so as to face the east.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:9">14:1:3:9</a></font></span>9. It is made of Udumbara wood, for the Udumbara means strength: with strength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:10">14:1:3:10</a></font></span>10. It is shoulder-high, for on the shoulders this head is set: he thus sets the head upon the shoulders.</p>

It is wound all over with cords <a name="fr_1230"></a><a href="#fn_1222"><font size="1">3</font></a> of Balva<i>g</i>a grass (Eleusine indica). When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed out, and thence these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:12">14:1:3:12</a></font></span>12 And as to why he places it north (of Soma's seat),--Soma is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head; but the head is higher (uttara): therefore he places it north (uttara) of it. Moreover, Soma is king, and the Pravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher than the royal: therefore he places it north of it <a name="fr_1231"></a><a href="#fn_1223"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:13">14:1:3:13</a></font></span>13. And when the Hot<i>ri</i> recites this (verse, Rig-v. V, 43, 7), 'Whom the priests anoint, as if spreading him . . .,' he anoints that Mahâvîra which is to be used, all over with ghee <a name="fr_1232"></a><a href="#fn_1224"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with, 'May the god Savit<i>ri</i> anoint thee with honey!' for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods, and honey means everything whatever there is here: he thus anoints it (or him) all over with everything here, and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impels it for him,--this is why he says, 'May the god Savit<i>ri</i> anoint thee with honey!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:14">14:1:3:14</a></font></span>14. Now sand has been strewed <a name="fr_1233"></a><a href="#fn_1225"><font size="1">2</font></a> on the north side of it: below that he (previously) throws (a plate of) white gold <a name="fr_1234"></a><a href="#fn_1226"><font size="1">3</font></a>, with, 'Protect it from contact with the earth!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from below; and that, to wit, gold, being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Earth also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing <a name="fr_1235"></a><a href="#fn_1227"><font size="1">4</font></a>, might injure</p>

 <p>her: he thus keeps it separate from her. White it is, for white, as it were <a name="fr_1236"></a><a href="#fn_1228"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is this earth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:15">14:1:3:15</a></font></span>15. And when the Hot<i>ri</i> recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 36, 9), 'Sit thee down: thou art great . . .,' sheaths of reed-grass are kindled on both sides <a name="fr_1237"></a><a href="#fn_1229"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and throwing them (on the mound), he puts (the Mahâvîra pot) thereon. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and therefrom these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:16">14:1:3:16</a></font></span>16. And as to why they are kindled on both sides: he thereby repels the Rakshas, the fiends, from all the quarters. Whilst this (pot) is being heated, the (Sacrificer's) wife covers her head, thinking, 'Lest this one, when heated and glowing, should rob me of my eyesight,' for it indeed becomes heated and glowing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:17">14:1:3:17</a></font></span>17. He puts it on with, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art;'--for the Gharma is he who shines yonder, and he indeed is all that: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:18">14:1:3:18</a></font></span>18. He (the Sacrificer) then invokes blessings on this (earth) <a name="fr_1238"></a><a href="#fn_1230"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for the sacrifice is this (earth): it is thus (whilst being) on her that he invokes blessings, and she fulfils them all for him.</p>

XXXVII, 12,] 'Unmolested thou art in front (in the east),'--for unmolested by the Rakshas, the fiends, indeed, this (earth) is in front;--'in Agni's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Agni her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou life unto me!'--he thus secures life for himself, and accordingly he attains the full (term of) life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:20">14:1:3:20</a></font></span>20. 'Possessed of sons towards the south,'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'in Indra's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Indra her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou offspring unto me!'--he thus secures offspring and cattle for himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of sons and of cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:21">14:1:3:21</a></font></span>21.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:22">14:1:3:22</a></font></span>22. 'A sphere of hearing towards the north,'--'causing (sacrificial calls) to be heard <a name="fr_1239"></a><a href="#fn_1231"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' is what he thereby means to say;--'in the creator's over-lordship,'--the creator he thus</p>

 <p>makes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas; 'grant thou prosperity (increase) of wealth unto me!'--wealth, prosperity, he thus secures for himself, and accordingly he becomes wealthy and prosperous.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:23">14:1:3:23</a></font></span>23.

On the right (south) side (of the Mahâvîra) he (the Sacrificer) then makes amends by (laying down) the hand with the palm upwards, with, 'Shield me from all evil spirits!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me from all troubles!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers, but the Fathers are three in number <a name="fr_1241"></a><a href="#fn_1233"><font size="1">2</font></a>: it is with these that he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:25">14:1:3:25</a></font></span>25. Thereupon, whilst touching her (the earth) <a name="fr_1242"></a><a href="#fn_1234"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:26">14:1:3:26</a></font></span>26. He then lays pieces of (split) Vikaṅkata wood round (the Mahâvîra), two pointing to the east <a name="fr_1243"></a><a href="#fn_1235"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXVII, 13), 'Hail! be thou encompassed by the Maruts!'--the call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last <a name="fr_1244"></a><a href="#fn_1236"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for the call of 'hail!' is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies; and hence he places the call of 'hail!' first, and the deity last.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:27">14:1:3:27</a></font></span>27. 'Be thou encompassed by the Maruts,' he says; for the Maruts are the (common) people: he thus surrounds the nobility by the people, whence the nobility here is surrounded on both sides by the people. Silently (he lays down) two pointing to the north <a name="fr_1245"></a><a href="#fn_1237"><font size="1">3</font></a>, silently (again) two pointing to the east, silently two pointing to the north, silently two pointing to the east.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:29">14:1:3:29</a></font></span>29. He then places a gold plate (weighing a hundred grains) on the top (of the pot), with, 'Protect it from contact with the sky!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from above; and that--to wit, gold--being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Sky also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing, might injure it: he thus keeps it separate therefrom. It is yellow, for yellow, as it were, is the sky.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:30">14:1:3:30</a></font></span>30. He (the Adhvaryu) then fans (the fire) thrice by means of (three) fans <a name="fr_1246"></a><a href="#fn_1238"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whilst muttering, 'Honey!' each time; for honey means breath: he thus lays breath into it. Three (fans) there are, for there are three breathings, the out (and in)-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing: it is these he thus lays into it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:31">14:1:3:31</a></font></span>31. They then fan it thrice <a name="fr_1247"></a><a href="#fn_1239"><font size="1">2</font></a> in the non-sunwise way. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers,--the Fathers being three in number <a name="fr_1248"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">3</font></a>: with them he thus supplies it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:32">14:1:3:32</a></font></span>32. But, indeed, the breathings depart from those who perform the fanning at the sacrifice. They</p>

 <p>fan again thrice in the sunwise way,--this makes six; and six in number are these breathings (vital airs) in the head: it is these he thus lays into it. They cook the two Rauhi<i>n</i>a (cakes). When a blaze is produced, he takes off the gold (plate).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:3:33">14:1:3:33</a></font></span>33. And when the Hot<i>ri</i> recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 112, 24), 'Successful, O A<i>s</i>vins, make ye our voice,' the Adhvaryu steps up, and says, 'The Gharma is aglow <a name="fr_1249"></a><a href="#fn_1241"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' If it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer will become more prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will become poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he (the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but indeed (the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1220"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1228">461:1</a> The Pravargya is styled 'samrâ<i>g</i>,' or universal king, emperor; as distinguished from King Soma, for whose seat, reaching only up to the navel, see III, 3, 4, 26 seqq. (Cf. also that of the Ukhya Agni, which is only a span high, VI, 7, I, 1, 22 seqq.)--For a similar attribution of imperial dignity (sâmrâ<i>g</i>ya)--as well as royal dignity (râ<i>g</i>ya)--to him who is consecrated by the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î (where the seat used is knee-high), see <a href="sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:4">XII, 8, 3, 4</a> seqq.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1223"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1231">461:4</a> According to Katy. XXVI, 2, 27 (Âpast. XV, 6, II), the black antelope-skin is then spread over the seat, and the two unused Mahâvîra pots (as well as the reserve piece of clay and the spade, Katy.) placed thereon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1224"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1232">462:1</a> Katy. XXVI, 2, 4 refers to the pot as 'containing ghee (â<i>g</i>yavant),' which the comm. takes to mean 'filled with consecrated ghee;' whilst Âpast. XV, 7, 5 leaves the option between greasing it (a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>) and filling it (abhipûr) with ghee. It would doubtless, at all events, be abundantly greased inside.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1225"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1233">462:2</a> North of the Gârhapatya and the Âhavanîya in the <i>s</i>âlâ two mounds (khara) are formed, covered with (or consisting of) sand. The one north of the latter fire is here alluded to.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1227"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1235">462:4</a> Though 'tapta<i>h</i>' and '<i>s</i>u<i>s</i>u<i>k</i>âna<i>h</i>' are here translated as if they were actually co-ordinate predicates, I am not sure whether we should not rather take the passage to mean,--that this glowing one, when heated; or rather, this one when heated so as to be glowing. Cf. <a href="sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:18">XIV, 2, 1, 18</a>; <a href="sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:14">3, 1, 14</a>, where I prefer to subordinate one of the participles to the other.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1229"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1237">463:2</a> That is, by dividing the sheaths in the middle lengthwise, and lighting both halves in the Gârhapatya fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1230"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1238">463:3</a> According to Katy. XXVI, 3, 5 he makes a span (of thumb and index)--or spreads his hand with the palm downwards--over the pot whilst muttering the respective formulas; apparently changing the position of the hand according to the point of the compass referred to in the formula.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1231"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1239">464:1</a> Or, calling for the '<i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>'; cf. part i, p. 131, note 2. The masculine form of the participle is somewhat peculiar as the term it is meant to explain refers to the earth. It has probably to be understood in the sense of, 'where he (viz. the Adhvaryu) calls for the <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>.' Mahîdhara explains the term 'â<i>s</i>ruti' by 'where they, the priests, utter the sacrificial calls,' i.e. 'meet for sacrifice.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1232"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1240">465:1</a> Here the masculine gender can hardly be understood otherwise than in the sense 'where (B<i>ri</i>haspati, or Brahman) disposes on high.' Mahîdhara takes no notice of this interpretation of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, but explains 'vidh<i>ri</i>ti' as either 'one who upholds (dhârayati) in an especial manner,' or where 'the offering spoon, &amp;c., is held upwards (uparish<i>t</i>âd dhriyate,--? who holds it upwards),'--an explanation which can hardly commend itself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1233"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1241">465:2</a> This specification of the number seems to have no other object but that of limiting the general term of 'Fathers,' or deceased ancestors, to the specific signification it has at the <i>S</i>râddha, where offering is made to the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1234"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1242">465:3</a> According to Katy. XXVI, 3, 8, he does so whilst spanning the earth north of the Mahâvîra pot.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1235"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1243">466:1</a> That is, along the north and the south sides of the pot, on the burning sheaths of reed grass; or rather on hot cinders heaped thereon. Katy. XXVI, 3, 9. They would partly serve the purpose of the ordinary (three) enclosing-sticks; and Âpast., indeed, calls them 'paridhi.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1236"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1244">466:2</a> Literally, the call of 'hail!' (svâhâ-kâra) he makes to be the nearer, and the deity the farther.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1237"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1245">466:3</a> That is, along the west and the east sides of the pot. According to Âpast. <i>S</i>r. XV, 8, 1-4, two pieces of wood are laid down alternately by the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, the last pieces being then laid down (on the south side) by the former priest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1238"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1246">467:1</a> They consist of pieces cut from the black antelope-skin (with black and white hair, according to Âpast. XV, 5,12), fastened to sticks.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1241"></a><a href="sbe44119.htm#fr_1249">468:1</a> That is, apparently, red-hot, glowing (<i>s</i>u<i>k</i>ita), or perhaps, entirely ablaze, enveloped in flames--outside as well as inside, owing to the ghee with which it was greased all over; hence hardly, 'bestrahlt' (illumined shone upon), as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it; cf. <i>s</i>u<i>s</i>u<i>k</i>âna, <a href="sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:18">XIV, 2, 1, 18</a>; <a href="sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:14">3, 1, 14</a>. According to Âpast. <i>S</i>r., the three priests, having completed their circumambulation, sit down on the east, south, and north side respectively, and continue to fan the pot, at the same time oiling it with ghee, until the pot is ablaze, when the Adhvaryu takes off the gold plate. According to Kâty., on the other hand, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> proceeds with the baking of the cakes, whilst the Adhvaryu sprinkles the pot with ghee each time that the Hot<i>ri</i>, in his recitation, utters the syllable 'om' at the end of a verse. Before the last verse, the twenty-fifth, of the same hymn concluding the first part of the recitation, a special verse, IX, 83, 3, is inserted. Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. IV, 6, 2-3.</p>
