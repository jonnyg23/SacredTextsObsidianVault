Now, when the Adhvaryu here steps up and says, 'The Gharma is aglow,' they step up and revere it (the Mahâvîra) with the Avakâ<i>s</i>a <a name="fr_1251"></a><a href="#fn_1243"><font size="1">1</font></a>; but the 'avakâ<i>s</i>a' are the vital airs: it is thus the vital airs he lays into it. Six of them <a name="fr_1252"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">2</font></a> step up to it, for six in number are these vital airs in the head: it is these he thus lays into it.</p>

XXXVII, 14,] 'The child of the gods,'--the child (garbha) of the gods, in truth, is he that shines yonder, for he holds (grabh) everything here, and by him everything here is held; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The child of the gods.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:3">14:1:4:3</a></font></span>3. 'The father of thoughts,'--for he (the sun) is indeed the father of thoughts;--'the lord of creatures,'--for he is indeed the lord of creatures.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:4">14:1:4:4</a></font></span>4. 'The god hath united with the god Savit<i>ri</i>,'--for the god (the Mahâvîra) has indeed united with the god Savit<i>ri</i> (the sun);--'with Sûrya he shineth,'--for (equally) with Sûrya (the sun) he has indeed shone.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:5">14:1:4:5</a></font></span>5. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:6">14:1:4:6</a></font></span>6. 'Hail! Agni hath united with his heat,'--for Agni has indeed united with his heat; the call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before;--'with the divine Savit<i>ri</i>,'--for with the divine Savit<i>ri</i> he has indeed united;--'with Sûrya he hath shed light,'--for with Sûrya he has indeed shed light.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:7">14:1:4:7</a></font></span>7. These, then, are three 'avakâ<i>s</i>a,'--for there are three vital airs, the in (and out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is thereby that he lays it (the vital air) into him.</p>

XXXVII, 16,] 'The sustainer of the sky, and of heat upon earth, shineth forth,'--for as the sustainer of the sky, and of heat on earth, that (sun, and Mahâvîra) indeed shines forth;--'the divine sustainer of the gods, he, the immortal, born of heat,'--for he is indeed the divine sustainer of the gods, the immortal one, born of heat;--'grant unto us speech, devoted to the gods!'--speech doubtless is worship: he thus means to say thereby, 'bestow upon us worship whereby we shall please the gods!'</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:10">14:1:4:10</a></font></span>10, 'Wandering on paths hither and thither,'--for he indeed wanders hither and thither on the divine <a name="fr_1254"></a><a href="#fn_1246"><font size="1">1</font></a> paths;--'arraying himself in the gathering and the radiating,'--for he indeed arrays himself in the gathering (converging) and the radiating regions, or rays;--'he moveth to and fro within the spheres,'--for again and again he wanders moving within these worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:11">14:1:4:11</a></font></span>11. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two,'--it is with regard to the two A<i>s</i>vins that he says this, for it was the A<i>s</i>vins that then restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14:1:4:13">14:1:4:13</a></font></span>13. 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for honey!'--for Dadhya<i>ñ</i><i>k</i> the Âtharva<i>n</i>a indeed told them (the A<i>s</i>vins) the Brâhma<i>n</i>a called Madhu (honey), and this is their dear resource: it is by means of that (dear resource) of theirs that he approaches them, and therefore he says, 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for honey!'</p>

XXXVII, 20,] 'Thou art our father: be thou our father!'--for he who shines yonder is indeed the father, and the Pravargya is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Thou art our father: be thou our father!'--'Reverence be unto thee: injure me not!'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes.</p>

Thereupon he uncovers the head of the (Sacrificer's) wife, and makes her say whilst she is looking at the Mahâvîra, 'Together with Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> will we serve thee: (bestow thou sons and cattle upon me! bestow thou offspring upon us! may I remain unscathed together with my husband!)'--the Pravargya (m.) is a male, and the wife is a female: a productive pair is thus produced.</p>
