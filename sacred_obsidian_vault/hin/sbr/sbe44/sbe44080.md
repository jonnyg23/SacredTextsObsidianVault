From the body of him, when wearied and heated, the deities departed in a sevenfold way: therefrom the Dîkshâ (initiation) was produced. He perceived those Vai<i>s</i>vadeva <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">2</font></a> (oblations). He offered</p>

 <p>them, and by means of them he gained the Dîkshâ: and when the Sacrificer offers the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva (oblations) it is the Dîkshâ he thereby gains. Day after day he offers them: day after day he thus gains the Dîkshâ <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Seven of them he offers; for seven were those deities that departed (from Pra<i>g</i>âpati); it is by means of them that he (the priest) gains the Dîkshâ for him.</p>

 <p>seven days they observe it; for there are seven (outlets of) vital airs in the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: it is by means of the vital airs he gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs, for him. He makes offering by dividing (each) deity into three parts <a name="fr_733"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for the gods are of three orders <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and of three orders are these worlds: he thus establishes himself in these worlds in prosperity and vital power.</p>

They amount to one and twenty (single invocations and oblations),--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first,--that is the divine ruling-power, that is the glory: that supreme lordship, that summit of the fallow one (the Sun), that realm of light he attains.</p>

Four Audgrabha<i>n</i>as he offers (on each day), and three Vai<i>s</i>vadevas;--they amount to seven; for there are seven vital airs of the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: by means of the vital airs he thus gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs,</p>

 <p><a name="fn_726"></a><a href="sbe44080.htm#fr_730">289:1</a> Or, 'might I make offering with the life-sap of the horse?' the natural, as well as the technical, meaning of the term 'a<i>s</i>vamedha' being generally understood in these speculations.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_727"></a><a href="sbe44080.htm#fr_731">289:2</a> The oblations offered prior to the initiation--here, as at any Soma-sacrifice--are called Audgrabha<i>n</i>a (elevatory) oblations. On the present occasion he, in the first place, performs, on each of the first six days of the Dîkshâ, the four oblations of this kind offered at the ordinary Soma-sacrifice (for which see III, 1, 4, 1 seqq.); whilst on the seventh day he offers, instead of these, the six corresponding oblations of the Agni<i>k</i>ayana (which forms a necessary element of the A<i>s</i>vamedha), see VI, 6, 1, 15-20; for a further and final oblation offered on all these occasions, see <a href="#page_292">p. 292</a>, note <a href="#fn_732">1</a>. He then performs on each day three additional oblations <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a> (increased to four on the last day) which are peculiar to the A<i>s</i>vamedha, and vary from day to day in respect of the deities to whom they are offered. But whilst, in the <i>S</i>rautasûtras, these special oblations are likewise called Audgrabha<i>n</i>a (Katy. XX, 4, 2-10), the author here applies to them the term Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, owing apparently to the fact of their being offered, not to the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i> properly speaking, but to different deities. In the dogmatic explanation of the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as of the ordinary sacrifice, reference was also made (at III, 1, 4, 9) to the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i>, but only incidentally. Harisvâmin, indeed, points out that the designation Vai<i>s</i>vadeva refers in the first place to the invocations (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXII, 20) used with these special oblations (as is, indeed, evident from <a href="sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:2">paragraph 2</a>; cf. also part ii, p. 20, note 1); and the total of seven applied to them does not therefore refer here (as it does in <a href="sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:4">paragraph 4</a>) to the four ordinary and the three special Audgrabha<i>n</i>a oblations, but to the series of dedicatory formulas relating to the latter oblations, as explained <a href="#page_291">p. 291</a>, note <a href="#fn_729">1</a>; and, of course, by implication, to the oblations themselves.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_728"></a><a href="sbe44080.htm#fr_732">290:1</a> Though the Initiation only becomes perfect by the Sacrificer being girded with a hempen zone, whilst kneeling on a double black-antelope skin, and by a staff being handed to him (III, 2, 1, 1-32); on the present occasion, the Sacrificer is on each day, after the performance of the Audgrabha<i>n</i>a oblations, at least to sit down on the antelope skin; whilst on the seventh and last day of the Dîksha<i>n</i>îyesh<i>t</i>i, the remaining ceremonies take place, after which those of the Agni<i>k</i>ayana, viz. the placing of the Ukhâ, or fire-pan, on the fire and the putting of thirteen fire-sticks in the pan (VI, 6, 2, 1 seqq.), &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_729"></a><a href="sbe44080.htm#fr_733">291:1</a> The ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâ XXII, 20 is made up of seven parts, each of which consists of three distinct invocations addressed to the same deity; the seven deities addressed in the whole formula being Ka, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, Aditi, Sarasvatî, Pûshan, Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, and Vish<i>n</i>u; whilst the three invocations to Ka, for instance, are 'Kâya svâhâ! Kasmai svâhâ! Katamasmai svâhâ!' Cf. <a href="sbe44081.htm#13:1:8:2">XIII, 1, 8, 2</a> seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_730"></a><a href="sbe44080.htm#fr_734">291:2</a> Viz. either the Vasus, Rudras, and Âdityas (cf. IV, 5, 7, 2); or those of the sky, the air, and the earth, headed by Sûrya, Vâyu, and Agni respectively.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_731"></a><a href="sbe44080.htm#fr_735">291:3</a> That is, the four Audgrabha<i>n</i>as of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice offered on each of the seven days of the Dîkshâ, and two more added thereto on the seventh day.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_732"></a><a href="sbe44080.htm#fr_736">292:1</a> For a full discussion of this final Audgrabha<i>n</i>a oblation, the only one, it would seem, offered with the regular offering-spoon (<i>g</i>uhû) filled by means of the dipping-spoon (sruva), see III, 1, 4, 2; 16-23; cf. also VI, 6, 1, 21.</p>
