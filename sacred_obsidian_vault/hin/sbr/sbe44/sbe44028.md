 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:1">11:5:4:1</a></font></span>1. He says, 'I have come for Brahma<i>k</i>arya <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">2</font></a>:' he thereby reports himself to the Brahman. He says, 'Let me be a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin (student):' he thereby makes himself over to the Brahman. He (the teacher) then says, 'What (ka) is thy name?'--now Ka is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: he thus initiates him after making him one belonging to Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:2">11:5:4:2</a></font></span>2. He then takes his (right) hand with, 'Indra's disciple thou art; Agni is thy teacher, I am thy teacher, O N.N.!'--now these are two most high and most powerful deities: it is to these two most high and most powerful deities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:3">11:5:4:3</a></font></span>3. He then commits him to the beings:--'To Pra<i>g</i>âpati I commit thee, to the god Savit<i>ri</i> I commit thee;'--now these are two most high and most important deities: it is to these two most high and most important deities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.</p>

'To the waters, to the plants I commit thee,'--he thus commits him to the waters and plants.--'To Heaven and Earth I commit thee,'--he thus commits him to these two, heaven and earth, within which all this universe is contained.--'To all beings I commit thee for security from injury,'--he thus commits him to all beings for security from injury; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:5">11:5:4:5</a></font></span>5. 'Thou art a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin,' he says, and thus commits him to the Brahman;--'sip water!'--water, doubtless, means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is thus what he tells him;--'do thy work!'--work, doubtless, means vigour: 'exert vigour' is thus what he tells him;--'put on fuel!'--'enkindle thy mind with fire, with holy lustre!' is what he thereby tells him;--'do not sleep <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">1</font></a>!'--'do not die' is what he thereby says to him;--'sip water!'--water means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is what he thus tells him. He thus encloses him on both sides with ambrosia (the drink of immortality), and thus the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:6">11:5:4:6</a></font></span>6. He then recites to him (teaches him) the Sâvitrî <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--formerly, indeed, they taught this (verse) at the end of a year <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">3</font></a>, thinking, 'Children, indeed, are</p>

 <p>born after being fashioned for a year <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">1</font></a>: thus we lay speech (voice) into this one as soon as he has been born.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:7">11:5:4:7</a></font></span>7. Or after six months, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year, and children are born after being fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:8">11:5:4:8</a></font></span>8. Or after twenty-four days, thinking, 'There are twenty-four half-months in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:9">11:5:4:9</a></font></span>9. Or after twelve days, thinking, 'There are twelve months in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:10">11:5:4:10</a></font></span>10. Or after six days, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:11">11:5:4:11</a></font></span>11. Or after three days, thinking, 'There are three seasons in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:12">11:5:4:12</a></font></span>12. Concerning this they also sing the verse,--'By laying his right hand on (the pupil), the teacher becomes pregnant (with him): in the third (night) he is born as a Brâhma<i>n</i>a with the Sâvitrî <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' Let him,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p>however, teach a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (the Sâvitrî) at once, for the Brâhma<i>n</i>a belongs to Agni, and Agni is born at once <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">1</font></a>: therefore, he should teach the Brâhma<i>n</i>a at once.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:13">11:5:4:13</a></font></span>13. Now some teach an Anush<i>t</i>ubh Sâvitrî, saying, 'The Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech: we thus lay speech into him.' But let him not do so; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (student) has taken away his (the teacher's) speech: he will become dumb;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore teach him that Gâyatrî Sâvitrî.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:14">11:5:4:14</a></font></span>14. And some recite it to him while he (the student) is standing or sitting on (the teacher's) right side; but let him not do this; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (teacher) has born this (student) sideways, he will become averse to him;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore recite it in a forward (easterly) direction to (the student) looking at him towards the west.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:15">11:5:4:15</a></font></span>15. He (first) recites it by pâdas <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">2</font></a>: there being three breathings, the out-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing; it is these he thus lays into him;--then by half-verses: there being these</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>two (principal) breathings, the out-breathing and the up-breathing <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">1</font></a>, it is the out-breathing and the up-breathing he thus lays into him;--then the whole (verse): there being this one vital air (in man), he thus lays the whole vital air into the whole of him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:16">11:5:4:16</a></font></span>16. As to this they say, 'When one has admitted a Brâhma<i>n</i>a to a term of studentship, he should not carry on sexual intercourse, lest he should generate this Brâhma<i>n</i>a from shed seed; for, indeed, he who enters on a term of studentship becomes an embryo.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:17">11:5:4:17</a></font></span>17. And concerning this they also say, 'He may nevertheless do so, if he chooses; for these creatures are of two kinds, divine and human,--these human creatures are born from the womb, and the divine creatures, being the metres (verses of scripture), are born from the month: it is therefrom he (the teacher) produces him, and therefore he may do so (have intercourse) if he chooses.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:4:18">11:5:4:18</a></font></span>18. And they also say, 'He who is a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin should not eat honey, lest he should reach the end of food, for honey, doubtless, is the utmost (supreme) essence of plants.' But <i>S</i>vetaketu Âru<i>n</i>eya, when eating honey, whilst he was a student, said, 'This honey, in truth, is the remainder (essential part) of the triple science (the Vedas), and he, indeed, who has such a remainder, is an essence.' And, indeed, if a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, knowing this, eats honey, it is just as if he were to utter either a <i>Ri</i>k-verse, or Ya<i>g</i>us-formula, or a Sâman-tune: let him therefore eat freely of it.</p>
