 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:1">4:5:7:1</a></font></span>1. Now, there are here thirty-four utterances, called expiations <a name="fr_959"></a><a href="#fn_953"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Pra<i>g</i>âpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and in like manner are they produced therefrom even to this day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:2">4:5:7:2</a></font></span>2. There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Âdityas; and these two, Heaven and Earth, are the (thirty-second and) thirty-third. And there are thirty-three gods, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the thirty-fourth;--thus he makes him (the sacrificer, or Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a) to be Pra<i>g</i>âpati <a name="fr_960"></a><a href="#fn_954"><font size="1">2</font></a>: now that <a name="fr_961"></a><a href="#fn_955"><font size="1">3</font></a> is, for that is immortal, and what is immortal that is. But what is mortal that also is Pra<i>g</i>âpati; for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is everything: thus he makes him to be Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and hence there are these thirty-four utterances, called expiations.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:3">4:5:7:3</a></font></span>3. Now some call these (formulas) the 'forms of the sacrifice;' but, indeed, they are rather the joints of the sacrifice: this same sacrifice, in being performed, is continually becoming those deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:4">4:5:7:4</a></font></span>4. Now should the cow, which supplies the gharma <a name="fr_962"></a><a href="#fn_956"><font size="1">4</font></a>, fail (to give milk), let them go to another; and at the same place where they otherwise make that gharma (milk) flow <a name="fr_963"></a><a href="#fn_957"><font size="1">5</font></a>, let them place her with her</p>

 <p>head towards the north, or in front of the hall with her face to the east.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:5">4:5:7:5</a></font></span>5. And that which is the right one of the two bones with hair-tufts which protrude on both sides of her tail-bone,--thereon he offers those thirty-four oblations of ghee; for as much as are those thirty-four utterances, so much is the sacrifice: thus he lays the whole sacrifice entirely into her; for therefrom she lets the gharma (milk) flow, and this is the atonement therefore.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:6">4:5:7:6</a></font></span>6. And if any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an oblation with regard thereto on the Âhavanîya during the consecration and the Upasads, and on the Âgnîdhra during the Soma feast--for whatever point of the sacrifice fails, that breaks--and whichever then is the deity in that (special offering), through that one he heals it, through that he puts it together again.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:7">4:5:7:7</a></font></span>7. And if anything <a name="fr_964"></a><a href="#fn_958"><font size="1">1</font></a> be spilt, let him pour water thereon--everything here being pervaded (or obtained) by water--for the obtainment of everything <a name="fr_965"></a><a href="#fn_959"><font size="1">2</font></a>; with a verse to Vish<i>n</i>u and Varu<i>n</i>a,--for whatsoever distress one undergoes here on earth, all that Varu<i>n</i>a inflicts <a name="fr_966"></a><a href="#fn_960"><font size="1">3</font></a>,--(Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 59; Atharva-veda VII, 25, 1),</p>

For Vish<i>n</i>u is the sacrifice, and it is that (sacrifice) of his which now undergoes distress; and Varu<i>n</i>a is the inflicter: thus by both these deities--that whose (sacrifice) undergoes distress, and that which inflicts it--he heals (the joint of the sacrifice), by both he puts it together.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:8">4:5:7:8</a></font></span>8. And let him then touch (the spilt material) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 60), 'To the gods, to the sky hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence accrue to me! to the men, to the air hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence accrue to me! to the Fathers, to the earth hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence accrue to me!'--'To whatever world the sacrifice has gone, thence happiness has come to me <a name="fr_967"></a><a href="#fn_961"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' this is what he thereby means to say.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:7:9">4:5:7:9</a></font></span>9. Here now Âru<i>n</i>i said, 'Why should he sacrifice who would think himself the worse for a miscarriage of the sacrifice? I, for one, am the better for a miscarriage of the sacrifice <a name="fr_968"></a><a href="#fn_962"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' This, then, he said with reference to the adoption of those benedictions.</p>

Perhaps yasyâ<i>m</i> velâyâm has to be taken in the sense of 'at the same time at which they make it flow,' as is done in the St. Petersb. Dict.

 <p><a name="fn_961"></a><a href="sbe2666.htm#fr_967">413:1</a> This last sentence ('To whatever world . . .') is treated as if it belonged to the sacrificial formula, to which it is attached in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ. The mistake (which doubtless there is) probably arose from the omission of the 'iti' in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a. In the Kâ<i>n</i>va text of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the analogous sentence appears clearly as belonging to the exposition, and not to the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ.</p>
