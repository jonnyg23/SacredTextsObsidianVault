 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10">4:5:10</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">TENTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_976"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:1">4:5:10:1</a></font></span>1. If the Soma is carried off, let him say, 'Run about and seek!' If they find it, why should they care? But if they do not find it, atonement is made therefore.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:2">4:5:10:2</a></font></span>2. Now there are two kinds of Phâlguna plants,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_422"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 422</font></a></p>  
 <p>the red-flowering and the brown-flowering. Those Phâlguna plants which have brown flowers one may press; for they, the brown-flowering Phâlgunas, are akin to the Soma-plant: therefore he may press those with brown flowers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:3">4:5:10:3</a></font></span>3. If they cannot get brown-flowering (Phâlgunas), he may press the Syenah<i>ri</i>ta <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">1</font></a> plant. For when Gâyatrî flew up for Soma, a sprig of Soma fell from her, as she was bringing him: it became the Syenah<i>ri</i>ta plant: therefore he may press the Syenah<i>ri</i>ta plant.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:4">4:5:10:4</a></font></span>4. If they cannot get the <i>S</i>yenah<i>ri</i>ta, he may press Âdâra plants. For when the head of the sacrifice was cut off, then Âdâra plants sprung from the sap which spirted from it: therefore he may press Âdâra plants.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:5">4:5:10:5</a></font></span>5. If they cannot get Âdâras, he may press brown Dûb (dûrvâ) plants, for they, the brown Dûb plants, are akin to the Soma: therefore he may press brown Dûb plants.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:6">4:5:10:6</a></font></span>6. If they cannot get brown Dûb plants, he may also press any kind of yellow Ku<i>s</i>a plants. In that case let him also give one cow; and, when he comes out of the purificatory bath, let him again become consecrated, for the atonement for that (use of plants other than Soma) is a second sacrifice. So much then as to those robbed of their Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:7">4:5:10:7</a></font></span>7. Now as to those who burst their Soma-trough (kala<i>s</i>a). If the trough bursts, let him say, 'Try to catch it!' If they catch a handful or a goupenful <a name="fr_984"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">2</font></a> (of Soma), let them perform, as far as is in their power <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_423"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 423</font></a></p>  
 <p>after pouring (water) to it from other ekadhana pitchers. But if they do not catch any, let them perform, as far as is in their power, after pouring out some of the Âgraya<i>n</i>a and pouring (water) thereto from other ekadhana pitchers. And if the trough bursts before the dakshi<i>n</i>â (cows) have been led up, let him then give one cow; and after coming out from the purificatory bath, let him be consecrated again; for the atonement for that (mishap) is a second sacrifice. So much then as to those who burst the trough.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:10:8">4:5:10:8</a></font></span>8. Then as to those by whom any Soma is left over. If any (Soma) be left after the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, let him draw the Ukthya cup from the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t. If any be left after the Ukthya, let him undertake the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in. If any be left after the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in, let them undertake a night (performance) <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">1</font></a>. If any be left after the night (performance), let them undertake a day (performance) <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_981"><font size="1">2</font></a>. But nothing, surely, remains after that <a name="fr_988"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

XXV, 12, 24 seems to take it in the <a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 432</font></a> sense of 'abundantly,' as he circumscribes it by 'prabhâvayanta<i>h</i><font size="-1" color="green">'</font> (which the commentator explains by 'distributing over the several vessels').</p>
 <p><a name="fn_980"></a><a href="sbe2669.htm#fr_986">423:1</a> That is, he is to perform an Atirâtra, see <a href="sbe2661.htm#page_397">p. 397</a>, note <a href="sbe2662.htm#fn_928">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_981"></a><a href="sbe2669.htm#fr_987">423:2</a> Kâty. XXV, 13, 52-14, in that emergency, prescribes either the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman (by which a seventeenth stotra is obtained at the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya sacrifice, for which see more in Kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a V), or the Mahâvrata (see <a href="sbe2673.htm#4:6:4:1">IV, 6, 4, 1</a>, with note <a href="sbe2673.htm#fn_995">2</a>), or the Aptoryâma (see <a href="sbe2662.htm#page_398">p. 398</a>, note <a href="sbe2662.htm#fn_928">2</a>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_982"></a><a href="sbe2669.htm#fr_988">423:3</a> The meaning of this seems to be, that after the Aptoryâma, no other sacrifice remains at which he could dispose of any Soma that might be left (and hence one must finish it at that sacrifice). According to Kâty. ib. 15, he is to repeat the Aptoryâma, if any Soma remains after the first performance.</p>
