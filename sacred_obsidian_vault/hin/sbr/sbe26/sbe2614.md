 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:1">3:3:4:1</a></font></span>1. In the enclosed space (of the cart) <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">1</font></a> he (the Adhvaryu) lays down the black deer-skin, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 30), 'Thou art Aditi's skin;' its significance is the same (as before) <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Thereon he places him (Soma), with, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!' for Aditi being this (earth), and she being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that safe resting-place: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:2">3:3:4:2</a></font></span>2. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin,'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a></p>  
 <p>thereby they rendered it (the sacrifice or Soma) superior to the deadly shaft <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:3">3:3:4:3</a></font></span>3. 'He hath measured the breadth of the earth;'--thus he gains through him (Soma) these worlds, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by whom these worlds have been gained: therefore he says, 'He hath measured the breadth of the earth.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:4">3:3:4:4</a></font></span>4. 'As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing (bhuvana);'--thus he gains through him this All, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by whom this All has been gained: therefore he says, 'As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:5">3:3:4:5</a></font></span>5. 'Verily, all these are Varu<i>n</i>a's ordinances;'--thereby he makes here everything whatsoever obedient to him, and every one that is refractory: therefore he says, 'Verily, all these are Varu<i>n</i>a's ordinances.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:6">3:3:4:6</a></font></span>6. Thereupon he wraps (the Soma) up in the Soma-wrapper, lest the evil spirits should touch him. For this one doubtless is an embryo, and hidden (tiras), as it were, are embryos, and hidden also is that (which is) wrapped up;--hidden, as it were, are the gods to men, and hidden is that which is wrapped up: therefore he wraps him up.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:7">3:3:4:7</a></font></span>7. He wraps him up, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 31; Rig-veda V, 85, 2), 'Over the woods he hath stretched the welkin,' for over the woods, over the tops of the trees, that welkin (or air) is indeed stretched;--'strength (hath he laid) into the coursers, milk into the kine,'--strength means</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a></p>  
 <p>manliness and the coursers are the men: he thereby bestows manliness upon men; and 'milk into the kine' he says, because this milk is indeed contained in the kine;--'Into the hearts Varu<i>n</i>a (hath laid) wisdom, into the homesteads <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">1</font></a> fire;' for into the hearts that wisdom, the swiftness of thought, has indeed entered; and 'into the homesteads fire' he says, because that fire is in the homesteads, with the people;--'Into the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock;' for that sun is indeed placed in the heaven; and 'Soma on the rock' he says, because Soma is in the mountains. This is why he says, 'In the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:8">3:3:4:8</a></font></span>8. If there are two deer-skins <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he then puts up the other by way of a flag <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">3</font></a>;--and if there is only one, he cuts off the neck of the deer-skin and puts it up by way of a flag;--with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 32), 'Mount thou the eye of Sûrya, the eye-ball of Agni, where thou fliest along with the dappled (horses), shining through the wise (Sûrya).' He thereby places Sûrya (the sun) in front, thinking, 'May Sûrya, in front, ward off the evil spirits!' They now drive (Soma) about on a safe (cart), unmolested by evil spirits.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:9">3:3:4:9</a></font></span>9. At the fore-part of the shafts two boards have been put up: between them the Subrâhma<i>n</i>yâ <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>stands and drives. He (Soma), indeed, is too high for (the driver) mounting beside him, for who is worthy of mounting beside him? Therefore he drives while standing between (the boards).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:10">3:3:4:10</a></font></span>10. He drives with a palâ<i>s</i>a branch. Now when Gâyatrî flew towards Soma <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">1</font></a>, a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (or leaves, par<i>n</i>a), either of Gâyatrî or of king Soma; and on falling down it became a par<i>n</i>a (palâ<i>s</i>a) tree; whence its name par<i>n</i>a. 'May that which was there of the Soma nature, be here also now!' so he thinks, and for this reason he drives with a palâ<i>s</i>a branch.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:11">3:3:4:11</a></font></span>11. He urges on the two oxen. If they be both black, or if either of them be black, then let him know that it will rain, that Par<i>g</i>anya will have abundance of rain that year: such indeed is science.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:12">3:3:4:12</a></font></span>12. He (the Adhvaryu) first yokes them, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 33), 'Ye oxen, come hither, patient of the yoke!' for they are indeed oxen, and they are patient of the yoke;--'Let yourselves be yoked, tearless!' for they are now being yoked; and tearless means unscathed;--'not man-slaying,' this means 'not doing wrong;'--'speeding the Brahman,' for they are indeed speeders of the Brahman (worship, or the priests);--'Go ye happily to the sacrificer's dwelling!' this he says in order that the evil spirits may not injure them on the way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:13">3:3:4:13</a></font></span>13. Having then gone round to the back (of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>cart) and taken hold of the drag <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>) <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">2</font></a>, 'Recite to the bought Soma!' or,'--to Soma, now driven about!' whichever way he pleases.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:14">3:3:4:14</a></font></span>14. He then makes (the sacrificer <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">3</font></a>) say the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 34), 'Thou art gracious unto me, go forth, O Lord of the world--,' for he (Soma) is indeed gracious to him, wherefore he heeds no other but him. Even his (Soma's own) kings <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">4</font></a> come (to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>him) to attend the assembly, and he is the first to salute the kings, for he is gracious. This is why he says, 'Thou art gracious.' 'Go forth, O Lord of the world,' he says, because he (Soma) is the lord of beings. 'To all dwellings,' 'all dwellings' doubtless means the limbs; with reference to his limbs he says this, 'May no prowling enemies meet thee! may no waylayers meet thee! May no malicious wolves meet thee!' this he says lest the evil spirits should meet him on his way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:15">3:3:4:15</a></font></span>15. 'Having become a falcon, fly away!' he thereby makes him fly forward after becoming a falcon; for the evil spirits fly not after what is fearful: now he, the falcon, forsooth is the most fearful, the strongest of birds, and as such a one he makes him (Soma) fly forwards when he says, 'Having become a falcon, fly away!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:16">3:3:4:16</a></font></span>16. Now they (can) only hit his body <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 'Go to the sacrificer's dwelling,--that is the place prepared for us.' In this there is nothing obscure.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:17">3:3:4:17</a></font></span>17. Thereupon he recites the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ litany. Even as one would say to those for whom he intends to prepare a meal, 'On such and such a day I will prepare a meal for you;' so does he thereby announce the sacrifice to the gods. 'Subrahma<i>n</i>yôm! Subrahma<i>n</i>yôm! Subrahma<i>n</i>yôm!' thus he calls, for the Brahman indeed moves the gods onward. Thrice he says it, because the sacrifice is threefold.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:18">3:3:4:18</a></font></span>18. 'Come, O Indra!' Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'Come, O Indra!' 'Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of Medhâtithi <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">1</font></a>! Wife of V<i>ri</i>sha<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>va <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">2</font></a>! Bestriding buffalo! Lover of Ahalyâ <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">3</font></a>!' Thereby he wishes him joy in those affairs of his.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:19">3:3:4:19</a></font></span>19. 'O Kau<i>s</i>ika <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">1</font></a>, Brahman, thou who callest thee Gautama <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' Just so has this (formula) been devised in these days by Âru<i>n</i>i, to wit, 'thou who callest thee Gautama:' he may say it, if he choose, and if he does not choose, he need not attend to it <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 'In so and so many days, to the Soma-feast,' (stating) in how many days from hence the pressing is to be.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:20">3:3:4:20</a></font></span>20. 'Ye gods and priests, come hither <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">4</font></a>!' This he says to the gods and Brâhmans, because it is of these two, the gods and Brâhmans, that he has need.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:21">3:3:4:21</a></font></span>21. Thereupon the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> steps up to the front of the hall with the victim for Agni and Soma. Now Agni and Soma have seized him, who consecrates himself, between their jaws, for that consecration-offering above <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">5</font></a> belongs to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, and Vish<i>n</i>u, forsooth, is no other than</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Soma, and the offering is he himself who is consecrated: thus they have seized him between their jaws; and by this victim he now redeems himself <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:22">3:3:4:22</a></font></span>22. Now, some take a firebrand from the Âhavanîya, saying, 'Here is Agni, and here is Soma: with these two thus being together we will redeem ourselves.' But let him not do this; for wheresoever these two are, there they are indeed together.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:23">3:3:4:23</a></font></span>23. It (the victim) is two-coloured, because it belongs to two deities: 'For the sake of concord between the two deities let it be a black-spotted (buck)!' they say; 'for that is most like those two (gods).' If he be unable to obtain a black-spotted buck, it may be a red-spotted one.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:24">3:3:4:24</a></font></span>24. Thereon he makes (the sacrificer) say (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 35; Rig-veda X; 37, 1); 'Homage be to the eye of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a! perform ye diligently this holy service to the god! sing ye unto the far-seeing, god-born light, to Sûrya, the son of the sky!' Thereby he renders homage to it (the victim) and makes it a token of the covenant.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:25">3:3:4:25</a></font></span>25. The Adhvaryu then removes the Soma-wrapper. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 36) 'Thou art Varu<i>n</i>a's stay,' he props (the cart) with the prop. With 'Ye two are the rest of Varu<i>n</i>a's stay,' he pulls out the two wedges. The reason why he says, 'Ye two are the rest of Varu<i>n</i>a's stay <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' is that he, the bought Soma, now indeed is of Varu<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:27">3:3:4:27</a></font></span>27. It is of udumbara wood--udumbara meaning sap and food--for (the sacrificer's) obtainment of sap and food: therefore it is of udumbara wood.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:28">3:3:4:28</a></font></span>28. It reaches up to his navel, for it is there that the food settles, and Soma is food: therefore it reaches up to his navel. Moreover, there is the seat of the seed, and Soma is seed: therefore it reaches up to his navel.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:29">3:3:4:29</a></font></span>29. He (the Adhvaryu) touches it with, 'Thou art the rightful seat (<i>ri</i>tasadanî) of Varu<i>n</i>a!' He then spreads on it the black deerskin with, 'Thou art the rightful seat (<i>ri</i>tasadanam) of Varu<i>n</i>a!' and places him (Soma) thereon with, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varu<i>n</i>a!' The reason why he says, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varu<i>n</i>a,' is that he (Soma) is now of Varu<i>n</i>a's nature.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:30">3:3:4:30</a></font></span>30. Thereupon he makes him (king Soma) enter the hall; and in making him enter, he causes (the sacrificer) to say (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 37; Rig-veda I, 91, 19), 'Whatsoever powers of thine they worship with offering, may they all encompass the sacrifice <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">1</font></a>! Go forth to our dwellings, O Soma, prospering our homes, ever helpful, bestowing abundance of men, not slaying our</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>men!' dwellings meaning houses, he thereby means to say, 'Go forth to our houses, kind, propitious, not doing evil.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:4:31">3:3:4:31</a></font></span>31. Some now pour out a vessel of water beside him, saying that this would be as. one would bring water for a king that has come to him. But let him not do this, for they (who do this) do at the sacrifice what is human, and inauspicious for the sacrifice forsooth is that which is human: let him therefore not pour out water, lest he should do at the sacrifice what is inauspicious.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_211"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_212">79:4</a> 'Asya râ<i>g</i>âna<i>h</i> sabhâgâ<i>h</i>;'--Soma seems to be compared here with an emperor or overlord of kings (adhirâ<i>g</i>o râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âm, V, 4,2,2), who is holding a royal court (ra<i>g</i>asabhâ), or a Darbar, to which the under-kings are flocking. Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to interpret the passage differently: apy asya râ<i>g</i>âna<i>h</i> iti sabhâgâ ity anena râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âm anatikrama<i>n</i>îyam <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a> uktam bhavati; api sambhâvanâyâm madhuparkam âha 'râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>e <i>k</i>â<i>k</i>ârya<i>s</i>va<i>s</i>urapit<i>ri</i>vyamâtulâna<i>m</i> <i>k</i>eti' (Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>hyas.

The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads: For he is his gracious lord, therefore he heeds not even a king; and yet (?) he is the first to salute the kings: thus he is indeed gracious to him: 'esha vâ etasya bhadro bhavati, tasmâd esha na râ<i>g</i>âna<i>m</i> <i>k</i>anâdriyate ’tho pûrvo râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>o ’bhivadati tathâsyaisha eva bhadro bhavati(!).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_212"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_213">80:1</a> Or, they can only shoot after his body, '<i>s</i>arîram evânvavahanti.' The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has athâsyeda<i>m</i> <i>s</i>arîram evânasâ ’nvâvahanti,' i.e. 'Now they only bring his body with the cart.' The MS. of Sâya<i>n</i>a also has 'anvâvahanti,' but it explains it by '<i>s</i>yenîbhâvâd upâdeyasya sârâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>asya bâdhâbhâvâd dhantâ <i>s</i>arîram evânugatya hanti nâtmânam.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_213"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_214">81:1</a> This myth, according to which Indra was supposed to have assumed the form of a ram and to have carried off Medhâtithi, the Kâ<i>n</i>va (or, according to others, to have robbed him of his Soma), appears to be alluded to in Rig-veda VIII, 2, 40. On the possible connection of the myth with the Greek one of Ganymede, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 40. Sâya<i>n</i>a does not explain the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ formula, but remarks, that he has already done so in the Sâma-brâhma<i>n</i>a (viz. in the Sha<i>d</i>vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_214"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_215">81:2</a> According to Rig-veda I, 51, 13, Indra became the wife (menâ) of V<i>ri</i>sha<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>va (Mena); the reason for this transformation being, according to the Sha<i>d</i>vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a Br., that he was in love with Menâ or Menakâ, the daughter of that king (or sage). Ind. Stud. I, p. 38. The later explanation of the simple statement of the <i>Ri</i>k seems of doubtful authenticity, unless the choice of the word menâ for 'wife' was intended by the bard as an allusion to the name of the king's daughter. It is more likely that the myth alluded to in the <i>Ri</i>k had been forgotten at the time of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and a new version of it was invented, based on the 'menâ' of the original. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 383, takes Menâ here as a name.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_215"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_216">81:3</a> This is another of Indra's love-myths about which very little is known. Ahalyâ (Maitreyî) is said to have been the wife of the <i>Ri</i>shi Gautama (or of Kau<i>s</i>ika, according to Sha<i>d</i>v. Br.) and to have been loved by Indra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_216"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_217">82:1</a> According to Sâya<i>n</i>a on Rig-veda I, 10, 11 (where Indra is called Kau<i>s</i>ika, 'favourable to the Ku<i>s</i>ikas') Ku<i>s</i>ika desired to have a son equal to Indra, whence the latter was born as Ku<i>s</i>ika's son Gâthin (Gâdhin). Differently Sây. on Taitt. Âr. I, 12, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_217"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_218">82:2</a> The Sha<i>d</i>v. Br. (Ind. Stud. I, p. 38) explains this as follows:--The Gods and Asuras were at war with each other. Gotama was performing austerities between them. Indra went up to him and said, 'Go out as our spy.' 'I cannot,' he replied. 'Then I will go in your form.' 'As thou thinkest fit!' And because he (Indra) went about in the form of Gotama, passing himself off as Gotama, therefore he says, 'thou who callest thee Gotama.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_218"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_219">82:3</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text also states that this last portion of the formula was devised by Âru<i>n</i>i, but nothing is said as to its use being optional.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_219"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_220">82:4</a> For variations of this concluding part of the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ in different schools, see Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. I, 3, 3 seq.; also notes to <a href="sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:10">III, 9, 3, 10</a>; IV, 9, 6, 25 (<font size="-1" color="green">?</font>); Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 383.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_221">82:5</a> See <a href="sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:1">III, 1, 3, 1</a> seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_221"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_222">83:1</a> 'By this victim he redeems himself, the victim, and with that redeemed self, now his own, he sacrifices.' Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_222"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_223">83:2</a> Skambha visar<i>g</i>anî ('support or pin of the prop') is taken by Sâya<i>n</i>a in the sense of 'offshoot of the prop' or 'that which is let go (s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a) by the prop.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_223"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_224">83:3</a> I.e. belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a or is of Varu<i>n</i>a's nature (varu<i>n</i>yo <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a> bhavati). Sâya<i>n</i>a (if the MS. is correct) takes it in the sense of 'is Varu<i>n</i>a himself,' etasmin krîtâvasare somo varu<i>n</i>o bhavati.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="sbe2614.htm#fr_225">84:1</a> Or, 'may the sacrifice encompass them all,' if, with Grassmann and Ludwig, we read 'ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>h</i>' instead of 'ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>am.' This verse is likewise recited (? at the same time) by the Hot<i>ri</i>, see <a href="#page_79">p. 79</a>, note <a href="#fn_209">2</a>.</p>
