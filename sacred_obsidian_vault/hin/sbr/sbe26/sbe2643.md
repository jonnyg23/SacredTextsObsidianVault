 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:1">4:1:4:1</a></font></span>1. Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, forsooth, are his intelligence and will; and as such belonging to his self: whenever he desires anything in his mind, as 'Would that this were mine! I might do this!' that is intelligence; and whenever that is accomplished, that is will <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Now intelligence indeed is Mitra, and will is</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Varu<i>n</i>a; and Mitra is the priesthood, and Varu<i>n</i>a the nobility; and the priesthood is the conceiver, and the noble is the doer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:2">4:1:4:2</a></font></span>2. Now in the beginning these two, the priesthood and the nobility, were separate: then Mitra, the priesthood, could stand without Varu<i>n</i>a, the nobility.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:3">4:1:4:3</a></font></span>3. Not Varu<i>n</i>a, the nobility, without Mitra, the priesthood: whatever deed Varu<i>n</i>a did unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein, forsooth, he succeeded not.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:4">4:1:4:4</a></font></span>4. Varu<i>n</i>a, the nobility, then called upon Mitra, the priesthood, saying, 'Turn thou unto me that we may unite: I will place thee foremost, sped by thee, I will do deeds!'--'So be it!' So the two united; and therefrom resulted that graha to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:5">4:1:4:5</a></font></span>5. Such, then, is the office of Purohita (placed foremost, domestic priest). Wherefore let not a Brâhman desire to become the Purohita of any one Kshatriya (he may meet with), as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness unite; nor should a Kshatriya make any Brâhman (he may meet with) his Purohita, as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness unite.--Whatever deed, sped by Mitra, the priesthood, Varu<i>n</i>a thenceforward did, in that he succeeded.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:6">4:1:4:6</a></font></span>6. Hence it is quite proper that a Brâhman should be without a king, but were he to obtain a king, it would be conducive to the success (of both). It is, however, quite improper that a king should be without a Brâhman, for whatever deed he does, unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein he succeeds not. Wherefore a Kshatriya who intends to do a deed ought by all means to resort to a Brâhman, for</p>  
 <p><a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a></p>  
 <p>he verily succeeds only in the deed sped by the Brâhman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:7">4:1:4:7</a></font></span>7. Now he draws (the Maitrâ-varu<i>n</i>a graha) from that (stream of Soma) <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 9; Rig-veda II, 41, 4), 'This Soma, O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, hath been pressed for you; ye holy, now hear my cry!--Thou art taken with a support <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">2</font></a>!--Thee for Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:8">4:1:4:8</a></font></span>8. He mixes it with milk. The reason why he mixes it with milk is this. Soma, forsooth, was V<i>ri</i>tra. Now when the gods slew him, they said to Mitra, 'Thou also slayest!' But he liked it not and said, 'Surely, I am every one's friend (mitra): being no friend, I shall become an enemy (or, other than Mitra, Amitra).'--'Then we shall exclude thee from the sacrifice!'--Then said he, 'I, too, slay!' Thereupon the cattle went from him, saying, 'Being a friend, he has become an enemy!' Thus he was deprived of the cattle. By mixing (the Soma) with milk, the gods then supplied him with cattle; and in like manner does this (priest) now supply him (the sacrificer or Mitra) with cattle by mixing (the Soma) with milk.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:9">4:1:4:9</a></font></span>9. As to this they say, 'Surely he liked it not to slay!' Thus, what milk there is in this (mixture) that belongs to Mitra, but the Soma belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a: therefore one mixes it with milk.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:4:10">4:1:4:10</a></font></span>10. He mixes it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 10; Rig-veda IV, 42, 10), 'May we delight in the wealth we have gained, the gods in the offering, the kine in pasture! that unfailing milch cow,</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, grant ye unto us day by day!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' he deposits it. Now as to why he says, 'Thee for truth and life,'--the truth is Mitra <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">2</font></a>, since Mitra is the Brahman, and the truth is the Brahman (sacerdotium or sacred writ);--and life is Varu<i>n</i>a, since Varu<i>n</i>a is the year, and life is the year: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life!'</p>
