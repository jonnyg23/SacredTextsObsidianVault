One may perform with the (ordinary) set of eleven victims. He seizes one for Agni as the first victim, and one for Varu<i>n</i>a (as the last); then again one for Agni.: in this way let him perform with the set of eleven victims <a name="fr_998"></a><a href="#fn_992"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:3:2">4:6:3:2</a></font></span>2. Or one may day after day seize a victim for Indra and Agni; for all the gods are Agni, since in Agni offering is made to all the deities; and Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: thus he neither offends any of the deities, nor does he offend him who is the deity of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:3:3">4:6:3:3</a></font></span>3. Then as to the manner (of animal offering) in accordance with the Stoma <a name="fr_999"></a><a href="#fn_993"><font size="1">3</font></a>. At the Agnish<i>t</i>oma</p>

 <p>let him seize a (victim) for Agni; for it is befitting that at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma ('Agni's praise') he should seize a victim for Agni. If it be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him seize as the second (victim) one for Indra and Agni, for the hymns (uktha) <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_994"><font size="1">1</font></a> belong to Indra and Agni. If it be a Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in sacrifice, let him seize as the third (victim) one for Indra; for the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in (graha) is Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let him seize as the fourth (victim) one for Sarasvatî; for Sarasvatî is Vâ<i>k</i> (speech), and Vâ<i>k</i> is a female, and so is râtri (fem., 'night') female. Thus he duly distinguishes between the sacrificial performances. Such are the three manners (of animal offering): he may perform in whichever manner he pleases. Two victims must needs be seized,--for Sûrya he seizes the second en the Vishuvant day, and for Pra<i>g</i>âpati at the Mahâvrata.</p>

He is to sacrifice one victim each day, and if after the eleventh day, the performance is to go on (as at the Dvâda<i>s</i>âha), he is to begin anew with the first victim of the ekâda<i>s</i>inî. According to the Kâ<i>n</i>va text and Kâty. XII, 6, 17 he is on such an odd day to immolate all the remaining victims of the set of eleven. Thus on the last (twelfth) day of the Dvâda<i>s</i>âha--the Udayanîya Atirâtra--he would have to sacrifice the entire set of eleven victims.</p>
