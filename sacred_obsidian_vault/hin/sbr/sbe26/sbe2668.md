When he performs a twelve days’ sacrifice with transposed metres (Dvâda<i>s</i>âha vyû<i>dh</i>a<i>kh</i>andas), then he (the Adhvaryu) transposes the grahas (cups of Soma); and both the Udgât<i>ri</i> and the Hot<i>ri</i> transpose the metres. Now there is first that normal Tryaha (triduum), with settled metres <a name="fr_976"></a><a href="#fn_970"><font size="1">1</font></a>: there he draws the cup beginning with the Aindravâyava.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:2">4:5:9:2</a></font></span>2. Then, on the fourth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Âgraya<i>n</i>a,--for that fourth day is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's own; and the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is the self, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the self: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the Âgraya<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:3">4:5:9:3</a></font></span>3. Having drawn that (Âgraya<i>n</i>a) cup, he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs <a name="fr_977"></a><a href="#fn_971"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup) <a name="fr_978"></a><a href="#fn_972"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and (the Adhvaryu) draws (the other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that cup (in the order of performance comes), he utters 'Hi<i>m</i>' and deposits it. Then follows that normal <a name="fr_979"></a><a href="#fn_973"><font size="1">3</font></a> fifth day; on that he draws the cups beginning with the Aindravâyava.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:4">4:5:9:4</a></font></span>4. Thereupon, on the sixth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the <i>S</i>ukra; for that sixth day is Indra's own, and the <i>S</i>ukra (bright, clear) is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed is Indra: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the <i>S</i>ukra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:5">4:5:9:5</a></font></span>5. Having drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near</p>

 <p>holding that (cup); and he draws (the other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:6">4:5:9:6</a></font></span>6. Then, on the seventh day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the <i>S</i>ukra cup; for that seventh day belongs to the B<i>ri</i>hatî ('great' metre); for the <i>S</i>ukra is he that burns yonder, and he indeed is great: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the <i>S</i>ukra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:7">4:5:9:7</a></font></span>7. Having drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup); and he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it. Then follows that normal eighth day: there he draws the cups beginning with the Aindravâyava.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:8">4:5:9:8</a></font></span>8. Then, on the ninth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Âgraya<i>n</i>a; for that ninth day belongs to the <i>G</i>agatî (metre), and the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is the self, and the self (soul) is this whole world (<i>g</i>agat): therefore he draws the cups beginning with the Âgraya<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:9">4:5:9:9</a></font></span>9. Having drawn it, he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup); and he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, when the time of that (cup comes), he utters 'Hi<i>m</i>' and deposits it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:10">4:5:9:10</a></font></span>10. Now they say, He should not transpose the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_421"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 421</font></a></p>  
 <p>cups--the cups being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to transpose them: therefore he should not transpose (the cups).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:11">4:5:9:11</a></font></span>11. But let him, nevertheless, transpose them; for the cups are the limbs, and in sleeping one likes to turn <a name="fr_980"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">1</font></a> his limbs from one side to the other: therefore let him nevertheless transpose them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:12">4:5:9:12</a></font></span>12. Nevertheless, he should not transpose them--the cups being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to transpose (the cups): therefore let him not transpose them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:9:13">4:5:9:13</a></font></span>13. What, then, is the Adhvaryu to do in that case, when both the Udgât<i>ri</i> and Hot<i>ri</i> transpose (change) the metres <a name="fr_981"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">2</font></a>? In that, at the morning pressing, he draws first the Aindravâyava cup; and at the midday pressing the <i>S</i>ukra cup; and at the evening pressing the Âgraya<i>n</i>a cup,--thereby forsooth the Adhvaryu transposes (the cups).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_970"></a><a href="sbe2668.htm#fr_976">418:1</a> That is, three days, on which the order of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma is observed. Hence, having drawn the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma cups (<a href="sbe2640.htm#4:1:1">IV, 1, 1</a> and <a href="sbe2641.htm#4:1:2">2</a>), which must always be drawn first, he draws the Aindravâyava cup (<a href="sbe2642.htm#4:1:3">IV, 1, 3</a>) and so on. The same order is preserved on the fifth, eighth, and last three days. On the fourth and ninth days, on the other hand, he follows up the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma by the grahas of the third pressing, beginning with the Âgraya<i>n</i>a (<a href="sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:21">IV, 3, 5, 21</a> seq.); these being then succeeded by those of the morning and midday pressings; and on the sixth and seventh days the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma cups are succeeded by the grahas of the midday pressing, beginning with the <i>S</i>ukra cup (<a href="sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:2">IV, 3, 3, 2</a>). This change of the proper order of performance, of course, involves a different arrangement of the stotras and <i>s</i>astras (or 'the metres,' as they are called in the texts). This dislocation of the three pressings is afterwards to be rectified by the various cups being 'deposited' on the khara in their normal order. In the <a href="sbe2668.htm#4:5:9:12">last two paragraphs</a> of the present Brâhma<i>n</i>a the author, however, <a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 419</font></a> discountenances this practice of changing the natural order of drawing the cups.</p>
