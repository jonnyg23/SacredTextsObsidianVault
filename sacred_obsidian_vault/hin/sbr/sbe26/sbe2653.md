 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:1">4:3:4:1</a></font></span>1. Now, they slay the sacrifice, when they spread (perform) it:--to wit, when they press out the king (Soma), they slay him; when they quiet the victim, they slay it; and with mortar and pestle, with the upper and nether millstone, they slay the havis offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:2">4:3:4:2</a></font></span>2. When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of dakshi<i>n</i>âs (gifts to the priests) the gods invigorated it: hence the name dakshi<i>n</i>â, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) it. Whatever, therefore, fails in this sacrifice, when slain, that he now invigorates by means of gifts to the priests; then the sacrifice becomes indeed successful: for this reason he makes gifts to the priests.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:3">4:3:4:3</a></font></span>3. Now at the Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, indeed, they give as little as six or twelve (cows <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">1</font></a>), but no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshi<i>n</i>âs of less than a hundred. For</p>

 <p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 341</font></a></p>  
 <p>he, Pra<i>g</i>âpati <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">1</font></a>, forsooth, is the visible sacrifice; and man is nearest to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and he has a life of a hundred years, a hundred powers, a hundred energies. Only by a hundred he invigorates him, and not by less than a hundred: wherefore no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshi<i>n</i>âs of less than a hundred; nor should any one officiate as a priest for a sacrificer at a (Soma-sacrifice) where less than a hundred are given,--'lest he should be an eyewitness when they will but slay and not invigorate him (Soma).'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:4">4:3:4:4</a></font></span>4. Now, truly, there are two kinds of gods; for the gods, forsooth, are the gods; and the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore are the human gods. And the sacrifice to them is twofold, oblations (being the sacrifice) to the gods, and gifts to the priests being that to the human gods, to the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. With oblations, forsooth, one gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. These two kinds of gods, when gratified, convey him to the heavenly world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:5">4:3:4:5</a></font></span>5. But it is to the officiating priests, forsooth, that these gifts of his belong, for they prepare him another self,--to wit, this sacrifice, consisting of <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Ya<i>g</i>us and Sâman and oblations,--that becomes his self in yonder world: 'It is they that have generated me,' from this (consideration) he should give the gifts to officiating priests and not to non-officiating.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:6">4:3:4:6</a></font></span>6. Having gone back to the Gârhapatya fire <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a></p>  
 <p>offers the gift offerings. Having tied a piece of gold in a fringed cloth <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and laid it (into the spoon), he offers. 'May there be a place for me in the world of the gods!' With this hope he offers whoever offers: that same sacrifice of his goes to the world of the gods; and behind it goes the gift he gives to the priests, and holding on to the gift follows the sacrificer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:7">4:3:4:7</a></font></span>7. Now, there are four (kinds of) gifts to priests,--gold, the cow, cloth, and the horse. But it is not proper that he should lay a horse's foot or a cow's foot (into the spoon): hence he ties up a piece of gold in a fringed cloth, and having laid it (into the spoon) he offers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:8">4:3:4:8</a></font></span>8. He offers with two verses to the Sun. For yonder world is shut off by darkness; and dispelling the darkness by that light he reaches the heavenly world: therefore he offers with two verses to the Sun.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:9">4:3:4:9</a></font></span>9. He offers with this gâyatrî verse (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 41; Rig-veda I, 50, 1), 'The lights bear on high that divine knower of beings, Sûrya, that all may see him,--Hail!'--for the gâyatrî is this earth, and she is a safe resting-place hence he thereby stands firmly on this safe resting-place.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:10">4:3:4:10</a></font></span>10. He then makes the second offering with this trish<i>t</i>ubh verse (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 42; Rig-veda I, 115, I), 'The brilliant front <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the gods hath risen,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a></p>  
 <p>the eye of Mitra, Varu<i>n</i>a, and Agni: Sûrya, the soul of the movable and immovable, hath filled the heaven and the earth and the air,--Hail!' whereby he approaches the world (of the gods).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:11">4:3:4:11</a></font></span>11. He then makes either one or two oblations on the Âgnîdhra (fire). The reason why he makes one or two oblations on the Âgnîdhra fire is that Agni rules over beasts (cattle) <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and they lie round about him on every side: it is him he pleases by this oblation, and thus pleased he is gracious unto this (sacrificer), and the latter offers (to the priests a cow) graciously given up by him (Agni).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:12">4:3:4:12</a></font></span>12. He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 43; Rig-veda I, 189, 1), 'O Agni, lead us on a good path unto wealth; thou, O god, that knowest all works! keep thou from us the sin that leadeth astray, and we will offer unto thee most ample adoration,<font size="-1" color="green">'</font>--'Hail!' Thereupon, if he intends to give away a horse, harnessed or unharnessed, let him make a second oblation; but if not, he need not attend to this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:13">4:3:4:13</a></font></span>13. He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 44), 'May this Agni make wide room for us: may he march in front smiting the haters! May he gain riches in the winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies! Hail!' for the horse is a winner of riches (spoils, prizes).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:14">4:3:4:14</a></font></span>14. Thereupon, taking some gold, (the sacrificer)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 344</font></a></p>  
 <p>goes to the hall. South of the altar stand the Dakshi<i>n</i>â (cows). Standing in front of the hall, he respectfully addresses them <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">1</font></a> with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 45), 'By your beauty have I come to beauty.' Now at first cattle did not submit to being given away. Laying aside their own beauteous forms <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">2</font></a> they approached with their (bare) bodies. The gods then went up to them from the offering ground with their (the animals’) own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resigned themselves and became well-disposed to being given away. And in like manner does he now go up to them from the offering ground with their own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resign themselves and become well-disposed to being given away.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:15">4:3:4:15</a></font></span>15. 'May the all-knowing Tutha distribute you!'--Now, Tutha is the Brahman: he thus distributes them by means of the Brahman. And the Brahman knows who is fit to receive a dakshi<i>n</i>â and who is unfit: thus these (cows) of his are given away only to him who is fit to receive a dakshi<i>n</i>â and not to him who is unfit.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:16">4:3:4:16</a></font></span>16. 'Go ye forward in the way of truth,'--for whosoever walks in the way of the gods, walks in the way of truth;--'ye of shining (<i>k</i>andra) gifts!' whereby they walk with that light (<i>k</i>andra, the moon).</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:17">4:3:4:17</a></font></span>17. He then goes to the Sadas, saying, 'Behold thou the heaven, behold the air!' whereby he means to say, 'May I through thee, the dakshi<i>n</i>â, see the (heavenly) world.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:18">4:3:4:18</a></font></span>18. Thereupon he looks on the Sadas, with, 'Unite with the Sadas-priests!' whereby he means to say, 'May the Sadas-priests not go beyond thee!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:19">4:3:4:19</a></font></span>19. He then takes the gold and goes up to the Âgnîdhra (fire-house), saying (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 46), 'May I this day obtain a Brâhman who has a father and forefathers!'--for he who is renowned and of renowned family, is one who has a father and forefathers; and by the gifts which he gives to a renowned (priest), though they be but few, he gains great things.--'A <i>Ri</i>shi, the scion of <i>Ri</i>shis,' for he who is renowned as learned in sacred lore, is a <i>Ri</i>shi, the scion of <i>Ri</i>shis;--'of well-bestowed gifts,' for he indeed is one on whom gifts are well-bestowed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:20">4:3:4:20</a></font></span>20. Having thus respectfully sat down by the Agnîdh, he gives him the gold, with 'Given (râta) by us, go ye to the gods!'--for whatever sacrificial gift he gives unhesitatingly, with a liberal (râta) mind, thereby he gains great things, 'Go ye to the gods,' he says, for he who sacrifices, sacrifices with the hope, 'May there be a place for me in the world of the gods;' and he thus makes him a sharer in the world of the gods.--'Enter ye to the Giver!' whereby he means to say, 'Enter ye into me!' and thus those (cows) <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">1</font></a> do not get lost to him. And as to his giving</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 346</font></a></p>  
 <p>a dakshi<i>n</i>â first to the Agnîdh, it was from thence (from the Âgnîdhra) <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">1</font></a> that all the gods gained immortality: therefore he gives the dakshi<i>n</i>â first to the Agnîdh.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:21">4:3:4:21</a></font></span>21. Then, approaching in the same way, he gives some gold to an Âtreya <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">2</font></a>. For, at the time <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">3</font></a> when they recite the morning prayer, they were once upon a time singing praises here in front <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Now Atri was the Hot<i>ri</i> of the <i>Ri</i>shis. Then the darkness of the Asuras came rushing into the Sadas. The <i>Ri</i>shis said to Atri, 'Come back here, and dispel this darkness!' He dispelled that darkness; and thinking, 'He indeed is the light who has dispelled this darkness,' they brought him this light, gold, for a sacrificial gift,--for gold is indeed light; and by that same splendour and energy the <i>Ri</i>shi dispelled the darkness. And so does he now also dispel the darkness by that light: therefore he bestows gold on an Âtreya.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:22">4:3:4:22</a></font></span>22. Then to the Brahman, for the Brahman watches over the sacrifice from the south. Then to the Udgât<i>ri</i> (chanter); then to the Hot<i>ri</i>; then to the two Adhvaryus, seated in the cart-shed. Then, having returned (to the Sadas he presents gold) to the Prastot<i>ri</i>; then to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a; then to the Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin; then to the Pot<i>ri</i>; then to the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>; then to the A<i>kh</i>âvâka; then to the Unnet<i>ri</i>; then to the Grâvastut; then to the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ. To the Pratihart<i>ri</i> he presents it last, since he is the restrainer(pratihart<i>ri</i>) <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thus in the end restrains (the cows) for him, and so they do not become lost to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:23">4:3:4:23</a></font></span>23. Thereupon he (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Indra, followed by the Maruts!' Now when, in the beginning, Pra<i>g</i>âpati gave gifts, Indra thought within himself, 'Everything here, forsooth, he will give away, and not anything will he leave for us.' He then, to stop the giving, raised up that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' and thereafter he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) gave no more. And in like manner is that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' now raised up to stop the giving, and thereafter he (the sacrificer) gives no more.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:24">4:3:4:24</a></font></span>24; There are, then, four (kinds of) sacrificial gifts: Gold--thereby indeed he preserves his own life, for gold is life. That he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati or Varu<i>n</i>a) gave</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 348</font></a></p>  
 <p>to Agni, performing the office of the Agnîdh (fire-kindler): wherefore now also gold is given to the Agnîdh.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:25">4:3:4:25</a></font></span>25. Then the Cow--thereby he preserves his own breath, for the cow is breath, since the cow is food, and breath also is food: her he gave to Rudra, the Hot<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:26">4:3:4:26</a></font></span>26. Then Cloth--thereby he preserves his own skin, for the cloth is skin: this he gave to B<i>ri</i>haspati, who chanted.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:27">4:3:4:27</a></font></span>27. Then the Horse--for the horse is a thunderbolt: he thereby makes the thunderbolt the leader. And, moreover, he who sacrifices, sacrifices with the hope 'May there be a place for me in Yama's world!' He thus makes him a sharer in Yama's world. This he gave to Yama, the Brahman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:28">4:3:4:28</a></font></span>28. The (proffered) gold he (the Adhvaryu) goes to meet (accepts) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 47), 'Let Varu<i>n</i>a give thee to me (who am) Agni!' for to Agni Varu<i>n</i>a gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou life to the giver, joy (mayas) to me, the receiver!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:29">4:3:4:29</a></font></span>29. And the cow he accepts with, 'Let Varu<i>n</i>a give thee to me, Rudra!' for to Rudra Varu<i>n</i>a gave her. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou breath to the giver, strength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:30">4:3:4:30</a></font></span>30. And the cloth he accepts with, 'Let Varu<i>n</i>a give thee to me, B<i>ri</i>haspati!' for to B<i>ri</i>haspati Varu<i>n</i>a gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou a skin to the giver, joy to me, the receiver!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:31">4:3:4:31</a></font></span>31. And the horse he accepts with, 'Let Varu<i>n</i>a give thee to me, Yama!' for to Yama Varu<i>n</i>a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a></p>  
 <p>gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou a steed (haya<i>h</i>) to the giver, strength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:32">4:3:4:32</a></font></span>32. And whatever other gift he gives that he gives with the hope, 'May I also have this in yonder world!' That he accepts with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 48), 'Who hath given it? to whom hath he given it? Hope hath given it, for Hope hath he given it: Hope is the giver, Hope the receiver. This to thee, O Hope!' Thus he assigns it to a deity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:4:33">4:3:4:33</a></font></span>33. Here they say <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--Let him not assign it to any deity; for whatsoever deity he here kindles, that deity, being kindled, becomes ever more glorious from one day to the morrow; and to whatever fire he here adds fuel, that fire, being kindled, becomes ever more glorious from one day to the morrow; and ever more glorious does he become, whosoever, knowing this, accepts (a gift): even as one offers in kindled fire, so does he offer that (gift) which he gives to one learned in the scriptures. Therefore he who is learned in the scriptures need not assign (the gift to a deity).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_813"></a><a href="sbe2653.htm#fr_816">346:3</a> Viz. early in the morning of the sutyâ day, when the Prâtar-anuvâka is recited. See <a href="sbe2638.htm#page_229">p. 229</a>, note <a href="sbe2648.htm#fn_719">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_814"></a><a href="sbe2653.htm#fr_817">346:4</a> I take 'purâ' in the sense of 'in front' (cf. <a href="sbe2636.htm#3:9:1:12">III, 9, 1, 12</a>), that in the havirdhâna shed, and not in that of 'formerly' (Ind. Stud. X, 558). The Kâ<i>n</i>va text brings out the meaning still more clearly: Sa yad âtreyâya hira<i>n</i>ya<i>m</i> dadâty, atrir hi vâ <i>ri</i>shî<i>n</i>â<i>m</i> hotâ sa yatro <a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a> ha vâ ada âsîna<i>h</i> prâtaranuvâkam anvâha tad dha smaitat purâsîno hotâ <i>s</i>a<i>m</i>saty atha pa<i>s</i><i>k</i>ât tama<i>h</i> sado ’bhipupluve.

 <p><a name="fn_815"></a><a href="sbe2653.htm#fr_818">347:1</a> For the part taken by the Pratihart<i>ri</i> in the chanting of stotras, see <a href="sbe2649.htm#page_310">p. 310</a>, note <a href="sbe2649.htm#fn_747">1</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_816"></a><a href="sbe2653.htm#fr_819">349:1</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text of this paragraph seems more correct: Thus he assigns it to deities; for when he bestows (abhyâdhâ) anything on a deity, that deity thereby shines ever more brilliantly; and whatever (fuel) he adds to the fire, thereby it shines ever more brilliantly: and more glorious does he become from day to day whosoever, knowing it, accepts it thus. Here now Âsuri said, 'But he who is learned in the scriptures need not regard this; for as one puts fuel on kindled fire, and offers on kindled fire, thus he gives who gives gifts to one learned in the scriptures.'</p>
