Hence when they draw that (cup) they produce that self of his. Therein they lay these vital airs, according to as these vital airs, the grahas, are explained <a name="fr_990"></a><a href="#fn_984"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and verily the sacrificer is born with his whole body in yonder world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:2">4:6:1:2</a></font></span>2. Where they draw that (cup), then that is (like) having a hold <a name="fr_991"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and where they do not draw it, then that is (like) having no hold: therefore, then, he draws the A<i>m</i><i>s</i>u.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:3">4:6:1:3</a></font></span>3. He draws it with a vessel of u<i>d</i>umbara wood; for that (cup) is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the u<i>d</i>umbara tree is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's own: therefore he draws it with a vessel of u<i>d</i>umbara wood.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:4">4:6:1:4</a></font></span>4. He draws it with a square vessel; for there are here three worlds: these three worlds he obtains by three (corners). And Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the fourth over and above these three worlds: thus he obtains Pra<i>g</i>âpati by the fourth (corner): therefore he draws it with a square vessel.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:5">4:6:1:5</a></font></span>5. Silently he takes up the pressing-stone; silently he throws down the Soma-plants (a<i>m</i><i>s</i>u); silently he pours water thereon; silently raising (the stone), he</p>

 <p>presses once; silently he offers that (libation) without drawing breath: thus he makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:6">4:6:1:6</a></font></span>6. Now there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at. And if he either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being immortal life,--he lays that immortal life into his own self.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:7">4:6:1:7</a></font></span>7. As to this Râma Aupatasvini said, 'Let him freely breathe out and freely breathe in: if he but offers silently, thereby he makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pra<i>g</i>âpati.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:8">4:6:1:8</a></font></span>8. Now there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:9">4:6:1:9</a></font></span>9. As to this Budila Â<i>s</i>vatarâ<i>s</i>vi said, 'Let him draw it after merely raising (the stone), and let him not press; for they do press for other deities: thus he does different from what he does for other deities; and in that he raises (the stone) thereby indeed the pressing takes place for him.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:10">4:6:1:10</a></font></span>10. As to this Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said, 'Nay, let him press: "The unpressed Soma delighted not the mighty Indra, nor the outpressed draughts without prayer," thus spake the <i>Ri</i>shi (Rig-veda VII, 26, I). For no other deity does he strike but once: thus he does different from what he does for other deities,--therefore let him press!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:11">4:6:1:11</a></font></span>11. Twelve heifers pregnant with their first calf are the priests' fee for this (graha). Now there are twelve months in the year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, and the A<i>m</i><i>s</i>u is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: thus he makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:12">4:6:1:12</a></font></span>12. They have twelve embryo calves,--that makes</p>  
 <p><a name="page_426"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 426</font></a></p>  
 <p>twenty-four. Now there are twenty-four half-moons in the year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, and the A<i>m</i><i>s</i>u is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: thus he makes him to be Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:13">4:6:1:13</a></font></span>13. Now Kaukûsta <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">1</font></a> indeed gave as many as twenty-four heifers with their first calf as dakshi<i>n</i>âs, and a bull as the twenty-fifth, and gold; and truly that is what he gave.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:14">4:6:1:14</a></font></span>14. This (graha) should not be drawn for every one, since this is his (Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a's) self. It should only be drawn for one who is well known, or one who is his (the Adhvaryu's) friend, or one who, being learned in sacred lore, would acquire it by his study.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:1:15">4:6:1:15</a></font></span>15. It should be drawn at a (sacrifice with) a thousand (cows as the priests’ fee); for a thousand is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It should be drawn at (a sacrifice) where the entire property is given away, for the entire property is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It should be drawn at a Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it with all the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, for the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it ('all-conquering') is everything, and this (cup) is everything. It should be drawn at a Vâ<i>g</i>apeya and Râ<i>g</i>asûya, for that is everything. It should be drawn at a sattra (sacrificial session), for the sattra means everything <a name="fr_993"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and this (cup) means everything. These are the drawings.</p>

This graha seems to consist of imperfectly pressed Soma-plants in water. Cf. Kâty. XII, 5, 6-12. See also <i>S</i>at. Br. IV, I, I, 2; Taitt. S. VI, 6, 10; Sây. on Taitt. S. I, p. 603. In the Kâ<i>n</i>va text this Brâhma<i>n</i>a is followed by one on the Adâbhya graha, which is identified with speech.</p>

The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads,--for whomsoever they draw that (cup), his vital airs are, as it were, supplied' with a firmer hold, and, as it were, firmly established (ârambha<i>n</i>avattarâ iva pratish<i>th</i>itâ iva). And for whomsoever they do not draw it, his vital airs are, as it were, without any hold ('haltloser') and quite unrestrained (anârambha<i>n</i>atarâ ivâsyâyatatarâ iva prâ<i>n</i>â<i>h</i>).</p>
