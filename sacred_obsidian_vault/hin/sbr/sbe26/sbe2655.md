 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:1">4:4:1:1</a></font></span>1. Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is his <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">1</font></a> mind: therefore he draws the Sâvitra cup. And, forsooth, Savit<i>ri</i> is his breath (vital air);--when he draws the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u cup, then he puts into him that vital air in front; and when he draws the Sâvitra cup, then he puts into him that vital air behind: thus those two vital airs on both sides are beneficial (or, put into him), both that which is above and that which is below.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:2">4:4:1:2</a></font></span>2. And the sacrifice, forsooth, is the seasons, the year. There, at the morning feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the cups for the seasons; and at the midday feast they are covertly attended to, in that he takes the Marutvatîya libations by means of the two Ritu vessels <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Now here (at the evening feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the seasons, nor is any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_358"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 358</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:3">4:4:1:3</a></font></span>3. But Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and he indeed is all the seasons: thus the seasons, the year, are overtly attended to at the evening feast,--for this reason he draws the Sâvitra cup.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:4">4:4:1:4</a></font></span>4. He draws it with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel. For Savit<i>ri</i> is his mind, and the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u is his breath: therefore he draws it with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel; or with the Antaryâma vessel, for that is one and the same, since the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma are the out-breathing and in-breathing <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:5">4:4:1:5</a></font></span>5. He draws it from the Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha; for Savit<i>ri</i> is his mind, and the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is his body (or self): he thus puts the mind into the body. Savit<i>ri</i> is his breath, and the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is his body: he thus puts the breath into the body.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:6">4:4:1:6</a></font></span>6. He thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 6; Rig-veda VI, 71, 6), 'Bring thou forth boons for us this day, O Savitar, boons to-morrow, boons day by day: O God, through this our prayer may we be sharers of boons, of a good and plenteous abode!--Thou art taken with a support!--Thou art Savit<i>ri</i>'s joy-giver, thou art a joy-giver: give me joy! speed the sacrifice; speed the lord of the sacrifice to (receive) his share!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:7">4:4:1:7</a></font></span>7. Having drawn it, he does not deposit it; for Savit<i>ri</i> is his (Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a's) mind, and hence this mind is restless. And Savit<i>ri</i> is his breath: hence this breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savit<i>ri</i>!' Having called for the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 359</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, 'Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the offering prayer) to the god Savit<i>ri</i>!' The Vasha<i>t</i> having been pronounced, he offers. He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces no Anuvasha<i>t</i> <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--for Savit<i>ri</i> is his mind,--'lest he should consign his mind to the fire;' and Savit<i>ri</i> being his breath,--'lest he should consign his breath to the fire.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:8">4:4:1:8</a></font></span>8. Then with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. The reason why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom, is this: on the Sâvitra graha he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces no Anuvasha<i>t</i>, and it is therefrom that he is about to draw the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha,--thus it is by means of the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva that it becomes supplied with the Anuvasha<i>t</i> for him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:9">4:4:1:9</a></font></span>9. And further why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is his rind, and the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i> (All-gods, or all the gods <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">3</font></a>) are everything here: he thus makes everything here subservient and obedient to the mind, and hence everything here is subservient and obedient to the mind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:10">4:4:1:10</a></font></span>10. And again why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is his breath, and the All-gods are everything here: he thereby puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into everything here, and</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a></p>  
 <p>thus the out-breathing and in-breathing become beneficial (or put) in everything here.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:11">4:4:1:11</a></font></span>11. And again why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. The evening feast belongs to the All-gods: thus indeed it is called on the part of the Sâman, in that the evening feast is called Vai<i>s</i>vadeva on the part of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and in the same way on the part of the Ya<i>g</i>us, by way of preparatory rite, when he draws that Mahâ-vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:12">4:4:1:12</a></font></span>12. He draws it from the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t; for the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t belongs to the All-gods, because therefrom they draw (Soma juice) for the gods, therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: hence the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t belongs to the All-gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:13">4:4:1:13</a></font></span>13. He draws it without a puroru<i>k</i> <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for he draws it for the All-gods, and the All-gods are everything, the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Ya<i>g</i>us and Sâman; and even in that he draws it for the All-gods, thereby it becomes supplied with a puroru<i>k</i> for him: therefore he draws it without a puroru<i>k</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:14">4:4:1:14</a></font></span>14. He thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 8), 'Thou art taken with a support: thou art well-guarded, well-established,'--for well-guarded and well-established is the breath,--'homage to the great bull!'--the great bull is Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures): 'homage to Pra<i>g</i>âpati,' he thereby means to say.--'Thee to the All-gods! this is thy womb,--thee to the All-gods!' Therewith he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 361</font></a></p>  
 <p>deposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. Thereupon he goes (to the Sadas) and sits down (in front of the Hot<i>ri</i>) with his face to the east <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:15">4:4:1:15</a></font></span>15. And when he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites this (verse), 'With one and ten for thine own sake, with two and twenty for offering, with three and thirty for up-bearing (the sacrifice to the gods); with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose them!'--during (the recitation of) this verse to Vâyu the drinking-vessels are unyoked <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for beasts have Vâyu for their leader; and Vâyu</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (wind) is breath, since it is by means of the breath that beasts move about.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:16">4:4:1:16</a></font></span>16. Now once on a time he went away from the gods with the beasts. The gods called after him at the morning pressing,--he returned not. They called after him at the midday pressing,--but he returned not. They called after him at the evening pressing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:17">4:4:1:17</a></font></span>17. Being about to return, he said, 'If I were to return to you, what would be my reward? '--'By thee these vessels would be yoked, and by thee they would be unloosed!'--Hence those vessels are yoked by that (Vâyu), when he (the Adhvaryu) draws the (cups) for Indra and Vâyu and so forth <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And now those vessels are unloosed by him, when he says, 'with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose them;'--teams mean cattle: thus he unlooses those vessels by means of cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:1:18">4:4:1:18</a></font></span>18. Now, had he returned at the morning pressing--the morning pressing belonging to the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî being the priesthood <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">2</font></a>--then cattle would have come to be with priests only. And had he returned at the midday pressing--the midday pressing belonging to Indra, and Indra being the nobility--cattle would have come to be with nobles only. But in that he returned at the evening pressing--the evening pressing belonging to the All-gods, and the All-gods being everything here--therefore there are cattle everywhere here.</p>
