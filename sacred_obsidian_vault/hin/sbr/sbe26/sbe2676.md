 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:1">4:6:7:1</a></font></span>1. Threefold, forsooth, is science; the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>s, the Ya<i>g</i>us, and the Sâmans. The <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>s are this (earth), since it is thereon that he who sings them, does sing them; the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>s are speech, since it is by speech that he who sings them, does sing them. And the Ya<i>g</i>us, forsooth, are the air, and the Sâmans the sky. That same threefold science is used in the Soma-sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:2">4:6:7:2</a></font></span>2. By the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> he conquers this world, by the Ya<i>g</i>us the air, and by the Sâman the sky. Therefore whosoever has learnt one of these sciences, let him endeavour to learn also what is contained in the two others: by the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, forsooth, he conquers this world, by the Ya<i>g</i>us the air, and by the Sâman the sky.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:3">4:6:7:3</a></font></span>3. This, then, is the thousandfold progeny of Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) <a name="fr_1018"></a><a href="#fn_1012"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Indra (obtained for his share) two-thirds, and Vish<i>n</i>u one-third <a name="fr_1019"></a><a href="#fn_1013"><font size="1">2</font></a>: the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>s and Sâmans are Indra, and the Ya<i>g</i>us are Vish<i>n</i>u. Therefore in the Sadas they perform (the <i>S</i>astras and Stotras) with the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Sâman, for the Sadas is Indra's own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:4">4:6:7:4</a></font></span>4. And by means of these Ya<i>g</i>us they, as it were, bring forward (puras) that Vish<i>n</i>u, the sacrifice: hence the name 'pura<i>s</i><i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a' (preparatory ceremony).</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_437"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 437</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:5">4:6:7:5</a></font></span>5. Both the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>s and the Sâmans are Speech, and the Ya<i>g</i>us are the Mind. Now wherever this Speech was, there everything was done, everything was known; but wherever Mind was, there nothing whatever was done, nothing was known, for no one knows (understands) those who think in their mind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:6">4:6:7:6</a></font></span>6. The gods said to Speech, 'Go thou forward and make this known!' She said, 'What will be my reward then?'--'Whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svâhâ, and without Vasha<i>t</i>, that shall be thine!' Hence whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svâhâ, and without Vasha<i>t</i>, that belongs to Speech. She then went forward and made that known, saying, 'Do this so! do this so!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:7">4:6:7:7</a></font></span>7. Therefore they also perform with the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> in the Havirdhâna: he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites the morning prayer, he recites the kindling-verses; he (the Grâvastut) praises the pressing-stones,--for thus, indeed, they (Speech and Mind) became yoke-fellows.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:8">4:6:7:8</a></font></span>8. And hence they also perform with the Ya<i>g</i>us in the Sadas: they raise up the Udumbara post, they erect the Sadas, they throw up the dhish<i>n</i>ya hearths,--for thus they became yoke-fellows.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:9">4:6:7:9</a></font></span>9. That same Sadas they enclose on all sides with a view to that generation, thinking, 'Quite secretly shall be carried on that generation!' for improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees hence even when a husband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse, they run away from each other, for they give offence. Therefore to any one looking into the Sadas, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may look) through the door, for the door is made by the gods.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_438"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 438</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:10">4:6:7:10</a></font></span>10. In like manner they enclose the Havirdhâna on all sides with a view to that generation, thinking, 'Quite secretly this generation shall be carried on!' for improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees: hence even when a husband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse, they run away from each other, for they give offence. Therefore to any one looking into the Havirdhâna, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may look) through the door, for the door is made by the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:11">4:6:7:11</a></font></span>11. Now there, in the Sadas, that male, the Sâman, longs after the female, the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>. From that generation Indra was produced: from fire, indeed, fire is produced, viz. Indra from the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and the Sâman; for Indra they call him that burns yonder (the sun).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:12">4:6:7:12</a></font></span>12. And there, in the Havirdhâna, that male, the Soma, longs after the female, the water. From that generation the moon was produced: from food, indeed, food is produced, viz. the moon from water and Soma; for the moon is the food of him that burns yonder <a name="fr_1020"></a><a href="#fn_1014"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Hence he thereby produces the sacrificer, and for him he produces food: from the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Sâman he produces the sacrificer, and from water and Soma he produces food for him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:13">4:6:7:13</a></font></span>13. Now with the Ya<i>g</i>us the gods first performed sacrifice, then with the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, then with the Sâman and in like manner do they now perform the sacrifice. first with the Ya<i>g</i>us, then with the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, then with the Sâman; for Ya<i>g</i>us, they say, is the same as Ya<i>g</i>as (worship).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:14">4:6:7:14</a></font></span>14. Now when the gods milked (the objects of) their wishes from these sciences, the Ya<i>g</i>us science</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a></p>  
 <p>milked most wishes. It became, as it were, emptied the most; it was not equal to the other two sciences,--the air-world was not equal to the two other worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:15">4:6:7:15</a></font></span>15. The gods desired, 'How can this science become equal to the other two sciences; how can the air-world become equal to the two other worlds?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:16">4:6:7:16</a></font></span>16. They said, 'Let us perform in a low voice with the Ya<i>g</i>us: then that science will become equal to the other two sciences; then the air-world will become equal to the two other worlds!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:17">4:6:7:17</a></font></span>17. They performed with them in a low voice, and thereby strengthened them; and henceforth that science was equal to the other two sciences, and the air-world was equal to the two other worlds. Therefore the Ya<i>g</i>us, while being distinct, are yet indistinct; and therefore the air-world, while being distinct, is yet indistinct (indefinable).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:18">4:6:7:18</a></font></span>18. He who performs with the Ya<i>g</i>us in a low voice, strengthens them; and they, thus strengthened, strengthen him. But he who performs in a loud voice, weakens them, and, being weak, they weaken him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:19">4:6:7:19</a></font></span>19. The <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>s and Sâmans, forsooth, are speech, and the Ya<i>g</i>us are the mind; and so those who perform with the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Sâman are speech, and those who perform with the Ya<i>g</i>us are the mind. Hence nothing whatever is done, unless ordered by the Adhvaryu: when the Adhvaryu says, 'Recite (the invitatory prayer)! Pronounce the offering prayer!' then those who perform with the <i>Ri</i>k perform it. And when the Adhvaryu says, 'Soma becometh pure: turn ye back <a name="fr_1021"></a><a href="#fn_1015"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' then those who perform with the Sâman perform it,--for speech speaks not but what is conceived by the mind.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:20">4:6:7:20</a></font></span>20. Thus, then, the Adhvaryu, the mind, walks, as it were, in front (pura<i>s</i>-<i>k</i>arati): hence the name 'pura<i>s</i><i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_1022"></a><a href="#fn_1016"><font size="1">1</font></a>;' and verily, he who knows this, stands, as it were, in front through prosperity and glory.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:7:21">4:6:7:21</a></font></span>21. Now that same pura<i>s</i><i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a (going before) is nothing else than yonder burning (sun): one ought to perform in accordance with his (the sun's) course. When he (the Adhvaryu) has drawn a cup of Soma, let him turn round in accordance with his course; when he has responded (to the Hot<i>ri</i>'s recitation), let him turn round in accordance with his course; when he has offered a graha, let him turn round in accordance with his course: he (the sun), verily, is the supporter; and whosoever, knowing this, is able to perform in accordance with his course, he, forsooth, is able to support his dependants <a name="fr_1023"></a><a href="#fn_1017"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>
