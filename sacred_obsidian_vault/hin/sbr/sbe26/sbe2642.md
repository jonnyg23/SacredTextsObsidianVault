 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:1">4:1:3:1</a></font></span>1. The Aindra-vâyava (graha), forsooth, is his speech; and as such belonging to his self <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Now Indra, when he had hurled the thunderbolt at V<i>ri</i>tra, thinking himself to be the weaker, and fearing lest he had not laid him low, hid himself. The gods also hid themselves away in the same place.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:2">4:1:3:2</a></font></span>2. The gods then said, 'Verily, we know not if V<i>ri</i>tra be slain or alive: come, let one of us find out, if V<i>ri</i>tra be slain or alive!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:3">4:1:3:3</a></font></span>3. They said unto Vâyu--Vâyu, forsooth, is he that blows yonder--'Find thou out, O Vâyu, if V<i>ri</i>tra be slain or alive; for thou art the swiftest among us: if he lives, thou indeed wilt quickly return hither.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:4">4:1:3:4</a></font></span>4. He spake, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'The first Vasha<i>t</i> of king Soma!'--'So be it!' so Vâyu went, and lo <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">2</font></a> V<i>ri</i>tra slain. He spake, 'V<i>ri</i>tra is slain: do ye with the slain what ye list!'</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:5">4:1:3:5</a></font></span>5. The gods rushed thither,--as (those) eager to take possession of their property, so (it fared with) him (V<i>ri</i>tra--Soma) <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">1</font></a>: what (part of him) one of them seized, that became an ekadevatya (graha, belonging to one deity), and what two of them, that became a dvidevatya <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and what many (seized), that became a bahudevatya;--and because they caught him up each separately (vi-grah) by means of vessels, therefore (the libations) are called graha.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:6">4:1:3:6</a></font></span>6. He stank in their nostrils,--sour and putrid he blew towards them: he was neither fit for offering, nor was he fit for drinking.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:7">4:1:3:7</a></font></span>7. The gods said to Vâyu, 'Vâyu, blow thou through him, make him palatable for us!' He said, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'After thee they shall name those cups.'--'So be it!' he said, 'but blow ye along with me!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:8">4:1:3:8</a></font></span>8. The gods dispelled some of that smell, and laid it into the cattle,--this is that foul smell in (dead) cattle: hence one must not close (his nose) at that foul smell, since it is the smell of king Soma.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:9">4:1:3:9</a></font></span>9. Nor must one spit thereat <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">3</font></a>; even though he should think himself ever so much affected, let him</p>

 <p>go round it windward <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for Soma means eminence, and disease meanness: even as at the approach of his superior the meaner man would get down (from his seat), so does disease go down before him (Soma).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:10">4:1:3:10</a></font></span>10. Then Vâyu blew a second time through him and thereby made him palatable; whereupon he was fit for offering and fit for drinking. Hence those (vessels), though belonging to various deities, are called 'vâyavya (Vâyu's vessels) <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' His (Vâyu's) is that first Vasha<i>t</i> of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:11">4:1:3:11</a></font></span>11. Indra then thought within himself:--'Vâyu, forsooth, has the largest share of this our sacrifice, since his is the first Vasha<i>t</i> of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him: nay, but I, too, will desire a share therein!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:12">4:1:3:12</a></font></span>12. He said, 'Vâyu, let me share in this cup!'--'What will then be?'--'Speech shall speak intelligibly <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">3</font></a>!'--'If speech will speak intelligibly, then will I let thee share!' Thus that cup henceforward belonged to Indra and Vâyu, but theretofore it belonged to Vâyu alone.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:13">4:1:3:13</a></font></span>13. Indra said, 'One half of this cup is mine!'--'Only one fourth is thine!' said Vâyu.--'One half is mine!' said Indra.--'Only one fourth is thine!' said Vâyu.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:14">4:1:3:14</a></font></span>14. They went to Pra<i>g</i>âpati for his decision. Pra<i>g</i>âpati divided the cup (of Soma) into two parts and said, 'This (half) is Vâyu's!' Then he divided the (other) half into two parts and said, 'This is</p>

 <p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Vâyu's!--This is thine!' then he assigned to Indra a fourth part for his share--one fourth is the same as a quarter: henceforward that cup belonged, one fourth of it, to Indra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:15">4:1:3:15</a></font></span>15. Now with this libation there are two puroru<i>k</i> <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">1</font></a>--formulas,--the first belonging to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two invitatory prayers (anuvâkyâ),--the, first to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two praisha (directions),--the first belonging to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two offering prayers (yâ<i>g</i>yâ),--the first to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu: thus he assigns to him (Indra) each time a fourth part for his share.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:16">4:1:3:16</a></font></span>16. He said, 'If they have assigned to me a fourth part each time for my share, then speech shall speak intelligibly only one fourth part!' Hence only that fourth part of speech is intelligible which men speak; but that fourth part of speech which beasts speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which birds speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which the small vermin here speaks is unintelligible.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:17">4:1:3:17</a></font></span>17. Wherefore it has been thus spoken by the <i>Ri</i>shi (Rig-veda I, 164, 45):--'Four are the measured grades of speech; the Brâhmans that are wise know them: three, deposited in secret, move not; the fourth grade of speech men speak.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:18">4:1:3:18</a></font></span>18. He now draws (the graha) from that (stream of Soma) <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 7; Rig-veda VII, 92, I), 'Come nigh to us, O Vâyu, sipping of</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p>the pure (Soma)! Thine are a thousand steeds, O bestower of all boons! Unto thee hath been offered the gladdening juice whereof thou, O God, takest the first draught!--Thee for Vâyu!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:3:19">4:1:3:19</a></font></span>19. And, having withdrawn (the cup), he again fills it <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="sbe2643.htm#fn_645"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 8; Rig veda I, 2, 4), 'O Indra and Vâyu, here is Soma-juice: come ye hither for the refreshing draught, the drops long for you!--Thou art taken with a support <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="sbe2643.htm#fn_646"><font size="1">2</font></a>!--Thee for Vâyu, for Indra and Vâyu!'--with 'This is thy womb <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="sbe2643.htm#fn_647"><font size="1">3</font></a>: thee for the closely united!' he deposits (the cup). As to why he says, 'Thee for the closely united,'--he who is Vâyu, is Indra; and he who is Indra, is Vâyu: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for the closely united!'</p>
