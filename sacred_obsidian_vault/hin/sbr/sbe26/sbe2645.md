 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:1">4:2:1:1</a></font></span>1. The <i>S</i>ukra and Manthin (grahas), forsooth, are his eyes. Now the <i>S</i>ukra, indeed, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and because it burns there <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_672"><font size="1">3</font></a>, therefore it is (called) <i>S</i>ukra ('bright'). And the Manthin, indeed, is the moon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:2">4:2:1:2</a></font></span>2. He mixes it with (barley) meal: thus he makes it to be gruel (mantha), whence it is (called) Manthin. Now those two (sun and moon); forsooth, are the eyes of these creatures; for were those two not to rise, these (creatures) could not distinguish even their own hands.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:3">4:2:1:3</a></font></span>3. One of them is the eater, and the other the</p>

 <p>food <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">1</font></a>; to wit, the <i>S</i>ukra is the eater, and the Manthin the food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:4">4:2:1:4</a></font></span>4. To one of them corresponds the eater, and to the other the food; to wit, the eater corresponds to the <i>S</i>ukra, and the food to the Manthin. Now these two (cups) are drawn for one (person) and offered to another. There are two Asura-Rakshas, <i>S</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a and Marka: for them they are drawn; and to deities they are offered. The reason for this is as follows.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:5">4:2:1:5</a></font></span>5. Now when the gods drove away the Asura-Rakshas, they could not drive away these two; but whatever (sacrificial) work the gods performed, that these two disturbed, and then quickly fled.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:6">4:2:1:6</a></font></span>6. The gods then said, 'Contrive ye how we shall drive away these two!' They said, 'Let us draw two cups (of Soma juice) for them: they will come down to us, and we shall seize them and drive them away.' They accordingly drew two cups (of Soma) for them, and they both came down, and, having seized them, they (the gods) drove them away <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This is why (the two cups) are drawn for <i>S</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a and Marka, but are offered to deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:7">4:2:1:7</a></font></span>7. Also Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said, 'Should we not rather draw them for the deities, since that is, as it were, the sign of conquest <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_675"><font size="1">3</font></a>?' In this, however, he merely speculated, but he did not practise it.</p>

Now some make this the puroru<i>k</i> formula of the <i>S</i>ukra, 'He, the longing, light-enveloped, urged the daughters of the dappled (cloud) along the measurer of the welkin,'--saying, 'We thus make it like him that burns yonder, in that he says "the light-enveloped."'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:9">4:2:1:9</a></font></span>9. But let him make this one the puroru<i>k</i> formula of the <i>S</i>ukra (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 12; Rig-veda V, 44, I), 'In the olden way, in the former way, in every way, in this way (drawest thou) supremacy from him, the barhis-seated, and the bliss-attaining,'--for the eater corresponds to this (<i>S</i>ukra cup), and the eater is supreme hence he says, 'Supremacy from him, the barhis-seated, bliss-attaining,'--and onward strength drawest thou from him, the roaring <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the swift, that winneth those <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">2</font></a> through which thou waxest strong.--Thou art taken with a support: thee for <i>S</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a!'--With 'This is thy womb: protect manhood!' he deposits (the cup); for to this one corresponds the eater, and the man (hero) is the eater: hence he says, 'This is thy womb: protect manhood!' He deposits it on the south part (of the mount), for it is in that direction that yonder (sun) moves.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:10">4:2:1:10</a></font></span>10. Thereupon he draws the Manthin with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 16;</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:11">4:2:1:11</a></font></span>11. He mixes it with (barley) meal: the reason why he mixes it with meal is this. Varu<i>n</i>a once struck king Soma right in the eye, and it swelled (a<i>s</i>vayat): therefrom a horse (a<i>s</i>va) sprung; and because it sprung from a swelling, therefore it is called a<i>s</i>va. A tear of his fell down: therefrom the barley sprung; whence they say that the barley belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a. Thus whatever part of his eye was injured on that occasion in (that part he now restores him and makes him whole by means of this (barley): therefore he mixes (the libation) with meal.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:12">4:2:1:12</a></font></span>12. He mixes it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 17; Rig-veda X, 61, 3), 'At whichever offerings ye two, rushing swiftly as thought, accept with favour the songs--he, the manly, who by the reeds of this (one) hath seasoned <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">5</font></a> in the hand the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (object of his) desire;'--with 'This is thy womb: protect the creatures!' he deposits it (on the north part of the mound); for to this (graha) corresponds the food, and these creatures, the people, are food: hence he says, 'This is thy womb: protect the creatures!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:13">4:2:1:13</a></font></span>13. There are two sprinkled and two unsprinkled chips of the sacrificial stake <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">1</font></a>: the Adhvaryu takes a sprinkled and an unsprinkled one; and in like manner the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> takes a sprinkled and an unsprinkled one. And the Adhvaryu takes the <i>S</i>ukra, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> the Manthin.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:14">4:2:1:14</a></font></span>14. The Adhvaryu cleanses (his cup) with the unsprinkled chip, with, Swept away is <i>S</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a!' In like manner the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> with, 'Swept away is Marka!' Thus even while drawing (the cups), they drive away the two Asura-Rakshas. With 'May the <i>S</i>ukra-sipping gods lead thee forward!' the Adhvaryu walks out (of the cart-shed); with 'May the Manthin-sipping gods lead thee forward!' the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>: thus they lead forward those two (libations) to the deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:15">4:2:1:15</a></font></span>15. Behind the Âhavanîya fire they put their (right) elbows together, and deposit (the cups) on the high altar: the Adhvaryu on the right hip, and the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> on the left--without quitting their hold of them--with 'Unassailable art</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a></p>  
 <p>thou!' whereby they make the high altar unassailable by evil spirits; for they are about, in walking round it, to pass by the fire: hereby, then, they propitiate it, and so the fire does not injure them, while they walk round it on different sides <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:16">4:2:1:16</a></font></span>16. The Adhvaryu walks round it (on the north side) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 13), 'Abounding in heroes, producing heroes'--for to this (libation) corresponds the eater, and the hero is the eater: hence he says, 'Abounding in heroes, producing heroes!'--'encompass thou <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">2</font></a> the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' By saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he invokes a blessing upon the sacrificer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:17">4:2:1:17</a></font></span>17. And the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> walks round (on the south side) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 18), 'Abounding in creatures, producing creatures'--for to this (libation) corresponds the food, and the creatures, the people, are the food: hence he says, 'Abounding in creatures, producing creatures,'--'encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' By saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he invokes a blessing on the sacrificer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:18">4:2:1:18</a></font></span>18. They step out (from the altar) after closing the two (cups with their hands): thereby they make them invisible; whence no one sees yonder sun and moon when they go forward (eastwards). Having gone round to the front (of the stake), they uncover (the cups), and offer them while standing in front: thereby they make them visible; whence every one</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a></p>  
 <p>sees yonder sun and moon when they go backwards. Hence also no one sees the seed which is cast forwards, but every one sees what is produced backwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:19">4:2:1:19</a></font></span>19. They put their elbows together behind the sacrificial stake, unless the fire should blaze up <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">1</font></a>; but. if the fire blaze up, they may join their elbows in front of the stake,--the Adhvaryu with, 'The <i>S</i>ukra (bright), uniting with the sky, with the earth, with the brightly shining;' the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> with, 'The Manthin, uniting with the sky, with the earth, with the manthin-shining.' Thus they make these two (cups) the resting-places of the eyes, and join the two eyes together: whence these two eyes are joined together with bones all round <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:20">4:2:1:20</a></font></span>20. The Adhvaryu throws the unsprinkled stake-chip outside (the altar) with, 'Cast out is <i>S</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a!' and in like manner the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> with, 'Cast out is Marka!' Thus they drive away the two Asura-Rakshas before the offerings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:21">4:2:1:21</a></font></span>21. Thereupon the Adhvaryu throws the sprinkled stake-chip on the Âhavanîya with, 'Thou art the abode of the <i>S</i>ukra!' and in like manner the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> with, 'Thou art the abode of the Manthin!' These two (chips), forsooth, are the kindlers of the eyes,--he kindles the eyes therewith; whence these eyes are kindled.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:22">4:2:1:22</a></font></span>22. Thereon he mutters (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 14), 'May</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a></p>  
 <p>we be the preservers of thine unbroken manhood and prosperity, O divine Soma!' This is the benediction of that performance: he thereby invokes a blessing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:23">4:2:1:23</a></font></span>23. He then calls (on the Agnîdh) for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, and says, 'Urge thou for Indra the Soma-draughts brought forward, the pure, sweet-flowing, of the morrow's morning feast!' As the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered, the Adhvaryu offers; then the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>; then the cup-bearers (<i>k</i>amasâdhvaryu).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:24">4:2:1:24</a></font></span>24. Those two offer while standing in front (of the fire); for these two (libations) are the eyes: thus they put those eyes in the front; and hence these eyes are in the front.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:25">4:2:1:25</a></font></span>25. They offer while standing on both sides of the stake; for what the nose is, that is the sacrificial stake: hence these two eyes are on both sides of the nose.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:26">4:2:1:26</a></font></span>26. Being consecrated by Vasha<i>t</i>, these two (libations) are offered with a prayer. Now it is because the entire Savana is offered after these two (libations) that they attain to this (distinction) <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and the reason why the entire Savana is offered after them, is that they are most distinctly Pra<i>g</i>âpati's own: for they are the eyes, and the eye is the truth, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the truth;--this is why the entire Savana is offered after them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:27">4:2:1:27</a></font></span>27. He offers with,' This is the first consecration, assuring all boons: he is the first, Varu<i>n</i>a,</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:28">4:2:1:28</a></font></span>28. Now when he offers with, 'This is the first--he is the first,' it is just as with cast seed; for the eyes doubtless are formed first <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">2</font></a> hence he offers with, 'This is the first--he is the first'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:29">4:2:1:29</a></font></span>29. He then gives directions:--'Let the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup advance! let the Brahman's, the Chanters’, the Sacrificer's (cups) advance! Ye cup-bearers of the fire-priests <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">3</font></a>, approach and fill up (the cups) with pure Soma!'--this is a composite direction. Having gone round (to behind the high altar) the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> pours his residue (of Soma) into the Adhvaryu's (<i>S</i>ukra) vessel; whereby he makes the food pay tribute to the eater. The Adhvaryu pours it into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup for drinking; because the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vasha<i>t</i>; for the Vasha<i>t</i> is the breath, and that breath has, as it were, departed from him while uttering the Vasha<i>t</i>. Now the draught is breath: thus he puts that breath back into him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:30">4:2:1:30</a></font></span>30. And the reason why they do not take those</p>

 <p>two (cups) behind <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">1</font></a>, but do so take the other cups, is that those two are the eyes. The residue (of Soma), then, he pours into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:31">4:2:1:31</a></font></span>31. They now fill up the cups of the fire-priests. For those residues <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">2</font></a> are remains of oblations, insufficient for offering: he now fills them up again, and thus they become sufficient for offering: therefore they fill up the cups of the fire-priests.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:32">4:2:1:32</a></font></span>32. Thereupon they make the fire-priests offer together <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Now the fire-priests combined convey</p>

 <p>the sacrifice to the gods,--it is them he thereby satisfies together, thinking, 'Satisfied and pleased they shall convey the sacrifice to the gods;' therefore they make the fire-priests offer together.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:1:33">4:2:1:33</a></font></span>33. When (the libation of) the first, or last <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="sbe2646.htm#fn_695"><font size="1">1</font></a> fire-priest has been offered, he addresses them (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 15), 'Let the priests’ offices be satisfied, they that have obtained a good sacrifice of sweet drink; they that are well-pleased, when they have obtained good offering with Svâhâ!' for this is the satisfaction of the priests’ (offices). Thereupon he approaches (to the Hot<i>ri</i>'s hearth) and sits down with his face to the west, with 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed!' for on this occasion the Agnîdh sacrifices last of those that sacrifice: hence he says, 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_672"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_674">278:3</a> This is how Sâya<i>n</i>a takes the passage: <i>s</i>ukragrahas tapati <i>s</i>o<i>k</i>ati dîpyata iti tasya <i>s</i>ukranâmadheyam. It is doubtless the correct interpretation, though the pronouns 'esha' and 'etad' might lead one to refer them to the sun.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_674"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_676">279:2</a> Muir, O. S. T. ii, p. 386, translates apa-han by 'to smite,' which would seem to suit this passage much better than the ordinary meaning 'to beat off, repulse, eject;' but see paragraph <a href="sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:20">20</a>. The corresponding version of the legend in Taitt. S. VI, 4, 10 has 'apa-nud (to drive away).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_675"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_677">279:3</a> Thus this passage is interpreted by Sâya<i>n</i>a, who refers to Pâ<i>n</i>. III, 3, 161 (sampra<i>s</i>ne liṅ) and VIII, 2, 97 (vi<i>k</i>âryamâ<i>n</i>ânâm <a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 280</font></a> pluta<i>h</i>). Possibly, however, 'no svid' many have to be separated from what follows: 'by no means! for deities we should draw them,' &amp;c. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, 'no svit khalu devatâbhya eva g<i>ri</i>h<i>n</i>iyâmeti vidita<i>m</i> hîdam iti, tad u tan mîmâ<i>m</i>sâm eva <i>k</i>akre nety u ta<i>k</i> <i>k</i>akâra.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_676"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_678">280:1</a> The Rig-veda reads 'girâ (through song)' instead of 'dhunim.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_677"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_679">280:2</a> Viz. waters, juice, sap. Professor Ludwig supplies 'plants.' This verse is extremely obscure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_678"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_680">281:1</a> Vena, according to Roth and Grassmann, refers to the Gandharva, as the representative of the rainbow. This view is, however, rejected by Ludwig. The entire hymn is extremely and purposely obscure.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_681"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_683">281:4</a> Ludwig identifies the measurer of the welkin with the moon (Soma). Grassmann takes it in the sense of 'in measuring through the air.'</p>

Professor Ludwig omits the accent in 'a<i>s</i>rî<i>n</i>îta,' thus taking it out of the relative clause; but <a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 282</font></a> even thus, no satisfactory sense, it seems to me, can be extracted from this line. When the Soma is mixed with milk or some other substance (as meal) two stalks of (ku<i>s</i>a) reed-grass are laid on the cup, the accessory substance being then poured through them. Kâty.

 <p><a name="fn_684"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_686">283:1</a> The Petersburg Dictionary takes 'vi-pari-i' in the sense of to turn round.' Cf. Kâty. IX, 10, 8; 'vividha<i>m</i> dakshi<i>n</i>a uttarata<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a paribhogam ishyantau (!),' Sâya<i>n</i>a.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_687"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_689">284:2</a> That is, the cups represent the sockets of the eyes, and the libations the eyes themselves. Perhaps, however, we ought to translate, 'whence these eyes are joined together (so as to be) on both sides of the bone,' the sacrificial stake representing the bone or bridge of the nose. See <a href="sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:25">paragraph 25</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_688"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_690">285:1</a> 'And because these two (libations), having been consecrated by Vasha<i>t</i>, are offered with a mantra, therefore they attain this (distinction) that the entire Savana is offered after them; and the reason why the entire Savana is offered after them, is that these two are its eyes,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_689"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_691">286:1</a> Or, according to Mahîdhara, 'To that Indra offer ye the liquor with Svâhâ!' The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> makes his libation after the Adhvaryu. The Kâ<i>n</i>va texts read, 'When the Vasha<i>t</i> has been uttered, the Adhvaryu offers, then the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>; then the others offer;' and, according to Kâty. IX, II, 2, the <i>K</i>amasâdhvaryus make libations from the cups of the nine <i>K</i>amasins (see note <a href="#fn_693">2</a>, next page) with, 'This to Indra' at the Vasha<i>t</i>, and This to Agni' at the Anu-vasha<i>t</i>. These libations are evidently referred to in paragraph <a href="sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:31">31</a>.</p>

The subordinate priests to whom the dhish<i>n</i>yas (except that of the Hot<i>ri</i>) belong, both those in the Sadas and the Âgnîdhra.

 <p><a name="fn_693"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_695">287:2</a> Viz. the residues in the <i>k</i>amasas of the Hotrakas. The filling (by the Unnet<i>ri</i>) of the cups of the <i>K</i>amasins--Hot<i>ri</i>, Brahman, Udgât<i>ri</i>, (and Sacrificer); Pra<i>s</i>âst<i>ri</i>, Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin, Pot<i>ri</i>, Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, and Âgnîdhra; that of the A<i>kh</i>âvâka remains empty for the present--takes place before the libations from the <i>S</i>ukra and Manthin grahas. Their cups are filled by the Unnet<i>ri</i> with Soma-juice from the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t, with an 'underlayer' and final 'sprinkling' or 'basting' of 'pure' Soma from the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a. Previous to the filling, the Adhvaryu calls on the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a to 'recite to (those cups) being drawn,' the latter then reciting the hymn, Rig-veda I, 36, while the cups are filled. When the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i> is about to be pronounced by the Agnîdh for the <i>S</i>ukra and Manthin libations, the cup-bearers lift (udyam) the cups, and, after the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> has made his libation, they also pour some Soma-juice into the fire. The cup-bearers of the first four <i>K</i>amasins do so twice (and then take their cups back to the Sadas), the others only once. Thereupon the cup-bearers of these last five--the so-called Hotrakas, or subordinate Hot<i>ri</i>s--are summoned again, and their cups having been filled up with 'pure' Soma, the Adhvaryu makes, after the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, two more libations from each at the Vasha<i>t</i> and Anuvasha<i>t</i> respectively. For the offering-formulas and Anuvasha<i>t</i>kâras, see Â<i>s</i>v. V, 5, 18-19. Holding the Agnîdh's cup in his hand, he then goes to the Sadas and sits down facing the Hot<i>ri</i>, whereupon they drink together the Soma in the dvidevatya cups.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_694"></a><a href="sbe2645.htm#fr_696">287:3</a> The phrase 'hotrâ<i>h</i> (fem.) sa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>ayanti' is apparently analogous to the 'patnî<i>h</i> sa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>ayanti' [they perform the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as, or, make the wives (of the gods) participate in the sacrifice] of the <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a> Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a. See part i, p. 256. Indeed Mahîdhara identifies the hotrâs with the metres of the offering-formulas, thus treating them as a kind of deities.</p>
