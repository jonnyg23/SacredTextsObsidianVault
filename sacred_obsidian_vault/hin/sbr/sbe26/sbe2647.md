That Ukthya (graha), forsooth, is his undefined breath (vital air) <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and as such it is that self of his; for the undefined breath is the self; it is his</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 293</font></a></p>  
 <p>vital energy. Hence he draws it by means of this (earth), because of her is the bowl, and he draws it with a bowl;--for undecaying and immortal is this (earth), and undecaying and immortal is the vital energy; therefore he draws it by means of this (earth or bowl).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:2">4:2:3:2</a></font></span>2. He draws it full; for full means all, and the vital energy means all: therefore he draws it full.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:3">4:2:3:3</a></font></span>3. That Dhruva (graha) <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">1</font></a>, forsooth, (also) is his vital energy; by it his body is held together, and the joints are knit together. For (when) the last cup has not yet been drawn from that (Soma juice in the Ukthya vessel) for the A<i>kh</i>âvâka priest,</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:4">4:2:3:4</a></font></span>4. Then he takes the king (Soma) down (from the cart) <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and pours one third of the Vasatîvarîs (into the Âdhavanîya trough). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes (the Ukthya cup) the first of the second pressing (Soma feast), and the last of the first: that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:5">4:2:3:5</a></font></span>5. In like manner at the midday pressing: (when)</p>

 <p><a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 294</font></a></p>  
 <p>the last cup has not yet been drawn therefrom for the A<i>kh</i>âvâka priest, he pours (the remaining) one-third of the Vasatîvarî (into the Âdhavanîya). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes it the first of the second pressing, and the last of the first pressing <a name="fr_709"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">1</font></a>: that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus. And because his body is thereby held together, therefore this (graha) is his vital energy.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:6">4:2:3:6</a></font></span>6. This (Ukthya graha) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion. At the morning feast he (the Adhvaryu) divides it for three songs of praise <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and at the midday feast for three,--this makes six times, for there are six seasons, and the seasons mature all wishes here on earth: for this reason, then, this (libation) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:7">4:2:3:7</a></font></span>7. He draws it without (reciting) a puroru<i>k</i>; for the puroru<i>k</i> is a song of praise, since the puroru<i>k</i> is a <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, and the song of praise is <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>; and the libation is Sâman; and what other (formula) he mutters, that is Ya<i>g</i>us. Formerly these same (puroru<i>k</i> verses) were apart <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_709"><font size="1">3</font></a> from the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>s, apart from the Ya<i>g</i>us, and apart from the Sâmans.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:8">4:2:3:8</a></font></span>8. The gods said, 'Come, let us place them among the Ya<i>g</i>us: thus this science will be still more manifold.' Accordingly they placed them among the Ya<i>g</i>us, and thenceforward this science was still more manifold.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:9">4:2:3:9</a></font></span>9. And the reason why he draws this (graha) without a puroru<i>k</i>, is that the puroru<i>k</i> is praise, (being) a <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, and the song of praise is <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>; and in that he divides it for recitations, thereby indeed it becomes possessed of a puroru<i>k</i>: hence he draws it without a puroru<i>k</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:10">4:2:3:10</a></font></span>10. Now he draws it from that (stream of Soma <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_710"><font size="1">1</font></a>), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 22), 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Indra, possessed of the great (chant), possessed of vigour,'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; wherefore he says 'thee for Indra;' and by 'possessed of the great (chant), possessed of vigour,' he means to say 'for him, the strong;'--'I take (thee) the song-pleasing,' for he indeed takes it for songs of praise;--'what great vigour is thine, O Indra'--whereby he means to say, 'what strength is thine, O Indra'--'for that (I take) thee! for Vish<i>n</i>u--thee!' for he takes it for the life of the sacrifice: hence he says, 'for that--thee! for Vish<i>n</i>u--thee!' With, 'This is thy womb: thee for the songs of praise!' he deposits it; for he indeed takes it for songs of praise.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:11">4:2:3:11</a></font></span>11. He distributes it <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_711"><font size="1">2</font></a> with, 'Thee, the</p>

 <p>god-pleasing <a name="fr_714"></a><a href="#fn_712"><font size="1">1</font></a>, I take for the gods, for the life of the sacrifice.' He who would perform it in this manner would assume the command <a name="fr_715"></a><a href="#fn_713"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but let him rather distribute it to the respective deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:12">4:2:3:12</a></font></span>12. With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, for the life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a priest;--for in verses to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a they (the Udgât<i>ri</i>s) chant praises for this (libation); and he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) afterwards recites verses to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a for the <i>s</i>astra, and offers with a verse to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:13">4:2:3:13</a></font></span>13. With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra, for the life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin; for in verses to Indra praises are chanted for this (libation); and verses to Indra are afterwards recited as a <i>s</i>astra, and offering is made with a verse to Indra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:14">4:2:3:14</a></font></span>14. With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra and Agni, for the life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the A<i>kh</i>âvâka; for in verses to Indra and Agni praises are chanted for this (libation); and verses to Indra and Agni are afterwards recited as a <i>s</i>astra, and offering is made</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a></p>  
 <p>with a verse to Indra and Agni. With, 'Thee . . . . for Indra,' he performs at the midday feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:15">4:2:3:15</a></font></span>15. Now the <i>K</i>arakâdhvaryus <a name="fr_716"></a><a href="#fn_714"><font size="1">1</font></a> divide (the Ukthya libation into three portions), with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises, agreeable to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a!' he (the <i>K</i>arakâdhvaryu) deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sthâlî.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:16">4:2:3:16</a></font></span>16. 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing. I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra!' thus he deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sthâlî.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:17">4:2:3:17</a></font></span>17. 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra and Agni!--This is thy womb: thee for Indra and Agni!' thus he deposits it. He does not at this (third portion) touch the sthâlî with 'Thou art a re-offering.' '. . . . Thee for Indra!' he says each time at the midday feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.</p>  
 <p>Twice he touches the sthâlî with 'Thou art a re-offering;' and silently he puts it down the third time.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:3:18">4:2:3:18</a></font></span>18. But, in order to avoid sameness (of performance), let him not take it out with the 'support;' nor let him deposit it in the 'womb;' for this (Ukthya</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a></p>  
 <p>libation) has at first been taken with the 'support,' and it has at first been deposited in the womb;--and were he now also to take it with the 'support,' and deposit it in the 'womb,' he would assuredly commit (the fault of) sameness. And as to his touching the sthâlî with 'Thou art a re-offering,' he will indeed again take a libation therefrom. Let him not heed this, but let him put down (the vessel) silently.</p>

Each of these potations is preceded by the chanting of an â<i>g</i>ya-stotra, and the recitation of the â<i>g</i>ya-<i>s</i>astra (see next page, note <a href="#fn_708">2</a>). But before the portion of the last-named priest is poured into his cup (<i>k</i>amasa), fresh Soma-plants are taken down from the cart for the midday pressing; one half of the remaining Vasatîvarî water (or one third of the original quantity) being also poured into the Âdhavanîya trough.

This distribution does not however take place till the end of the morning performance; see note to <a href="sbe2646.htm#4:2:2:4">IV, 2, 2, 4</a>; <a href="sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:25">3, 1, 25</a>.</p>

The same phrase occurs I, 9, I, 24, where I translated 'will ensure dominion,'--probably wrongly, though I am by no means sure of the correct meaning. Sâya<i>n</i>a there seems to take it in the sense of 'he bids (the gods grant his request), thus having chiefly his own interest in view'--'pra<i>s</i>âsyante ’to devâ<i>h</i> prârthyamânâ iti pra<i>s</i>âsanam parusha<i>m</i> syât sâkshât svârthaparatva<i>m</i> kuryâd ity artha<i>h</i>.' The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, 'let him not divide (the libation) with this (formula), for he who divides it thus--pra<i>s</i>âsana<i>m</i> kuryât.' Perhaps he means to say, that by using that formula one would put oneself above the gods. At I, 9, 1, 14 'one would give orders (to the gods)' is probably the right translation.</p>
