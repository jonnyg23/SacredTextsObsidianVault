The Â<i>s</i>vina graha <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">3</font></a>, forsooth, is his organ of hearing; hence in drinking it he turns (the cup) all round <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">4</font></a>, since with that ear of his he hears all round.--Now when the Bh<i>ri</i>gus, or the Aṅgiras, attained the heavenly world, <i>K</i>yavana the Bhârgava, or <i>K</i>yavana the Âṅgirasa, was left behind here (on earth) decrepit and ghostlike <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

But <i>S</i>aryâta, the Mânava, just then wandered about here with his tribe, and settled near by that same place. His boys <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">1</font></a>, while playing, setting that decrepit, ghostlike man at nought, pelted him with clods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:3">4:1:5:3</a></font></span>3. He was wroth with the <i>S</i>âryâtas, and sowed discord among them: father fought with son, and brother with brother.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:4">4:1:5:4</a></font></span>4. <i>S</i>aryâta then bethought him <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--'This has come to pass for something or other I have done!' He caused the cowherds and shepherds to be called together, and said--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:5">4:1:5:5</a></font></span>5. He said, 'Which of you has seen anything here this day?'--They said, 'Yonder lies a man, decrepit and ghostlike: him the boys have pelted with clods, setting him at nought.' Then <i>S</i>aryâta knew that this was <i>K</i>yavana.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:6">4:1:5:6</a></font></span>6. He yoked his chariot, and putting his daughter Sukanyâ thereon, he set forth, and came to the place where the <i>Ri</i>shi was.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:7">4:1:5:7</a></font></span>7. He said, 'Reverence be to thee, O <i>Ri</i>shi;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p>  
 <p>because I knew thee not, therefore have I offended thee; here is Sukanyâ <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with her I make atonement to thee: let my tribe live at peace together!' And from that same time his tribe lived at peace together. But <i>S</i>aryâta, the Mânava, departed <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">2</font></a> forthwith, lest he should offend him a second time.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:8">4:1:5:8</a></font></span>8. Now the A<i>s</i>vins then wandered about here on earth performing cures. They came to Sukanyâ, and desired to win her love; but she consented not thereto.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:9">4:1:5:9</a></font></span>9. They said, 'Sukanyâ, what a decrepit, ghostlike man is that whom thou liest with; come and follow us!' She said, 'To whom my father has given me, him will I not abandon, as long as he lives!' But the <i>Ri</i>shi was aware of this.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:10">4:1:5:10</a></font></span>10. He said, 'Sukanyâ, what have those two said to thee?' She told him all; and, when she had told him, he said, 'If they speak to thee thus again, say thou to them, "But surely, ye are neither quite complete nor quite perfect, and yet ye deride my husband!" and if they say to thee, "In what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?" say thou to them, "Nay, make ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!"' They came again to her, and said to her the same thing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:11">4:1:5:11</a></font></span>11. She said, 'But surely ye are neither quite complete nor quite perfect, and yet ye deride my husband!' They said, 'In what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?' She said, 'Nay, make ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!'</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:12">4:1:5:12</a></font></span>12. They said, 'Take him down to yonder pool <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and he shall come forth with whatever age he shall desire!' She took him down to that pool, and he came forth with the age he desired.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:13">4:1:5:13</a></font></span>13. They said, Sukanyâ, in what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?' The <i>Ri</i>shi himself answered them,--'In Kurukshetra yonder the gods perform a sacrifice and exclude you two from it: in that respect ye are incomplete, in that respect imperfect!' And the A<i>s</i>vins departed forthwith, and came to the gods, as they were performing a sacrifice, after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:14">4:1:5:14</a></font></span>14. They said, 'Invite us thereto!' The gods said, 'We will not invite you: ye have wandered and mixed much among men, performing cures.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:15">4:1:5:15</a></font></span>15. They said, 'But surely ye worship with a</p>

 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a></p>  
 <p>headless sacrifice!'--'How with a headless (sacrifice)?'--'Nay, invite us, and we will tell you!'--'So be it!' so they invited them. They drew this Â<i>s</i>vina cup for them; and those two became the Adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice, and restored the head of the sacrifice. Then, in the chapter of the divâkîrtyas <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">1</font></a>, it is explained how they did restore the head of the sacrifice. Hence this libation is drawn after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna, for it was after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna that they arrived.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:16">4:1:5:16</a></font></span>16. They said, 'Well, but we two, being the Adhvaryus, are the heads (leaders) of the sacrifice: transfer ye that graha of ours to this earlier time, to those belonging to two deities <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' Accordingly they transferred that graha for them to a former time, to those belonging to two deities: hence that graha is drawn in the tenth place, and is consecrated by Vasha<i>t</i> in the third place. And as to (the significance of) the A<i>s</i>vins,--the A<i>s</i>vins are manifestly <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">3</font></a> those two, heaven and earth <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">4</font></a>, for it is those two</p>

 <p>that have obtained possession of everything here;--'the lotus-crowned' they (the A<i>s</i>vins) are called: Agni, forsooth, is the lotus of this earth, and the sun that of yonder sky.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:17">4:1:5:17</a></font></span>17. Thus he takes (the Â<i>s</i>vina graha) from that (stream of Soma) <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 11; Rig-veda I, 22, 3), 'Mix ye the sacrifice, O A<i>s</i>vins, with that goad of yours, rich in honey and joyfulness!--Thou art taken with a support <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">2</font></a>! thee for the A<i>s</i>vins!' with 'This is thy womb: thee for the honey-loving <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">3</font></a> (A<i>s</i>vins)!' he deposits it. Now as to why he takes (the graha) with a verse containing (the word) 'honey (madhu),' and deposits it with 'thee for the honey-loving!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:18">4:1:5:18</a></font></span>18. Dadhya<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>, the Âtharva<i>n</i>a, imparted to them (the A<i>s</i>vins) the brâhma<i>n</i>a called Madhu <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">4</font></a>: that (Madhu) is their favourite resort, and with that (favourite resort) of theirs he now approaches them;--hence he takes (their graha) with a verse containing (the word) 'honey,' and deposits it with 'thee for the honey-loving!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:1:5:19">4:1:5:19</a></font></span>19.

The vessel of the graha for Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a is goat-like <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">1</font></a>: this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. The vessel of the graha for the A<i>s</i>vins is lip-shaped: this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. And the reason why (this belongs to) the A<i>s</i>vins is that the A<i>s</i>vins are the heads (mukhya, viz. of the sacrifice), and this head (mukha <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">2</font></a>) is supplied with lips: hence the vessel of the A<i>s</i>vina graha is lip-shaped.</p>

For <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a> another version, apparently more modern, of the same legend, found in the <i>G</i>aiminîya (Talavakâra) Brâhma<i>n</i>a, see Professor Whitney, Proceedings Amer.

It then occurred to him, 'Surely, <i>K</i>yavana, the Bhârgava, or Âṅgirasa, was left behind here, decrepit: him I (must) have somehow offended sorely, thence so great a calamity.' He called his tribe together. Having called the tribe together, he said, 'Who, be he cowherd or shepherd, has noticed anything here?' They said, 'Yonder in the wood lies a decrepit, ghostlike man; him the boys have this day pelted with clods: that is the only thing we have descried (? tad evâdarishma),' &amp;c.

 <p><a name="fn_660"></a><a href="sbe2644.htm#fr_662">275:1</a> Or, according to the Petersburg Dictionary, 'Throw him into yonder pool.' In the Kâ<i>n</i>va text no mention is made of a pool (hrada), but merely of water to which the <i>Ri</i>shi is taken by his wife. I subjoin Professor Whitney's translation of the corresponding passage of the <i>G</i>aiminîya Br. version: They (the A<i>s</i>vins) said to him: "Sage, make us sharers in the Soma, Sir." "Very well," said he; "do you now make me young again." They drew him away to the <i>s</i>ai<i>s</i>ava of the Sarasvatī. He said: "Girl, we shall all come out looking alike; do you then know me by this sign." They all came out looking just alike, with that form which is the most beautiful of forms. She, recognising him . . . . "This is my husband." They said to him: "Sage, we have performed for you that desire which has been your desire; you have become young again; now instruct us in such wise that we may be sharers in the Soma,". . . .</p>  
 <p>Then <i>K</i>yavana the Bhārgavan, having become young again, went to <i>K</i>aryāta the Mānavan, and conducted his sacrifice on the eastern site. Then he gave him a thousand; with them he sacrificed. Thus <i>K</i>yavana the Bhārgavan, having praised with this sāman (the <i>k</i>yāvana), became young again, won a girl for wife, sacrificed with a thousand,' &amp;c.</p>

The term is also applied to Sâma-veda II, 803-5 (Rig-veda X, 170,1-3) in the Uhyagâna II, 12. The reference in the text seems to be to <i>S</i>at. Br. XIV, 1, 1, 8 seq. See, however, Weber, Ind.

 <p><a name="fn_662"></a><a href="sbe2644.htm#fr_664">276:2</a> One might expect the dual 'dvidevatyau,' as, besides the Â<i>s</i>vina graha, there are only two dvidevatya (belonging to two gods) grahas, viz. the Aindra-vâyava and Maitrâ-varu<i>n</i>a. See <a href="sbe2642.htm#page_266">p. 266</a>, note <a href="sbe2642.htm#fn_639">3</a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_664"></a><a href="sbe2644.htm#fr_666">276:4</a> See Muir, O. S. T. v, p. 234. The identification of the A<i>s</i>vins with heaven and earth may have been suggested by Rig-veda VI, 70, 5, <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a> where heaven and earth are called upon to mix the sweet drink, just as is the case with the A<i>s</i>vins in the verse with which their libation is taken.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_667"></a><a href="sbe2644.htm#fr_669">277:3</a> The real meaning of this epithet (mâdhvî) is uncertain.</p>
