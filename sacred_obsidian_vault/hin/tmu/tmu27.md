 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gauṭama</span> addressed Sanaṭkumāra thus: "O Lord, thou art the knower of all ḍharmas and art well versed in all Śāsṭras, pray tell me the means by which I may obtain a knowledge of Brahmaviḍyā. Sanaṭkumāra replied thus:</p>  
 <p>"Hear, O Gauṭama, that Ṭaṭṭva as expounded by Pārvaṭī after inquiring into all ḍharmas and ascertaining Śiva's opinion. This treatise on the nature of Hamsa which gives the fruit of bliss and salvation and which is like a treasure to the yogin, is (a) very mystic (science) and should not be revealed (to the public).</p>  
 <p>"Now we shall explain the true nature of Hamsa and Paramahamsa for the benefit of a brahmachārin (a seeker after Brahman or celibate), who has his desires under control, is devoted to his guru and always contemplates (as) Hamsa, and realises thus: It (Hamsa) is permeating all bodies like fire (or heat) in all kinds of wood or oil in all kinds of gingelly seeds. Having known (It) thus, one does not meet with death.</p>  
 <p>"Having contracted the anus (with the heels pressed against it), having raised the vāyu (breath) from (Mūla) <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">2</font></a> Ādhāra</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (chakra), having made circuit thrice round Svāḍhishthāna, having gone to Maṇipūraka, having crossed Anāhata, having controlled Prāṇa in Viśuḍḍhi and then having reached Ājñā, one contemplates in Brahmaranḍhra (in the head), and having meditated there always 'I am of three māṭrās,' cognises (his Self) and becomes formless. The Śisna <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">1</font></a> (penis) has two sides (left and right from head to foot). This is that Paramahamsa (Supreme Hamsa or Higher Self) having the resplendence of crores of suns and by whom all this world is pervaded.</p>  
 <p>"It (this Hamsa which has buḍḍhi as vehicle) <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">2</font></a> has eightfold vṛṭṭi. (When it is) in the eastern <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">3</font></a> petal, there is the inclination (in a person) to virtuous actions; in the south-eastern petal, there arise sleep, laziness, etc.; in the southern, there is the inclination to cruelty; in the south-western, there is the inclination to sins; in the western, there is the inclination to sensual sport; in the north-western, there arise the desire of walking, and others; in the northern, there arises the desire of lust; in the north-eastern, there arises the desire of amassing money; in the middle (or the interspaces between the petals), there is the indifference to material pleasures. In the filament (of the lotus), there arises the waking state; in the pericarp, there arises the svapna (dreaming state); in the bīja (seed of pericarp), there arises the sushupṭi (dreamless sleeping state); when leaving the lotus, there is the ṭurya (fourth state). When Hamsa is absorbed in Nāḍa (spiritual sound), the state beyond the fourth is reached. Nāḍa (which is at the end of sound and beyond speech and mind) is like a pure crystal extending from (Mūla) Ādhāra to Brahmaranḍhra. It is that which is spoken of as Brahma and Paramāṭmā.</p>  
 <p>"(Here the performance of Ajapā Gāyaṭrī is given).</p>  
 <p>"Now Hamsa is the ṛshi; the metre is Avyakṭā Gāyaṭrī; Paramahamsa is the ḍevaṭā (or presiding deity) 'Ham' is the bīja; 'Sa' is the śakṭī; So’ham is the kīlaka. <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">4</font></a> Thus there are</p>

 <p>six. There are 21, 600 Hamsas (or breaths) <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">1</font></a> in a day and night. (Salutation <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">2</font></a> to) Surya, Soma, Nirañjana (the stainless) and Nirābhāsa (the universeless). Ajapā manṭra. (May) the bodiless and subtle one guide <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">3</font></a> (or illuminate my understanding). Vaushat to Agni-Soma. Then Aṅganyāsas and Karanyāsas occur (or should be performed after the manṭras as they are performed before the manṭras) in the heart and other (seats). Having done so, one should contemplate upon Hamsa as the Āṭmā in his heart. Agni and Soma are its wings (right and left sides); Omkāra is its head; Ukāra and binḍu are the three eyes <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">4</font></a> and face respectively; Ruḍra and Ruḍrāṇī (or Ruḍra's wife) are the feet kanthaṭa (or the realisation of the oneness of jīvāṭmā or Hamsa, the lower self with Paramāṭmā or Paramahamsa, the Higher Self) is done in two ways, (samprajñāṭa <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">5</font></a> and asamprajñāṭa).</p>  
 <p>"After that, Unmanī <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">6</font></a> is the end of the Ajapā (manṭra). Having thus reflected upon manas by means of this (Hamsa), one hears Nāḍa after the uttering of this japa (manṭra) a crore of times. It (Nāḍa) is (begun to be heard as) of ten kinds. The first is chini (like the sound of that word); the second is chini-chini; the third is the sound of bell; the fourth is that of conch; the fifth is that of ṭanṭri (lute); the sixth is that sound of ṭāla (cymbals); the seventh is that of flute; the eighth is that of bheri (drum); the ninth is that of mṛḍaṅga (double drum); and the tenth is that of clouds (<i>viz</i>., thunder). He may experience the tenth without the first nine sounds (through the initiation of</p>

 <p>a guru). In the first stage, his body becomes chini-chini; in the second, there is the (bhañjana) breaking (or affecting) in the body; in the third, there is the (bheḍana) piercing; in the fourth, the head shakes; in the fifth, the palate produces saliva; in the sixth, nectar is attained; in the seventh, the knowledge of the hidden (things in the world) arises; in the eighth, Parāvāk is heard; in the ninth, the body becomes invisible and the pure divine eye is developed; in the tenth, he attains Parabrahman in the presence of (or with) Āṭmā which is Brahman. After that, when manas is destroyed, when it which is the source of saṅkalpa and vikalpa disappears, owing to the destruction of these two, and when virtues and sins are burnt away, then he shines as Saḍāśiva of the nature of Śakṭi pervading everywhere, being effulgence in its very essence, the immaculate, the eternal, the stainless and the most quiescent Om. Thus is the teaching of the Veḍas; and thus is the Upanishaḍ."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_154"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_168">212:1</a> This word "Hamsa" is very mysterious and has manifold meanings according to different standpoints. It is composed of Ham (or Aham) and Sa (ha), which mean "I" (am) "that". In its highest sense, it is Kālahamsa (or Parabrahman). It is also Brahmā when he has Hamsa (or swan) as the vehicle or Hamsa-vāhana. When Hamsa which is the manifestation of Prāṇa is applied to the human breath, we are said to exhale with Ha and to inhale with Sa. It is also called Ajapā-Gāyaṭrī.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_155"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_169">212:2</a> The different chakras of those that are above the anus, in the genitals, navel, heart, and throat, between the eyebrows and in the head.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_156"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_170">213:1</a> This is omitted in the Calcutta edition and seemingly makes no sense here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_157"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_171">213:2</a> This is how a commentator explains.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_158"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_172">213:3</a> This refers to the different petals in the heart. <i>Vide</i> the same in Nāraḍa-Parivrājaka and Ḍhyānabinḍu Upanishaḍs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_159"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_173">213:4</a> Kīlaka means wedge. In the Ajapā manṭra 'Hamsa-so’ham', So’ham is the wedge to which the whole manṭra is fastened.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_160"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_174">214:1</a> One commentator gives the table for 21,600 thus: 60 breaths make one Prāṇa; 6 Prāṇas, one nādi; and 60 nādis, one day and night.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_161"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_175">214:2</a> The words are: Sūryāya, Somāya, Nirañjanāya, Nirabhāsāya. It is with the pronunciation of these words that the different places in the body are touched, <i>viz</i>., Aṅganyāsas and Karanyāsas are performed. The first word is pointed to the heart with the thumb; the second, to the head, and the third, to the hair of the head. With the last, a kavacha (armour) is made by circling the fingers round the head and then circling one hand over another. This process is carried on again after the pronunciation of Ajapā manṭra which follows. Here Soma (moon) is that which is united with Thai or the emblem of the union of the lower and higher Selves. Sūrya or Sun is the causer of the state of one-ness.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_176">214:3</a> As it stands, it means "the bodiless, the subtle and the guide." The original is Aṭanu Sukshmam Prachoḍayāt.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_163"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_177">214:4</a> The three eyes are the two eyes commonly now in use with the Divine eye.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_178">214:5</a> Contemplation with an object as seed and the seedless one.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_165"></a><a href="tmu27.htm#fr_179">214:6</a> A state above manas or when manas is transcended.</p>
