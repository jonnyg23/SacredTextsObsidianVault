 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Then</span> he (Raikva <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a>) asked: "What was at first?" To which (He the Lord) replied:</p>  
 <p>"There was neither Saṭ <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">2</font></a> nor asaṭ nor Saṭ-asaṭ. From it, ṭamas (darkness) was evolved. From ṭamas came bhūṭāḍi; <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">3</font></a>from bhūṭāḍi came ākāś, from ākāś, vāyu; from vāyu, agni (fire); from agni, āpas (water); and from āpas, pṛṭhivī (earth). Then it became an egg. After remaining so for one (divine) year, it split into two and became earth below, <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">4</font></a> the ākāś above and in the midst, the infinite Purusha of a divine form of myriads of heads, eyes, feet and hands. Prior to the bhūṭas (elements), he had evolved Mṛṭyu (time or death) of three letters <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">5</font></a>, three heads, and three feet, and having a khaṇda-paraśu <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">6</font></a> (broken</p>

 <p>axe). To him, Brahma (the Purusha) spoke. He entered Brahma himself and evolved mentally the seven sons <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">1</font></a> and these Havirāts (or sons) as well as the seven prajāpaṭis (progenitors). Brāhmaṇas <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">2</font></a> were born from His mouth, Kshaṭṭriyas from His hands, Vaiśyas from His thighs, and from the feet were born the Śuḍras. The moon was born from His manas (mind), the sun from His eyes, vāyu from (His) ears and prāṇas from (His) heart. Thus all things were born."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khaṇda</span> II</h5>  
 <p>"From apāna came Nishāḍas, Yakshas, Rākshasas, and Ganḍharvas. From (His) bones, arose the mountains. From His hairs arose the herbs and the trees. From His forehead, Ruḍra was born through His anger. The breath of this great Being became the Ṛgveḍa, Yajurveḍa, Sāmaveḍa, Aṭharvaveḍa, Śīkshā (the science of the proper pronunciation and articulation of sounds), Kalpa (the science of methodology), Vyākaraṇa (grammar), Nirukṭa (glossarial explanation of obsolete and other terms in Veḍas), Chhanḍas (prosody or veḍic metre), Jyoṭisha (astronomy), Nyāya (logic), Mīmāmsā (including rituals and veḍānṭa), Dharmaśāsṭras, commentaries, glosses and all beings. This Āṭmā (or the Self of Purusha) is Hiraṇyajyoṭis (or golden or effulgent Light) into which all the universe is absorbed. He divided Āṭmā (his Self) into two moieties; out of one moiety, the woman was created; and out of the other, man. Having become a Ḍeva, He created the Ḍevas. Having become a Ṛshi, He created the Ṛshis; also He created Yakshas, Rākshasas, Ganḍharvas, wild and domestic beasts and others such as cows, bulls, mares and horses, she-asses and asses and Viśvambhara (the Supporter) and Viśvambharā (the earth). Becoming Vaiśvānara (fire) at the end (of creation), He burnt up all objects. Then (in dissolution), pṛṭhivī was absorbed in āpas, āpas in agni, agni in vāyu, vāyu in ākaś, ākaś in inḍriyas (organs),</p>

 <p>inḍriyas into ṭanmāṭras (rudimentary properties), ṭanmāṭras into bhūṭāḍi, bhūṭāḍi into mahaṭ, mahaṭ into avyakṭa, avyakṭa into akshara (the indestructible), akshara into Lamas (darkness). And Lamas becomes one with the supreme Lord. And then there is neither Saṭ nor asaṭ, nor Saṭ-asaṭ. This is the teaching of Nirvāṇa and this is the teaching of the Veḍas. Yea, This is the teaching of the Veḍas."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khaṇda</span> III</h5>  
 <p>"At first, there was Asaṭ, unborn, non-existent, unsupported, soundless, touchless, formless, tasteless, odourless, and decayless. The undaunted man never grieves, as he knows Āṭmā to be great, all-pervading and unborn. It (Āṭma) is prāṇaless, mouthless, earless, tongueless, manas-less, ṭejas-less, eyeless, nameless, goṭraless (or clanless), headless, handless, feetless, non-unctuous, bloodless, non-measurable, neither long nor short, neither gross nor atomic, neither great nor small, endless, indescribable, nonreturnable, non-luminous, not hidden, having neither inside nor outside, neither eating anything nor being eaten by others. Some one (out of many) attains to this (Āṭmā) by the six means of saṭya (truth), ḍāna (charity), ṭapas (religious austerities), non-injury to any creature, celibacy and complete indifference to worldy objects; <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a> and there are no other means. Whoever feels happy with the thought 'I know That', that learned person's prāṇa will never get out of his body at the moment of death, but will become absorbed in Brahman; and being absorbed in Brahman, he attains the state of Brahman Itself as he who knows this."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khaṇda</span> IV</h5>  
 <p>"In the middle of the heart is a red fleshy mass in which is the ḍahara-lotus. Like the lotus, it opens into many (petals). There are ten openings in the heart. The (different kinds of) prāṇas are located there. Whenever he (Āṭmā) is united with</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p>prāṇa, he sees cities with rivers and other variegated things; when united with vyāna, he sees Ḍevas and Ṛshis; when united with apāna, he sees Yakshas, Rākshasas and Ganḍharvas; when united with udāna, he perceives the celestial world, Ḍevas, Skanḍa (Kārṭikeya or the six-faced Mars), and Jayanṭa (Inḍra's son); when united with samāna, he sees the celestial world and the treasures (of Kubera); when united with rambhā (a nādi hereafter given out), he sees whatever is seen or not seen, heard or not heard, eaten or not eaten, asaṭ or Saṭ and all else.</p>  
 <p>"There are ten midis; in each of these are seventy-one. And these become 72,000 branch nādis. When Āṭmā sleeps therein, it produces sound; but when Āṭmā sleeps in the second kośa (or sheath) then it sees this world and the higher as also knows all the sounds. This is spoken of as samprasāḍa (deep sleep rest). Then prāṇa protects the body. The nādis are full of blood, of the colours green, blue, yellow, red, and white. Now this ḍahara-lotus has many petals like a lily. Like a hair divided into 1,000 parts, the nādis called hiṭa are. The divine Āṭmā sleeps in the ākāś of the heart, in the supreme kośa (or ānanḍamaya sheath); sleeping there, it has no desires, no dreams, no ḍeva-worlds, no yajñas or sacrificer, no mother or father, no relative, no kinsman, no thief, or no Brahman-slayer. Its body is ṭejas (resplendent effulgence) and of the nature of nectar (or the immortal). It is as if in sport, a water-lotus. When he returns again to the waking state by the same way (he quitted or went in before to the heart), he is Samrāt <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Thus says he."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khaṇda</span> V <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">2</font></a></h5>

 <p>"At first there was not anything in the least. These creatures were born through no root, no support but the Divine Ḍeva, the one Nārāyaṇa. <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a> The eye and the visible are Nārāyaṇa;</p>

 <p>the ear and the audible are Nārāyaṇa; the tongue and the 'tastable' are Nārāyaṇa; the nose and the 'smellable' are Nārāyaṇa; the skin and the tangible are Nārāyaṇa; manas and that which is acted upon by it are Nārāyaṇa; buḍḍhi and that which is acted upon by it are Nārāyaṇa; ahaṅkāra and that which is acted upon by it are Nārāyaṇa; chiṭṭa and that which is acted upon by it are Nārāyaṇa; vāk and that which is spoken are Nārāyaṇa; the hand and that which is lifted are Nārāyaṇa; the leg and that which is walked upon are Nārāyaṇa; the anus and the excreted are Nārāyaṇa; the genitals and the enjoyment of pleasure are Nārāyaṇa. The originator and the ordainer as also the agent and the causer of changes, are the Divine Deva Nārāyaṇa only. Āḍiṭyas, Ruḍras, Maruṭs, Vasus, Aśvins, the Ṛk, Yajus, and Sāma, Manṭras, Agni, clarified butter and oblation—all these are Nārāyaṇa. The origin and the combination are the Divine Deva Nārāyaṇa only. Mother, father, brother, residence, asylum, friends and dependents are Nārāyaṇa only. The divine midis known as virājā, suḍarśanā, jiṭā, saumyā, moghā, kumārā, amṛṭā, saṭyā, sumaḍhyamā, nāsīrā, śiśirā, surā, sūryā, and bhāsvatī (fourteen nādis in all), that which thunders, sings and rains, <i>viz</i>., Varuṇa, Aryamā (sun), Chanḍramas (moon), Kalā (part), Kavi (Śukra), the creator Brahma and Prajāpaṭi, Inḍra, Kāla (or time) of days, half-days, Kalpa, the upper, and the directions—all these are Nārāyaṇa. That which was and will be is this Purusha only. Like the eye (which sees without any obstacle) the thing spread in the ākāś, the wise ever see this supreme seat of Vishṇu. Brāhmaṇas who are ever spiritually awake, praise in diverse ways and illuminate the supreme abode of Vishṇu. Thus is the exposition to the attaining of Nirvāṇa; thus is the teaching of the Veḍas; yea, thus is the teaching of the Veḍas."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khaṇda</span> VII</h5>

Though He moves in vāyu, vāyu does not know Him. Ākāś is His body. Though He moves in ākāś, ākāś does not know Him. Manas is His body. Though He moves in manas, manas does not know Him. Buḍḍhi is His body. Though He moves in buḍḍhi, buḍḍhi does not know Him. Ahaṅkāra is His body. Though He moves in ahaṅkāra, ahaṅkāra does not know Him. Chiṭṭa is His body.

 <p>"The Āṭmā of all which is immaculate, is located within the cave in the body. Āṭmā which lives in the midst of the body filled with fat, flesh and phlegm in a seat very closely shut up with shining many-coloured walls resembling a Ganḍharva city and with the (subtle) essence going out of it (to other parts of the body), which seat may be likened to a plantain flower and is ever agitated like a water-bubble—this Āṭmā is of an unthinkable form, the Divine Deva, associateless and pure, has ṭejas as its body, is of all forms, the Lord of all, the unthinkable and the bodiless, placed within the cave, immortal, shining, and bliss itself.

 <p>Again Raikva asked Him: "O Lord! what is the seat of Āṭmā which is replete with vijñāna? and how does it leave the body and pervade the universe?" To this He replied: "There is a mass of red flesh in the middle of the heart. In it, there is a lotus called ḍahara. It buds forth in many petals like a water-lily. In the middle of it is an ocean (samuḍra). <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">1</font></a> In its midst is a koka <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">2</font></a> (bird). In it there are four nādis. They are ramā, aramā, Ichchhā and punarbhava. Of these, ramā leads a man of virtue to a happy world. Aramā leads one of sins into the world of sins. (Passing) through Ichchhā (nādi), one gets whatever he remembers. Through punarbhava, he splits open the sheaths; after splitting open the sheaths, he splits open the skull of the head; then he splits open pṛṭhivī; then āpas; then ṭejas; then vāyu; then ākāś. Then he splits open manas; then bhūṭāḍi; then mahaṭ; then avyakṭa; then akshara; then he splits open mṛṭyu and mṛṭyu becomes one with the supreme God. Beyond this, there is neither Saṭ nor asaṭ, nor Saṭ-asaṭ.

 <p>"Anna (food) came from Nārāyaṇa. It was first cooked in Brahmaloka in the Mahā-samvarṭaka fire. Again it was cooked in the sun; again it was cooked in kravyāḍi (lit., the fire that burns raw flesh, etc.); again it was cooked in jwālakīla (the flaming kīla); then it became pure and not stale (or fresh).

 <p>"The wise man should conduct himself like a lad, with the nature of a child, without company, blameless, silent and wise and without exercising any authority. This description of Kaivalya is stated by Prajāpaṭi. Having found with certitude the supreme seat, one should dwell under a tree with torn cloths, unaccompanied, single and engaged in samāḍhi. He should be longing after the attaining of Āṭmā and having attained this object, he is desireless, his desires have decayed. He fears none, though he finds the cause of death in such as elephants, lions, gadflies, musquitoes, ichneuma, serpents, Yakshas, Rākshasas, and Ganḍharvas. He will stand like a tree. Though cut down, he will neither get angry nor tremble. He will stand (or remain) like a lotus. Though pierced, he will neither get angry nor tremble. He will stand like ākāś; though struck, he will neither get angry nor tremble. He will stand by Saṭya (truth), since Āṭmā is Saṭya.</p>

 <p>Again Raikva asked: "O Lord, when this Vijñāna-ghana goes out (of the body or the universe), what does it burn and how?" To which He replied: "When it goes away, it burns prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, uḍāna, samāna, vairambha, mukhya, anṭaryāma, prabhañjana, kumāra, śyena, kṛshṇa, śveṭa, and nāga. Then it burns pṛṭhivī, āpas, ṭejas, vāyu, and ākāś; then it burns the waking, the dreaming, the dreamless sleeping and the fourth states as well as the maharlokas and worlds higher; then it burns the lokāloka (the highest world forming a limit to the other worlds). Then it burns ḍharma and aḍharma. Then it burns that which is beyond, is sunless, limitless, and worldless. Then it burns mahaṭ; it burns avyakṭa; it burns akshara; it burns mṛṭyu; and mṛṭyu becomes one with the great Lord. Beyond Him, there is neither Saṭ nor asaṭ, nor Saṭ-asaṭ.

These doctrines should be taught to him who has supreme devotion to the Lord and as much to his Guru. Then these truths shine in his great soul.
