 <p>they wish in their hearts, if they are purified by honest actions.</p>  
 <p>3. Thus a wise man should practise those restraints until he has purified his bodily frame.</p>  
 <p>4. He who has been purified by those restraints should, after fasting three (days and) nights, begin the performance of that sacred rite through which he wishes to gain the fulfilment of his desires,</p>  
 <p>5. (Reciting) the Kshâpavitra, the Sahasrâksha, the M<i>ri</i>gâra, the two <i>G</i>a<i>n</i>as (called) A<i>m</i>homu<i>k</i>, the Pâvamanîs, the Kûshmâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>îs, and the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>as, addressed to Vai<i>s</i>vânara, <a name="fr_1461"></a><a href="#fn_1461"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. (And) offering with (each of) these (Mantras) boiled rice and clarified butter during seven days, in the morning, at midday, and in the evening, keeping a rigid silence, living on food fit for a sacrifice, restraining his senses and his actions,</p>  
 <p>7. He is freed from all crimes, even mortal sins, after looking on a cross-road at a pot filled with water, (and reciting the text), 'Si<i>m</i>he me manyu<i>h</i>.'</p>  
 <p>8. He is freed from the multitude of sins, committed unintentionally in old age, in youth, and in infancy, and even from those belonging to former births;</p>  
 <p>9. After feeding at the end (of the seven days) Brâhma<i>n</i>as with milk and rice, well. mixed with</p>

 <p>butter, and distributing to them after their dinner cows, land, sesamum, and gold,</p>  
 <p>10. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a becomes internally pure, his guilt being consumed like fuel, and fit for the performance of rites which secure the fulfilment of wishes and of rites like the kindling of the sacred fire.</p>
