 <p>1. (There are) eight marriage-rites. <a name="fr_1022"></a><a href="#fn_1022"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. If (the father) gives (his daughter) to a student (who has not broken his vow of chastity and) who asks for her, after fully enquiring into his learning and character, that (is) the rite .of Brahman (brâhma). <a name="fr_1023"></a><a href="#fn_1023"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. If (the father gives his daughter away) after clothing her and decking her with ornaments, (saying) 'That (is thy wife), fulfil the law (with her),' that (is) the rite of Pra<i>g</i>âpati (prâ<i>g</i>âpatya). <a name="fr_1024"></a><a href="#fn_1024"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. If (the bridegroom) after offering the first burnt oblation of parched grain (receives the maiden) for a bull and a cow, that is the rite of the <i>Ri</i>shis (ârsha). <a name="fr_1025"></a><a href="#fn_1025"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. If (a maiden is given) to an officiating priest within the sacrificial enclosure, while the presents are being taken away, that (is) the rite of the gods (daiva). <a name="fr_1026"></a><a href="#fn_1026"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p>6. The union of a lover with a loving damsel (is called) the rite of the Gandharvas (gândharva).</p>  
 <p>7. (If the bridegroom receives the maiden) after gladdening (the parents) by money, (that is) the rite of the Asuras (âsura).</p>  
 <p>8. (If the maiden is wedded) after being forcibly abducted, (that is) the rite of the Râkshasas (râkshasa).</p>  
 <p>9. If one has intercourse with (a maiden) who is sleeping, intoxicated, or out of her senses (with fear or passion and weds her afterwards, that is) the rite of the Pi<i>s</i>â<i>k</i>as (pai<i>s</i>â<i>k</i>a).</p>  
 <p>10. Among these (eight rites) the four first (named) are (lawful) for a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. Among these also each earlier named is preferable.</p>  
 <p>11. Among the (four) later (named rites) each succeeding one is more sinful (than the preceding ones).</p>  
 <p>12. Among these the sixth and the seventh agree with the law of the Kshatriyas. For power is their attribute.</p>  
 <p>6. Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 33,</p>  
 <p>7. Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 35.</p>  
 <p>8. Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 34.</p>

 <p>10. Vish<i>n</i>u XXIV, 27.</p>  
 <p>12. Vish<i>n</i>u XXIV, 28; Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 29, 34. The meaning of the last clause is that as, according to I, 10, 18, 3, Brahman placed power in the Kshatriyas, they may adopt marriage rites by which a disregard of conventionalities or strength is displayed.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>

 <p>14. For Vai<i>s</i>yas and <i>S</i>ûdras are not particular about their wives, <a name="fr_1028"></a><a href="#fn_1028"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>

 <p>16. Some recommend the Gândharva rite for all (castes), because it is based on (mutual) affection.</p>
