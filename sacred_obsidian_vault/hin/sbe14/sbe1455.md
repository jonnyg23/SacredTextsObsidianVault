 <p>17. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'A thief shall go to the king carrying a club on his shoulder (and say to him), 'Punish me with that, O king, remembering the duty of Kshatriyas.' <a name="fr_1056"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Whether he be punished or be pardoned, the thief is freed from his guilt. But if the king does not punish him, that guilt of the thief falls on him.'</p>  
 <p>18. If he has drunk (the spirituous liquor called) Surâ, he shall scald himself to death with hot (liquor of the) same (kind). <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1057"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>

 <p>32. The sacrificial meat-cake (puro<i>d</i>âsa shall be offered) to Nir<i>ri</i>ti, or to the Râkshasas, or to Yama.</p>
