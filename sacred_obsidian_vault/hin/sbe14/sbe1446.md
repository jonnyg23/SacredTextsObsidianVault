 <p>1. The gods enjoy a pure sacrifice (only); <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. For the gods are desirous of purity and (themselves) pure.</p>  
 <p>3. The following (<i>Ri</i><i>k</i>) declares that, 'To you, O Maruts, the pure ones, pure viands; to you, the pure ones, I offer a pure sacrifice. They who love the pious rites, who are of pure origin, (themselves) pure and purifiers (of others), came duly to the truthful (worshipper).' <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. (He will be) pure (if there is) no blemish on his clothes, therefore let him perform all (acts) that are connected with sacrificing, (dressed) in unblemished clothes. <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. The sacrificer and his wife as well as the officiating priests shall put on dresses which have been washed, and dried by the wind, and which are not in a bad condition. <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p>6. (It shall be) thus from the (beginning of the) Prakrama, <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. And thus at the long Soma-sacrifices and the Sattras;</p>  
 <p>8. And (on other occasions other dresses must be used) in accordance with the injunction (of the Veda),</p>  
 <p>9. Thus at (all) Ish<i>t</i>is, animal sacrifices, and Soma-sacrifices which may be used as spells (against enemies), the priests shall perform (the sacred rites), wearing red turbans and red dresses; (when reciting the hymn seen by) V<i>ri</i>shâkapi (he shall) wear a dress and a mantle of many colours and so forth. <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. At the Agnyâdhâna (sacrifice) the clothes (shall be made) of flax; on failure of such, (dresses) made of cotton or of wool are used.</p>  
 <p>11. Clothes defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen and the like (shall be) cleaned with earth, water and the like. <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. (Dresses) made of T<i>ri</i>pa-bark and v<i>ri</i>kala (shall be treated) like cotton-cloth, <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. Deer-skins like (dresses) made of bark. <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. (Let him) not (use) a mantle which has been wrapped (round the loins, or) on which he has been lying (in his bed), without washing it.</p>  
 <p>15: Let him not employ for the gods anything used by men without beating it on a stone. <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. If solid earth is defiled, (it must be) smeared with cowdung. <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Loose (earth must be cleansed by) ploughing,</p>  
 <p>18. Moist (earth) by bringing pure (earth) and covering (it with that).</p>  
 <p>19. Land is purified in four (ways), by being trod on by cows, by digging, by lighting a fire on it, by rain falling on it,</p>  
 <p>20. Fifthly by smearing it with cowdung, and sixthly through (the lapse of) time.</p>  
 <p>21. Grass placed on unconsecrated ground (must be) washed. <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. (Grass) defiled out of one's sight, (shall be) sprinkled (with water). <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. Small pieces of sacred fuel (shall be purified) in the same manner.</p>  
 <p>24. Large pieces of wood (must be) washed and dried.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. But a great quantity (of wood shall be) sprinkled (with water).</p>  
 <p>26. Wooden vessels which have been touched by impure men (shall be) scraped;</p>  
 <p>27. (And) those which are defiled by stains of remnants (shall be) planed. <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. (Wooden vessels) defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like (very impure substances shall be) thrown away. <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. These (rules must be followed) except in case a (special) injunction (is given);</p>  
 <p>30. Thus, for instance, (purification by) washing with Ku<i>s</i>a grass and water (is prescribed) on all the following (occasions, viz.) at the Agnihotra, the Gharmo<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ish<i>t</i>a, the Dadhigharma, the Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>apâyinâm Ayana, the Utsargi<i>n</i>âm Ayana, the Dâkshâya<i>n</i>a sacrifice, the Ardhodaya, the <i>K</i>atu<i>s</i><i>k</i>akra, and the Brahmaudanas, <a name="fr_947"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. (Again) at all Soma-sacrifices (the cups must be) cleaned with water only on (the heap of earth called) the Mâr<i>g</i>âliya;</p>  
 <p>32. If these same (cups are defiled) by urine, ordure, <a name="fr_948"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">32</font></a></p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_932"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_932">186:1</a>-2. <b>13</b>. See also above, I, 5, 10, 4. This Adhyâya and the next ought to have been given in the <i>S</i>rauta Sûtra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_933"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_933">186:3</a> Rig-veda VII, 56, 12; Taittirîya-brâhma<i>n</i>a II, 8, 5, 5. The meaning of the last portion of the verse is somewhat doubtful. Sâya<i>n</i>a gives two different explanations and Govinda a third.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_934"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_934">186:4</a> Govinda points out that the dresses of the sacrificer and of his priests must be white, because farther on (Sûtras 9-10) other colours are specially prescribed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_935"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_935">186:5</a> Govinda thinks that the word <i>k</i>a, 'as well as,' is intended to include the lookers-on.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_936"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_936">187:6</a> Regarding the ceremony called Prakrama, literally 'stepping forward from the Gârhapatya fire,' see Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. Br. I, 1, 4, 1. It opens the Agnyâdhâna rite.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_937"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_937">187:9</a> Govinda states that the words iti ka, and so forth,' are intended to include other incantations. The V<i>ri</i>shâkapi hymn is found Rig-veda X, 86.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_938"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_938">187:11</a> Govinda states that the word iti, 'and the like,' is intended to include cowdung, cow's urine, and other substances used for purification.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_939"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_939">187:12</a> Govinda states that there is a tree called T<i>ri</i>pa, the bark of which is used for dresses. V<i>ri</i>kala, which has been left untranslated, is explained by <i>s</i>akama, a word which is not found in our dictionaries.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_940"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_940">188:13</a> Govinda says that, as the treatment of valkala, bark-dresses,' has not been prescribed, the meaning of the Sûtra can only be, that bark-dresses and black-buck skins are to be treated alike, i.e. that they are to be cleaned with Bel-nut and rice; see above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_941"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_941">188:15</a> Govinda explains apalpûlitam by 'without beating it with the hand on a stone.' He mentions as an instance the skin which is used in preparing the Soma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_942"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_942">188:16</a> According to Govinda, solid earth is such on which the fire-altars are built.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_943"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_943">188:21</a> E.g. grass intended for the barhis, if it has been placed on a spot which has not been sprinkled with water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_944"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_944">188:22</a> 'Defiled out of one's sight,' i.e. brought by <i>S</i>ûdras.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_945"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_945">189:27</a> Govinda says that this rule is optional.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_946"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_946">189:28</a> Govinda adds that fuel, Ku<i>s</i>a grass, and the like, which have been defiled in this manner, must also be thrown away.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_947"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_947">189:30</a> Regarding the Dadhigharma, a homa, see Vaitâna Sûtra 21,18; regarding the Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>apâyinâm Ayana, Â<i>s</i>valâyana <i>S</i>rauta Sûtra XII, 4; and regarding the Dâkshâya<i>n</i>a sacrifice, a variety of the new and full-moon offering, Â<i>s</i>valâyana II, 14. The Ardhodaya is possibly the vrata of that name mentioned in the Purâ<i>n</i>as, According to Govinda, the <i>K</i>atu<i>s</i><i>k</i>akra, which is otherwise known as a Tântric rite, is a sacrifice, ish<i>t</i>akâkosh<i>t</i>a (?) madhyavasanto ya<i>g</i>ante tathetaradaya<i>h</i> (?). Regarding the Brahmaudana, see Â<i>s</i>valâyana <i>S</i>rauta Sûtra I, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_948"></a><a href="sbe1446.htm#fr_948">189:32</a> Govinda says that the injunction to throw away defiled <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a> vessels has been repeated, in order to prevent a misconception. For as Soma is said to be a great means of purification, it might be supposed that it was powerful enough to prevent the defilement of vessels into which it is poured at a sacrifice. But compare the next Sûtras.</p>
