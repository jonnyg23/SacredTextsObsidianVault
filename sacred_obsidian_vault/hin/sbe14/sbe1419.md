   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XVI.</h3>  
 <p>1. Now (follow the rules regarding) legal proceedings.</p>  
 <p>2. Let the king (or) his minister transact the business on the bench. <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. When two (parties) have a dispute, let him not be partial to one of them. <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. Let him reason properly regarding an offence; finally the offence (will become evident thereby). <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. He who properly reasons regarding an offence, in accordance with the sum of the science of the first two castes, is equitable towards all created beings. <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. And let him protect what has been gained; <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. (Likewise) the property of infants (of the) royal (race). <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. (Likewise the property) of persons unfit to transact legal business (minors, widows, and so forth). <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. But if (a minor) comes of age, his property must be made over to him.</p>  
 <p>10. 'It is declared in the Sm<i>ri</i>ti that there are three kinds of proof which give a title to (property, viz.) documents, witnesses, and possession; (thereby) an owner may recover property which formerly belonged to him (but was lost).' <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. From fields through which (there is a right of) road (a space sufficient for the road) must be set apart, likewise a space for turning (a cart). <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Near new-built houses (and) other things (of the same description there shall be) a passage three feet broad. <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. In a dispute about a house or a field, reliance (may be placed on the depositions of) neighbours. <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. If the statements of the neighbours disagree, documents (may be taken as) proof.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. If conflicting documents are produced, reliance (may be placed) on (the statements of) aged (inhabitants) of the village or town, and on (those of) guilds and corporations (of artisans or traders). <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Property inherited from a father, a thing bought, a pledge, property given to a wife after marriage by her husband's family, a gift, property obtained for performing a sacrifice, the property of reunited coparceners, and wages as the eighth.' <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Whatever belonging to these (eight kinds of property) has been enjoyed (by another person) for ten years continuously (is lost to the owner). <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. They quote also (a verse) on the other side: 'A pledge, a boundary, and the property of minor's, an (open) deposit, a sealed deposit, women, the property of a king, (and) the wealth of a <i>S</i>rotriya are not lost by being enjoyed (by others).' <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. Property entirely given up (by its owner) goes to the king. <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. If it be otherwise, the king with his ministers and the citizens shall administer it. <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. A king will be superior even to Brahman if he lives surrounded by servants (who are keen-eyed) like vultures.</p>  
 <p>22. But a king will not be exalted if he lives surrounded by servants (who are greedy) like vultures.</p>  
 <p>23. Let him live surrounded by servants (who are keen-eyed) like vultures, let him not be a vulture surrounded by vultures.</p>  
 <p>24. For through his servants blemishes become manifest (in his kingdom),</p>  
 <p>25. (Such as) theft, robbery, oppression, and (so forth).</p>  
 <p>26. Therefore let him question his servants before-hand.</p>  
 <p>27. Now (follow the rules regarding) witnesses:</p>  
 <p>28. <i>S</i>rotriyas, men of unblemished form, of good character, men who are holy and love truth (are fit to be) witnesses, <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. Or (men of) any (caste may give evidence) regarding (men of) any (other caste). <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. Let him make women witnesses regarding women; for twice-born men twice-born men of the same caste (shall be witnesses), and good <i>S</i>ûdras for <i>S</i>ûdras, and men of low birth for low-caste men. <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_480"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'A son need not pay money due by a surety, any-thing idly promised, money due for losses at play or for spirituous liquor, nor what remains unpaid of a fine or a toll.' <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. 'Depose, O witness, according to the truth; expecting thy answer, thy ancestors hang in suspense;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> (in accordance with its truth or falsehood) they will rise (to heaven) or fall (into hell).'</p>  
 <p>33. 'Naked and shorn, tormented with hunger and thirst, and deprived of sight shall the man who gives false evidence go with a potsherd to beg food at the door of his enemy.' <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. 'He kills five by false testimony regarding a maiden; he kills ten by false testimony regarding kine; he kills a hundred by false evidence regarding a horse, and a thousand by false evidence regarding a man.' <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">34</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. (Men) may speak an untruth at the time of marriage, during dalliance, when their lives are in danger or the loss of their whole property is imminent, and for the sake of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a; they declare that an untruth spoken in these five cases does not make (the speaker) an outcast. <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">35</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. Those who give partial evidence in a judicial proceeding for the sake of a relative or for money, deprive the ancestors of their spiritual family and those of their natural family of their place in heaven. <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_461"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_461">78:2</a> <b>XVI</b>. Vish<i>n</i>u III, 72-73. K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita gives a second explanation of the Sûtra, which also appears admissible, 'Let the king transact the business on the bench, taking counsel (with learned Brâhma<i>n</i>as as assessors);' see Vish<i>n</i>u III, 72.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_462"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_462">78:3</a> Translated as above the Sûtra is nearly equivalent to Gautama <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a> XI, 5. But the phrase 'when two parties have a dispute' may also indicate, as K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita suggests, that the king or judge shall not promote litigation, see Gautama XIII, 27. As K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita states, the Sûtra may, however, mean also, 'when one case is being argued, let him not begin another (without finishing the first);' see Manu VIII, 43. Owing to the particular nature of the Sûtra style and the inclination of the Brâhmanical mind to double-entendres, I do not think it improbable that the author may have intended, both in this and in the preceding Sûtras, that his words should be interpreted in two ways.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_463"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_463">79:4</a> Gautama XI, 23-24. I divide the words of the text, as follows, 'yathâsanam (i.e. yathâ-âsanam) aparâdhohî; antena aparâdha<i>h</i>,' and interpolate syât at the end of the first clause.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_464"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_464">79:5</a> K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita wrongly divides this Sûtra into two, and wrongly adopts the reading of MSS. B. and E., consequently he obtains a sense only by the most astonishing tricks of interpretation. I read with MSS. Bh. and F., yathâsanam aparâdhohyâdyavar<i>n</i>ayor vidyântata<i>h</i>, to which the reading of I. O. 913 âdyavar<i>n</i>ayor vidhânata<i>h</i> points also. The meaning of the expression, 'according to the sum of the science of the first two castes,' I take to be according to the rules of sacred learning and of the mîmâ<i>m</i>sâ, which is peculiar to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and of logic (ânvîkshikî) and polity (da<i>n</i><i>d</i>anîti), which are peculiar to or at least recommended to the particular attention of the Kshatriyas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_465"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_465">79:6</a> I read with MSS. Bh. and F., sa<i>m</i>panna<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a rakshayet. I consider this Sûtra to contain an admonition addressed to the king for himself; see Manu VII, 99. K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita and B. read sapattra<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a rakshayet, 'Let him protect that which is attested by writings,' i, e. the donations of former kings, attested by writings; see Vish<i>n</i>u III, 83.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_466"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_466">79:7</a> K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita thinks that the rule refers to the property of <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a> the infant children of a hostile king who has been conquered and slain. It is, however, not improbable that it has a wider sense, and exhorts the king to look after the property of the children of his predecessor and of deceased feudal barons.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_469"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_469">80:11</a> K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita quotes in illustration of this Sûtra the following passage of <i>S</i>aṅkha and Likhita: 'In a field through which (there is a right of) road, (space) for the road must be set apart, and on the king's high-road a space sufficient for turning a chariot.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_470"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_470">80:12</a> Arthântareshu, 'near other things (of the same description),' means, according to K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita, 'near pleasure-gardens and the like: No doubt, buildings of all kinds, fenced or walled gardens, and so forth are meant. I read tripâdamâtram.</p>

K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita's explanation is opposed to all rules of interpretation, and not worth giving.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_485"></a><a href="sbe1419.htm#fr_485">83:36</a> This verse, too, is corrupt, though the general sense is not doubtful.
