 <p>1. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a who always carries water (in his pot), who always wears the sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of <i>S</i>ûdras, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers sacrifices in accordance with the rules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from Brahman's heaven. <a name="fr_1107"></a><a href="#fn_1107"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. The Veda (says), 'Manu divided his estate among his sons.' <a name="fr_1108"></a><a href="#fn_1108"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. (A father may, therefore, divide his property) equally among all, without (making any) difference; <a name="fr_1109"></a><a href="#fn_1109"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. Or the eldest may receive the most excellent chattel. <a name="fr_1110"></a><a href="#fn_1110"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. (For) the Veda says, 'Therefore, they distinguish the eldest by (an additional share of the) property. <a name="fr_1111"></a><a href="#fn_1111"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. Or the eldest may receive (in excess) one part out of ten; <a name="fr_1112"></a><a href="#fn_1112"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. (And) the other (sons) shall receive equal shares. <a name="fr_1113"></a><a href="#fn_1113"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. While the father lives, the division of the estate takes place (only) with the permission of the father. <a name="fr_1114"></a><a href="#fn_1114"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. The (additional) share of the eldest is, (according to the order) of the four castes, a cow, a horse, a goat, and a sheep. <a name="fr_1115"></a><a href="#fn_1115"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. If there are sons born of wives of different castes (var<i>n</i>a), they should make ten portions of the ancestral property and take four (shares), three, two, (and) one, according to the order (of the castes). <a name="fr_1116"></a><a href="#fn_1116"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. But if a legitimate son of the body (aurasa) is born, the (other) sons of equal caste shall obtain one third share (of the estate). <a name="fr_1117"></a><a href="#fn_1117"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. If there is a son of equal caste and a son of <a name="fr_1118"></a><a href="#fn_1118"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>a wife of the next lower caste, the son born of the wife of the next lower caste may take the share of the eldest, provided he be endowed with good qualities.</p>  
 <p>13. (A son) who possesses good qualities becomes the protector of the rest. <a name="fr_1119"></a><a href="#fn_1119"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. One must know a son begotten by (the husband) himself on a wedded wife of equal caste (to be) a legitimate son of the body (aurasa). <a name="fr_1120"></a><a href="#fn_1120"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now they quote also (the following verse): 'From the several limbs (of my body) art thou produced, from my heart art thou born; thou art "self" called a son; mayest thou live a hundred autumns.' <a name="fr_1121"></a><a href="#fn_1121"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. The (male child) born of a daughter, after an agreement has been made, (one must know to be) the son of an appointed daughter (putrikâputra); any other (male offspring of a daughter they call) a daughter's son (dauhitra).</p>  
 <p>16. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The son of an appointed daughter should offer the first funeral cake to his mother, the second to her father, and the third to his father's father.'</p>  
 <p>17. He who is begotten, by another man, on the wife of a deceased man, of a eunuch, or of one (incurably) diseased, after permission (has been given), is called the son begotten on a wife (kshetra<i>g</i>a). <a name="fr_1122"></a><a href="#fn_1122"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. Such a (son begotten on a wife) has two fathers and belongs to two families; he has a right to perform the funeral oblations, and to inherit the property of (his) two (fathers). <a name="fr_1123"></a><a href="#fn_1123"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. Now they quote also (the following verse): The son of two fathers shall give the funeral cakes (to his two fathers, and pronounce) two names with each oblation, and three cakes shall serve for six persons; he who acts thus will not err.'</p>  
 <p>20. He (is called) an adopted son (datta) who, being given by his father and his mother, or by either of the two, is received in the place of a child. <a name="fr_1124"></a><a href="#fn_1124"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. He (is called) a son made (k<i>ri</i>trima) whom (a mail) himself makes (his son), with the (adoptee's) consent (only), and who belongs to the same caste (as the adopter). <a name="fr_1125"></a><a href="#fn_1125"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. He is called a son born secretly (gû<i>dh</i>agga) who is secretly born in the house and whose (origin is) afterwards (only) recognised. <a name="fr_1126"></a><a href="#fn_1126"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. He is called a son cast off (apaviddha) who, being, cast off by his father and his mother, or by either (of them), is received in the place of a child. <a name="fr_1127"></a><a href="#fn_1127"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. If anybody approaches an unmarried girl without the permission (of her father or guardian), the son born by such (a woman is called) the son of an unmarried damsel (kânîna). <a name="fr_1128"></a><a href="#fn_1128"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>

 <p>25. If one marries either knowingly or unknowingly a pregnant bride, the child which is born of her is called (a son) taken with the bride (saho<i>dh</i>a). <a name="fr_1129"></a><a href="#fn_1129"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. He (is called a son) bought (krîta) who, being purchased from his father and his mother, or from either of them, is received in the place of a child. <a name="fr_1130"></a><a href="#fn_1130"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. He (is called the son) of a twice-married woman (paunarbhava) who is born of a re-married female, (i.e.) of one who, having left an impotent man, has taken a second husband. <a name="fr_1131"></a><a href="#fn_1131"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. He (is called) a self-given (son, svaya<i>m</i>datta) who, abandoned by his father and his mother, gives himself (to a stranger). <a name="fr_1132"></a><a href="#fn_1132"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. He who is begotten by (a man of) the first twice-born (caste) on a female of the <i>S</i>ûdra caste (is called) a Nishâda.</p>  
 <p>30. (He who was begotten by the same parents) through lust (is called) a Pâra<i>s</i>ava. Thus (the various kinds of) sons (have been enumerated). <a name="fr_1133"></a><a href="#fn_1133"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'They declare the legitimate son, the son of an appointed daughter, the son begotten on a wife, the adopted son and the son made, the son born secretly and the son cast off, (to be entitled) to share the inheritance.' <a name="fr_1134"></a><a href="#fn_1134"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. 'They declare the son of an unmarried damsel and the son received with the bride, the son bought, <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1135"><font size="1">32</font></a></p>

 <p>likewise the son of a twice-married female, the son self-given and the Nishâda, to be members of the family.'</p>  
 <p>33. Aupa<i>g</i>andhani (declares that) the first among them alone (is entitled to inherit, and a member of his father's family). <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1136"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. 'Now, O <i>G</i>anaka, I jealously watch my wives, (though I did) not (do it) formerly; for they have declared in Yama's court that the son belongs to the begetter. The giver of the seed carries off the son, after death, in Yama's hall, Therefore they carefully protect their wives, fearing the seed of strangers.'</p>  
 <p>35. 'Carefully watch (the procreation of your) offspring, lest strange seed fall on your soil. After death the son belongs to the begetter; through carelessness a husband makes (the procreation of) a son useless.'</p>  
 <p>36. Let them carefully protect the shares of <a name="fr_1137"></a><a href="#fn_1137"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>

 <p>40. But not the outcast nor his offspring. <a name="fr_1141"></a><a href="#fn_1141"><font size="1">40</font></a></p>

 <p>43. The daughters shall obtain the ornaments of their mother, (as many as are) presented according to the custom (of the caste), or anything else (that may be given according to custom). <a name="fr_1142"></a><a href="#fn_1142"><font size="1">43</font></a></p>

 <p>44. Women do not possess independence. <a name="fr_1143"></a><a href="#fn_1143"><font size="1">44</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. Now they quote also (the following verse): Their father protects (them) in childhood, their husband protects (them) in youth, and their sons protect (them) in old age a woman is never fit for independence.' <a name="fr_1144"></a><a href="#fn_1144"><font size="1">45</font></a></p>  
 <p>46. The Veda declares, 'Therefore women are considered to be destitute of strength and of a portion.' <a name="fr_1145"></a><a href="#fn_1145"><font size="1">46</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_1136"></a><a href="sbe1457.htm#fr_1136">229:33</a>-34. Aupa<i>g</i>andhani is one of the ancient teachers of the White Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, mentioned in the lists incorporated in the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a XIV, 5, 5, 21; 7, 3, 26. The legends of the White Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda frequently mention king <i>G</i>anaka of Videha, and assert that that philosopher king had frequent and intimate intercourse with Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya and other teachers of the Veda which Âditya revealed. It seems to me, therefore, highly probable that Govinda is right in taking the vocative <i>g</i>anaka in Sûtra 34 as a proper name, and in asserting that the verse belongs to a conversation between Aupa<i>g</i>andhani and <i>G</i>anaka. This explanation, which possibly may be based on an ancient tradition of Baudhâyana's school, is certainly preferable to Haradatta's statement on Âpastamba II, 6, 13, 7, that these verses express the sentiments of a husband who had neglected to watch his wives, and later learned that he would not derive any spiritual benefit from their offspring. In the text of Sûtra 34 I read with the Dekhan MSS. and Âpastamba, loc. cit., îrshyâmi, instead of ishyâmi, which M. and the commentary give.</p>

Govinda asserts that the Sûtra is intended to forbid the independent action of women with respect to things inherited. The correct view probably is that with this Sûtra the topic of the duties and rights of women begins, and that the rule contains a general maxim.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1145"></a><a href="sbe1457.htm#fr_1145">231:46</a> Colebrooke V, Dig. CXXXI. The text is in great confusion. The Dekhan and Gu<i>g</i>arât MSS., except K., read, na dâya<i>m</i> nirindriyâ hyadâyâ<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a striyo matâ iti sruti<i>h</i>; K. has, tasmât[n]nirindriyâ hy. st. m. i. <i>s</i>ru. || tasmât striyo nirindriyâ adâyâdîr api pâpât; while M. and the I. O. copy of the commentary have, tasmânnirindriyâ adâyâ<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a striyo matâ iti <i>s</i>ruti<i>h</i> [sûti<i>h</i>, M.] The Telugu copy is mutilated, and reads nâdayantiriti sruti<i>h</i>. Though the reading of the Dekhan MSS. is supported by Mitrami<i>s</i>ra Vîramitrodaya, fol. 209, p. I, 1. 3, it is certainly not the original one, for there is no verb by which the accusative 'dâyam' is governed. Mitrami<i>s</i>ra's attempt to make it depend on 'arhati' in the verse quoted in Sûtra 45 is futile, because, according to the usage of the Sûtrakâras, a Sûtra may be completed by a verb taken frost another original aphorism of the author, but cannot be connecter with a portion of a quotation taken from some other work. This same principle, of course, applies not only to Sûtras, but to the writings of all other authors, whether Indian or European. The reading of K., M., and of the I. O. copy of the commentary is not open to the objection just mentioned, and therefore preferable. But it seems to me highly probable that, nevertheless, it is not <a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a> quite genuine; for the word 'tasmât,' with which it begins, is not required, because its sense is already expressed by the following hi,' and because the Sûtra apparently contains half an Anush<i>t</i>ubh <i>S</i>loka, which the insertion of tasmât destroys. It is also easy to see how it came to be inserted. Every Ya<i>g</i>urvedî who read the passage would be reminded of the analogous passage of the Taittirîya Sa<i>m</i>hitâ VI, 5, 8, 2, 'tasmât striyo nirindriyâ adâyâdîr api pâpât pu<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> upastitaram,' which in K. has actually been inserted after our Sûtra. In the Vedic Mantra 'tasmât' is required, and is certainly the genuine reading. Hence it seems to have been transferred into Baudhâyana's text, possibly by the mistake of some scribe who, according to the habit of his kind, took a marginal reference to the beginning of the Vedic passage for a correction of the text. In my opinion it must be thrown out. The sense of the half verse remains exactly the same. It corresponds to Manu IX, 18. According to Govindasvâmin and others its object is to show that women are incapable of inheriting, and the word dâya, 'portion,' must be taken in the sense of 'a share of the inheritance.' For a full discussion of this point, I refer to the Introductory Note on Book I, Chapter II, Sect. 14 of West and Miller's Digest of H. L. C., third edition.</p>
