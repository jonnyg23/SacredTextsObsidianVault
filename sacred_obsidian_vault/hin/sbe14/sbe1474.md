   <h3 align="center">PRA<i>S</i>NA III, ADHYÂYA 2.</h3>  
 <p>1. As regards (the mode of subsistence called) Sha<i>n</i><i>n</i>ivartanî, (that) is (as follows):</p>  
 <p><a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. He cultivates six Nivartanas (of) fallow (land); he gives a share to the owner (of the soil), or solicits his permission (to keep the whole produce). <a name="fr_1340"></a><a href="#fn_1340"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. Let him plough before breakfast with two bulls whose noses have not been pierced, not striking (them) with the goad, (but) frequently coaxing (them). <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1341"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. If he cultivates six Nivartanas in this manner (and subsists thereby), that is (the mode of living called) Sha<i>n</i><i>n</i>ivartanî (subsistence on six Nivartanas).</p>  
 <p>5. (As regards the mode of subsistence called) Kauddâlî, he digs up (the soil) near a water(-course or tank) with a spade, a ploughshare, or a pointed piece of wood, sows seed, (and) grows bulbs, roots, fruit, pot-herbs, and vegetables.</p>  
 <p>6. (If he thus) cultivates (land) with a spade (and lives on its produce), that is the (mode of life called) Kauddâlî (subsistence by the spade). <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1342"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. He who lives by the (mode of subsistence called) Dhruvâ, wraps up his head in a white dress (saying), 'For the sake of welfare I wrap thee up, O head,' (and) takes the skin of a black antelope (with the words), '(Thou art) spiritual pre-eminence, (I take thee) for the sake of spiritual pre-eminence;' the Pavitra (reciting) the Abliṅga texts; the water-pot (saying), 'Thou art strength, (I take) thee for <a name="fr_1343"></a><a href="#fn_1343"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p>the sake of strength;' the yoke for carrying burdens (saying), 'Thou art grain, (I take) thee for the sake of prosperity;' the staff (saying), '(Thou art) a friend, protect me.'</p>  
 <p>8. On leaving (his hut), he mutters the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, and (afterwards the verse used for) hallowing the quarters of the horizon, 'May the earth, the middle sphere, the sky, the constellations, and all the quarters of the horizon, fire, air, and sun, (may all these) deities protect me on my road.'</p>  
 <p>9. Because, after muttering the Mânastokîya (text) and entering the village, he shows himself with the yoke (on his shoulder) at the door of each house, they call it 'showing oneself.'</p>  
 <p>10. Because, if every (other) livelihood fails, he persistently (dhruvam) supports himself by this (mode of living), it is called Dhruvâ (the unchangeable). <a name="fr_1344"></a><a href="#fn_1344"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. (As regards the mode of life called) Samprakshâlanî, (if, in order to show that) there is no waste of the vegetable (substances) obtained nor <a name="fr_1345"></a><a href="#fn_1345"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a></p>  
 <p>any hoarding, he turns the dishes, after washing them, upside down, (that is the livelihood called) Samprakshâlanî (living by washing).</p>  
 <p>12. As to the (mode of subsistence called) Samûhâ, (if) he sweeps up (grain) with a broom in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants are found, either on a road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed (by hedges), and lives on (what he has thus obtained), that (livelihood is called) Samûhâ (living by sweeping).</p>  
 <p>13. As to the (mode of life called) Pâlanî, it is also named Ahi<i>m</i>sakâ (not hurting), and the following (definition) is given. (If) he tries to obtain from virtuous men husked rice or seeds, and maintains (himself) thereby, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Pâlanî. <a name="fr_1346"></a><a href="#fn_1346"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. As to the (mode of life called) Silo<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>â, (if) he gleans single ears in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants grow, on a road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed, and supports himself by (these) gleanings, (collected) from time</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a></p>  
 <p>to time, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Silo<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>â (gleaning).</p>  
 <p>15. As to the (livelihood called) Kapotâ, (if) he picks up with two fingers single grains in permitted places, where (grain-bearing) plants grow, either on the road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed, that (is called), because he acts like a pigeon, Kapotâ (pigeon-life). <a name="fr_1347"></a><a href="#fn_1347"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. As to (the mode of life called) Siddho<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>â, (if) tired with the (other) ways of subsistence, he asks, because he has become old or diseased, virtuous men for cooked food, that (is the livelihood called) Siddho<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>â (gleaning cooked food). <a name="fr_1348"></a><a href="#fn_1348"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. If (he adopts) the latter, he must reposit (the sacred fires) in his soul and behave like an ascetic, except (in using) the cloth for straining water and (wearing) a reddish-brown dress.</p>  
 <p>18. If he subsists on the produce of the forest, (the fruits) of trees, creepers. and lianas, and of grasses, such as wild millet (<i>s</i>yâmâka) and wild sesamum, that (is called) forest-life.</p>  
 <p>19. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Moving about with the beasts, dwelling together with them, and maintaining oneself in a manner similar to theirs, that is clearly the road to heaven.'</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1340"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1340">288:2</a> <b>2</b>. A Nivartana is a measure of 4000 square hastas, the ancient equivalent of the modern Bîghâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1341"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1341">288:3</a> Identical with II, 2, 4, 21.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1342"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1342">288:6</a> Govinda says that according to some the following ceremonies need only be performed when one goes out begging for the first time, while others insist on their being performed daily.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1343"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1343">288:7</a> The Mânastokîya, i.e. the text beginning 'mâ nas toke,' <a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 289</font></a> occurs repeatedly in the Taittirîya-veda, e.g. Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ III, 4, 11, 2. Govinda adds that the beggar must remain silent, and rot stop longer at each door than the time required for milking a cow.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1344"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1344">289:10</a> Both the text and the scanty commentary on this Sûtra are corrupt. K. reads, v<i>ri</i>tter v<i>ri</i>ttair avârtâyâ<i>m</i> tayaiva tasya dhruva<i>m</i> varttayatîti dhruveti parikîrtitâ; D. v<i>ri</i>tte v<i>ri</i>ttair avârttâthâ, &amp;c.; M. v<i>ri</i>tte v<i>ri</i>tter av<i>ri</i>ttâyâm av<i>ri</i>ttâyâ<i>m</i> tathaiva tasyâ<i>h</i> ddh<i>ri</i>va<i>m</i> varttamânâd iti, &amp;c.; C. I. v<i>ri</i>tter v<i>ri</i>tter âvartâyâm âvartâyâm tathaiva tasyâ<i>m</i> dhruva<i>m</i> vartanâd iti, &amp;c. The Telugu copy omits the text. From the commentary it is clear that Govinda read at the beginning of the Sûtra v<i>ri</i>tter v<i>ri</i>tter,' and the Telugu copy proves that 'tayaiva' is the correct reading. I restore the Sûtra conjecturally; as follows, v<i>ri</i>tter v<i>ri</i>tter avârttâyâ<i>m</i> tayaiva tasya dhruva<i>m</i> vartanâd it dhruveti parikîrtitâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1345"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1345">289:11</a> 1 read, samprakshâlanîti | utpannânâm oshadhînâm prakshepa<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a> nâstîti ni<i>k</i>ayo vâ bhâ<i>g</i>anâni sa<i>m</i>prakshâlya nyub<i>g</i>ayatîti samprakshâlanî || M. has nâsti ni<i>k</i>ayo vâ, and C. I. reads also ni<i>k</i>ayo and omits 'vâ' The Dekhan MSS. have nâstîti <i>k</i>ayo vâ. The description is not very clear; but it seems that a person who lives by the Samprakshâlanî v<i>ri</i>tti must obtain grain and vegetables by begging in such quantities as will suffice for one meal, and prove by the way in which he treats his dishes that he has neither wasted his food nor any store remaining.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1346"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1346">290:13</a> The translation of this Satin is merely tentative, as the two MSS. of the commentary omit the text, and contain only a fragment of Govinda's explanation. The latter seems to have differed from my interpretation. The text, as given by the other MSS., runs as follows: pâlanîty [pâli°, MSS.] ahi<i>m</i>sakety evedam uktam bhavati [°tîti, M.] tushavihînâ<i>m</i>s ta<i>n</i><i>d</i>ulân i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ati sa<i>g</i><i>g</i>anebhyo bîgâni vâ [<i>k</i>â, D.] pâlayatîti pâlanî [phâla°, phâlani, M.; pâlinô, K. D.]</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1347"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1347">291:15</a> Govinda mentions a varia lectio not found in our MSS., kapotavatsa<i>m</i>da<i>m</i><i>s</i>inî, 'because he pecks like a pigeon.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1348"></a><a href="sbe1474.htm#fr_1348">291:16</a> Here as well as above, III, 1, 7, the Dekhan MSS. read siddhe<i>k</i><i>kh</i>â,' begging cooked food,' instead of", siddho<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>â.</p>
