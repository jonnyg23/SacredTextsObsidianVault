   <h3 align="center">PRA<i>S</i>NA III, ADHYÂYA 1.</h3>  
 <p>Now, therefore, (we will speak) of those who desire (to fulfil) the duties of Sâlînas (dwellers in houses), Yâyâvaras (wanderers), and <i>K</i>akra<i>k</i>aras (circle-goers), who subsist by nine (different) means of livelihood.</p>  
 <p>2. The term livelihood' (v<i>ri</i>tti) is used because they subsist thereby (tadvartanât).</p>  
 <p>3. The word Sâlîna (is used) because they dwell in houses (<i>s</i>âlâ).</p>  
 <p>4. To be a Yâyâvara (means that one) goes on by means of a most excellent livelihood (v<i>ri</i>ttyâ varayâ yâti).</p>  
 <p>5. The term <i>K</i>akra<i>k</i>ara is derived from going by turns (to the houses of rich men). <a name="fr_1329"></a><a href="#fn_1329"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. We will explain those (above-mentioned means of livelihood) in their proper order.</p>  
 <p>7. They are nine, (viz.) Sha<i>n</i><i>n</i>ivartanî, Kauddâli, Dhruvâ, Samprakshâlanî, Samûhâ, Pâlanî, Silo<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>â, Kapotâ, and Siddho<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>â. <a name="fr_1330"></a><a href="#fn_1330"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p>8. (In addition) to these there is a tenth way of living, viz. forest-life.</p>  
 <p>9. (If he desires to adopt) any of the nine ways of living,</p>  
 <p>10. He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails to be cut, and besides gets ready (the following objects),</p>  
 <p>11. (Viz.) the skin of a black antelope, a water-pot, a staff, a yoke for carrying burdens, (and) a sickle. <a name="fr_1331"></a><a href="#fn_1331"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. He desires to go forth, after having offered a Traidhâtavîya (offering) or a Vai<i>s</i>vânarî (ish<i>t</i>i). <a name="fr_1332"></a><a href="#fn_1332"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. Now on the (following) morning, after the sun has risen, he makes the sacred fires burn brightly, melts butter on the Gârhapatya fire, cleanses it (with Ku<i>s</i>a grass), heats the (spoons called) Sru<i>k</i> and Sruva, cleans (them), takes out four (spoonfuls of butter) in the Sru<i>k</i>, and offers the Vâstoshpatîya (oblation) in the Âhavanîya fire according to (the rules of his) Sûtra. <a name="fr_1333"></a><a href="#fn_1333"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Having recited the Puronuvâkyâ (verse), 'O lord of the dwelling, permit us,' &amp;c., he offers (the oblation) with the Yâ<i>g</i>yâ verse, 'O lord of the dwelling, with thy kind company,' &amp;c. <a name="fr_1334"></a><a href="#fn_1334"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. Some (declare that) every person who has kindled the sacred fires (shall offer these Homas).</p>  
 <p>16. Others (say that) a Yâyâvara alone (shall do it).</p>  
 <p>17. After departing (from his house), he stops at the extremity of the village, or at the extremity of the boundary of the village, builds there a hut or a cottage, and enters that. <a name="fr_1335"></a><a href="#fn_1335"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. Let him use the skin of the black antelope and the other (objects) which he has prepared for the several purposes which they are intended to serve.</p>  
 <p>19. Known (is) the (duty of) serving the fires; known (is) the (duty of) offering the new and full moon sacrifices; known (is) the successive performance of the five Mahâya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as; it is seen that the vegetables, which have been produced, are offered. <a name="fr_1336"></a><a href="#fn_1336"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. He hallows those (vegetables), either (reciting the text),' I offer what is agreeable to all the gods,' or silently, and cooks (them). <a name="fr_1337"></a><a href="#fn_1337"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. For such (a man the duty of) teaching, sacrificing for others, accepting gifts, and (performing) other sacrifices (than those mentioned) ceases. <a name="fr_1338"></a><a href="#fn_1338"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. (The use of) sacrificial food fit to be eaten during the performance of a vow is seen;</p>  
 <p>23. That is as follows: (his food may be) mixed with clarified butter or sour milk, (it must) not (contain) pungent condiments or salt, nor meat, nor (be) stale.</p>  
 <p>24: (He shall remain) chaste, or approach (his wife) in season.</p>  
 <p>25. (It is necessary) to have the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails cut on each Parva day, and the rules of purification (are obligatory on him).</p>  
 <p>26. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two kinds of purification, which the <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>as reverentially practise, are mentioned in the Veda,--external (purification), which consists in the removal of impure stains and foul smells, and internal (purification), which consists in the abstention from injuring live creatures.'</p>  
 <p>27. 'The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the soul of beings by abstention from injuring, (and) the internal organ by truth.' <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1339"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1329"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1329">284:5</a> <b>1</b>. Govinda says that <i>K</i>akra<i>k</i>ara is another name for Yâyâvara, and that anukrama<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a, 'going by turns,' means going successively to the houses of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<i>s</i>yas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1330"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1330">284:7</a> The terms left untranslated are fully explained in the next <a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a> chapter. All the MSS. read kauntâlî for kauddâlî, which occurs in the commentary alone.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1331"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1331">285:11</a> The vîvadha, 'a yoke for carrying burdens,' consists usually of a bamboo pole, to the ends of which two ropes are attached for fastening the loads. Kuthahârî, 'a sickle,' seems to be the name of a particular kind of sickle, since Govinda explains it by vâsavasâsanadâtram. He adds that the term includes 'a spade' (kuddâla) and other implements.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1332"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1332">285:12</a> The meaning is that on the evening before his departure from the old home he is to offer the Traidhâtavîya-homa. According to the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtras (see the Petersb. Dict. s. v. traidhâtavî) the latter offering always occurs at the end of a great sacrifice. Hence it is appropriate for a person who wishes to begin a new mode of life.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1333"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1333">285:13</a> This is the leave-taking from the old dwelling.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1334"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1334">286:14</a> The two verses occur Taittirîya Sa<i>m</i>hitâ III, 4, 10, I. It is specially mentioned by Sâya<i>n</i>a that the two verses have to be recited by an Agnihotrin on departing from his home.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1335"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1335">286:17</a> Ma<i>th</i>a, 'a cottage,' is, according to Govinda, a house resting on many posts or pillars, while ku<i>t</i>î is the simple shed with four posts and a roof of leaves.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1336"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1336">286:19</a> The last clause, probably, is meant to prescribe a simpler form of the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1337"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1337">286:20</a> Govinda adds that the meaning is that the sacrificer shall eat the boiled rice in silence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1338"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1338">287:21</a> Govinda adds that the obligation of performing other meritorious deeds, such as digging wells and tanks (pûrta), also ceases.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1339"></a><a href="sbe1473.htm#fr_1339">287:27</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a III, 60.</p>
