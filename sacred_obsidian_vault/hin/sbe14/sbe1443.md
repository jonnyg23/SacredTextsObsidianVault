 <p>1. 'A drop of water which is allowed to fall (on the ground) purifies a bull's hide of land, whether (the land) has been (previously) swept or not, provided no impure substance is visible on it.' <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Food which is cooked out of sight must be illuminated (with fire) and be sprinkled with water, <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. Likewise eatables bought in the market. <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>enjoy the offerings made by a man destitute of faith.'</p>  
 <p>5. After reflecting (for a, long time on the respective value of) the (food) of a pure man destitute of faith and of an impure person who has faith, the gods declared both to be equal. But the Lord of created beings said to them, 'That is not equal, it is unequal. The food of a man destitute of faith is worthless, that which is purified by faith is preferable.'</p>  
 <p>6. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Want of faith is the greatest sin; for faith is the highest austerity. Therefore the gods do not eat offerings given without faith.'</p>  
 <p>7. 'A foolish man does not reach heaven, though he may offer (sacrifices) or give (gifts).'</p>  
 <p>8. 'He is called a foolish man whose conduct is blemished by doubts, and who, clinging to his own fancies, transgresses (the rules of) the <i>S</i>âstras, because he opposes the fulfilment of the sacred law.' <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. But pot-herbs, flowers, fruit, roots, and annual plants (must be) sprinkled (with water). <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. Having placed dry grass, wood of trees unfit for sacrifices or a clod of earth (on the ground), let him void faeces or urine, turning his face during the day towards the north and at night towards the south and wrapping up his head. <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>

 <p>11. (After voiding) urine he shall clean (the organ once) with earth and water, <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. The hand three times.</p>  
 <p>13. In like manner (he shall clean himself with earth and water after voiding) faeces. <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. The number (of the applications of both is) thrice three for both feet and the hand.</p>  
 <p>15. After an effusion of semen (he shall purify himself) in the same manner as after voiding urine. <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. He shall wash himself, after he has untied or put on the cloth round his loins, <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Or he may touch moist grass, cowdung, or earth. <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. While he is engaged in (the performance of) religious rites, he shall avoid to touch (the part of his body) below the navel. <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. The Veda (declares), 'A man's (body) is pure above the navel, it is impure below the navel.' <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_877"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. <i>S</i>ûdras living in the service of Âryans shall trim (their hair and nails) every month; their mode <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_878"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>

 <p>of sipping water (shall be) the same as that of Âryans.</p>  
 <p>21. A Vai<i>s</i>ya may live by usury. <a name="fr_879"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. But (a sum of) twenty-five (kârshâpa<i>n</i>as shall bear an interest) of five mâshas (per mensem). <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. Now they quote also (the following verses) 'He who, acquiring property cheap, employs (it so that it yields) a higher price, is called a usurer, and blamed in all (treatises on) the sacred law.' '(Brahman) weighed in the scales the crime of killing a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a against (the crime of) usury; the slayer of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a remained at the top, the usurer sank downwards.' <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. 'Let him treat Brâhma<i>n</i>as who tend cattle, those who live by trade, (and) those who are artisans, actors (and bards), servants or usurers, like <i>S</i>ûdras.' <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. But men of the first two castes may, at their pleasure, lend (money at interest) to one who neglects his sacred duties, to a miser, to an atheist, or to a very wicked man. <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. Through the neglect of sacrifices, of (lawful) marriages, of the study of the Veda, and of (learned) Brâhma<i>n</i>as, (noble) families (even) are degraded. <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. The offence of neglecting a Brâhma<i>n</i>a cannot be committed against a fool who is unacquainted <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>

 <p>with the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one does not pass by a brilliant fire and throw the oblations into ashes.</p>  
 <p>28. Families which are deficient in (the knowledge of) the Veda, are degraded by (keeping) cows, horses and vehicles, by agriculture and by serving the king. <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. But even poor families which are rich in (the knowledge of) the Veda obtain rank among the (noble) families and gain great fame.</p>  
 <p>30. The (study of) the Veda impedes (the pursuit of) agriculture, (the pursuit of) agriculture impedes (the study of) the Veda. He who is able (to do it), may attend to both; but he who is unable (to attend to both), shall give up agriculture.</p>  
 <p>31. A fat, bellowing, raging humped bull, who does not restrain himself, who hurts living creatures and speaks according to his pleasure, forsooth, does not reach the (abode of) the gods; (but) those who are small like atoms, (being) emaciated (by austerities and fasts), go thither.</p>  
 <p>32. If, erring, in his youth he commits at any time good or evil acts of any kind, (they will all remain without result). (For) if in his later age he lives righteously, he will obtain (the reward of) that (virtuous conduct) alone, not (the punishments of his former) crimes.</p>  
 <p>33. Let him always be sorrowing in his heart, when he thinks of his sins, (let him) practise austerities and be careful; thus he will be freed from sin.</p>

It would, however, seem that this rule refers to food prepared by <i>S</i>ûdras, without the super-visions of Âryans. For Âpastamba's Sûtra, which contains the same word, paroksham, 'out of sight,' certainly has reference to that case only, and there is no reason why food prepared by Brahman cooks should be purified before it is eaten.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_867"></a><a href="sbe1443.htm#fr_867">172:3</a> Âpastamba I, 5, 17, 19. The eatables here intended are, according to Govinda, Lâ<i>d</i>us and other sweet-meats which are frequently bought ready made.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_868"></a><a href="sbe1443.htm#fr_868">173:8</a> Dharmatantra, translated 'the fulfilment of the sacred law,' is explained in the commentary by dharmasya tantram anush<i>th</i>ânam, by 'the performance of the sacred duties.' It may also mean 'the doctrine of or the treatises on the sacred law.' The <i>S</i>âstras are the Vedas and the whole body of the sacred literature.</p>

But âryâdhish<i>th</i>itâ<i>h</i>, 'living in the service of Âryans,' may also mean 'superintended by Âryans,' and the rule be taken to refer to the special case of <i>S</i>ûdra cooks, as in the parallel passage of Âpastamba.</p>
