 <p>1. Now, therefore, the desire to know the sacred law for their welfare (should arise) in (initiated) men. <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. He who knows and follows the (sacred law is called) a righteous man.</p>  
 <p>3. He becomes most worthy of praise in this world and after death gains heaven. <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. The sacred law has been settled by the revealed texts and by the tradition (of the sages).</p>  
 <p>5. On failure of (rules given in) these (two sources) the practice of the <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>as (has) authority.</p>  
 <p>6. But he whose heart is free from desire (is called) a <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>a.</p>  
 <p>7. (Acts sanctioned by) the sacred law (are those) for which no (worldly) cause is perceptible. <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 </p>

 <p>8. The country of the Âryas (Âryâvarta) lies to the east of the region where (the river Sarasvatî) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest, to the north of the Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of the Himâlaya. <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. (According to others it lies to the south of the Himâlaya) and to the north of the Vindhya range (being limited east and west by the two oceans). <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. Acts productive of spiritual merit, and customs which (are approved of) in that country, must be everywhere acknowledged (as authoritative);</p>  
 <p>11. But not different ones, (i.e. those) of (countries where) laws opposed (to those of Âryâvarta prevail). <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Some (declare the country of the Âryas to be situated) between the (rivers) Gaṅgâ and Yamunâ. <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. Others (state as) an alternative, that spiritual pre-eminence (is found) as far as the black antelope grazes. <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Now the Bhâllavins quote also (the following) verse in the Nidâna: <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. 'In the west the boundary-river, in the east <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>  
 <p>the region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelope wanders (between these two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).</p>  
 <p>16. 'Those religious acts which men, deeply versed in the knowledge of the three Vedas and acquainted with the sacred law, declare to be lawful, (are efficient) for purifying oneself and others.' <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Manu has declared that the (peculiar) laws of countries, castes, and families (may be followed) in the absence of (rules of) the revealed texts. <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. Sinful men are, he who sleeps at sunrise or at sunset, he who has deformed nails or black teeth, he whose younger brother was married first, he who married before his elder brother, the husband of a younger sister married before the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose younger sister was married first, he who extinguishes the sacred fires, (and) he who forgets the Veda through neglect of the daily recitation. <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. They state that there are five mortal sins. (mahâpâtaka),</p>  
 <p>20. (Viz. violating) a Guru's bed, drinking (the spirituous liquor called) surâ, slaying a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a, stealing the gold of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and associating with outcasts, <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. Either by (entering into) spiritual or matrimonial (connexion with them). <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who during a year associates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.' <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. A minor offence causing loss of caste (ûpapâtaka, is committed by him) who (after beginning an Agnihotra sacrifice) forsakes the sacred fires, and by him who offends a Guru, by an atheist, by him who takes his livelihood from atheists, and by him who sells the Soma (plant). <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. Three wives (are permitted) to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a according to the order of the castes, two to a Kshatriya, one to a Vai<i>s</i>ya and to a <i>S</i>ûdra. <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. Some declare (that twice-born men may marry) even a female of the <i>S</i>ûdra caste, like those (other wives), without (the recitation of) Vedic texts.</p>  
 <p>26. Let him not act thus. <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. For in consequence of such (a marriage) the degradation of the family certainly ensues, and after death the loss of heaven.</p>  
 <p>28. There are six marriage-rites, <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. (Viz.) that of Brahman (brâhma), that of the gods (daiva), that of the <i>Ri</i>shis (ârsha), that of the Gandharvas (gândharva), that of the Kshatriyas (kshâtra), and that of men (mânusha).</p>  
 <p>30. If the father, pouring out a libation of water, gives his (daughter) to a suitor, that (is called) the Brahma-rite <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. If (the father) gives his daughter, decking her with ornaments, to an officiating priest, whilst a sacrifice is being performed, that is called the Daiva-rite. <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. And (if the father gives his daughter) for a cow and a bull, (that is called) the Ârsha-rite. <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">32</font></a></p>  
 <p>33. If a lover takes a loving female of equal caste, that (is called) the Gândharva-rite. <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. If they forcibly abduct (a damsel), destroying (her relatives) by strength (of arms), that (is called) the Kshâtra-rite. <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">34</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. If, after making a bargain (with the father, a <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">35</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>suitor) marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the Mânusha-rite.</p>  
 <p>36. The purchase (of a wife) is mentioned in the following passage of the Veda, 'Therefore one hundred (cows) besides a chariot should be given to the father of the bride.' <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>  
 <p>37. (It is stated) in (the following passage of) the <i>K</i>âturmâsyas, 'She (forsooth) who has been bought by her husband (commits sin, as) afterwards she unites herself with strangers.' <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">37</font></a></p>  
 <p>38. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Lost learning comes back; when the family is lost all is lost. Even a horse becomes estimable on account of its pedigree; therefore men marry wives descended from an (unblemished) family.</p>  
 <p>39. The three (lower) castes shall live according to the teaching of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">39</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p>40. The Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall declare their duties,</p>  
 <p>41. And the king shall govern them accordingly.</p>  
 <p>42. But a king who rules in accordance with the sacred law, may take the sixth part of the wealth (of his subjects), <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">42</font></a></p>  
 <p>43. Except from Brâhma<i>n</i>as. <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">43</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. It has been declared in the Veda, 'But he obtains the sixth part of (the merit which Brâhma<i>n</i>as gain by) sacrifices and charitable works.' <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">44</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. (It is further stated in the Veda), 'The Brâhma<i>n</i>a makes the Veda rich; the Brâhma<i>n</i>a saves from misfortune; therefore the Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall not be made a source of subsistence. Soma is his king.' <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">45</font></a></p>  
 <p>46. Further (another passage says), 'After death bliss (awaits the king who does not oppress Brâhma<i>n</i>as).'</p>

It marks the beginning of the book, serves as an auspicious invocation (maṅgala), and indicates that something else, the initiation, must precede the study of the sacred law. 'Therefore' means 'because, after initiation, the neophyte is to be taught the prescribed rules regarding personal purification:--K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita. For the wording of the Sûtra compare the be-ginning of <i>G</i>aimini's Mîmâ<i>m</i>sâ-sûtras.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_58"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_58">1:7</a> The Sûtra contains a limitation of Sûtra 5. It indicates that the customs of the <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>as, for which worldly motives are perceptible, have no authority, and are not to be followed. The principle enunciated is one inculcated by the Mîmâ<i>m</i>sakas (P: M. S. <a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 2</font></a> I, 3, 3-4). See also Âpastamba I, 1, 4, 5-10; I, 4, 12, 8; and Introduction, p. xxvii. K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita has misunderstood the Sûtra. He reads, against the MSS., ag<i>ri</i>hyamâ<i>n</i>akâra<i>n</i>o ’dharma<i>h</i>, 'unlawful acts are those for which no motive, i.e. no sacred source such as the Vedas, is perceptible.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_59"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_59">2:8</a> The region where the river Sarasvatî disappears is the Pattiâlâ district in the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>âb. The Pâripâtra mountains belong to the great Vindhya range, and are probably the hills in Mâlvâ. The position of the Kâlakavana or Black-forest is not accurately known. But it must probably be sought in Bihâr. All the MSS. as well as K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita read in this Sûtra prâgâdar<i>s</i>anât instead of prâgadar<i>s</i>anât, 'to the east of the region where the river Sarasvatî disappears.' This circumstance gains some importance by the fact that the Mahâbhâshya on Pâ<i>n</i>ini II, 4, 10, quotes the same definition of the Âryâvarta, giving, however, instead of adar<i>s</i>anât prâgâdar<i>s</i>ât, 'to the east of Âdar<i>s</i>a, i.e. the Âdar<i>s</i>a mountains.' It seems to me not improbable that our Sûtra, too, had originally prâgâdar<i>s</i>ât, and that some Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>it who knew nothing about the Âdar<i>s</i>a hills, but remembered Manu II, as, and Baudhâyana I, 1, 25, where the word vina<i>s</i>anât, 'the disappearance of the Sarasvatî,' undoubtedly occurs, added the syllable na and forgot to correct the â, after prâg.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_60"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_60">2:9</a> The translation follows K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita's commentary, which recommends itself on account of the analogous definition of Âryâvarta given by Manu II, 22.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_61"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_61">2:11</a> My translation follows the text given by K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita and <a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a> B., and the explanation of the former, because it seems to me that the general sense which they give, is the correct one. I feel, however, not certain that the word. pratilomakadharmâ<i>n</i>âm, 'of those countries where opposite laws prevail,' is more than a care less correction. The majority of the MSS. read pratilomakakshadharmâ<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> (kalpadharmâ<i>n</i>a<i>h</i>), which by itself is difficult of explanation. But, as the text of the next Sûtra contains an apparently superfluous phrase, I fear, we shall have to admit that the text is here disfigured by corruptions, which with our present MSS. it is impossible to remove with certainty.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_62"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_62">3:12</a> K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita reads this Sutra 'etad âryâvartam ityâ<i>k</i>akshate gaṅgâyamunayor antaretyeke,' and takes it as one sentence, the subject of which is 'eke.' I feel no doubt that this explanation is utterly untenable, and that the first four words have nothing to do with this Sutra, the second part of which occurs also in the Baudhâyana Dharma-sûtra I, 1, 27. My opinion is that they originally belonged to Sûtra 11, though the state of the MSS. at my disposal does not allow me to say how Sûtra 11 has to be corrected. The general sense of Sûtra 12 is, however, perfectly certain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_63"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_63">3:13</a> Manu II, 23; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 2. It deserves to be noted that the black antelope (black-buck), Oryx cervicapra, selects for its home the well-cultivated, rich plains of India only, and is entirely wanting in the sandy, mountainous or forest districts, which are now, just as in ancient times, the portion of the aboriginal tribes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_64"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_64">3:14</a> Regarding the Bhâllavins, see Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, pp. 193, 364. K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita thinks that Nidâna means de<i>s</i>anir<i>n</i>aya, 'the disquisition on the countries,' which is the title of a section which occurs in most modern compilations on law. But it will be safer to take it as the name of a Vedic work, identical with or similar to that quoted in <i>S</i>aunaka's B<i>ri</i>haddevatâ, Weber, Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 81.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_65"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_65">3:15</a> Sindhur vidhâra<i>n</i>î or vidhara<i>n</i>î, as B. reads, cannot be <a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a> taken with K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita, as 'the ocean,' because in the latter sense sindhu is a masculine. It must be a boundary-river, probably the Sarasvatî. By sûryasyodana, 'the region where the sun rises,' the udayagiri or 'mountain of the east' may possibly be meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_66"></a><a href="sbe1404.htm#fr_66">4:16</a> This verse, too, is marked as a quotation by the concluding word iti, though it is not necessary that it should be taken as a quotation from the Nidâna. Here, and in the sequel verses ending in iti are marked as quotations by hyphens.</p>

Usually the word 'caste' is also applied to them.</p>

It is, however, not a separate work, but the kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a or section of a Vedic work treating of the <i>K</i>âturmâsya sacrifices (see Max Müller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 355). The particular work from which our quotation has been taken, is either the Maitrâyâ<i>n</i>îya Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, or the Kâ<i>th</i>aka. For, as Dr. von Schroeder informs me, Maitrâyâ<i>n</i>îya Sa<i>m</i>hitâ I, 10, 11 reads 'an<i>ri</i>ta<i>m</i> vâ eshâ karoti yâ patyu<i>h</i> krîtâ satyathânyai<i>s</i> <i>k</i>arati,' and the title of the kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a is <i>K</i>âturmâsyâni.

The words 'iti ha,' placed at the end of the Sûtra, indicate that it is a quotation, and that vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âyate, 'it is declared in the Veda,' has to be understood from Sûtra 46. Gautama XI, 11, too, alleges that the rule is based on a Vedic passage.</p>

K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita's division of the quotation into several Sûtras is unnecessary. His explanation of anâdya, which he takes to mean 'the first of all,' is wrong. He asserts that the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is said 'to make the Veda rich,' because by sacrificing and so forth he fulfils its object and protects it. But the phrase is probably corrupt. If it is said that Soma is the king of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, the object is to indicate that an earthly king is not their master, see Gautama XI, 1.</p>
