   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER IV.</h3>  
 <p>1. The four castes are distinguished by their origin and by particular sacraments. <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. There is also the following passage of the Veda, 'The Brâhma<i>n</i>a was his mouth, the Kshatriya formed his arms, the Vai<i>s</i>ya his thighs; the <i>S</i>ûdra was born from his feet.' <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. It has been declared in (the following passage</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>of) the Veda that (a <i>S</i>ûdra) shall not receive the sacraments, 'He created the Brâhma<i>n</i>a with the Gâyatrî (metre), the Kshatriya with the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, the Vai<i>s</i>ya with the <i>G</i>agatî, the <i>S</i>ûdra without any metre.'</p>  
 <p>4. Truthfulness, suppression of anger, liberality, abstention from injuring living beings, and the procreation of offspring (are duties common to) all (castes). <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. The Mânava (Sûtra states), 'Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.' <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. 'On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.' <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. 'Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).' <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. 'Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brâhma<i>n</i>a or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).' <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. Libations of water (must be poured out) for all (deceased relatives) who completed the second year and (their death causes) impurity.</p>  
 <p>10. Some declare that (this rule applies also to children) that died after teething.</p>  
 <p>11. After having burnt the body (of the deceased, the relatives) enter the water without looking at (the place of cremation), <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Facing the south, they shall pour out water with both hands on (those days of the period of impurity) which are marked by odd numbers. <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. The south, forsooth, is the region sacred to the manes.</p>  
 <p>14. After they have gone home, they shall sit during three days on mats, fasting. <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. If they are unable (to fast so long), they shall subsist on food bought in the market or given unasked. <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. It is ordered that impurity caused by a death shall last ten days in the case of Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a relations.</p>  
 <p>17. It has been declared in the Veda that Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a relationship extends to the seventh person (in the ascending or descending line). <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. It has been declared in the Veda that for married females it extends to the third person (in the ascending or descending line).</p>  
 <p>19. Others (than the blood-relations) shall perform (the obsequies) of married females, <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. (The rule regarding impurity) should be exactly the same on the birth of a child for those men who desire complete purity, <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. Or for the mother and the father (of the child alone); some (declare that it applies) to the <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>mother (only), because she is the immediate cause of that (event).</p>  
 <p>22. Now they quote also (the following verse): On the birth (of a child) the male does not become impure if he does not touch (the female); on that (occasion) the menstrual excretion must be known to be impure, and that is not found in males.'</p>  
 <p>23. If during (a period of impurity) another (death or birth) happens, (the relatives) shall be pure after (the expiration of) the remainder of that (first period); <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. (But) if one night (and day only of the first period of impurity) remain, (they shall be pure) after two (days and nights); <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. (If the second death or birth happens) on the morning (of the day on which the first period of impurity expires, they shall be purified) after three (days and nights). <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a is freed from impurity (caused by a death or a birth) after ten days, <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. A Kshatriya after fifteen days,</p>  
 <p>28. A Vai<i>s</i>ya after twenty days,</p>  
 <p>29. A <i>S</i>ûdra after a month. <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But (a twice-born man) who has eaten (the food) of a <i>S</i>ûdra during impurity caused by a death or a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>birth, will suffer dreadful (punishment in) hell and be born again in the womb of an animal.'</p>  
 <p>31. 'A twice-born man who eats by appointment in the house of a stranger whose ten days of impurity, caused by a death, have not expired, after death will become a worm and feed on the ordure of that (man who fed him).'</p>  
 <p>32. It has been declared in the Veda, '(Such a sinner) becomes pure by reciting the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ of the Veda for twelve months or for twelve half-months while fasting.' <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">32</font></a></p>  
 <p>33. On the death of a child of less than two years or on a miscarriage, the impurity of the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as lasts three (days and) nights. <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. Gautama (declares that on the former occasion they become) pure at once. <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">34</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. If (a person) dies in a foreign country and (his Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as) hear (of his death) after ten days (or a longer period), the impurity lasts for one (day and) night.</p>  
 <p>36. Gautama (declares that) if a person who has kindled the sacred fire dies on a journey, (his Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as shall) again celebrate his obsequies, (burning a dummy made of leaves or straw), and remain impure (during ten days) as if (they had actually buried) his corpse. <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>  
 <p>37. When he has touched a sacrificial post, a pyre, a burial-ground, a menstruating or a lately confined woman, impure men or (<i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âlas and so forth), he shall bathe, submerging both his body and his head. <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">37</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_167"></a><a href="sbe1407.htm#fr_167">26:5</a> Mânavam, 'the Mânava (Sûtra),' means literally 'a work proclaimed by Manu' (manunâ proktam). It is probable that the work referred to by Vasish<i>th</i>a is the lost Dharma-sûtra of the Mânava <i>S</i>âkhâ, which is a subdivision of the Maitrâya<i>n</i>îyas, and on which the famous metrical Mânava Dharma<i>s</i>âstra is based. The words of the Sûtra may either be a direct quotation or a summary of the opinion given in the Mânava-sûtra. I think the former supposition the more probable one, and believe that not only Sûtra 5, but also Sûtras 6-8 have been taken bodily from the ancient Dharma-sûtra. For Sûtra 6 agrees literally with a verse of the metrical Manusm<i>ri</i>ti, and at the end of Sûtra 8 several MSS. have the word iti, the characteristic mark that a quotation is finished, while the language of Sûtra 8 is more antiquated than Vasish<i>th</i>a's usual style. If my view is correct, it follows that the lost Mânava Dharma-sûtra consisted, like nearly all the known works of this class, partly of prose and partly of verse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_168"></a><a href="sbe1407.htm#fr_168">26:6</a> Identical with Manu V, 41; Vish<i>n</i>u LI, 64; and Sâṅkhâyana G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra II, 16, 1.

The reading is, however, wrong, because the parallel passages of most Sm<i>ri</i>tis enjoin that a man who has touched a sacrificial post shall bathe. The cause of the mistake is probably a mere clerical error. The MSS. repeat the last word of this chapter, apa ityapa<i>h</i>. The reason is not, as K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita imagines, that the author wishes to indicate the necessity of bathing when one touches a person who has touched some impure thing or person. It is the universal practice of the ancient authors to repeat the last word of a chapter in order to mark its end, see e<i>g</i>. Gautama note on I, 61. If it is neglected in the earlier chapters of the Vâsish<i>th</i>a Dharma-sûtra, the badness of the MSS. is the cause.</p>
