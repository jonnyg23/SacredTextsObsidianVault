 <p>1. They declare that the offspring of a <i>S</i>ûdra and of a female of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a caste becomes a <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla, <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. (That of a <i>S</i>ûdra and) of a female of the Kshatriya caste, a Vai<i>n</i>a,</p>  
 <p>3. (That of a <i>S</i>ûdra and) of a female of the Vai<i>s</i>ya caste, an Antyâvasâyin.</p>  
 <p>4. They declare that the (son) begotten by a Vai<i>s</i>ya on a female of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a caste becomes a Râmaka, <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. (The son begotten by the same) on a female of the Kshatriya caste, a Pulkasa.</p>  
 <p>6. They declare that the (son) begotten by a Kshatriya on a female of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a caste becomes a Sûta. <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'One may know by their deeds those who have been begotten secretly, and to whom the stigma of springing from unions in the inverse order of the castes attaches, because they are destitute of virtue and good conduct.' <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p>8. (Children) begotten by Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<i>s</i>yas on females of the next lower, second lower, and third lower castes become (respectively) Ambash<i>th</i>as, Ugras, and Nishâdas. <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. (The son of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a and) of a <i>S</i>ûdra woman (is) a Pâra<i>s</i>ava.</p>  
 <p>10. They declare that the condition of a Pâra<i>s</i>ava is that of one who, though living, is (as impure) as a corpse. <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. Some call that <i>S</i>ûdra race a burial-ground. <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Therefore (the Veda) must not be recited in the presence of a <i>S</i>ûdra.</p>  
 <p>13. Now they quote also the (following) verses, which Yama proclaimed:</p>  
 <p>'The wicked <i>S</i>ûdra-race is manifestly a burial-ground. Therefore (the Veda) must never be recited in the presence of a <i>S</i>ûdra.'</p>  
 <p>14. 'Let him not give advice to a <i>S</i>ûdra, nor what remains from his table, nor (remnants of) offerings (to the gods); nor let him explain the holy law to such a man, nor order him (to perform) a penance.' <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. 'He who declares the law to such a man, and he who instructs him in (the mode of) expiating (sin), sinks together with that very man into the dreadful hell, (called) Asa<i>m</i>v<i>ri</i>ta.'</p>  
 <p>16. 'If ever a worm is produced in an open wound (on his body), he shall purify himself by the Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya penance, and give gold, a cow, (and) a garment as presents (to Brâhma<i>n</i>as).' <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p>17. Let him not approach a wife of the <i>S</i>ûdra caste after he has built the fire-altar for a <i>S</i>rauta-sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>18. For a <i>S</i>ûdra-wife who belongs to the black race, (is espoused) for pleasure, not in order to fulfil the law.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_543"></a><a href="sbe1421.htm#fr_543">94:4</a> K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita reads Romaka, 'a Roman,' for Râmaka, and the B. MS. supports him. The other MSS., including I. O. 913, give the reading adopted above. I prefer it, as there is no reason to assume that the Vâsish<i>th</i>a Dharma<i>s</i>âstra belongs to the late period when the Hindus had become aware of the existence of the Roman empire. On the other hand, it may be urged that Romaka is a correction which would easily suggest itself to a Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>it, who was unable to find a parallel passage in which the word Râmaka occurs.</p>
