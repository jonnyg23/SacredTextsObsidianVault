   <h3 align="center">PRA<i>S</i>NA I, ADHYÂYA 4, KA<i>N</i><i>D</i>IKÂ 6.</h3>  
 <p>1. Now (those who know the law) prescribe the carrying of a waterpot. <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. It is declared (in the Vedas) that fire (resides) in the right ear of a goat, in the right hand of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, likewise in water (and) in a bundle of Ku<i>s</i>a grass. Therefore after personal purification let him wipe (his water-vessel) on all sides with his (right) hand, (reciting the mantra), 'Blaze up, O fire;' for that (is called) encircling it with fire and is preferable to heating (the pot on the fire). <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. With reference to this matter they prescribe also (the following rules): 'If he thinks in his heart that (the pot) has been slightly defiled, let him light Ku<i>s</i>a or (other) grass and heat (the pot) on all sides, keeping his right hand turned towards it.' <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. 'If (pots) have been touched by crows, dogs, or <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p>other (unclean animals, they shall be heated, until they are of) the colour of fire, after the (paryagnikara<i>n</i>a has been performed).'</p>  
 <p>5. (Pots) which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like must be thrown away. <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. If his waterpot has been broken, let him offer one hundred (oblations) reciting the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, or mutter (the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis as often). <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. (Reciting the text), 'Earth went to earth, the mother joined the mother; may we have sons and cattle; may he who hates us be destroyed,' he shall collect the fragments, throw them into water, repeat the Gâyatrî at least ten times and take again another (pot). <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. Taking refuge with Varu<i>n</i>a, (he shall recite the mantra), 'That (belongs) to thee, Varu<i>n</i>a; again to me, Om,' (and) meditate on the indestructible. <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>9. 'If he has received (the new vessel) from a <i>S</i>ûdra, let him recite (the Gâyatrî) one hundred (times). (If he has received it) from a Vai<i>s</i>ya, fifty (repetitions of the Gâyatrî) are prescribed, but (on receiving it) from a Kshatriya twenty-five, (and on taking it) from a Brâhma<i>n</i>a ten.' <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. Those who recite the Veda are doubtful whether he shall fetch water after the sun has, set or shall not fetch it.</p>  
 <p>11. The most excellent (opinion is) that he may fetch it.</p>  
 <p>12. Let him restrain his breath, while he fetches water.</p>  
 <p>13. Fire, forsooth, takes up water. <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. It is declared (in the Veda), 'When he has washed his hands and feet with water from his water-vessel, he is impure for others, as long as the moisture (remains). He purifies himself only. Let him not perform other religious rites (with water from his pot).' <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>

 <p>15. Baudhâyana (says), 'Or if on the occasion of each personal purification (he washes himself with other water) up to the wrist, (he will become) pure.' <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. Now they quote also (the following verses):</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_810"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_810">160:1</a> <b>6</b>. As Govinda observes, the rules regarding the waterpot (kama<i>n</i><i>d</i>alu) are introduced here in connexion with I, 3, 5, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_811"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_811">160:2</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a XII, 15-16. The mantra is found, Taittirîya Âra<i>n</i>yaka X, 1, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_812"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_812">160:3</a> The word upadi<i>s</i>anti, 'they prescribe,' stands at the end of Sûtra 4, as it refers to both rules.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_813"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_813">160:4</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a III, 59. The paryagnikara<i>n</i>a is the rite prescribed in Sûtra 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_814"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_814">161:5</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a III, 59.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_815"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_815">161:6</a> Regarding the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, see Gautama I, 51.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_816"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_816">161:7</a> Govinda says that Vâmadeva is the <i>Ri</i>shi of the mantra. The fragments of the pot are to be thrown into a river or tank, in order to preserve them from defilement. See also Journ. Bo. Br. Roy. As. Soc., No. XXXIV A, p. 55 note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_817"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_817">161:8</a> 'Taking refuge with Varu<i>n</i>a, i.e. saying, "I flee for safety to Varu<i>n</i>a." (The words), "That for thee, Varu<i>n</i>a, again to me, Om," (are) the mantras (to be recited) on taking (a new vessel). Its meaning is this: "Those fragments which I have thrown into the water shall belong to thee, Varu<i>n</i>a," (Saying), "Come, thou (who art) a lord of water-vessels, again to me, Om," he shall meditate on another visible pot as indestructible, i.e. at the end of the Vedic (word) "Om," let him meditate, (i.e.) recollect, that not everything will be turned topsy-turvy, (but that some things are) also indestructible, i.e. that that is not destroyed, does not perish.'--Govinda. The explanation of the last clause of our Sûtra seems to be that, on pronouncing the syllable (akshara) Om, the reciter is <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a> to recollect the etymological import of the word akshara, 'indestructible,' and thus to guard the new vessel against the mishap which befell the old one.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_818"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_818">162:9</a> According to Govinda, either the pra<i>n</i>ava, the syllable Om, or the Gâyatrî are the mantras to be recited, and the recitation is a penance to be performed when the vessel is received. The MSS. of the text mark the verse as quotation by adding the word 'iti,' which the commentary omits.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_819"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_819">162:13</a> According to Govinda, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who goes to fetch water at night, which he may want for personal purification, is ordered to restrain his breath, because thereby the air in the body becomes strong, and fire or heat (agni) is produced. Now as at night the sun is stated to enter the fire and to become subject to it, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, who by restraining his breath has produced fire, has secured the presence of the sun, when he goes to fetch water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_820"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_820">162:14</a> Govinda expressly states that the word vie, vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âyate, 'it is declared,'<a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a> literally, 'it is distinctly known,' always indicates that the passage quoted is taken from the Veda. The rites for which water from the waterpot is not to be used, are libations to the manes, the gods, and the fire. See also below, I, 4, 7, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_821"></a><a href="sbe1439.htm#fr_821">163:15</a> The words enclosed between parentheses are Govinda's.</p>
