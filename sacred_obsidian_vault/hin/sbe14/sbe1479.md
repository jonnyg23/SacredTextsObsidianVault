Having kindled the sacred fire in the morning according to the rule for Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as, having scattered (Ku<i>s</i>a grass) around it, and having performed (the preliminary ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, he next offers in addition burnt oblations, reciting the three Anuvâkas (beginning), 'What cause of anger to the gods, ye gods,' 'The debts which I contracted,' (and) 'May worshipful Agni give thee by every means long life.' <a name="fr_1368"></a><a href="#fn_1368"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>

 <p>by thoughts or words, from all that free me (O fire, being duly) praised, for thou knowest the truth, Svâhâ,' he gives a fee.</p>  
 <p>14. (The ceremonies) which begin with the muttering (of the texts) and end with the gift of a cow as a fee are known.</p>  
 <p>15. One (person) only (shall) perform the service of the fire.</p>  
 <p>16. Now (let him offer) at the Agnyâdheya full oblations (pûr<i>n</i>âhuti, with the texts), 'Whatever cause of anger to the gods, ye gods;' 'The debts which I contracted;" May worshipful Agni give thee by every means long life.' <a name="fr_1371"></a><a href="#fn_1371"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Having offered (it), he who is about to perform the Agnihotra, (worships) with the Da<i>s</i>ahot<i>ri</i> (texts); having offered (it), he who is about to perform the new and full moon sacrifices (worships) with the <i>K</i>aturhot<i>ri</i> (texts); having offered (it), he who is about to offer the <i>K</i>âturmâsya sacrifices (worships) with the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ahot<i>ri</i> (texts); having offered it, (he worships) at an animal sacrifice with the Sha<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ot<i>ri</i> (texts), at a Soma-sacrifice with the Saptahot<i>ri</i> (texts). <a name="fr_1372"></a><a href="#fn_1372"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. And it is declared in the Veda, 'Let him sacrifice (with the Kûshmâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a texts) at the beginning of the rites; purified (thereby) he gains the world of the gods.' Thus (speaks) the Brâhma<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_1373"></a><a href="#fn_1373"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>
