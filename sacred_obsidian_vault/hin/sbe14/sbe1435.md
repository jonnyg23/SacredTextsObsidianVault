   <h3 align="center">PRA<i>S</i>NA I, ADHYÂYA 1, KA<i>N</i><i>D</i>IKÂ 2.</h3>  
 <p>1. There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and in the north. <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. We will explain those (peculiar) to the south.</p>  
 <p>3. They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in the company of one's wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt. <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, to drink rum, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to follow the trade of arms, to go to sea. <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin. <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. For each (of these customs) the (rule of the) country should be (considered) the authority.</p>  
 <p>7. Gautama declares that that is false. <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. And one should not take heed of either (set of practices) because they are opposed to the tradition of the <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>as.</p>  
 <p>9. The country of the Âryas (Âryâvarta) lies to the east of the region where (the river Sarasvatî) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest (Kâlakavana), to the north of the Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of the Himâlaya. The rule of conduct which (prevails) there, is authoritative. <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. Some (declare) the country between the (rivers) Yamunâ and Ganges (to be the Âryâvarta). <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_748"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. Now the Bhâllavins quote also the (following) verse: <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_749"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. 'In the west the boundary-river, in the east the region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelopes wander (between these two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).' <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>

 <p>13. The inhabitants of Avantî, of Aṅga, of Magadha, of Surâsh<i>t</i>ra, of the Dekhan, of Upâv<i>ri</i>t, of Sindh, and the Sauvîrâs are of mixed origin. <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. He who has visited the (countries of the) Âra<i>t</i><i>t</i>as, Kâraskaras, Pu<i>n</i><i>d</i>ras, Sauvîras, Vaṅgas, Kaliṅgas, (or) Prânûnas shall offer a Punastoma or a Sarvap<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>â (ish<i>t</i>i). <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He commits sin through his feet, who travels to the (country of the) Kaliṅgas. The sages declare the Vai<i>s</i>vânarî ish<i>t</i>i to be a purification for him.' <a name="fr_753"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. 'Even if many offences have been committed, they recommend for the removal of the sin the Pavitresh<i>t</i>i. For that (sacrifice) is a most excellent means of purification.'</p>  
 <p>17. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who performs (by turns) in each season the Vai<i>s</i>vânarî (ish<i>t</i>i), the Vrâtapatî (ish<i>t</i>i), and the Pavitresh<i>t</i>i is freed from (all) sins.' <a name="fr_754"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_742"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_742">146:1</a> <b>2</b>. The boundary between the north and south of India is, as Govinda also points out, the river Narmadâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_743"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_743">146:3</a> Some of the customs mentioned here still prevail in parts of southern India. Thus the marriages between cousins occur among the De<i>s</i>astha and Karhâ<i>d</i>â Brâhma<i>n</i>as of the Dekhan.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_744"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_744">146:4</a> The first two customs mentioned still prevail in the north, especially in Ka<i>s</i>mîr, where Brâhma<i>n</i>as commonly deal in wool and woollen cloth. Spirituous liquor is not now drunk openly, but its use is sanctioned in the Ka<i>s</i>mîrian Nîlamata-purâ<i>n</i>a. Many Brâhmanical families in the north, especially in the North-western Provinces, subsist by enlisting as soldiers in the British and native armies.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_745"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_745">147:5</a>-6. A similar argument is given by the Ka<i>s</i>mîrians for the lawfulness of the consumption of meat, which they justify by a de<i>s</i>agu<i>n</i>a or 'virtue of their country.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_746"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_746">147:7</a> Gautama XI, 20.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_747"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_747">147:9</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 8, 10. Many MSS., and among them the Telugu copy of the commentary, read Pâriyâtra instead of Pâripâtra, which latter I consider to be the correct form of the word.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_748"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_748">147:10</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 12.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_749"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_749">147:11</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 14. Govinda remarks that the Bhâllavins are a school studying the Sâma-veda. See also Max Müller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., pp. 193, 364.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_750"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_750">147:12</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 15. There is a great uncertainty in the MSS. about the word following sindhu<i>h</i>. I have adopted the reading of <a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a> M., sindhur vidhara<i>n</i>î, 'the boundary-river,' which occurs also in the parallel passage of Vasish<i>th</i>a. The Dekhan and Gu<i>g</i>arât MSS. read vi<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>î or vi<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>â, and the two copies of the commentary visara<i>n</i>î. The sense of these various readings appears to be 'the river that vanishes or looses itself,' i.e. the Sarasvatî.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_751"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_751">148:13</a> This and the following two Sûtras are intended to show that the customs prevailing in the countries named have no authority and must not be followed. Avantî corresponds to western Mâlvâ, Aṅga to western Bengal, Magadha to Bihar, and Surâsh<i>t</i>ra to southern Ká<i>th</i>îâvâ<i>d</i>. The Sauvîras, who are always associated with the Sindhians, probably dwelt in the south-west of the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>âb, near Multân. The Upâv<i>ri</i>ts probably are the same as the Upâv<i>ri</i>ttas mentioned Mahâbhârata VI, 49. But I am unable to deter-mine their seats.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_752"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_752">148:14</a> The Âra<i>t</i><i>t</i>as dwelt in the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>âb (Lassen, Ind. Alth. I, p. 973, sec. ed.), and are greatly blamed, Mahâbhârata VIII, 44, 36 seq. The Kâraskaras are named in the same chapter of the Mahâbhârata as a degraded tribe, but seem to belong to the south of India. The Kaliṅgas are the inhabitants of the eastern coast of India, between Orissa and the mouth of the K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>â river. The Pu<i>n</i><i>d</i>ras, who are mentioned as a degraded tribe in the Aitareya-brâhma<i>n</i>a VII, 18, and occur frequently in the Mahâbhârata, and the Vaṅgas belong to Bengal (see Lassen, Ind. Alth. I, 669, sec. ed.; Cunningham, Anc. Geog. p. 480). Regarding the Pu<i>n</i>a-stoma, see Gautama XIX, 7 note; and regarding the Sarvap<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>â ish<i>t</i>i, Taittirîya-sa<i>m</i>hitâ II, 3, 7, 1-2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_753"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_753">148:15</a> Âpastamba I, 11, 32, 18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_754"></a><a href="sbe1435.htm#fr_754">149:17</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a XXII, 10. The meaning is that in each of the three seasons of the year, Grîshma, Varsha, Hemanta, one of the three sacrifices is to be offered.</p>
