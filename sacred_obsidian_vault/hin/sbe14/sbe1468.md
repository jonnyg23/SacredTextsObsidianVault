 <p>1. The offering to the manes secures long life and heaven, is worthy of praise and a rite ensuring prosperity. <a name="fr_1272"></a><a href="#fn_1272"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Persons who sanctify the company are, a Trimadhu, a Tri<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>iketa, a Trisupar<i>n</i>a, one who keeps five fires, and one who knows the six Aṅgas, one who performs the vow called <i>S</i>iras, one who knows the Gyesh<i>th</i>asâman, (and) a Snâtaka; <a name="fr_1273"></a><a href="#fn_1273"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. On failure of these, one who knows the (texts called) Rahasya. <a name="fr_1274"></a><a href="#fn_1274"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>4. The <i>Ri</i>k-verses, the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas, and the Sâmans (give) lustre to a funeral offering. Therefore he may feed (on that occasion) even a Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a relation who (knows) those (texts). <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1275"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. Let him who feeds (Brâhma<i>n</i>as at a funeral sacrifice) cause them to hear successively the Rakshoghna Sâmans, the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas (called) Svadhâvat, the <i>Ri</i>k-verses (called) Madhu, and the (texts called) Pavitras. <a name="fr_1276"></a><a href="#fn_1276"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. Having invited on the day before (the <i>S</i>râddha), or just in the morning, virtuous, pure (men), such as Trimadhus, who know the Vedâṅgas and the sacred texts, who are not related by marriage, nor members of the same family, nor connected through the Veda, at least three, (but always) an odd number, the (sacrificer) makes them sit down on prepared seats, covered with Darbha grass, facing the east or the north. <a name="fr_1277"></a><a href="#fn_1277"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. Then he offers to them water mixed with sesamum seed, adorns them with scents and garlands (and says), 'I wish to offer oblations in the fire.' <a name="fr_1278"></a><a href="#fn_1278"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> When he has received permission (to do so), he heaps fuel on the sacred fire, scatters Ku<i>s</i>a grass around it, performs (all the ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, and offers three burnt oblations of food only, (reciting the following texts): 'To Soma, accompanied by the manes, Svâhâ!' 'To Yama, accompanied by the Aṅgiras and by the manes, Svâhâ!' 'To Agni, who carries the offerings to the manes, who causes sacrifices to be well performed, Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>8. He shall make these three oblations with food only which has been sprinkled with the remainder of the (clarified butter). <a name="fr_1279"></a><a href="#fn_1279"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. Let him give a cake of food to the birds.</p>  
 <p>10. For it is declared in the Veda, 'The manes roam about in the shape of birds.'</p>  
 <p>11. Next he touches the (other food) with his hand and with the thumb,</p>  
 <p>12. (And recites the following texts): 'Fire sees thee, who art co-extensive with the earth, the <i>Ri</i>k-verses are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; the earth is the vessel for thee, the sky the cover; I offer thee in the mouth of Brahman, I offer thee in the Prâ<i>n</i>a and the Apâna of learned Brâhma<i>n</i>as; thou art imperishable, mayest thou never fail to (the manes of our) fathers yonder, in the other world.' 'Air hears thee, who art co-extensive with the middle sphere, <a name="fr_1280"></a><a href="#fn_1280"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>

 <p>the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; the earth is the vessel for thee, the sky the cover; . . . mayest thou never fail to the (manes of our) grandfathers yonder, in the other world.' 'The sun reveals thee, who art co-extensive with the sky, the Sâmans are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; . . . . mayest thou never fail to the (manes of our) great-grandfathers yonder, in the other world.'</p>

Its correctness is proved by the parallel passage of Âpastamba.</p>
