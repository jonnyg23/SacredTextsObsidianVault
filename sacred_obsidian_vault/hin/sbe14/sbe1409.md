   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER VI.</h3>  
 <p>1. (To live according to) the rule of conduct is doubtlessly the highest duty of all men. He whose soul is defiled by vile conduct perishes in this world and in the next. <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Neither austerities, nor (the study of) the Veda, nor (the performance of) the Agnihotra, nor lavish liberality can ever save him whose conduct is vile and who has strayed from this (path of duty).</p>  
 <p>3. The Vedas do not purify him who is deficient in good conduct, though he may have learnt them all together with the six Aṅgas; the sacred texts depart from such a man at death, even as birds, when full-fledged, leave their nest.</p>  
 <p>4. As the beauty of a wife causes no joy to a blind man, even so all the four Vedas together with the six Aṅgas and sacrifices give no happiness to him who is deficient in good conduct. <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. The sacred texts do not save from sin the deceitful man who behaves deceitfully. But that Veda, two syllables of which are studied in the right manner, purifies, just as the clouds (give beneficent rain) in the month of Isha. <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. A man of bad conduct is blamed among men, evils befal him constantly, he is afflicted with disease and short-lived. <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. Through good conduct man gains spiritual merit, through good conduct he gains wealth, through good conduct he obtains beauty, good conduct obviates the effect of evil marks. <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. A man who follows the rule of conduct established among the virtuous, who has faith and is free from envy, lives a hundred years, though he be destitute of all auspicious marks. <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. But a man who knows the sacred law shall perform in secret all acts connected with eating, the natural evacuations and dalliance with (his wife); business to be accomplished by speech or intellect, likewise austerities, wealth, and age, must be most carefully concealed.</p>  
 <p>10. And a man shall void both urine and fæces, facing the north, in the day-time, but at night he shall do it turning towards the south; for (if he acts) thus, his life will not be injured. <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11: The intellect of that man perishes who voids urine against a fire, the sun, a cow, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the moon, water, and the morning or evening twilights. <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Let him not void urine in a river, nor on a path, nor on ashes, nor on cowdung, nor on a ploughed field, nor on one which has been sown, nor on a grass-plot, nor in the shade (of trees) that afford protection (to travellers). <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. Standing in the shade (of houses, clouds, and so forth), when it is quite dark, and when he fears for his life, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a may void urine, by day and by night, in any position he pleases. <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. (Afterwards) he shall perform the necessary (purification) with water fetched for the purpose (from a tank or river, and with earth). <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. For a bath water not fetched for the purpose (may also be used). <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. (For the purpose of purification) a Brâhma<i>n</i>a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>shall take earth that is mixed with gravel, from the bank (of a river).</p>  
 <p>17. Five kinds of earth must not be used, viz. such as is covered by water, such as lies in a temple, on an ant-hill, on a hillock thrown up by rats, and that which has been left by one who cleaned himself.</p>  
 <p>18. The organ (must be cleaned by) one (application of) earth, the (right) hand by three, but both (feet) by two, the anus by five, the one (i.e. the left hand) by ten, and both (hands and feet) by seven (applications of earth). <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. Such is the purification ordained for house-holders; it is double for students, treble for hermits, but quadruple for ascetics. <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. Eight mouthfuls are the meal of an ascetic, sixteen that of a hermit, but thirty-two that of a householder, and an unlimited quantity that of a student. <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. An Agnihotrin, a draught-ox, and a student, those three can do their work only if they eat (well); without eating (much), they cannot do it.</p>  
 <p>22. (The above rule regarding limited allowances of food holds good) in the case of penances, of self-imposed restraint, of sacrifices, of the recitation of the Veda, and of (the performance of other) sacred duties. <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. The qualities by which a (true) Brâhma<i>n</i>a may be recognised are, the concentration of the mind, austerities, the subjugation of the senses, liberality, truthfulness, purity, sacred learning, compassion, worldly learning, intelligence, and the belief (in the existence of the deity and of a future life).</p>  
 <p>24. One may know that bearing grudges, envy, speaking untruths, speaking evil of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, backbiting, and cruelty are the characteristics of a <i>S</i>ûdra. <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. Those Brâhma<i>n</i>as can save (from evil) who are free from passion, and patient of austerities, whose ears have been filled with the texts of the Veda, who have subdued the organs of sensation and action, who have ceased to injure animated beings, and who close their hands when gifts are offered. <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. Some become worthy receptacles of gifts through sacred learning, and some through the practice of austerities. But that Brâhma<i>n</i>a whose stomach does not contain the food of a <i>S</i>ûdra, is even the worthiest receptacle of all. <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a dies with the food of a <i>S</i>ûdra in his stomach, he will become a village pig (in his next life) or be born, in the family of that (<i>S</i>ûdra).</p>  
 <p>28. For though a (Brâhma<i>n</i>a) whose body is nourished by the essence of a <i>S</i>ûdra's food may</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>daily recite the Veda, though he may offer (an Agnihotra) or mutter (prayers, nevertheless) he will not find the path that leads upwards.</p>  
 <p>29. But if, after eating the food of a <i>S</i>ûdra, he has conjugal intercourse, his sons will belong to the giver of the food, and he shall not ascend to heaven.</p>  
 <p>30. They declare that he is worthy to receive gifts, who (daily) rises to recite the Veda, who is of good family, and perfectly free from, passion, who constantly offers. sacrifices in the three sacred fires, who fears sin, and knows much, who is beloved among the females (of his family), who is righteous, protects cows, and reduces himself by austerities.</p>  
 <p>31. Just as milk, sour milk, clarified butter, and honey poured. into an unburnt earthen vessel, perish, owing to the weakness of the vessel, and neither the vessel nor those liquids (remain),</p>  
 <p>32. Even so a man destitute of sacred learning, who accepts cows or gold, clothes, a horse, land, (or) sesamum, becomes ashes, as (if he were dry) wood. <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">32</font></a></p>  
 <p>33. He shall not make his joints or his nails crack, <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. Nor shall he make a vessel ring with his nails.</p>  
 <p>35. Let him not drink water out of his joined hands. <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">35</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. Let him not strike the water with his foot or his hand,</p>  
 <p>37. Nor (pour) water into (other) water.</p>  
 <p>38. Let him not gather fruit by throwing brickbats,</p>  
 <p>39. Nor by throwing another fruit at it.</p>  
 <p>40. He shall not become a hypocrite or deceitful. <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">40</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>41. Let him not learn a language spoken by barbarians.</p>  
 <p>42. Now they quote' also (the following verses): 'The opinion of the <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>as is, that a man shall not be uselessly active, neither with his hands and his feet, nor with his eyes, nor with his tongues and his body.' <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">42</font></a></p>  
 <p>43. 'Those Brâhma<i>n</i>as, in whose families the study of the Veda and of its supplements is hereditary, and who are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts, must be known to be <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>as.' <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">43</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. 'He is a (true) Brâhma<i>n</i>a regarding whom no one knows if he be good or bad, if he be ignorant or deeply learned, if he be of good or of bad conduct.'</p>
