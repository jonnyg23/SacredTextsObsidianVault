 <p>1. Now we will explain the rule of the most holy Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_1356"></a><a href="#fn_1356"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. He goes to a bathing-place and bathes (there). Dressed in a pure dress let him raise, close to the water, an altar, and moistening his clothes by one (application of water), and filling his hand once (with water), let him recite the Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a hymn (in the manner of his daily) private recitation. <a name="fr_1357"></a><a href="#fn_1357"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. (Let him repeat it) one hundred times in the morning, one hundred times at midday, and one hundred times or an unlimited number of times in the afternoon.</p>  
 <p>4. When the stars have risen, let him partake of gruel prepared of one handful of barley.</p>  
 <p>5. After seven (days and) nights he is freed from all minor sins (upapâtaka), whether they have been committed intentionally or unintentionally, after twelve (days and) nights (from all other sins) excepting the murder of a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the violation of a Guru's bed, stealing gold, and drinking Surâ. <a name="fr_1358"></a><a href="#fn_1358"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. After twenty-one (days and) nights he over-comes even those (crimes) and conquers them.</p>

 <p>7. He overcomes everything, he conquers all, he obtains the reward of all sacrifices, he has bathed at all sacred bathing-places, he has performed the vows required for (the study of) all the Vedas, he becomes known to all the gods, he sanctifies a company (of Brâhma<i>n</i>as) by merely looking (at them), and his undertakings are successful. Thus speaks Baudhâyana. <a name="fr_1359"></a><a href="#fn_1359"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>
