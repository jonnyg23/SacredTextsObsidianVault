 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER II.</h3>  
 <p>1. There are four castes (var<i>n</i>a), Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, Vai<i>s</i>yas, and <i>S</i>ûdras. <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Three castes, Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<i>s</i>yas, (are called) twice-born.</p>  
 <p>3. Their first birth is from their mother; the second from the investiture with the sacred girdle. In that (second birth) the Sâvitrî is the mother, but the teacher is said to be the father. <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. They call the teacher father, because he gives instruction in the Veda. <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. They quote also (the following passage from the Veda) to the same (effect): 'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a man learned in the Vedas, that which (resides) above the navel and the other which below (the navel) descends down-wards. Through that which (resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced, when he initiates Brâhma<i>n</i>as, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer oblations, when he makes them holy. By that which resides below the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never say, to a <i>S</i>rotriya, who teaches the Veda, "Thud art destitute of offspring."' <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. Hârîta also quotes (the following verse): 'No religious rite can be performed by a (child) before he has been girt with the sacred girdle, since he is on a level with a <i>S</i>ûdra before his (new) birth from the Veda.' <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. (The above prohibition refers to all rites) except those connected with libations of water, (the exclamation) Svadhâ, and the manes. <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. Sacred learning approached a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (and said to him), 'Preserve me, I am thy treasure, reveal me not to a scorner, nor to a wicked man, nor to one of uncontrolled passions: so (preserved) I shall become strong.' <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. 'Reveal me, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a, as to the keeper of thy treasure, to him whom thou shalt know to be pure, attentive, intelligent, and chaste, who will not offend thee nor revile thee.'</p>  
 <p>10. '(That man) who fills his ears with truth, who frees him from pain and confers immortality upon him, (the pupil) shall consider as his father and mother; him he must never grieve nor revile.' <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. 'As those Brâhma<i>n</i>as who, after receiving instruction, do not honour their teacher by their speech, in their hearts or by their acts, will not be profitable to their teacher, even so that sacred learning (which they acquired) will not profit them.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. 'As fire consumes dry grass, even so the Veda, asked for, (but) not honoured, (destroys the enquirer). Let him not proclaim the Veda to that man, who does not show him honour according to his ability.'</p>  
 <p>13. The (lawful) occupations of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a are six, <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Studying the Veda, teaching, sacrificing for himself, sacrificing for. others, giving alms, and accepting gifts. <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. (The lawful occupations) of a Kshatriya are three,</p>  
 <p>16. Studying, sacrificing for himself, and bestowing gifts;</p>  
 <p>17. And his peculiar duty is to protect the people with his weapons; let him gain his livelihood thereby.</p>  
 <p>18. (The lawful occupations) of a Vai<i>s</i>ya are the same (as those mentioned above, Sûtra 16),</p>  
 <p>19. Besides, agriculture, trading, tending cattle, and lending money at interest,</p>  
 <p>20. To serve those (superior castes) has been fixed as the means of livelihood for a <i>S</i>ûdra. <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">20</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. (Men of) all (castes) may wear their hair arranged according to the customs fixed (for their family), or allow it to hang down excepting the lock on the crown of the head. <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. Those who are unable to live by their own lawful occupation may adopt (that of) the next inferior (caste), <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. But never (that of a) higher (caste).</p>  
 <p>24. (A Brâhma<i>n</i>a and a Kshatriya) who have re-sorted to a Vai<i>s</i>ya's mode of living, and maintain themselves by trade (shall not sell) stones, salt, hempen (cloth), silk, linen (cloth), and skins, <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. Nor any kind of dyed cloth,</p>  
 <p>26. Nor prepared food, flowers, fruit, roots, per-fumes, substances (used for) flavouring (food); nor water, the juice extracted from plants; nor Soma, weapons, poison; nor flesh, nor milk, nor preparations from it, iron, tin, lac, and lead, <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'By (selling) flesh, lac, and salt a Brâhma<i>n</i>a at once becomes an outcast; by selling milk he. becomes (equal to) a <i>S</i>ûdra after three days.' <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. Among tame animals those with uncloven hoofs, and those that have an abundance of hair, (must not be sold), nor any wild animals, (nor) birds, nor beasts that have tusks (or fangs).</p>  
 <p>29. Among the various kinds of grain they mention sesamum (as forbidden). <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. Now they quote also (the following verse): If he applies sesamum to any other purpose, but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will be born again as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged into his own ordure.' <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. Or, at pleasure, they may sell (sesamum), if they themselves have produced it by tillage. <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. For that purpose he shall plough before breakfast with two bulls whose noses have not been pierced.</p>  
 <p>33. (If he ploughs) in the hot season, he shall water (his beasts even in the morning).</p>  
 <p>34. The plough is attended by strong males, provided with a useful share and with a handle (to be held) by the drinker of Soma; that raises (for him) a cow, a sheep, a stout damsel, and a swift horse for the chariot. <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">34</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. The plough is attended by strong males, i.e. is attended by strong men and bullocks, provided with a useful share--for its share is useful (because) with the share it raises, i.e. pierces deep--and provided with a handle for the drinker of Soma,--for Soma reaches him,--possessing a handle for him. That raises a cow, a sheep, goats, horses, mules, donkeys and camels, and a stout damsel, i.e. a beautiful, useful maiden in the flower of her youth.</p>  
 <p>36. For how could the plough raise (anything for him) if he did not sell grain?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>37. Substances used for flavouring may be bartered for (other) substances of the same kind, be it for one more valuable or for one worth less. <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">37</font></a></p>  
 <p>38. But salt must never (be exchanged) for (other) substances-used for flavouring (food).</p>  
 <p>39. It is permitted to barter sesamum, rice, cooked food, learning, and slaves (each for its own kind and the one for the other).</p>  
 <p>40. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a and a Kshatriya shall not lend (anything at interest acting like) usurers. <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">40</font></a></p>  
 <p>41. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who acquiring property cheap, gives it for a high price, is called a usurer and blamed among those who recite the Veda.'</p>  
 <p>42. '(Brahman) weighed in the scales the crime of killing a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a against (the crime of) usury; the slayer of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a remained at the top, the usurer sank downwards.'</p>  
 <p>43. Or, at pleasure, they may lend to a person who entirely neglects his sacred duties, and is exceedingly wicked, <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">43</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. Gold (taking) double (its value on repayment, and) grain trebling (the original price). <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">44</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. (The case of) flavouring substances has been explained by (the rule regarding) grain,</p>  
 <p>46. As well as (the case of) flowers, roots, and fruit.</p>  
 <p>47. (They may lend) what is sold by weight, (taking) eight times (the original value on repayment). <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">47</font></a></p>  
 <p>48. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two in the hundred, three and four and five, as has teen declared in the Sm<i>ri</i>ti, he may take as interest by the month according to the order of the castes.' <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">48</font></a></p>  
 <p>49. 'But the king's death shall stop the interest on money (lent);' <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">49</font></a></p>  
 <p>50. 'And after the coronation of (a new) king the capital grows again.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>51. 'Hear the interest for a money-lender declared by the words of Vasish<i>th</i>a, five mash's for twenty (kârshâpa<i>n</i>as may be taken every month); thus the law is not violated.' <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">51</font></a></p>

The translation follows the explanation given in the next Sûtra as closely as possible, though the latter is without doubt erroneous. The purpose for which Vasish<i>th</i>a introduces it, is to show that a Vedic text permits agriculture to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who offers Soma-sacrifices.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_109"></a><a href="sbe1405.htm#fr_109">14:37</a>-39. Gautama VII, 16-21.</p>

B., vârdhushi<i>m</i> na dadyâtâm, and explains it by v<i>ri</i>ddhi<i>m</i> naiva prayo<i>g</i>ayetâm, 'they shall not take interest.' I read with the other MSS. vârdhushî, and translate that term by 'usurers.' Below, Sûtra 42, vârdhushi is used likewise in this its usual sense.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_111"></a><a href="sbe1405.htm#fr_111">14:43</a> Manu X, 117.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_112"></a><a href="sbe1405.htm#fr_112">14:44</a>-47. Vish<i>n</i>u VI, 11-17; Colebrooke I, Dig. LXVI, where 'silver and gems' have been added after gold, and rasâ<i>h</i>, 'flavouring substances,' been translated by 'fluids.' The translation differs also in other respects, because there the Sûtras stand by themselves, while here the nouns in Sûtras 44 and 47 are governed by the preceding dadyâtâm, 'they may lend.' They, i.e. a Brâhma<i>n</i>a <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a> and a Kshatriya. The rule, of course, refers to other castes also, and to those cases where no periodical interest is taken, but the loan returned in kind.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="sbe1405.htm#fr_113">15:47</a> The Ratnâkara quoted by Colebrooke loc. cit. takes 'what is sold by weight' to be 'camphor and the like.' K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita thinks that 'clarified butter, honey, spirituous liquor, oil, molasses, and salt' are meant. But most of these substances fall under the term rasâ<i>h</i>, 'flavouring substances.' The proper explanation of the words seems to be, 'any other substance not included among those mentioned previously, which is sold by weight.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_114"></a><a href="sbe1405.htm#fr_114">15:48</a> Vish<i>n</i>u VI, 2, and especially Manu VIII, 142. The lowest rate of interest is to be taken from the highest caste, and it becomes greater with decreasing respectability. According to K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita and the commentators on the parallel passage of Vish<i>n</i>u, Manu, and other Sm<i>ri</i>tis, this rule applies only to loans for which no security is given--a statement which is doubtlessly correct.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_115"></a><a href="sbe1405.htm#fr_115">15:49</a>-50. Both the reading and the sense of this verse, which in some MSS. is wanting, are somewhat doubtful. I read with my best MSS.,</p>  
 <p></p><dir>râ<i>g</i>â to m<i>ri</i>tabhâvena dravyav<i>ri</i>ddhi<i>m</i> vinâ<i>s</i>ayet |<br> punâ râ<i>g</i>âbhisheke<i>n</i>a dravyamûla<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a vardhate ||</dir>  
 <p>and consider that it gives a rule, ordering all money transactions to be stopped during the period which intervenes between the death of a king and the coronation of his successor. I am, however, unable to point out any parallel passages confirming this <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a> view. K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita's text shows two important various readings, 'bh<i>ri</i>tibhâvena' and 'râ<i>g</i>âbhîshikena,' which I think are merely conjectures, unsupported by the authority of MSS. He explains the verse as follows: 'The king shall destroy, i.e. himself not take, the interest on money by giving [it away] as a salary. But, after thus giving away interest received, he may increase his capital by [an extra tax imposed on] the cultivators, i.e. take from them the highest rate, consisting of one-fourth of the produce.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_116"></a><a href="sbe1405.htm#fr_116">16:51</a> Gautama XII, 29; Colebrooke I, Dig. XXIV. The rule given in this Sûtra refers, as K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita correctly states, to loans, for which security is given. The rate is 1¼ per cent for the month, or 15 per annum; see the note to Gautama loc. cit. Manu, VIII, 140, especially mentions that this rate is prescribed by Vasish<i>th</i>a.</p>
