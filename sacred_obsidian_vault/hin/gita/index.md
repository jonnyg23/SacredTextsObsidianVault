 <p>The Bhagavad Gita is technically part of
 <a href="../m06/index.htm">Book 6 of the Mahabharata</a>, although it is
 known to be a later accretion to the saga, which stands on its own merits.
 It is a dialog between the God Krishna and the hero Arjuna, 
 taking place in a timeless moment on the battlefield
 before the climactic struggle between good and evil.
 The Gita (which can be found in hotel bedstands throughout India)
 is a classic summary of the core beliefs of Hinduism.
 It has had a significant influence far beyond Hinduism.
 Robert Oppenheimer apocryphically recited
 the verse (from <a href="bg11.htm">Chapter 11</a>)
 'I [have become] Death, Destroyer of Worlds",
 just before the first test of the atom bomb,
 which ironically has a much different meaning in context.
