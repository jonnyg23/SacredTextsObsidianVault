 <p align="center">[<i>Enter, with a cloak in his hand, Maitreya</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>.</p>  
 <p>YOU must invite some other Brahman. I am busy." And yet I really ought to be seeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of affairs! When good Chārudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill of the most deliciously fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with the greatest of care. I would sit at the door of the courtyard, where I was surrounded by hundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his paint-boxes, I would simply touch them with my fingers and thrust them aside. I would stand chewing my cud like a bull in the city market. And now he is so poor that I have to run here, there, and everywhere, and come home, like the pigeons, only to roost. Now here is this jasmine-scented cloak, which Chārudatta's good friend Jūrnavriddha has sent him. He bade me give it to Chārudatta, as soon as he had finished his devotions. So now I will look for Chārudatta. [<i>He walks about and looks around him</i>.] Chārudatta has finished his devotions, and here he comes with an offering for the divinities of the house.</p>  
 <p>[<i>Enter Chārudatta as described, and Radanikā</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Looking up and sighing wearily</i>.]<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Upon my threshold, where the offering<br>   Was straightway seized by swans and flocking cranes,<br> The grass grows now, and these poor seeds I fling<br>   Fall where the mouth of worms their sweetness stains.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">9</font></span></div>  
 <p>[<i>He walks about very slowly and seats himself</i>.]</p>

 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Ah, it is my constant friend Maitreya. You are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Thank you. [<i>He seats himself</i>.] Well, comrade, here is a jasmine-scented cloak which your good friend Jūrnavriddha has sent. He bade me give it you as soon as you had finished your devotions. [<i>He presents the cloak. Chārudatta takes it and remains sunk in thought</i>.] Well, what are you thinking about?</p>

 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Comrade, I do not grieve for my ruined fortunes. But<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"> This is my sorrow. They whom I<br>  Would greet as guests, now pass me by.<br> "This is a poor man's house," they cry.

 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Oh, confound the money! It is a trifle not worth thinking about. It is like a cattle-boy in the woods afraid of wasps; it doesn't stay anywhere where it is used for food.</p>

 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. But just remember what a trifle money is, after all, and be more cheerful.</p>

 <p>Comrade, I have made my offering to the divinities of the house. Do you too go and offer sacrifice to the Divine Mothers at a place where four roads meet.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. No!</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Why not?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Because the gods are not gracious to you even when thus honored. So what is the use of worshiping?</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Not so, my friend, not so! This is the constant duty of a householder.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

 <p>Why then do you hesitate? Go and offer sacrifice to the Mothers.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. No, I'm not going. You must send somebody else. Anyway, everything seems to go wrong with me, poor Brahman that I am! It's like a reflection in a mirror; the right side becomes the left, and the left becomes the right. Besides, at this hour of the evening, people are abroad upon the king's highwaycourtezans, courtiers, servants, and royal favorites. They will take me now for fair prey, just as the black-snake out frog-hunting snaps up the mouse in his path. But what will you do sitting here?</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Good then, remain; and I will finish my devotions.</p>
