 <p><i>Beadle</i>.</p>  
 <p>THE magistrates said to me "Come, beadle, go to the courtroom, and make ready the seats." So now I am on my way to set the court-room in order. [<i>He walks about and looks around him</i>.] Here is the court-room. I will enter. [<i>He enters, sweeps, and puts a seat in its place</i>.] There! I have tidied up the court-room and put the seats in readiness, and now I will go and tell the magistrates. [<i>He walks about and looks around him</i>.] But see! Here comes that arrant knave, the king's brother-in-law. I will go away without attracting his attention. [<i>He stands apart. Enter Sansthānaka, in gorgeous raiment</i>.]</p>

 <p>And beshides, I've found a big hole, like a worm that has crawled into the knot of a lotush-root, and is looking for a hole to creep out at. Now who was I going to accuse of thish wicked deed? [<i>He recalls something</i>.] Oh, yesh! I remember. I was going to accuse poor Chārudatta of thish wicked deed. Beshides, he's poor. They'll believe anything about him. Good!

 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. And do men speak of defects in your virtue? If so, then they speak of darkness in the moonlight.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. My good beadle, conduct me to the court-room.</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. Follow me, Your Honor. [<i>They walk about</i>.] Here is the court-room. May the magistrates be pleased to enter. [<i>All enter</i>.] Judge. My good beadle, do you go outside and learn who desires to present a case.</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. Yes, sir. [<i>He goes out</i>.] Gentlemen, the magistrates ask if there is any here who desires to present a case.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. [<i>Gleefully</i>.] The magishtrates are here. [<i>He struts about</i>.] I desire to present a cashe, I, an arishtocrat, a man, a Vāsudeva, the royal brother-in-law, the brother-in-law of the king.</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. [<i>In alarm</i>.] Goodness! The king's brother-in-law is the first who desires to present a case. Well! Wait a moment, sir. I will inform the magistrates at once. [<i>He approaches the magistrates</i>.] Gentlemen, here is the king's brother-in-law who has come to court, desiring to present a case.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. What! the king's brother-in-law is the first who desires to present a case? Like an eclipse at sunrise, this betokens the ruin of some great man. Beadle, the court will doubtless be very busy to-day. Go forth, my good man, and say "Leave us for to-day. Your suit cannot be considered."</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. Yes, Your Honor. [<i>He goes out, and approaches Sansthānaka</i>.] Sir, the magistrates send word that you are to leave them for to-day; that your suit cannot be considered.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. [<i>Wrathfully</i>.] Confound it! Why can't my shuit be conshidered? If it isn't conshidered, then I'll tell my brother-in-law, King Pālaka, my shishter's husband, and I'll tell my shishter and my mother too, and I'll have thish judge removed, and another judge appointed. [<i>He starts to go away</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. Oh, sir! Brother-in-law of the king! Wait a moment. I will inform the magistrates at once. [<i>He returns to the judge</i>.] The brother-in-law of the king is angry, and says[<i>He repeats Sansthānaka's words</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. This fool might do anything. My good man, tell him to come hither, that his suit will be considered.</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. [<i>Approaching Sansthānaka</i>.] Sir, the magistrates send word that you are to come in, that your suit will be considered. Pray enter, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Firsht they shay it won't be conshidered, then they shay it will be conshidered. The magishtrates are sheared. Whatever I shay, I'll make em believe it. Good! I'll enter. [<i>He enters and approaches the magistrates</i>.] I am feeling very well, thank you. Whether you feel well or notthat depends on me.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] Well, well! We seem to have a highly cultivated plaintiff. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Pray be seated.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Well! Thish floor belongs to me. I'll sit down wherever I like. [<i>To the gild-warden</i>.] I'll sit here. [<i>To the beadle</i>.] Why shouldn't I sit here? [<i>He lays his hand on the judge's head</i>.] I'll sit here. [<i>He sits down on the floor</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. You desire to present a case?</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Of courshe.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. Then state the case.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. I'll whishper it. I was born in the great family of a man as glorioush as a wine-glass.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

 <p>State your case.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. I will, but even if I was guilty, he wouldn't do anything to me. Well, my shishter's husband liked me, and gave me the besht garden there is, the old garden Pushpakaranda, to play in and look after. And there I go every day to look at it, to keep it dry, to keep it clean, to keep it blosshoming, to keep it trimmed. But fate decreed that I shawor rather, I didn't shee the proshtrate body of a woman.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. Do you know who the unfortunate woman was?</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Hello, magishtrates! Why shouldn't I know? A woman like that! the pearl of the city! adorned with a hundred golden ornaments! Shombody's unworthy shon enticed her into the old garden Pushpakaranda when it was empty, and for a mere triflefor her money!shtrangled Vasantasenā and killed her. But I didn't[<i>He breaks off, and puts his hand over his mouth</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. What carelessness on the part of the city police! Gild-warden and clerk, write down the words "I didn't," as the first article in the case.</p>  
 <p><i>Clerk</i>. Yes, sir. [<i>He does so</i>.] Sir, it is written.</p>  
 <p align="justify'"><i>Sansthānaka</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] Goodnessh! Now I've ruined myshelf, like a man that shwallows a cake of rice and milk in a hurry. Well, I'll get out of it thish way. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Well, well, magishtrates! I was jusht remarking that I didn't shee it happen. What are you making thish hullabaloo about? [<i>He wipes out the written words with his foot</i>.]</p>  
 <p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. How do you know that she was strangledand for her money?</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Hello! Why shouldn't I think sho, when her neck was shwollen and bare, and the places where you wear jewels didn't have any gold on them?</p>  
 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. That seems plausible.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] Thank heaven! I breathe again. Hooray!</p>  
 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. Upon whom does the conduct of this case depend?</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. The case has a twofold aspect.</p>  
 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. How so?</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. We have to consider the allegations, then the facts. Now the investigation of the allegations depends upon plaintiff and defendant. But the investigation of the facts must be carried out by the wisdom of the judge.</p>  
 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. Then the conduct of the case depends upon the presence of Vasantasenā's mother?</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. Precisely. My good beadle, summon Vasantasenā's mother, without, however, giving her cause for anxiety.</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. Yes, Your Honor. [<i>He goes out, and returns with the mother of the courtezan</i>.] Follow me, madam.</p>  
 <p><i>Mother</i>. My daughter went to the house of a friend to enjoy her youth. But now comes this gentlemanlong life to him!and says "Come! The judge summons you." I find myself quite bewildered. My heart is palpitating. Sir, will you conduct me to the court-room?</p>  
 <p><i>Beadle</i>. Follow me, madam. [<i>They walk about</i>.] Here is the courtroom. Pray enter, madam. [<i>They enter</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Mother</i>. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Happiness be yours, most worthy gentlemen.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. My good woman, you are very welcome. Pray be seated.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Mother</i>. Thank you. [<i>She seats herself</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. [<i>Abusively</i>.] You're here, are you, you old bawd?</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. Tell me. Are you Vasantasenā's mother?</p>  
 <p><i>Mother</i>. I am.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. Whither has Vasantasenā gone at this moment?</p>  
 <p><i>Mother</i>. To the house of a friend.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. What is the name of her friend?</p>  
 <p><i>Mother</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] Dear me! Really, this is very embarrassing. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Any one else might ask me this, but not a judge.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. Pray do not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts the question.</p>  
 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. The conduct of the case puts the question. You incur no fault. Speak.</p>  
 <p><i>Mother</i>. What! the conduct of the case? If that is so, then listen, worthy gentlemen. There lives in the merchants quarter the grandson of the merchant Vinayadatta, the son of Sāgaradatta, a man whose name is a good omen in itselfthat name is Chārudatta. In his house my daughter enjoys her youth.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Did you hear that? Write those words down. My contention is with Chārudatta.</p>  
 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. It is no sin for Chārudatta to be her friend.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. The conduct of this case demands the presence of Chārudatta.</p>  
 <p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk</i>. Exactly.</p>  
 <p><i>Judge</i>. Dhanadatta, write as the first article in the case "Vasantasenā went to the house of Chārudatta." But must we summon the worthy Chārudatta also? No, the conduct of the case summons him. Go, my good beadle, summon Chārudatta,but gently, without haste, without giving him cause for anxiety, respectfully, as it were incidentally,with the words "The judge wishes to see you."</p>
