 <p><i>Maitreya</i>.</p>  
 <p>HOW beautiful the old garden Pushpakaranda is.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. You are quite right, my friend. For see!<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The trees, like merchants, show their wares;<br> Each several tree his blossoms bears,<br> While bees, like officers, are flitting,<br> To take from each what toll is fitting.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1</font></span></div>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. This simple stone is very attractive. Pray be seated.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Seats himself</i>.] How Vardhamānaka lingers, my friend!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. I told Vardhamānaka to bring Vasantasenā and come as quickly as he could.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Why then does he linger?<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Is he delayed by some slow-moving load?<br>   Has he returned with broken wheel or traces?<br> Obstructions bid him seek another road?<br>   His bullocks, or himself, choose these slow paces?<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">2</font></span></div>  
 <p>[<i>Enter Vardhamānaka with the bullock-cart, in which Aryaka lies hidden</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. Get up, bullocks, get up!</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.]<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">And still I fear the spies that serve the king;<br> Escape is even yet a doubtful thing,<br> While to my foot these cursèd fetters cling.<!-- paragraph continues -->  
 <p>Some good man tis, within whose cart I lie,<br> Like cuckoo chicks, whose heartless mothers fly,<br> And crows must rear the fledglings, or they die.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">3</font></span><!-- paragraph continues --></p></div>  
 <p>I have come a long distance from the city. Shall I get out of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>cart and seek a hiding-place in the grove? or shall I wait to see the owner of the cart? On second thoughts, I will not hide myself in the grove; for men say that the noble Chārudatta is ever helpful to them that seek his protection. I will not go until I have seen him face to face.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Twill bring contentment to that good man's heart<br> To see me rescued from misfortune's sea.<br> This body, in its suffering, pain, and smart,<br> Is saved through his sweet magnanimity.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">4</font></span></div>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. Here is the garden. I'll drive in. [<i>He does so</i>.] Maitreya!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Good news, my friend. It is Vardhamānaka's voice. Vasantasenā must have come.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Good news, indeed.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. You son of a slave, what makes you so late?</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. Don't get angry, good Maitreya. I remembered that I had forgotten the cushion, and I had to go back for it, and that is why I am late.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Turn the cart around, Vardhamānaka. Maitreya, my friend, help Vasantasenā to get out.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Has she got fetters on her feet, so that she can't get out by herself? [<i>He rises and lifts the curtain of the cart</i>.] Why, this isn't mistress Vasantasenāthis is Mister Vasantasena.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. A truce to your jests, my friend. Love cannot wait. I will help her to get out myself. [<i>He rises</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. [<i>Discovers him</i>.] Ah, the owner of the bullock-cart! He is attractive not only to the ears of men, but also to their eyes. Thank heaven! I am safe.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Enters the bullock-cart and discovers Aryaka</i>.] Who then is this?<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">As trunk of elephant his arms are long,<br> His chest is full, his shoulders broad and strong, <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a><br>   His great eyes restless-red; <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Why should this man be thus enforced to fight<br> So noble hewith such ignoble plight,<br>   His foot to fetters wed?<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">5</font></span><!-- paragraph continues --></div>  
 <p>Who are you, sir?</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. I am one who seeks your protection, Aryaka, by birth a herdsman.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Are you he whom King Pālaka took from the hamlet where he lived and thrust into prison?</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. The same.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Tis fate that brings you to my sight;<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">May I be reft of heaven's light,<br> Ere I desert you in your hapless plight.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">6</font></span></div>  
 <p>[<i>Aryaka manifests his joy</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Vardhamānaka, remove the fetters from his foot.</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. Yes, sir. [<i>He does so</i>.] Master, the fetters are removed.</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. But you have bound me with yet stronger fetters of love.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Now you may put on the fetters yourself. He is free anyway. And it's time for us to be going.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Peace! For shame!</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. Chārudatta, my friend, I entered your cart somewhat unceremoniously. I beg your pardon.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. I feel honored that you should use no ceremony with me.</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. If you permit it, I now desire to go.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Go in peace.</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. Thank you. I will alight from the cart.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. No, my friend. The fetters have but this moment been removed, and you will find walking difficult. In this spot</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>where men seek pleasure, a bullock-cart will excite no suspicion. Continue your journey then in the cart.</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. I thank you, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārud</i>. Seek now thy kinsmen. Happiness be thine!</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. Ah, I have found thee, blessèd kinsman mine!</p>  
 <p><i>Chārud</i>. Remember me, when thou hast cause to speak.</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. Thy name, and not mine own, my words shall seek.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārud</i>. May the immortal gods protect thy ways!</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. Thou didst protect me, in most perilous days.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārud</i>. Nay, it was fate that sweet protection lent.</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. But thou wast chosen as fate's instrument.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">7</font></span></p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. King Pālaka is aroused, and protection will prove difficult. You must depart at once.</p>  
 <p><i>Aryaka</i>. Until we meet again, farewell.</p>
