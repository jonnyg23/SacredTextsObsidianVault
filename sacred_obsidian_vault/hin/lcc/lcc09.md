 <p>It is some time since Chārudatta went to the concert. It is past midnight, and still he does not come. I think I will go into the outer hall and take a nap. [<i>He does so</i>.]</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center">[<i>Enter Chārudatta and Maitreya</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. How beautifully Rebhila sang! The lute is indeed a pearl, a pearl not of the ocean.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Well then, let's go into the house.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. But how wonderfully Master Rebhila sang!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. There are just two things that always make me laugh. One is a woman talking Sanskrit, and the other is a man who tries to sing soft and low. Now when a woman talks Sanskrit, she is like a heifer with a new rope through her nose; all you hear is "soo, soo, soo." And when a man tries to sing soft and low, he reminds me of an old priest muttering texts, while the flowers in his chaplet dry up. No, I don't like it!</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. My friend, Master Rebhila sang most wonderfully this evening. And still you are not satisfied.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The notes of love, peace, sweetness, could I trace,<br>   The note that thrills, the note of passion too,<br> The note of woman's loveliness and grace<br>   Ah, my poor words add nothing, nothing new!<br> But as the notes in sweetest cadence rang,<br> I thought it was my hidden love who sang.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">4</font></span>  
 <p>The melody of song, the stricken strings<br> In undertone that half-unconscious clings,<br> More clearly sounding when the passions rise,<br> But ever sweeter as the music dies.<br> Words that strong passion fain would say again,<br> Yet checks their second utterancein vain;<br> For music sweet as this lives on, until<br> I walk as hearing sweetest music still.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">5</font></span></p></div>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. But see, my friend! The very dogs are sound asleep in the shops that look out on the market. Let us go home. [<i>He looks before him</i>.] Look, look! The blessèd moon seems to give place to darkness, as she descends from her palace in heaven.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. True.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The moon gives place to darkness as she dips<br> Behind the western mountain; and the tips<br> Of her uplifted horns alone appear,<br> Like two sharp-pointed tusks uplifted clear, <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a><br> Where bathes an elephant in waters cool,<br> Who shows naught else above the jungle pool.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">6</font></span></div>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Well, here is our house. Vardhamānaka, Vardhamānaka, open the door!</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. I hear Maitreya's voice. Chārudatta has returned. I must open the door for him. [<i>He does so</i>.] Master, I salute you. Maitreya, I salute you too. The couch is ready. Pray be seated.</p>  
 <p>[<i>Chārudatta and Maitreya enter and seat themselves</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Vardhamānaka, call Radanikā to wash our feet.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Compassionately</i>.] She sleeps. Do not wake her.</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. I will bring the water, Maitreya, and you may wash Chārudatta's feet.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Angrily</i>.] Look, man. He acts like the son of a slave that he is, for he is bringing water. But he makes me wash your feet, and I am a Brahman.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Good Maitreya, do you bring the water, and Vardhamānaka shall wash my feet.</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. Yes, Maitreya. Do you bring the water. [<i>Maitreya does so. Vardhamānaka washes Chārudatta's feet, then moves away</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Let water be brought for the Brahman's feet.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. What good does water do my feet? I shall have to roll in the dirt again, like a beaten ass.</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. Maitreya, you are a Brahman.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Yes, like a slow-worm among all the other snakes, so am I a Brahman among all the other Brahmans.</p>  
 <p><i>Vardhamānaka</i>. Maitreya, I will wash your feet after all. [<i>He does so</i>.] Maitreya, this golden casket I was to keep by day, you by night. Take it.</p>  
 <p>[<i>He gives it to Maitreya, then exit</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Receiving the casket</i>.] The thing is here still. Isn't there a single thief in Ujjayinī to steal the wretch that robs me of my sleep? Listen. I am going to take it into the inner court.</p>

 <p>[<i>He nods, repeating the stanza</i> "The melody of song, the stricken strings:" <i>page</i> <a href="#page_44">44</a>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Are you going to sleep?</p>

 <p>I made a breach in the orchard wall and entered. And now I must force my way into the inner court as well.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Yes, let men call it vulgar, if they will,<br>   The trade that thrives while sleeps the sleepyhead;<br> Yes, knavery, not bravery, call it still,<br>   To overreach confiding folk a-bed. <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a><br> Far better blame and hissing, fairly won,<br>   Than the pay of genuflecting underlings;<br> This antique path was trod by Drona's son,<br>   Who slew the sleeping, unsuspecting kings.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">11</font></span><!-- paragraph continues --></div>

 <p>[<i>He feels the wall</i>.] Here is a spot weakened by constant sun and sprinkling and eaten by saltpeter rot. And here is a pile of dirt thrown up by a mouse. Now heaven be praised! My venture prospers. This is the first sign of success for Skanda's <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">1</font></a> sons. Now first of all, how shall I make the breach? The blessed Bearer of the Golden Lance <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">2</font></a> has prescribed four varieties of breach, thus: if the bricks are baked, pull them out; if they are unbaked, cut them; if they are made of earth, wet them; if they are made of wood, split them. Here we have baked bricks; ergo, pull out the bricks.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Now what shall be the shape I give the breach?<br> A "lotus," "cistern," "crescent moon," or "sun"?<br> "Oblong," or "cross," or "bulging pot"? for each<br> The treatises permit.

 <p>In this wall of baked bricks, the "bulging pot" would be effective. I will make that.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

[<i>He puts his back against the door and opens it cautiously</i>.] Good! So much for that. Now I must discover whether these two are feigning sleep, or whether they are asleep in the fullest meaning of the term.

 <p>[<i>He looks about him</i>.] What! a drum? And here is a flute. And here, a snare-drum. And here, a lute. And reed-pipes. And yonder, manuscripts. Is this the house of a dancing-master? But no! When I entered, I was convinced that this was a palatial residence. Now then, is this man poor in the fullest meaning of the term, or, from fear of the king or of thieves, does he keep his property buried? Well, my own property is buried, too. But I will scatter the seeds that betray subterranean gold. [<i>He does so</i>.] The scattered seeds nowhere swell up. Ah, he is poor in the fullest meaning of the term. Good! I go.</p>  
 <p>Maitreya. [<i>Talking in his sleep</i>.] Look, man. I see something like</p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>a hole in the wall. I see something like a thief. You had better take this golden casket.</p>  
 <p><i>Sharvilaka</i>. I wonder if the man has discovered that I have entered, and is showing off his poverty in order to make fun of me. Shall I kill him, or is the poor devil talking in his sleep? [<i>He takes a look</i>.] But see! This thing wrapped in a ragged bath-clout, now that I inspect it by the light of my candle, is in truth a jewel-casket. Suppose I take it. But no! It is hardly proper to rob a man of good birth, who is as poor as I am. I go.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. My friend, by the wishes of cows and Brahmans <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">1</font></a> I conjure you to take this golden casket.</p>  
 <p><i>Sharvilaka</i>. One may not disregard the sacred wish of a cow and the wish of a Brahman. I will take it. But look! There burns the candle. I keep about me a moth for the express purpose of extinguishing candles. I will let him enter the flame. This is his place and hour. May this moth which I here release, depart to flutter above the flame in varying circles. The breeze from the insect's wings has translated the flame into accursèd darkness. Or shall I not rather curse the darkness brought by me upon my Brahmanic family? For my father was a man who knew the four Vedas, who would not accept a gift; and I, Sharvilaka, his son, and a Brahman, I am committing a crime for the sake of that courtezan girl Madanikā. Now I will grant the Brahman's wish. [<i>He reaches out for the casket</i>.]</p>  
 <p>Maitreya. How cold your fingers are, man!</p>  
 <p><i>Sharvilaka</i>. What carelessness! My fingers are cold from touching water. Well, I will put my hand in my armpit. [<i>He warms his left hand and takes the casket</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Have you got it?</p>  
 <p><i>Sharvilaka</i>. I could not refuse a Brahman's request. I have it.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Now I shall sleep as peacefully as a merchant who has sold his wares.</p>  
 <p><i>Sharvilaka</i>. O great Brahman, sleep a hundred years! Alas that a Brahman family should thus be plunged in darkness for the sake of Madanikā, a courtezan! Or better, I myself am thus plunged in darkness.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

 <p>Well then, I must go to Vasantasenā's house to buy Madanikā's freedom. [<i>He walks about and looks around him</i>.] Ah, I think I hear footsteps. I hope they are not those of policemen.

 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. My friend, this hole must have been made by one of two men; either by a stranger, or else for practice by a student of the science of robbery. For what man here in Ujjayinī does not know how much wealth there is in our house?</p>

 <p>Just think of the poor fellow telling his friends: "I entered the house of a merchant's son, and foundnothing."</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Do you mean to say that you pity the rascally robber? Thinks he"Here's a great house. Here's the place to carry off a jewel-casket or a gold-casket." [<i>He remembers the casket. Despondently. Aside</i>.] Where is that golden casket? [<i>He remembers the events of the night. Aloud</i>.] Look, man! You are always saying "Maitreya is a fool, Maitreya is no scholar." But I certainly acted wisely in handing over that golden casket to you.

 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. A truce to your jests!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Just because I'm a fool, do you suppose I don't even know the place and time for a jest?</p>

 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Yes.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. What is the pleasant news, then?</p>

 <p><i>Radanikā</i>. I will go and tell his good wife. [<i>She goes out, returning with Chārudatta's wife</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Wife</i>. [<i>Anxiously</i>.] Oh! Is it true that my lord is uninjured, and Maitreya too?</p>  
 <p><i>Radanikā</i>. It is true, mistress. But the gems which belong to the courtezan have been stolen. [<i>Chārudatta's wife swoons</i>.] O my good mistress! Come to yourself!</p>  
 <p><i>Wife</i>. [<i>Recovering</i>.] Girl, how can you say that my lord is uninjured? Better that he were injured in body than in character. For now the people of Ujjayinī will say that my lord committed this crime because of his poverty. [<i>She looks up and sighs</i>.] Ah, mighty Fate! The destinies of the poor, uncertain as the water-drops which fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to thee but playthings. There remains to me this one necklace, which I brought with me from my mother's house. But my lord would be too proud to accept it. Girl, call Maitreya hither.</p>

 <p><i>Radanikā</i>. Yes, mistress. [<i>She approaches Maitreya</i>.] Maitreya, my lady summons you.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Where is she?</p>  
 <p><i>Radanikā</i>. Here. Come!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Heaven bless you!</p>  
 <p><i>Wife</i>. I salute you, sir. Sir, will you look straight in front of you?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Madam, here stands a man who looks straight in front of him.</p>  
 <p><i>Wife</i>. Sir, you must accept this.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Why?</p>  
 <p><i>Wife</i>. I have observed the Ceremony of the Gems. And on this occasion one must make as great a present as one may to a Brahman. This I have not done, therefore pray accept this necklace.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Receiving the necklace</i>.] Heaven bless you! I will go and tell my friend.</p>  
 <p><i>Wife</i>. You must not do it in such a way as to make me blush,</p>

 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>In astonishment</i>.] What generosity!</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. How Maitreya lingers! I trust his grief is not leading him to do what he ought not. Maitreya, Maitreya!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Here I am. Take that. [<i>He displays the necklace</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. What is this?</p>

 <p><i>Maitreya</i>, take the necklace and go to Vasantasenā. Tell her in my name that we have gambled away the golden casket, forgetting that it was not our own; that we trust she will accept this necklace in its place.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. But you must not give away this necklace, the pride of the four seas, for that cheap thing that was stolen before we had a bite or a drink out of it.</p>
