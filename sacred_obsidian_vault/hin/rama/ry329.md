 <h3 align="CENTER">CANTO LVI: </h3>
 <p>
 These Vánar hosts with one accord<br>
 Will quit thee for their lawful lord,<br>
 And turn again with thirsty eyes<br>
 To wife and babe and all they prize.<br>
 Thou in the lonely cavern left<br>
 Of followers and friends bereft,<br>
 Wilt be in all thy woe, alas,<br>
 Weak as a blade of trembling grass:<br>
 And Lakshman's arrows, keen and fierce<br>
 From his strong bow, thy heart will pierce.<br>
 But if in lowly reverence meek<br>
 Sugríva's court with us thou seek,<br>
 He, as thy birth demands, will share<br>
 The kingdom with the royal heir.<br>
 Thy loving kinsman, true and wise,<br>
 Looks on thee still with favouring eyes.<br>
 Firm in his promise, pure is he,<br>
 And ne'er will vex or injure thee.<br>
 He loves thy mother, lives for her<br>
 A faithful friend and worshipper.<br>
 That mother's love thou mayst not spurn:<br>
 Her only child, return, return.'<br>
