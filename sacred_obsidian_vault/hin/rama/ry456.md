 <h3 align="CENTER">CANTO LX.: KUMBHAKARN'A ROUSED.</h3>
 <p>
 With humbled heart and broken pride<br>
 Through Lánka's gate the giant hied,<br>
 Crushed, like an elephant beneath<br>
 A lion's spring and murderous teeth,<br>
 Or like a serpent neath the wing<br>
 And talons of the Feathered King.<br>
 Such was the giant's wild alarm<br>
 At arrows shot by Ráma's arm;<br>
 Shafts with red lightning round them curled,<br>
 Like Brahmá's bolts that end the world.<br>
     Supported on his golden throne,<br>
 With failing eye and humbled tone,<br>
 'Giants,' he cried, 'the toil is vain,<br>
 Fruitless the penance and the pain,<br>
 If I whom Indra owned his peer,<br>
 Secure from Gods, a mortal fear.<br>
 My soul remembers, now too late,<br>
 Lord Brahmá's words which spoke my fate:<br>
 'Tremble, proud Giant,' thus they ran,<br>
 'And dread thy death from slighted man.<br>
 Secure from Gods and demons live,<br>
 And serpents, by the boon I give.<br>
 Against their power thy life is charmed,<br>
 But against man is still unarmed,'<br>
 This Ráma is the man foretold<br>
 By Anaranra's  <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">1</font></a> lips of old:<br>
     'Fear, Rávan', basest of the base:<br>
 For of mine own imperial race<br>
 A prince in after time shall spring<br>
 And thee and thine to ruin bring.<br>
 And Vedavatí,  <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">2</font></a> ere she died<br>
 Slain by my ruthless insult, cried:<br>
 
 </p><p>
 
 </p><p>
 
 </p><p>
 <a name="page_473"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 473</font></a><br>
 
 </p><p>
 'A scion of my royal line<br>
 Shall slay, vile wretch, both thee and thine.'<br>
 She in a later birth became<br>
 King Janak's child, now Ráma's dame.<br>
 Nandis'vara  <a name="fr_984"></a><a href="#fn_984"><font size="1">1</font></a> foretold this fate,<br>
 And Umá  <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">2</font></a> when I moved her hate,<br>
 And Rambhá,  <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">3</font></a> and the lovely child<br>
 Of Varun  <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">4</font></a> by thy touch defiled.<br>
 I know the fated hour is nigh:<br>
 Hence, captains, to your stations fly.<br>
 Let warders on the rampart stand:<br>
 Place at each gate a watchful band;<br>
 And, terror of immortal eyes,<br>
 Let mightiest Kumbhakarna rise.<br>
 He, slumbering, free from care and pain,<br>
 By Brahmá's curse, for months has lain.<br>
 But when Prahasta's death he hears,<br>
 Mine own defeat and doubts and fears,<br>
 The chief will rise to smite the foe<br>
 And his unrivalled valour show.<br>
 Then Raghu's royal sons and all<br>
 The Vánars neath his might will fall.'<br>
     The giant lords his hest obeyed,<br>
 They left him, trembling and afraid,<br>
 And from the royal palace strode<br>
 To Kumbhakarna's vast abode.<br>
 They carried garlands sweet and fresh,<br>
 And reeking loads of blood and flesh.<br>
 They reached the dwelling where he lay,<br>
 A cave that stretched a league each way,<br>
 Sweet with fair blooms of lovely scent<br>
 And bright with golden ornament.<br>
 His breathings came so fierce and fast.<br>
 Scarce could the giants brook the blast.<br>
 They found him on a golden bed<br>
 With his huge limbs at length outspread.<br>
 
 </p><p>
 
 </p><p>
 
 </p><p>
 
 </p><p>
 
 </p><p>
 They piled their heaps of venison near,<br>
 Fat buffaloes and boars and deer.<br>
 With wreaths of flowers they fanned his face,<br>
 And incense sweetened all the place.<br>
 Each raised his mighty voice as loud<br>
 As thunders of an angry cloud,<br>
 And conchs their stirring summons gave<br>
 That echoed through the giant's cave.<br>
 Then on his breast they rained their blows.<br>
 And high the wild commotion rose<br>
 When cymbal vied with drum and horn.<br>
 And war cries on the gale upborne<br>
 Through all the air loud discord spread,<br>
 And, struck with fear, the birds fell dead.<br>
 But still he slept and took his rest.<br>
 Then dashed they on his shaggy chest<br>
 Clubs, maces, fragments of the rock:<br>
 He moved not once, nor felt the shock.<br>
 The giants made one effort more<br>
 With shell and drum and shout and roar.<br>
 Club, mallet, mace, in fury plied,<br>
 Rained blows upon his breast and side,<br>
 And elephants were urged to aid,<br>
 And camels groaned and horses neighed.<br>
 They drenched him with a hundred pails,<br>
 They tore his ears with teeth and nails.<br>
 They bound together many a mace<br>
 And beat him on the head and face;<br>
 And elephants with ponderous tread<br>
 Stamped on his limbs and chest and head.<br>
 The unusual weight his slumber broke:<br>
 He started, shook his sides, and woke;<br>
 And, heedless of the wounds and blows,<br>
 Yawning with thirst and hunger rose.<br>
 His jaws like hell gaped fierce and wide,<br>
 Dire as the flame neath ocean's tide.<br>
 Red as the sun on Meru's crest<br>
 The giant's face his wrath expressed,<br>
 And every burning breath he drew<br>
 Was like the blast that rushes through<br>
 The mountain cedars. Up he raised<br>
 His awful head with eyes that blazed<br>
 Like comets, dire as Death in form<br>
 Who threats the worlds with fire and storm.<br>
 The giants pointed to their stores<br>
 Of buffaloes and deer and boars,<br>
 And straight he gorged him with a flood<br>
 Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.<br>
 He ceased: the giants ventured near<br>
 And bent their lowly heads in fear.<br>
 Then Kumbhakarna glared with eyes<br>
 Still heavy in their first surprise,<br>
 Still drowsy from his troubled rest,<br>
 And thus the giant band addressed.<br>
 'How have ye dared my sleep to break?<br>
 No trifling cause should bid me wake.<br>
 Say, is all well? or tell the need<br>
 That drives you with unruly speed<br>
 To wake me. Mark the words I say,<br>
 The king shall tremble in dismay,<br>
 
 </p><p>
 <a name="page_474"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 474</font></a><br>
 
 </p><p>
 The fire be quenched and Indra slain<br>
 Ere ye shall break my rest in vain.'<br>
     Yupáksha answered: 'Chieftain, hear;<br>
 No God or fiend excites our fear.<br>
 But men in arms our walls assail:<br>
 We tremble lest their might prevail.<br>
 For vengeful Ráma vows to slay<br>
 The foe who stole his queen away,<br>
 And, matchless for his warlike deeds,<br>
 A host of mighty Vánars leads.<br>
 Ere now a monstrous Vánar came.<br>
 Laid Lanká waste with ruthless flame,<br>
 And Aksha, Rávan's offspring, blew<br>
 With all his warrior retinue.<br>
 Our king who never trembled yet<br>
 For heavenly hosts in battle met.<br>
 At length the general dread has shared,<br>
 O'erthrown by Ráma's arm and spared.'<br>
     He ceased: and Kumbhakarna spake:<br>
 'I will go forth and vengeance take;<br>
 Will tread their hosts beneath my feet,<br>
 Then triumph-flushed our king will meet.<br>
 Our giant bands shall eat their fill<br>
 Of Vánars whom this arm shall kill.<br>
 The princes' blood shall be my draught,<br>
 The chieftains' shall by you be quaffed.'<br>
 He spake, and, with an eager stride<br>
 That shook the earth, to Rávan hied,<br>
