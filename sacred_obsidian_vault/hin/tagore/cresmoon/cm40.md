 <h3 align="CENTER">MY SONG</h3>
 <p>This song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like the fond arms of love.</p>
 <p>This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of blessing.</p>
 <p>When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in your ear, when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with aloofness.</p>
 <p>My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will transport your heart to the verge of the unknown.</p>
 <p>It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is over your road.</p>
 <p>My song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry your sight into the heart of things.</p>
 <p>And when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in your living heart.</p>
