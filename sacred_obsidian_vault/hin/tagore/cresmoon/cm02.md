 <p>Ah, these jasmines<br>
 Ah, who was it coloured that little frock<br>
 Bless this little heart<br>
 Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust<br>
 Come and hire me<br>
 Day by day I float my paper boats<br>
 I am small because I am a little child<br>
 If baby only wanted to, he could fly<br>
 If I were only a little puppy<br>
 If people came to know where my king's palace is<br>
 I long to go over there<br>
 Imagine, mother<br>
 I only said, "When in the evening"<br>
 I paced alone<br>
 It is time for me to go, mother<br>
 I want to give you something, my child<br>
 I wish I could take a quiet corner<br>
 Mother, I do want to leave off my lessons<br>
 Mother, let us imagine we are travelling<br>
 Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds<br>
 Mother, the light has grown grey<br>
 Mother, your baby is silly<br>
 On the seashore of endless worlds<br>
 O you shaggy-headed banyan tree<br>
 Say of him what you please<br>
 Sullen clouds are gathering<br>
 Supposing I became a <i>champa</i> flower<br>
 The boat of the boatman Madhu<br>
 The night was dark when we went away<br>
 The sleep that flits on baby's eyes<br>
 They clamour and fight<br>
 This song of mine<br>
 When I bring you coloured toys<br>
 When storm clouds<br>
 When the gong sounds ten<br>
 Where have I come from<br>
 Who stole sleep from baby's eyes<br>
 Why are those tears in your eyes, my child<br>
 Why do you sit there on the floor<br>
 You say that father writes a lot of books</p>
