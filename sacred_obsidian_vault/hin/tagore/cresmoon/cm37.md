 <h3 align="CENTER">THE BANYAN TREE</h3>
 <p>O you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond, have you forgotten the little child, like the birds that have nested in your branches and left you?</p>
 <p>Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at the tangle of your roots that plunged underground?</p>
 <p>The women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling to wake up.</p>
 <p>Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles weaving golden tapestry.</p>
 <p>Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and the child would sit still and think.</p>
 <p>He longed to be the wind and blow through your rustling branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water, to be a bird and perch on your top-most twig, and to float like those ducks among the weeds and shadows.</p>
