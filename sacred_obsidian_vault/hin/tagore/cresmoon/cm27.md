 <h3 align="CENTER">VOCATION</h3>
 <p>When the gong sounds ten in the morning and I walk to school by our lane,</p>
 <p>Every day I meet the hawker crying, "Bangles, crystal bangles!"</p>
 <p>There is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home.</p>
 <p>I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying, "Bangles, crystal bangles!"</p>
 <p>When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school,</p>
 <p>I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging the ground.</p>
 <p>He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or gets wet.</p>
 <p>I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with nobody to stop me from digging.</p>
 <p>Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to bed,</p>
 <p>I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and down.</p>
 <p>The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like a giant with one red eye in its head.</p>
 <p>The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at his side, and never once goes to bed in his life.</p>
 <p>I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night, chasing the shadows with my lantern.</p>
