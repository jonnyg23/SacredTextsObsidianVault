 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SAILOR</h3>
 <p>The boat of the boatman Madhu is moored at the wharf of Rajgunj.</p>
 <p>It is uselessly laden with jute, and has been lying there idle for ever so long.</p>
 <p>If he would only lend me his boat, I should man her with a hundred oars, and hoist sails, five or six or seven.</p>
 <p>I should never steer her to stupid markets. I should sail the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.</p>
 <p>But, mother, you won't weep for me in a corner.</p>
 <p>I am not going into the forest like Ramachandra to come back only after fourteen years.</p>
 <p>I shall become the prince of the story, and fill my boat with whatever I like.</p>
 <p>I shall take my friend Ashu with me. We shall sail merrily across the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.</p>
 <p>We shall set sail in the early morning light.</p>
 <p>When at noontide you are bathing at the pond, we shall be in the land of a strange king.</p>
 <p>We shall pass the ford of Tirpurni, and leave behind us the desert of Tepântar.</p>
 <p>When we come back it will be getting dark, and I shall tell you of all that we have seen.</p>
 <p>I shall cross the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.</p>
