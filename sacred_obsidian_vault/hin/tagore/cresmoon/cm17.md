 <h3 align="CENTER">THE CHAMPA FLOWER</h3>
 <p>Supposing I became a <i>champa</i> flower, just for fun, and grew on a branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?</p>
 <p>You would call, "Baby, where are you?" and I should laugh to myself and keep quite quiet.</p>
 <p>I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.</p>
 <p>When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders, you walked through the shadow of the <i>champa</i> tree to the little court where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the flower, but not know that it came from me.</p>
 <p>When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading <i>Ramayana</i>, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap, I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book, just where you were reading.</p>
 <p>But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your little child?</p>
 <p>When in the evening you went to the cow-shed with the lighted lamp in your hand, I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.</p>
 <p>"Where have you been, you naughty child?"</p>
 <p>"I won't tell you, mother." That's what you and I would say then.</p>
