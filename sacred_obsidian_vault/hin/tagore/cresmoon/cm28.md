 <p>Mother, your baby is silly! She is so absurdly childish!</p>
 <p>She does not know the difference between the lights in the streets and the stars.</p>
 <p>When we play at eating with pebbles, she thinks they are real food, and tries to put them into her mouth.</p>
 <p>When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b, c, she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at nothing; this is your baby's way of doing her lesson.</p>
 <p>When I shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun.</p>
 <p>Everybody knows that father is away, but if in play I call aloud "Father," she looks about her in excitement and thinks that father is near.</p>
 <p>When I hold my class with the donkeys that our washerman brings to carry away the clothes and I warn her that I am the schoolmaster, she will scream for no reason and call me dâdâ. [<i>elder brother</i> ]</p>
 <p>Your baby wants to catch the moon. She is so funny; she calls Ganesh Gânush. [<i>Ganesh, a common name in India, also that of the god with the elephant's head.</i>]</p>
 <p>Mother, your baby is silly, she is so absurdly childish!</p>
