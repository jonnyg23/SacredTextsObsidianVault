 <h3 align="CENTER">PLAYTHINGS</h3>
 <p>Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning.</p>
 <p>I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig.</p>
 <p>I am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour.</p>
 <p>Perhaps you glance at me and think, "What a stupid game to spoil your morning with!"</p>
 <p>Child, I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies.</p>
 <p>I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver.</p>
 <p>With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain.</p>
 <p>In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I too am playing a game.</p>
