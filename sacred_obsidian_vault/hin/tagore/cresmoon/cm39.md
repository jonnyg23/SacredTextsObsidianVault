 <h3 align="CENTER">THE GIFT</h3>
 <p>I want to give you something, my child, for we are drifting in the stream of the world.</p>
 <p>Our lives will be carried apart, and our love forgotten.</p>
 <p>But I am not so foolish as to hope that I could buy your heart with my gifts.</p>
 <p>Young is your life, your path long, and you drink the love we bring you at one draught and turn and run away from us.</p>
 <p>You have your play and your playmates. What harm is there if you have no time or thought for us.</p>
 <p>We, indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days that are past, to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost for ever.</p>
 <p>The river runs swift with a song, breaking through all barriers. But the mountain stays and remembers, and follows her with his love.</p>
