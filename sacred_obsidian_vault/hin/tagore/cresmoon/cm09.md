 <p>"Where have I come from, where did you pick me up?" the baby asked its mother.</p>
 <p>She answered half crying, half laughing, and clasping the baby to her breast,-- "You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling.</p>
 <p>You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with clay I made the image of my god every morning, I made and unmade you then.</p>
 <p>You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship I worshipped you.</p>
 <p>In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my mother you have lived.</p>
 <p>In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have been nursed for ages.</p>
 <p>When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered as a fragrance about it.</p>
 <p>Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow in the sky before the sunrise.</p>
 <p>Heaven's first darling, twin-born with the morning light, you have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you have stranded on my heart.</p>
 <p>As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong to all have become mine.</p>
 <p>For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of mine?"</p>
