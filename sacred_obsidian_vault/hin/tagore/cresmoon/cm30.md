 <h3 align="CENTER">TWELVE O'CLOCK</h3>
 <p>Mother, I do want to leave off my lessons now. I have been at my book all the morning.</p>
 <p>You say it is only twelve o'clock. Suppose it isn't any later; can't you ever think it is afternoon when it is only twelve o'clock?</p>
 <p>I can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of that rice-field, and the old fisher-woman is gathering herbs for her supper by the side of the pond.</p>
 <p>I can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing darker under the <i>madar</i> tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny black.</p>
 <p>If twelve o'clock can come in the night, why can't the night come when it is twelve o'clock?</p>
