 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">1-5. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Speaking these harsh and cruel words to the King, the Muni took that money and went away. When Visvâmitra went away, the King Harischandra became very much perplexed with sorrows and sighed frequently. He then began to say with his face bent downwards. Suffering from constant pain and troubles, I am now turned into a Preta; if anybody finds me serviceable, he may purchase me with value in gold as proper; but he should do this quickly before the sun sets. Dharma, then, assuming the form of a heartless</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Châ<u>nd</u>âla, came there quickly to test Harischandra. The body of that low mean person was of a black colour, his air looking ferocious, his belly elongated, body emitting stench odours, teeth very long, and his face, covered with beards. He had one bamboo in his hand; in his neck, the bones of the dead were hanging and his chest was very distorted.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">6. The Châ<u>nd</u>âla said :-- I am in urgent need of a servant; I will keep you as my slave; say, then, quickly what is your price?</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">7. Vyâsa said :-- O King! When the cruel, extremely ferocious and heartless Châ<u>nd</u>âla said thus, the King Harischandra was surprised to see his appearance and said :-- Who are you?</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">8-12. The Châ<u>nd</u>âla said :-- O King! I am the famous Châ<u>nd</u>âla, Pravîra; you will have to remain always subject to me and to collect the clothes of the dead persons. Hearing his word, the King said, I want to be purchased by a Brâhmi<u>n</u> or a K<u>s</u>attriya. See! The sages say, that the Dharma of good people is excellent; the Dharma of the persons intermediate is middling; and the Dharma of the mean is depressing. You belong to the low and mean class. So my Dharma cannot be observed if I remain in your house. The Châ<u>nd</u>âla said :-- O King! This is the Dharma of yours now mentioned by you; then why did you mention that anybody can purchase you; without any previous consideration, you spoke before me. He who speaks with preconsideration attains his desired object; but, O Sinless One! You did not consider and you spoke that ordinarily. However, if I take your words that you spoke first to be true, then you are no doubt, purchased by me.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">13. Harischandra said :-- The villain that speaks untruth, goes downright to a terrible hell; so to become a Châ<u>nd</u>âla is far better for me than to use an untrue word.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">14-15. Vyâsa said :-- O King! When the King was speaking thus, the ascetic Visvâmitra arrived there out of anger and impatience; he rolled his eyes and said :-- This Châ<u>nd</u>âla is come to give you your desired money; why, then, are you not giving me the remnant of my Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â!</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">16. Harischandra said :-- O Kaus'ika! Nothing is unknown to you. My this body is born for the Solar Line; how then can I accept this slavery of a Châ<u>nd</u>âla!</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">17-20. Visvâmitra said :-- If you do not sell yourself to a Châ<u>nd</u>âla, be certain that I will just now put you under my curse. Give me immediately</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">my Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â, be it whether from a Châ<u>nd</u>âla or from a Brâhma<u>n</u>a. There is no other purchaser at present than this Châ<u>nd</u>âla. But know this as certain that I wont go back until I get my money. O King! If you do not give me money just now, then when half the Ghatikâ of the day is remaining, I will burn you up by my fire of anger.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">2l. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of Visvâmitra, the King became almost dead; bewildered with fear, then he clasped the feet of the Ri<u>s</u>i and said, Be friendly, please.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">22-23. Harischandra said :-- O Viprar<u>s</u>i! I am now very humiliated and have become very afflicted and distressed. Especially I am your Bhakta, I am your servant; so be graciously pleased and free me from this painful companion of a Châ<u>nd</u>âla. O Muni! In lieu of my remnant Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â, I will be your obedient slave; I will do your work and follow your commands.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">24. Visvamitra said :-- O King! You are then my slave, you will obey always my commands.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">25-26. Vyâsa said :-- O King! When Visvâmitra said so, the King, out of joy, thought that he regained his life and said to Kausika. Always I will obey your words; now order me what work I will have to do.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">27-28. Visvâmitra, then addressed the Châ<u>nd</u>âla and said :-- O Châ<u>nd</u>âla! Come to me and give me the price for this slave. I am now handing this slave over to you; give me the price and take him. I want money; I have no need for a servant.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">29. Vyâsa said :-- O King! When Visvâmitra spoke thus, the Châ<u>nd</u>âla, overflowed with joy, came immediately to the Ri<u>s</u>i Visvâmitra and said :-- </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">30. O Dvîja! The relief that you have given me by selling this servant, for that I will give you the ten Yoyanas wide land  of Prayâga Ma<u>nd</u>alam, covered over with jewels.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">31-36. Vyâsa said :-- O King! The Châ<u>nd</u>âla then gave one thousand gems, one thousand jewels, one thousand pearls and one thousand gold Mohurs and Visvâmitra took them. No signs of distraction nor unpleasantness were visible on the face of the King Harischandra. Rather he laid hold of his patience and thought within himself, Visvâmitra is now my master; I will do any work that he puts</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">me in. At this time, the incorporeal voice, the voice of the fourth dimensional space, sounded from the Heavens :-- O Fortunate One! You are freed from the Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â, the debt before that you promised to give me. A shower of flowers fell on the head of the King from the Heavens. At this time the powerful Indra and the other hosts of the Devas praised the King, saying :-- Sâdhu! Sâdhu! Well-done, Well-done. The heart of the King was then filled with intense joy and the King then said to Kausika :-- </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">37-38. O Intelligent One! You are a greater benefactor to me than my father, mother and friend as you have freed me in a moment from my debts. So, O mighty armed one! Your words are beneficial to me. Now order what am I to do.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">39. When the King said so, Visvâmitra then said :-- Go and observe from today the words of the Châ<u>nd</u>âla. Let good befall on you! Thus saying, the Mahar<u>s</u>i Visvâmitra took the money given by the Châ<u>nd</u>âla and went away to his own place.</p>

 <p>Here ends the Twenty-third Chapter of the Seventh Book on the King Harischandras acknowledging of the slavery of the Châ<u>nd</u>âla in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S'rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.</p>
