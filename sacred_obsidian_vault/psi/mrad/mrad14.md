 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> person whom we are subjecting to this process of psychoanalysis has a strong color sense, and wanted to be a painter. So we note that she "gets" colors and names them correctly. Here is my drawing of what I meant to be a bouquet of pink roses (<a href="#img_fig046">figs. 46, 46a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig046"></a>

 <p>Or take this case of a lobster. Craig's comment was: "Gorgeous colors, red and greenish tinges." Apparently I had failed to decide whether I was drawing a live lobster or a boiled one! My wife wrote further: "Now it turns into a lizard, camelian <font size="-1" color="green">['Chameleon,' see aboveJBH]</font>, reds and greens." When</p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>she sees this about to be made public, she is embarrassed by her bad spelling; but she says: "Please do not overlook the fact that a chameleon is a reptileand so is a lobster." I dutifully quote her, even though her zoology is even worse than her spelling! (<a href="#img_fig047">figs. 47, 47a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig047"></a>
 <img src="img/fig047.jpg" alt="Fig. 47, Fig. 47a"></p>  
 <p>While we are on the "reptiles," I include this menacing crab, which may have got hold of little Mary Craig's toe on the beach of the Mississippi Sound (<a href="#img_fig048">fig. 48</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig048"></a>
 <img src="img/fig048.jpg" alt="Fig. 48"></p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>For the crab, Craig made two drawings, on opposite sides of the paper (<a href="#img_fig048a">figs. 48a, 48b</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig048a"></a>
 <img src="img/fig048a.jpg" alt="Fig. 48a, Fig. 48b"></p>  
 <p>The comments on the above read: "Wings, or fingerswing effect, but no feathers, things like fingers instead of feathers. Then many little dots which all disappear, and leave two of them, O O, as eyes of something." And then, "Streamers flying from something."</p>  
 <p>Another color instance: I drew the head of a horse, and Craig drew a lot of apparently promiscuous lines, and at various places wrote "yellow," "white," "blue," "(dark)," and then a general description, "Oriental." Afterwards she said to me: "That looks like a complete failure; yet it was so vivid, I can't be mistaken. Where did you get that horse?" Said I: "I copied it from a Sunday supplement." We got the paper from the trash-basket, and the page opposite the horse contained what Craig described.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p>We shall note several other cases of this sort of intrusion of things I did not draw, but which I had before me while drawing.</p>  
 <p>Also anything with metal or shine seems to stand a good chance of being "got." For example, these nose-glasses (<a href="#img_fig049">figs. 49, 49a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig049"></a>
 <img src="img/fig049.jpg" alt="Fig. 49, Fig. 49a"></p>  
 <p>The comment reads: "Opalescent shine or gleam. Also peafowl."</p>  
 <p>Or again, a belt-buckle; my wife writes the word "shines" (<a href="#img_fig050">figs. 50, 50a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig050"></a>
 <img src="img/fig050.jpg" alt="Fig. 50, Fig. 50a"></p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or this very busy alarm clockshe writes the same word "shines" (<a href="#img_fig051">figs. 51, 51a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig051"></a>
 <img src="img/fig051.jpg" alt="Fig. 51, Fig. 51a"></p>  
 <p>She has got at least part of a watch whenever one has been presented. You remember the one Bob drew (<a href="mrad08.htm#img_fig017">fig. 17</a>). There was another in series thirty-three; Craig made a crude drawing and added: "Shines, glass or metal" (<a href="#img_fig052">figs. 52, 52a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig052"></a>
 <img src="img/fig052.jpg" alt="Fig. 52, Fig. 52a"></p>  
 <p>Also, on the automobile ride to Pasadena, series three, there was a watch-face among the drawings, and Craig drew the angle of the hands, and added the words, "a complication of small</p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>configurations." Having arrived in Pasadena, she took the twelve drawings and tried them over again. This time, of course, she had a one in twelve chance of guessing the watch. She wrote: "A white translucent glimmering, or shimmering which I knew was not light but rather glass. It was like heat waves radiating in little round pools from a center. . . . Then in the center I saw a vivid black mark. . . . So it was bound to be the watch, and it was."</p>  
 <p>And here is a fountain. You see that it appears to be in a tub, and is so drawn by Craig. But you note that the "shine" has been got. "These shine!" (<a href="#img_fig053">figs. 53, 53a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig053"></a>
 <img src="img/fig053.jpg" alt="Fig. 53, Fig. 53a"></p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>Another instance, even more vivid. I made a poor attempt to draw a bass tuba, as one sees them on the stagea lot of jazz musicians dressed up in white duck, and a row of big brass and nickel horns, polished to blind your eyes. See what Craig drew, and also what she wrote (<a href="#img_fig054">figs. 54, 54a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig054"></a>
 <img src="img/fig054.jpg" alt="Fig. 54, Fig 54a"><br><font size="-3">Fig. 54, Fig 54a</font></p>  
 <p>The comments, continued on the other side of the sheet, are: "Dull gold ring shimmers and stands out with shadow behind it and in center of it. Gleams and moves. Metal. There is a glow of gold light, and the ring or circle is out in the air, suspended, and moves in blur of gold."</p>  
 <p>You see, she gets the feeling, the emotional content. I draw a child's express-wagon, and she writes: "Children again playing but can't get exactly how they look. Just feel there are children." Or take this one, which she describes as "Egyptian." I don't know if my pillar is real</p>  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Egyptian, but it seems so to me, and evidently to my wife, for you note all the artistry it inspired (<a href="#img_fig055">figs. 55, 55a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig055"></a>
 <img src="img/fig055.jpg" alt="Fig. 55, Fig. 55a"></p>  
 <p>Sometimes Craig will embody the feeling in some new form of her own invention; as for example, when I draw an old-fashioned cannon on wheels, and she writes: "Black Napoleon hat and red military coat." I draw a running fox well drawn, because I copy it from a picture; she rises to the occasion with two crossed guns, and a hunting horn with a lot of musical notes coming out of it (<a href="#img_fig056">figs. 56, 56a</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig056"></a>
 <img src="img/fig056.jpg" alt="Fig. 56, Fig. 56a"></p>  
 <p>I draw an auto, and she replies with the hub and spokes of a wheel. Not satisfied with this,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>she sets it aside, and tries again a little laterwithout looking at the original drawingand this time she produces a horn, with indication of a noise. I give both her drawings, which are on two sides of the same slip of paper (<a href="#img_fig057">figs. 57a, 57b</a>):</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_fig057"></a>
