 This is a memoir by a non-Mormon about his experiences in the
 prospecting camps of Utah at the turn of the 19th century.
 It was donated to sacred-texts by the anonymous volunteer who
 goes by the name of 'Some Dude'.
 This is a first-person perspective by an outsider to the then newly
 minted state of Utah, which gives both a sympathetic account of
 the Mormons, while bringing up some darker aspects about their history.
 He also presents a stereotypical portrayal of the Native Americans
 of the region.
 As always, we encourage readers to consider the historical
 context in which this book was written,
 as well as retain a critical point of view.
