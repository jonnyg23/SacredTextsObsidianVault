 <h1 align="center">FOREWORD</h1>
 <p align="left">This book is neither a History nor a Topography of the Territory 
 of Utah in the early seventies of the last century. The volume is due to the experiences 
 of an outsider who tried to be impartial in his views and sympathies. The personal 
 note, of course, rings in this record of those past days. No onslaught is made on 
 the "wild and woolly" west, nor on the eccentric religion of the majority of the 
 people.<br>
 <br>
 Through much peril and privation, the wild wastes of the Territory had been occupied 
 by a people whose hard toil had redeemed the desert. The picture of life presented 
 in these pages is in accord with the facts, the only changes made are in the names 
 of some of the characters.</p>
