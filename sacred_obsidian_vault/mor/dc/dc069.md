It is not wisdom in me that he should be entrusted with the commandments and the moneys which he shall carry unto the land of Zion, except one go with him who will be true and faithful.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_69:2">69:2</a></font></span> Wherefore, I, the Lord, will that my servant, John Whitmer, should go with my servant Oliver Cowdery;</p>

Amen. </p>
