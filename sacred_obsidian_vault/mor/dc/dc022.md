 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a></font></span> Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an hundred times it availeth him nothing, for you cannot enter in at the strait gate by the law of Moses, neither by your dead works.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a></font></span> For it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last covenant and this church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old.</p>
