 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:1">94:1</a></font></span> And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall commence a work of laying out and preparing a beginning and foundation of the city of the stake of Zion, here in the land of Kirtland, beginning at my house.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:2">94:2</a></font></span> And behold, it must be done according to the pattern which I have given unto you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:3">94:3</a></font></span> And let the first lot on the south be consecrated unto me for the building of a house for the presidency, for the work of the presidency, in obtaining revelations; and for the work of the ministry of the presidency, in all things pertaining to the church and kingdom.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:4">94:4</a></font></span> Verily I say unto you, that it shall be built fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and in the length thereof, in the inner court.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:5">94:5</a></font></span> And there shall be a lower court and a higher court, according to the pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:10">94:10</a></font></span> And again, verily I say unto you, the second lot on the south shall be dedicated unto me for the building of a house unto me, for the work of the printing of the translation of my scriptures, and all things whatsoever I shall command you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:11">94:11</a></font></span> And it shall be fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and the length thereof, in the inner court; and there shall be a lower and a higher court.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:12">94:12</a></font></span> And this house shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, for the work of the printing, in all things whatsoever I shall command you, to be holy, undefiled, according to the pattern in all things as it shall be given unto you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:13">94:13</a></font></span> And on the third lot shall my servant Hyrum Smith receive his inheritance.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:14">94:14</a></font></span> And on the first and second lots on the north shall my servants Reynolds Cahoon and Jared Carter receive their inheritances—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:15">94:15</a></font></span> That they may do the work which I have appointed unto them, to be a committee to build mine houses, according to the commandment, which I, the Lord God, have given unto you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_94:16">94:16</a></font></span> These two houses are not to be built until I give unto you a commandment concerning them.</p>
