 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:1">71:1</a></font></span> Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that the time has verily come that it is necessary and expedient in me that you should open your mouths in proclaiming my gospel, the things of the kingdom, expounding the mysteries thereof out of the scriptures, according to that portion of Spirit and power which shall be given unto you, even as I will.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:2">71:2</a></font></span> Verily I say unto you, proclaim unto the world in the regions round about, and in the church also, for the space of a season, even until it shall be made known unto you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:3">71:3</a></font></span> Verily this is a mission for a season, which I give unto you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:4">71:4</a></font></span> Wherefore, labor ye in my vineyard. Call upon the inhabitants of the earth, and bear record, and prepare the way for the commandments and revelations which are to come.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:5">71:5</a></font></span> Now, behold this is wisdom; whoso readeth, let him understand and receive also;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:6">71:6</a></font></span> For unto him that receiveth it shall be given more abundantly, even power.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:7">71:7</a></font></span> Wherefore, confound your enemies; call upon them to meet you both in public and in private; and inasmuch as ye are faithful their shame shall be made manifest.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:8">71:8</a></font></span> Wherefore, let them bring forth their strong reasons against the Lord.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:9">71:9</a></font></span> Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you—there is no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_71:10">71:10</a></font></span> And if any man lift his voice against you he shall be confounded in mine own due time.</p>
