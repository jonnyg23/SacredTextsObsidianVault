Revelation through Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery, Fayette, New York, September 1830. <i><br> History of the Church</i> 1:109-11.</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a></font></span> Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a></font></span> But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a></font></span> And thou shalt be obedient unto the things which I shall give unto him, even as Aaron, to declare faithfully the commandments and the revelations, with power and authority unto the church.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a></font></span> And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to speak or teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a></font></span> But thou shalt not write by way of commandment, but by wisdom;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a></font></span> And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a></font></span> For I have given him the keys of the mysteries, and the revelations which are sealed, until I shall appoint unto them another in his stead.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a></font></span> And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the Lamanites and preach my gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou shalt cause my church to be established among them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them not by way of commandment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a></font></span> And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where the city Zion shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I say unto you that it shall be on the borders by the Lamanites.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a></font></span> Thou shalt not leave this place until after the conference; and my servant Joseph shall be appointed to preside over the conference by the voice of it, and what he saith to thee thou shalt tell.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a></font></span> And again, thou shalt take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me and that Satan deceiveth him;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a></font></span> For, behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall anything be appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church covenants.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a></font></span> For all things must be done in order, and by common consent in the church, by the prayer of faith.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a></font></span> And thou shalt assist to settle all these things, according to the covenants of the church, before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a></font></span> And it shall be given thee from the time thou shalt go, until the time thou shalt return, what thou shalt do.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a></font></span> And thou must open thy mouth at all times, declaring my gospel with the sound of rejoicing. Amen. </p>
