 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a></font></span> Behold, I say unto you, my servants Ezra and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a></font></span> For verily, verily, I say unto you that ye are called to lift up your voices as with the sound of a trump, to declare my gospel unto a crooked and perverse generation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a></font></span> For behold, the field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a></font></span> And my vineyard has become corrupted every whit; and there is none which doeth good save it be a few; and they err in many instances because of priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a></font></span> And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this church have I established and called forth out of the wilderness.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a></font></span> And even so will I gather mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, even as many as will believe in me, and hearken unto my voice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a></font></span> Yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the field is white already to harvest; wherefore, thrust in your sickles, and reap with all your might, mind, and strength.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a></font></span> Open your mouths and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as Nephi of old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the wilderness.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a></font></span> Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a></font></span> Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a></font></span> Yea, repent and be baptized, every one of you, for a remission of your sins; yea, be baptized even by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a></font></span> Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and remember that they shall have faith in me or they can in nowise be saved;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a></font></span> And upon this rock I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a></font></span> And ye shall remember the church articles and covenants to keep them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a></font></span> And whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a></font></span> And the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your instruction; and the power of my Spirit quickeneth all things.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a></font></span> Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you, that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a></font></span> For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that I come quickly. Even so. Amen. </p>
