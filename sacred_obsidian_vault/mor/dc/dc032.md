 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a></font></span> And that which I have appointed unto him is that he shall go with my servants, Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the Lamanites.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a></font></span> And Ziba Peterson also shall go with them; and I myself will go with them and be in their midst; and I am their advocate with the Father, and nothing shall prevail against them.</p>
