 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:1">131:1</a></font></span> In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:2">131:2</a></font></span> And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:3">131:3</a></font></span> And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:4">131:4</a></font></span> He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:5">131:5</a></font></span> (May 17th, 1843.) The more sure word of prophecy means a man's knowing that he is sealed up unto eternal life, by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:6">131:6</a></font></span> It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:7">131:7</a></font></span> There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_131:8">131:8</a></font></span> We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter. </p>
