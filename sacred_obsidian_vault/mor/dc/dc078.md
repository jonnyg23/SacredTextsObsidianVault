 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:1">78:1</a></font></span> The Lord spake unto Joseph Smith, Jun., saying: Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are ordained unto the high priesthood of my church, who have assembled yourselves together;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:2">78:2</a></font></span> And listen to the counsel of him who has ordained you from on high, who shall speak in your ears the words of wisdom, that salvation may be unto you in that thing which you have presented before me, saith the Lord God.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:3">78:3</a></font></span> For verily I say unto you, the time has come, and is now at hand; and behold, and lo, it must needs be that there be an organization of my people, in regulating and establishing the affairs of the storehouse for the poor of my people, both in this place and in the land of Zion—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:4">78:4</a></font></span> For a permanent and everlasting establishment and order unto my church, to advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and to the glory of your Father who is in heaven;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:5">78:5</a></font></span> That you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly things, yea, and earthly things also, for the obtaining of heavenly things.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:6">78:6</a></font></span> For if ye are not equal in earthly things ye cannot be equal in obtaining heavenly things;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:7">78:7</a></font></span> For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:8">78:8</a></font></span> And now, verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient that all things be done unto my glory, by you who are joined together in this order;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:9">78:9</a></font></span> Or, in other words, let my servant Newel K. Whitney and my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and my servant Sidney Rigdon sit in council with the saints which are in Zion;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:10">78:10</a></font></span> Otherwise Satan seeketh to turn their hearts away from the truth, that they become blinded and understand not the things which are prepared for them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:11">78:11</a></font></span> Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, to prepare and organize yourselves by a bond or everlasting covenant that cannot be broken.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:12">78:12</a></font></span> And he who breaketh it shall lose his office and standing in the church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:13">78:13</a></font></span> Behold, this is the preparation wherewith I prepare you, and the foundation, and the ensample which I give unto you, whereby you may accomplish the commandments which are given you;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:14">78:14</a></font></span> That through my providence, notwithstanding the tribulation which shall descend upon you, that the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:15">78:15</a></font></span> That you may come up unto the crown prepared for you, and be made rulers over many kingdoms, saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Zion, who hath established the foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:16">78:16</a></font></span> Who hath appointed Michael your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction of the Holy One, who is without beginning of days or end of life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:17">78:17</a></font></span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:18">78:18</a></font></span> And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:19">78:19</a></font></span> And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:20">78:20</a></font></span> Wherefore, do the things which I have commanded you, saith your Redeemer, even the Son Ahman, who prepareth all things before he taketh you;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:21">78:21</a></font></span> For ye are the church of the Firstborn, and he will take you up in a cloud, and appoint every man his portion.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78:22">78:22</a></font></span> And he that is a faithful and wise steward shall inherit all things. Amen. </p>
