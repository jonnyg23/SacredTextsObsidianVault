 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:2">111:2</a></font></span> I have much treasure in this city for you, for the benefit of Zion, and many people in this city, whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit of Zion, through your instrumentality.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:3">111:3</a></font></span> Therefore, it is expedient that you should form acquaintance with men in this city, as you shall be led, and as it shall be given you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:4">111:4</a></font></span> And it shall come to pass in due time that I will give this city into your hands, that you shall have power over it, insomuch that they shall not discover your secret parts; and its wealth pertaining to gold and silver shall be yours.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:5">111:5</a></font></span> Concern not yourselves about your debts, for I will give you power to pay them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:6">111:6</a></font></span> Concern not yourselves about Zion, for I will deal mercifully with her.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:7">111:7</a></font></span> Tarry in this place, and in the regions round about;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:8">111:8</a></font></span> And the place where it is my will that you should tarry, for the main, shall be signalized unto you by the peace and power of my Spirit, that shall flow unto you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:9">111:9</a></font></span> This place you may obtain by hire. And inquire diligently concerning the more ancient inhabitants and founders of this city;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_111:10">111:10</a></font></span> For there are more treasures than one for you in this city.</p>
