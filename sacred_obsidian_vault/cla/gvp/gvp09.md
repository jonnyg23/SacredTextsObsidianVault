 <p>2. The wise man, and the despiser of wealth, resemble God.</p>
 <p>3. Do not investigate the name of God, because you will not find it. For every thing which is called by a name, receives</p>
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>
 <p>its appellation from that which is more worthy than itself, <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">1</font></a> so that it is one person that calls, and another that hears.

 <p><a name="fn_6"></a><a href="gvp09.htm#fr_6">54:1</a> For as every cause of Existence to a thing, is better than that thing, so far as the one is cause and the other effect; thus also, that which gives a name to any thing is better than the thing named, so far as it is named, <i>i. e.</i>, so far as pertains to its possession of a name. For the nominator is the cause, and the name the effect.</p>
