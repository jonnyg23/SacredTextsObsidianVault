 <p>6. The intellect of wise men, like gold, possesses the greatest weight.</p>
 <p>7. Boasting, like gilt armour, is not the same within as without.</p>
 <p>8. Reason has the same power as an ointment, for it benefits us when we are disordered, but delights us when well.</p>

 <p>14. A port is a place of rest to a ship, but friendship, to life.</p>
 <p>15. The reproof of a father is a pleasant medicine; for it is more advantageous than severe chastisements.</p>

 <p>16. It is necessary that a worthy man, like a good wrestler, should oppose his weight to fortune, when acting the part of an antagonist.</p>
 <p>17. The possession of self-sufficiency, <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">1</font></a> like a short and pleasant road, has much grace and but little labour.</p>
 <p>18. Restive horses are led by the bridle, but irritable minds, by reasoning.</p>
 <p>19. Tests, like salt, should be used sparingly.</p>
 <p>20. Both a well-adapted shoe, and a well-harmonized life, are accompanied with but little pain.</p>
 <p>21. Garments reaching to the feet impede the body <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and immoderate riches, the soul.</p>
 <p>22. To those who run in the stadium, the reward of victory is in the end of the race;</p>

 <p>23. It is necessary that he who hastens to behold virtue as his country, should pass by pleasures, as he would by the sirens.</p>
 <p>24. As those who sail in fair weather are wont to have things prepared against a storm, so also those who are wise in prosperity, should prepare things necessary for their assistance against adversity.</p>
 <p>25. Garments that are made clean and bright become soiled again by use; but the soul being once purified from ignorance, remains splendid forever.</p>
 <p>26. Fugitive slaves, although they are not pursued, are affrighted; but the unwise suffer perturbation, although they have not yet acted badly.</p>

 <p>28. The fruits of the earth spring up once a year; but the fruits of friendship at all times.</p>
 <p>29. It is the business of a musician to harmonize every instrument; but of a well-educated man to adapt himself harmoniously to every fortune.</p>

 <p>30. Neither the blows of a sick man, nor the threats of a stupid one, are to be feared.</p>

 <p>33. Untaught boys confound letters, but uneducated men, things.</p>
 <p>34, The intellect derived from philosophy is similar to a charioteer; for it is present with our desires, and always conducts them to the beautiful.</p>

 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>
 <p>the discourses of philosophy, exemption from pain.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_3"></a><a href="gvp07.htm#fr_3">39:1</a> Self-sufficiency must not be considered in the vulgar sense, as consummate arrogance; but as the internal possession of everything requisite to felicity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_4"></a><a href="gvp07.htm#fr_4">39:2</a> Long garments or robes, both by ancients and moderns, have always been worn as marks of distinction; consequently, like riches, they are among the objects of desire; and although not so extensively pernicious, yet the philosopher very properly places them among things that are by no means free from danger; and which are neither to be embraced by everyone, nor without the greatest caution.</p>
