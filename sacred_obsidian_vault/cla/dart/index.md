 This essay, published in 1820, was an attempt to prove that
 modern Freemasonry derived from ancient Greek philosophical and religious
 ideas.
 Hippolyto da Costa (1774-1823), was a Brazilian journalist,
 author, Freemason and world traveller.
 He was imprisoned for being a Freemason by the Inquisition
 in Portugal in 1802; he escaped in 1805.
 He settled in London and wrote a two volume book about his experiences,
 <cite>Narrativa da Perseguição</cite>, in 1811.
 He went on to start the first Brazilian periodical,
 the <cite>Correio Braziliense</cite>
 or <cite>Armazém Literário</cite>,
 (1808-23), for which he is known today as "the founder of the Brazilian Press".

 The original is extremely rare and was scanned
 from a reprint by the Philosophical Research Society Press dated 1936,
 which notes that it was "made possible through the courtesy of the Masonic
 Grand Lodge Library at Cedar Rapids, Iowa".
