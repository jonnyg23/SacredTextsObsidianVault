 This is Charles Kingsley's able retelling of the myths of Perseus,
 Jason and the Argonauts, and Theseus for young adults, originally published
 circa 1856.
 Kingsley is best known as the author of <cite>Water Babies</cite>.
 Although this is not the first time this text has appeared on the
 Internet, this is the only version with the complete set of Squire and
 Mars black and white and four-color art-deco illustrations. This includes two
 illustrations censored from later editions, probably because of female nudity.
 This also includes the original Preface, which was omitted from later editions.
 Otherwise the text, particularly the punctuation, was proofed according
 to a 1901 edition.
