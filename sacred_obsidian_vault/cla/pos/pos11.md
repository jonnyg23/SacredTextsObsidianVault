 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">When</span> the drifting gray of the vesper shadow<br> Dimmed their upward path through the midmost azure,<br> And the length of night overtook them distant<br>               Far from Olympus;</p>  
 <p>Far away from splendor and joy of Paphos,<br> From the voice and smile of their peerless Mistress,<br> Back to whom their truant wings were in rapture<br>               Speeding belated;</p>  
 <p>Chilled at heart and grieving they drooped their pinions,<br> Circled slowly, dipping in flight toward Lesbos,<br> Down through dusk that darkened on Mitylene's<br>               Columns of marble;</p>  
 <p>Down through glory wan of the fading sunset,<br> Veering ever toward the abode of Sappho,<br> Toward my home, the fane of the glad devoted<br>               Slave of the Goddess;</p>  
 <p>Soon they gained the tile of my roof and rested,<br> Slipped their heads beneath their wings while I watched them<br> Sink to sleep and dreams, in the warm and drowsy<br>               Night of midsummer.</p>
