 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From</span> the gnarled branches of the apple trees<br> The heavy petals, lifted by the breeze,<br> Fluttered on puffs of odor fine and fell<br> In the clear water of the garden well;</p>  
 <p>And some a bolder zephyr blew in sport<br> Across the marble reaches of my court,<br> And some by sudden gusts were wafted wide<br> Toward sea and city, down the mountain side.</p>  
 <p>Lesbos seemed Paphos, isled in rosy glow,<br> Green olive hills, the violet vale below;<br> The air was azure fire and oer the blue<br> Still sea the doves of Aphrodite flew.</p>  
 <p>My dreaming eyes saw Eros from afar<br> Coming from heaven in his mother's car,<br> In purple tunic clad; and at my heart<br> The God-was aiming his relentless dart.</p>  
 <p>He whom fair Aphrodite called her son,<br> She, the adored, she, the imperial One;<br> He passed as winds that shake the soul, as pains<br> Sweet to the heart, as fire that warms the veins;</p>  
 <p>He passed and left my limbs dissolved in dew,<br> Relaxed and faint, with passion quivered through;<br> Exhausted with spent thrills of dread delight,<br> A sudden darkness rushing on my sight.</p>
