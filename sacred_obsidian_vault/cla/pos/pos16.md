 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kypris</span>, hear my prayer to thee and the Nereids!<br> Safely bring the ship of my brother homewards,<br> Bring him back unharmed to the heart that loves him,<br>                 Throbbing remorseful;</p>  
 <p>Fair Immortal, banish from mind, I pray thee,<br> Every discord's hint that of yore estranged us;<br> Grant that never again dissension's hateful<br>                 Wrangle shall part us;</p>  
 <p>May he never in days to come remember<br> Keen reproach of mine that had grieved him sorely;<br> Words that broke my very heart when I heard them<br>                 Uttered by others;</p>  
 <p>Words that wounded deep and recurring often,<br> Bowed his head with shame at the public banquet;<br> Where my scorn, amid festal joy and laughter,<br>                 Sharpened the covert</p>  
 <p>Jests that stung his pride and assailed his folly,<br> Slave-espoused when he, a Lesbian noble,<br> Might have won the fairest in Mitylene,<br>                 Virgins the noblest;</p>  
 <p>Open slurs that linked his name with Doricha,<br> Lovely slave that Xanthes had sold in Egypt;<br> She whose wondrous charms the wealth of Charaxus<br>                 Ransomed from bondage.</p>  
 <p>Now that he is gone and my anger vanished,<br> Keen regret and grief for the pain I gave him<br> Pierce my heart, and fear of loss that is anguish<br>                 Darkens the daylight.</p>
