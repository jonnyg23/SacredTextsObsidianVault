 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aphrodite</span>, subtle of soul and deathless,<br> Daughter of God, weaver of wiles, I pray thee<br> Neither with care, dread Mistress, nor with anguish,<br>             Slay thou my spirit!</p>  
 <p>But in pity hasten, come now if ever<br> From afar of old when my voice implored thee,<br> Thou hast deigned to listen, leaving the golden<br>             House of thy father</p>  
 <p>With thy chariot yoked; and with doves that drew thee,<br> Fair and fleet around the dark earth from heaven,<br> Dipping vibrant wings down he azure distance,<br>             Through the mid-ether;</p>  
 <p>Very swift they came; and thou, gracious Vision,<br> Leaned with face that smiled in immortal beauty,<br> Leaned to me and asked, "What misfortune threatened?<br>             Why I had called thee?"</p>  
 <p>"What my frenzied heart craved in utter yearning,<br> Whom its wild desire would persuade to passion?<br> What disdainful charms, madly worshipped, slight thee?<br>             Who wrongs thee, Sappho?"</p>  
 <p>"She that fain would fly, she shall quickly follow,<br> She that now rejects, yet with gifts shall woo thee,<br> She that heeds thee not, soon shall love to madness,<br>             Love thee, the loth one!"</p>  
 <p>Come to me now thus, Goddess, and release me<br> From distress and pain; and all my distracted<br> Heart would seek, do thou, once again fulfilling,<br>             Still be my ally!</p>
