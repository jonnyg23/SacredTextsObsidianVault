 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Leto</span> and Niobe were friends full dear,<br> The Goddess heart and woman's heart were one<br> In that maternal love that men revere,<br> Love that endures when other loves are done.</p>  
 <p>But Niobe with all a mother's pride,<br> Artless and foolish, would not be denied;<br> And boasted that her children were more fair<br> Than Leto's lovely children of the air.</p>  
 <p>The proud Olympians vowed revenge for this,<br> Irate Apollo, angered Artemis;<br> They slew her children, heedless of her moan,<br> And with the last her heart was turned to stone.</p>
