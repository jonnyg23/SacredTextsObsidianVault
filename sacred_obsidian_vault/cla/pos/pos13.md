 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dreaming</span> I spake with the Daughter of Cyprus,<br> Heard the languor soft of her voice, the blended<br> Suave accord of tones interfused with laughter<br>                Low and desireful;</p>  
 <p>Dreaming saw her dread ineffable beauty,<br> Saw through texture fine of her clinging tunic<br> Blush the fire of flesh, the rose of her body,<br>                Radiant, blinding;</p>  
 <p>Saw through filmy meshes the melting lovely<br> Flow of line, the exquisite curves, whence piercing<br> Rapture reached with tangible touch to thrill me,<br>                Almost to slay me;</p>  
 <p>Saw the gleaming foot, and the golden sandal<br> Held by straps of Lydian work thrice doubled<br> Over the instep's arch, and up the rounded<br>                Dazzling ankle;</p>  
 <p>Saw the charms that shimmered from knee to shoulder,<br> Hint of hues, than milk or the snowdrift whiter;<br> Secret grace, the shrine of the soul of passion,<br>                Glows that consumed me;</p>  
 <p>Saw the gathered mass of her xanthic tresses,<br> Mitra-bound, escape from the clasping fillet,<br> Float and shine as clouds in the sunset splendor,<br>                Mists in the dawn-fire;</p>  
 <p>Saw the face immortal, and daring greatly,<br> Raised my eyes to hers of unfathomed azure,<br> Drank their world's desire, their limitless longing,<br>                Swooned and was nothing.</p>
