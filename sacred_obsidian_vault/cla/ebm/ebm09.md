 <p><small>I shall utter to whom it is lawful; but let the doors be closed, <br> Nevertheless, against all the profane. But do thou hear, <br> Oh Musæus, for I will declare what is true. . . .</small></p> 
 <p><small>He is the One, self-proceeding; and from him all things proceed, <br> And in them he himself exerts his activity; no mortal <br> Beholds Him, but he beholds all.</small></p> 
 <p><small>There is one royal body in which all things are enwombed, <br> Fire and Water, Earth, Æther, Night and Day, <br> And Counsel [<i>Metis</i>], the first producer, and delightful Love,—<br> For all these are contained in the great body of Zeus.</small></p> 
 <p><small>Zeus, the mighty thunderer, is first; Zeus is last;<br> Zeus is the head, Zeus the middle of all things; <br> From Zeus were all things produced. He is male, he is female; <br> Zeus is the depth of the earth, the height of the starry heavens;</small></p>

 <p><small>He is the breath of all things, the force of untamed fire; <br> The bottom of the sea; Sun, Moon, and Stars; <br> Origin of all; King of all; One Power, one God, one Great Ruler.</small></p>
