 <p>2. Thus there is the primally intellective and there is that in
 which intellection has taken another mode; but this indicates that
 what transcends the primarily intellective has no intellection; for,
 to have intellection, it must become an Intellectual-Principle, and,
 if it is to become that, it must possess an intellectual object and,
 as primarily intellective, it must possess that intellectual 
 object as
 something within itself.
 
 </p><p>But it is not inevitable that every intellectual object should
 both possess the intellective principle in itself and exercise
 intellection: at that, it would be not merely object but subject as
 well and, besides, being thus dual, could not be primal: further,
 the intellectual principle that is to possess the intellectual
 object could not cohere unless there existed an essence purely
 intellectual, something which, while standing as intellectual object
 to the intellectual principle, is in its own essence neither an
 agent nor an object of intellection. The intellectual object 
 points to
 something beyond itself [to a percipient]; and the intellectual
 agent has its intellection in vain unless by seizing and holding an
 object- since, failing that, it can have no intellection but is
 consummated only when it possesses itself of its natural term.
 
 </p><p>There must have been something standing consummate independently
 of any intellectual act, something perfect in its own essence: thus
 that in which this completion is inherent must exist before
 intellection; in other words it has no need of intellection, having
 been always self-sufficing: this, then, will have no 
 intellectual act.
 
 </p><p>Thus we arrive at: a principle having no intellection, a 
 principle
 having intellection primarily, a principle having it secondarily.
 
 </p><p>It may be added that, supposing The First to be intellective, it
 thereby possesses something [some object, some attribute]: at once
 it ceases to be a first; it is a secondary, and not even a unity; it
 is a many; it is all of which it takes intellectual possession; even
 though its intellection fell solely upon its own content, it must
 still be a manifold.
