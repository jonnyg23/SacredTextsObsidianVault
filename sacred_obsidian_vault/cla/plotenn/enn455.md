 <p>3. Thus we have here one identical Principle, the 
 Intellect, which
 is the universe of authentic beings, the Truth: as such it is a
 great god or, better, not a god among gods but the Godhead entire.
 It is a god, a secondary god manifesting before there is any 
 vision of
 that other, the Supreme which rests over all, enthroned in
 transcendence upon that splendid pediment, the Nature following
 close upon it.
 
 </p><p>The Supreme in its progress could never be borne forward 
 upon some
 soulless vehicle nor even directly upon the soul: it will be
 heralded by some ineffable beauty: before the great King in his
 progress there comes first the minor train, then rank by rank the
 greater and more exalted, closer to the King the kinglier; next his
 own honoured company until, last among all these grandeurs, suddenly
 appears the Supreme Monarch himself, and all- unless indeed for
 those who have contented themselves with the spectacle before his
 coming and gone away- prostrate themselves and hail him.
 
 </p><p>In that royal progress the King is of another order from those
 that go before him, but the King in the Supreme is no ruler over
 externs; he holds that most just of governances, rooted in 
 nature, the
 veritable kingship, for he is King of Truth, holding sway by all
 reason over a dense offspring his own, a host that shares his
 divinity, King over a king and over kings and even more justly
 called father of Gods.
 
 </p><p>[Interpolation: Zeus (Universal Soul) is in this a symbol of
 him, Zeus who is not content with the contemplation of his father
 (Kronos, divine Intellect) but looks to that father's father (to
 Ouranos, the Transcendent) as what may be called the divine energy
 working to the establishment of a real being.]
