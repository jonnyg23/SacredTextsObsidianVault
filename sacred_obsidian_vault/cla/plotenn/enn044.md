 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 12</h4>
 
 <p>12. The pleasure demanded for the life cannot be in the 
 enjoyments
 of the licentious or in any gratifications of the body- there is no
 place for these, and they stifle happiness- nor in any violent
 emotions- what could so move the Sage?- it can be only such pleasure
 as there must be where Good is, pleasure that does not rise from
 movement and is not a thing of process, for all that is good is
 immediately present to the Sage and the Sage is present to himself:
 his pleasure, his contentment, stands, immovable.
 
 </p><p>Thus he is ever cheerful, the order of his life ever untroubled:
 his state is fixedly happy and nothing whatever of all that is known
 as evil can set it awry- given only that he is and remains a Sage.
 
 </p><p>If anyone seeks for some other kind of pleasure in the 
 life of the
 Sage, it is not the life of the Sage he is looking for.
