 <p>28. We have already indicated that Activity and Passivity are to
 be regarded as motions, and that it is possible to distinguish
 absolute motions, actions, passions.
 
 </p><p>As for the remaining so-called genera, we have shown 
 that they are
 reducible to those which we have posited.
 
 </p><p>With regard to the relative, we have maintained that Relation
 belongs to one object as compared with another, that the two objects
 coexist simultaneously, and that Relation is found wherever a
 substance is in such a condition as to produce it; not that the
 substance is a relative, except in so far as it constitutes part of
 a whole- a hand, for example, or head or cause or principle or
 element.
 
 </p><p>We may also adopt the ancient division of relatives into
 creative principles, measures, excesses and deficiencies, and those
 which in general separate objects on the basis of similarities and
 differences.
 
 </p><p>Our investigation into the kinds of Being is now complete.
