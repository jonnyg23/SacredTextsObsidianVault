 <p>5. But what of sorrows, illnesses and all else that inhibit the
 native activity?
 
 </p><p>What of the suspension of consciousness which drugs or 
 disease may
 bring about? Could either welfare or happiness be present under such
 conditions? And this is to say nothing of misery and disgrace, which
 will certainly be urged against us, with undoubtedly also those
 never-failing "Miseries of Priam."
 
 </p><p>"The Sage," we shall be told, "may bear such afflictions and
 even take them lightly but they could never be his choice, and the
 happy life must be one that would be chosen. The Sage, that 
 is, cannot
 be thought of as simply a sage soul, no count being taken of the
 bodily-principle in the total of the being: he will, no doubt, take
 all bravely... until the body's appeals come up before him, and
 longings and loathings penetrate through the body to the inner man.
 And since pleasure must be counted in towards the happy life, how
 can one that, thus, knows the misery of ill-fortune or pain be
 happy, however sage he be? Such a state, of bliss self-contained, is
 for the Gods; men, because of the less noble part subjoined in them,
 must needs seek happiness throughout all their being and not 
 merely in
 some one part; if the one constituent be troubled, the other,
 answering to its associate's distress, must perforce suffer
 hindrance in its own activity. There is nothing but to cut away the
 body or the body's sensitive life and so secure that self-contained
 unity essential to happiness."
