 <p>13. It remains to decide whether only what is known in sense
 exists There or whether, on the contrary, as Absolute-Man 
 differs from
 individual man, so there is in the Supreme an Absolute-Soul
 differing from Soul and an Absolute-Intellect differing from
 Intellectual-Principle.
 
 </p><p>It must be stated at the outset that we cannot take all that is
 here to be image of archetype, or Soul to be an image of
 Absolute-Soul: one soul, doubtless, ranks higher than another, but
 here too, though perhaps not as identified with this realm, is the
 Absolute-Soul.
 
 </p><p>Every soul, authentically a soul, has some form of rightness and
 moral wisdom; in the souls within ourselves there is true 
 knowing: and
 these attributes are no images or copies from the Supreme, as in the
 sense-world, but actually are those very originals in a mode
 peculiar to this sphere. For those Beings are not set apart in some
 defined place; wherever there is a soul that has risen from body,
 there too these are: the world of sense is one- where, the
 Intellectual Kosmos is everywhere. Whatever the freed soul attains
 to here, that it is There.
 
 </p><p>Thus, if by the content of the sense-world we mean simply the
 visible objects, then the Supreme contains not only what is in the
 realm of sense but more: if in the content of the kosmos we mean to
 include Soul and the Soul-things, then all is here that is There.
