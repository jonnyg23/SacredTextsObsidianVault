 <p>10. If all this be true, we must at once admit signification,
 though, neither singly nor collectively, can we ascribe to the stars
 any efficacy except in what concerns the [material] All and 
 in what is
 of their own function.
 
 </p><p>We must admit that the Soul before entering into birth presents
 itself bearing with it something of its own, for it could never
 touch body except under stress of a powerful inner impulse; we must
 admit some element of chance around it from its very entry, since
 the moment and conditions are determined by the kosmic 
 circuit: and we
 must admit some effective power in that circuit itself; it is
 co-operative, and completes of its own act the task that belongs to
 the All of which everything in the circuit takes the rank 
 and function
 of a part.
