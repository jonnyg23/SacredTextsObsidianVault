 <p>26. We may now take the various specific types of Motion, such
 as locomotion, and once again enquire for each one whether it is not
 to be divided on the basis of direction, up, down, straight, 
 circular-
 a question already raised; whether the organic motion should be
 distinguished from the inorganic- they are clearly not 
 alike; whether,
 again, organic motions should be subdivided into walking, 
 swimming and
 flight.
 
 </p><p>Perhaps we should also distinguish, in each species, natural
 from unnatural motions: this distinction would however imply that
 motions have differences which are not external. It may indeed be
 the case that motions create these differences and cannot exist
 without them; but Nature may be supposed to be the ultimate source
 of motions and differences alike.
 
 </p><p>Motions may also be classed as natural, artificial and
 purposive: "natural" embracing growth and decay; "artificial"
 architecture and shipbuilding; "purposive" enquiry, learning,
 government, and, in general, all speech and action.
 
 </p><p>Again, with regard to growth, alteration and birth, the division
 may proceed from the natural and unnatural, or, speaking generally,
 from the characters of the moved objects.
