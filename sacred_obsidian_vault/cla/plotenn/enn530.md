 <p>24. There remains Situation, which like Possession is confined
 to a few instances such as reclining and sitting.
 
 </p><p>Even so, the term is not used without qualification: we say
 "they are placed in such and such a manner," "he is situated in such
 and such a position." The position is added from outside the genus.
 
 </p><p>In short, Situation signifies "being in a place"; there are two
 things involved, the position and the place: why then must two
 categories be combined into one?
 
 </p><p>Moreover, if sitting signifies an Act, it must be classed among
 Acts; if a Passion, it goes under the category to which belong
 Passions complete and incomplete.
 
 </p><p>Reclining is surely nothing but "lying up," and tallies with
 "lying down" and "lying midway." But if the reclining belongs thus
 to the category of Relation, why not the recliner also? For 
 as "on the
 right" belongs to the Relations, so does "the thing on the 
 right"; and
 similarly with "the thing on the left."
