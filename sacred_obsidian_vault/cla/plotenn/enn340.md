 <p>21. That this is the phase of the human being in which desire
 takes its origin is shown by observation of the different stages of
 life; in childhood, youth, maturity, the bodily desires 
 differ; health
 or sickness also may change them, while the [psychic] faculty is of
 course the same through all: the evidence is clear that the 
 variety of
 desire in the human being results from the fact that he is a 
 corporeal
 entity, a living body subject to every sort of vicissitude.
 
 </p><p>The total movement of desire is not always stirred
 simultaneously with what we call the impulses to the 
 satisfaction even
 of the lasting bodily demands; it may refuse assent to the idea of
 eating or drinking until reason gives the word: this shows us
 desire- the degree of it existing in the living body- advancing
 towards some object, with Nature [the lower soul-phase] refusing its
 co-operation and approval, and as sole arbiter between what is
 naturally fit and unfit, rejecting what does not accord with the
 natural need.
 
 </p><p>We may be told that the changing state of the body is sufficient
 explanation of the changing desires in the faculty; but that would
 require the demonstration that the changing condition of a given
 entity could effect a change of desire in another, in one 
 which cannot
 itself gain by the gratification; for it is not the desiring faculty
 that profits by food, liquid, warmth, movement, or by any relief
 from overplenty or any filling of a void; all such services touch
 the body only.
