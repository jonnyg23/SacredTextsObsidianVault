 <p>1. Whether every human being is immortal or we are wholly
 destroyed, or whether something of us passes over to dissolution and
 destruction, while something else, that which is the true 
 man, endures
 for ever- this question will be answered here for those willing to
 investigate our nature.
 
 </p><p>We know that man is not a thing of one only element; he 
 has a soul
 and he has, whether instrument or adjunct in some other mode, a
 body: this is the first distinction; it remains to investigate the
 nature and essential being of these two constituents.
 
 </p><p>Reason tells us that the body as, itself too, a composite,
 cannot for ever hold together; and our senses show us it breaking
 up, wearing out, the victim of destructive agents of many kinds,
 each of its constituents going its own way, one part working against
 another, perverting, wrecking, and this especially when the material
 masses are no longer presided over by the reconciling soul.
 
 </p><p>And when each single constituent is taken as a thing apart, it
 is still not a unity; for it is divisible into shape and matter, the
 duality without which bodies at their very simplest cannot cohere.
 
 </p><p>The mere fact that, as material forms, they have bulk means that
 they can be lopped and crushed and so come to destruction.
 
 </p><p>If this body, then, is really a part of us, we are not wholly
 immortal; if it is an instrument of ours, then, as a thing put at
 our service for a certain time, it must be in its nature passing.
 
 </p><p>The sovereign principle, the authentic man, will be as Form to
 this Matter or as agent to this instrument, and thus, whatever that
 relation be, the soul is the man.
