 <p>2. The born lover, to whose degree the musician also may attain-
 and then either come to a stand or pass beyond- has a certain memory
 of beauty but, severed from it now, he no longer comprehends it:
 spellbound by visible loveliness he clings amazed about that. His
 lesson must be to fall down no longer in bewildered delight before
 some, one embodied form; he must be led, under a system of mental
 discipline, to beauty everywhere and made to discern the One 
 Principle
 underlying all, a Principle apart from the material forms, springing
 from another source, and elsewhere more truly present. The 
 beauty, for
 example, in a noble course of life and in an admirably organized
 social system may be pointed out to him- a first training this in
 the loveliness of the immaterial- he must learn to recognise the
 beauty in the arts, sciences, virtues; then these severed and
 particular forms must be brought under the one principle by the
 explanation of their origin. From the virtues he is to be led to the
 Intellectual-Principle, to the Authentic-Existent; thence onward, he
 treads the upward way.
