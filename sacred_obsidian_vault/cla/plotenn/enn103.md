 <p>1. That the circuit of the stars indicates definite 
 events to come
 but without being the cause direct of all that happens, has been
 elsewhere affirmed, and proved by some modicum of argument: but the
 subject demands more precise and detailed investigation for to take
 the one view rather than the other is of no small moment.
 
 </p><p>The belief is that the planets in their courses actually produce
 not merely such conditions as poverty, wealth, health and 
 sickness but
 even ugliness and beauty and, gravest of all, vices and

 influence is
 different again from that of each single star, just as the 
 blending of
 distinct fluids gives a mixture unlike any of them.
 
 </p><p>Since these opinions and others of the same order are prevalent,
 it will be well to examine them carefully one by one, beginning with
 the fundamental question:
