 Socrates but of Man: though as to man we may enquire whether the
 individual may not also have place There. Under the heading of
 individuality there is to be considered the repetition of the same
 feature from man to man, the simian type, for example, and the
 aquiline: the aquiline and the simian must be taken to be
 differences in the Idea of Man as there are different types of the
 animal: but Matter also has its effect in bringing about the 
 degree of
 aquilinity. Similarly with difference of complexion, 
 determined partly
 by the Reason-Principle, partly by Matter and by diversity of place.
