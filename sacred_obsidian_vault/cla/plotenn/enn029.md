 <p>4. But this science, this Dialectic essential to all the three
 classes alike, what, in sum, is it?
 
 </p><p>It is the Method, or Discipline, that brings with it the power
 of pronouncing with final truth upon the nature and relation of
 things- what each is, how it differs from others, what common
 quality all have, to what Kind each belongs and in what rank each
 stands in its Kind and whether its Being is Real-Being, and how many
 Beings there are, and how many non-Beings to be distinguished from
 Beings.
 
 </p><p>Dialectic treats also of the Good and the not-Good, and of the
 particulars that fall under each, and of what is the Eternal and
 what the not Eternal- and of these, it must be understood, not by
 seeming-knowledge ["sense-knowledge"] but with authentic science.
 
 </p><p>All this accomplished, it gives up its touring of the realm of
 sense and settles down in the Intellectual Kosmos and there plies
 its own peculiar Act: it has abandoned all the realm of deceit and
 falsity, and pastures the Soul in the "Meadows of Truth": it employs
 the Platonic division to the discernment of the Ideal-Forms, of the
 Authentic-Existence and of the First-Kinds [or Categories of Being]:
 it establishes, in the light of Intellection, the unity there is in
 all that issues from these Firsts, until it has traversed the entire
 Intellectual Realm: then, resolving the unity into the particulars
 once more, it returns to the point from which it starts.
 
 </p><p>Now rests: instructed and satisfied as to the Being in that
 sphere, it is no longer busy about many things: it has arrived at
 Unity and it contemplates: it leaves to another science all that
 coil of premisses and conclusions called the art of 
 reasoning, much as
 it leaves the art of writing: some of the matter of logic, no doubt,
 it considers necessary- to clear the ground- but it makes itself the
 judge, here as in everything else; where it sees use, it uses;
 anything it finds superfluous, it leaves to whatever department of
 learning or practice may turn that matter to account.
