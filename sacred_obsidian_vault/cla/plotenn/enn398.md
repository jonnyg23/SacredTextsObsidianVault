 <p>15. (20) Thus far we have offered the considerations appropriate
 to those asking for demonstration: those whose need is conviction by
 evidence of the more material order are best met from the abundant
 records relevant to the subject: there are also the oracles of the
 Gods ordering the appeasing of wronged souls and the honouring of
 the dead as still sentient, a practice common to all mankind: and
 again, not a few souls, once among men, have continued to serve them
 after quitting the body and by revelations, practically helpful,
 make clear, as well, that the other souls, too, have not 
 ceased to be.
