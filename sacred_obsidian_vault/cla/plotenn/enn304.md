 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 18</h4>
 
 <p>18. There remains still something to be said on the question
 whether the soul uses deliberate reason before its descent and again
 when it has left the body.
 
 </p><p>Reasoning is for this sphere; it is the act of the soul fallen
 into perplexity, distracted with cares, diminished in strength: the
 need of deliberation goes with the less self-sufficing intelligence;
 craftsmen faced by a difficulty stop to consider; where there is no
 problem their art works on by its own forthright power.
 
 </p><p>But if souls in the Supreme operate without reasoning, how can
 they be called reasoning souls?
 
 </p><p>One answer might be that they have the power of deliberating to
 happy issue, should occasion arise: but all is met by repudiating
 the particular kind of reasoning intended [the earthly and
 discursive type]; we may represent to ourselves a reasoning 
 that flows
 uninterruptedly from the Intellectual-Principle in them, an inherent
 state, an enduring activity, an assertion that is real; in this way
 they would be users of reason even when in that overworld. We
 certainly cannot think of them, it seems to me, as employing words
 when, though they may occupy bodies in the heavenly region, they are
 essentially in the Intellectual: and very surely the deliberation of
 doubt and difficulty which they practise here must be unknown to
 them There; all their act must fall into place by sheer 
 force of their
 nature; there can be no question of commanding or of taking counsel;
 they will know, each, what is to be communicated from another, by
 present consciousness. Even in our own case here, eyes often 
 know what
 is not spoken; and There all is pure, every being is, as it were, an
 eye, nothing is concealed or sophisticated, there is no need of
 speech, everything is seen and known. As for the Celestials [the
 Daimones] and souls in the air, they may well use speech; for all
 such are simply Animate [= Beings].
