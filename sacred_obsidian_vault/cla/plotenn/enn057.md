 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 8</h4>
 
 <p>8. It may be urged that the actual presence of past experiences,
 kept present by Memory, gives the advantage to the man of the longer
 felicity.
 
 </p><p>But, Memory of what sort of experiences?
 
 </p><p>Memory either of formerly attained wisdom and virtue- in which
 case we have a better man and the argument from memory is 
 given up- or
 memory of past pleasures, as if the man that has arrived at felicity
 must roam far and wide in search of gratifications and is not
 contented by the bliss actually within him.
 
 </p><p>And what is there pleasant in the memory of pleasure? What is it
 to recall yesterday's excellent dinner? Still more ridiculous, one
 of ten years ago. So, too, of last year's morality.
