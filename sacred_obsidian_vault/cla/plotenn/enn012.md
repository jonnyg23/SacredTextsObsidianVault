 <p>9. That Soul, then, in us, will in its nature stand 
 apart from all
 that can cause any of the evils which man does or suffers; for all
 such evil, as we have seen, belongs only to the Animate, the
 Couplement.
 
 </p><p>But there is a difficulty in understanding how the Soul can go
 guiltless if our mentation and reasoning are vested in it: for all
 this lower kind of knowledge is delusion and is the cause of much of
 what is evil.
 
 </p><p>When we have done evil it is because we have been worsted by our
 baser side- for a man is many- by desire or rage or some evil image:
 the misnamed reasoning that takes up with the false, in 
 reality fancy,
 has not stayed for the judgement of the Reasoning-Principle: we have
 acted at the call of the less worthy, just as in matters of the
 sense-sphere we sometimes see falsely because we credit only 
 the lower
 perception, that of the Couplement, without applying the tests of
 the Reasoning-Faculty.
 
 </p><p>The Intellectual-Principle has held aloof from the act and so is
 guiltless; or, as we may state it, all depends on whether we 
 ourselves
 have or have not put ourselves in touch with the Intellectual-Realm
 either in the Intellectual-Principle or within ourselves; for it is
 possible at once to possess and not to use.
 
 </p><p>Thus we have marked off what belongs to the Couplement from what
 stands by itself: the one group has the character of body and never
 exists apart from body, while all that has no need of body for its
 manifestation belongs peculiarly to Soul: and the Understanding, as
 passing judgement upon Sense-Impressions, is at the point of the
 vision of Ideal-Forms, seeing them as it were with an answering
 sensation (i.e, with consciousness) this last is at any rate true of
 the Understanding in the Veritable Soul. For Understanding, the
 true, is the Act of the Intellections: in many of its manifestations
 it is the assimilation and reconciliation of the outer to the inner.
 
 </p><p>Thus in spite of all, the Soul is at peace as to itself 
 and within
 itself: all the changes and all the turmoil we experience are the
 issue of what is subjoined to the Soul, and are, as have said, the
 states and experiences of this elusive "Couplement."
