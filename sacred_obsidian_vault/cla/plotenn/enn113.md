 <p>11. And we must remember that what comes from the supernals does
 not enter into the recipients as it left the source; fire, for
 instance, will be duller; the loving instinct will degenerate and
 issue in ugly forms of the passion; the vital energy in a subject
 not so balanced as to display the mean of manly courage, 
 will come out
 as either ferocity or faint-heartedness; and ambition... in love...;
 and the instinct towards good sets up the pursuit of semblant
 beauty; intellectual power at its lowest produces the extreme of
 wickedness, for wickedness is a miscalculating effort towards
 Intelligence.
 
 </p><p>Any such quality, modified at best from its supreme form,
 deteriorates again within itself: things of any kind that approach
 from above, altered by merely leaving their source change further
 still by their blending with bodies, with Matter, with each other.
