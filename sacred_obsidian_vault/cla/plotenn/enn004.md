 <p>1. Pleasure and distress, fear and courage, desire and aversion,
 where have these affections and experiences their seat?
 
 </p><p>Clearly, either in the Soul alone, or in the Soul as 
 employing the
 body, or in some third entity deriving from both. And for this third
 entity, again, there are two possible modes: it might be either a
 blend or a distinct form due to the blending.
 
 </p><p>And what applies to the affections applies also to whatsoever
 acts, physical or mental, spring from them.
 
 </p><p>We have, therefore, to examine discursive-reason and the
 ordinary mental action upon objects of sense, and enquire whether
 these have the one seat with the affections and experiences, or
 perhaps sometimes the one seat, sometimes another.
 
 </p><p>And we must consider also our acts of Intellection, 
 their mode and
 their seat.
 
 </p><p>And this very examining principle, which investigates and
 decides in these matters, must be brought to light.
 
 </p><p>Firstly, what is the seat of Sense-Perception? This is 
 the obvious
 beginning since the affections and experiences either are sensations
 of some kind or at least never occur apart from sensation.
