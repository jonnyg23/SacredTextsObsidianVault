 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 10</h4>
 
 <p>10. To sum the results of our argument: All things and events
 are foreshown and brought into being by causes; but the causation is
 of two Kinds; there are results originating from the Soul and
 results due to other causes, those of the environment.
 
 </p><p>In the action of our Souls all that is done of their own 
 motion in
 the light of sound reason is the Soul's work, while what is 
 done where
 they are hindered from their own action is not so much done as
 suffered. Unwisdom, then, is not due to the Soul, and, in general-
 if we mean by Fate a compulsion outside ourselves- an act is fated
 when it is contrary to wisdom.
 
 </p><p>But all our best is of our own doing: such is our nature as long
 as we remain detached. The wise and good do perform acts; their
 right action is the expression of their own power: in the others it
 comes in the breathing spaces when the passions are in abeyance; but
 it is not that they draw this occasional wisdom from outside
 themselves; simply, they are for the time being unhindered.
