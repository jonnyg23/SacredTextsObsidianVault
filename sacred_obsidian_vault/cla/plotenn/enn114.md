 <p>12. All that thus proceeds from the supernal combines 
 into a unity
 and every existing entity takes something from this blended infusion
 so that the result is the thing itself plus some quality. The
 effluence does not make the horse but adds something to it; for
 horse comes by horse, and man by man: the sun plays its part no
 doubt in the shaping, but the man has his origin in the
 Human-Principle. Outer things have their effect, sometimes 
 to hurt and
 sometimes to help; like a father, they often contribute to good but
 sometimes also to harm; but they do not wrench the human being from
 the foundations of its nature; though sometimes Matter is the
 dominant, and the human principle takes the second place so 
 that there
 is a failure to achieve perfection; the Ideal has been attenuated.
