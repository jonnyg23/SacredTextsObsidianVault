 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 8</h4>
 
 <p>8. And- if it is desirable to venture the more definite
 statement of a personal conviction clashing with the general view-
 even our human soul has not sunk entire; something of it is
 continuously in the Intellectual Realm, though if that part, which
 is in this sphere of sense, hold the mastery, or rather be mastered
 here and troubled, it keeps us blind to what the upper phase holds
 in contemplation.
 
 </p><p>The object of the Intellectual Act comes within our ken only
 when it reaches downward to the level of sensation: for not all that
 occurs at any part of the soul is immediately known to us; a thing
 must, for that knowledge, be present to the total soul; thus desire
 locked up within the desiring faculty remains unknown except when we
 make it fully ours by the central faculty of perception, or by the
 individual choice or by both at once. Once more, every soul has
 something of the lower on the body side and something of the 
 higher on
 the side of the Intellectual-Principle.
 
 </p><p>The Soul of the All, as an entirety, governs the universe
 through that part of it which leans to the body side, but since it
 does not exercise a will based on calculation as we do- but proceeds
 by purely intellectual act as in the execution of an artistic
 conception- its ministrance is that of a labourless overpoising,
 only its lowest phase being active upon the universe it embellishes.
 
 </p><p>The souls that have gone into division and become appropriated
 to some thing partial have also their transcendent phase, but are
 preoccupied by sensation, and in the mere fact of exercising
 perception they take in much that clashes with their nature 
 and brings
 distress and trouble since the object of their concern is partial,
 deficient, exposed to many alien influences, filled with desires of
 its own and taking its pleasure, that pleasure which is its lure.
 
 </p><p>But there is always the other, that which finds no savour in
 passing pleasure, but holds its own even way.
