 <p>9. But how can we conceive a thing having existence 
 without having
 magnitude?
 
 </p><p>We have only to think of things whose identity does not depend
 on their quantity- for certainly magnitude can be distinguished from
 existence as can many other forms and attributes.
 
 </p><p>In a word, every unembodied Kind must be classed as without
 quantity, and Matter is unembodied.
 
 </p><p>Besides quantitativeness itself [the Absolute-Principle] does
 not possess quantity, which belongs only to things participating in
 it, a consideration which shows that Quantitativeness is an
 Idea-Principle. A white object becomes white by the presence of
 whiteness; what makes an organism white or of any other variety of
 colour is not itself a specific colour but, so to speak, a specific
 Reason-Principle: in the same way what gives an organism a certain
 bulk is not itself a thing of magnitude but is Magnitude itself, the
 abstract Absolute, or the Reason-Principle.
 
 </p><p>This Magnitude-Absolute, then, enters and beats the Matter out
 into Magnitude?
 
 </p><p>Not at all: the Matter was not previously shrunken small: there
 was no littleness or bigness: the Idea gives Magnitude exactly as it
 gives every quality not previously present.
