 <p>1. By common agreement of all that have arrived at the
 conception of such a Kind, what is known as Matter is 
 understood to be
 a certain base, a recipient of Form-Ideas. Thus far all go the same
 way. But departure begins with the attempt to establish what this
 basic Kind is in itself, and how it is a recipient and of what.
 
 </p><p>To a certain school, body-forms exclusively are the Real Beings;
 existence is limited to bodies; there is one only Matter, the stuff
 underlying the primal-constituents of the Universe: existence is
 nothing but this Matter: everything is some modification of this;
 the elements of the Universe are simply this Matter in a certain
 condition.
 
 </p><p>The school has even the audacity to foist Matter upon the divine
 beings so that, finally, God himself becomes a mode of Matter- and
 this though they make it corporeal, describing it as a body void of
 quality, but a magnitude.
 
 </p><p>Another school makes it incorporeal: among these, not 
 all hold the
 theory of one only Matter; some of them while they maintain the one
 Matter, in which the first school believes, the foundation of bodily
 forms, admit another, a prior, existing in the 
 divine-sphere, the base
 of the Ideas there and of the unembodied Beings.
