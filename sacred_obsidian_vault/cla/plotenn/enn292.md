 <p>6. But how comes it that while the All-Soul has produced 
 a kosmos,
 the soul of the particular has not, though it is of the one 
 ideal Kind
 and contains, it too, all things in itself?
 
 </p><p>We have indicated that a thing may enter and dwell at the same
 time in various places; this ought to be explained, and the enquiry
 would show how an identity resident simultaneously here and 
 there may,
 in its separate appearances, act or react- or both- after distinct
 modes; but the matter deserves to be examined in a special 
 discussion.
 
 </p><p>To return, then: how and why has the All-Soul produced a kosmos,
 while the particular souls simply administer some one part of it?
 
 </p><p>In the first place, we are not surprised when men of identical
 knowledge differ greatly in effective power.
 
 </p><p>But the reason, we will be asked.
 
 </p><p>The answer might be that there is an even greater 
 difference among
 these souls, the one never having fallen away from the All-Soul, but
 dwelling within it and assuming body therein, while the others
 received their allotted spheres when the body was already in
 existence, when their sister soul was already in rule and, 
 as it were,
 had already prepared habitations for them. Again, the reason may be
 that the one [the creative All-Soul] looks towards the universal
 Intellectual-Principle [the exemplar of all that can be], while the
 others are more occupied with the Intellectual within 
 themselves, that
 which is already of the sphere of part; perhaps, too, these 
 also could
 have created, but that they were anticipated by that originator- the
 work accomplished before them- an impediment inevitable 
 whichsoever of
 the souls were first to operate.
 
 </p><p>But it is safer to account for the creative act by nearer
 connection with the over-world; the souls whose tendency is
 exercised within the Supreme have the greater power; immune in that
 pure seat they create securely; for the greater power takes the
 least hurt from the material within which it operates; and this
 power remains enduringly attached to the over-world: it creates,
 therefore, self gathered and the created things gather round it; the
 other souls, on the contrary, themselves go forth; that can mean
 only that they have deserted towards the abyss; a main phase in them
 is drawn downward and pulls them with it in the desire towards the
 lower.
 
 </p><p>The "secondary and tertiary souls," of which we hear, must be
 understood in the sense of closer or remoter position: it is much as
 in ourselves the relation to the Supreme is not identical 
 from soul to
 soul; some of us are capable of becoming Uniate, others of striving
 and almost attaining, while a third rank is much less apt; it is a
 matter of the degree or powers of the soul by which our expression
 is determined- the first degree dominant in the one person, the
 second, the third [the merely animal life] in others while, 
 still, all
 of us contain all the powers.
