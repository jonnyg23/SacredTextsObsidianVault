 <p>20. We have to ascertain whether there is not to every quality a
 contrary. In the case of virtue and vice, even the mean appears to
 be contrary to the extremes.
 
 </p><p>But when we turn to colours, we do not find the intermediates so
 related. If we regard the intermediates as blendings of the
 extremes, we must not posit any contrariety other than that between
 black and white, but must show that all other colours are 
 combinations
 of these two. Contrariety however demands that there be some one
 distinct quality in the intermediates, though this quality 
 may be seen
 to arise from a combination.
 
 </p><p>It may further be suggested that contraries not only differ from
 each other, but also entail the greatest possible 
 difference. But "the
 greatest possible difference" would seem to presuppose that
 intermediates have already been established: eliminate the 
 series, and
 how will you define "the greatest possible"? Sight, we may be told,
 will reveal to us that grey is nearer than black to white; and taste
 may be our judge when we have hot, cold and no intermediate.
 
 </p><p>That we are accustomed to act upon these assumptions is obvious
 enough; but the following considerations may perhaps commend
 themselves:
 
 </p><p>White and yellow are entirely different from each other- a
 statement which applies to any colour whatsoever as compared with
 any other; they are accordingly contrary qualities. Their
 contrariety is independent of the presence of intermediates: between
 health and disease no intermediate intrudes, and yet they are
 contraries.
 
 </p><p>It may be urged that the products of a contrariety exhibit the
 greatest diversity. But "the greatest diversity" is clearly
 meaningless, unless we can point to lower degrees of diversity in
 the means. Thus, we cannot speak of "the greatest diversity" in
 reference to health and disease. This definition of contrariety is
 therefore inadmissible.
 
 </p><p>Suppose that we say "great diversity" instead of "the greatest":
 if "great" is equivalent to greater and implies a less, immediate
 contraries will again escape us; if, on the other hand, we mean
 strictly "great" and assume that every quality shows a great
 divergence from every other, we must not suppose that the divergence
 can be measured by a comparative.
 
 </p><p>Nonetheless, we must endeavour to find a meaning for the term
 "contrary." Can we accept the principle that when things have a
 certain similarity which is not generic nor in any sense due to
 admixture, but a similarity residing in their forms- if the term be
 permitted- they differ in degree but are not contraries; contraries
 being rather those things which have no specific identity? 
 It would be
 necessary to stipulate that they belong to the same genus, 
 Quality, in
 order to cover those immediate contraries which [apparently] have
 nothing conducing to similarity, inasmuch as there are no
 intermediates looking both ways, as it were, and having a mutual
 similarity to each other; some contraries are precluded by their
 isolation from similarity.
 
 </p><p>If these observations be sound, colours which have a 
 common ground
 will not be contraries. But there will be nothing to prevent, not
 indeed every colour from being contrary to every other, but any one
 colour from being contrary to any other; and similarly with tastes.
 This will serve as a statement of the problem.
 
 </p><p>As for Degree [subsisting in Quality], it was given as 
 our opinion
 that it exists in the objects participating in Quality, 
 though whether
 it enters into qualities as such- into health and justice- was left
 open to question. If indeed these qualities possess an 
 extension quite
 apart from their participants, we must actually ascribe to them
 degrees: but in truth they belong to a sphere where each 
 entity is the
 whole and does not admit of degree.
