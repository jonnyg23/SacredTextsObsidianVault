 <p>11. (16) What intelligent mind can doubt the immortality 
 of such a
 value, one in which there is a life self-springing and therefore not
 to be destroyed?
 
 </p><p>This is at any rate a life not imported from without, not
 present in the mode of the heat in fire- for if heat is 
 characteristic
 of the fire proper, it certainly is adventitious to the Matter
 underlying the fire; or fire, too, would be everlasting- it is not
 in any such mode that the soul has life: this is no case of a Matter
 underlying and a life brought into that Matter and making it 
 into soul
 [as heat comes into matter and makes it fire].
 
 </p><p>Either life is Essential Reality, and therefore self-living- the
 very thing we have been seeking- and undeniably immortal: or it,
 too, is a compound and must be traced back through all the
 constituents until an immortal substance is reached, something
 deriving movement from itself, and therefore debarred from accepting
 death.
 
 </p><p>Even supposing life could be described as a condition 
 imposed upon
 Matter, still the source from which this condition entered the
 Matter must necessarily be admitted to be immortal simply by being
 unable to take into itself the opposite of the life which it conveys.
 
 </p><p>Of course, life is no such mere condition, but an independent
 principle, effectively living.
