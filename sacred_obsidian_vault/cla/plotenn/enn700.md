 upon it and simply state it as the self-existent; such that if it
 had essence that essence would be subject to it and, so to speak,
 derived from it; none that has seen would dare to talk of its
 "happening to be," or indeed be able to utter word. With all his

 This, with the vision everywhere before the eyes of the soul so
 that, look where one may, there it is seen unless one deliberately
 look away, ignoring God, thinking no more upon Him. So we are to
 understand the Beyond-Essence darkly indicated by the 
 ancients: is not

 Essence nor to Himself; His essence is not His Principle; He is
 Principle to Essence and not for Himself did He make it; producing
 it He left it outside of Himself: He had no need of being who
 brought it to be. Thus His making of being is no "action in 
 accordance
 with His being."
