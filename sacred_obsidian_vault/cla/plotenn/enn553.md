 <p>16. As for Relation, manifestly an offshoot, how can it be
 included among primaries? Relation is of thing ranged against thing;
 it is not self-pivoted, but looks outward.
 
 </p><p>Place and Date are still more remote from Being. Place 
 denotes the
 presence of one entity within another, so that it involves a
 duality; but a genus must be a unity, not a composite. Besides,
 Place does not exist in the higher sphere, and the present
 discussion is concerned with the realm of True Being.
 
 </p><p>Whether time is There, remains to be considered. 
 Apparently it has
 less claim than even Place. If it is a measurement, and that a
 measurement of Motion, we have two entities; the whole is a
 composite and posterior to Motion; therefore it is not on an equal
 footing with Motion in our classification.
 
 </p><p>Action and Passivity presuppose Motion; if, then, they exist in
 the higher sphere, they each involve a duality; neither is a simplex.
 
 </p><p>Possession is a duality, while Situation, as signifying one
 thing situated in another, is a threefold conception.
