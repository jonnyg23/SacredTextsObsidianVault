 <p>1. Some Existents [Absolute Unity and Intellectual-Principle]
 remain at rest while their Hypostases, or Expressed-Idea, come into
 being; but, in our view, the Soul generates by its motion, 
 to which is
 due the sensitive faculty- that in any of its 
 expression-forms- Nature
 and all forms of life down to the vegetable order. Even as it is
 present in human beings the Soul carries its Expression-form
 [Hypostasis] with it, but is not the dominant since it is not the
 whole man (humanity including the Intellectual Principal, as 
 well): in
 the vegetable order it is the highest since there is nothing to
 rival it; but at this phase it is no longer reproductive, or, at
 least, what it produces is of quite another order; here life ceases;
 all later production is lifeless.
 
 </p><p>What does this imply?
 
 </p><p>Everything the Soul engenders down to this point comes into
 being shapeless, and takes form by orientation towards its author
 and supporter: therefore the thing engendered on the further side
 can be no image of the Soul, since it is not even alive; it 
 must be an
 utter Indetermination. No doubt even in things of the nearer order
 there was indetermination, but within a form; they were undetermined
 not utterly but only in contrast with their perfect state: at this
 extreme point we have the utter lack of determination. Let it be
 raised to its highest degree and it becomes body by taking such
 shape as serves its scope; then it becomes the recipient of 
 its author
 and sustainer: this presence in body is the only example of the
 boundaries of Higher Existents running into the boundary of 
 the Lower.
