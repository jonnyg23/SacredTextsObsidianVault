 <p>4. But if this is the true account of the unity of soul, we must
 be able to meet the problems that ensue: firstly, the difficulty of
 one thing being present at the same moment in all things; and,
 secondly, the difficulty of soul in body as against soul not 
 embodied.
 
 </p><p>We might be led to think that all soul must always inhabit body;
 this would seem especially plausible in the case of the soul of the
 universe, not thought of as ever leaving its body as the human soul
 does: there exists, no doubt, an opinion that even the human soul,
 while it must leave the body, cannot become an utterly disembodied
 thing; but assuming its complete disembodiment, how comes it that
 the human soul can go free of the body but the All-Soul not, though
 they are one and the same?
 
 </p><p>There is no such difficulty in the case of the
 Intellectual-Principle; by the primal differentiation, this 
 separates,
 no doubt, into partial things of widely varying nature, but eternal
 unity is secured by virtue of the eternal identity of that 
 Essence: it
 is not so easy to explain how, in the case of the soul described as
 separate among bodies, such differentiated souls can remain 
 one thing.
 
 </p><p>A possible solution may be offered:
 
 </p><p>The unit soul holds aloof, not actually falling into body; the
 differentiated souls- the All-Soul, with the others- issue from the
 unity while still constituting, within certain limits, an 
 association.
 They are one soul by the fact that they do not belong unreservedly
 to any particular being; they meet, so to speak, fringe to fringe;
 they strike out here and there, but are held together at the source
 much as light is a divided thing upon earth, shining in this house,
 and that, and yet remains uninterruptedly one identical substance.
 
 </p><p>The All-Soul would always remain above, since essentially it has
 nothing to do with descent or with the lower, or with any tendency
 towards this sphere: the other souls would become ours [become
 "partial," individual in us] because their lot is cast for this
 sphere, and because they are solicited by a thing [the body] which
 invites their care.
 
 </p><p>The one- the lowest soul in the to the All-Soul- would correspond
 to that in some great growth, silently, unlaboriously conducting the
 whole; our own lowest soul might be compared to the insect life in
 some rotted part of the growth- for this is the ratio of the animated
 body to the universe- while the other soul in us, of one ideal nature
 with the higher parts of the All-Soul, may be imaged as the gardener
 concerned about the insects lodged in the tree and anxiously working
 to amend what is wrong; or we may contrast a healthy man living with
 the healthy and, by his thought or by his act, lending himself to the
 service of those about him, with, on the other side, a sick 
 man intent
 upon his own care and cure, and so living for the body, body-bound.
