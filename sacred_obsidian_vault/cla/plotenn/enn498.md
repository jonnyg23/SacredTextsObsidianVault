 <p>7. Knowledge in the reasoning soul is on the one side concerned
 with objects of sense, though indeed this can scarcely be called
 knowledge and is better indicated as opinion or 
 surface-knowing; it is
 of later origin than the objects since it is a reflection from them:
 but on the other hand there is the knowledge handling the 
 intellectual
 objects and this is the authentic knowledge; it enters the reasoning
 soul from the Intellectual-Principle and has no dealing with
 anything in sense. Being true knowledge it actually is everything of
 which it takes cognisance; it carries as its own content the
 intellectual act and the intellectual object since it carries the
 Intellectual-Principle which actually is the primals and is always
 self-present and is in its nature an Act, never by any want forced
 to seek, never acquiring or traversing the remote- for all such
 experience belongs to soul- but always self-gathered, the very Being
 of the collective total, not an extern creating things by the act of
 knowing them.
 
 </p><p>Not by its thinking God does God come to be; not by its thinking
 Movement does Movement arise. Hence it is an error to call the Ideas
 intellections in the sense that, upon an intellectual act in this
 Principle, one such Idea or another is made to exist or exists. No:
 the object of this intellection must exist before the 
 intellective act
 [must be the very content not the creation of the
 Intellectual-Principle]. How else could that Principle come to know
 it: certainly not [as an external] by luck or by haphazard search.
