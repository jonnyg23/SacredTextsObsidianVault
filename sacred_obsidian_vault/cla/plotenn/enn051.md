 <p>2. It may be objected that our will towards living and towards
 expressive activity is constant, and that each attainment of such
 expression is an increase in Happiness.
 
 </p><p>But in the first place, by this reckoning every to-morrow's
 well-being will be greater than to-day's, every later instalment
 successively larger that an earlier; at once time supplants moral
 excellence as the measure of felicity.
 
 </p><p>Then again the Gods to-day must be happier than of old: and
 their bliss, too, is not perfect, will never be perfect. 
 Further, when
 the will attains what it was seeking, it attains something present:
 the quest is always for something to be actually present until a
 standing felicity is definitely achieved. The will to life which is
 will to Existence aims at something present, since Existence 
 must be a
 stably present thing. Even when the act of the will is directed
 towards the future, and the furthest future, its object is 
 an actually
 present having and being: there is no concern about what is passed
 or to come: the future state a man seeks is to be a now to him; he
 does not care about the forever: he asks that an actual present be
 actually present.
