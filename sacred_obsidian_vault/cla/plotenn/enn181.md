 <p>6. But in fact everything follows its own Kind; the birth is a
 horse because it comes from the Horse Kind, a man by springing from
 the Human Kind; offspring answers to species. Allow the 
 kosmic circuit
 its part, a very powerful influence upon the thing brought 
 into being:
 allow the stars a wide material action upon the bodily part of the
 man, producing heat and cold and their natural resultants in the
 physical constitution; still does such action explain character,
 vocation and especially all that seems quite independent of material
 elements, a man taking to letters, to geometry, to gambling, and
 becoming an originator in any of these pursuits? And can we imagine
 the stars, divine beings, bestowing wickedness? And what of 
 a doctrine
 that makes them wreak vengeance, as for a wrong, because they are in
 their decline or are being carried to a position beneath the 
 earth- as
 if a decline from our point of view brought any change to
 themselves, as if they ever ceased to traverse the heavenly spheres
 and to make the same figure around the earth.
 
 </p><p>Nor may we think that these divine beings lose or gain 
 in goodness
 as they see this one or another of the company in various 
 aspects, and
 that in their happier position they are benignant to us and, less
 pleasantly situated, turn maleficent. We can but believe that their
 circuit is for the protection of the entirety of things while they
 furnish the incidental service of being letters on which the augur,
 acquainted with that alphabet, may look and read the future 
 from their
 pattern- arriving at the thing signified by such analogies as that a
 soaring bird tells of some lofty event.
