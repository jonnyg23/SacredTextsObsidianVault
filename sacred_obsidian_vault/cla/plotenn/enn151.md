 <p>3. We have thus covered our main ground, but since corporeity has
 been mentioned, we must consider its nature: is it the conjunction
 of all the qualities or is it an Idea, or Reason-Principle, whose
 presence in Matter constitutes a body?
 
 </p><p>Now if body is the compound, the thing made up of all 
 the required
 qualities plus Matter, then corporeity is nothing more than their
 conjunction.
 
 </p><p>And if it is a Reason-Principle, one whose incoming constitutes
 the body, then clearly this Principle contains embraced within
 itself all the qualities. If this Reason-Principle is to be no mere
 principle of definition exhibiting the nature of a thing but a
 veritable Reason constituting the thing, then it cannot 
 itself contain
 Matter but must encircle Matter, and by being present to Matter
 elaborate the body: thus the body will be Matter associated with an
 indwelling Reason-Principle which will be in itself immaterial, pure
 Idea, even though irremoveably attached to the body. It is not to be
 confounded with that other Principle in man- treated elsewhere-
 which dwells in the Intellectual World by right of being itself an
 Intellectual Principle.
