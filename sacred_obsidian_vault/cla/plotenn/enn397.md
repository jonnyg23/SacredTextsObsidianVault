 <p>14. (19) As for the souls of the other living beings, fallen to
 the degree of entering brute bodies, these too must be immortal. And
 if there is in the animal world any other phase of soul, its only
 possible origin, since it is the life-giver, is, still, that one
 principle of life: so too with the soul in the vegetal order.
 
 </p><p>All have sprung from one source, all have life as their own, all
 are incorporeal, indivisible, all are real-beings.
 
 </p><p>If we are told that man's soul being tripartite must as 
 a compound
 entity be dissolved, our answer shall be that pure souls upon their
 emancipation will put away all that has fastened to them at 
 birth, all
 that increment which the others will long retain.
 
 </p><p>But even that inferior phase thus laid aside will not be 
 destroyed
 as long as its source continues to exist, for nothing from the realm
 of real being shall pass away.
