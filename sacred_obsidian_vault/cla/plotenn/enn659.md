 <p>21. Now what in all these objects of desire is the fundamental
 making them good?
 
 </p><p>We must be bold:
 
 </p><p>Intellectual-Principle and that life are of the order of good
 and hold their desirability, even they, in virtue of 
 belonging to that
 order; they have their goodness, I mean, because Life is an Activity
 in The Good,- Or rather, streaming from The Good- while
 Intellectual-Principle is an Activity already defined Therein; both
 are of radiant beauty and, because they come Thence and lead
 Thither, they are sought after by the soul-sought, that is, as
 things congenial though not veritably good while yet, as belonging
 to that order not to be rejected; the related, if not good, 
 is shunned
 in spite of that relationship, and even remote and ignobler 
 things may
 at times prove attractive.
 
 </p><p>The intense love called forth by Life and Intellectual-Principle
 is due not to what they are but to the consideration of their nature
 as something apart, received from above themselves.
 
 </p><p>Material forms, containing light incorporated in them, need
 still a light apart from them that their own light may be manifest;
 just so the Beings of that sphere, all lightsome, need another and a
 lordlier light or even they would not be visible to themselves and
 beyond.
