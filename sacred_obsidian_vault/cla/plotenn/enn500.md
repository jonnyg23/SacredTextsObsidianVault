 <p>9. What, then, is the content- inevitably separated by our
 minds- of this one Intellectual-Principle? For there is no resource
 but to represent the items in accessible form just as we study the
 various articles constituting one science.
 
 </p><p>This universe is a living thing capable of including 
 every form of
 life; but its Being and its modes are derived from elsewhere; that
 source is traced back to the Intellectual-Principle: it follows that
 the all-embracing archetype is in the Intellectual-Principle, which,
 therefore, must be an intellectual Kosmos, that indicated by Plato
 in the phrase "The living existent."
 
 </p><p>Given the Reason-Principle [the outgoing divine Idea] of 
 a certain
 living thing and the Matter to harbour this seed-principle, 
 the living
 thing must come into being: in the same way once there exists- an
 intellective Nature, all powerful, and with nothing to check 
 it- since
 nothing intervenes between it and that which is of a nature 
 to receive
 it- inevitably the higher imprints form and the lower 
 accepts, it. The
 recipient holds the Idea in division, here man, there sun, while in
 the giver all remains in unity.
