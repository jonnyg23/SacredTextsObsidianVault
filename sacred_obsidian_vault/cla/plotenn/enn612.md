 <p>6. The Intellectual Beings, thus, are multiple and one; in
 virtue of their infinite nature their unity is a 
 multiplicity, many in
 one and one over many, a unit-plurality. They act as entire upon
 entire; even upon the partial thing they act as entire; but there is
 the difference that at first the partial accepts this working only
 partially though the entire enters later. Thus, when Man enters into
 human form there exists a particular man who, however, is still Man.
 From the one thing Man- man in the Idea- material man has come to
 constitute many individual men: the one identical thing is present
 in multiplicity, in multi-impression, so to speak, from the one seal.
 
 </p><p>This does not mean that Man Absolute, or any Absolute, or the
 Universe in the sense of a Whole, is absorbed by multiplicity; on
 the contrary, the multiplicity is absorbed by the Absolute, or
 rather is bound up with it. There is a difference between the mode
 in which a colour may be absorbed by a substance entire and that in
 which the soul of the individual is identically present in every
 part of the body: it is in this latter mode that Being is 
 omnipresent.
