 <h3 align="CENTER">TO MERCURY.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.</h6>
 <p>HERMES, draw near, and to my pray'r incline,<br>
 Angel of Jove, and Maia's son divine;<br>
 Studious of contests, ruler of mankind,<br>
 With heart almighty, and a prudent mind.<br>
 Celestial messenger, of various skill, 5<br>
 Whose pow'rful arts could watchful Argus kill:<br>
 With winged feet, 'tis thine thro' air to course,<br>
 O friend of man, and prophet of discourse:<br>
 Great life-supporter, to rejoice is thine,<br>
 In arts gymnastic, and in fraud divine: 10<br>
 With pow'r endu'd all language to explain,<br>
 Of care the loos'ner, and the source of gain.<br>
 Whose hand contains of blameless peace the rod,<br>
 Corucian, blessed, profitable God;<br>
 Of various speech, whose aid in works we find, 15<br>
 And in necessities to mortals kind:</p>
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a></p>
 <p>Dire weapon of the tongue, which men revere,<br>
 Be present, Hermes, and thy suppliant hear;<br>
 Assist my works, conclude my life with peace,<br>
 Give graceful speech, and me memory's increase. 20</p>
