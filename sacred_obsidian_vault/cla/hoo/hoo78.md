 <h6 align="CENTER">LXXIII.</h6>
 <h3 align="CENTER">TO LEUCOTHEA.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.</h6>
 <p>I Call Leucothea, of great Cadmus born,<br>
 And Bacchus' nurse, whom ivy leaves adorn.<br>
 Hear, pow'rful Goddess, in the mighty deep<br>
 Wide and profound, thy Ration doom'd to keep:<br>
 In waves rejoicing, guardian of mankind; 5<br>
 For ships from thee alone deliv'rance find<br>
 Amidst the fury of th' unstable main,<br>
 When art no more avail, and strength is vain;<br>
 When rushing billows with tempestuous ire<br>
 O'erwhelm the mariner in ruin dire, 10<br>
 Thou hear'st, with pity touch'd, his suppliant pray'r,<br>
 Resolv'd his life to succour and to spare.<br>
 Be ever present, Goddess! in distress,<br>
 Waft ships along with prosperous success:<br>
 Thy mystics thro' the stormy sea defend, 15<br>
 And safe conduct them to their destin'd end.</p>
