 <h6 align="CENTER">LXIII.</h6>
 <h3 align="CENTER">TO LAW</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">A HYMN.</h6>
 <p>THE holy king of Gods and men I call,<br>
 Celestial Law, the righteous seal of all;<br>
 The seal which stamps whate'er the earth contains,<br>
 Nature's firm basis, and the liquid plains:<br>
 Stable, and starry, of harmonious frame, 5<br>
 Preserving laws eternally the same:</p>
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>
 <p>Thy all-composing pow'r in heaven appears,<br>
 Connects its frame, and props the starry spheres;<br>
 And shakes weak Envy with tremendous sound,<br>
 Toss'd by thy arm in giddy whirls around. 10<br>
 'Tis thine, the life of mortals to defend,<br>
 And crown existence with a blessed end;<br>
 For thy command and alone, of all that lives<br>
 Order and rule to ev'ry dwelling gives:<br>
 Ever observant of the upright mind, 15<br>
 And of just actions the companion kind;<br>
 Foe to the lawless, with avenging ire,<br>
 Their steps involving in destruction dire.<br>
 Come, bless, abundant pow'r, whom all revere,<br>
 By all desir'd, with favr'ing mind draw near; 20<br>
 Give me thro' life, on thee to fix my fight,<br>
 And ne'er forsake the equal paths of right.</p>
