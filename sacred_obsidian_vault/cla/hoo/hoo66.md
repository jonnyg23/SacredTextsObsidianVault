 <h3 align="CENTER">TO JUSTICE.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.</h6>
 <p>THE piercing eye of Justice bright, I sing,  <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Plac'd by the throne of heav'n's almighty king,</p>
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>
 <p>Perceiving thence, with vision unconfin'd,<br>
 The life and conduct of the human kind<br>
 To thee, revenge and punishment belong, 5<br>
 Chastising ev'ry deed, unjust and wrong;<br>
 Whose pow'r alone, dissimilars can join,<br>
 And from th' equality of truth combine:<br>
 For all the ill, persuasion can inspire,<br>
 When urging bad designs, with counsel dire, 10<br>
 'Tis thine alone to punish; with the race<br>
 Of lawless passions, and incentives base;<br>
 For thou art ever to the good inclin'd,<br>
 And hostile to the men of evil mind.<br>
 Come, all-propitious, and thy suppliant hear, 15<br>
 When Fate's predestin'd, final hour draws near.</p>

This Hymn is cited by Demosthenes in his first speech against Aristogiton, as follows: "Let us, says the orator overlooking all custom, judge righteous judgment; let us reverence Eunomia that loves equity, and preserves states; and inexorable Δικη right or justice <a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a> whom Orpheus our instructor, in the most holy initiations, τελεται, places by the throne of Jove, inspecting the affairs of men. Let each of us imagine her piercing eye is now upon us, and think and vote so as not to dishonour <i>her</i> from whom every judge has his name."</p>
