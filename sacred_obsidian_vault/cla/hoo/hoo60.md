 <h6 align="CENTER">LV.</h6>
 <h3 align="CENTER">TO ADONIS.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.</h6>
 <p>MUCH-nam'd, and best of dæmons, hear my pray'r,<br>
 The desart-loving, deck'd with tender hair;<br>
 Joy to diffuse, by all desir'd is thine,<br>
 Much form'd, Eubulus; aliment divine</p>
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>
 <p>Female and Male, all charming to the sight, 5<br>
 Adonis ever flourishing and bright;<br>
 At stated periods doom'd to set and rise,<br>
 With splendid lamp, the glory of the skies.  <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">8</font></a><br>
 Two-horn'd and lovely, reverenc'd with tears,<br>
 Of beauteous form, adorn'd with copious hairs. 10<br>
 Rejoicing in the chace, all-graceful pow'r,<br>
 Sweet plant of Venus, Love's delightful flow'r:<br>
 Descended from the secret bed divine,<br>
 Of lovely-hair'd, infernal Proserpine.<br>
 'Tis thine to fink in Tartarus profound, 15<br>
 And shine again thro' heav'ns illustrious round,<br>
 With beauteous temp'ral orb restor'd to sight;<br>
 Come, with earth's fruits, and in these flames delight.</p>
