 <h3 align="CENTER">TO THE DIVINITY OF DREAMS.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.</h6>
 <p>THEE I invoke, blest pow'r of dreams divine,<br>
 Angel of future fates, swift wings are thine:<br>
 Great source of oracles to human kind,<br>
 When stealing soft, and whisp'ring to the mind,<br>
 Thro' sleep's sweet silence and the gloom of night, 5<br>
 Thy pow'r awakes th' intellectual fight;<br>
 To silent souls the will of heav'n relates,<br>
 And silently reveals their future fates.<br>
 For ever friendly to the upright mind<br>
 Sacred and pure, to holy rites inclin'd; 10</p>
 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a></p>
 <p>For these with pleasing hope thy dreams inspire,<br>
 Bliss to anticipate, which all desire.<br>
 Thy visions manifest of fate disclose,<br>
 What methods best may mitigate our woes;<br>
 Reveal what rites the Gods immortal please, 15<br>
 And what the means their anger to appease:<br>
 For ever tranquil is the good man's end,<br>
 Whose life, thy dreams admonish and defend.<br>
 But from the wicked turn'd averse to bless,<br>
 Thy form unseen, the angel of distress; 20<br>
 No means to cheek approaching ill they find,<br>
 Pensive with fears, and to the future blind.<br>
 Come, blessed pow'r, the signatures reveal<br>
 Which heav'n's decrees mysteriously conceal,<br>
 Signs only present to the worthy mind, 25<br>
 Nor omens ill disclose of monst'rous kind.</p>
