 <h3 align="CENTER">TO THE STARS.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.</h6>
 <p>WITH holy voice I call the stars on high,<br>
 Pure sacred lights and genii of the sky.<br>
 Celestial stars, the progeny of Night,<br>
 In whirling circles beaming far your light,<br>
 Refulgent rays around the heav'ns ye throw, 5<br>
 Eternal fires, the source of all below.<br>
 With flames significant of Fate ye shine,<br>
 And aptly rule for men a path divine.<br>
 In seven bright zones ye run with wand'ring flames,<br>
 And heaven and earth compose your lucid frames: 10  <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">10</font></a><br>
 With course unwearied, pure and fiery bright<br>
 Forever shining thro' the veil of Night.<br>
 Hail twinkling, joyful, ever wakeful fires!<br>
 Propitious shine on all my just desires;</p>
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a></p>
 <p>These sacred rites regard with conscious rays, 15<br>
 And end our works devoted to your praise.</p>

It is an Orphic and Pythagoric opinion that the stars are inhabited; on which account they are called in this hymn, earthly. But the greatest geniuses of antiquity were of the same opinion; such as Anaxagoras, Aristarchus, Heraclitus, Plato, &amp;c. and among the Platonists not a few, as Alcinous, Plotinus, and Plutarch. Thales too is said to have called the stars earthly, by which it is probable he was of the same opinion.</p>
