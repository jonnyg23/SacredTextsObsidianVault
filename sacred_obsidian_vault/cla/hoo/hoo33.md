 <h6 align="CENTER">XXVIII.</h6>
 <h3 align="CENTER">TO PROSERPINE.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">A HYMN</h6>
 <p>DAUGHTER of Jove, almighty and divine,<br>
 Come, blessed queen, and to these rites incline:<br>
 Only-begotten, Pluto's honor'd wife,  <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 O venerable Goddess, source of life:<br>
 'Tis thine in earth's profundities to dwell, 5<br>
 Fast by the wide and dismal gates of hell:<br>
 Jove's holy offspring, of a beauteous mien,<br>
 Fatal, with lovely locks, infernal queen:<br>
 Source of the furies, whose blest frame proceeds<br>
 From Jove's ineffable and secret seeds: 10<br>
 Mother of Bacchus, Sonorous, divine,<br>
 And many-form'd, the parent of the vine:<br>
 The dancing Hours attend thee, essence bright,<br>
 All-ruling virgin, bearing heav'nly light:</p>
 <p><a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a></p>
 <p>Illustrious, horned, of a bounteous mind, 13<br>
 Alone desir'd by those of mortal kind.<br>
 O, vernal queen, whom grassy plains delight,<br>
 Sweet to the smell, and pleasing to the sight:<br>
 Whose holy form in budding fruits we view,<br>
 Earth's vig'rous offspring of a various hue: 20<br>
 Espous'd in Autumn: life and death alone  <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">21</font></a><br>
 To wretched mortals from thy power is known:<br>
 For thine the task according to thy will,  <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">23</font></a><br>
 Life to produce, and all that lives to kill.</p>
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p>
 <p>Hear, blessed Goddess, send a rich increase 25<br>
 Of various fruits from earth, with lovely Peace;<br>
 Send Health with gentle hand, and crown my life<br>
 With blest abundance, free from noisy strife;<br>
 Last in extreme old age the prey of Death,<br>
 Dismiss we willing to the realms beneath, 30<br>
 To thy fair palace, and the blissful plains<br>
 Where happy spirits dwell, and Pluto reigns.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_83"></a><a href="hoo33.htm#fr_83">153:3</a> Ver. 3] <i>Only-begotten</i>. Καὶ γὰρ ὁ Θεολογός την κόρην ΜΟΥΝΟ-ΓΕΝΕΙΑΝ ἔιαθε προσαγορεύειν. Proc. Tim. 2 extra p. 139. 9. i.e. "I see that the theologist (meaning Orpheus) calls Proserpine, "Only-begotten".</p>
 <p><a name="fn_84"></a><a href="hoo33.htm#fr_84">154:21</a> Ver. 21.] <i>Espous'd in Autumn</i>. We have already observed in the Dissertation, that the Orphic theologers considered a difference of sex in the divinities; attributing the male to some, and the female to others. Now the mutual commerce and energy subsisting between these Gods and Goddesses, they denominated Ιεροι Γαμοι, i. e. "holy marriages:" or according to Proclus, on the Parmenides of Plato, as cited by Eschenbach, in Epig. p. 59. they mystically called, the simple kindred conjunction, and communion of divine causes, a marriage. And Proserpine, or the animating part of the earth's soul, may he considered as resting in Autumn, from all farther productions; her powers at that time having attained their full perfection.</p>
 <p>Hence at this period may we not say, that she is wholly abstracted from the animal life, and secretly united with Pluto, or the intellectual part of the earth's soul; from whom she receives the divine light of mind, and copious streams of the nectar of divine knowledge.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_85"></a><a href="hoo33.htm#fr_85">154:23</a> Ver. 23.] <i>For thine the task</i>, &amp;c. Proclus, in Theol. Plat. p. 371, informs us, that, according to the Eleusinian mysteries, Proserpine together with Pluto, governs terrestrial concerns, and the recesses of the earth: that she supplies life to the extreme <a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a> parts of the universe, and imparts soul to those, who, by her power, are rendered inanimate and dead. This is perfectly agreeable to the 23d and following line.</p>
