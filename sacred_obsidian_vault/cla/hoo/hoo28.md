 <h6 align="CENTER">XXIII.</h6>
 <h3 align="CENTER">TO THE NEREIDS.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.</h6>
 <p>DAUGHTERS of Nereus, resident in caves<br>
 Merg'd deep in Ocean, sporting thro' the waves;<br>
 Fanatic fifty nymphs, who thro' the main<br>
 Delight to follow in the Triton's train,<br>
 Rejoicing close behind their cars to keep; 5<br>
 Whose forms half wild, are nourish'd by the deep,<br>
 With other nymphs of different degree<br>
 Leaping and wand'ring thro' the liquid sea:<br>
 Bright, wat'ry dolphins, sonorous and gay,<br>
 Well pleas'd to sport with bachanalian play; 10<br>
 Nymphs beauteous-ey'd, whom sacrifice delights,<br>
 Send rich abundance on our mystic rites;<br>
 For you at first disclos'd the rites divine,<br>
 Of holy Bacchus and of Proserpine,<br>
 Of fair Calliope from whom I spring, 15<br>
 And of Apollo bright, the Muse's king.</p>
