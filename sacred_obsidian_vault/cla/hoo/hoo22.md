 <h3 align="CENTER">TO PLUTO.</h3>
 <p>PLUTO, magnanimous, whose realms profound<br>
 Are fix'd beneath the firm and solid ground,<br>
 In the Tartarian plains remote from fight,<br>
 And wrapt forever in the depths of night;<br>
 Terrestrial Jove, thy sacred ear incline, 5  <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">5</font></a><br>
 And, pleas'd, accept thy mystic's hymn divine.<br>
 Earth's keys to thee, illustrious king belong,  <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">7</font></a><br>
 Its secret gates unlocking, deep and strong.<br>
 'Tis thine, abundant annual fruits to bear,<br>
 For needy mortals are thy constant care. 10</p>
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>
 <p>To thee, great king, Avernus is assign'd,<br>
 The seat of Gods, and basis of mankind.<br>
 Thy throne is fix'd in Hade's dismal plains,<br>
 Distant, unknown to rest, where darkness reigns;<br>
 Where, destitute of breath, pale spectres dwell, 15<br>
 In endless, dire, inexorable hell;<br>
 And in dread Acheron, whose depths obscure,<br>
 Earth's stable roots eternally secure.<br>
 O mighty dæmon, whose decision dread,<br>
 The future fate determines of the dead, 20<br>
 With captive Proserpine, thro' grassy plains,<br>
 Drawn in a four-yok'd car with loosen'd reins,<br>
 Rapt o'er the deep, impell'd by love, you flew<br>
 'Till Eleusina's city rose to view;<br>
 There, in a wond'rous cave obscure and deep, 25<br>
 The sacred maid secure from search you keep,<br>
 The cave of Atthis, whose wide gates display<br>
 An entrance to the kingdoms void of day.<br>
 Of unapparent works, thou art alone<br>
 The dispensator, visible and known. 30<br>
 O pow'r all-ruling, holy, honor'd light,<br>
 Thee sacred poets and their hymns delight:<br>
 Propitious to thy mystic's works incline,<br>
 Rejoicing come, for holy rites are thine.</p>
