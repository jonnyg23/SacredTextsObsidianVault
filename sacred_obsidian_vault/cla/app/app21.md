 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alcmaeôn</span> of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crotôn</span> was in his prime at the beginning of the fifth century B.C.</p>  
 <p>He wrote a book on Natural Science.</p>  
 <p>1. Alcmaeon of Croton, son of Peirithous, said the following to Brotinus and Leon and Bathyllus: concerning things unseen, (<i>as</i>) concerning things mortal, the gods have certainty, whereas to us as men conjecture (<i>only is possible</i>).</p>  
 <p>Ia. Man differs from the other (<i>creatures</i>) in that he alone understands; the others perceive, but do not understand.</p>  
 <p>2. Men perish because they cannot join the beginning to the end.</p>  
 <p>3. (<i>In mules, the males are sterile because of the fineness and coldness of the seed, and the females because their wombs do not open</i>).</p>  
 <p>4. <i>Health is the</i> equality of rights <i>of the functions, wet-dry, cold-hot, bitter-sweet and the rest; but</i> single rule <i>among them causes disease; the single rule of either pair is deleterious. Disease</i> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>occurs sometimes from an internal cause such as excess of heat or cold, sometimes from an external cause such as excess or deficiency of food, sometimes in a certain part, such as blood, marrow or brain; but these parts also are sometimes affected by external causes, such as certain waters or a particular site or fatigue or constraint or similar reasons. But</i> health is the harmonious mixture of the qualities.</p>  
 <p>5. It is easier to guard against an enemy than against a friend.</p>
