 <p>The Sun's resplendent deity I sing,<br>
 The beauteous offspring of almighty Jove,<br>
 Who, thro' the vivifying solar fount<br>
 Within his fabricative mind conceal'd,<br>
 A triad form'd of splendid solar gods;<br>
 From whence the world's all-various forms emerg'd<br>
 From mystic darkness into beauteous light,<br>
 Perfect, and full of intellectual goods.<br>
 Hail! Supermundane king of light divine,<br>
 And fairest image of the unknown good:<br>
 For, as the light proceeding from <i>the one</i>,<br>
 The god of gods, and beauty's matchless flower,<br>
 Intelligibles, with deific rays<br>
 Occult, illumes; so from Apollo's beams<br>
 Exulting glorious through harmonic power,<br>
 The mental world with elevating light<br>
 Is fill'd exub'rant: and th' apparent Sun<br>
 Largely diffuses thro' the world of sense,<br>
 Light, all-prolific, beautiful, divine.<br>
 To thee, as bright Apollo, it belongs<br>
 All multitude in union to collect,<br>
 And many natures generate from one;<br>
 With vigour in thy essence to convolve<br>
 The diff'rent ranks of secondary forms;<br>
 And thro' one fair hyparxis <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">2</font></a> to combine</p></dir>

 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>All-various essences and fertile powers.<br>
 'Tis thine, from multitude exempt, t' inspire<br>
 In forms subordinate, prophetic truth;<br>
 For <i>truth</i> and <i>pure simplicity</i> are one:<br>
 And of preserving unpolluted power,<br>
 Thy <i>liberated</i> essence is the source.<br>
 Fam'd mystic bards of old, in sacred song,<br>
 By thee inspir'd, as th' <i>arrow-darting</i> god,<br>
 Constant invok'd thee, with resistless sway,<br>
 Because thy vig'rous beams like arrows pierce,<br>
 And totally, whate'er of measure void the world<br>
 Inordinate or dark contains, destroy.<br>
 And last, thy revolution is the sign<br>
 Of motion, harmonizing into one<br>
 The various natures of this mighty whole.<br>
 Thy <i>first</i> bright <i>Monad</i> <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">1</font></a> hence, illustrious god,<br>
 Enunciates truth and intellectual light;<br>
 That light, which in the essence of the gods,<br>
 Subsists with rays uniting and unknown.<br>
 Thy <i>second</i> <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">2</font></a>, ev'ry thing confus'd destroys:<br>
 And from thy <i>third</i> <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the universe is bound<br>
 In beauteous symmetry and just consent,<br>
 Thro' splendid reasons and harmonic power.<br>
 Add, that thy essence, 'midst the mundane gods,<br>
 A super-mundane order is assign'd;<br>
 An unbegotten and supreme command<br>
 O'er all the ranks of generated forms;<br>
 And In the ever-flowing realms of sense,<br>
 An intellectual dignity of sway.<br>
 Progression two-fold, hence, to thee belongs,--<br>
 One in conjunction with the mundane gods,<br>
 The other supernat'ral and unknown:<br>
 For when the Demiurgus form'd the world,<br>
 He kindled in the solar sphere a light,<br>
 Unlike the splendour of the other orbs,<br>
 Drawn from his nature's most occult retreats,<br>
 A symbol fair of intellectual forms;<br>
 And openly announcing as it shines<br>
 To ev'ry part of this amazing whole,<br>
 The essence solitary and arcane</p></dir>

 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Of all the ruling, supermundane gods.<br>
 Hence too, when first thy beams the world adorn'd<br>
 The mundane gods were ravish'd at the sight;<br>
 And round thy orb, with emulative zeal<br>
 And symphony divine, desir'd to dance,<br>
 And draw abundant from thy fontal light.<br>
 'Tie thine by heat apparent to exalt<br>
 Corporeal natures from the sluggish earth,<br>
 Inspiring vivid, vegetative power;<br>
 And by a nature secretly divine,<br>
 And from the base alloy of matter free,<br>
 Inherent in thy all-productive rays,<br>
 Thou draw'st to union with thy wond'rous form,<br>
 Exalted souls, that In dark Hyle's realms<br>
 Indignant struggle for the courts of. light:<br>
 All beauteous, <i>seven-rayed</i>, supermundane god!<br>
 Whose mystic essence secretly emits<br>
 The splendid fountains of celestial light.<br>
 For 'midst the ruling, super-mundane gods<br>
 A solar world, and total light subsists;<br>
 A light, which as a fertile monad shines<br>
 Superior to the three corporeal worlds.<br>
 By sacred Oracles of old, 'tie said,<br>
 Thy glorious orb beyond the starry sphere<br>
 And in the last etherial world revolves.<br>
 But in thy course, harmoniously divine,<br>
 Thy orb, quadruply intersects these worlds;<br>
 And then twelve powers of radiant gods displays,<br>
 Thro' twelve divisions of the zone oblique.<br>
 And still abundant in productive might,<br>
 Each into three of diff'rent ranks divides.<br>
 Hence, from the fourfold elegance and grace<br>
 Of times and seasons, by thy course produc'd,<br>
 Mankind a triple benefit receive,<br>
 The circling Graces' never-failing gift.<br>
 All-bounteous god, by whom the soul is freed<br>
 Prom Generation's dark corporeal bands,<br>
 Assist THY OFFSPRING, borne on mental wings,<br>
 Beyond the reach of guileful Nature's hands<br>
 Swift to ascend, and gain thy beauteous world.<br>
 The subtle vestment of my soul refine,<br>
 Etherial, firm, and full of sacred light,<br>
 Her ancient vehicle by thee assign'd;<br>
 In which invelop'd, thro' the starry orbs,<br>
 Urg'd' by the Impulse of insane desire,</p></dir>

 <p>She fail'd precipitate, till Lethe's shore,<br>
 Involv'd in night, unhappily she touch'd,<br>
 And lost all knowledge of her pristine state:<br>
 O best of gods, blest dæmon crown'd with fire,<br>
 My soul's sure refuge in the hour of woe,<br>
 My port paternal in the courts of light,<br>
 Hear, and from punishment my soul absolve,<br>
 The punishment incurr'd by pristine guilt,<br>
 Thro' Lethe's darkness and terrene desire:<br>
 And if for long-extended years I'm doom'd<br>
 In these drear realms Heav'n's exile to remain,<br>
 Oh! grant me soon the necessary means<br>
 To gain that good which solitude confers<br>
 On souls emerging from the bitter waves<br>
 Of fraudful Hyle's black, impetuous flood.<br>
 That thus retiring from the vulgar herd,<br>
 And <i>impious converse of the present age</i>,<br>
 My soul may triumph o'er her natal ills;<br>
 And oft with thee In blissful union join'd<br>
 Thro' energy Ineffable, may soar<br>
 Beyond the highest super-mundane forms;<br>
 And in the vestibule supreme survey,<br>
 Emerging from th' intelligible deep,<br>
 Beauty's transcendent, solitary Sun.</p></dir>
