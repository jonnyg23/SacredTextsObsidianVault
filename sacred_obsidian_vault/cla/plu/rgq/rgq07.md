 <p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">50-59.</font></p>  
 <p>50. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> did the priest of Jupiter (<i>Flamen Dialis</i>) resign his office if his wife died, as Ateius has recorded? <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">a</font></a></p>  
 <p>Is it because the man who has taken a wife and then lost her is more unfortunate than one who has never taken a wife? For the house of the married man is complete, but the house of him who has married and later lost his wife is not only incomplete, but also crippled.</p>  
 <p>Or is it because the wife assists her husband in the rites, so that many of them cannot be performed without the wife's presence, and for a man who has lost his wife to marry again immediately is neither possible perhaps nor otherwise seemly? Wherefore it was formerly illegal for the <i>flamen</i> to divorce his wife; and it is still, as it seems, illegal, but in my day Domitian once permitted it on petition. The priests were present at that ceremony of divorce and performed many horrible, strange, and gloomy rites. <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">b</font></a></p>  
 <p>One might be less surprised at this resignation of the <i>flamen</i> if one should adduce also the fact that when one of the censors died, the other was obliged to resign his office <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">c</font></a>; but when the censor Livius Drusus died, his colleague Aemilius Scaurus was unwilling to give up his office until certain tribunes ordered him to be led away to prison.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>51. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> is a dog placed beside the Lares that men call by the special name of <i>praestites</i>, and why are the Lares themselves clad in dog-skins? <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">d</font></a></p>  
 <p>Is it because "those that stand before" are termed</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a> <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>praestites</i>, and, also because it is fitting that those who stand before a house should be its guardians, terrifying to strangers, but gentle and mild to the inmates, even as a dog is?</p>  
 <p>Or is the truth rather, as some Romans affirm, that, just as the philosophic school of Chrysippus <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">a</font></a> think that evil spirits stalk about whom the gods use as executioners and avengers upon unholy and unjust men, even so the Lares are spirits of punishment like the Furies and supervisors of men's lives and houses? Wherefore they are clothed in the skins of dogs and have a dog as their attendant, in the belief that they are skilful in tracking down and following up evil-doers.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>52. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> do they sacrifice a bitch to the goddess called Geneta Mana <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">b</font></a> and pray that none of the household shall become "good"?</p>  
 <p>Is it because Geneta is a spirit concerned with the generation and birth of beings that perish? Her name means some such thing as "flux and birth" or "flowing birth." <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">c</font></a> Accordingly, just as the Greeks sacrifice a bitch to Hecatê, <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">d</font></a> even so do the Romans offer the same sacrifice to Geneta on behalf of the members of their household. But Socrates <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">e</font></a> says that the Argives sacrifice a bitch to Eilioneia by reason of the ease with which the bitch brings forth its young. But does the import of the prayer, that none of them shall become "good," refer not to the human members of a household, but to the dogs? For dogs should be savage and terrifying.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a> <a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or, because of the fact that the dead are gracefully called "the good," are they in veiled language asking in their prayer that none of their household may die? One should not be surprised at this; Aristotle <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">a</font></a> in fact, says that there is written in the treaty of the Arcadians with the Spartans: "No one shall be made good <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">b</font></a> for rendering aid to the Spartan party in Tegea"; that is, no one shall be put to death.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>53. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> do they even now, at the celebration of the Capitoline games, proclaim "Sardians for sale!", <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">c</font></a> and why is an old man led forth in derision, wearing around his neck a child's amulet which they call a <i>bulla</i> <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">d</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>Is it because the Etruscans called Veians fought against Romulus for a long time, and he took this city last of all <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">e</font></a> and sold at auction many captives together with their king, taunting him for his stupidity and folly? But since the Etruscans were originally Lydians, and Sardis was the capital city of the Lydians, they offered the Veians for sale under this name; and even to this day they preserve the custom in sport.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>54. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> do they call the meat-markets <i>macella</i> and <i>macellae</i>?</p>  
 <p>Is this word corrupted from <i>mageiroi</i> (cooks) and has it prevailed, as many others have, by force of habit? For <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> have a close relationship in</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Latin, and it was only after many years that they made use of <i>g</i>, which Spurius Carvilius <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">a</font></a> introduced. And <i>l</i>, again, is substituted lispingly for <i>r</i> when people make a slip in the pronunciation of <i>r</i> because of the indistinctness of their enunciation.</p>  
 <p>Or must this problem also be solved by history? For the story goes that there once lived in Rome a violent man, a robber, Macellus by name, who despoiled many people and was with great difficulty caught and punished; from his wealth the public meat-market was built, and it acquired its name from him.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>55. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> is it that on the Ides of January the flute-players are allowed to walk about the city wearing the raiment of women <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">b</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>Is it for the reason commonly alleged? They used to enjoy, as it seems, great honours, which King Numa had given them by reason of his piety towards the gods. Because they were later deprived of these honours by the <i>decemviri</i>, who were invested with consular power, <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">c</font></a> they withdrew from the city. There was, accordingly, inquiry made for them, and a certain superstitious fear seized upon the priests when they sacrificed without flutes. But when the flute-players would not hearken to those sent to summon them to return, but remained in Tibur, a freedman secretly promised the officials to bring them back. On the pretext of having sacrificed to the gods, he prepared a sumptuous banquet and invited the flute-players. Women were present, as well as wine, and a party lasting all the night was being celebrated with merriment and dancing, when</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></a> <a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>suddenly the freedman interrupted, saying that his patron was coming to see him, and, in his perturbation, he persuaded the flute-players to climb into wagons, which were screened round about with skins, to be conveyed back to Tibur. But this was a trick, for he turned the wagons around, and, without being detected, since the flute-players comprehended nothing because of the wine and the darkness, at dawn he had brought them all to Rome. Now the majority of them happened to be clad in raiment of feminine finery because of the nocturnal drinking-bout; when, therefore, they had been persuaded and reconciled by the officials, it became their custom on that day to strut through the city clad in this manner.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>56. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> are the matrons supposed to have founded the temple of Carmenta originally, and why do they reverence it now above all others?</p>  
 <p>There is a certain tale repeated that the women were prevented by the senate from using horse-drawn vehicles <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">a</font></a>; they therefore made an agreement with one another not to conceive nor to bear children, and they kept their husbands at a distance, until the husbands changed their minds and made the concession to them. When children were born to them, they, as mothers of a fair and numerous progeny, founded the temple of Carmenta.</p>  
 <p>Some assert that Carmenta was the mother of Evander and that she came to Italy; that her name was Themis, or, as others say, Nicostratê; and that because she chanted oracles in verse, she was named Carmenta by the Latins, for they call verses <i>carmina</i>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></a> <a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></a></p>  
 <p>But others think that Carmenta is a Fate, and that this is the reason why the matrons sacrifice to her. The true meaning of the name is "deprived of sense," <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">a</font></a> by reason of her divine transports. Wherefore Carmenta was not so named from <i>carmina</i>, but rather <i>carmina</i> from her, because, in her divine frenzy, she chanted oracles in verse and metre. <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">b</font></a></p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>57. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> do the women that sacrifice to Rumina pour milk over the offerings, but make no oblation of wine in the ceremony?</p>  
 <p>Is it because the Latins call the teat <i>ruma</i>, and assert that Ruminalis <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">c</font></a> acquired its name inasmuch as the she-wolf offered its teat to Romulus? Therefore, as we call wet-nurses <i>thelonai</i> from <i>thele</i> (teat), even so Rumina is she that gives suck, the nurse and nurturer of children; she does not, therefore, welcome pure wine, since it is harmful for babes.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>58. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> did they use to address some of the senators as Conscript Fathers, others merely as Fathers? <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">d</font></a></p>  
 <p>Is it because they used to call those senators originally assigned to that body by Romulus fathers and patricians, that is to say "well-born," since they could point out their fathers, <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">e</font></a> while they called those who were later enrolled from the commoners conscript fathers?</p>  
 <p>

 <p>59. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> did Hercules and the Muses have an altar in common?</p>  
 <p>Is it because Hercules taught Evander's people the use of letters, as Juba <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">a</font></a> has recorded? And this action was held to be noble on the part of men who taught their friends and relatives. It was a long time before they began to teach for pay, and the first to open an elementary school was Spurius Carvilius, <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">b</font></a> a freedman of the Carvilius <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">c</font></a> who was the first to divorce his wife.</p>
