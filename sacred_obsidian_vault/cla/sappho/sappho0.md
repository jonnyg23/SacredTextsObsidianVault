 <p>Immortal Aphrodite of the shimmering thone, daughter of Zeus,
 weaver of wiles, I pray thee crush not my spirit with anguish
 and distress, O Queen.  But come hither if ever before thou didst
 hear my voice afar, and hearken, and leaving the golden house of
 thy father, camest with chariot yoked, and swift birds drew thee,
 their swift pinions fluttering over the dark earth, from heaven
 through mid-space. Quickly they arrived; and thou blessed one with
 immortal countenance smiling didst ask: What now is befallen me and
 why now I call and what I in my heart's madness, most desire.
 What fair one now wouldst thou draw to love thee?  Who wrongs thee
 Sappho? For even if she flies she shall soon follow and if she rejects
 gifts, shall soon offer them and if she loves not shall soon love,
 however reluctant. Come I pray thee now and release me from cruel
 cares, and let my heart accomplish all that it desires, and be thou
 my ally.</p>
 
 
 <blockquote>
 <pre>
                  I
 Shimmering-throned immortal Aphrodite,
 Daughter of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee,
 Spare me, O queen, this agony and anguish,
      Crush not my spirit
 
                  II
 Whenever before thou has hearkened to me--
 To my voice calling to thee in the distance,
 And heeding, thou hast come, leaving thy father's
      Golden dominions,
 
                  III
 With chariot yoked to thy fleet-winged coursers,
 Fluttering swift pinions over earth's darkness,
 And bringing thee through the infinite, gliding
      Downwards from heaven,
 
                   IV
 Then, soon they arrived and thou, blessed goddess,
 With divine contenance smiling, didst ask me
 What new woe had befallen me now and why,
      Thus I had called the.
 
                   V
 What in my mad heart was my greatest desire,
 Who was it now that must feel my allurements,
 Who was the fair one that must be persuaded,
      Who wronged thee Sappho?
 
                   VI
 For if now she flees, quickly she shall follow
 And if she spurns gifts, soon shall she offer them
 Yea, if she knows not love, soon shall she feel it
      Even reluctant.
 
                   VII
 Come then, I pray, grant me surcease from sorrow,
 Drive away care, I beseech thee, O goddess
 Fulfil for me what I yearn to accomplish,
      Be thou my ally.

 <p>
 That one seems to me the equal of the gods, who sits in
 thy presence and hears near him thy sweet voice and lovely
 laughter; that indeed makes my heart beat fast in my bosom.
 For when I see thee even a little I am bereft of utterance,
 my tongue is useless and at once a subtle fire races under my
 skin, my eyes see nothing, my ears ring, sweat pours forth
 and all my body is seized with trembling.  I am paler than
 [dried] grass and seem in my madness little better than dead,
 but I must dare all ...

 Peer of the gods, the happiest man I seem
 Sitting before thee, rapt at thy sight, hearing
 Thy soft laughter and they voice most gentle,
      Speaking so sweetly.
 
 
                     II
 
 Then in my bosom my heart wildly flutters,
 And, when on thee I gaze never so little,
 Bereft am I of all power of utterance,
      My tongue is useless.
 
                     III
 
 There rushes at once through my flesh tingling fire,
 My eyes are deprived of all power of vision,
 My ears hear nothing by sounds of winds roaring,
     And all is blackness.
 
                     III
 
 Down courses in streams the sweat of emotion,
 A dread trembling o'erwhelms me, paler than I
 Than dried grass in autumn, and in my madness
     Dead I seem almost.

 With the emendations by Mr. J.M. Edmonds, the reprinting of which he
 has been kind enough to permit, a nearly literal rendering would be as
 follows:
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Some say that the fairest thing upon the dark earth is a host of
 horsemen, and some say a host of foot soldiers, and others again
 a fleet of ships, but for me it is my beloved. And it is easy to
 make anyone understand this. When Helen saw the most beautiful of
 mortals, she chose for best that one, the destroyer of all the honour
 of Troy and though not much of child or dear parent, but was led
 astray by Love, to bestow her heart far off, for woman is ever easy
 to lead astray when she thinks of no account what is near and dear.
 Even so, Anactoria, you do not remember, it seems, when she is with
 you, one the gentle sound of whose footfall I would rather see than
 all the chariots and mail-clad footmen of Lydia. I know that in this
 world man cannot have the best; yet to pray for a part of
 what was once shared is better than to forget it...
 </p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <pre>
                  I
 
 A troop of horse, the serried ranks of marchers,
 A noble fleet, some think these of all on earth
 Most beautiful. For me naught else regarding
     Is my beloved.
 
                  II
 
 To understand this is for all most simple,
 For thus gazing much on mortal perfectino
 And knowing already what life could give her,
      Him chose fair Helen,
 
                  III
 
 Him the betrayer of Ilium's honour.
 The recked she not of adored child or parent,
 But yielded to love, and forced by her passion,
      Dared Fate in exile.
 
                  IV
 
 Thus quickly is bent the will of that woman
 To whom things near and dear seem to be nothing.
 So mightest thou fail, My Anactoria,
     If she were with you.
 
                  V
 
 She whose gentle footfall and radiant face
 Hold the power to charm more than a vision
 Of chariots and the mail-clad battalions
     Of Lydia's army.
 
                  V
 
 So must we learn in world made as this one
 Man can never attain his greatest desire,
 [But must pray for what good fortune Fate holdeth,
      Never unmindful.]

 Athanaeus quotes this to show that there is not necessarily
 any reproach in the word <tt>e?tai'rai</tt>. Like many others,
 the fragment is unfortunately too short for anything but a
 literal translation. The breathing of the word in question
 in Attic Greek would of course be rough.

 <p>But the spirit within them turned chill and down dropped their wings.</p>
 
 <p>
 The Scholist quotes this to show that Sappho says the same thing
 of doves as Pindar (Pyth. 1-10) says of the eagle of Zeus.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Another reading is <tt>psau^kros</tt>, "light", for <tt>psu^xros</tt>,
 "moist or chill."  The sense would then be "the spirit within
 them became light and they relaxed their wings in rest."

 and in Greek both words are beautiful in sound.
