 <p>Πλήρησ μὲν ἐφαίνετ᾽ ἀ σελάννα<br>
 αἰ δ᾽ ὠσ περὶ Βῶμον ἐσταθησαν. <font size="1"><a href="xlatall.htm#71">[transcription]</a></font>
 </p>
 <p>The moon rose full, and as around an altar, stood the women.</p>
 <p>Now rose the moon, full and argentine,<br>
 While round stood the maidens, as at a shrine.</p>
 <p>Quoted by Hephaestion as an example of the metre known as the Ionic <i>a majore</i> trimeter brachycatalectic. Poetically the figure is a fine one, and shows Sappho's wonderful power of visualizing a scene in a few unerringly chosen words. The moon and its light had a great attraction for her, as a number of fragments shows.</p>
