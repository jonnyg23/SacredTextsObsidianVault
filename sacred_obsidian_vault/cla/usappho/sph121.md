 <p>Himerius, apparently quoting, says "Thou are the evening star, of all stars the fairest I think," and he says that the line comes from Sappho's song to Hesperus. Again, he says, quoting: "Now thou didst appear like that fairest of all stars; for the Athenians call thee, Hesperus."</p>
 <p>Himerius also refers to an ode which was apparently an imitation of the work of Sappho. The ode has been transcribed by J.A. Symonds.</p>
