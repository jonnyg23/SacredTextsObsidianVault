 <p>Στᾶθι κἄντα φίλοσ,....<br>
 καὶ τὰν ἔπ᾽ ὄσσοισ ἀμπέτασον χάριν. <font size="1"><a href="xlatall.htm#47">[transcription]</a></font>
 </p>
 <p>Face me, my dear one...and unveil the grace in thine eyes.</p>
 <p>Turn to me, dear one, turn thy face,<br>
 And unveil for me in thine eyes, their grace.</p>
 <p>Athenaeus says that Sappho addressed this poem, of which this is a fragment, to a man famous for his physical beauty. It has also been suggested that the lines may have been addressed to Sappho's brother. It need not, however, necessarily be assumed that any particular person is meant.</p>
