 <h3 align="CENTER">LITTLE PHANION</h3>
 <p>Stranger, stop, look who is signalling you: 'tis little Phanion of Kôs, she is well worth your choice.</p>
 <p>See, her hair is curled like parsley, her skin is soft as the down of a woodland bird. She is small and brown. And she converses well.</p>
 <p>If you should follow her, she would not ask you all your voyage-money; no, just a drachma or a pair of sandals.</p>
 <p>You'll find she has a good bed in her house, fresh figs and milk and wine, and if it should be cold there'll be a fire.</p>
