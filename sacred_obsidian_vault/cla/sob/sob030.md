 <h3 align="CENTER">GAME OF DICE</h3>
 <p>Since both of us adored him, we engaged to play a game of dice for him. That was a famous party. Many maidens watched most anxiously.</p>
 <p>She led off with the Cyclops throw, and I cast the Solon. Then she threw Kallibolos, and I, sensing my defeat, besought the Goddess.</p>
 <p>I played, I threw Epiphenon, she the high cast of Kios; I the Antiteukos and she the Trikias; and then I threw the cast of Aphrodite which wins the cherished lover.</p>
 <p>The girl grew pale; I clasped her by the neck and whispered in her ear (that no one else might know), "Don't cry, my friend, we'll let him choose between us."</p>
