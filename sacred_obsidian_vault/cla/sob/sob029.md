 <h3 align="CENTER">PRAYER TO PERSEPHONE</h3>
 <p>Cleansed by the ritual ablutions and clothed in violet robes, we droop our olive branches to the earth.</p>
 <p>"Oh, underworld Persephone, whatever be the name that thou desirest, if this name pleases thee, oh, hear our prayer, Crowned with Shadows, barren smile-less Queen!</p>
 <p>"Koklis, daughter of Thrasymakos, is lying at thy door. Pray do not call her yet; thou knowest she cannot fly from thee for ever; but take her later, call some other day.</p>
 <p>"Oh, bear her not away so soon, Invisible Mistress! For she bewails her virginity, she supplicates thee through our prayers; to save her we will give our three black sheep, unshorn."</p>
