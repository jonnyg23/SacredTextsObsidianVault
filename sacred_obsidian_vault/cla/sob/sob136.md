 <p>I shiver, the night is chill and the woods are wet. Why have you brought me here? isn't my big bed softer than all this pebble-studded moss?</p>
 <p>My flowery robe will get all grass-stained and my hair all tangled up with little twigs; my elbow, look at my elbow, how dirty it is already with wet earth.</p>
 <p>One time, however, I used to follow <i>him</i> into the wood. . . Ah! leave me awhile. I am sad this evening. Don't speak, just leave me, hands upon my eyes.</p>
 <p>Really, can't you wait! are we brute beasts for you to take us so I Leave me alone. You shall not open my lips nor yet my knees. For fear of crying, my very eyes are closed.</p>
