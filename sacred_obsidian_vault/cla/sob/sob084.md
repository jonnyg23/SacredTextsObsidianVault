 <h3 align="CENTER">MNASIDIKA'S SILENCE</h3>
 <p>All day she laughed and even mocked at me a little. She refused to obey me, in the presence of some strangers.</p>
 <p>When we had come home again I affected not to speak to her, and when she threw her arms about my neck, saying: "Are you angry?" I said to her:</p>
 <p>"Ah! you are no longer as you used to be, you are no longer like the first day. I do not recognize you any more, Mnasidika." She did not answer me.</p>
 <p>But she put on all her jewels, the jewels that she had not worn for long, and even the blue-embroidered yellow robe she had not worn since the day of our first meeting.</p>
