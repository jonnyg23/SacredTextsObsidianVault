 <h3 align="CENTER">BARE FEET</h3>
 <p>I have long black hair down my back, and a little round cap. My frock is of white wool. My sturdy legs are browning in the sun.</p>
 <p>If I lived in town I should have golden trinkets and gold-embroidered frocks and silver slippers. . . I look at my naked feet in their slippers of dust.</p>
 <p>Psophis! come here, little creature! carry me to the brook, bathe my feet in your hands, and press some olives with some violets, to scent them among the flowers.</p>
 <p>Today you shall be my slave; you shall follow me and serve me, and at the end of the day I will give you some lentils from my own garden . . . to give your mother.</p>
