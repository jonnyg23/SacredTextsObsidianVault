 <p>When he came back, I hid my face within my hands. He said: "Fear nothing. Who has seen our kiss? --Who saw us? The night and the moon."</p>
 <p>"And the stars and the first flush of dawn. The moon has seen its visage in the lake, and told it to the water 'neath the willows. The water told it to the rower's oar.</p>
 <p>"And the oar has told it to the boat, and the boat has passed the secret to the fisher. Alas! alas! if that were only all! But the fisher told the secret to a woman.</p>
 <p>"The fisher told the secret to a woman: my father and my mother and my sisters, and all of Hellas now shall know the tale."</p>
