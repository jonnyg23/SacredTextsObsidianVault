 <h3 align="CENTER">THE JUGGLERESS</h3>
 <p>When the rays of dawn were mingling with the feeble torches' glow, I had a dissolute, nimble flutist join the orgy; she trembled slightly, being slightly cold.</p>
 <p>Praise the little purple-lidded girl, with short hair and impertinent sharp breasts, clothed solely in a girdle hung with jet-black iris-stems and yellow ribbons.</p>
 <p>Praise her! for she was clever and performed trying feats of skill. She juggled hoops and did not break a thing, and hopped right through them like a grasshopper.</p>
 <p>Sometimes she walked on hands and feet, making a wheel of them. Or better,. legs in air and knees apart, she bent far back and laughing touched the earth.</p>
