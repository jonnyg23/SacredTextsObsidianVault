 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SLEEPER</h3>
 <p>She sleeps in her undone hair, her hands entwined behind her neck. But does she dream? Her lips are parted and her breath is gentle.</p>
 <p>With a little dab of down I dry, without awakening her, the perspiration from her arms, the fever from her cheeks. Her closed eyelids are two purple flowers.</p>
 <p>I shall arise quietly; I'll go draw water, milk the cow, and beg some fire from our neighbors. I want to be coiffed and dressed completely when she opens her eyes.</p>
 <p>Sleep, remain awhile between her lovely curving lashes, and spin out the happy night with a dream of happy omen.</p>
