 <h3 align="CENTER">AWAKENING</h3>
 <p>It is already daylight. I should have long arisen. But morning sleep is sweet, and the warmth of the bed keeps me snuggled up. I want to stay still longer.</p>
 <p>Soon I'll go to the stable. I'll give grass and flowers to the goats, and a skin of fresh water, drawn from the well; and I shall drink out of it just as they.</p>
 <p>Then I'll tie them to the post and draw the milk from their warm udders; and, if the kids are not jealous, we all shall suck the soft teats together.</p>
 <p>Did not Amalthea <a href="sob154.htm#xref_29"><font size="1">29</font></a> give suck to Zeus? Then I shall go. But not yet. The sun arose too soon, and mother has not yet awakened.</p>
