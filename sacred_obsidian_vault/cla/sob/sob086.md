 <h3 align="CENTER">WAITING</h3>
 <p>The sun spent all the night in the country of the dead, while I have waited, seated on my bed, fatigued from having stayed so long awake. The wick of the exhausted lamp has burned until the end.</p>
 <p>She will not come: there is the last star. How well I know that she will come no more. I even know the very name I hate. And still I wait.</p>
 <p>Let her come now! yes, let her come, her hair undone, ungarlanded, her dresses soiled and spotted, rumpled up, her tongue dry and her eyelids black!</p>
 <p>As soon as she opens the door I'll say to her . . . but there she is. . . It is her dress I touch, her hands, her hair, her skin! I kiss her with a maddened mouth, and weep.</p>
