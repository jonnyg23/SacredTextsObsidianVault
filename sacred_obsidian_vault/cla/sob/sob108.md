 <h3 align="CENTER">JEWELS</h3>
 <p>A diadem of pierced gold crowns my white and narrow forehead. Five golden chainlets, hung from cheek to cheek, swing from my hair by two large golden hasps.</p>
 <p>Upon my arms, which Iris <a href="sob154.htm#xref_130"><font size="1">130</font></a> herself would envy, thirteen silver bracelets rise in tiers. How heavy they are! But these are weapons; I know an enemy who has felt their weight.</p>
 <p>I am truly clothed in gold. My breasts are cased beneath two golden plates. The statues of the gods are not all as rich as I am.</p>
 <p>And I wear about my heavy robe, a girdle worked with silver. You can read these verses on it: "Love me always; but do not be unhappy if I should deceive you thrice a day."</p>
