 <h3 align="CENTER">TO GYRINNO</h3>
 <p>Do not think that I have loved you. I have eaten you like a ripe fig, and drunk you like a draught of burning water, and worn you about me like a girdle of flesh.</p>
 <p>I have amused myself with you, because you have short hair and pointed breasts upon your slender body, and nipples black as little dates.</p>
 <p>As one must have fruits and water, a woman also sates a living thirst; but already I no longer know your name, you who have lain within my arms like the shade of another loved one.</p>
 <p>Between your flesh and mine a burning dream has claimed me for its own. I pressed you on me as upon a wound, and cried: "Mnasidika! Mnasidika! Mnasidika!"</p>
