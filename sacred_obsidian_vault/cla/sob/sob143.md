 <p>He sleeps. I do not know him. He horrifies me. However, his purse is full of gold, and he gave the slave four drachmae when he entered. I expect a mina for myself.</p>
 <p>But I told the Phrygian to go to bed in my place. He was drunk and took her for me. I had rather die in torment than stretch myself alongside of this man.</p>

 <p>What would I not have done to have obtained that which I have refused tonight! Today my breasts are drooping, and in my worn-out heart Eros falls asleep from weariness.</p>
