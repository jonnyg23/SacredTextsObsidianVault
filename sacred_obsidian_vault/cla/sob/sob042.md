 <h3 align="CENTER">THE LOST LETTER</h3>
 <p>Alas, for me! for I have lost his letter. I had placed it 'twixt my skin and my strophion, <a href="sob154.htm#xref_61"><font size="1">61</font></a> beneath the shielding warmth of my breast. I ran, it must have fallen out.</p>
 <p>I shall return upon my homeward path; should someone find it he would tell my mother, and I'd be whipped before my mocking sisters.</p>
 <p>If a man has found it he will give it to me; or even if he cares to speak to me in secret, I know the way to ravish him of it.</p>
 <p>But should a woman once have gazed upon it, oh, Guardian Zeus protect me! for I know she'd tell the tale to everyone, or else I'm sure she'd steal my lover from me.</p>
