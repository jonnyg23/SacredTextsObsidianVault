 <h3 align="CENTER">SEA-SIDE PROMENADE</h3>
 <p>As we were walking on the shore, unspeaking, wrapped to the chin in our dark woolen robes, some happy young girls passed by.</p>
 <p>"Ah! it's Bilitis and Mnasidika! See the lovely little squirrel that we caught: it is soft as a bird and frightened as a rabbit.</p>
 <p>"At Lydia's house we'll put it in a cage, and give it lots of milk and salad-leaves. It's female, and will live a long long time."</p>
 <p>And the mad little creatures ran along. But we, unspeaking, sat upon the beach, I on a rock and she upon the sand, and we looked far out to sea.</p>
