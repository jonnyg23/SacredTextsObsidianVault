 <h3 align="CENTER">FIRST EPITAPH</h3>
 <p>In the land where the rivers are born from the sea, and the beds of the streams made of fine flakes of quartz, I, Bilitis, was born.</p>
 <p>My mother was Phoenician, my father Damophylos, Hellenic. My mother taught me the sad songs of Byblos, sad as the coming of dawn.</p>
 <p>I adored Astarte at Kypros. I knew Psappha at Lesbos. I have sung of how I have loved. If I have lived well, Passer-by, tell your daughter.</p>
 <p>And do not sacrifice the black goat in my memory; but, as a sweet libation, squeeze her soft dug o'er my tomb.</p>
