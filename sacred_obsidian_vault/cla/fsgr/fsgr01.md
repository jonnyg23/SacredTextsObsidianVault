 <h2>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h2>
 
 <p>Anyone who has been in Greece at Easter time, especially among the more
 remote peasants, must have been struck by the emotion of suspense and
 excitement with which they wait for the announcement "<i>Christos
 anestê</i>," "Christ is risen!" and the response "<i>Alêthôs anestê</i>," "He
 has really risen!" I have referred elsewhere to Mr. Lawson's old peasant
 woman, who explained her anxiety: "If Christ does not rise tomorrow we
 shall have no harvest this year" (<i>Modern Greek Folklore</i>, p. 573). We
 are evidently in the presence of an emotion and a fear which, beneath
 its Christian colouring and, so to speak, transfiguration, is in its
 essence, like most of man's deepest emotions, a relic from a very remote
 pre-Christian past. Every spring was to primitive man a time of terrible
 anxiety. His store of food was near its end. Would the dead world
 revive, or would it not? The Old Year was dead; would the New Year, the
 Young King, born afresh of Sky and Earth, come in the Old King's place
 and bring with him the new growth and the hope of life?</p>
 
 <p>I hardly realized, when writing the earlier editions of this book, how
 central, how omnipresent, this complex of ideas was in ancient Greek
 religion. Attis, Adonis, Osiris, Dionysus, and the rest of the "Year
 Gods" were not eccentric divagations in a religion whose proper worship
 was given to the immortal Olympians; they are different names given <a name="page_vi"><font size="1" color="green">p. vi</font></a> in
 different circumstances to this one being who dies and is born again
 each year, dies old and polluted with past deaths and sins, and is
 reborn young and purified. I have tried to trace this line of tradition
 in an article for the <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i> for June 1951, and
 to show, incidentally, how many of the elements in the Christian
 tradition it has provided, especially those elements which are utterly
 alien from Hebrew monotheism and must, indeed, have shocked every
 orthodox Jew.</p>
 
 <p>The best starting point is the conception of the series of Old Kings,
 each, when the due time comes, dethroned and replaced by his son, the
 Young King, with the help of the Queen Mother; for Gaia or Earth, the
 eternal Wife and Mother of each in turn, is always ready to renew
 herself. The new vegetation God each year is born from the union of the
 Sky-God and the Earth-Mother; or, as in myth and legend the figures
 become personified, he is the Son of a God and a mortal princess.</p>
 
 <p>We all know the sequence of Kings in Hesiod: First Uranus (Sky), King of
 the World, and his wife Gaia (Earth); Uranus reigns till he is dethroned
 by his son Cronos with the help of Gaia; then Cronos and Rhea (Earth)
 reign till Cronos is dethroned by his son Zeus, with the help of Rhea;
 then Zeus reigns till . . . but here the series stops, since, according to
 the orthodox Olympian system, Zeus is the eternal King. But there was
 another system, underlying the Olympian, and it is to that other system
 that the Year-Kings belong. The Olympians are definite persons. They are
 immortal; they do not die and revive; they are not beings who come and
 <a name="page_vii"><font size="1" color="green">p. vii</font></a> go, in succession to one another. In the other series are the
 Attis-Adonis-Osiris type of gods, and especially Dionysus, whose name
 has been shown by Kretschmer to be simply the Thracian <i>Deos</i> or <i>Dios
 nysos</i>, "Zeus-Young" or "Zeus-the-son." And in the Orphic tradition it
 is laid down that Zeus yields up his power to Dionysus and bids all the
 gods of the Cosmos obey him. The mother of Dionysus was Semelê, a name
 which, like Gaia and Rhea, means "Earth." The series is not only
 continuous but infinite; for on one side Uranus (Sky) was himself the
 son of Gaia the eternal, and on the other, every year a Zeus was
 succeeded by a "Young Zeus."</p>
 
 <p>The Young King, bearer of spring and the new summer, is the Saviour of
 the Earth, made cold and lifeless by winter and doomed to barrenness by
 all the pollutions of the past; the Saviour also of mankind from all
 kinds of evils, and bringer of a new <i>Aion</i>, or Age, to the world.
 Innumerable different figures in Greek mythology are personifications of
 him, from Dionysus and Heracles to the Dioscuri and many heroes of myth.
 He bears certain distinguishing marks. He is always the son of a God and
 a mortal princess. The mother is always persecuted, a <i>mater dolorosa</i>,
 and rescued by her son. The Son is always a Saviour; very often a
 champion who saves his people from enemies or monsters; but sometimes a
 Healer of the Sick, like Asclepius; sometimes, like Dionysus, a priest
 or hierophant with a <i>thiasos</i>, or band of worshippers; sometimes a
 King's Son who is sacrificed to save his people, and mystically
 identified with some sacrificial animal, a lamb, a young bull, a horse
 or a fawn, whose blood has <a name="page_viii"><font size="1" color="green">p. viii</font></a> supernatural power. Sometimes again he is a
 divine or miraculous Babe, for whose birth the whole world has been
 waiting, who will bring his own Age or Kingdom and "make all things
 new." His life is almost always threatened by a cruel king, like Herod,
 but he always escapes. The popularity of the Divine Babe is probably due
 to the very widespread worship of the Egyptian Child-God, Harpocrates.
 Egyptian also is the Virgin-Mother, impregnated by the holy <i>Pneuma</i> or
 <i>Spiritus</i> of the god, or sometimes by the laying on of his hand.</p>
 
 <p>Besides the ordinary death and rebirth of the vegetation year god, the
 general conclusion to which these considerations point has many
 parallels elsewhere. Our own religious ideas are subject to the same
 tendencies as those of other civilizations. Men and women, when
 converted to a new religion or instructed in some new and unaccustomed
 knowledge, are extremely unwilling, and sometimes absolutely unable, to
 give up their old magical or religious practices and habits of thought.
 When African negroes are converted to Christianity and forbidden to
 practise their tribal magic, they are apt to steal away into the depths
 of the forest and do secretly what they have always considered necessary
 to ensure a good harvest. Not to do so would be too great a risk. When
 Goths were "converted by battalions" the change must have been more in
 names than in substance. When Greeks of the Mediterranean were forbidden
 to say prayers to a figure of Helios, the Sun, it was not difficult to
 call him the prophet Elias and go on with the same prayers and hopes.
 Not difficult to continue your prayers to <a name="page_ix"><font size="1" color="green">p. ix</font></a> the age-old Mother Goddess of
 all Mediterranean peoples, while calling her Mary, the Mother of Christ.
 Eusebius studied the subject, somewhat superficially, in his
 <i>Praeparatio Evangelica</i>, in which he argued that much old pagan belief
 was to be explained as an imperfect preparation for the full light of
 the Gospel. And it is certainly striking how the Anatolian peoples,
 among whom the seed of the early Church was chiefly sown, could never,
 in spite of Jewish monotheism, give up the beloved Mother Goddess for
 whom mankind craves, or the divine "Faithful Son" who will by his own
 sacrifice save his people. Where scientific knowledge fails man cannot
 but be guided by his felt needs and longings and aspirations.</p>
 
 <p>The elements in Christianity which derive from what Jews called "<i>the
 Gôyim</i>" or "nations" beyond the pale, seem to be far deeper and more
 numerous than those which come unchanged from Judaism. Even the Sabbath
 had to be changed, and the birthday of Jesus conformed to that of the
 Sun. Judaism contributed a strong, though not quite successful,
 resistance to polytheism, and a purification of sexual morality. It
 provided perhaps a general antiseptic, which was often needed by the
 passionate gropings of Hellenistic religion, in the stage which I call
 the Failure of Nerve.</p>
