 <h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
 
 <p>In revising the <i>Four Stages of Greek Religion</i> I have found myself
 obliged to change its name. I felt there was a gap in the story. The
 high-water mark of Greek religious thought seems to me to have come just
 between the Olympian Religion and the Failure of Nerve; and the
 decline—if that is the right word—which is observable in the later
 ages of antiquity is a decline not from Olympianism but from the great
 spiritual and intellectual effort of the fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, which
 culminated in the <i>Metaphysics</i> and the <i>De Anima</i> and the foundation of
 the Stoa and the Garden. Consequently I have added a new chapter at this
 point and raised the number of Stages to five.</p>
 
 <p>My friend Mr. E. E. Genner has kindly enabled me to correct two or three
 errors in the first edition, and I owe special thanks to my old pupil,
 Professor E. R. Dodds, for several interesting observations and
 criticisms on points connected with Plotinus and Sallustius. Otherwise I
 have altered little. I am only sorry to have left the book so long out
 of print.</p>
