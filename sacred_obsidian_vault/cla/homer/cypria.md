 Fragment #1 --<br>
 Proclus, Chrestomathia, i:<br>
 This (1) is continued by the epic called "Cypria" which is
 current is eleven books.  Its contents are as follows.
 <p>
 Zeus plans with Themis to bring about the Trojan war.  Strife
 arrives while the gods are feasting at the marriage of Peleus and
 starts a dispute between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite as to which
 of them is fairest.  The three are led by Hermes at the command
 of Zeus to Alexandrus (2) on Mount Ida for his decision, and
 Alexandrus, lured by his promised marriage with Helen, decides in
 favour of Aphrodite.
 </p><p>
 Then Alexandrus builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and
 Helenus foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite order Aeneas
 to sail with him, while Cassandra prophesies as to what will
 happen afterwards.  Alexandrus next lands in Lacedaemon and is
 entertained by the sons of Tyndareus, and afterwards by Menelaus
 in Sparta, where in the course of a feast he gives gifts to
 Helen.
 </p><p>
 After this, Menelaus sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen to
 furnish the guests with all they require until they depart. 
 Meanwhile, Aphrodite brings Helen and Alexandrus together, and
 they, after their union, put very great treasures on board and
 sail away by night.  Hera stirs up a storm against them and they
 are carried to Sidon, where Alexandrus takes the city.  From
 there he sailed to Troy and celebrated his marriage with Helen.
 </p><p>
 In the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle
 of Idas and Lynceus, were caught in the act, and Castor was
 killed by Idas, and Lynceus and Idas by Polydeuces.  Zeus gave
 them immortality every other day.
 </p><p>
 Iris next informs Menelaus of what has happened at his home. 
 Menelaus returns and plans an expedition against Ilium with his
 brother, and then goes on to Nestor.  Nestor in a digression
 tells him how Epopeus was utterly destroyed after seducing the
 daughter of Lycus, and the story of Oedipus, the madness of
 Heracles, and the story of Theseus and Ariadne.  Then they travel
 over Hellas and gather the leaders, detecting Odysseus when he
 pretends to be mad, not wishing to join the expedition, by
 seizing his son Telemachus for punishment at the suggestion of
 Palamedes.
 </p><p>
 All the leaders then meet together at Aulis and sacrifice.  The
 incident of the serpent and the sparrows (2) takes place before
 them, and Calchas foretells what is going to befall.  After this,
 they put out to sea, and reach Teuthrania and sack it, taking it
 for Ilium.  Telephus comes out to the rescue and kills 
 Thersander and son of Polyneices, and is himself wounded by
 Achilles.  As they put out from Mysia a storm comes on them and
 scatters them, and Achilles first puts in at Scyros and married
 Deidameia, the daughter of Lycomedes, and then heals Telephus,
 who had been led by an oracle to go to Argos, so that he might be
 their guide on the voyage to Ilium.
 </p><p>
 When the expedition had mustered a second time at Aulis,
 Agamemnon, while at the chase, shot a stag and boasted that he
 surpassed even Artemis.  At this the goddess was so angry that
 she sent stormy winds and prevented them from sailing.  Calchas
 then told them of the anger of the goddess and bade them
 sacrifice Iphigeneia to Artemis.  This they attempt to do,
 sending to fetch Iphigeneia as though for marriage with Achilles.
 </p><p>
 Artemis, however, snatched her away and transported her to the
 Tauri, making her immortal, and putting a stag in place of the
 girl upon the altar.
 </p><p>
 Next they sail as far as Tenedos: and while they are feasting,
 Philoctetes is bitten by a snake and is left behind in Lemnos
 because of the stench of his sore.  Here, too, Achilles quarrels
 with Agamemnon because he is invited late.  Then the Greeks tried
 to land at Ilium, but the Trojans prevent them, and Protesilaus
 is killed by Hector.  Achilles then kills Cycnus, the son of
 Poseidon, and drives the Trojans back.  The Greeks take up their
 dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of
 Helen and the treasure with her.  The Trojans refusing, they
 first assault the city, and then go out and lay waste the country
 and cities round about.  After this, Achilles desires to see
 Helen, and Aphrodite and Thetis contrive a meeting between them. 
 The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by
 Achilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, and
 sacks Lyrnessus and Pedasus and many of the neighbouring cities,
 and kills Troilus.  Patroclus carries away Lycaon to Lemnos and
 sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives
 Briseis as a prize, and Agamemnon Chryseis.  Then follows the
 death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by
 detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue
 of the Trojan allies.

 Fragment #2 --<br>
 Tzetzes, Chil. xiii. 638:<br>
 Stasinus composed the "Cypria" which the more part say was
 Homer's work and by him given to Stasinus as a dowry with money
 besides.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #3 --<br>
 Scholiast on Homer, Il. i. 5:<br>
 `There was a time when the countless tribes of men, though wide-
 dispersed, oppressed the surface of the deep-bosomed earth, and
 Zeus saw it and had pity and in his wise heart resolved to
 relieve the all-nurturing earth of men by causing the great
 struggle of the Ilian war, that the load of death might empty the
 world.  And so the heroes were slain in Troy, and the plan of
 Zeus came to pass.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #4 --<br>
 Volumina Herculan, II. viii. 105:<br>
 The author of the "Cypria" says that Thetis, to please Hera,
 avoided union with Zeus, at which he was enraged and swore that
 she should be the wife of a mortal.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #5 --<br>
 Scholiast on Homer, Il. xvii. 140:<br>
 For at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the gods gathered
 together on Pelion to feast and brought Peleus gifts.  Cheiron
 gave him a stout ashen shaft which he had cut for a spear, and
 Athena, it is said, polished it, and Hephaestus fitted it with a
 head.  The story is given by the author of the "Cypria".
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #6 --<br>
 Athenaeus, xv. 682 D, F:<br>
 The author of the "Cypria", whether Hegesias or Stasinus,
 mentions flowers used for garlands.  The poet, whoever he was,
 writes as follows in his first book:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-7) `She clothed herself with garments which the Graces and
 Hours had made for her and dyed in flowers of spring -- such
 flowers as the Seasons wear -- in crocus and hyacinth and
 flourishing violet and the rose's lovely bloom, so sweet and
 delicious, and heavenly buds, the flowers of the narcissus and
 lily.  In such perfumed garments is Aphrodite clothed at all
 seasons.
 </p><p>
 ((LACUNA))
 </p><p>
 (ll. 8-12) Then laughter-loving Aphrodite and her handmaidens
 wove sweet-smelling crowns of flowers of the earth and put them
 upon their heads -- the bright-coiffed goddesses, the Nymphs and
 Graces, and golden Aphrodite too, while they sang sweetly on the
 mount of many-fountained Ida.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #7 --<br>
 Clement of Alexandria, Protrept ii. 30. 5:<br>
 `Castor was mortal, and the fate of death was destined for him;
 but Polydeuces, scion of Ares, was immortal.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #8 --<br>
 Athenaeus, viii. 334 B:<br>
 `And after them she bare a third child, Helen, a marvel to men. 
 Rich-tressed Nemesis once gave her birth when she had been joined
 in love with Zeus the king of the gods by harsh violence.  For
 Nemesis tried to escape him and liked not to lie in love with her
 father Zeus the Son of Cronos; for shame and indignation vexed
 her heart: therefore she fled him over the land and fruitless
 dark water.  But Zeus ever pursued and longed in his heart to
 catch her.  Now she took the form of a fish and sped over the
 waves of the loud-roaring sea, and now over Ocean's stream and
 the furthest bounds of Earth, and now she sped over the furrowed
 land, always turning into such dread creatures as the dry land
 nurtures, that she might escape him.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #9 --<br>
 Scholiast on Euripides, Andr. 898:<br>
 The writer (3) of the Cyprian histories says that (Helen's third
 child was) Pleisthenes and that she took him with her to Cyprus,
 and that the child she bore Alexandrus was Aganus.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #10 --<br>
 Herodotus, ii. 117:<br>
 For it is said in the "Cypria" that Alexandrus came with Helen to
 Ilium from Sparta in three days, enjoying a favourable wind and
 calm sea.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #11 --<br>
 Scholiast on Homer, Il. iii. 242:<br>
 For Helen had been previously carried off by Theseus, and it was
 in consequence of this earlier rape that Aphidna, a town in
 Attica, was sacked and Castor was wounded in the right thigh by
 Aphidnus who was king at that time.  Then the Dioscuri, failing
 to find Theseus, sacked Athens.  The story is in the Cyclic
 writers.
 </p><p>
 Plutarch, Thes. 32:<br>
 Hereas relates that Alycus was killed by Theseus himself near
 Aphidna, and quotes the following verses in evidence: `In
 spacious Aphidna Theseus slew him in battle long ago for rich-
 haired Helen's sake.' (4)
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #12 --<br>
 Scholiast on Pindar, Nem. x. 114:<br>
 (ll. 1-6) `Straightway Lynceus, trusting in his swift feet, made
 for Taygetus.  He climbed its highest peak and looked throughout
 the whole isle of Pelops, son of Tantalus; and soon the glorious
 hero with his dread eyes saw horse-taming Castor and athlete
 Polydeuces both hidden within a hollow oak.'
 </p><p>
 Philodemus, On Piety:
 (Stasinus?) writes that Castor was killed with a spear shot by
 Idas the son of Aphareus.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #13 --<br>
 Athenaeus, 35 C:<br>
 `Menelaus, know that the gods made wine the best thing for mortal
 man to scatter cares.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #14 --<br>
 Laurentian Scholiast on Sophocles, Elect. 157:<br>
 Either he follows Homer who spoke of the three daughters of
 Agamemnon, or -- like the writer of the "Cypria" -- he makes them
 four, (distinguishing) Iphigeneia and Iphianassa.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #15 -- (5)<br>
 Contest of Homer and Hesiod:<br>
 `So they feasted all day long, taking nothing from their own
 houses; for Agamemnon, king of men, provided for them.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #16 --<br>
 Louvre Papyrus:<br>
 `I never thought to enrage so terribly the stout heart of
 Achilles, for very well I loved him.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #17 --<br>
 Pausanias, iv. 2. 7:<br>
 The poet of the "Cypria" says that the wife of Protesilaus --
 who, when the Hellenes reached the Trojan shore, first dared to
 land -- was called Polydora, and was the daughter of Meleager,
 the son of Oeneus.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #18 --<br>
 Eustathius, 119. 4:<br>
 Some relate that Chryseis was taken from Hypoplacian (6) Thebes,
 and that she had not taken refuge there nor gone there to
 sacrifice to Artemis, as the author of the "Cypria" states, but
 was simply a fellow townswoman of Andromache.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #19 --<br>
 Pausanias, x. 31. 2:<br>
 I know, because I have read it in the epic "Cypria", that
 Palamedes was drowned when he had gone out fishing, and that it
 was Diomedes and Odysseus who caused his death.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #20 --<br>
 Plato, Euthyphron, 12 A:<br>
 `That it is Zeus who has done this, and brought all these things
 to pass, you do not like to say; for where fear is, there too is
 shame.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #21 --<br>
 Herodian, On Peculiar Diction:<br>
 `By him she conceived and bare the Gorgons, fearful monsters who
 lived in Sarpedon, a rocky island in deep-eddying Oceanus.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #22 --<br>
 Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis vii. 2. 19:<br>
 Again, Stasinus says: `He is a simple man who kills the father
 and lets the children live.'
 </p><p>

 (1)  The preceding part of the Epic Cycle (?).<br>
 (2)  While the Greeks were sacrificing at Aulis, a serpent
      appeared and devoured eight young birds from their nest and
      lastly the mother of the brood.  This was interpreted by
      Calchas to mean that the war would swallow up nine full
      years.  Cp. "Iliad" ii, 299 ff.<br>
 (3)  i.e. Stasinus (or Hegesias: cp. fr. 6): the phrase `Cyprian
      histories' is equivalent to "The Cypria".<br>
 (4)  Cp. Allen "C.R." xxvii. 190.<br>
 (5)  These two lines possibly belong to the account of the feast
      given by Agamemnon at Lemnos.<br>
 (6)  sc. the Asiatic Thebes at the foot of Mt. Placius.<br>
