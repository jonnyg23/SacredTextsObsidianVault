 <p></p>  <h2 align="center">ELEGY V:</h2>  <h3 align="center">HIS DELIGHT AT HAVING OBTAINED CORINNA'S FAVOURS</h3>  <table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="45%">   
 <p>'TWAS summer, and already past the hour of noon. I flung myself on my   couch to rest my limbs. My windows were but half open. The light of my   chamber was like the light of the woods, or like the glow which follows after   sunset; or father, like the twilight that comes between departing night and   dawning day. Such is the light that is befitting for young women of reserve;   in its mystery their timid modesty may find concealment.</p>   
 <p>Behold Corinna cometh, her shift ungirdled, her tresses hanging loose on   either side her snowy neck. In such guise did the fair Semiramis offer   herself to the caresses</p>   
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>   
 <p>of her spouse, and thus did Lais give welcome to her many lovers. I raised   her shift, which withal was of so fine a texture that it was but a flimsy   obstacle. Howbeit Corinna was not willing to be deprived of her raiment. She   strove, but not as one whose will it is to conquer. Soon she gave up the   struggle and consented to be conquered.</p>   
 <p>When, her apparel laid aside, she stood naked before mine eyes, not a   blemish was to be seen on her whole body. What shoulders, what arms it was my   privilege to behold and to touch. What bliss to press a bosom shaped so   perfectly for such caresses. How soft and smooth her skin beneath her lovely   breasts, how divine her figure, how firm and plump her thighs. But wherefore   should I here tell o’er the number of her charms? Nought did I see that   was not perfect, nor was there aught, how thin soe'er, between her lovely   body and my own. Need I tell the rest? Wearied, we rested from our toil. May   many an afternoon be thus sped by.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="10%">
