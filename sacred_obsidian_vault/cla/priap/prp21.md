 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Femina si furtum faciet mihi virve puerve,<br>
    haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille nates.</p>
 <p>An fro' me woman shall thieve or plunder me man or a man-child,<br>
 She shall pay me with coynte, that with his mouth, this with arse.</p>
 <p>If a woman, man, or boy, thieve from me, let her coynte, his mouth, the latter's buttocks, be submitted [to my mentule].</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Cheaply purchased in the market: not grown in the donor's orchard. The Via Sacra was a market street in Rome, in the fourth region leading from the Forum to the Capitol. The sense of this epigram is somewhat obscure. Priapus's master, who has suffered reverses, is making an offering to the god, and wishes Priapus to keep up the deception apropos his wealth by concealing from enquirers that the offering of fruit was not from the orchard of the giver, but purchased in the public market.]</p>
