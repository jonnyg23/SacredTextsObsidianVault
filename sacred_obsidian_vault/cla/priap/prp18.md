 <h3 align="CENTER">To Priapus</h3>
 <p>Hic quando Telethusa circulatrix,<br>
 quae clunem tunica tegente nulla<br>
 exstans altius altiusque movit,<br>
 crisabit tibi fluctuante lumbo:<br>
 haec sic non modo te, Priape, possit,<br>
 privignum quoque sed movere Phaedrae.</p>
 <p>Will ever Telethusa, posture-mime,<br>
 Who with no tunic veiling hinder cheeks<br>
 Higher than her vitals heaves with apter geste<br>
 Wriggle to please thee with her wavy loins?<br>
 So thee, Priapus, not alone she'll move<br>
 E'en Phaedra's stepson shall her movement rouse.</p>
 <p>Will Telethusa, the posture-dancer, who heaves up her haunches, denuded of tunic, more gracefully and higher than her bosom,[1] ever, with undulating loins,[2] wriggle her thighs[3] for thee in such wise as not only to excite thy desires, O Priapus, but even those of the stepson of Phaedra?</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The posture alluded to is that attitude in coition in which the man lies supine, whilst the woman mounts on him and provokes the orgasm by her movements.</p>
 <p>2. In the original Latin, <i>flucto</i>, referring here to the wave-like motion of the loins during congress.</p>
 <p>3. In the original Latin, <i>crisso</i>, meaning the buckings and wrigglings of a woman's thighs and haunches during congress.]</p>
