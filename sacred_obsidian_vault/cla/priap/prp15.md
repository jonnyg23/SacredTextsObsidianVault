 <h3 align="CENTER">To Priapus</h3>
 <p>Qualibus Hippomenes rapuit Schoeneida pomis,<br>
    qualibus Hesperidum nobilis hortus erat,<br>
 qualia credibile est spatiantem rure paterno<br>
    Nausicaam pleno saepe tulisse sinu,<br>
 quale fuit malum quod littera pinxit Aconti,<br>
    qua lecta cupido pacta puella viro est:<br>
 taliacumque pius dominus florentis agelli<br>
    imposuit mensae, nude Priape, tuae.</p>
 <p>Rare as those apples wherewith Hippomenes Schoeneïs ravished;<br>
 Fair as the fruits that enfam'd Garths of the Hesperid maids;<br>
 Fen as one fancies the lot which, pacing her patrial vergers,<br>
 Nausicaä full oft bare in her well-fillèd lap;<br>
 Sweet as the pome whereon Acontius limnèd the letters<br>
 Which being read his Fair pledged to her love-longing swain;<br>
 Such be the fruits that youth who owneth the flourishing fieldlet<br>
 Placed on the table of stone, naked Priapus! for thee.</p>
 <p>As the apples with which Hippomenes raped the daughter of Schoeneus;[1] for which the garden of the Hesperides was renowned; which one may imagine Nausicaa[2] often carrying in her teeming lap as she walked in her father's domains; as was that apple graced by the words of Acontius, which, read aloud [by Cydippe], pledged the maiden to this ardent lover[3]--such are those which the boy-owner of a small but fertile field has placed on thy sacrificial table, O naked Priapus.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Referring to the story of the race between Hippomenes and Atalanta, and how the crafty lover tricked the damsel into defeat by the three gold apples.</p>
 <p>2. Nausicaa was the daughter of Alcinous, king of Phaeacia, whose pleasure demensnes and luxuriousness became a proverb.</p>
 <p>3. The story is very prettily told by Aristaenetus. The words on the apple were--'I swear to thee inviolably, by the mystic rites of Diana, that I will join myself to thee as thy companion and will become thy bride.' According to Vossius the gift of an apple was equivalent to a promise of the last favour. The Emperor Theodosius caused Paulinus to be murdered for receiving an apple from his empress.]</p>
