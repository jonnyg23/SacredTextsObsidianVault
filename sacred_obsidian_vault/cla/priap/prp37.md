 <h3 align="CENTER">The Interpretation of a Votive Offering[1]</h3>
 <p>Cur pictum memori sit in tabella<br>
 membrum, quaeritis, unde procreamur?<br>
 cum penis mihi forte laesus esset<br>
 chirurgamque manum miser timerem,<br>
 dis me legitimis nimisque magnis,<br>
 ut Phoebo puta filioque Phoebi,<br>
 curatum dare mentulam verebar.<br>
 huic dixi: 'fer opem, Priape, parti,<br>
 cuius tu, pater, ipse pars videris,<br>
 qua salva sine sectione facta<br>
 ponetur tibi picta, quam levaris,<br>
 compar consimilisque concolorque'.<br>
 promisit fore mentulamque movit<br>
 pro nutu deus et rogata fecit.</p>
 <p>Why on memorial tablet do they limn<br>
 (You ask) the member which begets us all?<br>
 Whenas by accident my yard was hurt<br>
 And I (unhappy!) feared the surgeon's hand<br>
 To such legitimate almighty gods--<br>
 Phoebus for instance take or Phoebus' son--<br>
 I blushed to offer for a cure my cock<br>
 And prayed--'Priapus, an thou heal the part,<br>
 O Sire, whose very counterpart thou seem'st<br>
 And without hacking make it whole again,<br>
 One linmed on tablet shall to thee be given<br>
 Like-sized, like-coloured and alike of shape.'<br>
 The God to promise deigning wagged his yard,<br>
 By way of nod divine, and did my bede.</p>
 <p>You ask why the instrument of procreation has been painted on the memorable tablet. When by accident I had bruised my penis, and wretched with suffering, dreaded the hand of the surgeon (moreover I was afraid to give the cure of my mentule to the legitimate and almighty gods, such as Phoebus, for instance, and Phoebus's son),[2] 'Help, O Priapus,' quoth I, 'help thou the part whose very counterpart, O Sire, thou seemest; and if thou shalt restore it safely to health without amputation,[3] I will consecrate to thee, painted on a tablet, a very facsimile of it, alike in size, shape and colour! 'The God promised; for nod bobbed his mentule;[4] and has granted my prayer.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Pacificus Maximus addresses a similar entreaty to Priapus, when suffering from the pox, offering, if cured, to dedicate to the god a waxen column equal in size to that of the sufferer. Cures were sought to such <i>morbi venerii</i> as <i>inflamatio coleomm</i> (swollen testicles), <i>tubercula circa glandem</i> (warts on the glans penis), <i>cancri carbunculi</i> (chancre or shanker) and a few others.</p>
 <p>2. Phoebus was the god of the healing art. Aesculapius was his son.</p>
 <p>3. Reminding one of Don Juan's healthy horror when they proposed to circumcise him.</p>
 <p>4. Parodying the majestic nod of Jupiter when grating a request.]</p>
