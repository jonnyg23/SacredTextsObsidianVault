 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Porro - nam quis erit modus? - Quirites,<br>
 aut praecidite seminale membrum,<br>
 quod totis mihi noctibus fatigant<br>
 vicinae sine fine prurientes<br>
 vernis passeribus salaciores,<br>
 aut rumpar, nec habebitis Priapum.<br>
 ipsi cernitis, effututus ut sim<br>
 confectusque macerque pallidusque,<br>
 qui quondam ruber et valens solebam<br>
 fures caedere quamlibet valentes.<br>
 defecit latus et periculosam<br>
 cum tussi miser exspuo salivam.</p>
 <p>Hither, Quirites! (here what limit is?)<br>
 Either my member seminal lop ye off<br>
 Which thro' the livelong nights for aye fatigue<br>
 The neighbour-women rutting endlessly,<br>
 Lewder than sparrows in the lusty spring;<br>
 Or I shall burst and ye Priapus lose.<br>
 How I be futtered-out yourselves espy<br>
 Used-up, bejaded, lean and pallid grown,<br>
 Who erstwhile ruddy, in my doughtiness wont<br>
 To kill with poking thieves however doughty.<br>
 My side has failed me and poor I with cough<br>
 The perilous spittle ever must outspew.</p>
 <p>Hither! ye Romans' Either lop off my seminal member, which the neighbouring women, ever itching with desire, exhaust the whole night through[1]--more lecherous than sparrows in the spring[2]--or I shall be ruptured (for where is the limit of their lust?), nor will ye have a Priapus. Ye see that I am spent with venery, jaded, thin and pale, who once, ruddy and vigorous, used to thrust through the stoutest thieves. My strength has faded me; and, wretched with coughing, I spit out noxious saliva.[3]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Either the women exhausted Priapus with their mouths or by riding upon him.</p>
 <p>2. Scioppius recounts having seen sparrows in spring copulate so many times in succession that, when trying to fly away, they fell to the ground exhausted.</p>
 <p>3. In connection with this epigram may be mentioned the practice of tribadism with phalli amongst the Roman ladies. Giraldus tells us that the Lesbian women used dildoes made of glass, ivory, gold and silken stuffs and linen to satisfy their lechery. Suidas and Aristophanes speak of the use by Milesian women of a leathern penis succedaneum, called <i>olisbos</i>. Martial and Suetonius hint at the use of a snake for a similar purpose. Petronius makes Oenothea introduce a leathern <i>fascinum</i>, smeared with oil, pepper and crushed nettle seeds, into the anus of Encolpius as an aphrodisiac.]</p>
