 <p>Commisso mihi non satis modestas<br>
 quicumque attulerit manus agello,<br>
 is me sentiet esse non spadonem.<br>
 dicat forsitan haec sibi ipse: 'nemo<br>
 hic inter frutices loco remoto<br>
 percisum sciet esse me', sed errat:<br>
 magnis testibus ista res agetur.</p>
 <p>Charged to my charge the fieldlet who shall dare<br>
 With hand not modest anywise molest,<br>
 Me fox no eunuch he shall know and feet.<br>
 Here in a distant place the hurst amid<br>
 He peradventure to himself shall say--<br>
 'None! saw me so misused.' But he is wrong:<br>
 These huge attestors shall the cause maintain.</p>
 <p>He who shall plunder with dishonest hand the little field committed to my charge, shall feel me to be no eunuch[1] in this lonely place among the bushes. Here, perhaps, he will say this to himself, 'None will know that I have been thrust through.'[2] He will be mistaken; that cause will be sustained by 'weighty' witnesses![3]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Martial and Juvenal have many references to eunuchism and the use to which the Roman ladies put these castratos, who were of various kinds: <i>castrati</i> (<i>castare</i>, meaning to cut oft)--those who had lost both penis and testicles; <i>spadones</i> (either <i>spata</i>, a Gallic word meaning a razor, or Spada, a Persian village where the operation of eunuchism is performed)--those who still retained the penis; <i>thlibiae</i> (from the Greek meaning to rub with hemlock, etc.)--those whose testicles had been extracted by compression; <i>thliasiae</i> (from the Greek meaning to crush); <i>cremaster</i> (so called from the destruction of the muscle, <i>cremaster</i>, by which the testicle is suspended or drawn up or compressed in the act of coition); and <i>bagoas</i>. The subject scarcely calls for extended notice in this work, but I would refer those interested in the subject to <i>The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night</i>, translated by Sir Richard F. Burton.</p>
 <p>2. <i>Praecidere</i> (literally meaning to cut off). Here means to cut through the bowels. It has a similar meaning in Juvenal--'to run against yesterday's supper'. Like expressions are <i>billas dividere</i>, 'to divide the bowels', and <i>cacare mentulam</i>, 'to defile the mentule with ordure'.</p>
 <p>3. In the original, <i>magnis testibus</i>, meaning trustworthy witness; and, by a play upon words, large testicles.]</p>
