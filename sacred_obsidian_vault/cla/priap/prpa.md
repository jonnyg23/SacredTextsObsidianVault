 <h4 align="CENTER">by divers poets in English verse and prose</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">translation by Leonard C. Smithers and Sir Richard Burton</p>
 <p align="CENTER">[1890]</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Scanned at www.sacred-texts.com, December, 2000.</p>
 <h5 align="CENTER">{NOTE: this has been scanned from available versions of the Smithers and Burton <i>Priapeia</i>, which lack the Latin version, and merged with a Latin version found on the Internet, which does not include some of the final epigrams and has a slightly different ordering from the English translation. About a dozen additional Latin verses were provided by Ken Butler. We have taken care to match the Latin and English verses. The original edition is hard to obtain, but we will attempt to update this file if such an edition becomes available. This file probably contains 99% of the material in the original Smithers and Burton edition; at this time only about four Latin verses are missing.</h5>
 <h5 align="CENTER">Despite the disclaimer in the Introduction, it can be established fairly easily that Burton authored the 'Notes explanatory and Illustrative and Excursus'; it bears his unique style and knowledge of erotology, as well as numerous shameless 'plugs' for his other books.}</h5>
