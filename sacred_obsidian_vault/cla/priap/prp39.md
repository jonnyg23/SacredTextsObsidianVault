 <p>Forma Mercurius potest placere,<br>
 forma conspiciendus est Apollo,<br>
 formosus quoque pingitur Lyaeus,<br>
 formosissimus omnium est Cupido.<br>
 me pulchra fateor carere forma,<br>
 verum mentula luculenta nostra est:<br>
 hanc mavult sibi quam deos priores,<br>
 si qua est non fatui puella cunni.</p>
 <p>Form-charms in Mercury have might to please;<br>
 Form in Apollo is conspicuous charm;<br>
 Formose in picture is Lyaeus limned<br>
 And Cupid most formose of all is shown.<br>
 Freely of lovely form the lack I own;<br>
 Yet is our mentule a resplendent gem;<br>
 And this to th'erst-named gods shall aye prefer<br>
 The damsel dowered with no fatuous coynte.</p>
 <p>Mercury has a pleasing form, Apollo's is eminent for its beauty; Lyaeus too is painted of comely figure; Cupid is handsomest of all. My figure is, I confess, wanting in beauty, but my mentule is, in truth, magnificent; and if there be a girl with a sensible coynte, she had rather have that for herself than all the former gods.</p>
