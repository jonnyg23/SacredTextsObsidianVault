 <p>Cum quendam rigidus deus videret<br>
 ferventi caput ustulare ferro,<br>
 ut Maurae similis foret puellae,<br>
 'heus' inquit 'tibi dicimus, cinaede,<br>
 uras te licet usque torqueasque,<br>
 num tandem prior es puella, quaeso,<br>
 quod sunt, mentula quos habet, capilli?'</p>
 <p>Whenas the Rigid God espied a wight<br>
 Crisping his head with curling-tongs aglow<br>
 That he be likest to a Moorish maid,<br>
 'Ho thou! (cried he) we tell thee, catamite;<br>
 However much thou toast and curl thyself<br>
 Is then a damsel more of worth, I ask,<br>
 Than are the hairy honours of thy yard?'</p>
 <p>When the Rigid God beheld an effeminate crisping his hair with the heated curling-irons, to liken himself to a Moorish damsel, 'Ho there, thou catamite,' quoth he. 'We tell thee, thou mayst crisp and curl to thy liking, but is a girl, prithee, of more value than are the hairs which deck thy mentule?'[2]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. It needs no augur, because the girl's kisses have put the spear (although it is only wooden) into such a state of erection as self-evidently shows its willingness to swive her.</p>
 <p>2. Is it worthwhile disturbing a hair even on thy mentule, much less thy head, to take the semblance of a girl?]</p>
