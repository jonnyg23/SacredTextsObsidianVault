 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Hoc sceptrum, quod ab arbore est recisum,<br>
 nulla iam poterit virere fronde,<br>
 sceptrum, quod pathicae petunt puellae,<br>
 quod quidam cupiunt tenere reges,<br>
 cui dant oscula nobiles cinaedi,<br>
 intra viscera furis ibit usque<br>
 ad pubem capulumque coleorum.</p>
 <p>This staff of office cut from tree as 'tis,<br>
 No more with leafage green for aye to bloom;<br>
 Staff by the pathic damsels fondly loved,<br>
 Which e'en the kings delight in hand to hold<br>
 And oft by noble catamites bekissed--<br>
 This staff in robbers' vitals deep shall plunge<br>
 Up to its bushy base and bag of balls.</p>
 <p>This staff of office, which, severed from the tree, can now shoot forth no verdure; sceptre, which pathic maidens crave, and some kings love to hold; to which patrician[1] paederasts give kisses; shall go right into the very bowels of the thief, as far as the hair and the bag of balls.[2]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. 'Patrician' and 'notorious' are alternative renderings of 'the Latin word <i>oscula</i>.</p>
 <p>2. The whole of Priapus's member to the very hair of the pudendum and the scrotum would be thrust into the thief.]</p>
