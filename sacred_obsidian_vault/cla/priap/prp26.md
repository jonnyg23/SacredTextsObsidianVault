 <h3 align="CENTER">To Priapus</h3>
 <p>Deliciae populi, magno notissima circo<br>
    Quintia, vibratas docta movere nates,<br>
 cymbala cum crotalis, pruriginis arma, Priapo<br>
    ponit et adducta tympana pulsa manu.<br>
 pro quibus, ut semper placeat spectantibus, orat,<br>
    tentaque ad exemplum sit sua turba dei.</p>
 <p>Well-known darling of folk in the Circus Maximus far famed,<br>
 Quinctia, tremulous hips trainèd and artful to wag,<br>
 Cymbals and castanets (the wanton arms) to Priapus<br>
 Offers and tambourine struck with the hand to self drawn.<br>
 Wherefore prays she that aye she please her mob of admirers;<br>
 Let one and all stand stiff after the wont of her god.</p>
 <p>Quinctia, the people's darling, renowned in the Great Circus, cunning to flirt her tremulous buttocks to and fro, the cymbals and the castanet, the weapons of wantonness,[1] dedicates to Priapus, and the tambour, struck by the hand towards her drawn. And she prays for them, that she may always find favour with her spectators; and that her crowd of admirers may be 'rigid'[2], after the manner of the god.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. So called because the songs and dances to which the cymbals and castanets were accompaniments were of a loose and wanton character, inciting the spectators to venery.</p>
 <p>2. This was looked on as a mark of the dancer's success in arousing the spectators' passions by her lascivious movements and postures.]</p>
