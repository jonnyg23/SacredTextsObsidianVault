 <p>     Among the Barbarians of the West, the victory of Theodoric had spread a general alarm.  But as soon as it appeared that he was satisfied with conquest and desirous of peace, terror was changed into respect, and they submitted to a powerful mediation, which was uniformly employed for the best purposes of reconciling their quarrels and civilizing their manners.  <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">33</font></a> The ambassadors who resorted to Ravenna from the most distant countries of Europe, admired his wisdom, magnificence,  <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">34</font></a> and courtesy; and if he sometimes accepted either slaves or arms, white horses or strange animals, the gift of a sun-dial, a water-clock, or a musician, admonished even the princes of Gaul of the superior art and industry of his Italian subjects. His domestic alliances,  <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">35</font></a> a wife, two daughters, a sister, and a niece, united the family of Theodoric with the kings of the Franks, the Burgundians, the Visigoths, the Vandals, and the Thuringians, and contributed to maintain the harmony, or at least the balance, of the great republic of the West.  <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">36</font></a> It is difficult in the dark forests of Germany and Poland to pursue the emigrations of the Heruli, a fierce people who disdained the use of armor, and who condemned their widows and aged parents not to survive the loss of their husbands, or the decay of their strength.  <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">37</font></a> The king of these savage warriors solicited the friendship of Theodoric, and was elevated to the rank of his son, according to the barbaric rites of a military adoption.  <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">38</font></a> From the shores of the Baltic, the Aestians or Livonians laid their offerings of native amber  <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">39</font></a> at the feet of a prince, whose fame had excited them to undertake an unknown and dangerous journey of fifteen hundred miles.  With the country  <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">40</font></a> from whence the Gothic nation derived their origin, he maintained a frequent and friendly correspondence: the Italians were clothed in the rich sables  <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">41</font></a> of Sweden; and one of its sovereigns, after a voluntary or reluctant abdication, found a hospitable retreat in the palace of Ravenna.  He had reigned over one of the thirteen populous tribes who cultivated a small portion of the great island or peninsula of Scandinavia, to which the vague appellation of Thule has been sometimes applied.  That northern region was peopled, or had been explored, as high as the sixty- eighth degree of latitude, where the natives of the polar circle enjoy and lose the presence of the sun at each summer and winter solstice during an equal period of forty days.  <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">42</font></a> The long night of his absence or death was the mournful season of distress and anxiety, till the messengers, who had been sent to the mountain tops, descried the first rays of returning light, and proclaimed to the plain below the festival of his resurrection.  <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">43</font></a> </p>

 <p>     The life of Theodoric represents the rare and meritorious example of a Barbarian, who sheathed his sword in the pride of victory and the vigor of his age.  A reign of three and thirty years was consecrated to the duties of civil government, and the hostilities, in which he was sometimes involved, were speedily terminated by the conduct of his lieutenants, the discipline of his troops, the arms of his allies, and even by the terror of his name.  He reduced, under a strong and regular government, the unprofitable countries of Rhaetia, Noricum, Dalmatia, and Pannonia, from the source of the Danube and the territory of the Bavarians,  <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">44</font></a> to the petty kingdom erected by the Gepidae on the ruins of Sirmium.  His prudence could not safely intrust the bulwark of Italy to such feeble and turbulent neighbors; and his justice might claim the lands which they oppressed, either as a part of his kingdom, or as the inheritance of his father.  The greatness of a servant, who was named perfidious because he was successful, awakened the jealousy of the emperor Anastasius; and a war was kindled on the Dacian frontier, by the protection which the Gothic king, in the vicissitude of human affairs, had granted to one of the descendants of Attila.  Sabinian, a general illustrious by his own and father's merit, advanced at the head of ten thousand Romans; and the provisions and arms, which filled a long train of wagons, were distributed to the fiercest of the Bulgarian tribes.  But in the fields of Margus, the eastern powers were defeated by the inferior forces of the Goths and Huns; the flower and even the hope of the Roman armies was irretrievably destroyed; and such was the temperance with which Theodoric had inspired his victorious troops, that, as their leader had not given the signal of pillage, the rich spoils of the enemy lay untouched at their feet.  <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">45</font></a> Exasperated by this disgrace, the Byzantine court despatched two hundred ships and eight thousand men to plunder the sea-coast of Calabria and Apulia: they assaulted the ancient city of Tarentum, interrupted the trade and agriculture of a happy country, and sailed back to the Hellespont, proud of their piratical victory over a people whom they still presumed to consider as their Roman brethren.  <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">46</font></a> Their retreat was possibly hastened by the activity of Theodoric; Italy was covered by a fleet of a thousand light vessels,  <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">47</font></a> which he constructed with incredible despatch; and his firm moderation was soon rewarded by a solid and honorable peace.  He maintained, with a powerful hand, the balance of the West, till it was at length overthrown by the ambition of Clovis; and although unable to assist his rash and unfortunate kinsman, the king of the Visigoths, he saved the remains of his family and people, and checked the Franks in the midst of their victorious career.  I am not desirous to prolong or repeat  <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">48</font></a> this narrative of military events, the least interesting of the reign of Theodoric; and shall be content to add, that the Alemanni were protected,  <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">49</font></a> that an inroad of the Burgundians was severely chastised, and that the conquest of Arles and Marseilles opened a free communication with the Visigoths, who revered him as their national protector, and as the guardian of his grandchild, the infant son of Alaric. Under this respectable character, the king of Italy restored the praetorian praefecture of the Gauls, reformed some abuses in the civil government of Spain, and accepted the annual tribute and apparent submission of its military governor, who wisely refused to trust his person in the palace of Ravenna.  <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">50</font></a> The Gothic sovereignty was established from Sicily to the Danube, from Sirmium or Belgrade to the Atlantic Ocean; and the Greeks themselves have acknowledged that Theodoric reigned over the fairest portion of the Western empire.  <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">51</font></a>

 <p>     The union of the Goths and Romans might have fixed for ages the transient happiness of Italy; and the first of nations, a new people of free subjects and enlightened soldiers, might have gradually arisen from the mutual emulation of their respective virtues.  But the sublime merit of guiding or seconding such a revolution was not reserved for the reign of Theodoric: he wanted either the genius or the opportunities of a legislator;  <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">52</font></a> and while he indulged the Goths in the enjoyment of rude liberty, he servilely copied the institutions, and even the abuses, of the political system which had been framed by Constantine and his successors.  From a tender regard to the expiring prejudices of Rome, the Barbarian declined the name, the purple, and the diadem, of the emperors; but he assumed, under the hereditary title of king, the whole substance and plenitude of Imperial prerogative.  <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">53</font></a> His addresses to the eastern throne were respectful and ambiguous: he celebrated, in pompous style, the harmony of the two republics, applauded his own government as the perfect similitude of a sole and undivided empire, and claimed above the kings of the earth the same preeminence which he modestly allowed to the person or rank of Anastasius. The alliance of the East and West was annually declared by the unanimous choice of two consuls; but it should seem that the Italian candidate who was named by Theodoric accepted a formal confirmation from the sovereign of Constantinople.  <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">54</font></a> The Gothic palace of Ravenna reflected the image of the court of Theodosius or Valentinian.  The Praetorian praefect, the praefect of Rome, the quaestor, the master of the offices, with the public and patrimonial treasurers,  <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">*_0005</font></a> whose functions are painted in gaudy colors by the rhetoric of Cassiodorus, still continued to act as the ministers of state. And the subordinate care of justice and the revenue was delegated to seven consulars, three correctors, and five presidents, who governed the fifteen regions of Italy according to the principles, and even the forms, of Roman jurisprudence.  <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">55</font></a> The violence of the conquerors was abated or eluded by the slow artifice of judicial proceedings; the civil administration, with its honors and emoluments, was confined to the Italians; and the people still preserved their dress and language, their laws and customs, their personal freedom, and two thirds of their landed property.  <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">!_0005</font></a> It had been the object of Augustus to conceal the introduction of monarchy; it was the policy of Theodoric to disguise the reign of a Barbarian.  <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">56</font></a> If his subjects were sometimes awakened from this pleasing vision of a Roman government, they derived more substantial comfort from the character of a Gothic prince, who had penetration to discern, and firmness to pursue, his own and the public interest.  Theodoric loved the virtues which he possessed, and the talents of which he was destitute.  Liberius was promoted to the office of Praetorian praefect for his unshaken fidelity to the unfortunate cause of Odoacer.  The ministers of Theodoric, Cassiodorus,  <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">57</font></a> and Boethius, have reflected on his reign the lustre of their genius and learning.  More prudent or more fortunate than his colleague, Cassiodorus preserved his own esteem without forfeiting the royal favor; and after passing thirty years in the honors of the world, he was blessed with an equal term of repose in the devout and studious solitude of Squillace.  <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">**_0005</font></a> </p>

 <p>     As the patron of the republic, it was the interest and duty of the Gothic king to cultivate the affections of the senate  <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">58</font></a> and people.  The nobles of Rome were flattered by sonorous epithets and formal professions of respect, which had been more justly applied to the merit and authority of their ancestors.  The people enjoyed, without fear or danger, the three blessings of a capital, order, plenty, and public amusements.  A visible diminution of their numbers may be found even in the measure of liberality;  <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">59</font></a> yet Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, poured their tribute of corn into the granaries of Rome an allowance of bread and meat was distributed to the indigent citizens; and every office was deemed honorable which was consecrated to the care of their health and happiness.  The public games, such as the Greek ambassador might politely applaud, exhibited a faint and feeble copy of the magnificence of the Caesars: yet the musical, the gymnastic, and the pantomime arts, had not totally sunk in oblivion; the wild beasts of Africa still exercised in the amphitheatre the courage and dexterity of the hunters; and the indulgent Goth either patiently tolerated or gently restrained the blue and green factions, whose contests so often filled the circus with clamor and even with blood.  <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">60</font></a> In the seventh year of his peaceful reign, Theodoric visited the old capital of the world; the senate and people advanced in solemn procession to salute a second Trajan, a new Valentinian; and he nobly supported that character by the assurance of a just and legal government,  <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">61</font></a> in a discourse which he was not afraid to pronounce in public, and to inscribe on a tablet of brass.  Rome, in this august ceremony, shot a last ray of declining glory; and a saint, the spectator of this pompous scene, could only hope, in his pious fancy, that it was excelled by the celestial splendor of the new Jerusalem.  <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">62</font></a> During a residence of six months, the fame, the person, and the courteous demeanor of the Gothic king, excited the admiration of the Romans, and he contemplated, with equal curiosity and surprise, the monuments that remained of their ancient greatness.  He imprinted the footsteps of a conqueror on the Capitoline hill, and frankly confessed that each day he viewed with fresh wonder the forum of Trajan and his lofty column.  The theatre of Pompey appeared, even in its decay, as a huge mountain artificially hollowed, and polished, and adorned by human industry; and he vaguely computed, that a river of gold must have been drained to erect the colossal amphitheatre of Titus.  <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">63</font></a> From the mouths of fourteen aqueducts, a pure and copious stream was diffused into every part of the city; among these the Claudian water, which arose at the distance of thirty-eight miles in the Sabine mountains, was conveyed along a gentle though constant declivity of solid arches, till it descended on the summit of the Aventine hill.  The long and spacious vaults which had been constructed for the purpose of common sewers, subsisted, after twelve centuries, in their pristine strength; and these subterraneous channels have been preferred to all the visible wonders of Rome.  <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">64</font></a> The Gothic kings, so injuriously accused of the ruin of antiquity, were anxious to preserve the monuments of the nation whom they had subdued.  <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">65</font></a> The royal edicts were framed to prevent the abuses, the neglect, or the depredations of the citizens themselves; and a professed architect, the annual sum of two hundred pounds of gold, twenty-five thousand tiles, and the receipt of customs from the Lucrine port, were assigned for the ordinary repairs of the walls and public edifices. A similar care was extended to the statues of metal or marble of men or animals.  The spirit of the horses, which have given a modern name to the Quirinal, was applauded by the Barbarians;  <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">66</font></a> the brazen elephants of the Via sacra were diligently restored;  <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">67</font></a> the famous heifer of Myron deceived the cattle, as they were driven through the forum of peace;  <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">68</font></a> and an officer was created to protect those works of rat, which Theodoric considered as the noblest ornament of his kingdom. </p>

 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_42">36</a> His political system may be observed in Cassiodorus, (Var. iv. l ix. l,) Jornandes, (c. 58, p. 698, 699,) and the Valesian Fragment, (p. 720, 721.) Peace, honorable peace, was the constant aim of Theodoric.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_43">37</a> The curious reader may contemplate the Heruli of Procopius, (Goth. l. ii. c. 14,) and the patient reader may plunge into the dark and minute researches of M. de Buat, (Hist. des Peuples Anciens, tom. ix. p. 348 - 396.) </p> 
 <p>     Note: Compare Manso, Ost Gothische Reich. Beylage, vi.  Malte- Brun brings them from Scandinavia: their names, the only remains of their language, are Gothic.  "They fought almost naked, like the Icelandic Berserkirs their bravery was like madness: few in number, they were mostly of royal blood. What ferocity, what unrestrained license, sullied their victories!  The Goth respects the church, the priests, the senate; the Heruli mangle all in a general massacre: there is no pity for age, no refuge for chastity.  Among themselves there is the same ferocity: the sick and the aged are put to death. at their own request, during a solemn festival; the widow ends her days by hanging herself upon the tree which shadows her husband's tomb.  All these circumstances, so striking to a mind familiar with Scandinavian history, lead us to discover among the Heruli not so much a nation as a confederacy of princes and nobles, bound by an oath to live and die together with their arms in their hands. Their name, sometimes written Heruli or Eruli. sometimes Aeruli, signified, according to an ancient author, (Isid. Hispal. in gloss. p. 24, ad calc. Lex. Philolog. Martini, ll,) nobles, and appears to correspond better with the Scandinavian word iarl or earl, than with any of those numerous derivations proposed by etymologists." Malte- Brun, vol. i. p. 400, (edit. 1831.) Of all the Barbarians who threw themselves on the ruins of the Roman empire, it is most difficult to trace the origin of the Heruli.  They seem never to have been very powerful as a nation, and branches of them are found in countries very remote from each other.  In my opinion they belong to the Gothic race, and have a close affinity with the Scyrri or Hirri.  They were, possibly, a division of that nation.  They are often mingled and confounded with the Alani.  Though brave and formidable. they were never numerous. nor did they found any state. - St. Martin, vol. vi. p. 375. - M. Schafarck considers them descendants of the Hirri. of which Heruli is a diminutive, - Slawische Alter thinner - M. 1845.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_44"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_44">38</a> Variarum, iv. 2.  The spirit and forms of this martial institution are noticed by Cassiodorus; but he seems to have only translated the sentiments of the Gothic king into the language of Roman eloquence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_45"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_45">39</a> Cassiodorus, who quotes Tacitus to the Aestians, the unlettered savages of the Baltic, (Var. v. 2,) describes the amber for which their shores have ever been famous, as the gum of a tree, hardened by the sun, and purified and wafted by the waves.  When that singular substance is analyzed by the chemists, it yields a vegetable oil and a mineral acid.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_46"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_46">40</a> Scanzia, or Thule, is described by Jornandes (c. 3, p. 610 - 613) and Procopius, (Goth. l. ii. c. 15.) Neither the Goth nor the Greek had visited the country: both had conversed with the natives in their exile at Ravenna or Constantinople.</p>

In the time of Jornandes they inhabited Suethans, the proper Sweden; but that beautiful race of animals has gradually been driven into the eastern parts of Siberia.  See Buffon, (Hist. Nat. tom. xiii. p. 309 - 313, quarto edition;) Pennant, (System of Quadrupeds, vol. i. p. 322 - 328;) Gmelin, (Hist. Gen des.

This ingenious writer is a worthy disciple of the great Buffon; nor is it easy for the coldest reason to withstand the magic of their philosophy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_49"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_49">43</a> Says Procopius.  At present a rude Manicheism (generous enough) prevails among the Samoyedes in Greenland and in Lapland, (Hist. des Voyages, tom. xviii. p. 508, 509, tom. xix. p. 105, 106, 527, 528;) yet, according to Orotius Samojutae coelum atque astra adorant, numina haud aliis iniquiora, (de Rebus Belgicis, l. iv. p. 338, folio edition) a sentence which Tacitus would not have disowned.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_61"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_61">*_0005</a> All causes between Roman and Roman were judged by the old Roman courts.  The comes Gothorum judged between Goth and Goth; between Goths and Romans, (without considering which was the plaintiff.) the comes Gothorum, with a Roman jurist as his assessor, making a kind of mixed jurisdiction, but with a natural predominance to the side of the Goth Savigny, vol. i. p. 290. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_62"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_62">55</a> To the xvii. provinces of the Notitia, Paul Warnefrid the deacon (De Reb. Longobard. l. ii. c. 14 - 22) has subjoined an xviiith, the Apennine, (Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom. i. p. 431 - 443.) But of these Sardinia and Corsica were possessed by the Vandals, and the two Rhaetias, as well as the Cottian Alps, seem to have been abandoned to a military government.  The state of the four provinces that now form the kingdom of Naples is labored by Giannone (tom. i. p. 172, 178) with patriotic diligence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_63"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_63">!_0005</a> Manso enumerates and develops at some length the following sources of the royal revenue of Theodoric: 1. A domain, either by succession to that of Odoacer, or a part of the third of the lands was reserved for the royal patrimony.  1. Regalia, including mines, unclaimed estates, treasure-trove, and confiscations.  3. Land tax.  4. Aurarium, like the Chrysargyrum, a tax on certain branches of trade.  5. Grant of Monopolies.  6. Siliquaticum, a small tax on the sale of all kinds of commodities.  7. Portoria, customs Manso, 96, 111.  Savigny (i. 285) supposes that in many cases the property remained in the original owner, who paid his tertia, a third of the produce to the crown, vol. i. p. 285. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_64"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_64">56</a> See the Gothic history of Procopius, (l. i. c. 1, l. ii. c. 6,) the Epistles of Cassiodorus, (passim, but especially the vth and vith books, which contain the formulae, or patents of offices,) and the Civil History of Giannone, (tom. i. l. ii. iii.) The Gothic counts, which he places in every Italian city, are annihilated, however, by Maffei, (Verona Illustrata, P. i. l. viii. p. 227; for those of Syracuse and Naples (Var vi. 22, 23) were special and temporary commissions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_65"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_65">57</a> Two Italians of the name of Cassiodorus, the father (Var. i. 24, 40) and the son, (ix. 24, 25,) were successively employed in the administration of Theodoric.  The son was born in the year 479: his various epistles as quaestor, master of the offices, and Praetorian praefect, extend from 509 to 539, and he lived as a monk about thirty years, (Tiraboschi Storia della Letteratura Italiana, tom. iii. p. 7 - 24.  Fabricius, Bibliot. Lat. Med. Aevi, tom. i. p. 357, 358, edit. Mansi.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_66"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_66">**_0005</a> Cassiodorus was of an ancient and honorable family; his grandfather had distinguished himself in the defence of Sicily against the ravages of Genseric; his father held a high rank at the court of Valentinian III., enjoyed the friendship of Aetius, and was one of the ambassadors sent to arrest the progress of Attila.  Cassiodorus himself was first the treasurer of the private expenditure to Odoacer, afterwards "count of the sacred largesses." Yielding with the rest of the Romans to the dominion of Theodoric, he was instrumental in the peaceable submission of Sicily; was successively governor of his native provinces of Bruttium and Lucania, quaestor, magister, palatii, Praetorian praefect, patrician, consul, and private secretary, and, in fact, first minister of the king.  He was five times Praetorian praefect under different sovereigns, the last time in the reign of Vitiges.  This is the theory of Manso, which is not unencumbered with difficulties.  M. Buat had supposed that it was the father of Cassiodorus who held the office first named.  Compare Manso, p. 85, &amp;c., and Beylage, vii.  It certainly appears improbable that Cassiodorus should have been count of the sacred largesses at twenty years old. - M.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_72"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_72">63</a> Cassiodorus describes in his pompous style the Forum of Trajan (Var. vii. 6,) the theatre of Marcellus, (iv. 51,) and the amphitheatre of Titus, (v. 42;) and his descriptions are not unworthy of the reader's perusal. According to the modern prices, the Abbe Barthelemy computes that the brick work and masonry of the Coliseum would now cost twenty millions of French livres, (Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxviii. p. 585, 586.) How small a part of that stupendous fabric!</p>
 <p><a name="fn_73"></a><a href="daf04002.htm#fr_73">64</a> For the aqueducts and cloacae, see Strabo, (l. v. p. 360;) Pliny, (Hist. Natur. xxxvi. 24; Cassiodorus, (Var. iii. 30, 31, vi. 6;) Procopius, (Goth. l. i. c. 19;) and Nardini, (Roma Antica, p. 514 - 522.) How such works could be executed by a king of Rome, is yet a problem.       Note: See Niebuhr, vol. i. p. 402.  These stupendous works are among the most striking confirmations of Niebuhr's views of the early Roman history; at least they appear to justify his strong sentence - "These works and the building of the Capitol attest with unquestionable evidence that this Rome of the later kings was the chief city of a great state." - Page 110 - M.</p>
