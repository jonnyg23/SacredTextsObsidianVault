 <p>     The emperor Honorius was distinguished, above his subjects, by the preeminence of fear, as well as of rank.  The pride and luxury in which he was educated, had not allowed him to suspect, that there existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to invade the repose of the successor of Augustus. The arts of flattery concealed the impending danger, till Alaric approached the palace of Milan.  But when the sound of war had awakened the young emperor, instead of flying to arms with the spirit, or even the rashness, of his age, he eagerly listened to those timid counsellors, who proposed to convey his sacred person, and his faithful attendants, to some secure and distant station in the provinces of Gaul. Stilicho alone  <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">34</font></a> had courage and authority to resist his disgraceful measure, which would have abandoned Rome and Italy to the Barbarians; but as the troops of the palace had been lately detached to the Rhaetian frontier, and as the resource of new levies was slow and precarious, the general of the West could only promise, that if the court of Milan would maintain their ground during his absence, he would soon return with an army equal to the encounter of the Gothic king.  Without losing a moment, (while each moment was so important to the public safety,) Stilicho hastily embarked on the Larian Lake, ascended the mountains of ice and snow, amidst the severity of an Alpine winter, and suddenly repressed, by his unexpected presence, the enemy, who had disturbed the tranquillity of Rhaetia.  <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">35</font></a> The Barbarians, perhaps some tribes of the Alemanni, respected the firmness of a chief, who still assumed the language of command; and the choice which he condescended to make, of a select number of their bravest youth, was considered as a mark of his esteem and favor.  The cohorts, who were delivered from the neighboring foe, diligently repaired to the Imperial standard; and Stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the West, to advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of Honorius and of Italy.  The fortresses of the Rhine were abandoned; and the safety of Gaul was protected only by the faith of the Germans, and the ancient terror of the Roman name.  Even the legion, which had been stationed to guard the wall of Britain against the Caledonians of the North, was hastily recalled;  <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">36</font></a> and a numerous body of the cavalry of the Alani was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor, who anxiously expected the return of his general.  The prudence and vigor of Stilicho were conspicuous on this occasion, which revealed, at the same time, the weakness of the falling empire.  The legions of Rome, which had long since languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage, were exterminated by the Gothic and civil wars; and it was found impossible, without exhausting and exposing the provinces, to assemble an army for the defence of Italy.

 <p><a name="fn_320"></a><a href="daf03012.htm#fr_320">34</a> Solus erat Stilicho, &amp;c., is the exclusive commendation which Claudian bestows, (del Bell. Get. 267,) without condescending to except the emperor.  How insignificant must Honorius have appeared in his own court.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_321"></a><a href="daf03012.htm#fr_321">35</a> The face of the country, and the hardiness of Stilicho, are finely described, (de Bell. Get. 340 - 363.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_322"></a><a href="daf03012.htm#fr_322">36</a>  Venit et extremis legio praetenta Britannis,                Quae Scoto dat frena truci. </p> 
 <p>               De Bell. Get. 416. </p> 
 <p>Yet the most rapid march from Edinburgh, or Newcastle, to Milan, must have required a longer space of time than Claudian seems willing to allow for the duration of the Gothic war.</p>
