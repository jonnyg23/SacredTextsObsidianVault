 <p>     Domestic peace and union were the natural consequences of the moderate and comprehensive policy embraced by the Romans.  If we turn our eyes towards the monarchies of Asia, we shall behold despotism in the centre, and weakness in the extremities; the collection of the revenue, or the administration of justice, enforced by the presence of an army; hostile barbarians established in the heart of the country, hereditary satraps usurping the dominion of the provinces, and subjects inclined to rebellion, though incapable of freedom. But the obedience of the Roman world was uniform, voluntary, and permanent. The vanquished nations, blended into one great people, resigned the hope, nay, even the wish, of resuming their independence, and scarcely considered their own existence as distinct from the existence of Rome.  The established authority of the emperors pervaded without an effort the wide extent of their dominions, and was exercised with the same facility on the banks of the Thames, or of the Nile, as on those of the Tyber.  The legions were destined to serve against the public enemy, and the civil magistrate seldom required the aid of a military force.  <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">63</font></a> In this state of general security, the leisure, as well as opulence, both of the prince and people, were devoted to improve and to adorn the Roman empire. </p> 
 <p>
   </p> 
 <p>     Among the innumerable monuments of architecture constructed by the Romans, how many have escaped the notice of history, how few have resisted the ravages of time and barbarism!  And yet, even the majestic ruins that are still scattered over Italy and the provinces, would be sufficient to prove that those countries were once the seat of a polite and powerful empire. Their greatness alone, or their beauty, might deserve our attention: but they are rendered more interesting, by two important circumstances, which connect the agreeable history of the arts with the more useful history of human manners.  Many of those works were erected at private expense, and almost all were intended for public benefit. </p> 
 <p>     It is natural to suppose that the greatest number, as well as the most considerable of the Roman edifices, were raised by the emperors, who possessed so unbounded a command both of men and money.  Augustus was accustomed to boast that he had found his capital of brick, and that he had left it of marble.  <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">64</font></a> The strict economy of Vespasian was the source of his magnificence.  The works of Trajan bear the stamp of his genius.  The public monuments with which Hadrian adorned every province of the empire, were executed not only by his orders, but under his immediate inspection.  He was himself an artist; and he loved the arts, as they conduced to the glory of the monarch.  They were encouraged by the Antonines, as they contributed to the happiness of the people.  But if the emperors were the first, they were not the only architects of their dominions.  Their example was universally imitated by their principal subjects, who were not afraid of declaring to the world that they had spirit to conceive, and wealth to accomplish, the noblest undertakings.  Scarcely had the proud structure of the Coliseum been dedicated at Rome, before the edifices, of a smaller scale indeed, but of the same design and materials, were erected for the use, and at the expense, of the cities of Capua and Verona.  <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">65</font></a> The inscription of the stupendous bridge of Alcantara attests that it was thrown over the Tagus by the contribution of a few Lusitanian communities.  When Pliny was intrusted with the government of Bithynia and Pontus, provinces by no means the richest or most considerable of the empire, he found the cities within his jurisdiction striving with each other in every useful and ornamental work, that might deserve the curiosity of strangers, or the gratitude of their citizens.  It was the duty of the proconsul to supply their deficiencies, to direct their taste, and sometimes to moderate their emulation.  <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">66</font></a> The opulent senators of Rome and the provinces esteemed it an honor, and almost an obligation, to adorn the splendor of their age and country; and the influence of fashion very frequently supplied the want of taste or generosity.  Among a crowd of these private benefactors, we may select Herodes Atticus, an Athenian citizen, who lived in the age of the Antonines.  Whatever might be the motive of his conduct, his magnificence would have been worthy of the greatest kings. </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
    
  </p> 
 <p>     The family of Herod, at least after it had been favored by fortune, was lineally descended from Cimon and Miltiades, Theseus and Cecrops, Aeacus and Jupiter.  But the posterity of so many gods and heroes was fallen into the most abject state.  His grandfather had suffered by the hands of justice, and Julius Atticus, his father, must have ended his life in poverty and contempt, had he not discovered an immense treasure buried under an old house, the last remains of his patrimony.  According to the rigor of the law, the emperor might have asserted his claim, and the prudent Atticus prevented, by a frank confession, the officiousness of informers.  But the equitable Nerva, who then filled the throne, refused to accept any part of it, and commanded him to use, without scruple, the present of fortune.  The cautious Athenian still insisted, that the treasure was too considerable for a subject, and that he knew not how to use it.  Abuse it then, replied the monarch, with a good- natured peevishness; for it is your own.  <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">67</font></a> Many will be of opinion, that Atticus literally obeyed the emperor's last instructions; since he expended the greatest part of his fortune, which was much increased by an advantageous marriage, in the service of the public.  He had obtained for his son Herod the prefecture of the free cities of Asia; and the young magistrate, observing that the town of Troas was indifferently supplied with water, obtained from the munificence of Hadrian three hundred myriads of drachms, (about a hundred thousand pounds,) for the construction of a new aqueduct. But in the execution of the work, the charge amounted to more than double the estimate, and the officers of the revenue began to murmur, till the generous Atticus silenced their complaints, by requesting that he might be permitted to take upon himself the whole additional expense.  <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">68</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
         The ablest preceptors of Greece and Asia had been invited by liberal rewards to direct the education of young Herod.  Their pupil soon became a celebrated orator, according to the useless rhetoric of that age, which, confining itself to the schools, disdained to visit either the Forum or the Senate. </p> 
 <p>     He was honored with the consulship at Rome: but the greatest part of his life was spent in a philosophic retirement at Athens, and his adjacent villas; perpetually surrounded by sophists, who acknowledged, without reluctance, the superiority of a rich and generous rival.  <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">69</font></a> The monuments of his genius have perished; some considerable ruins still preserve the fame of his taste and munificence: modern travellers have measured the remains of the stadium which he constructed at Athens.  It was six hundred feet in length, built entirely of white marble, capable of admitting the whole body of the people, and finished in four years, whilst Herod was president of the Athenian games.  To the memory of his wife Regilla he dedicated a theatre, scarcely to be paralleled in the empire: no wood except cedar, very curiously carved, was employed in any part of the building.  The Odeum,  <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">*_0014</font></a> designed by Pericles for musical performances, and the rehearsal of new tragedies, had been a trophy of the victory of the arts over barbaric greatness; as the timbers employed in the construction consisted chiefly of the masts of the Persian vessels.  Notwithstanding the repairs bestowed on that ancient edifice by a king of Cappadocia, it was again fallen to decay.  Herod restored its ancient beauty and magnificence.  Nor was the liberality of that illustrious citizen confined to the walls of Athens.  The most splendid ornaments bestowed on the temple of Neptune in the Isthmus, a theatre at Corinth, a stadium at Delphi, a bath at Thermopylae, and an aqueduct at Canusium in Italy, were insufficient to exhaust his treasures.  The people of Epirus, Thessaly, Euboea, Boeotia, and Peloponnesus, experienced his favors; and many inscriptions of the cities of Greece and Asia gratefully style Herodes Atticus their patron and benefactor.  <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">70</font></a>  
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     In the commonwealths of Athens and Rome, the modest simplicity of private houses announced the equal condition of freedom; whilst the sovereignty of the people was represented in the majestic edifices designed to the public use;  <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">71</font></a> nor was this republican spirit totally extinguished by the introduction of wealth and monarchy.  It was in works of national honor and benefit, that the most virtuous of the emperors affected to display their magnificence.  The golden palace of Nero excited a just indignation, but the vast extent of ground which had been usurped by his selfish luxury was more nobly filled under the succeeding reigns by the Coliseum, the baths of Titus, the Claudian portico, and the temples dedicated to the goddess of Peace, and to the genius of Rome.  <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">72</font></a> These monuments of architecture, the property of the Roman people, were adorned with the most beautiful productions of Grecian painting and sculpture; and in the temple of Peace, a very curious library was open to the curiosity of the learned.  <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">*_0015</font></a> At a small distance from thence was situated the Forum of Trajan.  It was surrounded by a lofty portico, in the form of a quadrangle, into which four triumphal arches opened a noble and spacious entrance: in the centre arose a column of marble, whose height, of one hundred and ten feet, denoted the elevation of the hill that had been cut away.  This column, which still subsists in its ancient beauty, exhibited an exact representation of the Dacian victories of its founder.  The veteran soldier contemplated the story of his own campaigns, and by an easy illusion of national vanity, the peaceful citizen associated himself to the honors of the triumph.  All the other quarters of the capital, and all the provinces of the empire, were embellished by the same liberal spirit of public magnificence, and were filled with amphi theatres, theatres, temples, porticoes, triumphal arches, baths and aqueducts, all variously conducive to the health, the devotion, and the pleasures of the meanest citizen.  The last mentioned of those edifices deserve our peculiar attention.  The boldness of the enterprise, the solidity of the execution, and the uses to which they were subservient, rank the aqueducts among the noblest monuments of Roman genius and power.  The aqueducts of the capital claim a just preeminence; but the curious traveller, who, without the light of history, should examine those of Spoleto, of Metz, or of Segovia, would very naturally conclude that those provincial towns had formerly been the residence of some potent monarch.  The solitudes of Asia and Africa were once covered with flourishing cities, whose populousness, and even whose existence, was derived from such artificial supplies of a perennial stream of fresh water.  <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">73</font></a>  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>

 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
   </p> 
 <p>     We have computed the inhabitants, and contemplated the public works, of the Roman empire.  The observation of the number and greatness of its cities will serve to confirm the former, and to multiply the latter.  It may not be unpleasing to collect a few scattered instances relative to that subject without forgetting, however, that from the vanity of nations and the poverty of language, the vague appellation of city has been indifferently bestowed on Rome and upon Laurentum. </p> 
 <p>     I.  Ancient Italy is said to have contained eleven hundred and ninety- seven cities; and for whatsoever aera of antiquity the expression might be intended,  <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">74</font></a> there is not any reason to believe the country less populous in the age of the Antonines, than in that of Romulus.  The petty states of Latium were contained within the metropolis of the empire, by whose superior influence they had been attracted.  <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">*_0016</font></a> Those parts of Italy which have so long languished under the lazy tyranny of priests and viceroys, had been afflicted only by the more tolerable calamities of war; and the first symptoms of decay which they experienced, were amply compensated by the rapid improvements of the Cisalpine Gaul.  The splendor of Verona may be traced in its remains: yet Verona was less celebrated than Aquileia or Padua, Milan or Ravenna.  II. The spirit of improvement had passed the Alps, and been felt even in the woods of Britain, which were gradually cleared away to open a free space for convenient and elegant habitations.  York was the seat of government; London was already enriched by commerce; and Bath was celebrated for the salutary effects of its medicinal waters.  Gaul could boast of her twelve hundred cities;  <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">75</font></a> and though, in the northern parts, many of them, without excepting Paris itself, were little more than the rude and imperfect townships of a rising people, the southern provinces imitated the wealth and elegance of Italy.  <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">76</font></a> Many were the cities of Gaul, Marseilles, Arles, Nismes, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Bourdeaux, Autun, Vienna, Lyons, Langres, and Treves, whose ancient condition might sustain an equal, and perhaps advantageous comparison with their present state.  With regard to Spain, that country flourished as a province, and has declined as a kingdom.  Exhausted by the abuse of her strength, by America, and by superstition, her pride might possibly be confounded, if we required such a list of three hundred and sixty cities, as Pliny has exhibited under the reign of Vespasian.  <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">77</font></a> III. Three hundred African cities had once acknowledged the authority of Carthage,  <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">78</font></a> nor is it likely that their numbers diminished under the administration of the emperors: Carthage itself rose with new splendor from its ashes; and that capital, as well as Capua and Corinth, soon recovered all the advantages which can be separated from independent sovereignty.  IV.  The provinces of the East present the contrast of Roman magnificence with Turkish barbarism. The ruins of antiquity scattered over uncultivated fields, and ascribed, by ignorance to the power of magic, scarcely afford a shelter to the oppressed peasant or wandering Arab.  Under the reign of the Caesars, the proper Asia alone contained five hundred populous cities,  <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">79</font></a> enriched with all the gifts of nature, and adorned with all the refinements of art.  Eleven cities of Asia had once disputed the honor of dedicating a temple of Tiberius, and their respective merits were examined by the senate.  <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">80</font></a> Four of them were immediately rejected as unequal to the burden; and among these was Laodicea, whose splendor is still displayed in its ruins.  <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">81</font></a> Laodicea collected a very considerable revenue from its flocks of sheep, celebrated for the fineness of their wool, and had received, a little before the contest, a legacy of above four hundred thousand pounds by the testament of a generous citizen.  <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">82</font></a> If such was the poverty of Laodicea, what must have been the wealth of those cities, whose claim appeared preferable, and particularly of Pergamus, of Smyrna, and of Ephesus, who so long disputed with each other the titular primacy of Asia?  <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">83</font></a> The capitals of Syria and Egypt held a still superior rank in the empire; Antioch and Alexandria looked down with disdain on a crowd of dependent cities,  <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">84</font></a> and yielded, with reluctance, to the majesty of Rome itself. </p>

While enumerating the nations subject to the Romans, he speaks of the Gauls as submitting to 1200 soldiers, (which is false, as there were eight legions in Gaul, Tac. iv. 5,) while there are nearly twelve hundred cities. - G.
