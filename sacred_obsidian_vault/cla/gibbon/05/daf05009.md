 <p>     Arabia was free: the adjacent kingdoms were shaken by the storms of conquest and tyranny, and the persecuted sects fled to the happy land where they might profess what they thought, and practise what they professed. The religions of the Sabians and Magians, of the Jews and Christians, were disseminated from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea.  In a remote period of antiquity, Sabianism was diffused over Asia by the science of the Chaldaeans  <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">55</font></a> and the arms of the Assyrians.  From the observations of two thousand years, the priests and astronomers of Babylon  <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">56</font></a> deduced the eternal laws of nature and providence.  They adored the seven gods or angels, who directed the course of the seven planets, and shed their irresistible influence on the earth.  The attributes of the seven planets, with the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the twenty-four constellations of the northern and southern hemisphere, were represented by images and talismans; the seven days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities; the Sabians prayed thrice each day; and the temple of the moon at Haran was the term of their pilgrimage.  <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">57</font></a> But the flexible genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to learn: in the tradition of the creation, the deluge, and the patriarchs, they held a singular agreement with their Jewish captives; they appealed to the secret books of Adam, Seth, and Enoch; and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the last remnant of the Polytheists into the Christians of St. John, in the territory of Bassora.  <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">58</font></a> The altars of Babylon were overturned by the Magians; but the injuries of the Sabians were revenged by the sword of Alexander; Persia groaned above five hundred years under a foreign yoke; and the purest disciples of Zoroaster escaped from the contagion of idolatry, and breathed with their adversaries the freedom of the desert.  <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">59</font></a> Seven hundred years before the death of Mahomet, the Jews were settled in Arabia; and a far greater multitude was expelled from the Holy Land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian.  The industrious exiles aspired to liberty and power: they erected synagogues in the cities, and castles in the wilderness, and their Gentile converts were confounded with the children of Israel, whom they resembled in the outward mark of circumcision.  The Christian missionaries were still more active and successful: the Catholics asserted their universal reign; the sects whom they oppressed, successively retired beyond the limits of the Roman empire; the Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic opinions and apocryphal gospels; the churches of Yemen, and the princes of Hira and Gassan, were instructed in a purer creed by the Jacobite and Nestorian bishops.  <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">60</font></a> The liberty of choice was presented to the tribes: each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private religion: and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with the sublime theology of saints and philosophers.  A fundamental article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned strangers; the existence of one supreme God who is exalted above the powers of heaven and earth, but who has often revealed himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels and prophets, and whose grace or justice has interrupted, by seasonable miracles, the order of nature.  The most rational of the Arabs acknowledged his power, though they neglected his worship;  <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">61</font></a> and it was habit rather than conviction that still attached them to the relics of idolatry.  The Jews and Christians were the people of the Book; the Bible was already translated into the Arabic language,  <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">62</font></a> and the volume of the Old Testament was accepted by the concord of these implacable enemies.  In the story of the Hebrew patriarchs, the Arabs were pleased to discover the fathers of their nation.  They applauded the birth and promises of Ismael; revered the faith and virtue of Abraham; traced his pedigree and their own to the creation of the first man, and imbibed, with equal credulity, the prodigies of the holy text, and the dreams and traditions of the Jewish rabbis. </p>

 <p>     The base and plebeian origin of Mahomet is an unskilful calumny of the Christians,  <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">63</font></a> who exalt instead of degrading the merit of their adversary. His descent from Ismael was a national privilege or fable; but if the first steps of the pedigree  <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">64</font></a> are dark and doubtful, he could produce many generations of pure and genuine nobility: he sprung from the tribe of Koreish and the family of Hashem, the most illustrious of the Arabs, the princes of Mecca, and the hereditary guardians of the Caaba. The grandfather of Mahomet was Abdol Motalleb, the son of Hashem, a wealthy and generous citizen, who relieved the distress of famine with the supplies of commerce.  Mecca, which had been fed by the liberality of the father, was saved by the courage of the son.  The kingdom of Yemen was subject to the Christian princes of Abyssinia; their vassal Abrahah was provoked by an insult to avenge the honor of the cross; and the holy city was invested by a train of elephants and an army of Africans.  A treaty was proposed; and, in the first audience, the grandfather of Mahomet demanded the restitution of his cattle.  "And why," said Abrahah, "do you not rather implore my clemency in favor of your temple, which I have threatened to destroy?" "Because," replied the intrepid chief, "the cattle is my own; the Caaba belongs to the gods, and they will defend their house from injury and sacrilege." The want of provisions, or the valor of the Koreish, compelled the Abyssinians to a disgraceful retreat: their discomfiture has been adorned with a miraculous flight of birds, who showered down stones on the heads of the infidels; and the deliverance was long commemorated by the aera of the elephant.  <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">65</font></a> The glory of Abdol Motalleb was crowned with domestic happiness; his life was prolonged to the age of one hundred and ten years; and he became the father of six daughters and thirteen sons. His best beloved Abdallah was the most beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and in the first night, when he consummated his marriage with Amina,  <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">!_0011</font></a> of the noble race of the Zahrites, two hundred virgins are said to have expired of jealousy and despair.  Mahomet, or more properly Mohammed, the only son of Abdallah and Amina, was born at Mecca, four years after the death of Justinian, and two months after the defeat of the Abyssinians,  <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">66</font></a> whose victory would have introduced into the Caaba the religion of the Christians. In his early infancy, he was deprived of his father, his mother, and his grandfather; his uncles were strong and numerous; and, in the division of the inheritance, the orphan's share was reduced to five camels and an Aethiopian maid-servant.  At home and abroad, in peace and war, Abu Taleb, the most respectable of his uncles, was the guide and guardian of his youth; in his twenty-fifth year, he entered into the service of Cadijah, a rich and noble widow of Mecca, who soon rewarded his fidelity with the gift of her hand and fortune.  The marriage contract, in the simple style of antiquity, recites the mutual love of Mahomet and Cadijah; describes him as the most accomplished of the tribe of Koreish; and stipulates a dowry of twelve ounces of gold and twenty camels, which was supplied by the liberality of his uncle.  <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">67</font></a> By this alliance, the son of Abdallah was restored to the station of his ancestors; and the judicious matron was content with his domestic virtues, till, in the fortieth year of his age,  <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">68</font></a> he assumed the title of a prophet, and proclaimed the religion of the Koran. </p>

 <p>     According to the tradition of his companions, Mahomet  <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">69</font></a> was distinguished by the beauty of his person, an outward gift which is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused.  Before he spoke, the orator engaged on his side the affections of a public or private audience. They applauded his commanding presence, his majestic aspect, his piercing eye, his gracious smile, his flowing beard, his countenance that painted every sensation of the soul, and his gestures that enforced each expression of the tongue.  In the familiar offices of life he scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of his country: his respectful attention to the rich and powerful was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest citizens of Mecca: the frankness of his manner concealed the artifice of his views; and the habits of courtesy were imputed to personal friendship or universal benevolence. His memory was capacious and retentive; his wit easy and social; his imagination sublime; his judgment clear, rapid, and decisive. He possessed the courage both of thought and action; and, although his designs might gradually expand with his success, the first idea which he entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original and superior genius.  The son of Abdallah was educated in the bosom of the noblest race, in the use of the purest dialect of Arabia; and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence. With these powers of eloquence, Mahomet was an illiterate Barbarian: his youth had never been instructed in the arts of reading and writing;  <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">70</font></a> the common ignorance exempted him from shame or reproach, but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence, and deprived of those faithful mirrors, which reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes.  Yet the book of nature and of man was open to his view; and some fancy has been indulged in the political and philosophical observations which are ascribed to the Arabian traveller.  <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">71</font></a> He compares the nations and the regions of the earth; discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman monarchies; beholds, with pity and indignation, the degeneracy of the times; and resolves to unite under one God and one king the invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs.  Our more accurate inquiry will suggest, that, instead of visiting the courts, the camps, the temples, of the East, the two journeys of Mahomet into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra and Damascus; that he was only thirteen years of age when he accompanied the caravan of his uncle; and that his duty compelled him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of Cadijah.  In these hasty and superficial excursions, the eye of genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser companions; some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful soil; but his ignorance of the Syriac language must have checked his curiosity; and I cannot perceive, in the life or writings of Mahomet, that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of the Arabian world.  From every region of that solitary world, the pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled, by the calls of devotion and commerce: in the free concourse of multitudes, a simple citizen, in his native tongue, might study the political state and character of the tribes, the theory and practice of the Jews and Christians.  Some useful strangers might be tempted, or forced, to implore the rights of hospitality; and the enemies of Mahomet have named the Jew, the Persian, and the Syrian monk, whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the composition of the Koran.  <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">72</font></a> Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius; and the uniformity of a work denotes the hand of a single artist.  From his earliest youth Mahomet was addicted to religious contemplation; each year, during the month of Ramadan, he withdrew from the world, and from the arms of Cadijah: in the cave of Hera, three miles from Mecca,  <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">73</font></a> he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is not in the heavens, but in the mind of the prophet.  The faith which, under the name of Islam, he preached to his family and nation, is compounded of an eternal truth, and a necessary fiction, That there is only one God, and that Mahomet is the apostle of God. </p>

        It is the boast of the Jewish apologists, that while the learned nations of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polytheism, their simple ancestors of Palestine preserved the knowledge and worship of the true God. The moral attributes of Jehovah may not easily be reconciled with the standard of human virtue: his metaphysical qualities are darkly expressed; but each page of the Pentateuch and the Prophets is an evidence of his power: the unity of his name is inscribed on the first table of the law; and his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible image of the invisible essence.  After the ruin of the temple, the faith of the Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the spiritual devotion of the synagogue; and the authority of Mahomet will not justify his perpetual reproach, that the Jews of Mecca or Medina adored Ezra as the son of God.  <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">74</font></a> But the children of Israel had ceased to be a people; and the religions of the world were guilty, at least in the eyes of the prophet, of giving sons, or daughters, or companions, to the supreme God. In the rude idolatry of the Arabs, the crime is manifest and audacious: the Sabians are poorly excused by the preeminence of the first planet, or intelligence, in their celestial hierarchy; and in the Magian system the conflict of the two principles betrays the imperfection of the conqueror.  The Christians of the seventh century had insensibly relapsed into a semblance of Paganism: their public and private vows were addressed to the relics and images that disgraced the temples of the East: the throne of the Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and saints, and angels, the objects of popular veneration; and the Collyridian heretics, who flourished in the fruitful soil of Arabia, invested the Virgin Mary with the name and honors of a goddess.  <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">75</font></a> The mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation appear to contradict the principle of the divine unity.  In their obvious sense, they introduce three equal deities, and transform the man Jesus into the substance of the Son of God:  <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">76</font></a> an orthodox commentary will satisfy only a believing mind: intemperate curiosity and zeal had torn the veil of the sanctuary; and each of the Oriental sects was eager to confess that all, except themselves, deserved the reproach of idolatry and polytheism.  The creed of Mahomet is free from suspicion or ambiguity; and the Koran is a glorious testimony to the unity of God.  The prophet of Mecca rejected the worship of idols and men, of stars and planets, on the rational principle that whatever rises must set, that whatever is born must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish.  <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">77</font></a> In the Author of the universe, his rational enthusiasm confessed and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or place, without issue or similitude, present to our most secret thoughts, existing by the necessity of his own nature, and deriving from himself all moral and intellectual perfection.  These sublime truths, thus announced in the language of the prophet,  <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">78</font></a> are firmly held by his disciples, and defined with metaphysical precision by the interpreters of the Koran.  A philosophic theist might subscribe the popular creed of the Mahometans;  <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">79</font></a> a creed too sublime, perhaps, for our present faculties. What object remains for the fancy, or even the understanding, when we have abstracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time and space, of motion and matter, of sensation and reflection? The first principle of reason and revolution was confirmed by the voice of Mahomet: his proselytes, from India to Morocco, are distinguished by the name of Unitarians; and the danger of idolatry has been prevented by the interdiction of images.  The doctrine of eternal decrees and absolute predestination is strictly embraced by the Mahometans; and they struggle, with the common difficulties, how to reconcile the prescience of God with the freedom and responsibility of man; how to explain the permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite goodness. </p>

 <p>     The God of nature has written his existence on all his works, and his law in the heart of man.  To restore the knowledge of the one, and the practice of the other, has been the real or pretended aim of the prophets of every age: the liberality of Mahomet allowed to his predecessors the same credit which he claimed for himself; and the chain of inspiration was prolonged from the fall of Adam to the promulgation of the Koran.  <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">80</font></a> During that period, some rays of prophetic light had been imparted to one hundred and twenty-four thousand of the elect, discriminated by their respective measure of virtue and grace; three hundred and thirteen apostles were sent with a special commission to recall their country from idolatry and vice; one hundred and four volumes have been dictated by the Holy Spirit; and six legislators of transcendent brightness have announced to mankind the six successive revelations of various rites, but of one immutable religion.  The authority and station of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, and Mahomet, rise in just gradation above each other; but whosoever hates or rejects any one of the prophets is numbered with the infidels.  The writings of the patriarchs were extant only in the apocryphal copies of the Greeks and Syrians:  <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">81</font></a> the conduct of Adam had not entitled him to the gratitude or respect of his children; the seven precepts of Noah were observed by an inferior and imperfect class of the proselytes of the synagogue;  <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">82</font></a> and the memory of Abraham was obscurely revered by the Sabians in his native land of Chaldaea: of the myriads of prophets, Moses and Christ alone lived and reigned; and the remnant of the inspired writings was comprised in the books of the Old and the New Testament.  The miraculous story of Moses is consecrated and embellished in the Koran;  <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">83</font></a> and the captive Jews enjoy the secret revenge of imposing their own belief on the nations whose recent creeds they deride.  For the author of Christianity, the Mahometans are taught by the prophet to entertain a high and mysterious reverence.  <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">84</font></a> "Verily, Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, is the apostle of God, and his word, which he conveyed unto Mary, and a Spirit proceeding from him; honorable in this world, and in the world to come, and one of those who approach near to the presence of God."  <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">85</font></a> The wonders of the genuine and apocryphal gospels  <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">86</font></a> are profusely heaped on his head; and the Latin church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception  <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">87</font></a> of his virgin mother. Yet Jesus was a mere mortal; and, at the day of judgment, his testimony will serve to condemn both the Jews, who reject him as a prophet, and the Christians, who adore him as the Son of God.  The malice of his enemies aspersed his reputation, and conspired against his life; but their intention only was guilty; a phantom or a criminal was substituted on the cross; and the innocent saint was translated to the seventh heaven.  <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">88</font></a> During six hundred years the gospel was the way of truth and salvation; but the Christians insensibly forgot both the laws and example of their founder; and Mahomet was instructed by the Gnostics to accuse the church, as well as the synagogue, of corrupting the integrity of the sacred text.  <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">89</font></a> The piety of Moses and of Christ rejoiced in the assurance of a future prophet, more illustrious than themselves: the evangelical promise of the Paraclete, or Holy Ghost, was prefigured in the name, and accomplished in the person, of Mahomet,  <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">90</font></a> the greatest and the last of the apostles of God. </p>

 <p><a name="fn_234"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_234">66</a> The safest aeras of Abulfeda, (in Vit. c. i. p. 2,) of Alexander, or the Greeks, 882, of Bocht Naser, or Nabonassar, 1316, equally lead us to the year 569.  The old Arabian calendar is too dark and uncertain to support the Benedictines, (Art. de Verifer les Dates, p. 15,) who, from the day of the month and week, deduce a new mode of calculation, and remove the birth of Mahomet to the year of Christ 570, the 10th of November.  Yet this date would agree with the year 882 of the Greeks, which is assigned by Elmacin (Hist. Saracen. p. 5) and Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p. 101, and Errata, Pocock's version.) While we refine our chronology, it is possible that the illiterate prophet was ignorant of his own age. </p> 
 <p>     Note: The date of the birth of Mahomet is not yet fixed with precision. It is only known from Oriental authors that he was born on a Monday, the 10th Reby 1st, the third month of the Mahometan year; the year 40 or 42 of Chosroes Nushirvan, king of Persia; the year 881 of the Seleucidan aera; the year 1316 of the aera of Nabonassar.  This leaves the point undecided between the years 569, 570, 571, of J. C.  See the Memoir of M. Silv. de Sacy, on divers events in the history of the Arabs before Mahomet, Mem. Acad. des Loscript. vol. xlvii. p. 527, 531.  St. Martin, vol. xi. p. 59. - M. </p> 
 <p>     Dr. Weil decides on A.D. 571.  Mahomet died in 632, aged 63; but the Arabs reckoned his life by lunar years, which reduces his life nearly to 61 (p. 21.) - M.  1845</p>
 <p><a name="fn_235"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_235">67</a> I copy the honorable testimony of Abu Taleb to his family and nephew.  Laus Dei, qui nos a stirpe Abrahami et semine Ismaelis constituit, et nobis regionem sacram dedit, et nos judices hominibus statuit.  Porro Mohammed filius Abdollahi nepotis mei (nepos meus) quo cum ex aequo librabitur e Koraishidis quispiam cui non praeponderaturus est, bonitate et excellentia, et intellectu et gloria, et acumine etsi opum inops fuerit, (et certe opes umbra transiens sunt et depositum quod reddi debet,) desiderio Chadijae filiae Chowailedi tenetur, et illa vicissim ipsius, quicquid autem dotis vice petieritis, ego in me suscipiam, (Pocock, Specimen, e septima parte libri Ebn Hamduni.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_236"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_236">68</a> The private life of Mahomet, from his birth to his mission, is preserved by Abulfeda, (in Vit. c. 3 - 7,) and the Arabian writers of genuine or apocryphal note, who are alleged by Hottinger, (Hist. Orient. p. 204 - 211) Maracci, (tom. i. p. 10 - 14,) and Gagnier, (Vie de Mahomet, tom. i. p. 97 - 134.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_237"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_237">69</a> Abulfeda, in Vit. c. lxv. lxvi. Gagnier, Vie de Mahomet, tom. iii. p. 272 - 289.  The best traditions of the person and conversation of the prophet are derived from Ayesha, Ali, and Abu Horaira, (Gagnier, tom. ii. p. 267.  Ockley's Hist. of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 149,) surnamed the Father of a Cat, who died in the year 59 of the Hegira. </p> 
 <p>     Note: Compare, likewise, the new Life of Mahomet (Mohammed der prophet) by Dr. Weil, (Stuttgart, 1843.) Dr. Weil has a new tradition, that Mahomet was at one time a shepherd.  This assimilation to the life of Moses, instead of giving probability to the story, as Dr. Weil suggests, makes it more suspicious.  Note, p. 34. - M. 1845.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_238"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_238">70</a> Those who believe that Mahomet could read or write are incapable of reading what is written with another pen, in the Suras, or chapters of the Koran, vii. xxix. xcvi.  These texts, and the tradition of the Sonna, are admitted, without doubt, by Abulfeda, (in Vit. vii.,) Gagnier, (Not. ad Abulfed. p. 15,) Pocock, (Specimen, p. 151,) Reland, (de Religione Mohammedica, p. 236,) and Sale, (Preliminary Discourse, p. 42.) Mr. White, almost alone, denies the ignorance, to accuse the imposture, of the prophet. His arguments are far from satisfactory. Two short trading journeys to the fairs of Syria were surely not sufficient to infuse a science so rare among the citizens of Mecca: it was not in the cool, deliberate act of treaty, that Mahomet would have dropped the mask; nor can any conclusion be drawn from the words of disease and delirium. The lettered youth, before he aspired to the prophetic character, must have often exercised, in private life, the arts of reading and writing; and his first converts, of his own family, would have been the first to detect and upbraid his scandalous hypocrisy, (White's Sermons, p. 203, 204, Notes, p. xxxvi. - xxxviii.) </p> 
 <p>     Note: (Academ. des Inscript. I. p. 295) has observed that the text of the seveth Sura implies that Mahomet could read, the tradition alone denies it, and, according to Dr. Weil, (p. 46,) there is another reading of the tradition, that "he could not read well." Dr. Weil is not quite so successful in explaining away Sura xxix.  It means, he thinks that he had not read any books, from which he could have borrowed. - M. 1845.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_239"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_239">71</a> The count de Boulainvilliers (Vie de Mahomet, p. 202 - 228) leads his Arabian pupil, like the Telemachus of Fenelon, or the Cyrus of Ramsay.  His journey to the court of Persia is probably a fiction nor can I trace the origin of his exclamation, "Les Grecs sont pour tant des hommes." The two Syrian journeys are expressed by almost all the Arabian writers, both Mahometans and Christians, (Gagnier Abulfed. p. 10.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_240"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_240">72</a> I am not at leisure to pursue the fables or conjectures which name the strangers accused or suspected by the infidels of Mecca, (Koran, c. 16, p. 223, c. 35, p. 297, with Sale's Remarks.  Prideaux's Life of Mahomet, p. 22 - 27.  Gagnier, Not. ad Abulfed. p. 11, 74.  Maracci, tom. ii. p. 400.) Even Prideaux has observed, that the transaction must have been secret, and that the scene lay in the heart of Arabia.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_241"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_241">73</a> Abulfeda in Vit. c. 7, p. 15.  Gagnier, tom. i. p. 133, 135. The situation of Mount Hera is remarked by Abulfeda (Geograph. Arab p. 4.) Yet Mahomet had never read of the cave of Egeria, ubi nocturnae Numa constituebat amicae, of the Idaean Mount, where Minos conversed with Jove, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_242"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_242">74</a> Koran, c. 9, p. 153.  Al Beidawi, and the other commentators quoted by Sale, adhere to the charge; but I do not understand that it is colored by the most obscure or absurd tradition of the Talmud.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_243"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_243">75</a> Hottinger, Hist. Orient. p. 225 - 228.  The Collyridian heresy was carried from Thrace to Arabia by some women, and the name was borrowed from the cake, which they offered to the goddess. This example, that of Beryllus bishop of Bostra, (Euseb. Hist. Eccles. l. vi. c. 33,) and several others, may excuse the reproach, Arabia haerese haersewn ferax.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_244"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_244">76</a> The three gods in the Koran (c. 4, p. 81, c. 5, p. 92) are obviously directed against our Catholic mystery: but the Arabic commentators understand them of the Father, the Son, and the Virgin Mary, an heretical Trinity, maintained, as it is said, by some Barbarians at the Council of Nice, (Eutych. Annal. tom. i. p. 440.) But the existence of the Marianites is denied by the candid Beausobre, (Hist. de Manicheisme, tom. i. p. 532;) and he derives the mistake from the word Roxah, the Holy Ghost, which in some Oriental tongues is of the feminine gender, and is figuratively styled the mother of Christ in the Gospel of the Nazarenes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_245"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_245">77</a> This train of thought is philosophically exemplified in the character of Abraham, who opposed in Chaldaea the first introduction of idolatry, (Koran, c. 6, p. 106.  D'Herbelot, Bibliot. Orient. p. 13.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_246"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_246">78</a> See the Koran, particularly the second, (p. 30,) the fifty-seventh, (p. 437,) the fifty-eighth (p. 441) chapters, which proclaim the omnipotence of the Creator.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_247"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_247">79</a> The most orthodox creeds are translated by Pocock, (Specimen, p. 274, 284 - 292,) Ockley, (Hist. of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. lxxxii. - xcv.,) Reland, (de Religion. Moham. l. i. p. 7 - 13,) and Chardin, (Voyages en Perse, tom. iv. p. 4 - 28.) The great truth, that God is without similitude, is foolishly criticized by Maracci, (Alcoran, tom. i. part iii. p. 87 - 94,) because he made man after his own image.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_248"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_248">80</a> Reland, de Relig. Moham. l. i. p. 17 - 47.  Sale's Preliminary Discourse, p. 73 - 76.  Voyage de Chardin, tom. iv. p. 28 - 37, and 37 - 47, for the Persian addition, "Ali is the vicar of God!" Yet the precise number of the prophets is not an article of faith.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_249"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_249">81</a> For the apocryphal books of Adam, see Fabricius, Codex Pseudepigraphus V. T. p. 27 - 29; of Seth, p. 154 - 157; of Enoch, p. 160 - 219.  But the book of Enoch is consecrated, in some measure, by the quotation of the apostle St. Jude; and a long legendary fragment is alleged by Syncellus and Scaliger. </p> 
 <p>     Note: The whole book has since been recovered in the Ethiopic language, - and has been edited and translated by Archbishop Lawrence, Oxford, 1881 - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_250">82</a> The seven precepts of Noah are explained by Marsham, (Canon Chronicus, p. 154 - 180,) who adopts, on this occasion, the learning and credulity of Selden.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_251"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_251">83</a> The articles of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, &amp;c., in the Bibliotheque of D'Herbelot, are gayly bedecked with the fanciful legends of the Mahometans, who have built on the groundwork of Scripture and the Talmud.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_252">84</a> Koran, c. 7, p. 128, &amp;c., c. 10, p. 173, &amp;c.  D'Herbelot, p. 647, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_253">85</a> Koran, c. 3, p. 40, c. 4. p. 80.  D'Herbelot, p. 399, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_254"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_254">86</a> See the Gospel of St. Thomas, or of the Infancy, in the Codex Apocryphus N. T. of Fabricius, who collects the various testimonies concerning it, (p. 128 - 158.) It was published in Greek by Cotelier, and in Arabic by Sike, who thinks our present copy more recent than Mahomet. Yet his quotations agree with the original about the speech of Christ in his cradle, his living birds of clay, &amp;c. (Sike, c. i. p. 168, 169, c. 36, p. 198, 199, c. 46, p. 206.  Cotelier, c. 2, p. 160, 161.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_255"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_255">87</a> It is darkly hinted in the Koran, (c. 3, p. 39,) and more clearly explained by the tradition of the Sonnites, (Sale's Note, and Maracci, tom. ii. p. 112.) In the xiith century, the immaculate conception was condemned by St. Bernard as a presumptuous novelty, (Fra Paolo, Istoria del Concilio di Trento, l. ii.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_256"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_256">88</a> See the Koran, c. 3, v. 53, and c. 4, v. 156, of Maracci's edition.  Deus est praestantissimus dolose agentium (an odd praise) ... nec crucifixerunt eum, sed objecta est eis similitudo; an expression that may suit with the system of the Docetes; but the commentators believe (Maracci, tom. ii. p. 113 - 115, 173.  Sale, p. 42, 43, 79) that another man, a friend or an enemy, was crucified in the likeness of Jesus; a fable which they had read in the Gospel of St. Barnabus, and which had been started as early as the time of Irenaeus, by some Ebionite heretics, (Beausobre, Hist. du Manicheisme, tom. ii. p. 25, Mosheim. de Reb. Christ. p. 353.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_257"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_257">89</a> This charge is obscurely urged in the Koran, (c. 3, p. 45;) but neither Mahomet, nor his followers, are sufficiently versed in languages and criticism to give any weight or color to their suspicions. Yet the Arians and Nestorians could relate some stories, and the illiterate prophet might listen to the bold assertions of the Manichaeans.  See Beausobre, tom. i. p. 291 - 305.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_258"></a><a href="daf05009.htm#fr_258">90</a> Among the prophecies of the Old and New Testament, which are perverted by the fraud or ignorance of the Mussulmans, they apply to the prophet the promise of the Paraclete, or Comforter, which had been already usurped by the Montanists and Manichaeans, (Beausobre, Hist. Critique du Manicheisme, tom. i. p. 263, &amp;c.;) and the easy change of letters affords the etymology of the name of Mohammed, (Maracci, tom. i. part i. p. 15 - 28.)</p>
