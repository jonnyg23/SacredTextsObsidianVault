 <p>     By the death of Crispus, the inheritance of the empire seemed to devolve on the three sons of Fausta, who have been already mentioned under the names of Constantine, of Constantius, and of Constans.  These young princes were successively invested with the title of Caesar; and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth, the twentieth, and the thirtieth years of the reign of their father.  <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">29</font></a> This conduct, though it tended to multiply the future masters of the Roman world, might be excused by the partiality of paternal affection; but it is not so easy to understand the motives of the emperor, when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people, by the unnecessary elevation of his two nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">*_0031</font></a>   The former was raised, by the title of Caesar, to an equality with his cousins.  In favor of the latter, Constantine invented the new and singular appellation of Nobilissimus;  <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">30</font></a> to which he annexed the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold.  But of the whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire, Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title of King; a name which the subjects of Tiberius would have detested, as the profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny.  The use of such a title, even as it appears under the reign of Constantine, is a strange and unconnected fact, which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of Imperial medals and contemporary writers.  <a name="fr_444"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">31</font></a> </p>

 <p>     The whole empire was deeply interested in the education of these five youths, the acknowledged successors of Constantine.  The exercise of the body prepared them for the fatigues of war and the duties of active life. Those who occasionally mention the education or talents of Constantius, allow that he excelled in the gymnastic arts of leaping and running that he was a dexterous archer, a skilful horseman, and a master of all the different weapons used in the service either of the cavalry or of the infantry.  <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">32</font></a> The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed, though not perhaps with equal success, to improve the minds of the sons and nephews of Constantine.  <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">33</font></a> The most celebrated professors of the Christian faith, of the Grecian philosophy, and of the Roman jurisprudence, were invited by the liberality of the emperor, who reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal youths in the science of government, and the knowledge of mankind.  But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by adversity and experience.  In the free intercourse of private life, and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius, he had learned to command his own passions, to encounter those of his equals, and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct.  His destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the imperial purple.  Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers, they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury, and the expectation of a throne; nor would the dignity of their rank permit them to descend from that elevated station from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect.  The indulgence of Constantine admitted them, at a very tender age, to share the administration of the empire; and they studied the art of reigning, at the expense of the people intrusted to their care.  The younger Constantine was appointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his brother Constantius exchanged that department, the ancient patrimony of their father, for the more opulent, but less martial, countries of the East.  Italy, the Western Illyricum, and Africa, were accustomed to revere Constans, the third of his sons, as the representative of the great Constantine.  He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier, to which he annexed the government of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece.  The city of Caesarea was chosen for the residence of Hannibalianus; and the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the Lesser Armenia, were destined to form the extent of his new kingdom.  For each of these princes a suitable establishment was provided.  A just proportion of guards, of legions, and of auxiliaries, was allotted for their respective dignity and defence.  The ministers and generals, who were placed about their persons, were such as Constantine could trust to assist, and even to control, these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power.  As they advanced in years and experience, the limits of their authority were insensibly enlarged: but the emperor always reserved for himself the title of Augustus; and while he showed the Caesars to the armies and provinces, he maintained every part of the empire in equal obedience to its supreme head.  <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">34</font></a> The tranquillity of the last fourteen years of his reign was scarcely interrupted by the contemptible insurrection of a camel-driver in the Island of Cyprus,  <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">35</font></a> or by the active part which the policy of Constantine engaged him to assume in the wars of the Goths and Sarmatians. </p>

 <p>     Among the different branches of the human race, the Sarmatians form a very remarkable shade; as they seem to unite the manners of the Asiatic barbarians with the figure and complexion of the ancient inhabitants of Europe.  According to the various accidents of peace and war, of alliance or conquest, the Sarmatians were sometimes confined to the banks of the Tanais; and they sometimes spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the Vistula and the Volga.  <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">36</font></a> The care of their numerous flocks and herds, the pursuit of game, and the exercises of war, or rather of rapine, directed the vagrant motions of the Sarmatians.  The movable camps or cities, the ordinary residence of their wives and children, consisted only of large wagons drawn by oxen, and covered in the form of tents.  The military strength of the nation was composed of cavalry; and the custom of their warriors, to lead in their hand one or two spare horses, enabled them to advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence, which surprised the security, and eluded the pursuit, of a distant enemy.  <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">37</font></a> Their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a sort of cuirass, which was capable of resisting a sword or javelin, though it was formed only of horses' hoofs, cut into thin and polished slices, carefully laid over each other in the manner of scales or feathers, and strongly sewed upon an under garment of coarse linen.  <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">38</font></a> The offensive arms of the Sarmatians were short daggers, long lances, and a weighty bow vow with a quiver of arrows.  They were reduced to the necessity of employing fish- bones for the points of their weapons; but the custom of dipping them in a venomous liquor, that poisoned the wounds which they inflicted, is alone sufficient to prove the most savage manners, since a people impressed with a sense of humanity would have abhorred so cruel a practice, and a nation skilled in the arts of war would have disdained so impotent a resource.  <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">39</font></a> Whenever these Barbarians issued from their deserts in quest of prey, their shaggy beards, uncombed locks, the furs with which they were covered from head to foot, and their fierce countenances, which seemed to express the innate cruelty of their minds, inspired the more civilized provincials of Rome with horror and dismay. </p>

        The tender Ovid, after a youth spent in the enjoyment of fame and luxury, was condemned to a hopeless exile on the frozen banks of the Danube, where he was exposed, almost without defence, to the fury of these monsters of the desert, with whose stern spirits he feared that his gentle shade might hereafter be confounded.  In his pathetic, but sometimes unmanly lamentations,  <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">40</font></a> he describes in the most lively colors the dress and manners, the arms and inroads, of the Getae and Sarmatians, who were associated for the purposes of destruction; and from the accounts of history there is some reason to believe that these Sarmatians were the Jazygae, one of the most numerous and warlike tribes of the nation.  The allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a permanent establishment on the frontiers of the empire.  Soon after the reign of Augustus, they obliged the Dacians, who subsisted by fishing on the banks of the River Teyss or Tibiscus, to retire into the hilly country, and to abandon to the victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper Hungary, which are bounded by the course of the Danube and the semicircular enclosure of the Carpathian Mountains.  <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">41</font></a> In this advantageous position, they watched or suspended the moment of attack, as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents; they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons, and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate their name by any memorable exploits, they occasionally assisted their eastern and western neighbors, the Goths and the Germans, with a formidable body of cavalry.  They lived under the irregular aristocracy of their chieftains:  <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">42</font></a> but after they had received into their bosom the fugitive Vandals, who yielded to the pressure of the Gothic power, they seem to have chosen a king from that nation, and from the illustrious race of the Astingi, who had formerly dwelt on the hores of the northern ocean.  <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">43</font></a>  
   
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
        This motive of enmity must have inflamed the subjects of contention, which perpetually arise on the confines of warlike and independent nations. The Vandal princes were stimulated by fear and revenge; the Gothic kings aspired to extend their dominion from the Euxine to the frontiers of Germany; and the waters of the Maros, a small river which falls into the Teyss, were stained with the blood of the contending Barbarians.  After some experience of the superior strength and numbers of their adversaries, the Sarmatians implored the protection of the Roman monarch, who beheld with pleasure the discord of the nations, but who was justly alarmed by the progress of the Gothic arms.  As soon as Constantine had declared himself in favor of the weaker party, the haughty Araric, king of the Goths, instead of expecting the attack of the legions, boldly passed the Danube, and spread terror and devastation through the province of Maesia.  To oppose the inroad of this destroying host, the aged emperor took the field in person; but on this occasion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so many foreign and domestic wars.  He had the mortification of seeing his troops fly before an inconsiderable detachment of the Barbarians, who pursued them to the edge of their fortified camp, and obliged him to consult his safety by a precipitate and ignominious retreat.  <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">*_0032</font></a> The event of a second and more successful action retrieved the honor of the Roman name; and the powers of art and discipline prevailed, after an obstinate contest, over the efforts of irregular valor. The broken army of the Goths abandoned the field of battle, the wasted province, and the passage of the Danube: and although the eldest of the sons of Constantine was permitted to supply the place of his father, the merit of the victory, which diffused universal joy, was ascribed to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself. </p> 
 <p>
        He contributed at least to improve this advantage, by his negotiations with the free and warlike people of Chersonesus,  <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">44</font></a> whose capital, situate on the western coast of the Tauric or Crimaean peninsula, still retained some vestiges of a Grecian colony, and was governed by a perpetual magistrate, assisted by a council of senators, emphatically styled the Fathers of the City.  The Chersonites were animated against the Goths, by the memory of the wars, which, in the preceding century, they had maintained with unequal forces against the invaders of their country.  They were connected with the Romans by the mutual benefits of commerce; as they were supplied from the provinces of Asia with corn and manufactures, which they purchased with their only productions, salt, wax, and hides.  Obedient to the requisition of Constantine, they prepared, under the conduct of their magistrate Diogenes, a considerable army, of which the principal strength consisted in cross-bows and military chariots.  The speedy march and intrepid attack of the Chersonites, by diverting the attention of the Goths, assisted the operations of the Imperial generals.  The Goths, vanquished on every side, were driven into the mountains, where, in the course of a severe campaign, above a hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold and hunger Peace was at length granted to their humble supplications; the eldest son of Araric was accepted as the most valuable hostage; and Constantine endeavored to convince their chiefs, by a liberal distribution of honors and rewards, how far the friendship of the Romans was preferable to their enmity.  In the expressions of his gratitude towards the faithful Chersonites, the emperor was still more magnificent. The pride of the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal decorations bestowed on their magistrate and his successors.  A perpetual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea.  A regular subsidy was promised, of iron, corn, oil, and of every supply which could be useful either in peace or war.  But it was thought that the Sarmatians were sufficiently rewarded by their deliverance from impending ruin; and the emperor, perhaps with too strict an economy, deducted some part of the expenses of the war from the customary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation.  
  </p> 
 <p>     Exasperated by this apparent neglect, the Sarmatians soon forgot, with the levity of barbarians, the services which they had so lately received, and the dangers which still threatened their safety.  Their inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the indignation of Constantine to leave them to their fate; and he no longer opposed the ambition of Geberic, a renowned warrior, who had recently ascended the Gothic throne.  Wisumar, the Vandal king, whilst alone, and unassisted, he defended his dominions with undaunted courage, was vanquished and slain in a decisive battle, which swept away the flower of the Sarmatian youth.  <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">*_0033</font></a> The remainder of the nation embraced the desperate expedient of arming their slaves, a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen, by whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat, and expelled the invader from their confines.  But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy, more dangerous and more implacable.  Enraged by their former servitude, elated by their present glory, the slaves, under the name of Limigantes, claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had saved.  Their masters, unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of the populace, preferred the hardships of exile to the tyranny of their servants.  Some of the fugitive Sarmatians solicited a less ignominious dependence, under the hostile standard of the Goths.  A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian Mountains, among the Quadi, their German allies, and were easily admitted to share a superfluous waste of uncultivated land.  But the far greater part of the distressed nation turned their eyes towards the fruitful provinces of Rome.  Imploring the protection and forgiveness of the emperor, they solemnly promised, as subjects in peace, and as soldiers in war, the most inviolable fidelity to the empire which should graciously receive them into its bosom.  According to the maxims adopted by Probus and his successors, the offers of this barbarian colony were eagerly accepted; and a competent portion of lands in the provinces of Pannonia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Italy, were immediately assigned for the habitation and subsistence of three hundred thousand Sarmatians.  <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">45</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p>

  </p> 
 <p>     By chastising the pride of the Goths, and by accepting the homage of a suppliant nation, Constantine asserted the majesty of the Roman empire; and the ambassadors of Aethiopia, Persia, and the most remote countries of India, congratulated the peace and prosperity of his government.  <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">46</font></a> If he reckoned, among the favors of fortune, the death of his eldest son, of his nephew, and perhaps of his wife, he enjoyed an uninterrupted flow of private as well as public felicity, till the thirtieth year of his reign; a period which none of his predecessors, since Augustus, had been permitted to celebrate.  Constantine survived that solemn festival about ten months; and at the mature age of sixty-four, after a short illness, he ended his memorable life at the palace of Aquyrion, in the suburbs of Nicomedia, whither he had retired for the benefit of the air, and with the hope of recruiting his exhausted strength by the use of the warm baths.  The excessive demonstrations of grief, or at least of mourning, surpassed whatever had been practised on any former occasion.  Notwithstanding the claims of the senate and people of ancient Rome, the corpse of the deceased emperor, according to his last request, was transported to the city, which was destined to preserve the name and memory of its founder.  The body of Constantine adorned with the vain symbols of greatness, the purple and diadem, was deposited on a golden bed in one of the apartments of the palace, which for that purpose had been splendidly furnished and illuminated.  The forms of the court were strictly maintained.  Every day, at the appointed hours, the principal officers of the state, the army, and the household, approaching the person of their sovereign with bended knees and a composed countenance, offered their respectful homage as seriously as if he had been still alive.  From motives of policy, this theatrical representation was for some time continued; nor could flattery neglect the opportunity of remarking that Constantine alone, by the peculiar indulgence of Heaven, had reigned after his death.  <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">47</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
        But this reign could subsist only in empty pageantry; and it was soon discovered that the will of the most absolute monarch is seldom obeyed, when his subjects have no longer anything to hope from his favor, or to dread from his resentment.  The same ministers and generals, who bowed with such referential awe before the inanimate corpse of their deceased sovereign, were engaged in secret consultations to exclude his two nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus, from the share which he had assigned them in the succession of the empire.  We are too imperfectly acquainted with the court of Constantine to form any judgment of the real motives which influenced the leaders of the conspiracy; unless we should suppose that they were actuated by a spirit of jealousy and revenge against the praefect Ablavius, a proud favorite, who had long directed the counsels and abused the confidence of the late emperor.  The arguments, by which they solicited the concurrence of the soldiers and people, are of a more obvious nature; and they might with decency, as well as truth, insist on the superior rank of the children of Constantine, the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns, and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic, from the discord of so many rival princes, who were not connected by the tender sympathy of fraternal affection.  The intrigue was conducted with zeal and secrecy, till a loud and unanimous declaration was procured from the troops, that they would suffer none except the sons of their lamented monarch to reign over the Roman empire.  <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">48</font></a> The younger Dalmatius, <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">49</font></a> who was united with his collateral relations by the ties of friendship and interest, is allowed to have inherited a considerable share of the abilities of the great Constantine; but, on this occasion, he does not appear to have concerted any measure for supporting, by arms, the just claims which himself and his royal brother derived from the liberality of their uncle.  Astonished and overwhelmed by the tide of popular fury, they seem to have remained, without the power of flight or of resistance, in the hands of their implacable enemies.  Their fate was suspended till the arrival of Constantius, the second, and perhaps the most favored, of the sons of Constantine. </p>

The venom was commonly extracted from the vegetable reign: but that employed by the Scythians appears to have been drawn from the viper, and a mixture of human blood.

They exhibit a picture of the human mind under very singular circumstances; and they contain many curious observations, which no Roman except Ovid, could have an opportunity of making.  Every circumstance which tends to illustrate the history of the Barbarians, has been drawn together by the very accurate Count de Buat. Hist.

 <p><a name="fn_456"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_456">43</a> This hypothesis of a Vandal king reigning over Sarmatian subjects, seems necessary to reconcile the Goth Jornandes with the Greek and Latin historians of Constantine.  It may be observed that Isidore, who lived in Spain under the dominion of the Goths, gives them for enemies, not the Vandals, but the Sarmatians.  See his Chronicle in Grotius, p. 709.       Note: I have already noticed the confusion which must necessarily arise in history, when names purely geographical, as this of Sarmatia, are taken for historical names belonging to a single nation.  We perceive it here; it has forced Gibbon to suppose, without any reason but the necessity of extricating himself from his perplexity, that the Sarmatians had taken a king from among the Vandals; a supposition entirely contrary to the usages of Barbarians Dacia, at this period, was occupied, not by Sarmatians, who have never formed a distinct race, but by Vandals, whom the ancients have often confounded under the general term Sarmatians. See Gatterer's Welt-Geschiehte p. 464 - G.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_457"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_457">*_0032</a> Gibbon states, that Constantine was defeated by the Goths in a first battle.  No ancient author mentions such an event.  It is, no doubt, a mistake in Gibbon.  St Martin, note to Le Beau. i. 324. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_458"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_458">44</a> I may stand in need of some apology for having used, without scruple, the authority of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in all that relates to the wars and negotiations of the Chersonites.  I am aware that he was a Greek of the tenth century, and that his accounts of ancient history are frequently confused and fabulous.  But on this occasion his narrative is, for the most part, consistent and probable nor is there much difficulty in conceiving that an emperor might have access to some secret archives, which had escaped the diligence of meaner historians.  For the situation and history of Chersone, see Peyssonel, des Peuples barbares qui ont habite les Bords du Danube, c. xvi.  84-90. </p> 
 <p>     Note: Gibbon has confounded the inhabitants of the city of Cherson, the ancient Chersonesus, with the people of the Chersonesus Taurica. If he had read with more attention the chapter of Constantius Porphyrogenitus, from which this narrative is derived, he would have seen that the author clearly distinguishes the republic of Cherson from the rest of the Tauric Peninsula, then possessed by the kings of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, and that the city of Cherson alone furnished succors to the Romans.  The English historian is also mistaken in saying that the Stephanephoros of the Chersonites was a perpetual magistrate; since it is easy to discover from the great number of Stephanephoroi mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, that they were annual magistrates, like almost all those which governed the Grecian republics.  St. Martin, note to Le Beau i. 326. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_459"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_459">*_0033</a> Gibbon supposes that this war took place because Constantine had deducted a part of the customary gratifications, granted by his predecessors to the Sarmatians.  Nothing of this kind appears in the authors.  We see, on the contrary, that after his victory, and to punish the Sarmatia is for the ravages they had committed, he withheld the sums which it had been the custom to bestow.  St. Martin, note to Le Beau, i. 327. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_460"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_460">45</a> The Gothic and Sarmatian wars are related in so broken and imperfect a manner, that I have been obliged to compare the following writers, who mutually supply, correct, and illustrate each other.  Those who will take the same trouble, may acquire a right of criticizing my narrative.  Ammianus, l. xvii. c. 12.  Anonym. Valesian. p. 715. Eutropius, x. 7.  Sextus Rufus de Provinciis, c. 26.  Julian Orat. i. p. 9, and Spanheim, Comment. p. 94.  Hieronym. in Chron. Euseb. in Vit. Constantin. l. iv. c. 6.  Socrates, l. i. c. 18.  Sozomen, l. i. c. 8. Zosimus, l. ii. p. 108.  Jornandes de Reb. Geticis, c. 22.  Isidorus in Chron. p. 709; in Hist. Gothorum Grotii.  Constantin.  Porphyrogenitus de Administrat. Imperii, c. 53, p. 208, edit. Meursii. </p>

 <p><a name="fn_461"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_461">46</a> Eusebius (in Vit. Const. l. iv. c. 50) remarks three circumstances relative to these Indians.  1. They came from the shores of the eastern ocean; a description which might be applied to the coast of China or Coromandel.  2. They presented shining gems, and unknown animals. 3. They protested their kings had erected statues to represent the supreme majesty of Constantine.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_462"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_462">47</a> Funus relatum in urbem sui nominis, quod sane P. R. aegerrime tulit.  Aurelius Victor.  Constantine prepared for himself a stately tomb in the church of the Holy Apostles.  Euseb. l. iv. c. 60.  The best, and indeed almost the only account of the sickness, death, and funeral of Constantine, is contained in the fourth book of his Life by Eusebius.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_463"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_463">48</a> Eusebius (l. iv. c. 6) terminates his narrative by this loyal declaration of the troops, and avoids all the invidious circumstances of the subsequent massacre.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_464"></a><a href="daf02016.htm#fr_464">49</a> The character of Dalmatius is advantageously, though concisely  drawn by Eutropius.  (x. 9.) Dalmatius Ceasar prosperrima indole, neque patrou absimilis, haud multo post oppressus est factione militari.  As both Jerom and the Alexandrian Chronicle mention the third year of the Ceasar, which did not commence till the 18th or 24th of September, A. D. 337, it is certain that these military factions continued above four months.</p>
