 This short review of the Greek pantheon (alas, there is little about Rome),
 is part of a series of inexpensive adult education
 books published during the 1920s.
 The author, Jane Harrison, was one of the most prominent classicists of
 the era; so this is a bit like hiring a French chef to cook up a big
 mess of <i>pommes frites</i>.
 Besides being a respected academic,
 Harrison influenced many of the 20th century
 <a href="../../pag/index.htm">neo-Pagans</a>
 and <a href="../../wmn/index.htm">Goddess</a> theorists.
 </p>
 <p>
 Harrison is making a point here:
 Greek mythology was not the static pageant that we learned in school,
 or read in <a href="../bulf/index.htm">Bulfinch</a>.
 It did not spring forth fully formed, but evolved out of a set of ancient
 local deities.
 She proposes that the Greek goddesses emerged from native Pelasgian
 tutelary spirits, and much of the male pantheon was imposed by Indo-Europeans.
 Her analysis of the evolution of the attributes of the god Poseidon as
 originating from a Minoan bull god is speculative but intriguing.
 Whether Harrison was correct or not, her reexamination of this subject
 which has been covered so many times is refreshing.
