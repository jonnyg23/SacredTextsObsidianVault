 <p align="center">GLYKERA</p>  
 <p>By the way, Thais, do you remember the Arcanian, the soldier who used to live with Abrotonan and later fell in love with me? The fellow was always under the purple and <i>chlamys</i>. Do you know him?</p>  
 <p align="center">THAIS</p>  
 <p>Yes, my little Glykera, I know him. He went to bed with me last year at the time of the feast of Demeter. What do you know about the man?</p>  
 <p align="center">GLYKERA</p>  
 <p>That wicked Gorgona, who I thought was a friend of mine, played around him so shrewdly that she stole him from me.</p>  
 <p align="center">THAIS</p>  
 <p>And now he no longer visits you? Gorgona has become his mistress, eh?</p>  
 <p align="center">GLYKERA</p>  
 <p>Yes, Thais, and I am terribly hurt.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">THAIS</p>  
 <p>That's bad, dear Glykera; but it can't be helped. Such things are to be expected among us hetairas. You ought not to worry about it and don't you speak ill of Gorgona. Abrotonan has said nothing bad about you in the same situation; you are still friends. But I wonder what that soldier sees in the woman. He must be slightly blind not to notice how little hair she has left. Her lips are livid, almost cadaverous, and her neck is thin. And she has bulging veins and a nose that is long, much too long. However, there is one attractive feature about her: she is tall and bears herself very erect. And then her rump, they say, is soft and white, and the skin between her thighs is entirely hairless. It is as smooth as your face. And you will concede that she has a fascinating smile.</p>  
 <p align="center">GLYKERA</p>  
 <p>So you believe that it is for her beauty that the Arcanian loves her? You don't know, then, that her mother is the sorceress Chrysarion. The witch knows the Thettalian charms and can make the moon come down to earth. People say she flies in the air by night. It was the sorceress who must have turned the soldier's</p>  
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a></p>  
 <p>head. She has made him drink certain magic potions. And now that Gorgona hugs him between her legs.</p>  
 <p align="center">THAIS</p>  
 <p>And your voluptuous little legs, my Glykera, will hug another. But you may say good-bye to this man!</p>
