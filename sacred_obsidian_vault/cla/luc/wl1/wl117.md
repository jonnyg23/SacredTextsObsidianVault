   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">VII</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Hephaestus. Apollo</i></p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. Have you seen Maia's baby, Apollo? such a pretty little thing, with a smile for everybody; you can see it is going to be a treasure.</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. That baby a treasure? well, in mischief, Iapetus is young beside it.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. Why, what harm can it do, only just born?</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. Ask Posidon; it stole his trident. Ask Ares; he was surprised to find his sword gone out of the scabbard. Not to mention myself, disarmed of bow and arrows.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. Never! that infant? he has hardly found his legs yet; he is not out of his baby-linen.</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. Ah, you will find out, Hephaestus, if he gets within reach of you.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. He has been.</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. Well? all your tools safe? none missing?</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. Of course not.</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. I advise you to make sure.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. Zeus! where are my pincers?</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. Ah, you will find them among the baby-linen.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. So light-fingered? one would swear he had practised petty larceny in the womb.</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. Ah, and you don't know what a glib young chatterbox he is; and, if he has his way, he is to be our errand-boy! Yesterday he challenged Eros--tripped up his heels somehow, and had</p>

 <p>him on his back in a twinkling; before the applause was over, he had taken the opportunity of a congratulatory hug from Aphrodite to steal her girdle; Zeus had not done laughing before--the sceptre was gone. If the thunderbolt had not been too heavy, and very hot, he would have made away with that too.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. The child has some spirit in him, by your account.</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. Spirit, yes--and some music, moreover, young as he is.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. How can you tell that?</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. He picked up a dead tortoise somewhere or other, and contrived an instrument with it. He fitted horns to it, with a cross-bar, stuck in pegs, inserted a bridge, and played a sweet tuneful thing that made an old harper like me quite envious. Even at night, Maia was saying, he does not stay in Heaven; he goes down poking his nose into Hades--on a thieves' errand, no doubt. Then he has a pair of wings, and he has made himself a magic wand, which he uses for marshalling souls--convoying the dead to their place.</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. Ah, I gave him that, for a toy.</p>  
 <p><i>Ap</i>. And by way of payment he stole--</p>  
 <p><i>Heph</i>. Well thought on; I must go and get them; you may be right about the baby-linen.</p>
