   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">V</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Panope. Galene</i></p>  
 <p><i>Pa</i>. Galene, did you see what Eris did yesterday at the Thessalian banquet, because she had not had an invitation?</p>  
 <p><i>Ga</i>. No, I was not with you; Posidon had told me to keep the sea quiet for the occasion. What did Eris do, then, if she was not there?</p>  
 <p><i>Pa</i>. Thetis and Peleus had just gone off to the bridal chamber, conducted by Amphitrite and Posidon, when Eris came in unnoticed--which was easy enough; some were drinking, some dancing, or attending to Apollo's lyre or the Muses' songs--Well, she threw down a lovely apple, solid gold, my dear; and there was written on it, FOR THE FAIR. It rolled along as if it knew what it was about, till it came in front of Hera, Aphrodite, and Athene. Hermes picked it up and read out the inscription; of course we Nereids kept quiet; what should <i>we</i> do in such company? But they all made for it, each insisting that it was hers; and if Zeus had not parted them, there would have been a battle. He would not decide the matter himself, though they asked him to. 'Go, all of you, to Ida,' he said, 'to the son of Priam; he is a man of taste, quite capable of picking out the beauty; he will be no bad judge.'</p>  
 <p><i>Ga</i>. Yes. and the Goddesses, Panope?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Pa</i>. They are going to Ida to-day, I believe; we shall soon have news of the result.</p>  
 <p><i>Ga</i>. Oh, I can tell you that now; if the umpire is not a blind man, no one else can win, with Aphrodite in for it.</p>
