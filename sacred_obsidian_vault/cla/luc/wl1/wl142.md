   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">XI</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Xanthus. The Sea</i></p>  
 <p><i>Xan</i>. O Sea, take me to you; see how horribly I have been treated; cool my wounds for me.</p>  
 <p><i>Sea</i>. What is this, Xanthus? who has burned you?</p>  
 <p><i>Xan</i>. Hephaestus. Oh, I am burned to cinders! oh, oh, oh, I boil!</p>  
 <p><i>Sea</i>. What made him use his fire upon you?</p>  
 <p><i>Xan</i>. Why, it was all that son of your Thetis. He was slaughtering the Phrygians; I tried entreaties, but he went raging on, damming my stream with their bodies; I was so sorry for the poor wretches, I poured down to see if I could make a flood and frighten him off them. But Hephaestus happened to be about, and he must have collected every particle of fire he had in Etna or anywhere else; on he came at me, scorched my elms and tamarisks, baked the poor fishes and eels, made me boil over, and very nearly dried me up altogether. You see what a state I am in with the burns.</p>  
 <p><i>Sea</i>. Indeed you are thick and hot, Xanthus, and no wonder; the dead men's blood accounts for one, and the fire for the other, according to your story. Well, and serve you right; assaulting my grandson, indeed! paying no more respect to the son of a Nereid than that!</p>  
 <p><i>Xan</i>. Was I not to take compassion on the Phrygians? they are my neighbours.</p>  
 <p><i>Sea</i>. And was Hephaestus not to take compassion on Achilles? He is the son of Thetis.</p>
