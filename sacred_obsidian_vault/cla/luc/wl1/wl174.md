 <p align="center"><i>Agamemnon. Ajax</i></p>  
 <p><i>Ag</i>. If you went mad and wrought your own destruction, Ajax, in default of that you designed for us all, why put the blame on Odysseus? Why would you not vouchsafe him a look or a word, when he came to consult Tiresias that day? you stalked past your old comrade in arms as if he was beneath your notice.</p>  
 <p><i>Aj</i>. Had I not good reason? My madness lies at the door of my solitary rival for the arms.</p>

 <p><i>Ag</i>. Did you expect to be unopposed, and carry it over us all without a contest?</p>  
 <p><i>Aj</i>. Surely, in such a matter. The armour was mine by natural right, seeing I was Achilles's cousin. The rest of you, his undoubted superiors, refused to compete, recognizing my claim. It was the son of Laertes, he that I had rescued scores of times when he would have been cut to pieces by the Phrygians, who set up for a better man and a stronger claimant than I.</p>

 <p><i>Ag</i>. Surely, Ajax, a mere man may be forgiven the sin of coveting honour--that sweetest bait for which each one of us adventured; nay, and he outdid you there, if a Trojan verdict counts.</p>  
 <p><i>Aj</i>. Who inspired that verdict <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">1</font></a>? I know, but about the Gods we may not speak. Let that pass; but cease to hate Odysseus? ’tis not in my power, Agamemnon, though Athene's self should require it of me.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_14"></a><a href="wl174.htm#fr_14">154:1</a> Athene is meant. The allusion is to Homer, <i>Od</i>. xi. 547, a passage upon the contest for the arms of Achilles, in which Odysseus states that 'The judges were the sons of the Trojans, and Pallas Athene.'</p>
