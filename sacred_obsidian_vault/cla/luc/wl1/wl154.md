   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD</h1>  <h3 align="center">IX</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Simylus. Polystratus</i></p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. So here you are at last, Polystratus; you must be something very like a centenarian.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Ninety-eight.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. And what sort of a life have you had of it, these thirty years? you were about seventy when I died.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Delightful, though you may find it hard to believe.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. It is surprising that you could have any joy of your life--old, weak, and childless, moreover.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. In the first place, I could do just what I liked; there were still plenty of handsome boys and dainty women; perfumes were sweet, wine kept its bouquet, Sicilian feasts were nothing to mine.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. This <i>is</i> a change, to be sure; you were very economical in my day.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Ah, but, my simple friend, these good things were presents--came in streams. From dawn my doors were thronged with visitors, and in the day it was a procession of the fairest gifts of earth.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Why, you must have seized the crown after my death.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Oh no, it was only that I inspired a number of tender passions.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Tender passions, indeed! what, you, an old man with hardly a tooth left in your head!</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Certainly; the first of our townsmen were in love with me. Such as you see me, old, bald, blear-eyed, rheumy, they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a></p>  
 <p>delighted to do me honour; happy was the man on whom my glance rested a moment.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Well, then, you had some adventure like Phaon's, when he rowed Aphrodite across from Chios; your God granted your prayer and made you young and fair and lovely again.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. No, no; I was as you see me, and I was the object of all desire.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Oh, I give it up.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Why, I should have thought you knew the violent passion for old men who have plenty of money and no children.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Ah, now I comprehend your beauty, old fellow; it was the <i>Golden</i> Aphrodite bestowed it.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. I assure you, Simylus, I had a good deal of satisfaction out of my lovers; they idolized me, almost. Often I would be coy and shut some of them out. Such rivalries! such jealous emulations!</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. And how did you dispose of your fortune in the end?</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. I gave each an express promise to make him my heir; he believed, and treated me to more attentions than ever; meanwhile I had another genuine will, which was the one I left, with a message to them all to go hang.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Who was the heir by this one? one of your relations, I suppose.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Not likely; it was a handsome young Phrygian I had lately bought.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Age?</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. About twenty.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Ah, I can guess his office.</p>  
 <p><i>Pol</i>. Well, you know, he deserved the inheritance much better than they did; he was a barbarian and a rascal; but by this time he has the best of society at his beck. So he inherited; and now he is one of the aristocracy; his smooth chin and his</p>  
 <p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a></p>  
 <p>foreign accent are no bars to his being called nobler than Codrus, handsomer than Nireus, wiser than Odysseus.</p>  
 <p><i>Si</i>. Well, <i>I</i> don't mind; let him be Emperor of Greece, if he likes, so long as he keeps the property away from that other crew.</p>
