   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD</h1>  <h3 align="center">XXII</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Charon. Menippus. Hermes</i></p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. Your fare, you rascal.</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. Bawl away, Charon, if it gives you any pleasure.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. I brought you across: give me my fare.</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. I can't, if I haven't got it.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. And who is so poor that he has not got a penny?</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. I for one; I don't know who else.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. Pay: or, by Pluto, I'll strangle you.</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. And I'll crack your skull with this stick.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. So you are to come all that way for nothing?</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. Let Hermes pay for me: he put me on board.</p>  
 <p><i>Her</i>. I dare say! A fine time I shall have of it, if I am to pay for the shades.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. I'm not going to let you off.</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. You can haul up your ship and wait, for all I care. If I have not got the money, I can't pay you, can I?</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. You knew you ought to bring it?</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. I knew that: but I hadn't got it. What would you have? I ought not to have died, I suppose?</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. So you are to have the distinction of being the only passenger that ever crossed gratis?</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. Oh, come now: gratis! I took an oar, and I baled; and I didn't cry, which is more than can be said for any of the others.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. That's neither here nor there. I must have my penny; it's only right.</p>

 <p><i>Me</i>. Well, you had better take me back again to life.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. Yes, and get a thrashing from Aeacus for my pains! I like that.</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. Well, don't bother me.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. Let me see what you have got in that wallet.</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. Beans: have some?--and a Hecate's supper.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. Where did you pick up this Cynic, Hermes? The noise he made on the crossing, too! laughing and jeering at all the rest, and singing, when every one else was at his lamentations.</p>  
 <p><i>Her</i>. Ah, Charon, you little know your passenger! Independence, every inch of him: he cares for no one. ’Tis Menippus.</p>  
 <p><i>Ch</i>. Wait till I catch you---</p>  
 <p><i>Me</i>. Precisely; I'll wait--till you catch me again.</p>
