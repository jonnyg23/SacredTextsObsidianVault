 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK VII.</h3>
 <p>    O RHODES, thou art unhappy; for first thee,<br>
 Thee will I mourn; and thou shalt be the first<br>
 Of cities, and first shalt thou be destroyed,<br>
 Bereft of men, but of the means of life<br>
 5 Not wholly destitute. And thou shalt sail,<br>
 Delos, and be unstable on the water;<br>
 Cyprus, a billow of thy gleaming sea<br>
 Shall sometime thee destroy; thee, Sicily,<br>
 The fire that burns within thee shall consume.<br>
     .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 10 Nor heed God's terrible and foreign water.<br>
     .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 Noah sole fugitive from all men came.<br>
     .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 Earth shall float, hills float, and even sky shall float,<br>
 Everything shall be water and all things<br>
 Shall be destroyed by waters. And the winds<br>
 15 Shall stand still and a second age shall be.<br>
     O Phrygia, first shalt thou flame from the crest<br>
 Of the water; and first in impiety<br>
 Thou shalt deny God himself, courting favor<br>
 With false gods, which shall utterly destroy<br>
 20 Thee, wretched one, while many years roll round.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. This book is brief and fragmentary, and mainly of Christian origin. Its composition may be properly assigned to the close of the second or the early part of the third century.</p>
 <p>10-15. Here we have the fragment of a passage referring to Noah and the flood, in which the language is appropriated from book i, 226-240.]</p>
 </font><p align="CENTER">(1-15.)</p>
 <p>{p. 150}</p>
 <p>The hapless Ethiopians under pain,<br>
 Suffering things lamentable, shall by swords<br>
 Be smitten whilst they crouch upon the ground.<br>
     Rich Egypt ever caring for her corn,<br>
 25 Which Nilus by his seven swimming streams<br>
 Intoxicates, shall in intestine strife<br>
 Destroy; and thence men unexpectedly<br>
 Shall drive out Apis, not the god for men.<br>
     Alas, alas, Laodicea! thou<br>
 30 Not ever seeing God shalt lie, bold one;<br>
 And over thee shall dash a wave of Lycus.<br>
     .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 He himself who is born the mighty God,<br>
 Who shall work many signs, shall through heaven hang<br>
 An axle in the midst, and place for men<br>
 35 A mighty terror to be seen on high,<br>
 Measuring a column with a mighty fire<br>
 Whose drops shall slay the races of mankind<br>
 That have dared evils. But a common Lord<br>
 There shall at some time be, and then shall men<br>
 40 Propitiate God, but shall not make an end<br>
 Of fruitless sorrows. And through David's house<br>
 Shall all things come to pass. For God himself<br>
 Gave him the power and put it in his hand;<br>
 Under his feet shall sleep his messengers,<br>
 45 And some shall kindle fires, and some shall make<br>
 Rivers appear, and some shall rescue towns,</p>

 <p>29. <i>Laodicea</i>.--Comp. book iii, 592-595.</p>
 <p>34-36. <i>Axle . . . column</i>.--This idea of a column, axle, or pillar, to be reared on high in connection with the final judgment, is peculiar to the Sibyl. Comp. book ii, 297, 361, and 362.</p>
 <p>38. <i>A common Lord</i>.--The Messiah, common in the same sense that Jude (epistle, verse 3) speaks of the "common salvation."]</p>

 <p>{p. 151}</p>
 <p>And some shall send forth winds. But furthermore<br>
 A grievous life shall come on many men,<br>
 Entering their souls and changing human hearts.<br>
 50 But when a new shoot shall out of a root<br>
 Put forth eyes, the creation, which to all<br>
 Once gave abundant food . . .<br>
     .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 And it shall with the times be full. But when<br>
 Others shall rule, a tribe of warlike Persians,<br>
 55 Bride-chambers straightway shall be terrible<br>
 Because of lawless deeds. For her own son<br>
 Will mother have as husband; son will be<br>
 The ruin of his mother; and with sire<br>
 Shall daughter lie down and shall put to sleep<br>
 60 This foreign law. But to them afterwards<br>
 Shall Roman Ares flash from many a spear;<br>
 And they shall mix much land with human blood.<br>
 But then a chief of Italy shall flee<br>
 From the force of the spear. But they shall leave<br>
 65 Upon the land a lance inscribed with gold,<br>
 Which as the signal ensign of their rule<br>
 The foremost fighters carry constantly.<br>
     And it shall be, when evil and ill-starred<br>
 Ilias shall piteously complete for all<br>
 70 A tomb, not marriage, then shall brides weep sore,</p>

 <p>54. <i>Warlike Persians</i>.--Ewald understands this term as a symbolical name for the incestuous Romans; but it is more probably a designation of the Parthians who in their wars with Crassus and Antony captured many of the Roman standards.</p>
 <p>69. <i>Ilias</i>.--Here apparently put for all the region round about ancient Ilium, or Troy, or perhaps for Perganum in the neighboring province.]</p>

 <p>Because they knew not God, but always gave<br>
 By kettle-drums and cymbals boisterous sound.<br>
     Consult the oracle, O Colophon;<br>
 For a great fearful fire hangs over thee.<br>
 75    Ill-wedded Thessaly, the earth no more<br>
 Shall see thee, nor thy ashes, and alone<br>
 Escaping from the mainland thou shalt swim;<br>
 Thus, O thou wretched one, shalt thou of war<br>
 Be melancholy refuse, having fallen<br>
 80 By swiftly flowing rivers and by swords.<br>
     And thou, O wretched Corinth, shalt receive<br>
 Around thyself stern Ares, hapless one,<br>
 And ye shall perish one upon another.<br>
     Tyre, thou, unhappy, shalt be left alone;<br>
 85 For, made a widow by the feebleness<br>
 Of pious men, thou shalt be brought to naught.<br>
     Ah, Cœle-Syria, of Phœnician men<br>
 The last hold, upon whom the briny sea<br>
 Of Berytus disgorging is poured forth,<br>
 90 O wretched one, thou didst not know thy God,<br>
 Who once in the mouth of Jordan washed himself,<br>
 --And the Spirit spread his wings in flight towards him--<br>
 Who before both the earth and starry heaven<br>
 Was, actual Word, begotten by his Father,<br>
 95 And by the Holy Spirit donning flesh</p>

 <p>He quickly flew unto his Father's house.<br>
 And for him three towers did the mighty heaven<br>
 Establish, in which dwell God's noble guides,<br>
 Hope, piety, and reverence much-desired,<br>
 100 Not having in gold or in silver joy,<br>
 But in the reverential acts of men--<br>
 Both sacrifices and most righteous thoughts.<br>
     And thou shalt sacrifice to the immortal<br>
 And mighty God august, not melting grains<br>
 105 Of frankincense in fire, nor with the sword<br>
 Slaying the shaggy-haired lamb, but with all<br>
 Who bear thy blood take wild fowls, offer prayer,<br>
 And fixing eyes on heaven send them away;<br>
 And thou shalt sprinkle water on pure fire<br>
 110 Having cried: "As the Father did beget<br>
 Thee, the Word, Father, I sent forth a bird,<br>
 Swift messenger of words, with holy waters<br>
 Besprinkling thy baptism, O Word, through which<br>
 Thou didst make thyself manifest in fire."<br>
 115    Thou shalt not shut thy door, when there shall come<br>
 A stranger unto thee in need to curb<br>
 His hunger which comes from his poverty,<br>
 But taking hold of that man sprinkle him<br>
 With water and pray thrice; and to thy God<br>
 120 Do thou thus cry: "I do not long for wealth;</p>

 <p>103-130. This passage contains a series of precepts which are strictly neither Jewish nor Christian. Some of the precepts suggest certain doctrines of the Essenes (comp. Josephus, <i>Ant.</i>, xviii, i, 5); others bear a manifest Christian character, and lines 110-114 contain allusions to the baptism of Jesus, as lines 91 and 92 above.]</p>

 <p>A suppliant I once publicly received<br>
 A suppliant; Father, thou provider, hear."<br>
 When thou hast prayed thou shalt give unto him;<br>
 And the man went away thereafter. . . .<br>

 125 Do not afflict me, holy fear of God<br>
 And righteous, as to birth pure, unenslaved,<br>
 Attested. . . .<br>
 Do thou, O Father, make my wretched heart<br>
 Stand still; to thee have I looked, unto thee,<br>
 130 The undefiled, whom hands did not produce.<br>
     Sardinia, weighty now, thou shalt be changed<br>
 To ashes. Thou shalt be no more an isle,<br>
 When the tenth time shall come. Amid the waves<br>
 Shall sailors seek thee when thou art no more,<br>
 135 And o'er thee shall kingfishers wail sad dirge.<br>
     Rugged Mygdonia, beacon of the sea<br>
 Hard to get out of, ages shalt thou boast<br>
 And unto ages shalt be all destroyed<br>
 With a hot wind, and rave with many woes.<br>
 140    O Celtic land, on mountain range so great,<br>
 Beyond impassable Alp, thee deep sand<br>
 Shall altogether bury; thou shalt give<br>
 Tribute no more, nor corn, nor pasturage;<br>
 And thou from peoples ever far away<br>
 145 Shalt be all-desolate, and becoming thick<br>
 With chill ice thou shalt for an outrage pay,<br>
 Which thou didst not perceive, unholy one.<br>
     Stout-hearted Rome, thou to Olympus shalt<br>
 Flash lightning after Macedonian spears;</p>

 <p>{p. 155}</p>
 <p>150 But God shall make thee utterly unknown,<br>
 When thou wouldst to the eye seem to remain<br>
 Much more firm. Then to thee such things I'll cry.<br>
 Perishing thou shalt then cry out and boil<br>
 In pain; a second time to thee, O Rome,<br>
 15 Again a second time I am to speak.<br>
     And now for thee, O wretched Syria,<br>
 Do I wail bitterly in pitying grief.<br>
     O Thebans ill-advised, an evil sound<br>
 Is over you while flutes speak out their tones;<br>
 160 For you shall trumpet sound an evil sound<br>
 And ye shall see the entire land destroyed<br>
     Alas, alas for thee, thou wretched one;<br>
 Alas, alas thou evil-minded sea!<br>
 Thou shalt be wholly eaten up of fire<br>
 165 And people with thy brine shalt thou destroy.<br>
 For there shall be such raging fire on earth<br>
 As flows like water, and it shall destroy<br>
 The whole land. It shall set the hills on fire,<br>
 Shall burn the rivers, and exhaust the springs.<br>
 170 The world shall be disordered whilst mankind<br>
 Are perishing. And then the wretched ones,<br>
 Burned badly, shall look unto heaven inwrought<br>
 Not with stars, but with fire. Not speedily<br>
 Shall they be made to perish, but dissolved<br>
 175 From under flesh, and burning in the spirit<br>
 For age-long years, they shall know that God's law<br>
 Is always hard to put to test and not<br>
 To be deceived; and then earth, seized by force,<br>
 Daring whatever god she did admit<br>
 180 Unto her altars, cheated, turned to smoke<br>
 Through the changed air; and they shall undergo</p>

 <p>Much suffering who for gain shall prophesy<br>
 Shameful things, nourishing the evil time.<br>
 And the Hebrews who put on the shaggy skins<br>
 185 Of sheep shall prove false, in which race<br>
 Obtained no portion by inheritance,<br>
 But talking mere words over sorrows they<br>
 Are misers, who shall change their course of life<br>
 And not mislead the just, who through the heart<br>
 190 All-faithfully propitiate their God.<br>
     But in the third lot of revolving years,<br>
 Eighth the first, shall another world appear.<br>
 Night shall be all . . . long and without light.<br>
 And then shall pass around the dreadful stench<br>
 195 Of brimstone, messenger of homicides,<br>
 When they shall be by night and hunger slain.<br>
 Then a pure mind shall God beget in men,<br>
 And shall the race establish, as it was<br>
 Aforetime; longer shall not any one<br>
 200 Deep furrow cut with round plow, nor two oxen<br>
 Straight guiding dip the iron down; nor vines<br>
 Shall be nor ears of corn; but all shall eat<br>
 Together dewy manna with white teeth.<br>
 And then among them God shall also be,<br>
 205 And he shall teach them as he has taught me,<br>
 The sad one. For how many evil things<br>
 I did with knowledge once, and many things<br>
 Heedless I also wickedly performed.<br>
 Countless my couches, but no marriage-bond</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[192. <i>Eighth the first</i>.--That is, the eighth being the first of "the third lot." The Sibyl reckons all the years as divided into ten periods or times (line 133 above); of these ten times the eighth is supposed to be the first of the third portion; namely, the eighth, ninth, and tenth, during which shall take place what is written in lines 193-205, immediately following.]</p>

 <p>210 Was cared for; and I, all-unfaithful, brought<br>
 To all a savage oath. I turned away<br>
 Those in need and among the foremost went<br>
 Into like glen and minded not God's word.<br>
 Therefore did fire consume me and shall gnaw;<br>
 215 For I shall not live always, but a time<br>
 Of evil shall destroy me, when for me<br>
 Men shall beside the margin of the sea<br>
 Construct a tomb, and shall slay me with stones;<br>
 For lying with my father a dear son<br>
 220 Did I present him. Smite me, smite me all;<br>
 For thus shall I live and fix eyes on heaven.</p>

Gentes</i>, book i, 62 [L., 5, 802]. Comp. the conclusion of book ii.]</p>
