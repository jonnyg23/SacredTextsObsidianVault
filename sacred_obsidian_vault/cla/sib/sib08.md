 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK VI.</h3>
 <p>    The great Son of the Immortal famed in song<br>
 I from the heart proclaim, to whom a throne,<br>
 To be held fast the most Father gave<br>
 Ere, he was brought forth; then was he raised up<br>
 5 According to flesh given, washed, at the mouth<br>
 Of the river Jordan, which goes rushing on<br>
 Trailing its gleaming billows, from the fire<br>
 Escaping he first shall see God's sweet Spirit<br>
 Descending with the wings of a white dove.<br>
 10 And a pure flower shall bloom, and springs be full.<br>
 And he shall show the ways to men, and show<br>
 The heavenly paths, and teach all with wise<br>
 And he shall come for judgement and persuade<br>
 A disobedient people while he boasts<br>
 15 Descent praiseworthy from a heavenly Sire.<br>
 Billows shall he tread, sickness of mankind<br>
 Shall he destroy, he shall raise up the dead,<br>
 And many sufferings shall he drive away;<br>
 And from one scrip shall be men's fill of bread,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. This book is scarcely entitled to a place among the Sibylline Oracles, or to be called a book. It is a brief hymn in honor of Christ and the cross, and probably of later date than any other portion of the present collection.</p>

 <p>{p. 146}</p>
 <p>20 When the house of David shall bring forth a child;<br>
 And in his hand the whole world, earth, heaven, sea.<br>
 And he shall flash upon the earth, as once<br>
 The two begotten from each other's ribs<br>
 Saw human form appearing. It shall be<br>
 25 When earth shall be glad in the hope of child.<br>
     But for thee only, Sodomitic land,<br>
 Are evil woes laid up; for thou thyself<br>
 Ill-disposed didst not apprehend thy God<br>
 Who mocks at mortal schemes; but from a thorn<br>
 30 Didst crown him with a crown, and fearful gall<br>
 Didst mingle unto insolence and spirit.<br>
 This shall bring evil woes about for thee.<br>
 O the Wood, O so blessed, upon which<br>
 God was outstretched; the earth shall not have thee,<br>
 35 But thou shalt look upon a heavenly house,<br>
 When thou, O God, shalt flash thine eye of fire.</p>
