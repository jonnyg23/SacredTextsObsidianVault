 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Liver</span>, a fabulous bird, supposed to have given its name to Liverpool and commemorated in the arms of that city. It is traditionally described as a bird that frequented <i>the pool</i>, near which the town was afterwards founded. The arms granted in 1797 are thus blazoned: <i>Argent a cormorant, in the beak a branch of seaweed all proper, and for crest, on a wreath of the colours, a cormorant, the wings elevated, in the beak a branch of Laver proper</i>. It is more than probable that the bird on the arms suggested the name "Liver" being applied to it. The fiction naturally arose from the desire to find a derivation for the name of the town. It is, however, always depicted as a cormorant. On the shield the bird is always depicted with the wings <i>close</i>, and on the crest the wings are <i>elevated</i>.</p>
