 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">"Know thyself."</font></span>LIKE the ancient sages the Oriental Philosophers hold the maxim " Know thyself," to be one of vital importance to the Traveller on the Road of Life. A considerable portion therefore of their speculative treatises is invariably devoted to the study of mankind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Religious</font></span>Much difference of opinion exists as to the point of view from which man is to be discussed; the religious teachers asserting that since God created him from nothing he may be considered as an actual being whose characteristics are capable of diagnosis and definition.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">and Metaphysical view of the question.</font></span> The metaphysicians, on the other hand, say that it is impossible for that which is not, to be, or for that which is, not to be; they allow, however, that that which is may assume various forms and manifest itself in different ways, and prefer considering man as a particular manifestation of the one Universal</p>

 <p>existence of God. Both however agree in the propriety of the discussion, though upon different grounds.</p>  
 <p>Man constitutes the Lesser World, and everything <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Man, a world in himself.</font></span> that is not man is included in the Greater World; and since every thing in the Greater World has its counterpart in the Lesser, the study of this is a duty incumbent upon all who aspire to spiritual knowledge. To know oneself is the "right way" (<a name="img_05100"></a>
 <img src="img/05100.jpg">), for guidance in which Mohammed besought God in his prayer, "Guide us into the right way <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">1</font></a>." Self-knowledge is the shortest road to the knowledge of God. When Ali asked Mohammed "What am I to do that I may not waste my time?" the Prophet answered, "Learn to know thyself."</p>
