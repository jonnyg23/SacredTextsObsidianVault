 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">O thou</span> that hast grown from earth, like a rose,<br> Thou too art born of the womb of Self.<br> Do not abandon Self! Persist therein!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1390</font></span> Be a drop of water and drink up the ocean!<br> Glowing with the light of Self as thou art,<br> Make Self strong, and thou wilt endure.</p>

 <p>Thou gettst profit from this trade,<br> Thou gainst riches by preserving this commodity.<br> Thou hast being, and art thou afraid of not-being? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1395</font></span><br> O foolish one, thy understanding is at fault.<br> Since I am acquainted with the harmony of Life,<br> I will tell thee what is the secret of Life<br> To sink into thyself like the pearl,<br> Then to emerge from thine inward solitude; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1400</font></span><br> To collect sparks beneath the ashes,<br> And become a flame and dazzle men's eyes.<br> Go, burn the house of forty years tribulation,<br> Move round thyself! Be a circling flame!<br> What is Life but to be freed from moving round others <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1405</font></span></p>

 <p>And to regard thyself as the Holy Temple?<br> Beat thy wings and escape from the attraction of Earth;<br> Like birds, be safe from falling.<br> Unless thou art a bird, thou wilt do wisely<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1410</font></span> Not to build thy nest on the top of a cave.<br> O thou that seekest to acquire knowledge,<br> I say oer to thee the message of the Sage of Rúm: <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> "Knowledge, if it lie on thy skin, is a snake;<br> Knowledge, if thou take it to heart, is a friend."<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1415</font></span> Hast thou heard how the Master of Rúm<br> Gave lectures on philosophy at Aleppo?<br> Fast in the bonds of intellectual proofs,</p>

 <p>Drifting oer the dark and stormy sea of understanding;<br> A Moses unillumined by Love's Sinai,<br> Ignorant of Love and of Love's passion. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1420</font></span><br> He discoursed on Scepticism and Neoplatonism,<br> And strung many a brilliant pearl of metaphysic.<br> He unravelled the problems of the Peripatetics,<br> The light of his thought made clear whatever was obscure.<br> Heaps of books lay around and in front of him, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1425</font></span><br> And on his lips was the key to all their mysteries.<br> Shams-i Tabríz, directed by Kamál, <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Sought his way to the college of Jaláluddín Rúmí<br> And cried out, "What is all this noise and babble?</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1430</font></span> What are all these syllogisms and judgements and demonstrations?"<br> "Peace, O fool!" exclaimed the Maulavi,<br> "Do not laugh at the doctrines of the sages.<br> Get thee out of my college!<br> This is argument and discussion: what hast thou to do with it?<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1435</font></span> My discourse is beyond thy understanding,<br> It will not brighten the glass of thy perception."<br> These words increased the anger of Shams-i Tabríz<br> And caused a fire to burst forth from his soul.<br> The lightning of his look fell on the earth,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1440</font></span> And the glow of his breath made the dust spring into flames.<br> The spiritual fire burned the intellectual stack</p>  
 <p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a></p>  
 <p>And clean consumed the book of philosophy.<br> The Maulavi, being a stranger to Love's miracles<br> And unversed in Love's harmonies,<br> Cried, "How didst thou kindle this fire, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1445</font></span><br> Which hath burned the books of the philosophers?"<br> The Sheikh answered, "O unbelieving Moslem,<br> This is vision and ecstasy: what hast thou to do with it?<br> My state is beyond thy thought,<br> My flame is the Alchemist's elixir." <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1450</font></span><br> Thou hast drawn thy substance from the snow of philosophy,<br> The cloud of thy thought sheds nothing but hailstones.<br> Kindle a fire in thy rubble,<br> Foster a flame in thy earth!<br> The Moslem's knowledge is perfected by spiritual fervour, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1455</font></span></p>

 <p>The meaning of Islam is <i>Renounce what shall pass away</i>.<br> When Abraham escaped from the bondage of "that which sets," <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> He sat unhurt in the midst of flames. <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Thou hast cast knowledge of God behind thee<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1460</font></span> And squandered thy religion for the sake of a loaf.<br> Thou art hot in pursuit of antimony,<br> Thou art unaware of the blackness of thine own eye.<br> Seek the Fountain of Life from the sword's edge,<br> And the River of Paradise from the dragon's mouth,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1465</font></span> Demand the Black Stone from the door of the house of idols,<br> And the musk-deer's bladder from a mad dog,</p>

 <p>But do not seek the glow of Love from the knowledge of to-day,<br> Do not seek the nature of Truth from this infidel's cup!<br> Long have I been running to and fro,<br> Learning the secrets of the New Knowledge: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1470</font></span><br> Its gardeners have put me to the trial<br> And have made me intimate with their roses.<br> Roses! Tulips, rather, that warn one not to smell them<br> Like paper roses, a mirage of perfume.<br> Since this garden ceased to enthral me, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1475</font></span><br> I have nested on the Paradisal tree.<br> Modern knowledge is the greatest blind<br> Idol-worshipping, idol-selling, idol-making!<br> Shackled in the prison of phenomena,<br> It has not overleaped the limits of the sensible. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1480</font></span></p>  
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>  
 <p>It has fallen down in crossing the bridge of Life,<br> It has laid the knife to its own throat.<br> Having fire, it is yet cold as the tulip;<br> Having flame, it is yet cold as hail.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1485</font></span> Its nature remains untouched by the glow of Love,<br> It is ever engaged in a joyless search.<br> Love is the Plato that heals the sicknesses of the mind: <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The mind's melancholy is cured by its lancet.<br> The whole world bows in adoration to Love,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1490</font></span> Love is the Mahmúd that conquers the Somnath of intellect. <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Modern science lacks this old wine in its cup,<br> Its nights are not loud with passionate prayer.</p>

 <p>Thou hast misprized thine own cypress<br> And deemed tall the cypress of others.<br> Like the reed, thou hast emptied thyself of Self <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1495</font></span><br> And given thine heart to the music of others.<br> O thou that beggst morsels from another's table,<br> Wilt thou seek thine own kind in another's shop?<br> The Moslem's feast is burned up by the lamps of strangers,<br> His mosque is consumed by the Christian monastery. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1500</font></span><br> When the deer fled from the sacred territory of Mecca,<br> The hunter's arrow pierced her side. <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The leaves of the rose are scattered, like its scent:<br> O thou that hast fled from thy Self, come back to it!</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1505</font></span> O trustee of the wisdom of the Koran,<br> Find thy lost unity again!<br> We, who keep the gate of the citadel of Islam,<br> Have become unbelievers by neglecting<br> the watchword of Islam.<br> The ancient Saki's bowl is shattered,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1510</font></span> The wine-party of the Hijáz is broken up.<br> The Kaba is filled with our idols,<br> Infidelity mocks at our Islam.<br> Our Sheikh hath gambled Islam away for love of idols<br> And made a rosary of the <i>zunnár</i>. <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1515</font></span> Our spiritual directors owe their rank to their white hairs<br> And are the laughing-stock of children in the street;<br> Their hearts bear no impress of the Faith<br> But house the idols of sensuality.</p>

 <p>Every long-haired fellow wears the garb of a dervish<br> Alas for these traffickers in religion! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1520</font></span><br> Day and night they are travelling about with disciples,<br> And ignoring their religious duties.<br> Their eyes are without light, like the narcissus,<br> Their breasts devoid of spiritual wealth.<br> Preachers and Stiffs, all worship worldliness alike; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1525</font></span><br> The prestige of the pure religion is ruined.<br> Our preacher fixed his eyes on the pagoda<br> And the mufti of the Faith sold his decision.<br> After this, O friends, what are we to do?<br> Our guide turns his face towards the wine-house. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1530</font></span></p>
