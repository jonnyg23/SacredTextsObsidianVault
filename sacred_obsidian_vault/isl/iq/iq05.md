 <p align="center"><i>Showing that the life of the Self comes from forming desires and bringing them to birth</i>.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Life</span> is preserved by purpose:<br> Because of the goal its caravan-bell tinkles.<br> Life is latent in seeking,<br> Its origin is hidden in desire. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">270</font></span><br> Keep desire alive in thy heart,<br> Lest thy little dust become a tomb.<br> Desire is the soul of this world of hue and scent,<br> The nature of every thing is faithful to desire.<br> Desire sets the heart dancing in the breast, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">275</font></span></p>

 <p>And by its glow the breast is made bright as a mirror.<br> It gives to earth the power of soaring,<br> It is a Khizr to the Moses of perception. <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> From the flame of desire the heart takes life,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">280</font></span> And when it takes life, all dies that is not true.<br> When it refrains from forming wishes,<br> Its pinion breaks and it cannot soar.<br> Desire is an emotion of the Self:<br> It is a restless wave of the Self's sea.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">285</font></span> Desire is a noose for hunting ideals,<br> A binder of the book of deeds.<br> Negation of desire is death to the living,<br> Even as absence of burning extinguishes the flame.<br> What is the source of our wakeful eye?<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">290</font></span> Our delight in seeing hath taken visible shape.</p>

 <p>The partridge's leg is derived from the elegance of its gait,<br> The nightingale's beak from its endeavour to sing.<br> Away from the reed-bed, the reed became happy:<br> The music was released from its prison. <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Why does the mind strive after new discoveries and scale the heavens? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">295</font></span><br> Knowest thou what works this miracle?<br> Tis desire that enriches Life,<br> And the intellect is a child of its womb.<br> What are social organisation, customs, and laws?<br> What is the secret of the novelties of <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">300</font></span> science?<br> A desire which broke through by its own strength<br> And burst forth from the heart and took shape.</p>

 <p>Nose, hand, brain, eye, and ear,<br> Thought, imagination, feeling, memory, and understanding<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">305</font></span> All these are weapons devised for self-preservation<br> By him that rides into the battle of Life.<br> The object of science and art is not knowledge,<br> The object of the garden is not the bud and the flower.<br> Science is an instrument for the preservation of Life,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">310</font></span> Science is a means of establishing the Self.<br> Science and art are servants of Life,<br> Slaves born and bred in its house.<br> Rise, O thou who art strange to Life's mystery,<br> Rise intoxicated with the wine of an ideal!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">315</font></span> If thou art an ideal, thou wilt shine as the dawn</p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>And be to all else as a blazing fire.<br> If thou art an ideal, thou art higher than Heaven<br> Winning, captivating, enchanting men's hearts;<br> A destroyer of ancient falsehood,<br> Fraught with turmoil, an embodiment of the Last Day. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">320</font></span><br> We live by forming ideals,<br> We glow with the sunbeams of desire!</p>
