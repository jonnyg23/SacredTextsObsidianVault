 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">When</span> the world-illuming sun rushed<br> upon Night like a brigand,<br> My weeping bedewed the face of the rose.<br> My tears washed away sleep from the eye of the narcissus,<br> My passion wakened the grass and made it grow.<br> The Gardener taught me to sing with power, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">5</font></span><br> He sowed a verse and reaped a sword.<br> In the soil he planted only the seed of my tears<br> And wove my lament with the garden, as warp and woof.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 2</font></a></p>  
 <p>Tho I am but a mote, the radiant sun is mine:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">10</font></span> Within my bosom are a hundred dawns.<br> My dust is brighter than Jamshíd's cup, <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> It knows things that are yet unborn in the world.<br> My thought hunted down and slung from the saddle a deer<br> That has not yet leaped forth from the covert of non-existence.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">15</font></span> Fair is my garden ere yet the leaves are green:<br> Full-blown roses are hidden in the skirt of my garment.<br> I struck dumb the musicians where they were gathered together,<br> I smote the heartstrings of all that heard me,<br> Because the lute of my genius hath a rare melody:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">20</font></span> Even to comrades my song is strange.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a></p>  
 <p>I am born in the world as a new sun,<br> I have not learned the ways and fashions of the sky:<br> Not yet have the stars fled before my splendour,<br> Not yet is my quicksilver astir;<br> Untouched is the sea by my dancing rays, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">25</font></span><br> Untouched are the mountains by my crimson hue.<br> The eye of existence is not familiar with me;<br> I rise trembling, afraid to show myself.<br> From the East my dawn arrived and routed Night,<br> A fresh dew settled on the rose of the world. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">30</font></span><br> I am waiting for the votaries that rise at dawn:<br> Oh, happy they who shall worship my fire!<br> I have no need of the ear of To-day,<br> I am the voice of the poet of To-morrow.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">35</font></span> My own age does not understand my deep meanings,<br> My Joseph is not for this market.<br> I despair of my old companions,<br> My Sinai burns for sake of the Moses who is coming.<br> Their sea is silent, like dew,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">40</font></span> But my dew is storm-ridden, like the ocean.<br> My song is of another world than theirs:<br> This bell calls other travellers to take the road.<br> How many a poet after his death<br> Opened our eyes when his own were closed,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">45</font></span> And journeyed forth again from nothingness<br> When roses blossomed oer the earth of his grave!<br> Albeit caravans have passed through this desert,<br> They passed, as a camel steps, with little sound.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p>But I am a lover: loud crying is my faith:<br> The clamour of Judgement Day is one of my minions. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">50</font></span><br> My song exceeds the range of the chord,<br> Yet I do not fear that my lute will break.<br> Twere better for the waterdrop not to know my torrent,<br> Whose fury should rather madden the sea.<br> No river will contain my Omán: <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">1</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">55</font></span><br> My flood requires whole seas to hold it.<br> Unless the bud expand into a bed of roses,<br> It is unworthy of my spring-cloud's bounty.<br> Lightnings slumber within my soul,<br> I sweep over mountain and plain. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">60</font></span><br> Wrestle with my sea, if thou art a plain;</p>

 <p>Receive my lightning, if thou art a Sinai.<br> The Fountain of Life hath been given me to drink,<br> I have been made an adept of the mystery of Life.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">65</font></span> The speck of dust was vitalised by my burning song:<br> It unfolded wings and became a firefly.<br> No one hath told the secret which I will tell<br> Or threaded a pearl of thought like mine.<br> Come, if thou wouldst know the secret of everlasting life!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">70</font></span> Come, if thou wouldst win both earth and heaven!<br> The old Guru of the Sky taught me this lore,<br> I cannot hide it from my comrades.<br> O Saki! arise and pour wine into the cup,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>Clear the vexation of Time from my heart!<br> The sparkling liquor that flows from Zemzem <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">1</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">75</font></span><br> Were it a beggar, a king would pay homage to it.<br> It makes thought more sober and wise,<br> It makes the keen eye keener,<br> It gives to a straw the weight of a mountain,<br> And to foxes the strength of lions. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">80</font></span><br> It causes dust to soar to the Pleiades<br> And a drop of water swell to the breadth of the sea.<br> It turns silence into the din of Judgement Day,<br> It makes the foot of the partridge red with blood of the hawk.<br> Arise and pour pure wine into my cup, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">85</font></span><br> Pour moonbeams into the dark night of my thought,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p>That I may lead home the wanderer<br> And imbue the idle looker-on with restless impatience;<br> And advance hotly on a new quest<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">90</font></span> And become known as the champion of a new spirit;<br> And be to people of insight as the pupil to the eye,<br> And sink into the ear of the world, like a voice;<br> And exalt the worth of Poesy<br> And sprinkle the dry herbs with my tears.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">95</font></span> Inspired by the genius of the Master of Rúm, <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> I rehearse the sealed book of secret lore.<br> His soul is the source of the flames,<br> I am but as the spark that gleams for a moment.</p>

 <p>His burning candle consumed me, the moth;<br> His wine overwhelmed my goblet. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">100</font></span><br> The Master of Rúm transmuted my earth to gold<br> And clothed my barren dust with beauty.<br> The grain of sand set forth from the  desert,<br> That it might win the radiance of the sun.<br> I am a wave and I will come to rest in his sea, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">105</font></span><br> That I may make the glistening pearl mine own.<br> I who am drunken with the wine of his song<br> Will draw life from the breath of his words.</p>  
 <p>Twas night: my heart would fain lament,<br> The. silence was filled with my cries to God. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">110</font></span></p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>I was complaining of the sorrows of the world<br> And bewailing the emptiness of my cup.<br> At last mine eye could endure no more,<br> Broken with fatigue it went to sleep.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">115</font></span> There appeared the Master, formed in the mould of Truth,<br> Who wrote the Koran of Persia. <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> He said, "O frenzied lover,<br> Take a draught of love's pure wine.<br> Strike the chords of thine heart and rouse a tumultuous strain,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">120</font></span> Dash thine head against the cupping-glass and thine eye against the lancet!<br> Make thy laughter the source of a hundred sighs,<br> Make the hearts of men bleed with thy tears!<br> How long wilt thou be silent, like a bud?<br> Sell thy fragrance cheap, like the rose!</p>  
 <p>

 <p>Tongue-tied, thou art in pain: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">125</font></span><br> Cast thyself upon the fire, like rue! <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Like the bell, break silence at last, and from every limb<br> Utter forth a lamentation!<br> Thou art fire: fill the world with thy glow!<br> Make others burn with thy burning! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">130</font></span><br> Proclaim the secrets of the old wine-seller; <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Be thou a surge of wine, and the crystal cup thy robe!<br> Shatter the mirror of fear,<br> Break the bottles in the bazaar!<br> Like the reed-flute, bring a message from the reeds; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">135</font></span><br> Give to Majnún a message from Lailá! <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Create a new style for thy song,<br> Enrich the feast with thy piercing strains!</p>

 <p>Up, and re-inspire every living soul!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">140</font></span> Say 'Arise!' and by that word quicken the living!<br> Up, and set thy feet on another path;<br> Put aside the passionate melancholy of old!<br> Become familiar with the delight of singing;<br> O bell of the caravan, awake!"</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">145</font></span> At these words my bosom was enkindled<br> And swelled with emotion like the flute;<br> I rose like music from the string<br> To prepare a Paradise for the ear.<br> I unveiled the mystery of the. Self<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">150</font></span> And disclosed its wondrous secret.</p>  
 <p>My being was as an unfinished statue,<br> Uncomely, worthless, good for nothing.<br> Love chiselled me: I became a man<br> And gained knowledge of the nature of the universe.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>I have seen the movement of the sinews of the sky, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">155</font></span><br> And the blood coursing in the veins of the moon.<br> Many a night I wept for Man's sake<br> That I might tear the veil from Life's mysteries,<br> And extract the secret of Life's constitution<br> From the laboratory of phenomena. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">160</font></span><br> I who give beauty to this night, like the moon,<br> Am as dust in devotion to the pure Faith (Islam)<br> A Faith renowned in hill and dale,<br> Which kindles in men's hearts a flame of undying song:<br> It sowed an atom and reaped a sun, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">165</font></span><br> It harvested a hundred poets like Rúmí and Attar.<br> I am a sigh: I will mount to the heavens;<br> I am a breath, yet am I sprung of fire.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>Driven onward by high thoughts, my pen<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">170</font></span> Cast abroad the secret of this veil,<br> That the drop may become co-equal with the sea<br> And the grain of sand grow into a Sahara.<br> Poetising is not the aim of this <i>masnaví</i>,<br> Beauty-worshipping and love-making is not its aim.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">175</font></span> I am of India: Persian is not my native tongue;<br> I am like the crescent moon: my cup is not full.<br> Do not seek from me charm of style in exposition,<br> Do not seek from me Khánsár and Isfahan. <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Although the language of Hind is sweet as sugar,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">180</font></span> Yet sweeter is the fashion of Persian speech.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>My mind was enchanted by its loveliness,<br> My pen became as a twig of the Burning Bush.<br> Because of the loftiness of my thoughts,<br> Persian alone is suitable to them.<br> O Reader, do not find fault with the wine-cup, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">185</font></span><br> But consider attentively the taste of the wine.</p>
