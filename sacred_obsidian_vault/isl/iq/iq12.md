 <p align="center"><i>Showing that the education of the Self has three stages: Obedience, Self-control, and Divine Vicegerency</i>.</p>  <h4 align="center">1. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Obedience</span></h4>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">815</font></span> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Service</span> and toil are traits of the camel,<br> Patience and perseverance are ways of the camel.<br> Noiselessly he steps along the sandy track,<br> He is the ship of those who voyage in the desert.<br> Every thicket knows the print of his foot:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">820</font></span> He eats seldom, sleeps little, and is inured to toil.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>  
 <p>He carries rider, baggage, and litter;<br> He trots on and on to the journey's end,<br> Rejoicing in his speed,<br> More patient in travel than his rider.<br> Thou, too, do not refuse the burden of Duty: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">825</font></span><br> So wilt thou enjoy the best dwelling-place, which is with God.<br> Endeavour to obey, O heedless one!<br> Liberty is the fruit of compulsion.<br> By obedience the man of no worth is made worthy;<br> By disobedience his fire is turned to ashes. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">830</font></span><br> Whoso would master the sun and stars,<br> Let him make himself a prisoner of Law!<br> The wind is enthralled by the fragrant rose;<br> The perfume is confined in the navel of the musk-deer.<br> The star moves towards its goal <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">835</font></span><br> With head bowed in surrender to a law.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>The grass springs up in obedience to the law of growth:<br> When it abandons that, it is trodden underfoot.<br> To burn unceasingly is the law of the tulip,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">840</font></span> And so the blood leaps in its veins.<br> Drops of water become a sea by the law of union,<br> And grains of sand become a Sahara.<br> Since Law makes everything strong within,<br> Why dost thou neglect this source of strength?<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">845</font></span> O thou that art emancipated from the old Custom, <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Adorn thy feet once more with the same fine silver chain!<br> Do not complain of the hardness of the Law,<br> Do not transgress the statutes of Mohammed!</p>

 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">2. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Self-control</span></h4>  
 <p>Thy soul cares only for itself, like the camel:<br> It is self-conceited, self-governed, and self-willed. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">850</font></span><br> Be a man, get its halter into thine hand,<br> That thou mayst become a pearl albeit thou art a potter's vessel.<br> He that does not command himself<br> Becomes a receiver of commands from others.<br> When they moulded thee of clay, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">855</font></span><br> Love and fear were mingled in thy making:<br> Fear of this world and of the world to come, fear of death,<br> Fear of all the pains of earth and heaven;<br> Love of riches and power, love of country,<br> Love of self and kindred and wife. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">860</font></span></p>  
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a></p>  
 <p>The mixing of clay with water nourishes the body, <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> But he that is drowned in sin dies an evil death.<br> So long as thou holdst the staff of "There is no God but He," <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Thou wilt break every spell of fear.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">865</font></span> One to whom God is as the soul in his body,<br> His neck is not bowed before vanity.<br> Fear finds no way into his bosom,<br> His heart is afraid of none but Allah.<br> Whoso dwells in the Moslem Faith<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">870</font></span> Is free from the bonds of wife and child.<br> He withdraws his gaze from all except God<br> And lays the knife to the throat of his son. <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>Though single, he is like a host in onset:<br> Life is cheaper in his eyes than wind.<br> The profession of Faith is the shell, but<br> prayer is the pearl: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">875</font></span><br> The Moslem's heart deems prayer a lesser pilgrimage. <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> In the Moslem's hand prayer is like a dagger<br> Killing sin and frowardness and wrong.<br> Fasting makes an assault upon hunger and thirst<br> And breaches the citadel of sensuality. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">880</font></span><br> The pilgrimage enlightens the minds of the Faithful:<br> It teaches separation from one's home and destroys attachment to one's native land;<br> It is an act of devotion in which all feel themselves to be one,<br> It binds together the leaves of the book of religion.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">885</font></span> Almsgiving causes love of riches to pass away<br> And makes equality familiar;<br> It fortifies the heart with righteousness, <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> It increases wealth and diminishes fondness for wealth.<br> All this is a means of strengthening thee:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">890</font></span> Thou art impregnable, if thy Islam be strong.<br> Draw might from the litany "O Almighty One!"<br> That thou mayst ride the camel of thy body. <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">3. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Divine Vicegerency</span> <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">3</font></a></h4>

 <p>And wear on thine head the crown of Solomon.<br> Thou wilt be the glory of the world whilst the world lasts, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">895</font></span><br> And thou wilt reign in the kingdom incorruptible.<br> Tis sweet to be God's vicegerent in the world<br> And exercise sway over the elements.<br> God's vicegerent is as the soul of the universe,<br> His being is the shadow of the Greatest Name. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">900</font></span><br> He knows the mysteries of part and whole,<br> He executes the command of Allah in the world.<br> When he pitches his tent in the wide world,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>He rolls up this ancient carpet. <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">905</font></span> His genius abounds with life and desires to manifest itself:<br> He will bring another world into existence.<br> A hundred worlds like this world of parts and wholes<br> Spring up, like roses, from the seed of his imagination.<br> He makes every raw nature ripe,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">910</font></span> He puts the idols out of the sanctuary.<br> Heart-strings give forth music at his touch,<br> He wakes and sleeps for God alone.<br> He teaches age the melody of youth<br> And endows everything with the radiance of youth.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">915</font></span> To the human race he brings both a glad message and a warning,<br> He comes both as a soldier and as a marshal and prince.</p>

 <p>He is the final cause of "God taught Adam the names of all things," <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> He is the inmost sense of "Glory to Him that transported His servant by night." <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> His white hand is strengthened by the staff, <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> His knowledge is twinned with the power of a perfect man. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">920</font></span><br> When that bold cavalier seizes the reins,<br> The steed of Time gallops faster.<br> His awful mien makes the Red Sea dry,<br> He leads Israel out of Egypt.<br> At his cry, "Arise," the dead spirits <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">925</font></span><br> Rise in their bodily tomb, like pines in the field.<br> His person is an atonement for all the world,</p>

 <p>By his grandeur the world is saved. <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> His protecting shadow makes the mote familiar with the sun,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">930</font></span> His rich substance makes precious all that exists.<br> He bestows life by miraculous works,<br> He founds a new system to work by.<br> Splendid visions rise from the print of his foot,<br> Many a Moses is entranced by his Sinai.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">935</font></span> He gives a new explanation of Life,<br> A new interpretation of this dream.<br> His hidden being is Life's mystery,<br> The unheard music of Life's harp.<br> Nature travails in blood for generations<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">940</font></span> To compose the harmony of his personality.<br> When our handful of earth has reached the zenith,</p>

 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p>That champion will come forth from this dust!<br> There sleeps amidst the ashes of To-day<br> The flame of a world-consuming morrow.<br> Our bud enfolds a garden of roses, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">945</font></span><br> Our eyes are bright with to-morrow's dawn.<br> Appear, O rider of Destiny!<br> Appear, O light of the dark realm of Change!<br> Illumine the scene of existence,<br> Dwell in the blackness of our eyes! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">950</font></span><br> Silence the noise of the nations,<br> Imparadise our ears with thy music!<br> Arise and tune the harp of brotherhood,<br> Give us back the cup of the wine of love!<br> Bring once more days of peace to the world, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">955</font></span><br> Give a message of peace to them that seek battle!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p>Mankind are the cornfield and thou the harvest,<br> Thou art the goal of Life's caravan.<br> The leaves are scattered by Autumn's fury:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">960</font></span> Oh, do thou pass over our gardens as the Spring!<br> Receive from our downcast brows<br> The homage of little children and of young men and old!<br> When thou art there, we will lift up our heads,<br> Content to suffer the burning fire of this world.</p>
