 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> luminous point whose name is the Self<br> Is the life-spark beneath our dust.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">325</font></span> By Love it is made more lasting,<br> More living, more burning, more glowing.<br> From Love proceeds the radiance of its being<br> And the development of its unknown possibilities.<br> Its nature gathers fire from Love,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">330</font></span> Love instructs it to illumine the world.</p>

 <p>Love fears neither sword nor dagger,<br> Love is not born of water and air and earth.<br> Love makes peace and war in the world,<br> The Fountain of Life is Love's flashing sword.<br> The hardest rocks are shivered by Love's glance: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">335</font></span><br> Love of God at last becomes wholly God.<br> Learn thou to love, and seek to be loved:<br> Seek an eye like Noah's, a heart like Job's!<br> Transmute thy handful of earth into gold,<br> Kiss the threshold of a Perfect Man! <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">340</font></span><br> Like Rúmí, light thy candle<br> And burn Rúm in the fire of Tabríz! <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>There is a beloved hidden within thine heart:<br> I will show him to thee, if thou hast eyes to see.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">345</font></span> His lovers are fairer than the fair,<br> Sweeter and comelier and more beloved.<br> By love of him the heart is made strong<br> And earth rubs shoulders with the Pleiades.<br> The soil of Najd was quickened by his grace<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">350</font></span> And fell into a rapture and rose to the skies. <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> In the Moslem's heart is the home of Mohammed,<br> All our glory is from the name of Mohammed.<br> Sinai is but an eddy of the dust of his house,<br> The sanctuary of the Kaba is his dwelling-place.</p>

 <p>Eternity is less than a moment of his time, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">355</font></span><br> Eternity receives increase from his essence.<br> He slept on a mat of rushes,<br> But the crown of Chosroes was under his people's feet.<br> He chose the nightly solitude of Mount Hirá,<br> And he founded a state and laws and government. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">360</font></span><br> He passed many a night with sleepless eyes<br> In order that the Moslems might sleep on the throne of Persia.<br> In the hour of battle, iron was melted by his sword;<br> In the hour of prayer, tears fell like rain from his eye.<br> When he was called to aid, his sword answered "Amen" <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">365</font></span><br> And extirpated the race of kings.<br> He instituted new laws in the world,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>He brought the empires of antiquity to an end.<br> With the key of religion he opened the door of this world:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">370</font></span> The womb of the world never bore his like.<br> In his sight high and low were one,<br> He sat with his slave at one table.<br> The daughter of the chieftain of Tai<br> was taken prisoner in battle <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And brought into that exalted presence;<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">375</font></span> Her feet in chains, unveiled,<br> And her neck bowed with shame.<br> When the Prophet saw that the poor girl had no veil,<br> He covered her face with his own veil.<br> We are more naked than that lady of Tai,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">380</font></span> We are unveiled before the nations of the world.</p>

 <p>In him is our trust on the Day of Judgement,<br> And in this world too he is our protector.<br> Both his favour and his wrath are entirely a mercy:<br> That is a mercy to his friends and this to his foes.<br> He opened the gates of mercy to his enemies, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">385</font></span><br> He gave to Mecca the message, "No blame shall be laid upon you."<br> We who know not the bonds of country<br> Resemble sight, which is one though it be the light of two eyes.<br> We belong to the Hijáz and China and Persia,<br> Yet we are the dew of one smiling dawn. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">390</font></span><br> We are all under the spell of the eye of the cupbearer from Mecca,<br> We are united as wine and cup.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>He burnt clean away distinctions of lineage,<br> His fire consumed this trash and rubble.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">395</font></span> We are like a rose with many petals but with one perfume:<br> He is the soul of this society, and he is one.<br> We were the secret concealed in his heart:<br> He spake out fearlessly, and we were revealed.<br> The song of love for him fills my silent reed,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">400</font></span> A hundred notes throb in my bosom.<br> How shall I tell what devotion he inspires?<br> A block of dry wood wept at parting from him. <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The Moslem's being is where he manifests his glory:<br> Many a Sinai springs from the dust on his path.</p>

 <p>My image was created by his mirror, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">405</font></span><br> My dawn rises from the sun of his breast.<br> My repose is a perpetual fever,<br> My evening hotter than the morning of Judgement Day: <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> He is the April cloud and I his garden,<br> My vine is bedewed with his rain. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">410</font></span><br> I sowed mine eye in the field of Love<br> And reaped a harvest of delight.<br> "The soil of Medina is sweeter than both worlds:<br> Oh, happy the town where dwells the Beloved!" <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> I am lost in admiration of the style of Mullá Jámí: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">415</font></span><br> His verse and prose are a remedy for my immaturity.<br> He has written poetry overflowing with beautiful ideas</p>

 <p>And has threaded pearls in praise of the Master<br> "Mohammed is the preface to the book of the universe:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">420</font></span> All the world are slaves and he is the Master."<br> From the wine of Love spring many qualities:<br> Amongst the attributes of Love is blind devotion.<br> The saint of Bistám, who in devotion was unique,<br> Abstained from eating a water-melon. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">425</font></span> Be a lover constant in devotion to thy beloved,<br> That thou mayst cast thy noose and capture God.<br> Sojourn for a while on the Hirá of the heart, <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>Abandon self and flee to God.<br> Strengthened by God, return to thy self<br> And break the heads of the Lát and Uzzá of sensuality. <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">1</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">430</font></span><br> By the might of Love evoke an army,<br> Reveal thyself on the Fárán of Love, <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> That the Lord of the Kaba may show thee favour<br> And interpret to thee the text, "Lo, I will appoint a vicegerent on the earth." <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
