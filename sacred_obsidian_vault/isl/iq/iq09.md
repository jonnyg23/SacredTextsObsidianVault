 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hast</span> thou heard that in the time of old<br> The sheep dwelling in a certain pasture<br> So increased and multiplied<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">540</font></span> That they feared no enemy?<br> At last, from the malice of Fate,<br> Their breasts were smitten by a shaft of calamity.<br> The tigers sprang forth from the jungle<br> And rushed upon the sheepfold.</p>

 <p>Conquest and dominion are signs of strength, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">545</font></span><br> Victory is the manifestation of strength.<br> Those fierce tigers beat the drum of sovereignty,<br> They deprived the sheep of freedom.<br> Forasmuch as tigers must have their prey,<br> That meadow was crimsoned with the blood of the sheep. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">550</font></span><br> One of the sheep which was clever and acute,<br> Old in years, cunning as a weather-beaten wolf,<br> Being grieved at the fate of his fellows<br> And sorely vexed by the violence of the tigers,<br> Made complaint of the course of Destiny <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">555</font></span><br> And sought by craft to restore his fortunes.<br> The weak man, in order to preserve himself,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>Seeks devices from skilled intelligence.<br> In slavery, for the sake of repelling harm,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">560</font></span> The power of scheming becomes quickened,<br> And when the madness of revenge gains hold,<br> The mind of the slave meditates rebellion.<br> "Ours is a hard knot," said this sheep to himself,<br> "The ocean of our griefs hath no shore.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">565</font></span> By force we sheep cannot escape from the tiger:<br> Our legs are silver, his paws are steel.<br> Tis not possible, however much one exhorts and counsels,<br> To create in a sheep the disposition of a wolf.<br> But to make the furious tiger a sheepthat is possible;<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">570</font></span> To make him unmindful of his naturethat is possible."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>He became as a prophet inspired,<br> And began to preach to the blood-thirsty tigers.<br> He cried out, "O ye insolent liars,<br> Who wot not of a day of ill luck that shall continue for ever! <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> I am possessed of spiritual power, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">575</font></span><br> I am an apostle sent by God for the tigers.<br> I come as a light for the eye that is dark,<br> I come to establish laws and give commandments.<br> Repent of your blameworthy deeds!<br> O plotters of evil, bethink yourselves of good! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">580</font></span><br> Whoso is violent and strong is miserable:<br> Life's solidity depends on self-denial.<br> The spirit of the righteous is fed by fodder:<br> The vegetarian is pleasing unto God.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">585</font></span> The sharpness of your teeth brings disgrace upon you<br> And makes the eye of your perception blind.<br> Paradise is for the weak alone,<br> Strength is but a means to perdition.<br> It is wicked to seek greatness and glory,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">590</font></span> Penury is sweeter than princedom.<br> Lightning does not threaten the corn-seed:<br> If the seed become a stack, it is unwise.<br> If you are sensible, you will be a mote of sand, not a Sahara,<br> So that you may enjoy the sunbeams.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">595</font></span> O thou that delightest in the slaughter of sheep,<br> Slay thy self, and thou wilt have honour!<br> Life is rendered unstable<br> By violence, oppression, revenge, and exercise of power.</p>

 <p>Though trodden underfoot, the grass grows up time after time<br> And washes the sleep of death from its eye again and again. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">600</font></span><br> Forget thy self, if thou art wise!<br> If thou dost not forget thy self, thou art mad.<br> Close thine eyes, close thine ears, close thy lips, <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> That thy thought may reach the lofty sky!<br> This pasturage of the world is naught, naught: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">605</font></span><br> O fool, do not torment thyself for a phantom!"<br> The tiger-tribe was exhausted by hard struggles,<br> They had set their hearts on enjoyment of luxury.<br> This soporific advice pleased them,<br> In their stupidity they swallowed the charm of the sheep. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">610</font></span></p>

 <p>He that used to make sheep his prey<br> Now embraced a sheep's religion.<br> 'flee tigers took kindly to a diet of fodder:<br> At length their tigerish nature was broken.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">615</font></span> The fodder blunted their teeth<br> And put out the awful flashings of their eyes.<br> By degrees courage ebbed from their breasts,<br> The sheen departed from the mirror.<br> That frenzy of uttermost exertion remained not,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">620</font></span> That craving after action dwelt in their hearts no more.<br> They lost the power of ruling and the resolution to be independent,<br> They lost reputation, prestige, and fortune.<br> Their paws that were as iron became strengthless;</p>

 <p>Their souls died and their bodies became tombs.<br> Bodily strength diminished while spiritual fear increased: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">625</font></span><br> Spiritual fear robbed them of courage.<br> Lack of courage produced a hundred diseases<br> Poverty, pusillanimity, lowmindedness.<br> The wakeful tiger was lulled to slumber by the sheep's charm:<br> He called his decline Moral Culture. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">630</font></span></p>
