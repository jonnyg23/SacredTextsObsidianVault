 <p align="center"><i>Time is a sword</i>.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Green</span> be the pure grave of Sháfií, <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Whose vine hath cheered a whole world!<br> His thought plucked a star from heaven:<br> He named Time " a cutting sword."<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1535</font></span> How shall I say what is the secret of this sword?<br> All its brilliance is derived from Life.<br> Its owner is exalted above hope and fear,<br> His hand is whiter than the hand of Moses.</p>

 <p>At one stroke thereof water gushes from the rock<br> And the sea becomes land from dearth of moisture. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1540</font></span><br> Moses held this sword in his hand,<br> Therefore he wrought more than man may contrive.<br> He clove the Red Sea asunder<br> And made its waters like dry earth.<br> The arm of Ali, the conqueror of Khaibar, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1545</font></span><br> Drew its strength from this same sword.<br> The revolution of the sky is visible,<br> The change of day and night is perceived.<br> Look, O thou enthralled by Yesterday and To-morrow,<br> Behold another world in thine own heart! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1550</font></span><br> Thou hast sown the seed of darkness in thy clay,<br> Thou hast imagined Time as a line:<br> Thy thought measures length of Time<br> With the measure of night and day.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1555</font></span> Thou makst this line a girdle on thine infidel waist;<br> Thou art an advertiser of falsehood, like idols.<br> Thou wert the Elixir, and thou hast become a peck of dust;<br> Thou wert born the conscience of Truth, and thou hast become a lie!<br> Art thou a Moslem? Then cast off this girdle!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1560</font></span> Be a candle to the feast of the religion of the free!<br> Knowing not the origin of Time,<br> Thou art ignorant of everlasting Life.<br> How long wilt thou be a thrall of night and day?<br> Learn the mystery of Time from the words "I have a time with God." <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1565</font></span> Phenomena arise from the march of Time,</p>

 <p>Life is a part of the contents of Time's consciousness.<br> The cause of Time is not the revolution of the sun:<br> Time is everlasting, but the sun does not last for ever.<br> Time is joy and sorrow, festival and fast;<br> Time is the secret of moonlight and sunlight. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1570</font></span><br> Thou hast extended Time, like Space,<br> And distinguished Yesterday from To-morrow.<br> Thou hast fled, like a scent, from thine own garden;<br> Thou hast made thy prison with thine own hand.<br> Our Time, which has neither beginning nor end, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1575</font></span><br> Blossoms from the flower-bed of our mind.<br> To know its root quickens the living with new life:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p>  
 <p>Its being is more splendid than the dawn.<br> Life is of Time, and Time is of Life:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1580</font></span> "Do not abuse Time!" was the command of the Prophet.<br> Oh, the memory of those days when Time's sword<br> Was allied with the strength of our hands! <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> We sowed the seed of religion in men's hearts<br> And unveiled the face of Truth;<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1585</font></span> Our nails tore loose the knot of this world,<br> Our bowing in prayer gave blessings to the earth.<br> From the jar of Truth we made rosy wine gush forth,<br> We charged against the ancient taverns.<br> O thou in whose cup is old wine,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p>A wine so hot that the glass is well-nigh turned to water, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1590</font></span><br> Wilt thou in thy pride and arrogance and self-conceit<br> Taunt us with our emptiness?<br> Our cup, too, hath graced the symposium;<br> Our breast hath owned a spirit.<br> A new age hath been endued with our beauty <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1595</font></span><br> And hath risen from the dust of our feet.<br> Our blood hath watered God's harvest,<br> All worshippers of God are our debtors.<br> The <i>takbír</i> was our gift to the world, <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Kabas were built of our clay. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1600</font></span><br> By means of us God taught the Koran,<br> From our hand He dispensed His bounty.<br> Although crown and signet have passed from us,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p>Do not look with contempt on our beggarliness!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1605</font></span> In thine eyes we are good for nothing,<br> Thinking old thoughts, despicable.<br> We have honour from "There is no god but Allah,"<br> We are the preservers of the universe.<br> Freed from the vexation of to-day and to-morrow,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1610</font></span> We have pledged ourselves to love One.<br> We are the conscience hidden in God's heart,<br> We are the heirs of Moses and Aaron.<br> Sun and moon are still bright with our radiance,<br> Lightning-flashes still lurk in our cloud.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1615</font></span> Our essence is the mirror of the Divine essence:<br> The Moslem's being is one of the signs of God.</p>
