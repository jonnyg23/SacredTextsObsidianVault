 <p align="center"><i>Setting forth the inner meanings of the names of Ali</i>.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ali</span> is the first Moslem and the King of men, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">965</font></span><br> In Love's eyes Ali is the treasure of the Faith.<br> Devotion to his family inspires me with life<br> So that I am as a shining pearl.<br> Like the narcissus, I am enraptured with gazing;<br> Like perfume, I am straying through his pleasure-garden. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">970</font></span><br> If holy water gushes from my earth, he is the source;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a></p>  
 <p>If wine pours from my grapes, he is the cause.<br> I am dust, but his sun hath made me as a mirror:<br> Song can be seen in my breast.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">975</font></span> From Ali's face the Prophet drew a fair omen,<br> By his majesty the true religion is glorified.<br> His commandments are the strength of Islam:<br> All things pay allegiance to his House.<br> The Apostle of God gave him the name Bú Turáb;<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">980</font></span> God in the Koran called him "the Hand of Allah."<br> Every one that is acquainted with Life's mysteries<br> Knows what is the inner meaning of the names of Ali.<br> The dark clay, whose name is the body<br> Our reason is ever bemoaning its iniquity.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>On account of it our sky-reaching thought plods oer the earth; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">985</font></span><br> It makes our eyes blind and our ears deaf.<br> It hath in its hand a two-edged sword of lust:<br> Travellers hearts are broken by this brigand.<br> Ali, the Lion of God, subdued the body's clay<br> And transmuted this dark earth to gold. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">990</font></span><br> Murtazá, by whose sword the splendour of Truth was revealed,<br> Is named Bú Turáb from his conquest of the body. <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Man wins territory by prowess in battle,<br> But his brightest jewel is mastery of himself. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">995</font></span><br> Whosoever in the world becomes a Bú Turáb<br> Turns back the sun from the west; <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>Whosoever saddles tightly the steed of the body<br> Sits like the bezel on the seal of sovereignty:<br> Here the might of Khaibar is under his feet, <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And hereafter his hand will distribute<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1000</font></span> the water of Kauthar. <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Through self-knowledge he acts as God's Hand,<br> And in virtue of being God's Hand he reigns over all.<br> His person is the gate of the city of the sciences:<br> Arabia, China, and Greece are subject to him.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1005</font></span> If thou wouldst drink clear wine from thine own grapes,<br> Thou must needs wield authority over thine own earth.</p>

 <p>To become earth is the creed of a moth;<br> Be a conqueror of earth; that alone is worthy of a man.<br> Thou art soft as a rose. Become hard as a stone,<br> That thou mayst be the foundation of the wall of the garden! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1010</font></span><br> Build thy clay into a Man,<br> Build thy Man into a World!<br> If thou art unfit to be either a wall or a door,<br> Some one else will make bricks of thine earth.<br> O thou who complainest of the cruelty of Heaven, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1015</font></span><br> Thou whose glass cries out against the injustice of the stone,<br> How long this wailing and crying and lamentation?<br> How long this perpetual beating of thy breast?<br> The pith of Life is contained in action,<br> To delight in creation is the law of Life. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1020</font></span></p>

 <p>Arise and create a new world!<br> Wrap thyself in flames, be an Abraham! <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> To comply with this ill-starred world<br> Is to fling away thy buckler on the field of battle.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1025</font></span> The man of strong character who is master of himself<br> Will find Fortune complaisant.<br> If the world does not comply with his humour,<br> He will try the hazard of war with Heaven;<br> He will dig up the foundations of the universe<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1030</font></span> And cast its atoms into a new mould.<br> He will subvert the course of Time<br> And wreck the azure firmament.<br> By his own strength he will produce<br> A new world which will do his pleasure.<br> If one cannot live in the world as<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1035</font></span> beseems a man,</p>

 <p>It is true life to give up one's soul.<br> He that hath sound intelligence<br> Will prove his strength by great enterprises.<br> Tis sweet to use love in hard tasks<br> And, like Abraham, to gather roses from flames. <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">1</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1040</font></span><br> The potentialities of men of action<br> Are displayed in willing acceptance of what is difficult.<br> Mean spirits have no weapon but spite,<br> This is their one rule of life.<br> But Life is power made manifest, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1043</font></span><br> And its mainspring is the desire for victory.<br> Mercy out of season is a coldness of Life's blood,<br> A break in the rhythm of Life's music.<br> Whoever is sunk in the depths of ignominy<br> Calls his weakness contentment. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1050</font></span></p>

 <p>Weakness is the plunderer of Life,<br> Its womb is teeming with fears and lies.<br> Its soul is empty of virtues,<br> Its milk is a fattening for vices.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1055</font></span> O man of sound judgement, beware!<br> This spoiler is lurking in ambush.<br> Be not his dupe, if thou art wise:<br> Chameleon-like, he changes colour every moment.<br> Even by keen observers his form is not discerned:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1060</font></span> Veils are thrown over his face.<br> Now he is muffled in pity and gentleness,<br> Now he wears the cloak of humility.<br> Sometimes he is disguised as a victim of oppression,<br> Sometimes as one whose sins are to be excused.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1065</font></span> He appears in the shape of self-indulgence<br> And robs the strong man's heart of courage.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 93</font></a></p>  
 <p>Strength is the twin of Truth;<br> If thou knowest thyself, strength is the Truth-revealing glass.<br> Life is the seed, and power the crop:<br> Power explains the mystery of truth and falsehood. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1070</font></span><br> The false claimant, if he be possessed of power,<br> Needs no argument for his claim.<br> Falsehood derives from power the authority of truth,<br> And by falsifying truth deems itself true.<br> Its creative word transforms poison into nectar; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1075</font></span><br> It says to Good, "Thou art bad," and Good becomes Evil.<br> O thou that art heedless of the trust committed to thee,<br> Esteem thyself superior to both worlds! <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>Gain knowledge of Life's mysteries!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1080</font></span> Be a tyrant! Ignore all except God!<br> O man of understanding, open thine eyes, ears, and lips! <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> If then thou seest not the Way of Truth, laugh at me!</p>
