 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">THE DIWAN OF ABU’L-ALA</p>  
 <p align="center">I</p>  
 <p>Abandon worship in the mosque and shrink<br>    From idle prayer, from sacrificial sheep,<br>    For Destiny will bring the bowl of sleep<br> Or bowl of tribulation——you shall drink.</p>  
 <p align="center">II</p>  
 <p>The scarlet eyes of Morning are pursued<br>    By Night, who growls along the narrow lane;<br>    But as they crash upon our world the twain<br> Devour us and are strengthened for the feud.</p>  
 <p align="center">III</p>  
 <p>Vain are your dreams of marvellous emprise,<br>    Vainly you sail among uncharted spaces,<br>    Vainly seek harbour in this world of faces<br> If it has been determined otherwise.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">IV</p>  
 <p>Behold, my friends, there is reserved for me<br>    The splendour of our traffic with the sky:<br>    You pay your court to Saturn, whereas I<br> Am slain by One far mightier than he.</p>  
 <p align="center">V</p>  
 <p>You that must travel with a weary load<br>    Along this darkling, labyrinthine street——<br>    Have men with torches at your head and feet<br> If you would pass the dangers of the road.</p>  
 <p align="center">VI</p>  
 <p>So shall you find all armour incomplete<br>    And open to the whips of circumstance,<br>    That so shall you be girdled of mischance<br> Till you be folded in the winding-sheet.</p>  
 <p align="center">VII</p>  
 <p>Have conversation with the wind that goes<br>    Bearing a pack of loveliness and pain:<br>    The golden exultation of the grain<br> And the last, sacred whisper of the rose</p>  
 <p align="center">VIII</p>  
 <p>But if in some enchanted garden bloom<br>    The rose imperial that will not fade,<br>    Ah! shall I go with desecrating spade<br> And underneath her glories build a tomb?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">IX</p>  
 <p>Shall I that am as dust upon the plain<br>    Think with unloosened hurricanes to fight?<br>    Or shall I that was ravished from the night<br> Fall on the bosom of the night again?</p>  
 <p align="center">X</p>  
 <p>Endure! and if you rashly would unfold<br>    That manuscript whereon our lives are traced,<br>    Recall the stream which carols thro’ the waste<br> And in the dark is rich with alien gold.</p>  
 <p align="center">XI</p>  
 <p>Myself did linger by the ragged beach,<br>    Whereat wave after wave did rise and curl;<br>    And as they fell, they fell—I saw them hurl<br> A message far more eloquent than speech:</p>  
 <p align="center">XII</p>  
 <p><i>We that with song our pilgrimage beguile,</i><br>    <i>With purple islands which a sunset bore,</i><br>    <i>We, sunk upon the sacrilegious shore,</i><br> <i>May parley with oblivion awhile.</i></p>  
 <p align="center">XIII</p>  
 <p>I would not have you keep nor idly flaunt<br>    What may be gathered from the gracious land,<br>    But I would have you sow with sleepless hand<br> The virtues that will balance your account.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XIV</p>  
 <p>The days are dressing all of us in white,<br>    For him who will suspend us in a row.<br>    But for the sun there is no death. I know<br> The centuries are morsels of the night.</p>  
 <p align="center">XV</p>  
 <p>A deed magnanimous, a noble thought<br>    Are as the music singing thro’ the years<br>    When surly Time the tyrant domineers<br> Against the lute whereoutof it was wrought.</p>  
 <p align="center">XVI</p>  
 <p>Now to the Master of the World resign<br>    Whatever touches you, what is prepared,<br>    For many sons of wisdom are ensnared<br> And many fools in happiness recline.</p>  
 <p align="center">XVII</p>  
 <p>Long have I tarried where the waters roll<br>    From undeciphered caverns of the main,<br>    And I have searched, and I have searched in vain,<br> Where I could drown the sorrows of my soul.</p>  
 <p align="center">XVIII</p>  
 <p>If I have harboured love within my breast,<br>    ’Twas for my comrades of the dusty day,<br>    Who with me watched the loitering stars at play,<br> Who bore the burden of the same unrest,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XIX</p>  
 <p>For once the witcheries a maiden flung——<br>    Then afterwards I knew she was the bride<br>    Of Death; and as he came, so tender-eyed,<br> I—I rebuked him roundly, being young.</p>  
 <p align="center">XX</p>  
 <p>Yet if all things that vanish in their noon<br>    Are but the part of some eternal scheme,<br>    Of what the nightingale may chance to dream<br> Or what the lotus murmurs to the moon !</p>  
 <p align="center">XXI</p>  
 <p>Have I not heard sagacious ones repeat<br>    An irresistibly grim argument:<br>    That we for all our blustering content<br> Are as the silent shadows at our feet.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXII</p>  
 <p>Aye, when the torch is low and we prepare<br>    Beyond the notes of revelry to pass——<br>    Old Silence will keep watch upon the grass,<br> The solemn shadows will assemble there.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXIII</p>  
 <p>No Sultan at his pleasure shall erect<br>    A dwelling less obedient to decay<br>    Than I, whom all the mysteries obey,<br> Build with the twilight for an architect,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XXIV</p>  
 <p>Dark leans to dark! the passions of a man<br>    Are twined about all transitory things,<br>    For verily the child of wisdom clings<br> More unto dreamland than Arabistan.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXV</p>  
 <p>Death leans to death! nor shall your vigilance<br>    Prevent him from whate’er he would possess,<br>    Nor, brother, shall unfilial peevishness<br> Prevent you from the grand inheritance.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXVI</p>  
 <p>Farewell, my soul!—bird in the narrow jail<br>    Who cannot sing. The door is opened! Fly!<br>    Ah, soon you stop, and looking down you cry<br> The saddest song of all, poor nightingale.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXVII</p>  
 <p>Our fortune is like mariners to float<br>    Amid the perils of dim waterways;<br>    Shall then our seamanship have aught of praise<br> If the great anchor drags behind the boat?</p>  
 <p align="center">XXVIII</p>  
 <p>Ah! let the burial of yesterday,<br>    Of yesterday be ruthlessly decreed,<br>    And, if you will, refuse the mourner’s reed,<br> And, if you will, plant cypress in the way.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XXIX</p>  
 <p>As little shall it serve you in the fight<br>    If you remonstrate with the storming seas,<br>    As if you querulously sigh to these<br> Of some imagined haven of delight.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXX</p>  
 <p>Steed of my soul! when you and I were young<br>    We lived to cleave as arrows thro’ the night,——<br>    Now there is ta’en from me the last of light,<br> And wheresoe’er I gaze a veil is hung.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXXI</p>  
 <p>No longer as a wreck shall I be hurled<br>    Where beacons lure the fascinated helm,<br>    For I have been admitted to the realm<br> Of darkness that encompasses the world.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXXII</p>  
 <p>Man has been thought superior to the swarm<br>    Of ruminating cows, of witless foals<br>    Who, crouching when the voice of thunder rolls,<br> Are banqueted upon a thunderstorm.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXXIII</p>  
 <p>But shall the fearing eyes of humankind<br>    Have peeped beyond the curtain and excel<br>    The boldness of a wondering gazelle<br> Or of a bird imprisoned in the wind?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XXXIV</p>  
 <p>Ah! never may we hope to win release<br>    Before we that unripeness overthrow,——<br>    So must the corn in agitation grow<br> Before the sickle sings the songs of peace.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXXV</p>  
 <p>Lo! there are many ways and many traps<br>    And many guides, and which of them is lord?<br>    For verily Mahomet has the sword,<br> And he may have the truth—perhaps! <i>perhaps!</i></p>  
 <p align="center">XXXVI</p>  
 <p>Now this religion happens to prevail<br>    Until by that religion overthrown,—<br>    Because men dare not live with men alone,<br> But always with another fairy-tale.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXXVII</p>  
 <p>Religion is a charming girl, I say;<br>    But over this poor threshold will not pass,<br>    For I may not unveil her, and alas!<br> The bridal gift I can’t afford to pay.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXXVIII</p>  
 <p>I have imagined that our welfare is<br>    Required to rise triumphant from defeat;<br>    And so the musk, which as the more you beat,<br> Gives ever more delightful fragrancies.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XXXIX</p>  
 <p>For as a gate of sorrow-land unbars<br>    The region of unfaltering delight,<br>    So may you gather from the fields of night<br> That harvest of diviner thought, the stars.</p>  
 <p align="center">XL</p>  
 <p>Send into banishment whatever blows<br>    Across the waves of your tempestuous heart;<br>    Let every wish save Allah’s wish depart,<br> And you will have ineffable repose.</p>  
 <p align="center">XLI</p>  
 <p>My faith it is that all the wanton pack<br>    Of living shall be—hush, poor heart!—withdrawn,<br>    As even to the camel comes a dawn<br> Without a burden for his wounded back.</p>  
 <p align="center">XLII</p>  
 <p>If there should be some truth in what they teach<br>    Of unrelenting Monkar and Nakyr,<br>    Before whose throne all buried men appear——<br> Then give me to the vultures, I beseech.</p>  
 <p align="center">XLIII</p>  
 <p>Some yellow sand all hunger shall assuage<br>    And for my thirst no cloud have need to roll,<br>    And ah! the drooping bird which is my soul<br> No longer shall be prisoned in the cage.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XLIV</p>  
 <p>Life is a flame that flickers in the wind,<br>    A bird that crouches in the fowler’s net—<br>    Nor may between her flutterings forget<br> That hour the dreams of youth were unconfined.</p>  
 <p align="center">XLV</p>  
 <p>There was a time when I was fain to guess<br>    The riddles of our life, when I would soar<br>    Against the cruel secrets of the door,<br> So that I fell to deeper loneliness.</p>  
 <p align="center">XLVI</p>  
 <p>One is behind the draperies of life,<br>    One who will tear these tanglements away—<br>    No dark assassin, for the dawn of day<br> Leaps out, as leapeth laughter, from the knife.</p>  
 <p align="center">XLVII</p>  
 <p>If you will do some deed before you die,<br>    Remember not this caravan of death,<br>    But have belief that every little breath<br> Will stay with you for an eternity.</p>  
 <p align="center">XLVIII</p>  
 <p>Astrologers!—give ear to what they say!<br>    "The stars be words; they float on heaven’s breath<br>    And faithfully reveal the days of death,<br> And surely will reveal that longer day."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XLIX</p>  
 <p>I shook the trees of knowledge. Ah! the fruit<br>    Was fair upon the bleakness of the soil.<br>    I filled a hundred vessels with my spoil,<br> And then I rested from the grand pursuit.</p>  
 <p align="center">L</p>  
 <p>Alas! I took me servants: I was proud<br>    Of prose and of the neat, the cunning rhyme,<br>    But all their inclination was the crime<br> Of scattering my treasure to the crowd.</p>  
 <p align="center">LI</p>  
 <p>And yet—and yet this very seed I throw<br>    May rise aloft, a brother of the bird,<br>    Uncaring if his melodies are heard——<br> Or shall I not hear anything below?</p>  
 <p align="center">LII</p>  
 <p>The glazier out of sounding Erzerûm,<br>    Frequented us and softly would conspire<br>    Upon our broken glass with blue-red fire,<br> As one might lift a pale thing from the tomb.</p>  
 <p align="center">LIII</p>  
 <p>He was the glazier out of Erzerûm,<br>    Whose wizardry would make the children cry——<br>    There will be no such wizardry when I<br> Am broken by the chariot-wheels of Doom.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LIV</p>  
 <p>The chariot-wheels of Doom! Now, hear them roll<br>    Across the desert and the noisy mart,<br>    Across the silent places of your heart——<br> Smile on the driver you will not cajole.</p>  
 <p align="center">LV</p>  
 <p>I never look upon the placid plain<br>    But I must think of those who lived before<br>    And gave their quantities of sweat and gore,<br> And went and will not travel back again.</p>  
 <p align="center">LVI</p>  
 <p>Aye! verily, the fields of blandishment<br>    Where shepherds meditate among their cattle,<br>    Those are the direst of the fields of battle,<br> For in the victor’s train there is no tent.</p>  
 <p align="center">LVII</p>  
 <p>Where are the doctors who were nobly fired<br>    And loved their toil because we ventured not,<br>    Who spent their lives in searching for the spot<br> To which the generations have retired?</p>  
 <p align="center">LVIII</p>  
 <p>"Great is your soul,"—these are the words they preach,—<br>   "It passes from your framework to the frame<br>    Of others, and upon this road of shame<br> Turns purer and more pure."—Oh, let them teach!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LIX</p>  
 <p>I look on men as I would look on trees,<br>    That may be writing in the purple dome<br>    Romantic lines of black, and are at home<br> Where lie the little garden hostelries.</p>  
 <p align="center">LX</p>  
 <p>Live well! Be wary of this life, I say;<br>    Do not o’erload yourself with righteousness.<br>    Behold! the sword we polish in excess,<br> We gradually polish it away.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXI</p>  
 <p>God who created metal is the same<br>    Who will devour it. As the warriors ride<br>    With iron horses and with iron pride——<br> Come, let us laugh into the merry flame.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXII</p>  
 <p>But for the grandest flame our God prepares<br>    The breast of man, which is the grandest urn;<br>    Yet is that flame so powerless to burn<br> Those butterflies, the swarm of little cares.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXIII</p>  
 <p>And if you find a solitary sage<br>    Who teaches what is truth—ah, then you find<br>    The lord of men, the guardian of the wind,<br> The victor of all armies and of age.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LXIV</p>  
 <p>See that procession passing down the street,<br>    The black and white procession of the days——<br>    Far better dance along and bawl your praise<br> Than if you follow with unwilling feet.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXV</p>  
 <p>But in the noisy ranks you will forget<br>    What is the flag. Oh, comrade, fall aside<br>    And think a little moment of the pride<br> Of yonder sun, think of the twilight’s net.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXVI</p>  
 <p>The songs we fashion from our new delight<br>    Are echoes. When the first of men sang out,<br>    He shuddered, hearing not alone the shout<br> Of hills but of the peoples in the night.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXVII</p>  
 <p>And all the marvels that our eyes behold<br>    Are pictures. There has happened some event<br>    For each of them, and this they represent——<br> Our lives are like a tale that has been told.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXVIII</p>  
 <p>There is a palace, and the ruined wall<br>    Divides the sand, a very home of tears,<br>    And where love whispered of a thousand years<br> The silken-footed caterpillars crawl.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LXIX</p>  
 <p>And where the Prince commanded, now the shriek<br>    Of wind is flying through the court of state:<br>    "Here," it proclaims, "there dwelt a potentate<br> Who could not hear the sobbing of the weak."</p>  
 <p align="center">LXX</p>  
 <p>Beneath our palaces the corner-stone<br>    Is quaking. What of noble we possess,<br>    In love or courage or in tenderness,<br> Can rise from our infirmities alone.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXI</p>  
 <p>We suffer—that we know, and that is all<br>    Our knowledge. If we recklessly should strain<br>    To sweep aside the solid rocks of pain,<br> Then would the domes of love and courage fall.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXII</p>  
 <p>But there is one who trembles at the touch<br>    Of sorrow less than all of you, for he<br>    Has got the care of no big treasury,<br> And with regard to wits not overmuch.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXIII</p>  
 <p>I think our world is not a place of rest,<br>    But where a man may take his little ease,<br>    Until the landlord whom he never sees<br> Gives that apartment to another guest.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LXXIV</p>  
 <p>Say that you come to life as ’twere a feast,<br>    Prepared to pay whatever is the bill<br>    Of death or tears or——surely, friend, you wilt<br> Not shrink at death, which is among the least?</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXV</p>  
 <p>Rise up against your troubles, cast away<br>    What is too great for mortal man to bear.<br>    But seize no foolish arms against the share<br> Which you the piteous mortal have to pay.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXVI</p>  
 <p>Be gracious to the King. You canot feign<br>    That nobody was tyrant, that the sword<br>    Of justice always gave the just award<br> Before these Ghassanites began to reign.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXVII</p>  
 <p>You cultivate the ranks of golden grain,<br>    He cultivates the cavaliers. They go<br>    With him careering on some other foe,<br> And your battalions will be staunch again.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXVIII</p>  
 <p>The good law and the bad law disappear<br>    Below the flood of custom, or they float<br>    And, like the wonderful Sar’aby coat,<br> They captivate us for a little year.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LXXIX</p>  
 <p>God pities him who pities. Ah, pursue<br>    No longer now the children of the wood;<br>    Or have you not, poor huntsman, understood<br> That somebody is overtaking you?</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXX</p>  
 <p>God is above. We never shall attain<br>    Our liberty from hands that overshroud;<br>    Or can we shake aside this heavy cloud<br> More than a slave can shake aside the chain?</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXI</p>  
 <p>"There is no God save Allah!"—that is true,<br>    Nor is there any prophet save the mind<br>    Of man who wanders through the dark to find<br> The Paradise that is in me and you.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXII</p>  
 <p>The rolling, ever-rolling years of time<br>    Are as a diwan of Arabian song;<br>    The poet, headstrong and supremely strong,<br> Refuses to repeat a single rhyme.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXIII</p>  
 <p>An archer took an arrow in his hand;<br>    So fair he sent it singing to the sky<br>    That he brought justice down from—ah, so high!<br> He was an archer in the morning land.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXIV</p>  
 <p>The man who shot his arrow from the west<br>    Made empty roads of air; yet have I thought<br>    Our life was happier until we brought<br> This cold one of the skies to rule the nest.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXV</p>  
 <p>Run! follow, follow happiness, the maid<br>    Whose laughter is the laughing waterfall;<br>    Run! call to her—but if no maiden call,<br> ’Tis something to have loved the flying shade.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXVI</p>  
 <p>You strut in piety the while you take<br>    That pilgrimage to Mecca. Now beware,<br>    For starving relatives befoul the air,<br> And curse, O fool, the threshold you forsake.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXVII</p>  
 <p>How man is made! He staggers at the voice,<br>    The little voice that leads you to the land<br>    Of virtue; but, on hearing the command<br> To lead a giant army, will rejoice.</p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXVIII</p>  
 <p>Behold the cup whereon your slave has trod;<br>    That is what every cup is falling to.<br>    Your slave—remember that he lives by you,<br> While in the form of him we bow to God.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">LXXXIX</p>  
 <p>The lowliest of the people is the lord<br>    Who knows not where each day to make his bed,<br>    Whose crown is kept upon the royal head<br> By that poor naked minister, the sword.</p>  
 <p align="center">XC</p>  
 <p>Which is the tyrant? say you. Well, ’tis he<br>    That has the vine-leaf strewn among his hair<br>    And will deliver countries to the care<br> Of courtesans——but I am vague, you see.</p>  
 <p align="center">XCI</p>  
 <p>The dwellers of the city will oppress<br>    Your days: the lion, a fight-thirsty fool,<br>    The fox who wears the robe of men that rule——<br> So run with me towards the wilderness.</p>  
 <p align="center">XCII</p>  
 <p>Our wilderness will be the laughing land,<br>    Where nuts are hung for us, where nodding peas<br>    Are wild enough to press about our knees,<br> And water fills the hollow of our hand.</p>  
 <p align="center">XCIII</p>  
 <p>My village is the loneliness, and I<br>    Am as the travellers through the Syrian sand,<br>    That for a moment see the warning hand<br> Of one who breasted up the rock, their spy.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">XCIV</p>  
 <p>Where is the valiance of the folk who sing<br>    These valiant stories of the world to come?<br>    Which they describe, forsooth! as if it swum<br> In air and anchored with a yard of string.</p>  
 <p align="center">XCV</p>  
 <p>Two merchantmen decided they would battle,<br>    To prove at last who sold the finest wares;<br>    And while Mahomet shrieked his call to prayers,<br> The true Messiah waved his wooden rattle.</p>  
 <p align="center">XCVI</p>  
 <p>Perchance the world is nothing, is a dream,<br>    And every noise the dreamland people say<br>    We sedulously note, and we and they<br> May be the shadows flung by what we seem.</p>  
 <p align="center">XCVII</p>  
 <p>Zohair the poet sang of loveliness<br>    Which is the flight of things. Oh, meditate<br>    Upon the sorrows of our earthly state,<br> For what is lovely we may not possess.</p>  
 <p align="center">XCVIII</p>  
 <p>Heigho! the splendid air is full of wings,<br>    And they will take us to the——friend, be wise<br>    For if you navigate among the skies<br> You too may reach the subterranean kings.</p>

 <p>Now fear the rose! You travel to the gloom<br>    Of which the roses sing and sing so fair,<br>    And, but for them, you’d have a certain share<br> In life: your name be read upon the tomb.</p>  
 <p align="center">C</p>  
 <p>There is a tower of silence, and the bell<br>    Moves up—another man is made to be.<br>    For certain years they move in company,<br> But you, when fails your song do fail as well.</p>  
 <p align="center">CI</p>  
 <p>No sword will summon Death, and he will stay<br>    For neither helm nor shield his falling rod.<br>    We are the crooked alphabet of God,<br> And He will read us ere he wipes away.</p>  
 <p align="center">CII</p>  
 <p>How strange that we, perambulating dust,<br>    Should be the vessels of eternal fire,<br>    That such unfading passion of desire<br> Should be within our fading bodies thrust.</p>

 <p><i>Deep in a silent chamber of the rose<br> There was a fattened worm. He looked around,<br> Espied a relative and spoke at him:<br> It seems to me this world is very good.</i></p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">CIV</p>  
 <p><i>A most unlovely world, said brother worm,<br> For all of us are piteous prisoners.<br> And if, declared the first, your thought is true,<br> And this a prison be, melikes it well.</i></p>  
 <p align="center">CV</p>  
 <p><i>So well that I shall weave a song of praise<br> And thankfulness because the world was wrought<br> For us and with such providential care——<br> My brother, I will shame you into singing.</i></p>  
 <p align="center">CVI</p>  
 <p><i>Then, cried the second, I shall raise a voice<br> And see what poor apologies are made.<br> And so they sang, these two, for many days,<br> And while they sang the rose was beautiful.</i></p>  
 <p align="center">CVII</p>  
 <p><i>But this affected not the songful ones,<br> And evermore in beauty lived the rose.<br> And when the worms were old and wiser too,<br> They fell to silence and humility.</i></p>  
 <p align="center">CVIII</p>  
 <p>A night of silence! ’Twas the swinging sea<br>    And this our world of darkness. And the twain<br>    Rolled on below the stars; they flung a chain<br> Around the silences which are in me.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">CIX</p>  
 <p>The shadows come, and they will come to bless<br>    Their brother and his dwelling and his fame,<br>    When I shall soil no more with any blame<br> Or any praise the silence I possess.</p>
