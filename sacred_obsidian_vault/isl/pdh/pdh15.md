 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XIII</h2>  
 <p>LADY that hast my heart within thy hand,<br> Thou heedst me not; and if thou turn thine ear<br> Unto the wise, thou shalt not understand<br> Behold the fault is thine, our words were clear.<br> For all the tumult in my drunken brain<br> Praise God! who trieth not His slave in vain;<br> Nor this world nor the next shall make me fear!</p>  
 <p>My weary heart eternal silence keeps<br> I know not who has slipped into my heart;<br> Though I am silent, one within me weeps.<br> My soul shall rend the painted veil apart.<br> Where art thou, Minstrel! touch thy saddest strings<br> Till clothed in music such as sorrow sings,<br> My mournful story from thy zither sweeps.</p>  
 <p>Lo, not at any time I lent mine ear<br> To hearken to the glories of the earth;<br> Only thy beauty to mine eyes was dear.<br> Sleep has forsaken me, and from the birth<br> Of night till day I weave bright dreams of thee;<br> Drunk with a hundred nights of revelry,<br> Where is the tavern that sets forth such cheer!</p>  
 <p>My heart, sad hermit, stains the cloister floor<br> With drops of blood, the sweat of anguish dire;<br> Ah, wash me clean, and o'er my body pour<br> Love's generous wine! the worshippers of fire<br> Have bowed them down and magnified my name,<br> For in my heart there burns a living flame,<br> Transpiercing Death's impenetrable door.</p>  
 <p>What instrument through last night's silence rang?<br> My life into his lay the minstrel wove,<br> And filled my brain with the sweet song he sang.<br> It was the proclamation of thy love<br> That shook the strings of Life's most secret lyre,<br> And still my breast heaves with last night's desire,<br> For countless echoes from that music sprang.</p>  
 <p>And ever, since the time that Hafiz heard<br> His Lady's voice, as from a rocky hill<br> Reverberates the softly spoken word,<br> So echoes of desire his bosom fill.</p>
