 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XXXIV</h2>  
 <p>LAST night I dreamed that angels stood without<br> The tavern door, and knocked in vain, and wept;<br> They took the clay of Adam, and, methought,<br> Moulded a cup therewith while all men slept.<br> Oh dwellers in the halls of Chastity!<br> You brought Love's passionate red wine to me,<br> Down to the dust I am, your bright feet stept.</p>  
 <p>For Heaven's self was all too weak to bear<br> The burden of His love God laid on it,<br> He turned to seek a messenger elsewhere,<br> And in the Book of Fate my name was writ.<br> Between my Lord and me such concord lies.<br> As makes the Huris glad in Paradise,<br> With songs of praise through the green glades they flit.</p>  
 <p>A hundred dreams of Fancy's garnered store<br> Assail meFather Adam went astray<br> Tempted by one poor grain of corn! Wherefore<br> Absolve and pardon him that turns away<br> Though the soft breath of Truth reaches his ears,<br> For two-and-seventy jangling creeds he hears,<br> And loud-voiced Fable calls him ceaselessly.</p>  
 <p>That, that is not the flame of Love's true fire<br> Which makes the torchlight shadows dance in rings,<br> But where the radiance draws the moth's desire<br> And send him forth with scorched and drooping wings.<br> The heart of one who dwells retired shall break,<br> Rememb'ring a black mole and a red cheek,<br> And his life ebb, sapped at its secret springs.</p>  
 <p>Yet since the earliest time that man has sought<br> To comb the locks of Speech, his goodly bride,<br> Not one, like Hafiz, from the face of Thought<br> Has torn the veil of Ignorance aside.</p>
