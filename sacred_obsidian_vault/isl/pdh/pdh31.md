 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XXIX</h2>  
 <p>FROM Canaan Joseph shall return, whose face<br> A little time was hidden: weep no more<br> Oh, weep no more! in sorrow's dwelling-place<br> The roses yet shall spring from the bare floor!<br> And heart bowed down beneath a secret pain<br> Oh stricken heart! joy shall return again,<br> Peace to the love-tossed brainoh, weep no more!</p>  
 <p>Oh, weep no more! for once again Life's Spring<br> Shall throne her in the meadows green, and o'er<br> Her head the minstrel of the night shall fling<br> A canopy of rose leaves, score on score.<br> The secret of the world thou shalt not learn,<br> And yet behind the veil Love's fire may burn<br> Weep'st thou? let hope return and weep no more!</p>  
 <p>To-day may pass, to-morrow pass, before<br> The turning wheel give me my heart's desire;<br> Heaven's self shall change, and turn not evermore<br> The universal wheel of Fate in ire.<br> Oh Pilgr'm nearing Mecca's holy fane,<br> The thorny maghilan wounds thee in vain,<br> The desert blooms againoh, weep no more!</p>  
 <p>What though the river of mortality<br> Round the unstable house of Life doth roar,<br> Weep not, oh heart, Noah shall pilot thee,<br> And guide thine ark to the desirèd shore!<br> The goal lies far, and perilous is thy road,<br> Yet every path leads to that same abode<br> Where thou shalt drop thy loadoh, weep no more!</p>  
 <p>Mine enemies have persecuted me,<br> My Love has turned and fled from out my door<br> God counts our tears and knows our misery;<br> Ah, weep not! He has heard thy weeping sore.<br> And chained in poverty and plunged in night,<br> Oh Hafiz, take thy Koran and recite<br> Litanies infinite, and weep no more!</p>
