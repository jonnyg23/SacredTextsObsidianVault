 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h1 align="center">THE POEMS</h1>  <h2 align="center">I</h2>  
 <p>ARISE, oh Cup-bearer, rise! and bring<br> To lips that are thirsting the bowl they praise,<br> For it seemed that love was an easy thing,<br> But my feet have fallen on difficult ways.<br> I have prayed the wind o'er my heart to fling<br> The fragrance of musk in her hair that sleeps<br> In the night of her hair-yet no fragrance stays<br> The tears of my heart's blood my sad heart weeps.</p>  
 <p>Hear the Tavern-keeper who counsels you:<br> "With wine, with red wine your prayer carpet dye!"<br> There was never a traveller like him but knew<br> The ways of the road and the hostelry.<br> Where shall I rest, when the still night through,<br> Beyond thy gateway, oh Heart of my heart,<br> The bells of the camels lament and cry:<br> "Bind up thy burden again and depart!"</p>  
 <p>The waves run high, night is clouded with fears,<br> And eddying whirlpools clash and roar;<br> How shall my drowning voice strike their ears<br> Whose light-freighted vessels have reached the shore?<br> I sought mine own; the unsparing years<br> Have brought me mine own, a dishonoured name.<br> What cloak shall cover my misery o'er<br> When each jesting mouth has rehearsed my shame!<br> Oh Hafiz, seeking an end to strife,<br> Hold fast in thy mind what the wise have writ:<br> "If at last thou attain the desire of thy life,<br> Cast the world aside, yea, abandon it!"</p>
