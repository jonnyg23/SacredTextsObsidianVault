 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XXV</h2>  
 <p>THE days of absence and the bitter nights<br> Of separation, all are at an end!<br> Where is the influence of the star that blights<br> My hope? The omen answers: At an end!<br> Autumn's abundance, creeping Autumn's mirth,<br> Are ended and forgot when o'er the earth<br> The wind of Spring with soft warm feet doth wend.</p>  
 <p>The Day of Hope, hid beneath Sorrow's veil,<br> Has shown its faceah, cry that all may hear:<br> Come forth! the powers of night no more prevail!<br> Praise be to God, now that the rose is near<br> With long-desired and flaming coronet,<br> The cruel stinging thorns all men forget,<br> The wind of Winter ends its proud career.</p>  
 <p>The long confusion of the nights that were,<br> Anguish that dwelt within my heart, is o'er;<br> 'Neath the protection of my lady's hair<br> Grief nor disquiet come to me no more.<br> What though her curls wrought all my misery,<br> My lady's gracious face can comfort me,<br> And at the end give what I sorrow for.</p>  
 <p>Light-hearted to the tavern let me go,<br> Where laughs the pipe, the merry cymbals kiss;<br> Under the history of all my woe,<br> My mistress sets her hand and writes: Finis.<br> Oh, linger not, nor trust the inconstant days<br> That promised: Where thou art thy lady stays<br> The tale of separation ends with this!</p>  
 <p>Joy's certain path, oh Saki, thou hast shown<br> Long may thy cup be full, thy days be fair!<br> Trouble and sickness from my breast have flown,<br> Order and health thy wisdom marshals there.<br> Not one that numbered Hafiz name among<br> The great-unnumbered were his tears, unsung;<br> Praise him that sets an end to endless care!</p>
