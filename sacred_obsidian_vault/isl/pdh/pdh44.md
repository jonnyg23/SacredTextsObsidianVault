 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XLII</h2>  
 <p>TRUE love has vanished from every heart;<br> What has befallen all lovers fair?<br> When did the bonds of friendship part?<br> What has befallen the friends that were?<br> Ah, why are the feet of Khizr lingering?<br> The waters of life are no longer clear,<br> The purple rose has turned pale with fear,<br> And what has befallen the wind of Spring?</p>  
 <p>None now sayeth: "A love was mine,<br> Loyal and wise, to dispel my care."<br> None remembers love's right divine;<br> What has befallen all lovers fair?<br> In the midst of the field, to the players' feet,<br> The ball of God's favour and mercy came,<br> But none has leapt forth to renew the game<br> What has befallen the horsemen fleet?</p>  
 <p>Roses have bloomed, yet no bird rejoiced,<br> No vibrating throat has rung with the tale;<br> What can have silenced the hundred-voiced?<br> What has befallen the nightingale?<br> Heaven's music is hushed, and the planets roll<br> In silence; has Zohra broken her lute?<br> There is none to press out the vine's ripe fruit,<br> And what has befallen the foaming bowl?</p>  
 <p>A city where kings are but lovers crowned,<br> A land from the dust of which friendship springs<br> Who has laid waste that enchanted ground?<br> What has befallen the city of kings?<br> Years have passed since a ruby was won<br> From the mine of manhood; they labour in vain,<br> The fleet-footed wind and the quickening rain,<br> And what has befallen the light of the sun?</p>  
 <p>Hafiz, the secret of God's dread task<br> No man knoweth, in youth or prime<br> Or in wisest age; of whom wouldst thou ask:<br> What has befallen the wheels of Time?</p>
