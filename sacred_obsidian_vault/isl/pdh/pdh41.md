 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XXXIX</h2>  
 <p>CYPRESS and Tulip and sweet Eglantine,<br> Of these the tale from lip to lip is sent;<br> Washed by three cups, oh Saki, of thy wine,<br> My song shall turn upon this argument.<br> Spring, bride of all the meadows, rises up,<br> Clothed in her ripest beauty: fill the cup!<br> Of Spring's handmaidens runs this song of mine.</p>  
 <p>The sugar-loving birds of distant Ind,<br> Except a Persian sweetmeat that was brought<br> To fair Bengal, have found nought to their mind.<br> See how my song, that in one night was wrought,<br> Defies the limits set by space and time!<br> O'er plains and mountain-tops my fearless rhyme,<br> Child of a night, its year-long road shall find.</p>  
 <p>And thou whose sense is dimmed with piety,<br> Thou too shalt learn the magic of her eyes;<br> Forth comes the caravan of sorcery<br> When from those gates the blue-veined curtains rise.<br> And when she walks the flowery meadows through,<br> Upon the jasmine's shamèd cheek the dew<br> Gathers like sweat, she is so fair to see!</p>  
 <p>Ah, swerve not from the path of righteousness<br> Though the world lure thee! like a wrinkled crone,<br> Hiding beneath her robe lasciviousness,<br> She plunders them that pause and heed her moan.<br> From Sinai Moses brings thee wealth untold;<br> Bow not thine head before the calf of gold<br> Like Samir, following after wickedness.</p>  
 <p>From the Shah's garden blows the wind of Spring,<br> The tulip in her lifted chalice bears<br> A dewy wine of Heaven's ministring<br> Until Ghiyasuddin, the Sultan, hears,<br> Sing, Hafiz, of thy longing for his face.<br> The breezes whispering round thy dwelling-place<br> Shall carry thy lament unto the King.</p>
