 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">IX</h2>  
 <p><i>Stanza 1</i>.This poem is addressed to the Vizir of Sultan Oweis of Baghdad, Hadji Kawameddin, who founded a college for Hafiz in Shiraz. With true Persian exaggeration the poet must needs write to his patron much in the same terms in which a lover would write to his mistress; but his words, though they sound strangely to our ears, are nothing more than the Oriental way of saying, "Awake, my St. John!"</p>  
 <p>The mystical interpretation of the first few lines is said to be: As the wine glows in the cup like the reflection of a ruddy cheek, so in the goblet of my heart I have seen the reflection of God, the true Beloved.</p>  
 <p><i>Stanza 6</i>.It is related that upon a certain occasion when Hafiz was feasting with the Vizir in the latter's garden, a servant handed to him a goblet of wine, and as he took it he saw in it the reflection of the crescent moon overhead. The incident suggested this verse to him. I should say that the anecdote was of doubtful authenticity.</p>
