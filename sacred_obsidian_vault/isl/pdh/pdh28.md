 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XXVI</h2>  
 <p>THE secret draught of wine and love repressed<br> Are joys foundationlessthen come whateer<br> May come, slave to the grape I stand confessed!<br> Unloose, oh friend, the knot of thy heart's care,<br> Despite the warning that the Heavens reveal!<br> For all his thought, never astronomer<br> That loosed the knot of Fate those Heavens conceal!</p>  
 <p>Not all the changes that thy days unfold<br> Shall rouse thy wonder; Time's revolving sphere<br> Over a thousand lives like thine has rolled.<br> That cup within thy fingers, dost not hear<br> The voices of dead kings speak through the clay<br> Kobad, Bahman, Djemshid, their dust is here,<br> "Gently upon me set thy lips!" they say.</p>  
 <p>What man can tell where Kaus and Kai have gone?<br> Who knows where even now the restless wind<br> Scatters the dust of Djem's imperial throne?<br> And where the tulip, following close behind<br> The feet of Spring, her scarlet chalice rears,<br> There Ferhad for the love of Shirin pined,<br> Dyeing the desert red with his heart's tears.</p>  
 <p>Bring, bring the cup! drink we while yet we may<br> To our soul's ruin the forbidden draught<br> Perhaps a treasure-trove is hid away<br> Among those ruins where the wine has laughed!<br> Perhaps the tulip knows the fickleness<br> Of Fortune's smile, for on her stalk's green shaft<br> She bears a wine-cup through the wilderness.</p>  
 <p>The murmuring stream of Ruknabad, the breeze<br> That blows from out Mosalla's fair pleasaunce,<br> Summon me back when I would seek heart's ease,<br> Travelling afar; what though Love's countenance<br> Be turned full harsh and sorrowful on me,<br> I care not so that Time's unfriendly glance<br> Still from my Lady's beauty turned be.</p>  
 <p>Like Hafiz, drain the goblet cheerfully<br> While minstrels touch the lute and sweetly sing,<br> For all that makes thy heart rejoice in thee<br> Hangs of Life's single, slender, silken string.</p>
