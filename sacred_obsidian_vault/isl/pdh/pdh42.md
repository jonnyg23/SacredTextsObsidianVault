 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XL</h2>  
 <p>THE margin of a stream, the willow's shade,<br> A mind inclined to song, a mistress sweet,<br> A Cup-bearer whose cheek outshines the rose,<br> A friend upon whose heart thy heart is laid:<br> Oh Happy-starred! let not thine hours fleet<br> Unvalued; may each minute as it goes<br> Lay tribute of enjoyment at thy feet,<br> That thou may'st live and know thy life is sweet.</p>  
 <p>Let every one upon whose heart desire<br> For a fair face lies like a burden sore,<br> That all his hopes may reach their goal unchecked,<br> Throw branches of wild rue upon his fire.<br> My soul is like a bride, with a rich store<br> Of maiden thoughts and jewelled fancies decked,<br> And in Time's gallery I yet may meet<br> Some picture meant for me, some image sweet.</p>  
 <p>Give thanks for nights spent in good company,<br> And take the gifts a tranquil mind may bring;<br> No heart is dark when the kind moon doth shine,<br> And grass-grown river-banks are fair to see.<br> The Saki's radiant eyes, God favouring,<br> Are like a wine-cup brimming o'er with wine,<br> And him my drunken sense goes out to greet,<br> For een the pain he leaves behind is sweet.</p>  
 <p>Hafiz, thy life has sped untouched by care,<br> With me towards the tavern turn thy feet!<br> The fairest robbers thoult encounter there,<br> And they will teach thee what to learn is sweet.</p>
