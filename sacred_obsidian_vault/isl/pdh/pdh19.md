 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XVII</h2>  
 <p>LAY not reproach at the drunkard's door<br> Oh Fanatic, thou that art pure of soul;<br> Not thine on the page of life to enrol<br> The faults of others! Or less or more<br> I have swerved from my pathkeep thou to thine own<br> For every man when he reaches the goal<br> Shall reap the harvest his hands have sown.</p>  
 <p>Leave me the hope of a former grace<br> Till the curtain is lifted none can tell<br> Whether in Heaven or deepest Hell,<br> Fair or vile, shall appear his face.<br> Alike the drunk and the strict of fare<br> For his mistress yearnsin the mosque Love doth dwell<br> And the church, for his lodging is everywhere.</p>  
 <p>If without the house of devotion I stand,<br> I am not the first to throw wide the door<br> My father opened it long before,<br> The eternal Paradise slipped from his hand.<br> All you that misconstrue my words' intent,<br> I lie on the bricks of the tavern floor,<br> And a brick shall serve me for argument.</p>  
 <p>Heaven's garden future treasures may yield<br> Ah, make the most of earth's treasury!<br> The flickering shade of the willow-tree,<br> And the grass-grown lip of the fruitful field.<br> Trust not in deedsthe Eternal Day<br> Shall reveal the Creator's sentence on thee;<br> But till then, what His finger has writ, who can say.</p>  
 <p>Bring the cup in thine hand to the Judgment-seat;<br> Thou shalt rise, oh Hafiz, to Heaven's gate<br> From the tavern where thou hast tarried late.<br> And if thou hast worshipped wine, thou shalt meet<br> The reward that the Faithful attain;<br> If such thy life, then fear not thy fate,<br> Thou shalt not have lived and worshipped in vain.</p>
