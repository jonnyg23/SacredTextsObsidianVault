 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XXVIII</h2>  
 <p>HAST thou forgotten when thy stolen glance<br> Was turned to me, when on my happy face<br> Clearly thy love was writ, which doth enhance<br> All happiness? or when my sore disgrace<br> (Hast thou forgot?) drew from thine eyes reproof,<br> And made thee hold thy sweet red lips aloof,<br> Dowered, like Jesus's breath, with healing grace?</p>  
 <p>Hast thou forgotten how the glorious<br> Swift nights flew past, the cup of dawn brimmed high?<br> My love and I alone, God favouring us!<br> And when she like a waning moon did lie,<br> And Steep had drawn his coif about her brow,<br> Hast thou forgot? Heaven's crescent moon would bow<br> The head, and in her service pace the sky!</p>  
 <p>Hast thou forgotten, when a sojourner<br> Within the tavern gates and drunk with wine,<br> I found Love's passionate wisdom hidden there,<br> Which in the mosque none even now divine?<br> The goblet's carbuncle (hast thou forgot?)<br> Laughed out aloud, and speech flew hot<br> And fast between thy ruby lips and mine!</p>  
 <p>Hast thou forgotten when thy cheek's dear torch<br> Lighted the beacon of desire in me,<br> And when my heart, like foolish moths that scorch<br> Their wings and yet return, turned all to thee?<br> Within the banquet-hall of Good Repute<br> (Hast thou forgot?) the wine's self-pressed my suit,<br> And filled the morn with drunken jollity!</p>  
 <p>Hast thou forgotten when thou laid'st aright<br> The uncut gems of Hafiz inmost thought,<br> And side by side thy sweet care strung the bright<br> Array of verse on verse-hast thou forgot?</p>
