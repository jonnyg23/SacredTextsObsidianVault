 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XV</h2>  
 <p>RETURN! that to a heart wounded full sore<br> Valiance and strength may enter in; return!<br> And Life shall pause at the deserted door,<br> The cold dead body breathe again and burn.<br> Oh come! and touch mine eyes, of thy sweet grace,<br> For I am blind to all but to thy face.<br> Open the gates and bid me see once more!</p>  
 <p>Like to a cruel Ethiopian band,<br> Sorrow despoiled the kingdom of my heart<br> Return! glad Lord of Rome, and free the land;<br> Before thine arms the foe shall break and part.<br> See now, I hold a mirror to mine eyes,<br> And nought but thy reflection therein lies;<br> The glass speaks truth to them that understand.</p>  
 <p>Night is with child, hast thou not heard men say?<br> "Night is with child! what will she bring to birth?"<br> I sit and ask the stars when thou'rt away.<br> Oh come! and when the nightingale of mirth<br> Pipes in the Spring-awakened garden ground,<br> In Hafiz heart shall ring a sweeter sound,<br> Diviner nightingales attune their lay.</p>
