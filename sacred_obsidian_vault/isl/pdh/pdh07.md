 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">V</h2>  
 <p>OH Turkish maid of Shiraz! in thy hand<br> If thoult take my heart, for the mole on thy cheek<br> I would barter Bokhara and Samarkand.<br> Bring, Cup-bearer, all that is left of thy wine!<br> In the Garden of Paradise vainly thoult seek<br> The lip of the fountain of Ruknabad,<br> And the bowers of Mosalla where roses twine.</p>  
 <p>They have filled the city with blood and broil,<br> Those soft-voiced Lulis for whom we sigh;<br> As Turkish robbers fall on the spoil,<br> They have robbed and plundered the peace of my heart.<br> Dowered is my mistress, a beggar am I;<br> What shall I bring her? a beautiful face<br> Needs nor jewel nor mole nor the tiring-maid's art.</p>  
 <p>Brave tales of singers and wine relate,<br> The key to the Hidden 'twere vain to seek;<br> No wisdom of ours has unlocked that gate,<br> And locked to our wisdom it still shall be.<br> But of Joseph's beauty the lute shall speak;<br> And the minstrel knows that Zuleika came forth,<br> Love parting the curtains of modesty.</p>  
 <p>When thou spokest ill of thy servant 'twas well<br> God pardon thee! for thy words were sweet;<br> Not unwelcomed the bitterest answer fell<br> From lips where the ruby and sugar lay.<br> But, fair Love, let good counsel direct thy feet;<br> Far dearer to youth than dear life itself<br> Are the warnings of one grown wiseand grey!</p>  
 <p>The song is sung and the pearl is strung<br> Come hither, oh Hafiz, and sing again!<br> And the listening Heavens above thee hung<br> Shall loose o'er thy verse the Pleiades chain.</p>
