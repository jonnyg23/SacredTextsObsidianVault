 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XVIII</h2>  
 <p>SLAVES of thy shining eyes are even those<br> That diadems of might and empire bear;<br> Drunk with the wine that from thy red lip flows,<br> Are they that een the grape's delight forswear.<br> Drift, like the wind across a violet bed,<br> Before thy many lovers, weeping low,<br> And clad like violets in blue robes of woe,<br> Who feel thy wind-blown hair and bow the head.</p>  
 <p>Thy messenger the breath of dawn, and mine<br> A stream of tears, since lover and beloved<br> Keep not their secret; through my verses shine,<br> Though other lays my flower's grace have proved<br> And countless nightingales have sung thy praise.<br> When veiled beneath thy curls thou passest, see,<br> To right and leftward those that welcome thee<br> Have bartered peace and rest on thee to gaze!</p>  
 <p>But thou that knowest God by heart, away!<br> Wine-drunk, love-drunk, we inherit Paradise,<br> His mercy is for sinners; hence and pray<br> Where wine thy cheek red as red erghwan dyes,<br> And leave the cell to faces sinister.<br> Oh Khizr, whose happy feet bathed in life's fount,<br> Help one who toils afoot-the horsemen mount<br> And hasten on their way; I scarce can stir.</p>  
 <p>Ah, loose me not! ah, set not Hafiz free<br> From out the bondage of thy gleaming hair!<br> Safe only those, safe, and at liberty,<br> That fast enchained in thy linked ringlets are.<br> But from the image of his dusty cheek<br> Learn this from Hafiz: proudest heads shall bend,<br> And dwellers on the threshold of a friend<br> Be crownèd with the dust that crowns the meek.</p>
