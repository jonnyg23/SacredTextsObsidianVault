 <p>SINGER, sweet Singer, fresh notes strew,<br> Fresh and afresh and new and new!<br> Heart-gladdening wine thy lips imbrue,<br> Fresh and afresh and new and new!</p>  
 <p>Saki, thy radiant feet I hail;<br> Flush with red wine the goblets pale,<br> Flush our pale cheeks to drunken hue,<br> Fresh and afresh and new and new!</p>  
 <p>Then with thy love to toy with thee,<br> Rest thee, ah, rest! where none can see<br> Seek thy delight, for kisses sue,<br> Fresh and afresh and new and new!</p>  
 <p>Here round thy life the vine is twined;<br> Drink I for elsewhere what wine wilt find?<br> Drink to her name, to hours that flew,<br> Hours ever fresh and new and new!</p>  
 <p>She that has stolen my heart from me,<br> How does she wield her empery?<br> Paints and adorns and scents her too,<br> Fresh and afresh and new and new!</p>  
 <p>Wind of the dawn that passest by,<br> Swift to the street of my fairy hie,<br> Whisper the tale of Hafiz true,<br> Fresh and afresh and new and new!</p>
