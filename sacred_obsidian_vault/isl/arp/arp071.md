 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">WHEN you told us our glances, soft, timid, and mild,<br>   Could occasion such wounds in the heart,<br> Can ye wonder that yours, so ungoverned and wild,<br>   Some wounds to our cheeks should impart?  
 <p>The wounds on our cheeks are but transient, I own,<br>   With a blush they appear and decay;<br> But those on the heart, fickle youths, ye have shown<br>   To be even more transient than they.</p></div>
