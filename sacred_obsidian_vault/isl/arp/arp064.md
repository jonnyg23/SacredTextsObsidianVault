 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">TOWERING as Barkaidy's face,<br>   The wintry night came in,<br> Cold as the music of his bass,<br>   And lengthened as his chin.  
 <p>Sleep from my aching eyes had fled,<br>   And kept as far apart<br> As sense from Ebn Fadhi's head,<br>   Or virtue from his heart.</p>  
 <p>The dubious paths my footsteps balked,<br>   I slipped along the sod,<br> As if on Jaber's faith I'd walked,<br>   Or on his truth had trod.</p>  
 <p>At length the rising King of Day<br>   Burst on the gloomy wood,<br> Like Carawash's eye, whose ray<br>   Dispenses every good.</p></div>
