 <p>LEILA, with too successful art,<br>   Has spread for me Love's cruel snare;<br> And now, when she has caught my heart,<br>   She laughs, and leaves it to despair.</p>  
 <p>Thus the poor sparrow pants for breath,<br>   Held captive by a playful boy;<br> And while it drinks the draught of death,<br>   The thoughtless child looks on with joy.</p>  
 <p>Ah! were its fluttering pinions free,<br>   Soon would it bid its chains adieu;<br> Or did the child its sufferings see,<br>   He'd pity and relieve them too.</p>
