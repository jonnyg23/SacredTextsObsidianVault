 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">POOR Puss is gone!—’tis Fate's decree—<br>   Yet I must still her loss deplore;<br> For dearer than a child was she,<br>   And ne’er shall I behold her more.  
 <p>With many a sad presaging tear,<br>   This morn I saw her steal away,<br> While she went on without a fear,<br>   Except that she should miss her prey.</p>  
 <p>I saw her to the dove-house climb,<br>   With cautious feet and slow she stept,<br> Resolved to balance loss of time<br>   By eating faster than she crept.</p>  
 <p>Her subtle foes were on the watch,<br>   And marked her course, with fury fraught;<br> And while she hoped the birds to catch,<br>   An arrow's point the huntress caught.</p>  
 <p>In fancy she had got them all,<br>   And drunk their blood and sucked their breath;<br> Alas! she only got a fall,<br>   And only drank the draught of death.</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Why, why was pigeon's flesh so nice,<br>   That thoughtless cats should love it thus?<br> Hadst thou but lived on rats and mice,<br>   Thou hadst been living still, poor Puss!  
 <p>Cursed be the taste, howe’er refined,<br>   That prompts us for such joys to wish;<br> And cursed the dainty where we find<br>   Destruction lurking in the dish!</p></div>
