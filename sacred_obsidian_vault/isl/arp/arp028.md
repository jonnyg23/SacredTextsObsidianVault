 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">HOW frail are riches and their joys!<br> Morn builds the heap which eve destroys;<br> Yet can they leave one sure delight—<br> The thought that we've employed them right.  
 <p>What bliss can wealth afford to me,<br> When life's last solemn hour I see?—<br> When Mavia's sympathising sighs<br> Will but augment my agonies?</p>  
 <p>Can hoarded gold dispel the gloom<br> That death must shed around his tomb?<br> Or cheer the ghost which hovers there,<br> And fills with shrieks the desert air?</p>  
 <p>What boots it, Mavia, in the grave,<br> Whether I loved to waste or save?<br> The hand that millions now can grasp<br> In death no more than mine shall clasp.</p>  
 <p>Were I ambitious to behold<br> Increasing stores of treasured gold,<br> Each tribe that roves the desert knows<br> I might be wealthy, if I chose.</p></div>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">But other joys can gold impart;<br> Far other wishes warm my heart;—<br> Ne’er may I strive to swell the heap<br> Till want and woe have ceased to weep.  
 <p>With brow unaltered I can see<br> The hour of wealth or poverty:<br> I've drunk from both the cups of Fate,<br> Nor this could sink, nor that elate.</p>  
 <p>With fortune blest, I ne’er was found<br> To look with scorn on those around;<br> Nor for the loss of paltry ore,<br> Shall Hatem seem to Hatem poor.</p></div>
