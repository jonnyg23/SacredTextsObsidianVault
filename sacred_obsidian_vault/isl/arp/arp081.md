 <p><small>[ABU ALI flourished in Egypt about <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 530, and was equally celebrated as a mathematician and as a poet. In the following odd composition he seems to have united these two discordant characters.]</small></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I NEVER knew a sprightly fair<br>   That was not dear to me;<br> And freely I my heart could share<br>   With every one I see.  
 <p>It is not <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> alone<br>   On whom my choice would fall:<br> I do not more incline to one<br>   Than I incline to all.</p>  
 <p>The circle's bounding line are they;<br>   Its centre is my heart;<br> My ready love, the equal ray<br>   That flows to every part.</p></div>
