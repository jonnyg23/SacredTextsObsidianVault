 <p><small>He had no sooner finished. than Rakeek began, and in the same versification, and to the same air, sung as follows:</small></p>  <h3 align="center">RAKEEK TO HIS FEMALE COMPANIONS.</h3>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">THOUGH the peevish tongues upbraid,<br>   Though the brows of wisdom scowl,<br> Fair ones, here on roses laid,<br>   Careless will we quaff the bowl.  
 <p>Let the cup, with nectar crowned,<br>   Through the grove its beams display;<br> It can shed a lustre round,<br>   Brighter than the torch of Day.</p>  
 <p>Let it pass from hand to hand,<br>   Circling still with ceaseless flight,<br> Till the streaks of gray expand<br>   O’er the fleeting robe of Night.</p>  
 <p>As Night flits, she does but cry.<br>   "Seize the moments that remain":<br> Thus our joys with yours shall vie,<br>   Tenants of yon hallowed fane!</p></div>
