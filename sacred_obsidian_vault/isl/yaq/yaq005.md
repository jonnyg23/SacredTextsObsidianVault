 <p>4. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">5</font></span> They ask thee what is<br> Lawful to them (as food)<br> Say: Lawful unto you<br> Are (all) things good and pure:<br> And what ye have taught<br> Your trained hunting animals<br> (To catch) in the manner<br> Directed to you by God:<br> Eat what they catch for you,<br> But pronounce the name<br> Of God over it: and fear<br> God; for God is swift<br> In taking account.</p>

 <p>And rub therewith<br> Your faces and hands.<br> God doth not wish<br> To place you in a difficulty,<br> But to make you clean,<br> And to complete<br> His favour to you,<br> That ye may be grateful.</p>  
 <p>7. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">8</font></span> And call in remembrance<br> The favour of God<br> Unto you, and His Covenant,<br> Which He ratified<br> With you, when ye said:<br> "We hear and we obey":<br> And fear God, for God<br> Knoweth well<br> The secrets of your hearts.</p>  
 <p>8. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">9</font></span> O ye who believe!<br> Stand out firmly<br> For God, as witnesses<br> To fair dealing, and let not<br> The hatred of others<br> To you make you swerve<br> To wrong and depart from<br> Justice.

 <p>9. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">10</font></span> To those who believe<br> And do deeds of righteousness<br> Hath God promised forgiveness<br> And a great reward.</p>

 <p>10. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">11</font></span> Those who reject faith<br> And deny Our Signs<br> Will be Companions<br> Of Hell-fire.</p>  
 <p>11. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">12</font></span> O ye who believe<br> Call in remembrance<br> The favour of God<br> Unto you when<br> Certain men formed the design<br> To stretch out<br> Their hands against you,<br> But (God) held back<br> Their hands from you:<br> So fear God. And on God<br> Let Believers put<br> (All) their trust.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>12. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">13</font></span> God did aforetime<br> Take a Covenant from<br> The Children of Israel,<br> And We appointed twelve<br> Captains among them.<br> And God said: "I am<br> With you: if ye (but)<br> Establish regular Prayers,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></a></p>  
 <p>Practise regular Charity,<br> Believe in My apostles,<br> Honour and assist them,<br> And loan to God<br> A beautiful loan,<br> Verily I will wipe out<br> From you your evils,<br> And admit you to Gardens<br> With rivers flowing beneath;<br> But if any of you, after this,<br> Resisteth faith, he hath truly<br> Wandered from the path<br> Of rectitude."</p>  
 <p>13. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">14</font></span> But because of their breach<br> Of their Covenant, We<br> Cursed them, and made<br> Their hearts grow hard:<br> They change the words<br> From their (right) places<br> And forget a good part<br> Of the Message that was<br> Sent them, nor wilt thou<br> Cease to find them<br> Barring a few—ever<br> Bent on (new) deceits:<br> But forgive them, and overlook<br> (Their misdeeds): for God<br> Loveth those who are kind.</p>  
 <p>14. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">15</font></span> From those, too, who call<br> Themselves Christians,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>We did take a Covenant,<br> But they forgot a good part<br> Of the Message that was<br> Sent them: so We estranged<br> Them, with enmity and hatred<br> Between the one and the other,<br> To the Day of Judgment.<br> And soon will God show<br> Them what it is<br> They have done.</p>  
 <p>15. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">16</font></span> O People of the Book!<br> There hath come to you<br> Our Apostle, revealing<br> To you much that ye<br> Used to hide in the Book,<br> And passing over much<br> (That is now unnecessary):<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">17</font></span> There hath come to you<br> From God a (new) light<br> And a perspicuous Book,—</p>  
 <p>16. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">18</font></span> Wherewith God guideth all<br> Who seek His good pleasure<br> To ways of peace and safety,<br> And leadeth them out<br> Of darkness, by His Will,<br> Unto the light,—guideth them<br> To a Path that is Straight.</p>  
 <p>17. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">19</font></span> In blasphemy indeed<br> Are those that say<br> That God is Christ<br> The son of Mary.<br> Say: "Who then<br> Hath the least power</p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="green">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>Against God, if His Will<br> Were to destroy Christ<br> The son of Mary, his mother,<br> And all—every one<br> That is on the earth?<br> For to God belongeth<br> The dominion of the heavens<br> And the earth, and all<br> That is between. He createth<br> What He pleaseth. For God<br> Hath power over all things."</p>  
 <p>18. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">20</font></span> (Both) the Jews and the Christians<br> Say: "We are sons<br> Of God, and His beloved."<br> Say: "Why then doth He<br> Punish you for your sins?<br> Nay, ye are but men,<br> Of the men He hath created:<br> He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br> And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br> And to God belongeth<br> The dominion of the heavens<br> And the earth, and all<br> That is between:<br> And unto Him<br> Is the final goal (of all)"</p>  
 <p>19. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">21</font></span> O People of the Book!<br> Now hath come unto you,<br> Making (things) clear unto you,<br> Our Apostle, after the break</p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>In (the series of) our apostles,<br> Lest ye should say:<br> "There came unto us<br> No bringer of glad tidings<br> And no warner (from evil)":<br> But now hath come<br> Unto you a bringer<br> Of glad tidings<br> And a warner (from evil).<br> And God hath power<br> Over all things.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>20. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">22</font></span> Remember Moses said<br> To his people: "O my People!<br> Call in remembrance the favour<br> Of God unto you, when He<br> Produced prophets among you,<br> Made you kings, and gave<br> You what He had not given<br> To any other among the peoples.</p>  
 <p>21. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">23</font></span> "O my people! enter<br> The holy land which<br> God hath assigned unto you,<br> And turn not back<br> Ignominiously, for then<br> Will ye be overthrown,<br> To your own ruin."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">24</font></span> They said: "O Moses!<br> In this land are a people<br> Of exceeding strength:<br> Never shall we enter it<br> Until they leave it:<br> If (once) they leave,<br> Then shall we enter."</p>  
 <p>23. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">25</font></span> (But) among (their) God-fearing men<br> Were two on whom<br> God had bestowed His grace:<br> They said: "Assault them<br> At the (proper) Gate:<br> When once ye are in,<br> Victory will be yours;<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">26</font></span> But on God put your trust<br> If ye have faith."</p>  
 <p>24. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">27</font></span> They said: "O Moses!<br> While they remain there,<br> Never shall we be able<br> To enter, to the end of time.<br> Go thou, and thy Lord,<br> And fight ye two,<br> While we sit here"<br> (And watch)."</p>  
 <p>25. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">28</font></span> He said: "O my Lord!<br> I have power only</p>  
 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="green">p. 250</font></a></p>  
 <p>Over myself and my brother:<br> So separate us from this<br> Rebellious people!"</p>  
 <p>26. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">29</font></span> God said: "Therefore<br> Will the land be out<br> Of their reach for forty years:<br> In distraction will they<br> Wander through the land:<br> But sorrow thou not<br> Over these rebellious people.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>27. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">30</font></span> Recite to them the truth<br> Of the story of the two sons</p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="green">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>Of Adam. Behold! they each<br> Presented a sacrifice (to God):<br> It was accepted from one,<br> But not from the other.<br> Said the latter: "Be sure<br> I will slay thee." "Surely,"<br> Said the former, "God<br> Doth accept of the sacrifice<br> Of those who are righteous.</p>  
 <p>28. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">31</font></span>"If thou dost stretch thy hand<br> Against me, to slay me,<br> It is not for me to stretch<br> My hand against thee<br> To slay thee: for I do fear<br> God, the Cherisher of the Worlds.</p>  
 <p>29. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">32</font></span> "For me, I intend to let<br> Thee draw on thyself<br> My sin as well as thine,<br> For thou wilt be among<br> The Companions of the Fire,<br> And that is the reward<br> Of those who do wrong."</p>  
 <p>30. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">33</font></span> The (selfish) soul of the other<br> Led him to the murder<br> Of his brother: he murdered<br> Him, and became (himself)<br> One of the lost ones.</p>  
 <p>31. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">34</font></span> Then God sent a raven,<br> Who scratched the ground,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>To show him how to hide<br> The shame of his brother.<br> "Woe is me!" said he;<br> "Was I not even able<br> To be as this raven,<br> And to hide the shame<br> Of my brother?" Then he became<br> Full of regrets—</p>  
 <p>32. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">35</font></span> On that account: We ordained<br> For the Children of Israel<br> That if any one slew<br> A person—unless it be<br> For murder or for spreading<br> Mischief in the land—<br> It would be as if<br> He slew the whole people:<br> And if any one saved a life,<br> It would be as if he saved<br> The life of the whole people.<br> Then although there came<br> To them Our Apostles<br> With Clear Signs, yet,<br> Even after that, many<br> Of them continued to commit<br> Excesses in the land.</p>  
 <p>33. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">36</font></span> The punishment of those<br> Who wage war against God<br> And His Apostle, and strive<br> With might and main<br> For mischief through the land<br> Is: execution, or crucifixion,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or the cutting off of hands<br> And feet from opposite sides,<br> Or exile from the land:<br> That is their disgrace<br> In this world, and<br> A heavy punishment is theirs<br> In the Hereafter;</p>  
 <p>34. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">37</font></span> Except for those who repent<br> Before they fall<br> Into your power:<br> In that case, know<br> That God is Oft-forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
 <p>35. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">38</font></span> O ye who believe!<br> Do your duty to God,<br> Seek the means<br> Of approach unto Him,<br> And strive with might<br> And main in His cause:<br> That ye may presper.</p>  
 <p>36. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">39</font></span> As to those who reject<br> Faith,—if they had<br> Everything on earth,<br> And twice repeated,<br> To give as ransom<br> For the penalty of the Day<br> Of Judgment, it would<br> Never be accepted of them.<br> Theirs would be<br> A grievous Penalty.</p>  
 <p>37. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">40</font></span> Their wish will be<br> To get out of the Fire,<br> But never will they<br> Get out therefrom:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></a></p>  
 <p>Their Penalty will be<br> One that endures.</p>  
 <p>38. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">41</font></span> As to the thief,<br> Male or female,<br> Cut off his or her hands:<br> A punishment by way<br> Of example, from God,<br> For their crime:<br> And God is Exalted in Power.</p>  
 <p>39. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">42</font></span> But if the thief repent<br> After his crime,<br> And amend his conduct,<br> God turneth to him<br> In forgiveness; for God<br> Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>40. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">43</font></span> Knowest thou not<br> That to God (alone)<br> Belongeth the dominion<br> Of the heavens and the earth?<br> He punisheth whom He pleaseth,<br> And He forgiveth whom He pleaseth:<br> And God hath power<br> Over all things.</p>  
 <p>41. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">44</font></span> O Apostle! let not<br> Those grieve thee, who race<br> Each other into Unbelief:<br> (Whether it be) among those<br> Who say "We believe"<br> With their lips but<br> Whose hearts have no faith;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or it be among the Jews,—<br> Men who will listen<br> To any lie,—will listen<br> Even to others who have<br> Never so much as come<br> To thee. They change the words<br> From their (right) times<br> And places; they say,<br> "If ye are given this,<br> Take it, but if not,<br> Beware!" If any one's trial<br> Is intended by God, thou hast<br> No authority in the least<br> For him against God.<br> For such—it is not<br> God's will to purify<br> Their hearts. For them<br> There is disgrace<br> In this world, and<br> In the Hereafter<br> A heavy punishment.</p>  
 <p>42. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">45</font></span> (They are fond of) listening<br> To falsehood, of devouring<br> Anything forbidden.<br> If they do come to thee,<br> Either judge between them,<br> Or decline to interfere.<br> If thou decline, they cannot<br> Hurt thee in the least.<br> If thou judge, judge<br> In equity between them.<br> For God loveth those<br> Who judge in equity.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>43. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">46</font></span> But why do they come<br> To thee for decision,<br> When they have (their own)<br> Law before them?<br> Therein is the (plain)<br> Command of God; yet<br> Even after that, they would<br> Turn away. For they<br> Are not (really)<br> People of Faith.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
 <p>44. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">47</font></span> It was We who revealed<br> The Law (to Moses): therein<br> Was guidance and light.'<br> By its standard have been judged<br> The Jews, by the Prophets<br> Who bowed (as in Islam)<br> To God's Will, by the Rabbis<br> And the Doctors of Law:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></a></p>  
 <p>For to them was entrusted<br> The protection of God's Book,<br> And they were witnesses thereto:<br> Therefore fear not men,<br> But fear Me, and sell not<br> My Signs for a miserable price.<br> If any do fail to judge<br> By (the light of) what God<br> Hath revealed, they are<br> (No better than) Unbelievers.</p>  
 <p>45. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">48</font></span> We ordained therein for them:<br> "Life for life, eye for eye,<br> Nose for nose, ear for ear,<br> Tooth for tooth, and wounds<br> Equal for equal." But if<br> Any one remits the retaliation<br> Byway of charity, it is<br> An act of atonement for himself.<br> And if any fail to judge<br> By (the light of) what God<br> Hath revealed, they are<br> (No better than) wrong-doers.</p>  
 <p>46. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">49</font></span> And in their footsteps<br> We sent Jesus the son</p>  
 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></a></p>  
 <p>Of Mary, confirming<br> The Law that had come<br> Before him: We sent him<br> The Gospel: therein<br> Was guidance and light,<br> And confirmation of the Law<br> That had come before him:<br> A guidance and an admonition<br> To those who fear God.</p>  
 <p>47. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">50</font></span> Let the People of the Gospel<br> Judge by what God hath revealed<br> Therein. If any do fail<br> To judge by (the light of)<br> What God hath revealed,<br> They are (no better than)<br> Those who rebel.</p>  
 <p>48. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">51</font></span> To thee We sent the Scripture<br> In truth, confirming<br> The scripture that came<br> Before it, and guarding it's<br> In safety: so judge<br> Between them by what<br> God hath revealed,<br> And follow not their vain<br> Desires, diverging<br> From the Truth that hath come<br> To thee. To each among you<br> Have We prescribed a Law<br> And an Open Way.<br> If God had so willed.<br> He would have made you<br> A single People, but (His</p>  
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></a></p>  
 <p>Plan is) to test you in what<br> He hath given you: so strive<br> As in a race in all virtues.<br> The goal of you all is to God;<br> It is He that will show you<br> The truth of the matters<br> In which ye dispute;</p>
