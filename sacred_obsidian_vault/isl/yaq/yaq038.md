 <p><a name="page_1217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1217</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra XXXVIII.</h3>  <h3 align="center">Ṣād (being one of the Abbreviated Letters).</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. Ṣād:</p>  
 <p>By the Qur-ān,<br> Full of Admonition:<br> (This is the Truth).</p>  
 <p>2. But the Unbelievers<br> (Are steeped) in Self-glory<br> And Separatism.</p>  
 <p>3. How many generations<br> Before them did We destroy?<br> In the end they cried<br> (For mercy)—when<br> There was no longer time<br> For being saved!</p>  
 <p>4. So they wonder<br> That a Warner has come</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1218</font></a></p>  
 <p>To them from among themselves!<br> And the Unbelievers say,<br> "This is a sorcerer<br> Telling lies!</p>  
 <p>5. "Has he made the gods<br> (All) into one God?<br> Truly this is<br> A wonderful thing!"</p>  
 <p>6. And the leaders among them<br> Go away (impatiently), (saying),<br> "Walk ye away, and remain<br> Constant to your gods!<br> For this is truly<br> A thing designed (against you)!</p>  
 <p>7. "We never heard (the like)<br> Of this among the people<br> Of these latter days:<br> This is nothing but<br> A made-up tale!"</p>  
 <p>8. "What! Has the Message<br> Been sent to him—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1219</font></a></p>  
 <p>(Of all persons) among us?"…<br> But they are in doubt<br> Concerning My (own) Message!<br> Nay, they have not yet<br> Tasted My Punishment!</p>  
 <p>9. Or have they the Treasures<br> Of the Mercy of thy Lord,—<br> The Exalted in Power,<br> The Grantor of Bounties<br> Without measure?</p>  
 <p>10. Or have they the dominion<br> Of the heavens and the earth<br> And all between? If so,<br> Let them mount up<br> With the ropes and means<br> (To reach that end)!</p>  
 <p>11. But there—will be<br> Put to flight even a host<br> Of confederates.</p>  
 <p>12. Before them (were many<br> Who) rejected apostles,—<br> The People of Noah,<br> And ‘Ād, and Pharaoh<br> The Lord of Stakes,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1220</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. And <u>Th</u>amūd, and the People<br> Of Lūṭ, and the Companions<br> Of the Wood;—such were<br> The Confederates.</p>  
 <p>14. Not one (of them) but<br> Rejected the apostles,<br> But My Punishment<br> Came justly and inevitably<br> (On them).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>15. These (to-day) only wait<br> For a single mighty Blast,<br> Which (when it comes)<br> Will brook no delay.</p>  
 <p>16. They say: "Our Lord!<br> Hasten to us our sentence<br> (Even) before the Day<br> Of Account!"</p>  
 <p>17. Have patience at what they<br> Say, and remember Our Servant<br> David, the man of strength:<br> For he ever turned (to God).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1221</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. It was We that made<br> The hills declare,<br> In unison with him,<br> Our Praises, at eventide<br> And at break of day,</p>  
 <p>19. And the birds gathered<br> (In assemblies): all with him<br> Did turn (to God).</p>  
 <p>20. We strengthened his kingdom,<br> And gave him wisdom<br> And sound judgment<br> In speech and decision.</p>  
 <p>21. Has the Story of<br> The Disputants reached thee?<br> Behold, they climbed over<br> The wall of the private chamber;</p>  
 <p>22. When they entered<br> The presence of David,<br> And he was terrified<br> Of them, they said:<br> "Fear not: we are two<br> Disputants, one of whom<br> Has wronged the other:<br> Decide now between us<br> With truth, and treat us not<br> With unjustice, but guide us<br> To the even Path.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1222</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. "This man is my brother:<br> He has nine and ninety<br> Ewes, and I have (but) one:<br> Yet he says, "Commit her<br> To my care," and is (moreover)<br> Harsh to me in speech."</p>  
 <p>24. (David) said: "He has<br> Undoubtedly wronged thee<br> In demanding thy (single) ewe<br> To be added to his (flock<br> Of) ewes: truly many<br> Are the Partners (in business)<br> Who wrong each other:<br> Not so do those who believe<br> And work deeds of righteousness,<br> And how few are they?"…<br> And David gathered that we<br> Had tried him: he asked<br> Forgiveness of his Lord,<br> Fell down, bowing<br> (In prostration), and turned<br> (To God in repentance).</p>  
 <p>25. So We forgave him<br> This (lapse): he enjoyed,<br> Indeed, a Near Approach to Us,<br> And a beautiful Place<br> Of (final) Return.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1223</font></a></p>  
 <p>26, O David! We did indeed<br> Make thee a vicegerent<br> On earth: so judge thou<br> Between men in truth (and justice):<br> Nor follow thou the lusts<br> (Of thy heart), for they will<br> Mislead thee from the Path<br> Of God: for those who<br> Wander astray from the Path<br> Of God, is a Penalty Grievous,<br> For that they forget<br> The Day of <a href="errata.htm#7">Account</a>.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>27. Not without purpose did We<br> Create heaven and earth<br> And all between! That<br> Were the thought of Unbelievers!<br> But woe to the Unbelievers<br> Because of the Fire (of Hell)!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1224</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. Shall We treat those<br> Who believe and work deeds<br> Of righteousness, the same<br> As those who do mischief<br> On earth? Shall We treat<br> Those who guard against evil,<br> The same as those who<br> Turn aside from the right?</p>  
 <p>29. (Here is) a Book which<br> We have sent down<br> Unto thee, full of blessings,<br> That they may meditate<br> On its Signs, and that<br> Men of understanding may<br> Receive admonition.</p>  
 <p>30. To David We gave<br> Solomon (for a son),—<br> How excellent in Our service!<br> Ever did he turn (to Us)!</p>  
 <p>31. Behold, there were brought<br> Before him, at eventide,<br> Coursers of the highest breeding,<br> And swift of foot;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1225</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. And he said, "Truly<br> Do I love the love<br> Of Good, with a view<br> To the glory of my Lord,"—<br> Until (the sun) was hidden<br> In the veil (of Night):</p>  
 <p>33. "Bring them back to me."<br> Then began he to pass<br> His hand over (their) legs<br> And their necks.</p>  
 <p>34. And We did try<br> Solomon: We placed<br> On his throne a body<br> (Without life): but he did turn<br> (To Us in true devotion):</p>  
 <p>35. He said, "O my Lord!<br> Forgive me, and grant me</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1226</font></a></p>  
 <p>A Kingdom which,<br> (It may be), suits not<br> Another after me:<br> For Thou art the Grantor<br> Of Bounties (without measure).</p>  
 <p>36. Then We subjected the Wind<br> To his power, to flow<br> Gently to his order,<br> Whithersoever he willed,—</p>  
 <p>37. As also the evil ones,<br> (Including) every kind<br> Of builder and diver,—</p>  
 <p>38. As also others bound<br> Together in fetters.</p>  
 <p>39. "Such are Our Bounties:<br> Whether thou bestow them<br> (On others) or withhold them,<br> No account will be asked."</p>  
 <p>40. And he enjoyed, indeed,<br> A Near Approach to Us,<br> And a beautiful Place<br> Of (final) Return.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>41. Commemorate Our Servant Job.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1227</font></a></p>  
 <p>Behold he cried to his Lord:<br> "The Evil One has afflicted<br> Me with distress and suffering!"</p>  
 <p>42. (The command was given:)<br> "Strike with thy foot:<br> Here is (water) wherein<br> To wash, coal and refreshing,<br> And (water) to drink."</p>  
 <p>43. And We gave him (back)<br> His people, and doubled<br> Their number,—as a Grace<br> From Ourselves, and a thing<br> For commemoration, for all<br> Who have Understanding.</p>  
 <p>44. "And take in thy hand<br> A little grass, and strike<br> Therewith: and break not<br> (Thy oath)." Truly We found<br> Him full of patience and constancy.<br> How excellent in Our service!<br> Ever did he turn (to Us)!</p>  
 <p>45. And commemorate Our Servants<br> Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,<br> Possessors of Power and Vision.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1228"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1228</font></a></p>  
 <p>46. Verily We did choose them<br> For a special (purpose)—<br> Proclaiming the Message<br> Of the Hereafter.</p>  
 <p>47. They were, in Our sight,<br> Truly, of the company<br> Of the Elect and the Good.</p>  
 <p>48. And commemorate Ismā‘īl,<br> Elisha, and Ẓul-Kifl:<br> Each of them was<br> Of the company of the Good.</p>  
 <p>49. This is a Message<br> (Of admonition): and verily,<br> For the Righteous,<br> Is a beautiful place<br> Of (final) Return,—</p>  
 <p>50. Gardens of Eternity,<br> Whose doors will (ever)<br> Be open to them;</p>  
 <p>51. Therein will they<br> Recline (at ease);<br> Therein can they<br> Call (at pleasure)<br> For fruit in abundance,<br> And (delicious) drink;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1229"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1229</font></a></p>  
 <p>52. And beside them will be<br> Chaste women restraining<br> Their glances, (companions)<br> Of equal age.</p>  
 <p>53. Such is the Promise<br> Made to you<br> For the Day of Account!</p>  
 <p>54. Truly such will be<br> Our Bounty (to you);<br> It will never fail;—</p>  
 <p>55. ''Yea, such! But<br> For the wrong-doers<br> Will be an evil place<br> Of (final) Return!—</p>  
 <p>56. Hell!—they will burn<br> Therein,—an evil bed<br> (Indeed, to lie on)!—</p>  
 <p>57. Yea, such!—Then<br> Shall they taste it,<br> A boiling fluid, and a fluid<br> Dark, murky, intensely cold!—</p>  
 <p>58. And other Penalties<br> Of a similar kind,<br> To match them!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1230</font></a></p>  
 <p>59. Here is a troop<br> Rushing headlong with you!<br> No welcome for them!<br> Truly, they shall burn<br> In the Fire!</p>  
 <p>60. (The followers shall cry<br> To the misleaders:)<br> "Nay, ye (too)! No welcome<br> For you! It is ye who<br> Have brought this upon us!<br> Now evil is (this) place<br> To stay in!"</p>  
 <p>61. They will say: "Our Lord!<br> Whoever brought this upon us,—<br> Add to him a double<br> Penalty in the Fire!"</p>  
 <p>62. And they will say:<br> "What has happened to us<br> That we see not men<br> Whom we used to number<br> Among the bad ones?</p>  
 <p>63. "Did we treat them<br> (As such) in ridicule,<br> Or have (our) eyes<br> Failed to perceive them?"</p>  
 <p>64. Truly that is just and fitting,—<br> The mutual recriminations<br> Of the People of the Fire!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1231"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1231</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>65. Say: "Truly am I<br> A Warner: no god<br> Is there but the One<br> God, Supreme and Irresistible,—</p>  
 <p>66. "The Lord of the heavens<br> And the earth, and all<br> Between,—Exalted in Might,<br> Able to enforce His Will,<br> Forgiving again and again."</p>  
 <p>67. Say: "That is a Message<br> Supreme (above all),—</p>  
 <p>68. "From which ye<br> Do turn away!</p>  
 <p>69. "No knowledge have I<br> Of the Chiefs on high,<br> When they discuss<br> (Matters) among themselves.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1232"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1232</font></a></p>  
 <p>70. "Only this has been revealed<br> To me: that I am<br> To give warning<br> Plainly and publicly."</p>  
 <p>71. Behold, thy Lord said<br> To the angels: "I am<br> About to create man<br> From clay:</p>  
 <p>72. "When I have fashioned him<br> (In due proportion) and breathed<br> Into him of My spirit,<br> Fall ye down in obeisance<br> Unto him."</p>  
 <p>73. So the angels prostrated themselves,<br> All of them together:</p>  
 <p>74. Not so Iblīs: he<br> Was haughty, and became<br> One of those who reject Faith.</p>  
 <p>75. (God) said: "O Iblīs!<br> What prevents thee from<br> Prostrating thyself to one<br> Whom I have created<br> With My hands?<br> Art thou haughty?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1233</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or art thou one<br> Of the high (and mighty) ones?"</p>  
 <p>76. (Iblīs) said: "I am better<br> Than he: Thou createdst<br> Me from fire, and him<br> Thou createdst from clay."</p>  
 <p>77. (God) said: "Then get thee<br> Out from here: for thou<br> Art rejected, accursed.</p>  
 <p>78. "And My Curse shall be<br> On thee till the Day<br> Of Judgment."</p>  
 <p>79. (Iblīs) said: "O my Lord!<br> Give me then respite<br> Till the Day<br> The (dead) are raised."</p>  
 <p>80. (God) said: "Respite then<br> Is granted thee—</p>  
 <p>81. "Till the Day<br> Of the Time Appointed."</p>  
 <p>82. (Iblīs) said: "Then,<br> By Thy Power, I will<br> Put them all in the wrong,—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1234</font></a></p>  
 <p>83. "Except Thy Servants<br> Amongst them, sincere<br> And purified (by Thy grace)."</p>  
 <p>84. (God) said: "Then<br> It is just and fitting—<br> And I say what is<br> Just and fitting—</p>  
 <p>85. "That I will certainly fill<br> Hell with thee<br> And those that follow thee,—<br> Every one."</p>  
 <p>86. Say: "No reward do I ask<br> Of you for this (Qur-ān),<br> Nor am I a pretender.</p>  
 <p>87. "This is no less than<br> A Message to (all)<br> The Worlds.</p>  
 <p>88. "And ye shall certainly<br> Know the truth of it (all)<br> After a while."</p>
