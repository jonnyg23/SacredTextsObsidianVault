 <p><a name="page_1585"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1585</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra LXVIII.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Qalam,</i> or the Pen, or <i>Nūn</i>.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. <i>Nūn.</i> By the Pen<br> And by the (Record)<br> Which (men) write,—</p>  
 <p>2. Thou art not,<br> By the grace of thy Lord,<br> Mad or possessed.</p>  
 <p>3. Nay, verily for thee<br> Is a Reward unfailing:</p>  
 <p>4. And thou (standest)<br> On an exalted standard<br> Of character.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1586"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1586</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. Soon wilt thou see,<br> And they will see,</p>  
 <p>6. Which of you is<br> Afflicted with madness.</p>  
 <p>7. Verily it is thy Lord<br> That knoweth best,<br> Which (among men)<br> Hath strayed from His Path:<br> And He knoweth best<br> Those who receive<br> (True) Guidance.</p>  
 <p>8. So hearken not<br> To those who<br> Deny (the Truth),</p>  
 <p>9. Their desire is that<br> Thou shouldst be pliant:<br> So would they be pliant.</p>  
 <p>10. Heed not the type<br> Of despicable man,—<br> Ready with oaths,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1587"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1587</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. A slanderer, going about<br> With calumnies,</p>  
 <p>12. (Habitually) hindering (all) good,<br> Transgressing beyond bounds,<br> Deep in sin,</p>  
 <p>13. Violent (and cruel),—<br> With all that, base-born,—</p>  
 <p>14. Because he possesses<br> Wealth and (numerous) sons.</p>  
 <p>15. When to him are rehearsed<br> Our Signs,<br> "Tales of the Ancients",<br> He cries!</p>  
 <p>16. Soon shall We brand<br> (The beast) on the snout!</p>  
 <p>17. Verily We have tried them<br> As We tried the People</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1588"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1588</font></a></p>  
 <p>Of the Garden,<br> When they resolved to gather<br> The fruits of the (garden)<br> In the morning,</p>  
 <p>18. But made no reservation,<br> ("If it be God's Will").</p>  
 <p>19. Then there came<br> On the (garden)<br> A visitation from thy Lord,<br> (Which swept away) all around,<br> While they were asleep.</p>  
 <p>20. So the (garden) became,<br> By the morning, like<br> A dark and desolate spot,<br> (Whose fruit had been gathered).</p>  
 <p>21. As the morning broke,<br> They called out,<br> One to another,—</p>  
 <p>22. "Go ye to your tilth<br> (Betimes) in the morning,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1589"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1589</font></a></p>  
 <p>If ye would gather<br> The fruits."</p>  
 <p>23. So they departed, conversing<br> In secret low tones, (saying)—</p>  
 <p>24. "Let not a single indigent<br> Person break in upon you<br> Into the (garden) this day."</p>  
 <p>25. And they opened the morning,<br> Strong in an (unjust) resolve.</p>  
 <p>26. But when they saw<br> The (garden), they said:<br> "We have surely lost our way:</p>  
 <p>27. "Indeed we are shut out<br> (Of the fruits of our labour)!"</p>  
 <p>28. Said one of them,<br> More just (than the rest):<br> "Did I not say to you,<br> "Why not glorify (God)?"</p>  
 <p>29. They said: "Glory<br> To our Lord! Verily we<br> Have been doing wrong!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1590"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1590</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. Then they turned, one<br> Against another, in reproach.</p>  
 <p>31. They said: "Alas for us!<br> We have indeed transgressed!</p>  
 <p>32. "It may be that our Lord<br> Will give us in exchange<br> A better (garden) than this:<br> For we do turn to Him<br> (In repentance)!"</p>  
 <p>33. Such is the Punishment<br> (In this life); but greater<br> Is the Punishment<br> In the Hereafter,—<br> If only they knew!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1591"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1591</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>34. Verily, for the Righteous,<br> Are Gardens of Delight,<br> In the Presence<br> Of their Lord.</p>  
 <p>35. Shall We then treat<br> The People of Faith<br> Like the People of Sin?</p>  
 <p>36. What is the matter<br> With you? How judge ye?</p>  
 <p>37. Or have ye a Book<br> Through which ye learn—</p>  
 <p>38. That ye shall have,<br> Through it whatever<br> Ye choose?</p>  
 <p>39. Or have ye Covenants<br> With Us on oath,<br> Reaching to the Day<br> Of Judgment, (providing)<br> That ye shall have<br> Whatever ye shall demand?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1592"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1592</font></a></p>  
 <p>40. Ask thou of them,<br> Which of them will stand<br> Surety for that!</p>  
 <p>41. Or have they some<br> "Partners" (in Godhead)?<br> Then let them produce<br> Their "partners",<br> If they are truthful!</p>  
 <p>42. The Day that the Shin<br> Shall be laid bare,<br> And they shall be summoned<br> To bow in adoration,<br> But they shall not be able,—</p>  
 <p>43. Their eyes will be<br> Cast down,—ignominy will<br> Cover them; seeing that<br> They had been summoned<br> Aforetime to bow in adoration,<br> While they were whole,<br> (And had refused).</p>  
 <p>44. Then leave Me alone<br> With such as reject<br> This Message: by degrees<br> Shall We punish them</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1593"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1593</font></a></p>  
 <p>From directions they perceive not.</p>  
 <p>45. A (long) respite will I<br> Grant them: truly<br> Powerful is My Plan.</p>  
 <p>46. Or is it that thou dost<br> Ask them for a reward,<br> So that they are burdened<br> With a load of debt?—</p>  
 <p>47. Or that the Unseen<br> Is in their hands, so that<br> They can write it down?</p>  
 <p>48. So wait with patience<br> For the Command<br> Of thy Lord, and be not<br> Like the Companion<br> Of the Fish,—when he<br> Cried out in agony.</p>  
 <p>49. Had not Grace<br> From His Lord<br> Reached him, he<br> Would indeed have been</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1594"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1594</font></a></p>  
 <p>Cast off on the naked<br> Shore, in disgrace.</p>  
 <p>50. Thus did his Lord<br> Choose him and make him<br> Of the company<br> Of the Righteous.</p>  
 <p>51. And the Unbelievers<br> Would almost trip thee up<br> With their eyes when they<br> Hear the Message; and they<br> Say: "Surely he is possessed!"</p>  
 <p>52. But it is nothing less<br> Than a Message<br> To all the worlds.</p>
