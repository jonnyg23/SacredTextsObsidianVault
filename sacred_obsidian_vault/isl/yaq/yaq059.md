 <p><a name="page_1520"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1520</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra LIX.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Ḥa<u>sh</u>r,</i> or The Gathering</h3>  <h6 align="center">(or Banishment, lix. 2-3).</h6>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. Whatever is<br> In the heavens and<br> On earth, let it declare<br> The Praises and Glory<br> Of God: for He is<br> The Exalted in Might,<br> The Wise.</p>  
 <p>2. It is He Who got out<br> The Unbelievers among<br> The People of the Book<br> From their homes<br> At the first gathering<br> (Of the forces).<br> Little did ye think<br> That they would get out:<br> And they thought<br> That their fortresses<br> Would defend them from God!<br> But the (Wrath of) God</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1521"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1521</font></a></p>  
 <p>Came to them from quarters<br> From which they little<br> Expected (it), and cast<br> Terror into their hearts,<br> So that they destroyed<br> Their dwellings by their own<br> Hands and the hands<br> Of the Believers.<br> Take warning, then,<br> O ye with eyes (to see)!</p>  
 <p>3. And had it not been<br> That God had decreed<br> Banishment for them,<br> He would certainly have<br> Punished them in this world:<br> And in the Hereafter<br> They shall (certainly) have<br> The Punishment of the Fire.</p>  
 <p>4. That is because they<br> Resisted God and His Apostle:<br> And if any one resists God,<br> Verily God is severe<br> In Punishment.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1522"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1522</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. Whether ye cut down<br> (O ye Muslims!)<br> The tender palm-trees,<br> Or ye left them standing<br> On their roots, it was<br> By leave of God, and<br> In order that He might<br> Cover with shame<br> The rebellious transgressors.</p>  
 <p>6. What God has bestowed<br> On His Apostle (and taken<br> Away) from them—for this<br> Ye made no expedition<br> With either cavalry or camelry:<br> But God gives power<br> To His apostles over<br> Any He pleases: and God<br> Has power over all things.</p>  
 <p>7. What God has bestowed<br> On His Apostle (and taken<br> Away) from the people<br> Of the townships,—belongs</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1523"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1523</font></a></p>  
 <p>To God,—to His Apostle<br> And to kindred and orphans,<br> The needy and the wayfarer;<br> In order that it may not<br> (Merely) make a circuit<br> Between the wealthy among you.<br> So take what the Apostle<br> Assigns to you, and deny<br> Yourselves that which he<br> Withholds from you.<br> And fear God; for God<br> Is strict in Punishment.</p>  
 <p>8. (Some part is due)<br> To the indigent Muhājirs,<br> Those who were expelled<br> From their homes and their property,<br> While seeking Grace from God<br> And (His) Good Pleasure,<br> And aiding God and His Apostle:<br> Such are indeed<br> The sincere ones;—</p>  
 <p>9. But those who<br> Before them, had homes<br> (In Medina)<br> And had adopted the Faith,—<br> Show their affection to such<br> As came to them for refuge,<br> And entertain no desire<br> In their hearts for things</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1524"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1524</font></a></p>  
 <p>Given to the (latter),<br> But give them preference<br> Over themselves, even though<br> Poverty was their (own lot).<br> And those saved from<br> The covetousness of their own<br> Souls,—they are the ones<br> That achieve prosperity.</p>  
 <p>10. And those who came<br> After them say: "Our Lord!<br> Forgive us, and our brethren<br> Who came before us<br> Into the Faith,<br> And leave not,<br> In our hearts,<br> Rancour (or sense of injury)<br> Against those who have believed.<br> Our Lord! Thou art<br> Indeed Full of Kindness,<br> Most Merciful."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>11. Hast thou not observed<br> The Hypocrites say<br> To their misbelieving brethren<br> Among the People of the Book?—<br> "If ye are expelled,<br> We too will go out<br> With you, and we will<br> Never hearken, to any one<br> In your affair; and if<br> Ye are attacked (in fight)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1525"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1525</font></a></p>  
 <p>We will help you".<br> But God is witness<br> That they are indeed liars.</p>  
 <p>12. If they are expelled,<br> Never will they go out<br> With them; and if they<br> Are attacked (in fight),<br> They will never help them;<br> And if they do help them,<br> They will turn their backs;<br> So they will receive no help.</p>  
 <p>13. Of a truth ye are<br> Stronger (than they)<br> Because of the terror<br> In their hearts,<br> (Sent) by God.<br> This is because they are<br> Men devoid of understanding.</p>  
 <p>14. They will not fight you<br> (Even) together, except<br> In fortified townships,<br> Or from behind walls.<br> Strong is their fighting (spirit)<br> Amongst themselves:<br> Thou wouldst think<br> They were united,<br> But their hearts are divided:<br> That is because they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1526"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1526</font></a></p>  
 <p>Are a people devoid<br> Of wisdom.</p>  
 <p>15. Like those who lately<br> Preceded them, they have<br> Tasted the evil result<br> Of their conduct; and<br> (In the Hereafter there is)<br> For them a grievous Penalty;—</p>  
 <p>16. (Their allies deceived them),<br> Like the Evil One,<br> When he says to man,<br> "Deny God": but when<br> (Man) denies God,<br> (The Evil One) says,<br> "I am free of thee:<br> I do fear God,<br> The Lord of the Worlds!"</p>  
 <p>17. The end of both will be<br> That they will go<br> Into the Fire, dwelling<br> Therein for ever.<br> Such is the reward<br> Of the wrong-doers.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>18. O ye who believe!<br> Fear God,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1527"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1527</font></a></p>  
 <p>And let every soul look<br> To what (provision) he has<br> Sent forth for the morrow.<br> Yea, fear God:<br> For God is well-acquainted<br> With (all) that ye do.</p>  
 <p>19. And be ye not like<br> Those who forgot God;<br> And He made them forget<br> Their own souls! Such<br> Are the rebellious transgressors!</p>  
 <p>20. Not equal are<br> The Companions of the Fire<br> And the Companions<br> Of the Garden:<br> It is the Companions<br> Of the Garden,<br> That will achieve Felicity.</p>  
 <p>21. Had We sent down<br> This Qur-ān on a mountain,<br> Verily, thou wouldst have seen<br> It humble itself and cleave</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1528"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1528</font></a></p>  
 <p>Asunder for fear of God.<br> Such are the similitudes<br> Which We propound to men,<br> That they may reflect.</p>  
 <p>22. God is He, than Whom<br> There is no other god;—<br> Who knows (all things)<br> Both secret and open;<br> He, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>23. God is He, than Whom<br> There is no other god;—<br> The Sovereign, the Holy One,<br> The Source of Peace<br> (and Perfection),<br> The Guardian of Faith,<br> The Preserver of Safety,<br> The Exalted in Might,<br> The Irresistible, the Supreme:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1529"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1529</font></a></p>  
 <p>Glory to God!<br> (High is He)<br> Above the partners<br> They attribute to Him.</p>  
 <p>24. He is God, the Creator,<br> The Evolver,<br> The Bestower of Forms<br> (Or Colours).<br> To Him belongs<br> The Most Beautiful Names:<br> Whatever is in<br> The heavens and on earth,<br> Doth declare<br> His Praises and Glory:<br> And He is the Exalted<br> In Might, the Wise.</p>
