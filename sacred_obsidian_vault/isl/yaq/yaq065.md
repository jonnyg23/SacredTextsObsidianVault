 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. O Prophet! When ye<br> Do divorce women,<br> Divorce them at their<br> Prescribed periods,<br> And count (accurately)<br> Their prescribed periods:<br> And fear God your Lord:<br> And turn them not out<br> Of their houses, nor shall<br> They (themselves) leave,<br> Except in case they are<br> Guilty of some open lewdness,<br> Those are limits<br> Set by God: and any<br> Who transgresses the limits<br> Of God, does verily<br> Wrong his (own) soul:<br> Thou knowest not if</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1563"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1563</font></a></p>  
 <p>Perchance God will<br> Bring about thereafter<br> Some new situation.</p>  
 <p>2. Thus when they fulfil<br> Their term appointed,<br> Either take them back<br> On equitable terms<br> Or part with them<br> On equitable terms;<br> And take for witness<br> Two persons from among you,<br> Endued with justice,<br> And establish the evidence<br> (As) before God. Such<br> Is the admonition given<br> To him who believes<br> In God and the Last Day.<br> And for those who fear<br> God, He (ever) prepares<br> A way out,</p>  
 <p>3. And He provides for him<br> From (sources) he never<br> Could imagine. And if<br> Any one puts his trust<br> In God, sufficient is (God)<br> For him. For God will</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1564"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1564</font></a></p>  
 <p>Surely accomplish His purpose:<br> Verily, for all things<br> Has God appointed<br> A due proportion.</p>  
 <p>4. Such of your women<br> As have passed the age<br> Of monthly courses, for them<br> The prescribed period, if ye<br> Have any doubts, is<br> Three months, and for those<br> Who have no courses<br> (It is the same):<br> For those who carry<br> (Life within their wombs),<br> Their period is until<br> They deliver their burdens:<br> And for those who<br> Fear God, He will<br> Make their path easy.</p>  
 <p>5. That is the Command<br> Of God, which He<br> Has sent down to you:<br> And if any one fears God,<br> He will remove his ills<br> From him, and will enlarge<br> His reward.</p>  
 <p>6. Let the women live<br> (In <i>‘iddat</i>) in the same</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1565"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1565</font></a></p>  
 <p>Style as ye live,<br> According to your means:<br> Annoy them not, so as<br> To restrict them.<br> And if they carry (life<br> In their wombs), then<br> Spend (your substance) on them<br> Until they deliver<br> Their burden: and if<br> They suckle your (offspring),<br> Give them their recompense:<br> And take mutual counsel<br> Together, according to<br> What is just and reasonable.<br> And if ye find yourselves<br> In difficulties, let another<br> Woman suckle (the child)<br> On the (father's) behalf.</p>  
 <p>7. Let the man of means<br> Spend according to<br> His means: and the man<br> Whose resources are restricted,<br> Let him spend according<br> To what God has given him.<br> God puts no burden<br> On any person beyond<br> What He has given him.<br> After a difficulty, God<br> Will soon grant relief.</p>

 <p>8. How many populations<br> That insolently opposed<br> The command of their Lord<br> And of His apostles,<br> Did We not then<br> Call to account,<br> To severe account?<br> And We imposed on them<br> An exemplary Punishment.</p>  
 <p>9. Then did they taste<br> The evil result of<br> Their conduct, and the End<br> Of their conduct<br> Was Perdition.</p>  
 <p>10. God has prepared for them<br> A severe Punishment<br> (In the Hereafter).<br> Therefore fear God,<br> O ye men of understanding—<br> Who have believed!<br> For God hath indeed<br> Sent down to you<br> A Message,—</p>  
 <p>11. An Apostle, who rehearses<br> To you the Signs of God<br> Containing clear explanations,<br> That he may lead forth<br> Those who believe<br> And do righteous deeds</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1567"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1567</font></a></p>  
 <p>From the depths of Darkness<br> Into Light. And those who<br> Believe in God and work<br> Righteousness, He will admit<br> To Gardens beneath which rivers<br> Flow, to dwell therein<br> For ever: God has indeed<br> Granted for them<br> A most excellent provision.</p>  
 <p>12. God is He Who<br> Created seven Firmaments<br> And of the earth<br> A similar number.<br> Through the midst<br> Of them (all) descends<br> His Command: that ye may<br> Know that God has power<br> Over all things, and that<br> God comprehends all things<br> In (His) Knowledge.</p>
