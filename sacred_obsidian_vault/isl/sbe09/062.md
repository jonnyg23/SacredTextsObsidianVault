 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>What is in the heavens and what is in the earth celebrates the praises of God the King, the holy, the mighty, the wise!</p>  
 <p>He it is who sent unto the Gentiles <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">3</font></a> a prophet amongst themselves to recite to them His signs and to purify them, and to teach them the Book and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 283</font></a></p>  
 <p>the wisdom, although they were before in obvious error.</p>  
 <p>And others of them have not yet overtaken them <a name="fr_402"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">1</font></a>; but He is the mighty, the wise!</p>  
 <p>That is God's grace, He gives it to whomsoever He will; for God is Lord of mighty grace.</p>  
 <p>[5] The likeness of those who were charged with the law and then bore it not is as the likeness of an ass bearing books: sorry is the likeness of the people who say God's signs are lies! but God guides not an unjust people.</p>  
 <p>Say, 'O ye who are Jews! if ye pretend that ye are the clients of God, beyond other people; then wish for death if ye do speak the truth!'</p>  
 <p>But they never wish for it, through what their hands have sent before! but God knows the unjust.</p>  
 <p>Say, 'Verily, the death from which ye flee will surely meet you; then shall ye be sent back to Him who knows the unseen and the visible, and He will inform you of that which ye have done''</p>  
 <p>O ye who believe! when the call to prayer is made upon the Congregation Day <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">2</font></a>, then hasten to the remembrance of God, and leave off traffic; that is better for you, if ye did but know!</p>  
 <p>[10] And when prayer is performed, then disperse abroad in the land, and crave of God's grace; and remember God much; haply ye may prosper!</p>  
 <p>But when they see merchandise or sport they flock to it and leave thee standing <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">3</font></a>! Say, 'What is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></a></p>  
 <p>with God is better than sport and than merchandise, for God is the best of providers!'</p>
