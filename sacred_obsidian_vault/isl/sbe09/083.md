 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Qur'ân, part II (Sacred Books of the East volume 9), Palmer edition [1880]; at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">THE CHAPTER OF THOSE WHO GIVE SHORT WEIGHT.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(LXXXIII. Mecca.)</h3>  
 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>Woe to those who give short weight! who when</p>  
 <p><a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="green">p. 324</font></a></p>  
 <p>they measure against others take full measure; but when they measure to them or weigh to them, diminish!</p>  
 <p>Do not these think that they shall be raised again [5] at the mighty day? the day when men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds!</p>  
 <p>Nay, verily, the book of the wicked is in Si<i>g</i><i>g</i>în <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and what shall make thee know what Si<i>g</i><i>g</i>în is?--a book inscribed!</p>  
 <p>[10] Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>Who call the judgment day a lie! but none shall call it a lie except every sinful transgressor, who, when our signs are read to him, says, 'Old folks' tales!'</p>  
 <p>Nay, but that which they have gained has settled upon their hearts.</p>  
 <p>Nay, verily, [15] from their Lord on that day are they veiled; and then, verily, they shall broil in hell; then it shall be said, 'This is what ye once did call a lie!'</p>  
 <p>Nay, verily, the book of the righteous is in ‘Illiyûn <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and what shall make thee know what ‘Illiyûn is?--[20] a book inscribed! those nigh to God shall witness it.</p>  
 <p>Verily, the righteous shall be in pleasure; upon couches shall they gaze; thou mayest recognise in their faces the brightness of pleasure; [25] they shall be given to drink wine that is sealed, whose seal is musk; for that then let the aspirants aspire!</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> --and it shall be tempered with Tasnîm <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--a spring from which those nigh to God shall drink.</p>  
 <p>Verily, those who sin do laugh at those who believe; [30] and when they pass by they wink at one another, and when they return to their family they return ridiculing them; and when they see them they say, 'Verily, these do go astray!'--but they are not sent as guardians over them!</p>  
 <p>But to-day those who believe shall at the misbelievers laugh! [35] Upon couches shall they gaze; are the misbelievers rewarded for what they have done?</p>
