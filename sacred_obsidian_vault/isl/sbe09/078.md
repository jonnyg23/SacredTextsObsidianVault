 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Qur'ân, part II (Sacred Books of the East volume 9), Palmer edition [1880]; at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">THE CHAPTER OF THE INFORMATION.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(LXXVIII. Mecca.)</h3>  
 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>Of what do they ask each other?--Of the mighty information whereon they do dispute <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">1</font></a>? nay, they shall know too well! [5] Again, nay, they shall know too well!</p>  
 <p>Have we not set the earth as a couch, and the mountains as stakes, and created you in pairs, and made your sleep for rest, [10] and made the night a garment, and made the day for livelihood, and built above you seven solid (heavens) and set a burning lamp, and, sent down from the rain-expressing clouds water pouring forth, [15] to bring out</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></a></p>  
 <p>thereby the grain and herb and gardens thickly planted?</p>  
 <p>Verily, the day of decision is an appointed time; and the day when the trumpet shall be blown, and ye shall come in troops, and the heavens shall be opened, and shall be all doors, [20] and the mountains shall be moved, and shall be like a mirage!</p>  
 <p>Verily, hell is an ambuscade; a reward for the outrageous, to tarry therein for ages. They shall not taste therein cool nor drink, [25] but only boiling water and pus;--a fit reward!</p>  
 <p>Verily, they did not hope for the account; but they ever said our signs were lies.</p>  
 <p>Everything have we remembered in a book.</p>  
 <p>[30] 'Then taste, for we will only increase your torment!'</p>  
 <p>Verily, for the pious is a blissful place,--gardens and vineyards, and girls with swelling breasts of the same age as themselves, and a brimming cup; [35] they shall hear therein no folly and no lie;--a reward from thy Lord, a sufficient gift! The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them both,--the Merciful,--they cannot obtain audience of Him!</p>  
 <p>The day when the Spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks, they shall not speak save to whom the Merciful permits, and who speaks aright.</p>  
 <p>That is the true day; and whoso pleases let him take to a resort unto his Lord!</p>  
 <p>[40] Verily, we have warned you of a torment that is nigh: on a day when man shall see what his two hands have sent forward; and the misbeliever shall say, 'Would that I were dust!'</p>
