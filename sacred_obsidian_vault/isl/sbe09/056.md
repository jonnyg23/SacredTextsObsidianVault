 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.<br> When the inevitable <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">1</font></a> happens; none shall call its<br>   happening a lie!--abasing--exalting!<br> When the earth shall quake, quaking! [5] and the<br>   mountains shall crumble, crumbling, and become<br>   like motes dispersed!<br> And ye shall be three sorts;<br> And the fellows of the right hand--what right lucky fellows!<br> And the fellows of the left hand--what unlucky fellows!</p>

[55] and<br>   drink as drinks the thirsty camel.<br> This is their entertainment on the judgment day!<br> We created you, then why do ye not credit?<br> Have ye considered what ye emit?<br> Do we create it, or are we the creators?<br> [60] We have decreed amongst you death; but we<br> are not forestalled from making the likes of you<br> in exchange, or producing you as ye know not of.<br> Ye do know the first production-why then do ye not mind?<br> Have ye considered what ye till?<br> Do ye make it bear seed, or do we make it bear seed?<br> [65] If we pleased we could make it mere grit, so that<br> ye would pause to marvel:<br> 'Verily, we have got into debt <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">1</font></a> and we are excluded <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>
