 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>Say, 'I have been inspired that there listened a company of the <i>g</i>inn <a name="fr_435"></a><a href="#fn_435"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and they said, "We have heard a marvellous Qur’ân that guides to the right direction; and we believe therein, and we join no one with our Lord, for, verily, He--may the majesty of our Lord be exalted!--has taken to Himself neither consort nor son.</p>  
 <p>'"And, verily, a fool among us spake against God wide of the mark!</p>  
 <p>'"[5] And we thought that men and <i>g</i>inn would never speak a lie against God.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></a></p>  
 <p>'"And there are persons amongst men who seek for refuge with persons amongst the <i>g</i>inn <a name="fr_436"></a><a href="#fn_436"><font size="1">1</font></a>; but they increase them in their perverseness. And they thought, as ye thought, that God would not raise up any one from the dead.</p>  
 <p>'"But we touched the heavens and found them filled with a mighty guard and shooting-stars; and we did sit in certain seats thereof to listen; but whoso of us listens now finds a shooting-star for him on guard.</p>  
 <p>'"[10] And, verily, we know not whether evil be meant for those who are in the earth, or if their Lord means right by them.</p>  
 <p>'"And of us are some who are pious, and of us are some who are otherwise: we are in separate bands.</p>  
 <p>'"And we thought that we could not frustrate God in the earth, and could not frustrate Him by flight.</p>  
 <p>'"But, verily, when we heard the guidance we believed therein, and he who believes in his Lord shall fear neither diminution nor loss.</p>  
 <p>'"And, verily, of us are some who are Muslims, and of us some are trespassers; but those of us who are Muslims they strive after right direction; [15] and as for the trespassers they are fuel for hell."'</p>  
 <p>And if they <a name="fr_437"></a><a href="#fn_437"><font size="1">2</font></a> will go right upon the way, we will irrigate them with copious water to try them there-by; and whoso turns from the remembrance of his Lord He will drive him to severe torment.</p>  
 <p>And (say) that the mosques are God's, and that ye</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></a></p>  
 <p>should not call on any one with God, and that when God's servant <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="#fn_438"><font size="1">1</font></a> stood up to pray they <a name="fr_439"></a><a href="#fn_439"><font size="1">2</font></a> called out to him and well-nigh crowded upon him. [20] Say, 'I only call upon my Lord, and I join no one with Him.'</p>  
 <p>Say, 'Verily, I cannot control for you either harm, or right direction.'</p>  
 <p>Say, 'Verily, as for me none can protect me against God, nor do I find any refuge beside Him,--except delivering the message from God and His errands: and whoso rebels against God and His Apostle, verily, for him is the fire of hell for them to dwell therein for ever and for aye!'</p>  
 <p>[25] Until when they see what they are threatened with, then shall they surely know who is most weak at helping and fewest in numbers!</p>  
 <p>Say, 'I know not if what ye are threatened with be nigh, or if my Lord will set for it a term. He knows the unseen, and He lets no one know His unseen, save such apostle as He is well pleased with: for, verily, He sends marching before him and behind him a guard!'</p>  
 <p>That He may know that they have delivered the errands of their Lord, for He compasses what they have, and reckons everything by number.</p>
