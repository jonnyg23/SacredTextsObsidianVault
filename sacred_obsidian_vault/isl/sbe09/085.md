 <p>And they took not vengeance on them save for<br>   their belief in God,<br> The mighty, the praiseworthy,<br> Whose is the kingdoms of the heavens<br>   and the earth;<br> For God is witness over all!</p>  
 <p>[10] Verily, those who make trial of the believers, men and women, and then do not repent, for them is the torment of hell, and for them is the torment of the burning!</p>  
 <p>Verily, those who believe and act aright, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow,--that is the great bliss!</p>  
 <p>Verily, the violence of thy Lord is keen!</p>  
 <p>Verily, He produces and returns, and He is the forgiving, the loving, [15] the Lord of the glorious throne; the doer of what He will!</p>  
 <p>Has there come to thee the story of the hosts of Pharaoh and Thamûd?</p>  
 <p>Nay, those who misbelieve do say it is a lie; [20] but God is behind them--encompassing!</p>
