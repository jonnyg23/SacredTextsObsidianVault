 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Qur'ân, part II (Sacred Books of the East volume 9), Palmer edition [1880]; at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">THE CHAPTER OF THOSE SENT.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(LXXVII. Mecca.)</h3>  
 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. By those sent in a series <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">1</font></a>!</p>  
 <p>And by those who speed swiftly!</p>  
 <p>And by the dispensers abroad!</p>  
 <p>And by the separators apart!</p>  
 <p>[5] And by those who instil the reminder, as an excuse or warning!</p>  
 <p>Verily, what ye are threatened with shall surely happen!</p>  
 <p>And when the stars shall be erased!</p>  
 <p>And when the heaven shall be cleft!</p>  
 <p>[10] And when the mountains shall be winnowed! And when the apostles shall have a time appointed for them!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></a></p>  
 <p>For what day is the appointment made?</p>  
 <p>For the day of decision! and what shall make thee know what the decision is?</p>  
 <p>[15] Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>Have we not destroyed those of yore, and then followed them up with those of the latter day? Thus do we with the sinners.</p>  
 <p>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>[20] Did we not create you from contemptible water, and place it in a sure depository unto a certain decreed term? for we are able and well able too!</p>  
 <p>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>[25] Have we not made for them the earth to hold the living and the dead? and set thereon firm mountains reared aloft? and given you to drink water in streams?</p>  
 <p>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>Go off to that which ye did call a lie! [30] Go off to the shadow of three columns, that shall not shade nor avail against the flame! Verily, it throws off sparks like towers,--as though they were yellow camels!</p>  
 <p>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>[15] This is the day when they may not speak,--when they are not permitted to excuse themselves!</p>  
 <p>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>This is the day of decision! We have assembled you with those of yore; if ye have any stratagem employ it now!</p>  
 <p>[40] Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>Verily, the pious are amid shades and springs and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p>fruit such as they love.--'Eat and drink with good digestion, for that which ye have done!' Verily, thus do we reward those who do well.</p>  
 <p>[45] Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>'Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; verily, ye are sinners!'</p>  
 <p>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>And when it is said to them bow down, they bow not down.</p>  
 <p>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</p>  
 <p>[50] And in what new discourse after it will they believe?</p>
