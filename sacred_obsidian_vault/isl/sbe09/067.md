 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Qur'ân, part II (Sacred Books of the East volume 9), Palmer edition [1880]; at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">THE CHAPTER OF THE KINGDOM.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(LXVII. Mecca.)</h3>  
 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>Blessed be He in whose hand is the kingdom, for He is mighty over all!</p>  
 <p>Who created death and life, to try you, which of you does best; for He is the mighty, the forgiving!</p>  
 <p>Who created seven heavens in stories; thou canst not see any discordance in the creation of the Merciful!</p>  
 <p>Why, look again! canst thou see a flaw? Then</p>  
 <p><a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="green">p. 293</font></a></p>  
 <p>look again twice!--thy look shall return to thee driven back and dulled!</p>  
 <p>[5] And we have adorned the lower heaven with lamps; and set them to pelt the devils with <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and we have prepared for them the torment of the blaze!</p>  
 <p>And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the torment of hell, and an evil journey shall it be!</p>  
 <p>When they shall be cast therein they shall hear its braying <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">2</font></a> as it boils--it will well-nigh burst for rage!</p>  
 <p>Whenever a troop of them is thrown in, its treasurers shall ask them, 'Did not a warner come to you?'</p>  
 <p>They shall say, 'Yea! a warner came to us, and we called him liar, and said, "God has not sent down aught; ye are but in great error!"'</p>  
 <p>[10] And they shall say, 'Had we but listened or had sense we had not been amongst the fellows of the blaze!'</p>  
 <p>And they will confess their sins; but 'Avaunt to the fellows of the blaze!'</p>  
 <p>Verily, those who fear their Lord in secret, for them is forgiveness and a great hire!</p>  
 <p>Speak ye secretly or openly, verily, He knows the nature of men's breasts!</p>  
 <p>Ay! He knows who created! for He is the subtle, the well-aware!</p>  
 <p>[15] He it is who made the earth flat for you; so walk in the spacious sides thereof and eat of His provision; for unto Him the resurrection is!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="green">p. 294</font></a></p>  
 <p>Are ye sure that He who is in the heaven will not cleave the earth with you, and that it then shall quake?</p>  
 <p>Or are ye sure that He who is in the heaven will not send against you a heavy sand storm, and that ye then shall know how the warning was?</p>  
 <p>But those before them did call the apostles liars, and what a change it was!</p>  
 <p>Or have they not looked at the birds above them expanding their wings or closing them?--none holds them in except the Merciful One; for He on everything doth look.</p>  
 <p>[20] Or who is this who will be a host for you, to help you against the Merciful?--the misbelievers are only in delusion!</p>  
 <p>Or who is this who will provide you if He hold back His provision?--Nay, but they persist in perverseness and aversion!</p>  
 <p>Is he who walks prone upon his face more guided than he who walks upright upon a straight path?</p>  
 <p>Say, 'It is He who produced you and made for you hearing and sight and hearts'--little is it that ye give thanks.</p>  
 <p>Say, 'It is He who sowed you in the earth, and unto Him shall ye be gathered!'</p>  
 <p>[25] They say, 'When shall this threat be, if ye do speak the truth?'</p>  
 <p>Say, 'The knowledge is only with God; and I am but a plain warner!'</p>  
 <p>And when they see it nigh, sorry shall be the faces of those who misbelieve; and it shall be said, 'This is that for which ye used to call!'</p>  
 <p>Say, 'Have ye considered, whether God destroy me and those with me, or whether we obtain mercy,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="green">p. 295</font></a></p>  
 <p>yet who will protect the misbelievers from grievous torment?'</p>  
 <p>Say, 'He is the Merciful; we believe in Him, and upon Him do we rely; and ye shall shortly know who it is that is in obvious error!'</p>  
 <p>[30] Say, 'Have ye considered if your waters on the morrow should have sunk, who is to bring you flowing water?'</p>
