 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Qur'ân, part II (Sacred Books of the East volume 9), Palmer edition [1880]; at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">THE CHAPTER OF THE RESURRECTION.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(LXXV. Mecca.)</h3>  
 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>I need not swear by the resurrection day!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></a></p>  
 <p>Nor need I swear by the self-accusing soul!</p>  
 <p>Does man think that we shall not collect his bones? Able are we to arrange his finger tips!</p>  
 <p>[5] Nay, but man wishes to be wicked henceforward! he asks, When is the resurrection day?</p>  
 <p>But when the sight shall be dazed, and the moon be eclipsed, and the sun and the moon be together, [10] and man shall say upon that day, 'Where is a place to flee to?'--nay, no refuge! and to thy Lord that day is the sure settlement: He will inform man on that day of what He has sent forward or delayed!</p>  
 <p>Nay, man is an evidence against himself, [15] and even if he thrusts forward his excuses--.</p>  
 <p>Do not move thy tongue thereby to hasten it <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">1</font></a>. It is for us to collect it and to read it; and when we read it then follow its reading. And again it is for us to explain it.</p>  
 <p>[20] Nay, indeed, but ye love the transient life, and ye neglect the hereafter!</p>  
 <p>Faces on that day shall be bright, gazing on their Lord!</p>  
 <p>And faces on that day shall be dismal!</p>  
 <p>[25] Thou wilt think that a back-breaking calamity has happened to them!</p>  
 <p>Nay, but when the [soul] comes up into the throat, and it is said, 'Who will charm it back?' and he will think that it is his parting [hour]. And leg shall be pressed on leg <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">2</font></a>; [30] unto thy Lord on that day shall the driving be.</p>  
 <p>For he did not believe <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">3</font></a> and did not pray; but</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></a></p>  
 <p>he said it was a lie, and turned his back! Then he went to his people haughtily--woe to thee, and woe to thee! again woe to thee, and woe to thee!</p>  
 <p>Does man think that he shall be left to himself?</p>  
 <p>Wasn't <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="076.htm#fn_449"><font size="1">1</font></a> he a clot of emitted seed? Then he was congealed blood, and (God) created him, and fashioned him, and made of him pairs, male and female.</p>  
 <p>[35] Is not He able to quicken the dead?</p>
