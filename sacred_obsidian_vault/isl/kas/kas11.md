 <p>How then shall man so order life<br>
 that when his tale of years is told,<br>
 Like sated guest he wend his way;<br>
 how shall his even tenour hold?</p>
 <p>Despite the Writ that stores the skull;<br>
 despite the Table and the Pen;<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 Maugre the Fate that plays us down,<br>
 her board the world, her pieces men?</p>
 <p>How when the light and glow of life<br>
 wax dim in thickly gath'ering gloom,<br>
 Shall mortal scoff at sting of Death,<br>
 shall scorn the victory of the Tomb?</p>
 <p>One way, two paths, one end the grave.<br>
 This runs athwart the flowery plain,<br>
 That breasts the bush, the steep, the crag,<br>
 in sun and wind and snow and rain:</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Emblems of Kismet, or Destiny.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 59}</p>
 <p>Who treads the first must look adown,<br>
 must deem his life an all in all;<br>
 Must see no heights where man may rise,<br>
 must sight no depths where man may fall.</p>
 <p>Allah in Adam form must view;<br>
 adore the Maker in the made.<br>
 Content to bask in Mâyâ's smile,<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 in joys of pain, in lights of shade.</p>
 <p>He breaks the Law, he burns the Book,<br>
 he sends the Moolah back to school;<br>
 Laughs at the beards of Saintly men;<br>
 and dubs the prophet dolt and fool,</p>
 <p>Embraces Cypress' taper-waist;<br>
 cools feet on wavy breast of rill;<br>
 Smiles in the Nargis' love-lorn eyes,<br>
 and 'joys the dance of Daffodil;</p>
 <p>Melts in the saffron light of Dawn<br>
 to hear the moaning of the Dove;<br>
 Delights in Sundown's purpling hues<br>
 when Bulbul woos the Rose's love.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Illusion.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 60}</p>
 <p>Finds mirth and joy in Jamshid-bowl;<br>
 toys with the Daughter of the vine;<br>
 And bids the beauteous cup-boy say,<br>
 "Master I bring thee ruby wine!"<sup>[1]</sup></p>
 <p>Sips from the maiden's lips the dew;<br>
 brushes the bloom from virgin brow:--<br>
 Such is his fleshly bliss that strives<br>
 the Maker through the Made to know.</p>
 <p>I've tried them all, I find them all<br>
 so same and tame, so drear, so dry;<br>
 My gorge ariseth at the thought;<br>
 I commune with myself and cry:--</p>
 <p>Better the myriad toils and pains<br>
 that make the man to manhood true,<br>
 This be the rule that guideth life;<br>
 these be the laws for me and you:</p>
 <p>With Ignor'ance wage eternal war,<br>
 to know thy self forever strain,<br>
 Thine ignorance of thine ignorance<br>
 is thy fiercest foe, thy deadliest bane;</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. That all the senses, even the ear, may enjoy.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 61}</p>
 <p>That blunts thy sense, and dulls thy taste;<br>
 that deafs thine ears, and blinds thine eyes;<br>
 Creates the thing that never was,<br>
 the Thing that ever is defies.</p>
 <p>The finite Atom infinite<br>
 that forms thy circle's centre-dot,<br>
 So full-sufficient for itself,<br>
 for other selves existing not,</p>
 <p>Finds the world mighty as 'tis small;<br>
 yet must be fought the unequal fray;<br>
 A myriad giants here; and there<br>
 a pinch of dust, a clod of clay.</p>
 <p>Yes! maugre all thy dreams of peace<br>
 still must the fight unfair be fought;<br>
 Where thou mayst learn the noblest lore,<br>
 to know that all we know is nought.</p>
 <p>True to thy Nature, to Thy self,<br>
 Fame and Disfame nor hope nor fear:<br>
 Enough to thee the small still voice<br>
 aye thund'ering in thine inner ear.</p>
 <p>{p. 62}</p>
 <p>From self-approval seek applause:<br>
 What ken not men thou kennest, thou!<br>
 Spurn ev'ry idol others raise:<br>
 Before thine own Ideal bow:</p>
 <p>Be thine own Deus: Make self free,<br>
 liberal as the circling air:<br>
 Thy Thought to thee an Empire be;<br>
 break every prison'ing lock and bar:</p>
 <p>Do thou the Ought to self aye owed;<br>
 here all the duties meet and blend,<br>
 In widest sense, withouten care<br>
 of what began, for what shall end.</p>
 <p>Thus, as thou view the Phantom-forms<br>
 which in the misty Past were thine,<br>
 To be again the thing thou wast<br>
 with honest pride thou may'st decline;</p>
 <p>And, glancing down the range of years,<br>
 fear not thy future self to see;<br>
 Resign'd to life, to death resign'd,<br>
 as though the choice were nought to thee.</p>
 <p>{p. 63}</p>
 <p>On Thought itself feed not thy thought;<br>
 nor turn from Sun and Light to gaze,<br>
 At darkling cloisters paved with tombs,<br>
 where rot the bones of bygone days:</p>
 <p>"Eat not thy heart," the Sages said;<br>
 "nor mourn the Past, the buried Past;"<br>
 Do what thou dost, be strong, be brave;<br>
 and, like the Star, nor rest nor haste.</p>
 <p>Pluck the old woman from thy breast:<br>
 Be stout in woe, be stark in weal;<br>
 Do good for Good is good to do:<br>
 Spurn bribe of Heav'en and threat of Hell.</p>
 <p>To seek the True, to glad the heart,<br>
 such is of life the HIGHER LAW.,<br>
 Whose differ'ence is the Man's degree,<br>
 the Man of gold, the Man of straw.</p>
 <p>See not that something in Mankind<br>
 that rouses hate or scorn or strife,<br>
 Better the worm of Izrâil<sup>[1]</sup> than Death<br>
 that walks in form of life.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The Angel of Death.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 64}</p>
 <p>Survey thy kind as One whose wants<br>
 in the great Human Whole unite;<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 The Homo rising high from earth<br>
 to seek the Heav'ens of Life-in-Light;</p>
 <p>And hold Humanity one man,<br>
 whose universal agony<br>
 Still strains and strives to gain the goal,<br>
 where agonies shall cease to be.</p>
 <p>Believe in all things; none believe;<br>
 judge not nor warp by "Facts" the thought;<br>
 See clear, hear clear, tho' life may seem<br>
 Mâyâ and Mirage, Dream and Naught.</p>
 <p>Abjure the Why and seek the How:<br>
 the God and gods enthroned on high,<br>
 Are silent all, are silent still;<br>
 nor hear thy voice, nor deign reply.</p>
 <p>The Now, that indivisible point<br>
 which studs the length of infinite line<br>
 Whose ends are nowhere, is thine all,<br>
 the puny all thou callest thine.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The "Great Man" of the Enochites and the Mormons.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 64}</p>
 <p>Perchance the law some Giver hath:<br>
 Let be! let be! what canst thou know?<br>
 A myriad races came and went;<br>
 this Sphinx hath seen them come and go.</p>
 <p>Haply the Law that rules the world<br>
 allows to man the widest range;<br>
 And haply Fate's a Theist-word,<br>
 subject to human chance and change.</p>
 <p>This "I" may find a future Life,<br>
 a nobler copy of our own,<br>
 Where every riddle shall be ree'd,<br>
 where every knowledge shall be known;</p>
 <p>Where 'twill be man's to see the whole<br>
 of what on Earth he sees in part;<br>
 Where change shall ne'er surcharge the thought;<br>
 nor hope defer'd shall hurt the heart.</p>
 <p>But!--faded flow'er and fallen leaf<br>
 no more shall deck the parent tree;<br>
 And man once dropt by Tree of Life<br>
 what hope of other life has he?</p>
 <p>{p. 66}</p>
 <p>The shatter'd bowl shall know repair;<br>
 the riven lute shall sound once more;<br>
 But who shall mend the clay of man,<br>
 the stolen breath to man restore?</p>
 <p>The shiver'd clock again shall strike;<br>
 the broken reed shall pipe again:<br>
 But we, we die, and death is one,<br>
 the doom of brutes, the doom of men.</p>
 <p>Then, if Nirwâna<sup>[1]</sup> round our life<br>
 with nothingness, 'tis haply best;<br>
 Thy toils and troubles, want and woe<br>
 at length have won their guerdon--Rest.</p>
 <p>Cease, Abdû, cease! Thy song is sung,<br>
 nor think the gain the singer's prize;<br>
 Till men bold Ignor'ance deadly sin,<br>
 till man deserves his title "Wise:"<sup>[2]</sup></p>
 <p>In Days to come, Days slow to dawn,<br>
 when Wisdom deigns to dwell with men,<br>
 These echoes of a voice long stilled<br>
 haply shall wake responsive strain:</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Comparative annihilation.</p>
 <p>2. "Homo sapiens."]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 67}</p>
 <p>Wend now thy way with brow serene,<br>
 fear not thy humble tale to tell:--<br>
 The whispers of the Desert-wind;<br>
 the tinkling of the camel's bell.</p>
