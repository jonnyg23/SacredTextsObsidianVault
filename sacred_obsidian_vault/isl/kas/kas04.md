 <h1 align="CENTER">II</h1>
 <p>IN these drear wastes of sea-born land,<br>
 these wilds where none may dwell but He,<br>
 What visionary Pasts revive,<br>
 what process of the Years we see:</p>
 <p>Gazing beyond the thin blue line<br>
 that rims the far horizon-ring,<br>
 Our sadden'd sight why haunt these ghosts,<br>
 whence do these spectral shadows spring?</p>
 <p>What endless questions vex the thought,<br>
 of Whence and Whither, When and How?<br>
 What fond and foolish strife to read<br>
 the Scripture writ on human brow</p>
 <p>As stand we percht on point of Time,<br>
 betwixt the two Eternities,<br>
 Whose awful secrets gathering round<br>
 with black profound oppress our eyes.</p>
 <p>{p. 14}</p>
 <p>"This gloomy night, these grisly waves,<br>
 these winds and whirlpools loud and dread:<br>
 What reck they of our wretched plight<br>
 who Safety's shore so lightly tread?</p>
 <p>Thus quoth the Bard of Love and Wine,<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 whose dream of Heaven ne'er could rise<br>
 Beyond the brimming Kausar-cup<br>
 and Houris with the white-black eyes;</p>
 <p>Ah me! my race of threescore years is short,<br>
 but long enough to pall<br>
 My sense with joyless joys as these,<br>
 with Love and Houris, Wine and all.</p>
 <p>Another boasts he would divorce<br>
 old barren Reason from his bed,<br>
 And wed the Vine-maid in her stead;<br>
 fools who believe a word he said!<sup>[2]</sup></p>
 <p>And "'Dust thou art to dust returning,'<br>
 ne'er was spoke of human soul"<br>
 The Soofi cries, 'tis well for him<br>
 that hath such gift to ask its goal.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Hâfiz of Shirâz.</p>
 <p>2. Omar-i-Kayyâm, the tent-maker poet of Persia.]</p>
 </font><p>"And this is all, for this we're born<br>
 to weep a little and to die!"<br>
 So sings the shallow bard whose life<br>
 still labours at the letter "I."</p>
 <p>Ear never heard, Eye never saw<br>
 the bliss of those who enter in<br>
 My heavenly kingdom, "Isâ said,<br>
 who wailed our sorrows and our sin:</p>
 <p>Too much of words or yet too few!<br>
 What to thy Godhead easier than<br>
 One little glimpse of Paradise<br>
 to ope the eyes and ears of man?</p>
 <p>I am the Truth! I am the Truth!<br>
 we hear the God-drunk gnostic cry<br>
 The microcosm abides in ME;<br>
 Eternal Allah's nought but I!</p>
 <p>Mansûr<sup>[1]</sup> was wise, but wiser they<br>
 who smote him with the hurlèd stones;<br>
 And, though his blood a witness bore,<br>
 no wisdom-might could mend his bones.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. A famous Mystic stoned for blasphemy.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 16}</p>
 <p>"Eat, drink, and sport; the rest of life's<br>
 not worth a fillip," quoth the King;<br>
 Methinks the saying saith too much:<br>
 the swine would say the selfsame thing!</p>
 <p>Two-footed beasts that browse through life,<br>
 by death to serve as soil design'd,<br>
 Bow prone to Earth whereof they be,<br>
 and there the proper pleasures find:</p>
 <p>But you of finer, nobler, stuff,<br>
 ye, whom to Higher leads the High,<br>
 What binds your hearts in common bond<br>
 with creatures of the stall and sty?</p>
 <p>In certain hope of Life-to-come<br>
 I journey through this shifting scene<br>
 The Zâhid<sup>[1]</sup> snarls and saunters down<br>
 his Vale of Tears with confi'dent mien.</p>
 <p>Wiser than Amrân's Son<sup>[2]</sup> art thou,<br>
 who ken'st so well the world-to-be,<br>
 The Future when the Past is not,<br>
 the Present merest dreamery;</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The "Philister" of "respectable" belief.</p>
 <p>2. Moses in the Koran.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 17}</p>
 <p>What know'st thou, man, of Life?<br>
 and yet, forever twixt the womb, the grave,<br>
 Thou pratest of the Coming Life,<br>
 of Heav'n and Hell thou fain must rave.</p>
 <p>The world is old and thou art young;<br>
 the world is large and thou art small;<br>
 Cease, atom of a moment's span,<br>
 To hold thyself an All-in-All!</p>
 <p>{p. 18}</p>
