 <p>THERE is no Good, there is no Bad;<br>
 these be the whims of mortal will:<br>
 What works me weal that call I "good,"<br>
 what harms and hurts I hold as "ill:"</p>
 <p>They change with place, they shift with race;<br>
 and, in the veriest span of Time,<br>
 Each Vice has won a Virtue's crown;<br>
 all Good was banned as Sin or Crime:</p>
 <p>Like ravelled skeins they cross and twine,<br>
 while this with that connects and blends;<br>
 And only Khizr<sup>[1]</sup> his eye shall see<br>
 where one begins, where other ends:</p>
 <p>What mortal shall consort with Khizr,<br>
 when Musâ turned in fear to flee?<br>
 What man foresees the flow'er or fruit<br>
 whom Fate compels to plant the tree?</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Supposed to be the Prophet Elijah.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 36}</p>
 <p>For Man's Free-will immortal Law,<br>
 Anagkê, Kismet, Des'tiny read<br>
 That was, that is, that aye shall be,<br>
 Star, Fortune, Fate, Urd, Norn or Need.</p>
 <p>"Man's nat'ural state is God's design;"<br>
 such is the silly sage's theme;<br>
 "Man's primal Age was Age of Gold;"<br>
 such is the Poet's waking dream:</p>
 <p>Delusion, Ign'orance! Long ere Man<br>
 drew upon Earth his earliest breath<br>
 The world was one contin'uous scene<br>
 of anguish, torture, prey and Death;</p>
 <p>Where hideous Theria of the wild<br>
 rended their fellows limb by limb;<br>
 Where horrid Saurians of the sea<br>
 in waves of blood were wont to swim:</p>
 <p>The "fair young Earth" was only fit<br>
 to spawn her frightful monster-brood;<br>
 Now fiery hot, now icy frore,<br>
 now reeking wet with steamy flood.</p>
 <p>{p. 37}</p>
 <p>Yon glorious Sun, the greater light,<br>
 the "Bridegroom" of the royal Lyre,<br>
 A flaming, boiling, bursting mine;<br>
 a grim black orb of whirling fire:</p>
 <p>That gentle Moon., the lesser light,<br>
 the Lover's lamp, the Swain's delight,<br>
 A ruined world, a globe burnt out,<br>
 a corpse upon the road of night.</p>
 <p>What reckt he, say, of Good or Ill<br>
 who in the hill-hole made his lair,<br>
 The blood-fed rav'ening Beast of prey,<br>
 wilder than wildest wolf or bear?</p>
 <p>How long in Man's pre-Ad'amite days<br>
 to feed and swill, to sleep and breed,<br>
 Were the Brute-biped's only life,<br>
 a perfect life sans Code or Creed?</p>
 <p>His choicest garb a shaggy fell,<br>
 his choicest tool a flake of stone;<br>
 His best of orn'aments tattoo'd skin<br>
 and holes to hang his bits of bone;</p>
 <p>{p. 38}</p>
 <p>Who fought for female as for food<br>
 when Mays awoke to warm desire;<br>
 And such the Lust that grew to Love<br>
 when Fancy lent a purer fire.</p>
 <p>Where <i>then</i> "Th' Eternal nature-law<br>
 by God engraved on human heart?"<br>
 Behold his simiad sconce and own<br>
 the Thing could play no higher part.</p>
 <p>Yet, as long ages rolled, he learnt<br>
 from Beaver, Ape and Ant to build<br>
 Shelter for sire and dam and brood,<br>
 from blast and blaze that hurt and killed;</p>
 <p>And last came Fire; when scrap of stone<br>
 cast on the flame that lit his den,<br>
 Gave out the shining ore, and made<br>
 the Lord of beasts a Lord of men.</p>
 <p>The "moral sense," your Zâhid-phrase,<br>
 is but the gift of latest years;<br>
 Conscience was born when man had shed<br>
 his fur, his tail, his pointed ears.</p>
 <p>{p. 39}</p>
 <p>What conscience has the murd'erous Moor,<br>
 who slays his guest with felon blow,<br>
 Save sorrow he can slay no more,<br>
 what prick of pen'itence can he know?</p>
 <p>You cry the "Cruelty of Things "<br>
 is myst'ery to your purblind eye,<br>
 Which fixed upon a point in space<br>
 the general project passes by:</p>
 <p>For see! the Mammoth went his ways,<br>
 became a mem'ory and a name;<br>
 While the half-reasoner, with the hand<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 survives his rank and place to claim.</p>
 <p>Earthquake and plague, storm, fight and fray,<br>
 portents and curses man must deem<br>
 Since he regards his self alone,<br>
 nor cares to trace the scope, the scheme;</p>
 <p>The Quake that comes in eyelid's beat<br>
 to ruin, level, 'gulf and kill,<br>
 Builds up a world for better use,<br>
 to general Good bends special Ill:</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The Elephant.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 40}</p>
 <p>The dreadest sound man's ear can hear,<br>
 the war and rush of stormy Wind<br>
 Depures the stuff of human life,<br>
 breeds health and strength for human-kind:</p>
 <p>What call ye them or Goods or Ills,<br>
 ill-goods, good-ills, a loss, a gain,<br>
 When realms arise and falls a roof;<br>
 a world is won, a man is slain?</p>
 <p>And thus the race of Being runs,<br>
 till haply in the time to be<br>
 Earth shifts her pole and Mushtari<sup>[1]</sup>-men<br>
 another falling star shall see:</p>
 <p>Shall see it fall and fade from sight,<br>
 whence come, where gone no Thought can tell,--<br>
 Drink of yon mirage-stream and chase<br>
 the tinkling of the camel-bell!</p>
