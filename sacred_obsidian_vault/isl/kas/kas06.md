 <p>WHAT Truths hath gleaned that Sage consumed<br>
 by many a moon that waxt and waned?<br>
 What Prophet-strain be his to sing?<br>
 What hath his old Experience gained?</p>
 <p>There is no God, no man-made God;<br>
 a bigger, stronger, crueller man;<br>
 Black phantom of our baby-fears,<br>
 ere Thought, the life of Life, began.</p>
 <p>Right quoth the Hindu Prince of old,<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 "An Ishwara for one I nill,<br>
 Th' almighty everlasting Good<br>
 who cannot 'bate th' Eternal ill:"</p>
 <p>"Your gods may be, what shows they are?"<br>
 hear China's Perfect Sage declare;<sup>[2]</sup><br>
 "And being, what to us be they<br>
 who dwell so darkly and so far?"</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Buddha.</p>
 <p>2. Confucius.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 29}</p>
 <p>"All matter hath a birth and death;<br>
 'tis made, unmade and made anew;<br>
 "We choose to call the Maker 'God'"--<br>
 such is the Zâhid's owly view.</p>
 <p>"You changeful finite Creatures strain<br>
 (rejoins the Drawer of the Wine)"<br>
 "The dizzy depths of Infinite Power<br>
 to fathom with your foot of twine;"</p>
 <p>"Poor idols of man's heart and head<br>
 with the Divine Idea to blend;<br>
 "To preach as 'Nature's Common Course'<br>
 what any hour may shift or end.</p>
 <p>"How shall the Shown pretend to ken<br>
 aught of the Showman or the Show?<br>
 "Why meanly bargain to believe,<br>
 which only means thou ne'er canst know?</p>
 <p>"How may the passing Now contain<br>
 the standing Now--Eternity?--<br>
 "An endless <i>is</i> without a <i>was</i>,<br>
 the <i>be</i> and never the <i>to-be?</i></p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The Soofi or Gnostic opposed to the Zâhid.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 30}</p>
 <p>"Who made your Maker? If Self-made,<br>
 why fare so far to fare the worse<br>
 "Sufficeth not a world of worlds,<br>
 a self-made chain of universe?</p>
 <p>"Grant an Idea, Primal Cause, the Causing Cause,<br>
 why crave for more?<br>
 "Why strive its depth and breadth to mete,<br>
 to trace its work, its aid to 'implore?</p>
 <p>"Unknown, Incomprehensible, whate'er<br>
 you choose to call it, call;<br>
 "But leave it vague as airy space,<br>
 dark in its darkness mystical.</p>
 <p>"Your childish fears would seek a Sire,<br>
 by the non-human God defin'd,<br>
 "What your five wits may wot ye weet;<br>
 what <i>is</i> you please to dub 'design'd;'</p>
 <p>"You bring down Heav'en to vulgar Earth;<br>
 your maker like yourselves you make,<br>
 "You quake to own a reign of Law,<br>
 you pray the Law its laws to break;</p>
 <p>{p. 31}</p>
 <p>"You pray, but hath your thought e'er weighed<br>
 how empty vain the prayer must be,<br>
 "That begs a boon already giv'en,<br>
 or craves a change of law to see?</p>
 <p>"Say, Man, deep learnèd in the Scheme<br>
 that orders mysteries sublime,<br>
 "How came it this was Jesus, that<br>
 was Judas from the birth of Time?</p>
 <p>"How I the tiger, thou the lamb;<br>
 again the Secret, prithee, show<br>
 "Who slew the slain, bowman or bolt<br>
 or Fate that drave the man, the bow?</p>
 <p>"Man worships self: his God is Man;<br>
 the struggling of the mortal mind<br>
 "To form its model as 'twould be,<br>
 the perfect of itself to find.</p>
 <p>"The God became sage, priest and scribe<br>
 where Nilus' serpent made the vale;<br>
 "A gloomy Brahm in glowing Ind,<br>
 a neutral something cold and pale:</p>
 <p>{p. 32}</p>
 <p>"Amid the high Chaldean hills<br>
 a moulder of the heavenly spheres;<br>
 "On Guebre steppes the Timeless-God<br>
 who governs by his dual peers:</p>
 <p>"In Hebrew tents the Lord that led<br>
 His leprous slaves to fight and jar;<br>
 "Yahveh,<sup>[1]</sup> Adon or Elohim,<br>
 the God that smites, the Man of War.</p>
 <p>"The lovely Gods of lib'ertine Greece,<br>
 those fair and frail humanities<br>
 "Whose homes o'erlook'd the Middle Sea,<br>
 where all Earth's beauty cradled lies,</p>
 <p>"Ne'er left its blessèd bounds, nor sought<br>
 the barb'arous climes of barb'arous gods<br>
 "Where Odin of the dreary North<br>
 o'er hog and sickly mead-cup nods:</p>
 <p>"And when, at length, 'Great Pan is dead,<br>
 uprose the loud and dol'orous cry<br>
 "A glamour wither'd on the ground,<br>
 a splendour faded in the sky.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Jehovah.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 33}</p>
 <p>"Yea, Pan was dead, the Nazar'ene came<br>
 and seized his seat beneath the sun,<br>
 The votary of the Riddle-god,<br>
 whose one is three and three is one;</p>
 <p>"Whose sadd'ening creed of herited Sin<br>
 spilt o'er the world its cold grey spell;<br>
 "In every vista showed a grave,<br>
 and 'neath the grave the glare of Hell;</p>
 <p>"Till all Life's Po'esy sinks to prose;<br>
 romance to dull Real'ity fades;<br>
 "Earth's flush of gladness pales in gloom<br>
 and God again to man degrades.</p>
 <p>"Then the lank Arab foul with sweat,<br>
 the drainer of the camel's dug,<br>
 "Gorged with his leek-green lizard's meat,<br>
 clad in his filthy rag and rug,</p>
 <p>"Bore his fierce Allah o'er his sands<br>
 and broke, like lava-burst upon<br>
 "The realms where reigned pre-Adamite Kings,<br>
 where rose the Grand Kayânian throne.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Kayâni--of the race of Cyrus; old Guebre heroes.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 36}</p>
 <p>"Who now of ancient Kayomurs,<br>
 of Zâl or Rustam cares to sing,<br>
 "Whelmed by the tempest of the tribes<br>
 that called the Camel-driver King?</p>
 <p>Where are the crown of Kay Khusraw,<br>
 the sceptre of Anûshirwân,<br>
 "The holy grail of high Jamshîd,<br>
 Afrâsiyab's hall?--Canst tell me, man?</p>
 <p>"Gone, gone, where 1 and thou must go,<br>
 borne by the winnowing wings of Death,<br>
 "The Horror brooding over fife,<br>
 and nearer brought with every breath:</p>
 <p>"Their fame hath filled the Seven Climes,<br>
 they rose and reigned, they fought and fell,<br>
 "As swells and swoons across the wold<br>
 the tinkling of the Camel's bell.</p>
 <p>{p. 35}</p>
