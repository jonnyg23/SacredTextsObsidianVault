 <h1 align="CENTER">VIII</h1>
 <p>THERE is no Heav'en, there is no Hell;<br>
 these be the dreams of baby minds;<br>
 Tools of the wily Fetisheer,<br>
 to 'fright the fools his cunning blinds.</p>
 <p>Learn from the mighty Spi'rits of old<br>
 to set thy foot on Heav'en and Hell;<br>
 In Life to find thy hell and heav'en<br>
 as thou abuse or use it well.</p>
 <p>So deemed the doughty Jew who dared<br>
 by studied silence low to lay<br>
 Orcus and Hades, lands of shades,<br>
 the gloomy night of human day.</p>
 <p>Hard to the heart is final death:<br>
 fain would an <i>Ens</i> not end in <i>Nil</i>;<br>
 Love made the senti'ment kindly good:<br>
 the Priest perverted all to ill.</p>
 <p>{p. 51}</p>
 <p>While Reason sternly bids us die,<br>
 Love longs for life beyond the grave:<br>
 Our hearts, affections, hopes and fears<br>
 for life-to-be shall ever crave.</p>
 <p>Hence came the despot's darling dream,<br>
 a Church to rule and sway the State;<br>
 Hence sprang the train of countless griefs<br>
 in priestly sway and rule innate.</p>
 <p>For future Life who dares reply?<br>
 No witness at the bar have we;<br>
 Save what the brother Potsherd tells,--<br>
 old tales and novel jugglery.</p>
 <p>Who e'er return'd to teach the Truth.,<br>
 the things of Heaven and Hell to limn?<br>
 And all we hear is only fit<br>
 for grandam-talk and nursery-hymn.</p>
 <p>"Have mercy, man!" the Zâhid cries,<br>
 "of our best visions rob us not!<br>
 "Mankind a future life must have<br>
 to balance life's unequal lot."</p>
 <p>{p. 52}</p>
 <p>"Nay," quoth the Magian, "'tis not so;<br>
 I draw my wine for one and all,<br>
 "A cup for this, a score for that,<br>
 e'en as his measure's great or small:</p>
 <p>"Who drinks one bowl hath scant delight;<br>
 to poorest passion he was born;<br>
 "Who drains the score must e'er expect<br>
 to rue the headache of the morn."</p>
 <p>Safely he jogs along the way<br>
 which 'Golden Mean' the sages call;<br>
 Who scales the brow of frowning Alp<br>
 must face full many a slip and fall.</p>
 <p>Here èxtremes meet, anointed Kings<br>
 whose crownèd heads uneasy lie,<br>
 Whose cup of joy contains no more<br>
 than tramps that on the dunghill die.</p>
 <p>To fate-doomed Sinner born and bred<br>
 for dangling from the gallows-tree;<br>
 To Saint who spends his holy days<br>
 in rapt'urous hope his God to see;</p>
 <p>{p. 53}</p>
 <p>To all that breathe our upper air<br>
 the hands of Dest'iny ever deal,<br>
 In fixed and equal parts, their shares<br>
 of joy and sorrow, woe and weal.</p>
 <p>How comes it, then, our span of days<br>
 in hunting wealth and fame we spend<br>
 Why strive we (and all humans strive)<br>
 for vain and visionary end?</p>
 <p>Reply: mankind obeys a law<br>
 that bids him labour, struggle, strain;<br>
 The Sage well knowing its unworth,<br>
 the Fool a-dreaming foolish gain.</p>
 <p>And who, mid e'en the Fools, but feels<br>
 that half the joy is in the race<br>
 For wealth and fame and place, nor sighs<br>
 when comes success to crown the chase?</p>
 <p>Again: in Hind, Chîn, Franguestân<br>
 that accident of birth befell.<br>
 Without our choice, our will, our voice:<br>
 Faith is an accident as well.</p>
 <p>{p. 54}</p>
 <p>What to the Hindu saith the Frank:<br>
 "Denier of the Laws divine!<br>
 "However godly-good thy Life,<br>
 Hell is the home for thee and thine."</p>
 <p>"Go strain the draught before 'tis drunk,<br>
 and learn that breathing every breath,<br>
 "With every step, with every gest,<br>
 something of life thou do'est to death."</p>
 <p>Replies the Hindu: "Wend thy way<br>
 for foul and foolish Mlenchhas fit;<br>
 "Your Pariah-par'adise woo and win;<br>
 at such dog-Heav'en I laugh and spit.</p>
 <p>"Cannibals of the Holy Cow!<br>
 who make your rav'ening maws the grave<br>
 "Of Things with self-same right to live;--<br>
 what Fiend the filthy license gave?"</p>
 <p>What to the Moslem cries the Frank?<br>
 "A polygamic Theist thou!<br>
 From an imposter-Prophet turn;<br>
 Thy stubborn head to Jesus bow."</p>
 <p>{p. 55}</p>
 <p>Rejoins the Moslem: "Allah's one<br>
 tho' with four Moslemahs I wive,<br>
 "One-wife-men ye and (damnèd race!)<br>
 you split your God to Three and Five."</p>
 <p>The Buddhist to Confucius thus:<br>
 "Like dogs ye live, like dogs ye die;<br>
 "Content ye rest with wretched earth;<br>
 God, judgment, Hell ye fain defy."</p>
 <p>Retorts the Tartar: "Shall I lend<br>
 mine only ready-money 'now,'<br>
 "For vain usurious 'Then' like thine,<br>
 avaunt, a triple idiot Thou!"</p>
 <p>With this poor life, with this mean world<br>
 I fain complete what in me lies;<br>
 "I strive to perfect this my me;<br>
 my sole ambition's to be wise."</p>
 <p>When doctors differ who decides<br>
 amid the milliard-beaded throng?<br>
 Who save the madman dares to cry:<br>
 "'Tis I am right, you all are wrong?"</p>
 <p>{p. 56}</p>
 <p>"You all are right, you all are wrong,"<br>
 we hear the careless Soofi say,<br>
 "For each believes his glimm'ering lamp<br>
 to be the gorgeous light of day."</p>
 <p>"<i>Thy</i> faith why false, <i>my</i> faith why true?<br>
 'tis all the work of Thine and Mine,<br>
 "The fond and foolish love of self<br>
 that makes the Mine excel the Thine."</p>
 <p>Cease then to mumble rotten bones;<br>
 and strive to clothe with flesh and blood<br>
 The skel'eton; and to shape a Form<br>
 that all shall hail as fair and good.</p>
 <p>"For gen'erous youth," an Arab saith,<br>
 "Jahim's<sup>[1]</sup> the only genial state;<br>
 "Give us the fire but not the shame<br>
 with the sad, sorry blest to mate."</p>
 <p>And if your Heav'en and Hell be true,<br>
 and Fate that forced me to be born<br>
 Force me to Heav'en or Hell--I go,<br>
 and hold Fate's insolence in scorn.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Jehannum, Gehenna, Hell.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 57}</p>
 <p>I want not this, I want not that,<br>
 already sick of Me and Thee;<br>
 And if we're both transform'd and changed,<br>
 what then becomes of Thee and Me?</p>
 <p>Enough to think such things may be:<br>
 to say they are not or they are<br>
 Were folly: leave -them all to Fate,<br>
 nor wage on shadows useless war.</p>
 <p>Do what thy manhood bids thee do,<br>
 from none but self expect applause;<br>
 He noblest lives and noblest dies<br>
 who makes and keeps his self-made laws.</p>
 <p>All other Life is living Death,<br>
 a world where none but Phantoms dwell,<br>
 A breath, a wind, a sound, a voice,<br>
 a tinkling of the camel-bell.</p>
 <p>{p. 58}</p>
