 <p>FIE, fie! you visionary things,<br>
 ye motes that dance in sunny glow,<br>
 Who base and build Eternities<br>
 on briefest moment here below;</p>
 <p>Who pass through Life liked cagèd birds,<br>
 the captives of a despot will;<br>
 Still wond'ring How and When and Why,<br>
 and Whence and Whither, wond'ring still;</p>
 <p>Still wond'ring how the Marvel came<br>
 because two coupling mammals chose<br>
 To slake the thirst of fleshly love,<br>
 and thus the "Immortal Being" rose;</p>
 <p>Wond'ring the Babe with staring eyes,<br>
 perforce compel'd from night to day,<br>
 Gript in the giant grasp of Life<br>
 like gale-born dust or wind-wrung spray;</p>
 <p>{p. 19}</p>
 <p>Who comes imbecile to the world<br>
 'mid double danger, groans, and tears;<br>
 The toy, the sport, the waif and stray<br>
 of passions, error, wrath and fears;</p>
 <p>Who knows not Whence he came nor Why,<br>
 who kens not Whither bound and When,<br>
 Yet such is Allah's choicest gift,<br>
 the blessing dreamt by foolish men;</p>
 <p>Who step by step perforce returns<br>
 to couthless youth, wan, white and cold,<br>
 Lisping again his broken words<br>
 till all the tale be fully told:</p>
 <p>Wond'ring the Babe with quenchèd orbs,<br>
 an oldster bow'd by burthening years,<br>
 How 'scaped the skiff an hundred storms;<br>
 how 'scaped the thread a thousand shears;</p>
 <p>How coming to the Feast unbid,<br>
 he found the gorgeous table spread<br>
 With the fair-seeming Sodom-fruit,<br>
 with stones that bear the shape of bread:</p>
 <p>{p. 20}</p>
 <p>How Life was nought but ray of sun<br>
 that clove the darkness thick and blind,<br>
 The ravings of the reckless storm,<br>
 the shrieking of the rav'ening wind;</p>
 <p>How lovely visions 'guiled his sleep,<br>
 aye fading with the break of morn,<br>
 Till every sweet became a sour,<br>
 till every rose became a thorn;</p>
 <p>Till dust and ashes met his eyes<br>
 wherever turned their saddened gaze;<br>
 The wrecks of joys and hopes and loves,<br>
 the rubbish of his wasted days;</p>
 <p>How every high heroic Thought<br>
 that longed to breathe empyrean air,<br>
 Failed of its feathers, fell to earth,<br>
 and perisht of a sheer despair;</p>
 <p>How, dower'd with heritage of brain,<br>
 whose might has split the solar ray,<br>
 His rest is grossest coarsest earth,<br>
 a crown of gold on brow of clay;</p>
 <p>{p. 21}</p>
 <p>This House whose frame be flesh and bone,<br>
 mortar'd with blood and faced with skin,<br>
 The home of sickness, dolours, age;<br>
 unclean without, impure within:</p>
 <p>Sans ray to cheer its inner gloom,<br>
 the chambers haunted by the Ghost,<br>
 Darkness his name, a cold dumb Shade<br>
 stronger than all the heav'nly host.</p>
 <p>This tube, an enigmatic pipe,<br>
 whose end was laid before begun,<br>
 That lengthens, broadens, shrinks and breaks;<br>
 --puzzle, machine, automaton;</p>
 <p>The first of Pots the Potter made<br>
 by Chrysorrhoas' blue-green wave;<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 Methinks I see him smile to see<br>
 what guerdon to the world he gave!</p>
 <p>How Life is dim, unreal, vain,<br>
 like scenes that round the drunkard reel;<br>
 How "Being" meaneth not to be;<br>
 to see and hear, smell, taste and feel.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The Abana, River of Damascus.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 22}</p>
 <p>A drop in Ocean's boundless tide,<br>
 unfathom'd waste of agony;<br>
 Where millions live their horrid lives<br>
 by making other millions die.</p>
 <p>How with a heart that would through love<br>
 to Universal Love aspire,<br>
 Man woos infernal chance to smite,<br>
 as Min'arets draw the thunder-fire.</p>
 <p>How Earth on Earth builds tow'er and wall,<br>
 to crumble at a touch of Time;<br>
 How Earth on Earth from Shînar-plain<br>
 the heights of Heaven fain would climb.</p>
 <p>How short this Life., how long withal;<br>
 how false its weal, how true its woes,<br>
 This fever-fit with paroxysms<br>
 to mark its opening and its close.</p>
 <p>Ah! gay the day with shine of sun,<br>
 and bright the breeze, and blithe the throng<br>
 Met on the River-bank to play,<br>
 when I was young, when I was young:</p>
 <p>{p. 23}</p>
 <p>Such general joy could never fade;<br>
 and yet the chilling whisper came<br>
 One face had paled, one form had failed;<br>
 had fled the bank, had swum the stream;</p>
 <p>Still revellers danced, and sang, and trod<br>
 the hither bank of Time's deep tide,<br>
 Still one by one they left and fared<br>
 to the far misty thither side;</p>
 <p>And now the last hath slipt away<br>
 yon drear death-desert to explore,<br>
 And now one Pilgrim worn and lorn<br>
 still lingers on the lonely shore.</p>
 <p>Yes, Life in youth-tide standeth still;<br>
 in manhood streameth soft and slow;<br>
 See, as it nears the 'abysmal goal<br>
 how fleet the waters flash and flow!</p>
 <p>And Deaths are twain; the Deaths we see<br>
 drop like the leaves in windy Fall;<br>
 But ours, our own, are ruined worlds,<br>
 a globe collapst, last end of all.</p>
 <p>{p. 24}</p>
 <p>We live our lives with rogues and fools,<br>
 dead and alive, alive and dead,<br>
 We die 'twixt one who feels the pulse<br>
 and one who frets and clouds the head.</p>
 <p>And,--oh, the Pity!--hardly conned<br>
 the lesson comes its fatal term;<br>
 Fate bids us bundle up our books,<br>
 and bear them bod'ily to the worm:</p>
 <p>Hardly we learn to wield the blade<br>
 before the wrist grows stiff and old;<br>
 Hardly we learn to ply the pen<br>
 ere Thought and Fancy faint with cold.</p>
 <p>Hardly we find the path of love,<br>
 to sink the self, forget the "I,"<br>
 When sad suspicion grips the heart,<br>
 when Man, <i>the</i> Man begins to die:</p>
 <p>Hardly we scale the wisdom-heights,<br>
 and sight the Pisgah-scene around,<br>
 And breathe the breath of heav'enly air,<br>
 and hear the Spheres' harmonious sound;</p>
 <p>{p. 25}</p>
 <p>When swift the Camel-rider spans<br>
 the howling waste, by Kismet sped,<br>
 And of his Magic Wand a wave<br>
 hurries the quick to join the dead.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
 <p>How sore the burden, strange the strife;<br>
 how full of splendour, wonder, fear;<br>
 Life, atom of that Infinite Space<br>
 that stretcheth 'twixt the Here and There.</p>
 <p>How Thought is imp'otent to divine<br>
 the secret which the gods defend,<br>
 The Why of birth and life and death,<br>
 that Isis-veil no hand may rend.</p>
 <p>Eternal Morrows make our day;<br>
 our <i>is</i> is aye <i>to be</i> till when<br>
 Night closes in; 'tis all a dream,,<br>
 and yet we die,--and then and THEN?</p>
 <p>And still the Weaver plies his loom,<br>
 whose warp and woof is wretched Man<br>
 Weaving th' unpattern'd dark design,<br>
 so dark we doubt it owns a plan.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Death in Arabia rides a Camel, not a pale horse.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 26}</p>
 <p>Dost not, O Maker, blush to hear,<br>
 amid the storm of tears and blood,<br>
 Man say Thy mercy made what is,<br>
 and saw the made and said 'twas good?</p>
 <p>The marvel is that man can smile<br>
 dreaming his ghostly ghastly dream;-<br>
 Better the heedless atomy<br>
 that buzzes in the morning beam!</p>
 <p>O the dread pathos of our lives!<br>
 how durst thou, Allah, thus to play<br>
 With Love, Affection, Friendship,<br>
 all that shows the god in mortal clay.</p>
 <p>But ah! what 'vaileth man to mourn;<br>
 shall tears bring forth what smiles ne'er brought;<br>
 Shall brooding breed a thought of joy?<br>
 Ah hush the sigh, forget the thought!</p>
 <p>Silence thine immemorial quest,<br>
 contain thy nature's vain complaint<br>
 None heeds, none cares for thee or thine;<br>
 like thee how many came and went?</p>
 <p>{p. 27}</p>
 <p>Cease, Man, to mourn, to weep, to wail;<br>
 enjoy thy shining hour of sun;<br>
 We dance along Death's icy brink,<br>
 but is the dance less full of fun?</p>
 <p>{p. 28}</p>
