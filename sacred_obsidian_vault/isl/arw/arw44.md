 <p>Avarice and faith in God can never live together in the heart of man.</p>  
 <p>Avarice and ill-nature have no place in the heart of a good man.</p>  
 <p>Avarice is the parent of all evil dispositions.</p>  
 <p>The riches of an avaricious man go either to naught or to an heir.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>He who is close-fisted shall be treated in a like manner.</p>  
 <p>A man who is miserly to himself cannot be generous to others.</p>  
 <p>An avaricious man is more lavish of his life than of his money.</p>  
 <p>A liberal man lives on his riches, a miser is eaten up by them.</p>  
 <p>A miser lives the life of a poor man in this world, and will be judged as a rich man in the world to come.</p>  
 <p>He who makes his morsel large will be choked.</p>  
 <p>Avarice is the murderer of the miser.</p>  
 <p>Greed is the mate of sorrow.</p>  
 <p>Strong wine is not more destructive to reason than greed.</p>  
 <p>An old man continues to be young in two things—love of money and love of life.</p>
