 <p><i>Koran.</i>    Be true to a covenant, for a covenant holds a man responsible. Be faithful to your pledged covenants and keep your oaths.</p>  
 <p><i>Traditions.</i>    A man who keeps not his word has no religion.</p>  
 <p>A true man's word is like an oath.</p>  
 <p>Be truthful in what you say, faithful to your promise, and careful of what is entrusted to you.</p>  
 <p>A pledged word is as if you had made the gift.</p>  
 <p><i>Proverbs.</i>    A true man keeps his promise.</p>  
 <p>A pledged word has the same value as a debt.</p>  
 <p>The promise of a true man is a greater obligation than a debt.</p>  
 <p>That man is a hypocrite who prays and fasts, but is untruthful in what he says, false to his word, and unfaithful in discharging a trust.</p>
