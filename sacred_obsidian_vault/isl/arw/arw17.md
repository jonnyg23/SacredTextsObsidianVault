 <p>To carry a heavy rock to the summit of a mountain is easier than to receive a kindness which is flaunted.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>The bane of a generous action is to mention it.</p>  
 <p>It is better to refuse a kindness than to be reminded of it.</p>  
 <p>I would not accept the whole world if I were to suffer the humiliation of being constantly reminded of the gift.</p>  
 <p>To bestow and flaunt a kindness, and to be stingy and refuse to do an act of kindness, are equally bad.</p>  
 <p>When you do a kindness hide it, and when a kindness is done to you proclaim it.</p>  
 <p>Do good, and throw it into the sea.</p>
