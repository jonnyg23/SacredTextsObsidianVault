 <p>Contentment is to refrain from coveting what others have.</p>  
 <p>Contentment is a treasure which is inexhaustible.</p>  
 <p>The most thankful of men is he who is contented.</p>  
 <p>He who seeks riches must seek them in contentment.</p>  
 <p>Give freely, and be content with little.</p>  
 <p>A contented man is happy in life.</p>  
 <p>Life is a vanishing space of time, and he alone vanquishes its changing fortunes who lives in contentment.</p>  
 <p>Be content with what God has given you, and you will be the richest of men.</p>  
 <p>If you cannot have what you want, be content with what you have.</p>  
 <p>If all cannot be obtained, a part may be attained.</p>  
 <p>There is relief in despair.</p>
