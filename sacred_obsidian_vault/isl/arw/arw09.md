 <p>Humility is that line of conduct which is a mean between overbearing pride on the one hand and abject servility on the other, as economy is the middle term between extravagance and avarice.</p>  
 <p>Humility is the crown of nobility, a ladder to honour, and a means of procuring love and esteem.</p>  
 <p>He who humbleth himself, God lifteth him up.</p>  
 <p>When Abu-Bekr, "the righteous" (the first Khalif), was praised, he used to say: "O God, Thou knowest me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than they know me. Make me, I pray Thee, better than they suppose; forgive me what they know not, and lay not to my account what they say."</p>  
 <p>A wise man was once asked whether he knew of any good which is not coveted, or any evil which deserves no mercy, and he said: "Yes, they are humility and pride."</p>  
 <p>To despise a proud man is true humility.</p>
