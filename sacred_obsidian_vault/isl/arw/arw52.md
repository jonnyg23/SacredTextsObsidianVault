 <p>Return a salutation by something better, or at least by something as good <i>(Koran)</i>.</p>  
 <p>A warm greeting renews friendship.</p>  
 <p>Respect is due to a visitor.</p>  
 <p>The best of men is a rich man who visits the poor, and the worst is a poor man who visits the rich.</p>  
 <p>Go a mile to see a sick man, go two miles to make peace between two men, and go three miles to call on a friend.</p>  
 <p>Make your visits short, especially to the sick.</p>  
 <p>To visit too often is tiresome to your friends, and to visit too rarely is less than what is due to friendship.</p>  
 <p>Your calls will be best appreciated when they are seasonable and not too frequent.</p>  
 <p>Too much familiarity is a cause of coolness among friends.</p>  
 <p>Do not associate much with men; if you do, shut your eyes to their faults, and bear consequent trouble.</p>
