 <p>Children are a gift from God.</p>  
 <p>A child is a flower which has come down from Paradise.</p>  
 <p>Nothing is dearer than a child, except a grandchild.</p>  
 <p>When your son is young, train him; when he is grown, make a brother of him.</p>  
 <p>That child is loved most who is young until</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>he is grown up, or sick until he recovers, or absent until he returns home.</p>  
 <p>Your riches and your children are a temptation to you <i>(Koran)</i>.</p>  
 <p>Happy is the woman who has first daughters, then sons.</p>  
 <p>If you do not train up your child, time will do it.</p>  
 <p>The training of children is like chewing stones.</p>  
 <p>Your riches and children are your enemies—beware of them <i>(Koran)</i>.</p>  
 <p>The joy of parents in their children prolongs life.</p>  
 <p>Sorrow for a child is a burning fire in the heart.</p>  
 <p>He who is not tender to his child shall find no tenderness in God to him.</p>  
 <p>Your children are not too many for Death, nor is your money too much for a rapacious governor.</p>
