 <p>A good character is a great boon.</p>  
 <p>Kind words are the bonds of love.</p>  
 <p>A kind word is like an act of charity.</p>

 <p>with wicked men, and a good nature towards all.</p>  
 <p>There are cases where not kindness but severity is necessary.</p>  
 <p>Kindness increases the love of friends, and diminishes the hatred of enemies.</p>  
 <p>Be firm after you have been kind.</p>

 <p>An evil nature is a calamity from which there is no escape.</p>  
 <p>If you hear that a mountain has moved from its place believe it, but if you hear that a man has changed his character do not believe it, for he will act only according to his nature.</p>  
 <p>An inherited quality may be traced back to the seventh grandfather.</p>  
 <p>There are four points in a good character from which all other good traits take their origin—prudence, courage, continence, and justice.</p>  
 <p>When a woman has had more than one husband in this life, she will, in the future state, be free to be the wife of him whose character she esteemed the most.</p>
