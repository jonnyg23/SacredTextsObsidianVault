 <p>Most thoughts are wishes.</p>  
 <p>The thoughts of the wise are more trustworthy than the convictions of fools.</p>  
 <p>Do not confuse opinions with certainties.</p>  
 <p>If you are doubtful of a thing let it alone.</p>  
 <p>Remove doubts by enquiry.</p>  
 <p>A thing that is heard is not like a thing that is seen.</p>  
 <p>Do not believe all that you hear.</p>  
 <p>It is not wise to be sure of a thing only because you think so.</p>  
 <p>Where there is much difference of opinion it is difficult to know the truth.</p>  
 <p>To think well of others is a religious duty.</p>

 <p>He who thinks well of others is a happy man.</p>  
 <p>He who has an evil thing in him thinks all men are like him.</p>  
 <p>If a man think well of you, make his thought true.</p>  
 <p>A poet says: "It was my habit to think well of others until experience taught me otherwise."</p>  
 <p>Be well with God and fear nothing.</p>  
 <p>Most men think well of themselves, and this is self-delusion.</p>
