 <p>To recompense good for good is a duty.</p>  
 <p>Neglect of recompense is contemptible.</p>  
 <p>If a man do you a favour recompense him, and if you are unable to do so, pray for him.</p>  
 <p>The worst kind of recompense is to requite evil for good.</p>  
 <p>Reproach faults by kindness, and requite evil by good.</p>  
 <p>There is no glory in revenge.</p>  
 <p>Meet insult by insult, and honour by honour. Evil can be repelled only by evil.</p>  
 <p>What you put into the pot you will take out in the ladle.</p>  
 <p>He who plays with a cat must bear its scratches.</p>  
 <p>He who lives in a house of glass should not throw stones at people.</p>  
 <p>Sins may lurk, but God deals heavy blows.</p>
