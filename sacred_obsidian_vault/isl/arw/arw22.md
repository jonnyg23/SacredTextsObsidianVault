 <p>Ignorance is the greatest poverty.</p>  
 <p>Ignorance is death in life.</p>  
 <p>There is no evil so great as ignorance.</p>  
 <p>Folly is an incurable disease.</p>  
 <p>A foolish man is like an old garment, which if you patch it in one place becomes rent in many other places.</p>  
 <p>It is just as allowable to blame a blind man for want of sight as to blame a fool for his folly.</p>  
 <p>To bear the folly of a fool is indeed a great hardship.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>The best way to treat a fool is to shun him.</p>  
 <p>The fool is an enemy to himself—how can he then be a friend to others?</p>  
 <p>An ignorant man is highly favoured, for he casts away the burden of life, and does not vex his soul with thoughts of time and eternity.</p>  
 <p>The most effectual preacher to a man is himself. A man never turns away from his passions unless the rebuke comes from himself to himself.</p>
