 <p><i>Koran.</i>    Those who worship the Merciful One are they who walk on the earth gently, and who, when fools speak to them, say "Peace." (25, 64.)</p>  
 <p><i>Traditions    </i>Be friendly to him who would be unfriendly to you, give him who will not give you, and forbear with him who would do you harm.</p>  
 <p>Next to faith in God, the chief duty of man is to treat his fellow men with gentleness and courtesy.</p>  
 <p><i>Sayings and Proverbs.</i>    Gentleness is one of the noblest traits in a man's character.</p>  
 <p>A gentle man is a man of great beauty.</p>  
 <p>One of the surest evidences of gentleness is tenderness to fools.</p>  
 <p>The fierce anger of a foolish man is checked by gentleness as a fierce fire is extinguished by water.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>Gentleness is sometimes an humiliation, and he who is always forbearing and patient may be trodden down by fools.</p>  
 <p>If you honour a vile man, you disgrace the code of honour.</p>
