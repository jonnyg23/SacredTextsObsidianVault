 <p>A friend is a second self and a third eye.</p>  
 <p>A true man is he who remembers his friend when he is absent, when he is in distress, and when he dies.</p>  
 <p>A friend is known only in adversity.</p>  
 <p>If your friend is sweet, do not eat him up.</p>  
 <p>If you would keep a friend, do not lend him money nor borrow from him.</p>  
 <p>Keep to your old friends—your new friends will not be so constant.</p>  
 <p>You may find in a friend a brother who was not born of your mother.</p>  
 <p>The noblest man is he whose friendship may be easily obtained, and whose enmity can be incurred only with difficulty.</p>  
 <p>He is a weak man who can make no friends, and still weaker is he who loses them.</p>  
 <p>When my vine was laden with grapes, my friends</p>  
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a></p>  
 <p>were many; when the grapes were finished, my friends disappeared.</p>  
 <p>Friendship may come down by inheritance from ancestors, and so may hatred.</p>  
 <p>Nothing makes us feel so lonely as solitude, and nothing makes us so cheerful as freedom from evil companions.</p>  
 <p>Without human companions, Paradise itself would be an undesirable place to live in.</p>  
 <p>A man's character is judged by the character of his companions.</p>  
 <p>Smoke is no less an evidence of fire than that a man's character is that of the character of his associates.</p>  
 <p>He who associates with a suspected person will himself be suspected.</p>
