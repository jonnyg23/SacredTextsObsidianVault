 <p>True nobility lies in high character and refined manners, not in noble birth or ancient pedigree.</p>  
 <p>A noble man is he who aims at noble ends—not he who glories in an ancestry mouldering in the dust.</p>  
 <p>A noble man is noble though he come to want, and a base man is base though he walks on pearls.</p>  
 <p>A lion is a lion though his claws be clipped, and a dog is a dog though he wear a collar of gold.</p>  
 <p>He who disregards his own honour gets no good from an honourable lineage.</p>  
 <p>Learning and high principles take the place of noble birth, and cover the shame of a low origin.</p>  
 <p>A branch tells of what stock it comes.</p>
