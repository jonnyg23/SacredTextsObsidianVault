 <p>War is an evil thing to both victor and vanquished.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is better to avoid than to make war.</p>  
 <p>The most honourable death is on the battlefield.</p>  
 <p>To die in battle from a thousand cuts of the sword is easier than to die in bed.</p>  
 <p>He who incites soldiers to courage in action is of more value than a thousand fighting men.</p>  
 <p>An army to a king is like wings to a bird.</p>  
 <p>To carry out a well-devised plan in war is more effectual than strokes and thrusts.</p>  
 <p>A battle is fought by feints and stratagems.</p>  
 <p>What an easy thing is a battle to one who looks on at a distance!</p>  
 <p>Patient constancy is the key to victory.</p>  
 <p>Two wolves kill a lion. Two weak men vanquish one that is strong.</p>  
 <p>Beware of aggression in war—for it can lead to no glory in victory.</p>  
 <p>To overcome the weak has all the shame of a defeat.</p>  
 <p>A butcher is not frightened at the sight of a multitude of sheep.</p>  
 <p>To retire from an unsuccessful battle is defeat.</p>  
 <p>Magnanimity to captives, and mercy to the fallen, are a hymn of praise to God for victory.</p>
