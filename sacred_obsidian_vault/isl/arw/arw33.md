 <p>Man is like an ear of wheat shaken by the wind—sometimes up and sometimes down.</p>  
 <p>Man is a target to the accidents of time.</p>  
 <p>One day for us, and one day against us.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>With to-day there is to-morrow.</p>  
 <p>To every Moses there is a Pharaoh.</p>  
 <p>There is no day which has not its opposite.</p>  
 <p>The changes of fortune show what a man is made of.</p>  
 <p>There is no joy which is not followed by sorrow.</p>  
 <p>When Fortune brings a great good, she follows it by a great evil.</p>  
 <p>Fortune gives lavishly, and then turns round and takes away.</p>  
 <p>When a man has attained his highest hope, let him expect that its downfall is near by.</p>  
 <p>When a thing waxes to perfection it begins rapidly to wane.</p>  
 <p>When distress reaches its utmost, relief is close at hand.</p>  
 <p>What is past is dead.</p>  
 <p>Every ascent has a descent, and every trouble has an end.</p>  
 <p>Do not worry—between one twinkle of the eye and that which follows it things may change.</p>  
 <p>I have looked far and wide, and saw nothing on the faces of men but looks of perplexity or regret.</p>  
 <p>To complain of one's grief, except to God, is an humiliation.</p>  
 <p>He who thinks that Fortune will always favour him is a fool.</p>  
 <p>Follow the tracks of the fortunate man and you will come to fortune,</p>
