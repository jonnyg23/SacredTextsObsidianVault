 <p>A man obtains only what he strives for.</p>  
 <p>He who seeks and struggles shall find.</p>  
 <p>Struggles bring the most unlikely things within reach.</p>  
 <p>When a man makes up his mind to do a thing it becomes easy for him to do it.</p>  
 <p>If you have a clear thought, be decided, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>hesitate not—if you decide, hesitate not, but carry it out speedily.</p>  
 <p>You must be ready to confront difficulties if you would realise your hopes.</p>  
 <p>It is the part of man to strive, and not to rely on the favours of Fortune.</p>  
 <p>Not every one who seeks shall find, nor every one who is indifferent be denied.</p>  
 <p>Beware of giving up hope in what you earnestly seek.</p>  
 <p>A wise man perseveres, and is not easily turned away.</p>  
 <p>Not by fitful efforts, but by constancy, is an end secured.</p>  
 <p>The most profitable labour is that which is most persevering—though it may not be strenuous.</p>  
 <p>A moderate success is better than overwhelming work.</p>  
 <p>Success comes to him who abjures procrastination.</p>  
 <p>The world is the booty of the skilful.</p>  
 <p>The most wonderful thing in the world is the success of a fool and the failure of a wise man.</p>  
 <p>A pleasing manner is a great aid to success.</p>  
 <p>It is the duty of man to do his utmost, but he is not responsible for success.</p>  
 <p>Do not undertake a work for which you are not competent.</p>
