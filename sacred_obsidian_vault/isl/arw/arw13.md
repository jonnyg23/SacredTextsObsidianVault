 <p><i>Koran.</i>    Do good unto others as God has done unto you.</p>  
 <p>Is the reward of kindness anything but kindness?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p>He who does a kindly act shall be recompensed tenfold.</p>  
 <p>Ye can never be righteous unless ye give away from that which ye love.</p>  
 <p><i>Traditions.</i>    The upper hand [which giveth] is better than the lower hand [which taketh].</p>  
 <p>God's creatures are the objects of His care, and He loveth best that man who is most helpful to them.</p>  
 <p><i>Proverbs.</i>    Do not be ashamed to give little, for it is less than that, if you give nothing.</p>  
 <p>If you give, give freely, and if you strike, strike boldly.</p>  
 <p>He who soweth kindness shall reap thanks.</p>  
 <p>What a man does for God is never lost.</p>  
 <p>Be merciful to him who is beneath you, and you will have mercy from Him who is above you.</p>  
 <p>The best kind of good is that which is done most speedily.</p>  
 <p>Inopportune kindness is injustice.</p>  
 <p>No true joy but in doing good and no true sorrow but in doing evil.</p>  
 <p>Cruelty to animals is forbidden by God.</p>  
 <p>A peacemaker gets two-thirds of the blows.</p>
