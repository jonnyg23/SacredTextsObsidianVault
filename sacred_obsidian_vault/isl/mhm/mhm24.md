 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was passing through one of the towns of Ahwaz when my supreme object was to capture a stray word, <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="#fn_438"><font size="1">6</font></a> or add to my store an eloquent expression. My journeying led me to a vast open space of the town where lo!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>there was a company of people gathered around and listening to a man who was tapping the ground with beats which varied not, I knew there must be a tune with those beats. So I withdrew not, in order that I might enjoy the song or hear a chaste expression, but remained among the spectators, shouldering this one and pushing that one, until I reached the man. I passed my eye over him <a name="fr_439"></a><a href="#fn_439"><font size="1">1</font></a>and I found him to be a person short and portly like a beetle, <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_440"><font size="1">2</font></a> blind, and wrapped up in a woollen blanket, whirling round like a top, wearing a burnous <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">3</font></a> too long for him, and supporting himself with a staff to which were attached a number of tiny bells. With this he was beating the ground with a rythmical sound, while with plaintive air and pathetic voice proceeding from a straightened breast, he sang:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'O people my debt weighs down my back, <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> And my wife demands her dowry,<br> After abundance and plenty, I have become<br> A dweller in a barren land and an ally of penury.<br> O people, is there a generous man among ye,<br> Who will aid me against the vicissitudes of time?<br> O people, because of my poverty my patience is exhausted,<br> While now no flowing robes my state conceal,<br> Time with its destroying hand hath scattered<br> What I had of silver and gold;<br> In the evening I repair to a house the size of a span,<br> My lot is obscure and my pot is small.<br> If God but seal my affair with good,<br> He will send me ease after difficulty.<br> Is there among ye a worthy youth of noble origin,<br> Who will acquire through me a great reward?<br> Even though he value not thankfulness?'</dir>  
 <p>Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: By Heavens! my heart became tender towards him and my eyes were filled with tears for him.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> So I gave him a dinar I had with me. And he delayed not but said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'What beauty is hers <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">1</font></a> and how intensely yellow.<br> Light, stamped and round,<br> Water almost drops from her lustre,<br> A noble mind hath produced her,<br> Yea, a soul of a youth possessed by generosity,<br> Which makes him do what it will.<br> O thou for whom this praise is meant,<br> Exaggeration cannot describe the extent of thy worth.<br> I therefore refer thee to God <a name="fr_444"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">2</font></a> with whom is thy reward.<br> May God have mercy upon him who will bind her to her pair<br> And associate her with her sister.'</dir>  
 <p>The people then gave him what they were disposed to give. Then he left them. But I followed him, for I knew by the quickness with which he recognized the dinar that he was feigning blindness. As soon as we were alone <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">3</font></a> I stretched forth my right hand, seized his left arm and said: 'By Heavens! thou shalt disclose to me thy secret, or else I will assuredly expose thee.' Then he opened his pair of almonds. <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">4</font></a> I drew his veil from his face and behold--by Heavens! it was our Sheikh Abú’l-Fatḥ, al-Iskanderí. Said I: 'Art thou Abú’l-Fatḥ?' He answered: 'Nay;</p>  
 <p></p><dir>I am Abú Qalamún, <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">5</font></a> In every hue do I appear,<br> Choose a base calling, For base is thy age,<br> Repel time <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">6</font></a> with folly, For verily time is a kicking camel.<br> Never be deceived by reason, Madness is the only reason.' <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">7</font></a></dir>
