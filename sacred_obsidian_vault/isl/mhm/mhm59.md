 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: Bishr ibn ‘Awánah, the ‘Abdíte, was a robber, and he made a raid upon some riders on camels among whom was a beautiful woman whom he married. And he said: 'I have never seen the like of to-day.' <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1088"><font size="1">4</font></a> So she recited:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'The intense blackness in my eye, <a name="fr_1089"></a><a href="#fn_1089"><font size="1">5</font></a> and a fore-arm white as silver have delighted Bishr,<br> Whilst there is near him, within view, one of slender waist walking proudly in a pair of anklets,<br> The most beautiful of those that walk on two feet. <a name="fr_1090"></a><a href="#fn_1090"><font size="1">6</font></a><br> If Bishr were to bring her and me together,<br> My exile would be lasting and my separation prolonged:<br> And, if he were to measure her beauty with mine,<br> The morning would manifest itself to the possessor of two eyes.'  <a name="fr_1091"></a><a href="#fn_1091"><font size="1">7</font></a></dir>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186</font></a></p>  
 <p>Said Bishr: 'Fie on thee! <a name="fr_1092"></a><a href="#fn_1092"><font size="1">1</font></a> Whom dost thou mean?' She replied: 'Thy paternal uncle's daughter, Fátima.' He asked: 'Is she as beautiful as thou hast described?' She answered: 'More so, and much more so.' Then he recited saying:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Fie on thee! O possessor of white front teeth, I did not think I would exchange thee;<br> But now thou hast signified by allusion, the valley is open to thee, so sing and lay thine eggs. <a name="fr_1093"></a><a href="#fn_1093"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Mine eyelids shall not close in slumber until I raise mine honour from base degrees.'</dir>  
 <p>So she said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Many a wooer  <a name="fr_1094"></a><a href="#fn_1094"><font size="1">3</font></a> has importunately pressed his suit for her,<br> While she is cousin to thee, the daughter of a paternal uncle, closely related.' <a name="fr_1095"></a><a href="#fn_1095"><font size="1">4</font></a></dir>  
 <p>Then he sent to his uncle asking for his daughter in marriage, but the uncle denied him his request. <a name="fr_1096"></a><a href="#fn_1096"><font size="1">5</font></a> Therefore he swore not to show any of them any consideration, if he would not marry his daughter to him. So he inflicted many injuries upon them, and continuously vexed them. Therefore the men of the tribe assembled before his uncle and said: 'Save us from thy madman.' He replied: 'Clothe me not with infamy, <a name="fr_1097"></a><a href="#fn_1097"><font size="1">6</font></a> but respite me that I may destroy him by stratagem.' They said: 'Do so.' Then his uncle said to him: 'I have sworn not to marry this my</p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p>  
 <p>daughter, save to him who will drive to her a thousand she-camels as a dowry, and I will be satisfied with none but the she-camels of the Khuzá‘ah.' <a name="fr_1098"></a><a href="#fn_1098"><font size="1">1</font></a> Now the object of the uncle was that Bishr should traverse the road between him and the Khuzá‘ah so that a lion might tear him to pieces; for the Arabs used to avoid that way in which there was a lion named Dadh and a serpent called Shuja‘. One of them says concerning her</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Swifter to slay <a name="fr_1099"></a><a href="#fn_1099"><font size="1">2</font></a> than Dadh <a name="fr_1100"></a><a href="#fn_1100"><font size="1">3</font></a> and Shuja‘.<br> If Dadh is the king of beasts, she is the queen of serpents.'</dir>  
 <p>Then did Bishr travel that road, but he had not traversed half of it when he met the lion. His colt reared and beat the ground with its hind-feet. So he alighted and hamstrung it. Then he drew his sword on the lion, attacked it and cut it in two, breadthwise. Then he wrote with the blood of the lion on his shirt to his cousin:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'O 'Fáṭima, <a name="fr_1101"></a><a href="#fn_1101"><font size="1">4</font></a> if thou hadst been present in the valley of Khabt, <a name="fr_1102"></a><a href="#fn_1102"><font size="1">5</font></a> when the lion met thy brother Bishr,<br> Then thou wouldst have seen a lion <a name="fr_1103"></a><a href="#fn_1103"><font size="1">6</font></a> visiting a lion, the lion victorious meeting another.<br> "He advanced proudly, <a name="fr_1104"></a><a href="#fn_1104"><font size="1">7</font></a> and my colt timidly drew back and I exclaimed, "Mayest thou be slaughtered for a colt!<br> Let both my feet reach the surface of the ground, for I perceive the earth has a surer back than thou."</dir>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p></p><dir>And I said to him <a name="fr_1105"></a><a href="#fn_1105"><font size="1">1</font></a>--and he had displayed sharpened fangs and a frowning face;<br> In treachery one of his paws gripped the ground while he stretched forth the other to pounce upon me,<br> Indicating his strength of claw, sharpness of fang and glances thou wouldst reckon to be live coals;<br> And in my right hand was a keen edge, upon whose blade the trace of deadly blows remains--<br> Hath it not reached thee what its keen edges did at Káz̤ima, <a name="fr_1106"></a><a href="#fn_1106"><font size="1">2</font></a> the morning I met ‘Amr?<br> And my heart is like thine, it dreads not the attack, then how should it fear intimidation?<br> And thou desirest for the cubs food, and I seek for the paternal uncle's daughter a dowry.<br> Therefore in respect of what dost thou induce one like me to turn his back, and, perforce, to place his life in thy hands?<br> I have admonished thee, O lion, therefore seek other than me as food, for verily my flesh is bitter.<br> But when he thought my counsel insincere and he disagreed with me, as though I had spoken vainly,<br> He moved and I moved, like two lions desiring one object, which, when they sought it, they found to be difficult of attainment.<br> I shook the sword at him and I thought verily I had with it drawn forth the dawn in the darkness.<br> And I bestowed upon him a deadly blow, which showed him that it told him false when it promised him it would betray me.<br> I let the Indian sword in my right hand go, and it slashed ten of his ribs.<br> So he fell on the ground covered with blood, and it was as though in him I had demolished a lofty edifice.<br> And I said to him; "It is to me a hard thing  <a name="fr_1107"></a><a href="#fn_1107"><font size="1">3</font></a> that I have slain my like in courage and glory.</dir>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>But thou didst desire a thing that none beside thee desired, therefore, O lion, I could not endure it.<br> Thou didst endeavour to instruct me to flee; by the life of thy father! thou didst attempt a difficult thing.<br> But grieve not, for thou didst meet an ingenuous one who is careful not to be blamed, therefore, thou hast died honourably.<br> For, if thou art slain, there is no disgrace, for thou didst meet one freeborn on both sides?"'</dir>  
 <p>Now, when these lines reached his uncle, he repented of his forbidding him to marry her, and he feared lest the serpent might suddenly attack him. So he arose, went in his track, and came up with him when the fierceness of the serpent had taken possession of him, but, when he saw his uncle, rage of the days of savagery <a name="fr_1108"></a><a href="#fn_1108"><font size="1">1</font></a> seized him, so that he put his hand into the serpent's mouth, thrust his sword into her and said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'A Bishr, whose ambition <a name="fr_1109"></a><a href="#fn_1109"><font size="1">2</font></a> for greatness is far-reaching;<br> when his uncle saw him in the open plain,<br> It was as though he were bereft of himself, and his mother were bereft of him;<br> She attacked with an attack that caused him concern. Then he arose against the offspring of the desert and his hand and sleeve disappeared in its mouth.<br> And its life is my life, and my venom is its venom.'</dir>  
 <p>Now when he had slain the serpent, his uncle said: 'Verily I exposed thee to danger in a matter from which God hath diverted me. So return, that I may marry thee to my daughter.' Now when he turned back, Bishr filled his mouth with boasting, until there appeared on his horse a beardless youth, like unto the crescent moon, enveloped in his weapons. So he said: 'O Uncle, I hear the sound of a quarry.' And he went forth and behold, a spear's length off, a young man who said: 'May thy mother be bereft of thee! O Bishr, if thou hast slain a worm and a beast, dost thou fill thy jaws with boasting? Thou art safe if thou</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>surrender thy uncle.' Said Bishr: 'Perish thy mother! Who art thou?' He answered: 'The black day and the red death.' <a name="fr_1110"></a><a href="#fn_1110"><font size="1">1</font></a> Said Bishr: 'May she, who excreted thee, be bereft of thee.' He retorted: 'O Bishr and she that excreted thee.' Then each one attacked the other, but Bishr could do nothing to him, while the youth was able to inflict upon him twenty thrusts in the region of the kidneys, <a name="fr_1111"></a><a href="#fn_1111"><font size="1">2</font></a> but, as often as the point of the spear touched him, he prevented it from wounding his body, in order to spare him. He said: 'O Bishr, what thinkest thou? Could I not, if I wished, have given thee as food to the point of the spear?' <a name="fr_1112"></a><a href="#fn_1112"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>He then threw down the spear, drew his sword, and struck Bishr twenty blows with the flat of the blade, but Bishr could not deal him one. Then he said: 'O Bishr, surrender thy uncle and go in safety.' He replied: 'Yes, on condition that thou tell me who thou art.' He said: 'I am thy son.' He <a name="fr_1113"></a><a href="#fn_1113"><font size="1">4</font></a> exclaimed: 'Good gracious! I have never approached a worthy woman, whence then this gift?' He answered: 'I am the son of the woman who directed thee to thy uncle's daughter.' Then said Bishr:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'That staff is from this stave. <a name="fr_1114"></a><a href="#fn_1114"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> Does the serpent bring forth other than the serpent?' <a name="fr_1115"></a><a href="#fn_1115"><font size="1">6</font></a></dir>  
 <p>And he swore never to ride a noble steed or wed a fair lady. Then he married his uncle's daughter to his son.</p>
