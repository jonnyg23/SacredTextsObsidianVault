 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: In the year A.H. 75 <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">3</font></a> I took part in a raid, on the frontier of Qazwín, <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">4</font></a> with those that raided it. We crossed not a rugged upland, but we also descended into a valley, until our march brought us to one of the villages. The scorching noon-day heat impelled us to seek the shade of some tamarisk trees in the centre <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">5</font></a> of which was a spring, like unto the flame of a torch, <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">6</font></a> more limped than a tear, gliding over the stony ground as glides the restless serpent. We took what food we were inclined to take, then we sought the shade and addressed ourselves to the noon-day nap. But sleep had not yet overcome us when we heard a voice more disagreeable than the braying of an ass <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">7</font></a> and a footfall lighter than that of a camel's colt; accompanying these two was the sound of a drum which seemed to proceed from the jaws of a lion and which drove away</p>

 <p>the scout of sleep from the people. I opened both my eyes <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">1</font></a>and looked towards him, but the trees intervened between us. So I listened and lo! he was reciting to the beat of the drum:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'I invite to God, <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">2</font></a> is there an answerer?<br> To a spacious shelter and luxuriant pasture.<br> To a lofty garden <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">3</font></a> the fruits whereof <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">4</font></a> cease not to be near to gather and never vanish from sight.<br> O people, verily I am a man returning <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> From the land of infidelity, and wondrous is my story.<br> If now I have believed, how many nights<br> Have I denied my Lord and committed the questionable thing? <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">6</font></a><br> Ah! many the swine the ends of whose soft bones I have chewed,<br> And the intoxicant of which I have obtained a share!<br> Then did God guide me and zealous and effectual endeavour raised me from the baseness of unbelief,<br> But I continued to conceal my religion from my people,<br> And to worship God with a penitent heart.<br> I adored the goddess al-Lát, <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">7</font></a> for fear of the enemy,<br> And in dread of the Watcher, I looked not towards the Ka‘ba.<br> I besought God when night enveloped me and dreadful day wasted me,<br> Lord, as Thou hast saved me,<br> Now deliver me, for I am a stranger among them.<br> Then did I take the night as my steed,<br> And I had before me  <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">8</font></a> no spare mount, except resolution.</dir>

 <p></p><dir>Suffice thee to know of my journey, that it was in a night,<br> In which the head of a child would almost turn grey,<br> Until I passed from the enemy's territory<br> Into the guarded domain of the Faith, and then I shook off fear.<br> When the signs of the Faith came in sight, I said:<br> Assistance from God and a speedy victory.' <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">1</font></a></dir>  
 <p>Now, when he reached this verse, he said: 'O people! I have entered <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">2</font></a> your dwelling with a resolution which love hath not excited, nor poverty impelled. I have left behind my back gardens planted with trees, and vineyards, damsels <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">3</font></a> of equal age with swelling breasts, and excellent horses, <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_480"><font size="1">4</font></a> heaped up wealth, <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">5</font></a> equipments, a numerous tribe, mounts and slaves: But I came forth as the serpent issues from its hole, <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">6</font></a> and the bird goes forth from its nest, preferring my religion to my worldly possessions, bringing my right to my left, <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">7</font></a> and joining my day march to my night journey. Now I pray ye will ye combat the fire with its own sparks, <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">8</font></a> and stone the Byzantine empire with its own missiles, and with assistance and aid, with support and succour, and help me in invading them, but not exceeding bounds, every one according to his several ability and in proportion to his wealth? I will not regard a bag of ten thousand dirhems too much; I will accept a mite <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">9</font></a> and not decline a date. For each one from me</p>

 <p>there will be two arrows, <a name="fr_486"></a><a href="#fn_486"><font size="1">1</font></a> one of which I will sharpen for future recompense, and the other I will notch with prayer <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">2</font></a> and with it from the bow of darkness <a name="fr_488"></a><a href="#fn_488"><font size="1">3</font></a> shoot at the gates of Heaven.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám 'His admirable diction excited me, so I cast off the robe of sleep and ran to the company and lo! it was our Shaikh, Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí, with a sword which he had drawn, and in a garb which he had adopted as a disguise. Now when he saw me he winked his eye at me and said: 'May God be merciful to him who from his abundance <a name="fr_489"></a><a href="#fn_489"><font size="1">4</font></a> will help us and apportion to us a share of his favours.' Then he took what he got, then I led him aside and said: 'Art thou of the sons of the Nabateans? <a name="fr_490"></a><a href="#fn_490"><font size="1">5</font></a> He answered:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'As is my state with fate,  <a name="fr_491"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">6</font></a> such is my state with pedigree.<br> 'My genealogy is in the hands of Time, if it is hard upon it, it will change.<br> In the evening a Nabatean am I, in the morning an Arab.'</dir>

 <p><a name="fn_464"></a><a href="mhm26.htm#fr_464">78:3</a> <i>The year A.H. 75:</i> If we accept this date the author goes back to the raid made by al-Bara ibn ‘Azíb appointed governor of Rai in A.H. 24. If we take it to be A.H. 375 which is the more probable date, that would place the episode five years before Hamadhání is said to have left his native city. De Sacy has adopted the latter view (<i>Chrestomathie Arabe</i>, iii, 243.) The year 375 was an eventful one, but there is no allusion to a raid on the frontier of Qazwín. See Ibn al-Athír, ix, 29-33.</p>
