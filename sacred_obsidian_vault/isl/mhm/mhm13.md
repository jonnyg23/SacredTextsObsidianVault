 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I was in my young days, I rode my mount into every species of blind folly and urged my courser into every kind of error until I had drunk of life a delicious draft and had donned the flowing robes of fortune. But when the day brightened <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">5</font></a> my night and I gathered up my skirts <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">6</font></a> and prepared for the final judgement, I mounted a tame steed <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">7</font></a> in order to discharge a bounden duty. <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">8</font></a> There accompanied me on the road a friend in whom I saw nothing wrong to make me repudiate him. Now, when we had exchanged confessions and confidences, the story revealed that he was a Kúfan by principle and a Ṣúfí by persuasion, <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">9</font></a> and so we travelled on.</p>  
 <p>Now, when we alighted at Kúfa, <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">10</font></a> we went to his house and</p>

 <p>entered it, when the face of day had become sombre <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">1</font></a> and its cheeks darkened. <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">2</font></a> Then, when the eye of the night had drooped, and the dawn on its lip had sprouted, there was a knock at the door. <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">3</font></a> We asked, 'What wanderer is knocking?' He answered: 'The envoy of night and its messenger, the defeated and hunted of hunger, a well-bred personage in the leash of misfortune and bad times; a guest, whose tread is light <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">4</font></a> and whose stray <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">5</font></a> is a loaf; a neighbour who asks aid against hunger and a patched smock; an exile after whose departure the fire of banishment <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">6</font></a> was kindled, in whose wake the howling dogs have barked, after whom pebbles were cast and the areas swept. <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">7</font></a> His jaded camel is fatigue; his pleasure is affliction, and between him and his two chicks is a vast desert.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám; I took from my purse the lion's share, <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">8</font></a> passed it to him and said, 'Increase thy demands and we will increase our gifts to thee.' He replied, 'No fire so hot to cause aloeswood to diffuse its fragrance as that of generosity, and the envoy of benevolence is met by no one better than the messenger of gratitude. Therefore, whoever possesses plenty, let him do good, for generosity will not pass unrewarded <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">9</font></a> by God and man. But as for thee, may God cause</p>

 <p>thee to realise thy hopes and give thee the supreme hand. <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">1</font></a> Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: Then we opened the door for him and said 'Enter' and lo! by Heavens, it was our Shaikh Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí! So I said:' 'Distressing is the extreme poverty which thou hast reached and this aspect especially.' Then he smiled, and indited, saying:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Let not my demanding deceive thee,<br> I am in a state of affluence <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">2</font></a> so great that the pocket of joy would tear,<br> I could, if I wished, have ceilings of gold.' <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">3</font></a></dir>
