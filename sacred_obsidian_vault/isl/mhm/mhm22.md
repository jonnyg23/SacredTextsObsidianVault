 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in one of the regions of the Fazára <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">6</font></a> tribe riding one noble mount and leading another which in turn coursed along with me. And I was making for my native land so that the night with its terrors did not divert me, nor did distance with its deserts turn me from my purpose.</p>  
 <p>I struck off the leaves of day <a name="fr_408"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">7</font></a> with the staff of travel, and with the horse's hoofs I penetrated into the maw of night. Meanwhile, in a night so dark that the Qaṭáṭ would lose its way, <a name="fr_409"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">8</font></a> and the bat could not see <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">9</font></a> in it, I was going swiftly and</p>

 <p>smoothly along, <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">1</font></a> nothing passing from the right but a lion and nought from the left save a hyena, when suddenly there appeared to my view a rider fully armed; he was making for some tamarisk trees and traversing towards me the intervening stretches of desert. So there seized me because of him what seizes the unarmed in the presence of one bristling with weapons. But I put on a bold front and said: 'Perish thy father, stand! Before thou canst attain thy object thou wilt have to endure wounds of steel, <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">2</font></a> strip the tragacanth <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">3</font></a> of its leaves, and face a stout foeman with the pride of an Azdite. I am for peace, if thou wilt, or for war, if thou desirest. Tell me, who art thou?' He replied: 'Peace hast thou found.' I said: 'Thou hast answered well, but who art thou?' He answered: 'A counsellor, if thou seekest counsel, an orator if thou desirest converse, but before my name is a veil which the mentioning of no proper name can remove.' I then said: 'What is thy trade?' He replied: 'I roam about the interiors of the countries, in order that I may light upon the dish of a generous man. I have a mind served by a tongue, and rhetoric which my own fingers record. My utmost desire is a generous person who will lower me one of his saddlebags and give me his wallet, like the free-born youth that met me yesterday as the rising sun and vanished from my sight with the going down of the same. But although he has disappeared, the memory of him remaineth, and, though he has taken leave of me, the marks of his favour accompany me still.' Pointing to what he had on, he continued: 'None can acquaint you of them <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">4</font></a> better than they themselves.' I exclaimed to myself, 'by the Lord of the Ka‘ba an importunate, grasping beggar, experienced in the craft, nay but a past master <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">5</font></a> of the art: Thou wilt have</p>

 <p>to give him something and pay liberally,' <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">1</font></a> so I said: 'Young man, thou hast manifested thy diction; how does thy poetry compare with thy prose?' He replied: 'There is no comparison between my prose and my verse.' Then he summoned aid from his natural ability, raised his voice to such a pitch that it filled the valley, and recited saying:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'A pure-minded one presented to me by the night, and by the desert,<br> And by the five so swift that they barely touched the ground. <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> I applied to his timber <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">3</font></a> the test of the fire of generous deeds.<br> And he proved to be, both on the paternal and the maternal sides, of high degree.<br> I sought to cajole him into parting with his property and I succeeded in cajoling him.<br> I endeavoured to facilitate his giving, and it was made easy to him.<br> And when we had revealed ourselves to each other, and he found my prose praiseworthy,<br> He tested me in my versification with what he was disposed to test me.<br> But, when he shook me, he shook none other than a keen blade,<br> And he found me not but the first in the race,<br> While I discovered him to be ever bright and beaming, <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> And there was beneath him none other than a showy steed, blazed on forehead and feet.'</dir>

 <p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 70</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then I said to him: 'Gently, O youth, and thou canst command what I have with me.'</p>  
 <p>He said: 'The provision bag with its contents.' I replied: 'Aye and its bearer too.' Then I clasped him with my hands and said: 'By Him who hath endowed them with the sense of touch, and from one split them into five, thou shalt not leave me, unless I learn thy state.' Then he lowered his veil from his face and lo! by heavens! it was our Sheikh, al-Iskanderí! Without further waiting I said: </p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Abú’l-Fatḥ, <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">1</font></a> in pride hast thou girt on this blade,<br> But what doest thou with the sword when thou art no warrior?<br> So melt down into an anklet the gold with which thou hast bedecked this sword of thine.'</dir>
