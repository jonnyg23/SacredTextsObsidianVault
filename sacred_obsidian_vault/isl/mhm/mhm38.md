 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I sallied forth from Ruṣáfa <a name="fr_725"></a><a href="#fn_725"><font size="1">5</font></a> to go to the capital when the fervent summer sultriness <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_726"><font size="1">6</font></a> boiled in the breast of irritation. Now when I had traversed half the road, the heat became intense, patience failed me and so I turned towards a masjid which had appropriated to itself the secret of all beauty. <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">7</font></a> And in it there were people</p>

 <p>contemplating its ceilings and discussing its pillars. Finally the discussion led them <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the mentioning of thieves and their artifices, and cut-purses and their practices.</p>  
 <p>They mentioned among thieves, forgers of seals, the light-fingered, and palmers, him who gives short weight, him who robs in the ranks, him who throttles by the sudden attack, <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">2</font></a> him who hides in the locker till lifting is possible, him who substitutes by cajoling, <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">3</font></a> him who steals in jest, him who steals by the confidence trick, him who invites to compromise, <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">4</font></a> him who sweeps off the change, <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_732"><font size="1">5</font></a> him who induces sleep, <a name="fr_733"></a><a href="#fn_733"><font size="1">6</font></a> him who confounds with backgammon, <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">7</font></a> him who deceives with the monkey, him who gets the better by means of the mantle  <a name="fr_735"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">8</font></a> and a needle and thread, him who brings thee a lock, <a name="fr_736"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">9</font></a> him who</p>

 <p><a name="fn_725"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_725">122:5</a> <i>Ruṣáfa:</i> A famous quarter to the east of Baghdad. In the time of al-Manṣúr (A.D. 754-75) it was the cantonment of the city. It was built by the Khalífa's son al-Mahdí, in A.H. 159, and in time grew to the size of the capital itself. It was also the necropolis of the ‘Abbásid Khalífas. (Yaqút, ii, 783. See also Le Strange, <i>Baghdad</i>.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_726"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_726">122:6</a> <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>Fervent summer sultriness:</i> Another reading <font color="GREEN">…</font> The live coals of the intense summer heat.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_727"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_727">122:7</a> <i>Which had appropriated to itself the secret of all beauty:</i> The cathedral masjid of Ruṣáfa was larger and more magnificent than that of Baghdad itself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_728"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_728">123:1</a> <i>Finally the discussion led them:</i> <font color="GREEN">…</font> 'the end of the discussion led them' <font color="GREEN">…</font> means the hinder part of anything, particularly the buttock or rump. In poetry it signifies the second half of a verse or couplet, the first half being called ṣadr (<font color="GREEN">…</font>)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_729"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_729">123:2</a> <i>Him who throttles by the sudden attack:</i> From <font color="GREEN">…</font> he went lightly or stealthily, and <font color="GREEN">…</font> he despatched him. (Lane's Lexicon, article p. 887.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_730"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_730">123:3</a> <i>Him who substitutes by cajoling:</i> For this use of the word <font color="GREEN">…</font> than that adopted by the commentator, see Letters of the author, p 329, line 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_731"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_731">123:4</a> <i>Him who invites to compromise:</i> In a case where he has no legal claim.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_732"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_732">123:5</a> <i>Who sweeps off the change:</i> The explanation of this trick is as follows: the thief goes to a money changer on the pretext of changing a dinar then snatches what the man has before him and decamps.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_733"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_733">123:6</a> <i>Him who induces sleep:</i> The thief being in company with some one who has money pretends to be drowsy and thus induces his victim to go to sleep, he then robs him of his property. But, literally, 'him who puts to sleep with the eye.' More probably, therefore, hypnotic suggestion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_734"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_734">123:7</a> <i>Him who confounds with backgammon:</i> The thief takes with him into the house he intends to rob a backgammon or chess-board, usually made of cloth, and spreads it out. In case he is discovered by the master of the house he raises a cry that he has been cheated at the game and his opponent refuses to pay his losses.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_735"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_735">123:8</a> <i>By means of the mantle:</i> The thief observes a man wearing a mantle, goes quickly behind him, raises the skirt of the garment, in order to get at the purse usually carried underneath, and begins sewing it to the collar. If he is discovered, and the man turns round, he says, 'Do not be afraid, I was only mending thy cloak; dost thou not want it done?' In this way he manages to escape with or without the purse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_736"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_736">123:9</a> <i>Him who brings thee a lock:</i> The thief contrives to sell the shopkeeper a defective lock. If the latter uses it to lock up his shop, the thief takes advantage of the first opportunity to effect an entrance and to help himself to the merchant's goods.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_737"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_737">124:1</a> <i>Hemp</i> (<font color="GREEN">…</font>): Arabicized from the Persian <font color="GREEN">…</font> (Sanskrit <i>bhangā</i>), Baron Hammer Purgstall is wrong in identifying it with the Coptic <i>bendj</i>, plural <i>nebendj</i>, which he says is the same plant as the νηπενθης which so much perplexed the commentators of Homer (<a href="errata.htm#8">Odyssey</a>, 4. 221 sq.), for two reasons:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>(a) There is no such word as <i>bendj</i> or <i>nebendj</i> in Coptic.  
 <p>(b) It is a good Sanskrit word and is found in the Athara-Veda Samhita (xi. 6. 15). Also see Monier Williams' Sanskrit and English Dictionary, article Bhangā.</p></dir>  
 <p></p>
 <p><a name="fn_738"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_738">124:2</a> <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>By juggling:</i> Arabicized from the Persian <font color="GREEN">…</font> literally anything new; also magic and enchantment.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_739"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_739">124:3</a> <i>Him who changes his shoes:</i> A very easy thing to do at the masjid or the bath where shoes and sandals have to be left outside.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_740"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_740">124:4</a> <i>Him who ties his two ropes:</i> the modus operandi is this: The thief climbs upon the terrace or roof of a house, ties to the end of a rope what he wishes to steal, descends quickly and pulls his booty down.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_741"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_741">124:5</a> <i>Him who ascends from the well:</i> Which he has been using as a place of concealment.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_742"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_742">124:6</a> <i>Him who accompanies the caravan:</i> As if he were one of the travellers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_743"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_743">124:7</a> <i>The gentry of the cloth:</i> That is, the wearers of the ascetic garb. This is still a very popular form of disguise in the East.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_744"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_744">124:8</a> <i>Him who enters the assemblies:</i> By virtue of being well-dressed and of respectable appearance. This is the fourth time the author uses the word <i>Maqáma</i>. Here it means companies of respectable people.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_745"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_745">124:9</a> <i>From the night patrol:</i> The thief enters a house to rob it. If he is surprised, he declares he has run away from the night patrol and is the victim of an injustice. If he is believed he waits for an opportunity to help himself and then disappears.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_746"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_746">124:10</a> <i>Him who flies the bird:</i> The thief causes his pigeon to fly into a house and then follows it. If he is discovered he pretends he has come for his bird. This is like the excuse of the poacher who, when found trespassing, asserts he is looking for his sheep!</p>
 <p><a name="fn_747"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_747">124:11</a> <i>Him who plays with the strap:</i> The explanation of this trick is as follows: The thief starts a game which consists of one hiding something and asking another to say where it is. If he fails he is beaten on his hand or leg with a strap. Such a game is bound to end in a quarrel which the sharper takes advantage of to appropriate whatever he can.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_748"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_748">125:1</a> <i>Him who gets a meal:</i> Literally, to blow the trumpet, which means to indulge in vain and empty talk. (See Taj al-‘Arús, vi, 301.) In order to obtain this rendering, requiring the reflexive use of the verb, a slight emendation of the text is necessary, for <font color="GREEN">…</font> read <font color="GREEN">…</font> (p. 161, line 1).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_749"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_749">125:2</a> <i>Him who brings a pitcher:</i> As though he had come to fetch water. If he can lay his hands on anything, he steals it. <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>Bastúq:</i> Arabicized from the Persian <font color="GREEN">…</font> or <font color="GREEN">…</font> a small glazed earthenware vessel.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_750"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_750">125:3</a> <i>The master gardeners:</i> The thief represents himself to be an expert gardener. If you employ him he soon begins to help himself to the produce of the garden and this he does without arousing suspicion, because he is thought to have your authority to do so <font color="GREEN">…</font> Gardens: Arabicized from the well-known Persian word <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>Bústán</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_751"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_751">125:4</a> <i>Those who rob through the windows:</i> <font color="GREEN">…</font> plural of <font color="GREEN">…</font> arabicized from the Persian <font color="GREEN">…</font> a hole.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_752"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_752">125:5</a> <i>Him who climbs:</i> By means of a rope.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_753"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_753">125:6</a> <i>Him who comes with a sweet-smelling nosegay:</i> As if he were bringing it as a present to the master. Should he get an opportunity he steals something. The practice of presenting flowers in this way is still common in the East.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_754"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_754">125:7</a> <i>The men of the axe:</i> That is, the policemen. <font color="GREEN">…</font> and <font color="GREEN">…</font> arabicized from the Persian <font color="GREEN">…</font> an axe and <font color="GREEN">…</font> imperative form of <font color="GREEN">…</font> to strike; literally something struck with an axe, or the striker with an axe or a hatchet and then the tool itself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_755"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_755">125:8</a> <i>The possessors of keys:</i> Those who carry about a number of keys with which they endeavour to open doors, boxes, etc.--pickers of locks.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_756"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_756">125:9</a> <i>The men of cotton and wind:</i> The plan is as follows: the thief scatters some cotton so that the wind may blow it into certain houses and then, on the pretext of collecting his cotton, he goes in and robs them. The word <font color="GREEN">…</font> is probably of foreign origin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_757"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_757">126:1</a> <i>When the plunge or dip makes it possible:</i> I think <font color="GREEN">…</font> 'to go deep' would make better sense than <font color="GREEN">…</font> 'to make possible', i.e. when the bathers plunge into the water.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_758"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_758">126:2</a> <i>Him who robs with two sticks:</i> The thief stands upon the roof of his house and lies in wait for the caravan. When it comes opposite the house, he lowers a long stick on the end of which is a hook like a grapnel and pulls up what he can of cloth, etc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_759"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_759">126:3</a> <i>Him who swears to a debt:</i> This is a species of black-mailing. The swindler swears that a certain person of importance owes him money. The latter rather than run the risk of being haled before the Qáḍí pays the amount.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_760"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_760">126:4</a> <i>Him who cheats with the pledge:</i> The rogue buys goods from a merchant and leaves in pledge with him a sealed casket supposed to contain valuable jewels which, of course, it does not.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_761"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_761">126:5</a> <i>Him who gives a bill of exchange:</i> The fraud is perpetrated as follows: The thief sees a traveller with a large sum of money in cash and offers to relieve him of the trouble of carrying it by giving him a bill of exchange on some one in the town to which he is journeying. The bill is, of course, worthless. (<font color="GREEN">…</font>) Arabicized from the Persian <font color="GREEN">…</font> literally, pierced; a consignment made by a person of one country to a person of another.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_762"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_762">126:6</a> <i>Him who changes the purse:</i> The swindler bargains for some goods, produces a purse and counts out in gold or silver a sum which the shopkeeper declines to take, he then puts the purse back into his pocket. The haggling continues, and eventually he persuades the shopkeeper to accept the amount first counted. He then pulls out a purse exactly like the first, but which contains only coppers. If the merchant accepts the purse without counting the contents, the thief makes off with the goods.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_763"></a><a href="mhm38.htm#fr_763">126:7</a> <i>Him who gives to bankrupts:</i> The swindler contrives to secure the confidence of some merchants, takes a quantity of goods and sells them on credit to impecunious traders, at double the prime cost, and leads the public to believe he is doing a flourishing business. Then, when he has sold them articles of the value equal to what he owes his creditors, he announces he has gone bankrupt and that his outstandings represent exactly the amount of his liabilities. In this way he benefits by precisely half the amount of goods he has taken from his creditors.</p>

 <p>This maqáma may be compared to Harírí, xxx, 372, in which we have examples of the cant of beggars, mountebanks, prestigiators and the like. Here Hamadhání gives illustrations of the methods pursued by the fraternity of burglars, thieves, sharpers, swindlers, pickpockets and the like. Cf. Gaubari, <i>Endickte Geheimnisse</i> (von de Goéje Z.D.M.G.), xx, 504.</p>
