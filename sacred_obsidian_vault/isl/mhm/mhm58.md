 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: One day I joined a company like unto the flowers of spring, or the stars of night after the third watch, with bright countenances and agreeable dispositions. They resembled one another in appearance and were alike in good circumstances. And we began to pull the skirts of conversation and to open the doors of debate. Now there was in our midst a youth, short of stature among men, with clipped mustachios, who uttered not a word, nor entered with us into a description, until, finally, the discussion led us to the praise of wealth and its possessors, to the mention of property and its excellence and to the assertion that it is the adornment of men and the goal of perfection. Then, as if he had awoke from a sleep, or presented himself after an absence, he opened his <i>díwán</i>, <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">4</font></a> loosed his tongue, and said: 'Silence! Verily ye have failed in a thing that ye lack; ye have come short in the search of it and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a></p>  
 <p>then despised it. Ye have been cheated out of the eternal by the temporal, and the near <a name="fr_1075"></a><a href="#fn_1075"><font size="1">1</font></a> has preoccupied you to the exclusion of the remote. <a name="fr_1076"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">2</font></a> Is the world other than the camping-ground of a camel-rider, or the hasty meal of the wayfarer? Is wealth aught but a loan to be returned, or a trust to be given up? It is transferred from one people to another, and those who come first hoard it for those who come after. Do ye see wealth with any but the niggards, to the exclusion of the generous? or with the ignorant, to the exclusion of the learned? Beware of delusion, for there is no glory except in one of two directions, and no precedence save in one of two lots, noble pedigree or eminent learning. And how excellent a thing is that whose bearer is borne on people's heads, and whose aspirant despaireth not! By heavens! were it not for the preservation of life and honour, I should have been the richest man on earth. For I know of two treasures, one of them is in the region of Ṭarsus <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">3</font></a> and men's minds crave for it. It belongs to the treasures of the Amalekites and to the stores of the Patricians. <a name="fr_1078"></a><a href="#fn_1078"><font size="1">4</font></a> There are in it a hundred thousand pounds weight. As for the other, it is between Sora <a name="fr_1079"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">5</font></a> and Hilleh. <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">6</font></a> It contains of the treasures of the Persian</p>

 <p>kings <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">1</font></a> and of the hoards of the Tyrants sufficient for mankind and Jinn. Most of it consists of red rubies, pearls and gems, bejewelled crowns and ten thousand talents amassed.' Now when we heard that, we carne before him, leaned towards him, and began to consider his judgement weak in being content with a scanty livelihood in spite of his being aware of these stores. Then he hinted that he was afraid of the Sulṭán and relied upon none of his brethren. So we said: 'We have heard thy argument and we accept thy excuse. Now, if thou wouldst see fit to do us a kindness, to oblige us, and to acquaint us with one of these treasures, on condition that two-thirds shall be thine, do so.' Then he extended his hand towards us and said: 'He who sends something in advance will find it again, and to him who knows what is obtainable the bountiful giving of money is easy.' So each one of us gave him what was ready to hand and was eager for what he had mentioned. Now, when we had filled his palm, he raised his eyes towards us and said: 'We must get a bare sufficiency <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1082"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the means of subsistence and obtain what will maintain strength. <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1083"><font size="1">3</font></a> Our time is short and, if God will, exalted be He! the meeting-place will be here to-morrow.'</p>  
 <p>Said ‘Isá ibn Hishám: When that company dispersed, I sat after them for a while. Then I advanced towards him and seated myself before him and said--and verily I desired to make his acquaintance and my soul longed to converse with him: 'It is as though I knew thy pedigree and had met thee.' He said: 'Yes, a road united us and thou wast my travelling-companion.' So I said: 'Time hath changed thee to me and none made me forget thee except Satan.' <a name="fr_1084"></a><a href="#fn_1084"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then he recited saying:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'I am the tyrant of the time, <a name="fr_1085"></a><a href="#fn_1085"><font size="1">1</font></a> of folly I have many ideas<br> And, when money faileth, I spend from the purse of desires.<br> Whoever desires greedy feeding and deep drinking, to the sound <a name="fr_1086"></a><a href="#fn_1086"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the lute, <a name="fr_1087"></a><a href="#fn_1087"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> And prefers the smooth-faced, oblivious of so and so, and so and so,<br> Thou wilt see him secure against wealth and prosperity.'</dir>

The Khalífa Mamúm died and was buried here in A.H. 218 (August A.D. 833). The ruins of the ancient city are extensive but are deeply buried. (<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, xxvi, 433). The assertion that a treasure lay buried here was, therefore, not inappropriate.</p>
