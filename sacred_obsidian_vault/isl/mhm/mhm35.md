 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was suspected on account of some property I had gotten and so I fled, I knew not whither, until I came to a desert, and my wandering led me to the shade of a tent. I found near the pegs thereof a youth playing in the sand with those of his own age, and reciting a</p>

 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p>poem which was in keeping with his condition but did not accord with his powers of improvisation. <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>And I felt it to be far from him to be able to weave its fabric, so I said: 'Young Arab, dost thou recite or compose this poem?' He said: 'Nay, but I compose it.' Then he recited saying:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'And verily though I be young <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> And the eye disdain me,<br> My demon <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the chief of the <i>Jinn</i><br> And he takes me through all the range of the poetic art,<br> Until he drives away what occurs of doubt.<br> Therefore go at thine ease and depart from me.'</dir>  
 <p>I said: 'O young Arab, terror has brought me to thee. Is there, therefore, safety or hospitality with thee?' He replied: 'Thou hast descended in the very house of safety and alighted on the land of hospitality.' He said: 'Then he arose and seized me by the sleeve and I went with him to a tent whose curtains were lowered.' Then he shouted: 'O damsel of the tribe, here is a neighbour whose country has rejected him, and whose ruler has oppressed him. Fame, which he has heard, or a report, which has reached him, has driven him to us, so give him shelter.' The damsel said: 'Stay, O townsman.'</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'O townsman, stay and fear no ill, <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> For thou art in the house of al-Aswad ibn Qinání<br> The mightiest son of woman from Maa‘d and Ya‘rub,<br> And the most promise-keeping of them in every place.<br> The best striker with the sword among them in defence of his neighbour,<br> And the greatest smiter with the spear in protecting him.<br> It is as though death and bounty were in his hand</dir>

 <p></p><dir>Two clouds connected and combined.<br> Fair of countenance of noble forehead. And, when he mentions his pedigree,<br> It goes back to illustrious Yemeni origin.<br> So go to the house of refuge in which seven have alighted<br> And thou wilt make them the even number eight.' <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">1</font></a></dir>  
 <p>Then the young man took me by the hand to the house which she had indicated. I beheld and lo! there were seven persons in it. But my eye fastened upon none among them except Abú’l-<a href="errata.htm#6">Fatḥ</a> al-Iskanderí. So I said to him: 'Sirrah! in what land art thou?' He recited:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'I have alighted in the house of al-Aswad. <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> I choose the choicest of its fruits.<br> And I said I am a terrified man,<br> Fear hath pursued me for her blood-wit--<br> The device of the likes of me against<br> The likes of him in this and like conditions--<br> Until he clothed me, repairing my need,<br> And removing its manifest signs.<br> So take from Time and get what is pure, <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Before thou art transported from its abode.<br> Beware that thou keep back no desire,<br> Nor permit any milk to remain in the udders <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the camels.'</dir>

 <p>Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: I exclaimed: 'Good gracious! What way of mendicity <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">1</font></a> hast thou not trodden?'</p>  
 <p>Then we lived together in that abode for a season until we were safe from danger, and then he fared eastwards and I westwards.</p>
