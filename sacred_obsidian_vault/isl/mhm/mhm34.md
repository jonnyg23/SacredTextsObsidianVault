 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: when I was in Baṣra I was going proudly along until my walk led me to an open space in which many people were assembled before a man who was standing, admonishing them and saying: 'O people, ye have not been left without control.' <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">6</font></a> Verily joined to to-day is to-morrow. <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">7</font></a> Ye are descending into a deep place, therefore prepare against it what force ye are able. And verily after this life is the judgement, <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">8</font></a> therefore get provisions ready for it. Behold there is no excuse, for the highway has been made clear unto you. God's case against you is clear, <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">9</font></a> by revelation from Heaven and by examples on earth. Lo! Verily He, who with knowledge created the race, maketh the dry bones live.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Is not the world indeed a house of probation and a bridge to cross? He who traverses it is saved, but he who hoards up the world repenteth. Behold it has laid the snare and spread the grain for you. Therefore whoever pastures there will be entrapped, and whoever picks up the grain will be ensnared. Lo! poverty was the garb of your Prophet, <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">1</font></a> therefore wear it; but wealth is the robe of rebellion against God, therefore put it not on. False are the imaginations of the perverters of the truth <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">2</font></a> who have denied the Faith and made the Qur’án discordant. <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">3</font></a> Verily after life is the grave, 'and ye were not created in sport.' <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">4</font></a> Therefore beware of the heat of Hell-fire and hasten to the eternal home. Verily knowledge, whatever its failings, is good, and ignorance is bad under all conditions. Ye are surely the most wretched overshadowed by the heavens if, through you, the learned are in distress, for men are judged by their leaders, and, if the people are led by their influence, <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">5</font></a> they are saved by their responsibility.</p>  
 <p>Men are divided into two classes, the observant scholar and the striving student, as for the rest, they are abandoned ostriches and beasts pasturing at pleasure. Woe to him of high degree commanded by one beneath him, and woe to the knower of something who is ruled by one ignorant of it! I have heard that ‘Alí ibn al-Ḥusain <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">6</font></a> was standing admonishing the people and saying: 'O soul, how long wilt thou rely upon life, and depend upon the world and its building up? Hast thou not taken warning from those of thy ancestors who have passed away, from</p>

 <p>those of thy friends whom the earth has covered up, from those of thy brethren who have been smitten, and from those of thy fellows who have been transported to the house of decay?</p>  
 <p></p><dir>In the bowels of the earth <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">1</font></a> are they after having been upon its back.<br> Their virtues decaying and forgotten therein.<br> Their houses are emptied of them and their enclosures are void,<br> And the Fates have driven them deathwards.<br> They have left the world and what they had collected therein,<br> And under the earth the pits have embraced them.'</dir>  
 <p>How many ages, one after the other, have Death's hands snatched away, and what changes have they produced by their calamities and how many great men have they concealed beneath the dust!</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'And thou art intent upon the world, <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">2</font></a> vying<br> With its suitors for her, covetous and boasting of thy superior substance.<br> Thou goest into danger and art unmindful.<br> Didst thou but understand, wouldst thou not know to what danger thou exposest thyself?<br> And verily the man, who endeavours and strives after this world,<br> And neglects the next, is without doubt a loser.'</dir>  
 <p>Mark the dead nations and defunct kings, how the days overthrew them, and death destroyed them, so that their traces have been obliterated  <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">3</font></a> and but a tale of them remaineth.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'They are decayed in the dust <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">4</font></a> and devoid<br> Of them are the assemblies, and the spacious apartments have become desolate.</dir>

 <p></p><dir>They have left the world and what they had collected therein,<br> And none of them succeeded but the perseveringly patient.<br> And they have alighted in an abode where there is no exchange of visits;<br> For how can there be intercourse between the tenants of the tomb?<br> Thou seest nought but the level grave, in which they abide,<br> And over which the whirlwind carries the dust.'</dir>  
 <p>Many a man hast thou seen possessed of might and power, armies and allies who has gained the world and obtained from it his desire. He built fortresses and castles <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">1</font></a> and collected precious things and forces.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'But the treasures diverted not death's hand <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">2</font></a> when it appeared suddenly desiring him.<br> Nor did the fortresses surrounded by moats and the castles, which he had built, protect him!<br> No device overcame death for him, nor were his armies eager to defend him.'</dir>  
 <p>O people beware! beware! and hasten, O hasten away from the world and her mischiefs, and from the traps she has laid for you, from her appearing in her adornment before you and in her loveliness raising her eyes towards you.</p>  
 <p>'But less affliction than thou seest <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">3</font></a> sufficeth to summon thee to abandon it and to exhort thee to piety.</p>

 <p></p><dir>So strive and be not negligent, for thy life is fleeting, and thou art returning to the abode of death.<br> And seek not the world, for the pursuit of it, even if thou obtainest thy desire from it, injures thee.'</dir>  
 <p>How can a wise man covet, or a sagacious person be pleased with it, when he is sure of its perishing? Do ye not wonder at him who sleeps, while he fears death, and hopeth not for escape?</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Nay, nay, but we delude our own souls <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">1</font></a> and worldly delights preoccupy them to the exclusion of what they apprehended.<br> And how can he enjoy pleasure who is certain of the standing-place of justice where all secret thoughts and actions shall be examined into? <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> It is as though we thought there is no resurrection and that we are left at liberty and that, after dissolution, there is no future state for us.' <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_646"><font size="1">3</font></a></dir>  
 <p>How many of those, who have inclined towards it, hath the world deceived, and many a one of those intent upon it has fallen, and it raised him not from his stumbling, <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">4</font></a> nor excused him for his falling. It healed him not of his sickness, nor relieved him of his pain.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Rather has it brought him down, <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">5</font></a> after his possessing might and rank,<br> To evil watering-places from which there is no climbing out. <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">6</font></a><br> So when he saw there was no escape, and that</dir>

 <p></p><dir>It was death, from which the helpers could not save him,<br> He sought repentance, if length of repentance could avail him,<br> And his heinous crimes caused him to weep.'</dir>  
 <p>He wept over his past sins, and felt regret for what he was leaving of the world, when weeping profited him not, and excuse delivered him not.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'His sorrows and cares encompassed him, <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And, when excuses baffled him, he despaired. <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Therefore he hath no saviour from the pains of death,<br> Nor helper from that which is avoided.<br> His throat rattled <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">3</font></a> before death,<br> While the uvula and the larynx re-echoed it.'</dir>  
 <p>How long wilt thou mend thy present condition at the expense of thy future state, and, in so doing, ride upon thy desire? Verily I perceive thee to be weak in assurance, O patcher of thy present condition with thy religion. Has the merciful God commanded thee to do this, or the Qur’án guided thee so?</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Thou destroyest that which remaineth, <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">4</font></a> and buildest that which perisheth,<br> But neither is this complete nor that abiding.<br> If then thy end come suddenly upon thee,<br> When thou hast acquired no good, hast thou an excuser with God?<br> Art thou content that life should pass and end,<br> While thy religion is deficient and thy wealth complete?'</dir>  
 <p>Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: I asked one of those present: 'Who is this?' He replied: 'A stranger who arrived by night? I</p>

 <p>know him not personally, so wait for the end of his discourse, <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">1</font></a> perhaps he will tell his name.' So I waited. Then he said: 'Adorn knowledge with practice and show gratitude for power by practising forgiveness. Take the clear and leave the muddy. <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">2</font></a> May God forgive you and me!' Then he started off. So I followed in his track and said to him: 'O Shaikh, who art thou?' He replied: 'Good Gracious! art thou not satisfied with pondering over externals, that thou madest for the truth and then failed to recognize it? <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">3</font></a> I am Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskánderí.'</p>  
 <p>I said: 'May God preserve thee, but what is this hoariness?' He answered:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'A warner, but a silent one, <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> And a guest, but a gloating one,<br> The messenger of death, but<br> Verily he will stay on <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">5</font></a> till I accompany him.'  <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">6</font></a></dir>
