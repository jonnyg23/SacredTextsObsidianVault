 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in Baghdad in a famine year, <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">4</font></a> and so I approached a company, united  <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">5</font></a> like the Pleiades, in order to ask something of them. Now there was among them a youth with a lisp in his tongue and a space between his front teeth. He asked: 'What is thy affair?' <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">6</font></a> I replied: 'Two conditions in which a man prospers not: that of a beggar harassed by hunger, and that of an exile to whom return is impossible.' The boy then said: 'Which of the two breaches dost thou wish stopped first?' I answered: 'Hunger, for it has become extreme with me.' He said: 'What sayest thou to a white cake on a clean table, picked herbs with very sour vinegar, fine date-wine with pungent mustard, roast meat ranged on a skewer with a little salt, placed now before thee by one who will not put thee off with a promise nor torture thee with delay, and who will afterwards follow it up <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">7</font></a> with golden goblets of the juice of the grape? Is that preferable to thee, or a large company, full cups, variety of dessert, spread carpets, brilliant lights, and a skilful minstrel with the eye and neck of a gazelle?</p>

The boy said: 'And so am I their servant, if they were only present.' I then said: 'May God not bless thee! Thou hast revived desires which despair had destroyed, and now thou hast gripped their palate. <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">4</font></a> From which ruins dost thou hail?'
