 <p>SAID ‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM: One day, joined to a small company of friends bound together in friendship, like the Pleiades, <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">2</font></a> I alighted <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the cathedral mosque of Bukhára. Now, when the mosque was filled with its congregation, there appeared before us one clad in a pair of worn-out garments. <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">4</font></a> He had slung his empty wallet over his shoulder, and was bringing behind him a naked boy whose endurance was straitened by calamity, while the cold anon gripped him and let 'him go. <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">5</font></a> He possessed no covering but his own skin and had nought that sufficed to protect him from a single shivering. The man stood and said: 'None will regard this child except him to whom God has been gracious, and none will be moved to pity by this misfortune but him who is not secure from the like. O possessors of famous fortunes, embroidered robes, lofty houses, and strongly built castles, ye will not be secure from accident, nor will heirs fail you. Hasten then to do good, while ye can and be bounteous unto the world as long as it is bounteous unto you. For, by Heavens! we have eaten "sikbáj", <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">6</font></a> ridden the fleet-footed camel, donned brocaded silk <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">7</font></a> and slept on stuffed couches in the evenings.</p>

 <p>Then, before we knew it, came fortune's treacherous blast and the turning of the back of the shield. Then the fleet camel was changed for the slow short-paced steed, the brocade for wool, and so on until I am reduced to the state and garb in which ye see me. Behold we seek sustenance from barren fortune's breast and ride poverty's sombre steed. We gaze not but with the orphan's eye and stretch forth only the debtor's hands. Now is there any generous one who will dispel the blackness <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">1</font></a> of this want and blunt the edge of this misfortune?' Then he sat down leaning upon his elbows, and he said to the boy: 'Attend to thy business.' The boy said: 'What can I say when this thy speech, did it but come in contact with hair, would clip it, or with a rock would cleave it. Verily a heart not rendered tender by what thou hast said is tough indeed. Ye have heard, O people, what ye have never heard before to-day. Let each one of you engage his hand with charity. Let him think of his own future and shield, through me, his own child. Remember me, <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">2</font></a> and I will remember you and give unto me and I will thank you.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám, 'In my loneliness I had nought that solaced me but a ring which I placed upon his little finger. <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">3</font></a> As soon as he got it he recited praising, the ring upon the finger, saying:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>O the encircled with itself, <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> With a necklace like unto the Gemini in beauty!<br> Like a lover meeting his friend,<br> And then lovingly and pathetically embraces him.<br> Selecting one not of his own tribe,<br> As an ally against fate.<br> A precious thing whose worth is exalted,<br> Yet, verily, more exalted is he who gave it.<br> I swear, if in glory men were words,<br> Thou wouldst be their meaning.' <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">5</font></a></dir>  
 <p>Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: So we gave him what was easy of attainment at once, and then he turned away from us praising us.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> I followed him, until privacy revealed his face and lo! it was our Shaikh Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí, and behold the fawn was his child. I said; 'Abú’l-Fatḥ, thou hast grown old <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the boy grown up; 'What of the word of greeting and of converse?'</p>  
 <p>He answered:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'A stranger am I <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">2</font></a> when the road doth contain us,<br> A friend when the tents do enclose us.'</dir>  
 <p>By this I knew he was averse to conversing with me, so I left him and went away.</p>
