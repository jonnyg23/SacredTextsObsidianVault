 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: A pressing need impelled me to go to Sijistán. <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">2</font></a> So I put my resolution into effect <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">3</font></a> and mounted the necessary camel. I sought God's blessing upon my determination which I set before me, while I made prudence my guide until it directed me thither. Now I arrived at the gates of the city after sunset and was, therefore, obliged to pass the night on the spot. <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now, when the blade of dawn was drawn, and the host of the sun sallied forth, I went to the business quarter to select a lodging. And when I had gone from the circumference <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">5</font></a> of the city to its centre, and walked along the circle of shops</p>

 <p>till I reached the chief one, <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">1</font></a> a loud-toned <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">2</font></a> voice penetrated my ear. I went towards the speaker until I stood near him, and behold it was a man mounted on his horse and panting for breath. <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">3</font></a> He had turned the back of his head towards me and was saying: He . who knows me, knows me well, and he, who does not know me, I will make myself known to him. I am the first-fruits of Yemen, <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">4</font></a> the much-talked-of of the age, the enigma of men and the puzzle of the ladies of the harem. <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">5</font></a> Ask of me concerning countries and their fortresses, mountains and their heights, valleys and their watercourses, seas and their springs, horses and their backs. Who has captured their walls, discovered the mysteries of their heights, explored their paths and penetrated into their lava hills? Ask of kings and their treasures, precious stones and their mines, <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">6</font></a> affairs and their inwardness, <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">7</font></a> sciences and their centres, weighty matters and their obscurities, wars and their difficult situations. Who has seized their hoards without paying the price? Who has got possessions of their keys <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">8</font></a> and known the way to victory? By Heavens! it is I who have achieved all that. I have made</p>

 <p>peace between powerful kings <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">1</font></a> and disclosed the mysteries of dark difficulties. By Heavens! I have been even in the place where lovers are overthrown. I have even been afflicted with sickness, even the sickness caused by the languishing eye. <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">2</font></a> I have embraced supple forms, <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">3</font></a> and plucked the rose from the crimson cheeks. Yet, with all this, I have fled from the world as a generous nature flees from the faces of the base. I have recoiled from despicable things as a noble ear recoils from obscene language. But, now that the morn of hoariness has dawned, and the dignity of old age has come upon me, I have resolved to make wise provision for my journey to the next world and I have not perceived any way better to right guidance, than that which I am treading. One of you will observe me riding a horse and speaking at random <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">4</font></a> and say, 'this is the Father of Wonder', <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">5</font></a> nay, but I am indeed the Father of Wonders, which I have both seen and experienced, and the Mother of Enormities which I have estimated and endured. I have with difficulty obtained the keys of treasures <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">6</font></a> and then have lightly cast them aside. I have bought dear and sold cheap. I have, by Heavens! joined their pageants and jostled against shoulders. I have watched the stars <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">7</font></a> and ridden the flesh off my mounts, I have been obliged to engage in dangerous enterprises vowing not to withhold from the Muslims the benefits accruing therefrom. Now I must transfer the cord of this trust from my neck to yours and offer for sale in your streets this medicine of mine. Let him buy from me who shrinks not from the place</p>

 <p>where God's servants stand, nor from the formula of unity. And let him who is of proud pedigree <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">1</font></a> and good breeding <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">2</font></a> preserve the remedy. Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: I went round in front of him that I might learn who he was, and by Heavens! it was our Shaikh Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí. So I waited for the crowd to disperse <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">3</font></a> from before him, and then addressing him</p>  
 <p>I asked: 'How big an opening will this nostrum of thine want?' He answered, 'Thy purse will open as much as thou desirest.' I then left him and departed. <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_179"></a><a href="mhm12.htm#fr_179">35:2</a> <i>Sijistán:</i> originally Sagistan, the land of the Sakas, Arabicized to Sijistan, the ancient Sacastane and the modern Seistan, the name of a district of Persia and of its chief town. The capital was formerly called Zaranj. It formed a part of the empire of the Khalífa and was a great Khárijite centre. About A.D. 860, when it had undergone many changes of Government under lieutenants of the Baghdad Khalífa, or bold adventurers acting on their own account, Yaqút ibn Laith al-Saffar, made it the seat of his power. In A.D. 901, it fell under the power of the Sámanids and towards the end of the century into that of the Ghaznavids. In Hamadhání's time Khalaf ibn Aḥmad was the Amír of Sijistán (A.H. 354-93). Yaqút says that when the inhabitants submitted to their Arab conquerors they stipulated that no hedgehog was to be killed. The reason assigned for this being that the country was infested with snakes and that the hedgehogs kept the number down. Every house had its hedgehog!
