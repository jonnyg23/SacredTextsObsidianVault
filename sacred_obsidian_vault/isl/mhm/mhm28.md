 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: While I was in the city of Peace, <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">1</font></a> returning from the Sacred Territory, <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">2</font></a> I was swaggering along, with the swaggering of pedestrians, on the bank of the Tigris, observing those rare sights and closely examining those embellishments until, suddenly, I reached a ring of men crowding together, excitement agitating their heads <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">3</font></a> and laughter exploding <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">4</font></a> their cheeks. Curiosity impelled me to do what it had driven them to do, till I stood within earshot of the voice of a man without being able to see his face, because of the intensity of the thronging and the excessiveness of the crowding, and behold! it was a monkey-trainer causing his monkey to dance and making those near him to laugh. So I bounded as bounds the well-trained hound, <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">5</font></a> and went forward, after the manner of one lame, over the necks of the people. This one's shoulder throwing me in that one's stomach, <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">6</font></a> until I made the beards of two men my carpet and sat down after much fatigue. <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">7</font></a> And verily shame choked me with its spittle and the straitness of the place distressed me. When the monkey-trainer had finished his performance and the place of assembly divested itself of its people, I arose, and verily terror had clothed me in its garb, and I stood up that I might see his face, and lo! by Heavens! it was Abú’l-Fatḥ, al-Iskanderí.

Al-Manṣúr is said to have called Baghdad the city of Peace--Madína al-Salám--because the Tigris had been previously called the valley and river of Peace.
