 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I was returning from Yemen and making for my native land, a fellow-traveller joined me with his baggage and we journeyed together for three days, until the highland attracted me, and the lowland swallowed him. So I ascended and he descended. I fared eastwards and he went westwards, but I regretted separating from him after the mountain and its ruggedness took possession of me, and the vale and its depth seized him.</p>  
 <p>'By Heavens! separation from him left me desiring him, and he left me suffering from his absence after him. Now when I parted from him, he was a man of wealth and beauty, of goodly appearance and perfection. Well, Time dealt us its</p>

 <p>blows, but I pictured him to myself at all times, and called him to mind every moment, and I did not think Time would help me to him or through him, till I carne to Shiráz.</p>  
 <p>'Now one day, while I was in my chamber, <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">1</font></a> suddenly there appeared before me an old man, whose countenance poverty had marred, <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">2</font></a> whose lustre Time had entirely exhausted, whose erectness <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">3</font></a> disease had bent, and whose nails destitution had clipped; with a face more wretched than his actual state, and a garb more dreadful than his condition, with dry gums and parched lips, muddy feet, with a blistered hand, <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">4</font></a> with canine teeth that misfortune had destroyed, and a bitter existence. And he saluted me. My eye disdained him, but I returned his greeting. So he said: 'O God make us better than we are suspected to be.' Therefore I smoothed out for him the wrinkles of my face, <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">5</font></a> opened my ear to him and said: 'Proceed <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">6</font></a> with thy story!' Then he said: 'I have suckled thee on the breast of covenant, and shared with thee the rein of protection <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">7</font></a> and, in the opinion of the wise, acquaintance is sacred and friendship is kinship.' I then said: 'Art thou a fellow-townsman, or a fellow-tribesman?' He said: 'Nought unites us save the land of exile, and nothing binds us together but the relationship of neighbourhood.' Then I asked: 'Which road bound us both with one cord?' He replied: 'The road to Yemen.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: So I asked: 'Art thou Abú’l Fatḥ al-Iskanderí?' He replied: 'I am that person.' I said:</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'How thin thou art become since parting from me, and thou hast changed beyond my recognition; therefore lay before me thy whole case and the cause of thy disordered condition.' He said: 'I have married a beautiful woman of base stock, <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_791"><font size="1">1</font></a> and I am afflicted with a daughter by her. So because of her I am in affliction, and she has despoiled me of my living and sapped my youthful vigour.' I said: 'Why dost thou not absolutely divorce her and be at rest?' <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
