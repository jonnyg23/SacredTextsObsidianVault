 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I was coming back from the Pilgrimage with those who were returning, and I alighted at Ḥulwán <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">3</font></a> with those who alighted, I said to my slave: 'I find my hair is long and my body somewhat dirty, <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">4</font></a> so chose for us a bath that we may enter it, and a barber whom we may make use of. Let the bath be of spacious yard, of clean locality, of pure atmosphere and the water of moderate temperature; and let the barber be deft of hand, with a sharp razor and clean dress, and little given to gossip.' So he went out for a long time, <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">5</font></a> returned late, and said: 'I have chosen it as thou described it.' Then we took the direction of the bath and arrived there, but we did not see the keeper. But I went in, and there entered in my track a man who betook himself to a lump of clay, besmeared my forehead with it, and then placed it on my head. Then he went out, and in came another and he began to rub me with a rubbing that grazed my bones, to knead</p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a></p>  
 <p>me <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">1</font></a> with a kneading which crushed my joints, and to whistle with a whistling that scattered spittle. He next aimed at my head to wash it, and at the water to pour it. Then without delay the first entered and greeted the branch of the occipital artery of the second with a blow of his clenched fist that made his canine teeth rattle, and he said: 'Wretch! what hast thou to do with this head when it is mine?' Then the second turned on the first with a blow of his fist that destroyed his dignity, <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">2</font></a> and he said: 'Nay, but this head is my right, my property, and is in my hands.' Then they fought each other with fisticuffs till they were both exhausted, and, then, with what life was left, they summoned each other to arbitration and came to the keeper of the bath. And the first said: 'I am the owner of this head for I besmeared its forehead and placed upon it its clay.' The second asserted: 'Nay, but I am its owner, for I rubbed its bearer and kneaded his joints.' Said the keeper of the bath: 'Bring me the possessor of the head and I will ask him, "Is this thy head or his?"' So they both came to me and said: 'We want thy evidence, therefore undertake the duty and impose upon thyself the task.' <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">3</font></a> So I arose and went willy nilly. Said the keeper of the bath: 'Man, speak nothing but the truth and witness nought but the fact, and tell me to which of the two belongs this head?' I replied: 'God bless thee! <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">4</font></a> this is my head, it has accompanied me upon the road, and encompassed the Ancient House <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">5</font></a> with me, and I have never doubted but that it was mine.' He said: 'Silence! garrulous fellow;' and then turned to one of the disputants and said: 'Sirrah! how long this contending with the people for this head? Be satisfied, so valueless is it, let it go instead to</p>

 <p>the curse of God and the heat of His hell. Suppose that this head was not, and that we have never seen this he-goat.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'I arose from that place mortified, put on my clothes in terror, and quickly slipped away from the bath. And I reviled the slave with evil-speaking and contumely and pounded him after the manner of the pounding of gypsum.' <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">1</font></a> Then I said to another: 'Go and fetch me a barber to remove from me this load; <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">2</font></a> and he brought me a man of delicate build, agreeable make, like an image,' and I took to him quickly. Then he came in and said: 'Peace be to thee! From which town art thou?' I replied: 'Qúm'. <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">3</font></a> He said: 'May God prosper thee! From a land of plenty and comfort, the city of the Sunnís. <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">4</font></a> I was present there in its cathedral mosque in the month of Ramaḍán when the lamps had been lit and the <i>taráwiḥ</i> <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">5</font></a> prayers were inaugurated, but, before we knew it, the Nile rose and came and extinguished those lights, but God made me a shoe which I put on when it was green, but there was no embroidery produced on its sleeve. And the boy</p>

 <p>returned to his mother, after I had performed the evening prayer <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">1</font></a> when the shadow is equal. <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">2</font></a> But how was thy pilgrimage? Didst thou perform all its ceremonies as was incumbent? And they cried out: "A marvel! a marvel!" So I looked at the beacon, and how light a thing is war--to the spectators! And I found the <i>Harísah</i> <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the same state, and I knew that the matter was decreed and pre-ordained by God. And how long this vexation? And to-day, and to-morrow, and Saturday and Sunday, but I will not be tedious, but what is this prating? And I like thee to know that Mubarrad <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">4</font></a> in grammar wields a keen razor, so do not occupy thyself with the speech of the common people. Now if ability preceded action, <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">5</font></a> I should have shaved thy head. Dost thou consider it advisable that we begin?' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'I was bewildered at his fluency with his malaprop loquacity, and I feared he might prolong his sitting, so I said: "Till to-morrow, if God will." Then I asked those present concerning him, and they said: "This is a man from the country of Alexandria, this climate has disagreed with him and madness has overtaken him, so that</p>

 <p>he babbles the whole day, as you observe, but behind him there is much excellence." I said, "I have heard of him, and his madness grieves me." Then I recited and said:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>"I make a firm promise <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">1</font></a> to God in a binding vow,<br> I will not shave my head as long as I live, even though I suffer inconvenience."'</dir>

 <p><a name="fn_804"></a><a href="mhm41.htm#fr_804">133:4</a> <i>The city of the Sunnís:</i> Literally, of the practice and the agreement. The point here is that the people of Qum were exclusively Shí‘ah, there was not a Sunní in the city. (See Yaqút, iv, 175.) 'And all its inhabitants are Shí‘ah of the Imámí sect?' <font color="GREEN">…</font> Also de Goeji, <i>Collection of Arabian Geographers</i>, id, 259, line 7 where Ibn Ḥauqal, a contemporary of the author, says: 'Shí’sm prevails at Qum'; also see Letters, p. 423. This is the first of a number of amazing malapropisms.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_805"></a><a href="mhm41.htm#fr_805">133:5</a> <i>Taráwiḥ prayers:</i> A form of prayer performed at some period during the night in the month of Ramadan, after the ordinary prayer of nightfall, consisting of twenty or more <i>rak’as</i>, according to the different persuasions, so called because the performer rests after each <font color="GREEN">…</font> which consists of four <i>rak’as</i>, or because they used to rest between every two pairs of salutations. (Lane, <i>Lexicon</i>, p. 1183; See also Letters, p. 424.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_806"></a><a href="mhm41.htm#fr_806">134:1</a> <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>The evening prayer:</i> Literally, the first part or third of the night. after the setting of the light of the <font color="GREEN">…</font> and the time of the prayers of nightfall; but the calling of that prayer the prayer of the <font color="GREEN">…</font> as the Arabs of the desert named it, instead of calling it <font color="GREEN">…</font> is forbidden by the Shafa’í code (<i>Minhadj at-Ṭalibin</i>, ii, 61). Hence the malapropism.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_807"></a><a href="mhm41.htm#fr_807">134:2</a> <i>When the shadow is equal:</i> Another malapropism.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_808"></a><a href="mhm41.htm#fr_808">134:3</a> <i>Al-Harísah:</i> A kind of thick pottage prepared of cooked bruised wheat, fleshmeat, butter, almonds, vegetables, etc. (See Mas‘údí, viii, 402-3.) It is said to have been invented by the Sásánians and to have been the favourite dish of Anushirwán.</p>

(Macdonald, <i>Muslim Theology</i>, p. 310.) This was how the orthodox disposed of the doctrine of free will. On the other hand, the partisans of the Freedom of the Will maintained that the ability to do is always present. It is possible that Hamadhání may have been aware of the Aristotelian treatment of the question of ἐνεργεια and δυναμις. Translations of Aristotle's works were to be found in the library of the Ṣáḥib to which the author probably had free access during his stay at the Wazír's court from A.H. 380.</p>
