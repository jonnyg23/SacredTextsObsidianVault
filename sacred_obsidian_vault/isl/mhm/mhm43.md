 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I lost some camels of mine and I went forth in search of them. I alighted in a verdant valley and behold there were running brooks, <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">3</font></a> tall trees, ripe fruits, blossoming flowers and broad plains, and lo! an old man was seated there. Now that which terrifies a solitary person from his like made me afraid of him, but he said: 'Have no fear.' Then I saluted him and he ordered me to sit down, and I obeyed. Then he asked me concerning my condition and I informed him. Then he said to me: 'Thou hast got thy guide and found thy stray. Dost thou recite anything of the poems of the Arabs?' I answered: 'Yes,' and I recited from Imr-al-Qais, ‘Obeid, Labíd, and Ṭarafa. But he was not pleased with anything of that and he asked: 'Shall I repeat some of my poetry?' I said to him: 'Produce it.' Then he recited:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'The co-partners have separated, <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">4</font></a> but had I obeyed, they would not have parted.<br> And they have severed our cords from the bonds of union,'</dir>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p>until he went over the whole qaṣída. I said: 'O Shaikh! this is Jarír's poem, the boys have conned it, the women know it, it has entered the tents and reached the assemblies.' He said: 'Stop this but if thou dost know a poem of Abú Núwás repeat it to me.' So I recited to him</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'I will not lament over the deserted abode, <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Nor will I yearn after the drivers of the white camels.<br> The dwelling most worthy of abandonment is that one;<br> In which union with the beloved is not long enjoyed. <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> What a splendid night was that which is past. How delightful it was!<br> When the cups took effect upon our haughty brethren;<br> And a young gazelle <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">3</font></a> whose eye spoke enchantment,<br> Girded with a girdle, <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">4</font></a> an ally of the rosary and sanctification.<br> I strove with him for a kiss, and the wine was pure and ruddy,<br> In the garb of a Qáḍí and with the piety of Shaikh Iblís. <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> When we became intoxicated, and all the people were drunk,<br> And I feared his overthrowing me with the cups,<br> I snored, feigning slumber, that I might put him to sleep,</dir>

 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>And both his eyeballs clad themselves with sleep from my bag.<br> Then he stretched himself on a couch which was finer to me,<br> In spite of its disordered condition, than the throne of Balqís <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">1</font></a>,<br> And I visited his sleeping-place before the dawn,<br> And when the sound of the church bells <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">2</font></a> indicated the morning.<br> So he asked, "Who is that?" I answered:<br> "The priest has come. <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> And thy convent <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">4</font></a> must be ministered <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">5</font></a> by the priest." <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">6</font></a><br> He said: "By my life thou art a vile sort of a man."<br> But I said: 'Never! I am not one to be blamed."'</dir>  
 <p>He related: 'Then he rejoiced, cried out and shouted.' So I said: 'God disfigure thee for an old man! I know not whether thou be more stupid in arrogating to thyself Jarír's poetry, or in thy delight at the poem of Abú Núwás who is a libertine <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">7</font></a> and a vagabond.' He said: 'Stop this! Go thy way</p>

 <p>and when thou dost meet on the road a man with a leathern bottle, who goes about in the houses, around the cooking-pots, boasts of his form and glories in his beard, say to him: "Direct me to a bound fish in a sea, slender in the waist, that stings like a wasp, and turbans with light." His father is a stone, his mother a male. Gold is his head and flame is his name, and the rest of him is tail. He acts upon clothes with ṭhe action of the moth. In the house he is the bane of the oil, a greedy drinker never satisfied, and a glutton never sated. A bountiful giver whom none forbids; he climbs the acclivity, and his property does not decrease through generosity. What pleases him grieves thee, and what benefits thee injures him. I was going to conceal from thee my story and live with thee in comfort, but thou didst refuse, now hear the truth. <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">1</font></a> There is not a poet <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">2</font></a> but has a helper from among us. And I dictated this qaṣída to Jarír. I am the Shaikh Abd Múrrah.' <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">3</font></a> Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'Then he vanished and I saw him not. And I went on headlong and met a man with a fly-whisk <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">4</font></a> in his hand. I said to myself, <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">5</font></a> "By Heavens! this is my man." So I told him what I had heard of him. Then he handed me a lamp, pointed to a dark cave in the mountain and said: "There is the cave and thou hast with thee the lamp."' He related: 'I entered it and behold I found my camels and they had taken the other direction, but I turned their heads and drove them back. Now, while I was in that situation in the wood, creeping stealthily through the thicket, lo! Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí met me with a greeting.' I said to him: 'Sirrah! what has driven thee to this place?' He answered: 'The injustice of the days in decisions, and the non-existence of generous men.' I said: 'O Abú’l-Fatḥ, give then thy command.' He said: 'Bear me</p>

 <p>on a young she-camel, and supply me with some provisions.' <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">1</font></a> I said: 'That is thine.' Then he recited and said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'My soul a ransom <a name="fr_856"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">2</font></a> for the man who gave me the choice.<br> I tasked him extremely, but he was generous.<br> He scratched not his beard, he wiped not his nose and he did not cough.'</dir>  
 <p>Then I told him the story of the old man, whereupon he pointed to his turban and said: 'This is the fruit of his benevolence.' I exclaimed: 'O Abú’l-Fatḥ, hast thou begged from the devil? Thou art indeed a mighty mendicant.'</p>
