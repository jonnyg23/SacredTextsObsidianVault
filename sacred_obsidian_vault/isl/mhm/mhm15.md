 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to me and said: 'While we were at Jurján in a meeting-place of ours discussing, there was with us</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>that chief scholar and narrator of the Arabs, ‘Ismat ibn Badr, the Fazárite'. <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">1</font></a> The conversation finally led us to discuss those who pardon their enemies out of gentleness and those who forgive them out of contempt, till we mentioned As-Ṣalatan, al-‘Abdí, <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">2</font></a> and al-Ba‘ith, <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">3</font></a> and the contempt of Jarír and al-Farazdaq for them.</p>  
 <p>Said ‘Ismat: 'I will relate to you what mine eyes have seen and not what I have got from another. When I was journeying in the country of Tamím, mounted on a noble camel and leading a spare mount, there appeared before me a rider on a dusky camel, frothing thickly at the mouth. He continued to advance towards me till our bodies collided, <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">4</font></a> when he shouted: "Peace be unto you!" I said, "And upon thee peace and the mercy and blessing of God! Who is the loud-voiced rider who salutes with the salutation of Islám?" He answered: "I am Ghailan, ibn ‘Uqba." So I said: Welcome to him of fair renown and famous lineage whose diction is well-known." He replied: "Broad be thy valley and powerful thy associates! but who art thou? I answered, "I am ‘Ismat ibn Badr, the Fazárite." He said, "May God prolong thy life! What an excellent friend, associate and companion!" Then we travelled together. When we had journeyed on till noon, <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">5</font></a> he said: "Ísmat, shall we not take a nap, for the sun has melted our brain? I said: "As thou wilt." Se we moved in the direction of</p>

 <p>some <i>āla</i> trees as though they were maidens <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">1</font></a> with their hair down, displaying their charms, and to a collection of tamarisk trees opposite to them. Then we unsaddled and partook of some food. Now Dhú'l-Rumma was a small eater. After that we prayed. Then each of us betook himself to the shade of a tamarisk tree, intending to take the noonday nap. Dhú’l-Rumma lay down and I desired to do as he did. So I lay on my back, but no sleep took possession of my eyes. I looked and saw a short distance of a large-humped camel, jaded by the sun, with her saddle thrown off, and behold a man like a hireling, or slave was standing guarding her. But I turned away from them, for what had I to do with enquiring about that which did not concern me? Dhú’l-Rumma slept for a little <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">2</font></a> while and then awoke. Now this was in the days of his satirizing the tribe of Murrí, so he raised his voice, <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">3</font></a> and recited saying:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>"Are the traces of Maiya <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">4</font></a> to be found on the obliterated surface of the sand dune<br> Which the gale has persistently covered up?<br> Nought remains but a battered tent-peg,<br> And a fireplace without a fire-taker,<br> A cistern with both sides broken,</dir>

 <p></p><dir>And an assembly whose traces have been removed and effaced.<br> But I remember it with its inhabitants,<br> Maiya and the sociable friend.<br> My relations with Maiya were like those of one who scares,<br> Gazelles when they appear to him at the dawn; <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> When I would come to her, there turned me away a sulky-faced watcher, her guardian and keeper.<br> There will soon reach Imr al-Qais <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">2</font></a> a widely circulated poem<br> Which traveller and stay-at-home will sing.<br> Dost thou not see that to Imr al-Qais<br> Clings his chronic complaint?<br> They are a people insensible to satire,<br> But can the dry stone feel pain? <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> In eminence no knight have they, in war no horseman.<br> Besmeared and saturated are they in the cisterns of reproach,<br> As the hide is saturated by the tanner.<br> When men look to them for the performance of generous deeds,<br> Downcast and heavy are their eyes.<br> The noble abhor marrying their women,<br> And therefore all their spinsters <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">4</font></a> "remain old maids."</dir>

 <p>When he got as far as this verse, the sleeper awoke, began to rub his eyes and to say: "Does little Dhú al-Rumma <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">1</font></a> deprive me of sleep with an incorrect <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">2</font></a> and unpopular poem?" I said: "O Ghailan, who is this?" He replied: "al-Farazdaq?" Then Dhú al-Rumma waxed hot and said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>"As for the base men of Majásh‘a <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Never has the thunder-cloud watered their pastures.<br> Soon they will be fettered and restrained from noble enterprises,<br> And the restrainer shall restrain them!"</dir>  
 <p>Then I said: "Now he will choke and fret and thoroughly lampoon him and his tribe."</p>  
 <p>But by Heavens! al-Farazdaq only said: "Fie on thee little Dhú al-Rumma dost thou oppose one like me with stolen verses?" <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">4</font></a> Then he went to sleep again, as though he had not heard anything. Dhú al-Rumma went away and I went with him, and verily I perceived in him humiliation until we parted.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_258"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_258">46:6</a> Abú’l-Ḥaríth Ghailan Ibn ‘Uqba Ibn Buhaish, generally known by the surname of Dhú’l-Rumma (the old-rope man) is regarded as the last of the Bedawín poets. He died in A.H. 117 (A.D. 735-6) and was therefore a contemporary of Jarír and Farazdaq, see Ibn Khallikan, ii, 447, and Ibn Qutaiba, <i>Kitáb al-Sh‘ir wa’l-Shu‘ará</i> (De Geoje), p. 333. (The University Press of Cambridge is publishing for the first time an edition of this poet's work. The editor is Mr. C. H. H. Macartney of Clare College, Cambridge.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_259"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_259">47:1</a> <i>‘Ismat ibn Badr the Fazárite:</i> I think this character may be identified with Abú ‘Abdu’lláh Marwán ibn Mu‘awiyah ibn Badr al-Fazárí (d. 193 or A.H. 194). Among those who learned traditions from him was Ibn Ḥanbal (A.H. 164-241) <i>Ansab of al-Sam‘áni</i>, p. 427, Gibb Memorial Series.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_260">47:2</a> <i>As-Ṣalatan, al-‘Abdí</i> was a contemporary of al-Farazdaq and Jarír as the following incident shows: 'When as-Salatan, al-‘Abdí pronounced al-Farazdaq superior to Jarír in point of lineage, and Jarír superior to al-Farazdaq as poet, Jarír reported with this proverb:</p>

 <p>'When was God's wisdom in husbandmen and possessors of palm trees?' (Freytag, Arab Proverb, ii, 628; Lane, p. 2602 art <font color="GREEN">…</font>) The point of this lies in the fact that the region of as-Ṣalatan's tribe abounded in palm trees.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_261"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_261">47:3</a> <i>Al-Ba’ith:</i> a contemporary of Jarír. He was one of those who had the temerity to satire the great poet's tribe, the Kulayb. <i>Aghání</i>, vii, 41.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_262">47:4</a> <i>Bodies collided:</i> Literally, form with form.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_265">48:2</a> <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>A little:</i> Literally, paucity of milk of a camel and then applied to paucity of sleep in which latter sense it is used by al-Farazdaq, <font color="GREEN">…</font> Their sleep is little (Lane, p. 2239, art <font color="GREEN">…</font>) Cf. <i>Arab Proverbs</i>, i, 613: <font color="GREEN">…</font> His abundant milk flow preceded his paucity thereof.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_266"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_266">48:3</a> <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>He raised his voice:</i> Perhaps originally connected with Heb. ‏קרר‎. For similar examples of transposition Cf. Arabic <font color="GREEN">…</font> = Heb. ‏רקע‎; Arabic <font color="GREEN">…</font> = Heb. ‏קרע‎.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_267">48:4</a> <i>In the days of his satirizing the tribe of Murrí:</i> The occasion of this bitter satire was the inhospitable treatment of Dhú’l-Rumma by Hishám al-Murr‘í at the village at Mar’at. See <i>Aghání</i>, vii, 57.</p>  
 <p><i>Are the traces of Maiya to be found</i>. Metre, <i>mutaqárib</i>. <i>Maiya</i>--The beloved of Dhú’l-Rumma whose beauty he often extolled in his poems, see Ibn Qutaibas Sh‘ir wa Shu‘ará, p. 334. Mr. Macartney, the editor of Dhú’l-Rumma's Diwán, to whose courtesy I am indebted for much useful information regarding this poet, says, 'although these verses put into the mouth of Dhú’l-Rumma do not exist in the MSS. of the Diwán, still they have a genuine ring and the ideas have their correspondences in the Diwán.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_268"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_268">49:1</a> <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>dawn:</i> Literally, the sneezer; also a gazelle coming before one.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_269"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_269">49:2</a> <i>Soon there will reach Imr al-Qais:</i> This refers to the tribe of Imr al-Qais, a branch of the Tamím descended from Imr al-Qais ibn Sa‘ad ibn Manát ibn Tamím, and not to the poet of the tribe of Kindeh.</p>  
 <p>This Qaṣída begins with the conventional erotic prologue over the deserted encampment of the beloved, a prelude which was condemned in the poet's own day. It is related that, as Dhú al-Rumma was reciting his verses in the camel market, he said to al-Farazdaq who stopped to hear him: 'Well, Abú Firás! what dost thou think of that which thou hast heard?' Al-Farazdaq replied: 'What thou hast uttered is really admirable.' 'Why then ', said the other, 'is my name not mentioned with those of the first-rate poets?' 'Thou hast been prevented from attaining their eminence' answered al-Farazdaq 'by thy lamentations over dunghills, and thy descriptions of the excrements of cattle and their pinfolds.' Ibn Khallikan, ii, 447.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_270"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_270">49:3</a> <i>Can the dry stone feel pain:</i> A rather poor pun on <font color="GREEN">…</font> a stone and <font color="GREEN">…</font> the name of the tribal ancestor.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_272"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_272">50:1</a> <i>Little Dhú al-Rumma:</i> The diminutive is used to express contempt.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_273"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_273">50:2</a> <font color="GREEN">…</font> <i>incorrect:</i> Literally crooked, from <font color="GREEN">…</font> lit., a spear straightened or made even.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_274"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_274">50:3</a> <i>And the base men of Majásh'a:</i> Metre <i>mutaqárib</i>; <i>Majásh’a</i>: The name of one of al-Farazdaq's ancestors.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_275"></a><a href="mhm15.htm#fr_275">50:4</a> <i>Stolen verses</i>. This was no libel: Dhú al-Rumma was notorious for appropriating the verses of others, See Ibn Qutaiba, Sh‘ir wa’l Shu‘ará, p. 338.</p>  
 <p>This was not the only rebuke administered to Dhúal-Rumma by al-Farazdaq. See note on the condemnation of the conventional prelude, <a href="#page_49">p. 49</a>, supra.</p>
