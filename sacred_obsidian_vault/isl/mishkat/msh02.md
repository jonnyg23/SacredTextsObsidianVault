 <h1 align="CENTER">AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h1>
 <p>I AM so conscious that my general equipment was insufficient to warrant my having undertaken an <i>introduction</i> to this treatise (in addition to the translation), that my utmost hope is this,--that what I have written may be regarded by lenient Orientalists as something to elicit--provoke, if you will--the necessary supplementing and formative criticism; or as useful materials to be built into some more authoritative and better informed work: and that they may from this point of view be inclined to pardon what otherwise might seem an unwarrantable piece of rashness and indiscretion.</p>
 <p>A still greater presumption remains to be forgiven, but this time on the ground of the great human simplicities, when I venture to inscribe this work, in spite of everything, to the beloved memory of</p>
 <p align="CENTER">IGNAZ GOWZIHER</p>
 <p>--that golden-hearted man--who in 1911 introduced me to the Mishkât; and to join with his</p>
 <p>{p. viii}</p>
 <p>name that of</p>
 <p align="CENTER">DUNCAN BLACK MACDONALD</p>
 <p>who first introduced me to the Mishkât's author. Of these twain, the latter may perhaps forgive the lapses of a pupil because of the filial joy with which, I know well, he will see the two names joined together, howsoever or by whomsoever it was done. As for the former, . . . in Abraham's bosom all things are forgiven.</p>
