 <p>THE MISHKÂT AL-ANWAR[1] is a work of extreme interest from the viewpoint of al-Ghazzâlî's[2] inner life and esoteric thought. The glimpses it gives of that life and thought are remarkably, perhaps uniquely, intimate. It begins where his autobiographical <i>Al-Munqidh min al-<u>D</u>alâl</i> leaves off. Its esotericism excited the curiosity and even the suspicion of Muslim thinkers from the first, and we have deeply interesting allusions to it in Ibn <u>T</u>ufaill and Ibn Rushd,[4] the celebrated philosophers of Western Islam, who flourished within the century after al-Ghazzâlî's death in 1111 (A.H. 505)--a fact which, again, increases its importance and interest for us.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The <i>Mishkât al-Anwâr</i> is numbered No. 34 in Brockelmann's <i>Geschichte der Arabischen Literatur</i> (vol. i, p. 423). It was printed in Cairo (ma<u>t</u>ba`at a<u>s</u> <u>S</u>idq, A. H. 1322), to which edition the references in the present work are made. There is another edition in a collection of five opuscules of Ghazzâlî under the title of the first of the five, <i>Fai<u>s</u>al al-Tafriqa</i>.</p>
