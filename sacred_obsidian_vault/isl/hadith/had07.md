 <p></p><dir>1. "And thy Lord do magnify, And thy garments do purify, And uncleanness do shun" (74:3-5).  
 <p>2. "Surely Allāh loves those who turn to Him again and again, and He loves those who purify themselves" (2:222).</p>  
 <p>3. "Attend to your adornment at every time of prayer." (7:31).</p>  
 <p>4. "O you who believe! When you rise up to prayers, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows and wipe our hands and (wash) your feet to the ankles; and if you are under an obligation to perform a total ablution, have a bath; and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or you have had contact with women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith; Allāh does not desire to put on you any difficulty but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favour to you, so that you may be thankful" (5:6).</p></dir>  
 <p>Purification, though a necessary preliminary to prayer, is an independent subject and is dealt with as such in Hadīth collections. The first three quotations from the Holy Qur'ān given above require in general terms that the man who would turn to his Lord should be pure in body and garments. The Purification of the body is thus made a preliminary to prayer so that by external purification a man's attention may be directed to the purification of the soul which is aimed at in prayer. V. 4 gives the details of ablutions which are necessary before prayer. Purity of the body is thus required as a preliminary to the purity of mind, and the Muslim who is required to say prayers five times a day must needs keep himself and his clothes always clean.</p>  
 <p>It is true that an intelligent man should know for himself what cleanliness is, but religion aims at giving directions to men in all stages of civilization, in early states as well as in the more developed ones. Moreover. the masses among all people stand in need of minute details, and hence while the Holy Qur'ān simply gives the general direction to keep oneself in a state of cleanliness, Hadīth gives the necessary details. As a matter of fact Islām directs attention to many details of personal cleanliness of which even the more civilized people are ignorant.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p>I have divided the chapter into five sections. The first deals with natural evacuations. Purification is called half the faith (h. 1) and the key to prayer (hh. 2. 3), It must not be forgotten that purity of the body is a prelude to the purity of the soul (h. 4). Full regard must be paid to personal cleanliness as well as public hygiene (hh. 5-13). Spitting in public places is forbidden (hh. 16, 17).</p>  
 <p>The second section deals with tooth-brushing which occupies a very prominent place in the Muslim's cleanliness. It is spoken of as a means of purifying the mouth and seeking the pleasure of the Lord (h. 18), which is to show that God loves even bodily cleanliness. Great stress is laid upon its use (hh. 19, 20), and the minimum requirement is that the tooth-brush should be used after getting up from sleep (hh. 21, 22), A clean mouth is in fact the greatest help for the preservation of health. Its importance is further emphasized in h. 23, The third section gives the details of ablution (hh. 25 36) and shows when a fresh ablution becomes necessary (hh. 37-41). A prayer directing attention to purity of the spirit must be offered when the ablution has been performed (h. 43).</p>  
 <p>The fourth section deals with total ablution or bath, which is made compulsory once a week (hh. 44-46). Particular occasions on which bath must be taken are mentioned in hh. 47-50, A person under an obligation to have a bath on account of <i>janābah</i> and a menstruating woman are not impure (hh. 51, 52). Some details are given in hh. 53, 54, and taking a bath naked in an open place is strictly forbidden (1.1. 55).</p>  
 <p>The fifth section deals with <i>tayammum</i> or wiping the face and hands with pure dust when water is not available for ablution or bath, though it may be available for drinking or domestic purposes, or when the use of water is likely to be harmful (hh. 56-58). This act is as it were a reminder that purification before prayer is an essential thing.</p>  <h2 align="center">SECTION I.--NATURAL EVACUATIONS.</h2>

 <p><font size="-2" color="BLUE">2. This hadīth and the previous one lay down in general terms that purification is a necessary condition of prayer, which in fact means that a man should always keep himself free from impurities, since prayer is said five times a day. The habit of outward purification is thus developed through an institution which is meant to purify the soul, and a Muslim is required to keep his body, his clothes, in fact, the whole of his environment, clean. Charity like prayer purifies the mind, and as what is acquired by unlawful means is impure, the pure and the impure cannot go together.</font></p>

 <p><b>7</b> 'Ā'ishah said,</p>  
 <p>The Messenger of Allāh, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, said:</p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="BLUE">3. <i>Khubuth</i> is the plural of <i>khabīth</i> (an evil person) and <i>khabā'ith</i> is the plural of <i>khabīthah</i> (an evil person of feminine gender), and the words are generally understood as meaning the devils, but according to the <i>Nihāyah</i>, the first word may also be read as <i>khubth</i> which means impure deeds and the second word may also mean evil habits. Thus from outward defilement attention is directed to inward impurities.</font></p>  
 <p>4. Other hadīth speak of stones for cleaning purposes, but water was used when available even after cleaning with earth or stones. These may appear to be minor details, but the minutest details are necessary to develop habits of cleanliness. Water or earth was also used after urinating.</p>  
 <p>5. This with and the one following speak of pebbles or balls of dry earth for cleaning purposes. Toilet paper would serve the same purpose.</p>

 <p><b>24</b> Sa'īd ibn Zaid said,</p>  
 <p>The Messenger of Allāh, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, said:</p>  
 <p>"That man has not performed ablution who does not remember Allāh in doing it."<font size="-2" color="BLUE">15</font></p>  
 <p align="right">(Tr-Msh. 3:4.)</p>  
 <p><b>25</b> Yahyā al-Māzinī reported that</p>  
 <p>A man said to 'Abd Allāh ibn Zaid, Canst thou show me how the Messenger of Allāh, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, performed ablution? 'Abd Allāh ibn Zaid said, Yes.</p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="BLUE">15. Ablution, which means washing of certain parts of the body that are generally exposed and where dust or dirt is likely to settle, is a preparation for going into Divine presence. The object is undoubtedly twofold, that a man should be clean and that he should feel that he stands in need of the purification of the soul as he stands in need of the cleaning of the body. The remembrance of Allāh is needed to direct attention to this. The beginning should be made with <i>Bismillāh</i> as in the case of all important affairs, while h. 42. speaks of the prayer when the ablution ends.</font></p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>So he sent for water and poured it over his hands and washed his hands twice, then he rinsed his mouth and sniffed water into his nose thrice, then he washed his face thrice, then he washed his hands up to the elbow twice, then he wiped his head with both his hands so that he carried them from the front and brought them back he began with his forehead until he carried them to his neck, then he brought them back to the place from which he had started then he washed his two feet.</p>  
 <p align="right">(B. 4:38.)</p>  
 <p><b>26</b> Ibn 'Abbās said,</p>  
 <p>The Prophet, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, performed ablution (washing each part) once only.</p>

 <p><b>28</b> It is reported about 'Uthmān that</p>  
 <p>He performed ablution at Maqā'id, and said, May I not show you the ablution of the Messenger of Allāh, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>? Then he performed ablution (washing each part) thrice.<font size="-2" color="BLUE">16</font></p>

 <p><b>29</b> 'Ā'ishah said,</p>  
 <p>The Prophet, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, was fond of beginning on the right side, in putting on his shoes and in combing his hair and in performing his ablution, (in fact) in all his actions.</p>  
 <p align="right">(B. 4:31.)</p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="BLUE">16. The various reports show that there was great latitude in these matters. The cleaning might be effected in some cases by washing once only while in others it might require repetition. Maqā'id, according to Ibn Hajar, is the name of a place in Madīnah. According to others, it means a place where people sit together.</font></p>

The word <i>tāhiratain</i> (both being clean) in the hadīth refers to the two feet, but the meaning is generally taken to be that the boots were put on after performing ablution. The next hadīth shows that socks are treated similarly, <i>i.e.</i>, it is sufficient to pass wet hands over them when they are worn after performing ablution. This may be done for one day and night, i.e., the socks or boots must bc taken off and the feet washed once in every twenty-four hours, but in the case of one who is journeying the time-limit is three days and nights.

 <p><b>36</b> Abū Hurairah said,</p>  
 <p>The Messenger of Allāh, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, said:</p>  
 <p>"Prayer is not accepted of a man who voids himself<font size="-2" color="BLUE">20</font> until he performs ablution."</p>  
 <p align="right">(B. 4:2.)</p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="BLUE">20. The Arabic word is <i>ahdatha</i> which means originally <i>he caused</i> or <i>occasioned a thing</i>, and is technically applied to the <i>voiding of ordure</i>. When Abū Hurairah was asked, what <i>hadath</i> was, he simply said, <i>breaking wind</i> but it includes the passing of urine, stools and wind. To this must be added sound sleep as stated in h. 39 and vomiting (h.40), though there is a difference of opinion in the latter case. The reason for a fresh ablution after sound sleep seems to be that one does not know if one has passed wind in that condition. Bukhārī makes it clear that ablution is only necessary when something passes out through the <i>makhrajain</i>, the two ways of natural evacuation. The flowing of blood from wounds or the spitting of blood does not necessitate ablution. If a man performs ablution by wiping his boots or socks, and then takes them off, fresh ablution is not necessary (hh, 32, 34). Taking food or milk does not call for fresh ablution. but the mouth should be rinsed in both cases. (B. 4:50, 51, 52.)</font></p>  
 <p>There are certain hadīth speaking of the necessity of ablution in certain other cases. For instance, there is a hadīth which says that ablution should be performed if one has kissed one's wife, but this is contradicted by other hadīth. The clear rule laid down by Bukhārī that ablution is necessitated only by what passes out of the two outlets of natural evacuation is the safest rule. Sound sleep and vomiting are the only exceptions.</p>

To keep oneself clean has already been stated to be half the faith, and in the hot and even temperate seasons nothing less than a daily bath can serve that purpose, but in the cold season and in the case of generality of people who cannot afford a daily bath, the washing of the whole body once a week is an absolute necessity.</font></p>

 <p>24. Janābah (from <i>janb</i> meaning a <i>side</i>) is literally the <i>putting of a thing aside</i> or <i>making a person avoid a thing</i>. In the religious terminology of Islām, the state of Janābah arises from nocturnal pollution (<i>ihtilām</i>) and <i>coitus</i> (sexual intercourse) for both men and women. There are contradictory hadīth as to whether bath is necessary in case of sexual intercourse when there is no emission, and Bukhārī favours the view that <i>wudzū'</i> or ablution is sufficient in such a case, but that bath is better. The person who is in a state of <i>janābah</i>, is called <i>junub</i>. Such a man must take a bath before he can say his prayers.</p>

During the period of menses and puerpurium, a woman is exempted from prayer. Menstruation generally lasts from three to ten days, and a bath is needed when the flow stops, after a minimum period of three days. Bath must necessarily be taken after the maximum period of ten days, and if the flow continues after that, it is called <i>istihādzah</i>, and the rules relating to menses do not apply to this state.</font></p>

 <p><b>51</b> Anas said,</p>  
 <p>When a woman among the Jews had her menses, they would not eat with her and would not be with her in the same room; so the companions of the Prophet, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, asked the Prophet, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, and Allāh revealed to him, "They ask thee about the menses."

 <p>27. This Hadīth removes another great misconception. The woman, who has her menses on, is not impure. There is a large number of hadīth showing that her social relation with her husband or other members of society remain unchanged.</p>

If water is available in such quantity as can barely suffice for drinking or preparing food, it is permissible to resort to <i>tayammum</i> instead of ablution or bath.</font></p>

 <p><b>57</b> It is related that 'Amr ibn al-'Ās became a <i>junub</i> on a cold night, so he resorted to <i>tayammum</i> and recited the verse, "Do not kill yourselves, for Allāh is Merciful to you" (4: 29). This was mentioned to the Prophet, <font size="-2">peace and blessings of Allāh be on him</font>, he did not censure (him.) <font size="-2" color="BLUE">31</font></p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="BLUE">30. This hadīth shows that <i>tayammum</i> takes the place not only of ablution but also of bath. It also shows the manner in which <i>tayammum</i> is performed. The hands should be struck on clean earth, then the dust should be shaken. or blown off, then the back of each hand should be wiped with the other and then the face should be wiped with both hands. There are other hadīth which give a slightly different process. but as the object is simply to remind a man that he is going to a Higher Presence. this simple process serves the purpose well enough. Bukhārī relates that Yahyā ibn Sa'īd said that there was no harm in performing <i>tayammum</i> on sabkhah, <i>i.e.</i>, on ground on the surface of which salt had appeared (B. 7:6) And generally anything would do, or, the surface of which dust might have settled.</font></p>

 <p align="right">(AD-Msh. 3:10.)</p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="BLUE">32. This hadīth shows that when it is harmful to apply water to a particular part of the body, it is sufficient to wipe that part. In this case the wounded man had a bath on the advice of his friends, and the wound got septic and he died. The Prophet upbraided his companions for giving an advice which was not based on knowledge.</font></p>
