 <p>Like Jacob Böhme <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Jílí sets out from the principle that "in order that the truth may he manifested as a Something, there must be a contrary therein." He finds the ground of existence in a Being which, though essentially One, is of threefold nature, since it knows itself as the Creator (<i>al-Ḥaqq</i>) and the creatures (<i>al-khalq</i>).</p>

 <p>"The Essence," he says, "is Thou and IThou in respect of thy deepest self (<i>huwiyya</i>, He-ness), not in respect of the human attributes which the notion Thou' admits; and I' in respect of my individual self, not in respect of the Divine attributes which the notion I admits. That is what is signified by the Essence (al-<i>Dhát</i>). I, in respect of my l-ness (<i>aniyya</i>), viewed in relation to the judgments which the notion I is capable of, is God; and Thou, in the creaturely aspect, is Man. Therefore consider your essence, if you will, as I, or if you will, as Thou, for there is nothing besides the universal reality.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>If you say, that it (the Essence) is One, you are right; or if you say that it is Two, it is in fact Two.<br> Or if you say, No, it is Three,' you are right, for that is the real nature of Man.<br> Regard the Oneness (<i>aḥadiyya</i>) which is his essence: say, 'He is One relatively (<i>wáḥid</i>), One absolutely (<i>aḥad</i>), unique in glory.'<br> But if the two essences are considered, you will say that he is Two, because he is a slave (<i>abd</i>) and a Lord (<i>rabb</i>).<br> And if you examine his real nature and what is united therein, namely, two things deemed to be contrary,<br> You will contemplate him with amazement: his lowness is such that you will not call him lofty, and his loftiness is such that you will not call him low.<br> Nay, name that (Man) a Third, because of a reality having two attributes inherent in the realities of its essence <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">1</font></a>.<br> It (that reality) is he named Aḥmad as being that (Man), and Mohammed as being the true idea (<i>ḥaqíqa</i>) of all things that exist <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">2</font></a>."</dir>  
 <p>As an introduction to the Logos doctrine foreshadowed here, which is interwoven with a mystical scheme of cosmology, I will translate part of the 60th chapter, "Of the Perfect Man: showing that he is our Lord Mohammed, and that he stands over against the Creator (<i>al-Ḥaqq</i>) and the creatures (<i>al-khalq</i>) <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">3</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>The Perfect Man is the <i>Quṭb</i> (axis) on which the spheres of existence revolve from first to last, and since things came into being he is one (<i>wáḥid</i>) for ever and ever. He hath various guises and appears in diverse bodily tabernacles (<i>kanáis</i>): in respect of some of these his name is given to him, while in respect of others it is not given to him. His own original name is Mohammed, his name of honour Abú l-Qásim, his description Abdullah <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and his title Shamsuddín <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">2</font></a>. In every age he bears a name suitable to his guise (<i>libás</i>) in that age. I once met him in the form of my Shaykh, Sharafuddín Ismáíl al-Jabartí, but I did not know that he (the Shaykh) was the Prophet, although I knew that he (the Prophet) was the Shaykh. This was one of the visions in which I beheld him at Zabíd in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 796. The real meaning of this matter is that the Prophet has the power of assuming every form. When the adept (<i>adíb</i>) sees him in the form of Mohammed which he wore during his life, he names him by that name, but when he sees him in another form and knows him to be Mohammed, he names him by the name of the form in which he appears. The name Mohammed is not applied except to the Idea of Mohammed (<i>al-Ḥaqíqatu l-Muḥammadiyya</i>). Thus, when he appeared in the form of Shiblí <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">3</font></a>, Shiblí said to his disciple, "Bear witness that I am the Apostle of God"; and the disciple, being one of the illuminated, recognised the Prophet and said, "I bear witness that thou art the Apostle of God." No objection can be taken to this: it is like what happens when a dreamer sees some one in the form of another; but there is a difference between dreaming and mystical revelation, <i>viz</i>., that the name of the form in which Mohammed appears to the dreamer is not bestowed in hours of waking upon the <i>Ḥaqíqatu l-Muḥammadiyya</i>, because interpretation is applicable to the World of Similitudes: accordingly, when the dreamer wakes he interprets the <i>ḥaqíqa</i> of Mohammed as being the <i>ḥaqíqa</i> of the dream-form. In mystical revelation it is otherwise, for if you perceive mystically that the <i>ḥaqíqa</i> of Mohammed is displayed in any human form, you must bestow upon the <i>ḥaqíqa</i> of Mohammed the name of that form and regard its owner with no less reverence than you would show to our Lord Mohammed, and after having seen him therein you may not behave towards it in the same</small></p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>manner as before. Do not imagine that my words contain any tincture of the doctrine of metempsychosis. God forbid! I mean that the Prophet is able to assume whatever form he wishes, and the Sunna declares that in every age he assumes the form of the most perfect men, in order to exalt their dignity and correct their deviation (from the truth): they are his vicegerents outwardly, and he is their spiritual essence (<i>ḥaqíqa</i>) inwardly.</small></p>  
 <p>The Perfect Man in himself stands over against all the individualisations of existence. With his spirituality he stands over against the higher individualisations, with his corporeality over against the lower. His heart stands over against the Throne of God (<i>al-Arsh</i>), his mind over against the Pen (<i>al-Qalam</i>), his soul over against the Guarded Tablet (<i>al-Lawḥu l-maḥfúẓ</i>), his nature over against the elements, his capability (of receiving forms) over against matter (<i>hayúlá</i>).He stands over against the angels with his good thoughts, over against the genies and devils with the doubts which beset him, over against the beasts with his animality. To every type of existence he furnishes from himself an anti-type. We have already explained that every one of the Cherubim is created from an analogous faculty of the Perfect Man. It only remains to speak of his correspondence with the Divine names and attributes.</p>  
 <p>You must know that the Perfect Man is a copy (<i>nuskha</i>) of God, according to the saying of the Prophet, "God created Adam in the image of the Merciful," and in another <i>ḥadíth</i>, "God created Adam in His own image." That is so, because God is Living, Knowing, Mighty, Willing, Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking, and Man too is all these. Then he confronts the Divine <i>huwiyya</i> with his <i>huwiyya</i>, the Divine <i>aniyya</i> with his <i>aniyya</i>, and the Divine <i>dhát</i> (essence) with his <i>dhát</i>he is the whole against the whole, the universal against the universal, the particular against the particular. Further, you must know that the Essential names and the Divine attributes belong to the Perfect Man by fundamental and sovereign right in virtue of a necessity inherent in his essence, for it is he whose "truth" (<i>ḥaqíqa</i>) is signified by those expressions and whose spirituality (<i>laṭífa</i>) is indicated by those symbols: they have no subject in existence (whereto they should be attached) except the Perfect Man. As a mirror in which a person sees the form of himself and cannot see it without the mirror, such is the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>relation of God to the Perfect Man, who cannot possibly see his own form but in the mirror of the name Allah; and he is also a mirror to God, for God laid upon Himself the necessity that His names and attributes should not be seen save in the Perfect Man. This obligation to display the Divine attributes is the "trust" (<i>amána</i>) which God offered to the heavens and the earth: they were afraid to accept it, "but Man accepted it; verily he is unjust and ignorant" (Kor. 33, 72), <i>i.e.</i>, unjust to his own soul in letting it suffer degradation (from the things of this world) and ignorant of his real worth, because he is unaware of that with which he has been entrusted.Beyond the plane of the Names and Attributes, which are ranged on the right and left of him according to their kind, the Perfect Man feels through his whole being " a pervasive delight, which is named the delight of the Godhead" (<i>ladhdhatu l-iláhiyya</i>).Here he is independent of his modes, <i>i.e.</i>, the Names and Attributes, and regards them not at all. He knows nothing in existence save his own nature (<i>huwiyya</i>), contemplates the emanation (<i>ṣudúr</i>) from himself of all that exists, and beholds the Many in his essence, even as ordinary men are conscious of their own thoughts and qualities; but the Perfect Man is able to keep every thought, great or small, far from himself: his power over things does not proceed from any secondary cause but is exercised freely, like other men's power of speaking, eating, and drinking.</small></p>  
 <p>These extracts bring out the germinal idea which is developed by Jílí into a psychological and cosmological system. The Perfect Man, as the copy of God and the archetype of Nature, unites the creative and creaturely aspects of the Essence and manifests the oneness of Thought with things. "He is the heaven and the earth and the length and the breadth <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>

 </p>  
 <p></p><dir>Mine is the kingdom in both worlds: I saw therein none but myself, that I should hope for his favour or fear him.<br> Before me is no "before," that I should follow its condition, and after me is no " after," that I should precede its notion. <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></a><br> I have made all kinds of perfection mine own, and lo, I am the beauty of the majesty of the Whole: I am naught but It.<br> Whatsoever thou seest of minerals and plants and animals, together with Man and his qualities,<br> And whatsoever thou seest of elements and nature and original atoms (<i>haba</i>) whereof the substance is (ethereal as) a perfume,<br> And whatsoever thou seest of seas and deserts and trees and high-topped mountains,<br> And whatsoever thou seest of spiritual forms and of things visible whose countenance is goodly to behold,<br> And whatsoever thou seest of thought and imagination and intelligence and soul, and heart with its inwards,<br> And whatsoever thou seest of angelic aspect, or of phenomena whereof Satan is the spirit,<br>            *      *      *      *      *      *<br> Lo, I am that whole, and that whole is my theatre: tis I, not it, that is displayed in its reality.<br> Verily, I am a Providence and Prince to mankind: the entire creation is a name, and my essence is the object named.<br> The sensible world is mine and the angel-world is of my weaving and fashioning; the unseen world is mine and the world of omnipotence springs from me.<br> And mark! In all that I have mentioned I am a slave returning from the Essence to his Lord<br> Poor, despised, lowly, self-abasing, sin's captive, in the bonds of his trespasses <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</dir>  
 <p>The concluding verses only say what Jílí repeats in many places, that while at supreme moments a man may lose himself in God, he can never be identified with God absolutely.</p>  
 <p>In the second part of his work the author treats of the Perfect Man as the Spirit whence all things have their origin. Accordingly he devotes successive chapters to the organs and faculties which make up the psychological and intellectual constitution of the Perfect Manspirit, heart, intelligence, reflection, etc., with the corresponding celestial beings which are said to be "created" from them <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">2</font></a>e. The highest hypostases of his psychology are the Holy Spirit (<i>Rúḥu l-Quds</i>) and the</p>

 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Spirit (<i>al-Rúḥ</i>); the latter is also described as "the angel named al-Rúḥ" and, in the technical language of the Ṣúfís, as "the <i>ḥaqq</i> by means of which the world is created" (<i>al-ḥaqqu l-makhlúq bihi</i>) and "the Idea of Mohammed" (<i>al-Ḥaqíqatu l-Muḥammadiyya</i>). How these two Spirits are related to each other is indicated in the following passage:</p>  
 <p><small>You must know that every sensible object has a created spirit which constitutes its form, and the spirit is to the form as the meaning to the word. The created spirit has a Divine spirit which constitutes it, and that Divine spirit is the <i>Rúḥu l-Quds</i>. Those who regard the <i>Rúḥu l-Quds</i> in man deem it created, because two eternal substances cannot exist: eternity belongs to God alone, whose names and attributes inhere in His essence because of the impossibility of their being detached; all else is created and originated. Man, for example, has a body, which is his form, and a spirit, which is his meaning, and a consciousness (<i>sirr</i>), which is <i>al-Rúḥ</i>, and an essential aspect (<i>wajh</i>), which is denoted by the terms <i>Rúḥu l-Quds</i> (the Holy Spirit), <i>al-sirru l-iláhí</i> (the Divine consciousness) and <i>al-wujúdu l-sárí</i> (the all-pervading Being) <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</small></p>  
 <p>The <i>Rúḥu l-Quds</i> and the <i>Rúḥ</i> are one Spirit viewed as eternal in relation to God and non-eternal in relation to Man; as the inmost essence of things or as their form of existence <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The uncreated Spirit of God, sanctified above all phenomenal imperfections, is referred to in the verse, "I breathed of My Spirit into Adam" (Kor. 15, 29; 38, 72), and in the verse, "Wheresoever ye turn, there is the face (<i>wajh</i>) of Allah" (Kor. 2, 109), <i>i.e.</i>, the <i>Rúḥu l-Quds</i> exists, "individualised by its perfection," in every object of sense or thought. Jílí adds that inasmuch as the spirit of a thing is its self (<i>nafs</i>), existence is constituted by the "self" of God; and His "self " is His essence <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Union with the <i>Rúḥu l-Quds</i> comes only as the crown and consummation of the mystical life to "the holy one" (<i>qudsí</i>) <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">4</font></a> who unceasingly contemplates the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Divine consciousness (<i>sirr</i>) which is his origin, so that its laws are made manifest in him and God becomes his ear, eye, hand and tongue: he touches the sick and they are healed, he bids a thing be and it is, for he has been strengthened with the Holy Spirit, even as Jesus was (Kor. 2, 81) <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>It will now be seen that Jílí considers the created <i>Rúḥ</i> or the archetypal Spirit of Mohammed as a mode of the uncreated Holy Divine Spirit and as the medium through which God becomes conscious of Himself in creation <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><small>God created the angel named <i>Rúḥ</i> from His own light, and from him He created the world and made him His organ of vision in the world. One of his names is the Word of Allah (<i>Amr</i> Allah) <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He is the noblest and most exalted of existent beings: there is no angel above him, and he is the chief of the Cherubim. God caused the mill-stone of existent beings to turn on him, and made him the axis (<i>quṭb</i>) of the sphere of created things. Towards every thing that God created he has a special aspect (<i>wajh</i>), in virtue of which he regards it and preserves it in its appointed place in the order of existence. He has eight forms, which are the bearers of the Divine Throne (<i>al-Arsh</i>) <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">4</font></a>. From him were created all the angels, both the sublime and the elemental. The angels stand to him in the relation of drops of water to the sea, and the eight bearers of the <i>Arsh</i> stand in the same relation to him as the eight faculties which constitute human existence to the spirit of man. These faculties are intelligence (<i>aql</i>), judgment (<i>wahm</i>), reflection (<i>fikr</i>), phantasy (<i>khayál</i>), imagination (<i>al-muṣawwira</i>), memory (<i>al-ḥáfiẓa</i>), perception (<i>al-mudrika</i>), and the soul (<i>nafs</i>). The <i>Rúḥ</i> exercises a Divine guardianship, created in him by God, over the whole universe. He manifests himself in his perfection in the <i>Ḥaqíqatu l-Muḥammadiyya</i>: therefore the Prophet is the most excellent of mankind. While God manifests Himself in His attributes to all other created beings, He manifests Himself in His essence to this</small></p>

 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>angel alone. Accordingly the <i>Rúḥ</i> is the <i>Quṭb</i> of the present world and of the world to come. He does not make himself known to any creature of God but to the Perfect Man. When the saint (<i>walí</i>) knows him and truly understands the things which the <i>Rúḥ</i> teaches him, he becomes a pole (<i>quṭb</i>) on which the entire universe revolves; but the Poleship (<i>Quṭbiyya</i>) belongs fundamentally to the <i>Rúḥ</i>, and if others hold it, they are only his delegates <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He is the first to receive the Divine command, which he then delivers to the angels; and whenever a command is to be executed in the universe, God creates from him an angel suitable to that command, and the <i>Rúḥ</i> sends him to carry it out. All the Cherubim are created from him, <i>e.g.</i>, Seraphiel, Gabriel, Michael, and Azrael, and those above them, such as the angel named al-Nún <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who is stationed beneath the Guarded Tablet, and the angel named the Pen (<i>al-Qalam</i>), and the angel named al-Mudabbir, whose station is beneath the <i>Kursí</i> <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the angel named al-Mufaṣṣil, who</small></p>

 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>stands beneath the Imámu l-Mubín <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">1</font></a>: these are the Sublime Angels, who were not commanded to worship Adam. God in His wisdom did not command them, for had they been commanded to worship, every one of Adam's descendants would have known them. Consider how, inasmuch as the angels were commanded to worship Adam, they appear to men in the forms of the Divine similitudes whereby God reveals Himself to the dreamer. All those forms are angels, who descend in diverse shapes by command of the angel entrusted with the making of similitudes. For this reason a man dreams that lifeless things speak to him: unless they were really spirits assuming the form of lifelessness, they would not have spoken. The Prophet said that a true dream is an inspiration from Godbecause an angel brings itand also that a true dream is one of the forty-six parts of prophecy. Since Iblís, though he did not worship Adam, was amongst those commanded to worship, the devils who are his offspring were commanded to appear to the dreamer in the same forms as the angels: hence false dreams. According to this argument, the Sublime Angels are unknowable except by "the divine men" (<i>al-iláhiyyún</i>), on whom God bestows such knowledge as a gift after their release from the limitations of humanity.</small></p>  
 <p>The <i>Rúḥ</i> has many names according to the number of his aspects. He is named "The Most Exalted Pen" and "The Spirit of Mohammed" and "The First Intelligence" and "The Divine Spirit," on the principle of naming the original by the derivative, but in the presence of God he has only one name, which is "The Spirit" (<i>al-Rúḥ</i>).</p>  
 <p>Jílí gives a long account of a vision in which the <i>Rúḥ</i> conversed with him and spoke darkly concerning the mystery of his nature, saying, "I am the child whose father is his son and the wine whose vine is its jar.I met the mothers who</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>bore me, and I asked them in marriage, and they let me marry them <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">1</font></a>." In the course of this colloquy the Idea of Mohammed (<i>al-Ḥaqíqatu l-Muḥammadiyya</i>) says:</p>  
 <p><small>God created Adam in His own imagethis is not doubted or disputedand Adam was one of the theatres (<i>maẓáhir</i>) in which I displayed myself: he was appointed as a vicegerent (<i>khalífa</i>) over my externality. I knew that God made me the object and goal of all His creatures, and lo, I heard the most gracious allocution from the Most Great Presence: "Thou art the <i>Quṭb</i> whereon the spheres of beauty revolve, and thou art the Sun by whose radiance the full-moon of perfection is replenished; thou art he for whom We set up the pattern <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">2</font></a> and for whose sake We made fast the door-ring <a name="fr_331"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">3</font></a>; thou art the reality symbolised by Hind and Salmá, and Azza and Asmá <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">4</font></a>. O thou who art endued with lofty attributes and pure qualities, Beauty doth not dumbfound thee nor Majesty cause thee to quake, nor dost thou deem Perfection unattainable: thou art the centre and these the circumference, thou art the clothed and these the splendid garments <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">5</font></a>."</small></p>  
 <p>In some aspects the spiritual organ which Ṣúfís call "the heart" (<i>qalb</i>) is hardly distinguished from the spirit (<i>rúḥ</i>): indeed Jílí says that when the Koran mentions the Divine spirit breathed into Adam, it is the heart that is signified. He</p>

 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>describes it as "the eternal light and the sublime consciousness (<i>sirr</i>) revealed in the quintessence (<i>ayn</i>) of created beings (Mohammed), that God may behold Man thereby <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">1</font></a>"; as "the Throne of God (<i>al-Arsh</i>) and His Temple in Manthe centre of Divine consciousness and the circumference of the circle of all that exists actually or ideally <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">2</font></a>." It reflects all the Divine names and attributes at once, yet quickly changes under the influence of particular names. Like a mirror, it has a face and a back. The face is always turned towards a light called the attention (<i>al-hamm</i>), which is the eye of the heart, so that whenever a name becomes opposite to, or as we should say, strikes the attention, the heart sees it and receives the impression of it; then this name disappears and is succeeded by others. The "back" of the heart is the place from which the attention is absent <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Jílí illustrates his meaning by the diagram reproduced here:</p>

 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Divine names and attributes are the heart's true nature, in which it was created. Some men are so blessed that they have little trouble to keep it pure, but most of us must needs undergo painful self-mortifications in order to wash out the stains of the flesh <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Recompense for good works depends on the merit imputed by God to His creatures according to the original individualisations in which He created them: it is a necessary right, not an arbitrary gift <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The heart reflects the world of attributes, or rather, as Jílí holds, is itself reflected by the universe. "Earth and heaven do not contain Me, but the heart of My believing servant containeth Me": if the universe were primary and the heart secondary, <i>i.e.</i>, if the heart were only a mirror, then the power of containing and comprehending would have been ascribed to the universe, not to the heart; but in fact, it is the heart alone that comprehends Godby knowledge, by contemplation, and finally by transubstantiation <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

Ordinary reason is " the light (of Universal Reason) measured by the rule of reflection (<i>fikr</i>), and does not apprehend save by means of reflection": therefore it cannot reach the unconditioned First Intelligence, often misses its mark, and fails to perceive many things. Universal Reason, on the other hand, is infallible, since it weighs all with the twin scales of Wisdom and Power <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">4</font></a>, but it never penetrates beyond the sphere of creation. Neither universal (intuitive) nor ordinary (discursive) reason can attain to knowledge of God. The contrary doctrine has only a demonstrative and controversial value. True gnosis (<i>marifa</i>) is given by faith, which does not depend on proofs and effects (<i>áthár</i>) but on the Divine attributes themselves <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

At death Azrael appears to the spirit in a form determined by its beliefs, actions, and dispositions during life <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">3</font></a>.

 <p>From the reflection (<i>fikr</i>) of Mohammed God created the spirits of the celestial and terrestrial angels, and appointed them to guard the higher and lower spheres of existence until the Last Day, when they shall be translated to the intelligible world <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">4</font></a>. One of the keys to that world is reflection, leading to true knowledge of the nature of Man, which is set with all its aspects over against the aspects of the Merciful (<i>al-Raḥmán</i>).

In Hegelian language " the things that we know about are appropriately described when we say that their being is established not on themselves, but on the Divine Idea."

 <p>After a preliminary chapter on the Form of Mohammed (<i>al ṣúratu l-Muḥammadiyya</i>), which I will omit for the present, he concludes his psychology with an account of the nature of the soul.</p>  
 <p>Ascetic and devotional Ṣúfism, in agreement with orthodox Islam, distinguishes sharply between the spirit (<i>rúḥ</i>) and the soul (<i>nafs</i>) <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The latter term may, indeed, be used to denote a man's spiritual "self""he that knows himself (<i>nafsahu</i>) knows his Lord"but as a rule when Ṣúfís refer to the <i>nafs</i> they mean the appetitive soul, the sensual "self" which, from their point of view, is wholly evil and can never become one with God <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Jílí makes short work of this dualistic doctrine. The heading of his 59th chapter promises to show that the <i>nafs</i> is the origin of Iblís and all the devils, and he begins as follows:</p>  
 <p><small>The <i>nafs</i> is the consciousness (<i>sirr</i>) of the Lord, and the essence (of God): through that Essence it hath in its essence manifold delights. It is created from the light of the attribute of Lordship: many, therefore, are its lordly qualities. God created the <i>nafs</i> of Mohammed from His own <i>nafs</i> (and the <i>nafs</i> of a thing is its essence); then He created the <i>nafs</i> of Adam as a copy of the <i>nafs</i> of Mohammed <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</small></p>  
 <p>With great boldness Jílí argues that the Fall of Man is the necessary consequence of his Divine nature. Adam ate the forbidden fruit because his soul manifests a certain aspect of Deity, <i>viz</i>., Lordship (<i>rubúbiyya</i>); for it is not in the nature of Lordship to submit to a prohibition. The soul knew that, if it ate the fruit <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">5</font></a>, it would inevitably descend into the material</p>

 <p>world and would suffer misery, but on the other hand it was aware of the blessedness of its inherent sovereignty. Thus it became perplexed, and its perplexity (<i>iltibás</i>) brought about its fall. The choice of the soul is at once determined and free: determined, because in the last resort its act proceeds from a fundamental difference in the nature of God; free, because the soul acts in accordance with its knowledge of itself and, had it not been blinded by pride, would have perceived that its true nature requires obedience to the Divine command, inasmuch as disobedience renders the spirit miserable, and misery is inconsistent with Lordship.</p>  
 <p>When God created the soul of Mohammed from His own Essence, which comprises all contraries, He created from the soul of Mohammed (1) the Sublime Angels in respect of His attributes of Beauty, Light, and Leading, and (2) Iblís and his followers in respect of His attributes of Majesty, Darkness, and Misleading <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Now, the name of Iblís was Azázíl: he had worshipped God for thousands of years before the creation of the world, and God had forbidden him to worship aught else. Therefore, when God created Adam and commanded the angels to bow down before him, Iblís refused, for he did not know that to worship by God's command is equivalent to worshipping God <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Instead of justifying his disobedience or repenting of it and asking God to forgive him, he silently acknowledged that God wills and acts in conformity with the eternal and unchangeable principles of His nature. Iblís was banished from the Divine presence and a curse was laid upon him "until the Day of Judgment" (Kor. 15, 35), <i>i.e.</i>, for a finite period <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">3</font></a>. After the Day of Judgment the creatureliness which hinders the spirit from knowing God as He really is</p>

 <p>Jílí mentions five phases of the soul, or ascending grades of spiritual life: (1) the animal soul, <i>i.e.</i>, the spirit regarded as governing the body; (2) the commanding (evil-prompting) soul <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>i.e.</i>, the spirit regarded as subject to the passions; (3) the inspired soul, <i>i.e.</i>, the spirit which God inspires to do good; (4) the self-reproaching soul, <i>i.e.</i>, the spirit regarded as turning penitently towards God; (5) the tranquil soul, <i>i.e.</i>, the spirit regarded as at rest with God <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_373"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

The German mystic unites Wrath and Love in a form which he calls "Fire": it is "the centrum naturae, the point between the kingdom of light and that of darkness, between love and anger, between good and evil" (Professor Deussen's introd. to Böhme's <i>Three Principles of the Divine Essence</i> tr. by John Sparrow, p. lvi foll.).

Allah's relation to this Vicegerent, the supreme controller of the Universe, is compared to the relation of the impalpable light-essence to the sun, or of the elemental fire to a glowing coal" (W. H. T. Gairdner, <i>Al-Ghazālī's Mishkāt al-Anwār and the Ghazālī-problem in Der Islam</i>, 1914, p. 121 foll.). I agree with Canon Gairdner that Ghazálí would not have accepted the ordinary hierarchical <i>Quṭb</i> doctrine current amongst the Ṣúfís of the 5th century <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">aḥ.</span>, if not earlier. But an hypostatised <i>Quṭb</i> is another matter. The Perfect Man, though not himself the Absolute, in no way impairs the absolute Divine unity which he objectifies. It looks to me as if Ghazálí's esoteric teaching, which he keeps back from his readers because they "cannot bear it," was not different in substance from the Logos doctrine of the <i>Insánu l-kámil</i>. His allusions to ineffable arcana, centring in the tradition that Adam was created in the image of God, are extremely significant.

Those who are not familiar with these and other details of Mohammedan cosmogony may consult E. J. W. Gibb's <i>History of Ottoman Poetry</i>, vol. I. p. 34 foll. According to Jílí, the creatures (<i>al-khalq</i>) are first individualised occultly and without differentiation in the Divine knowledge, then brought into existence, <a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a> synthetically and virtually, in the <i>Arsh</i> (cf. K II. 5, 12 foll.), then manifested analytically in the <i>Kursí</i> (cf. K II. 6, II foll.). All these individualisations are "unseen" (<i>ghayb</i>), <i>i.e.</i>, in God, so to speak. The first objective individualisation takes place in the Pen (<i>al-Qalam</i>), which distinguishes the creatures from the Creator and imprints their forms of existence on the Guarded Tablet (<i>al-Lawḥ al-maḥfúẓ</i>), as the mind imprints ideas on the soul.

 <p><a name="fn_336"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_338">115:2</a> Therefore the illuminations (<i>tajalliyát</i>) of the Essence are not named "a gift" (II. 20, 10). Jílí quotes a verse of "our Shaykh, Shaykh Abdu l-Qádir al-Jílání":</p>  
 <p></p><dir>I ceased not pasturing in the fields of quietism until I reached a dignity which is not bestowed by favour.</dir>

 <p><a name="fn_337"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_339">115:3</a> K II. 20, 23 foll. This agrees with Ibnu l-Arabí's doctrine in the <i>Fuṣúṣ</i>, 145 foll. The three kinds of comprehension are denoted by the terms <i>wusu l-ilm</i> (<i>ilm</i> in this connexion is synonymous with <i>marifa</i>), <i>wusu l-musháhada</i>, and <i>wusu l-khiláfa</i>. In the last stage Man is essentialised and becomes the <i>khalífa</i> or vicegerent of God. Jílí, however, maintains a distinction even here. The Perfect Man knows the perfection of the Divine nature as manifested in him, not the perfection of the Divine nature in itself, which is infinite and (since the Essence cannot be comprehended by one of its attributes) ultimately unknowable. We can only say that God knows Himself according to the necessity of His knowledge (<i>ḥaqqu l-marifa</i>).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_343"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_345">116:4</a> Jílí likens the First Intelligence to the sun, Universal Reason to water irradiated by sunbeams, and ordinary reason to the light reflected from the water upon a wall (K II. 22, 4 fr. foot and foll.).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_347"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_349">117:1</a> K II. 27, 54 foll. <i>Wahm</i> is generally defined as the "bodily" faculty which perceives the qualities of a sensible object and forms a judgment concerning it, <i>e.g.</i>, that the sheep runs away from the wolf. Jílí regards it as the faculty whereby things are judged intuitively to be what they really are: he says that by means of <i>wahm</i> God made His creatures worship Him as their Lord (<i>taabbada l-álam</i>).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_352"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_354">117:6</a> Against the opinion that no sleep is visionless, though some dreams are not remembered on waking, Jílí sets the fact, revealed to him (as he says) by Divine illumination, that it is possible to sleep dreamlessly for a period of two days or more, which seems to pass in the twinkling of an eye. Conversely, God may so extend a single moment of time that within it an individual lives many lives and marries and has children (K II. 27, 1 foll.).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_364"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_366">119:3</a> How far Ibnu l-Arabí, Ibnu l-Fáriḍ, and Jílí have advanced beyond the old Ṣúfism appears from the way in which they speak of the body. Although on account of its grossness it is an imperfect medium and therefore relatively a cause of evil, its faculties are necessary for the attainment of spiritual perfection. A man born blind could know nothing, either here or hereafter, of the Divine wisdom that is communicated through the eye (M41). Cf. the <i>Táiyya</i>, <i>vv</i>. 677-9, and note <i>ad loc</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_368"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_370">120:2</a> Jílí derives the name Iblís from the doubt and confusion (<i>talbís</i>) which was produced in the mind of Azázíl by the command to worship Adam.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_369"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_371">120:3</a> The Days of God (<i>ayyám Allah</i>) are the epiphanies by which He reveals His perfections (K I. 89, 25 foll.). The Day of Judgment signifies "an omnipotent epiphany before which all existent beings abase themselves" (K I. 111, 15), or in other words, the return of created things to God (K II. 50, last line).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_370"></a><a href="siim11.htm#fr_372">121:1</a> Because the spirit, having regained its absoluteness, will be one with the Essence which is both Creator and creature.</p>
