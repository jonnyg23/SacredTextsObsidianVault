 <p>His supplication when leaving for a journey</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I seek refuge from undergoing the hardships of travels, and</p>  
 <p>from the bad condition of my family. O Allah! You be my companion in</p>  
 <p>my journey and my leader in my family and both these things are found</p>  
 <p>in nobody except You, because he who is left to guard the house cannot</p>  
 <p>accompany, and he who is a companion cannot be expected to guard</p>  
 <p>the house.</p>
