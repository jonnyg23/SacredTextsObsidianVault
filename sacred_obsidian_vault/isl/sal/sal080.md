 <p>His supplication when he extorted people</p>  
 <p>for the war of Siffin and when people did</p>  
 <p>not respond, he supplicated as under:</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! From among Your slaves make You a witness against the</p>  
 <p>person who does not pay any heed to our admonitions and who acts</p>  
 <p>lazily to help for Your cause. O The greatest of all the witnesses and it is</p>  
 <p>such a witness that I call upon the entire creation to witness whom You</p>  
 <p>have settled on the earth and the Heavens. The witness that You are</p>  
 <p>not in need of their help and due to their sins they will be dealt with</p>  
 <p>severely.</p>
