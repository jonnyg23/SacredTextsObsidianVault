 <p>His supplication like a fort</p>  
 <p>It should be written and tied on the right arm</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>And you were not on the western side when We revealed to Musa his</p>  
 <p>commandment, and you were not among the witnesses. Get out by the</p>  
 <p>order of Allah, O the vicious one, by the Honour of Allah; Lord of the</p>  
 <p>Worlds, or else you will be imprisoned. Be away from here, as you have</p>  
 <p>no right to move freely over here. Go forth surely you are one of the</p>  
 <p>abject ones. Go out as you are degraded and rebuked and stoned as</p>  
 <p>Allah had cursed the violators of Sabbath and command of Allah shall be</p>  
 <p>executed. Blessed is Allah the best of the creators. O life, O life in the</p>  
 <p>name of Allah Who is eternal which is written on the forehead of Israfeel</p>  
 <p>be away from the one who has worn this talisman whether you are jinn</p>  
 <p>or fairy, devil or devils, male or female, male or female magician, ghost</p>  
 <p>or witch or any other thing who plays with the son of Adam or Eve.</p>  
 <p>There is no power or strength except for Allah the exalted and High. And</p>  
 <p>O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, the pure and</p>  
 <p>infallible ones.</p>
