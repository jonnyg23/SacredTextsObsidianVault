 <p>His supplication to be written on the deer's</p>  
 <p>skin to avert black magic</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>In the name of Allah and by Allah, glorified is Allah in the name of Allah</p>  
 <p>and there is no power or strength except Allah the most High, the Great.</p>  
 <p>Moosa (a.s.) said to them: What you have brought is deception, surely</p>  
 <p>Allah will make it naught; surely Allah does not make the work of</p>  
 <p>mischief-makers to thrive. And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by</p>  
 <p>His words, though the guilty may be averse (to it). So the truth was</p>  
 <p>established, and what they did became null. Thus they were vanquished</p>  
 <p>there, and they went back abased. (Surah Yunus: 81-82, Surah Araaf:</p>  
 <p>118-119)</p>
