 <p>His supplication seeking refuge from</p>  
 <p>show-off</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I seek refuge from You in being with goodness among people</p>  
 <p>and my inner self is full of defects in Your presence. I conceal my inner</p>  
 <p>self just to portray my outer self to the people but You are aware of the</p>  
 <p>true position better than me. It is as if I show people goodness and my</p>  
 <p>evil defects are clear to You, so that I am beloved of Your creatures and</p>  
 <p>far away from Your Pleasure.</p>
