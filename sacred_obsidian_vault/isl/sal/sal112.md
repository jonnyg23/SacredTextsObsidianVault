 <p>(111)</p>  
 <p>His supplication at the time of mid-day</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>I wish to seek proximity to You by Your grace and generosity and by</p>  
 <p>Your servant and Prophet, Muhammad peace be on him and his</p>  
 <p>progeny and through You and through the angels who are near to You</p>  
 <p>and Your Prophet. O Allah, self-sufficiency belongs to You and for me is</p>  
 <p>the dependency in Your Presence. You are rich and I am indigent.</p>  
 <p>Forgive my laxities, conceal my sins, and today fulfill my desires, and</p>  
 <p>whatever sins You are aware of, don't chastise me, but put me in Your</p>  
 <p>mercy and Generosity.</p>  
 <p>(Then go in Sajdah and recite)</p>  
 <p>O the center of piety, O the possessor of forgiveness, O the most</p>  
 <p>generous for the doers of good. You are more generous than my father,</p>  
 <p>my mother and all the creatures. Pass my life in fulfilling my desires.</p>  
 <p>Accept my prayers, have mercy on my voice, You have averted various</p>  
 <p>types of difficulties from me.</p>
