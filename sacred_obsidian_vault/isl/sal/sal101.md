 <p>His supplication for Nafilah on Friday</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>In the name of Allah, In the name of Allah, In the name of Allah. The best</p>  
 <p>of the names, the most honoured names the most exalted names. By the</p>  
 <p>name of Allah Whose kingdom comprises of the earth and the Heavens.</p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah Who created every living thing from water. Praise is</p>  
 <p>for Allah Who enlivened my heart with faith, and bestowed Islam for me.</p>  
 <p>O Allah, accept my repentance, purify my heart, protect me and judge</p>  
 <p>me with goodness and safety in all conditions, and show me everything I</p>  
 <p>wish for in this world and the hereafter. Open up the doors of goodness</p>  
 <p>for me. O the one Who listens to our prayers.</p>
