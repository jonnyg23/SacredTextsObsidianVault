 <p>His supplication for seeking sustenance</p>  
 <p>(to be recited every morning after morning prayers)</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah Who gave me the power to recognize myself and have</p>  
 <p>not blinded my heart. Praise is for Allah Who included me in the nation</p>  
 <p>of Muhammad, peace of Allah be on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure</p>  
 <p>progeny. Praise be to Allah Who has kept my sustenance in His hands</p>  
 <p>and not left it in the hands of people. Praise is for Allah Who has</p>  
 <p>concealed my defects and has not degraded me among the people.</p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah the unique.</p>
