 <p>Another of his supplications to be recited in</p>  
 <p>the morning</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Praise for Allah Who has not left me dead or sick in the morning, neither</p>  
 <p>my veins have any sign of defect nor He has accounted me for my</p>  
 <p>horrible deeds. Neither He has discontinued my sequence nor made me</p>  
 <p>a disbeliever nor I am a denier of my Lord, neither I am terrified of my</p>  
 <p>faith nor do I doubt my intellect nor punished in the chastisment the</p>  
 <p>earlier nations. I am like the one who has done injustice on his soul. My</p>  
 <p>Lord, Your proof is upon me and no proof of mine is upon You. I do not</p>  
 <p>possess the power that I gain something except Your religion in which</p>  
 <p>nobody is saved, except whom You save. O Allah! I seek refuge that in</p>  
 <p>spite of Your Self-Sufficiency I remain dependent and I remain deviated</p>  
 <p>after Your guidance or I remain degraded in Your kingdom or I remain</p>  
 <p>oppressed in Your domain. O Allah! My soul is the best bounty from</p>  
 <p>among Your bounties which You will take from me. O Allah I seek refuge</p>  
 <p>in You, that without Your permission I do not put my foot down and that</p>  
 <p>is the first bounty which You will take from the other bounties or else be</p>  
 <p>a target of corruption and deviation, or our wishes makes us Your</p>  
 <p>obedient other than that guidance which has come to us through You.</p>
