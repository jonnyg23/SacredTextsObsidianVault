 <p>Another of His supplication for the return of</p>  
 <p>the one who flees</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! This sky is Your sky, and this earth is Your earth. And the dry</p>  
 <p>land is Your dry land and the sea is Your sea and whatever is between</p>  
 <p>them in the world and the hereafter is Yours. O Allah make this earth</p>  
 <p>narrow for so and so, son of so and so (here mention the name). Put</p>  
 <p>Your hold on his eyes, ears and heart and darken his ways of exit like</p>  
 <p>stormy waters in which waves after waves starts gushing in and the</p>  
 <p>clouds cover it, one darkness covers the other darkness. So that when</p>  
 <p>he brings out his hand it is not visible and he whom Allah does not give</p>  
 <p>light from where can he get light?</p>  
 <p>(Write Ayatul Kursi and hang it for 3 days near his residence. By the will</p>  
 <p>of Allah that person would return soon.)</p>
