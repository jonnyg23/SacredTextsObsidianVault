 <p>His supplication when he was aggrieved</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Look at me attentively with the eyes, which never sleep, and</p>  
 <p>help me with the power, which is never subdued, and forgive me by</p>  
 <p>Your Grace. O Lord! When You are my hope I can never be destroyed.</p>  
 <p>O Lord! You are far greater and above to the one whom I fear, I seek</p>  
 <p>success from Allah and I turn through the means of Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) the messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny). O</p>  
 <p>the sufficient and the protector of Prophet Ibrahim and O the one to save</p>  
 <p>Moosa from the clutches of PHAROH, save me from these problems.</p>  
 <p>Allah is my nourisher and I do not ascribe a partner to Him. Sufficient is</p>  
 <p>He as a nourisher for all other nourishers, the Creator for all the</p>  
 <p>creations and the one to stop from prohibited things. Allah is sufficient</p>  
 <p>except Whom there no God and one on Whom I rely. He is the Lord of</p>  
 <p>the great throne.</p>
