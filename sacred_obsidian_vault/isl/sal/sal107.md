 <p>(106)</p>  
 <p>His supplication for memorizing the Quran</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah bestow upon me Your mercy so that I am away from Your</p>  
 <p>disobedience and bestow the grace that I am not involved in unbearable</p>  
 <p>difficulties, and grant me the goodness for deeds which make You</p>  
 <p>happy with me, and make the memorizing of Your book (the Holy Quran)</p>  
 <p>obligatory on me as You have granted me it's knowledge, and bestow</p>  
 <p>Your grace so that I recite it in the way Your pleasure is gained. O Allah</p>  
 <p>illuminate my eyes, expand my breast, illuminate my heart and my</p>  
 <p>tongue flows with the Holy Quran. Give me the strength so that I use my</p>  
 <p>body for the Holy Quran, grant me Your help because there is no helper</p>  
 <p>other than You and there is no god other that You.</p>
