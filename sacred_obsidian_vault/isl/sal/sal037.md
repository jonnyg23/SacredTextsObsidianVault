 <p>His supplication when he was ill</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Whenever You bestow a bounty upon me, my thanks is always</p>  
 <p>less and whenever You tried me in calamities, my patience was scanty.</p>  
 <p>Then O the one Who never made my thanksgiving being low, and O the</p>  
 <p>one Who, when He sent the calamities, my patience was very less yet</p>  
 <p>He never deprived me of anything and O He Who sees me doing sins</p>  
 <p>but never degrades me. And O He that saw me openly committing sins</p>  
 <p>but never punished me. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny.</p>  
 <p>Forgive me my sins and grant me cure from my sickness. Indeed You</p>  
 <p>have power over all things.</p>
