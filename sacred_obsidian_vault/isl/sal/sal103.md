 <p>His supplication after the five daily prayers.</p>  
 <p>Recite Surah Tauheed twelve times then spread your hands and</p>  
 <p>recite the following Dua:</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I beseech You by Your safe, concealed, pure and blessed</p>  
 <p>names and I seek Your great names and Your great strength that You</p>  
 <p>bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, and grant me respite from</p>  
 <p>fire, and remove me from this world peacefully and make me enter the</p>  
 <p>heaven cleansed of all sins. And make the beginning of my prayers a</p>  
 <p>success and the middle a success and the end filled completely with</p>  
 <p>goodness, as surely You understand the concealed things clearly.</p>
