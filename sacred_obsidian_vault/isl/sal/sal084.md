 <p>His supplication when someone praised him</p>  
 <p>in his presence</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! You know me better than I know myself and I am more aware of</p>  
 <p>myself than these people. O Allah make me as good as they think and</p>  
 <p>forgive my deeds, which they are ignorant of.</p>
