 <p>(108)</p>  
 <p>His supplication after completing eight</p>  
 <p>rakats (units) of midnight prayers</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I ask You by the honour of that person who has sought refuge</p>  
 <p>in You and the refuge of Your Honour rested in the shade of Your</p>  
 <p>Majesty and was familiar with Your ways and had no hopes from anyone</p>  
 <p>else. O the giver of great rewards. O the one to free the indigents, O the</p>  
 <p>one Who has praised Himself with generosity and has named himself</p>  
 <p>"Wahab" (the bestower) and that I call on You, in fear and anxiety in</p>  
 <p>greed and success, in helplessness and freedom, in gains and loses,</p>  
 <p>standing and sitting, in bowing and prostrating, in walking and mounting,</p>  
 <p>coming and going, so much so that in all conditions I ask You to send</p>  
 <p>Your mercy and blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny</p>  
 <p>(ask for Your needs over here).</p>
