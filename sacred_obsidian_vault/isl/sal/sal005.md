 <p>His (a.s.) supplication praising Allah (a.j.)</p>  
 <p>as taught to Janab-e-Owais-e-Qarni</p>  
 <p>Dua-e-Owais-e-Qarni</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O True Safety! O believer! O True Protector! O possessor of Honour</p>  
 <p>and great Heights! Pure and Purifying! Overpowering and powerful!</p>  
 <p>Possessor of Power. O the one Who is called in different languages,</p>  
 <p>dialects and words at the time of various needs. O the one Whose one</p>  
 <p>condition does not fear the other condition. You are the One that times</p>  
 <p>cannot change, space cannot contain You. Neither sleep nor laziness</p>  
 <p>overtakes You. Ease for me my affair whose possibility I fear. Ease for</p>  
 <p>me all those things, which trouble me. You are Pure, there is no lord</p>  
 <p>other than You. I confess I have done wrong, committed misdeeds</p>  
 <p>committed injustice on my soul. Thus forgive me, as there is no one</p>  
 <p>other than You who can forgive. And praise is for Allah lord of the</p>  
 <p>Worlds and there is no power and strength, but with Allah and peace of</p>  
 <p>Allah be upon Muhammad, His Messenger (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny</p>  
 <p>(a.s.) and salutations be upon them.</p>
