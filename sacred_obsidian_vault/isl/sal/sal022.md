 <p>Dua for seeking forgiveness</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I ask You as all the praise belongs to You. There is no lord</p>  
 <p>other than You, You are the One to bestow favours. The originator of</p>  
 <p>the skies and the earth. The You are the possessor of Honour and</p>  
 <p>Majesty, Originator of the Heavens and the Earth. I am poor and</p>  
 <p>indigent and fearful and seeking refuge. I repent and seek forgiveness.</p>  
 <p>O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and forgive all my</p>  
 <p>sins whether they are old or new. All those sins which I have performed.</p>  
 <p>O Allah don't make my problems difficult for me and don't give my</p>  
 <p>enemies an opportunity to mock at me because there is no one other</p>  
 <p>than You to ward off the difficulties and ease the hardships.</p>
