 <p>His Dua seeking forgiveness</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah I seek forgiveness from those things which I have repeated after</p>  
 <p>repenting for it and I repent to You for those things which were intended</p>  
 <p>for You but while doing them the intention changed which was not for</p>  
 <p>You. And I seek Your forgiveness from those bounties which were</p>  
 <p>bestowed for Your obedience but I used them for Your disobedience and</p>  
 <p>I repent for it that there is no one other than Allah, He is the living, the</p>  
 <p>self existing, Knower of the unseen and Omnipresent, the Beneficent the</p>  
 <p>Merciful. I seek forgiveness for all those sins which I have committed</p>  
 <p>and of all those sins which I have initiated. O Allah give me perfect</p>  
 <p>intelligence and enlighten my wishes and intellect, clean heart,</p>  
 <p>abundance knowledge, clear ethics, all these things which are beneficial</p>  
 <p>to me and not harmful to me. O the One Who is most Beneficial by Your</p>  
 <p>mercy (then recite five times) "I seek refuge in Allah there is no lord</p>  
 <p>except Him, the living, the self existent. To Him do I repent. (I seek</p>  
 <p>forgiveness from Allah Who is without a heir and is alive, and the</p>  
 <p>supporter of the universe and I turn to Him in repentance.)</p>
