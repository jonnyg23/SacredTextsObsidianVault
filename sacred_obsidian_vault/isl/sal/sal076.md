 <p>His supplication when he used to fight the</p>  
 <p>enemy</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! My heart is present in Your Domain and the head is bowed</p>  
 <p>down and eyes are fixed at You, feet are trembling and the body has</p>  
 <p>become weak, old enmities are manifested; pots of malice are boiling</p>  
 <p>out. O Allah! I complain to You of the absence of our Prophet and the</p>  
 <p>abundance of the enemies, and the colorful desires. O Allah! Grant truth</p>  
 <p>a victory between my enemies, and me, as You are the best of those</p>  
 <p>Who bestow victory.</p>
