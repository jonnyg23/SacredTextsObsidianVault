 This celebrated Sufi poem,
 also known as <cite>Conference of the Birds</cite>,
 by the 12th century Persian poet Farid ud-Din Attar,
 is a tale of a journey of a group of thirty birds to the summit of the
 world mountain, Qaf.
 An allegory of the Sufi journey to realization of the nature of God,
 each bird has a particular signficance, a special fault, and a tale to tell.
 </p>
 <p>
 In spite of its significance for world literature and the study of religion,
 Attar's poem was not translated in its entirety until the mid-twentieth
 century, and the standard English translations are
 hence not in the public domain.
 However Edward FitzGerald, best known as the translator of
 <a href="../khayyam.txt">The Rubayyat of Omar Khayyam</a> 
 worked on this abridged translation of the <cite>Bird Parliament</cite>
 through 1857.
 It is little known today, primarily because it was only published
 posthumously (FitzGerald died in 1883),
 in <cite>Letters and Literary Remains</cite>, edited by
 William Aldis Wright, in 1889.
 This is the first time an etext of FitzGerald's translation of this work has
 been posted on the Internet.
