 <p>Then said the disciples: 'Verily God speaketh in thee, for never hath man spoken as thou speakest.'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus answered: 'Believe me when God chose me to send me to the house of Israel, he gave me a book like unto a clear mirror which came down into my heart in such wise that all that I speak cometh forth from that book. And when that book shall have finished coming forth from my mouth, I shall be taken up from the world.'</p>
 
 <p>Peter answered: 'O master, is that which thou now speakest written in that book?'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus replied: 'All that I say for the knowledge of God and the service of God, for the knowledge of man and for the salvation of mankind—all this cometh forth from that book, which is my gospel.'</p>
 
 <p>Said Peter: 'Is there written therein the glory of paradise?'</p>
