 <h3>7. The visitation of Jesus by magi, and their return to their own country, with the warning of Jesus given to them in a dream.</h3>
 
 <p>The magi therefore departed out of Jerusalem, and lo, the star which appeared to them in the east went before them. Seeing the star the magi were filled with gladness. And so having come to Bethlehem, outside the city, they saw the star standing still above the inn where Jesus was born. The magi therefore went thither, and entering the dwelling found the child with his mother, and bending down they did obeisance to him. And the magi presented unto him spices, with silver and gold, recounting to the virgin all that they had seen.</p>
 
 <p>Whereupon, while sleeping, they were warned by the child not to go to Herod; so departing by another way they returned to their own home, announcing all that they had seen in Judaea.</p>
