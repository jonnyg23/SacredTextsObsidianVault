 <h3>38.</h3>
 
 <p>Then answered John: 'Master, let us wash ourselves as God</p>
 <p>commanded by Moses.'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus said: 'Think ye that I am come to destroy the law and</p>
 <p>the prophets? Verily I say unto you, as God liveth, I am not come to</p>
 <p>destroy it, but rather to observe it. For every prophet hath observed</p>
 <p>the law of God and all that God by the other prophets hath spoken.</p>
 <p>As God liveth, in whose presence my soul standeth, no one that</p>
 <p>breaketh one least precept can be pleasing to God, but shall be least</p>
 <p>in the kingdom of God, for he shall have no part there. Moreover I</p>
 <p>say unto you, that one syllable of the law of God cannot be broken</p>
 <p>without the gravest sin. But I do you to wit that it is necessary to</p>
 <p>observe that which God saith by Isaiah the prophet, with these</p>
 <p>words: "Wash you and be clean, take away your thoughts from</p>
 <p>mine eyes."</p>
 
 <p>'Verily I say unto you, that all the water of the sea will not wash</p>
 <p>him who with his heart loveth iniquities. And furthermore I say unto</p>
 <p>you, that no one will make prayer pleasing to God if he be not washed,</p>
 <p>but will burden his soul with sin like to idolatry.</p>
 
 <p>'Believe me, in sooth, that if man should make prayer to God</p>
 <p>as is fitting, he would obtain all that he should ask. Remember</p>
 <p>Moses the servant of God, who with his prayer scourged Egypt,</p>
 <p>opened the Red Sea, and there drowned Pharaoh and his host.</p>
 <p>Remember Joshua, who made the sun stand still, Samuel, who</p>
 <p>smote with fear the innumerable host of the Philistines, Elijah, who</p>
 <p>made the fire to rain from heaven, Elisha raised a dead man, and so</p>
 <p>many other holy prophets, who by prayer obtained all that they</p>
 <p>asked. But those men truly did not seek their own in their matters,</p>
 <p>but sought only God and his honour.'</p>
