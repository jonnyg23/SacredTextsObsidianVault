 <h3>170.</h3>
 
 <p>'God saith thus to the man who shall faithfully serve him: "I know thy works, that thou workest for me. As I live eternally, thy love shall not exceed my bounty. Because thou servest me as God thy creator, knowing thyself to be my work, and askest nought of me save grace and mercy to serve me faithfully; because thou settest no end to my service, seeing thou desirest to serve me eternally; even so will I do, for I will reward thee as if thou wert God, mine equal. For not only will I place in thy hands the abundance of paradise, but I will give thee myself as a gift; so that, even as thou art fain to be my servant for ever, even so will I make thy wages for ever."'</p>
