 <p>'As God liveth, brethern, I fear lest God be angered against me. Therefore ye needs must go through Judaea and Israel, preaching to the twelve tribes of Israel the truth, that they may be undeceived.'</p>
 
 <p>The disciples answered with fear, weeping: 'We will do whatsoever thou shalt bid us.'</p>
 
 <p>Then said Jesus: 'Let us for three days make prayer and fast and from henceforth every evening when the first star shall appear, when prayer is made to God, let us make prayer three times, asking Him three times for mercy; because the sin of Israel is three times more grievous than other sins.'</p>

 <p>Then answered he who writeth: 'It is most true.'</p>
