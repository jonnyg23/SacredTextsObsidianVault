 <p align="center"><small>AN ODE TO SPRING.</small></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From</span> whence hath the spring again returned unto us,<br> Which hath made the country round a garden of flowers?</p>  
 <p>There are the anemone and sweet basil, the lily and thyme;<br> The jasmine and white rose, the narcissus and pomegranate blossom.</p>  
 <p>The wild flowers of spring are manifold, and of every hue;<br> But the dark-red tulip, above them all, predominateth.</p>  
 <p>The maidens place nosegays of flowers in their bosoms;<br> The youths, too, fasten bouquets of them in their turbans.</p>  
 <p>Come now, musician! apply the bow to thy violin:<br> Bring out the tone and the melody of every string!</p>  
 <p>And thou, cupbearer! bring us full and overflowing cups,<br> That I may become fraught with wine's inebriety!</p>  
 <p>The Af<u>gh</u>ān youths have again dyed red their hands,<br> Like as the falcon dyeth his talons in the blood of the quarry.</p>  
 <p>They have made rosy their bright swords with gore:<br> The tulip-bed hath blossomed, even in the heat of summer.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>Ae-mal <u>Kh</u>ān and Dar-yā <u>Kh</u>ān—from death preserve them! <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> Were neither of them, at fault, when opportunity occurred.</p>  
 <p>They dyed red the valley of <u>Kh</u>aibar, with the blood of the foe:<br> On Karrapah, <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">†</font></a> too, they poured forth war's din and tumult.</p>  
 <p>From Karrapah, even unto Bājawrr, <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">‡</font></a> both plain and mountain,<br> Time after time, as from an earthquake, quaked and shook.</p>  
 <p>It is now the fifth year, since in this neighbourhood,<br> Every day heareth the clashing of glittering swords.</p>  
 <p>Since I arrived in this part, <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">§</font></a> I have become a nonentity—<br> Either I am despicable, or this people are infamous grown.</p>  
 <p>I cry out unto them, "Troops, troops," until I am weary;<br> But deaf to all, they neither say "Die," nor "Thy sacrifice." <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">§§</font></a></p>  
 <p>When the state of the Yūsufzīs became known unto me,<br> Lowā<u>gh</u>ar was then my better place, not Dam<u>gh</u>ār.</p>  
 <p>The dogs of the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>aks are far better than the Yūsufzīs,<br> Though, in disposition, the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>aks are more worthless than dogs.</p>  
 <p>The whole of the other Af<u>gh</u>āns, from Ḳandahār unto A<u>tt</u>ak,<br> In honour's cause, both secretly and openly, are one.</p>  
 <p>See how many battles have been fought on all sides;<br> Yet still, amongst the Yūsufzīs, there is no sense of shame.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p>The first fight was at the higher back of Mount Tatārah, <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> Where forty thousand Mu<u>gh</u>als were scattered like chaff.</p>  
 <p>When their sisters and daughters fell into the bonds of the Af<u>gh</u>āns,<br> With horses and camels, elephants and baggage, string after string.</p>  
 <p>The second battle was with Mir Husain in the Doābah, <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">†</font></a><br> When his head was crushed, like that of a venemous snake.</p>  
 <p>After that again, was the affair at the fort of Noh<u>sh</u>airah, <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">‡</font></a><br> When from the Mu<u>gh</u>als I extracted my own inebriation.</p>  
 <p>And then came Jaswant Singh and <u>Sh</u>ujaæat <u>Kh</u>ān,<br> Of whom, Ae-mal <u>Kh</u>ān plucked up the roots at Gandāb.</p>  
 <p>The sixth was over Mukarram <u>Kh</u>ān and <u>Sh</u>am<u>sh</u>er <u>Kh</u>ān,<br> Both of whom, at <u>Kh</u>āpa<u>sh</u>, Ae-mal scattered to the winds.</p>  
 <p>These are the greatest triumphs that I hold in recollection;<br> But the lesser ones, in all directions, who shall compute?</p>  
 <p>Up to the present time, victory hath been always with us;<br> And for the future, upon God, is our dependence placed.</p>  
 <p>A year hath passed since Aurangzeb is encamped against us,<br> Disordered and perplexed in appearance, and wounded in heart.</p>  
 <p>It is now year after year, that his nobles fall in battle;<br> But his armies swept away, who shall number them!</p>  
 <p>The treasures of India have been spread out before us:<br> The red gold <i>muhurs</i> have been engulphed in the hills.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>It would not have entered one's head in eighteen guesses,<br> That such events would e’er have happened in these parts.</p>  
 <p>Still Aurangzeb's malevolence hath not a whit diminished,<br> Though the curses of his father it before drew down. <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>For this reason, also, no one can place dependence on him:<br> He is malignant and perfidious; a breaker of his word.</p>  
 <p>For this state of things, no other termination can be seen,<br> Than that the Mu<u>gh</u>als be annihilated, or the Af<u>gh</u>āns undone.</p>  
 <p>If this, which is beheld, be the revolutions of destiny—<br> If in this be the will of the Almighty, the time is come.</p>  
 <p>Fate revolveth not in the same fashion at all times<br> Now ’tis propitious to the rose; now favourable to the thorn.</p>  
 <p>At a period so pregnant with honour and glory, as the present,<br> In what manner do these base and recreant Af<u>gh</u>āns act? <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">†</font></a></p>  
 <p>There is no deliverance in any thing, save the sword:<br> Af<u>gh</u>āns, who nourish any other idea than this, are lost, indeed.</p>  
 <p>The Af<u>gh</u>āns are far superior to the Mu<u>gh</u>als at the sword,<br> Were but the Af<u>gh</u>āns, in intellect, a little discreet.</p>  
 <p>If the different tribes would but support each other,<br> Kings would have to bow down in prostration before them.</p>  
 <p>But whether it be concord or strife, or folly or wisdom,<br> The affairs of every one are in the hands of the Almighty.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>Let us see what the Afrīdīs, Mohmands, and <u>Sh</u>īnwāris will do;<br> For the Mu<u>gh</u>als are now lying encamped at Nangrahār. <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>I alone, amongst the Af<u>gh</u>āns, grieve for our honour and renown;<br> Whilst the Yūsufzīs, at their ease, are tilling their fields.</p>  
 <p>They who now act so dishonourably, and so shamelessly,<br> Will, hereafter, the upshot of their own acts perceive.</p>  
 <p>In my poor judgment, death is more preferable than life,<br> When existence can no longer, with honour, be enjoyed.</p>  
 <p>In this world, he will not always remain with life;<br> But the memory of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span> will long, long endure!</p>  
 <p>It was the first of the Third Sister, <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">†</font></a> in the year of <u>Gh</u>afū <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">‡</font></a><br> That I, whilst at Barmawul, indited these lines.</p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
 <p>What wonderfully delicious wine is this,<br> Which the cupbearer, with welcome, presents!</p>  
 <p>The laughing of the bud in the parterre were impossible,<br> Did not the zephyr, every morning, over it pass.</p>  
 <p>Its counsel regarding the nightingale was this,<br> That the morn should the rosebud's garment rend. <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">§</font></a></p>

 <p>Appreciate thou the value of Philomel, O rose,<br> Although thou bloomest in this thy beauty now!</p>  
 <p>Since his cure dependeth upon the object of his heart,<br> Of the lover's disease, what do physicians know?</p>  
 <p>Save the beloved-one's beaming countenance, imagine not<br> That <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span> will be, with any other face, content.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
 <p>Spring hath returned: the narcissus in the garden wantoneth,<br> And the breeze of the morning, the spikenard disordereth.</p>  
 <p>For five short days, the rose of the parterre will bloom;<br> But on the sixth, it scattereth its existence to the winds.</p>  
 <p>The enamoured nightingale layeth its head at the rose's feet,<br> As the Brahman bendeth, in adoration, his idol before.</p>  
 <p>Acquire thou humility from the example of the cypress,<br> That with such loftiness, showeth this much lowliness.</p>  
 <p>The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Karlārrnaey</span> <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">*</font></a> hath quaffed no other wine whatever—<br> The whole of this inebriety proceedeth from creation's cup. <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">†</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
 <p>My beloved is offended: would there were any one who would conciliate her!<br> Arise quickly, O mediator! for my heart is grieved on her account.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="green">p. 155</font></a></p>  
 <p>He will be constantly plunging into the deep seas of injustice,<br> Who rendereth up his heart unto the heart-ravishers of these days.</p>  
 <p>What a vile world it is! what are its customs! what its ways!<br> It abandoneth, altogether, the starving, and giveth invitation to the cloyed!</p>  
 <p>Punished they cannot be; but would I could lay hands, as I wish, on them;<br> For ’tis those sable locks of thine, that are ever of hearts making theft.</p>  
 <p>The tyranny of thy dark tresses is by no means hidden from view—<br> The impassioned-one, who may be powerful, soon her tyranny displayeth.</p>  
 <p>Thou that givest thyself unto the tender passion, accept in love<br> The taunts and reproaches, that the world, upon lovers, ever cast.</p>  
 <p>Thy blood-thirsty locks have not made me, only, desolate;<br> And many more, like unto me, forlorn, will they, even yet, destroy.</p>  
 <p>Wouldst thou, this one so arrogant of her beauty see, draw near!<br> Alas! towards <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>, her coquetry she openly displayeth.</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
 <p>Wherefore doth Aurangzeb his throne and crown adorn?<br> For death will assail, and lay waste the both of them.</p>  
 <p>His evil name only will remain behind in the world;<br> Knowing, as he doth, whether he as Kasrā, or as Hujāj acteth. <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="green">p. 156</font></a></p>  
 <p>O’erwhelmed in grief, I know not of festival or feast,<br> Though the whole people of Dilhī make gladness and joy.</p>  
 <p>All the water went to the eyes, and the heart's fire blazed out—<br> Alas, how can any one, in such a state of mind as this exist!</p>  
 <p>They turn pale when they lay finger upon my pulse;<br> Then, by what means, can the physicians, my disorder cure?</p>  
 <p>Separation lacerateth my heart in the same manner,<br> As the falcon rendeth the partridge and the quail.</p>  
 <p>When two friends may be separated by a distant land,<br> How desirous God maketh them of a mere salutation!</p>  
 <p>My tears are produced through the emotions of the heart,<br> Like as fire expelleth the moisture from the roasting meat.</p>  
 <p>Alas, every arrow that is discharged from fatality's bow,<br> Destiny maketh poor <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl's</span> heart the butt of!</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
 <p>Thou wast saying, "Grieve not any more; for I am thine, and thou art mine:"<br> Whether thou hast falsely or truly spoken, thou hast, indeed, given me life again.</p>  
 <p>What a lovely calamity thou art! a charmer, incomparable, art thou!<br> Would that there were not this defect, that thou hadst not such a cruel heart!</p>  
 <p>Should the whole universe, in every direction, be with the lovely filled;<br> Even then, it would be astonishing, if one were found beautiful like thee.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="green">p. 157</font></a></p>  
 <p>With so many victims slain, even yet thou showiest no pity or regret:<br> But what matter, though the executioner shed blood a hundred times over?</p>  
 <p>Since out of thy garden, or thy parterre, I beg for a rose from thee,<br> Shouldst thou but a straw on me bestow, yet I, as a rose, receive it.</p>  
 <p>As long as I may exist, I am, indeed, the captive of those ringlets,<br> In every hair of which, hundreds of hearts will ever be enthralled.</p>  
 <p>Whether old, or whether young, all are distracted about thee:<br> There is not a person in the town, that is not enamoured of thee.</p>  
 <p>The cypress-tree behold! it very soon ceaseth to be looked upon,<br> When thou, with this stature and figure, through the garden trippest.</p>  
 <p>The prospect of Heaven to come, is bliss to both monk and priest;<br> But <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span> hath gained Paradise, at once, in meeting thee.</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
 <p>Again the minstrel's rebeck toucheth the heart profoundly;<br> For it discovereth new and fresh strains of melodious harmony.</p>  
 <p>Leave the monk in the monastery's nook! I will to the garden;<br> For the flowers of spring instruct me in righteousness’ ways.</p>  
 <p>Beggars have much anxiety about filling their bellies;<br> And kings should be solicitous regarding dominion and realm.</p>  
 <p>If this be not the effect of my good fortune, what is it then,<br> That against the guardian she crieth out to this degree?</p>  
 <p>How much more will be the extent of the love of her constancy,<br> When, in injustice and inconstancy, such favour she bestoweth?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p>Within this city, the juice of the grape is thus so openly sold;<br> Because the censor, himself, favoureth the bibbers of wine.</p>  
 <p>From thy coldness to me, I grow both joyful and melancholy,<br> Like unto one that giveth thanks to, and yet complaineth of another.</p>  
 <p>If to love to look upon the pretty creatures be aught of sinfulness,<br> Then <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span> committeth iniquity, all his life long.</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
 <p>When towards his father a son acteth perfidiously,<br> After what manner, to others, will he sincerity show?</p>  
 <p>See, what further perfidy must be within his heart,<br> When the hypocrite maketh avowal of his own misdeeds.</p>  
 <p>Neither will I pardon the enormities of the degenerate,<br> Nor will the Almighty forgive the fallen angel his sins.</p>  
 <p>All these minor hills are as nothing: desirous am I,<br> That my God, betwixt us, would place even Ḳāf <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">*</font></a> itself.</p>  
 <p>The conduct of his own son is best known to his father;<br> Then why will people commend the degenerate unto me?</p>  
 <p>Neither can any liar utter falsehoods like him,<br> Nor can any one equal him in cunning and deceit.</p>  
 <p>There are both a thousand varieties of vain lies in his heart,<br> And a thousand vaunts of morality upon his tongue.</p>  
 <p>That I cherished, and brought up such an undutiful son,<br> It was, alas! for this, that he should, against me, rise up!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p>Let me not, indeed, cast eyes upon him whilst I live;<br> And after death, let him not dare my grave to approach.</p>  
 <p>Sorrow and grief shall, whilst living, leave his heart,<br> If fate, unto <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>, shall due justice grant.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
 <p>Every sick person that is impatient with his physician,<br> Bringeth, if thou but consider, affliction upon himself.</p>  
 <p>The fish existeth in the river; but should it come out thereof,<br> Can it be comfortable, or at ease, upon the dry land?</p>  
 <p>Though the bat hideth himself from the light of the sun,<br> In what manner doth the sun sustain injury therefrom?</p>  
 <p>’Tis the nature of dogs to howl at the sight of the moon;<br> And thus, by their yelping, bring disgrace on themselves.</p>  
 <p>The dung-beetle is distressed by the flower's perfume;<br> Because its existence is sustained by offensiveness.</p>  
 <p>That the prophets are evil in the sight of the infidel,<br> Is, because whatever they do, is with the Devil's advice.</p>  
 <p>Unfortunate, indeed, is he, who acteth on his enemy's counsel:<br> Can an opponent and an enemy ever give good advice?</p>  
 <p>The heron, on the river's bank, is with thirst parched;<br> For every penurious creature followeth his own avaricious ways.</p>  
 <p>With the precepts of the Ḳur’ān, Fārūḳ is acquainted:<br> It pointeth not out the right path to Bū-Lḥab, or to Bū-Jhal. <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>The purity of the Musalmān, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>! is possible;<br> But no ablutions, no purifications, can make the Gabr <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">*</font></a> clean.</p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
 <p>Through sorrow at the poor-spiritedness of the Af<u>gh</u>āns,<br> I have abandoned greatness, and taken meanness in hand.</p>  
 <p>Had this much even been gained in the matter, it were good—<br> Had I wreaked upon the recreant my full meed of revenge.</p>  
 <p>From the time when the jewel of my honour became broken,<br> I have not left, for a moment, my eyes free from tears.</p>  
 <p>That pearl came not into my hands, after all my trouble,<br> And, therefore, my boat I have drawn up on the sea-shore.</p>  
 <p>This waist of mine, that in resistance was a mountain,<br> Through chagrin and disappointment, unto the Mu<u>gh</u>al I bent.</p>  
 <p>But let good fortune once commence again to aid me,<br> That it may relieve me from the weight of affliction's load</p>  
 <p>This misery of mine is not to be compared to any other grief,<br> Although I may have experienced a thousand woes and sorrows.</p>  
 <p>The back of fortune, and. the world's, both are turned upon me;<br> Hence, through sorrow, I turned my face from all, the Mu<u>gh</u>al unto.</p>  
 <p>Were it in my power, or were it mine own free-will,<br> I would not, even two paces, towards them advance.</p>  
 <p>I am obliged to hearken to crooked words from the mouths of those,<br> Unto whom, in my lifetime, I never before a straight one gave.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p>The outcries of my own people, and of strangers, affect me,<br> Notwithstanding I used, even from a whisper, to screen myself.</p>  
 <p>I am now ashamed of those proud and boastful words,<br> That, before every one, were wont to issue from my lips.</p>  
 <p>A hundred reproaches and indignities are heaped upon me,<br> Who ever guarded myself from detraction and reproach.</p>  
 <p>’Tis for this reason the elephant streweth dust upon his head, <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> That I made him acquainted with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl's</span> sorrows.</p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
 <p>If, for once only, she will show her face from the veil,<br> She will take the diploma of beauty from the sun.</p>  
 <p>The tulip shall borrow bloom from her countenance;<br> The hyacinth will grow furious at the sight of her curls.</p>  
 <p>Wherefore Both the world accuse fortune thus falsely?<br> ’Tis she, that with her eyes, hath desolated the world.</p>  
 <p>Either those orbs of hers are red from wine's effects,<br> Or some one hath roused her from sleep, unseasonably.</p>  
 <p>She quaffeth the blood of hearts in the place of wine;<br> Then again, taketh roasted hearts, as au incitement to more.</p>  
 <p>The special death of the slaughtered by the hand of the beloved,<br> Is that they may enter Paradise, without rendering account.</p>  
 <p>Let my heart be a compass, and let it never vary or turn<br> In any other direction, save the altar of thine eyebrows unto.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></a></p>  
 <p>Do not be so overjoyed, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>! at all her vows;<br> For, from the bubble, no one hopeth for any constancy.</p>  <h4 align="center">XII.</h4>  
 <p>O zephyr of the morn! draw near unto the parterre;<br> For the flowers are overjoyed, in expectation of blooming.</p>  
 <p>What doth the hermit know, as to what thing love is?<br> Wherefore speakest thou to the owl, the garden concerning?</p>  
 <p>Though the monks perform their devotions five times a day,<br> I am ever prostrate, in devotion, unto the Giver of good.</p>  
 <p>As much as I behold thee, I do not become satiated,<br> Notwithstanding I gaze so intently upon thy face.</p>  
 <p>Again, indeed, place thou a scar on the anemone's heart,<br> When thou roamest in the garden, so joyous and gay.</p>  
 <p>Anger and kindness I perceive between thine eyebrows:<br> The tablet of thy forehead thou hast placed to be perused.</p>  
 <p>Sometimes, thou raisest strife; at others, showest kindness—<br> Simple hearted that I am, at such skill, I grow amazed.</p>  
 <p>If thou hast set thine heart upon my death, I too, say,<br> That thy tyranny hath brought me to death's door nigh.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIII.</h4>  
 <p>Draw near, and behold him now, with a clod beneath his head,<br> Who could not sleep upon a bed, without a pillow of feathers!</p>  
 <p>This, which they call the transient world, hath no existence, and is naught;<br> For this reason, O foolish man! ’tis hideous in the sight of the wise.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></a></p>  
 <p>This world is a scabby sheep—then what good is there in keeping it?<br> The shepherd, when he findeth out its scabbiness, expelleth it from the flock.</p>  
 <p>Is this a tempest or hail-storm, that both standing corn and stacks also go?<br> Out upon such a corn-field as this, since an ear of corn can not be found!</p>  
 <p>With these eyes of mine, I have beheld the noble and massive structures of kings,<br> Who coveted the world's dominion, but left them, all at once, behind!</p>  
 <p>A hundred thousand squadrons assemble, and collect the treasures of the world;<br> Be as Sanjar <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">*</font></a> for a few generations, and then neither thou nor thy race remain.</p>  
 <p>Thy house is on the face of a flood, and this thy contemptible idea is still worse;<br> For no one would there his dwelling make, that it should be swept by the flood away.</p>

 <p>Become thou the beggar at the tavern's door,<br> If along with the crown, thou dominion seek:<br> The mart of the wine-bibbers is crowded,<br> From this extensive sale of wine.</p>

 <p>He, who may neither possess modesty nor virtue, genius nor understanding,<br> Regard not his wealth, nor his beauty, nor his ancestral descent.</p>  
 <p>The wise man is in utter misery, whilst the fool reveleth in pleasure—<br> And well, indeed, may the world be amazed at such occurrences as these.</p>

 <p>Save the lips of the beloved, I take no other name upon my tongue;<br> For love hath abstracted from me all other memory and recollection.</p>  
 <p>My heart, on that day became disgusted with my own life,<br> When the hard-hearted one took it, entirely, from me.</p>  
 <p>By what law, indeed, hath she deprived me of sleep and repose,<br> That I weep and lament, and sigh and bewail, all the night long?</p>

 <p>It is the fire of wounded hearts, that hath enveloped the trees on the hills;<br> Hence, dense black smoke and flame arise, from the fir-tree and the plane.</p>

 <p>I am intoxicated! I am a worshipper of wine! I indulge! I indulge!<br> Give ear, O censor! dost hear me? I drink wine! I drink wine!</p>  
 <p>All other wine soever, I have given up to the world to drink of;<br> But her lip is a wine that I will not resign—for it I die! I die!</p>  
 <p>I shall not become satiated therefrom; for my thirst is unquenchable,<br> Although, such overflowing cups I should quaff for ever! for ever!</p>  
 <p>I, indeed, who on such a path as this, still journey on my way,<br> Used not always to be in safety; for it is the path of love! love!</p>  
 <p>What askest thou me?—"What was thy state in separation?"<br> Well—I knew nothing else, save that my heart was burning! burning!</p>  
 <p>People say unto me, "Verily thy colour is become sallow—thou art in love!"<br> I do not deny it: truly, my friends, I am in love! indeed, I am!</p>  
 <p>With the lover it is customary, that in love he should brook censure;<br> For this reason, I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>, undergo it—I suffer it, and endure!</p>  <h4 align="center">XLVI.</h4>  
 <p>I become quite astonished with the people of the world,<br> To see what these dogs do, for the sake of the flesh's lusts.</p>  
 <p>Such acts and proceedings are developed, and perpetrated by them,<br> As the Devil would never have thought of, and never have uttered.</p>  
 <p>The Ḳur’ān they always place before them, and from it they read;<br> But none of their doings will be in conformity with the tenets thereof.</p>

 <p>What road shall I follow in pursuit of them? where shall I seek?<br> For, like unto Alchemy itself, the wise have become scarce indeed.</p>  
 <p>Good men are like rubies and garnets—they can rarely be found;<br> But like unto any common stones, the worthless are not a few.</p>  
 <p>Do they belong to the afrīt, <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">*</font></a> the demon, or the goblin race?<br> For, among the lineage of Adam, the Af<u>gh</u>āns I cannot account.</p>  
 <p>Notwithstanding thou mayest give one the best of counsel and advice;<br> Still, even the counsel of his father is not acceptable to his heart.</p>  
 <p>The whole of the deeds of the Pa<u>tt</u>āns <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">†</font></a> are better than those of the Mu<u>gh</u>als;<br> But they have no unity amongst them, and a great pity it is.</p>  
 <p>The fame of Bahlol, and of <u>Sh</u>er <u>Sh</u>āh too, resoundeth in my ears—<br> Af<u>gh</u>ān Emperors of India, who swayed its sceptre effectively and well. <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">‡</font></a></p>  
 <p>For six or seven generations, did they govern so wisely,<br> That all their people were filled with admiration of them.</p>  
 <p>Either those Af<u>gh</u>āns were different, or these have greatly changed;<br> Or otherwise, at present, such is the Almighty's decree.</p>

 <p>Separation turneth sweet existence bitter unto man—<br> It layeth the very vitals upon fierce, devouring flames!</p>  
 <p>Whatever strength and energy the heart in the breast may possess,<br> Separation, out of these eyes, expelleth them, every now and again.</p>  
 <p>Than such existence as this, annihilation is preferable by far,<br> When one's days and nights all pass away, in misery and woe.</p>  
 <p>He faileth not to hit—he woundeth me to the very heart's core;<br> For the archer of grief hath bent the knee, to take aim at me.</p>  
 <p>The book of my heart is on the subject of constancy and love—<br> It was torn up; but no one acquired the meaning thereof.</p>  
 <p>If the gauze, which the moon rendeth, <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">*</font></a> can be again repaired,<br> Then the restoration of my poor heart, may also be effected.</p>  
 <p>Would to heaven such a person would appear—I am quite willing—<br> As would bring back my truant heart from the path of the beloved!</p>  
 <p>In separation, if there were no hope of meeting once more,<br> For the bewildered lover, there would be no possibility of existence.</p>  
 <p>When thou placest thy foot on that path, thy head payeth the forfeit;<br> Yet on such a dangerous road as this, I continually wend my way.</p>

 <p>Thy society is like unto the sea, and I, a fish therein;<br> But, separated from thee, I lament and bewail always.</p>  
 <p>Weeping, I would ask her to let me her fair cheek press;<br> But, laughing, she would ask, "What doth this man say?</p>  
 <p>She asked, too, "Who art thou, that wanderest in my street?"<br> To which, "Thy dog am I;"—thus to her a ready reply I gave.</p>  
 <p>I grieve in various ways, and my body hath a reed become:<br> Separation hath brought me to the plaintive pipe's condition. <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">‡</font></a>.</p>

 <p>When I die, I shall never see these sweet friends any more;<br> Then let me, O God, remain in this world for ever!</p>  
 <p>I grieve, indeed, for thy honour alone, not for myself:<br> Thou shouldst see how I would act, had I not this solicitude.</p>

 <p>Equal to that deliciousness, which I have, from thy lips, imbibed;<br> Term me a liar if such, as luscious, be in the wine-cup found.</p>  
 <p>Bear, O zephyr unto the nightingale, this message of mine—<br> "The rose's fragrance or its trace, in this parterre, will, doubtless, be."</p>  
 <p>For one moment, at least, sit thou with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span> in tranquillity,<br> That his heart may, from its heavy sorrows, some slight solace find!</p>  <h4 align="center">XCIV.</h4>  
 <p>From the lustre of the internal, the exterior is clear and bright;<br> But by intercourse with the base, there are a hundred ills.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></a></p>  
 <p>Like the name of alchemy and of the phœnix, that we hear about,<br> Than both of these, sincerity and fidelity are more rarely found.</p>  
 <p>From the lips of the despicable thou hearest a thousand things;<br> For when will they rest satisfied with a single harangue?</p>  
 <p>Do ṇot allow thyself to be deceived by friends of the present day—<br> Before thy face, they are for thee; but behind thee, back to back.</p>  
 <p>Do thou, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>! call in that great physician's aid,<br> In the refulgence of whose face there 's perfect cure for thee!</p>  <h4 align="center">XCV.</h4>  
 <p>Account him a good man, who, in heart, is innocent and pure;<br> For modesty and uprightness are manifest in him always.</p>  
 <p>He, who may not possess these few qualities, is not a man;<br> And whatever he wisheth let him do; for he is absolved from all.</p>  
 <p>They who contend with the world, for the sake of worldly goods,<br> Are like unto dogs, fighting and snarling, a mass of carrion upon.</p>  
 <p>If a wise man be, in appearance unsightly, what mattereth it<br> What though a homely scabbard hath been for a good blade made?</p>  
 <p>In these matters, no one else hath any business or concern whatever;<br> For ’tis the money-changer, that, distinguisheth the pure from the alloy.</p>  
 <p>The jeweller will himself make them show their respective qualities,<br> Though, in colour, the agate may be more pellucid than the ruby itself.</p>  
 <p>I wander everywhere in search of friendship, and find it not:<br> In what direction do they dwell, that know aught of faithfulness?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></a></p>  
 <p>He will not be acquainted with the art of weaving velvet,<br> Although the maker of mats is, also, among weavers accounted.</p>  
 <p>Love hath not proceeded either from what is true, or what is futile;<br> But manifold are the pilgrimages made to the idol of its shrine.</p>  
 <p>Those charming ones have grown so numerous, that I fear them now<br> I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>, that of my piety and godliness have boasted so much.</p>  <h4 align="center">XCVI.</h4>  
 <p>All woman-kind are of intellect deficient;<br> And the voluntary causes of all life's ills.</p>  
 <p>Thou mayst be straight and even with them;<br> But they are crooked and wayward with thee.</p>  
 <p>Do them a thousand benefits and services;<br> Yet, at a single word, their hearts sulky grow.</p>  
 <p>They become poison unto thee, and kill thee—<br> They, whom thou deemest a healing balm.</p>  
 <p>They have no fidelity in their composition:<br> They are, naturally, unto perfidiousness prone.</p>  
 <p>Created, indeed, in the figure of mankind;<br> But, in reality, with no humanity in them.</p>  
 <p>They make thee out culpable, on a slight offence;<br> But they cannot be wrong, however great their sins.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>The more crossness borne, the more petulant they:<br> The more whims brooked, the more capricious they grow.</p>  
 <p>In all things, they are fickle, and changeable:<br> Tame in tongue, <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">*</font></a> but untameable in heart.</p>  
 <p>They are beautiful in person, from head to foot;<br> But are like unto the wily serpent within.</p>  
 <p>Say no more about them, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl</span>!<br> It would be better had they never .existed!</p>  <h4 align="center">XCVII.</h4>  
 <p>I am of those eyes of thine enamoured—look thou upon me!<br> I am the Hindū slave of thy locks; but dispose not of me!</p>  
 <p>With this form, and these charms, that thou possessest,<br> It would be, indeed, wonderful, were any other born like thee.</p>  
 <p>In grace and loveliness, there is no one equal unto thee—<br> This is the pity, that thou art, wholly, pitiless and unkind.</p>  
 <p>Though I die of grief for thee, still thou turnest away from me:<br> What! is the love of thine heart turned so dark for me?</p>  
 <p>I will never abandon thy door, nor thy dwelling-place,<br> Though thou mayest, without fire, cruelly, me consume.</p>  
 <p>Shouldst thou inflict a thousand cruelties on me, imagine not,<br> That the love of my heart will, towards thee, ever be changed.</p>  
 <p>I am well off, sunk down contemptible, in the dust at thy door;<br> But not so elsewhere, though I should upon a throne recline.</p>
