 <p align="center"><small>IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD!</small></p>  <h4 align="center">I.</h4>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Behold</span>! such an Omnipotent Being is my God,<br> That He is the possessor of all power, authority, and will.</p>  
 <p>Should one enumerate all the most mighty, pure, and eminent,<br> My God is mightier, purer, and more eminent than all.</p>  
 <p>No want, nor requirement of His, is dependant upon any one;<br> Neither is my God under obligation, nor beholden to any.</p>  
 <p>Out of nothingness He produced the form of entity;<br> In such wise is my God the Creator, and the Nourisher of all.</p>  
 <p>He is the artist and the artificer of all and every created thing:<br> My God is, likewise, the hearer of every word and accent.</p>  
 <p>That which hath neither type nor parallel anywhere,<br> Its essence and its nature, its material and its principle, my God is.</p>  
 <p>All the structures, whether of this world or of that to come,<br> My God is the architect, and the builder of them all.</p>  
 <p>He is the decipherer and the construer of the unwritten pages—<br> The unfolder and the elucidator of all mysteries my God is.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></a></p>  
 <p>Apparent or manifest; hidden or obscure; intermediate or intercalary;<br> My God is cognizant of, and familiar with, all matters and things.</p>  
 <p>He hath neither partner nor associate—His dominion is from Himself alone<br> A sovereign, without colleague or coadjutor, my God is.</p>  
 <p>Not that His unity and individuality proceed from impuissance;<br> For, in His one and unique nature, He is infinite, unlimited.</p>  
 <p>They have neither need nor necessity of the friendship of others,<br> Unto whom my God is beneficently and graciously inclined.</p>  
 <p>Wherefore then the occasion that I should seek Him elsewhere,<br> Since, in mine own dwelling, my God is ever at my side?</p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>! He is neither liable to change, nor to mutation—<br> My God is unchangeable and immutable, for ever and ever!</p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
 <p>My weeping for the beloved hath passed beyond all computation;<br> Yet the dear one is in no way affected at the sight of my tears.</p>  
 <p>Though every one of my words should be pearls of great price,<br> Still she doth not account them at all worthy of her ears.</p>  
 <p>Were she overcome by sleep, I would arouse her by my cries;<br> But though fully awake, my loved one is asleep unto me.</p>  
 <p>Like unto a writing, I speak, though with mouth covered;<br> But my silence surpasseth my wails and my lamentations?</p>  
 <p>When is there security for the crop of love in scorching ground!<br> It requireth a salamander to exist in this desert of mine.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>This is not my love that separation hath parted from me:<br> ’Tis my soul, which hath become separated from this body of mine.</p>  
 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, desire naught else than the beloved of my heart,<br> Should my prayer be accepted at the threshold of the Almighty.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
 <p>There is no return for thee, a second time, unto this world!<br> To-day is thy opportunity, whether thou followest evil or good!</p>  
 <p>Every thing for which the opportunity is gone, is the phœnix of our desires;<br> But the immortal bird hath never been caught in any one's net.</p>  
 <p>The stream, that hath left the sluice, floweth not back again!<br> The hour, which hath passed away, returneth to us no more!</p>  
 <p>For time is, alas! like unto the dead in the sepulchre's niche;<br> And no one hath brought, by weeping, the dead to life again.</p>  
 <p>If thou hast any object to attain, be quick, for time is short:<br> Flatter not thyself on the permanency of this brief existence!</p>  
 <p>Each target, of which, in thy heart, thou considerest thyself sure,<br> Through pride and vanity, thou wilt surely miss thine aim of.</p>  
 <p>Over-sanguine hope hath rendered many desponding:<br> Be not off thy guard as to the deceit and fraud of time!</p>  
 <p>When thy mouth becometh shattered by the stroke of death,<br> In what manner wilt thou then offer praises with it?</p>  
 <p>The bereaved woman, who giveth utterance to her bewailings,<br> Lamenteth over thee, if thou understandest what she says.</p>  
 <p>Thou art not a child, that one should teach thee by force:<br> Thou art wise and intelligent, and arrived at maturity's years.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p>Exercise, then, thine own understanding as to good and evil,<br> Whether thy well-being lieth in this, or in that.</p>  
 <p>Conceal thy face beneath thy mantle, and open thine eyes:<br> Fly not far away on the winds of vanity and ambition!</p>  
 <p>Soar not unto the heavens with thy head in the air,<br> For thou art, originally, from the dust of the earth created.</p>  
 <p>At the last day, inquiry will not be made of thee,<br> As to whether thou art the son or grandson of such an one.</p>  
 <p>To the bride, who may not be handsome in her own person,<br> What signify her mother's or her grandmother's good looks?</p>  
 <p>Practise goodness in thine own person, and fear evil!<br> Presume not on the virtues of thy father or thy mother!</p>  
 <p>These precepts, O my friend! I urge upon myself:<br> Be not then grieved that I have made use of thy name.</p>  
 <p>I use thine and those of others, but speak to myself alone:<br> With any one else, I have neither motive nor concern.</p>  
 <p>Whatever I utter, I address the whole unto myself:<br> All these failings and defects are only mine own.</p>  
 <p>Had I a place for these sorrows within my own breast,<br> Why should I give utterance unto these declamations?</p>  
 <p>Since the racking pains of mortality are before thee,<br> Why dost thou not die, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>! before they come?</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
 <p>No one hath proved any of the world's faithfulness or sincerity;<br> And none, but the faithless and perfidious, have any affection for it.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>They who may lay any claim unto it, as belonging to them,<br> Speak wholly under delusion; for the world is no one's own.</p>  
 <p>Fortune is like unto a potter—it fashioneth and breaketh:<br> Many, like unto me and thee, it hath created and destroyed.</p>  
 <p>Every stone and clod of the world, that may be looked upon,<br> Are all sculls; some those of kings, and some of beggars.</p>  
 <p>It behoveth not that one should place a snare in the world's path;<br> For the capture of the griffin and the phœnix cannot be effected.</p>  
 <p>Who can place any dependence upon this fleeting breath?<br> It is impossible to confine the wind with the strongest chain!</p>  
 <p>Whether the sun or the moon, the upshot is extinction:<br> Doth the flower always bloom? Nothing can exist for ever!</p>  
 <p>Walk not, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>! contrary to the ways of the enlightened;<br> Since the love of the world is not approved of by any wise man.</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
 <p>If one seek a charmer in the world, this is the one:<br> This is the dear one, who is the ornament of the universe.</p>  
 <p>There will hot be such another lover in it as myself;<br> Nor will ever such a beloved one be created like thee.</p>  
 <p>I had shown patience under thy harshness and cruelty;<br> But, in the place of lamentation, joy and gladness cannot be.</p>  
 <p>I will never consent to be separated from thee,<br> So long as my soul is not separated from this body of mine.</p>  
 <p>Like unto the congregation behind, with the priest before,<br> In such wise have I imitated and followed thee.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>I am not the only one—the whole world loveth thee!<br> Whether it be the beggar, or the sovereign of the age.</p>  
 <p>Would that thou wouldst grant me a deed of protection,<br> Since thou puttest me off with the promise of to-morrow!</p>  
 <p>’Tis not that of mine own accord I am smitten with thee:<br> ’Twas a voice from thy direction that reached me.</p>  
 <p>Indeed, from all eternity, I am devoted unto thee—.<br> It is not that to-day only, I have a beginning made.</p>  
 <p>When with the sword of thy love it shall be severed,<br> Then will the neck of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span> have its duty performed.</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
 <p>The godly are the light and the refulgence of the world:<br> The pious are the guides and the directors of mankind.</p>  
 <p>If any one seek the way unto God and his Prophet,<br> The devout are the guides to point out the path.</p>  
 <p>The alchemist, that searcheth about for the philosopher's stone,<br> Will find it the bosom companion of the sanctified.</p>  
 <p>In the society of the enlightened, he will turn to red gold,<br> Though a person may be as a stone or a clod of the desert.</p>  
 <p>The ignorant are, as it were, like unto the dead:<br> Verily, the wise are like unto the saints themselves.</p>  
 <p>The enlightened are, comparatively, like unto the Messiah;<br> Since, from their breath, the dead return to life again.</p>  
 <p>He who may not possess some portion of wisdom<br> Is not a man: he is, as it were, but an empty model.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, am the servant of every enlightened being,<br> Whether he be of the highest, the middle, or the lowest degree.</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
 <p>Come, do not be the source of trouble unto any one;<br> For this short life of thine will soon be lost, O faithless one!</p>  
 <p>No one is to be a tarrier behind, in this world:<br> All are to be departers, either to-day or to-morrow.</p>  
 <p>Those dear friends, who to-day bloom before thee,<br> Will, in two or three short days, fade and decay.</p>  
 <p>If the sight of any be pleasing to thee, cherish them:<br> After they wither and die, when will they again revive?</p>  
 <p>The leaves of autumn, that fall from the branch,<br> By no contrivance can the sage attach them again.</p>  
 <p>When the rain-drops fall from the sky upon the earth,<br> They cannot again ascend unto the heavens whence they came.</p>  
 <p>Imagine not, that those tears which the eye sheddeth,<br> Shall e’er again return to the eyes they flowed from.</p>  
 <p>This is a different sun that riseth every morn:<br> The sun, that setteth once, riseth not again.</p>  
 <p>Though paradise is not gained by devotion, without grace;<br> Still, every man his neck from the debt must release. <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Shouldst thou incur a hundred toils for the flesh's sake,<br> Not one shall be of any avail to-morrow unto thee.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>Shouldst thou gorge thy stomach with the world itself,<br> Thou wilt not be remembered, either in blessings or in prayers.</p>  
 <p>Shouldst thou give but a grain of corn unto the hungered,<br> Verily, it will be hereafter thy provision in eternity.</p>  
 <p>Shouldst thou bestow but a drop of water on the thirsty,<br> It will become an ocean between thee and the fire of hell.</p>  
 <p>Shouldst thou once bow thy head in the road of the Almighty,<br> Thou shalt, at the last day, be more exalted than any.</p>  
 <p>This world, then, is the mart, if one be inclined to traffic;<br> But in that world there is neither barter nor gain.</p>  
 <p>If friends comprehend aught, to-day is their time,<br> That one friend may show self-devotion to another.</p>  
 <p>If there is any real existence here, of a truth ’tis this,<br> That in some one's society it should in happiness pass.</p>  
 <p>May God protect us from such a state of existence,<br> Where thou mayst speak ill of others, and others of thee.</p>  
 <p>Poison even, is pleasant, if it be in peace and in concord;<br> But not sugar, combined with sedition and with strife.</p>  
 <p>The belly, filled with rubbish, is well, if free from sorrow;<br> But not so, though gorged with confection of the dregs of woe.</p>  
 <p>The back, bent from toil, is indeed estimable;<br> But not from a purse of ill-gotten money round the waist. <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>A blind man, who seeth nothing, is truly excellent;<br> Better than that he should set eyes on another man's wife.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>A dumb person is far better without palate or tongue,<br> Than that his tongue should become the utterer of evil words.</p>  
 <p>A deaf man, who cannot hear, is preferable by far,<br> Than that his ears should be open to scandalous tales.</p>  
 <p>Demon or devil, that may come upon one, is agreeable;<br> But let not the Almighty a bad man before thee bring!</p>  
 <p>Than to bear the society of a fool, it is more preferable<br> That a fiery dragon should become one's bosom friend.</p>  
 <p>If there be a real difficulty, it is the healing of hearts;<br> But the profit and loss of the world are trifling affairs.</p>  
 <p>Its advantages, or its detriments, are trivial matters—<br> God forbid that any one become infamous for despicable things!</p>  
 <p>Forbid that any such desire of thine be accomplished,<br> Whereby the heart of thy brother or relation be grieved!</p>  
 <p>Should one eat delicious food, and another be eyeing it,<br> Such is not victuals, it is mere poison, so to speak.</p>  
 <p>It behoveth at times to respect other's wishes, at times thine own;<br> But thine own good pleasure is not to be regarded always.</p>  
 <p>The wise concern not themselves in such matters,<br> In which there's constant grief, and not an hour's pleasure.</p>  
 <p>It is incumbent on judges to administer justice;<br> But not to give their ears unto venal things.</p>  
 <p>Thoughts and ideas of all sorts enter into man's mind;<br> But it is not meet to account them all right and just.</p>  
 <p>The devout should have a constant eye towards their faith;<br> For some thoughts are virtues, whilst others are sins.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>God forbid that iniquity proceed from any one's hands!<br> What affinity is there between sin and innocence—evil and good?</p>  
 <p>It is not that all men are equally on a parity together;<br> For some are eminent, some indifferent, some vile and base.</p>  
 <p>The dignity of every one lieth within its own degree:<br> It idiot meet that the groom should the noble's rank acquire.</p>  
 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, neither thank, nor complain of any one;<br> For I have no other friend or enemy but myself.</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
 <p>He hath obtained happiness and felicity in this world,<br> Who in it hath acquired contentment and peace.</p>  
 <p>The dominion of Solomon, for a thousand years,<br> Equaleth not an hour's devotion, in this world.</p>  
 <p>One breath, in remembrance of the Deity, is more inestimable<br> Than the whole wealth of the universe, in this world.</p>  
 <p>They have found advantage and emolument in it,<br> Who occupied themselves in piety, in this world.</p>  
 <p>If there be any blessing, truly, it is that of devotion:<br> Consider that there is no greater good, in this world.</p>  
 <p>If there be any toils and troubles, verily they are religion's:<br> No other labours and trials are of avail, in this world.</p>  
 <p>All, all is transitory, and perisheth, save the Almighty,<br> Whether it be pleasure, or whether it be beauty, in this world.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>Even the monarch, he goeth down unto the dust at last:<br> Then what is glory, and what is .fame, in this world? <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>There will be no greater blockhead therein, than he<br> Who seeketh for happiness or tranquillity, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Thou, who desirest in this life a short period of repose,<br> Say, hath any one yet obtained it, in this world?</p>  
 <p>Relentless fate will make it like unto the shifting sands, <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">†</font></a><br> Whoever buildeth up a structure, in this world.</p>  
 <p>It is not a whit less than the stumbling of the drunkard,<br> Man's brief stability and continuance, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Come near the running stream—here behold life!<br> There are many such like emblems, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Every one that approacheth the graveyard of the dead,<br> Should consider it a sufficient admonition, in this world.</p>  
 <p>These massive courts, these firm and compact mansions,<br> Will certainly at last be desolate, in this world.</p>  
 <p>The insatiable eyes of destiny, indeed, are not such<br> That they suffer any one to be in safety, in this world.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p>Whatever cometh into it, departeth from it again:<br> All creatures are merely travellers, in this world.</p>  
 <p>When the judgment cometh, austerities cannot be practised:<br> He is the man, who hath mortified the flesh, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Since to-morrow he will rise again with the same qualities,<br> Let not God give any one an evil nature, in this world!</p>  
 <p>That will, verily, be unto him a harvest after death,<br> Whatever he may have sown in the field of this world.</p>  
 <p>Although that world cannot be seen here below;<br> Yet I can perceive its signs and its omens, in this world. <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>There will be no reciprocity of viaticum in the last day;<br> For I have myself beheld doomsday, in this world.</p>  
 <p>They will go down into the tomb as a deposit also,<br> Whoever may exist as a deposit, in this world. <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">†</font></a></p>  
 <p>Virtue is present bliss; but propitious fortune is necessary,<br> That one may acquire felicity, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Good habits, virtuous actions, and a noble disposition,<br> Are paradise and happiness, too, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Contrariety and opposition plunge a man's life in torment:<br> Such antagonism is of no avail, in this world.</p>  
 <p>The hand to the forehead, and on the breast, <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">‡</font></a> to every one:<br> This, indeed, is greatness and distinction, in this world.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>If exalted rank be of advantage unto any one,<br> A high place is justice and equity, in this world.</p>  
 <p>No other regrets can be taken out of it by us,<br> Save those of affection and kindness, in this world.</p>  
 <p>The whole of that world's traffic is carried on in this,<br> If one desire to follow commerce, in this world.</p>  
 <p>If man's good fortune may not have become inverted,<br> The truth is by no means hidden from him, in this world.</p>  
 <p>It behoveth that good be rendered for good, evil for evil,<br> If any one seek after holiness, in this world.</p>  
 <p>The Almighty hath bestowed sanctity upon them,<br> Who have shown stedfastness and constancy, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Should all created beings combine in union together,<br> They will not be able to change their lot, in this world.</p>  
 <p>If any one here below can be called a man, verily ’tis he<br> Who may have neither need nor necessity, in this world.</p>  
 <p>Since solicitude on its account is the cause of all sin,<br> How can people show such a hankering, for this world?</p>  
 <p>Over <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, indeed, this life hath passed away,<br> Even as a short hour glideth away, in this world.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
 <p>Consider not the wise of this world shrewd and sagacious;<br> For foolish and silly are all the wise ones of this world.</p>  
 <p>The light of wisdom is prohibited unto those hearts,<br> On which may rest the dirt and dust of this world.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>What one of the world saith, is all nonsense and absurdity:<br> Emptiness and folly are every word and speech of this world.</p>  
 <p>They merely play and gambol, after the manner of infants,<br> Who occupy themselves with the affairs of this world.</p>  
 <p>Like unto babies, with their mouths filled with milk,<br> Are all the subtle and the experienced of this world.</p>  
 <p>He will ever continue to be a dolt and an idiot,<br> Who may be drunk from the intoxication of this world.</p>  
 <p>In truth, the toper's inebriation will not be so great<br> As will be that of the drunken with the wine of this world.</p>  
 <p>There is a medicine in the world for every sick person;<br> But, alas! there is no physic for the sick of this world.</p>  
 <p>The cure of every one that hath been burned can be effected;<br> But not that of the scorched from the fiery sparks of this world.</p>  
 <p>Whatever thou throwest into the fire consumeth away;<br> And satiated will never become the seeker of this world:</p>  
 <p>He will ever be as a captive, sunk in distress and sorrow;<br> Then God forbid one should become the slave of this world!</p>  
 <p>He will be for ever immersed in lurid gloom and darkness,<br> Whoever may be the captive of the infidel of this world.</p>  
 <p>Whether it be adoration unto the idol, or unto the world,<br> Still, idolators all, are the worshippers of this world.</p>  
 <p>He is the true Muslim amongst the whole of the Faithful,<br> Who hath burst asunder the Hindū cord <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">*</font></a> of this world.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>Headless behind, his body remaineth, but the head will go;<br> How, then, is the possessor of a head, a head-man of this world? <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>They make their sons and daughters orphans, and desert them—<br> All are unnatural—the fathers and the mothers of this world.</p>  
 <p>There will be a load of misery for ever upon his head,<br> Round which may be wrapped the turban of this world.</p>  
 <p>All is affliction; whether it be bought, or whether it be sold;<br> For there is nought else whatever in the bāzār of this world.</p>  
 <p>They cheat and impose—the whole fraternity are knaves—<br> All the buyers, and all the sellers of this world.</p>  
 <p>They will never show the least affection towards it,<br> Who may be acquainted with the secrets of this world.</p>  
 <p>He whose regard may be directed to religion and piety,<br> Fostereth not any hopes or expectations of this world.</p>  
 <p>He who quaileth at the sight of a precipice or an abyss,<br> Will never travel upon the dangerous path of this world.</p>  
 <p>The whole of its friends and associates are impostors—<br> What dependence can be placed on the deceivers of this world?</p>  
 <p>Its old and its young, alike, are all rivals of each other—<br> Where is the true friend in the region of this world?</p>  
 <p>Whatever may be created, the whole shall fade and perish—<br> Draw near! behold the raids and ravages of this world!</p>  
 <p>Unto whom it cometh, from him it again departeth;<br> For I have well observed the gait and movements of this world.</p>

 <p>One hour it may be spring—in another, autumn will come;<br> For no permanence whatever, hath the spring of this world.</p>  
 <p>Though thousands of props should be placed to support it,<br> Without foundation, notwithstanding, is the wall of this world.</p>  
 <p>Though thou shouldst raise round thyself a fortress of iron,<br> Still consider but as glass all the bulwarks of this world.</p>  
 <p>In the same manner as the sun's shadow shifteth,<br> So likewise there is nowhere permanence in this world.</p>  
 <p>Entertain thou no hope of pre-eminence by its means;<br> For incessant and perpetual is the littleness of this world.</p>  
 <p>Without shears they sever the thread of man's existence,<br> Both the nights and the days of this world.</p>  
 <p>After death, an account will be required of every man,<br> As to the number and magnitude of the sins of this world.</p>  
 <p>They will be but a mere handful of dust at the last day,<br> The rosy-cheeked and the rosy-bodied of this world.</p>

 <p>Since thou passest thy days in jollity, and thy nights in slumber,<br> When, O unfortunate! wilt thou bring the Almighty to mind?</p>  
 <p>Thy departure, if thou art aware, will be extremely precipitate—<br> Be not, then, unmindful of the exceeding shortness of life!</p>  
 <p>Thy breath and thy footsteps here are all, all computed;<br> Therefore step not on this path inconsiderately and in error.</p>  
 <p>In the book, the Almighty hath sent a statement of the account:<br> See, then, thou make thyself with both account and book acquainted.</p>  
 <p>I am fully aware that, originally, thou art of the earth;<br> Why then, with thy finger, removest thou the dust from thy person?</p>  
 <p>Not until thy thirst for this world shall have become quenched,<br> Shalt thou, at the judgment, become satiated with the water of life.</p>

 <p>Under the pretext of tobacco, I exhale the smoke of my sighs;<br> For I burn and emit smoke for ever, in the fire of thy face.</p>  
 <p>All other folks whatever occupy themselves in the world's affairs;<br> But I am sunk in expectation of beholding thy face.</p>

 <p>Just as the lightning, that showeth itself and is no more;<br> So swift, without doubt, is the swift course of life.</p>  
 <p>It is violent and impetuous to such a degree,<br> That no one is able to command the bridle of life.</p>  
 <p>Since its swift steed hath neither curb nor rein,<br> The brave cavalier of life must have a fall at last.</p>  
 <p>In a single hour it severeth the friendships of years—<br> In such wise, unfaithful is the friend of life.</p>  
 <p>I will neither leave my house, nor will I travel;<br> For, without going a journey, I pass over the road of life.</p>  
 <p>It will, in the end, be severed by the shears of fate—<br> It will not remain for ever connected—this thread of life.</p>

 <p>At times the body burneth from heat; sometimes, it trembleth from the cold:<br> At others, it dieth from thirst and hunger; at others, from excess of food.</p>  
 <p>All, all who have come into the world, are in tumult and in uproar:<br> Neither is that hungry one at peace, nor that cloyed one in tranquillity.</p>  
 <p>At times, they raise the hand to the head, and act civilly to each other;<br> Sometimes they stretch out the hand to the dagger and the sword.</p>  
 <p>When the angels mixed the dust of the first Adam together,<br> They combined, along with it, all manner of pains and woe.</p>  
 <p>What matters it, though this very hour one be beaten or be bound?<br> His time, too, will come likewise, to strike and to pinion others.</p>  
 <p>For how long will this crazy foundation of our's continue firm?<br> With plastering and propping it so continually I am quite worn out.</p>

 <p>’Tis possible, perhaps, that after death one may laugh in the tomb,<br> Who may, in this life, have mourned and lamented over himself.</p>  
 <p>I perceive all are departers—there are none to be tarriers behind:<br> Travelling upon this road is necessary, alike, for young and for old.</p>  
 <p>It is the flowing ringlets of the beloved that every one seeketh after,<br> Whether it be the young or old, the great or small, the rich or poor.</p>  
 <p>Supremely happy is he who hath been accepted at her threshold;<br> But woe and misery for him who hath been driven from it.</p>  
 <p>Like unto me, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, hundreds were her nightingales;<br> But which that dark-eyed one hath chosen, God only knoweth!</p>  <h4 align="center">XVIII.</h4>  
 <p>When the black eye-lashes become submerged in the heart's moisture,<br> Then both property and effects become engulfed in the ocean of the heart.</p>  
 <p>Thou speakest vainly of the heart's disquiet unto the "Father of Desire:" <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> What know children of the deep, deep sorrows of the heart?</p>  
 <p>Unto every other countenance than that of my own beloved,<br> I have permanently closed, altogether, the eyes of the heart.</p>  
 <p>That the highest canopy of heaven is beneath its shadow,<br> In the same degree, the more supernal is the banner of the heart.</p>  
 <p>This sanctuary is more sacred than Abraham's tabernacle,<br> If one would restore the desolated sanctuary of the heart.</p>

 <p>Though others should set itself, feet upon the earth's surface,<br> I have on the empyrean itself, placed the foot of the heart.</p>  
 <p>That spot, which lieth midway ’twixt the firmament and world,<br> Is a place of seclusion—’tis the very staircase of the heart.</p>  
 <p>From whom, then, shall I crave it, save from thee my God,<br> Since the world's physicians cannot prepare the salve of the heart?</p>  
 <p>There are, indeed, very many extrinsic friends in the world;<br> But <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span> nowhere findeth, a single friend of the heart.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIX.</h4>  
 <p>I am ever sitting, with heart dried up, in the moisture of my tears:<br> Love showed unto me, in my own retreat, both ocean and land.</p>  
 <p>Like as when, with my lips, I kissed the wound of thy sword,<br> I have never since, from any salve, such soothing experienced.</p>  
 <p>Majnūn, that laid his head at the feet of Laylā, his beloved, <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> Became exalted in Arabia, and in all foreign lands.</p>  
 <p>The powerful will always be triumphant over the weak;<br> And I am preserved from other misery by my grief for thee.</p>  
 <p>Like unto myself, for thee, thus in wretchedness o’erwhelmed,<br> Of the whole race of Adam there will be no other similar.</p>  
 <p>Like as a carcass, that may be fallen amongst the living,<br> In such wise am I, whilst in it, separated from the world.</p>  
 <p>From the breathings of the charmers I obtain no alleviation;<br> For this reason, indeed, that my breath is dependent on thine.</p>

 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, withdrawn from the world, was happy indeed;<br> But looking towards thee, hath brought man's censure on me.</p>  <h4 align="center">XX.</h4>  
 <p>The fair face turneth like unto a smoky pot in old age:<br> The upright-statured becometh like a bent stick, in old age.</p>  
 <p>Like unto the candle in the morning, or the sun in winter,<br> One turneth pale, and wanteth warmth, in the time of old age.</p>  
 <p>If a person place his foot in one direction, he goeth in another;<br> The whole body becometh quite a stranger to us, in old age.</p>  
 <p>One's limbs are laid out, as if accounted among the dead,<br> Although he is still palpably beheld alive, in old age.</p>

 <p>A defunct is much better off, for after death he liveth again;<br> But it is not so that one may again grow young, in old age.</p>  
 <p>If he take any thing, it disagreeth with him, like poison;<br> For one cannot eat, nor can one drink, in old age.</p>  
 <p>That is youth, in which one both heareth and seeth something;<br> But nothing can be heard, and nothing seen, in old age.</p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>! verily, old age is such utter helplessness,<br> That, were it Rustam <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">*</font></a> himself, he deserveth pity, in old age.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXI.</h4>

 <p>Neither can the wolf be instructed in the art of humanity,<br> Nor can any reliance be placed on the forbearance of fate.</p>  
 <p>Fortune revolveth equally with Islām and with idolatry—<br> When doth the blind make distinction ’twixt white and black?</p>  
 <p>With mine own eyes have I viewed the portents of destiny:<br> It createth thousands every moment, and destroyeth them too.</p>  
 <p>I am unable to place any such trust in fate's revolutions,<br> As that when its time cometh, it will grant exemption to me.</p>  
 <p>No one, indeed, will have experienced in his whole lifetime,<br> Such severity as the beloved-one, hourly, wreaketh upon me.</p>

 <p>If I stretch forth my hand unto gold, it turneth into dust:<br> If I manifest desire for dust, it treateth me with scorn.</p>  
 <p>Separation from God is a great calamity, unbearable to me:<br> My distressed heart ever yearneth for society with Him.</p>  
 <p>When hath any lover acquired such an amount of patience,<br> That he putteth off, until to-morrow, the promise of to-day?</p>  
 <p>O heart ravisher! if thou shouldst even clothe me in fire,<br> In my sight, the garment will become me like gold brocade.</p>  
 <p>If, with regard to my love, any one should speak evil of me,<br> To myself I consider, that he is uttering my praise.</p>  
 <p>’Tis right that reproaches be heaped on the lover, the rule is such:<br> It is ever the custom of the healthy to laugh at the sick.</p>  
 <p>Honour and love are widely separated from each other—<br> How can one perpetrate a robbery in the light of day?</p>

 <p>They then remove him for the ablution, <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> And place him naked on the stretcher.</p>  
 <p>Then of his garments, become covetous,<br> The washers and the bathers of the dead,</p>  
 <p>On the return home from the grave,<br> The heirs share, and carry the effects away.</p>  
 <p>Both his friends, and his enemies, alike,<br> To his throne and country lay claim.</p>  
 <p>His handmaidens and concubines, they<br> Are carried off by the dead man's compeers.</p>  
 <p>Both name and vestige of him are lost,<br> As if, indeed, he had never existed.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>Not even a record of him remaineth;<br> Not even his title, to future times.</p>  
 <p>The world, verily, is like a running stream,<br> Upon which no impression can remain.</p>  
 <p>Though one may people a thousand spots,<br> Still, all, at last, must desolate become!</p>  
 <p>Like as the wind cometh and passeth by,<br> So rolleth away the course of time!</p>  
 <p>This exposition was long and lengthy,<br> But <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span> hath condensed and abridged it.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXVI.</h4>  
 <p>My black eyes have turned white, from the weeping of separation;<br> And again, have become coloured, from the blood of the heart.</p>  
 <p>I was wont to say, "Even yet, I will go and visit my friends;"<br> For I did not know that the time of their departure was fixed.</p>  
 <p>Some, like unto the moth, cast themselves into the fire:<br> Some, alive, like the nightingale, the glowing rose upon.</p>  
 <p>The abjectness of death hath come before the dead;<br> And the living become woe-begone, though yet in existence.</p>  
 <p>The soldiers of destiny have so put forth their hands to plunder,<br> That a thousand <u>Kh</u>asraus and <u>Sh</u>īrīns <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">*</font></a> have been trampled to dust.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>They who, in their gaiety, placed their feet upon the heavens—<br> Such tenderly nourished ones have now sunk into the grave.</p>  
 <p>They who were wont to repose upon ermine and velvets,<br> Without bed and without pillow now in the cold earth lie.</p>  
 <p>Why, then, should not the heart of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span> be sorrowful,<br> When such numbers of his friends have been severed from him?</p>  <h4 align="center">XXVII.</h4>  
 <p>Whomsoever one's own affections have made abject, contemptible, account not;<br> For love is sympathy's clouds: as mere clouds of dust, account them not.</p>  
 <p>At times, the curls become dark spikenards; at others, amber and musk:<br> Although they are like unto snakes, as such, account them not.</p>  
 <p>One of its phases is destruction, whilst another is reconstruction:<br> Indeed, love, radically, is fire; but as such, account it not.</p>  
 <p>Many awake, are fast asleep, like the statue, with eyes open:<br> Though it regard thee with staring eyes, awake, account it not.</p>  
 <p>The object to be conveyed by the faces of the fair, is a certain emotion:<br> That which produceth not such impression, a face, account it not.</p>  
 <p>The thorn, which is along with the rose, is among roses reckoned:<br> What matter though ’tis termed a thorn? as such, account it not.</p>  
 <p>The wise are those, who confess themselves wanting in wisdom—<br> They who account themselves sage, as such, account them not.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>He, indeed, is sinful, unto whom his own sins are not evident:<br> Whoever considereth himself evil, as such, account him not.</p>  
 <p>He, who hath confessed the power of his beloved one's dark locks,<br> Will be disturbed for ever; then tranquil, account him not.</p>  
 <p>Let him, who seeketh perfection, practise the lowliness of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>:<br> That is the expedient: any other plan, successful, account it not.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXVIII.</h4>  
 <p>Would to heaven that I were the dust and ashes at thy door!<br> Would that thy foot were, for ever, placed upon my head!</p>  
 <p>By all means, let thee and me meet face to face;<br> Then let my breast be the target for thine arrows!</p>  
 <p>Let my whole body, like antimony, be ground to powder; <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> For then, at least, one glance of thy dark eyes will be mine.</p>  
 <p>Were the society of the fair dependent on gold or silver,<br> I had acquired it, by my sallowness, and my silvery tears.</p>  
 <p>Wherefore, indeed, had reproaches been uttered against me,<br> If any one had been aware of thy heart-ravishing ways?</p>  
 <p>Should I tell them of the dignity thy love hath brought me,<br> The angels, all, would cry, "O that we were human too!"</p>  
 <p>If I were the heart-ravisher, and thou, like me, the heart-ravished,<br> The spectacle of my condition would then be manifest to thee.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>It will not be equal unto the bloody torrent from mine eyes,<br> Though one's face, all over, might sharp sword-gashes bear.</p>  
 <p>O that I were the nightingale, or the zephyr of the morn,<br> That my path might lie amongst thy fragrant bowers!</p>  
 <p>’Midst the agonies endured for thee, to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, the physician saith—<br> "Thou wouldst be better were thy state even worse than it is."</p>  <h4 align="center">XXIX.</h4>  
 <p>If this, thy heart's affection, be bestowed upon a rival,<br> For thy sake, this rival shall be my friend also.</p>  
 <p>He who may be fascinated with one fair countenance,<br> From that one, a thousand other faces will be acceptable to him. <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Whosoever may have entered into the service of kings,<br> Must, necessarily, be under obligation unto the janitor.</p>  
 <p>Against thy malicious guardians, how shall I complain?<br> It is usual for the thorns to be associated with the rose.</p>  
 <p>Until a hundred thorns shall have pierced his breast,<br> How shall the nightingale unto the rose ever gain access?</p>  
 <p>He will spread the prayer-carpet in the cupbearer's path—<br> Every Ṣūfi who may be, towards his countenance, prepossessed.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p>He will lose his senses, entirely, through the phrenzy of love,<br> Though he may be as wise, indeed, as Iflātūn <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">*</font></a> himself.</p>  
 <p>He will, in no wise, cast censures upon <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>,<br> Whoever may be cognizant of thy beauty and grace.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXX.</h4>  
 <p>Though they may have been a hundred times by each other's side, and in each other's arms;<br> Still, all the loving-ones of this world will be separated from each other.</p>  
 <p>They, who, at present, are dwelling together in the same abode;<br> At the last, will all have separate dwelling places.</p>  
 <p>These fragrant flowers, whose proper place is in the turban,<br> All, all of them will fade away, and be trodden under foot.</p>  
 <p>These fair-faced ones, with bright countenances like the sun's—<br> The black hair, like a forest, will overspread their cheeks.</p>  
 <p>This delicious sherbet, which is the society of our friends,<br> Will, in separation, and in absence, to deadly poison turn.</p>  
 <p>Through disjunction from a friend, I myself have witnessed,<br> The wisest of the age become, wholly, of reason bereft.</p>  
 <p>He setteth not his foot, for dread, on the ground of society,<br> Who is, already, cognizant of the dread slough of separation.</p>  
 <p>In what manner shall one devise a fit remedy for this,<br> Unto which, neither human wisdom, nor conjecture reach?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>To such a degree hath anguish rusted <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān's</span> heart;<br> But the goblet of pure wine will its furbisher become.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXXI.</h4>  
 <p>The face of the beloved, the sun, and the moon, are all three one:<br> Her stature, the cypress, and the pine, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>I have not the least need, either of honey, or of sugar;<br> For, the lips of the beloved, honey, and sugar, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>When I am reclining upon my couch, without her by my side,<br> Fire, thorns, and this couch of mine, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>When I cast mine eyes toward her dwelling's door and walls,<br> A garden, a parterre of flowers, and they, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>When I am soiled with any dust of the alley she dwelleth in,<br> This dust, and musk, and amber, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>O God! make no one acquainted with absence from his love;<br> For invasion, massacre, and such absence, are all three one!</p>  
 <p>The very moment that man biddeth adieu unto the world,<br> Dust, and silver, and gold, unto him, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>Should the monk, in reality, follow a life of austerity,<br> The sovereign, the chief, and the monk, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>It is not right that one should roam in foreign lands;<br> Therein, he who can see, the blind, and dumb, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>That town, in which there may be neither sweetheart nor friend,<br> That town, the ocean, and the desert, are all three one.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p>At the shops of the sightless dealers in jewels,<br> The kaurī, <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">*</font></a> the ruby, and the pearl, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>Let not these saintly monitors hold my love in scorn;<br> For the true lover, the saint, and the father, are all three one.</p>  
 <p>Through the despotic severity of tyrannical rulers,<br> The grave, and fire, and Pe<u>sh</u>our, <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">†</font></a> are all three one.</p>  
 <p>What matter, though he may praise himself unto <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>?<br> Still, the fool, the ox, and the ass, are all three one.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXXII.</h4>  
 <p>Thy fair face, and thy musky mole, are associated together,<br> Or Maḥmūd and Ayāz are sitting together, bosom friends. <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">‡</font></a></p>  
 <p>What matter, though thy countenance is hidden by thy curls?<br> The water of immortality itself is, in total darkness, concealed.</p>  
 <p>From thy curls, thy ruby lips, and thy face, are produced<br> The night, the glow of sunset, and the dawn of day.</p>  
 <p>Is it the teeth, in thy sweet mouth, that shine so lustrously,<br> Or are there glittering dewdrops in the bud of the rose?</p>  
 <p>’Tis not that my heart, alone, is pierced by thy glances:<br> The knife and the flesh, of old, are hostile to each other.</p>  
 <p>Without floods of tears, the dark eye deigneth not to look on one:<br> The opening of the narcissus dependeth on the rivulet's humidity.</p>  
 <p>Peace, without trouble and affliction, no one hath acquired;<br> But thy cruelty, and thy constancy, are blessings unto me.</p>

 <p>Through the good fortune attendant on the meed of thy beauty,<br> Throughout the world resoundeth the fame of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān's</span> rhymes.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXXIII.</h4>  
 <p>If there be any essential duty in this world, verily ’tis that of religion;<br> And for the followers of this avocation, there is due meed of praise.</p>  
 <p>Unto whose lot have fallen the gifts of godliness and piety,<br> The shadow of felicity and happiness ever followeth after them.</p>  
 <p>Contentment hath so filled their palates with savour,<br> That, in their mouths, the dry crust is like honey unto.</p>  
 <p>Without elephants and camels, they wield the sceptre of royalty,<br> Though a small worn-out piece of mat is their only carpet.</p>  
 <p>When they, in their necessities, raise their hands in supplication,<br> The very angels of heaven say, Amen! to their requests.</p>  
 <p>They, who, in this life, accept indigence and privations,<br> Their advantage and good in that are infallible indeed.</p>  
 <p>The lowliness and humility of the meek are, in themselves, dignity:<br> Their hearts are clean, though their ragged garments be soiled.</p>  
 <p>The water of the higher ground floweth ever unto the lower—<br> The Almighty hath raised to perfection, the humble, and the meek.</p>  
 <p>The heads of the stubborn and scornful reach the heavens now;<br> But, after a few short days, their place is in the dust!</p>  
 <p>They, who follow the dictates of presumption and arrogance,<br> Deserve not mercy—they are abominable and accursed.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p>What, though their human forms may be termed men?<br> Men they are not, in reality—they are children of the devil.</p>  
 <p>Though <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span> possesseth none of this world's pelf,<br> Thank Heaven! neither presumptuous, nor self-conceited is he.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXXIV.</h4>  
 <p>There is a different scar branded upon every one's breast,<br> Whether he be the beggar, or the sovereign of the land. <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>There is no obtaining satiety from this fountain of the world;<br> And its thirsty-ones are, severally, in dissension and in strife.</p>  
 <p>A. little peace is obtained, only after much pain and trouble—<br> A mere straw of this world, without it, is unlawful and unmeet.</p>  
 <p>This life's joys are not attainable, without bitterness and woe—<br> From the miser's house, ever so little alms, is a misfortune.</p>  
 <p>Why then may not tranquillity be prohibited unto them,<br> Who have entered within the caravansary of this world?</p>  
 <p>As to the state of Majnūn, why should any one inquire?<br> The whole world, house by house, is Majnūn and Laylā too! <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">†</font></a></p>  
 <p>Love hath breathed upon the entire universe a spell, so potent,<br> That the lover, though keen-sighted, is to all things blind.</p>  
 <p>The Almighty hath accorded unto every one a different lot;<br> And every man's own portion is, separately, determined.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></a></p>  
 <p>Giving and taking—buying and selling—all are in others’ hands<br> There is, I perceive, no opening here, either for thee or for me.</p>  
 <p>All matters, if in accordance with the will of the master,<br> Though unlawful towards the bondsman, are legal and right.</p>  
 <p>Willing or unwilling—whether it be one's wish, or whether it be not—<br> The fulfilment of one's destiny, agreeable, or hateful, is inevitable.</p>  
 <p>Life and faith, it behoveth to intrust, entirely, unto Him,<br> Whose decrees have gone out upon every human being.</p>  
 <p>Into the hands of whomsoever the ruler hath delegated authority,<br> The whole world boweth unto his wishes and his views.</p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>! if the Most High should not be one's companion,<br> Though armies may be with him, he still is all alone!</p>  <h4 align="center">XXXV.</h4>  
 <p>That friend, who is false and faithless, is no friend at all!<br> The affair, which hath not stability, is no matter at all!</p>  
 <p>Though laying down one's head is difficult, for thee and for me;<br> Yet ’tis an easy matter in love, and difficult by no means.</p>  
 <p>Care and solicitude awaken a man from his slumbers;<br> And he who hath no anxiety, though awake, is fast asleep.</p>  
 <p>To the lover, if there is aught in life, ’tis the society of his beloved—<br> The life of separation cannot be reckoned as existence.</p>  
 <p>It increaseth and groweth less, in the twinkling of the eye—<br> Reliance on the revolutions of fortune is no reliance whatever.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>If one be the father of a hundred sons, what shall he do with them?<br> The ignorant, foolish son, is not the son of his father.</p>  
 <p>Unto their lovers, the beloved ones ever manifest their caprices;<br> But the beloved of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span> causeth him no disquietude.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXXVI.</h4>  
 <p>In the name of that Deity of mine, this is my meed of praise—<br> Him, of whose many appellations, one, "The Most Glorious" is.</p>  
 <p>Those things, which, unto all others, are insuperable,<br> The whole of these matters are easy, and feasible unto Him.</p>  
 <p>He is the sovereign over all the rulers of the earth:<br> Over the head of every monarch, He is also the King.</p>  
 <p>Is any one able to place a sun in the firmament?<br> Yet He, in the heavens, hath elevated this glorious orb.</p>  
 <p>Can any one spread out a veil over the disc of the sun?<br> But, see! He hath entirely concealed it, in the veil of clouds.</p>  
 <p>Who is there capable of producing a moon, to light the night?<br> He hath created many moons, to illumine the nocturnal gloom.</p>  
 <p>Can any one pour down a single rain-drop from the sky?<br> Yet He hath rained, upon us, the genial showers of spring.</p>  
 <p>Who is there-equal to give vitality, even to a mosquito<br> Yet He hath given life to the whole creation of the earth.</p>  
 <p>Hath any one the ability to give the red tinge to stone? .<br> But He hath coloured it with the Ar<u>gh</u>owān's <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">*</font></a> rich hue.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>Can any one cause a single flower to grow from out the earth<br> Yet He hath made to bloom gardens of sweetest flowers.</p>  
 <p>Hath any one the power to produce water from fire?<br> He, from the fire of summer, hath produced the winter rains.</p>  
 <p>Hath any one the ability to impart religion unto man?<br> Yet He, upon all His servants, hath faith and religion bestowed.</p>  
 <p>Can any one ascend from earth to Heaven?<br> Yet this potent power, He hath, unto Jesus Christ, assigned.</p>  
 <p>Who is there. that can hold converse with the Almighty<br> Yet, to this degree, He hath the patriarch Moses exalted.</p>  
 <p>Who is mighty enough to place a saddle on the steed of the wind?<br> Whilst He hath, high in air, the throne of Sulīmān set up. <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>What man, with snowy beard, can, unto the Last Day, live?<br> Yet, upon <u>Kh</u>izr, <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">†</font></a> this great favour hath He conferred.</p>  
 <p>Hath any one power to produce gems from out the rain-drops?<br> Whilst He, from out the rain-drops, hath produced pearls.</p>  
 <p>Who is there can supply food unto all creatures?<br> Yet He, unto all created things, is the giver of daily bread.</p>

 <p>That which He can perform, none else can accomplish:<br> All the most powerful are impotent, before His omnipotence.</p>  
 <p>He hath founded the house of stone in the midst of the waters,<br> In which He hath given, unto fire, security and protection. <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>The earth hath bowed down its head in His adoration;<br> And the firmament is bent over in the worship of Him.</p>  
 <p>Every tree, and every shrub, stand ready to bend before Him:<br> Every herb and blade of grass are a tongue to utter his praises.</p>  
 <p>Every fish in the deep praiseth and blesseth His name:<br> Every bird, in the meadows and in the fields, magnifieth Him.</p>  
 <p>All things are occupied in offering thanksgiving unto Him,<br> Whether mankind, or the genii, or the beasts of the field.</p>  
 <p>The created things themselves have not held Him in such estimation,<br> As the great love and regard they are held in by Him.</p>  
 <p>No one hath discovered the extent of His omniscience—<br> His knowledge and perception such a boundless ocean is.</p>  
 <p>Neither doth any one bear likeness or similitude unto Him,<br> Nor doth He bear likeness or similitude unto any one.</p>  
 <p>With Him, there is neither deficiency, detriment, nor decline:<br> He is, wholly, without defect, without decline, or deterioration.</p>  
 <p>He hath neither simile, nor similitude, nor hath He place:<br> He is without semblance, without comparison, without abode.</p>  
 <p>From all form, structure, or configuration, He is exempt;<br> Yet all figure, lineament, and formation, from Him proceed.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>No one beholdeth Him with his eyes, nor can He be looked upon;<br> And yet, ineffable and inscrutable, He is manifest to all.</p>  
 <p>If any one should say, He cannot be seen, verily, He cannot:<br> And should he so say, He is, in truth, apparent unto all.</p>  
 <p>Without doubt and without distrust, consider Him immaculate<br> In all things soever, of which people are hard of belief.</p>  
 <p>No one hath lauded Him equal unto His just deserts;<br> Neither hath any one-sufficiently resounded His praise.</p>  
 <p>Out of the thousands of His excellencies and His perfections,<br> Deem not, that one, by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raḥmān</span>, hath been adequately expressed.</p>
