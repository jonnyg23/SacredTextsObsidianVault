 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:634</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "A strong demon from the Jinns came to me yesterday 
 suddenly, so as to spoil my prayer, but Allah enabled me to overpower 
 him, and so I caught him and intended to tie him to one of the pillars
 of the Mosque so that all of you might see him, but I remembered the 
 invocation of my brother Solomon: 'And grant me a kingdom such as 
 shall not belong to any other after me.' (38.35) so I let him go 
 cursed."
