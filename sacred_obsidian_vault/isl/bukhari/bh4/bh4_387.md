 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:383</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abi Aufa:</i></p>
 We were afflicted with hunger during the besiege of Khaibar, and when 
 it was the day of (the battle of) Khaibar, we slaughtered the donkeys 
 and when the pots got boiling (with their meat). Allah's Apostle made 
 an announcement that all the pots should be upset and that nobody 
 should eat anything of the meat of the donkeys. We thought that the 
 Prophet prohibited that because the Khumus had not been taken out of 
 the booty (i.e. donkeys); other people said, "He prohibited eating 
 them for ever." The sub-narrator added, "I asked Said bin Jubair who 
 said, 'He has made the eating of donkeys' meat illegal for ever.")
