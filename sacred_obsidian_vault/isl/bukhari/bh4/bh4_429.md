 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:425</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 On the day of a solar eclipse, Allah's Apostle stood up (to offer the 
 eclipse prayer). He recited Takbir, recited a long recitation (of Holy
 Verses), bowed a long bowing, and then he raised h is head saying. 
 "Allah hears him who sends his praises to Him." Then he stayed 
 standing, recited a long recitation again, but shorter than the 
 former, bowed a long bowing, but shorter than the first, performed a 
 long prostration and then performed the second Rak'a in the same way 
 as he had done the first. By the time he had finished his prayer with 
 Taslim, the solar eclipse had been over. Then he addressed the people 
 referring to the solar and lunar eclipses saying, "These are two signs
 amongst the Signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of 
 anyone's death or life. So, if you see them, hasten for the Prayer."
