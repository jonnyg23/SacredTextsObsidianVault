 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:51</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "A place in Paradise as small as a bow is better 
 than all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world)." 
 He also said, "A single endeavor in Allah's Cause in the afternoon or 
 in the forenoon is better than all that on which the sun rises and 
 sets."
