 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:63</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara:</i></p>
 A man whose face was covered with an iron mask (i.e. clad in armor) 
 came to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Shall I fight or 
 embrace Islam first? "The Prophet said, "Embrace Islam first and then 
 fight." So he embraced Islam, and was martyred. Allah's Apostle said, 
 A Little work, but a great reward. "(He did very little (after 
 embracing Islam), but he will be rewarded in abundance)."
