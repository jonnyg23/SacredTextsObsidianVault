 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:461</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 that he heard the Prophet saying, "The Divine Inspiration was delayed 
 for a short period but suddenly, as I was walking. I heard a voice in 
 the sky, and when I looked up towards the sky, to my surprise, I saw 
 the angel who had come to me in the Hira Cave, and he was sitting on a
 chair in between the sky and the earth. I was so frightened by him 
 that I fell on the ground and came to my family and said (to them), 
 'Cover me! (with a blanket), cover me!' Then Allah sent the 
 Revelation: "O, You wrapped up (In a blanket)! (Arise and warn! And 
 your Lord magnify And keep pure your garments, And desert the idols." 
 (74.1-5)
