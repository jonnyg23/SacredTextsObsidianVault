 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:284</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Some Ansari men asked permission from Allah's Apostle saying, "O 
 Allah's Apostle! Allow us not to take the ransom of our nephew Al 
 Abbas. The Prophet replied, "Do not leave a single Dirham thereof."
 <p>
 (In another narration) Anas said, "Some wealth was brought to the 
 Prophet from Bahrain. Al Abbas came to him and said, 'O Allah's 
 Apostle! Give me (some of it), as I have paid my and 'Aqil's ransom.' 
 The Prophet said, 'Take,' and gave him in his garment."
