 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:447</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 I stuffed for the Prophet a pillow decorated with pictures (of 
 animals) which looked like a Namruqa (i.e. a small cushion). He came 
 and stood among the people with excitement apparent on his face. I 
 said, "O Allah's Apostle! What is wrong?" He said, "What is this 
 pillow?" I said, "I have prepared this pillow for you, so that you may
 recline on it." He said, "Don't you know that angels do not enter a 
 house wherein there are pictures; and whoever makes a picture will be 
 punished on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked to give life to 
 (what he has created)?"
