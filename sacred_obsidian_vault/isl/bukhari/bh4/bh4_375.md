 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:371</h3><p><i>Narrated Urwa bin Az-Zubair:</i></p>
 Hakim bin Hizam said, "I asked Allah's Apostle for something, and he 
 gave me. I asked him again, and he gave me, and said to me. 'O Hakim! 
 This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takes it 
 without greed, then one is blessed in it, and if one takes it with 
 greediness, then one is not blessed in it, and will be like the one 
 who eats without satisfaction. And an upper (i.e. giving) hand is 
 better than a lower (i.e. taking) hand,' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! 
 By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I will not ask anyone for 
 anything after you till I leave this world." So, when Abu Bakr during 
 his Caliphate, called Hakim to give him (some money), Hakim refused to
 accept anything from him. Once 'Umar called him (during his Caliphate)
 in order to give him something, but Hakim refused to accept it, 
 whereupon 'Umar said, "O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Haklm) his right 
 which Allah has assigned to him) from this Fai '(booty), but he 
 refuses to take it." So Haklm never took anything from anybody after 
 the Prophet till he died.
