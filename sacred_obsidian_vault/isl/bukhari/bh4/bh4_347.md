 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:343</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Al-Hanafiya:</i></p>
 If Ali had spoken anything bad about 'Uthman then he would have 
 mentioned the day when some persons came to him and complained about 
 the Zakat officials of 'Uthman. 'Ali then said to me, "Go to 'Uthman 
 and say to him, 'This document contains the regulations of spending 
 the Sadaqa of Allah's Apostle so order your Zakat officials to act 
 accordingly." I took the document to 'Uthman. 'Uthman said, "Take it 
 away, for we are not in need of it." I returned to 'Ali with it and 
 informed him of that. He said, "Put it whence you took it."
 <p>
 Hanafiya who said, "My father sent me saying, 'Take this letter to 
 'Uthman for it contains the orders of the Prophet concerning the 
 Sadaqa.' "
