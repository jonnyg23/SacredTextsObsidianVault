 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:355</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</i></p>
 A bedouin asked the Prophet, "A man may fight for the sake of booty, 
 and another may fight so that he may be mentioned by the people, and a
 third may fight to show his position (i.e. bravery); which of these 
 regarded as fighting in Allah's Cause?" The Prophet said, "He who 
 fights so that Allah's Word (i.e. Islam) should be superior, fights 
 for Allah's Cause."
