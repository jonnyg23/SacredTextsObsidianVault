 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:346</h3><p><i>Narrated Muawiya:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "If Allah wants to do good for somebody, he 
 makes him comprehend the Religion (i.e. Islam), and Allah is the Giver
 and I am Al-Qasim (i.e. the distributor), and this (Muslim) nation 
 will remain victorious over their opponents, till Allah's Order comes 
 and they will still be victorious "
 <p>
 (anything) nor withhold (anything) from you, but I am just a 
 distributor (i.e. Qasim), and I give as I am ordered."
