 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:655</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "If a person teaches his slave girl good manners
 properly, educates her properly, and then manumits and marries her, he
 will get a double reward. And if a man believes in Jesus and then 
 believes in me, he will get a double reward. And if a slave fears his 
 Lord (i.e. Allah) and obeys his masters, he too will get a double 
 reward."
