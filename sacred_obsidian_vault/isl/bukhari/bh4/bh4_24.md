 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:25</h3><p><i>Narrated Az-Zuhri:</i></p>
 Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the 
 Quranic Verse:--
 <p>
 "And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls 
 then marry (other) women of your choice." (4.2-3)
 </p><p>
 Aisha said, "It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her
 guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,
 and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of
 her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the 
 orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they
 were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people
 asked Allah's Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following 
 Verse:--
 </p><p>
 "They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah 
 instructs you regarding them..." (4.127)
 </p><p>
 and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was 
 beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her
 without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could 
 get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he 
 would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of 
 her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards
 her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her,
 unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing 
 all her rights.
