 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:318</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 We were in the company of the Prophet while returning from 'Usfan, and
 Allah's Apostle was riding his she-camel keeping Safiya bint Huyay 
 riding behind him. His she-camel slipped and both of them fell down. 
 Abu Talha jumped from his camel and said, "O Allah's Apostle! May 
 Allah sacrifice me for you." The Prophet said, "Take care of the 
 lady." So, Abu Talha covered his face with a garment and went to 
 Safiya and covered her with it, and then he set right the condition of
 their shecamel so that both of them rode, and we were encircling 
 Allah's Apostle like a cover. When we approached Medina, the Prophet 
 said, "We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising 
 our Lord." He kept on saying this till he entered Medina.
