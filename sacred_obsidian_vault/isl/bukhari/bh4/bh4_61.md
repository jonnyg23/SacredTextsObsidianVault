 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:62</h3><p><i>Narrated Kharija bin Zaid:</i></p>
 Zaid bin Thabit said, "When the Quran was compiled from various 
 written manuscripts, one of the Verses of Surat Al-Ahzab was missing 
 which I used to hear Allah's Apostle reciting. I could not find it 
 except with Khuzaima bin Thabjt Al-Ansari, whose witness Allah's 
 Apostle regarded as equal to the witness of two men. And the Verse 
 was:-- "Among the believers are men who have been true to what they 
 covenanted with Allah."    (33.23)
