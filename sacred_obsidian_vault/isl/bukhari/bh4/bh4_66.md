 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:67</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ikrima:</i></p>
 that Ibn 'Abbas told him and 'Ali bin 'Abdullah to go to Abu Said and 
 listen to some of his narrations; So they both went (and saw) Abu Said
 and his brother irrigating a garden belonging to them. When he saw 
 them, he came up to them and sat down with his legs drawn up and 
 wrapped in his garment and said, "(During the construction of the 
 mosque of the Prophet) we carried the adobe of the mosque, one brick 
 at a time while 'Ammar used to carry two at a time. The Prophet passed
 by 'Ammar and removed the dust off his head and said, "May Allah be 
 merciful to 'Ammar. He will be killed by a rebellious aggressive 
 group. 'Ammar will invite them to (obey) Allah and they will invite 
 him to the (Hell) fire."
