 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:98</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Aun:</i></p>
 Once Musa bin Anas while describing the battle of Yamama, said, "Anas 
 bin Malik went to Thabit bin Qais, who had lifted his clothes from his
 thighs and was applying Hunut to his body. Anas asked, 'O Uncle! What 
 is holding you back (from the battle)?' He replied, 'O my nephew! I am
 coming just now,' and went on perfuming himself with Hunut, then he 
 came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people fled 
 from the battle-field. On that Thabit said, 'Clear the way for me to 
 fight the enemy. We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of 
 Allah's Apostle. How bad the habits you have acquired from your 
 enemies!"
