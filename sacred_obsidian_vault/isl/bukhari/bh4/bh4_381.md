 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:377</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 While I was walking with the Prophet who was wearing a Najrani outer 
 garment with a thick hem, a bedouin came upon the Prophet and pulled 
 his garment so violently that I could recognize the impress of the hem
 of the garment on his shoulder, caused by the violence of his pull. 
 Then the bedouin said, "Order for me something from Allah's Fortune 
 which you have." The Prophet turned to him and smiled, and ordered 
 that a gift be given to him.
