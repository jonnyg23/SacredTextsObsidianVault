 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:568</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "You will be gathered (on the Day of Judgment), 
 bare-footed, naked and not circumcised." He then recited:--'As We 
 began the first creation, We, shall repeat it: A Promise We have 
 undertaken: Truly we shall do it.' (21.104) He added, "The first to be
 dressed on the Day of Resurrection, will be Abraham, and some of my 
 companions will be taken towards the left side (i.e. to the (Hell) 
 Fire), and I will say: 'My companions! My companions!' It will be 
 said: 'They renegade from Islam after you left them.' Then I will say 
 as the Pious slave of Allah (i.e. Jesus) said. 'And I was a witness 
 Over them while I dwelt amongst them. When You took me up You were the
 Watcher over them, And You are a witness to all things. If You punish 
 them. They are Your slaves And if You forgive them, Verily you, only 
 You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise." (5.120-121)
