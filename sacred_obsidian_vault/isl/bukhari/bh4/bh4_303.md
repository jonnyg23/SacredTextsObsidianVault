 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:299</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 The people of the tribes of Ril, Dhakwan, 'Usiya and Bani Lihyan came 
 to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they 
 requested him to support them with some men to fight their own people.
 The Prophet supported them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we 
 used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of piety) used to cut 
 wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the 
 (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi'r-Ma'ana where they 
 betrayed and martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe 
 of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan for one month in the prayer.
 <p>
 a Quranic Verse concerning those martyrs which was:-- "O Allah! Let 
 our people be informed on our behalf that we have met our Lord Who has
 got pleased with us and made us pleased." Then the Verse was 
 cancelled.
