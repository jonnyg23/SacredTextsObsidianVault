 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:639</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 When the Verse:-- 'Those who believe and mix not their belief with

 "O Allah's Apostle! Who amongst us does not do wrong to himself?" He 
 replied, "The Verse does not mean this. But that (wrong) means to 
 associate others in worship to Allah: Don't you listen to what Luqman

 in worship with Allah. Verily joining others in worship with Allah is 
 a great wrong indeed." (31.13)
