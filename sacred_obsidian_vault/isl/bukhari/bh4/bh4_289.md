 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:286</h3><p><i>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa:</i></p>
 "An infidel spy came to the Prophet while he was on a journey. The spy
 sat with the companions of the Prophet and started talking and then 
 went away. The Prophet said (to his companions), 'Chase and kill him.'
 So, I killed him." The Prophet then gave him the belongings of the 
 killed spy (in addition to his share of the war booty).
