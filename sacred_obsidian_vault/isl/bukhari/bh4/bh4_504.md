 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:500</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "When nightfalls, then keep your children close to 
 you, for the devil spread out then. An hour later you can let them 
 free; and close the gates of your house (at night), and mention 
 Allah's Name thereupon, and cover your utensils, and mention Allah's 
 Name thereupon, (and if you don't have something to cover your 
 utensil) you may put across it something (e.g. a piece of wood 
 etc.)."
