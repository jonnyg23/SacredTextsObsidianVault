 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:650</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim from his father:</i></p>
 No, By Allah, the Prophet did not tell that Jesus was of red 
 complexion but said, "While I was asleep circumambulating the Ka'ba 
 (in my dream), suddenly I saw a man of brown complexion and lank hair 
 walking between two men, and water was dropping from his head. I 
 asked, 'Who is this?' The people said, 'He is the son of Mary.' Then I
 looked behind and I saw a red-complexioned, fat, curly-haired man, 
 blind in the right eye which looked like a bulging out grape. I asked,
 'Who is this?' They replied, 'He is Ad-Dajjal.' The one who resembled 
 to him among the people, was Ibn Qatar." (Az-Zuhri said, "He (i.e. Ibn
 Qatan) was a man from the tribe Khuza'a who died in the pre-lslamic 
 period.")
