 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:136</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 The Prophet was vigilant one night and when he reached Medina, he 
 said, "Would that a pious man from my companions guard me tonight!" 
 Suddenly we heard the clatter of arms. He said, "Who is that? " He 
 (The new comer) replied, " I am Sad bin Abi Waqqas and have come to 
 guard you." So, the Prophet slept (that night).
