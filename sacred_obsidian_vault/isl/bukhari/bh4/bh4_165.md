 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:164</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet , while in a tent (on the day of the battle of Badr) said,
 "O Allah! I ask you the fulfillment of Your Covenant and Promise. O 
 Allah! If You wish (to destroy the believers) You will never be 
 worshipped after today." Abu Bakr caught him by the hand and said, 
 "This is sufficient, O Allah's Apostle! You have asked Allah 
 pressingly." The Prophet was clad in his armor at that time. He went 
 out, saying to me: "There multitude will be put to flight and they 
 will show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for 
 their full recompense) and that Hour will be more grievous and more 
 bitter (than their worldly failure)." (54.45-46) Khalid said that was 
 on the day of the battle of Badr.
