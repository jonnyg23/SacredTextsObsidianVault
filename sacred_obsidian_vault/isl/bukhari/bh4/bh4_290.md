 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:287</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amr bin Maimun:</i></p>
 Umar (after he was stabbed), instructed (his would-be-successor) 
 saying, "I urge him (i.e. the new Caliph) to take care of those 
 non-Muslims who are under the protection of Allah and His Apostle in 
 that he should observe the convention agreed upon with them, and fight
 on their behalf (to secure their safety) and he should not over-tax 
 them beyond their capability."
