 That he was asked about the wound of the Prophet on the day (of the 
 battle) of Uhud. He said, "The face of the Prophet as wounded and one

 bleeding was increasing continuously, she burnt a mat (of date-palm 
 leaves) till it turned into ashes which she put over the wound and 
 thus the bleeding ceased."
