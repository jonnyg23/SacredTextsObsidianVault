 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:193</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Whenever Allah's Apostle attacked some people, he would never attack 
 them till it was dawn. If he heard the Adhan (i.e. call for prayer) he
 would delay the fight, and if he did not hear the Adhan, he would 
 attack them immediately after dawn. We reached Khaibar at night.
