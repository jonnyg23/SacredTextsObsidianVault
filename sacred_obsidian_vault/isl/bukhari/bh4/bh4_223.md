 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:221</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Abu Sufyan said, "Heraclius sent for me when I was in 'llya' (i.e. 
 Jerusalem). Then he asked for the letter of Allah's Apostle and when 
 he had finished its reading there was a great hue and cry around him 
 and the voices grew louder and we were asked to quit the place. When 
 we were turned out, I said to my companions, 'The cause of Ibn Abi 
 Kabsha has become conspicuous as the King of Bani Al-Asfar is afraid 
 of him.' "
