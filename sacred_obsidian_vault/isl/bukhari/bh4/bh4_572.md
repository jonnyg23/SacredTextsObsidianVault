 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:569</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "On the Day of Resurrection Abraham will meet his 
 father Azar whose face will be dark and covered with dust.(The Prophet
 Abraham will say to him): 'Didn't I tell you not to disobey me?' His 
 father will reply: 'Today I will not disobey you.' 'Abraham will say: 
 'O Lord! You promised me not to disgrace me on the Day of 
 Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and
 dishonoring my father?' Then Allah will say (to him):' 'I have 
 forbidden Paradise for the disbelievers." Then he will be addressed, 
 'O Abraham! Look! What is underneath your feet?' He will look and 
 there he will see a Dhabh (an animal,) blood-stained, which will be 
 caught by the legs and thrown in the (Hell) Fire."
