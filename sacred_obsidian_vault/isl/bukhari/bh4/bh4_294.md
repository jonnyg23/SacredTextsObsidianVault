 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:290</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Umar:</i></p>
 (Later on) Allah's Apostle (once again) went along with Ubai bin Ka'b 
 to the garden of date-palms where Ibn Saiyad was staying. When the 
 Prophet entered the garden, he started hiding himself behind the 
 trunks of the date-palms as he wanted to hear something from the Ibn 
 Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was lying in his 
 bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. 
 Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind
 the trunks of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, "O Saf!" (And 
 this was his name). Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, "Had this 
 woman let him to himself, he would have revealed the reality of his 
 case." Then the Prophet got up amongst the people, glorifying Allah as
 He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, "I warn you about him 
 (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation 
 about him, and Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a 
 statement which no prophet informed his nation of. You should 
 understand that he is a one-eyed man and Allah is not one-eyed."
