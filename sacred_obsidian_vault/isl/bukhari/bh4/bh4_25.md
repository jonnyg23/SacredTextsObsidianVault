 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:26</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 In the lifetime of Allah's Apostle , Umar gave in charity some of his 
 property, a garden of date-palms called Thamgh. 'Umar said, "O Allah's
 Apostle! I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give 
 it in charity." The Prophet; said, "Give it in charity (i.e. as an 
 endowment) with its land and trees on the condition that the land and 
 trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, but
 the fruits are to be spent in charity." So 'Umar gave it in charity, 
 and it was for Allah's Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the 
 poor, for guests, for travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as
 its administrator could eat from it reasonably and fairly, and could 
 let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no intention of 
 becoming wealthy by its means.
