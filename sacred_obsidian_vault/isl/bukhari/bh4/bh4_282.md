 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:279</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Ishaq:</i></p>
 A man asked Al-Bara "O Abu 'Umara! Did you flee on the day (of the 
 battle) of Hunain?" Al-Bara replied while I was listening, "As for 
 Allah's Apostle he did not flee on that day. Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith 
 was holding the reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he
 dismounted and started saying, 'I am the Prophet, and there is no lie 
 about it; I am the son of 'Abdul Muttalib.' On that day nobody was 
 seen braver than the Prophet
