 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:255</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Burda's father:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Three persons will get their reward twice. (One is)
 a person who has a slave girl and he educates her properly and teaches
 her good manners properly (without violence) and then manumits and 
 marries her. Such a person will get a double reward. (Another is) a 
 believer from the people of the scriptures who has been a true 
 believer and then he believes in the Prophet (Muhammad). Such a person
 will get a double reward. (The third is) a slave who observes Allah's 
 Rights and Obligations and is sincere to his master."
