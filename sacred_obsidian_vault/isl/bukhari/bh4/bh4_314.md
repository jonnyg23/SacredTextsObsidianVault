 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:310</h3><p><i>Narrated Qais:</i></p>
 Jarir bin 'Abdullah said to me, "Allah's Apostle said to me, 'Won't 
 you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?' Dhul-Khalasa was a house where the 
 tribe of Khatham used to stay, and it used to be called Ka'bat-ul 
 Yamaniya. So I proceeded with one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the 
 tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the Prophet that I 
 could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his 
 hand and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, 'O Allah!
 Make him firm and a guiding and rightly-guided man." Jarir set out 
 towards that place, dismantled and burnt it, and then sent the good 
 news to Allah's Apostle . The messenger of Jarir said to Allah's 
 Apostle. "O Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I
 did not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) 
 like a scabby camel (covered with tar)." So the Prophet invokes Allah 
 to Bless the horses of the men of Ahmas five times.
