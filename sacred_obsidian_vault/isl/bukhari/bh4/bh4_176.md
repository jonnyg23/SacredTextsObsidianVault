 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:175</h3><p><i>Narrated Khalid bin Madan:</i></p>
 That 'Umair bin Al-Aswad Al-Anasi told him that he went to 'Ubada bin 
 As-Samit while he was staying in his house at the sea-shore of Hims 
 with (his wife) Um Haram. 'Umair said. Um Haram informed us that she 
 heard the Prophet saying, "Paradise is granted to the first batch of 
 my followers who will undertake a naval expedition." Um Haram added, I
 said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Will I be amongst them?' He replied, 'You 
 are amongst them.' The Prophet then said, 'The first army amongst' my 
 followers who will invade Caesar's City will be forgiven their sins.' 
 I asked, 'Will I be one of them, O Allah's Apostle?' He replied in the
 negative."
