 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:158</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</i></p>
 That he proceeded in the company of Allah's Apostle towards Najd to 
 participate in a Ghazwa. (Holy-battle) When Allah's Apostle returned, 
 he too returned with him. Midday came upon them while they were in a 
 valley having many thorny trees. Allah's Apostle and the people 
 dismounted and dispersed to rest in the shade of the trees. Allah's 
 Apostle rested under a tree and hung his sword on it. We all took a 
 nap and suddenly we heard Allah's Apostle calling us. (We woke up) to 
 see a bedouin with him. The Prophet said, "This bedouin took out my 
 sword while I was sleeping and when I woke up, I found the unsheathed 
 sword in his hand and he challenged me saying, 'Who will save you from
 me?' I said thrice, 'Allah.' The Prophet did not punish him but sat 
 down.
