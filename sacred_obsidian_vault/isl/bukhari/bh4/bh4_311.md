 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:307</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet got up amongst us and mentioned Al Ghulul, emphasized its 
 magnitude and declared that it was a great sin saying, "Don't commit 
 Ghulul for I should not like to see anyone amongst you on the Day of 
 Ressurection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating, or
 carrying over his neck a horse that will be neighing. Such a man will 
 be saying: 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me,' and I 
 will reply, 'I can't help you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to 
 you Nor should I like to see a man carrying over his neck, a camel 
 that will be grunting. Such a man will say, 'O Allah's Apostle! 
 Intercede with Allah for me, and I will say, 'I can't help you for I 
 have conveyed Allah's Message to you,' or one carrying over his neck 
 gold and silver and saying, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah 
 for me,' and I will say, 'I can't help you for I have conveyed Allah's
 Message to you,' or one carrying clothes that will be fluttering, and 
 the man will say, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me.' 
 And I will say, 'I can't help you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message
 to you."
