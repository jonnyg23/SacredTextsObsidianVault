 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:368</h3><p><i>Narrated Jubair bin Mutim:</i></p>
 I and 'Uthman bin 'Affan went to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's 
 Apostle! You have given to Bani Al-Muttalib and left us although they 
 and we are of the same kinship to you." Allah's Apostle said, "Bani 
 Muttalib and Bani Hashim are one and the same." The Prophet did not 
 give a share to Bani Abd Shams and Bani Naufai. (Ibn Ishaq said, "Abd 
 Shams and Hashim and Al-Muttalib were maternal brothers and their 
 mother was 'Atika bint Murra and Naufal was their paternal brother.)
