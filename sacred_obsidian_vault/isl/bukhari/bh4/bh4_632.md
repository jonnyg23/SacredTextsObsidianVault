 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:629</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Amr:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle was informed that I have said: "By Allah, I will fast 
 all the days and pray all the nights as long as I live." On that, 
 Allah's Apostle asked me. "Are you the one who says: 'I will fast all 
 the days and pray all the nights as long as I live?' " I said, "Yes, I
 have said it." He said, "You cannot do that. So fast (sometimes) and 
 do not fast (sometimes). Pray and sleep. Fast for three days a month, 
 for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten time, and so the 
 fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year." I said, 
 "O Allah's Apostle! I can do (fast) more than this." He said, "Fast on
 every third day. I said: I can do (fast) more than that, He said: 
 "Fast on alternate days and this was the fasting of David which is the
 most moderate sort of fasting." I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I can do 
 (fast) more than that." He said, "There is nothing better than that."
