 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:227</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 That she said, "O Allah's Apostle! Your companions are returning with 
 the reward of both Hajj and 'Umra, while I am returning with (the 
 reward of) Hajj only." He said to her, "Go, and let 'Abdur-Rahman 
 (i.e. your brother) make you sit behind him (on the animal)." So, he 
 ordered 'AbdurRahman to let her perform 'Umra from Al-Tan'im. Then the
 Prophet waited for her at the higher region of Mecca till she 
 returned.
