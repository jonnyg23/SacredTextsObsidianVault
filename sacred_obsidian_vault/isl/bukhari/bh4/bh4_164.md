 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:163</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Qatada:</i></p>
 That he was in the company of Allah's Apostle and when they had 
 covered a portion of the road to Mecca, he and some of the companions 
 lagged behind. The latter were in a state of Ihram, while he was not. 
 He saw an onager and rode his horse and requested his companions to 
 give him his lash but they refused. Then he asked them to give him his
 spear but they refused, so he took it himself, attacked the onager, 
 and killed it. Some of the companions of the Prophet ate of it while 
 some others refused to eat. When they caught up with Allah's Apostle 
 they asked him about that, and he said, "That was a meal Allah fed you
 with." (It is also said that Allah's Apostle asked, "Have you got 
 something of its meat?")
