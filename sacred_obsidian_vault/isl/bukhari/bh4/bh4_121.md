 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:120</h3><p><i>Narrated ('Abdullah) bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 The Prophet arranged for a horse race amongst the horses that had been
 made lean to take place between Al-Hafya'' and Thaniyat Al-Wada' (i.e.
 names of two places) and the horses which had not been mad.? lean from
 Ath-Thaniyat to the mosque of Bani Zuraiq. I was also amongst those 
 who took part in that horse race. Sufyan, a sub-narrator, said, "The 
 distance between Al-Hafya and Thaniya Al-Wada' is five or six miles; 
 and between Thaniya and the mosque of Bani Zuraiq is one mile."
