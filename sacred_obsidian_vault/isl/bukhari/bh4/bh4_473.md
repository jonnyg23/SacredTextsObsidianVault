 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:469</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "The first batch (of people) who will enter 
 Paradise will be (glittering) like a full moon; and those who will 
 enter next will be (glittering) like the brightest star. Their hearts 
 will be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have no enmity 
 amongst themselves, and everyone of them shall have two wives, each of
 whom will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that the marrow of the
 bones of their legs will be seen through the flesh. They will be 
 glorifying Allah in the morning and evening, and will never fall ill, 
 and they will neither blow their noses, nor spit. Their utensils will 
 be of gold and silver, and their combs will be of gold, and the fuel 
 used in their centers will be the aloes-wood, and their sweat will 
 smell like musk."
