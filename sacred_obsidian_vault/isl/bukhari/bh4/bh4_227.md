 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:225</h3><p><i>Narrated Salama:</i></p>
 Once the journey-food of the people ran short and they were in great 
 need. So, they came to the Prophet to take his permission for 
 slaughtering their camels, and he permitted them. Then 'Umar met them 
 and they informed him about it. He said, "What will sustain you after 
 your camels (are finished)?" Then 'Umar went to the Prophet and said, 
 "O Allah's Apostle! What will sustain them after their camels (are 
 finished)?" Allah's Apostle said, "Make an announcement amongst the 
 people that they should bring all their remaining food (to me)." (They
 brought it and) the Prophet invoked Allah and asked for His Blessings 
 for it. Then he asked them to bring their food utensils and the people
 started filling their food utensils with their hands till they were 
 satisfied. Allah's Apostle then said, "I testify that None has the 
 right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. "
