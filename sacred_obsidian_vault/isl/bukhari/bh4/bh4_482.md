 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:478</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The people of Paradise will look at the dwellers of
 the lofty mansions (i.e. a superior place in Paradise) in the same way
 as one looks at a brilliant star far away in the East or in the West 
 on the horizon; all that is because of their superiority over one 
 another (in rewards)." On that the people said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
 Are these lofty mansions for the prophets which nobody else can reach?
 The Prophet replied," No! "By Allah in whose Hands my life is, these 
 are for the men who believed in Allah and also believed in the 
 Apostles."
