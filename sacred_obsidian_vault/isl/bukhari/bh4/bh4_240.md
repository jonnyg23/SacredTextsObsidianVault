 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:238</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</i></p>
 Whenever the Prophet returned from the Hajj or the 'Umra or a Ghazwa, 
 he would say Takbir thrice. Whenever he came upon a mountain path or 
 wasteland, and then he would say, "None has the right to be worshipped
 but Allah, Alone Who has no partner. All the Kingdom belongs to Him 
 and all the praises are for Him and He is Omnipotent. We are returning
 with repentance, worshipping, prostrating ourselves and praising our 
 Lord. Allah fulfilled His Promise, granted victory to His slave and He
 Alone defeated all the clans."
