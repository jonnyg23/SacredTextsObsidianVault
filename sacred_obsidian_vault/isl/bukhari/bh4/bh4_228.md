 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:226</h3><p><i>Narrated Wahb bin Kaisan:</i></p>
 Jabir bin 'Abdullah said, "We set out, and we were three-hundred men 
 carrying our journey-food on our shoulders. Then we began to eat a 
 single date each per day." A man asked (Jabir), "O Abu 'Abdullah! How 
 could a person be satisfied with a single date?" Jabir replied, "We 
 realized the value of that one date when we could not even have that 
 much till we reached the sea-shore, when all of a sudden we saw a huge
 fish cast by the sea. So, we ate of it as much as we wished for 
 eighteen days."
