 'Umar came to the Mosque while Hassan was reciting a poem. ('Umar 
 disapproved of that). On that Hassan said, "I used to recite poetry in
 this very Mosque in the presence of one (i.e. the Prophet ) who was 
 better than you." Then he turned towards Abu Huraira and said (to 
 him), "I ask you by Allah, did you hear Allah's Apostle saying (to 
 me), "Retort on my behalf. O Allah! Support him (i.e. Hassan) with the
 Holy Spirit?" Abu Huraira said, "Yes."
