 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:155</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle came to my house while two girls were singing beside 
 me the songs of Bu'ath (a story about the war between the two tribes 
 of the Ansar, i.e. Khazraj and Aus, before Islam.) The Prophet 
 reclined on the bed and turned his face to the other side. Abu Bakr 
 came and scolded me and said protestingly, "Instrument of Satan in the
 presence of Allah's Apostle?" Allah's Apostle turned his face towards 
 him and said, "Leave them." When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I waved 
 the two girls to go away and they left. It was the day of 'Id when 
 negroes used to play with leather shields and spears. Either I 
 requested Allah's Apostle or he himself asked me whether I would like 
 to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he let me stand
 behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, 
 "Carry on, O Bani Arfida (i.e. negroes)!" When I got tired, he asked 
 me if that was enough. I replied in the affirmative and he told me to 
 leave.
