 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:598</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 That the Prophet said (to her). "Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in 
 prayer." She replied," Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted person and when he 
 stands at your place, he will weep (so he will not be able to lead the
 prayer)." The Prophet repeated the same order and she gave the same 
 reply. The narrator, Shuba said that the Prophet said on the third or 
 fourth time. "You are (like) the female companions of Joseph. Order 
 Abu Bakr to lead the prayer. "
