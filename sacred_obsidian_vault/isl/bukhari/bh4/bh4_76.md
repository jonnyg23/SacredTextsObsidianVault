 Sad used to teach his sons the following words as a teacher teaches 
 his students the skill of writing and used to say that Allah's Apostle
 used to seek Refuge with Allah from them (i.e. the evils) at the end 
 of every prayer. The words are:

 'O Allah! I seek refuge with You from cowardice, and seek refuge with 
 You from being brought back to a bad stage of old life and seek refuge
 with You from the afflictions of the world, and seek refuge with You 
 from the punishments in the grave.'
