 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:588</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa'idi:</i></p>
 The people asked, "O Allah's Apostle! How shall we (ask Allah to) send
 blessings on you?" Allah's Apostle replied, "Say: O Allah! Send Your 
 Mercy on Muhammad and on his wives and on his off spring, as You sent 
 Your Mercy on Abraham's family; and send Your Blessings on Muhammad 
 and on his offspring, as You sent Your Blessings on Abraham's family, 
 for You are the Most Praise-worthy, the Most Glorious."
