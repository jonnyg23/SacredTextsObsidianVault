 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:204</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 That heard Allah's Apostle saying, "We are the last but will be the 
 foremost to enter Paradise)." The Prophet added, "He who obeys me, 
 obeys Allah, and he who disobeys me, disobeys Allah. He who obeys the 
 chief, obeys me, and he who disobeys the chief, disobeys me. The Imam 
 is like a shelter for whose safety the Muslims should fight and where 
 they should seek protection. If the Imam orders people with 
 righteousness and rules justly, then he will be rewarded for that, and
 if he does the opposite, he will be responsible for that."
