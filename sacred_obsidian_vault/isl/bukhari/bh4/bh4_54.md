 The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, "Zaid took the flag and was 
 martyred, and then Ja'far took the flag and was martyred, and then 
 'Abdullah bin Rawaha took the flag and was martyred too, and then 
 Khalid bin Al-Walid took the flag though he was not appointed as a 
 commander and Allah made him victorious." The Prophet further added, 
 "It would not please us to have them with us." Aiyub, a sub-narrator, 
 added, "Or the Prophet, shedding tears, said, 'It would not p ease 
 them to be with us."
