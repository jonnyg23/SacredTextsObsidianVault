 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:510</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 On the day (of the battle) of Uhud when the pagans were defeated, 
 Satan shouted, "O slaves of Allah! Beware of the forces at your back,"
 and on that the Muslims of the front files fought with the Muslims of 
 the back files (thinking they were pagans). Hudhaifa looked back to 
 see his father "Al-Yaman," (being attacked by the Muslims). He 
 shouted, "O Allah's Slaves! My father! My father!" By Allah, they did 
 not stop till they killed him. Hudhaifa said, "May Allah forgive you."
 'Urwa said that Hudhaifa continued to do good (invoking Allah to 
 forgive the killer of his father till he met Allah (i.e. died).
