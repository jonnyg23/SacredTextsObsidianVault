 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:476</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The first batch (of people) who will enter Paradise
 will be (glittering) like the full moon, and the batch next to them 
 will be (glittering) like the most brilliant star in the sky. Their 
 hearts will be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have 
 neither enmity nor jealousy amongst themselves; everyone will have two
 wives from the houris, (who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent
 that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the 
 bones and the flesh."
