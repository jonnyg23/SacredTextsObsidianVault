 that a man asked him. "O Abu 'Umara! Did you flee on the day (of the 
 battle) of Hunain?" He replied, "No, by Allah, the Prophet did not 
 flee but the hasty people fled and the people of the Tribe of Hawazin 
 attacked them with arrows, while the Prophet was riding his white mule
 and Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith was holding its reins, and the Prophet 
 was saying, 'I am the Prophet in truth, I am the son of 'Abdul 
 Muttalib.' "
