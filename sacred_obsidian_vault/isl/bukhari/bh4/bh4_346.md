 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:342</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ali bin Al-Husain:</i></p>
 That when they reached Medina after returning from Yazid bin Mu'awaiya
 after the martyrdom of Husain bin 'Ali (may Allah bestow His Mercy 
 upon him), Al-Miswar bin Makhrama met him and said to him, "Do you 
 have any need you may order me to satisfy?" 'Ali said, "No." Al-Miswar
 said, Will you give me the sword of Allah's Apostle for I am afraid 
 that people may take it from you by force? By Allah, if you give it to
 me, they will never be able to take it till I die." When Ali bin Abu 
 Talib demanded the hand of the daughter of Abi Jahal to be his wife 
 besides Fatima, I heard Allah's Apostle on his pulpit delivering a 
 sermon in this connection before the people, and I had then attained 
 my age of puberty. Allah's Apostle said, "Fatima is from me, and I am 
 afraid she will be subjected to trials in her religion (because of 
 jealousy)." The Prophet then mentioned one of his son-in-law who was 
 from the tribe of 'Abu Shams, and he praised him as a good son-in-law,
 saying, "Whatever he said was the truth, and he promised me and 
 fulfilled his promise. I do not make a legal thing illegal, nor do I 
 make an illegal thing legal, but by Allah, the daughter of Allah's 
 Apostle and the daughter of the enemy of Allah, (i.e. Abu Jahl) can 
 never get together (as the wives of one man) (See 
 Hadith No. 76, Vo. 5).
