 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:217</h3><p><i>Narrated Yali:</i></p>
 I participated in the Ghazwa of Tabuk along with Allah's Apostle and I
 gave a young camel to be ridden in Jihad and that was, to me, one of 
 my best deeds. Then I employed a laborer who quarrelled with another 
 person. One of them bit the hand of the other and the latter drew his 
 hand from the mouth of the former pulling out his front tooth. Then 
 the former instituted a suit against the latter before the Prophet who
 rejected that suit saying, "Do you expect him to put out his hand for 
 you to snap as a male camel snaps (vegetation)?"
