 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:148</h3><p><i>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa:</i></p>
 The Prophet passed by some people of the tribe of Bani Aslam who were 
 practicing archery. The Prophet said, "O Bani Ismail ! Practice 
 archery as your father Isma'il was a great archer. Keep on throwing 
 arrows and I am with Bani so-and-so." So one of the parties ceased 
 throwing. Allah's Apostle said, "Why do you not throw?" They replied, 
 "How should we throw while you are with them (i.e. on their side)?" On
 that the Prophet said, "Throw, and I am with all of you."
