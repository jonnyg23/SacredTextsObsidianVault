 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:612</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 That he differed with Al-Hur bin Qais Al-Fazari regarding the 
 companion of Moses. Ibn 'Abbas said that he was Al-Khadir. Meanwhile 
 Ubai bin Ka'b passed by them and Ibn 'Abbas called him saying, "My 
 friend and I have differed regarding Moses' companion whom Moses asked
 the way to meet. Have you heard Allah's Apostle mentioning something 
 about him?" He said, "Yes, I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'While 
 Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and 
 asked (him), 'Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?' Moses 
 replied, 'No.' So, Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: 'Yes, 
 Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).' Moses asked how to meet
 him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and he 
 was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he 
 would meet him. So, Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in 
 the sea. The servant boy of Moses said to him, 'Do you know that when 
 we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish, and t was 
 only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.' Moses said, 
 That was what we were seeking after,' and both of them returned, 
 following their footmarks and found Khadir; and what happened further 
 to them, is mentioned in Allah's Book."
