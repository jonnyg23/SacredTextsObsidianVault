 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:272</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara:</i></p>
 I saw Allah's Apostle on the day (of the battle) of the Trench 
 carrying earth till the hair of his chest were covered with dust and 
 he was a hairy man. He was reciting the following verses of 'Abdullah 
 (bin Rawaha): "O Allah, were it not for You, We would not have been 
 guided, Nor would we have given in charity, nor prayed. So, bestow on 
 us calmness, and when we meet the enemy. Then make our feet firm, for 
 indeed, Yet if they want to put us in affliction, (i.e. want to fight 
 against us) we would not (flee but withstand them)." The Prophet used 
 to raise his voice while reciting these verses. (See 
 Hadith No. 432, Vol. 5).
