 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:549</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle, the true and truly inspired said, "(as regards your 
 creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for
 the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for an other forty 
 days, and then a piece of flesh for an other forty days. Then Allah 
 sends an angel to write four words: He writes his deeds, time of his 
 death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be wretched or 
 blessed (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a 
 man may do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so 
 much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it,
 and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and so he 
 starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and enters
 Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the 
 people of Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a 
 cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the 
 angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the people of the 
 (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire."
