 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:216</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Were it not for the fear that it would be 
 difficult for my followers, I would not have remained behind any 
 Sariya, (army-unit) but I don't have riding camels and have no other 
 means of conveyance to carry them on, and it is hard for me that my 
 companions should remain behind me. No doubt I wish I could fight in 
 Allah's Cause and be martyred and come to life again to be martyred 
 and come to life once more."
