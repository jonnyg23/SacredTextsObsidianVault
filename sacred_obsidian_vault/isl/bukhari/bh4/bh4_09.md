 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:10</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>

 be inherited by his offspring; as for the parents (of the deceased), 
 they would inherit by the will of the deceased. Then Allah cancelled

 amount inherited by the female, and for each parent a sixth (of the 
 whole legacy) and for the wife an eighth or a fourth and for the 
 husband a half or a fourth.
