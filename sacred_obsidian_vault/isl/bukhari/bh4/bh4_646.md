 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:643</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The superiority of 'Aisha to other ladies is like 
 the superiority of Tharid (i.e. meat and bread dish) to other meals. 
 Many men reached the level of perfection, but no woman reached such a 
 level except Mary, the daughter of Imran and Asia, the wife of 
 Pharaoh."
 <p>
 those women who ride camels (i.e. Arabs), the ladies of Quraish are 
 the best. They are merciful and kind to their off-spring and the best 
 guardians of their husbands' properties.' Abu Huraira added, "Mary the
 daughter of Imran never rode a camel."
