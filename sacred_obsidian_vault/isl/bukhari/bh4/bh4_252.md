 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:250</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 That he heard the Prophet saying, "It is not permissible for a man to 
 be alone with a woman, and no lady should travel except with a Muhram 
 (i.e. her husband or a person whom she cannot marry in any case for 
 ever; e.g. her father, brother, etc.)." Then a man got up and said, "O
 Allah's Apostle! I have enlisted in the army for such-and-such Ghazwa 
 and my wife is proceeding for Hajj." Allah's Apostle said, "Go, and 
 perform the Hajj with your wife."
