 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:345</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari:</i></p>
 A man amongst us begot a boy whom he named Al-Qasim. On that the Ansar
 said, (to the man), "We will never call you Abu-al-Qasim and will 
 never please you with this blessed title." So, he went to the Prophet 
 and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have begotten a boy whom I named 
 Al-Qasim and the Ansar said, 'We will never call you Abu-al-Qasim, nor
 will we please you with this title.' " The Prophet said, "The Ansar 
 have done well. Name by my name, but do not name by my Kunya, for I am
 Qasim."
