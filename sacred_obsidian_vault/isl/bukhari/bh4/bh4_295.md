 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:291</h3><p><i>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</i></p>
 I asked the Prophet during his Hajj, "O Allah's Apostle! Where will 
 you stay tomorrow?" He said, "Has Aqil left for us any house?" He then
 added, "Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e. Al-Muhassab, 
 where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal 
 to heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against 
 Bani Hashim on the terms that they would not deal with the members of 
 the is tribe or give them shelter." (Az-Zuhri said, "Khaif means 
 valley.") (See Hadith No. 659, Vol. 2)
