 Some people asked the Prophet: "Who is the most honorable amongst the 
 people?" He replied, "The most honorable among them is the one who is 
 the most Allah-fearing." They said, "O Allah's Prophet! We do not ask 
 about this." He said, "Then the most honorable person is Joseph, 
 Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's 
 Prophet, the son of Allah's Khalil." They said, "We do not ask about 
 this." He said, "Then you want to ask me about the Arabs' descent?" 
 They said, "Yes." He said, "Those who were best in the pre-lslamic 
 period, are the best in Islam, if they comprehend (the religious 
 knowledge)."
