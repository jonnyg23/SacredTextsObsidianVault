 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:412</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said on the day of the conquest of Mecca, "There is no
 migration now, but there is Jihad (i.e.. holy battle) and good 
 intentions. And when you are called for Jihad, you should come out at 
 once" Allah's Apostle also said, on the day of the conquest of Mecca, 
 "Allah has made this town a sanctuary since the day He created the 
 Heavens and the Earth. So, it is a sanctuary by Allah's Decree till 
 the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was not legal for anyone 
 before me, and it was made legal for me only for an hour by daytime. 
 So, it (i.e. Mecca) is a sanctuary by Allah's Decree till the Day of 
 Resurrection. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, and its game should
 not be chased, its fallen property (i.e. Luqata) should not be picked 
 up except by one who will announce it publicly; and its grass should 
 not be uprooted," On that Al-'Abbas said, "O Allah's Apostle! Except 
 the Idhkhir, because it is used by the goldsmiths and by the people 
 for their houses." On that the Prophet said, "Except the Idhkhir."
