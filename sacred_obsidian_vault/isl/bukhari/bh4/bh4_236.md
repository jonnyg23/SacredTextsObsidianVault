 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:234</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 The Prophet reached Khaibar in the morning, while the people were 
 coming out carrying their spades over their shoulders. When they saw 
 him they said, "This is Muhammad and his army! Muhammad and his army!"
 So, they took refuge in the fort. The Prophet raised both his hands 
 and said, "Allahu Akbar, Khaibar is ruined, for when we approach a 
 nation (i.e. enemy to fight) then miserable is the morning of the 
 warned ones." Then we found some donkeys which we (killed and) cooked:
 The announcer of the Prophet announced: "Allah and His Apostle  forbid
 you to eat donkey's meat." So, all the pots including their contents 
 were turned upside down.
