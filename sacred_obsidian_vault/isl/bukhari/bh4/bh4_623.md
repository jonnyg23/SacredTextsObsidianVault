 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:620</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A Muslim and a Jew quarreled. The Muslim taking an oath, said, "By Him
 Who has preferred Muhammad over all people...!" The Jew said, "By Him 
 Who has preferred Moses, over all people." The Muslim raised his hand 
 and slapped the Jew who came to the Prophet to tell him what had 
 happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet said, "Don't give me 
 superiority over Moses, for the people will become unconscious (on the
 Day of Resurrection) and I will be the first to gain consciousness to 
 see Moses standing and holding a side of Allah's Throne. I will not 
 know if he has been among those people who have become unconscious; 
 and that he has gained consciousness before me, or he has been amongst
 those whom Allah has exempted."
