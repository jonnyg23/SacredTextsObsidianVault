 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:198</h3><p><i>Narrated Ka'b bin Malik:</i></p>
 Whenever Allah's Apostle intended to carry out a Ghazwa, he would use 
 an equivocation to conceal his real destination till it was the Ghazwa
 of Tabuk which Allah's Apostle carried out in very hot weather. As he 
 was going to face a very long journey through a wasteland and was to 
 meet and attack a large number of enemies. So, he made the situation 
 clear to the Muslims so that they might prepare themselves accordingly
 and get ready to conquer their enemy. The Prophet informed them of the
 destination he was heading for (Ka'b bin Malik used to say, "Scarcely 
 did Allah's Apostle set out for a journey on a day other than 
 Thursday.")
