 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:162</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 That he participated in a Ghazwa (Holy-Battle) in the company of 
 Allah's Apostle. Midday came upon them while they were in a valley 
 having many thorny trees. The people dispersed to rest in the shade of
 the trees. The Prophet rested under a tree, hung his sword on it, and 
 then slept. Then he woke up to find near to him, a man whose presence 
 he had not noticed before. The Prophet said, "This (man) took my sword
 (out of its scabbard) and said, 'Who will save you from me.' I 
 replied, 'Allah.' So, he put the sword back into its scabbard, and you
 see him sitting here." Anyhow, the Prophet did not punish him. (See 
 Hadith No. 158)
