 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:293</h3><p><i>Narrated Hudhaifa:</i></p>
 The Prophet said (to us), " List the names of those people who have 
 announced that they are Muslims." So, we listed one thousand and five 
 hundred men. Then we wondered, "Should we be afraid (of infidels) 
 although we are one thousand and five hundred in number?" No doubt, we
 witnessed ourselves being afflicted with such bad trials that one 
 would have to offer the prayer alone in fear.
