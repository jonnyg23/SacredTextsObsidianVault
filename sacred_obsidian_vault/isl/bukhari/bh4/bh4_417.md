 Some people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet and he said (to them), 
 "O Bani Tamim! rejoice with glad tidings." They said, "You have given 
 us glad tidings, now give us something." On hearing that the color of 
 his face changed then the people of Yemen came to him and he said, "O 
 people of Yemen ! Accept the good tidings, as Bani Tamim has refused 
 them." The Yemenites said, "We accept them. Then the Prophet started 
 taking about the beginning of creation and about Allah's Throne. In 
 the mean time a man came saying, "O 'Imran! Your she-camel has run 
 away!'' (I got up and went away), but l wish I had not left that place
 (for I missed what Allah's Apostle had said).
