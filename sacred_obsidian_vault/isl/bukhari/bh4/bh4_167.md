 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:166</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The example of a miser and the one who gives in 
 charity, is like the example of two men wearing iron cloaks so tightly
 that their arms are raised forcibly towards their collar-bones. So, 
 whenever a charitable person wants to give in charity, his cloak 
 spreads over his body so much so that it wipes out his traces, but 
 whenever the miser wants to give in charity, the rings (of the iron 
 cloak) come closer to each other and press over his body, and his 
 hands gets connected to his collar-bones. Abu Huraira heard the 
 Prophet saying. "The miser then tries to widen it but in vain."
