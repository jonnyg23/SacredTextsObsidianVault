 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:501</h3><p><i>Narrated Safiya bint Huyay:</i></p>
 While Allah's Apostle was in Itikaf, I called on him at night and 
 having had a talk with him, I got up to depart. He got up also to 
 accompany me to my dwelling place, which was then in the house of 
 Usama bin Zaid. Two Ansari men passed by, and when they saw the 
 Prophet they hastened away. The Prophet said (to them). "Don't hurry! 
 It is Safiya, the daughter of Huyay (i.e. my wife)." They said, 
 "Glorified be Allah! O Allah's Apostle! (How dare we suspect you?)" He
 said, "Satan circulates in the human mind as blood circulates in it, 
 and I was afraid that Satan might throw an evil thought (or something)
 into your hearts."
