 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:192</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</i></p>
 That he heard the Prophet on the day (of the battle) of Khaibar 
 saying, "I will give the flag to a person at whose hands Allah will 
 grant victory." So, the companions of the Prophet got up, wishing 
 eagerly to see to whom the flag will be given, and everyone of them 
 wished to be given the flag. But the Prophet asked for 'Ali. Someone 
 informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he ordered 
 them to bring 'Ali in front of him. Then the Prophet spat in his eyes 
 and his eyes were cured immediately as if he had never any 
 eye-trouble. 'Ali said, "We will fight with them (i.e. infidels) till 
 they become like us (i.e. Muslims)." The Prophet said, "Be patient, 
 till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what 
 Allah has enjoined upon them. By Allah! If a single person embraces 
 Islam at your hands (i.e. through you), that will be better for you 
 than the red camels."
