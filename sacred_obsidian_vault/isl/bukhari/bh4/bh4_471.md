 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:467</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Allah said, "I have prepared for My Pious 
 slaves things which have never been seen by an eye, or heard by an 
 ear, or imagined by a human being." If you wish, you can recite this 
 Verse from the Holy Quran:--"No soul knows what is kept hidden for 
 them, of joy as a reward for what they used to do."   (32.17)
