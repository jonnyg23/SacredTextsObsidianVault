 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:591</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "We are more liable to be in doubt than Abraham 
 when he said, 'My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead." . He 
 (i.e. Allah) slid: 'Don't you believe then?' He (i.e. Abraham) said: 
 "Yes, but (I ask) in order to be stronger in Faith." (2.260) And may 
 Allah send His Mercy on Lot! He wished to have a powerful support. If 
 I were to stay in prison for such a long time as Joseph did I would 
 have accepted the offer (of freedom without insisting on having my 
 guiltless less declared)."
