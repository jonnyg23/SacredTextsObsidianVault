 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:337</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amra bint Abdur-Rahman:</i></p>
 'Aisha, the wife of the Prophet told her that once Allah's Apostle was
 with her and she heard somebody asking permission to enter Hafsa's 
 house. She said, "O Allah's Apostle! This man is asking permission to

 (meaning the foster uncle of Hafsa). What is rendered illegal because 
 of blood relations, is also rendered illegal because of the 
 corresponding foster-relations."
