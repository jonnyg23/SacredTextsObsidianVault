 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:190</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle sent his letter to Khusrau and ordered his messenger 
 to hand it over to the Governor of Bahrain who was to hand it over to 
 Khusrau. So, when Khusrau read the letter he tore it. Said bin 
 Al-Musaiyab said, "The Prophet then invoked Allah to disperse them 
 with full dispersion, (destroy them (i.e. Khusrau and his followers) 
 severely)".
