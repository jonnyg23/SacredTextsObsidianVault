 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:402</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Abu Bakr, on the day of Nahr (i.e. slaughtering of animals for 
 sacrifice), sent me in the company of others to make this 
 announcement: "After this year, no pagan will be allowed to perform 
 the Hajj, and none will be allowed to perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba 
 undressed." And the day of Al-Hajj-ul-Akbar is the day of Nahr, and it
 called Al-Akbar because the people call the 'Umra Al-Hajj-ul-Asghar 
 (i.e. the minor Hajj). Abu Bakr threw back the pagans' covenant that 
 year, and therefore, no pagan performed the Hajj in the year of 
 Hajj-ul-Wada' of the Prophets.
