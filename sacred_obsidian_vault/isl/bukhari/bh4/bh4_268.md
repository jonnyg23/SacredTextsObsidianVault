 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:266</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim Abu An-Nadr:</i></p>
 (the freed slave of 'Umar bin 'Ubaidullah) I was Umar's clerk. Once 
 Abdullah bin Abi Aufa wrote a letter to 'Umar when he proceeded to 
 Al-Haruriya. I read in it that Allah's Apostle in one of his military 
 expeditions against the enemy, waited till the sun declined and then 
 he got up amongst the people saying, "O people! Do not wish to meet 
 the enemy, and ask Allah for safety, but when you face the enemy, be 
 patient, and remember that Paradise is under the shades of swords." 
 Then he said, "O Allah, the Revealer of the Holy Book, and the Mover 
 of the clouds and the Defeater of the clans, defeat them, and grant us
 victory over them."
