 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:630</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-As:</i></p>
 The Prophet said to me, "I have been informed that you pray all the 
 nights and observe fast all the days; is this true?" I replied, "Yes."
 He said, "If you do so, your eyes will become weak and you will get 
 bored. So fast three days a month, for this will be the fasting of a 
 whole year, or equal to the fasting of a whole year." I said, "I find 
 myself able to fast more." He said, "Then fast like the fasting of 
 (the Prophet) David who used to fast on alternate days and would not 
 flee on facing the enemy."
