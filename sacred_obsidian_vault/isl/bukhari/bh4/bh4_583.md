 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:580</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah:</i></p>
 When the Verse:--"It is those who believe and do not confuse their 
 belief with wrong ( i.e. joining others in worship with Allah" (6.83) 
 was revealed, we said, "O Allah's Apostle! Who is there amongst us who
 has not done wrong to himself?" He replied, "It is not as you say, for
 'wrong' in the Verse and 'do not confuse their belief, with wrong 
 means 'SHIRK' (i.e. joining others in worship with Allah). Haven't you

 worship with Allah, verily joining others in worship with Allah is a 
 great wrong indeed."   (31.13)
