 I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Which mosque was built first?" He replied,
 "Al-Masjid-ul-Haram." I asked, "Which (was built) next?" He replied, 
 "Al-Masjid-ul-Aqs-a (i.e. Jerusalem)." I asked, "What was the period

 "Wherever the time for the prayer comes upon you, perform the prayer, 
 for all the earth is a place of worshipping for you."
