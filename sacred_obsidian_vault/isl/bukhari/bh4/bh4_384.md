 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:380</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 Umar bin Al-Khattab expelled all the Jews and Christians from the land
 of Hijaz. Allah's Apostle after conquering Khaibar, thought of 
 expelling the Jews from the land which, after he conquered it belonged
 to Allah, Allah's Apostle and the Muslims. But the Jews requested 
 Allah's Apostle to leave them there on the condition that they would 
 do the labor and get half of the fruits (the land would yield). 
 Allah's Apostle said, "We shall keep you on these terms as long as we 
 wish." Thus they stayed till the time of 'Umar's Caliphate when he 
 expelled them to Taima and Ariha.
