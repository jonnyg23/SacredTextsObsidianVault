 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:333</h3><p><i>Narrated Safiya:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet) That she came to visit Allah's Apostle while
 he was in Itikaf(i.e. seclusion
 in the Mosque during the last ten days of Ramadan. When she got up to
 return, Allah's Apostle got up with her and accompanied her, and when 
 he reached near the gate of the Mosque close to the door (of the 
 house) of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by
 them and greeted Allah's Apostle and then went away. Allah's Apostle 
 addressed them saying, "Don't hurry! (She is my wife)," They said, 
 "Glorified be Allah! O Allah's Apostle (You are far away from any 
 suspicion)," and his saying was hard on them. Allah's Apostle said, 
 "Satan circulates in the mind of a person as blood does (in his body).
 I was afraid that Satan might put some (evil) thoughts in your 
 minds."
