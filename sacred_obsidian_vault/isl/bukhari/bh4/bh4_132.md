 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:131</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 On the day (of the battle) of Uhad when (some) people retreated and 
 left the Prophet, I saw 'Aisha bint Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim, with their

 "carrying the water skins on their backs"). Then they would pour the 
 water in the mouths of the people, and return to fill the water skins 
 again and came back again to pour water in the mouths of the people.
