 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:305</h3><p><i>Narrated Um Khalid:</i></p>
 (the daughter of Khalid bin Said) I went to Allah's Apostle with my 
 father and I was Nearing a yellow shirt. Allah's Apostle said, "Sanah,
 Sanah!" ('Abdullah, the narrator, said that 'Sanah' meant 'good' in 
 the Ethiopian language). I then started playing with the seal of 
 Prophethood (in between the Prophet's shoulders) and my father rebuked
 me harshly for that. Allah's Apostle said. "Leave her," and then 
 Allah's Apostle (invoked Allah to grant me a long life) by saying 
 (thrice), "Wear this dress till it is worn out and then wear it till 
 it is worn out, and then wear it till it is worn out." (The narrator 
 adds, "It is said that she lived for a long period, wearing that 
 (yellow) dress till its color became dark because of long wear.")
