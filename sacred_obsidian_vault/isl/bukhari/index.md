 The Hadith are anecdotes about Muhammad and other founders of Islam.
 They are considered important source material
 about religious practice, law, and historical traditions.
 This is an extensive collection of Hadith as organized by 
 Muhammad Ismâ'îl al-Bukhârî, one of the
 most respected of the Hadith redactors. For more Hadith, see
 <a href="../hadith/index.htm">A Manual of Hadith</a>.</p>
