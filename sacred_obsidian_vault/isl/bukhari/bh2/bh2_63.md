 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:64</h3><p><i>Narrated Shu'aib:</i></p>
 I asked Az-Zuhri, "Did the Prophet ever offer the Fear Prayer?" 
 Az-Zuhri said, "I was told by Salim that 'Abdullah bin  Umar I had 
 said, 'I took part in a holy battle with Allah's Apostle I in Najd. We
 faced the enemy and arranged ourselves in rows. Then Allah's Apostle 
 (p.b.u.h) stood up to lead the prayer and one party stood to pray with
 him while the other faced the enemy. Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and the
 former party bowed and performed two prostrations. Then that party 
 left and took the place of those who had not prayed. Allah's Apostle 
 prayed one Raka (with the latter) and performed two prostrations and 
 finished his prayer with Taslim. Then everyone of them bowed once and 
 performed two prostrations individually.' "
