 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:474</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa:</i></p>
 When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of 
 Al-Walid bin 'Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot
 appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the 
 foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about 
 it till I ('Urwa) said to them, "By Allah, this is not the foot of the
 Prophet but it is the foot of Umar." Aisha narrated that she made a 
 will to 'Abdullah bin Zubair, "Do not bury me with them (the Prophet 
 and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the 
 Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon 
 as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet)."
