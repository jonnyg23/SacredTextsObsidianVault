 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:676</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi':</i></p>
 Ibn 'Umar. said, "I have never missed the touching of these two stones
 of Ka'ba (the Black Stone and the Yemenite Corner) both in the 
 presence and the absence of crowds, since I saw the Prophet touching 
 them." I asked Nafi': "Did Ibn 'Umar use to walk between the two 
 Corners?" Nafi' replied, "He used to walk in order that it might be 
 easy for him to touch it (the Corner Stone)."
