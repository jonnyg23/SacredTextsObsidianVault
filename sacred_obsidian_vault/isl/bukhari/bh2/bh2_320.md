 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:318</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet led us in the 'Asr or the Zuhr prayer and finished it with
 Taslim. Dhul-Yadain said to him, "O Allah's Apostle! Has the prayer 
 been reduced?" The Prophet asked his companions in the affirmative. So
 Allah's Apostle I offered two more Rakat and then performed two 
 prostrations (of Sahu). Sad said, "I saw that 'Ursa bin Az-Zubair had 
 offered two Rakat in the Maghrib prayer and finished it with Taslim. 
 He then talked (and when he was informed about it) he completed the 
 rest of his prayer and performed two prostrations, and said, 'The 
 Prophet prayed like this.' "
