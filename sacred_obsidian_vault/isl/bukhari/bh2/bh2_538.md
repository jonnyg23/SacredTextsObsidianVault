 When Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent Muadh to Yemen, he said (to him), 
 "YOU are going to people of a (Divine) Book. First of all invite them 
 to worship Allah (alone) and when they come to know Allah, inform them
 that Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers in every day and night; 
 and if they start offering these prayers, inform them that Allah has 
 enjoined on them, the Zakat. And it is to be taken from the rich 
 amongst them and given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you 
 in that, take Zakat from them and avoid (don't take) the best property
 of the people as Zakat."
