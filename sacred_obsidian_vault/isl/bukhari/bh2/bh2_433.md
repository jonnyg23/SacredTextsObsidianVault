 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:432</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Allah has made Mecca a sanctuary (sacred place) and
 it was a sanctuary before me and will be so after me. It was made 
 legal for me (to fight in it) for a few hours of the day. None is 
 allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to cut its trees or to chase 
 its game or to pick up its fallen things except by a person who 
 announces it publicly." On that Al-Abbas said (to the Prophet), 
 "Except Al-Idhkhir for our goldsmiths and for our graves." And so the 
 Prophet added, "Except Al-Idhkhir. " And Abu Huraira narrated that the
 Prophet said, "Except Al-Idhkhir for our graves and houses." And Ibn 
 Abbas said, "For their goldsmiths and houses."
