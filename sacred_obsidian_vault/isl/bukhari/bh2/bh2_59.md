 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:60</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</i></p>
 There was a woman amongst us who had a farm and she used to sow Silq 
 (a kind of vegetable) on the edges of streams in her farm. On Fridays 
 she used to pull out the Silq from its roots and put the roots in a 
 utensil. Then she would put a handful of powdered barley over it and 
 cook it. The roots of the Silq were a substitute for meat. After 
 finishing the Jumua prayer we used to greet her and she would give us 
 that food which we would eat with our hands, and because of that meal,
 we used to look forward to Friday.
