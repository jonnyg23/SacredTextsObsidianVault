 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:86</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn  Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "No good deeds done on other days are superior to 
 those done on these (first ten days of Dhul Hijja)." Then some 
 companions of the Prophet said, "Not even Jihad?" He replied, "Not 
 even Jihad, except that of a man who does it by putting himself and 
 his property in danger (for Allah's sake) and does not return with any
 of those things."
