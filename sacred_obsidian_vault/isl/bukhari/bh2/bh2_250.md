 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:251</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik</i></p>
 Once the Prophet (p.b.u.h) entered the Mosque and saw a rope hanging 
 in between its two pillars. He said, "What is this rope?" The people 
 said, "This rope is for Zainab who, when she feels tired, holds it (to
 keep standing for the prayer.)" The Prophet said, "Don't use it. 
 Remove the rope. You should pray as long as you feel active, and when 
 you get tired, sit down."
