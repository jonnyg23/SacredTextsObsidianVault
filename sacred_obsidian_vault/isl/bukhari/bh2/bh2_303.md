 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:301</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of 
 me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand 
 on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of 
 the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. 
 Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow 
 on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then 
 Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."
