 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:660</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 On the Day of Nahr at Mina, the Prophet said, "Tomorrow we shall stay 
 at Khaif Bani Kinana where the pagans had taken the oath of Kufr 
 (heathenism)." He meant (by that place) Al-Muhassab where the Quraish 
 tribe and Bani Kinana concluded a contract against Bani Hashim and 
 Bani 'Abdul-Muttalib or Bani Al-Muttalib that they would not 
 intermarry with them or deal with them in business until they handed 
 over the Prophet to them.
