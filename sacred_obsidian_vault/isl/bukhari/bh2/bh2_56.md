 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:57</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) talked about Friday and said, "There is an

 and asks something from Allah, then Allah will definitely meet his 
 demand." And he (the Prophet) pointed out the shortness of that time 
 with his hands.
