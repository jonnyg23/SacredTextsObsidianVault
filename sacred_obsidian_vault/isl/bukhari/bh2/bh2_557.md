 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:556</h3><p><i>Narrated Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) :</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle distributed something (from the resources of Zakat) 
 amongst a group of people while I was sitting amongst them, but he 
 left a man whom I considered the best of the lot. So, I went up to 
 Allah's Apostle and asked him secretly, "Why have you left that 
 person? By Allah! I consider him a believer." The Prophet said, "Or 
 merely a Muslim (Who surrender to Allah)." I remained quiet for a 
 while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew 
 about him. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person? 
 By Allah! I consider him a believer. " The Prophet said, "Or merely a 
 Muslim." I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my 
 question because of what I knew about him. I said, "O Allah's Apostle!
 Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer." 
 The Prophet said, "Or merely a Muslim." Then Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h)
 said, "I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that
 he may be thrown in the Hell-fire on his face (by renegating from 
 Islam)."
