 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:428</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Uqba bin 'Amir:</i></p>
 One day the Prophet went out and offered the funeral prayers of the 
 martyrs of Uhud and then went up the pulpit and said, "I will pave the
 way for you as your predecessor and will be a witness on you. By 
 Allah! I see my Fount (Kauthar) just now and I have been given the 
 keys of all the treasures of the earth (or the keys of the earth). By 
 Allah! I am not afraid that you will worship others along with Allah 
 after my death, but I am afraid that you will fight with one another 
 for the worldly things."
