 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:808</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim bin Abdullah:</i></p>
 'Abdullah bin 'Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya with seven 
 small pebbles and used to recite Takbir on throwing each stone. He, 
 then, would proceed further till he reached the level ground, where he
 would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while 
 raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta 
 similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he 
 would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while 
 raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-'Aqaba from 
 the middle of the valley, but he would not stay by it. Ibn 'Umar used 
 to say, "I saw Allah's Apostle doing like that."
