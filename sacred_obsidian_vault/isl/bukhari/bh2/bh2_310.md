 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:308</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle sent me for some job and when I had finished it I 
 returned and came to the Prophet and greeted him but he did not return
 my greeting. So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to
 myself,, 'Perhaps Allah's Apostle is angry because I did not come 
 quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even 
 more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he 
 returned the greeting and said, "The thing which prevented me from 
 returning the greeting was that I was praying." And at that time he 
 was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla.
