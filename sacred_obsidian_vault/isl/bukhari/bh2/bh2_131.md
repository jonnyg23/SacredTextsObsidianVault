 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:132</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik</i></p>
 A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Livestock 
 are destroyed and the roads are cut off; so please invoke Allah." So 
 Allah's Apostle prayed for rain and it rained from that Friday till 
 the next Friday. Then a man came to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and said, "O
 Allah's Apostle! The houses have collapsed, roads are cut off and the 
 livestock are destroyed." So Allah's Apostle said, "O Allah ! (Let it 
 rain) on the tops of the mountains, on the plateaus, in the valleys 
 and over the places where trees grow." So the clouds cleared away from
 Medina as clothes are taken off.
