 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:297</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "A woman called her son while he was in his 
 hermitage and said, 'O Juraij' He said, 'O Allah, my mother (is 
 calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer (what shall I do)?' She 
 again said, 'O Juraij!' He said again, 'O Allah ! My mother (is 
 calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer (what shall I do)?' She 
 again said, 'O Juraij' He again said, 'O Allah! My mother (is calling 
 me) and (I am offering) my prayer. (What shall I do?)' She said, 'O 
 Allah! Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.' A
 shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and 
 she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she
 replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his 
 hermitage. Juraij said, 'Where is that woman who claims that her child
 is from me?' (When she was brought to him along with the child), 
 Juraij asked the child, 'O Babus, who is your father?' The child 
 replied, 'The shepherd.' " (See Hadith No 662. Vol 3).
