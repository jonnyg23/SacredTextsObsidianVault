 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:297</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on a 
 Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the 
 curtain of 'Aisha's house, and looked at them as they were standing in
 rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah's 
 Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the 
 Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to 
 see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their 
 prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The 
 Prophet expired on that very day.
