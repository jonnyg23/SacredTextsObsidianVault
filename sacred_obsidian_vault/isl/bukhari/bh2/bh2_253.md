 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:253</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:</i></p>
 The Prophet "Whoever gets up at night and says: -- 'La ilaha il-lallah
 Wahdahu la Sharika lahu Lahu-l-mulk, waLahu-l-hamd wahuwa 'ala 
 kullishai'in Qadir. Alhamdu lil-lahi wa subhanal-lahi wa la-ilaha 
 il-lal-lah wa-l-lahu akbar wa la hawla Wala Quwata il-la-bil-lah.' 
 (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. He is the Only One and
 has no partners . For Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are due 
 for Him. He is Omnipotent. All the praises are for Allah. All the 
 glories are for Allah. And none has the right to be worshipped but 
 Allah, And Allah is Great And there is neither Might nor Power Except 
 with Allah). And then says: -- Allahumma, Ighfir li(O Allah! Forgive 
 me). Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to and if he performs 
 ablution (and prays), his prayer will be accepted."
