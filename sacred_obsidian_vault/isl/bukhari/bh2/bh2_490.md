 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:489</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais:</i></p>
 While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man with very 
 rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, 
 greeted us and said, "Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will
 be heated in the Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their 
 breasts till it comes out from the bones of their shoulders and then 
 put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the nipples 
 of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting." After saying 
 that, the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I 
 followed him and sat beside him, and I did not know who he was. I said
 to him, "I think the people disliked what you had said." He said, 
 "These people do not understand anything, although my friend told me."
 I asked, "Who is your friend?" He said, "The Prophet said (to me), 'O 
 Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?' And on that I (Abu Dhar) 
 started looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day 
 as I thought that Allah's Apostle wanted to send me to do something 
 for him and I said, 'Yes!' He said, 'I do not love to have gold equal 
 to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah's cause) 
 except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and 
 collect worldly wealth. No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly 
 benefits nor am I in need of their religious advice till I meet Allah,
 The Honorable, The Majestic." '
