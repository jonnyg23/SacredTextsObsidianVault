 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:730</h3><p><i>Narrated Usama bin Zaid</i></p>
 rode behind Allah's Apostle from 'Arafat and when Allah's Apostle 
 reached the mountain pass on the left side which is before 
 Al-Muzdalifa he made his camel kneel and then urinated, and then I 
 poured water for his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I 
 said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Apostle!" He 
 replied, "The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at 
 Al-Muzdalifa)." So Allah's Apostle rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa 
 and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th 
 Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin Abbas) rode behind Allah's Apostle. Kuraib, 
 (a sub-narrator) said that 'Abdullah bin Abbas narrated from Al-Fadl, 
 "Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) kept on reciting Talbiya (during the 
 journey) till he reached the Jamra." (Jamrat-al-Aqaba)
