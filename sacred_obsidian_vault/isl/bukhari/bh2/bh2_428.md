 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:427</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet collected every two martyrs of Uhud in one piece of cloth,
 then he would ask, "Which of them had (knew) more of the Quran?" When 
 one of them was pointed out for him, he would put that one first in 
 the grave and say, "I will be a witness on these on the Day of 
 Resurrection." He ordered them to be buried with their blood on their 
 bodies and they were neither washed nor was a funeral prayer offered 
 for them.
