 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:492</h3><p><i>Narrated Haritha bin Wahab :</i></p>
 I heard the Prophet saying, "O people! Give in charity as a time will 
 come upon you when a person will wander about with his object of 
 charity and will not find anybody to accept it, and one (who will be 
 requested to take it) will say, "If you had brought it yesterday, 
 would have taken it, but to-day I am not in need of it."
