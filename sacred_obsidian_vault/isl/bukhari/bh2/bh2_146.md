 (The Prophet) said, "O Allah! Bless our Sham and our Yemen." People 
 said, "Our Najd as well." The Prophet again said, "O Allah! Bless our 
 Sham and Yemen." They said again, "Our Najd as well." On that the 
 Prophet said, "There will appear earthquakes and afflictions, and from
 there will come out the side of the head of Satan."
