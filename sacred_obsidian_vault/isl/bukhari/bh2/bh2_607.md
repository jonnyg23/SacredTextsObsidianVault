 The Prophet (p.b.u.h) fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people 
 of Medina, Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham, Qarn-ul-Manazil for the 
 people of Najd, and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these 
 Mawaqit are for those living at those very places, and besides them 
 for those whom come through them with the intention of performing Hajj
 and Umra; and whoever is living within these Mawaqit should assume 
 lhram from where he starts, and the people of Mecca can assume Ihram 
 from Mecca.
