 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:66</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn  Abbas:</i></p>
 Once the Prophet (p.b.u.h) led the fear prayer and the people stood 
 behind him. He said Takbir (Allahu-Akbar) and the people said the 
 same. He bowed and some of them bowed. Then he prostrated and they 
 also prostrated. Then he stood for the second Raka and those who had 
 prayed the first Raka left and guarded their brothers. The second 
 party joined him and performed bowing and prostration with him. All 
 the people were in prayer but they were guarding one another during 
 the prayer.
