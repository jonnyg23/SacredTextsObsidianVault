 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:654</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka'ba) was part of 
 the Ka'ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, 
 "What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the 
 building of the Ka'ba?" He said, "Don't you see that your people 
 (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the 
 building of Ka'ba)?" I asked, "What about its gate? Why is it so 
 high?" He replied, "Your people did this so as to admit into it 
 whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people 
 not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have 
 recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike
 it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the 
 building of the Ka'ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level 
 of the ground."
