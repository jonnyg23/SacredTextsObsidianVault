 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:288</h3><p><i>Narrated Qaza'a Maula:</i></p>
 (freed slave of) Ziyad: I heard Abu Said Al-khudri narrating four 
 things from the Prophet and I appreciated them very much. He said, 
 conveying the words of the Prophet. 
 <p>
 (1) "A woman should not go on a two day journey except with her 
 husband or a Dhi-Mahram. 
 </p><p>
 (2) No fasting is permissible on two days: 'Id-ul-Fitr and 
 'Id-ul-Adha. 
 </p><p>
 (3) No prayer after two prayers, i.e. after the Fajr prayer till the 
 sunrises and after the 'Asr prayer till the sun sets. 
 </p><p>
 (4) Do not prepare yourself for a journey except to three Mosques, 
 i.e. Al-Masjid-AI-Haram, the Mosque of Aqsa (Jerusalem) and my 
 Mosque."
