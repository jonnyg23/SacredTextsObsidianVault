 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:396</h3><p><i>Narrated Said Al-Maqburi:</i></p>
 That his father said, "While we were accompanying a funeral 
 procession, Abu Huraira got hold of the hand of Marwan and they sat 
 down before the coffin was put down. Then Abu Said came and took hold 
 of Marwan's hand and said, "Get up. By Allah, no doubt this (i.e. Abu 
 Huraira) knows that the Prophet forbade us to do that." Abu Huraira 
 said, "He (Abu Said) has spoken the truth."
