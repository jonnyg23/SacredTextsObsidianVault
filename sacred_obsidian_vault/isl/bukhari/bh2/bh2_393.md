 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:392</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 When the news of the martyrdom of Zaid bin Haritha, Ja'far and 
 'Abdullah bin Rawaha came, the Prophet sat down looking sad, and I was
 looking through the chink of the door. A man came and said, "O Allah's
 Apostle! The women of Ja'far," and then he mentioned their crying . 
 The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered h im to stop them from crying. The man 
 went and came back and said, "I tried to stop them but they 
 disobeyed." The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered him for the second time to 
 forbid them. He went again and came back and said, "They did not 
 listen to me, (or "us": the sub-narrator Muhammad bin Haushab is in 
 doubt as to which is right). " ('Aisha added: The Prophet said, "Put 
 dust in their mouths." I said (to that man), "May Allah stick your 
 nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you)." By Allah, you could not (stop 
 the women from crying) to fulfill the order, besides you did not 
 relieve Allah's Apostle from fatigue."
