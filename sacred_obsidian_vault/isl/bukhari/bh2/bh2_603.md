 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:601</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas :</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle had fixed Dhul Hulaifa as the Mlqat for the people of 
 Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; and Qarn Ul-Manazil for the 
 people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. So, these (above
 mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and 
 besides them for those who come through those places with the 
 intention of performing Hajj and 'Umra and whoever lives within these 
 places should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the 
 people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.
