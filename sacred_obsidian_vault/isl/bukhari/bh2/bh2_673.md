 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:671</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 When Allah's Apostle came to Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka'ba with
 idols in it. He ordered (idols to be taken out). So they were taken 
 out. The people took out the pictures of Abraham and Ishmael holding 
 Azlams in their hands. Allah's Apostle said, "May Allah curse these 
 people. By Allah, both Abraham and Ishmael never did the game of 
 chance with Azlams." Then he entered the Ka'ba and said Takbir at its 
 corners but did not offer the prayer in it.
