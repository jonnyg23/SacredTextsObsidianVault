 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:747</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Jamra:</i></p>
 I asked Ibn Abbas about Hajj-at-Tamattu'. He ordered me to perform it.
 I asked him about the Hadi (sacrifice). He said, "You have to 
 slaughter a camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hadi with 
 the others." It seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu).
 I slept and dreamt as if a person was announcing: "Hajj Mabrur and 
 accepted Mut'ah (Hajj-At-Tamattu')" I went to Ibn Abbas and narrated 
 it to him. He said, "Allah is Greater. (That was) the tradition of Abu
 was. "An accepted 'Umra and Hajj-Mabrur. "
