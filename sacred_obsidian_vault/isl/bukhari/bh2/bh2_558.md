 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:557</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "The poor person is not the one who goes round 
 the people and ask them for a mouthful or two (of meals) or a date or

 needs and whose condition is not known to others, that others may give
 him something in charity, and who does not beg of people."
