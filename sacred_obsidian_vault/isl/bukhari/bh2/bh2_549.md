 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:548</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 Some Ansari persons asked for (something) from Allah's Apostle 
 (p.b.u.h) and he gave them. They again asked him for (something) and 
 he again gave them. And then they asked him and he gave them again 
 till all that was with him finished. And then he said "If I had 
 anything. I would not keep it away from you. (Remember) Whoever 
 abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and 
 whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him 
 self-sufficient. And whoever remains patient, Allah will make him 
 patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater than 
 patience."
