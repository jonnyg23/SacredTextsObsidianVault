 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:778</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amra:</i></p>
 I heard 'Aisha saying, "We set out (from Medina) along with Allah's 
 Apostle five days before the end of Dhul-Qa'da with the intention of 
 performing Hajj only. When we approached Mecca, Allah's Apostle 
 ordered those who had no Hadi along with them to finish the lhram 
 after performing Tawaf of the Ka'ba, (Safa and Marwa). 'Aisha added, 
 "Beef was brought to us on the Day of Nahr and I said, 'What is this?'
 Somebody said, 'The Prophet has slaughtered (cows) on behalf of his 
 wives.' "
