 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:229</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers:</i></p>
 One night Allah's Apostle offered the prayer in the Mosque and the 
 people followed him. The next night he also offered the prayer and too
 many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights more people 
 gathered, but Allah's Apostle did not come out to them. In the morning
 he said, "I saw what you were doing and nothing but the fear that it 
 (i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped me from coming to 
 you." And that happened in the month of Ramadan.
