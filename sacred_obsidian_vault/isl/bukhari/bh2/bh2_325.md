 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:323</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "When the call for prayer is made, Satan takes 
 to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when 
 the call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqama is pronounced, 
 Satan again takes to his heels, and when the Iqama is finished he 
 comes back again and tries to interfere with the person and his 
 thoughts and say, "Remember this and that (which he has not thought of
 before the prayer)", till the praying person forgets how much he has 
 prayed. If anyone of you does not remember whether he has offered 
 three or four Rakat then he should perform two prostrations of Sahu 
 while sitting.
