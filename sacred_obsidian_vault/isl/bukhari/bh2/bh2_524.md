 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:523</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira :</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The example of a miser and an alms-giver is like 
 the example of two persons wearing iron cloaks." Allah's Apostle also 
 said, "The example of an alms-giver and a miser is like the example of
 two persons who have two iron cloaks on them from their breasts to 
 their collar bones, and when the alms-giver wants to give in charity, 
 the cloak becomes capacious till it covers his whole body to such an 
 extent that it hides his fingertips and covers his footprints 
 (obliterates his tracks). (1) And when the miser wants to spend, it 
 (the iron cloak) sticks and every ring gets stuck to its place and he 
 tries to widen it, but it did not become wide.
