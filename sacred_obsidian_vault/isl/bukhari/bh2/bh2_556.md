 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:555</h3><p><i>Narrated Ash-sha'bi:</i></p>
 The clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba narrated, "Muawiya wrote to 
 Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba: Write to me something which you have heard from
 the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ." So Al-Mughira wrote: I heard the Prophet 
 saying, "Allah has hated for you three things: 
 <p>
 1. Vain talks, (useless talk) that you talk too much or about others. 
 </p><p>
 2. Wasting of wealth (by extravagance) 
 </p><p>
 3. And asking too many questions (in disputed religious matters) or 
 asking others for something (except in great need). (See Hadith No. 
 591, Vol. Ill)
