 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:113</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Yasar:</i></p>
 I was going to Mecca in the company of 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and when I 
 apprehended the approaching dawn, I dismounted and offered the Witr 
 prayer and then joined him. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "Where have you 
 been?" I replied, "I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted 
 and prayed the Witr prayer." 'Abdullah said, "Isn't it sufficient for 
 you to follow the good example of Allah's Apostle?" I replied, "Yes, 
 by Allah." He said, "Allah's Apostle used to pray Witr on the back of 
 the camel (while on a journey)."
