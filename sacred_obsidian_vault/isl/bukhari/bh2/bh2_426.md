 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:425</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 When the Prophet became ill, some of his wives talked about a church 
 which they had seen in Ethiopia and it was called Mariya. Um Salma and
 Um Habiba had been to Ethiopia, and both of them narrated its (the 
 Church's) beauty and the pictures it contained. The Prophet raised his
 head and said, "Those are the people who, whenever a pious man dies 
 amongst them, make a place of worship at his grave and then they make 
 those pictures in it. Those are the worst creatures in the Sight of 
 Allah."
