 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:571</h3><p><i>Narrated Um 'Atiyya Al-Ansariya :</i></p>
 The Prophet went to 'Aisha and asked her whether she had something (to
 eat). She replied that she had nothing except the mutton (piece) which
 Nusaiba (Um 'Atiyya) had sent to us (Buraira) in charity." The Prophet
 said, "It has reached its place and now it is not a thing of charity 
 but a gift for us."
