 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:690</h3><p><i>Narrated Amr:</i></p>
 We asked Ibn Umar: "May a man have sexual relations with his wife 
 during the Umra before performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?" He 
 said, "Allah's Apostle arrived (in Mecca) and circumambulated the Kaba
 seven times, then offered two Rakat behind Maqam Ibrahim (the station 
 of Abraham), then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." Ibn Umar 
 added, "Verily! In Allah's Apostle you have a good example." And I 
 asked Jabir bin Abdullah (the same question), and he replied, "You 
 should not go near your wives (have sexual relations) till you have 
 finished Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. "
