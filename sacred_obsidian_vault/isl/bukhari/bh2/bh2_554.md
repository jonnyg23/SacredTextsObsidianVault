 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:553</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "A man keeps on asking others for something till he 
 comes on the Day of Resurrection without any piece of flesh on his 
 face." The Prophet added, "On the Day of Resurrection, the Sun will 
 come near (to, the people) to such an extent that the sweat will reach
 up to the middle of the ears, so, when all the people are in that 
 state, they will ask Adam for help, and then Moses, and then Muhammad 
 (p.b.u.h) ." The sub-narrator added "Muhammad will intercede with 
 Allah to judge amongst the people. He will proceed on till he will 
 hold the ring of the door (of Paradise) and then Allah will exalt him 
 to Maqam Mahmud (the privilege of intercession, etc.). And all the 
 people of the gathering will send their praises to Allah.
