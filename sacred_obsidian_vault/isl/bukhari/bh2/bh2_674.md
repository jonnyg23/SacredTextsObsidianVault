 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:672</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 When Allah's Apostle and his companions came to Mecca, the pagans 
 circulated the news that a group of people were coming to them and 
 they had been weakened by the Fever of Yathrib (Medina). So the 
 Prophet ordered his companions to do Ramal in the first three rounds 
 of Tawaf of the Ka'ba and to walk between the two corners (The Black 
 Stone and Yemenite corner). The Prophet did not order them to do Ramal
 in all the rounds of Tawaf out of pity for them.
