 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:154</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha :</i></p>
 In the life-time of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he 
 led the people in prayer, and stood up and performed a long Qiyam, 
 then bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed a long 
 Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first.
 He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he
 prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the 
 second Raka as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by 
 then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) 
 and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, "The sun and the moon
 are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the 
 death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah 
 and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa." The Prophet then said, "O 
 followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira 
 (self-respect) than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or
 female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of 
 Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you would laugh 
 little and weep much.
