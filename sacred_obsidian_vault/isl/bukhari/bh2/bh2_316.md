 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:314</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 People say that I narrate too many narrations of the Prophet; once I 
 met a man (during the life-time of the Prophet) and asked him, "Which 
 Sura did Allah's Apostle s recite yesterday in the 'Isha' prayer?" He 
 said, "I do not know." I said, "Did you not attend the prayer?" He 
 said, "Yes, (I did)." I said, "I know. He recited such and such Sura."
