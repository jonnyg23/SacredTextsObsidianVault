 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:215</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) fell down from a horse and his right side 
 was either injured or scratched, so we went to inquire about his 
 health. The time for the prayer became due and he offered the prayer 
 while sitting and we prayed while standing. He said, "The Imam is to 
 be followed; so if he says Takbir, you should also say Takbir, and if 
 he bows you should also bow; and when he lifts his head you should 
 also do the same and if he says: Sami'a-l-lahu Liman Hamidah (Allah 
 hears whoever sends his praises to Him) you should say: Rabbana 
 walakal-Hamd (O our Lord! All the praises are for You.") (See 
 Hadith No. 656 Vol. 1).
