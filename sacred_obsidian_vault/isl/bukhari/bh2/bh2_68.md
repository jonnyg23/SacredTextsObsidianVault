 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:69</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin  Umar:</i></p>
 Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah's Apostle 
 and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it 
 during the 'Id and when the delegations visit you." Allah's Apostle 
 (p.b.u.h) replied, "This dress is for those who have no share (in the 
 Hereafter)." After a long period Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to  
 Umar a cloak of silk brocade.  Umar came to Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) 
 with the cloak and said, "O Allah's Apostle! You said that this dress 
 was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent 
 me this cloak." Allah's Apostle said to him, "Sell it and fulfill your
 needs by it."
