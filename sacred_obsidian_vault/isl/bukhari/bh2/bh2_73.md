 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:74</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the 'Id 
 prayer, should slaughter again." A man stood up and said, "This is the
 day on which one has desire for meat," and he mentioned something 
 about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then 
 the same man added, "I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me 
 than the meat of two sheep." The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it
 as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only 
 for him or for others as well.
