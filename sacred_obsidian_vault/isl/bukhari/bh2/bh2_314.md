 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:312</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Uqba bin Al-Harith:</i></p>
 I offered the 'Asr prayer with the Prophet and after finishing the 
 prayer with Taslim he got up quickly and went to some of his wives and
 then came out. He noticed the signs of astonishment on the faces of 
 the people caused by his speed. He then said, "I remembered while I 
 was in my prayer that a piece of gold was Lying in my house and I 
 disliked that it should remain with us throughout the night, and so I 
 have ordered it to be distributed."
