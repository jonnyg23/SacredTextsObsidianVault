 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:331</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle ordered us to do seven things and forbade us to do 
 other seven. He ordered us: 
 <p>
 to follow the funeral procession. to visit the sick, to accept 
 invitations, to help the oppressed, to fulfill the oaths, to return 
 the greeting and to reply to the sneezer: (saying, "May Allah be 
 merciful on you," provided the sneezer says, "All the praises are for 
 Allah,"). He forbade us to use silver utensils and dishes and to wear 
 golden rings, silk (clothes), Dibaj (pure silk cloth), Qissi and 
 Istabraq (two kinds of silk cloths).
