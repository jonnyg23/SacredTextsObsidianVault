 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:270</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amr:</i></p>
 I heard Abu Ash-sha'tha' Jabir saying, "I heard Ibn Abbas saying, 'I 
 offered with Allah's Apostle eight Rakat (of Zuhr and 'Asr prayers) 
 together and seven Rakat (the Maghrib and the 'Isha' prayers) 
 together.' " I said, "O Abu Ash-shatha! I think he must have prayed 
 the Zuhr late and the 'Asr early; the 'Isha early and the Maghrib 
 late." Abu Ash-sha'tha' said, "I also think so." (See 
 Hadith No. 518 Vol. 1).
