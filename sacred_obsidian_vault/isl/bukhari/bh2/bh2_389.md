 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:388</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 One of the sons of Abu Talha became sick and died and Abu Talha at 
 that time was not at home. When his wife saw that he was dead, she 
 prepared him (washed and shrouded him) and placed him somewhere in the
 house. When Abu Talha came, he asked, "How is the boy?" She said, "The
 child is quiet and I hope he is in peace." Abu Talha thought that she 
 had spoken the truth. Abu Talha passed the night and in the morning 
 took a bath and when he intended to go out, she told him that his son 
 had died, Abu Talha offered the (morning) prayer with the Prophet and 
 informed the Prophet of what happened to them. Allah's Apostle said, 
 "May Allah bless you concerning your night. (That is, may Allah bless 
 you with good offspring)." Sufyan said, "One of the Ansar said, 'They 
 (i.e. Abu Talha and his wife) had nine sons and all of them became 
 reciters of the Quran (by heart).' "
