 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:529</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas :</i></p>
 I am a witness that Allah's Apostle offered the Id prayer before 
 delivering the sermon and then he thought that the women would not be 
 able to hear him (because of the distance), so he went to them along 
 with Bilal who was spreading his garment. The Prophet advised and 
 ordered them to give in charity. So the women started giving their 
 ornaments (in charity). (The sub-narrator Aiyub pointed towards his 
 ears and neck meaning that they gave ornaments from those places such 
 as ear-rings and necklaces.)
