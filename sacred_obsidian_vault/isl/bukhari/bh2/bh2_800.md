 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:798</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 At Mina, the Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Do you know what is the day 
 today?" The people replied, "Allah and His Apostle know it better." He
 said, "It is the forbidden (sacred) day. And do you know what town is 
 this?" They replied, "Allah and His Apostle know it better." He said, 
 "This is the forbidden (Sacred) town (Mecca). And do you know which 
 month is this?" The people replied, "Allah and His Apostle know it 
 better." He said, "This is the forbidden (sacred) month." The Prophet 
 added, "No doubt, Allah made your blood, your properties, and your 
 honor sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in 
 Day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijja), the Prophet stood in between the 
 Jamrat during his Hajj which he performed (as in the previous Hadith) 
 and said, "This is the greatest Day (i.e. 10th of Dhul-Hijjah)." The 
 Prophet started saying repeatedly, "O Allah! Be Witness (I have 
 conveyed Your Message)." He then bade the people farewell. The people 
 said, "This is Hajjat-al-Wada)."
