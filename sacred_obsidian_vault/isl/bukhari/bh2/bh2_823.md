 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:821</h3><p><i>Narrated Khalid bin Al-Harith:</i></p>
 'Ubaidullah was asked about Al Mahassab. 'Ubaidullah narrated: Nafi' 
 said, 'Allah's Apostles, 'Umar and Ibn 'Umar camped there." Nafi' 
 added, "Ibn 'Umar used to offer the Zuhr and 'Asr prayers at it (i.e. 
 Al-Mahassab)." I think he mentioned the Maghrib prayer also. I said, 
 "I don't doubt about 'Isha' (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and
 he used to sleep there for a while. He used to say, 'The Prophet used 
 to do the same.' "
