 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:772</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas :</i></p>
 The Prophet offered four Rakat of Zuhr prayer at Medina; and two Rakat
 of 'Asr prayer at Dhul-hulaifa and spent the night there and when (the
 day) dawned, he mounted his Mount and started saying, "None has the 
 right to be worshipped but Allah, and Glorified be Allah." When he 
 reached Al-Baida' he recited Talbiya for both Hajj and 'Umra. And when
 he arrived at Mecca, he ordered them (his companions) to finish their 
 Ihram. The Prophet slaughtered seven Budn (camel) with his own hands 
 while the camels were standing He also sacrificed two horned rams 
 (black and white in color) at Medina.
