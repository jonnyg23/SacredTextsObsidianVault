 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:51</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "When it is a Friday, the angels stand at the gate 
 of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons coming to 
 the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of 
 the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one 
 offering a camel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one 
 offering a cow and then a ram and then a chicken and then an egg 
 respectively. When the Imam comes out (for Jumua prayer) they (i.e. 
 angels) fold their papers and listen to the Khutba."
