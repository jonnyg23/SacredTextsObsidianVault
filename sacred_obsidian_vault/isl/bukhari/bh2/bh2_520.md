 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:519</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa :</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "An honest Muslim store-keeper who carries out the 
 orders of his master and pays fully what he has been ordered to give 
 with a good heart and pays to that person to whom he was ordered to 
 pay, is regarded as one of the two charitable persons."
