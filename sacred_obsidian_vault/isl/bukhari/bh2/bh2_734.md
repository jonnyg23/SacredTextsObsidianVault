 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:732</h3><p><i>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle proceeded from 'Arafat and dismounted at the 
 mountainous pass and then urinated and performed a light ablution. I 
 said to him, "(Shall we offer) the prayer?" He replied, "The prayer is
 ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)." When he came to Al-Muzdalifa, he
 performed a perfect ablution. Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced
 and he offended the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his 
 camel kneel at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced
 and he offered the ('Isha') prayer and he did not offer any prayer in 
 between them (i.e. Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers).
