 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:807</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya (the Jamra near to 
 the Khaif mosque) with seven small stones and used to recite Takbir on
 throwing every pebble. He then would go ahead till he reached the 
 level ground where he would stand facing the Qibla for a long time to 
 invoke (Allah) while raising his hands (while invoking). Then he would
 do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta (middle Jamra) and then he would go to 
 the left towards the middle ground, where he would stand facing the 
 Qibla. He would remain standing there for a long period to invoke 
 (Allah) while raising his hands, and would stand there for a long 
 period. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Aqaba from the middle 
 of the valley, but he would not stay by it, and then he would leave 
 and say, "I saw the Prophet doing like this."
