 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:710</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Asim:</i></p>
 I asked Anas bin Malik: "Did you use to dislike to perform Tawaf 
 between Safa and Marwa?" He said, "Yes, as it was of the ceremonies of
 the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, till Allah revealed: 
 'Verily! (The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the 
 symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the 
 pilgrimage to the Ka'ba, or performs 'Umra, to perform Tawaf between 
 them.' " (2.158)
