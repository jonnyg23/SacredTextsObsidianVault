 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:599</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) made Dhul-Huiaifa as the Miqat for the 
 people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; Qarn-al-Manazil for
 the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these 
 Mawaqit are for the people at those very places, and besides them for 
 those who come thorough those places with the intention of performing 
 Hajj and 'Umra; and whoever is living within these boundaries can 
 assume lhram from the place he starts, and the people of Mecca can 
 assume Ihram from Mecca.
