 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:469</h3><p><i>Narrated Hisham's father:</i></p>
 Aisha said, "I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he 
 asked me, 'In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?' She 
 replied, 'In three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there
 was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked 
 her, 'On which day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on 
 Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He
 added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.'
 Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and
 it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of 
 mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This 
 is worn out.' He said, 'A living person has more right to wear new 
 clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body's pus.' He 
 did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the
 morning."
