 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:539</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Dhar:</i></p>
 Once I went to him (the Prophet ) and he said, "By Allah in Whose 
 Hands my life is (or probably said, 'By Allah, except Whom none has 
 the right to be worshipped) whoever had camels or cows or sheep and 
 did not pay their Zakat, those animals will be brought on the Day of 
 Resurrection far bigger and fatter than before and they will tread him
 under their hooves, and will butt him with their horns, and (those 
 animals will come in circle): When the last does its turn, the first 
 will start again, and this punishment will go on till Allah has 
 finished the judgments amongst the people."
