 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:703</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi':</i></p>
 'Abdullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and his riding animal entered the 
 house of Ibn 'Umar. He (the son of Ibn 'Umar) said, "I fear that this 
 year a battle might take place between the people and you might be 
 prevented from going to the Ka'ba. I suggest that you should stay 
 here." Ibn Umar said, "Once Allah's Apostle set out for the 
 pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the 
 Ka'ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka'ba, I would 
 do the same as Allah's Apostle had done . . . "Verily, in Allah's 
 Apostle you have a good example." Then he added, "I make you a witness
 that I have intended to perform Hajj along with 'Umra." After arriving
 at Mecca, Ibn 'Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).
