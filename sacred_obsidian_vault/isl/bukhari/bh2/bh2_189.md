 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:190</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdur Rahman bin Yazid:</i></p>
 We offered a four Rakat prayer at Mina behind Ibn 'Affan . 'Abdullah 
 bin Masud was informed about it. He said sadly, "Truly to Allah we 
 belong and truly to Him we shall return." And added, "I prayed two 
 Rakat with Allah's Apostle at Mina and similarly with Abu Bakr and 
 with 'Umar (during their caliphates)." He further said, "May I be 
 lucky enough to have two of the four Rakat accepted (by Allah)."
