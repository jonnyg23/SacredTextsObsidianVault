 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:767</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amra bint 'AbdurRahman:</i></p>
 I heard 'Aisha saying, "Five days before the end of Dhul-Qa'ada we set
 out from Medina in the company of Allah's Apostle with the intention 
 of performing Hajj only. When we approached Mecca, Allah's Apostle 
 ordered those who had no Hadi with them to finish their lhram after 
 performing Tawaf of the Ka'ba and (Sa'i) and between Safa and Marwa." 
 'Aisha added, "On the day of Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifice) beef was
 brought to us. I asked, 'What is this?' The reply was, 'Allah's 
 Apostle (p.b.u.h) has slaughtered (sacrifices) on behalf of his 
 wives.' "
