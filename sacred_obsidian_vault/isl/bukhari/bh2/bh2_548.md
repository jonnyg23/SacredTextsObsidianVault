 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:547</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered (a person) to collect Zakat, and 
 that person returned and told him that Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid,
 and Abbas bin 'Abdul Muttalib had refused to give Zakat." The Prophet 
 said, "What made Ibn Jamll refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor 
 man, and was made wealthy by Allah and His Apostle ? But you are 
 unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping his armor for 
 Allah's Cause (for Jihad). As for Abbas bin 'Abdul Muttalib, he is the
 uncle of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and 
 he should pay it double."
