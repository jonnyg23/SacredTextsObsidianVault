 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:782</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa:</i></p>
 came upon Allah's Apostle when he was at Al-Bat-ha. He asked me, "Have
 you intended to perform the Hajj?" I replied in the affirmative. He 
 asked, "For what have you assumed lhram?" I replied," I have assumed 
 Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet ." The Prophet 
 said, "You have done well! Go and perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba and 
 between Safa and Marwa." Then I went to one of the women of Bani Qais 
 and she took out lice from my head. Later, I assumed the Ihram for 
 Hajj. So, I used to give this verdict to the people till the caliphate
 of 'Umar. When I told him about it, he said, "If we take (follow) the 
 Holy Book, then it orders us to complete Hajj and 'Umra 
 (Hajj-at-Tamattu') and if we follow the tradition of Allah's Apostle 
 then Allah's Apostle did not finish his lhram till the Hadi had 
 reached its destination (had been slaughtered). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). 
 (See Hadith No. 630)
