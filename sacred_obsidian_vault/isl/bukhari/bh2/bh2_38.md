 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:39</h3><p><i>Narrated Az-Zuhri:</i></p>
 I heard As-Saib bin Yazid, saying, "In the life-time of Allah's 
 Apostle, and Abu Bakr and  Umar, the Adhan for the Jumua prayer used 
 to be pronounced after the Imam had taken his seat on the pulpit. But 
 when the people increased in number during the caliphate of 'Uthman, 
 he introduced a third Adhan (on Friday for the Jumua prayer) and it 
 was pronounced at Az-Zaura' and that new state of affairs remained so 
 in the succeeding years.
