 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:558</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "No doubt, it is better for a person to take a rope 
 and proceed in the morning to the mountains and cut the wood and then 
 sell it, and eat from this income and give alms from it than to ask 
 others for something."
