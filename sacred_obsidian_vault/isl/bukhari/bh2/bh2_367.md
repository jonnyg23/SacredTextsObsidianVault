 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:366</h3><p><i>Narrated Khabbab:</i></p>
 We emigrated with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) in Allah's cause, and so our 
 reward was then surely incumbent on Allah. Some of us died and they 
 did not take anything from their rewards in this world, and amongst 
 them was Mustab bin 'Umar; and the others were those who got their 
 rewards. Mustab bin 'Umar was martyred on the day of the Battle of 
 Uhud and we could get nothing except his Burd to shroud him in. And 
 when we covered his head his feet became bare and vice versa. So the 
 Prophet ordered us to cover his head only and to put idhkhir (a kind 
 of shrub) over his feet.
