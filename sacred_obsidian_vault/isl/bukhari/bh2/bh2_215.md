 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:216</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Imran bin Husain:</i></p>
 (who had piles) I asked Allah's Apostle about the praying of a man 
 while sitting. He said, "If he prays while standing it is better and 
 he who prays while sitting gets half the reward of that who prays 
 standing; and whoever prays while Lying gets half the reward of that 
 who prays while sitting."
