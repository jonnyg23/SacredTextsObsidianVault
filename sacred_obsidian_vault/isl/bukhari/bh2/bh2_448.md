 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:447</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab :</i></p>
 When 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul died, Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was 
 called upon to offer his funeral prayer. When Allah's Apostle stood up
 to offer the prayer, I got up quickly and said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
 Are you going to pray for Ibn Ubai and he said so and so on such and 
 such occasions?" And started mentioning all that he had said. Allah's 
 Apostle smiled and said, "O 'Umar! Go away from me." When I talked too
 much he said, "I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to 
 offer the prayer). Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for
 Allah's forgiveness for more than seventy times, surely I would have 
 done so." ('Umar added): Allah's Apostle offered his funeral prayer 
 and returned and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara' 
 were revealed: i.e. "And never (O Muhammad) pray for any of them who 
 dies . . . (to the end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)" -- ('Umar 
 added), "Later I astonished at my daring before Allah's Apostle on 
 that day. And Allah and His Apostle know better."
