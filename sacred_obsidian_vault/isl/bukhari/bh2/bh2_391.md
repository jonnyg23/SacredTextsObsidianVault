 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:390</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 We went with Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) to the blacksmith Abu Saif, and
 he was the husband of the wet-nurse of Ibrahim (the son of the 
 Prophet). Allah's Apostle took Ibrahim and kissed him and smelled him 
 and later we entered Abu Saif's house and at that time Ibrahim was in 
 his last breaths, and the eyes of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) started 
 shedding tears. 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf said, "O Allah's Apostle, even 
 you are weeping!" He said, "O Ibn 'Auf, this is mercy." Then he wept 
 more and said, "The eyes are shedding tears and the heart is grieved, 
 and we will not say except what pleases our Lord, O Ibrahim ! Indeed 
 we are grieved by your separation."
