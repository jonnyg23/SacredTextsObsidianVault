 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:603</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim bin 'Abdullah from his father:</i></p>
 I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "The Miqat for the people of Medina is
 Dhul-Hulaifa; for the people of Sham is Mahita; (i.e. Al-Juhfa); and 
 for the people of Najd is Qarn. And said Ibn 'Umar, "They claim, but I
 did not hear personally, that the Prophet said, "The Miqat for the 
 people of Yemen is Yalamlam."
