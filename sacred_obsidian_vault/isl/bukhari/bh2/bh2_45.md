 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:46</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 Once in the middle of the night Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out and
 prayed in the mosque and some men prayed with him. The next morning 
 the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with 
 him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, 
 and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. 
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the 
 fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could 
 not accommodate them. Allah's Apostle came out only for the Fajr 
 prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and 
 recited "Tashah-hud" (I testify that none has the right to be 
 worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle), and then said,
 "Amma ba'du. Verily your presence (in the mosque at night) was not 
 hidden from me, but I was afraid that this prayer (Prayer of Tahajjud)
 might be made compulsory and you might not be able to carry it out."
