 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:708</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amr bin Dinar:</i></p>
 We asked Ibn 'Umar whether a man who, while performing 'Umra, had 
 performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between 
 Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn 'Umar 
 replied "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) reached Mecca and performed the seven 
 rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka'ba and then offered a two-Rakat prayer 
 behind Maqam ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) 
 between Safa and Marwa." He added, "Verily! In Allah's Apostle 
 (p.b.u.h) you have a good example." We asked Jabir bin 'Abdullah (the 
 same question) and he said, "He (that man) should not come near (his 
 wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."
