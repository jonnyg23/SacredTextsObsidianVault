 While Umar bin Al-Khattab was standing and delivering the sermon on a 
 Friday, one of the companions of the Prophet, who was one of the 
 foremost Muhajirs (emigrants) came. 'Umar said to him, "What is the 
 time now?" He replied, "I was busy and could not go back to my house 
 till I heard the Adhan. I did not perform more than the ablution." 
 Thereupon 'Umar said to him, "Did you perform only the ablution 
 although you know that Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) used to order us to 
 take a bath (on Fridays)?"
