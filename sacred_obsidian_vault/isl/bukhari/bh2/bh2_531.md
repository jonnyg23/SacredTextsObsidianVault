 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:530</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Abu Bakr wrote to me what was made compulsory by Allah's Apostle and 
 that was (regarding the payments of Zakat): Neither the property of 
 different people may be taken together nor the joint property may be 
 split for fear of (paying more, or receiving less) Zakat. (1)
