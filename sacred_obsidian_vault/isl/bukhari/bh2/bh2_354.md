 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:353</h3><p><i>Narrated Um 'Atiyya:</i></p>
 One of the daughters of the Prophet expired and he came to us and 
 said, "Wash her with Sidr (water) for odd number of times, i.e. three,
 five or more, if you think it necessary, and in the last, put camphor 
 or (some camphor on her), and when you finish, notify me." So when we 
 finished we informed him. He gave his waist-sheet to us (to shroud 
 her). We entwined the hair (of the deceased girl) in three braids and 
 made them fall at her back.
