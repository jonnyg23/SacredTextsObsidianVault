 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:103</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa on the authority of 'Aisha:</i></p>
 On the days of Mina, (11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah) Abu Bakr 
 came to her while two young girls were beating the tambourine and the 
 Prophet was lying covered with his clothes. Abu Bakr scolded them and 
 the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, "Leave them, for 
 these days are the days of 'Id and the days of Mina." 'Aisha further 
 said, "Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the 
 display of black slaves in the Mosque and ('Umar) scolded them. The 
 Prophet said, 'Leave them. O Bani Arfida! (carry on), you are safe 
 (protected)'."
