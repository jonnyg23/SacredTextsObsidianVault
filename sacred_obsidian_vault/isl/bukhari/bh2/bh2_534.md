 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:533</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Abu Bakr , wrote to me about the Zakat which Allah had ordered His 
 Apostle to observe: Whoever had to pay Jahda (Jahda means a 
 four-year-old she-camel) as Zakat from his herd of camels and he had 
 not got one, and he had Hiqqa (three-year-old she-camel), that Hiqqa 
 should be accepted from him along with two sheep if they were 
 available or twenty Dirhams (one Durham equals about 1/4 Saudi Riyal) 
 and whoever had to pay Hiqqa as Zakat and he had no Hiqqa but had a 
 Jadha, the Jadha should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector 
 should repay him twenty Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever had to pay 
 Hiqqa as Zakat and he had not got one, but had a Bint Labun 
 (two-year-old she-camel), it should be accepted from him along with 
 two sheep or twenty Dirhams; and whoever had to pay Bint Labun and had
 a Hiqqa, that Hiqqa should be accepted from him and the Zakat 
 collector should repay him twenty Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever 
 had to pay Bint Labun and he had not got one but had a Bint Makhad 
 (one-year-old she camel), that Bint Makhad should be accepted from him
 along with twenty Dirhams or two sheep.
