 While 'Umar (bin Al-Khattab) was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a 
 man entered (the mosque). 'Umar asked him, "What has detained you from

 performed ablution (for the prayer)." On that 'Umar said, "Did you not
 hear the Prophet saying: 'Anyone of you going out for the Jumua prayer
 should take a bath'?".
