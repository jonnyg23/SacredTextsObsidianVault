 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:707</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi':</i></p>
 Ibn 'Umar said, "When Allah's Apostle performed the first Tawaf he did
 Ramal in the first three rounds and then walked in the remaining four 
 rounds (of Tawaf of the Ka'ba), where as in performing Tawaf between 
 Safa and Marwa he used to run in the midst of the rain-water passage,"
 I asked Nafi', "Did 'Abdullah (bin 'Umar) use to walk steadily on 
 reaching the Yemenite Corner?" He replied, "No, unless people were 
 crowded at the Corner; otherwise he would not leave it without 
 touching it."
