 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:789</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 We performed Hajj with the Prophet and performed Tawaf-al-ifada on the
 Day of Nahr (slaughtering). Safiya got her menses and the Prophets 
 desired from her what a husband desires from his wife. I said to him, 
 "O Allah's Apostle! She is having her menses." He said, "Is she going 
 to detain us?" We informed him that she had performed Tawaf-al-Ifada 
 on the Day of Nahr. He said, "(Then you can) depart."
