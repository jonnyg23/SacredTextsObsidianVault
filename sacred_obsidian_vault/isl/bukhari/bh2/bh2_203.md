 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:204</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</i></p>
 We went to receive Anas bin Malik when he returned from Sham and met 
 him at a place called 'Ain-at-Tamr. I saw him praying riding the 
 donkey, with his face to this direction, i.e. to the left of the 
 Qibla. I said to him, "I have seen you offering the prayer in a 
 direction other than that of the Qibla." He replied, "If I had not 
 seen Allah's Apostle doing it, I would not have done it."
