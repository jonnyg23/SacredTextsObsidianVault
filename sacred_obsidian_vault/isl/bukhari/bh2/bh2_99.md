 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:100</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle .~ offered the prayer on the day of Nahr and then 
 delivered the Khutba and ordered that whoever had slaughtered his 
 sacrifice before the prayer should repeat it, that is, should 
 slaughter another sacrifice. Then a person from the Ansar stood up and
 said, "O Allah's Apostle! because of my neighbors (he described them 
 as being very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have a
 young she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep." The 
 Prophet gave him the permission for slaughtering it as a sacrifice.
