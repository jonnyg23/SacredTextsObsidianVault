 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:504</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Seven people will be shaded by Allah 
 under His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His. 
 They are: 
 <p>
 (1) a just ruler; 
 </p><p>
 (2) a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Allah, (i.e.
 worship Allah (Alone) sincerely from his childhood), 
 </p><p>
 (3) a man whose heart is attached to the mosque (who offers the five 
 compulsory congregational prayers in the mosque); 
 </p><p>
 (4) two persons who love each other only for Allah's sake and they 
 meet and part in Allah's cause only; 
 </p><p>
 (5) a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for 
 an illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allah;
 </p><p>
 (6) a person who practices charity so secretly that his left hand does
 not know what his right hand has given (i.e. nobody knows how much he 
 has given in charity). 
 </p><p>
 (7) a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes get flooded
 with tears."
