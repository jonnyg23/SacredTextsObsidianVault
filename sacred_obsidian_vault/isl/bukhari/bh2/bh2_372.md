 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:371</h3><p><i>Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama :</i></p>
 I went to Um Habiba, the wife of Prophet, who said, "I heard the 
 Prophets saying, 'It is not legal for a woman who believes in Allah 
 and the Last Day to mourn for any dead person for more than three days
 except for her husband, (for whom she should mourn) for four months 
 and ten days'." Later I went to Zainab bint Jahsh when her brother 
 died; she asked for some scent, and after using it she said, "I am not
 in need of scent but I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'It is not legal 
 for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more 
 than three days for any dead person except her husband, (for whom she 
 should mourn) for four months and ten days.' "
