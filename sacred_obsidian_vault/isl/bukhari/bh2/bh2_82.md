 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:83</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</i></p>
 I was with Ibn  Umar when a spear head pierced the sole of his foot 
 and his foot stuck to the paddle of the saddle and I got down and 
 pulled his foot out, and that happened in Mina. Al-Hajjaj got the news
 and came to enquire about his health and said, "Alas! If we could only
 know the man who wounded you!" Ibn Umar said, "You are the one who 
 wounded me." Al-Hajjaj said, "How is that?" Ibn  Umar said, "You have 
 allowed the arms to be carried on a day on which nobody used to carry 
 them and you allowed arms to be carried in the Haram even though it 
 was not allowed before."
