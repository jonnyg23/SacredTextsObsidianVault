 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:243</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Satan puts three knots at the back of the head 
 of any of you if he is asleep. On every knot he reads and exhales the 
 following words, 'The night is long, so stay asleep.' When one wakes 
 up and remembers Allah, one knot is undone; and when one performs 
 ablution, the second knot is undone, and when one prays the third knot
 is undone and one gets up energetic with a good heart in the morning; 
 otherwise one gets up lazy and with a mischievous heart."
