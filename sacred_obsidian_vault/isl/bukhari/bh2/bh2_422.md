 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:421</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A black person, a male or a female used to clean the Mosque and then 
 died. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) did not know about it . One day the 
 Prophet remembered him and said, "What happened to that person?" The 
 people replied, "O Allah's Apostle! He died." He said, "Why did you 
 not inform me?" They said, "His story was so and so (i.e. regarded him
 as insignificant)." He said, "Show me his grave." He then went to his 
 grave and offered the funeral prayer.
