 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:6</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "Any person who takes a bath on Friday
 like the bath of Janaba and then goes for the prayer (in the first 
 hour i.e. early), it is as if he had sacrificed a camel (in Allah's 
 cause); and whoever goes in the second hour it is as if he had 
 sacrificed a cow; and whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if
 he had sacrificed a horned ram; and if one goes in the fourth hour, 
 then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the 
 fifth hour then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam comes
 out (i.e. starts delivering the Khutba), the angels present themselves
 to listen to the Khutba."
