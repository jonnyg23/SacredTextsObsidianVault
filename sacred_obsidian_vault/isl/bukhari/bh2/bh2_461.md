 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:460</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet once passed by two graves and said, "They (the deceased 
 persons in those graves) are being tortured not for a great thing to 
 avoid." And then added, "Yes, (they are being punished for a big sin),
 for one of them used to go about with calumnies while the other never 
 saved himself from being soiled with his urine." (Ibn Abbas added): 
 Then he took a green leaf of a date-palm) and split it into two pieces
 and fixed one piece on each grave and said, "May their punishment be 
 abated till these (two pieces) get dry."
