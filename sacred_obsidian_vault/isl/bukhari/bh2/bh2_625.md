 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:623</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle offered four Rakat of Zuhr prayer at Medina and we 
 were in his company, and two Rakat of the Asr prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa 
 and then passed the night there till it was dawn; then he rode, and 
 when he reached Al-Baida', he praised and glorified Allah and said 
 Takbir (i.e. Alhamdu-lillah and Subhanallah(1) and Allahu-Akbar). Then
 he and the people along with him recited Talbiya with the intention of
 performing Hajj and Umra. When we reached (Mecca) he ordered us to 
 finish the lhram (after performing the Umra) (only those who had no 
 Hadi (animal for sacrifice) with them were asked to do so) till the 
 day of Tarwiya that is 8th Dhul-Hijja when they assumed Ihram for 
 Hajj. The Prophet sacrificed many camels (slaughtering them) with his 
 own hands while standing. While Allah's Apostle was in Medina he 
 sacrificed two horned rams black and white in color in the Name of 
 Allah."
