 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:37</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Umama bin Sahl bin Hunaif:</i></p>
 I heard Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan (repeating the statements of the Adhan)
 while he was sitting on the pulpit. When the Muadh-dhin pronounced the
 Adhan saying, "Allahu-Akbar, Allahu Akbar", Muawiya said: "Allah 
 Akbar, Allahu Akbar." And when the Muadh-dhin said, "Ash-hadu an la 
 ilaha illal-lah (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped 
 but Allah)", Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When he said, "Ash-hadu 
 anna Muhammadan Rasulullah" (I testify that Muhammad is Allah's 
 Apostle), Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When the Adhan was finished, 
 Muawiya said, "O people, when the Muadh-dhin pronounced the Adhan I 
 heard Allah's Apostle on this very pulpit saying what you have just 
 heard me saying".
