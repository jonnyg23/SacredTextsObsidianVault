 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:122</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Dinar:</i></p>
 My father said, "I heard Ibn 'Umar reciting the poetic verses of Abu 
 Talib: And a white (person) (i.e. the Prophet) who is requested to 
 pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of
 widows." Salim's father (Ibn 'Umar) said, "The following poetic verse 
 occurred to my mind while I was looking at the face of the Prophet 
 (p.b.u.h) while he was praying for rain. He did not get down till the 
 rain water flowed profusely from every roof-g utter: And a white 
 (person) who is requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the 
 orphans and is the guardian of widows . . . And these were the words 
 of Abu Talib."
