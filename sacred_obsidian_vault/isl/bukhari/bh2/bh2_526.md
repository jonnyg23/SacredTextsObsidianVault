 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:525</h3><p><i>Narrated Um 'Atiyya:</i></p>
 A sheep was sent to me (Nusaiba Al-Ansariya) (in charity) and I sent 
 some of it to 'Aisha. The Prophet asked 'Aisha for something to eat. 
 'Aisha replied that there was nothing except what Nusaiba Al-Ansariya 
 had sent of that sheep. The Prophet said to her, "Bring it as it has 
 reached its place."
