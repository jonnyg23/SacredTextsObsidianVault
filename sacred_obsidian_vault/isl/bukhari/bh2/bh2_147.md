 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:148</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle  led the morning prayer in Al-Hudaibiya and it had 
 rained the previous night. When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) had finished the
 prayer he faced the people and said, "Do you know what your Lord has 
 said?" They replied, "Allah and His Apostle know better." (The Prophet
 said), "Allah says, 'In this morning some of My worshipers remained as
 true believers and some became non-believers; he who said that it had 
 rained with the blessing and mercy of Allah is the one who believes in
 Me and does not believe in star, but he who said it had rained because
 of such and such (star) is a disbeliever in Me and is a believer in 
 star.' "
