 A man said to the Prophet "Tell me of such a deed as will make me 
 enter Paradise." The people said, "What is the matter with him? What 
 is the matter with him?" The Prophet said, "He has something to ask. 
 (What he needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise)
 you should worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer
 prayer perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith
 and kin." (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).
