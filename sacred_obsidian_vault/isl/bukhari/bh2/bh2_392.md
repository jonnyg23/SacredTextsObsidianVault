 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:391</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar :</i></p>
 Sad bin 'Ubada became sick and the Prophet along with 'Abdur Rahman 
 bin 'Auf, Sad bin Abi Waqqas and 'Abdullah bin Masud visited him to 
 enquire about his health. When he came to him, he found him surrounded
 by his household and he asked, "Has he died?" They said, "No, O 
 Allah's Apostle." The Prophet wept and when the people saw the weeping
 of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) they all wept. He said, "Will you listen?
 Allah does not punish for shedding tears, nor for the grief of the 
 heart but he punishes or bestows His Mercy because of this." He 
 pointed to his tongue and added, "The deceased is punished for the 
 wailing of his relatives over him." 'Umar used to beat with a stick 
 and throw stones and put dust over the faces (of those who used to 
 wail over the dead).
