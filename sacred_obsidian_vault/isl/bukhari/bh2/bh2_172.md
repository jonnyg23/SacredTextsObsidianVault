 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:173</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Masud :</i></p>
 The Prophet recited Suratan-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while 
 reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man
 who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his 
 forehead and said, "This is sufficient for me." Later on, I saw him 
 killed as a non-believer.
