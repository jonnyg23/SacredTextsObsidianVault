 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:367</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl:</i></p>
 A woman brought a woven Burda (sheet) having edging (border) to the 
 Prophet, Then Sahl asked them whether they knew what is Burda, they 
 said that Burda is a cloak and Sahl confirmed their reply. Then the 
 woman said, "I have woven it with my own hands and I have brought it 
 so that you may wear it." The Prophet accepted it, and at that time he
 was in need of it. So he came out wearing it as his waist-sheet. A man
 praised it and said, "Will you give it to me? How nice it is!" The 
 other people said, "You have not done the right thing as the Prophet 
 is in need of it and you have asked for it when you know that he never
 turns down anybody's request." The man replied, "By Allah, I have not 
 asked for it to wear it but to make it my shroud." Later it was his 
 shroud.
