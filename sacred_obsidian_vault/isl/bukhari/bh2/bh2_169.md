 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:170</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Bakra:</i></p>
 In the life-time of the Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed and
 he went out dragging his clothes till he reached the Mosque. The 
 people gathered around him and he led them and offered two Rakat. When
 the sun (eclipse) cleared, he said, "The sun and the moon are two 
 signs amongst the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse because of the 
 death of someone, and so when an eclipse occurs, pray and invoke Allah
 till the eclipse is over." It happened that a son of the Prophet 
 called Ibrahim died on that day and the people were talking about that
 (saying that the eclipse was caused by his death).
