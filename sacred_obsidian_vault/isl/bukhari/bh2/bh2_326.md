 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:324</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "When anyone of you stands for the prayers, 
 Satan comes and puts him in doubts till he forgets how many Rakat he 
 has prayed. So if this happens to anyone of you, he should perform two
 prostrations of Sahu while sitting.
