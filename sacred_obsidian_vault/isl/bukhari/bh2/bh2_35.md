 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:36</h3><p><i>Narrated As-Saib bin Yazid:</i></p>
 The person who increased the number of Adhans for the Jumua prayers to
 three was Uthman bin Affan and it was when the number of the (Muslim) 
 people of Medina had increased. In the life-time of the Prophet I 
 there was only one Muadh-dhin and the Adhan used to be pronounced only
 after the Imam had taken his seat (i.e. on the pulpit).
