 The Prophet passed by a woman who was weeping beside a grave. He told 
 her to fear Allah and be patient. She said to him, "Go away, for you 
 have not been afflicted with a calamity like mine." And she did not 
 recognize him. Then she was informed that he was the Prophet . so she

 patience is at the first stroke of a calamity."
