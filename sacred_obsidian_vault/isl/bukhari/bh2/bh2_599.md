 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:597</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Jubair:</i></p>
 I went to visit 'Abdullah bin 'Umar at his house which contained many 
 tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part
 of the tent). I asked him from where, should one assume Ihram for 
 Umra. He said, "Allah's Apostle had fixed as Miqat (singular of 
 Mawaqit) Qarn for the people of Najd, Dhul-Hulaifa for the people of 
 Medina, and Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham."
