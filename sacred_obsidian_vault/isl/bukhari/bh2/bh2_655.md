 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:653</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet) that Allah's Apostle said to her, "Do you 
 know that when your people (Quraish) rebuilt the Ka'ba, they decreased
 it from its original foundation laid by Abraham?" I said, "O Allah's 
 Apostle! Why don't you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by 
 Abraham?" He replied, "Were it not for the fact that your people are 
 close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently 
 become Muslims) I would have done so." The sub-narrator, 'Abdullah 
 (bin 'Umar ) stated: 'Aisha 'must have heard this from Allah's Apostle
 for in my opinion Allah's Apostle had not placed his hand over the two
 corners of the Ka'ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka'ba was not 
 rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.
