 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:419</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 Um Habiba and Um Salama mentioned about a church they had seen in 
 Ethiopia in which there were pictures. They told the Prophet about it,
 on which he said, "If any religious man dies amongst those people they
 would build a place of worship at his grave and make these pictures in
 it. They will be the worst creature in the sight of Allah on the Day 
 of Resurrection."
