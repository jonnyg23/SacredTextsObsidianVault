 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:265</h3><p><i>Narrated Maimuna:</i></p>
 I placed water for the bath of Allah's Apostle and he poured water 
 over his hands and washed them twice or thrice; then he poured water 
 with his right hand over his left and washed his private parts (with 
 his left hand). He rubbed his hand over the earth and rinsed his mouth
 and washed his nose by putting water in it and blowing it out. After 
 that he washed his face, both fore arms and head thrice and then 
 poured water over his body. He withdrew from that place and washed his
 feet.
