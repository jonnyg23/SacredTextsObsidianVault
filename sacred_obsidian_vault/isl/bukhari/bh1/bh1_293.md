 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:293</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Qasim:</i></p>
 'Aisha  said, "We set out with the sole intention of performing Hajj 
 and when we reached Sarif, (a place six miles from Mecca) I got my 
 menses. Allah's Apostle came to me while I was weeping. He said 'What 
 is the matter with you? Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' 
 He said, 'This is a thing which Allah has ordained for the daughters 
 of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do with the exception of the 
 Taw-af (Circumambulation) round the Ka'ba." 'Aisha added, "Allah's 
 Apostle sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives."
