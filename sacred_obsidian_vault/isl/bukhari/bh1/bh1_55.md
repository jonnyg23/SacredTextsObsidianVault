 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:56</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a Bedouin came 
 and asked him, "When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place?" Allah's 
 Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah's Apostle 
 had heard the question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. 
 Some of them said that Alllah's Apostle had not heard it. When the 
 Prophet finished his speech, he said, "Where is the questioner, who 
 enquired about the Hour (Doomsday)?" The Bedouin said, "I am here, O 
 Allah's Apostle ." Then the Prophet said, "When honesty is lost, then 
 wait for the Hour (Doomsday)." The Bedouin said, "How will that be 
 lost?" The Prophet said, "When the power or authority comes in the 
 hands of unfit persons, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)"
