 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:794</h3><p><i>Narrated Shaqlq bin Salama:</i></p>
 'Abdullah said, "Whenever we prayed behind the Prophet we used to 
 recite (in sitting) 'Peace be on Gabriel, Michael, peace be on so and 
 so. Once Allah's Apostle looked back at us and said, 'Allah Himself is
 As-Salam (Peace), and if anyone of you prays then he should say, 
 At-Tahiyatu lil-lahi wassalawatu wat-taiyibatu. AsSalamu 'alalika 
 aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa rahmatu-l-lahi wa barakatuhu. As-Salam alaina wa 
 ala ibadil-lah is-salihin. (All the compliments, prayers and good 
 things are due to Allah: peace be on you, O Prophet and Allah's mercy 
 and blessings be on you. Peace be on us an on the true pious slaves of
 Allah). (If you say that, it will be for all the slaves in the heaven 
 and the earth). Ash-hadu an la-ilaha illa-l-lahu wa ash-hadu anna 
 Muhammadan 'abduhu wa Rasuluhu. (I testify that none has the right to 
 be worshipped but Allah and I also testify that Muhammad is His slave 
 and His Apostle)."
