 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:505</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 I asked the Prophet "Which deed is the dearest to Allah?" He replied, 
 "To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." I asked, 
 "What is the next (in goodness)?" He replied, "To be good and dutiful 
 to your parents" I again asked, "What is the next (in goodness)?" He 
 replied, 'To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's 
 cause." 'Abdullah added, "I asked only that much and if I had asked 
 more, the Prophet would have told me more."
