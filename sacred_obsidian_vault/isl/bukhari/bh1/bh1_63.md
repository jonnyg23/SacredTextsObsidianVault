 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:64</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle gave a letter to a person and ordered him to go 
 and deliver it to the Governor of Bahrain. (He did so) and the 
 Governor of Bahrain sent it to Chousroes, who read that letter and 
 then tore it to pieces. (The sub-narrator (Ibn Shihab) thinks that Ibn
 Al-Musaiyab said that Allah's Apostle invoked Allah against them 
 (saying), "May Allah tear them into pieces, and disperse them all 
 totally.)"
