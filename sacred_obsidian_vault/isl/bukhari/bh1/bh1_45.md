 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:46</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Abusing a Muslim is Fusuq (an evil doing) and 
 "Allah's Apostle went out to inform the people about the (date of the)
 night of decree (Al-Qadr) but there happened a quarrel between two 
 Muslim men. The Prophet said, "I came out to inform you about (the 
 date of) the night of Al-Qadr, but as so and so and so and so 
 quarrelled, its knowledge was taken away (I forgot it) and maybe it 
 was better for you. Now look for it in the 7th, the 9th and the 5th 
 (of the last 10 nights of the month of Ramadan)."
