 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:315</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "At every womb Allah appoints an angel who says, 'O 
 Lord! A drop of semen, O Lord! A clot. O Lord! A little lump of 
 flesh." Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel 
 asks, (O Lord!) Will it be a male or female, a wretched or a blessed, 
 and how much will his provision be? And what will his age be?' So all 
 that is written while the child is still in the mother's womb."
