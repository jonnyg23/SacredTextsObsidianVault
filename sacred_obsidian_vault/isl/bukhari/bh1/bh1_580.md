 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:578</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 When the Muslims arrived at Medina, they used to assemble for the 
 prayer, and used to guess the time for it. During those days, the 
 practice of Adhan for the prayers had not been introduced yet. Once 
 they discussed this problem regarding the call for prayer. Some people
 suggested the use of a bell like the Christians, others proposed a 
 trumpet like the horn used by the Jews, but 'Umar was the first to 
 suggest that a man should call (the people) for the prayer; so Allah's
 Apostle ordered Bilal to get up and pronounce the Adhan for prayers.
