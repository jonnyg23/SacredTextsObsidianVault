 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:670</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Mas'ud:</i></p>
 A man came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, I keep away from 
 the morning prayer only because So and so prolongs the prayer when he 
 leads us in it." The narrator said, "I never saw Allah's Apostle more 
 furious in giving advice than he was at that time. He then said, "Some
 of you make people dislike good deeds (the prayer). So whoever among 
 you leads the people in prayer should shorten it because among them 
 are the weak, the old and the needy."
