 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:549</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Zaid bin Thabit said, "We took the "Suhur" (the meal taken before dawn
 while fasting is observed) with the Prophet and then stood up for the 
 (morning) prayer." I asked him how long the interval between the two 
 (Suhur and prayer) was. He replied, 'The interval between the two was 
 just sufficient to recite fifty to Sixth 'Ayat."
