 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:569</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abi Qatada:</i></p>
 My father said, "One night we were traveling with the Prophet and some
 people said, 'We wish that Allah's Apostle would take a rest along 
 with us during the last hours of the night.' He said, 'I am afraid 
 that you will sleep and miss the (Fajr) prayer.' Bilal said, 'I will 
 make you get up.' So all slept and Bilal rested his back against his 
 Rahila and he too was overwhelmed (by sleep) and slept. The Prophet 
 got up when the edge of the sun had risen and said, 'O Bilal! What 
 about your statement?' He replied, 'I have never slept such a sleep.' 
 The Prophet said, 'Allah captured your souls when He wished, and 
 released them when He wished. O Bilal! Get up and pronounce the Adhan 
 for the prayer.' The Prophet performed ablution and when the sun came 
 up and became bright, he stood up and prayed."
