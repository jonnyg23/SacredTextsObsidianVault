 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:451</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet sent some horsemen to Najd and they brought a man called 
 Thumama bin Uthal from Bani Hanifa. They fastened him to one of the 
 pillars of the mosque. The Prophet came and ordered them to release 
 him. He went to a (garden of) date-palms near the mosque, took a bath 
 and entered the, mosque again and said, "None has the right to be 
 worshipped but Allah an Muhammad is His Apostle (i.e. he embraced 
 Islam)."
