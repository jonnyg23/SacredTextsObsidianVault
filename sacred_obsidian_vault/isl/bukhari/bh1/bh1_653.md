 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:651</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa's father:</i></p>
 'Aisha said, "Allah's Apostle ordered Abu Bakr to lead the people in 
 the prayer during his illness and so he led them in prayer." 'Urwa, a 
 sub narrator, added, "Allah's Apostle felt a bit relieved and came out
 and Abu Bakr was leading the people. When Abu Bakr saw the Prophet he 
 retreated but the Prophet beckoned him to remain there. Allah's 
 Apostle sat beside Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr was following the prayer of 
 Allah's Apostle and the people were following the prayer of Abu 
 Bakr."
