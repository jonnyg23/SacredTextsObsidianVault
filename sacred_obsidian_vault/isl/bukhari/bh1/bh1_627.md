 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:625</h3><p><i>Narrated Humaid:</i></p>
 Anas said, "The Prophet said, 'O Bani Salima! Don't you think that for
 every step of yours (that you take towards the mosque) there is a 
 reward (while coming for prayer)?" Mujahid said: "Regarding Allah's 
 Statement: "We record that which they have sent before (them), and 
 their traces" (36.12). 'Their traces' means 'their steps.' " And Anas 
 said that the people of Bani Salima wanted to shift to a place near 
 the Prophet but Allah's Apostle disliked the idea of leaving their 
 houses uninhabited and said, "Don't you think that you will get the 
 reward for your footprints." Mujahid said, "Their foot prints mean 
 their foot steps and their going on foot."
