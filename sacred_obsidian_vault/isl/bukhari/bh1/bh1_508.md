 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:506</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "If there was a river at the door of 
 anyone of you and he took a bath in it five times a day would you 
 notice any dirt on him?" They said, "Not a trace of dirt would be 
 left." The Prophet added, "That is the example of the five prayers 
 with which Allah blots out (annuls) evil deeds."
