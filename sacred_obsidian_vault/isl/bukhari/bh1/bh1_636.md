 "When the Prophet became seriously ill and his disease became 
 aggravated he asked for permission from his wives to be nursed in my 
 house and he was allowed. He came out with the help of two men and his
 legs were dragging on the ground. He was between Al-Abbas and another 
 man."
 <p>
 'Ubaid Ullah said, "I told Ibn 'Abbas what 'Aisha had narrated and he 
 said, 'Do you know who was the (second) man whose name 'Aisha did not 
 mention'" I said, 'No.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'He was 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib.'
