 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:485</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi:</i></p>
 "The Prophet used to make his she-camel sit across and he would pray 
 facing it (as a Sutra)." I asked, "What would the Prophet do if the 
 she-camel was provoked and moved?" He said, "He would take its 
 camel-saddle and put it in front of him and pray facing its back part 
 (as a Sutra). And Ibn 'Umar used to do the same." (This indicates that
 one should not pray except behind a Sutra).
