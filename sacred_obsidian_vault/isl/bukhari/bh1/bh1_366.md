 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:366</h3><p><i>Narrated Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir:</i></p>
 I went to Jabir bin 'Abdullah and he was praying wrapped in a garment 
 and his Rida was Lying beside him. When he finished the prayers, I 
 said "O 'Abdullah! You pray (in a single garment) while your Rida' is 
 lying beside you." He replied, "Yes, I did it intentionally so that 
 the ignorant ones like you might see me. I saw the Prophet praying 
 like this. "
