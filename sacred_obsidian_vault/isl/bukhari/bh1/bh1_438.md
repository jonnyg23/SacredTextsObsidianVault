 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:437</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 In the life-time of Allah's Apostle the mosque was built of adobes, 
 its roof of the leaves of date-palms and its pillars of the stems of 
 date-palms. Abu Bakr did not alter it. 'Umar expanded it on the same 
 pattern as it was in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle by using adobes, 
 leaves of date-palms and changing the pillars into wooden ones. 
 'Uthman changed it by expanding it to a great extent and built its 
 walls with engraved stones and lime and made its pillars of engraved 
 stones and its roof of teak wood.
