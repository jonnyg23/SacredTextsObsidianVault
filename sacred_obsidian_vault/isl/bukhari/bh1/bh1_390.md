 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:389</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amr bin Dmar:</i></p>
 I asked Ibn 'Umar, "Can a person who has performed the Tawaf around 
 the Ka'ba for 'Umra but has not performed the (Sa'i) Tawaf of Safa and
 Marwa, have a sexual relation with his wife?" Ibn 'Umar replied "When 
 the Prophet reached Mecca he performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba 
 (circumambulated it seven times) and offered a two-Rak'at prayer (at 
 the place) behind the station (of Abraham) and then performed the 
 Tawaf (Sa'i) of Safa and Marwa, and verily in Allah's Apostle you have
 a good example." Then we put the same question to Jabir bin 'Abdullah 
 and he too replied, "He should not go near his wife (for sexual 
 relation) till he has finished the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa."
