 The Prophet said, "Whenever anyone of you offers his prayer he is 
 speaking in private to his Lord. So he should not spit to his right 
 but under his left foot." Qatada said, "He should not spit in front of
 him but to his left or under his feet." And Shu'ba said, "He should 
 not spit in front of him, nor to his right but to his left or under 
 his foot." Anas said: The Prophet said, "He should neither spit in the
 direction of his Qibla nor to his right but to his left or under his 
 foot."
