 The Prophet said, "Whoever said "None has the right to be worshipped 
 but Allah and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a 
 barley grain will be taken out of Hell. And whoever said: "None has 
 the right to be worshipped but Allah and has in his heart good (faith)
 equal to the weight of a wheat grain will be taken out of Hell. And 
 whoever said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and has 
 in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of an atom will be taken
 out of Hell."
