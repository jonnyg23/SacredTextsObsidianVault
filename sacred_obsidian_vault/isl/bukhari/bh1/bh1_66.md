 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:67</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakra's father:</i></p>
 Once the Prophet was riding his camel and a man was holding its rein. 
 The Prophet asked, "What is the day today?" We kept quiet, thinking 
 that he might give that day another name. He said, "Isn't it the day 
 of Nahr (slaughtering of the animals of sacrifice)" We replied, "Yes."
 He further asked, "Which month is this?" We again kept quiet, thinking
 that he might give it another name. Then he said, "Isn't it the month 
 of Dhul-Hijja?" We replied, "Yes." He said, "Verily! Your blood, 
 property and honor are sacred to one another (i.e. Muslims) like the 
 sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city
 of yours. It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those 
 who are absent because those who are absent might comprehend (what I 
 have said) better than the present audience."
