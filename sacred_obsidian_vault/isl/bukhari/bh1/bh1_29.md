 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:30</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais:</i></p>
 While I was going to help this man ('Ali Ibn Abi Talib), Abu Bakra met
 me and asked, "Where are you going?" I replied, "I am going to help 
 that person." He said, "Go back for I have heard Allah's Apostle 
 saying, 'When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, 
 both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.' I
 said, 'O Allah's Apostle! It is all right for the murderer but what 
 about the murdered one?' Allah's Apostle replied, "He surely had the 
 intention to kill his companion."
