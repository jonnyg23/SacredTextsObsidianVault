 Ibn 'Umar said, "While the Prophet was on the pulpit, a man asked him 
 how to offer the night prayers. He replied, 'Pray two Rakat at a time 
 and then two and then two and so on, and if you are afraid of the dawn
 (the approach of the time of the Fajr prayer) pray one Rak'a and that 
 will be the witr for all the Rakat which you have offered." Ibn 'Umar 
 said, "The last Rakat of the night prayer should be odd for the 
 Prophet ordered it to be so.
