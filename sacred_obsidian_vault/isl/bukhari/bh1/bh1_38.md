 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:39</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara' (bin 'Azib):</i></p>
 When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers
 or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing 
 Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he 
 wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first 
 prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the 
 company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer 
 with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were 
 bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing 
 them, "By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah's Apostle 
 facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their 
 direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the 
 scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in 
 prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during 
 the prayers, they disapproved of it.
 <p>
 Al-Bara' added, "Before we changed our direction towards the Ka'ba 
 (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we 
 did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Allah 
 then revealed: And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be 
 lost (i.e. the prayers of those Muslims were valid).' " (2:143).
