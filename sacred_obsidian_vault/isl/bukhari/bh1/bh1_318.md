 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:318</h3><p><i>Narrated Mu'adha:</i></p>
 A woman asked 'Aisha, "Should I offer the prayers that which I did not
 offer because of menses" 'Aisha said, "Are you from the Huraura' (a 
 town in Iraq?) We were with the Prophet and used to get our periods 
 but he never ordered us to offer them (the Prayers missed during 
 menses)." 'Aisha perhaps said, "We did not offer them."
