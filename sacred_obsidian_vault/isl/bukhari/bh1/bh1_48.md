 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:49</h3><p><i>Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:</i></p>
 I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'Both legal and illegal things are 
 evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and
 most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves 
 himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor.
 And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who
 grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else 
 and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every
 king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal 
 (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if 
 it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good but if it gets 
 spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.
