 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:622</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim:</i></p>
 I heard Um Ad-Darda' saying, "Abu Ad-Darda' entered the house in an 
 angry mood. I said to him. 'What makes you angry?' He replied, 'By 
 Allah! I do not find the followers of Muhammad doing those good things
 (which they used to do before) except the offering of congregational 
 prayer." (This happened in the last days of Abu Ad-Darda' during the 
 rule of 'Uthman) .
