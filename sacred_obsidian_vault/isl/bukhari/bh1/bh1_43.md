 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:44</h3><p><i>Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:</i></p>
 A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and we heard
 his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he 
 came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam. 
 Allah's Apostle said, "You have to offer prayers perfectly five times 
 in a day and night (24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more 
 (praying)?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you want to offer the
 Nawafil prayers (you can)." Allah's Apostle further said to him: "You 
 have to observe fasts during the month of Ramad, an." The man asked, 
 "Is there any more fasting?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you 
 want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)" Then Allah's Apostle 
 further said to him, "You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)."
 The man asked, "Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to 
 pay?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, unless you want to give alms of 
 your own." And then that man retreated saying, "By Allah! I will 
 neither do less nor more than this." Allah's Apostle said, "If what he
 said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted 
 Paradise)."
