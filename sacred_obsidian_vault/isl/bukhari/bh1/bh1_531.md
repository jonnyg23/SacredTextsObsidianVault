 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:529</h3><p><i>Narrated Qais:</i></p>
 Jarir said, "We were with the Prophet and he looked at the 
 moon--full-moon--and said, 'Certainly you will see your Lord as you 
 see this moon and you will have no trouble in seeing Him. So if you 
 can avoid missing (through sleep or business, etc.) a prayer before 
 the sun-rise (Fajr) and a prayer before sunset ('Asr), you must do 
 so.' He then recited Allah's Statement:
 <p>
 And celebrate the praises Of your Lord before The rising of the sun 
 And before (its) setting." (50.39) Isma'il said, "Offer those prayers 
 and do not miss them."
