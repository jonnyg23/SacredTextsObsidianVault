 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:97</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle came out while Bilal was accompanying him. He 
 went towards the women thinking that they had not heard him (i.e. his

 that) the women started giving alms; some donated their ear-rings, 
 some gave their rings and Bilal was collecting them in the corner of 
 his garment.
