 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:626</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "No prayer is harder for the hypocrites than the 
 Fajr and the 'Isha' prayers and if they knew the reward for these 
 prayers at their respective times, they would certainly present 
 themselves (in the mosques) even if they had to c awl." The Prophet 
 added, "Certainly I decided to order the Mu'adh-dhin (call-maker) to 
 pronounce Iqama and order a man to lead the prayer and then take a 
 fire flame to burn all those who had not left their houses so far for 
 the prayer along with their houses."
