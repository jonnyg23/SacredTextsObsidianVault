 We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more than three days 
 except in the case of a husband for whom mourning was allowed for four
 months and ten days. (During that time) we were not allowed to put 
 ko,hl (Antimony eye power) in our eyes or to use perfumes or to put on
 colored clothes except a dress made of 'Asb (a kind of Yemen cloth, 
 very coarse and rough). We were allowed very light perfumes at the 
 time of taking a bath after menses and also we were forbidden to go 
 with the funeral procession .
