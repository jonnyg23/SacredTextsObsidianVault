 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:314</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing 
 Hajj. Allah's Apostle said, "Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for
 'Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have 
 assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. "Some of us assumed the Ihram for 'Umra 
 while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who 
 assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating 
 until the day of 'Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He 
 told me to postpone my 'Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the
 Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother 
 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to At-Tah'im, where I assumed the 
 Ihram for'Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, "For that 
 ('Umra) no Hadi, fasting or alms were required.
