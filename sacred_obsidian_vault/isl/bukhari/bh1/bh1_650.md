 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:648</h3><p><i>Narrated Az-Zuhn:</i></p>
 Anas bin Malik Al-Ansari, told me, "Abu Bakr used to lead the people 
 in prayer during the fatal illness of the Prophet till it was Monday. 
 When the people aligned (in rows) for the prayer the Prophet lifted 
 the curtain of his house and started looking at us and was standing at
 that time. His face was (glittering) like a page of the Qur'an and he 
 smiled cheerfully. We were about to be put to trial for the pleasure 
 of seeing the Prophet, Abu Bakr retreated to join the row as he 
 thought that the Prophet would lead the prayer. The Prophet beckoned 
 us to complete the prayer and he let the curtain fall. On the same day
 he died."
