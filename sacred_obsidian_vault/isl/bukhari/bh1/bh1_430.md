 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:429</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "I have been given five things which were not 
 given to any amongst the Prophets before me. These are:
 <p>
 1. Allah made me victorious by awe (by His frightening my enemies) for
 a distance of one month's journey.
 </p><p>
 2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for 
 praying and a thing to perform Tayammum. Therefore my followers can 
 pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.
 </p><p>
 3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me (and was not made so 
 for anyone else).
 </p><p>
 4. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation exclusively but I have 
 been sent 1o all mankind.
 </p><p>
 5. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of 
 Resurrection.)
