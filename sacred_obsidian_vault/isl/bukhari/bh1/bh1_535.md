 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:533</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The example of Muslims, Jews and Christians is like
 the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from 
 morning till night. They worked till mid-day and they said, 'We are 
 not in need of your reward.' SO the man employed another batch and 
 said to them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the 
 wages I had fixed (for the first batch). They worked Up till the time 
 of the 'Asr prayer and said, 'Whatever we have done is for you.' He 
 employed another batch. They worked for the rest of the day till 
 sunset, and they received the wages of the two former batches."
