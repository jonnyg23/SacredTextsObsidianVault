 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:291</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid AjJuhani:</i></p>
 I asked 'Uthman bin 'Affan about a man who engaged in the sexual 
 intercourse with his wife but did not discharge. 'Uthman replied, "He 
 should perform ablution like that for the prayer after washing his 
 private parts." 'Uthman added, "I heard that from Allah's Apostle." I 
 asked 'Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, Talha bin 
 'Ubaidullah and Ubai bin Ka'b and a gave the same reply. (Abu Aiylub 
 said that he had heard that from Allah's Apostle ) (This order was 
 cancelled later on so one has to take a bath. See, Hadith No. 180).
