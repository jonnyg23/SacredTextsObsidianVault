 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:257</h3><p><i>Narrated Maimuna:</i></p>
 I placed water for the bath of the Prophet. He washed his hands twice 
 or thrice and then poured water on his left hand and washed his 
 private parts. He rubbed his hands over the earth (and cleaned them), 
 rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and blowing 
 it out, washed his face and both forearms and then poured water over 
 his body. Then he withdrew from that place and washed his feet.
