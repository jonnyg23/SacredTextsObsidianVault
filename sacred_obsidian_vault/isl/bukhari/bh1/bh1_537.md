 The Prophet used to pray the Zuhr at mid-day, and the 'Asr at a time 
 when the sun was still bright, the Maghrib after sunset (at its stated
 time) and the Isha at a variable time. Whenever he saw the people 
 assembled (for Isha' prayer) he would pray earlier and if the people 
 delayed, he would delay the prayer. And they or the Prophet used to 
 offer the Fajr Prayers when it still dark.
