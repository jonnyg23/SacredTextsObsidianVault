 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:450</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 "The Prophet said, "Last night a big demon (afreet) from the Jinns 
 came to me and wanted to interrupt my prayers (or said something 
 similar) but Allah enabled me to overpower him. I wanted to fasten him
 to one of the pillars of the mosque so that all of you could See him 
 in the morning but I remembered the statement of my brother Solomon 
 (as stated in Quran): My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom 
 such as shall not belong to anybody after me (38.35)." The sub 
 narrator Rauh said, "He (the demon) was dismissed humiliated."
