 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:21</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "When the people of Paradise will enter Paradise and
 the people of Hell will go to Hell, Allah will order those who have 
 had faith equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed to be taken 
 out from Hell. So they will be taken out but (by then) they will be 
 blackened (charred). Then they will be put in the river of Haya' 
 (rain) or Hayat (life) (the Narrator is in doubt as to which is the 
 right term), and they will revive like a grain that grows near the 
 bank of a flood channel. Don't you see that it comes out yellow and 
 twisted"
