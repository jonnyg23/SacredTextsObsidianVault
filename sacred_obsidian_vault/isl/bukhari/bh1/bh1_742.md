 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:740</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet set out with the intention of going to Suq 'Ukaz (market 
 of 'Ukaz) along with some of his companions. At the same time, a 
 barrier was put between the devils and the news of heaven. Fire 
 commenced to be thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who 
 asked them, "What is wrong with you?" They said, "A barrier has been 
 placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at 
 us." They said, "The thing which has put a barrier between you and the
 news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go 
 eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and 
 the news of heaven." Those who went towards Tuhama came across the 
 Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq 'Ukaz 
 and the Prophet was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When
 they heard the Qur'an they listened to it and said, "By Allah, this is
 the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven." 
 They went to their people and said, "O our people; verily we have 
 heard a wonderful recital (Qur'an) which shows the true path; we 
 believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our Lord." Allah 
 revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura 'Jinn') (72): "Say:
 It has been revealed to me." And what was revealed to him was the 
 conversation of the Jinns.
