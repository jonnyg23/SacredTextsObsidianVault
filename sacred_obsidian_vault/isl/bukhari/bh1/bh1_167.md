 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:167</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ubaid Ibn Juraij:</i></p>
 I asked 'Abdullah bin 'Umar, "O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman! I saw you doing 
 four things which I never saw being done by anyone of you companions?"
 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "What are those, O Ibn Juraij?" I said, "I 
 never saw you touching any corner of the Ka'ba except these (two) 
 facing south (Yemen) and I saw you wearing shoes made of tanned 
 leather and dyeing your hair with Hinna; (a kind of dye). I also 
 noticed that whenever you were in Mecca, the people assume l,hram on 
 seeing the new moon crescent (1st of Dhul-Hijja) while you did not 
 assume the Ihlal (Ihram)--(Ihram is also called Ihlal which means 
 'Loud calling' because a Muhrim has to recite Talbiya aloud when 
 assuming the state of Ihram)--till the 8th of Dhul-Hijja (Day of 
 Tarwiya). 'Abdullah replied, "Regarding the corners of Ka'ba, I never 
 saw Allah's Apostle touching except those facing south (Yemen) and 
 regarding the tanned leather shoes, no doubt I saw Allah's Apostle 
 wearing non-hairy shoes and he used to perform ablution while wearing 
 the shoes (i.e. wash his feet and then put on the shoes). So I love to
 wear similar shoes. And about the dyeing of hair with Hinna; no doubt 
 I saw Allah's Apostle dyeing his hair with it and that is why I like 
 to dye (my hair with it). Regarding Ihlal, I did not see Allah's 
 Apostle assuming Ihlal till he set out for Hajj (on the 8th of 
 Dhul-Hijja)."
