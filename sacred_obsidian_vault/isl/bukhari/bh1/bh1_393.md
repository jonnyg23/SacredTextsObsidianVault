 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:392</h3><p><i>Narrated Bara' bin 'Azib:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle prayed facing Baitul-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen 
 months but he loved to face the Ka'ba (at Mecca) so Allah revealed: 
 "Verily, We have seen the turning of your face to the heaven!" (2:144)
 So the Prophet faced the Ka'ba and the fools amongst the people namely
 "the Jews" said, "What has turned them from their Qibla 
 (Bait-ul-Maqdis) which they formerly observed"" (Allah revealed): 
 "Say: 'To Allah belongs the East and the West. He guides whom he will 
 to a straight path'." (2:142) A man prayed with the Prophet (facing 
 the Ka'ba) and went out. He saw some of the Ansar praying the 'Asr 
 prayer with their faces towards Bait-ul-Maqdis, he said, "I bear 
 witness that I prayed with Allah's Apostle facing the Ka'ba." So all 
 the people turned their faces towards the Ka'ba.
