 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:249</h3><p><i>Narrated Maimuna:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle performed ablution like that
 for the prayer but did not wash his feet. He washed off the discharge 
 from his private parts and then poured water over his body. He 
 withdrew his feet from that place (the place where he took the bath) 
 and then washed them. And that was his way of taking the bath of 
 Janaba.
