 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:45</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "(A believer) who accompanies the funeral 
 procession of a Muslim out of sincere faith and hoping to attain 
 Allah's reward and remains with it till the funeral prayer is offered 
 and the burial ceremonies are over, he will return with a reward of 
 two Qirats. Each Qirat is like the size of the (Mount) Uhud. He who 
 offers the funeral prayer only and returns before the burial, will 
 return with the reward of one Qirat only."
