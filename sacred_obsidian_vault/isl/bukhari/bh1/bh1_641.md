 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:639</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</i></p>
 I heard Anas saying, "A man from Ansar said to the Prophet, 'I cannot 
 pray with you (in congregation).' He was a very fat man and he 
 prepared a meal for the Prophet and invited him to his house. He 
 spread out a mat for the Prophet, and washed one of its sides with 
 water, and the Prophet prayed two Rakat on it." A man from the family 
 of Al-Jaruid asked, "Did the Prophet used to pray the Duha (forenoon) 
 prayer?" Anas said, "I did not see him praying the Duha prayer except 
 on that day."
