 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:684</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 the mother of the faithful believers: Allah's Apostle in his last 
 illness said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer." I 
 said, "If Abu Bakr stood in your place, he would not be able to make 
 the people hear him owing to his weeping. So please order 'Umar to 
 lead the prayer." He said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the 
 prayer." I said to Hafsa, "Say to him, 'Abu Bakr is a softhearted man 
 and if he stood in your place he would not be able to make the people 
 hear him owing to his weeping. So order 'Umar to lead the people in 
 the prayer.' " Hafsa did so but Allah's Apostle said, "Keep quiet. 
 Verily you are the companions of (Prophet) Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to 
 lead the people in the prayer." Hafsa said to me, "I never got any 
 good from you."
