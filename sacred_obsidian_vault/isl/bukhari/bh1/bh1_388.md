 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:387</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "I have been ordered to fight the people till 
 they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.' And if they
 say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we 
 slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we 
 will not interfere with them except legally and their reckoning will 
 Malik, "O Abu Hamza! What makes the life and property of a person 
 sacred?" He replied, "Whoever says, 'None has the right to be 
 worshipped but Allah', faces our Qibla during the prayers, prays like 
 us and eats our slaughtered animal, then he is a Muslim, and has got 
 the same rights and obligations as other Muslims have."
