 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:130</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 "Once Mu'adh was along with Allah's Apostle as a companion rider. 
 Allah's Apostle said, "O Mu'adh bin Jabal." Mu'adh replied, "Labbaik 
 and Sa'daik. O Allah's Apostle!" Again the Prophet said, "O Mu'adh!" 
 Mu'adh said thrice, "Labbaik and Sa'daik, O Allah's Apostle!" Allah's 
 Apostle said, "There is none who testifies sincerely that none has the
 right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is his Apostle, except 
 that Allah, will save him from the Hell-fire." Mu'adh said, "O Allah's
 Apostle ! Should I not inform the people about it so that they may 
 have glad tidings?" He replied, "When the people hear about it, they 
 will solely depend on it." Then Mu'adh narrated the above-mentioned 
 Hadith just before his death, being afraid of committing sin (by not 
 telling the knowledge).
