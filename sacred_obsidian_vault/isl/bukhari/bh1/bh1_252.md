 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:252</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Ja'far:</i></p>
 While I and my father were with Jabir bin 'Abdullah, some People asked
 him about taking a bath He replied, "A Sa' of water is sufficient for 
 you." A man said, "A Sa' is not sufficient for me." Jabir said, "A Sa 
 was sufficient for one who had more hair than you and was better than 
 you (meaning the Prophet)." And then Jabir (put on) his garment and 
 led the prayer.
