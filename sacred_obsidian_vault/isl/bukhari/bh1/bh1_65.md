 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:66</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Waqid Al-Laithi:</i></p>
 While Allah's Apostle was sitting in the mosque with some people, 
 three men came. Two of them came in front of Allah's Apostle and the 
 third one went away. The two persons kept on standing before Allah's 
 Apostle for a while and then one of them found a place in the circle 
 and sat there while the other sat behind the gathering, and the third 
 one went away. When Allah's Apostle finished his preaching, he said, 
 "Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them be-took 
 himself to Allah, so Allah took him into His grace and mercy and 
 accommodated him, the second felt shy from Allah, so Allah sheltered 
 Him in His mercy (and did not punish him), while the third turned his 
 face from Allah and went away, so Allah turned His face from him 
 likewise. "
