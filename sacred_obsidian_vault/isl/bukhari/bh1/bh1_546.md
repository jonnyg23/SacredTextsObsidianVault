 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:544</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Shihab from 'Urwa:</i></p>
 'Aisha said, "Once Allah's Apostle delayed the 'Isha' prayer till 
 'Umar reminded him by saying, "The prayer!" The women and children 
 have slept. Then the Prophet came out and said, 'None amongst the 
 dwellers of the earth has been waiting for it (the prayer) except 
 you." Urwa said, "Nowhere except in Medina the prayer used to be 
 offered (in those days)." He further said, "The Prophet used to offer 
 the 'Isha' prayer in the period between the disappearance of the 
 twilight and the end of the first third of the night."
