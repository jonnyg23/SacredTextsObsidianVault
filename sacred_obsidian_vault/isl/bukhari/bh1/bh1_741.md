 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:739</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Qur'an is recited in every prayer and in those prayers in which 
 Allah's Apostle recited aloud for us, we recite aloud in the same 
 prayers for you; and the prayers in which the Prophet recited quietly,
 we recite quietly. If you recite "Al-Fatiha" only it is sufficient but
 if you recite something else in addition, it is better.
