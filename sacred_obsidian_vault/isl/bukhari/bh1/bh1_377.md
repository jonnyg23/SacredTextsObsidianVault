 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:377</h3><p><i>Narrated Ishaq:</i></p>
 Anas bin Malik said, "My grand-mother Mulaika invited Allah's Apostle 
 for a meal which she herself had prepared. He ate from it and said, 
 'Get up! I will lead you in the prayer.' " Anas added, "I took my 
 Hasir, washed it with water as it had become dark because of long use 
 and Allah's Apostle stood on it. The orphan (Damira or Ruh) and I 
 aligned behind him and the old lady (Mulaika) stood behind us. Allah's
 Apostle led us in the prayer and offered two Rak'at and then left."
