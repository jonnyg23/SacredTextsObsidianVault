 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:185</h3><p><i>Narrated Yahya Al-Mazini:</i></p>
 A person asked 'Abdullah bin Zaid who was the grandfather of 'Amr bin 
 Yahya, "Can you show me how Allah's Apostle used to perform ablution?"
 'Abdullah bin Zaid replied in the affirmative and asked for water. He 
 poured it on his hands and washed them twice, then he rinsed his mouth
 thrice and washed his nose with water thrice by putting water in it 
 and blowing it out. He washed his face thrice and after that he washed
 his forearms up to the elbows twice and then passed his wet hands over
 his head from its front to its back and vice versa (beginning from the
 front and taking them to the back of his head up to the nape of the 
 neck and then brought them to the front again from where he had 
 started) and washed his feet (up to the ankles).
