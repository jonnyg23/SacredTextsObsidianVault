 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:268</h3><p><i>Narrated Qatada:</i></p>
 Anas bin Malik said, "The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a 
 round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number." I 
 asked Anas, "Had the Prophet the strength for it?" Anas replied, "We 
 used to say that the Prophet was given the strength of thirty (men)." 
 And Sa'id said on the authority of Qatada that Anas had told him about
 nine wives only (not eleven).
