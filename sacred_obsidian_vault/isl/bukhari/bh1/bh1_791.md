 'Imran and I prayed behind 'Ali bin Abi Talib and he said Takbir on 
 prostrating, on rising and on getting up after the two Rakat (i.e. 
 after the second Rak'a). When the prayer was finished, 'Imran took me 
 by the hand and said, "He ('Ali) has prayed the prayer of Muhammad" 
 (or said, "He made us remember the prayer of Muhammad)."
