 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:673</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari:</i></p>
 Once a man was driving two Nadihas (camels used for agricultural 
 purposes) and night had fallen. He found Mu'adh praying so he made his
 camel kneel and joined Mu'adh in the prayer. The latter recited Surat 
 'AlBaqara" or Surat "An-Nisa", (so) the man left the prayer and went 
 away. When he came to know that Mu'adh had criticized him, he went to 
 the Prophet, and complained against Mu'adh. The Prophet said thrice, 
 "O Mu'adh ! Are you putting the people to trial?" It would have been 
 better if you had recited "Sabbih Isma Rabbika-l-a-la (87)", 
 Wash-Shamsi wadu-haha (91)", or "Wal-laili Idha yaghsha (92)", for the
 old, the weak and the needy pray behind you." Jabir said that Mu'adh 
 recited Sura Al-Baqara in the 'Isha' prayer.
