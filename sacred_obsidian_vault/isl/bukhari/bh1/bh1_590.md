 Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever after listening to the Adhan says, 
 'Allahumma Rabba hadhihi-d-da' watit-tammati was-salatil qa'imati, ati
 Muhammadan al-wasilata wal-fadilata, wab' athhu maqaman 
 mahmudan-il-ladhi wa' adtahu (O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (of

 the best and the highest place in Paradise which You promised him)', 
 then intercession for me will be permitted for him on the Day of 
 Resurrection").
