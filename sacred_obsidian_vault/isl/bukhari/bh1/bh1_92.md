 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:93</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 One day Allah's Apostle came out (before the people) and 'Abdullah bin
 Hudhafa stood up and asked (him) "Who is my father?" The Prophet 
 replied, "Your father is Hudhafa." The Prophet told them repeatedly 
 (in anger) to ask him anything they liked. 'Umar knelt down before the
 Prophet and said thrice, "We accept Allah as (our) Lord and Islam as 
 (our) religion and Muhammad as (our) Prophet." After that the Prophet 
 became silent.
