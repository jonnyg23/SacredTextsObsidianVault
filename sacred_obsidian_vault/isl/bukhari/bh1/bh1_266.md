 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:266</h3><p><i>Narrated Maimuna bint Al-Harith:</i></p>
 I placed water for the bath of Allah's Apostle and put a screen. He 
 poured water over his hands, and washed them once or twice. (The 
 subnarrator added that he did not remember if she had said thrice or 
 not). Then he poured water with his right hand over his left one and 
 washed his private parts. He rubbed his hand over the earth or the 
 wall and washed it. He rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting
 water in it and blowing it out. He washed his face, forearms and head.
 He poured water over his body and then withdrew from that place and 
 washed his feet. I presented him a piece of cloth (towel) and he 
 pointed with his hand (that he does not want it) and did not take it.
