 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:453</h3><p><i>Narrated Um Salama:</i></p>
 I complained to Allah's Apostle that I was sick. He told me to perform
 the Tawaf behind the people while riding. So I did so and Allah's 
 Apostle was praying beside the Ka'ba and reciting the Sura starting 
 with "Wat-tur-wa-Kitabinmastur."
