 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:650</h3><p><i>Narrated Hamza bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 My father said, "When Allah's Apostle became seriously ill, he was 
 told about the prayer. He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in 
 the prayer.' 'Aisha said, 'Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted man and he would
 be over-powered by his weeping if he recited the Qur'an.' He said to 
 them, 'Tell him (Abu Bakr) to lead the prayer. The same reply was 
 given to him. He said again, 'Tell him to lead the prayer. You (women)
 are the companions of Joseph."
