 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:516</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Al-Minhal:</i></p>
 Abu Barza said, "The Prophet used to offer the Fajr (prayer) when one 
 could recognize the person sitting by him (after the prayer) and he 
 used to recite between 60 to 100 Ayat (verses) of the Qur'an. He used 
 to offer the Zuhr prayer as soon as the sun declined (at noon) and the
 'Asr at a time when a man might go and return from the farthest place 
 in Medina and find the sun still hot. (The sub-narrator forgot what 
 was said about the Maghrib). He did not mind delaying the 'Isha prayer
 to one third of the night or the middle of the night."
