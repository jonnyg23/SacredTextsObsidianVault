 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:621</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Salama bin 'Abdur Rahman:</i></p>
 Abu Huraira said, "I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'The reward of a 
 prayer in congregation is twenty five times greater than that of a 
 prayer offered by a person alone. The angels of the night and the 
 angels of the day gather at the time of Fajr prayer.' " Abu Huraira 
 then added, "Recite the Holy Book if you wish, for "Indeed, the 
 recitation of the Qur'an in the early dawn (Fajr prayer) is ever 
 witnessed." (17.18).
 <p>
 is twenty seven times greater (than that of the prayer offered by a 
 person alone).
