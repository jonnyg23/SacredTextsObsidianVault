 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:818</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 One night I slept at the house of my aunt Maimuna and the Prophet 
 slept (too). He got up (for prayer) in the last hours of the night and
 performed a light ablution from a hanging leather skin. ('Amr, the 
 sub-narrator described that the ablution was very light). Then he 
 stood up for prayer and I got up too and performed the ablution in the
 same way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the right 
 and prayed as much as Allah will. Then he lay down and slept and I 
 heard his breath sounds till the Mu'adh-dhin came to him to inform him
 about the (Fajr) prayer. He left with him for the prayer and prayed 
 without repeating the ablution. (Sufyan the subnarrator said: We said 
 to 'Amr, "Some people say, 'The eyes of the Prophet sleep but his 
 heart never sleeps.' " 'Amr said, "'Ubai bin 'Umar said, 'The dreams 
 of the Prophets are Divine Inspirations. Then he recited, '(O my son),
 I have seen in dream that I was slaughtering you (offering you in 
 sacrifice).") (37.102)
