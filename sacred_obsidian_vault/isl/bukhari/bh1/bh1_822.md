 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:820</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Once I came riding a she-ass and I, then, had just attained the age of
 puberty. Allah's Apostle was leading the people in prayer at Mina 
 facing no wall. I passed in front of the row and let loose the she-ass
 for grazing and joined the row and no one objected to my deed.
