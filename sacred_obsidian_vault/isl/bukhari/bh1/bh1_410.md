 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:409</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 The Prophet saw expectoration (on the wall of the mosque) in the 
 direction of the Qibla and scraped it off with his hand. It seemed 
 that he disliked it and the sign of disgust was apparent from his 
 face. He said, "If anyone of you stands for the prayer, he is speaking
 in private to his Lord, (or) his Lord is between him and his Qibla, 
 therefore he should not spit towards his Qibla, but he could spit 
 either on his left or under his foot." Then he took the corner of his 
 sheet and spat in it, folded it and said, "Or do like this."
