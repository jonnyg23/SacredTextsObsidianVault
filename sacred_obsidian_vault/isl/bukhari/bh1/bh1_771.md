 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:769</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle fell from a horse and the right side of his body was 
 injured. We went to enquire about his health meanwhile it was time for
 the prayer and he led the prayer sitting and we also prayed while 
 sitting. On completion of the prayer he said, "The Imam is to be 
 followed; say Takbir when he says it; bow when he bows; rise when he 
 rises and when he says "Sami'a-l-lahu Liman hamida," say, "Rabbana 
 walaka-lhamd", and prostrate if he prostrates." Sufyan narrated the 
 same from Ma'mar. Ibn Juraij said that his (the Prophet's) right leg 
 had been injured.
