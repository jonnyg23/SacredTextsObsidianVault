 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:175</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Adi bin Hatim:</i></p>
 I asked the Prophet (about the hunting dogs) and he replied, "If you 
 let loose (with Allah's name) your tamed dog after a game and it hunts
 it, you may eat it, but if the dog eats of (that game) then do not eat
 it because the dog has hunted it for itself." I further said, 
 "Sometimes I send my dog for hunting and find another dog with it. He 
 said, "Do not eat the game for you have mentioned Allah's name only on
 sending your dog and not the other dog."
