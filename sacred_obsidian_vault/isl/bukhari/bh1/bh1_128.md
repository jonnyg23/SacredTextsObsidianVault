 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:128</h3><p><i>Narrated Aswad:</i></p>
 Ibn Az-Zubair said to me, "Aisha used to tell you secretly a number of
 things. What did she tell you about the Ka'ba?" I replied, "She told 
 me that once the Prophet said, 'O 'Aisha! Had not your people been 
 still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity)! I 
 would have dismantled the Ka'ba and would have made two doors in it; 
 one for entrance and the other for exit." Later on Ibn Az-Zubair did 
 the same.
