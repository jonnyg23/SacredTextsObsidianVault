 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:761</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 When the Prophet said, "Sami' a-l-lahu Liman hamida," (Allah heard 
 those who sent praises to Him), he would say, "Rabbana 
 wa-laka-l-hamd." On bowing and raising his head from it the Prophet 
 used to say Takbir. He also used to say Takbir on rising after the two
 prostrations. (See Hadith No. 656).
