 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:580</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 When the number of Muslims increased they discussed the question as to
 how to know the time for the prayer by some familiar means. Some 
 suggested that a fire be lit (at the time of the prayer) and others 
 put forward the proposal to ring the bell. Bilal was ordered to 
 pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of the Iqama once only.
