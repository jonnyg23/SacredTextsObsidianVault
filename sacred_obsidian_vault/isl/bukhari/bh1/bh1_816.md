 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:814</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Whoever eats garlic or onion should keep away from 
 our mosque or should remain in his house." (Jabir bin 'Abdullah, in 
 another narration said, "Once a big pot containing cooked vegetables 
 was brought. On finding unpleasant smell coming from it, the Prophet 
 asked, 'What is in it?' He was told all the names of the vegetables 
 that were in it. The Prophet ordered that it should be brought near to
 some of his companions who were with him. When the Prophet saw it he 
 disliked to eat it and said, 'Eat. (I don't eat) for I converse with 
 those whom you don't converse with (i.e. the angels)."
