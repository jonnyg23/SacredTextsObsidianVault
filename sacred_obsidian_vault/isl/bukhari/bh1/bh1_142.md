 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:142</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ata' bin Yasar:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Abbas performed ablution and washed his face (in the following 
 way): He ladled out a handful of water, rinsed his mouth and washed 
 his nose with it by putting in water and then blowing it out. He then,
 took another handful (of water) and did like this (gesturing) joining 
 both hands, and washed his face, took another handful of water and 
 washed his right forearm. He again took another handful of water and 
 washed his left forearm, and passed wet hands over his head and took 
 another handful of water and poured it over his right foot (up to his 
 ankles) and washed it thoroughly and similarly took another handful of
 water and washed thoroughly his left foot (up to the ankles) and said,
 "I saw Allah's Apostle performing ablution in this way."
