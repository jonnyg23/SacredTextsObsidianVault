 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:584</h3><p><i>Narrated Humaid:</i></p>
 Anas bin Malik said, "Whenever the Prophet went out with us to fight 
 (in Allah's cause) against any nation, he never allowed us to attack 
 till morning and he would wait and see: if he heard Adhan he would 
 postpone the attack and if he did not hear Adhan he would attack 
 them." Anas added, "We reached Khaibar at night and in the morning 
 when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (the Prophet ) rode 
 and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the 
 Prophet.
 <p>
 The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and 
 when they saw the Prophet they shouted 'Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad 
 and his army.' When Allah's Apostle saw them, he said, "Allahu-Akbar! 
 Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach a (hostile) 
 nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning of those who have 
 been warned."
