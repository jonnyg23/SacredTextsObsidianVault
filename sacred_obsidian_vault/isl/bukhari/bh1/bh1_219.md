 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:219</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A Bedouin stood up and started making water in the mosque. The people 
 caught him but the Prophet ordered them to leave him and to pour a 
 bucket or a tumbler of water over the place where he had passed the 
 urine. The Prophet then said, "You have been sent to make things easy 
 and not to make them difficult."
