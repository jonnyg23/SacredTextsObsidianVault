 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:612</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle went out (of the mosque) when the Iqama had been 
 pronounced and the rows straightened. The Prophet stood at his Musalla
 (praying place) and we waited for the Prophet to begin the prayer with
 Takbir. He left and asked us to remain in our places. We kept on 
 standing till the Prophet returned and the water was trickling from 
 his head for he had taken a bath (of Janaba).
