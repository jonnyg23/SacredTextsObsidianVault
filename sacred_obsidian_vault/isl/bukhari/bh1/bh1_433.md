 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:432</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sa'd:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle went to Fatima's house but did not find 'Ali there. So
 he asked, "Where is your cousin?" She replied, "There was something 
 between us and he got angry with me and went out. He did not sleep 
 (mid-day nap) in the house." Allah's Apostle asked a person to look 
 for him. That person came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! He (Ali) is 
 sleeping in the mosque." Allah's Apostle went there and 'Ali was 
 lying. His upper body cover had fallen down to one side of his body 
 and he was covered with dust. Allah's Apostle started cleaning the 
 dust from him saying: "Get up! O Aba Turab. Get up! O Aba Turab 
 (literally means: O father of dust).
