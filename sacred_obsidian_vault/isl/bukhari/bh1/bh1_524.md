 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:522</h3><p><i>Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:</i></p>
 I along with my father went to Abu- Barza Al-Aslarrni and my father 
 asked him, "How Allah's Apostle used to offer the five compulsory 
 congregational prayers?" Abu- Barza said, "The Prophet used to pray 
 the Zuhr prayer which you (people) call the first one at mid-day when 
 the sun had just declined The Asr prayer at a time when after the 
 prayer, a man could go to the house at the farthest place in Medina 
 (and arrive) while the sun was still hot. (I forgot about the Maghrib 
 prayer). The Prophet Loved to delay the 'Isha which you call Al- Atama
 and he disliked sleeping before it and speaking after it. After the 
 Fajr prayer he used to leave when a man could recognize the one 
 sitting beside him and he used to recite between 60 to 100 Ayat (in 
 the Fajr prayer) .
