 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:488</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Salih As-Samman:</i></p>
 I saw Abu Said Al-Khudri praying on a Friday, behind something which 
 acted as a Sutra. A young man from Bani Abi Mu'ait, wanted to pass in 
 front of him, but Abu Said repulsed him with a push on his chest. 
 Finding no alternative he again tried to pass but Abu Said pushed him 
 with a greater force. The young man abused Abu Said and went to Marwan
 and lodged a complaint against Abu Said and Abu Said followed the 
 young man to Marwan who asked him, "O Abu Said! What has happened 
 between you and the son of your brother?" Abu Sa'id said to him, "I 
 heard the Prophet saying, 'If anybody amongst you is praying behind 
 something as a Sutra and somebody tries to pass in front of him, then 
 he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against 
 him for he is a satan.' "
