 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:738</h3><p><i>Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:</i></p>
 My father and I went to Abu Barza-al-Aslami to ask him about the 
 stated times for the prayers. He replied, "The Prophet used to offer 
 the Zuhr prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position 
 at noon; the 'Asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place 
 in Medina (after praying) he would find the sun still hot (bright). 
 (The sub narrator said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the
 Maghrib prayer). The Prophet never found any harm in delaying the 
 'Isha' prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to 
 sleep before it and to talk after it. He used to offer the morning 
 prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the 
 person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses 
 in one or both the Rakat."
