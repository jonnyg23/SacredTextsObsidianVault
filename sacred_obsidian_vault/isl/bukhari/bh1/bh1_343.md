 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:343</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-A'mash:</i></p>
 Shaqiq said, "While I was sitting with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa 
 Al-Ash-'ari, the latter asked the former, 'If a person becomes Junub 
 and does not find water for one month, can he perform Tayammum and 
 offer his prayer?' (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, 'What 
 do you say about this verse from Surat "Al-Ma'ida": When you do not 
 find water then perform Tayammum with clean earth? 'Abdullah replied, 
 'If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum with clean
 earth even if water were available but cold.' I said to Shaqiq, 'You 
 then disliked to perform Tayammum because of this?' Shaqiq said,'Yes.'
 (Shaqiq added), "Abu Musa said, 'Haven't you heard the statement of 
 'Ammar to 'Umar? He said: I was sent out by Allah's Apostle for some 
 job and I became Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself 
 over the dust (clean earth) like an animal does, and when I told the 
 Prophet of that he said, 'Like this would have been sufficient.' The 
 Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and 
 blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right 
 hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then 
 passed them over his face.' So 'Abdullah said to Abu- Musa, 'Don't you
 know that 'Umar was not satisfied with 'Ammar's statement?' "

 said to the former, "Haven't you heard the statement of 'Ammar to 
 'Umar? He said, "Allah's Apostle sent you and me out and I became 
 Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When
 we came to Allah's Apostle I told him about it and he said, 'This 
 would have been sufficient,' passing his hands over his face and the 
 backs of his hands once only.' "
