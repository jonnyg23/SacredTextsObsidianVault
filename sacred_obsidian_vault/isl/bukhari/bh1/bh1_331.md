 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:331</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "I have been given five things which were not given 
 to any one else before me.
 <p>
 1. Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) 
 for a distance of one month's journey.
 </p><p>
 2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for 
 praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my 
 followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.
 </p><p>
 3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful
 for anyone else before me.
 </p><p>
 4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of 
 Resurrection).
 </p><p>
 5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been 
 sent to all mankind.
