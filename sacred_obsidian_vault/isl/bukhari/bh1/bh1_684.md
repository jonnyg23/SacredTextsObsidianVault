 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:682</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle prayed two Rakat (instead of four) and finished 
 his prayer. Dhu-l-yadain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced
 or whether he had forgotten. Allah's Apostle asked the people whether 
 Dhu-l-yadain was telling the truth. The people replied in the 
 affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up, offered the remaining two 
 Rakat and then finished his prayer with Taslim and then said, "Allahu 
 Akbar." He followed it with two prostrations like ordinary 
 prostrations or a bit longer.
