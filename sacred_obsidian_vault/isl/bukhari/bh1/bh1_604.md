 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:602</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Dhar:</i></p>
 We were in the company of the Prophet on a journey and the Mu'adhdhin 
 wanted to pronounce the Adhan for the (Zuhr) prayer. The Prophet said 
 to him, "Let it become cooler." Then he again wanted to pronounce the 
 Adhan but the Prophet; said to him, "Let it become cooler." The 
 Mu'adh-dhin again wanted to pronounce the Adhan for the prayer but the
 Prophet said, "Let it become cooler," till the shadows of the hillocks
 become equal to their sizes. The Prophet added, "The severity of the 
 heat is from the raging of Hell."
