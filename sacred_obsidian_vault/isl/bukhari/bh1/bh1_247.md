 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:247</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara 'bin 'Azib:</i></p>
 The Prophet said to me, "Whenever you go to bed perform ablution like 
 that for the prayer, lie or your right side and say, "Allahumma 
 aslamtu wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu amri ilaika, wa alja'tu Zahri ilaika
 raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika. La Malja' wa la manja minka illa ilaika.
 Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta wa bina-biyika-l ladhi 
 arsalta" (O Allah! I surrender to You and entrust all my affairs to 
 You and depend upon You for Your Blessings both with hope and fear of 
 You. There is no fleeing from You, and there is no place of protection
 and safety except with You O Allah! I believe in Your Book (the 
 Qur'an) which You have revealed and in Your Prophet (Muhammad) whom 
 You have sent). Then if you die on that very night, you will die with 
 faith (i.e. or the religion of Islam). Let the aforesaid words be your
 last utterance (before sleep)." I repeated it before the Prophet and 
 when I reached "Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta (O Allah I
 believe in Your Book which You have revealed)." I said, "Wa-rasulika 
 (and your Apostle)." The Prophet said, "No, (but say): 
 'Wanabiyika-l-ladhi arsalta (Your Prophet whom You have sent), 
 instead."
