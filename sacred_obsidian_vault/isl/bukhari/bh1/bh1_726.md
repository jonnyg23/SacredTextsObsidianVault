 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:724</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle entered the mosque and a person followed him. The man 
 prayed and went to the Prophet and greeted him. The Prophet returned 
 the greeting and said to  him, "Go back and pray, for you have not 
 prayed." The man went back prayed in the same way as before, returned 
 and greeted the Prophet who said, "Go back and pray, for you have not 
 prayed." This happened thrice. The man said, "By Him Who sent you with
 the Truth, I  cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this. 
 Please, teach me how to pray." The Prophet said, "When you stand for 
 Prayer say Takbir and then recite from the Holy Qur'an (of what you 
 know by heart) and then bow till you feel at ease. Then raise your 
 head and stand up straight, then prostrate till you feel at ease 
 during your prostration, then sit with calmness till you feel at ease 
 (do not hurry) and do the same in all your prayers
