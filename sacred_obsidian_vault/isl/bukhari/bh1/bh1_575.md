 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:573</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu-l-Minhal:</i></p>
 My father and I went to Abi Barza Al-Aslami and my father said to him,
 "Tell us how Allah's Apostle used to offer the compulsory 
 congregational prayers." He said, "He used to pray the Zuhr prayer, 
 which you call the first prayer, as the sun declined at noon, the 'Asr
 at a time when one of US could go to his family at the farthest place 
 in Medina while the sun was still hot. (The narrator forgot what Abu 
 Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet preferred to
 pray the 'Isha' late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it.
 And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a 
 time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by 
 his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 'Ayat' (verses)
 of the Qur'an in it."
