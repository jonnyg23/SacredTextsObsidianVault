 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:117</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt Maimuna bint Al-Harith (the
 wife of the Prophet ) while the Prophet was there with her during her 
 night turn. The Prophet offered the 'Isha' prayer (in the mosque), 
 returned home and after having prayed four Rakat, he slept. Later on 
 he got up at night and then asked whether the boy (or he used a 
 similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up 
 by his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five 
 Rakat followed by two more Rakat. Then he slept and I heard him 
 snoring and then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr) prayer.
