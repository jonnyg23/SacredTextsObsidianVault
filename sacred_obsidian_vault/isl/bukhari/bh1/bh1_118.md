 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:118</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 People say that I have narrated many Hadiths (The Prophet's 
 narrations). Had it not been for two verses in the Qur'an, I would not
 have narrated a single Hadith, and the verses are:
 <p>
 "Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We 
 have sent down . . . (up to) Most Merciful." (2:159-160). And no doubt
 our Muhajir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the market with 
 their business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with
 their property (agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to 
 Allah's Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach and I used to
 attend that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that 
 which they used not to memorize.
