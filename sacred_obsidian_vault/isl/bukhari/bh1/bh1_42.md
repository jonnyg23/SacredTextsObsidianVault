 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:43</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</i></p>
 Once a Jew said to me, "O the chief of believers! There is a verse in 
 your Holy Book Which is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been 
 revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed
 as a day of celebration." 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asked, "Which is that 
 verse?" The Jew replied, "This day I have perfected your religion For 
 you, completed My favor upon you, And have chosen for you Islam as 
 your religion." (5:3) 'Umar replied,"No doubt, we know when and where 
 this verse was revealed to the Prophet. It was Friday and the Prophet 
 was standing at 'Arafat (i.e. the Day of Hajj)"
