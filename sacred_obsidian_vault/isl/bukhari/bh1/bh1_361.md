 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:361</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A man stood up and asked the Prophet about praying in a single 
 garment. The Prophet said, "Has every one of you two garments?" A man 
 put a similar question to 'Umar on which he replied, "When Allah makes
 you wealthier then you should clothe yourself properly during prayers.
 Otherwise one can pray with an Izar and a Rida' (a sheet covering the 
 upper part of the body.) Izar and a shirt, Izar and a Qaba', trousers 
 and a Rida, trousers and a shirt or trousers and a Qaba', Tubban and a
 Qaba' or Tubban and a shirt." (The narrator added, "I think that he 
 also said a Tubban and a Rida. ")
