 Once Allah's Apostle delayed the 'Isha' prayer till 'Umar informed him
 that the women and children had slept. The Prophet came out and said,

 this prayer." In those days, there was no prayer except in Medina and 
 they used to pray the 'Isha' prayer between the disappearance of the 
 twilight and the first third of the night.
