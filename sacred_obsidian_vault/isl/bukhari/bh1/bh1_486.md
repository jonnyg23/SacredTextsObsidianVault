 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "Allah's Apostle entered the Ka'ba along 
 with Usama bin Zaid, Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha Al-Hajabi and closed 
 the door and stayed there for some time. I asked Bilal when he came 
 out, 'What did the Prophet do?' He replied, 'He offered prayer with 
 one pillar to his left and one to his right and three behind.' In 
 those days the Ka'ba was supported by six pillars." Malik said: "There
 were two pillars on his (the Prophet's) right side."
