 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:228</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 Fatima bint Abi Hubaish came to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's 
 Apostle I get persistent bleeding from the uterus and do not become 
 clean. Shall I give up my prayers?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, 
 because it is from a blood vessel and not the menses. So when your 
 real menses begins give up your prayers and when it has finished wash 
 off the blood (take a bath) and offer your prayers." Hisham (the sub 
 narrator) narrated that his father had also said, (the Prophet told 
 her): "Perform ablution for every prayer till the time of the next 
 period comes."
