 A man asked the Prophet about the picking up of a "Luqata" (fallen 
 lost thing). The Prophet replied, "Recognize and remember its tying 
 material and its container, and make public announcement (about it) 
 for one year, then utilize it but give it to its owner if he comes." 
 Then the person asked about the lost camel. On that, the Prophet got 
 angry and his cheeks or his Face became red and he said, "You have no 
 concern with it as it has its water container, and its feet and it 
 will reach water, and eat (the leaves) of trees till its owner finds 
 it." The man then asked about the lost sheep. The Prophet replied, "It
 is either for you, for your brother (another person) or for the 
 wolf."
