 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:542</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa:</i></p>
 My companions, who came with me in the boat and I landed at a place 
 called Baqi Buthan. The Prophet was in Medina at that time. One of us 
 used to go to the Prophet by turns every night at the time of the Isha
 prayer. Once I along with my companions went to the Prophet and he was
 busy in some of his affairs, so the 'Isha' prayer was delayed to the 
 middle of the night He then came out and led the people (in prayer). 
 After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present there
 saying, "Be patient! Don't go away. Have the glad tiding. It is from 
 the blessing of Allah upon you that none amongst mankind has prayed at
 this time save you." Or said, "None except you has prayed at this 
 time." Abu Muisa added, 'So we returned happily after what we heard 
 from Alllah's Apostle ."
