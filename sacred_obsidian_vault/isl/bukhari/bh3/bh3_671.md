 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:672</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed 
 slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted 
 completely by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have 
 sufficient money to manumit him, then the price of the slave should be
 estimated justly, and he is to be allowed to work and earn the amount 
 that will manumit him (without overburdening him)".
