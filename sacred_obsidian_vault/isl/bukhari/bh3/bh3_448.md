 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:451</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Al-Bakhtari:</i></p>
 I asked Ibn Umar about Salam (the fruits of) date-palms. He replied, 
 "The Prophet forbade the sale of dates till their benefit becomes

 credit." I asked Ibn 'Abbas about Salam for dates and he replied, "The
 Prophet forbade the sale of dates till they were fit for eating and 
 could be estimated."
