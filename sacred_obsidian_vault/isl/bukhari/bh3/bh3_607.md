 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:608</h3><p><i>Narrated Ubai bin Ka'b:</i></p>
 I found a purse containing one hundred Diners. So I went to the 
 Prophet (and informed him about it), he said, "Make public 
 announcement about it for one year" I did so, but nobody turned up to 
 claim it, so I again went to the Prophet who said, "Make public 
 announcement for another year." I did, but none turned up to claim it.
 I went to him for the third time and he said, "Keep the container and 
 the string which is used for its tying and count the money it contains
 and if its owner comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it."
 <p>
 The sub-narrator Salama said, "I met him (Suwaid, another 
 sub-narrator) in Mecca and he said, 'I don't know whether Ubai made 
 the announcement for three years or just one year.' "
