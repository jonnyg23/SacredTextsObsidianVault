 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:249</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amra:</i></p>
 Aisha said, "the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days 
 of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the 
 morning prayer, he used to enter the tent." Hafsa asked the permission
 of 'Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched 
 her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In 
 the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, 'What is this?" He
 was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, "Do you think 
 that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?" He therefore 
 abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days 
 in the month of Shawwal."
