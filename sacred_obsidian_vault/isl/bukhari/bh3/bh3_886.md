 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:887</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle forbade (1) the meeting of the caravan (of goods) on 
 the way, (2) and that a residing person buys for a bedouin, (3) and 
 that a woman stipulates the divorce of the wife of the would-be 
 husband, (4) and that a man tries to cause the cancellation of a 
 bargain concluded by another. He also forbade An-Najsh (see 
 Hadith 824) and that one withholds the milk in the udder of the animal
 so that he may deceive people on selling it.
