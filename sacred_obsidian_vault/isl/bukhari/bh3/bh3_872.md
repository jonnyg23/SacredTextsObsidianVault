 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:873</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab:</i></p>
 That Ka'b bin Malik told him that in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle 
 he demanded his debt from Ibn Abu Hadrad in the Mosque. Their voices 
 grew louder till Allah's Apostle heard them while he was in his house.
 So he lifted the curtain of his room and called Ka'b bin Malik saying,
 "O Ka'b!" He replied, "Labbaik! O Allah's Apostle!" He beckoned to him
 with his hand suggesting that he deduct half the debt. Ka'b said, "I 
 agree, O Allah's Apostle!" Allah's Apostle then said (to Ibn Abu 
 Hadrad), "Get up and pay him the rest."
