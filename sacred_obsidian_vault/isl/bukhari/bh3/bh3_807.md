 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:808</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from 'Uqba bin Al-Harith:</i></p>
 Uqba married the daughter of Abu Ihab bin Aziz, and then a woman came 
 and said, "I suckled 'Uqba and his wife." 'Uqba said to her, "I do not
 know that you have suckled me, and you did not inform me." He then 
 sent someone to the house of Abu Ihab to enquire about that but they 
 did not know that she had suckled their daughter. Then 'Uqba went to 
 the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it. The Prophet said to him,
 "How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that both of you
 were suckled by the same woman)?" So, he divorced her and she was 
 married to another (husband).
