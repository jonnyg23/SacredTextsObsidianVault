 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:250</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place 
 where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of 
 'Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, "Do you consider that they 
 intended to do righteousness by doing this?" And then he went away and
 did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of 
 Shawwal for ten days.
