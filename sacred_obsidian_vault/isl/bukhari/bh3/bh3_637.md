 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:638</h3><p><i>Narrated Um Salama:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet)  Allah's Apostle heard some people 
 quarreling at the door of his dwelling. He came out and said, "I am 
 only a human being, and opponents come to me (to settle their 
 problems); maybe someone amongst you can present his case more 
 eloquently than the other, whereby I may consider him true and give a 
 verdict in his favor. So, If I give the right of a Muslim to another 
 by mistake, then it is really a portion of (Hell) Fire, he has the 
 option to take or give up (before the Day of Resurrection)."
