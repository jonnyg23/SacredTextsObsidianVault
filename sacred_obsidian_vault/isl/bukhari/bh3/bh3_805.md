 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:806</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle and Ubai bin Kab Al-Ansari went to the garden where 
 Ibn Saiyad used to live. When Allah's Apostle entered (the garden), he
 (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the datepalms as
 he wanted to hear secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter 
 saw him. Ibn Saiyad wrapped with a soft decorated sheet was lying on 
 his bed murmuring. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet hiding behind 
 the stems of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, "O Saf, 
 this is Muhammad." Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got 
 cautious), the Prophet said, "If she had left him undisturbed, he 
 would have revealed his reality." (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for 
 details)
