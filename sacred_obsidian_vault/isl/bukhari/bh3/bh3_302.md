 I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "A tailor invited Allah's Apostle to a 
 meal which he had prepared. " Anas bin Malik said, "I accompanied

 soup made with gourd and dried meat. I saw the Prophet taking the 
 pieces of gourd from the dish." Anas added, "Since that day I have 
 continued to like gourd."
