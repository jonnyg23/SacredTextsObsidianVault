 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:800</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</i></p>
 That Allah's Apostle said, "There are forty virtuous deeds and the 
 best of them is the Maniha of a she-goat, and anyone who does one of 
 these virtuous deeds hoping for Allah's reward with firm confidence 
 that he will get it, then Allah will make him enter Paradise because 
 of Hassan (a sub-narrator) said, "We tried to count those good deeds 
 below the Maniha; we mentioned replying to the sneezer, removing 
 harmful things from the road, etc., but we failed to count even 
 fifteen."
