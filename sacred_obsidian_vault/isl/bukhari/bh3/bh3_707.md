 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:708</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 On my way to the Prophet I was reciting:-- 'What a long tedious 
 tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has saved us From the land of Kufr 
 (disbelief).' I had a slave who ran away from me on the way. When I 
 went to the Prophet and gave the pledge of allegiance for embracing 
 Islam, the slave showed up while I was still with the Prophet who 
 remarked, "O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave!" I said, "I manumit him 
 for Allah's Sake," and so I freed him.
