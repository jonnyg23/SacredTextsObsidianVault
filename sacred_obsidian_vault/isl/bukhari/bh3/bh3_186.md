 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:189</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</i></p>
 The Prophet made a bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abu 
 Ad-Darda.' Salman paid a visit to Abu Ad-Darda' and found Um Ad-Darda'
 dressed in shabby clothes and asked her why she was in that state. She
 replied, "Your brother Abu Ad-Darda' is not interested in (the 
 luxuries of) this world." In the meantime Abu Ad-Darda' came and 
 prepared a meal for Salman. Salman requested Abu Ad-Darda' to eat 
 (with him), but Abu Ad-Darda' said, "I am fasting." Salman said, "I am
 not going to eat unless you eat." So, Abu Ad-Darda' ate(with Salman). 
 When it was night and (a part of the night passed), Abu Ad-Darda' got 
 up (to offer the night prayer), but Salman told him to sleep and Abu 
 Ad-Darda' slept. After sometime Abu Ad-Darda' again got up but Salman 
 told him to sleep. When it was the last hours of the night, Salman 
 told him to get up then, and both of them offered the prayer. Salman 
 told Abu Ad-Darda', "Your Lord has a right on you, your soul has a 
 right on you, and your family has a right on you; so you should give 
 the rights of all those who has a right on you." Abu Ad-Darda' came to
 the Prophet and narrated the whole story. The Prophet said, "Salman 
 has spoken the truth."
