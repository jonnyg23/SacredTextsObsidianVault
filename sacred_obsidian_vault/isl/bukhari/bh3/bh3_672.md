 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:673</h3><p><i>Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The example of the person abiding by Allah's order 
 and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the 
 example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some
 of them got seats in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When
 the latter needed water, they had to go up to bring water (and that 
 troubled the others), so they said, 'Let us make a hole in our share 
 of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from 
 troubling them. So, if the people in the upper part left the others do
 what they had suggested, all the people of the ship would be 
 destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be safe."
