 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:367</h3><p><i>Narrated Tawus:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Abbas said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Do not go to meet the 
 caravans on the way (for buying their goods without letting them know 
 the market price); a town dweller should not sell the goods of a 
 desert dweller on behalf of the latter.' I asked Ibn 'Abbas, 'What 
 does he mean by not selling the goods of a desert dweller by a town 
 dweller?' He said, 'He should not become his broker.' "
