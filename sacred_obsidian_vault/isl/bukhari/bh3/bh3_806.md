 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:807</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 The wife of Rifa'a Al-Qurazi came to the Prophet and said, "I was 
 Rifa'a's wife, but he divorced me and it was a final irrevocable 
 divorce. Then I married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair but he is impotent."
 The Prophet asked her 'Do you want to remarry Rifa'a? You cannot 
 unless you had a complete sexual relation with your present husband." 
 Abu Bakr was sitting with Allah's Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin 
 Al-'As was at the door waiting to be admitted. He said, "O Abu Bakr! 
 Do you hear what this (woman) is revealing frankly before the Prophet 
 ?"
