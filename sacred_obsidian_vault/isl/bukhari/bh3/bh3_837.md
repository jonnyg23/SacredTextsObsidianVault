 whom Allah will neither talk to nor look at, nor purify from (the 
 sins), and they will have a painful punishment. (They are):
 <p>
 (1) A man possessed superfluous water on a way and he withheld it from
 the travelers.
 </p><p>
 (2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to a Muslim ruler and gives

 remains obedient to It, otherwise he does not abide by it, and

 latter takes a false oath in the Name of Allah) claiming that he has 
 been offered so much for the thing and the former (believes him and) 
 buys it."
