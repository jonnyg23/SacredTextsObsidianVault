 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:492</h3><p><i>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa:</i></p>
 A dead person was brought to the Prophet so that he might lead the 
 funeral prayer for him. He asked, "Is he in debt?" When the people 
 replied in the negative, he led the funeral prayer. Another dead 
 person was brought and he asked, "Is he in debt?" They said, "Yes." He
 (refused to lead the prayer and) said, "Lead the prayer of your 
 friend." Abu Qatada said, "O Allah's Apostle! I undertake to pay his 
 debt." Allah's Apostle then led his funeral prayer.
