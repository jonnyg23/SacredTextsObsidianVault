 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:884</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "No town-dweller should sell for a bedouin. Do not 
 practice Najsh (i.e. Do not offer a high price for a thing which you 
 do not want to buy, in order to deceive the people). No Muslim should 
 offer more for a thing already bought by his Muslim brother, nor 
 should he demand the hand of a girl already engaged to another Muslim.
 A Muslim woman shall not try to bring about The divorce of her sister 
 (i.e. another Muslim woman) in order to take her place herself."
