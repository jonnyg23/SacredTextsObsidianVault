 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:126</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet was the most generous amongst the people, and he used to 
 be more so in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel visited him, and 
 Gabriel used to meet him on every night of Ramadan till the end of the
 month. The Prophet used to recite the Holy Qur'an to Gabriel, and when
 Gabriel met him, he used to be more generous than a fast wind (which 
 causes rain and welfare).
