 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:810</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 A funeral procession passed in front of the Prophet and the people 
 praised the deceased. The Prophet said, "It has been affirmed 
 (Paradise)." Then another funeral procession passed by and the people 
 talked badly of the deceased. The Prophet said, "It has been affirmed 
 (Hell)." Allah's Apostle was asked, "O Allah's Apostle! You said it 
 has been affirmed for both?" The Prophet said, "The testimony of the 
 people (is accepted), (for) the believer are Allah's witnesses on the 
 earth."
