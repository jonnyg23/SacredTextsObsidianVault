 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:550</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:</i></p>
 An-Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair about a canal in the Harra 
 which was used for irrigating date-palms. Allah's Apostle, ordering 
 Zubair to be moderate, said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and
 then leave the water for your neighbor." The Ansari said, "Is it 
 because he is your aunt's son?" On that the color of the face of 
 Allah's Apostle changed and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) 
 and withhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the 
 pits around the trees." So, Allah's Apostle gave Zubair his full 
 right. Zubair said, "By Allah, the following verse was revealed in 
 that connection": "But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until 
 they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)
 <p>
 (The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another sub-narrator), 
 "The Ansar and the other people interpreted the saying of the Prophet,
 'Irrigate (your land) and with-hold the water till it reaches the 
 walls between the pits around the trees,' as meaning up to the 
 ankles."
