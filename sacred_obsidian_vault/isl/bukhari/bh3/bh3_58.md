 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:59</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 "The Prophet said, 'Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a 
 sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It 
 was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few 
 hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its 
 trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata 
 (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he 
 has found) publicly.' Al-'Abbas said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Except 
 Al-ldhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and 
 for our graves.' The Prophet then said, 'Except Al-idhkhir.' " 'Ikrima
 said, 'Do you know what "chasing or disturbing" the game means? It 
 means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place."
