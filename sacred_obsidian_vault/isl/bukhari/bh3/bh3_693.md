 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:694</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Dhar:</i></p>
 I asked the Prophet, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe 
 in Allah and to fight for His Cause." I then asked, "What is the best 
 kind of manumission (of slaves)?" He replied, "The manumission of the 
 most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master." I said, "If 
 I cannot afford to do that?" He said, "Help the weak or do good for a 
 person who cannot work for himself." I said, "If I cannot do that?" He
 said, "Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as a 
 charitable deed for your own good."
