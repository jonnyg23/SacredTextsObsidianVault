 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:717</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Aun:</i></p>
 I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my letter that the
 Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they
 were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of

 were taken as captives; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day. Nafi 
 said that Ibn 'Umar had told him the above narration and that Ibn 
 'Umar was in that army.
