 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:501</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet owed somebody a camel of a certain age. When he came to 
 demand it back, the Prophet said (to some people), "Give him (his 
 due)." When the people searched for a camel of that age, they found 
 none, but found a camel one year older. The Prophet said, "Give (it 
 to) him." On that, the man remarked, "You have given me my right in 
 full. May Allah give you in full." The Prophet said, "The best amongst
 you is the one who pays the rights of others generously."
