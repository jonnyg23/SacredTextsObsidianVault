 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:580</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud, and he was 
 in debt. His creditors demanded their rights persistently. I went to 
 the Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them to take the 
 fruits of my garden and exempt my father from the debts but they 
 refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give them my garden and told
 me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early in 
 the morning and wandered among the datepalms and invoked Allah to 
 bless their fruits. I then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, 
 and there remained some of the dates for us.
