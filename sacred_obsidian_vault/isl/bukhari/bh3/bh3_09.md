 'Abbas named her but 'Ata' forgot her name), 'What prevented you from 
 performing Hajj with us?' She replied, 'We have a camel and the father

 left one camel for us to use for irrigation.' He said (to her), 
 'Perform 'Umra when Ramadan comes, for 'Umra in Ramadan is equal to 
 Hajj (in reward),' or said something similar."
