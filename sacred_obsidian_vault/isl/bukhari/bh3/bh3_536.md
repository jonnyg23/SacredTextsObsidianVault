 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:537</h3><p><i>Narrated Hanzla bin Qais:</i></p>
 Rafi bin Khadij said, "My two uncles told me that they (i.e. the 
 companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of 
 the Prophet for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or 
 for a portion of the yield stipulated by the owner of the land. The 
 Prophet forbade it." I said to Rafi, "What about renting the land for 
 Dinars and Dirhams?" He replied, "There is no harm in renting for 
 Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, "If those who have discernment for 
 distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has
 been forbidden concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it
 is surrounded with dangers."
