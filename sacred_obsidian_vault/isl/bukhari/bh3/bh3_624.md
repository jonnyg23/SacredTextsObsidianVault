 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:625</h3><p><i>Narrated Muawiya bin Suwald:</i></p>
 I heard Al-Bara' bin 'Azib saying, "The Prophet orders us to do seven 
 things and prohibited us from doing seven other things." Then Al-Bara'
 mentioned the following:--
 <p>
 (1) To pay a visit to the sick (inquiring about his health),
 </p><p>
 (2) to follow funeral processions,
 </p><p>
 (3) to say to a sneezer, "May Allah be merciful to you" (if he says, 
 "Praise be to Allah!"),
 </p><p>
 (4) to return greetings,
 </p><p>
 (5) to help the oppressed,
 </p><p>
 (6) to accept invitations,
 </p><p>
 (7) to help others to fulfill their oaths. (See 
 Hadith No. 753, Vol. 7)
