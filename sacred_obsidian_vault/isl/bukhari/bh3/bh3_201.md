 That the Prophet asked him (Imran) or asked a man and Imran was 
 listening, "O Abu so-and-so! Have you fasted the last days of this 
 month?" (The narrator thought that he said, "the month of Ramadan"). 
 The man replied, "No, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said to him, 
 "When you finish your fasting (of Ramadan) fast two days (in 
 Shawwal)." Through another series of narrators 'Imran said, "The 
 Prophet said, '(Have you fasted) the last days of Sha'ban?"
