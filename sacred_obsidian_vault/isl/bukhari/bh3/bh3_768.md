 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:769</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Humaid Al-Sa'idi:</i></p>
 The Prophet appointed a man from the tribe of Al-Azd, called Ibn 
 'Utbiyya for collecting the Zakat. When he returned he said, "This 
 (i.e. the Zakat) is for you and this has been given to my as a 
 present." The Prophet said, "Why hadn't he stayed in his father's or 
 mother's house to see whether he would be given presents or not? By 
 Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the 
 resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on
 the Day of Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a 
 cow, it will be mooing; and if a sheep, it will be bleating." The 
 Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the whiteness of his 
 armpits, and he said thrice, "O Allah! Haven't I conveyed Your Message
 (to them)?"
