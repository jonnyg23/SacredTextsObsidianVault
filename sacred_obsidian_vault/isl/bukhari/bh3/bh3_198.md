 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:201</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle was informed about my fasts, and he came to me and I 
 spread for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm fires, but he sat 
 on the ground and the cushion remained between me and him, and then he
 said, "Isn't it sufficient for you to fast three days a month?" I 
 replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)." He said, "Five?" I 
 replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)." He said, "Seven?" I 
 replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)." He said, "Nine (days 
 per month)?" I replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)" He 
 said, "Eleven (days per month)?" And then the Prophet said, "There is 
 no fast superior to that of the Prophet David it was for half of the 
 year. So, fast on alternate days."
