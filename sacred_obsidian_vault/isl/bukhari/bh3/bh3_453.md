 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:456</h3><p><i>Narrated Muhammad bin Abi Al-Mujalid:</i></p>
 Abu Burda and 'Abdullah bin Shaddad sent me to 'Abdur Rahman bin Abza 
 and 'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa to ask them about the Salaf (Salam). They 
 said, "We used to get war booty while we were with Allah's Apostle and
 when the peasants of Sham came to us we used to pay them in advance 
 for wheat, barley, and oil to be delivered within a fixed period." I 
 asked them, "Did the peasants own standing crops or not?" They 
 replied, "We never asked them about it."
