 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:531</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When Allah's 
 Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as 
 its land became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. 
 Allah's Apostle intended to expel the Jews but they requested him to 
 let them stay there on the condition that they would do the labor and 
 get half of the fruits. Allah's Apostle told them, "We will let you 
 stay on thus condition, as long as we wish." So, they (i.e. Jews) kept
 on living there until 'Umar forced them to go towards Taima' and 
 Ariha'.
