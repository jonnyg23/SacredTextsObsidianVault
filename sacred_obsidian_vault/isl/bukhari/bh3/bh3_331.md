 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:334</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Umar told us that the people used to buy food from the caravans 
 in the lifetime of the Prophet. The Prophet used to forbid them to 
 sell it at the very place where they had purchased it (but they were 
 to wait) till they carried it to the market where foodstuff was sold. 
 Ibn 'Umar said, 'The Prophet also forbade the reselling of foodstuff 
 by somebody who had bought it unless he had received it with exact 
 full measure'
