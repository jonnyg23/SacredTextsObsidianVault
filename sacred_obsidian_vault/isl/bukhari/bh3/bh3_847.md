 Jabir bin Abdullah said, "When the Prophet died, Abu Bakr received 
 some property from Al-Ala bin Al-Hadrami. Abu Bakr said to the people,
 "Whoever has a money claim on the Prophet, or was promised something 
 by him, should come to us (so that we may pay him his right)." Jabir 
 added, "I said (to Abu Bakr), Allah's Apostle promised me that he 
 would give me this much, and this much, and this much (spreading his 
 hands three times)." Jabir added, "Abu Bakr counted for me and handed 
 me five-hundred (gold pieces), and then five-hundred, and then 
 five-hundred."
