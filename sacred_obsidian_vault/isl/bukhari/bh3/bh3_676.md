 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:677</h3><p><i>Narrated Sulaiman bin Abu Muslim:</i></p>
 I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand. He said, "I
 and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on 
 credit." Al-Bara' bin 'Azib passed by us and we asked about it. He 
 replied, "I and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then 
 went to the Prophet and asked him about it. He said, 'Take what was 
 from hand to hand and leave what was on credit.' "
