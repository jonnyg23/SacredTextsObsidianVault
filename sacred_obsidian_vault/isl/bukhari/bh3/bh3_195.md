 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:198</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</i></p>
 The news of my daily fasting and praying every night throughout the 
 night reached the Prophet. So he sent for me or I met him, and he 
 said, "I have been informed that you fast everyday and pray every 
 night (all the night). Fast (for some days) and give up fasting (for 
 some days); pray and sleep, for your eyes have a right on you, and 
 your body and your family (i.e. wife) have a right on you." I replied,
 "I have more power than that (fasting)." The Prophet said, "Then fast 
 like the fasts of (the Prophet) David". I said, "How?" He replied, "He
 used to fast on alternate days, and he used not to flee on meeting the
 enemy." I said, "From where can I get that chance?" ('Ata' said, "I do
 not know how the expression of fasting daily throughout the life 
 occurred.") So, the Prophet said, twice, "Whoever fasts daily 
 throughout his life is just as the one who does not fast at all."
