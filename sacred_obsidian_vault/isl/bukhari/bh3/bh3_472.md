 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:475</h3><p><i>Narrated Khabbab:</i></p>
 I was a blacksmith and did some work for Al-'As bin Wail. When he owed
 me some money for my work, I went to him to ask for that amount. He 
 said, "I will not pay you unless you disbelieve in Muhammad." I said, 
 "By Allah! I will never do that till you die and be resurrected." He 
 said, "Will I be dead and then resurrected after my death?" I said, 
 "Yes." He said, "There I will have property and offspring and then I 
 will pay you your due." Then Allah revealed. 'Have you seen him who 
 disbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given property and 
 offspring?' (19.77)
