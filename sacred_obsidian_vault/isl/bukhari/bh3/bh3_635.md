 There was an Ansari man called Abu Shu'aib who had a slave butcher. 
 Abu Shu'aib said to him, "Prepare a meal sufficient for five persons 
 so that I might invite the Prophet besides other four persons." Abu 
 Shu'aib had seen the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet and so

 The Prophet said to Abu Shu'aib, "This man has followed us. Do you 
 allow him to share the meal?" Abu Shu'aib said, "Yes."
