 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:713</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 I bought Buraira but her masters put the condition that her Wala' 
 would be for them. I told the Prophet about it. He said (to me), 
 "Manumit her as her Wala' will be for the one who pays the price." So,
 I manumitted her. The Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option 
 of either staying with her husband or leaving him. She said, "Even if 
 he gave me so much money, I would not stay with him," and so she 
 preferred her freedom to her husband.
