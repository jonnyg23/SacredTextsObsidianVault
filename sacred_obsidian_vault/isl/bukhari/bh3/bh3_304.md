 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:307</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Hazim:</i></p>
 Some men came to Sahl bin Sad to ask him about the pulpit. He replied,
 "Allah's Apostle sent for a woman (Sahl named her) (this message): 
 'Order your slave carpenter to make pieces of wood (i.e. a pulpit) for
 me so that I may sit on it while addressing the people.' So, she 
 ordered him to make it from the tamarisk of the forest. He brought it 
 to her and she sent it to Allah's Apostle . Allah's Apostle ordered it
 to be placed in the mosque: so, it was put and he sat on it.
