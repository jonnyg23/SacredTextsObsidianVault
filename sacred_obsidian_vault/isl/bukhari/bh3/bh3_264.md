 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:267</h3><p><i>Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:</i></p>
 The Prophet said "Both legal and illegal things are obvious, and in 
 between them are (suspicious) doubtful matters. So who-ever forsakes 
 those doubtful things lest he may commit a sin, will definitely avoid 
 what is clearly illegal; and who-ever indulges in these (suspicious) 
 doubtful things bravely, is likely to commit what is clearly illegal. 
 Sins are Allah's Hima (i.e. private pasture) and whoever pastures (his
 sheep) near it, is likely to get in it at any moment."
