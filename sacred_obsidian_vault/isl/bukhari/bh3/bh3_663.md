 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:664</h3><p><i>Narrated Salama:</i></p>
 Once the journey food diminished and the people were reduced to 
 poverty. They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to 
 slaughter their camels, and he agreed. 'Umar met them and they told 
 him about it, and he said, "How would you survive after slaughtering 
 your camels?" Then he went to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's 
 Apostle! How would they survive after slaughtering their camels?" 
 Allah's Apostle ordered 'Umar, "Call upon the people to bring what has
 remained of their food." A leather sheet was spread and al I the 
 journey food was collected and heaped over it. Allah's Apostle stood 
 up and invoked Allah to bless it, and then directed all the people to 
 come with their utensils, and they started taking from it till all of 
 them got what was sufficient for them. Allah's Apostle then said, "I 
 testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am 
 His Apostle. "
