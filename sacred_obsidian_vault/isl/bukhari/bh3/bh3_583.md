 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:584</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "I am closer to the believers than their selves in 
 this world and in the Hereafter, and if you like, you can read Allah's
 Statement: "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own 
 selves." (33.6) So, if a true believer dies and leaves behind some 
 property, it will be for his inheritors (from the father's side), and 
 if he leaves behind some debt to be paid or needy offspring, then they
 should come to me as I am the guardian of the deceased."
