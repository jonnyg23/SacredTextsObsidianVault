 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:405</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle appointed somebody as a governor of Khaibar. That 
 governor brought to him an excellent kind of dates (from Khaibar). The
 Prophet asked, "Are all the dates of Khaibar like this?" He replied, 
 "By Allah, no, O Allah's Apostle! But we barter one Sa of this (type 
 of dates) for two Sas of dates of ours and two Sas of it for three of 
 ours." Allah's Apostle said, "Do not do so (as that is a kind of 
 usury) but sell the mixed dates (of inferior quality) for money, and 
 then buy good dates with that money."
