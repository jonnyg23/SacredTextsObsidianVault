 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:493</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Once the Prophet said (to me), "If the money of Bahrain comes, I will 
 give you a certain amount of it." The Prophet had breathed his last 
 before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain 
 reached, Abu Bakr announced, "Whoever was promised by the Prophet 
 should come to us." I went to Abu Bakr and said, "The Prophet promised
 me so and so." Abu Bakr gave me a handful of coins and when I counted 
 them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then said, "Take 
 twice the amount you have taken (besides)."
