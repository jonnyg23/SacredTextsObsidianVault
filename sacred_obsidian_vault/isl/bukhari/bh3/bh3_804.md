 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:805</h3><p><i>Narrated Urwa bin Al-Musayyab, Alqama bin Waqqas and Ubaidullah bin </i></p>
 Abdullah:
 <p>
 About the story of 'Aisha and their narrations were similar attesting 
 each other, when the liars said what they invented about 'Aisha, and 
 the Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's Apostle sent for 'Ali and 
 Usama to consult them in divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama said,
 "Keep your wife, as we know nothing about her except good." Buraira 
 said, "I cannot accuse her of any defect except that she is still a 
 young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the 
 domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive 
 her husband)." Allah's Apostle said, "Who can help me to take revenge 
 over the man who has harmed me by defaming the reputation of my 
 family? By Allah, I have not known about my family-anything except 
 good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not 
 know anything except good."
