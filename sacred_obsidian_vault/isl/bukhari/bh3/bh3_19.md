 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:20</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amr bin Dinar:</i></p>
 We asked Ibn 'Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the 
 Ka'ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa 
 yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, 
 "The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka'ba seven 
 times and then offered a two Rak'at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and 
 then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven 
 times) (and verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a good example." And 
 we asked Jabir bin 'Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, "He 
 should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between 
 As-Safa and Al-Marwa."
