 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:735</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa:</i></p>
 That 'Aisha told him that Buraira came to seek her help in her writing
 of emancipation (for a certain sum) and that time she had not paid 
 anything of it. 'Aisha said to her, "Go back to your masters, and if 
 they agree that I will pay the amount of your writing of emancipation 
 and get your Wala', I will do so." Buraira informed her masters of 
 that but they refused and said, "If she (i.e. 'Aisha) is seeking 
 Allah's reward, then she can do so, but your Wala' will be for us." 
 'Aisha mentioned that to Allah's Apostle who said to her, "Buy and 
 manumit her, as the Wala' is for the liberator." Allah's Apostle then 
 got up and said, "What about the people who stipulate conditions which
 are not present in Allah's Laws? Whoever imposes conditions which are 
 not present in Allah's Laws, then those conditions will be invalid, 
 even if he imposed these conditions a hundred times. Allah's 
 conditions (Laws) are the truth and are more solid."
