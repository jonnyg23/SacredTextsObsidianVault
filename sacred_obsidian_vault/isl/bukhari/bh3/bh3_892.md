 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:893</h3><p><i>Narrated Amra:</i></p>
 Aisha  said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her 
 emancipation. 'Aisha said to her, "If you wish, I will pay your 
 masters (your price) and the  wala' will be for me." When Allah's 
 Apostle came, she told him about it. The Prophet said to her, "Buy her
 (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who 
 manumits." Then Allah's Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, "What 
 about those people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah's 
 Laws? Whoever stipulates such conditions as are not in Allah's Laws, 
 then those conditions are invalid even if he stipulated a hundred such
 conditions."
