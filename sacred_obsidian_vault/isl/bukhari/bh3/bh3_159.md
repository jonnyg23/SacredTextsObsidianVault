 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:162</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abi Aufa:</i></p>
 We were in the company of Allah's Apostle on a journey. He said to a 
 man, "Get down and mix Sawiq (powdered barley) with water for me." The
 man said, "The sun (has not set yet), O Allah's Apostle." The Prophet 
 again said to him, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for me." The man
 again said, "O Allah's Apostle! The sun!" The Prophet said to him (for
 the third time) "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for me." The man 
 dismounted and mixed Sawiq with water for him. The Prophet drank it 
 and then beckoned with his hand (towards the East) and said, "When you
 see the night falling from this side, then a fasting person should 
 break his fast."
