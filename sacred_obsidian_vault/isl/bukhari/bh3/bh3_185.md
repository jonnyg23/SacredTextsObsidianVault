 Allah's Apostle said, "Do not fast continuously day and night 
 (practise Al-Wisal) and if anyone of you intends to fast continuously 
 day and night, he should continue till the Suhur time." They said, 
 "But you practise Al-Wisal, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "I 
 am not similar to you;. during my sleep I have One Who makes me eat 
 and drink."
