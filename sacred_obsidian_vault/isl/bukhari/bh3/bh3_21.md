 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:22</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Aswad:</i></p>
 Abdullah the slave of Asma bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear
 Asma', whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, "May Allah bless His 
 Apostle Muhammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time 
 we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and 
 a little food ration. I, my sister, 'Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and 
 such persons performed 'Umra, and when we had passed our hands over 
 the Ka'ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka'ba and between As-Safa 
 and Al-Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for 
 Hajj the same evening."
