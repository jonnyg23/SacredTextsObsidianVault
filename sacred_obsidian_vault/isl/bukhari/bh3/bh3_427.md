 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:430</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Allah says, 'I will be against three persons on the
 Day of Resurrection:
 <p>
 1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but he proves treacherous.
 </p><p>
 2. One who sells a free person (as a slave) and eats the price,
 </p><p>
 3. And one who employs a laborer and gets the full work done by him 
 but does not pay him his wages.' "
