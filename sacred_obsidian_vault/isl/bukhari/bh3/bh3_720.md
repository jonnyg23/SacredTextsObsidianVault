 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:721</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Ma'rur bin Suwaid:</i></p>
 I saw Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was 
 wearing a cloak. We asked him about that (i.e. how both were wearing 
 similar cloaks). He replied, "Once I abused a man and he complained of
 me to the Prophet . The Prophet asked me, 'Did you abuse him by 
 slighting his mother?' He added, 'Your slaves are your brethren upon 
 whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one's brethren 
 under one's control, one should feed them with the like of what one 
 eats and clothe them with the like of what one wears. You should not 
 overburden them with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, help 
 them (in their hard job)."
