 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:529</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of rest in 
 Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and
 it was said to him, "You are in a blessed valley." Musa said, "Salim 
 let our camels kneel at the place where 'Abdullah used to make his 
 camel kneel, seeking the place where Allah's Apostle used to take a 
 rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the bottom of the
 valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road."
