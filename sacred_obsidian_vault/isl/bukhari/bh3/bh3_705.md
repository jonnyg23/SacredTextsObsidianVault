 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:706</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The (reward of) deeds depend on intentions, and 
 every person will get the reward according to what he intends. So, 
 whoever migrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his migration will be
 for Allah and His Apostle, and whoever migrated for worldly benefits 
 or for marrying a woman, then his migration will be for what he 
 migrated for." (See Hadith No. 1, Vol. 1)
