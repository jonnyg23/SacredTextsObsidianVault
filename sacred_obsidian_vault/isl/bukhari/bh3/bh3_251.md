 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:254</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ali bin Al-Husain (from Safiya, the Prophet's wife):</i></p>
 The wives of the Prophet were with him in the mosque (while he was in 
 Itikaf) and then they departed and the Prophet said to Safiya bint 
 Huyai, "Don't hurry up, for I shall accompany you," (and her dwelling 
 was in the house of Usama). The Prophet went out and in the meantime 
 two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. 
 The Prophet said to them, "Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint 
 Huyai." They replied, "Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O 
 Allah's Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you)." The Prophet
 replied, "Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in 
 the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in 
 your minds."
