 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:869</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik from Kab bin Malik:</i></p>
 Abdullah bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami owed Kab bin Malik some money. One 
 day the latter met the former and demanded his right, and their voices
 grew very loud. The Prophet passed by them and said, "O Ka'b," 
 beckoning with his hand as if intending to say, "Deduct half the 
 debts." So, Kab took half what the other owed him and remitted the 
 other half.
