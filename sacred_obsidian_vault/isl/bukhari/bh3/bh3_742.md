 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:743</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl:</i></p>
 The Prophet sent for a woman from the emigrants and she had a slave 
 who was a carpenter. The Prophet said to her "Order your slave to 
 prepare the wood (pieces) for the pulpit." So, she ordered her slave 
 who went and cut the wood from the tamarisk and prepared the pulpit, 
 for the Prophet. When he finished the pulpit, the woman informed the 
 Prophet that it had been finished. The Prophet asked her to send that 
 pulpit to him, so they brought it. The Prophet lifted it and placed it
 at the place in which you see now."
