 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:327</h3><p><i>Narrated Hakim bin Hizam:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Both the buyer and the seller have the option of 
 cancelling or confirming the bargain unless they separate." The 
 sub-narrator, Hammam said, "I found this in my book: 'Both the buyer 
 and the seller give the option of either confirming or cancelling the 
 bargain three times, and if they speak the truth and mention the 
 defects, then their bargain will be blessed, and if they tell lies and
 conceal the defects, they might gain some financial gain but they will
 deprive their sale of (Allah's) blessings."
