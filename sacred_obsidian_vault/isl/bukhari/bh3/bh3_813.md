 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:814</h3><p><i>Narrated Amra bint 'Abdur-Rahman:</i></p>
 That 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet told her uncle that once, while 
 the Prophet was in her house, she heard a man asking Hafsa's 
 permission to enter her house. 'Aisha said, "I said, 'O Allah's 
 Apostle! I think the man is Hafsa's foster uncle.' " 'Aisha added, "O 
 Allah's Apostle! There is a man asking the permission to enter your 
 house." Allah's Apostle replied, "I think the man is Hafsa's foster 
 uncle." 'Aisha said, "If so-and-so were living (i.e. her foster uncle)
 would he be allowed to visit me?" Allah's Apostle said, "Yes, he 
 would, as the foster relations are treated like blood relations (in 
 marital affairs)."
