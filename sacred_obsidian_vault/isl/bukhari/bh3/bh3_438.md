 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:441</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle came to Medina and the people used to pay in advance 
 the price of fruits to be delivered within one or two years. (The 
 sub-narrator is in doubt whether it was one to two years or two to 
 three years.) The Prophet said, "Whoever pays money in advance for 
 dates (to be delivered later) should pay it for known specified weight
 and measure (of the dates)."
