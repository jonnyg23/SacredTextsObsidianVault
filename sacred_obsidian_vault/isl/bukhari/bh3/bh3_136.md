 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:139</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara:</i></p>
 It was the custom among the companions of Muhammad that if any of them
 was fasting and the food was presented (for breaking his fast), but he
 slept before eating, he would not eat that night and the following day
 till sunset.
 <p>
 Qais bin Sirma-al-Ansari was fasting and came to his wife at the time 
 of Iftar (breaking one's fast) and asked her whether she had anything 
 to eat. She replied, "No, but I would go and bring some for you." He 
 used to do hard work during the day, so he was overwhelmed by sleep 
 and slept. When his wife came and saw him, she said, "Disappointment 
 for you." When it was midday on the following day, he fainted and the 
 Prophet was informed about the whole matter and the following verses 
 were revealed: "You are permitted To go to your wives (for sexual 
 relation) At the night of fasting." So, they were overjoyed by it. And
 then Allah also revealed: "And eat and drink Until the white thread Of
 dawn appears to you Distinct from the black thread (of the night)."  
 (2.187)
