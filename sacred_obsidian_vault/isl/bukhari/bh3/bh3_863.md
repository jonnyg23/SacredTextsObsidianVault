 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:864</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle set out for the 'Umra but the pagans of Quraish 
 prevented him from reaching the Ka'ba. So, he slaughtered his 
 sacrifice and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with 
 them that he would perform 'Umra the following year and would not 
 carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca except for the
 period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the 'Umra in the 
 following year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he 
 stayed for three days, the pagans ordered him to depart, and he 
 departed.
