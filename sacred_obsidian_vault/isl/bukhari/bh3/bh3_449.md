 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:452</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Al-Bakhtari:</i></p>
 I asked Ibn 'Umar about Salam for dates. Ibn 'Umar replied, "The 
 Prophet forbade the sale (the fruits) of datepalms until they were fit
 for eating and also forbade the sale of silver for gold on credit." I 
 also asked Ibn 'Abbas about it. Ibn 'Abbas replied, "The Prophet 
 forbade the sale of dates till they were fit for eating, and could be 
 weighed." I asked him, "What is to be weighed (as the dates are on the
 trees)?" A man sitting by Ibn 'Abbas said, "It means till they are cut
 and stored."
