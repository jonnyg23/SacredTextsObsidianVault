 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:774</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</i></p>
 A drink (milk mixed with water) was brought to the Prophet who drank 
 some of it while a boy was sitting on his right and old men on his 
 left. The Prophet said to the boy, "If you permit me, I'll give (the 
 rest of the drink to) these old men first." The boy said, "I will not 
 give preference to any one over me as regards my share from you, O 
 Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet then put that container in the boy's 
 hand. (See Hadith No. 541).
