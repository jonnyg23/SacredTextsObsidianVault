 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:601</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</i></p>
 I heard Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way 
 different to that of mine. Allah's Apostle had taught it to me (in a 
 different way). So, I was about to quarrel with him (during the 
 prayer) but I waited till he finished, then I tied his garment round 
 his neck and seized him by it and brought him to Allah's Apostle and 
 said, "I have heard him reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to
 the way you taught it to me." The Prophet ordered me to release him 
 and asked Hisham to recite it. When he recited it, Allah s Apostle 
 said, "It was revealed in this way." He then asked me to recite it. 
 When I recited it, he said, "It was revealed in this way. The Qur'an 
 has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way 
 that is easier for you."
