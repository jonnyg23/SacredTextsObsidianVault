 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:489</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</i></p>
 Ibn Abbas said, "In the verse: To every one We have appointed ' 
 (Muwaliya Mawaliya means one's) heirs (4.33).' (And regarding the 
 verse) 'And those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.' Ibn 
 'Abbas said, "When the emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the 
 emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the latter's relatives would 
 not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet 
 established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the 
 verse: 'And to everyone We have appointed heirs' (4.33) was revealed, 
 it cancelled (the bond (the pledge) of brotherhood regarding 
 inheritance)." Then he said, "The verse: To those also to whom your 
 right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation and 
 mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it 
 became permissible to assign something in one's testament to the 
 person who had the right of inheriting before.
