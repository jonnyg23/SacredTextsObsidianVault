 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:220</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 Quraish used to fast on the day of 'Ashura' in the Pre-lslamic period,
 and Allah's Apostle too, used to fast on that day. When he came to 
 Medina, he fasted on that day and ordered others to fast, too. Later 
 when the fasting of the month of Ramadan was prescribed, he gave up 
 fasting on the day of 'Ashura' and it became optional for one to fast 
 on it or not.
