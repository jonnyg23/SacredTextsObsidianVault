 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:128</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Allah said, 'All the deeds of Adam's sons 
 (people) are for them, except fasting which is for Me, and I will give
 the reward for it.' Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire 
 and from committing sins. If one of you is fasting, he should avoid 
 sexual relation with his wife and quarreling, and if somebody should 
 fight or quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him in 
 Whose Hands my soul is' The unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth
 of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of 
 musk. There are two pleasures for the fasting person, one at the time 
 of breaking his fast, and the other at the time when he will meet his 
 Lord; then he will be pleased because of his fasting."
