 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:200</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As:</i></p>
 The Prophet said to me, "You fast daily all the year and pray every 
 night all the night?" I replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said, 
 "If you keep on doing this, your eyes will become weak and your body 
 will get tired. He who fasts all the year is as he who did not fast at
 all. The fasting of three days (a month) will be equal to the tasting 
 of the whole year." I replied, "I have the power for more than this." 
 The Prophet said, "Then fast like the fasting of David who used to 
 fast on alternate days and would never flee from the battle field, on 
 meeting the enemy.
