 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:6</h3><p><i>Narrated Qatada:</i></p>
 I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He 
 replied, "Four times. 1. 'Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa'da when the 
 pagans hindered him; 2. 'Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa'da 
 after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. 'Umra from 
 Al-Jr'rana where he distributed the war booty." I think he meant the 
 booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, "How many times did he 
 perform Hajj?" He (Anas) replied, "Once. "
