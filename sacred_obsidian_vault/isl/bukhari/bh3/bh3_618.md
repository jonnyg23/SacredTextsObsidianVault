 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:619</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Bakr:</i></p>
 While I was on my way, all of a sudden I saw a shepherd driving his 
 sheep, I asked him whose servant he was. He replied that he was the 
 servant of a man from Quraish, and then he mentioned his name and I 
 recognized him. I asked, "Do your sheep have some milk?" He replied in
 the affirmative. I said, "Are you going to milk for me?" He replied in
 the affirmative. I ordered him and he tied the legs of one of the 
 sheep. Then I told him to clean the udder (teats) of dust and to 
 remove dust off his hands. He removed the dust off his hands by 
 clapping his hands. He then milked a little milk. I put the milk for 
 Allah's Apostle in a pot and closed its mouth with a piece of cloth 
 and poured water over it till it became cold. I took it to the Prophet
 and said, "Drink, O Allah's Apostle!" He drank it till I was pleased.
