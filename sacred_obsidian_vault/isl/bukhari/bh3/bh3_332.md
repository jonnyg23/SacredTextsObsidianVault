 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:335</h3><p><i>Narrated Ata bin Yasar:</i></p>
 I met Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As and asked him, "Tell me about the 
 description of Allah's Apostle which is mentioned in Torah (i.e. Old 
 Testament.") He replied, 'Yes. By Allah, he is described in Torah with
 some of the qualities attributed to him in the Quran as follows:
 <p>
 "O Prophet ! We have sent you as a witness (for Allah's True religion)
 And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), And a warner 
 (to the unbelievers) And guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave
 and My messenger (i.e. Apostle). I have named you "Al-Mutawakkil" (who
 depends upon Allah). You are neither discourteous, harsh Nor a 
 noise-maker in the markets And you do not do evil to those Who do evil
 to you, but you deal With them with forgiveness and kindness. Allah 
 will not let him (the Prophet) Die till he makes straight the crooked 
 people by making them say: "None has the right to be worshipped but 
 Allah," With which will be opened blind eyes And deaf ears and 
 enveloped hearts."
