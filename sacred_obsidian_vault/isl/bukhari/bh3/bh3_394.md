 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:397</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar from Zaid bin Thabit:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle allowed the sale of 'Araya by estimating the dates on 
 them for measured amounts of dried dates. Musa bin 'Uqba said, "Al- 
 'Araya were distinguished date palms; one could come and buy them 
 (i.e. their fruits)."
