 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:468</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Your example and the example of the people of the 
 two Scriptures (i.e. Jews and Christians) is like the example of a man
 who employed some laborers and asked them, 'Who will work for me from 
 morning till midday for one Qirat?' The Jews accepted and carried out 
 the work. He then asked, Who will work for me from midday up to the 
 'Asr prayer for one Qirat?' The Christians accepted and fulfilled the 
 work. He then said, 'Who will work for me from the 'Asr till sunset 
 for two Qirats?' You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and 
 the Christians got angry and said, 'Why should we work more and get 
 lesser wages?' (Allah) said, 'Have I with-held part of your right?' 
 They replied in the negative. He said, 'It is My Blessing, I bestow 
 upon whomever I wish .'
