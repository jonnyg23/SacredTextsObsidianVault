 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:606</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Ka'b bin Malik Al-Ansari from Ka'b bin Malik:</i></p>
 That 'Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad Al-Aslami owed him some debt. Ka'b met 
 him and caught hold of him and they started talking and their voices 
 grew loudest. The Prophet passed by them and addressed Ka'b, pointing 
 out to him to reduce the debt to one half. So, Ka'b got one half of 
 the debt and exempted the debtor from the other half.
