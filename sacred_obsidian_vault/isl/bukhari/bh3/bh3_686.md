 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:687</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Who would kill Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf as he has 
 harmed Allah and His Apostle ?" Muhammad bin Maslama (got up and) 
 said, "I will kill him." So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to Ka'b and 
 said, "I want a loan of one or two Wasqs of food grains." Ka'b said, 
 "Mortgage your women to me." Muhammad bin Maslama said, "How can we 
 mortgage our women, and you are the most handsome among the Arabs?" He
 said, "Then mortgage your sons to me." Muhammad said, "How can we 
 mortgage our sons, as the people will abuse them for being mortgaged 
 for one or two Wasqs of food grains? It is shameful for us. But we 
 will mortgage our arms to you." So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him 
 that he would come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and 
 his companions came to him as promised and murdered him. Then they 
 went to the Prophet and told him about it.
