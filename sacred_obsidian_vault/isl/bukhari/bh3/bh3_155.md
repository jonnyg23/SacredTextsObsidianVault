 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:158</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A man came to the Prophet and said, "I had sexual intercourse with my 
 wife on Ramadan (while fasting)." The Prophet asked him, "Can you 
 afford to manumit a slave?" He replied in the negative. The Prophet 
 asked him, "Can you fast for two successive months?" He replied in the
 negative. He asked him, "Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?" 
 He replied in the negative. (Abu Huraira added): Then a basket full of
 dates was brought to the Prophet and he said (to that man), "Feed 
 (poor people) with this by way of atonement." He said, "(Should I feed
 it) to poorer people than we? There is no poorer house than ours 
 between its (Medina's) mountains." The Prophet said, "Then feed your 
 family with it."
