 The Prophet said, "There are three types of people whom Allah will 
 neither talk to, nor look at, on the Day of Resurrection. (They are):

 1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered for his 
 goods so much more than what he is given,

 2. a man who takes a false oath after the 'Asr prayer in order to grab

 "Today I will with-hold My Grace from you as you with-held the 
 superfluity of what you had not created."
