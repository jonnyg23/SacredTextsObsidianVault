 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:436</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 I heard the Prophet saying, "If a slave-girl of yours commits illegal 
 sexual intercourse and her illegal sexual intercourse is proved, she

 lashed and nobody should blame her after that, and if she does the 
 offense for the third time and her illegal sexual intercourse is 
 proved, she should be sold even for a hair rope."
