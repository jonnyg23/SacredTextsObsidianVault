 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:323</h3><p><i>Narrated Hakim bin Hizam:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The buyer and the seller have the option of 
 cancelling or confirming the bargain unless they separate, and if they
 spoke the truth and made clear the defects of the goods, them they 
 would be blessed in their bargain, and if they told lies and hid  some
 facts, their bargain would be deprived of Allah's blessings."
