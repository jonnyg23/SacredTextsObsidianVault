 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:718</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Muhairiz:</i></p>
 I saw Abu Said and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu Said said, 
 "We went with Allah's Apostle, in the Ghazwa of Barli Al-Mustaliq and 
 we captured some of the 'Arabs as captives, and the long separation 
 from our wives was pressing us hard and we wanted to practice coitus 
 interruptus. We asked Allah's Apostle (whether it was permissible). He
 said, "It is better for you not to do so. No soul, (that which Allah 
 has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will 
 definitely come, into existence."
