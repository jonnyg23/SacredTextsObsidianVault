 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:167</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle was on a journey and saw a crowd of people, and a man 
 was being shaded (by them). He asked, "What is the matter?" They said,
 "He (the man) is fasting." The Prophet said, "It is not righteousness 
 that you fast on a journey."
