 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:85</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "A woman should not travel except with a Dhu-Mahram 
 (her husband or a man with whom that woman cannot marry at all 
 according to the Islamic Jurisprudence), and no man may visit her 
 except in the presence of a Dhu-Mahram." A man got up and said, "O 
 Allah's Apostle! I intend to go to such and such an army and my wife 
 wants to perform Hajj." The Prophet said (to him), "Go along with her 
 (to Hajj)."
