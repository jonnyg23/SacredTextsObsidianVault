 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:99</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Zuhair:</i></p>
 I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Yemen will be conquered and some 
 people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and 
 those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be
 better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and 
 some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families 
 and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina 
 will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and
 some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families 
 and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina 
 will be better for them; if they but knew."
