 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:333</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira Ad-Dausi:</i></p>
 Once the Prophet went out during the day. Neither did he talk to me 
 nor I to him till he reached the market of Bani Qainuqa and then he 
 sat in the compound of Fatima's house and asked about the small boy 
 (his grandson Al-Hasan) but Fatima kept the boy in for a while. I 
 thought she was either changing his clothes or giving the boy a bath. 
 After a while the boy came out running and the Prophet embraced and 
 kissed him and then said, 'O Allah! Love him, and love whoever loves 
 him.'
