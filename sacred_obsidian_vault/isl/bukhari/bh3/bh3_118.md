 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:121</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever gives two kinds (of things or property)
 in charity for Allah's Cause, will be called from the gates of 
 Paradise and will be addressed, 'O slaves of Allah! Here is 
 prosperity.' So, whoever was amongst the people who used to offer 
 their prayers, will be called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever
 was amongst the people who used to participate in Jihad, will be 
 called from the gate of Jihad; and whoever was amongst those who used 
 to observe fasts, will be called from the gate of Ar-Raiyan; whoever 
 was amongst those who used to give in charity, will be called from the
 gate of charity." Abu Bakr said, "Let my parents be sacrificed for 
 you, O Allah's Apostle! No distress or need will befall him who will 
 be called from those gates. Will there be any one who will be called 
 from all these gates?" The Prophet replied, "Yes, and I hope you will 
 be one of them."
