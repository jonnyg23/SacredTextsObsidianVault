 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:403</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle forbade the sale of fruits till they are almost ripe. 
 He was asked what is meant by 'are almost ripe.' He replied, "Till 
 they become red." Allah's Apostle further said, "If Allah spoiled the 
 fruits, what right would one have to take the money of one's brother 
 (i.e. other people)?"
 <p>
 is evident and then the fruits were spoiled with blights, the loss 
 would be suffered by the owner (not the buyer).
 </p><p>
 not sell or buy fruits before their benefit was evident and do not 
 sell fresh fruits (dates) for dried dates."
