 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:823</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 The Prophet heard a man (reciting Quran) in the Mosque, and he said, 
 "May Allah bestow His Mercy upon him. No doubt, he made me remember 
 such-and such Verses of such-and-such Sura which I dropped (from my 
 memory).
 <p>
 and then he heard the voice of 'Abbas who was praying in the Mosque, 
 and said, "O 'Aisha! Is this 'Abbad's voice?" I said, "Yes." He said, 
 "O Allah! Be merciful to 'Abbas!"
