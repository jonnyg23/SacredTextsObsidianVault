 twelve Ghazawat with the Prophet said, "I heard four things from 
 Allah's Apostle (or I narrate them from the Prophet ) which won my 
 admiration and appreciation. They are:
 <p>
 1. "No lady should travel without her husband or without a Dhu-Mahram 
 for a two-days' journey.
 </p><p>
 2. No fasting is permissible on two days of 'Id-al-Fitr, and 
 'Id-al-Adha.
 </p><p>
 3. No prayer (may be offered) after two prayers: after the 'Asr prayer
 till the sun set and after the morning prayer till the sun rises.
 </p><p>
 4. Not to travel (for visiting) except for three mosques: 
 Masjid-al-Haram (in Mecca), my Mosque (in Medina), and Masjid-al-Aqsa 
 (in Jerusalem)."
