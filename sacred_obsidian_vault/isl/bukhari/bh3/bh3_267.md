 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:270</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Adi bin Hatim:</i></p>
 I asked Allah's Apostle about Al Mirad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of 
 wood or a piece of wood provided with a piece of iron used for 
 hunting). He replied, "If the game is hit by its sharp edge, eat it, 
 and if it is hit by its broad side, do not eat it, for it has been 
 beaten to death." I asked, "O Allah's Apostle! I release my dog by the
 name of Allah and find with it at the game, another dog on which I 
 have not mentioned the name of Allah, and I do not know which one of 
 them caught the game." Allah's Apostle said (to him), 'Don't eat it as
 you have mentioned the name of Allah on your dog and not on the other 
 dog."
