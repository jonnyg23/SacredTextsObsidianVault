 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:554</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</i></p>
 Once a tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to Allah's Apostle 
 who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who
 was the youngest of those who were present, and on his left side there
 were old men. The Prophet asked, "O boy ! Do you allow me to give (the
 drink) to the elder people (first)?" The boy said, "I will not prefer 
 anybody to have my share from you, O Allah's Apostle!" So, he gave it 
 to the boy.
