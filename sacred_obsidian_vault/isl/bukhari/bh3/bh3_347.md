 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:350</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle forbade the selling of things by a town dweller on 
 behalf of a desert dweller; and similarly Najsh was forbidden. And one
 should not urge somebody to return the goods to the seller so as to 
 sell him his own goods; nor should one demand the hand of a girl who 
 has already been engaged to someone else; and a woman should not try 
 to cause some other woman to be divorced in order to take her place.
