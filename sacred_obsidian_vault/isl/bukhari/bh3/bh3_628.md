 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:629</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever has oppressed another person concerning
 his reputation or anything else, he should beg him to forgive him 
 before the Day of Resurrection when there will be no money (to 
 compensate for wrong deeds), but if he has good deeds, those good 
 deeds will be taken from him according to his oppression which he has 
 done, and if he has no good deeds, the sins of the oppressed person 
 will be loaded on him."
