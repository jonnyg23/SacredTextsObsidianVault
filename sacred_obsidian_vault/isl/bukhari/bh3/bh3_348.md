 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:351</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</i></p>
 A man decided that a slave of his would be manumitted after his death 
 and later on he was in need of money, so the Prophet took the slave 
 and said, "Who will buy this slave from me?" Nu'aim bin 'Abdullah 
 bought him for such and such price and the Prophet gave him the 
 slave.
