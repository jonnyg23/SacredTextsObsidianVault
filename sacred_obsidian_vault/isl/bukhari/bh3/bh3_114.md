 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:117</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 (The tribe of) Quraish used to fast on the day of Ashura' in the 
 Pre-lslamic period, and then Allah's Apostle ordered (Muslims) to fast
 on it till the fasting in the month of Ramadan was prescribed; 
 whereupon the Prophet said, "He who wants to fast (on 'Ashura') may 
 fast, and he who does not want to fast may not fast."
