 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:44</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</i></p>
 (Reporting the speech of Ka'b bin Umra) Allah's Apostle saw him (i.e. 
 Ka'b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), "Have 
 your lice troubled you?" He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered
 him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time 
 they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping 
 to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah's 
 Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or
 to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.
