 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:49</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Qatada:</i></p>
 We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which
 is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada 
 narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of
 the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram
 while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were 
 watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse
 and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them 
 to pick it up for me) but they said, "We will not help you by any 
 means as we are in a state of Ihram." So, I picked up the whip myself 
 and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and 
 brought it to my companions. Some of them said, "Eat it." While some 
 others said, "Do not eat it." So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead 
 of us and asked him about it, He replied, "Eat it as it is Halal (i.e.
 it is legal to eat it)."
