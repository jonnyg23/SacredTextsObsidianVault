 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:661</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 While the Prophet was with one of his wives, one of the mothers of the
 believers (i.e. one of his wives) sent a wooden bowl containing food 
 with a servant. The wife (in whose house he was sitting) stroke the 
 bowl with her hand and broke it. The Prophet collected the shattered 
 pieces and put the food back in it and said, "Eat." He kept the 
 servant and the bowl till he had eaten the food. Then the Prophet gave
 another unbroken. bowl to the servant and kept the broken one.
