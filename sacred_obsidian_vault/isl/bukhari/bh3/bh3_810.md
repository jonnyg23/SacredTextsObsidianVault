 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:811</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</i></p>
 Once I went to Medina where there was an outbreak of disease and the 
 people were dying rapidly. I was sitting with 'Umar and a funeral 
 procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It
 has been affirmed" (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed 
 by. The people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been 
 affirmed." (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The 
 people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed 
 (Paradise)." Then a third funeral procession passed by and the people 
 talked badly of the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed 
 (Hell)." I asked Umar, "O chief of the believers! What has been 
 affirmed?" He said, "I have said what the Prophet said. He said, 
 'Allah will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good character is 
 attested by four persons.' We asked the Prophet, 'If there were three 
 witnesses only?' He said, 'Even three.' We asked, 'If there were two 
 only?' He said, 'Even two.' But we did not ask him about one 
 witness."
