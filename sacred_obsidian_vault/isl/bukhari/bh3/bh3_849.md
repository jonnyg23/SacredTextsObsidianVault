 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:850</h3><p><i>Narrated Ubaidullah bin Abdullah bin Utba:</i></p>
 Ibn Abbas said, "O Muslims? How do you ask the people of the 
 Scriptures, though your Book (i.e. the Quran) which was revealed to 
 His Prophet is the most recent information from Allah and you recite 
 it, the Book that has not been distorted? Allah has revealed to you 
 that the people of the scriptures have changed with their own hands 
 what was revealed to them and they have said (as regards their changed
 Scriptures): This is from Allah, in order to get some worldly benefit 
 thereby." Ibn Abbas added: "Isn't the knowledge revealed to you 
 sufficient to prevent you from asking them? By Allah I have never seen
 any one of them asking (Muslims) about what has been revealed to 
 you."
