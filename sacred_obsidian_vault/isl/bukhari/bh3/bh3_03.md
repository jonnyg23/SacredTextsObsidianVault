 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:4</h3><p><i>Narrated Mujahid:</i></p>
 Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw 
 'Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some 
 people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer 
 and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many
 times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He replied, 'Four times; one of
 them was in the month of Rajab." We disliked to contradict him. Then 
 we heard 'Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth 
 with Siwak in the dwelling place. 'Ursa said, "O Mother! O Mother of 
 the believers! Don't you hear what Abu 'Abdur Rahman is saying?" She 
 said, "What does he say?" 'Ursa said, "He says that Allah's Apostle 
 performed four 'Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab." 
 'Aisha said, "May Allah be merciful to Abu 'Abdur Rahman! The Prophet 
 did not perform any 'Umra except that he was with him, and he never 
 performed any 'Umra in Rajab."
