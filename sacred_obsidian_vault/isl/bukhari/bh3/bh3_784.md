 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:785</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 A Jubba (i.e. cloak) made of thick silken cloth was presented to the 
 Prophet. The Prophet used to forbid people to wear silk. So, the 
 people were pleased to see it. The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose 
 Hands Muhammad's soul is, the handkerchiefs of Sad bin Mu'adh in 
 Paradise are better than this." Anas added, "The present was sent to 
 the Prophet by Ukaidir (a Christian) from Dauma."
