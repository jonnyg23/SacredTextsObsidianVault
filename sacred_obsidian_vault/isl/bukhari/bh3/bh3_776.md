 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:777</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle owed a man some debt (and that man demanded it very 
 harshly). The companions of the Prophet wanted to harm him, but the 
 Prophet said to them, "Leave him, as the creditor has the right to 
 speak harshly." He then added, "Buy (a camel) of the same age and give
 it to him." They said, "We cannot get except a camel of an older age 
 than that of his." He said, "Buy it and give it to him, as the best 
 amongst you is he who pays back his debt in the most handsome way.'
