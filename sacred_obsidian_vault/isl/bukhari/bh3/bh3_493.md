 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:495</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah's Apostle he would 
 ask, "Has he left anything to repay his debt?" If he was informed that
 he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral 
 prayer, otherwise he would tell the Muslims to offer their friend's 
 funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet wealthy through conquests,
 he said, "I am more rightful than other believers to be the guardian 
 of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible 
 for the repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his 
 death) it will belong to his heirs. "
