 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:116</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 The Prophet observed the fast on the 10th of Muharram ('Ashura), and 
 ordered (Muslims) to fast on that day, but when the fasting of the 
 month of Ramadan was prescribed, the fasting of the 'Ashura' was 
 abandoned. 'Abdullah did not use to fast on that day unless it 
 coincided with his routine fasting by chance.
