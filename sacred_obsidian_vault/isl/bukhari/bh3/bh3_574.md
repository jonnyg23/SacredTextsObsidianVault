 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:575</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A man demanded his debts from Allah's Apostle in such a rude manner 
 that the companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but the 
 Prophet said, "Leave him, no doubt, for he (the creditor) has the

 "The Prophet said, "Buy it and give it to him, for the best among you 
 are those who repay their debts handsomely. "
