 A man came to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! My mother died
 and she ought to have fasted one month (for her missed Ramadan). Shall
 I fast on her behalf?" The Prophet replied in the affirmative and 
 said, "Allah's debts have more right to be paid." In another narration
 a woman is reported to have said, "My sister died..."
 <p>
 she had vowed to fast but she didn't fast." In another narration Ibn 
 'Abbas is reported to have said, "A woman said to the Prophet, "My 
 mother died while she ought to have fasted for fifteen days."
