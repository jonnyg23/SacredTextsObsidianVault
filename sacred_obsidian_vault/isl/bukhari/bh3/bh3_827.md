 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:828</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Uqba bin Al-Harith:</i></p>
 I married a woman and later on a woman came and said, "I suckled you 
 both." So, I went to the Prophet (to ask him about it). He said, "How 
 can you (keep her as a wife) when it has been said (that you were 
 foster brother and sister)? Leave (divorce) her.
