 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:156</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 A man came to the Prophet and said that he had been burnt (ruined). 
 The Prophet asked him what was the matter. He replied, "I had sexual 
 intercourse with my wife in Ramadan (while I was fasting)." Then a 
 basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet and he asked, "Where 
 is the burnt (ruined) man?" He replied, "I am present." The Prophet 
 told him to give that basket in charity (as expiation).
