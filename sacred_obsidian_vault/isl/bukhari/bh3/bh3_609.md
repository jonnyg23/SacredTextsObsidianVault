 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:610</h3><p><i>Narrated Sulaiman bin Bilal from Yahya:</i></p>
 Yazid Maula Al-Munba'ith heard Zaid bin Khalid al-Juham saying, "The 
 Prophet was asked about Luqata. He said, 'Remember the description of 
 its container and the string it is tied with, and announce it publicly
 for one year.' " Yazid added, "If nobody claims then the person who 
 has found it can spend it, and it is regarded as a trust entrusted to 
 him." Yahya said, "I do not know whether the last sentences were said 
 by the Prophet or by Yazid." Zaid further said, "The Prophet was 
 asked, 'What about a lost sheep?' The Prophet said, 'Take it, for it 
 is for you or for your brother (i.e. its owner) or for the wolf." 
 Yazid added that it should also be announced publicly. The man then 
 asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The Prophet said, "Leave it, as 
 it has its feet, water container (reservoir), and it will reach a 
 place of water and eat trees till its owner finds it."
