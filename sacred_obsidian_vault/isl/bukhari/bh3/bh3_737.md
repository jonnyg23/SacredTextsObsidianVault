 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:738</h3><p><i>Narrated Amra bint 'AbdurRahman:</i></p>
 Buraira went to Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers to seek 
 her help in her emancipation Aisha said to her, "If your masters 
 agree, I will pay them your price in a lump sum and manumit you." 
 Buraira mentioned that offer to her masters but they refused to sell 
 her unless the Wala' was for them. 'Aisha told Allah's Apostle about 
 it. He said, "Buy and manumit her as the Wala' is for the liberator."
