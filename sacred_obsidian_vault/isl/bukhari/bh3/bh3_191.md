 I asked Anas about the fasting of the Prophet.  He said "Whenever I 
 liked to see the Prophet fasting in any month, I could see that, and 
 whenever I liked to see him not fasting, I could see that too, and if 
 I liked to see him praying in any night, I could see that, and if I

 "I never touched silk or velvet softer than the hand of Allah's 
 Apostle and never smelled musk or perfumed smoke more pleasant than 
 the smell of Allah's Apostle."
