 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:256</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said:</i></p>
 We practiced Itikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days (of 
 Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our 
 baggage, but Allah's Apostle came to us and said, "Whoever was m 
 Itikaf should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was 
 informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself 
 prostrating in mud and water." When I returned to my place the sky was
 overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the 
 Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and 
 the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees 
 (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose 
 of the Prophet and its tip.
