 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:765</h3><p><i>Narrated Kurib:</i></p>
 the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas, that Maimuna bint Al-Harith told him 
 that she manumitted a slave-girl without taking the permission of the 
 Prophet. On the day when it was her turn to be with the Prophet, she 
 said, "Do you know, O Allah's Apostle, that I have manumitted my 
 slave-girl?" He said, "Have you really?" She replied in the 
 affirmative. He said, "You would have got more reward if you had given
 her (i.e. the slave-girl) to one of your maternal uncles."
