 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:233</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Salama:</i></p>
 I asked Abu Sa'id, and he was a friend of mine,  (about the Night of 
 Qadr) and he said, "We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in 
 the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the 
 morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and 
 said, 'I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was 
 caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last 
 ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself 
 prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l'tikaf 
 with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', 
 and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky 
 but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started 
 leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm 
 leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah's Apostle
 prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his 
 forehead."
