 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:819</h3><p><i>Narrated Zahdam bin Mudrab:</i></p>
 I heard Imran bin Husain saying, "The Prophet said, 'The best people 
 are those living in my generation, then those coming after them, and 
 then those coming after (the second generation)." Imran said "I do not
 know whether the Prophet mentioned two or three generations after your
 present generation. The Prophet added, 'There will be some people 
 after you, who will be dishonest and will not be trustworthy and will 
 give witness (evidences) without being asked to give witness, and will
 vow but will not fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among 
 them."
