 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:854</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "If the people knew what is the reward of making
 the call (for the prayer) and (of being in) the first row (in the 
 prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except 
 by casting lots, they would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew 
 the reward of the noon prayer, they would race for it, and if they 
 knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and Isha prayers, they 
 would present themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to 
 reach there.
