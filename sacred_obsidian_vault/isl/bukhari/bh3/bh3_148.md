 (daughter of Um Salama)  that her mother said, "While I was (lying) 
 with Allah's Apostle underneath a woolen sheet, I got the 
 menstruation, and then slipped away and put on the clothes (which I

 that woolen sheet. I and Allah's Apostle used to take a bath from one 
 water pot and he used to kiss me while he was fasting."
