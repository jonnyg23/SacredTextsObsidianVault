 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:37</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim:</i></p>
 (Abdullah) bin 'Umar used to say, "Is not (the following of) the 
 tradition of Allah's Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is 
 prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the 
 Ka'ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and 
 everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during
 the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he
 should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi."
