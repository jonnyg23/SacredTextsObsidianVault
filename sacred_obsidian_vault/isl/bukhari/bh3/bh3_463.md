 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:466</h3><p><i>Narrated Ya'la bin Umaya:</i></p>
 I fought in Jaish-al-Usra (Ghazwa of Tabuk) along with the Prophet and
 in my opinion that was the best of my deeds. Then I had an employee, 
 who quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit and cut the 
 other's finger and caused his own tooth to fall out. He then went to 
 the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet cancelled the suit and 
 said to the complainant, "Did you expect him to let his finger in your
 mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?"
 <p>
 a similar story: A man bit the hand of another man and caused his own 
 tooth to fall out, but Abu Bakr judged that he had no right for 
 compensation (for the broken tooth).
