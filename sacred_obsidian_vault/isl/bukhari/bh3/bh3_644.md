 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:645</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Beware! Avoid sitting on he roads (ways)." The 
 people said, "There is no way out of it as these are our sitting 
 places where we have talks." The Prophet said, "If you must sit there,
 then observe the rights of the way." They asked, "What are the rights 
 of the way?" He said, "They are the lowering of your gazes (on seeing 
 what is illegal to look at), refraining from harming people, returning
 greetings, advocating good and forbidding evil."
