 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:733</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 That he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian 
 and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is 
 responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and 
 responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's 
 house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian 
 of his master's property and is responsible for his charge." I 
 definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet
 also said, "A man is a guardian of his father's property and 
 responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and 
 responsible for his charges."
