 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:428</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Abu Al-Hasan:</i></p>
 While I was with Ibn 'Abbas a man came and said, "O father of 'Abbas! 
 My sustenance is from my manual profession and I make these pictures."
 Ibn 'Abbas said, "I will tell you only what I heard from Allah's 
 Apostle . I heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be 
 punished by Allah till he puts life in it, and he will never be able 
 to put life in it.' " Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his 
 face turned pale. Ibn 'Abbas said to him, "What a pity! If you insist 
 on making pictures I advise you to make pictures of trees and any 
 other unanimated objects."
