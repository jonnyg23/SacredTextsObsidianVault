 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:523</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amr:</i></p>
 I said to Tawus, "I wish you would give up Mukhabara (Share-cropping),
 for the people say that the Prophet forbade it." On that Tawus 
 replied, "O 'Amr! I give the land to share-croppers and help them. No 
 doubt; the most learned man, namely Ibn 'Abbas told me that the 
 Prophet had not forbidden it but said, 'It is more beneficial for one 
 to give his land free to one's brother than to charge him a fixed 
 rental."
