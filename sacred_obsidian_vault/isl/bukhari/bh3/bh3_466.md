 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:469</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Your example and the example of Jews and 
 Christians is like the example of a man who employed some laborers to 
 whom he said, 'Who will work for me up to midday for one Qirat each?' 
 The Jews carried out the work for one Qirat each; and then the 
 Christians carried out the work up to the 'Asr prayer for one Qirat 
 each; and now you Muslims are working from the 'Asr prayer up to 
 sunset for two Qirats each. The Jews and Christians got angry and 
 said, 'We work more and are paid less.' The employer (Allah) asked 
 them, 'Have I usurped some of your right?' They replied in the 
 negative. He said, 'That is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever I 
 wish.' "
