 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:65</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 A man was crushed to death by his she-camel and was brought to Allah's
 Apostle who said, "Give him a bath and shroud him, but do not cover 
 his head, and do not bring any perfume near to him, as he will be 
 resurrected reciting Talbiya."
