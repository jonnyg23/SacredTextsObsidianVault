 Allah's Apostle said, "A woman was tortured and was put in Hell 
 because of a cat which she had kept locked till it died of hunger." 
 Allah's Apostle further said, (Allah knows better) Allah said (to the 
 woman), 'You neither fed it nor watered when you locked it up, nor did
 you set it free to eat the insects of the earth."
