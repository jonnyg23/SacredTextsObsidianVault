 public announcement about it for one year and if then somebody comes 
 and describes the container of the Luqata and the string it was tied 
 with, (give it to him); otherwise, spend it." He then asked the 
 Prophet about a lost camel. The face of the Prophet become red and he 
 said, "You have o concern with it as it has its water reservoir and

 its owner finds it." He then asked the Prophet about a lost sheep. The
 Prophet said, "It is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf."
