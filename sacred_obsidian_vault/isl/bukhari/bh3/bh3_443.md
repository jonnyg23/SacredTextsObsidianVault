 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:446</h3><p><i>Narrated Shu'ba:</i></p>
 Muhammad or 'Abdullah bin Abu Al-Mujalid said, "Abdullah bin Shaddad 
 and Abu Burda differed regarding As-Salam, so they sent me to Ibn Abi 
 Aufa and I asked him about it. He replied, 'In the life-time of 
 Allah's Apostle, Abu Bakr and 'Umar, we used to pay in advance the 
 prices of wheat, barley, dried grapes and dates to be delivered later.
 I also asked Ibn Abza and he, too, replied as above.' "
