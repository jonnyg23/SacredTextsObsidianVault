 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:644</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 I was the butler of the people in the house of Abu Talha, and in those
 days drinks were prepared from dates. Allah's Apostle ordered somebody
 to announce that alcoholic drinks had been prohibited. Abu Talha 
 ordered me to go out and spill the wine. I went out and spilled it, 
 and it flowed in the streets of Medina. Some people said, "Some people
 were killed and wine was still in their stomachs." On that the Divine 
 revelation came:-- "On those who believe And do good deeds There is no
 blame For what they ate (in the past)." (5.93)
