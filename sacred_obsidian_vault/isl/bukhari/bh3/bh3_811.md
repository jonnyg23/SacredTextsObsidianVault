 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:812</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 Aflah asked the permission to visit me but I did not allow him. He 
 said, "Do you veil yourself before me although I am your uncle?" 
 'Aisha said, "How is that?" Aflah replied, "You were suckled by my 
 brother's wife with my brother's milk." I asked Allah's Apostle about 
 it, and he said, "Allah is right, so permit him to visit you."
