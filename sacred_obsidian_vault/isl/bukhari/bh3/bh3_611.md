 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:612</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 The Prophet passed a date fallen on the way and said, "Were I not 
 afraid that it may be from a Sadaqa (charitable gifts), I would have 
 eaten it."
 <p>
 and find a date fallen on my bed, I pick it up in order to eat it, but
 I fear that it might be from a Sadaqa, so I throw it."
