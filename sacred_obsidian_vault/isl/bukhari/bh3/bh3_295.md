 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:298</h3><p><i>Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "This night I dreamt that two men came and took me 
 to a Holy land whence we proceeded on till we reached a river of 
 blood, where a man was standing, and on its bank was standing another 
 man with stones in his hands. The man in the  middle of the river 
 tried to come out, but the other threw a stone in his mouth and forced
 him to go back to his original place. So, whenever he tried to come 
 out, the other man would throw a stone in his mouth and force him to 
 go back to his former place. I asked, 'Who is this?' I was told, 'The 
 person in the river was a Riba-eater."
