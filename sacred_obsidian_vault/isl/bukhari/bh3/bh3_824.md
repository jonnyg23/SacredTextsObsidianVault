 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:825</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</i></p>
 Some outer garments were received the Prophet and my father (Makhrama)
 said to me, "Let us go to the Prophet so that he may give us something
 from the garments." So, my father stood at the door and spoke. The 
 Prophet recognized his voice and came out carrying a garment and 
 telling Makhrama the good qualities of that garment, adding, "I have 
 kept this for you, I have sent this for you."
