 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:770</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir:</i></p>
 The Prophet said to me, "I will give you so much (the Prophet pointed 
 thrice with his hands) when funds of Bahrain will come to me." But the
 Prophet died before the money reached him. (When it came) Abu Bakr 
 ordered an announcer to announce that whoever had a money claim on the
 Prophet or was promised to be given something, should come to Abu 
 Bakr. I went to Abu Bakr and told him that the Prophet had promised to
 give me so much. On that Abu Bakr gave me three handfuls (of money).
