 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:837</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife before the Prophet of committing 
 illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma.' The Prophet said, 
 "Produce a proof, or else you would get the legal punishment (by being
 lashed) on your back." Hilal said, "O Allah's Apostle! If anyone of us
 saw another man over his wife, would he go to search for a proof." The
 Prophet went on saying, "Produce a proof or else you would get the 
 legal punishment (by being lashed) on your back." The Prophet then 
 mentioned the narration of Lian (as in the Holy Book). (Surat-al-Nur: 
 24)
