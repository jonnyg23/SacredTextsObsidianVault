 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:94</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ali:</i></p>
 We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from 
 the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the 'Air
 Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an 
 heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it 
 will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of
 his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And
 the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured 
 (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in 
 this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the 
 people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship 
 will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as 
 masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs 
 the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his 
 compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.
