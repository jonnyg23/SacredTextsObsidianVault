 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:199</h3><p><i>Narrated Mujahid from 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</i></p>
 The Prophet said (to 'Abdullah), "Fast three days a month." 'Abdullah 
 said, (to the Prophet) "I am able to fast more than that." They kept 
 on arguing on this matter till the Prophet said, "Fast on alternate 
 days, and recite the whole Qur'an once a month." 'Abdullah said, "I 
 can recite more (in a month)," and the argument went on till the 
 Prophet said, "Recite the Qur'an once each three days." (i.e. you must
 not recite the whole Qur'an in less than three days).
