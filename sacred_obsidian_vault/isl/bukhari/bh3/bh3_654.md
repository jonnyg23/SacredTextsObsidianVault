 The Prophet said, "When an adulterer commits illegal sexual 
 intercourse, then he is not a believer at the time, he is doing it, 
 and when a drinker of an alcoholic liquor drinks it, then he is not a

 is not a believer at the time of stealing, and when a robber robs, and
 the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing
 robbery.
