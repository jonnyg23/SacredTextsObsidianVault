 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:715</h3><p><i>Narrated Hisham:</i></p>
 My father told me that Hakim bin Hizam manumitted one-hundred slaves 
 in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance and slaughtered one-hundred 
 camels (and distributed them in charity). When he embraced Islam he 
 again slaughtered one-hundred camels and manumitted one-hundred 
 slaves. Hakim said, "I asked Allah's Apostle, 'O Allah's Apostle! What
 do you think about some good deeds I used to practice in the 
 prelslamic period of ignorance regarding them as deeds of 
 righteousness?' Allah's Apostle said, "You have embraced Islam along 
 with all those good deeds you did."
