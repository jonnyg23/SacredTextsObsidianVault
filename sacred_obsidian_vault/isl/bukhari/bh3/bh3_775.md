 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:776</h3><p><i>Narrated Shal bin Sad:</i></p>
 A drink (of milk and water) was brought to Allah's Apostle while a boy
 was sitting on his right side and old men were sitting on his left 
 side. He asked the boy, "Will you allow me to give it to these 
 (people)?" The boy said, "No, by Allah, I will not allow anyone to 
 take my right from you." Then the Prophet put the bowl in the boy's 
 hand.
