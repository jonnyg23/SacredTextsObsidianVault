 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:302</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ali:</i></p>
 I got an old she-camel as my share from the booty, and the Prophet had
 given me another from Al-Khumus. And when I intended to marry Fatima  
 (daughter of the Prophet), I arranged that a goldsmith from the tribe 
 of Bani Qainuqa' would accompany me in order to bring Idhkhir and then
 sell it to the goldsmiths and use its price for my marriage banquet.
