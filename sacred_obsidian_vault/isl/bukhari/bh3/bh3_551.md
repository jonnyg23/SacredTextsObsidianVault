 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:552</h3><p><i>Narrated Asma' bint Abi Bakr:</i></p>
 The Prophet prayed the eclipse prayer, and then said, "Hell was 
 displayed so close that I said, 'O my Lord ! Am I going to be one of 
 its inhabitants?"' Suddenly he saw a woman. I think he said, who was 
 being scratched by a cat. He said, "What is wrong with her?" He was 
 told, "She had imprisoned it (i.e. the cat) till it died of hunger."
