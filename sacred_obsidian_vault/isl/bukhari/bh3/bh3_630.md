 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:631</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa'idi:</i></p>
 A drink (milk mixed with water) was brought to Allah's Apostle who 
 drank some of it. A boy was sitting to his right, and some old men to 
 his left. Allah's Apostle said to the boy, "Do you allow me to give 
 the rest of the drink to these people?" The boy said, "O Allah's 
 Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the 
 rest of it from which you have drunk." Allah's Apostle then handed the
 bowl (of drink) to the boy. (See Hadith No. 541).
