 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:108</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</i></p>
 When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his 
 companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers 
 remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but
 another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine 
 Inspiration was revealed: "Then what is the matter with you that you 
 are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites." (4.88) The 
 Prophet said, "Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels 
 the impurities of iron."
