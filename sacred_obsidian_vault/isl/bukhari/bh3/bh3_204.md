 The Prophet visited her (Juwairiya) on a Friday and she was fasting. 
 He asked her, "Did you fast yesterday?" She said, "No." He said, "Do 
 you intend to fast tomorrow?" She said, "No." He said, "Then break 
 your fast." Through another series of narrators, Abu Aiyub is reported
 to have said, "He ordered her and she broke her fast."
