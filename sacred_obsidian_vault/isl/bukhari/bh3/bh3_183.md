 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:186</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle forbade Al-Wisal in fasting. So, one of the Muslims 
 said to him, "But you practice Al-Wisal. O Allah's Apostle!" The 
 Prophet replied, "Who amongst you is similar to me? I am given food 
 and drink during my sleep by my Lord." So, when the people refused to 
 stop Al-Wisal (fasting continuously), the Prophet fasted day and night
 continuously along with them for a day and then another day and then 
 they saw the crescent moon (of the month of Shawwal). The Prophet said
 to them (angrily), "If It (the crescent) had not appeared, I would 
 have made you fast for a longer period." That was as a punishment for 
 them when they refused to stop (practising Al-Wisal).
