 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:649</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle took an oath that he would not go to his wives for one
 month as his foot had been sprained. He stayed in an upper room when 
 'Umar went to him and said, "Have you divorced your wives?" He said, 
 "No, but I have taken an oath that I would not go to them for one 
 month." The Prophet stayed there for twenty-nine days, and then came 
 down and went to his wives.
