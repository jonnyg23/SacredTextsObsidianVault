 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:79</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Al-Fadl was riding behind the Prophet and a woman from the tribe of 
 Khath'am came up. Al-Fadl started looking at her and she looked at 
 him. The Prophet turned Al-Fadl's face to the other side. She said, 
 "My father has come under Allah's obligation of performing Hajj but he
 is a very old man and cannot sit properly on his Mount. Shall I 
 perform Hajj on his behalf? The Prophet replied in the affirmative. 
 That happened during Hajjat-ul-wada' of the Prophet .
