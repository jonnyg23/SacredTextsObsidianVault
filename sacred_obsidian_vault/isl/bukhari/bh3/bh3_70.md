 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:71</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat (the place for assuming 
 Ihram) for the people of Medina, and Qaran-al-Manazil for the people 
 of Najd, and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. These Mawaqit are for 
 those people and also for those who come through these Mawaqit (from 
 places other than the above-mentioned) with the intention of 
 (performing) Hajj and Umra. And those living inside these Mawaqit can 
 assume Ihram from the place where they start; even the people of Mecca
 can assume Ihram from Mecca.
