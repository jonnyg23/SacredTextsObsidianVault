 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:592</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian, and 
 responsible for what is in his custody. The ruler is a guardian of his
 subjects and responsible for them; a husband is a guardian of his 
 family and is responsible for it; a lady is a guardian of her 
 husband's house and is responsible for it, and a servant is a guardian
 of his master's property and is responsible for it." I heard that from
 Allah's Apostle and I think that the Prophet also said, "A man is a 
 guardian of is father's property and is responsible for it, so all of 
 you are guardians and responsible for your wards and things under your
 care."
