 <p align="left">To the garden of  wisdom that had grown up and flooded, and flooded, to the wise man whose tongue  bled with abundant wisdom, to him whose adages and sermons lighted up from his  honourable mouth like pearly drops.<br> To the one who filled life with his wisdom, and hugged the minds, the minds of  his companions, and delivered them to the wider upper fields, I mean knowledge.<br> To the one who enriched the Arabic language with his eloquent speech.<br> To the master of eloquent ones and the prince of the wise men.<br> To the prince of believers<br> To him...<br> I raise this little of what was collected from the pearls of his wisdom and the  magnificent of his sermons.</p>
