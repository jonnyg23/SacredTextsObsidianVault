 <a name="an_026_001">1</a> Ta. Sin. Mim. 
 <a name="an_026_002">2</a> These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. 
 <a name="an_026_003">3</a> It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe  not. 
 <a name="an_026_004">4</a> If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their  necks would remain bowed before it. 
 <a name="an_026_005">5</a> Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but  they turn away from it. 
 <a name="an_026_006">6</a> Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of  that whereat they used to scoff. 
 <a name="an_026_007">7</a> Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to  grow therein ? 
 <a name="an_026_008">8</a> Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. 
 <a name="an_026_009">9</a> And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_010">10</a> And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk, 
 <a name="an_026_011">11</a> The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ? 
 <a name="an_026_012">12</a> He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me, 
 <a name="an_026_013">13</a> And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor  send for Aaron (to help me). 
 <a name="an_026_014">14</a> And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. 
 <a name="an_026_015">15</a> He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with  you, Hearing. 
 <a name="an_026_016">16</a> And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord  of the Worlds, 
 <a name="an_026_017">17</a> (Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. 
 <a name="an_026_018">18</a> (Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And  thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, 
 <a name="an_026_019">19</a> And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the  ingrates. 
 <a name="an_026_020">20</a> He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. 
 <a name="an_026_021">21</a> Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a  command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). 
 <a name="an_026_022">22</a> And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast  enslaved the Children of Israel. 
 <a name="an_026_023">23</a> Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ? 
 <a name="an_026_024">24</a> (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them,  if ye had but sure belief. 
 <a name="an_026_025">25</a> (Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ? 
 <a name="an_026_026">26</a> He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. 
 <a name="an_026_027">27</a> (Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a  madman! 
 <a name="an_026_028">28</a> He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did  but understand. 
 <a name="an_026_029">29</a> (Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place  thee among the prisoners. 
 <a name="an_026_030">30</a> He said: Even though I show thee something plain ? 
 <a name="an_026_031">31</a> (Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! 
 <a name="an_026_032">32</a> Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, 
 <a name="an_026_033">33</a> And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. 
 <a name="an_026_034">34</a> (Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing  wizard, 
 <a name="an_026_035">35</a> Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ? 
 <a name="an_026_036">36</a> They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities  summoners 
 <a name="an_026_037">37</a> Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. 
 <a name="an_026_038">38</a> So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. 
 <a name="an_026_039">39</a> And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ? 
 <a name="an_026_040">40</a> (They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. 
 <a name="an_026_041">41</a> And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a  reward for us if we are the winners ? 
 <a name="an_026_042">42</a> He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). 
 <a name="an_026_043">43</a> Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! 
 <a name="an_026_044">44</a> Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's  might, lo! we verily are the winners. 
 <a name="an_026_045">45</a> Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely  show. 
 <a name="an_026_046">46</a> And the wizards were flung prostrate, 
 <a name="an_026_047">47</a> Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, 
 <a name="an_026_048">48</a> The Lord of Moses and Aaron. 
 <a name="an_026_049">49</a> (Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he  doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know.  Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you  every one. 
 <a name="an_026_050">50</a> They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. 
 <a name="an_026_051">51</a> Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are  the first of the believers. 
 <a name="an_026_052">52</a> And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will  be pursued. 
 <a name="an_026_053">53</a> Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, 
 <a name="an_026_054">54</a> (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, 
 <a name="an_026_055">55</a> And lo! they are offenders against us. 
 <a name="an_026_056">56</a> And lo! we are a ready host. 
 <a name="an_026_057">57</a> Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, 
 <a name="an_026_058">58</a> And treasures and a fair estate. 
 <a name="an_026_059">59</a> Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of  Israel to inherit them. 
 <a name="an_026_060">60</a> And they overtook them at sunrise. 
 <a name="an_026_061">61</a> And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are  indeed caught. 
 <a name="an_026_062">62</a> He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. 
 <a name="an_026_063">63</a> Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted,  and each part was as a mountain vast. 
 <a name="an_026_064">64</a> Then brought We near the others to that place. 
 <a name="an_026_065">65</a> And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; 
 <a name="an_026_066">66</a> And We drowned the others. 
 <a name="an_026_067">67</a> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
 <a name="an_026_068">68</a> And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_069">69</a> Recite unto them the story of Abraham: 
 <a name="an_026_070">70</a> When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ? 
 <a name="an_026_071">71</a> They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. 
 <a name="an_026_072">72</a> He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ? 
 <a name="an_026_073">73</a> Or do they benefit or harm you ? 
 <a name="an_026_074">74</a> They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. 
 <a name="an_026_075">75</a> He said: See now that which ye worship, 
 <a name="an_026_076">76</a> Ye and your forefathers! 
 <a name="an_026_077">77</a> Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, 
 <a name="an_026_078">78</a> Who created me, and He doth guide me, 
 <a name="an_026_079">79</a> And Who feedeth me and watereth me. 
 <a name="an_026_080">80</a> And when I sicken, then He healeth me, 
 <a name="an_026_081">81</a> And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), 
 <a name="an_026_082">82</a> And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. 
 <a name="an_026_083">83</a> My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. 
 <a name="an_026_084">84</a> And give unto me a good report in later generations. 
 <a name="an_026_085">85</a> And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, 
 <a name="an_026_086">86</a> And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err. 
 <a name="an_026_087">87</a> And abase me not on the day when they are raised, 
 <a name="an_026_088">88</a> The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man) 
 <a name="an_026_089">89</a> Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart. 
 <a name="an_026_090">90</a> And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_026_091">91</a> And hell will appear plainly to the erring. 
 <a name="an_026_092">92</a> And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship 
 <a name="an_026_093">93</a> Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ? 
 <a name="an_026_094">94</a> Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers 
 <a name="an_026_095">95</a> And the hosts of Iblis, together. 
 <a name="an_026_096">96</a> And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: 
 <a name="an_026_097">97</a> By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest 
 <a name="an_026_098">98</a> When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_026_099">99</a> It was but the guilty who misled us. 
 <a name="an_026_100">100</a> Now we have no intercessors 
 <a name="an_026_101">101</a> Nor any loving friend. 
 <a name="an_026_102">102</a> Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers! 
 <a name="an_026_103">103</a> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers! 
 <a name="an_026_104">104</a> And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_105">105</a> Noah's folk denied the messengers (of Allah), 
 <a name="an_026_106">106</a> When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
 <a name="an_026_107">107</a> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
 <a name="an_026_108">108</a> So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
 <a name="an_026_109">109</a> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_026_110">110</a> So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
 <a name="an_026_111">111</a> They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow  thee ? 
 <a name="an_026_112">112</a> He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in  the past) ? 
 <a name="an_026_113">113</a> Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; 
 <a name="an_026_114">114</a> And I am not (here) to repulse believers. 
 <a name="an_026_115">115</a> I am only a plain warner. 
 <a name="an_026_116">116</a> They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned  (to death). 
 <a name="an_026_117">117</a> He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. 
 <a name="an_026_118">118</a> Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and  those believers who are with me. 
 <a name="an_026_119">119</a> And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. 
 <a name="an_026_120">120</a> Then afterward We drowned the others. 
 <a name="an_026_121">121</a> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
 <a name="an_026_122">122</a> And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_123">123</a> (The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah). 
 <a name="an_026_124">124</a> When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
 <a name="an_026_125">125</a> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
 <a name="an_026_126">126</a> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
 <a name="an_026_127">127</a> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_026_128">128</a> Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ? 
 <a name="an_026_129">129</a> And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ? 
 <a name="an_026_130">130</a> And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ? 
 <a name="an_026_131">131</a> Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
 <a name="an_026_132">132</a> Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that  ye know, 
 <a name="an_026_133">133</a> Hath aided you with cattle and sons. 
 <a name="an_026_134">134</a> And gardens and watersprings. 
 <a name="an_026_135">135</a> Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day. 
 <a name="an_026_136">136</a> They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who  preach; 
 <a name="an_026_137">137</a> This is but a fable of the men of old, 
 <a name="an_026_138">138</a> And we shall not be doomed. 
 <a name="an_026_139">139</a> And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a  portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
 <a name="an_026_140">140</a> And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_141">141</a> (The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah) 
 <a name="an_026_142">142</a> When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
 <a name="an_026_143">143</a> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
 <a name="an_026_144">144</a> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
 <a name="an_026_145">145</a> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_026_146">146</a> Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us, 
 <a name="an_026_147">147</a> In gardens and watersprings. 
 <a name="an_026_148">148</a> And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees, 
 <a name="an_026_149">149</a> Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ? 
 <a name="an_026_150">150</a> Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me, 
 <a name="an_026_151">151</a> And obey not the command of the prodigal, 
 <a name="an_026_152">152</a> Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not. 
 <a name="an_026_153">153</a> They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; 
 <a name="an_026_154">154</a> Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful. 
 <a name="an_026_155">155</a> He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well),  and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day. 
 <a name="an_026_156">156</a> And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful  day. 
 <a name="an_026_157">157</a> But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent. 
 <a name="an_026_158">158</a> So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of  them are not believers. 
 <a name="an_026_159">159</a> And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_160">160</a> The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah), 
 <a name="an_026_161">161</a> When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
 <a name="an_026_162">162</a> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
 <a name="an_026_163">163</a> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
 <a name="an_026_164">164</a> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_026_165">165</a> What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males, 
 <a name="an_026_166">166</a> And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward  folk. 
 <a name="an_026_167">167</a> They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast. 
 <a name="an_026_168">168</a> He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct. 
 <a name="an_026_169">169</a> My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do. 
 <a name="an_026_170">170</a> So We saved him and his household, every one, 
 <a name="an_026_171">171</a> Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. 
 <a name="an_026_172">172</a> Then afterward We destroyed the others. 
 <a name="an_026_173">173</a> And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have  been warned. 
 <a name="an_026_174">174</a> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
 <a name="an_026_175">175</a> And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_176">176</a> The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah), 
 <a name="an_026_177">177</a> When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
 <a name="an_026_178">178</a> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
 <a name="an_026_179">179</a> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
 <a name="an_026_180">180</a> And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of  the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_026_181">181</a> Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due). 
 <a name="an_026_182">182</a> And weigh with the true balance. 
 <a name="an_026_183">183</a> Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the  earth. 
 <a name="an_026_184">184</a> And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the  men of old. 
 <a name="an_026_185">185</a> They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; 
 <a name="an_026_186">186</a> Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. 
 <a name="an_026_187">187</a> Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful. 
 <a name="an_026_188">188</a> He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_026_189">189</a> But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of  gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day. 
 <a name="an_026_190">190</a> Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. 
 <a name="an_026_191">191</a> And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_192">192</a> And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds, 
 <a name="an_026_193">193</a> Which the True Spirit hath brought down 
 <a name="an_026_194">194</a> Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners, 
 <a name="an_026_195">195</a> In plain Arabic speech. 
 <a name="an_026_196">196</a> And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old. 
 <a name="an_026_197">197</a> Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ? 
 <a name="an_026_198">198</a> And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, 
 <a name="an_026_199">199</a> And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it. 
 <a name="an_026_200">200</a> Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty. 
 <a name="an_026_201">201</a> They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom, 
 <a name="an_026_202">202</a> So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not. 
 <a name="an_026_203">203</a> Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ? 
 <a name="an_026_204">204</a> Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ? 
 <a name="an_026_205">205</a> Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years, 
 <a name="an_026_206">206</a> And then cometh that which they were promised, 
 <a name="an_026_207">207</a> (How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ? 
 <a name="an_026_208">208</a> And We destroyed no township but it had its warners 
 <a name="an_026_209">209</a> For reminder, for We never were oppressors. 
 <a name="an_026_210">210</a> The devils did not bring it down. 
 <a name="an_026_211">211</a> It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power, 
 <a name="an_026_212">212</a> Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing. 
 <a name="an_026_213">213</a> Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed. 
 <a name="an_026_214">214</a> And warn thy tribe of near kindred, 
 <a name="an_026_215">215</a> And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee. 
 <a name="an_026_216">216</a> And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they  do. 
 <a name="an_026_217">217</a> And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_026_218">218</a> Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray) 
 <a name="an_026_219">219</a> And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship). 
 <a name="an_026_220">220</a> Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower. 
 <a name="an_026_221">221</a> Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ? 
 <a name="an_026_222">222</a> They descend on every sinful, false one. 
 <a name="an_026_223">223</a> They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars. 
 <a name="an_026_224">224</a> As for poets, the erring follow them. 
 <a name="an_026_225">225</a> Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley, 
 <a name="an_026_226">226</a> And how they say that which they do not ? 
 <a name="an_026_227">227</a> Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and  vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come  to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!
