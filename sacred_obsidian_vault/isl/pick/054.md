 <h1 align="CENTER">54. al-Qamar: The Moon</h1>
 <a name="an_054_001">1</a> The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain. 
 <a name="an_054_002">2</a> And if they behold a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion. 
 <a name="an_054_003">3</a> They denied (the Truth) and followed their own lusts. Yet everything will  come to a decision 
 <a name="an_054_004">4</a> And surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should  deter, 
 <a name="an_054_005">5</a> Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not. 
 <a name="an_054_006">6</a> So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the day when the Summoner  summoneth unto a painful thing. 
 <a name="an_054_007">7</a> With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts  spread abroad, 
 <a name="an_054_008">8</a> Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day. 
 <a name="an_054_009">9</a> The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A  madman; and he was repulsed. 
 <a name="an_054_010">10</a> So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help. 
 <a name="an_054_011">11</a> Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water 
 <a name="an_054_012">12</a> And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a  predestined purpose. 
 <a name="an_054_013">13</a> And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails, 
 <a name="an_054_014">14</a> That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight, as a reward for him who was  rejected. 
 <a name="an_054_015">15</a> And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth ? 
 <a name="an_054_016">16</a> Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! 
 <a name="an_054_017">17</a> And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
 <a name="an_054_018">18</a> (The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My  punishment after My warnings. 
 <a name="an_054_019">19</a> Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity, 
 <a name="an_054_020">20</a> Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees. 
 <a name="an_054_021">21</a> Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! 
 <a name="an_054_022">22</a> And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
 <a name="an_054_023">23</a> (The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings 
 <a name="an_054_024">24</a> For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow ?  Then indeed we should fall into error and madness. 
 <a name="an_054_025">25</a> Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us ? Nay, but he is  a rash liar. 
 <a name="an_054_026">26</a> (Unto their warner it was said): To-morrow they will know who is the rash  liar. 
 <a name="an_054_027">27</a> Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have  patience; 
 <a name="an_054_028">28</a> And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them.  Every drinking will be witnessed. 
 <a name="an_054_029">29</a> But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung (her). 
 <a name="an_054_030">30</a> Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! 
 <a name="an_054_031">31</a> Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs  (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold. 
 <a name="an_054_032">32</a> And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
 <a name="an_054_033">33</a> The folk of Lot rejected warnings. 
 <a name="an_054_034">34</a> Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them (all) save the family of Lot, whom  We rescued in the last watch of the night, 
 <a name="an_054_035">35</a> As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks. 
 <a name="an_054_036">36</a> And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the  warnings. 
 <a name="an_054_037">37</a> They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their  eyes (and said): Taste now My punishment after My warnings! 
 <a name="an_054_038">38</a> And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning. 
 <a name="an_054_039">39</a> Now taste My punishment after My warnings! 
 <a name="an_054_040">40</a> And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
 <a name="an_054_041">41</a> And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh 
 <a name="an_054_042">42</a> Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the  grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful. 
 <a name="an_054_043">43</a> Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the  scriptures ? 
 <a name="an_054_044">44</a> Or say they: We are a host victorious ? 
 <a name="an_054_045">45</a> The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee. 
 <a name="an_054_046">46</a> Nay, but the Hour (of doom) is their appointed tryst, and the Hour will be  more wretched and more bitter (than their earthly failure). 
 <a name="an_054_047">47</a> Lo! the guilty are in error and madness. 
 <a name="an_054_048">48</a> On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces (it is said  unto them): Feel the touch of hell. 
 <a name="an_054_049">49</a> Lo! We have created every thing by measure. 
 <a name="an_054_050">50</a> And Our commandment is but one (commandment), as the twinkling of an  eye. 
 <a name="an_054_051">51</a> And verily We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that  remembereth ? 
 <a name="an_054_052">52</a> And every thing they did is in the scriptures, 
 <a name="an_054_053">53</a> And every small and great thing is recorded. 
 <a name="an_054_054">54</a> Lo! the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers, 
 <a name="an_054_055">55</a> Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King.
