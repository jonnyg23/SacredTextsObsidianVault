 <h1 align="CENTER">56. al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming</h1>
 <a name="an_056_001">1</a> When the event befalleth - 
 <a name="an_056_002">2</a> There is no denying that it will befall - 
 <a name="an_056_003">3</a> Abasing (some), exalting (others); 
 <a name="an_056_004">4</a> When the earth is shaken with a shock 
 <a name="an_056_005">5</a> And the hills are ground to powder 
 <a name="an_056_006">6</a> So that they become a scattered dust, 
 <a name="an_056_007">7</a> And ye will be three kinds: 
 <a name="an_056_008">8</a> (First) those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ? 
 <a name="an_056_009">9</a> And (then) those on the left hand; what of those on the left hand ? 
 <a name="an_056_010">10</a> And the foremost in the race, the foremost in the race: 
 <a name="an_056_011">11</a> Those are they who will be brought nigh 
 <a name="an_056_012">12</a> In gardens of delight; 
 <a name="an_056_013">13</a> A multitude of those of old 
 <a name="an_056_014">14</a> And a few of those of later time. 
 <a name="an_056_015">15</a> On lined couches, 
 <a name="an_056_016">16</a> Reclining therein face to face. 
 <a name="an_056_017">17</a> There wait on them immortal youths 
 <a name="an_056_018">18</a> With bowls and ewers and a cup from a pure spring 
 <a name="an_056_019">19</a> Wherefrom they get no aching of the head nor any madness, 
 <a name="an_056_020">20</a> And fruit that they prefer 
 <a name="an_056_021">21</a> And flesh of fowls that they desire. 
 <a name="an_056_022">22</a> And (there are) fair ones with wide, lovely eyes, 
 <a name="an_056_023">23</a> Like unto hidden pearls, 
 <a name="an_056_024">24</a> Reward for what they used to do. 
 <a name="an_056_025">25</a> There hear they no vain speaking nor recrimination 
 <a name="an_056_026">26</a> (Naught) but the saying: Peace, (and again) Peace. 
 <a name="an_056_027">27</a> And those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ? 
 <a name="an_056_028">28</a> Among thornless lote-trees 
 <a name="an_056_029">29</a> And clustered plantains, 
 <a name="an_056_030">30</a> And spreading shade, 
 <a name="an_056_031">31</a> And water gushing, 
 <a name="an_056_032">32</a> And fruit in plenty 
 <a name="an_056_033">33</a> Neither out of reach nor yet forbidden, 
 <a name="an_056_034">34</a> And raised couches; 
 <a name="an_056_035">35</a> Lo! We have created them a (new) creation 
 <a name="an_056_036">36</a> And made them virgins, 
 <a name="an_056_037">37</a> Lovers, friends, 
 <a name="an_056_038">38</a> For those on the right hand; 
 <a name="an_056_039">39</a> A multitude of those of old 
 <a name="an_056_040">40</a> And a multitude of those of later time. 
 <a name="an_056_041">41</a> And those on the left hand: What of those on the left hand ? 
 <a name="an_056_042">42</a> In scorching wind and scalding water 
 <a name="an_056_043">43</a> And shadow of black smoke, 
 <a name="an_056_044">44</a> Neither cool nor refreshing. 
 <a name="an_056_045">45</a> Lo! heretofore they were effete with luxury 
 <a name="an_056_046">46</a> And used to persist in the awful sin. 
 <a name="an_056_047">47</a> And they used to say: When we are dead and have become dust and bones,  shall we then, forsooth, be raised again, 
 <a name="an_056_048">48</a> And also our forefathers ? 
 <a name="an_056_049">49</a> Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! those of old and those of later time 
 <a name="an_056_050">50</a> Will all be brought together to the tryst of an appointed day. 
 <a name="an_056_051">51</a> Then lo! ye, the erring, the deniers, 
 <a name="an_056_052">52</a> Ye verily will eat of a tree called Zaqqum 
 <a name="an_056_053">53</a> And will fill your bellies therewith; 
 <a name="an_056_054">54</a> And thereon ye will drink of boiling water, 
 <a name="an_056_055">55</a> Drinking even as the camel drinketh. 
 <a name="an_056_056">56</a> This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgment. 
 <a name="an_056_057">57</a> We created you. Will ye then admit the truth ? 
 <a name="an_056_058">58</a> Have ye seen that which ye emit ? 
 <a name="an_056_059">59</a> Do ye create it or are We the Creator ? 
 <a name="an_056_060">60</a> We mete out death among you, and We are not to be outrun, 
 <a name="an_056_061">61</a> That We may transfigure you and make you what ye know not. 
 <a name="an_056_062">62</a> And verily ye know the first creation. Why, then, do ye not reflect ? 
 <a name="an_056_063">63</a> Have ye seen that which ye cultivate ? 
 <a name="an_056_064">64</a> Is it ye who foster it, or are We the Fosterer ? 
 <a name="an_056_065">65</a> If We willed, We verily could make it chaff, then would ye cease not to  exclaim: 
 <a name="an_056_066">66</a> Lo! we are laden with debt! 
 <a name="an_056_067">67</a> Nay, but we are deprived! 
 <a name="an_056_068">68</a> Have ye observed the water which ye drink ? 
 <a name="an_056_069">69</a> Is it ye who shed it from the raincloud, or are We the Shedder ? 
 <a name="an_056_070">70</a> If We willed We verily could make it bitter. Why then, give ye not thanks ? 
 <a name="an_056_071">71</a> Have ye observed the fire which ye strike out; 
 <a name="an_056_072">72</a> Was it ye who made the tree thereof to grow, or were We the grower ? 
 <a name="an_056_073">73</a> We, even We, appointed it a memorial and a comfort for the dwellers in the  wilderness. 
 <a name="an_056_074">74</a> Therefor (O Muhammad), praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous. 
 <a name="an_056_075">75</a> Nay, I swear by the places of the stars - 
 <a name="an_056_076">76</a> And lo! that verily is a tremendous oath, if ye but knew - 
 <a name="an_056_077">77</a> That (this) is indeed a noble Qur'an 
 <a name="an_056_078">78</a> In a Book kept hidden 
 <a name="an_056_079">79</a> Which none toucheth save the purified, 
 <a name="an_056_080">80</a> A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_056_081">81</a> Is it this Statement that ye scorn, 
 <a name="an_056_082">82</a> And make denial thereof your livelihood ? 
 <a name="an_056_083">83</a> Why, then, when (the soul) cometh up to the throat (of the dying) 
 <a name="an_056_084">84</a> And ye are at that moment looking 
 <a name="an_056_085">85</a> - And We are nearer unto him than ye are, but ye see not - 
 <a name="an_056_086">86</a> Why then, if ye are not in bondage (unto Us), 
 <a name="an_056_087">87</a> Do ye not force it back, if ye are truthful ? 
 <a name="an_056_088">88</a> Thus if he is of those brought nigh, 
 <a name="an_056_089">89</a> Then breath of life, and plenty, and a Garden of delight. 
 <a name="an_056_090">90</a> And if he is of those on the right hand, 
 <a name="an_056_091">91</a> Then (the greeting) "Peace be unto thee" from those on the right hand. 
 <a name="an_056_092">92</a> But if he is of the rejecters, the erring, 
 <a name="an_056_093">93</a> Then the welcome will be boiling water 
 <a name="an_056_094">94</a> And roasting at hell-fire. 
 <a name="an_056_095">95</a> Lo! this is certain truth. 
 <a name="an_056_096">96</a> Therefor (O Muhammad) praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous.
