 <h1 align="CENTER">78. an-Naba': The Tidings</h1>
 <a name="an_078_001">1</a> Whereof do they question one another ? 
 <a name="an_078_002">2</a> (It is) of the awful tidings, 
 <a name="an_078_003">3</a> Concerning which they are in disagreement. 
 <a name="an_078_004">4</a> Nay, but they will come to know! 
 <a name="an_078_005">5</a> Nay, again, but they will come to know! 
 <a name="an_078_006">6</a> Have We not made the earth an expanse, 
 <a name="an_078_007">7</a> And the high hills bulwarks ? 
 <a name="an_078_008">8</a> And We have created you in pairs, 
 <a name="an_078_009">9</a> And have appointed your sleep for repose, 
 <a name="an_078_010">10</a> And have appointed the night as a cloak, 
 <a name="an_078_011">11</a> And have appointed the day for livelihood. 
 <a name="an_078_012">12</a> And We have built above you seven strong (heavens), 
 <a name="an_078_013">13</a> And have appointed a dazzling lamp, 
 <a name="an_078_014">14</a> And have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water, 
 <a name="an_078_015">15</a> Thereby to produce grain and plant, 
 <a name="an_078_016">16</a> And gardens of thick foliage. 
 <a name="an_078_017">17</a> Lo! the Day of Decision is a fixed time, 
 <a name="an_078_018">18</a> A day when the trumpet is blown and ye come in multitudes, 
 <a name="an_078_019">19</a> And the heaven is opened and becometh as gates, 
 <a name="an_078_020">20</a> And the hills are set in motion and become as a mirage. 
 <a name="an_078_021">21</a> Lo! hell lurketh in ambush, 
 <a name="an_078_022">22</a> A home for the rebellious. 
 <a name="an_078_023">23</a> They will abide therein for ages. 
 <a name="an_078_024">24</a> Therein taste they neither coolness nor (any) drink 
 <a name="an_078_025">25</a> Save boiling water and a paralysing cold: 
 <a name="an_078_026">26</a> Reward proportioned (to their evil deeds). 
 <a name="an_078_027">27</a> For lo! they looked not for a reckoning; 
 <a name="an_078_028">28</a> They called Our revelations false with strong denial. 
 <a name="an_078_029">29</a> Everything have We recorded in a Book. 
 <a name="an_078_030">30</a> So taste (of that which ye have earned). No increase do We give you save of  torment. 
 <a name="an_078_031">31</a> Lo! for the duteous is achievement - 
 <a name="an_078_032">32</a> Gardens enclosed and vineyards, 
 <a name="an_078_033">33</a> And maidens for companions, 
 <a name="an_078_034">34</a> And a full cup. 
 <a name="an_078_035">35</a> There hear they never vain discourse, nor lying - 
 <a name="an_078_036">36</a> Requital from thy Lord - a gift in payment - 
 <a name="an_078_037">37</a> Lord of the heavens and the earth, and (all) that is between them, the  Beneficent; with Whom none can converse. 
 <a name="an_078_038">38</a> On the day when the angels and the Spirit stand arrayed, they speak not,  saving him whom the Beneficent alloweth and who speaketh right. 
 <a name="an_078_039">39</a> That is the True Day. So whoso will should seek recourse unto his Lord. 
 <a name="an_078_040">40</a> Lo! We warn you of a doom at hand, a day whereon a man will look on that  which his own hands have sent before, and the disbeliever will cry: "Would that I  were dust!"
