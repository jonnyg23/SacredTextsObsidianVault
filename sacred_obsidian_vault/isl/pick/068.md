 <h1 align="CENTER">68. al-Qalam: The Pen</h1>
 <a name="an_068_001">1</a> Nun. By the pen and that which they write (therewith), 
 <a name="an_068_002">2</a> Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman. 
 <a name="an_068_003">3</a> And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing. 
 <a name="an_068_004">4</a> And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature. 
 <a name="an_068_005">5</a> And thou wilt see and they will see 
 <a name="an_068_006">6</a> Which of you is the demented. 
 <a name="an_068_007">7</a> Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is  Best Aware of those who walk aright. 
 <a name="an_068_008">8</a> Therefor obey not thou the rejecters 
 <a name="an_068_009">9</a> Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise. 
 <a name="an_068_010">10</a> Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger, 
 <a name="an_068_011">11</a> Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders, 
 <a name="an_068_012">12</a> Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor 
 <a name="an_068_013">13</a> Greedy therewithal, intrusive. 
 <a name="an_068_014">14</a> It is because he is possessed of wealth and children 
 <a name="an_068_015">15</a> That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the  men of old. 
 <a name="an_068_016">16</a> We shall brand him on the nose. 
 <a name="an_068_017">17</a> Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they  vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning, 
 <a name="an_068_018">18</a> And made no exception (for the Will of Allah); 
 <a name="an_068_019">19</a> Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept 
 <a name="an_068_020">20</a> And in the morning it was as if plucked. 
 <a name="an_068_021">21</a> And they cried out one unto another in the morning, 
 <a name="an_068_022">22</a> Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit). 
 <a name="an_068_023">23</a> So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones: 
 <a name="an_068_024">24</a> No needy man shall enter it to-day against you. 
 <a name="an_068_025">25</a> They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose. 
 <a name="an_068_026">26</a> But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error! 
 <a name="an_068_027">27</a> Nay, but we are desolate! 
 <a name="an_068_028">28</a> The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ? 
 <a name="an_068_029">29</a> They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_068_030">30</a> Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching. 
 <a name="an_068_031">31</a> They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous. 
 <a name="an_068_032">32</a> It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we  beseech our Lord. 
 <a name="an_068_033">33</a> Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is  greater if they did but know. 
 <a name="an_068_034">34</a> Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord. 
 <a name="an_068_035">35</a> Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty ? 
 <a name="an_068_036">36</a> What aileth you ? How foolishly ye judge! 
 <a name="an_068_037">37</a> Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn 
 <a name="an_068_038">38</a> That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose ? 
 <a name="an_068_039">39</a> Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment,  that yours shall be all that ye ordain ? 
 <a name="an_068_040">40</a> Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that! 
 <a name="an_068_041">41</a> Or have they other gods ? Then let them bring their other gods if they are  truthful 
 <a name="an_068_042">42</a> On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate  themselves but are not able, 
 <a name="an_068_043">43</a> With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been  summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. 
 <a name="an_068_044">44</a> Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We  shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. 
 <a name="an_068_045">45</a> Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. 
 <a name="an_068_046">46</a> Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed  ? 
 <a name="an_068_047">47</a> Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof) ? 
 <a name="an_068_048">48</a> But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried  out in despair. 
 <a name="an_068_049">49</a> Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had  been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. 
 <a name="an_068_050">50</a> But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. 
 <a name="an_068_051">51</a> And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes  when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; 
 <a name="an_068_052">52</a> When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation.
