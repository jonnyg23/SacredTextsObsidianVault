 <a name="an_085_001">1</a> By the heaven, holding mansions of the stars, 
 <a name="an_085_002">2</a> And by the Promised Day. 
 <a name="an_085_003">3</a> And by the witness and that whereunto he beareth testimony, 
 <a name="an_085_004">4</a> (Self-)destroyed were the owners of the ditch 
 <a name="an_085_005">5</a> Of the fuel-fed fire, 
 <a name="an_085_006">6</a> When they sat by it, 
 <a name="an_085_007">7</a> And were themselves the witnesses of what they did to the believers. 
 <a name="an_085_008">8</a> They had naught against them save that they believed in Allah, the Mighty,  the Owner of Praise, 
 <a name="an_085_009">9</a> Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and  Allah is of all things the Witness. 
 <a name="an_085_010">10</a> Lo! they who persecute believing men and believing women and repent not,  theirs verily will be the doom of hell, and theirs the doom of burning. 
 <a name="an_085_011">11</a> Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs will be Gardens underneath  which rivers flow. That is the Great Success. 
 <a name="an_085_012">12</a> Lo! the punishment of thy Lord is stern. 
 <a name="an_085_013">13</a> Lo! He it is Who produceth, then reproduceth, 
 <a name="an_085_014">14</a> And He is the Forgiving, the Loving, 
 <a name="an_085_015">15</a> Lord of the Throne of Glory, 
 <a name="an_085_016">16</a> Doer of what He will. 
 <a name="an_085_017">17</a> Hath there come unto thee the story of the hosts 
 <a name="an_085_018">18</a> Of Pharaoh and (the tribe of) Thamud ? 
 <a name="an_085_019">19</a> Nay, but those who disbelieve live in denial 
 <a name="an_085_020">20</a> And Allah, all unseen, surroundeth them. 
 <a name="an_085_021">21</a> Nay, but it is a glorious Qur'an. 
 <a name="an_085_022">22</a> On a guarded tablet.
