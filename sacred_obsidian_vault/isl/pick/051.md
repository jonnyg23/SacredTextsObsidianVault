 <h1 align="CENTER">51. adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers</h1>
 <a name="an_051_001">1</a> By those that winnow with a winnowing 
 <a name="an_051_002">2</a> And those that bear the burden (of the rain) 
 <a name="an_051_003">3</a> And those that glide with ease (upon the sea) 
 <a name="an_051_004">4</a> And those who distribute (blessings) by command, 
 <a name="an_051_005">5</a> Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true, 
 <a name="an_051_006">6</a> And lo! the judgment will indeed befall. 
 <a name="an_051_007">7</a> By the heaven full of paths, 
 <a name="an_051_008">8</a> Lo! ye, forsooth, are of various opinion (concerning the truth). 
 <a name="an_051_009">9</a> He is made to turn away from it who is (himself) averse. 
 <a name="an_051_010">10</a> Accursed be the conjecturers 
 <a name="an_051_011">11</a> Who are careless in an abyss! 
 <a name="an_051_012">12</a> They ask: When is the Day of Judgment ? 
 <a name="an_051_013">13</a> (It is) the day when they will be tormented at the Fire, 
 <a name="an_051_014">14</a> (And it will be said unto them): Taste your torment (which ye inflicted). This  is what ye sought to hasten. 
 <a name="an_051_015">15</a> Lo! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings, 
 <a name="an_051_016">16</a> Taking that which their Lord giveth them; for lo! aforetime they were doers  of good; 
 <a name="an_051_017">17</a> They used to sleep but little of the night, 
 <a name="an_051_018">18</a> And ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness, 
 <a name="an_051_019">19</a> And in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share. 
 <a name="an_051_020">20</a> And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure. 
 <a name="an_051_021">21</a> And (also) in yourselves. Can ye then not see ? 
 <a name="an_051_022">22</a> And in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised; 
 <a name="an_051_023">23</a> And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is the truth, even as (it is  true) that ye speak. 
 <a name="an_051_024">24</a> Hath the story of Abraham's honoured guests reached thee (O Muhammad) ? 
 <a name="an_051_025">25</a> When they came in unto him and said: Peace! he answered, Peace! (and  thought): Folk unknown (to me). 
 <a name="an_051_026">26</a> Then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought a fatted calf; 
 <a name="an_051_027">27</a> And he set it before them, saying: Will ye not eat ? 
 <a name="an_051_028">28</a> Then he conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! and gave him tidings  of (the birth of) a wise son. 
 <a name="an_051_029">29</a> Then his wife came forward, making moan, and smote her face, and cried: A  barren old woman! 
 <a name="an_051_030">30</a> They said: Even so saith thy Lord. Lo! He is the Wise, the Knower. 
 <a name="an_051_031">31</a> (Abraham) said: And (afterward) what is your errand, O ye sent (from Allah)  ? 
 <a name="an_051_032">32</a> They said: Lo! we are sent unto a guilty folk, 
 <a name="an_051_033">33</a> That we may send upon them stones of clay, 
 <a name="an_051_034">34</a> Marked by thy Lord for (the destruction of) the wanton. 
 <a name="an_051_035">35</a> Then we brought forth such believers as were there. 
 <a name="an_051_036">36</a> But We found there but one house of those surrendered (to Allah). 
 <a name="an_051_037">37</a> And We left behind therein a portent for those who fear a painful doom. 
 <a name="an_051_038">38</a> And in Moses (too, there is a portent) when We sent him unto Pharaoh with  clear warrant, 
 <a name="an_051_039">39</a> But he withdrew (confiding) in his might, and said: A wizard or a madman. 
 <a name="an_051_040">40</a> So We seized him and his hosts and flung them in the sea, for he was  reprobate. 
 <a name="an_051_041">41</a> And in (the tribe of) A'ad (there is a portent) when we sent the fatal wind  against them. 
 <a name="an_051_042">42</a> It spared naught that it reached, but made it (all) as dust. 
 <a name="an_051_043">43</a> And in (the tribe of) Thamud (there is a portent) when it was told them: Take  your ease awhile. 
 <a name="an_051_044">44</a> But they rebelled against their Lord's decree, and so the thunderbolt overtook  them even while they gazed; 
 <a name="an_051_045">45</a> And they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves. 
 <a name="an_051_046">46</a> And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they were licentious folk. 
 <a name="an_051_047">47</a> We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent  (thereof). 
 <a name="an_051_048">48</a> And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader (thereof)! 
 <a name="an_051_049">49</a> And all things We have created by pairs, that haply ye may reflect. 
 <a name="an_051_050">50</a> Therefor flee unto Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from him. 
 <a name="an_051_051">51</a> And set not any other god along with Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you  from Him. 
 <a name="an_051_052">52</a> Even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said: A  wizard or a madman! 
 <a name="an_051_053">53</a> Have they handed down (the saying) as an heirloom one unto another ? Nay,  but they are froward folk. 
 <a name="an_051_054">54</a> So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), for thou art in no wise  blameworthy, 
 <a name="an_051_055">55</a> And warn, for warning profiteth believers. 
 <a name="an_051_056">56</a> I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me. 
 <a name="an_051_057">57</a> I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me. 
 <a name="an_051_058">58</a> Lo! Allah! He it is that giveth livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might. 
 <a name="an_051_059">59</a> And lo! for those who (now) do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil  day (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (that  day). 
 <a name="an_051_060">60</a> And woe unto those who disbelieve, from (that) their day which they are  promised.
