 <h1 align="CENTER">63. al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites</h1>
 <a name="an_063_001">1</a> When the hypocrites come unto thee (O Muhammad), they say: We bear  witness that thou art indeed Allah's messenger. And Allah knoweth that thou art  indeed His messenger, and Allah beareth witness that the hypocrites indeed are  speaking falsely. 
 <a name="an_063_002">2</a> They make their faith a pretext so that they may turn (men) from the way of  Allah. Verily evil is that which they are wont to do, 
 <a name="an_063_003">3</a> That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their hearts are  sealed so that they understand not. 
 <a name="an_063_004">4</a> And when thou seest them their figures please thee; and if they speak thou  givest ear unto their speech. (They are) as though they were blocks of wood in striped  cloaks. They deem every shout to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of  them. Allah confound them! How they are perverted! 
 <a name="an_063_005">5</a> And when it is said unto them: Come! The messenger of Allah will ask  forgiveness for you! they avert their faces and thou seest them turning away,  disdainful. 
 <a name="an_063_006">6</a> Whether thou ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them is all  one for them; Allah will not forgive them. Lo! Allah guideth not the evil-living folk. 
 <a name="an_063_007">7</a> They it is who say: Spend not on behalf of those (who dwell) with Allah's  messenger that they may disperse (and go away from you); when Allah's are the  treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites comprehend not. 
 <a name="an_063_008">8</a> They say: Surely, if we return to Al-Madinah the mightier will soon drive out  the weaker; when might belongeth to Allah and to His messenger and to the believers;  but the hypocrites know not. 
 <a name="an_063_009">9</a> O ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you from  remembrance of Allah. Those who do so, they are the losers. 
 <a name="an_063_010">10</a> And spend of that wherewith We have provided you before death cometh  unto one of you and he saith: My Lord! If only thou wouldst reprieve me for a little  while, then I would give alms and be among the righteous. 
 <a name="an_063_011">11</a> But Allah reprieveth no soul when its term cometh, and Allah is Informed of  what ye do.
