 <h1 align="CENTER">80. `Abasa: He Frowned</h1>
 <a name="an_080_001">1</a> He frowned and turned away 
 <a name="an_080_002">2</a> Because the blind man came unto him. 
 <a name="an_080_003">3</a> What could inform thee but that he might grow (in grace) 
 <a name="an_080_004">4</a> Or take heed and so the reminder might avail him ? 
 <a name="an_080_005">5</a> As for him who thinketh himself independent, 
 <a name="an_080_006">6</a> Unto him thou payest regard. 
 <a name="an_080_007">7</a> Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not (in grace). 
 <a name="an_080_008">8</a> But as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose 
 <a name="an_080_009">9</a> And hath fear, 
 <a name="an_080_010">10</a> From him thou art distracted. 
 <a name="an_080_011">11</a> Nay, but verily it is an Admonishment, 
 <a name="an_080_012">12</a> So let whosoever will pay heed to it, 
 <a name="an_080_013">13</a> On honoured leaves 
 <a name="an_080_014">14</a> Exalted, purified, 
 <a name="an_080_015">15</a> (Set down) by scribes 
 <a name="an_080_016">16</a> Noble and righteous. 
 <a name="an_080_017">17</a> Man is (self-)destroyed: how ungrateful! 
 <a name="an_080_018">18</a> From what thing doth He create him ? 
 <a name="an_080_019">19</a> From a drop of seed. He createth him and proportioneth him, 
 <a name="an_080_020">20</a> Then maketh the way easy for him, 
 <a name="an_080_021">21</a> Then causeth him to die, and burieth him; 
 <a name="an_080_022">22</a> Then, when He will, He bringeth him again to life. 
 <a name="an_080_023">23</a> Nay, but (man) hath not done what He commanded him. 
 <a name="an_080_024">24</a> Let man consider his food: 
 <a name="an_080_025">25</a> How We pour water in showers 
 <a name="an_080_026">26</a> Then split the earth in clefts 
 <a name="an_080_027">27</a> And cause the grain to grow therein 
 <a name="an_080_028">28</a> And grapes and green fodder 
 <a name="an_080_029">29</a> And olive-trees and palm-trees 
 <a name="an_080_030">30</a> And garden-closes of thick foliage 
 <a name="an_080_031">31</a> And fruits and grasses: 
 <a name="an_080_032">32</a> Provision for you and your cattle. 
 <a name="an_080_033">33</a> But when the Shout cometh 
 <a name="an_080_034">34</a> On the day when a man fleeth from his brother 
 <a name="an_080_035">35</a> And his mother and his father 
 <a name="an_080_036">36</a> And his wife and his children, 
 <a name="an_080_037">37</a> Every man that day will have concern enough to make him heedless (of  others). 
 <a name="an_080_038">38</a> On that day faces will be bright as dawn, 
 <a name="an_080_039">39</a> Laughing, rejoicing at good news; 
 <a name="an_080_040">40</a> And other faces, on that day, with dust upon them, 
 <a name="an_080_041">41</a> Veiled in darkness, 
 <a name="an_080_042">42</a> Those are the disbelievers, the wicked.
