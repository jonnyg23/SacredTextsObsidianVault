 <h1 align="CENTER">37. as-Saffat: The Rangers</h1>
 <a name="an_037_001">1</a> By those who set the ranks in battle order 
 <a name="an_037_002">2</a> And those who drive away (the wicked) with reproof 
 <a name="an_037_003">3</a> And those who read (the Word) for a reminder, 
 <a name="an_037_004">4</a> Lo! thy Lord is surely One; 
 <a name="an_037_005">5</a> Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord  of the sun's risings. 
 <a name="an_037_006">6</a> Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets; 
 <a name="an_037_007">7</a> With security from every froward devil. 
 <a name="an_037_008">8</a> They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side, 
 <a name="an_037_009">9</a> Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment; 
 <a name="an_037_010">10</a> Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame. 
 <a name="an_037_011">11</a> Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those  (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We created them of plastic clay. 
 <a name="an_037_012">12</a> Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock 
 <a name="an_037_013">13</a> And heed not when they are reminded, 
 <a name="an_037_014">14</a> And seek to scoff when they behold a portent. 
 <a name="an_037_015">15</a> And they say: Lo! this is mere magic; 
 <a name="an_037_016">16</a> When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth,  be raised (again) ? 
 <a name="an_037_017">17</a> And our forefathers ? 
 <a name="an_037_018">18</a> Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. 
 <a name="an_037_019">19</a> There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold, 
 <a name="an_037_020">20</a> And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment. 
 <a name="an_037_021">21</a> This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. 
 <a name="an_037_022">22</a> (And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together  with their wives and what they used to worship 
 <a name="an_037_023">23</a> Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell; 
 <a name="an_037_024">24</a> And stop them, for they must be questioned. 
 <a name="an_037_025">25</a> What aileth you that ye help not one another ? 
 <a name="an_037_026">26</a> Nay, but this day they make full submission. 
 <a name="an_037_027">27</a> And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. 
 <a name="an_037_028">28</a> They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke  the truth). 
 <a name="an_037_029">29</a> They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers. 
 <a name="an_037_030">30</a> We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. 
 <a name="an_037_031">31</a> Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are  about to taste (the doom). 
 <a name="an_037_032">32</a> Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. 
 <a name="an_037_033">33</a> Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. 
 <a name="an_037_034">34</a> Lo! thus deal We with the guilty. 
 <a name="an_037_035">35</a> For when it was said unto them, There is no God save Allah, they were  scornful 
 <a name="an_037_036">36</a> And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet ? 
 <a name="an_037_037">37</a> Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). 
 <a name="an_037_038">38</a> Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - 
 <a name="an_037_039">39</a> Ye are requited naught save what ye did - 
 <a name="an_037_040">40</a> Save single-minded slaves of Allah; 
 <a name="an_037_041">41</a> For them there is a known provision, 
 <a name="an_037_042">42</a> Fruits. And they will be honoured 
 <a name="an_037_043">43</a> In the Gardens of delight, 
 <a name="an_037_044">44</a> On couches facing one another; 
 <a name="an_037_045">45</a> A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them, 
 <a name="an_037_046">46</a> White, delicious to the drinkers, 
 <a name="an_037_047">47</a> Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby. 
 <a name="an_037_048">48</a> And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes, 
 <a name="an_037_049">49</a> (Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the ostrich). 
 <a name="an_037_050">50</a> And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. 
 <a name="an_037_051">51</a> A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade 
 <a name="an_037_052">52</a> Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith (in his words) ? 
 <a name="an_037_053">53</a> Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we  (then) verily be brought to book ? 
 <a name="an_037_054">54</a> He saith: Will ye look ? 
 <a name="an_037_055">55</a> Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell. 
 <a name="an_037_056">56</a> He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin, 
 <a name="an_037_057">57</a> And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled  forth (to doom). 
 <a name="an_037_058">58</a> Are we then not to die 
 <a name="an_037_059">59</a> Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished ? 
 <a name="an_037_060">60</a> Lo! this is the supreme triumph. 
 <a name="an_037_061">61</a> For the like of this, then, let the workers work. 
 <a name="an_037_062">62</a> Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum ? 
 <a name="an_037_063">63</a> Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_037_064">64</a> Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell. 
 <a name="an_037_065">65</a> Its crop is as it were the heads of devils 
 <a name="an_037_066">66</a> And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill (their) bellies therewith. 
 <a name="an_037_067">67</a> And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water 
 <a name="an_037_068">68</a> And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell. 
 <a name="an_037_069">69</a> They indeed found their fathers astray, 
 <a name="an_037_070">70</a> But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps. 
 <a name="an_037_071">71</a> And verily most of the men of old went astray before them, 
 <a name="an_037_072">72</a> And verily We sent among them warners. 
 <a name="an_037_073">73</a> Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned, 
 <a name="an_037_074">74</a> Save single-minded slaves of Allah. 
 <a name="an_037_075">75</a> And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer 
 <a name="an_037_076">76</a> And We saved him and his household from the great distress, 
 <a name="an_037_077">77</a> And made his seed the survivors, 
 <a name="an_037_078">78</a> And left for him among the later folk (the salutation): 
 <a name="an_037_079">79</a> Peace be unto Noah among the peoples! 
 <a name="an_037_080">80</a> Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
 <a name="an_037_081">81</a> Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. 
 <a name="an_037_082">82</a> Then We did drown the others. 
 <a name="an_037_083">83</a> And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham 
 <a name="an_037_084">84</a> When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart; 
 <a name="an_037_085">85</a> When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship ? 
 <a name="an_037_086">86</a> Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire ? 
 <a name="an_037_087">87</a> What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds ? 
 <a name="an_037_088">88</a> And he glanced a glance at the stars 
 <a name="an_037_089">89</a> Then said: Lo! I feel sick! 
 <a name="an_037_090">90</a> And they turned their backs and went away from him. 
 <a name="an_037_091">91</a> Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat ? 
 <a name="an_037_092">92</a> What aileth you that ye speak not ? 
 <a name="an_037_093">93</a> Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand. 
 <a name="an_037_094">94</a> And (his people) came toward him, hastening. 
 <a name="an_037_095">95</a> He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve 
 <a name="an_037_096">96</a> When Allah hath created you and what ye make ? 
 <a name="an_037_097">97</a> They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire. 
 <a name="an_037_098">98</a> And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost. 
 <a name="an_037_099">99</a> And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me. 
 <a name="an_037_100">100</a> My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous. 
 <a name="an_037_101">101</a> So We gave him tidings of a gentle son. 
 <a name="an_037_102">102</a> And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my  dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou  ? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt  find me of the steadfast. 
 <a name="an_037_103">103</a> Then, when they had both surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him down  upon his face, 
 <a name="an_037_104">104</a> We called unto him: O Abraham! 
 <a name="an_037_105">105</a> Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
 <a name="an_037_106">106</a> Lo! that verily was a clear test. 
 <a name="an_037_107">107</a> Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim. 
 <a name="an_037_108">108</a> And We left for him among the later folk (the salutation): 
 <a name="an_037_109">109</a> Peace be unto Abraham! 
 <a name="an_037_110">110</a> Thus do We reward the good. 
 <a name="an_037_111">111</a> Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. 
 <a name="an_037_112">112</a> And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous. 
 <a name="an_037_113">113</a> And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and  some who plainly wrong themselves. 
 <a name="an_037_114">114</a> And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron, 
 <a name="an_037_115">115</a> And saved them and their people from the great distress, 
 <a name="an_037_116">116</a> And helped them so that they became the victors. 
 <a name="an_037_117">117</a> And We gave them the clear Scripture 
 <a name="an_037_118">118</a> And showed them the right path. 
 <a name="an_037_119">119</a> And We left for them among the later folk (the salutation): 
 <a name="an_037_120">120</a> Peace be unto Moses and Aaron! 
 <a name="an_037_121">121</a> Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
 <a name="an_037_122">122</a> Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves. 
 <a name="an_037_123">123</a> And lo! Elias was of those sent (to warn), 
 <a name="an_037_124">124</a> When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
 <a name="an_037_125">125</a> Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators, 
 <a name="an_037_126">126</a> Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ? 
 <a name="an_037_127">127</a> But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth (to the doom) 
 <a name="an_037_128">128</a> Save single-minded slaves of Allah. 
 <a name="an_037_129">129</a> And we left for him among the later folk (the salutation): 
 <a name="an_037_130">130</a> Peace be unto Elias! 
 <a name="an_037_131">131</a> Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
 <a name="an_037_132">132</a> Lo! he is one of our believing slaves. 
 <a name="an_037_133">133</a> And lo! Lot verily was of those sent (to warn). 
 <a name="an_037_134">134</a> When We saved him and his household, every one, 
 <a name="an_037_135">135</a> Save an old woman among those who stayed behind; 
 <a name="an_037_136">136</a> Then We destroyed the others. 
 <a name="an_037_137">137</a> And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of) them in the morning 
 <a name="an_037_138">138</a> And at night-time; have ye then no sense ? 
 <a name="an_037_139">139</a> And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn) 
 <a name="an_037_140">140</a> When he fled unto the laden ship, 
 <a name="an_037_141">141</a> And then drew lots and was of those rejected; 
 <a name="an_037_142">142</a> And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy; 
 <a name="an_037_143">143</a> And had he not been one of those who glorify (Allah) 
 <a name="an_037_144">144</a> He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised; 
 <a name="an_037_145">145</a> Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick; 
 <a name="an_037_146">146</a> And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him; 
 <a name="an_037_147">147</a> And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more 
 <a name="an_037_148">148</a> And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while. 
 <a name="an_037_149">149</a> Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have  sons ? 
 <a name="an_037_150">150</a> Or created We the angels females while they were present ? 
 <a name="an_037_151">151</a> Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say: 
 <a name="an_037_152">152</a> Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie. 
 <a name="an_037_153">153</a> (And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons. 
 <a name="an_037_154">154</a> What aileth you ? How judge ye ? 
 <a name="an_037_155">155</a> Will ye not then reflect ? 
 <a name="an_037_156">156</a> Or have ye a clear warrant ? 
 <a name="an_037_157">157</a> Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful. 
 <a name="an_037_158">158</a> And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know  well that they will be brought before (Him). 
 <a name="an_037_159">159</a> Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute (unto Him), 
 <a name="an_037_160">160</a> Save single-minded slaves of Allah. 
 <a name="an_037_161">161</a> Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship, 
 <a name="an_037_162">162</a> Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him. 
 <a name="an_037_163">163</a> Save him who is to burn in hell. 
 <a name="an_037_164">164</a> There is not one of us but hath his known position. 
 <a name="an_037_165">165</a> Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks, 
 <a name="an_037_166">166</a> Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise 
 <a name="an_037_167">167</a> And indeed they used to say: 
 <a name="an_037_168">168</a> If we had but a reminder from the men of old 
 <a name="an_037_169">169</a> We would be single-minded slaves of Allah. 
 <a name="an_037_170">170</a> Yet (now that it is come) they disbelieve therein; but they will come to know. 
 <a name="an_037_171">171</a> And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent (to warn) 
 <a name="an_037_172">172</a> That they verily would be helped, 
 <a name="an_037_173">173</a> And that Our host, they verily would be the victors. 
 <a name="an_037_174">174</a> So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) awhile, 
 <a name="an_037_175">175</a> And watch, for they will (soon) see. 
 <a name="an_037_176">176</a> Would they hasten on Our doom ? 
 <a name="an_037_177">177</a> But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morn for those  who have been warned. 
 <a name="an_037_178">178</a> Withdraw from them awhile 
 <a name="an_037_179">179</a> And watch, for they will (soon) see. 
 <a name="an_037_180">180</a> Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they attribute  (unto Him) 
 <a name="an_037_181">181</a> And peace be unto those sent (to warn). 
 <a name="an_037_182">182</a> And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!
