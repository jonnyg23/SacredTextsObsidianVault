 <h1 align="CENTER">79. an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out</h1>
 <a name="an_079_001">1</a> By those who drag forth to destruction, 
 <a name="an_079_002">2</a> By the meteors rushing, 
 <a name="an_079_003">3</a> By the lone stars floating, 
 <a name="an_079_004">4</a> By the angels hastening, 
 <a name="an_079_005">5</a> And those who govern the event, 
 <a name="an_079_006">6</a> On the day when the first trump resoundeth. 
 <a name="an_079_007">7</a> And the second followeth it, 
 <a name="an_079_008">8</a> On that day hearts beat painfully 
 <a name="an_079_009">9</a> While eyes are downcast 
 <a name="an_079_010">10</a> (Now) they are saying: Shall we really be restored to our first state 
 <a name="an_079_011">11</a> Even after we are crumbled bones ? 
 <a name="an_079_012">12</a> They say: Then that would be a vain proceeding. 
 <a name="an_079_013">13</a> Surely it will need but one shout, 
 <a name="an_079_014">14</a> And lo! they will be awakened. 
 <a name="an_079_015">15</a> Hath there come unto thee the history of Moses ? 
 <a name="an_079_016">16</a> How his Lord called him in the holy vale of Tuwa, 
 <a name="an_079_017">17</a> (Saying:) Go thou unto Pharaoh - Lo! he hath rebelled - 
 <a name="an_079_018">18</a> And say (unto him): Hast thou (will) to grow (in grace) ? 
 <a name="an_079_019">19</a> Then I will guide thee to thy Lord and thou shalt fear (Him). 
 <a name="an_079_020">20</a> And he showed him the tremendous token. 
 <a name="an_079_021">21</a> But he denied and disobeyed, 
 <a name="an_079_022">22</a> Then turned he away in haste, 
 <a name="an_079_023">23</a> Then gathered he and summoned 
 <a name="an_079_024">24</a> And proclaimed: "I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest." 
 <a name="an_079_025">25</a> So Allah seized him (and made him) an example for the after (life) and for  the former. 
 <a name="an_079_026">26</a> Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for him who feareth. 
 <a name="an_079_027">27</a> Are ye the harder to create, or is the heaven that He built ? 
 <a name="an_079_028">28</a> He raised the height thereof and ordered it; 
 <a name="an_079_029">29</a> And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof. 
 <a name="an_079_030">30</a> And after that He spread the earth, 
 <a name="an_079_031">31</a> And produced therefrom the water thereof and the pasture thereof, 
 <a name="an_079_032">32</a> And He made fast the hills, 
 <a name="an_079_033">33</a> A provision for you and for your cattle. 
 <a name="an_079_034">34</a> But when the great disaster cometh, 
 <a name="an_079_035">35</a> The day when man will call to mind his (whole) endeavour, 
 <a name="an_079_036">36</a> And hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth, 
 <a name="an_079_037">37</a> Then, as for him who rebelled 
 <a name="an_079_038">38</a> And chose the life of the world, 
 <a name="an_079_039">39</a> Lo! hell will be his home. 
 <a name="an_079_040">40</a> But as for him who feared to stand before his Lord and restrained his soul  from lust, 
 <a name="an_079_041">41</a> Lo! the Garden will be his home. 
 <a name="an_079_042">42</a> They ask thee of the Hour: when will it come to port ? 
 <a name="an_079_043">43</a> Why (ask they) ? What hast thou to tell thereof ? 
 <a name="an_079_044">44</a> Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of) the term thereof. 
 <a name="an_079_045">45</a> Thou art but a warner unto him who feareth it. 
 <a name="an_079_046">46</a> On the day when they behold it, it will be as if they had but tarried for an  evening or the morn thereof.
