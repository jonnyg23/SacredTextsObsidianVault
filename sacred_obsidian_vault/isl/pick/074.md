 <h1 align="CENTER">74. al-Mudathir: The Clothed One</h1>
 <a name="an_074_001">1</a> O thou enveloped in thy cloak, 
 <a name="an_074_002">2</a> Arise and warn! 
 <a name="an_074_003">3</a> Thy Lord magnify, 
 <a name="an_074_004">4</a> Thy raiment purify, 
 <a name="an_074_005">5</a> Pollution shun! 
 <a name="an_074_006">6</a> And show not favour, seeking wordly gain! 
 <a name="an_074_007">7</a> For the sake of thy Lord, be patient! 
 <a name="an_074_008">8</a> For when the trumpet shall sound, 
 <a name="an_074_009">9</a> Surely that day will be a day of anguish, 
 <a name="an_074_010">10</a> Not of ease, for disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_074_011">11</a> Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely, 
 <a name="an_074_012">12</a> And then bestowed upon him ample means, 
 <a name="an_074_013">13</a> And sons abiding in his presence 
 <a name="an_074_014">14</a> And made (life) smooth for him. 
 <a name="an_074_015">15</a> Yet he desireth that I should give more. 
 <a name="an_074_016">16</a> Nay! For lo! he hath been stubborn to Our revelations. 
 <a name="an_074_017">17</a> On him I shall impose a fearful doom. 
 <a name="an_074_018">18</a> For lo! he did consider; then he planned - 
 <a name="an_074_019">19</a> (Self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! 
 <a name="an_074_020">20</a> Again (self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! - 
 <a name="an_074_021">21</a> Then looked he, 
 <a name="an_074_022">22</a> Then frowned he and showed displeasure. 
 <a name="an_074_023">23</a> Then turned he away in pride 
 <a name="an_074_024">24</a> And said: This is naught else than magic from of old; 
 <a name="an_074_025">25</a> This is naught else than speech of mortal man. 
 <a name="an_074_026">26</a> Him shall I fling unto the burning. 
 <a name="an_074_027">27</a>  - Ah, what will convey unto thee what that burning is! - 
 <a name="an_074_028">28</a> It leaveth naught; it spareth naught 
 <a name="an_074_029">29</a> It shrivelleth the man. 
 <a name="an_074_030">30</a> Above it are nineteen. 
 <a name="an_074_031">31</a> We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number  have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom  the Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may increase in  faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given and believers may not  doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say:  What meaneth Allah by this similitude ? Thus Allah sendeth astray whom He will,  and whom He will He guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is  naught else than a Reminder unto mortals. 
 <a name="an_074_032">32</a> Nay, by the Moon 
 <a name="an_074_033">33</a> And the night when it withdraweth 
 <a name="an_074_034">34</a> And the dawn when it shineth forth, 
 <a name="an_074_035">35</a> Lo! this is one of the greatest (portents) 
 <a name="an_074_036">36</a> As a warning unto men, 
 <a name="an_074_037">37</a> Unto him of you who will advance or hang back. 
 <a name="an_074_038">38</a> Every soul is a pledge for its own deeds; 
 <a name="an_074_039">39</a> Save those who will stand on the right hand. 
 <a name="an_074_040">40</a> In gardens they will ask one another 
 <a name="an_074_041">41</a> Concerning the guilty: 
 <a name="an_074_042">42</a> What hath brought you to this burning ? 
 <a name="an_074_043">43</a> They will answer: We were not of those who prayed 
 <a name="an_074_044">44</a> Nor did we feed the wretched. 
 <a name="an_074_045">45</a> We used to wade (in vain dispute) with (all) waders, 
 <a name="an_074_046">46</a> And we used to deny the Day of Judgment, 
 <a name="an_074_047">47</a> Till the Inevitable came unto us. 
 <a name="an_074_048">48</a> The mediation of no mediators will avail them then. 
 <a name="an_074_049">49</a> Why now turn they away from the Admonishment, 
 <a name="an_074_050">50</a> As they were frightened asses 
 <a name="an_074_051">51</a> Fleeing from a lion ? 
 <a name="an_074_052">52</a> Nay, but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages (from  Allah). 
 <a name="an_074_053">53</a> Nay, verily. They fear not the Hereafter. 
 <a name="an_074_054">54</a> Nay, verily. Lo! this is an Admonishment. 
 <a name="an_074_055">55</a> So whosoever will may heed. 
 <a name="an_074_056">56</a> And they will not heed unless Allah willeth (it). He is the fount of fear. He is  the fount of Mercy.
