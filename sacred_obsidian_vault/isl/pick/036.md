 <h1 align="CENTER">36. Ya Sin: Ya Sin</h1>
 <a name="an_036_001">1</a> Ya Sin. 
 <a name="an_036_002">2</a> By the wise Qur'an, 
 <a name="an_036_003">3</a> Lo! thou art of those sent 
 <a name="an_036_004">4</a> On a straight path, 
 <a name="an_036_005">5</a> A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful, 
 <a name="an_036_006">6</a> That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are  heedless. 
 <a name="an_036_007">7</a> Already hath the judgment, (for their infidelity) proved true of most of them,  for they believe not. 
 <a name="an_036_008">8</a> Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they  are made stiff-necked. 
 <a name="an_036_009">9</a> And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have  covered them so that they see not. 
 <a name="an_036_010">10</a> Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they  believe not. 
 <a name="an_036_011">11</a> Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the  Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward. 
 <a name="an_036_012">12</a> Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send  before (them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear Register. 
 <a name="an_036_013">13</a> Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from  Allah) came unto them; 
 <a name="an_036_014">14</a> When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We  reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you. 
 <a name="an_036_015">15</a> They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught  revealed. Ye do but lie! 
 <a name="an_036_016">16</a> They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you, 
 <a name="an_036_017">17</a> And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message). 
 <a name="an_036_018">18</a> (The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall  surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands. 
 <a name="an_036_019">19</a> They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of  the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward folk! 
 <a name="an_036_020">20</a> And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried:  O my people! Follow those who have been sent! 
 <a name="an_036_021">21</a> Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided. 
 <a name="an_036_022">22</a> For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto  Whom ye will be brought back ? 
 <a name="an_036_023">23</a> Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish  me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save ? 
 <a name="an_036_024">24</a> Then truly I should be in error manifest. 
 <a name="an_036_025">25</a> Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me! 
 <a name="an_036_026">26</a> It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew 
 <a name="an_036_027">27</a> With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the  honoured ones! 
 <a name="an_036_028">28</a> We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do  We ever send. 
 <a name="an_036_029">29</a> It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. 
 <a name="an_036_030">30</a> Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger  but they did mock him! 
 <a name="an_036_031">31</a> Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which  indeed returned not unto them; 
 <a name="an_036_032">32</a> But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. 
 <a name="an_036_033">33</a> A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it  grain so that they eat thereof; 
 <a name="an_036_034">34</a> And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We  have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, 
 <a name="an_036_035">35</a> That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they  not, then, give thanks ? 
 <a name="an_036_036">36</a> Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth  groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not! 
 <a name="an_036_037">37</a> A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in  darkness. 
 <a name="an_036_038">38</a> And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of  the Mighty, the Wise. 
 <a name="an_036_039">39</a> And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old  shrivelled palm-leaf. 
 <a name="an_036_040">40</a> It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day.  They float each in an orbit. 
 <a name="an_036_041">41</a> And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship, 
 <a name="an_036_042">42</a> And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. 
 <a name="an_036_043">43</a> And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can  they be saved; 
 <a name="an_036_044">44</a> Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. 
 <a name="an_036_045">45</a> When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which  is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). 
 <a name="an_036_046">46</a> Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn  away from it! 
 <a name="an_036_047">47</a> And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided  you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom  Allah, if He willed, would feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. 
 <a name="an_036_048">48</a> And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ? 
 <a name="an_036_049">49</a> They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. 
 <a name="an_036_050">50</a> Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk. 
 <a name="an_036_051">51</a> And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord, 
 <a name="an_036_052">52</a> Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep ? This is  that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth. 
 <a name="an_036_053">53</a> It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us! 
 <a name="an_036_054">54</a> This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye  used to do. 
 <a name="an_036_055">55</a> Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed, 
 <a name="an_036_056">56</a> They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining; 
 <a name="an_036_057">57</a> Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds) and theirs (all) that they ask; 
 <a name="an_036_058">58</a> The word from a Merciful Lord (for them) is: Peace! 
 <a name="an_036_059">59</a> But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day! 
 <a name="an_036_060">60</a> Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo!  he is your open foe! - 
 <a name="an_036_061">61</a> But that ye worship Me ? That was the right path. 
 <a name="an_036_062">62</a> Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense ? 
 <a name="an_036_063">63</a> This is hell which ye were promised (if ye followed him). 
 <a name="an_036_064">64</a> Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved. 
 <a name="an_036_065">65</a> This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their  feet bear witness as to what they used to earn. 
 <a name="an_036_066">66</a> And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that  they should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen ? 
 <a name="an_036_067">67</a> And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making  them powerless to go forward or turn back. 
 <a name="an_036_068">68</a> He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go  back to weakness after strength). Have ye then no sense ? 
 <a name="an_036_069">69</a> And We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry, nor is it meet for him.  This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain, 
 <a name="an_036_070">70</a> To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the  disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_036_071">71</a> Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the  cattle, so that they are their owners, 
 <a name="an_036_072">72</a> And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for  riding, some for food ? 
 <a name="an_036_073">73</a> Benefits and (divers) drinks have they from them. Will they not then give  thanks ? 
 <a name="an_036_074">74</a> And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, in order that they may be  helped. 
 <a name="an_036_075">75</a> It is not in their power to help them; but they (the worshippers) are unto them  a host in arms. 
 <a name="an_036_076">76</a> So let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! We know what they  conceal and what proclaim. 
 <a name="an_036_077">77</a> Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he  is an open opponent. 
 <a name="an_036_078">78</a> And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his  creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ? 
 <a name="an_036_079">79</a> Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower  of every creation, 
 <a name="an_036_080">80</a> Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle  from it. 
 <a name="an_036_081">81</a> Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of  them ? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator, 
 <a name="an_036_082">82</a> But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it:  Be! and it is. 
 <a name="an_036_083">83</a> Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things!  Unto Him ye will be brought back.
