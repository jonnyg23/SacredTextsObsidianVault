 <h1 align="CENTER">69. al-Haqqah: The Inevitable</h1>
 <a name="an_069_001">1</a> The Reality! 
 <a name="an_069_002">2</a> What is the Reality ? 
 <a name="an_069_003">3</a> Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is! 
 <a name="an_069_004">4</a> (The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come. 
 <a name="an_069_005">5</a> As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning. 
 <a name="an_069_006">6</a> And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind, 
 <a name="an_069_007">7</a> Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that  thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees. 
 <a name="an_069_008">8</a> Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant of them ? 
 <a name="an_069_009">9</a> And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were  destroyed, brought error, 
 <a name="an_069_010">10</a> And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them  with a tightening grip. 
 <a name="an_069_011">11</a> Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship 
 <a name="an_069_012">12</a> That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears (that  heard the story) might remember. 
 <a name="an_069_013">13</a> And when the trumpet shall sound one blast 
 <a name="an_069_014">14</a> And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one  crash, 
 <a name="an_069_015">15</a> Then, on that day will the Event befall. 
 <a name="an_069_016">16</a> And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail. 
 <a name="an_069_017">17</a> And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne  of thy Lord that day, above them. 
 <a name="an_069_018">18</a> On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden. 
 <a name="an_069_019">19</a> Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take,  read my book! 
 <a name="an_069_020">20</a> Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning. 
 <a name="an_069_021">21</a> Then he will be in blissful state 
 <a name="an_069_022">22</a> In a high garden 
 <a name="an_069_023">23</a> Whereof the clusters are in easy reach. 
 <a name="an_069_024">24</a> (And it will be said unto those therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which  ye sent on before you in past days. 
 <a name="an_069_025">25</a> But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh,  would that I had not been given my book 
 <a name="an_069_026">26</a> And knew not what my reckoning! 
 <a name="an_069_027">27</a> Oh, would that it had been death! 
 <a name="an_069_028">28</a> My wealth hath not availed me, 
 <a name="an_069_029">29</a> My power hath gone from me. 
 <a name="an_069_030">30</a> (It will be said): Take him and fetter him 
 <a name="an_069_031">31</a> And then expose him to hell-fire 
 <a name="an_069_032">32</a> And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits. 
 <a name="an_069_033">33</a> Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous, 
 <a name="an_069_034">34</a> And urged not on the feeding of the wretched. 
 <a name="an_069_035">35</a> Therefor hath he no lover here this day, 
 <a name="an_069_036">36</a> Nor any food save filth 
 <a name="an_069_037">37</a> Which none but sinners eat. 
 <a name="an_069_038">38</a> But nay! I swear by all that ye see 
 <a name="an_069_039">39</a> And all that ye see not 
 <a name="an_069_040">40</a> That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger. 
 <a name="an_069_041">41</a> It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe! 
 <a name="an_069_042">42</a> Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember! 
 <a name="an_069_043">43</a> It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_069_044">44</a> And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us, 
 <a name="an_069_045">45</a> We assuredly had taken him by the right hand 
 <a name="an_069_046">46</a> And then severed his life-artery, 
 <a name="an_069_047">47</a> And not one of you could have held Us off from him. 
 <a name="an_069_048">48</a> And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_069_049">49</a> And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it). 
 <a name="an_069_050">50</a> And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_069_051">51</a> And lo! it is absolute truth. 
 <a name="an_069_052">52</a> So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord.
