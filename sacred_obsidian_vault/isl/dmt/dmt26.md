   <h3 align="center">I</h3>  <h3 align="center">BOOKS AND ARTICLES, GENERAL AND FUNDAMENTAL, FOR THE STUDY OF ISLAM</h3>  
 <p>The non-Arabist will gain much insight into Muslim life and thought by reading such translations as that of Ibn Khallikan by De Slane (Paris-London; 1843-71), the Persian Tabari, by Zotenberg (Paris; 1867-74), Ibn Batuta by Defrémery and Sanguinetti (Paris; 1853-58), Mas‘udi by C. Barbier de Meynard and Pavet de Courteille (Paris; 1861-77), Ibd Khaldun's <i>Prolégomènes</i> by De Slane (Paris; 1862-68), ad-Dimishqi by Mehren (Copenhagen; 1874), al-Beruni's <i>Chronology</i> by Sachau (London; 1879).</p>  
 <p>The translations and notes in De Sacy's <i>Chrestomathie arabe</i> (Paris; 1826) can also be used to advantage.</p>  
 <p>Very many valuable articles will be found scattered through the <i>Zeitschrift</i> of the German Oriental Society (hereafter ZDMG), the <i>Journal asiatique</i> (hereafter JA), the <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</i> (hereafter JRAS) and the Vienna <i>Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i> (hereafter WZ).</p>

 <p>It is always worth while to consult the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>.</p>  
 <p>The best translations of the Qur’an into English are those by E. H. Palmer (2 vols., Oxford; 1880) and J. M. Rodwell (London; 1871). The first more perfectly represents the spirit and tone, and the second more exactly the letter. The commentary added by Sale to his version and his introduction are still useful.</p>  
 <p>The Thousand and One Nights should be read in its entirety in Arabic or in a translation by every student of Islam. English translation by Lane (incomplete but accurate and with very valuable commentary); Burton (last edition almost complete; 12 vols., London: 1894). Payne's translation is complete, as is also Burton's privately printed edition; but, while exceedingly readable, Payne hardly represents the tone of the original. There is an almost complete and very cheap German version by Henning published by Reclaim, Leipzig); Mardrus' French version is inaccurate and free to such an extent as to make it useless. Galland's version is a work of genius; but it belongs to French and not to Arabic literature.</p>

 <p>E. W. LANE: <i>An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</i>. First edition, London, 1836; third, 1842. Many others. Indispensable.</p>
