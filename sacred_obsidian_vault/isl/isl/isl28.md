   <h3 align="center">5. <i>The Dervishes</i></h3>  
 <p>The word <i>darvīsh</i> (poor) is simply the Persian for the Arabic <i>faqīr</i> (fakir), a word used, along with the North African <i>marabout</i>, for Ṡūfī ascetics and mystics. But "dervish" has come to be applied primarily to the adherent of a Ṡūfī order, or <i>ṭarīqa</i>.</p>  
 <p>The earliest Ṡūfī shaykhs had had their circle of disciples, and with the neo-orthodox revival of the eleventh century Saljūq restoration, the building and endowing of monastic establishments for Sūfīs, as well as the orthodox madrasa schools, became a favorite activity of Muslim rulers.</p>  
 <p>With the thirteenth century A.D. there appeared regular international orders, with daughter chapters, a rule and a prescribed order of <i>dhikr</i>, or <i>samā‘</i>. The first of these was the sober and orthodox Qādirī <i>ṭarīqa</i>, founded about A.D. 1200 at Baghdad by ‘Abd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī. Others followed: Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī's Mawlāwī, or Mevlevī order, the Transoxanian Naqshbandīs, with their silent dhikr or prayer service, the Shādhilī order of North Africa, the Chishtīya of India, etc.</p>  
 <p>With the breakdown and transformation of much of organized society following the Mongol invasions, the <i>ṭarīqas</i> provided a convenient form of social organization, and undertook such disparate duties as civil defense, public relief and public security. In some areas dervish brotherhoods governed cities, organized revolutions and converted pagan tribes. The brilliant Ṡafavī dynasty of</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Persia was founded by a family of Ṡūfī shaykhs carried to power in the early sixteenth century by para-military forces organized as a brotherhood among the nomad Turcoman tribes.</p>  
 <p>At the same time, the orders popularized the teachings of the Ṡūfīs and carried them down to the lowest ranks of the population, though not without some vulgarization and damaging of the original values Ṡūfism had represented, substituting emotional revivalism for interior devotion.</p>  
 <p>Nevertheless, the <i>ṭarīqas</i> deserve great credit: few world religions have tried to teach--or succeeded in teaching--mystical religion to the masses, and the orders provided valuable social services and comforted the common man, besides doing much to color the religious life of later Islam. Professor Gibb puts it succinctly: "Islam in the eighteenth century was like a richly colored tapestry into whose pattern had gone not only Qur’ān and <i>Ḥadīth</i>, shari’ī puritanism, (non-conformist) <i>malāmī</i> ethics, <i>Hallājī</i> exaltation, <i>bāṭinī</i> (esoteric) interpretation, the monism of Ibn al-‘Arabī, the aesthetic sensibility of Rūmī, and the hypnotic or thaumaturgic rituals of the ecstatic orders, but also astrology, divination, wonder-working, and above all, the cult of saints, dead and alive." <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">47</font></a></p>  
 <p>Almost every male Muslim belonged to one or more <i>ṭarīqas</i>, which took the place of church denomination, social club, Masonic lodge, night school, burial association and marching society. Every guild was affiliated with a <i>ṭarīqa</i>, and almost every village supported some resident Ṡūfī holy man.</p>  
 <p>The core of the <i>ṭarīqa's</i> life was the collective dhikr at the lodge, or <i>tekke</i>, where the dervishes under the leader-</p>  
 <p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 170</font></a></p>  
 <p>ship of an adept would contemplate, chant or dance in unison until some fell into a trance.</p>  
 <p>Today these <i>dhikrs</i> can still be seen in some areas of the Muslim world; the observer may encounter things which seem to belong in a case book of abnormal psychology, or witness what looks remarkably like demonic possession. But unless he is wholly unsympathetic, he may find also in these sweating ecstatics examples of pure and devoted attendance upon the Holy.</p>  
 <p>The dervish was not himself an adept, though he might become one; rather, by following the example and practice of the Stiff saints, he attempted to share in their mystical experiences.</p>  
 <p>While the orders today are everywhere on the retreat, their influence remains. The manuals of prayer used by the humble faithful in all the great centers of Islam today, for instruction in prayer which goes beyond the often mechanical repetition of the official ritual prayers, were once composed for the dervishes. <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">48</font></a></p>
