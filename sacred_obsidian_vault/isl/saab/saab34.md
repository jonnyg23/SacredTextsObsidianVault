 <p>Page <a href="saab03.htm#page_2">2</a>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">No Room for Two</span>.—This Súfí Identification with Deity (further illustrated in the Story of Sect. XIX.) is shadowed in a Parable of Jelaladdín, of which here is an outline. "One knocked at the Beloved's Door; and a Voice asked from within, 'Who is there?' and he answered,' It is I: Then the Voice said, This House will not hold Me and Thee.' And the Door was not opened. Then went the Lover into the Desert, and fasted and prayed in Solitude. And after a Year he returned, and knocked again at the Door. And again the Voice asked, 'Who is there?' and he said, 'It is Thyself!' and the Door was opened to him."</p>

The Poet's <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Yúsuf</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zulaikha</span> opens also with this Divine Wine, the favourite Symbol of Hafíz and other Persian Mystics. The "Tavern" spoken of is The World.</p>

He died (as History and a previous line in the Original tell) before Salámán was written, and was succeeded by his Son <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Yácúb</span>.</p>

 <p>Page <a href="saab07.htm#page_11">11</a>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Deluge</span>: in the Kúran God engages to save Noah and his Family meaning all who believed in the Warning. One of Noah's Sons (Canaan or Yam, some think) would not believe. "And the Ark swam with them between waves like Mountains, and Noah called up to his Son, who was separated from him, saying, 'Embark with us, my Son, and stay not with the Unbelievers.' He answered, 'I will get on a Mountain which will secure me from the Water.' Noah replied, 'There is no security this Day from the Decree of God, except for him on whom he shall have Mercy.' And a Wave passed between them, and he became one of those who were drowned. And it was said, 'Oh Earth, swallow up thy waters, and Thou, oh Heaven, withhold thy Rain!' And immediately</p>  
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Water abated and the Decree was fulfilled, and the Ark rested on the Mountain Al Judi, and it was said, 'Away with the ungodly People!'—Noah called upon his Lord and said, 'Oh Lord, verily my Son is of my Family, and thy Promise is True; for Thou art of those who exercise Judgment.' God answered, 'Oh Noah, verily he Is not of thy Family; this intercession of thine for him is not a righteous work.'"—Sale's <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kurán</span>, Vol. II. p. 21.</p>

See <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Frontispiece</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Appendix</span>.</p>  
 <p>Page <a href="saab10.htm#page_18">18</a>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fitting The Cord</span>.—bows being so gradually stiffened, to the Age and Strength of the Archer, as at last to need five Hundredweight of Pressure to bend, says an old Translation of Chardin, who describes all the Process up to bringing up the String to the Ear, "as if to hang it there" before Shooting. Then the First Trial was, who could shoot highest; then, the Mark, etc.</p>

 <p>"Premièrement, à bander l’arc; dont l’Art consiste à le bien tenir, à le bander, et à laisser partir la Corde à l’aise, sans que la main gauche qui tient l’arc, et qui est toute étendue, ni la main droite qui manie la Corde, remuent le moins du monde. On en donne d’abord d’aises à bander; puis de plus durs par degrès. Les maitres de ces Exercises apprennent à bander l’arc devant soi, derrière soi, à coté de soi, en haut, en bas—bref, en cent postures différentes, toujours vite et aisement. Ils ont des arcs fort difficiles à bander, et, pour essayer la force, on les pend contre un mur à une Cheville, et on attache des poids à la Corde de l’arc à l’endroit où l’on appuie la coche de la Flêche. Les plus durs portent cinque cents pesant avant d’être bandés," etc.—Sir <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">John Chardin</span>, Vol. III. 437. He elsewhere says, "La bonté d’un Arc consiste, comme on le dit en Perse, en ce que d’abord il soit rude à bander, jusqu’ à ce que la Flêche soit à moitié dessus; et qu ’ensuite il soit mou et aisé, jusqu’ à ce que le bout de la Flêche soit entré dans la Corde."</p>  
 <p>Page <a href="saab10.htm#page_19">19</a>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Pleiads</span>.—i.e. compactly strung, as opposed to Discursive Rhetoric, which is compared to the scattered Stars of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Bier and its Mourners</span>, or what we call <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Great Bear</span>. This contrast is otherwise prettily applied in the Anvari Soheili—"When one grows poor, his Friends, heretofore compact as <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Pleiads</span>, disperse wide asunder as <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Mourners</span>."</p>

 <p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></a></p>  
 <p>Page <a href="saab16.htm#page_27">27</a> and elsewhere—<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Throne</span> is spoken of as 'under Foot.' The Persepolitan Sculpture still discovers its King keeping his Chair as Europeans do with a separate Footstool. But in Jámi's time The Throne was probably of the same Fashion that Chardin saw Solíman twice crowned on 200 years after—perhaps the very same—"Un petit Tabouret carré," 3 feet high, Golden and Jewelled, on which the Prince gathers up his feet in Oriental fashion, so as it serves for Throne and Footstool too. "Ce Tabouret, hors le Temps qu’il sert à cette Céremonie se garde avec grand Soin dans le Trésor Royal qui est au Donjon de la Forteresse d’Ispahan," where also, to prove the Conservatism of Persia so far as Habits go," J’ai’vu," he says, "des Habits de Tamurlan; ils sont taillés tout comme ceux qu’on fait aujourd’hui, sans aucune difference." So the Mirrors used in Persia 200 years ago were commonly of polished Metal, just as Jámi so often describes. [Solíman's 2nd Coronation came about because of his having fallen so ill from Debauchery, that his Astrologers said his first must have taken place under an Evil conjunction of Stars—so he must be crowned again—which he was—Chardin looking on both times.]</p>

 <p>Page 28. The Pen of "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kûn</span>"—"Esto!"—The famous Passage of Creation stolen from Genesis by the Kurán.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a></p>  
 <p>Page <a href="saab17.htm#page_28">28</a>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seven and Four</span>: Planets?—adding Sun, Moon, and the Nodal Dragon's Head and Tail; according to the Sanscrit Astronomy adopted by Persia.</p>  
 <p>I have proposed "The Planets" for those mysterious "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seven and Four</span>." But there is a large Choice, especially for the ever mystical "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seven</span>"—Seven Commandments; 7 Climates; 7 Heavens, etc. The "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Four</span>" may be the 4 Elements, or even the 4 acknowledged Mahommedan Gospels—namely, The Pentateuch, Psalms, New Testament, and Kurán. For Salámán, though fabled 'not' of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Faith</span>, yet allegorically represents The Mirror of all Faith, and as The original Form of the Human Soul might be intuitively enlightened with all the Revelations that were to be—might even be, in esoteric Sufíism, The Come and Coming Twelfth Imám who had 'read' all the previous Eleven; it being one Doctrine in the East that it is ever the 'Last' and most perfect Prophet who was 'First' Created and reserved in the Interior Heaven nearest to God till the Time of his Mission should come.</p>  
 <p>Sir John Chardin quotes Seven Magnificats written in gold upon azure over Shah Abbas’ Tomb in the great Mosque at Kóm—composed, he says, "par le docte Hasan-Cazy," mainly in glory of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ali</span> the Darling Imám of Persia, but of which the First Hymn "est tout de Mahomet." This has some passages so very parallel with the Sage's Address to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Salámán</span>, that (knowing how little worth such parallels are, especially in a Country where Magnificent Titles of Honour are stereotyped ready to be lavished on Prophet or Khan) nevertheless really seemed borrowed by "le docte Hasan-Cazy," who probably was hard set to invent any new. They show at least how Jámi saluted his 'Alien' Prince with Titles due to Mahomet's Self, and may perhaps light any curious Reader to a better understanding of these Seven and Four. He calls Mahomet "Infaillible Expositeur des Quatre Livres"—those Gospels;—[So Sir John: but the Kurán being one, this looks rather addrest to Ali than Mahomet.]-</p>

"He first made the Mountains; then cleared the Face of Earth from Sea; then fixed it fast on Gau; Gau on Mahi; and Mahi on Air; and Air on what? on <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nothing</span>; Nothing upon Nothing, all is Nothing—Enough." Attar quoted in De Sacy's <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pendnamah</span>, XXXV.</p>  
 <p>Page <a href="saab21.htm#page_32">32</a>. The Sidereal Dragon, whose Head, according to the Pauránic (or Poetic) Astronomers of the East, devoured the Sun and Moon in Eclipse. "But <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">we</span> know," said Ramachandra to Sir W. Jones, "that the supposed Head and Tail of the Dragon mean only the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nodes</span>, or Points formed by Intersections of the Ecliptic and the Moon's Orbit." Sir W. Jones’ Works, Vol. IV. P. 74.</p>  
 <p>Page <a href="saab21.htm#page_33">33</a>. "Iram Garden." "Mahomet," says Sir W. Jones, "in the Chapter of The Morning, towards the end of his Alcoran, mentions a Garden called 'Irem,' which is no less celebrated by the Asiatic Poets than that of the Hesperides by the Greeks. It was planted, as the Commentators say, by a King named Shedád,"—deep in the Sands of Arabia Felix—"and was once seen by an Arabian who wandered far into the Desert in search of a lost Camel."</p>

Hammer thinks) the Concave Mirror upon the Alexandrian Pharos, which by Night projected such a fiery Eye over the Deep as not only was fabled to exchange Glances with that on the Rhodian Colossus, and in Oriental Imagination and Language to penetrate "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The World</span>," but by Day to Reflect it to him who looked therein with Eyes to see. The Cup of their own <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jamshíd</span> had, whether Full or Empty, the same Property.

Firhád was on the point of achieving his Work, when Khusrau sent an old Woman (here, perhaps, purposely confounded with Fate) to tell him Shírín was dead; whereon Firhád threw himself headlong from the Rock. The Sculpture at Beysitún (or Besitún), where Rawlinson has decyphered Darius and Xerxes, was traditionally called Firhád's.</p>

The Neo-Platonists held that Matter and Spirit could have no Intercourse—they were, as it were, 'incommensurate.' How then, granting this premise, was Creation possible? Their answer was a kind of gradual Elimination. God the "Actus Purus," created an Œon; this Œon created a Second; and so on, until the Tenth Œon was sufficiently Material (as the Ten were in a continually descending Series) to affect Matter, and so cause the Creation by giving to Matter the Spiritual 'Form.'</p>
