 <p>O soul! if thou art wise and intelligent,<br> Make not choice of the society of the ignorant. <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a><br> Dart from the ignorant, as it were an arrow;<br> Mix not with them, as it were sugar and milk.<br> If thou hast a dragon for a friend in the cave,<br> It is better than to have an ignorant associate.<br> If the enemy of thy soul be intelligent,<br> It is better than an ignorant friend.<br> From the ignorant proceed nought but bad deeds,<br> And no one hath heard therefrom but base words.<br> No one in the world is so despicable as the ignorant,<br> For nothing is more worthless than ignorance.<br> The end of the ignorant will be the abode of the lost,<br> For the ignorant seldom end life well. <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a><br> It is best that the ignorant should be abased,<br> For it is fitting that the ignorant should find disgrace.<br> It is well to shun the ignorant,<br> For from them will arise disgrace in this world and the next.</p>
