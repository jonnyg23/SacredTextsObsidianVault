 <p>When fortune is a person's slave<br> His heart is perpetually disposed towards obedience. <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a><br> It is not fit to turn aside one's head from servitude,<br> Since fortune is obtainable from obedience.<br> Happiness is procured from obedience;<br> The heart becometh illumined from the light of obedience.<br> If thou girdest thy loins with submission,<br> Thou wilt open the door of everlasting happiness.<br> The wise man doth not turn his head from obedience,<br> Since no excellence is more lofty than obedience.<br> Keep thine ablutions freshened with the waters of obedience,<br> So that to-morrow thou mayest be free as from fire.<br> i Stablish thy prayers with sincerity,<br> So that thou mayest attain everlasting prosperity. <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a><br> Enlightenment of soul springeth from obedience,<br> Just as the earth deriveth light from the sun.<br> Worship the Creator;<br> Sit down in the portals of obedience.<br> If thou makest choice to worship the Creator,<br> Thou wilt be a chieftain in the kingdom of fortune.<br> Raise thy head and keep not abstinence in thy pocket,<br> For Paradise is the abode of the abstinent.<br> Lighten the lamp of thy soul with piety,<br> That thou mayest become happy, like the prosperous.<br> Whoever is clad with the garment of religion<br> Hath no fear for the trials of the day of judgment.</p>
