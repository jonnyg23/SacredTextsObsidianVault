 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> kings of yore a custom had, so I've been told,<br> Of course thou’st heard it;—must remember it, of old,<br> On their left hand their champions took their usual place;<br> Because the heart is on the left of body's space.<br> Their chancellor and scribes stood on their right hand all;<br> In that the writer's art to the right hand doth fall.<br> Before their face the holy teachers stood erect,—<br> The mirrors of the soul;—than mirror more correct.<br> Their breasts they've polished with the acts of thought and praise,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span> That, mirror-like, they catch each image facts may raise.<br> Each object born in nature with a lovely mien<br> Should always have a mirror set to catch its sheen.<br> A beauteous face enamoured is with mirror's glance;<br> Heart's piety's the polish best the soul can chance.</p>  
 <p>A friend of tried sincerity came from afar,<br> And guest became with trusty Joseph;—free from bar.<br> They had been friends before, in childhood's artless days;<br> Had leant their elbows on one cushion, in their ways.</p>  
 <p>His brethren's envy and wrong-dealing touched upon,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> Said Joseph: "’Twas a chain. It bound a lion. ’Non!<br> Disgrace affects not lions, if with chains they're bound.<br> With God's decree I quarrel not;—it's always sound.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m229"><font size="1" color="green">p. 229</font></a></p>  
 <p>A lion with a chain around his lordly neck,<br> Is still the lord of them who forged the chain as check."<br> The friend asked: "How wert, in the well, the prison, cast?"<br> Said Joseph: "As the moon in wane and change at last."</p>  
 <p>At change, the new moon's bent in two, a poor weak thing,<br> But ripens to the full apace, night's matchless king. <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Pearls in a mortar pounded are, by chance, sometimes;<br> Still, they're esteemed a joy to glad eyes in all climes. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span><br> Then, grains of wheat are cast into the lowly earth;<br> But golden ears thence spring, a source of glee and mirth.<br> These, too, are ground to dust in mill;—vile as to show;<br> Increased in value, thence, bread it becomes, we know.<br> Again ’tis crushed between the teeth; to chyme it turns,<br> And feeds the mind, the thoughts, the soul;—in wisdom burns.<br> The soul, in turn, is subject to the stress of love;<br> New miracles, as seen, "the sowers marvel " <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">2</font></a> prove.<br> But truce to these reflections; let us follow now<br> The words of Joseph's friend. ’Tis worth while these to know. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>That conversation closed, said Joseph to his guest:<br> "What gift, my friend, hast brought in token of thy zest?"</p>  
 <p>To go with empty hands and visit friends long missed,<br> Is like a man who goes to mill without his grist.<br> E’en God will ask His creatures in the judgment day:<br> "What offerings have you brought to meet your Maker? Say!<br> Alone, and empty-handed? Is it thus you come?<br> E’en as We first created you? Gifts left at home?' <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></a></p>  
 <p>What have you brought as timely offerings in your hands?<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span> What are the gifts with which you'd grace your new life's lands?<br> Or, was it that you'd no belief in this return?<br> Our promise of this day by you was laughed to scorn?<br> If you denied thus the hope to be My guest,<br> Then dust and ashes wait you in My realm, at best.<br> If you did not deny it, whence your empty hands?<br> How come you to a friend's gate, scorning just demands?"</p>  
 <p>Put by a little from thy daily meat and drink,<br> So shalt thou have a store for offerings’ binding link.<br> "Sleep little" when thou art of those "who lay them down." <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span> "Of mornings," be of them who "ask for pardon's crown." <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Give signs of life, though slight;—as babes do in the womb;<br> So may God grant thee inward light to cheer thy tomb.<br> And when thou ’scapest from dark and narrow prison there,<br> Then mayst thou soar from earth beyond the realms of air.<br> "The spacious land of God" ’tis named in holy writ, <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> The land to which the prophets all have gladly flit.<br> The heart is never lonesome in that vast abode;<br> Its green trees never wither, frosts no leaves corrode.<br> If now thou load thyself with sensual burden's weight,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span> Fatigued and jaded, faint thou’lt prove beneath their freight.</p>  
 <p>In sleep thou bearest no burden; borne thou art, instead.<br> Fatigue is thence recruited;—strength regains its head.<br> Know then, thy sleep's a foretaste of what is to come,<br> From the rapt state of saints arriving at their home.<br> The saints were well prefigured by the "Sleepers Seven." <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> "Their sleep," "their stretchings," "their awaking," lead to heaven.</p>

 <p>Without the least exertion on their parts by acts,<br> The "right and left-hand registers" draw them by facts.<br> The "right-hand register" ’s the record of good deeds; <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The "left-hand register" ’s the list of fleshly greeds. <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">2</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span><br> But both of these abolished are in case of saints.<br> To them such things are but as echo dies and faints.<br> Though good and evil may their echoes round thee peal,<br> The echoing mountain hears them not in the ordeal.</p>  
 <p>Now Joseph once again inquired: "What offering bringest?"<br> His friend, ashamed of urgent pressing, sighed. Thou singest?<br> Said he: "Full many offerings have I sought and seen;<br> But none was worthy of thee; or I much misween.<br> How could I bring a diamond to its native mine;<br> Or add a drop of water to a sea of brine? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span><br> Shall I to Kāshān cummin bring, whence it is drawn, <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> By offering up my life and soul to beauty's fawn?<br> I know no rarity that's not surpassed by thee;<br> Thy loveliness the rarity men nowhere see.<br> The fittest present, then, I've found, a mirror is.<br> And this I've brought; unsullied, bright, refulgent ’tis <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> Therein thou’lt contemplate thy beauteous, matchless face,<br> As beaming as the sun that decorates sky's space.<br> A mirror have I brought, thou charming, witching one;<br> In it admire thyself; and think of me, when gone." <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>The mirror now he drew from underneath his skirt.<br> A mirror is, to beauty, with attractions girt.<br> In non-existence’ mirror if existence gleams,<br> Present this mirror to it, thou, as best beseems.<br> In non-existence mirrored, being we may see;<br> As wealthy men their wealth may show by beggars’ glee.</p>

 <p>The hungry man's the mirror best shows what is bread.<br> And tinder mirrors flint and steel's gleam, quickly spread.<br> Wherever want, defect, is seen, beauty's most prized.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span> The mirror of perfection's then best realised.</p>  
 <p>If clothes grew, ready cut and sewn, to meet our needs,<br> Where'd be the use of tailor's art, to fashion weeds?<br> The unhewn trunk is needed, for the carver's skill,<br> And carpenter, to cut out thence his frames, his thill.<br> The surgeon hastens to the couch where suffering lies;<br> Where limbs are broken, there his bandages he ties.<br> Were there no patient, malady, no fever, ache,<br> Could art sublime, the medical, its marvels make?<br> If humble brass and copper were not to be found,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span> Th’ alchemist's stone could not to gold transmute them round.<br> Defect is thus the mirror whence perfection's seen;<br> And vileness is the foil to show off grandeur's sheen.<br> By contrast does each opposite its fellow show,<br> Sweet honey by sharp vinegar we best can know.<br> The man who sees and feels his imperfections sore,<br> Exerts himself to cure them quickly. all the more.<br> And he'll ne’er take his flight towards heaven's eternal King,<br> Who holds at heart the thought that he's a perfect thing.</p>  
 <p>No worse disease exists, to taint the human mind,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span> Than self-conceit, that paints its owner gold refined.<br> How many bitter tears has not the vain to shed,<br> Ere arrogance can be expelled, and pride be dead!<br> The malady of Satan,—self-conceit:—"I'm best," <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Exists in germ in every panting human breast.<br> These fancy they have mortified themselves throughout.<br> Take them to be pure streams; their filth seek in the grout.</p>

 <p>Just stir them up a little, for a trial's sake;<br> Thou’lt see their mud discolour all the water's lake.<br> There's ooze at bottom of the pond,—be sure of that,—<br> However clear the surface of the dull dead flat. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_70">70</a></font></span><br> Our greatest teacher is endowed with fair device.<br> He digs a conduit in the very soil of vice.<br> How can he make the water of that conduit pure?<br> All human wisdom's but one spark from God's vast store.<br> Does sword inflict a wound in its own handle,—blade?<br> Find me a surgeon who shall cure a gash so made.<br> Where wound exists, the flies will ever flock amain,<br> To hide its hideousness from sight, and lull the pain,<br> Those flies the symbols are of man's vain, baseless thoughts;<br> The wound they cover over's ignorance high-wrought. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span><br> ’Tis only when the teacher salve applies with skill,<br> The throes are quieted that shoot across man's will.<br> He then imagines that his wound is healing fast.<br> Effect this is of cunning used, that salve to cast.<br> O man, whose back is galled, accept his salve with thanks.<br> Thy solace thence arises; not from thy own pranks. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_78">78</a></font></span></p>
