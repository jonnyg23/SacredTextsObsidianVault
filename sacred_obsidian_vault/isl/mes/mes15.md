 <p><a name="fn_54"></a><a href="mes15.htm#fr_55">m1:1</a> The reed-flute is the sacred musical instrument of the Mevlevī dervishes, commonly known as the Dancing Dervishes, from their peculiar religious waltz to the sound of the reed-flute, &amp;c., with outstretched arms and inclined head, in their special public services of commemoration. They love the reed-flute as the symbol of a sighing absent lover.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_55"></a><a href="mes15.htm#fr_56">m2:1</a> There is a poetical Eastern notion by dewdrops or raindrops falling into that pearls are formed in the oysters them at a certain season.</p>
