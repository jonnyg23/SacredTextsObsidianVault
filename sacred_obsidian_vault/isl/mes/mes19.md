 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A second</span> Jewish king, descendant of the first,<br> To persecute the Christians showed hate's fiercest thirst.<br> If information's sought about this wicked king,<br> That chapter of the Qur’ān read: "Heaven's Girdle-Ring." <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> A sorry rite it was the first had introduced;<br> With cruel zeal this wicked rite the last abused.</p>  
 <p>The introducer of a rule that tends to ill,<br> Draws on his head deep curses, morn and even, still.<br> The good decease; their bright example serves as guide;<br> The wicked soon decay; their name all men deride. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span><br> The children of those sinners, till the trump of doom,<br> Are cursed as soon as born; no lot more full of gloom.</p>  
 <p>How many springs burst forth, one salt, the other sweet;<br> Their savour changes, while the days and nights compete.<br> The good are promised their inheritance aloft,<br> Of waters sweet; <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">2</font></a> in Scripture mentioned oft and oft. <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> The seeker's wish, if rightly we consider it,<br> A scintillation is of flame from holy writ.</p>

 <p>No flame exists apart from body whence it burns;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> Where’er the burning body hies, the flame, too, turns.<br> A window-light will wander all around a room;<br> Because the rising sun to sunset tends, and gloom.<br> That which to any constellation's stars pertains,<br> Must move with it, rise, set, south, as its place ordains.</p>  
 <p>The man who under Venus’ influence was born<br> Is joyous, amorous, ambitious, with greed torn.<br> If Mars his planet be, his temper's bellicose;<br> War, scandal, litigation,—these he most does choose.<br> But other stars there are, the planets, seven, beside;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span> And unto men from them nor good, nor ills betide.<br> Revolving in another firmament than they,<br> Above the spheres that bear the orbs of night and day.<br> Bright through the moral splendour lent them by the Lord;<br> Not bound together quite, nor yet in disaccord.<br> The man whose soul is influenced by one of those,<br> Like meteors, still shall drive away the spirit's foes.<br> His disposition feeleth not the rage of Mars;<br> He temporises;—meekly acts in prosperous wars.<br> His light's triumphant;—darkness it shall never know.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span> Between two fingers holdeth he the truth, I trow.</p>  
 <p>The truth doth shed a shining light on human souls,<br> Received by heaven's favourites, in special ghostly strolls.<br> Illumined with that light, as spangles deck a bride,<br> They turn their souls to God, contemning all beside.<br> Who feels not keenly love's great soul-compelling might,<br> Is portionless of spangles from truth's flashing light.</p>  
 <p>All <i>parts</i> must ever share the nature of their <i>whole</i>,<br> As nightingale pours out unto one rose its soul.<br> Whatever <i>property</i> may qualify a <i>thing</i><br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span> Externally, man's qualities are mind's offspring.</p>

 <p>From purity, rich colours rise, good qualities;<br> Stains,—moral, or as dyes,—from gross impurities.</p>  
 <p>"<i>God's Baptism</i>" is the name of all that's good in man;<br> "<i>The curse of God</i>," of all that's evil in our plan. <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> In which of these two seas our streamlets may subside,<br> They but return into the source from whence their tide.<br> From mountain-tops, swift torrents rushing down apace.<br> From men's frames, love-inspired souls, anon the race.</p>  
 <p>The counsel hear, that now, this Jewish dog did take.<br> Beside a fire a hideous idol he did make, <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span><br> And proclamation ran: "Whoever ’d save his soul,<br> This idol worships; or in fire he's burnt to coal." <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Thus having made his hate an idol to himself,<br> A second idol straightway he invents, this elf.</p>  
 <p>The mother of all idols is our fleshly pride.<br> They're dragons; this, the egg of cockatrice's bride.<br> The flesh is flint and steel; our pride is but its spark.<br> That pride pervades the flesh as fecundation's mark.<br> Can moisture quench the latent spark in flint and steel?<br> Can man be safe while flesh and pride he lives to feel; <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span><br> In flint and steel we know that fire is still alive.<br> No water's of avail that fire from them to drive.<br> With water we put out a fire when burning bright;<br> The spark in flint and steel is safe from water's might.</p>  
 <p>From flint and steel of flesh what burnings still ensue!<br> Their sparks, the blasphemies of Christian and of Jew!<br> If water in the jug and pitcher come to end,<br> On wellspring we must draw, a fresh supply to send.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a></p>  
 <p>Our idol is the muddy dregs left in our jug;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span> The flesh the sewer from whence it filters, spite of plug.<br> The graven idol (fed from blackest sewer tide<br> In flesh, its graver), was as fountain by wayside.<br> The inward idol, pride, the filthy jug's black slush;<br> The prurient flesh, the source from which it had its gush.</p>  
 <p>A hundred potters’ pitchers one small stone can break;<br> And spill the cooling water drawn our thirst to slake.<br> To smash an idol, too, quite easy may appear;<br> Not easy to root out the flesh; too hard, I fear.</p>  
 <p>Would see the picture of the flesh, inquiring youths?<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span> Description read of hell, with seven yawning mouths. <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>From each soul's flesh comes forth a special mode of guile.<br> Each guile, a whirlpool ready Pharaoh's hosts to spoil.<br> In Moses, and in Moses’ God, seek refuge then.<br> Abandon not God's faith for Pharaohs and their men.<br> The one true God adore; in Ahmed's faith believe.<br> Thy soul and body save,—from Abū-Dahl retrieve. <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> The Jew a Christian mother to that idol brought.<br> An infant in her arms; the fire with blazes fraught.<br> "Fall down and worship;" cried he, "senseless stock adore;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span> The fire shall then not harm thee, now, nor evermore."<br> That mother was a woman firm in true belief;<br> And thence disdained prostration, though ’t should give relief.</p>  
 <p>They snatched her infant; next, they dashed it in the flame.<br> The mother's spirit quailed to see this deed of shame.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>Though not herself, to save her infant, she'd bow down.<br> But lo! a miracle! The babe cried: "Let alone!<br> Uninjured am I here. Come in. Be not dismayed.<br> ’Tis cool and pleasant. Cease to feel of fire afraid;—<br> Mere blinding bandage to the eyes;—naught but a veil.<br> God's mercy's here revealed,—made manifest. All hail! <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span><br> Come in, my mother, dear. The truth thou shalt record.<br> Thou’lt here perceive how saints hold converse with the Lord.<br> Come in; and witness water blazing high, as fire.<br> This is a world where flame like water is;—not dire.<br> Come. Look on miracles for blessed Abr’am wrought; <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Whose furnace changed to gardens, out of firewood brought.<br> Death then I underwent, when I was born of thee.<br> The fear of death swept o’er me, ere my eyes could see.<br> With birth I ’scaped from prison, narrow, dark, and drear;<br> Emerging to a world, vast, radiant, bright, and clear. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span><br> Alas! that world, you see, is but a second womb.<br> Joy, comfort, happiness, are found beyond the tomb.<br> Within this fire a realm of wonders lies around;<br> Each atom's here a Jesus;—balm to heal each wound.<br> This world I'm in's reality;—not merely form.<br> The scene I've left's all vanity;—food for the worm.<br> Come in, my mother; quick! Seize this auspicious hour.<br> Come in! Let opportunity not ’scape thy pow’r.<br> Come in; come in; in name of parent's tenderness.<br> Come in! This fire has no devouring ruthlessness. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span><br> Come in!

The grace and power of God Almighty prove.<br> ’Tis from my love for thee I thus so much insist;<br> From pleasure felt by me, for thee I've fear dismissed.<br> Come in; come in! And others call, to follow thee.<br> The Great King here His bounteous table's spread for me.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p>Come in; come in! All of you, saints of God, elect!<br> Resigned ones! <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">1</font></a> Faith's cup of martyrdom select!<br> Come in! Flock in; in crowds; as moths around a light!<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_70">70</a></font></span> This year has tens of thousands springs; but not one night."</p>  
 <p>Thus loudly cried the infant from its bed of flame.<br> Th’ assembled crowds all heard it. All were seized with shame.<br> A sudden holy impulse urged them to obey.<br> In crowds those men and women cast their lives away.<br> No force was needed;—no compulsion;—all was love;<br> For bitterness is sweet to all whom love doth move.<br> To such a point it came that guards and soldiers, all,<br> Were fain to cry: "Withhold! The fire is more than full!"</p>  
 <p>The Jewish king at sight of all this love and zeal,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span> Was shamed,—was thunderstruck; his wicked heart did reel.<br> He saw that faith can give the lover's ardent flame.<br> Self-sacrifice is naught in true devotion's name.<br> Thank God! Beelzebub was conquered in that Jew.<br> Thank God! ’Twas Satan's self these darksome deeds did rue.<br> The shame he sought to bring upon the cheeks of some,<br> A hundredfold was heaped on his own head at home.<br> He thought from others’ shame the veiling leaf to tear;<br> He saw them safe, his own foul nakedness laid bare.</p>  
 <p>A ribald fellow once, by lewdest mob sustained,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_80">80</a></font></span> Called railing out on Ahmed. Wry his mouth remained.<br> He then came begging pity, in the Prophet's trace:<br> "Forgive, Muhammed, who’rt endued with wisdom's grace.<br> For want of knowing better, insolent I was.<br> ’Tis I that merit scorn and mockery. Alas!"</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></a></p>  
 <p>When God decides to humble any sinner, proud,<br> A demon stirs this last t’ insult some man of God.<br> And he whom God elects to cloak where ’tis he halts,<br> Has grace bestowed on him to cover others’ faults.<br> Should favour from the Lord in mercy reach a man,<br> Humility is given him; to pray ’s part of his plan. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_85">85</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>How blessed are the eyes that smart with sorrow's brine!<br> How blessed is the heart inflamed with love divine!<br> Contrition's tears are ever hallowed by heaven's smile.<br> The latter end of all things man should scan awhile.<br> Wherever water flows, the fields are fresh and green.<br> Tears followed are by grace;—as all the prophets ween.<br> Then imitate the water-wheel, that groans and weeps. <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> By prayers, and moans, and tears, a man his heart pure keeps.<br> Wouldst thou shed tears? Feel pity, when thou meetest woe.<br> Wouldst mercy find? Show mercy, when men bow them low. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_90">90</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>The Jewish king reproached the fire: "O raging thing!<br> Thy all-destructive might, where is it? Where's thy sting?<br> If thou wilt not consume, what quality hast thou?<br> Or has my fortune veered; and with it, thy dread glow?<br> Thou sparest not thy worshippers, the Magian race.<br> Whence comes it; these who spurn thee, Christians, meet with grace?<br> Thou never wast, O fire, for patience noted here.<br> Why burn’st thou not? What is there? Hast thou lost thy power?<br> Is this eye-binding? <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">2</font></a> Is it, rather, reason's blind?<br> How is’t thy flames consume not all their hated kind? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_95">95</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></a></p>  
 <p>Bewitched thee have they? Or is’t magic natural?<br> Or is’t my fortune wills that thou turn prodigal?"</p>  
 <p>To him the fire: "O miscreant! I'm still the same.<br> Come in and try, thou, how thou’lt find my smallest flame.<br> My nature, as my substance, has not suffered change.<br> Outside my nature's limit I've no power to range.<br> At door of Turkman's tent the savage household dogs<br> Do wag their tails before a guest, and crouch like logs.<br> But should a stranger pass by, near the guarded tent,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_100">100</a></font></span> Him then those dogs assail, with lion-like intent.<br> Less than a dog I'm not, in service to my Lord.<br> Than Turkman less, there's none, in rights, upon earth's sward."</p>  
 <p>When fire thy body injures, and inflicts some harm;<br> Remember, its consuming power can also warm.<br> And when a fire thus serves thee, acts some needful part,<br> Reflect! Those qualities thou seest did God impart.<br> Art injured, ’haps? Fall down; entreat the Lord with prayer.<br> The hurtful power was given by Him in gracious care.<br> Should He so will, each injury a blessing is.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_105">105</a></font></span> Chained captives find their freedom by a word of His.</p>  
 <p>Fire, air, earth, water, all are servants of their God.<br> I, thou, them lifeless deem. He knows they live and plod.<br> In presence of the great Creator fire must still<br> Its service do; and, lover-like, work out His will.<br> Thou strikest flint on steel; fire instantly leaps forth.<br> ’Tis by commandment of the Lord it thus takes birth.<br> Strike not together, thou, the flint and steel of lust.<br> For, male and female like, they'll generate; they must.</p>  
 <p>The flint and steel are means. Far higher raise thy look.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span> With reason thou’rt endowed. Go; read the holy book.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a></p>  
 <p>One means comes from another means; and cause from cause.<br> Without a means or cause, no means from self e’er rose.<br> The means by which all prophets’ miracles are wrought,<br> Of higher order are than earthly means; no doubt.<br> Man's mind can compass how these latter act, and when;<br> The former hidden are from all but prophet's ken.<br> These former ’tis that give the latter power to act;<br> And rarely, that, their normal action, counteract.</p>  
 <p>A means a rope is, by the help of which we reach;<br> And in this worldly pit by means each reaches each. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_115">115</a></font></span><br> Around its coiling cylinder the well-rope's wound.<br> To shut our eyes to this would blind indeed be found.<br> The ropes by means of which results are seen to steer,<br> In this our world, deem not they're moved by star or sphere;<br> Lest thou become confused and giddy like a wheel;—<br> Take fire, consume, like tinder, sparks of shame to feel.</p>  
 <p>The air becomes a fire at times by God's decree.<br> Both air and fire run wild with joy, His means to be.<br> The streams of mercy, the consuming fires of wrath,<br> Thou’lt see, my son, are both from God. Look well, forsooth. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span><br> Were not the wind aware of God's almighty power,<br> How had it ever blown the blast of ‘Ad's <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">1</font></a> last hour?<br> Around his Muslims Hal a saving circle drew.<br> The wind within that mystic circuit softly blew.<br> While all that were beyond were dashed to pieces soon.<br> Like chaff before the breeze, their limbs around were strewn.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p>Shaybān the shepherd, too, a circle round his fold<br> Was used to draw; whate’er the season, hot or cold;<br> On Fridays, when, at midday's sacred hour of praise,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_125">125</a></font></span> He to a congregation hied; lest wolf should seize.<br> No wolf was ever known to break the holy spell;<br> Nor sheep to stray beyond; each knew the limit well.</p>  
 <p>To wind, to wolf, to sheep, and lusts of every one,<br> The circle traced by saint a barrier was, like stone.<br> To Gnostic, so likewise, the harmless gale of death<br> Blows mild and gentle, summer-breezes-like on heath.<br> And fire was fangless; could not Abraham offend.<br> How should it hurt him? Was he not God's "Chosen Friend"?</p>  
 <p>The pious man burns not in fire of fleshly lust.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130">130</a></font></span> But sinners still consumed are upon earth's crust.<br> The Red Sea waves, all raging by divine command,<br> The host of Israel knew; but Pharaoh's armies drown’d.<br> The earth, again, wide gaping at Jehovah's word,<br> Did Korah and his wealth devour; but Moses spared. <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>In Jesu's hand, warmed with his breath, the fictile clay<br> As living birds arose, spread wing, and flew away. <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Thy lauds and praises, too, breath from thy frame account.<br> Sincerity them vivifies; to heaven they mount.</p>  
 <p>The rock of Sion danced at sight of Moses’ God <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_135">135</a></font></span> As perfect cenobite; its faults were all removed.<br> What wonder if a hill should dance and saint become?<br> Was not great Moses’ self a clod of clay and loam?</p>  
 <p>The Jewish king now manifested great surprise.<br> These things, he said, were mockeries, mere patent lies.<br> His councillors conjured him more sedate to be;<br> And not to push his hardihood to rash degree.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></a></p>  
 <p>These councillors he fettered, into prison cast;<br> Injustice to injustice adding, first and last.</p>  
 <p>A shout was heard from heaven when matters reached that point:<br> "Jew dog! Prepare for vengeance from on high! Aroynt!" <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_140">140</a></font></span><br> The fire then blazed amain; its flames lapped all around.<br> It slew and burnt the mob of Jews from off the ground.<br> Their origin was hell, from whence their souls had come;<br> Their goal was also hell; to it they now went home.<br> The Jewish race is hellish; many proofs are shown.<br> Parts are they of a whole accursed; as is well known.<br> Their nature hellish; all their joy God's saints to burn.<br> Their fire recoiled upon themselves. ’Twas justice’ turn.<br> For them, who were, by nature, children born of wrath,<br> The lowest depths of hell were fittest cells, forsooth. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_145">145</a></font></span><br> A mother ever yearneth after her own child;<br> A dam is ever followed by her offspring wild.</p>  
 <p>Though true that water may enclosed be in a tank,<br> The air will it absorb. ’Twas thence to earth it sank.<br> Air sets it free; direct, restores it to its source,<br> By little and by little. None perceive its course.</p>  
 <p>So, too, our breath, in manner like, steals soul away,<br> By little and by little, from this house of clay,<br> In words of praise, ascending to God's holy throne,<br> From us to where He reigns;—as known to Him alone. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_150">150</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Our breathings rise on wings of true sincerity,<br> The offerings of our hearts to all eternity.<br> We then receive rewards for those poor words of praise,<br> In tenfold showers of mercy from th’ Ancient of Days.<br> And we are still constrained to utter songs of thanks,<br> That man should so be raised above th’ angelic ranks.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a></p>  
 <p>This rising and descending alternates for aye.<br> The Lord forbid that I should fail therein one day!<br> We're drawn, we are attracted, so to love the Lord;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_155">155</a></font></span> As we were first instructed, firm to trust His word.</p>  
 <p>Each man will turn his eyes in hope towards the place,<br> Where he has tasted joy some former day of grace.<br> The pleasures of each kind are most with their own kin;<br> As part must share with whole its qualities, its sin.<br> Things needs must be assigned unto a common class,<br> If aught they have in common; two will form a race.<br> Thus bread and water are not human at the first;<br> But human they become, through hunger and through thirst.<br> In form they have no tie with us of human kind;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_160">160</a></font></span> But through a special link they kindred with us find.</p>  
 <p>If pleasure, then, we find in what's not of our race,<br> Be sure there's some connection through which this takes place.<br> If that connection but resemblance be in shape,<br> It will not last; it's for a time; it must escape.</p>  
 <p>’Tis true that birds find pleasure in a whistle's note;<br> But then they fancy ’tis their mate's, on whom they dote.<br> And if a thirsty man take pleasure in his wine,<br> He tastes the lees, and loathes. To water he'll incline.<br> A pauper may amused be with counterfeited coin;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_165">165</a></font></span> But take this to the mint; defaced ’twill be, in fine.<br> Then be not thou misled with gilded counterfeit;<br> Delusion will thee plunge headlong into hell's pit.</p>
