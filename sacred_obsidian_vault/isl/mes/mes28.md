 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">There</span> was a scribe <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">1</font></a>, before ‘Uthmān <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">2</font></a> had filled that post,<br> Most diligent in noting revelation's host.<br> Whatever text the Prophet had to promulgate<br> On parchment did this scribe trace all its terms of fate.</p>  
 <p>The splendour of those inspirations filled his soul.<br> His mind became enlightened, as a glowing coal.<br> The substance of that wisdom from the Prophet came.<br> The silly scribe imagined ’twas his genius’ flame:<br> "The texts the Prophet promulgates with rare effect,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span> Appear <i>verbatim</i> in my mind, without defect."</p>  
 <p>The Prophet was aware of this egregious sin.<br> The wrath of God descended from high heaven's welkin.<br> The scribe renounced his office, and his faith at once.<br> Religion's fiercest foe he stood now, for the nonce.<br> The Prophet questioned him: "Benighted, wretched man!<br> If light there be in thee, whence this thy darkest plan?<br> Hadst thou a fountain of God's truth been, verily,<br> This turbid stream had never flowed thence, heavily."</p>  
 <p>Not caring to expose his scribe to all his friends,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> The Prophet held his peace, to watch th’ adventure's ends.</p>

 <p>The scribe's heart hardened more and more as time rolled on.<br> Repentance he felt not; his pride grew thereupon.<br> He sighed. His sighs were not the signs of contrite heart;<br> But tokens sure that justice made him feel its smart.<br> God caused his pride to weigh more heavy than a chain.<br> How many thus are fettered; none can heal their pain.<br> His blasphemy and pride held him in iron grip;<br> His very sighs he felt constrained to stifle on his lip.<br> He cried: "'The iron collars they're compelled to wear;' <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> There's naught but iron collars; these are all we bear! <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span><br> 'Behind them is a barrier; but We've bound their eyes,' <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> So that they see not what's before, behind those ties."</p>  
 <p>The barrier so upreared appears a level plain;<br> He knows not ’tis a bourn that checks him like a chain.<br> Thy witness is a barrier, bars sight of the Lord;<br> Thy teacher is a veil, shuts out God's holy word.<br> How many infidels, oh! long faith to possess!<br> Their pride, their honour, stands between them and success.<br> That barrier, unseen, ’s than iron firmer still.<br> An axe can hew through iron; not through stubborn will. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span><br> A bond of iron may be broken by due means;<br> A moral bond is what holds firmest, where it leans.</p>  
 <p>A bee, a wasp, may sting one to the very quick;<br> Yet may the same be warded by precaution's trick.<br> But what's to do when sting is in our very selves?<br> The pain is then most biting, deeper far it delves.<br> Unwillingly has leaped this subject from my mind.<br> I fear ’twill leave despair in many, deep behind.<br> Despair thou not; take consolation to thy soul;<br> And cry to that Deliverer who can make thee whole: <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span><br> "Thou Lover of forgiveness! Pardon to me grant!<br> Physician of the soul! Relieve my direful want!"</p>

 <p>Whoever hath a doubt or trouble in his mind,<br> In secret's a philosopher, as you may find.<br> He wears the outward semblance of belief; but then,<br> Anon and ever his philosophy claims pen.<br> Beware, all ye believers!

 <p>To inward idea's power the outward sign must yield.<br> That power, ’tis, makes revolve the heavens’ vast starry field.<br> The sphere, the circling firmament, consider now.<br> What makes it turn?

 <p>The sins of all mankind were known to them as sure;<br> No wickedness escapes the glance of spirits pure.<br> In anger at such baseness they were moved to scorn;<br> Their own defect was hidden from their sight, heaven-born.</p>  
 <p>An ugly man once saw his face in looking-glass.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span> He turned away enraged with that reflecting mass.<br> So, when one self-conceited sees another's fault,<br> A flame from hell is lighted in his bad heart's vault.<br> ’Tis pride inflames him;—holy zeal he dubs it straight;<br> Not conscious of the vanity that makes his freight.<br> A zeal for holiness by other tokens shines;<br> And lights a fire by which to ashes earth declines.</p>  
 <p>God said to them: "If you both shine with virtue's ray,<br> No notice take of man's backslidings from its way.<br> Give thanks and praises, rather, you're not made like them.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_125">125</a></font></span> Lusts of the flesh, concupiscence, soil not your stem.<br> Had I imposed upon you that great burden, sore;<br> The heavens would not have been your home for evermore.<br> The chastity that decks your spirit-nature now,<br> Reflection is of purity that lights My brow.<br> Know, this is but a quality you hold from Me.<br> So shall th’ accursed one not make you slaves to be!"<br> E’en as the Prophet's scribe, with self-importance puffed,<br> Imagined holy wisdom's light shone as he'd stuffed.<br> Himself he fancied equal of prophetic quire;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130">130</a></font></span> His raven croak as their sweet song he dared admire.<br> He who sets up to write the notes of every bird,<br> Knows not th’ inspiring springs within their bosom stirred.<br> Could man acquire the note of nightingale so sweet,<br> Would he have learnt as well its love the rose to meet?<br> Should he achieve a notion of that love's intent;<br> ’Twould be mere surmise, like deaf man's from lips’ consent.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></a></p>  
 <p>Such deaf man once was made aware by some kind friend,<br> That next door dwelt an invalid near to his end.<br> The poor man thought within himself: "I'm deaf as stone,<br> How can I hope to comprehend this neighbour's tone? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_135">135</a></font></span><br> More 'specially as sick men speak so very low.<br> Still, go I must; mere decency demands my bow.<br> When I advance, he'll me address, his lips will move.<br> From thence I'll glean a notion, may not quite false prove.<br> I'll ask him how he feels to-day, ’mid so much pain.<br> He'll answer surely: 'Thank you; better in the main:<br> Reply I will: 'Most happy! How's the appetite?'<br> He'll answer: 'Pretty good, if chicken-broth invite.'<br> I'll say: 'Good! Good! And what are you allowed to drink?<br> Who is your doctor?' He'll respond, as one may think. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_140">140</a></font></span><br> Then I'll remark: 'With so much talent at command,<br> You can't do better. Soon I hope to see you stand.<br> I've had experience of his skill; I know his worth;<br> With him as guide, you'll not go wrong.' So forth."</p>  
 <p>Thus having got his fancied answers all by heart,<br> He goes to see the sick man; deftly plays his part.<br> On asking: "How are you?" the patient says: "Near dead."<br> The deaf man straight rejoins: "Of that I'm very glad."<br> The sufferer felt insulted by this joy expressed.<br> The deaf one had surmised,—had failed in what he'd guessed. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_145">145</a></font></span><br> He now inquired the diet: "Oh! It's poison all!"<br> Complained the sick man. "Glad to hear it," he let fall.<br> Still more the patient wondered. "Who attends you, pray?"<br> Asked Deafy; "whose advice is’t leads you on your way?"<br> "Death tracks my hours!" said he; "pray leave me now to rest."<br> The other answered: "Better can't be found; he's best."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></a></p>  
 <p>The visitor retired, quite pleased with his rich art;<br> And offered thanks for having played so kind a part.<br> The sick man, on the contrary, was all on fire:<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_150">150</a></font></span> "Whence comes this malice? Who has roused his soul to ire?"<br> So, turning in his mind the matter o’er and o’er,<br> A message he determines that shall pay the score.<br> Just so, a man who's eaten ill-digesting food,<br> Can have no rest till it's ejected, well and good.<br> Long-suffering is thy better part, reject it not;<br> With patience, thou shalt find soft words best heal a plot.<br> But our sick man found no such solace for his mind;<br> He called the deaf one "Ass," and "Fool," and "Sot," and "Blind."<br> Said he: "I'll serve him out; I'll pay him what's his due!<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_155">155</a></font></span> Till then, my spirit will his hateful visit rue!<br> A visit to the sick's for consolation's sake;<br> His visit I abhor, his insults I'll not take.<br> He's wished to gloat on foe laid prostrate at his feet;<br> Some joy to gather thence his secret hate to greet."</p>  
 <p>How many pious men there are, to outward view,<br> Reward of joy in heaven, as object, who pursue.<br> At heart they're sinners still, despite the show they make.<br> Alas! Hypocrisy for righteousness they take!<br> Just as our deaf man thought he'd done a friendly act;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_160">160</a></font></span> And yet, withal, had vexed his neighbour, as a fact.<br> He soothed his soul by thinking: "Kindly part I've played!<br> I've acted as a neighbour! Sorrow I've allayed!"<br> Whereas, in truth, a fire he'd lighted for himself;<br> And his sick neighbour's heart inspired with vengeful elf.</p>  
 <p>Beware the fires you kindle by such acts as this!<br> Beware offence to give, while proffering a kiss!<br> The Prophet said one was a hypocrite, he knew:<br> "Go, worship, friend; thy act's no worship, as I trew!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></a></p>  
 <p>For fear lest we should trespass, even as we pray,<br> Our worship has the prayer: "Lord, guide us in Thy way!" <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">1</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_165">165</a></font></span><br> "Permit not Thou, O God, that my devotion's act<br> Be counted erring hypocrite's unwelcome pact!"</p>  
 <p>The surmise of our deaf man wide was of the mark.<br> A ten years’ friendship ’twould have wrecked! Beware such spark!<br> Man's judgment, friend, that's based on sense's treacherous sand,<br> Can never be compared with revelation's wand.<br> Hast ear to hear? Hast mind to recognise the truth?<br> Know, then, thy moral ear is deaf to godly sooth<br> The first who followed sense, and reason—as he thought—<br> Instead of God's true light, the devil was, we're taught. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_170">170</a></font></span><br> He judged: "The fire more noble is than sordid earth;<br> From fire was I created; clay gave Adam birth.<br> The stock from whence it springs decides each kind of fruit;<br> From darkness Adam's sprung; light at my birth did suit."</p>  
 <p>The Lord replied: "’Tis not a question of descent.<br> Pre-eminence is here the prize of righteous bent.<br> ’Tis not a heritage of worldly wealth to share.<br> Why talk of ancestry? Heart's qualities declare.<br> The heritage we've now to give is prophecy;<br> The heirs thereto are they whose spirits hate a lie. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_175">175</a></font></span><br> The son of Abū-Jahl believed, and saved his soul; <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> A son of Noah rebelled; became perdition's goal. <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> The son of earth was made resplendent as the moon;<br> Thou, son of fire, begone, disgraced, cursed, none too soon!"</p>  
 <p>Investigations, reasonings, on days of cloud,<br> By night, in darkness, guide the doubting crowd;</p>

 <p>But, when the sun shines,—when God's temple's clearly seen,<br> No doubt remains which way to turn one's face, I ween.<br> The temple hidden, its direction quite unknown,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_180">180</a></font></span> Then use thy judgment. God this method's kindly shown. <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Whene’er you hear a note of God's truth-warbling bird, <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> You straightway seize its literal sense, just as ’tis heard.<br> You then use suppositions of your darksome mind,<br> And form, through wrong conclusions, guesses worse than blind.<br> The saints use terms of technical significance,<br> Unknown to worldly reasoners’ crass ignorance.<br> The language of the bird you learn, as to its notes;<br> But clean destroy its sense; as sure as fancy dotes.</p>  
 <p>E’en as the sick man of our tale, saints’ hearts are grieved;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_185">185</a></font></span> Though, like the deaf man, you suppose you've good achieved.<br> The scribe of writ inspired had all its text by heart;<br> Then thought himself inspired;—would play a prophet's part.<br> The Prophet, warbler-like, smote him with powerful wing;<br> He forthwith sank to blind despair, through conscience’ sting.<br> So ’tis with you. Perversely, or with vain surmise,<br> You would interpret words descended from the skies.<br> Like Hārūt, and like Mārūt, well you've learnt the tune<br> They sang of old in pride: "We're God's elect," jejune.<br> You pray for grace on all the sins of wicked men;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_190">190</a></font></span> You curse your own foul egotism, greed's hungry ken.</p>

 <p>Beware lest God's just jealousy break forth amain,<br> And smite you to the earth, ne’er more to rise again.</p>  
 <p>Those angels owned, in words: "To rule is Thine, O God.<br> Without Thy strong protection, safety's soon downtrod."<br> Such were their lip-words. But their hearts’ rebellious pride,<br> With foolish boasting, thought: "No harm can us betide."<br> They never ceased to brood on vanities thus framed,<br> Till fire of arrogance burst forth from breasts inflamed;<br> Then proclamation made: "O elemental men!<br> How little have ye known the range of angel's ken. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_195">195</a></font></span><br> We'll weave dense curtains o’er the sky's revolving face;<br> Descending then to earth, we'll there our temple place.<br> We'll justice distribute, and worship we'll commend,<br> Returning every night to heaven, whence we descend.<br> So shall we be admired by all who dwell on earth,<br> And fill the world with gladness, safety, peace, and mirth."<br> Alas! Such fancy's false! Earth cannot heaven be;<br> Their difference is radical, as all may see! <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_199">199</a></font></span></p>
