 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alas</span>! By one poor morsel, tasted through a sin,<br> The fount of thought's congealed; heart's blood diluted thin.<br> One grain of wheat has cast eclipse o’er sun of mind,<br> As "dragon's tail" doth dull the full moon, when inclined. <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_432"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Behold. How delicate is thought! One mite of clay,<br> From full-moon glory, it reduced to disarray.<br> The bread of life, received, digested, gives man power.<br> Material bread excites distrusts, contentions, sour.</p>  
 <p>The thorn, while green, cropped by the camel, far from fords,<br> Not only pleasure gives, but nutriment affords. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span><br> That selfsame thorn, grown dry and void of juicy sap,<br> If ventured on by starving beast in desert gap,<br> His palate and his lips will puncture, blood make flow;<br> As if conserve of roses should with daggers glow.</p>  
 <p>The word of life's the green, the tender, juicy thorn.<br> Material become, it's dry, as hard as horn.<br> And thou, poor flesh, expectant of the living word,<br> Bitest at the word material, dreaming not of sword;—<br> Snappest at the hard, unyielding dictum, with fond zest;<br> And findest it horny, flinty, irksome to digest. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span></p>

 <p>It has become a stone. It wounds; it draws forth blood.<br> Then shun it, human camel. Seek it not for food.<br> Words are most foully mixed with troubling thoughts of earth.<br> The water's muddy. Close the spring whence it comes forth.<br> Until the Lord, again, shall make it clear and sweet;—<br> Shall purify the inky stream, as He deems meet,—<br> Shall patience add to wish,—not haste and oversight,—<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_14">14</a></font></span> Wait thou contentedly. God best knows what is right.</p>
