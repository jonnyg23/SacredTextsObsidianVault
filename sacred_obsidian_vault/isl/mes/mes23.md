 <p>HAST heard, perchance, there was in days of good ‘Umer<br> A minstrel talented, whose harpings moved the sphere?<br> The nightingales all wept in transports at his voice,<br> One pleasure made men's hearts a hundredfold rejoice.<br> His song enchanted every gathering where he went,<br> Applause as thunder broke forth, to his heart's content.<br> Like voice of Isrāfīl, whose trump on judgment day, <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Will wake the dead to life, his made the saddest gay.<br> Dear friend to Isrāfīl he was, and mendicant;<br> His notes made plumes to sprout on hide of elephant. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Some day will Isrāfīl attention pay to moans.<br> Their souls he will recall to old and putrid bones.<br> The prophets, likewise, all, musicians are on hearts.<br> Disciples hence expire with joy by fits and starts.<br> Our outward ears the strains hear not which thence proceed;<br> Those ears, in many ways, degraded are indeed.</p>  
 <p>Mankind the songs of fairies never hear at all,<br> They are not versed in fairies’ ways, their voices small.</p>

 <p>’Tis true, the chants of fairies’ sounds are of this world; <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> But songs sung by men's hearts are far above them hurled.<br> Both men and fairies pris’ners are in earthly cage.<br> Both, too, are thralls of sinful ignorance's rage.<br> Read thou the text: "O fairy troop," in book of God. <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Consider, too: "Can ye pass out?" Who holds the rod?</p>  
 <p>The inward hymn that's sung by all the hearts of saints<br> Commences: "O component parts of that thing <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span>." <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Now since they take their rise in this <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span>, negative,<br> They put aside the hollow phantom where we live.</p>  
 <p>Ye putrid corpses, wrapt in rank corruption's cloth,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span> Our everlasting souls are free from birth and growth.<br> Were I but to recite one stave from their blest song,<br> All living souls would rise out from their tombs among.<br> Lend ear attentively; that may not distant be;<br> As yet, however, leave's not given to tell it thee.</p>  
 <p>The saints are Isrāfīls of this our passing time.<br> The spiritually dead through them live life sublime.<br> Our souls mere corpses are; their graves, our bodies’ crowds.<br> At voice of saint do they arise, clothed in their shrouds.<br> They say: "This voice has in it something to be feared.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span> To raise the dead, God's voice alone has power, we've heard.<br> We were all dead, and unto earth had we returned.<br> The voice of God we've heard; our prisons we have spurned."</p>  
 <p>The voice of God without, also within the vail,<br> Can give the gift to all, it gave to Mary: "Hail!"<br> O ye whose death was not that which attacks the flesh,<br> At sound of the Beloved's voice ye’ve risen afresh.</p>

 <p>That voice the Bridegroom's voice most truly was, ’tis said,<br> Although ’twas from the lips of His servant, Ahmed.<br> God said to him: "Thy tongue, thy eye, thy ear, I am;<br> All thy contentment, anger, thoughts, ’tis I undam. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span><br> Go on; 'By Me he hears, by Me he sees;' that's thee;<br> Thou art the head; thou holdest the place of Head's trustee.<br> In ecstasy, since thou art 'He the Lord's who is,' <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> I will be thine; for see, ’tis said: 'The Lord is his.'<br> Now will I say to thee: 'Thou art;' and now; 'I am.'<br> What I may say's as clear as is the sun in heaven.<br> Wherever I may shine an instant in a lamp,<br> A world of doubts I solve; on all My seal I stamp.<br> The darkness which the sun could never yet illume,<br> By magic of My breath grows bright as peacock's plume. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span><br> Wherever gloom may reign as undisturbed night,<br> When shone upon by Me, like noonday's forthwith bright."</p>  
 <p>’Twas He who taught to Adam ev’ry thing's true name,<br> Through Adam to mankind imparted He the same.<br> Take thou enlightenment from Adam or the Lord.<br> Draw wine as thou mayest list from jar or from the gourd. <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> The distance is not great between the gourd and jar.<br> The gourd is not, like thee, made drunk by grape's nectar.<br> Draw water from the brook, or from a pitcher's mouth;<br> The brook is still the source whence pitcher's filled; forsooth. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Seek light as listest; whether from the moon or sun.<br> The moon derives her sheen from daystar's golden tun.<br> Imbibe what light thou canst from any twinkling star.<br> The Prophet said: "Stars are all my disciples."

 <p>He further said: "How happy they who see my face, <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And happy they who look on them in their own place."<br> He said: "Good luck to all who have the happy chance <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> To look on my disciples,—mirrors of my glance."<br> If thou by taper's aid proceed to light a lamp,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span> The eye that sees its light, perceives the taper's stamp.<br> If one lamp from another should be lighted; well!<br> The light received from this, has come from that one's cell.<br> And so, if through a thousand wicks the light should pass,<br> Who sees the last enjoys the gift of all the mass.<br> The light of this last lamp's as pure as is the whole;<br> No difference is there. And thus ’tis with the soul.<br> The light diffused by teachers in these latter days,<br> No other is than what was shown by earlier rays.</p>  
 <p>Our Prophet said: "The breathings of the Lord your God, <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span> In these your days of pilgrimage, on all sides prod.<br> Your ears and minds lend ye to all signs of the times;<br> Perchance ye may inhale those breathings in these climes."</p>  
 <p>One breathing came and found you. Straightway it was gone.<br> To all who sought, new life it gave. It then had done.<br> Another breathing's come. Be ye not unprepared.<br> Ye may not let it go by. Something must be shared.<br> It found your souls on fire. ’Tis thence they cease to burn.<br> Your souls it found all corpses. Life it made return.<br> Your fiery souls by it all quickly were puffed out.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span> Dead souls of yours by it began aloud to shout.<br> Their present calm, and this vivacity's from heaven;<br> Resembling not the turbulence by which man's driven.</p>

 <p>One breathing from the Lord, when blown on earth and air,<br> Ill qualities converts straight into all that's fair.<br> For fear lest any breathing such as this thee shake,<br> Read thou the text: "They shunned the task to undertake." <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Had not " they shrunk from it," where now would’st thou have been?<br> Had they not feared, would’st thou this grade have ever seen?<br> But yesterday an opening gleamed for better things;<br> Till greed for fleshly morsels stopped the way of kings. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>For sake of some such morsel Luqmān was made bail. <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> The time's now that for Luqmān morsel’d not avail.<br> The troubles we endure are all for morsel's sake.<br> Be Luqmān. Thou’lt extract the thorn that makes thee ache.<br> A thorn or chafing hurt not Luqmān's horny hand.<br> Through greed thou lackest the discipline made him so bland.<br> The thing thou thoughtest a date-palm, know, is but a thorn.<br> Ungrateful, uninformed thou art, now, as when born.<br> The soul of Luqmān was a vineyard of the Lord.<br> Why then into his soul did thorn pierce like a sword? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Thorn-eating camel, truly, is this world of ours,<br> Ahmed, then, came and mounted;—him that camel bears.<br> O camel, on thy back thou bearest a vase of rose.<br> On thee from thence have sprouted rosebuds, as God knows.<br> Thy tastes thee lead to camel-thorn and wastes of sand.<br> To thee the thorn's a rose; the wilderness, rich land.</p>  
 <p>O thou who in such quest hast wandered up and down,<br> How long wilt thou contend rose-garden's sandy down?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_m144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thou canst not now extract the thorn from thy sore foot.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span> With that blind eye of thine, how wilt thou see its root?<br> A man whose vast desires the world could not contain,<br> Is sometimes by one thorn's point sent to death's domain.</p>  
 <p>Now Ahmed came; a tender, kind companion, he.<br> "Speak to me, O Humayrā," said he, "speak to me." <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Put thou thy shoe, Humayrā, quick into the fire. <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> The rocks will rubies turn, from his feet's blood in mire.<br> This Humayrā's a woman's name, the poet's love.<br> Such is the Arab custom. Soul is meant. Now move.<br> That Soul's no need to fear from being named as girl. <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_70">70</a></font></span> Of sex, as male or female, that Soul has no twirl.<br> That Soul is far above sex, accident, and mood.<br> That Soul is not man's darling, made of flesh and blood.<br> That Soul is not the life that grows from cakes of bread;<br> That's sometimes of one mind, and other then instead.<br> Of good is He the worker, good He is also.<br> From goodness separate, no goodness e’er will flow.</p>  
 <p>If thou’rt made sweet through sugar, it may happen still,<br> That sugar none thou find, to sweeten thee at will.<br> But if thou sweet become, like sugar, through good heart,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span> This sweetness from thy sugar never will depart.</p>  
 <p>How can a lover find love's nectar in himself?<br> That question passes comprehension, my good elf.<br> Man's finite reason disbelieves love's potent sway.<br> Himself he yet esteems endowed with head to-day.</p>

 <p>He's clever, and he's knowing, <i>nil</i> he's not; anon.<br> Until an angel's nothing, <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">1</font></a> he's a sheer demon.<br> In word and act a man may be a friend of ours;<br> But when it comes to heart and mind, he huffs and lours.<br> If he from <i>esse</i>, reach not <i>posse's</i> state, he's <i>nil;</i><br> And willingly;—unwillingly, we may worlds fill. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_80">80</a></font></span><br> The Soul, our God, ’s perfection.

 <p>That Ahmed, Mustafà, at one blest sight stood lost. <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> His wedding-night it was.

 <p>Both love and soul are occult, hidden and concealed.<br> If God I have "bride" named, let it stand fault repealed.<br> I silence would have kept, from fear of love's caprice,<br> If for a moment only, I'd been granted grace.<br> But He still said: "Say on. The word is not a fault.<br> It's naught but the decree there should appear default.<br> It's shame to him who only sees another's faults.<br> What fault is noticed by the Soul safe from assaults?" <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_90">90</a></font></span></p>

 <p>A fault it is to eyes of creatures ignorant.<br> But not with God the Lord, our Maker benignant.<br> E’en blasphemy is wisdom with th’ Omnipotent; <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Attributed to mortals, mortal sin patent.<br> If one sole fault be found amidst a hundred truths,<br> ’Tis like a stick that's used to prop sweet flowers’ growths.<br> Both will be surely weighed in justice’ equal scales;<br> For, like the soul and body, both are pleasant tales.<br> The saints have therefore said, for sweet instruction's sake:<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_95">95</a></font></span> "The bodies of the pure with souls just balance make."</p>  
 <p>Their words, their selves, their figures, whate’er these may be,<br> Are all Soul Absolute, without a trace to see.<br> Sworn enemy is Body to their spiritual life,<br> Just as one game of backgammon, with names full rife. <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> The body goes to earth; is soon reduced to clay;<br> The soul endures like salt, and suffers no decay.<br> The salt, than which Muhammed far more sapid is;<br> From "Attic salt" that's found in each <i>dictum</i> of his.<br> That Attic salt's an heirloom, heritage from him;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_100">100</a></font></span> His heirs are here with thee.

 <p>If thou still be in doubt, and not sure of thyself,<br> Thou’rt slave unto thy body; soul thou hast not, elf.<br> Behind, before, above, below, stands body's shade.<br> The soul has no "dimensions;" clearly it's displayed.</p>

 <p>Lift thy eyes, dear Sir, in glorious light of God;<br> That thou be not accounted most shortsighted clod.<br> Thou nothing knowest or carest about, save grief and joy;<br> Thou nothing, by mere nothings hemmed in, man or boy. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_105">105</a></font></span><br> To-day's a day of rain. Yet journey thou till night;<br> Not on account of downpour, but because it's light.</p>  
 <p>One day did Mustafà, go to the burial-ground.<br> The Prophet at a funeral, his friend's, was found.<br> At filling in the grave he lent a helping hand;<br> A living seed he planted in that holy land.<br> The trees thereof are emblems,—cypress, fir, or yew;<br> Their boughs are hands in prayer uplifted,—if men knew.<br> They many lessons inculcate to men of sense,<br> He who hath ears to hear may thence draw inference. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span><br> A contemplative mind from them new secrets culls.<br> The heedless are amused with what men's reason dulls.<br> With tongue-shaped leaves and finger-twigs they us address;<br> From inmost heart of earth they publish mysteries.<br> As ducks dive into water, they plunge into earth.<br> Like rooks they were, now peacocks, gay in their new birth.<br> The winter shuts them up, as prisoners, in its ice.<br> Black rooks then, bare; as peacocks spring bids them arise.<br> God makes them look like dead in winter's frozen reign,<br> But with returning spring wakes them to life again. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_115">115</a></font></span><br> Dull atheists contend this is a story old,<br> And ask why we to God attribute it, so bold.<br> They say these alternations ever thus were seen.<br> The world of old, they think, as ’tis, has ever been.<br> In spite of their contention, in breasts of His saints<br> Has God at all times reared rich gardens free from feints.</p>  
 <p>Each flower that yields to sense agreeable perfume,<br> Speaks volumes to saint's heart with its mysterious tongue.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p>Each perfume from a flower rubs atheist's nose in dirt;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span> Although he rush about, and boundless nonsense spirt.<br> An atheist's like a chafer clinging to rosebud,<br> Or like a nervous patient tortured by drum's thud.<br> He makes himself as fussy as each touting wight;<br> But shuts his eyes to flashes of conviction's light.<br> He shuts his eyes perversely, with them will not see.<br> The saint, on other hand, ’s clear-sighted certainly.</p>  
 <p>The Prophet, when returned home from the funeral,<br> Found ‘Ā’isha was waiting, him to welcome all.<br> So when her eyes fell on him, just as in he came,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_125">125</a></font></span> She him approached, and on him hand placed; gentle dame.<br> She touched his turban, cloak and coat, his sleeves and shoes,<br> His hair and beard, his face and hands, peering for news.<br> He asked her what she sought with so much eager zeal.<br> She answered him: "To-day of rain there's fallen a deal.<br> I'm lost in wonderment to feel thou art not wet;<br> No dampness is there here. I marvel still more yet."<br> He asked: "What veil worest thou God's service to fulfil?" <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> She answered: "I a plaid of thine threw o’er my frill."<br> He said: "That plaid it was for which the Lord, to thee,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130">130</a></font></span> My lady pure, a shower caused visible to be.<br> That shower was not of raindrops .from the clouds that fall;<br> A shower of mercy ’twas; its cloud and sky, His call."</p>  
 <p>["In regions of the soul so many skies are there! <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> They issue their commands to spheres of earth and air.<br> The ups and downs in spirit's path form quite a class;<br> So many hills to climb; so many seas to pass."]—<i>Sanā’ī</i>.</p>

 <p>One rain there is that nourishment brings in its track;<br> Another rain also that works a whole world's wreck.<br> The rain of spring does wonders in the garden's fold;<br> The rain of autumn chills like ague's shivers cold.<br> The spring rain nourishes whate’er it falls upon.<br> Autumnal showers but bleach and shrivel; all turns wan.<br> Thus is it with the cold, the wind, and eke the sun;<br> They're means from which such different phases seem to run. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_140">140</a></font></span><br> In things invisible the same rule still holds good;<br> Advantage, loss, annoyance, fraud, affliction's flood.<br> The words of saints are like the vernal breeze in power;<br> They cause sweet flowers to open in man's bosom bower.<br> And like the rains of spring on herbage of the field,<br> They raise in pious hearts a harvest of rich yield.<br> If thou shouldst see a trunk that's blighted, dead, and dry,<br> Attribute not this state to quickening air's supply.<br> The air still quickens, though dead stumps feel not its power.<br> ’Tis only what's alive, that freshens by a shower. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_145">145</a></font></span></p>

 <p>Good ‘Ā’isha, the gem of honour's casket wide,<br> Then asked the Prophet (who's of both the worlds the Pride): <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_160">160</a></font></span><br> "O thou who of all creatures every essence art,<br> What was the reason rain this day has played its part?<br> Was it a rain of mercy, such as sometimes falls;<br> Or was it as a menace justice fitly calls?<br> Was it a vernal rain, dispensing benefits;<br> Or was it an autumnal shower, to dig grave pits?"</p>  
 <p>He answered: "’Twas a sprinkle, sent to soothe our care,—<br> That fruit inherited by all who Adam share.<br> Should man remain exposed for long to care's fierce flame,<br> ’Twould work him wrack and ruin, crush his mortal frame." <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_165">165</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>The world would go to ruin in a little while;<br> Man's greed would get the upper hand, did he not smile.<br> The prop of this wide world is heedlessness, my son;<br> And thoughtfulness on earth below's a curse, when won.<br> For thoughtfulness belongs unto the upper world;<br> Triumphant here below, all's soon to ruin hurled.<br> This thoughtfulness a sun is; greed's a mass of ice.<br> This thoughtfulness is water; greed, the filth of vice.<br> So from the upper world scant tricklings are sent down,<br> That greed and envy may not ruin every town. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_170">170</a></font></span><br> If those scant tricklings were to prove a copious rill,<br> Defects and talents both would cease our soil to till.<br> Let's leave these moralisings; they would have no end.<br> So go we back to seek the minstrel, our old friend.</p>  
 <p>That minstrel's talent had been rare; the world he'd charmed.<br> At sound of his sweet voice, imagination ’d swarmed.<br> Each heart, birdlike, began to flutter in its cage;<br> Surprise enchained men's minds when his notes threw the gage.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>But now he was grown old; long years he'd passed on earth.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_175">175</a></font></span> Like falcon chasing gnats, he'd little cause for mirth.<br> His back was double bent, like belly of wine-jar;<br> His brows above his eyes with crupper-straps on par.<br> His voice, the former joy of all who might it hear,<br> Was now cracked, out of tune, uncouth, none could it bear.<br> His tones, that might have made dame Venus mad with rage, <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Were now like donkey's brayings in his sinking age.</p>  
 <p>What is there beautiful that goes not to decay?<br> Where is the roof that will not ruin be one day?<br> Unless it be the words of saint <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">2</font></a> from God; they'll last<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_180">180</a></font></span> ’Till echoes of his voice shall sound in judgment blast.<br> He is the inner joy that glads our inner man;<br> The source from whom our beings rose when time began.<br> He is the amber draws the motes of thought and speech;<br> He gave the means to measure revelation's reach.</p>  
 <p>Our minstrel in old age felt poverty's sure pinch.<br> No money could he earn; bread, not enough for finch.<br> He prayed: "O God, long life and full to me Thou’st given,<br> To worthless sinner Thou hast shown foretaste of heaven.<br> I've slighted Thy commandments seventy years and more,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_185">185</a></font></span> Not one day hast Thou let me pangs of want feel sore.<br> No longer can I earn; I'm now Thy household guest;<br> I'll harp for love of Thee, Thou giver of my feast."</p>  
 <p>His harp on shoulder slung, he went, in quest of God,<br> To burial-ground of Yathrab; <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">3</font></a> sat down on the sod.<br> Said he: "I'll ask of God the hire of my harpstrings;<br> For He accepts the heart's most humble outpourings."</p>

 <p>He harped awhile, and then he laid him down and wept.<br> His harp his pillow was; upon a grave he slept.</p>  
 <p>With sleep his soul was freed from prison and from pain,<br> The harp and harper both were now made young again. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_190">190</a></font></span><br> His soul, free, wandered forth, exempt from all dull care,<br> In spacious fields of heaven, the soul's park, light as air.<br> There he began to warble, merry as a lark:<br> "O that I here might dwell without a care to cark<br> How joyous I should be in such a paradise;<br> These sweet ethereal fields breathe balm, and myrrh, and spice.<br> I'd wander all about; no need of feet or wings.<br> All sweets I'd feast on; lips and teeth were useless things.<br> My mind at rest, from all care free, I'd ever roam.<br> The angels I'd not envy in their heavenly home. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_195">195</a></font></span><br> With bandaged eyes I'd survey realms without an end;<br> All sorts of flowers I'd gather, yet not soil my hand.<br> Like duck in pond, down deep I'd plunge in honey lake. <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> In Job's own fount I'd bathe, in wine .I'd revel make.<br> For Job with wine from heaven was cleansed in every pore;<br> From head to foot he came forth healed, without a sore."</p>  
 <p>If these poor rhyming verses covered heaven's vast vault,<br> They'd not tell half a tithe, they still would be at fault.<br> The sum of heavenly joys I find an endless theme;<br> My heart is far too narrow to embrace its scheme. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_200">200</a></font></span><br> The world I would enclose in my poor poem's fold,<br> Has lent my thoughts the wings that make their flight so bold.<br> Were but that world in sight; its road, were it but known;<br> Few souls would here remain, were but its glories shown.</p>

 <p>Commandment has been given: "Thou shalt not covetous be."<br> The thorn from out thy foot is drawn; thy thanks let's see.<br> "My Lord! My God!" loud cried our minstrel in that place,<br> Those glorious realms of mercy, boundless shores of grace.</p>  
 <p>About that time the Lord on ‘Umer slumber sent.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_205">205</a></font></span> He could not keep awake; beneath sleep's burden bent.<br> With wonder thought he ’twas unprecedented: "See!<br> This sleep's divinely ordered; purpose there must be."<br> His head he bowed; sleep bound him fast; a dream he saw,<br> A voice from God he heard,—for him a sacred law.</p>  
 <p>God's voice the real source is of every cry and sound;<br> The only voice, in fact; all other's echo found.<br> Turks, Kurds, and Persians, Arabs, all have understood<br> That voice most wonderful, of lip and ear no mood.</p>  
 <p>What say I? No! Not merely Turks and Persians all,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_210">210</a></font></span> The very rocks and trees have answered to that call.<br> Each moment's clearly heard: "Am I not, then, your Lord?" <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Ideas and essences became "things" at His word.<br> Had they not answered: "Yes, Thou art our God, O Lord,"<br> From out of nothing straight that answer ’d come, in word!</p>

 <p>A post in his own house, at Mustafà's retreat,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_215">215</a></font></span> Sent forth a sob of grief, like heart in sorrow's heat,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m155"><font size="1" color="green">p. 155</font></a></p>  
 <p>As he his sermon preached, surrounded by his flock,<br> So that the moan was heard by old and young; no mock.<br> Disciples one and all were petrified, perplexed,<br> And marvelled what might make its wooden heart so vexed.<br> The Prophet put the question: "What may be thy need?"<br> The column answered: "Prophet, grief my heart makes bleed. <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Against me, in thy sermon, thou’st been used to lean;<br> A pulpit now thou’st mounted; far from me thou’rt seen."<br> The Prophet said: "Thou most affectionate of posts!<br> Good fortune thee attend, sent by the Lord of Hosts! <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_220">220</a></font></span><br> If thou so wish, thou mayst become a fruitful palm;<br> And men from east and west sing of thy dates in psalm.<br> Or God may thee transplant to realms of paradise;<br> Where as a cedar thou eternally mayst rise."<br> It answered: "I elect what ne’er will know decay."<br> Lend ear, O heedless man! Hast thou less sense than they?<br> That post was forthwith buried, like a corpse of clay,<br> In hopes of resurrection at the judgment day.<br> Thou hence mayst learn that any whom the Lord doth call,<br> Breaks straightway with the things of this our earthly ball. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_225">225</a></font></span><br> Whoe’er receives a mission from the Lord his God,<br> Forsakes the world, himself prepares the path to plod.</p>  
 <p>Who's not received the gift of knowledge from above,<br> Will ne’er believe a stock could sigh and moan for love.<br> He may pretend to acquiesce; not from belief;<br> He says: "’Tis so," to ’scape a name much worse than thief.</p>

 <p>All they who're not convinced that God's "Be" is enough,<br> Will turn away their face; this tale they'll treat as "stuff"</p>  
 <p>By thousands are confessing Muslims, men of mark,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_230">230</a></font></span> By doubt most sadly haunted; faith they've not, one spark.<br> Conformity with them is founded on surmise,<br> And all their heart and conscience quieted with lies.<br> ’Tis Satan sows the seed of doubting in their breast,<br> Like blind men they will fall into the pit at last.</p>  
 <p>Mere reasoners are cripples, propped on wooden leg;<br> And, like such cripple, often falling as they beg.<br> How different's a pillar of our holy creed!<br> As mountain he is steadfast; faith his living meed.<br> A blind man's leg's his staff; upon it he must lean,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_235">235</a></font></span> Or he will risk to fall at full length on the green.<br> A knight is he who sole has routed hosts of foes;<br> Wise leader then becomes of liegemen's ranks through woes.<br> Those blind men find their way by trusting to a staff.<br> They lean upon a creature; their sight is in a gaff.<br> For, otherwise, they'd be far-seeing; they'd be kings;<br> As ’tis, they're blind, they're corpses,—lifeless, senseless things.<br> The blind can never sow, and surely never reap;<br> They cannot edify; their talent they must keep.<br> If ’twere not for God's mercy, favour, and free grace,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_240">240</a></font></span> Their staff of reason ’d snap; they ’d fall prone on their face.</p>  
 <p>That staff's a weapon made for quarrelling and fight;<br> Then break it up in pieces, man of feeble sight!<br> That staff was given thee, to help thee on thy way;<br> With it men's faces strikest thou, angry, ev’ry day.</p>  
 <p>What's this you're doing, blind ones? What are you about?<br> Some constables call in, to calm this frightful rout.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m157"><font size="1" color="green">p. 157</font></a></p>  
 <p>Fall down, and Him entreat, who furnished you with staff.<br> Look well, and see what signs your weapon may engraff.</p>  
 <p>Consider Moses’ miracle; reflect on Ahmed's too.<br> One's staff became a serpent; one's post chose what is true. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_245">245</a></font></span><br> From that staff came a serpent; from this post, loud moan.<br> Five times a day for praise we hear the crier's tone.<br> This trouble otherwise had been a senseless suit;<br> So many miracles, so very little fruit.</p>  
 <p>What's reas’nable the mind can easily allow,<br> No need's there then for miracle, for tide to ebb and flow.<br> The plan of miracles unreasonable count;<br> But know it is accepted; faith it does not daunt.</p>  
 <p>Just like as demons, and as wild beasts, out of dread<br> Of man, fled to the wilds, when envy reared its head, <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_250">250</a></font></span><br> So, out of dread of miracles by prophets wrought,<br> Do cavillers take refuge in sophisms of thought.<br> In name, they're Muslims; and, by virtue of their wiles,<br> We can't know what they are; their faces are all smiles.<br> Precisely as false-coiners on their metal base<br> A coat of silver put, the sovereign's name then trace,<br> In word, God's unity confessed, and holy law,<br> Their hearts are like the poison-grain in sweet kickshaw.<br> Not Venus will convince a sophist in debate;<br> But true religion speaks, confutes his postulate. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_255">255</a></font></span><br> His body's like a stock, his spirit's but a stone.<br> Howe’er he contradict, them God directs alone.<br> In words, mayhap, he may detect a hitch or two;<br> But his own soul and body witness God is true.</p>  
 <p>Some stones were held in hand by Abū-Jahl one day. <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Said he to Muhammed: "What hold I here? Now say.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p>Since thou’rt a prophet, tell: What hold I in my hand?<br> The secrets of high heaven thou claimest to command."</p>  
 <p>Said Muhammed: "How can’st suppose I should not tell?<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_260">260</a></font></span> The things themselves shall speak. I'm truthful; they know well."<br> Said Abū-Jahl: "This last pretension's harder still."<br> To him replied the Prophet: "They'll obey God's will.'</p>  
 <p>From out of his closed hand a chorus now burst forth;<br> Confession of God's unity; His Prophet's worth:<br> "There is no god but God," the stones distinctly sang;<br> "Muhammed is God's prophet," also clearly rang.</p>  
 <p>When Abū-Jahl this heard, he cast the stones away,<br> In anger from his hand, as then he dared to say:<br> Most surely no magician ever was like thee.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_265">265</a></font></span> Magicians’ chief art thou; crown on their heads thou’lt be."</p>  
 <p>May dust alight upon his head, blind miscreant!<br> ’Twas Satan closed his inward sight;—cursed recusant.</p>  
 <p>Now turn we once again to hear the minstrel's tale,<br> For all this time he's waiting; anxious, wan, and pale.<br> The heavenly voice the Caliph called: "Ho! ‘Umer! Ho!<br> Our servant's want relieve; set thou him free from woe.<br> A servant whom we hold in very high esteem,<br> In public burial-ground, go, visit; him redeem.<br> From out the public treasury do thou extract<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_270">270</a></font></span> Seven hundred golden sequins, with due care and tact.<br> To him deliver them; and say: 'O man of good,<br> For present needs let this suffice; ’twill give thee food.<br> Thy harpstrings’ hire it is. Go hence; and when ’tis done,<br> Do thou again come hither; look for me alone.'"</p>  
 <p>At sound of that dread voice did ‘Umer now awake,<br> And straight himself disposed that task to undertake.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p>Towards the burial-ground he turned his steps amain,<br> The money in his breast, to seek the stranger, fain.<br> He walked about the ground, right, left, and everywhere.<br> No second soul was seen; the minstrel only there. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_275">275</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Thought he: "This cannot be my quest." So, off again<br> He wandered; still no other offered; this was plain.<br> He said within himself: "The Lord of servant spake,<br> Devout, approved, accepted, loved for God's own sake.<br> An ancient minstrel this. Of God can he be loved?<br> Some mystery is here. Hail, riddle, by God moved!<br> Once more he wandered o’er the spacious burial-ground,<br> As lion seeking for his prey goes round and round.<br> Convinced at length no other was there choice to make,<br> He thought: "When I'm in doubt, light from above I take." <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_280">280</a></font></span><br> Respectfully he then approached the sleeping guest.<br> A sneezing seized him. Straight the harper woke from rest.</p>  
 <p>When °timer he espied, he marvelled, sore amazed;<br> And rose to go away. Fear's tremor held him dazed.<br> He thought: "O Lord, have mercy Thou on me!<br> This magistrate austere no harper ’ll kindly see."</p>  
 <p>Now ‘Umer him considered; saw he was afraid;<br> His cheeks all pale and wan; looks, modest as a maid;<br> Then said: "Fear not! From me seek not to go away;<br> Good tidings from on high to thee I bring this day. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_285">285</a></font></span><br> Of thee the Lord hath spoken in terms of highest praise.<br> The heart of ‘Umer's moved to love thee and thy lays.<br> Be seated, then, by me, as friend by side of friend;<br> While I to thee impart the message God doth send.<br> The Lord doth thee salute; thy welfare doth inquire;<br> Trusts thou’st supported well all thy afflictions dire.<br> This trifle sends for present needs, as harpstrings’ worth.<br> When it is spent, come here again, and fear not dearth."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>The old man trembled as he heard those words so kind;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_290">290</a></font></span> His finger in astonishment he bit;—near lost his mind.<br> Then cried aloud: "O God! Thou all-unequalled One!<br> In my old age I sink for shame; this mercy I've not won."</p>  
 <p>A torrent, now, of tears, he shed, in anguish deep;<br> His harp then dashed to pieces. Why it longer keep?<br> He thus apostrophised it: "O thou source of ill!<br> Thou’st barred me from heaven's path, as highwaymen who kill.<br> My blood thou’st sucked these seventy years, thou thing of shame!<br> Through thee I'm rendered vile in eyes of men of fame.<br> O Lord, Most Merciful! Thou giver of all good!<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_295">295</a></font></span> My past life pardon, squandered ill, in heedless mood!"</p>  
 <p>Man's life's a gift of God. Alas! How few will think!<br> The value of each moment's great, so near death's brink.<br> I've spent my life, not thinking how the moments fly.<br> I've sung and harped as though a man should never die.<br> Alas! that I in singing songs of mirth and glee,<br> Entirely had forgot that death would visit me.<br> Alas! that shrillest notes have set my ears in flames,<br> And scorched my heart to shamelessness! Sad names!<br> Alas! the gamut's intervals were heard all night.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_300">300</a></font></span> The day has dawned; the caravan passed with the light.<br> My God! Help, help! Me save front him who cries for help!<br> Protection I implore from self;—I, who thus yelp!<br> I never shall obtain my right, except through craft.<br> For craft is german more to me than self ingraft.<br> By craft this self itself doth rear across my way.<br> Beyond my craft myself I see, when craft's at bay.<br> Just like as when a man is telling gold with thee.<br> Alone it thou considerest,—self thou dost not see.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p>So did the harper weep, and loudly did complain.<br> His sins he numbered up, committed in life's train. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_305">305</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>To him then ‘Umer: "This contrition deep of thine<br> Is proof thou sober art, though grief thy heart entwine.<br> Thy worldly journey's over, other path now take;<br> For this sobriety's a sin thou must forsake.<br> Sobriety's a virtue in the road thou’st trod.<br> The past and future both are curtains hiding God.<br> Set fire to both of them! How long wilt thou remain<br> Partitioned up by diaphragms like a reed cane?<br> So long as reed has diaphragms, it's not our friend;<br> With lips and voice of ours its notes it cannot blend. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_310">310</a></font></span><br> So long as thou goest round the house, thou waverer art; <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> But when thou’st entered, then full ease reigns in thy heart.<br> O thou, whose knowledge of full knowledge is not half,<br> Contrition is, with thee, worse than thy fault, mooncalf.<br> Thou’rt contrite for the past. On what occasion<br> Wilt thou contrition feel for this contrition?<br> At one time worshipper thou wert of notes of harp;<br> And now, like lover, thou ’dst kiss sighs and moans so sharp."</p>  
 <p>Like mirror, ‘Umer having thus reflected truth,<br> The harper's heart received enlightenment, forsooth. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_315">315</a></font></span><br> He, spirit-like, became relieved of moan and smile.<br> His old mind took its leave, his new heart was docile.<br> Amazement fell upon him, stupor bathed each sense,<br> Ecstatic trance then followed, earth and sky flew hence.<br> A yearning and a longing past description.<br> As I cannot explain; try thy perception.<br> Such ecstasy, such words, beyond all mood and tense;<br> Immersion total in God's glorious effulgence.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></a></p>  
 <p>Immersion such, escape therefrom impossible;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_320">320</a></font></span> That sea henceforth to him became impassable.</p>  
 <p>Our partial wisdom's not part of omniscience,<br> Until God's promptings come its promptings to enhance.<br> But when our souls are made those impulses to feel,<br> That sea in waves straight rises, under which we reel.</p>  
 <p>The story of the harper and his state now ends;<br> Both harper and that state have grown to be our friends.<br> The harper sealed his mouth from any further song.<br> We, too, will leave his tale half told; it is too long.</p>  
 <p>In order to attain to his high state of bliss,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_325">325</a></font></span> Had one a hundred lives, they might be staked for this.<br> Be thou, then, like a falcon, ever on the wing,<br> To catch that gnat, thy soul; sunlike, for ever sing.<br> He casts himself, for love, from highest heaven's height;<br> If flagons empty, he with wine fills them, so bright.</p>  
 <p>O spiritual Sun, transfuse Thou life to all.<br> A new life give, O God, to this our earthly ball.<br> Into the frames of men both life and soul infuse<br> From out Thy hidden world, as water dost diffuse.</p>  
 <p>The Prophet has informed us that, for warning's sake,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_330">330</a></font></span> Two angels evermore sweet invocation make:<br> "O God, dispensers bless! Do Thou them feed and tend!<br> Give them ten thousandfold for every mite they spend!<br> But hoarders, O our Lord God, in this lower scene,<br> Do Thou afflict with loss,—no profit intervene!"</p>  
 <p>How many hoardings better than dispensings are!<br> Save in God's service, wealth of God spend not. Take care!<br> So mayst thou get in recompense a hundredfold.<br> So mayst thou ’scape the punishment of sins untold.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></a></p>  
 <p>Men offered up their camels as a sacrifice;<br> In hopes their swords ’gainst Mustafà would do service. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_335">335</a></font></span><br> Seek thou the will of God from him who has it learnt;<br> Not into every soul has God's will been inburnt.<br> The Prophet's words forewarned those sons of heedlessness,<br> That all such offerings are a heap of worthlessness.<br> In war with God's apostle, chiefs of Mekka all<br> Such sacrifices offered, ghostly aid to call.</p>  
 <p>Just like the unjust steward, who, as justice due,<br> The treasure of his lord bestowed on rebel crew.<br> He falsely pictured to himself he'd justice wrought,<br> With public money spent, the poor to terms he'd brought. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_340">340</a></font></span><br> Such justice from such culprit, what could it effect?<br> His lord, to anger moved, excuses did reject.</p>  
 <p>Hence is it, every Muslim, fearing he may stray,<br> In his devotions begs: "Lead Thou us in right way." <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Their substance to dispense suits men of generous mood.<br> A lover's ready gift's his life for his love's good.<br> Dispense thou food for God's sake; food thou’lt surely have.<br> Lay down thy life for love of God; thy life thou’lt save.</p>  
 <p>We see the trees here shed their leaves at God's command.<br> Without their toil or trouble, other leaves He'll send. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_345">345</a></font></span><br> Shouldst thou, dispensing much, one day be found in want,<br> The Lord will not forsake thee; His supply's not scant.<br> Whoever sows, must empty storehouses of grain;<br> His fields will yield him richly tenfold heaps of gain.<br> But he who's left his corn in garners, to be used,<br> Mules, horses, mice, and accidents have it reduced.</p>  
 <p>This world's a negative; the positive seek thou.<br> All outward forms are cyphers; search, the sense to know.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></a></p>  
 <p>Lay down thy wretched life before th’ uplifted sword;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_350">350</a></font></span> New life thou’lt purchase, never-ending, of the Lord.<br> But if thou do not know, well, how to quit this scene,<br> To me, then, lend thy ear; this tale for thee I mean.</p>  
 <p>In days of old there was a Caliph, as is said,<br> Whose generosity Hātim Tāyī ’d dismayed. <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> His fame for liberality went through the land;<br> All poverty, all want, relieved was at his hand.<br> The very sea went dry through his dispensing zest;<br> And rumours of his benefits spread east and west.<br> A fruitful cloud of rain was he to this our race;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_355">355</a></font></span> In turn, the object he of God's surpassing grace.<br> So large his gifts, that seas and mines were out of date.<br> Still fame brought caravans of suitors to his gate,<br> His courts and halls the temples of the indigent.<br> The noise had gone abroad how largely he had spent.<br> The Persian, Roman, Turk, and Arab, all were there,<br> And all admired his liberalities so rare.<br> A Fount of Life was he, a very sea of gift.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_359">359</a></font></span> All nations profited,—in praise their voice did lift.</p>

The congregation increasing, he was obliged to adopt the use of a raised platform, a kind of pulpit, so as to be seen and heard of all. The deserted pillar is the one spoken of.</p>

His full name was Hātim, son of ‘Abdu-’llāh, son of Sa‘d, of the tribe of Tayyi’. For instances of his generosity, as handed down by tradition from a time shortly prior to the promulgation of Islām, see Mr. Clouston's "<i>Arabian Poetry for English Readers</i>," p. 406; London, 1881; Trübner &amp; Co., Ludgate Hill. But Hātim lived and died before the Caliphs ruled. He, too, was a poet.</p>
