 <p>He answered them: "Sure! Sure!

 <p>Abashed they were not; answer thus they promptly made:<br> "To gain aught from the poor is fraud; a trick of trade.<br> There is no gain so good as trust placed in the Lord.<br> What more praiseworthy than to build upon His word?<br> How many flee <i>this</i> danger, falling into <i>that!</i> <br> From fryingpan leaps one, to light in fire right pat. <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Man plans a stratagem; in it is caught himself.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span> That which he took for health, he finds is death itself.<br> He locks his door when treason's lurking in his house.<br> So Pharaoh deemed he'd danger shun ere it should rouse.<br> How many thousand infants did he doom to death;<br> While Moses, whom he feared, his own roof was beneath.<br> Our eyes afflicted are with various kinds of ills.<br> Then go and make them blind, by seeing God ’tis wills.<br> God's sight of providence is keener than men's eyes.<br> By seeing with His sight, thou’lt find all thou wilt prize.<br> An infant, that can neither grasp nor walk as yet,</p>

 <p>The lion thus replied: "’Tis true.

 <p>Take favour for compulsion. Power will leave thy hands.<br> Compulsion dost affirm? That's sleeping by the way.<br> Go not to sleep until thou’st fairly won the day.<br> Sleep not, Compulsionist?

 <p>Strive not then, man of sense; except good name to leave.<br> Exertion's a delusion. Out! Thou sottish knave!"</p>  
 <p>A simpleton one morning rushing came in haste,<br> Where Solomon his court of justice then had placed.<br> His cheeks were blanched, his lips were blue; effects of fright.<br> Said Solomon to him: "What ails thee? Say aright."<br> Him answer’d that poor wretch: "The angel, Lord, of death, <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Upon me fixed, just now, a look that stopped my breath." <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span><br> Said Solomon: "What wilt thou I should do for thee?"<br> He answered: "That the wind may now commanded be <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> To carry me away forthwith to Hindūstān.<br> Perchance by fleeing thither, save my life I can."</p>  
 <p>See how mankind do shun the garb of poverty.<br> Hence they're a prey to greed and dire necessity.<br> This fear of poverty is like that man's dismay,<br> Its Hindūstān, remark, is greed and grasping's sway.</p>  
 <p>So Solomon the wind commanded, him, forthwith,<br> To bear to Hindūstān; and land him near some frith. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Another day as Solomon his court did hold,<br> Death's angel came; the king to him the matter told:<br> "Thy wrathful look, the other day, upon that man,<br> Has driven him his home to quit for Hindūstān.<br> Didst thou in wrath survey the pious man that way,<br> That he might wander forth a waif, like sheep astray?<br> Or was thy look's intent, so dreadful to behold,<br> His soul to separate from its corporeal fold?"</p>  
 <p>To him replied the angel: "King of sprites and men!<br> His fancy him misled; he'll ne’er do so again. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_70">70</a></font></span></p>

 <p>’Twas not in anger then that I did look on him;<br> ’Twas wonder him to see here, looking hale and prim.<br> For God had me commanded: 'Go this very day,<br> And take his soul in Hindūstān, his debt to pay.'<br> In wonder, then, I said within myself: 'Had he<br> A hundred wings, in Hindūstān he could not be.'<br> But going, still, by God's command, to Hindūstān,<br> Him there I found, and took his soul with my own hand."</p>  
 <p>So thou, good reader, understand, the things of earth<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span> ’Tis God ordains. Reflect. ’Twas written ere his birth.<br> From whom to flee? From self? Oh! That's absurd!<br> From whom to steal? From God? Worse, worse! No word!</p>  
 <p>The lion now remarked: "The words you speak are true.<br> But just consider how the prophets, saints, ensue.<br> What they have wrought hath God blessed, made to prosper still;<br> Their joys and griefs, their sufferings, pains, were by His will.<br> Their stratagems dictated by their God were, all. <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> 'Who comes of gentle blood, will gentle words let fall.' <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Their traps have taken angels with the baits they placed.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_80">80</a></font></span> Their seeming slips and faults were all by wisdom traced.<br> Exert thyself, O man; put shoulder to the wheel,<br> The prophets and the saints to imitate in zeal.<br> Exertion's not a struggle against Providence.<br> ’Twas Providence enjoined it,—made it our defence.<br> Blasphemer may I be, if ever single man<br> Bestowed in vain one effort to fulfil God's plan.<br> Thou hast no broken bones; why bind thy limbs in splints?<br> Have patience yet awhile; then laugh; we're not mere flints.</p>

We are all in prison here.<br> Burst, then, thy prison gate, and free thyself from fear.<br> What is the world? Unmindful of our God to be;<br> Not gold or silver, wife or children, things we see.<br> The wealth we hold at service of our God is blest.<br> 'The riches of the just are pure,' Ahmed confess’d. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_90">90</a></font></span><br> The water from a leak is danger to a ship;<br> The sea beneath her keel is just what makes her skip.<br> Great Solomon despised wealth, sway, with all his heart.<br> With countless treasures poor he named himself.

 <p>Of this complexion, many proofs the lion brought;<br> No answer those compulsionists in dispute sought.<br> The fox, the deer, the hare, and eke the sly jackal,<br> Were fain to quit compulsion's cause, for good and all.</p>

 <p>But lo, at length the lot upon the hare did light.<br> He found it very hard, and wailed his awful plight.<br> The other beasts remarked: "We each have had our turn;<br> And none of us refused th’ agreement to confirm.<br> By breach of faith on us fresh infamy bring not.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_105">105</a></font></span> Begone forthwith; the lion must not be forgot."</p>  
 <p>The hare replied: "Dear friends, a respite to me grant.<br> A stratagem I'll plan, and cheat this grim tyrant.<br> My wily plan shall save the souls of all alive;<br> And safety heirloom be your children shall derive.<br> Thus every prophet's promised to his sect, at least,<br> Salvation from the doom o’erhanging man and beast.<br> They found a ready way to ’scape beyond the spheres,<br> So soon as to reflect they turned their minds from fears.<br> Man sees another's eye is but a wee, wee thing;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span> He knows how great a service can th’ eye's pupil bring."</p>

 <p>Enough we've said of this. Now turn we to our tale.<br> By puss the lion's held right hungry in the vale.<br> And so it was; the hare his counsel did conceal;<br> He would not let his comrades learn how he would deal.<br> Some hours he now let pass before he took his leave;<br> Then to the lion went, their honour to retrieve.</p>  
 <p>He found the brute impatient, chafing at delay,<br> From hunger's pangs fierce howling, tearing every spray;<br> And roaring in his rage: "I knew it so would be!<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_165">165</a></font></span> Those vile, time-serving rascals!

 <p>The birds about their secrets one by one communed;<br> About their knowledge, sciences, and voices tuned.<br> To pay their court to Solomon their notes they raised;<br> Revealed their capabilities; skill of each praised.<br> Not out of pride and vanity; excess ’twould seem;<br> But solely to please Solomon, gain his esteem.</p>  
 <p>So slaves that seek for favour at a master's hand<br> Exert themselves to name the talents they command.<br> But if they feel ashamed of one would them purchase,<br> Straightway they're sick, halt, deaf, or something still more base. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_330">330</a></font></span></p>

 <p>Said Solomon: "Let's hear it. What then is thy skill?"<br> The hoopoe answered: "This.—I perch where’er I will.<br> From my seat I look down like plumbline on the ground,<br> And see if hidden water under it is found;<br> Where is it; at what depth; what are its qualities;<br> Whence takes its rise; from rock, sand, clay's varieties. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_335">335</a></font></span><br> O Solomon, whene’er thou send’st thy armies forth,<br> Me call to mind; my skill is surely notice worth."</p>

 <p>The crow on hearing this with jealousy was stung.<br> Addressing Solomon, he said: "This bird a lie has sung.</p>

 <p>Said Solomon: "O hoopoe, true is this remark.<br> A gulp of vanity has set thee raving, stark.<br> How is it thou’rt so tipsy early in the day,<br> To come and prate of things so far out of the way?"</p>

 <p><a name="page_m95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></a></p>

 <p>The hare then: "In this well thy foe takes his repose.<br> His stronghold is this pit, where he's secure from woes.<br> A wise man hides himself at bottom of a well;<br> For ’tis in solitude heart's choicest raptures dwell.<br> Seclusion's gloom is easier borne than wrongs from men.<br> Who craves a victor's mercy, saves his life just then."</p>  
 <p>The lion muttered: "Onward come. My arm is strong.<br> Go look. At home is he? He'll not live long."<br> The hare: "Alas! Already I've endured his gaze.<br> Take me unto thy breast.

 <p>The lion took him on his back without more fuss.<br> So, under this protection to the well went puss.<br> They both looked down; and in the water there<br> Reflection shadowed forth a lion and a hare.<br> The lion saw his own shape in the water shine:<br> "Another lion," thought he, "with fat hare on chine."<br> His foe he fancied, thus, that in the well he'd spied.<br> The hare he set down safely; in leapt he with pride. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_425">425</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>He thus fell in the pit he had for others dug.<br> Iniquity will visit those who drink out of her mug.<br> Iniquity's a pit into which tyrants fall.<br> Such is the firm conviction of our wise men all.<br> The wickeder a man, the deeper does he sink.<br> So justice wills; and so, the wrong’d will doubtless think.</p>  
 <p>O thou who in thy might injustice dost commit,<br> For thy own self a pit thou diggest; our tale to wit.<br> Thou weavest round thyself a web, as does silkworm;<br> Thou’lt not escape unless to justice thou conform. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_430">430</a></font></span></p>

Then the Lord's wrath shalt thou see.<br> Whenever wrong's weak victim on his God doth call,<br> A clamour rises from the ranks in heaven's hall.<br> If with his blood, in pride, thou stain thy teeth just now,<br> The toothache shall avenge him; dentist's victim thou.</p>  
 <p>The lion saw himself reflected in the well.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_435">435</a></font></span> Through blindest rage himself from foe he could not tell.<br> He thought his own reflection was his hated foe,<br> And slew himself while seeking on him to work woe.</p>  
 <p>So tyrant, when thou seest injustice in the world,<br> Thyself behold. Those deeds thy banner have unfurled.<br> Thine are included with them in God's just decree.<br> Thy rage, greed, lust's reward most certainly thou’lt see.<br> They are thy very self; in them thou art condemned.<br> Thou judgest them; in selfsame manner thou’rt contemned.<br> In thy own acts thou seest not the sin thou work’st;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_440">440</a></font></span> Or otherwise thy own self's foe thou’dst be from first.<br> It is thyself against whom thou mak’st thy attack;<br> Just as the lion took the hare upon his back.<br> If thou’d sound deep to bottom of the moral well.<br> Thyself thou’dst find there; thy own acts would plainly tell.</p>  
 <p>The lion at the bottom found out who was there.<br> Let him as likeness serve of many who are here.<br> Whoe’er beats out the teeth of weaker than himself,<br> Commits the lion's error;—springs upon himself.</p>  
 <p>O thou who loath’st a mole upon thy neighbour's cheek,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_445">445</a></font></span> Reflect. ’Tis but an image. Thy own features seek.</p>

 <p>Believers are as mirrors; each sees self in each.<br> So said the Prophet. His words to us truth may teach.</p>  
 <p>Thou wearest spectacles, of blue, or red, or green;<br> And thence thou judgest all is tinged with that sheen.<br> If thou wilt use a window glazed with coloured glass,<br> Thou may’st expect the sun will seem of that same class.<br> If thou’rt not mad, thou’lt know the colour is thy own.<br> Thyself call evil. Henceforth others leave alone.</p>  
 <p>Believers see with eye of faith the light of God.<br> How else to them were visible all things’ synod? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_450">450</a></font></span><br> If thou examine things with hell-fire in thy heart,<br> How canst thou see distinct the good and bad apart.<br> Seek by degrees to drown that fire in holy light.<br> So shalt thou, sinner, soon, thy weakness change for might.</p>  
 <p>And do Thou, Lord, asperge from mercy's cleansing stream,<br> To change the fire of sin to light of faith supreme.<br> The ocean's waters are a mere drop in Thy hand;<br> The streams of mercy, fire of wrath, at Thy command.<br> If Thou so will, the fire a pleasant stream may be.<br> And at Thy word, a lake a fiery pit we'd see. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_455">455</a></font></span><br> From Thee spring our devotions, supplications, prayers.<br> ’Tis Thou deliverest the victims from their slayers.<br> Without our supplication, Thou entreaty gayest.<br> The stores of Thy great mercy for all men Thou savest.</p>  
 <p>The hare, for his deliverance, jubilant set out,<br> To join his fellows, scattered in their homes about.<br> He saw the lion prone at bottom of the well;<br> Then rapidly went back his stratagem to tell.<br> He clapped his hands for joy at his escape from death,<br> Exuberant as plant sprouts from the earth beneath. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_460">460</a></font></span><br> Its stalk and leaf break forth from prison underground.<br> It rears itself apace, makes friends with th’ air around.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>The leaves burst from the stem, and spread themselves abroad;<br> Until by growth a tree, whose grace all men applaud.<br> It now expands in thanks for favours of the Lord;<br> Each leaf, flower, fruit intones a hymn of praise, like bard.<br> "Thou, Giver of all good things, nourishedst my root.<br> And madest me become a strongly growing shoot."</p>  
 <p>Our souls, shut up in prison in our frames of clay,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_465">465</a></font></span> So break forth into raptures when they're called away.<br> They dance for very joy, from love of God All-wise,<br> When, like full moon perfected, they in glory rise.<br> Material beings, thus, their dance perform, and souls.<br> Ask not of them the subject of their hyperboles.</p>  
 <p>The hare had lodged the lion in a dungeon safe.<br> More shame for lion was it, hare should make him chafe.<br> Just so a shame it is, and subject for surprise,<br> The state in which he's left, who Fakhru-’d-Dīn would rise. <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> O, he's a lion, sure, at bottom of a well.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_470">470</a></font></span> His pride of flesh the hare that cast him down to hell.<br> His pride, the hare, at large, disporting as it will;<br> Himself down in the pit.

 <p>The lion-slaying hare now scampered to his friends,<br> Exclaiming: "Good news bring I; let joy know no ends<br> Good news! Good news!

 <p>A convocation now was held by all the beasts,<br> Hilarity and joy enlivened all their breasts.<br> About the hare, as candle, they, moths-like, all flocked.<br> All their respects presented; none were found who mocked.<br> They all declared: "Thou art an angel by heaven sent<br> (Angel of death, however, he to lion went).<br> Whatever thou may’st be, our souls thy sacrifice!<br> Thou’st triumphed.

 <p>Quoth he: "Most venerable Sirs!

 <p>Joy not o’er great prosperity.
