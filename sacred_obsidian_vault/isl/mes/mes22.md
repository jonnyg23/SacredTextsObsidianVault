 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A merchant</span> there was, who a parrot did own;<br> Confined in a cage, wisest bird in the town.<br> This merchant to journeying made up his mind<br> To fair Hindūstān, there some rich wares to find.<br> From generous motives, to each of his slaves,<br> To male, and to female, some gift to bring craves.<br> He made them all tell him what best they would like;<br> And promised to bring it, most gentlemanlike.<br> He said to the parrot: "Poll! Poll! With the rest,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span> From Hind I must bring thee what thou mayst like best."</p>  
 <p>The parrot replied: "Sure, thou’lt see parrots there,<br> To them pray impart how it is that I fare.<br> Inform them, a parrot who loves them all well,<br> By thee's kept confined, close shut up in a cell.<br> He sends you his love, and his very best wish;<br> Desiring from you wise advice, parrotish.<br> He fears he may pine, through longing to see<br> His dear absent friends,—die in foreign countree.<br> He asks if it is altogether thing fit,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> That he should be caged, while you on the trees sit.<br> If this is the way in which true friends should act;<br> Leave him in his cage, while you forests affect.<br> He wishes you'd call to your mind your lost friend,<br> When drinking your bumpers, ere fieldward you wend. <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>’Tis sweet to be thought of by far-away dame,<br> One's sweetheart, whose love's set one's heart in a flame.<br> While you are disporting with those you love best,<br> He's eating his heart out; grief gives him no rest.<br> One bumper you'll drink for the love of poor Poll, <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> If only you wish him your love to extol. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span><br> Or, thinking of him who's in slavery kept,<br> Your bowl's whole contents dash to earth, as though wept.<br> O where is the promise, and where is the oath,<br> Th’ engagements sworn to him by sugarsome tooth? <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> If absence of his came from truancy's pranks,<br> You've set your forgetfulness ’gainst his sin's ranks.<br> The ills you inflict out of spite and disdain<br> Are sweet to your lover, he does not complain.<br> Your petulance prized is beyond fairy gifts;<br> Your vengeance most dear is; his hope it uplifts. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span><br> No soul can imagine what pleasure is felt,<br> Or grace seen, in all the fell blows you have dealt.<br> Your wrath is thus sweet; how much more so your grace!<br> If mourning so grieve, what from feast would take place?<br> He weeps; but he hopes you'll believe not his tears;<br> And, out of affection, not lessen his fears.<br> He loves your great kindness, your anger as well.<br> He equally dotes on those opposites fell.<br> The thorn escape should he, and visit the rose,<br> He'd warble as nightingale, moved by love's throes. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span><br> Most wondrous this bird's strangest use of his bill;<br> With thorns, as with roseleaves, he would his mouth fill.<br> Not nightingale this; fiery dragon it is;<br> All wrongs seem to him, through his love, purest bliss.<br> He loveth a rose, and himself is a rose.<br> He loveth himself; and seeks love for its woes."</p>

 <p>Just so is the soul. Its tale, just parrot's tale.<br> O where is the One to whom all souls make wail?<br> Where is the man, feeble, who's yet innocent?<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span> His heart, Solomon and his whole armament.<br> When he, with tears bitter, is heard to complain,<br> The seven vaults of heaven re-echo the strain.<br> In anguish he groans; God, in mercy, him hears.<br> His cry is: "O Lord!" And God wipes off his tears.<br> Abasement in him, is by God highly prized.<br> His blasphemies, o’er other men's faith are raised. <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Each instant, in soul, he ascends to heaven's gate;<br> His mitre's with crowns capped, of infinite state. <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> His frame's here on earth; his pure soul with the Lord<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span> In heaven's highest sphere, above man's thought or word.<br> A heaven such as this thou contemplatest not;<br> Thou every moment imaginest—what?<br> With him "<i>where</i>" and "<i>nowhere</i>" are quite equal felt.<br> To angels the "<i>four rivers</i>" seem a mere belt. <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Break off we this theme. Let's discuss other things.<br> Cease trifling. "’Tis God who knows best" sense's rings. <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> Let's seek to inquire how it fares with our friends,—<br> The merchant, his parrot. Who is’t understands?</p>  
 <p>The former had promised, at latter's request,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span> To give to the birds of far Hind his bequest.<br> So when he had reached that land, greatly renowned<br> In wooded retreat, flock of parrots he found.<br> He stopped his beast, cried out, at top of his voice,<br> That message his Polly had made, as his choice.</p>

 <p>One bird of the flock, he saw, then took to quake,<br> Fell prone to the earth; no more breath seemed to take.<br> The merchant regret felt for what he had done,<br> Exclaiming: "Alas! The poor bird I've slain, lone!<br> That creature was surely related to Poll;<br> Two bodies; one soul; just as is magic doll. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span><br> Why did I deliver that fatal message?<br> I've killed a collateral of Poll's lineage!"</p>  
 <p>The tongue, by itself, acts just like flint and steel.<br> A word from it, fire-like, we scathing can feel.<br> Strike not, then, so rashly, fire's sparks from thy tongue,<br> In message or talk, feeble hearers among.<br> The night is pitch dark; strewn around, cotton beds.<br> Amongst beds of cotton, ’tis, sparks one most dreads.<br> He sins who, unmindful of dire consequence,<br> Lets fall spoken spark,—fires a whole world, immense. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span><br> One rash word may set an assembly ablaze.<br> Molehills into mountains, and higher, it can raise.</p>  
 <p>In basis, our souls would appear Jesus-like.<br> To kill, to resuscitate, words are godlike.<br> If lifted could be from our souls the dark veil,<br> Each word of each soul would with miracles trail.</p>  
 <p>Dost wish to speak always to men with sweet words?<br> Have patience. Impatience must not fret the cords.<br> ’Tis patience beloved is by all men of sense.<br> Impatience a fault is, of children, intense. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span><br> Who patience exhibits shall mount to heaven's dome.<br> Impatience who showeth, tastes wrath that's to come.</p>

 <p>He's whole, and he's sound; strict diet's his rule.<br> Poor students are healthy in fever's dread school.<br> The Prophet has cautioned: "Brave though you may be,<br> Commit not mad rashness, howe’er the foe flee."</p>  
 <p>Within thee's a Nimrod. Approach not the fire.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span> Approach it thou must? To be Abr’am aspire.<br> A swimmer thou art not;—nor seaman by trade;<br> From headstrongness strive not the deep sea to wade.<br> From fire Abr’am brought forth a fresh-plucked red rose.<br> A diver, from sea-bottom, pearls' store can choose.<br> A saint handles earth, turns it straightway to gold.<br> A sinner, by touch, to earth turns this;—behold.<br> A just man's accepted of God, the Most High.<br> His deeds are the works of God's hand, still.

First cast ye down your wands.<br> Produce to our sight the tricks ye’ve in your hands."<br> The honour thus paid was a slur on their faith,<br> Removing contention from out of their path.</p>

 <p>The "perfect man "'s free both to eat and to speak. <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> If thou art " imperfect," eat, speak not, in freak. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span><br> Thou art but an ear.

 <p>A newly-born infant, still sucking the breast,<br> Is speechless some while. He's all ear, at the best.<br> His lips to keep closed he has, for a set time;<br> To speak till he learns,—words to frame and to chime.<br> If ear he lend not, he'll not learn common sense;<br> Becomes laughingstock;—folly shows, most immense.<br> If hearing he have not, deaf being at root,<br> He mute must remain; no tongue has he, to boot. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_80">80</a></font></span><br> Since, then, we must listen, before we can speak,<br> Lend ear to thy teachers, to guide thee who seek.<br> A room should be entered, as rule, through its door.<br> Effects ever seek where thou seest their cause’ spoor.<br> The speech that has need to be heard by no ear,<br> The voice is of God; it's to us ever near.<br> Inventor is He.

 <p>Our merchant his trading had quickly despatched,<br> Then homeward he turned; with joy housedoor unlatched.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>To ev’ry male slave a rare present he brought;<br> For each of his handmaids some gift he had bought. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_105">105</a></font></span><br> The parrot him questioned: "What news bringest thou me?<br> And whom hast thou seen? What's been said? Tell. Let's see."<br> The merchant him answered: "I'm sorry for that.<br> I'd rather my hand eat, than tell it thee;—flat.<br> In thoughtlessness, folly, ah! why did I prate<br> About thy fool's message, until ’twas too late?"</p>  
 <p>The parrot then asked: "What's this fuss all about?<br> What's caused tribulation? Let's hear it right out."<br> The merchant now said: "I told all thy sad grief<br> To flock of green parrots;—so like thee, their chief. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span><br> Of them, one, affected with thy tale of woe,<br> Heart-broken, a gasp gave, expired, and fell low.<br> I conscience-struck was for the words I had said.<br> But what is the use? A word breathed can't be stayed."</p>  
 <p>A spoken word's arrow swift shot from a bow,<br> It can't be recalled, whate’er we may do.<br> An arrow once shot off will never come back.<br> At source, inundation alone can have check.<br> An outlet once found, there's no stoppage for it.<br> A world is then ruined, through lack of quick wit. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_115">115</a></font></span><br> Act, consequence little dreamt of may produce.<br> The progeny's far ’yond our power to reduce.</p>  
 <p>The work of one Maker ’s this universe all.<br> Our acts' consequences to our accounts fall.<br> Jack shoots off an arrow;—directs it to Jill.<br> The arrow poor Jill hits;—straightway does her kill.<br> If only it wound her, for great length of time<br> It tortures. Pain's God's work; wherever the clime.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></a></p>  
 <p>Should Jack, at that moment, expire from his fright,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span> To plague her Jill's wound would not cease, day or night.<br> If from the effect of great pain, then, she die,<br> Remote cause is Jack, still, of her misery.<br> Account he must render for those pangs of hers.<br> Although they're God's acts, man to man them refers.<br> And so propagation, seed-sowing, and all;<br> Effects of them operate. God's sole, the call.</p>  
 <p>A saint acquires powers, most astounding, from God. <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The flying bolt he can avert with a nod.<br> The door can be shut between cause, consequence,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_125">125</a></font></span> On saint's reclamation, by God's prescience.<br> He makes said unsaid, from beginning to end.<br> Hence, neither does skewer burn, roast to coal trend. <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> From every mind that has knowledge of fact,<br> Remembrance effaced is, though brains may be racked.<br> Of this, dost thou proof require, most worthy friend,<br> The text read: "What verse We annul, or We mend." <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Again: "They my warning made you to forget." <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> By these is oblivion's great power ’fore us set.</p>  
 <p>To make us remember, forget, they power have.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130">130</a></font></span> They've hearts subjugated o’er creation's wave.<br> Whene’er dull forgetfulness blinds eye of man,<br> No act can he do, howe’er wide his scan.<br> Dost dare, thou, great saints to make laughingstock? <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> To words of the Prophet give heed, silly block.<br> Earth's lords have dominion o’er bodies of clay.<br> Enlightened saints rule hold o’er hearts;—their own sway.<br> All acts are fruits, doubtless, of experience.<br> Man, then, is but pupil.

 <p>Remembrance, forgetfulness, both are of God.<br> Support and aid, too, must depend on His nod.<br> Of thoughts, God, men's good and bad souls voids, each night,<br> By millions. Since this has seemed good in His sight.<br> By day, their hearts fill with their thoughts all, again,<br> Those oystershells He fills with rich pearls amain.<br> He knows all the thoughts that here trouble our frames.<br> ’Tis He that gives guidance to souls in their games.</p>  
 <p>Thy talent, thy judgment, unto thee are given,<br> That means thou may’st have to redeem thy fallen leaven. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_140">140</a></font></span><br> The goldsmith's rich art's not by weaver possessed,<br> By jocund vein here, there another's distressed.<br> Though mind's frame and talents endowments are, all,<br> They seem to a foe mere machines for his thrall.<br> When sleep is departed, thoughts, talents return,<br> One's foe so comes back, has of war one more turn.<br> With dawn, all our thoughts, all our talents, awake,<br> As erst, good or bad; ere repose we could take.<br> So carrier pigeons, wherever they've been,<br> Return to their homes, quit the woodlands all green. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_145">145</a></font></span><br> We see, thus, that all things revert to their source.<br> Parts ever must go shares in whole's intercourse.</p>  
 <p>So soon as our bird heard that parrot's sad state,<br> A shudder he gave, fainted, grew stiff as slate.<br> The merchant, on seeing this, seized with dismay,<br> Himself dashed to earth; wished he'd been far away.<br> His clothes rent in sorrow; his beard he plucked out;<br> And moaned, in distress wildly sobbing, throughout:</p>

 <p><a name="fn_209"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_210">m117:1</a> This section purports to have been suggested by the following couplet from ‘Attar:—</p>  
 <p></p><dir>"O heedless child of lust, weep thou tears of blood.<br>  If a saint eat poison, honey-like ’tis food."</dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The original expression for "saint," here, is: "a man of heart."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_210"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_211">m118:1</a> Canonical "responsibility" falls on all of sane mind and adult age.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_211"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_212">m118:2</a> See note to dist. No. 33 of the present poem.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_212"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_213">m118:3</a> Qur’ān vii. 112, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_213"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_214">m119:1</a> By a "<i>perfect man</i>" a saint is intended; as by "imperfect," hero and before, an ordinary mortal is depicted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_214"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_215">m119:2</a> Qur’ān vii. 203; xlvi. 28. By "ear" and "tongue" a learner and a teacher are symbolised.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_215"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_216">m122:1</a> A hazardous assertion. See Anecdotes, Chap. iii., Nos. 2, 5, 7, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_216"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_217">m122:2</a> A proverbial expression, like: "All's well that ends well."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_217"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_218">m122:3</a> Qur’ān ii. 100.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_221">m122:6</a> The "<i>pupil</i>" of the eye; in Persian called "<i>the manikin;</i>" in Arabic, "<i>the man</i>." These both allude to the small image of ourselves seen reflected in the pupil.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_221"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_222">m124:1</a> This rhapsody is mystical, like the Song of Solomon. A "tongue" is a teacher, informant; a prophet; and, apparently, even God himself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_222"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_223">m124:2</a> Qur’ān xc. 1-4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_223"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_224">m125:1</a> "Other," as opposed to self; also opposed to "we two" in the case of lovers; it is a term much used in Eastern poetry and philosophy.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_226">m126:2</a> Allusion appears to be made to Qur’ān xxi. 107.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_227">m128:1</a> This section is stated to be a gloss upon the following apostolic tradition: "Verily, Sa‘d is really jealous; but I am more jealous than he, and God than I. Out of His jealousy hath He made all excesses sinful; whether of outer or of the inner man." This Sa‘d, son of ‘Ubūda, was a disciple of Muhammed, and the most munificent man in Madīna. He embraced the faith before the Hijra. See An-Nawāwī, p. 274, l. 5.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_228"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_229">m129:1</a> The poet's "love," is still God.

 <p><a name="fn_234"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_235">m132:1</a> Qur’ān lv. 29.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_235"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_236">m135:1</a> This section purports to be a dissertation on the dictum: "What God wills, is."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_236"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_237">m135:2</a> Man's "record" is the register of his thoughts, words, and deeds, kept by angels, to be produced in the last judgment.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_237"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_238">m137:1</a> The same word in Persian, <i>bū</i>, signifies "odour" and "hope." The thing hoped for becomes a distant, odoriferous flower.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_238"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_239">m137:2</a> Qur’ān ii. 23, and forty places in all.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_239"></a><a href="mes22.htm#fr_240">m137:3</a> Jacob is said to have wept himself blind on losing Joseph; the smell of his son's coat, when refound, later, restored him.</p>
