 <img src="img/m21800.jpg" alt="The Lion's Hunt, in Company."></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A lion</span>, wolf, and fox together went to hunt;<br> Among the hills, in quest of game, they turned their brunt.<br> By mutual help and aid, they hoped to make the field<br> Too hot for other animals not under union's shield.<br> Co-operating with each other, they surmised,<br> A heavy bag they each would make of what each prized.</p>  
 <p>’Tis true, the noble lion felt of this ashamed.<br> Still, he politely showed towards them his spirit tamed.<br> A king feels inconvenienced by throngs of troops;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span> But out of kindness makes them share his warlike swoops<br> The sun would feel ashamed, did stars with him appear;<br> ’Tis generous in the sun to grace the starry sphere.<br> ’Twas God's command to Ahmed still: "With them consult." <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> True, they gave no advice; no counsel did result.<br> Upon the balance barley's weighed, as well as gold;<br> But barley, thence, has not acquired gold's value told.<br> The spirit with the flesh is fellow-traveller now;<br> A dog has sometimes charge of palace-yard below.</p>  
 <p>The company, then, set out for the woods amain,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> As followers of the lion's majesty, and train.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p>A mountain-ox, an ibex, next a hare, they took;<br> Since fortune smiled on them in each succeeding nook.<br> A lion's followers on the plain of strife and war,<br> Of food, by day or night, shall know no want, no bar.</p>  
 <p>Their prey they carried from the hills into the plain;<br> Or dead, or sorely wounded;—bleeding, or clean slain.<br> The wolf and fox were moved to pitch of keen desire,<br> To see the prey shared out with justice by their sire. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span><br> The shade of their cupidity caught Leo's eye,<br> He understood their confidence, their longing's dye.<br> Whoe’er has insight to the hearts and minds of men,<br> Knows at a glance what's passing under his sharp ken.<br> Beware, O heart, thou ever-fond one, in his sight,<br> Thy secret to betray,—thy wish to bring to light!<br> He knows it all, though ignorance he may pretend;—<br> His smile is but a veil thy aim to comprehend.</p>  
 <p>The lion, having measured all their secret thought,<br> Made no remark; he knew how they could both be bought; <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span><br> Within his breast revolved their fitting punishment:<br> "I'll show you, my fine fellows, what's by <i>lion</i> meant.<br> My pleasure's, for you both, what you should seek to know;<br> Not calculate beforehand what I may bestow.<br> Your every thought should but reflect my sovereign will,<br> And thankfully await what I may give you still.<br> Have pictures aught to say to guide the artist's hand?<br> His cunning ’tis decides what portrait shall expand.<br> So all your paltry surmise of my royal mind<br> An insult is,—an arrogance,—that must be fined. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span><br> 'They who conceive an evil thing of God' <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">1</font></a> are cursed;<br> And if I spare you, justice will be clean reversed.<br> To rid the world of scandal, I must end your lives;<br> Your story shall a moral point; whoe’er contrives."</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></a></p>  
 <p>With this he smiled again most grimly on the pair.<br> Trust not a lion's smile, all ye to live who care.<br> The riches of the world are smiles of Providence;<br> They make men proud, and lead them to their fate prepense.<br> Through poverty and suffering we may escape<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span> The trap that riches bait; and so avoid the scrape.</p>  
 <p>The lion now addressed the wolf: "Share out the spoil.<br> Do justice to us all. Thou’rt versed in cunning's foil.<br> Be thou my factor. Carve the game as may be fit.<br> So shalt thou honour win from all who see thy wit."<br> The wolf then: "Royal Sir, the mountain-ox is thine.<br> Thou’rt great; the ox is large and fat; let none repine.<br> The ibex is my share. As I, so it's the mean.<br> And thou, O fox, shalt have the hare. ’Tis not too lean."</p>  
 <p>The lion interposed: "Wolf! What is this thou’st said?<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span> I present; and to talk of ' thou ' and 'I,' so staid I<br> What rubbish is a wolf, to deem himself a judge<br> In presence of a lion, who'll soon make him budge?<br> Come hither, ass! Thyself alone it is thou’st sold!"<br> With this he tears the wolf to pieces, all too bold.</p>  
 <p>He saw the wolf had not one grain of common sense;<br> So stripped him of his hide, his life, his brain so dense.<br> Then said: "Since sight of me chased not all thought of self<br> From thee, death by my paw was due, thou wretched elf!<br> Thyself thou shouldst have vanquished in my presence dread.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span> Not having done so, thou’rt now numbered with the dead."</p>  
 <p>"All perisheth, except His counsel" ’s holy writ. <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> If we're not of "His counsel," life cannot us fit.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>He that will lose his life for God's sake, hath it still;<br> "All perisheth" hath then no power his soul to kill.<br> He's of th’ excepted; not of those to perish doomed.<br> For, who's excepted, saved is he. His spring hath bloomed.<br> But he that, in God's court, of "me" and "thee" shall prate,<br> Will be cut off;—far banished from the heavenly gate.</p>  
 <p>A man once came and gaily knocked at a friend's door.<br> The other asked: "Who's there? Is this a threshing-floor?" <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span><br> "’Tis I," said he. "O then thou straight mayest go away.<br> ’Tis dinner-time. Mature, not crude, must be who'd stay.<br> Thou’rt thou? Most crude thou art; by rawness’ self estranged.<br> By fire of trial those crude humours must be changed.<br> ’Tis fire matures the crude. Let absence be the fire,<br> Shall purge thee of thyself, burn out all selfish mire."</p>  
 <p>Away he went in anguish; travelled a whole year;<br> Saw not his friend; so pined with yearning, anxious fear;<br> Matured his soul with suffering's searching throes and pains.<br> Then sought the door from whence he'd been repulsed, again. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span><br> He knocked anew,—his heart with many fears oppressed,<br> Lest from his lip some word unwelcome drop confessed.</p>  
 <p>Within, the question's heard: "Who knocks at my street door?"<br> He answered: "Thy own second self;—though all too poor."<br> The invitation followed: "Let myself walk in.<br> My cot's too small for two selves to find room therein.<br> The thread's not double in a needle's single eye.<br> As thou’rt now single, enter. Room thou’lt find. Pray, try!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p>The thread and needle have relation, each to each;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span> For needle's eye a camel's far beyond all reach.<br> How shall a camel ever be so fine and slim<br> Unless long fasting his redundant flesh should skim?<br> The hand of God is wanted, then, to make it pass<br> The God who by His word creates both man and grass.<br> Impossibilities are possibles to Him;<br> The stubbornest is docile when His will curbs whim.<br> The blind from birth, the leper, e’en the dead, arise,<br> Whole, sound, whene’er th’ Omnipotent "Come forth" but cries.<br> E’en non-existence, death of death, at His command,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span> Starts into life, compelled by His supreme demand.</p>  
 <p>Recite, my friend: "Each day He's busied with a work:" <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And know, He's never idle, unemployed to lurk.<br> His smallest daily toil,—a work like pleasure still,—<br> Is to send forth three armies, bound to work His will.<br> One, from the loins of spheres the elements to stir;<br> So that all plants may vegetate, from moss to fir.<br> One, from the wombs of mothers to earth's surface prone,<br> That male and female may increase, not lie like stone.<br> The third hence wends its way to sepulchre's dread bourn,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span> There to receive, at length, reward; and joy, or mourn.<br> Leave we this theme;—’tis endless,—never would have done.<br> Let's see, now, how the friends enjoyed themselves alone.</p>  
 <p>Our host invites his guest to enter, free from scorn:<br> "Thou’rt welcome, self of mine! We're not like rose and thorn.<br> Our thread is single,—free from knots and tangle; done,<br> As 'Be,' though duplex as to form, in sense is one."</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>That "Be" ’s a rope, of power collective, to the end<br> That nullity may be united to a friend.<br> Thus duplex means are wanted, for appearances;<br> Though, in effect, one means there be of all that is. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_70">70</a></font></span><br> The biped, as the quadruped, goes but one road.<br> The one-edged knife, the two-edged shears, make one inroad.</p>  
 <p>Observe yon pair of bleachers at their daily toil.<br> Apparently, they differ, combat, as they moil.<br> The one's for ever wetting cloths in their stream's tide,<br> The other dries them just as fast in hot noontide.<br> The first, again to soak the scarce-dried cloths makes haste;<br> As though in opposition to his partner's waste.<br> But, in reality, the two have but one aim:<br> Co-operation's what they jointly, both proclaim. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Each prophet, every saint, has his especial rite;<br> But, as all tend to God, they're one, multipartite.<br> Sleep overcomes alike the followers of all creeds;<br> As water makes all mills to turn and grind, at needs.<br> The water flows from upwards, down upon the mill;<br> Its flowing through the trough is but man's wants to fill.<br> No sooner has man's need been fully satisfied,<br> He turns the water off;—straight in its bed it's tied.</p>  
 <p>To teach men wisdom, stream of speech flows through the mouth;<br> But spirit hath another course, far less uncouth. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_80">80</a></font></span><br> Without a voice or repetition it rolls on,<br> As through elysium, streams;—flowers springing aye, anon.<br> O Lord! Do Thou vouchsafe to my weak, erring soul<br> To see the realm where, voiceless, spirit thoughts may stroll,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p>That so my mind, in glee, on foot or head, may wing<br> Its flight to the far bourn that parts from nothing, thing,<br> Careering o’er the boundless fields of ecstasy,<br> Where fancy joins reality in entity.<br> Far-reaching more ’s nonentity than fancy's stretch;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_85">85</a></font></span> And thus, his fancy is a source of woe to wretch.<br> Then, being's narrower far than fancy's power of wing;<br> E’en as the full moon wanes, till it becomes a string.<br> The world of matter and its forms is narrower still;<br> A prison all too strait for mind to have its will.<br> Plurality and composition are the cause;<br> Our senses these alone can comprehend, and pause.<br> Beyond our senses lies the world of unity.<br> Desirest thou unity? Beyond thy senses fly!<br> Divine command, "Be!" was one act; two-lettered word;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_90">90</a></font></span> Of grave import, though short, sprung from all being's Lord.<br> But leave we this, and turn to see how fares it now,<br> With our acquaintances, wolf, fox, and lion;—trow.</p>  
 <p>The lordly lion ’d torn poor wolf's head from his tail,<br> That so two heads there might not be for one avail.<br> "On them We vengeance took" <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">1</font></a> ’s a well-known sacred text;<br> Wherefore, poor wolf, not quash thyself, when lion's next?</p>  
 <p>The lion turned, then, to the fox, and bade him share<br> The prey they'd seized; that they might make a meal, not spare.<br> The wily fox, low bowing with a reverence meet,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_95">95</a></font></span> Said: "Sire, the ox your share is, for your breakfast treat.<br> The ibex, then, will suffice for your midday lunch,<br> To serve as stop-gap in the interval of munch.<br> The hare a light repast will furnish ere you sleep;<br> The royal paunch from indigestion's pains ’twill keep."</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>The lion answered: "Well said, fox. Thou’rt justice’ self.<br> Who taught thee with such judgment rare to portion pelf?<br> Where didst thou learn to do full justice with great art?"<br> Said he: "My Lord, to teach me was that dead wolf's part."</p>  
 <p>The lion thus replied: "For us much love thou’st shown.<br> Take thou all three unto thyself, as very own. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_100">100</a></font></span><br> Good fox! Thou’st given up thyself entire, for us.<br> Why should I injure thee? Thou’rt I myself. No fuss!<br> Myself am thine; the prey is thine; all,—every bit.<br> Exalt thy head above the spheres. For that thou’rt fit.<br> Thou’st taken warning from that wretched, selfish wolf.<br> No longer fox art thou, my lion, my own self!<br> A wise head ever lessons learns from others’ ills,<br> Who sees his neighbours victims fall, knows what them kills."</p>  
 <p>The fox now thanked his stars a hundred, thousandfold,<br> For that the lion first the wolf to share had told; <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_105">105</a></font></span><br> And reasoned: "Had he given me first his high command<br> To share the prey, my life I had not kept in hand.<br> Then praise to Him who ’th placed me low in this world's scale,<br> To follow after mightier ones when they regale."</p>  
 <p>So have we heard God's judgments wrought in ages past<br> On people of the eld;—set forth as mountains fast,<br> That we may learn from them,—the wolves of early days.<br> Then let us, as the fox, glean wisdom from those lays.<br> "God's people sanctified" ’s the title on us cast,<br> By God's own Prophet, truthful witness, and the last. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span><br> The bones, the skeletons of all those old-world wolves,<br> Consider well, ye readers;—think upon yourselves.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>Who's wise will from his heart cast out all fond conceits<br> Of greatness, when he hears of ‘Ād's <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Pharaoh's feats.<br> Unless he warning take from what on others fell,<br> Men shall a moral draw from his case, sad to tell.</p>  
 <p>Cried Noah: "Ye stiff-necked race! I am not I, indeed.<br> My self I've sacrificed; of God's love have I need.<br> From every fleshly sense and wish I'm severed, quite.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_115">115</a></font></span> God is my light, my mind, my visual organ's site.<br> I am not I. The breath I breathe is God's own breath.<br> Whoe’er gainsays this word, blasphemes, courts his own death.<br> Within my form of fox there lurks the lion's power;<br> Against this feeble fox ’tis useless now to lower.<br> Unless you lay aside scorn for my fox's form,<br> You'll hear the lion growl more fierce than raging storm."</p>  
 <p>If Noah had not possessed the mighty aid of God,<br> Could he a world have upside down turned with a nod?<br> Within his form whole herds of lions, as one paw,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span> Lay hid. A fire was he; the world a stack of straw.<br> That misled straw refused to pay its tithe to him.<br> Fire flashed. Forthwith the straw in smoke and flames sank grim.</p>  
 <p>Whoe’er ’gainst the hidden lion in saint's form<br> Upraise the voice of pride, like to our wolf, base worm,<br> Shall, like that wolf, be torn by lion piecemeal quite;<br> The text: "On them we vengeance took" he shall recite. <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> A stroke shall lay him low, as wolf by lion's paw.<br> A madman must he be who'd rush in lion's maw.<br> O that the stroke had fallen upon the body frail;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_125">125</a></font></span> And that the heart and faith had ’scaped! ’Twere vast avail!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>Upon this point I feel my strength must all give way.<br> How shall I tell the secrets of this mystic play?<br> Just like the fox, do you yourselves deny in all.<br> In lion's presence raise no cavil, or you'll fall.<br> Relinquish thoughts of "I" and "We" when "He" ’s afield.<br> The kingdom is the Lord's; to God the kingdom yield.<br> The straight way enter all, like paupers as you are.<br> The lion and the prey will both fall to your share.</p>  
 <p>God is a spirit pure. All-Glorious is His name!<br> He hath no need of praise, of honour, glory, fame! <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130">130</a></font></span><br> All these, and all besides, whatever may befall,<br> Upon His servants He bestows. He's Lord of all!<br> God hath no envy, wish, desire for creatures’ ruths;<br> And blessed is he who takes to heart this truth of truths.<br> ’Twas He created both worlds;—all their pomp and pride.<br> Shall He desire what He hath made in His own tide?<br> Keep, then, your hearts pure in the sight of God the Lord,<br> That you may never be ashamed of thought or word.<br> He knows the secrets, aims, desires of all your hearts;<br> They're patent to Him, as a hair in milk at marts. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_135">135</a></font></span><br> Whoever hath a breast cleansed from all thoughts of guile,<br> His breast a mirror is, where heavenly truths will smile.<br> Its secrets are all known to God;—its every part;<br> "Believer's heart's the mirror of believer's heart."<br> He tries our metal on the touchstone of His law.<br> The fine, the base, He will distinguish, without flaw.<br> Our talents being tried by His omniscient skill,<br> What's good, what's bad, will sure appear, plain, by His will. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_139">139</a></font></span></p>
