 <p>FROM ‘Alī may we learn sincerity of meeds.<br> "God's Lion" we may hold free from all gross misdeeds.<br> In fight he'd conquered one who'd earned a hero's crown.<br> His sword he'd swiftly raised, his victim to hew down.<br> That champion spat in ‘Alī's face, to mark disdain;<br> The face of one, the Prophet's pride, all saints’ chieftain.<br> He spat upon a face to which the moon bowed low,<br> And offered adoration in the temple's show.</p>  
 <p>That instant ‘Alī dropped his sword, high poised in air,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span> And left the spitter harmless;—action debonnair.<br> This raised the foe's astonishment; called forth his awe.<br> That pardon, that forgiveness, grew not from war's law.</p>  
 <p>He said to ‘Alī: "Thou thy sword hadst raised to slay.<br> Why hast thou dropt it now,—prolonged my forfeit day?<br> What hast thou seen, surpassing prowess of my arm,<br> That thus thou hast repented,—left me free from harm?<br> What may it be has calmed the fury of thy breast,<br> Which as the lightning gleamed, and, straightway sank to rest?<br> What didst thou see, that, by reflection on me cast,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> A spark has leapt to life in my despairing breast?<br> What was thy vision, far above the world of fact,<br> Than life far sweeter, whence my life receives new pact?</p>

 <p>For bravery, 'God's Lion' art thou justly named.<br> For kindness, I now know, thou art too little famed.<br> For generosity, thou’rt Moses’ cloud divine,<br> From which poured forth the quails and manna, as from mine!"</p>  
 <p>The clouds rain wheat. Man, then, by labour and by skill,<br> Reduces this to food, when finely ground in mill.<br> But Moses’ cloud, more generous far, with open hand,<br> Sent down in plenty food prepared, by God's command. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span><br> For them who ate at Providence's table, free,<br> God's mercy was displayed;—a banner all could see.<br> For forty years that daily bread—abounding grace—<br> Failed not. Fond expectation's utmost stretch took place.<br> But satisfaction followed not. The thankless crew<br> Demanded "leeks and onions;" as of old they knew. <a name="fr_408"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Ye who are Ahmed's people, graced beyond compare,<br> Are promised spiritual blessings till last judgment's blare.<br> Whoever says, at heart: "My trust is in the Lord," <a name="fr_409"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> God's promise: "Him I'll feed," will find a faithful word. <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">3</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span><br> Without a twist accept this promise, as is meet;<br> You'll find it in your mouth as milk and honey sweet.<br> To twist a term, and so deny gift's incidence,<br> Is to invent a cloak to change the word's true sense.<br> To think th’ expression's wrong sad weakness shows of mind;<br> Wisdom divine's a kernel; human reason, rind.<br> Twist then thyself; change not the sense of words divine;<br> Conceive thy nose at fault; chide not the sweet woodbine.</p>  
 <p>O ‘Alī! Thou who mind and eye entirely art!<br> Relate a little of the knowledge in thy heart. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span><br> Thy calmness is a sword that cleaves our minds in twain;<br> The fountain of thy wisdom makes us whole again.</p>

 <p>Speak out! I know these mysteries are Jehovah's own;<br> To kill without a sword's a power of God well known.<br> He is Creator, without limbs and without tools;<br> The Giver of all blessings, copious as sea's pools.<br> How many kinds of wine are savoured by our souls,<br> While eye and ear perceive not whence the wave that rolls!</p>

I'm stone of offence.</p>  
 <p>"Is this a spell to witch the eyes? Is it the truth?<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span> To me thou art a wolf; I'm Joseph to thee, sooth.<br> Though worlds there may be, eighteen thousand globes, and more;<br> Not every eye has power to witness all their store.<br> Disclose thy secret, ‘Alī,—God's own 'Chosen One!' <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> How many 'judges’ errors' work God's will alone!<br> Pray tell me what, just now, has been revealed to thee;<br> Or I'll disclose the vision I've been made to see.<br> If thou the secret keep, I will declare its sense,<br> Moon-like, on me thy knowledge shines, with light intense.<br> But if the moon's bright disk break forth from ’neath the cloud,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span> Poor midnight travellers safely, then, pursue their road.</p>

 <p>They then are safe from error, risk no wandering vain;<br> Protection of the moonlight shields from terror's chain.<br> The mutely-teaching promptings of the silvery moon,<br> If couched in words, would homewards guide us doubly soon."</p>

 <p>To him made ‘Alī answer: "For the truth I fight.<br> God's servant am I.

My trenchancy's union with God.<br> In battle, life I give. I slay not whom's downtrod.<br> Blood does not soil the blade I wield in righteous cause;<br> Nor gusts of passion raise a craving for applause. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span><br> A straw I'm not.

But from my soil flowers blow, and yield sweet scent.</p>  
 <p>"Just cause if I perceive, with foes when waging war,<br> I make no scruple, but my sword from blood debar.<br> For God's sake do I love.

 <p>I'm avarice, munificence, to one sole end.<br> I'm God's in all things.

 <p>That servant once again appealed and begged: "‘Alī!<br> Put me to death, that sin so heinous I may flee! <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_220">220</a></font></span><br> My life's at thy behest; forthwith pour out my blood!<br> So shall my soul escape the burden of crime's brood."</p>  
 <p>Then ‘Alī answered: "Should each sun-mote take a knife,<br> Or sword draw, with design to sacrifice thy life,<br> One single hair's-breadth could they not, yet, take effect,<br> Since Providence decrees ’tis thou must work that act.<br> But sorrow not! Thy intercessor I will be!<br> Lord of my soul am I;—not slave to fleshly fee.<br> My body frail no value has now in my sight;<br> From flesh when liberated shall my soul feel light. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_225">225</a></font></span><br> The dagger and the sword may take root in my limbs.<br> Death's but a banquet; wounds, a flower that graceful climbs." <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now, who can thus despise his body in his heart,<br> And yet feel greed for empire, or for pontiff's part?<br> He strove, ’tis evident, upon the judgment seat,<br> To set a good example to all future great;<br> To breathe a righteous spirit into monarchs’ breasts;<br> Make sure that goodly fruit come from their deeds and gests.</p>

 <p>If thou, too, so observe God's saints with envy's eyes,<br> Be sure thy vision's tainted. Satan's hatching lies.<br> Thou obstinate!

 <p>The Magian heard. The light flashed on his heart and soul.<br> The clouds of misbelief, as fog, away did roll.<br> He spake: "The seed of wrongfulness is what I've sown.<br> Thou’rt altogether different from what I've known.<br> Thou art a balance, with an equitable soul;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_265">265</a></font></span> Or rather, index art thou, of just balance-bowl.<br> Thou art become my kith and kin,—my brother true;<br> Thou art a ray to light the path I shall pursue.<br> The slave I have become of that fair Source of light,<br> From whence thou hast derived the beam that charms my sight.<br> The slave of every billow of that glorious Sea,<br> That casts such pearls ashore, as I admire in thee.<br> Teach me to formulate the motto of thy creed;<br> For, henceforth thou’rt my guide, of whom I stand in need."</p>
