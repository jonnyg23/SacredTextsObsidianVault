 <p align="center">MECCA. 17 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> BY the heaven, and by the NIGHT-COMER!<br> But who shall teach thee what the night-comer is?<br> 'Tis the star of piercing radiance.<br> Over every soul is set a guardian.<br> Let man then reflect out of what he was created.<br> He was created of the poured-forth germs,<br> Which issue from the loins and breastbones:<br> Well able then is God to restore him to life,--<br> On the day when all secrets shall be searched out,<br> And he shall have no other might or helper.<br> I swear by the heaven which accomplisheth its cycle,<br> And by the earth which openeth her bosom,<br> That this Koran is a discriminating discourse,<br> And that it is not frivolous.<br> They plot a plot against thee,<br> And I will plot a plot against them.<br> Deal calmly therefore with the infidels; leave them awhile alone.</p>
