 <p align="center">MECCA.--49 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> BY the MOUNTAIN,<br> And by the Book written<br> On an outspread roll,<br> And by the frequented fane, <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And by the lofty vault,<br> And by the swollen sea,<br> Verily, a chastisement from thy Lord is imminent,<br> And none shall put it back.<br> Reeling on that day the Heaven shall reel,<br> And stirring shall the mountains stir. <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> And woe, on that day, to those who called the apostles liars,<br> Who plunged for pastime into vain disputes--<br> On that day shall they be thrust with thrusting to the fire of Hell:--<br> "This is the fire which ye treated as a lie.<br> What! is this magic, then? or, do ye not see it?<br> Burn ye therein: bear it patiently or impatiently 'twill be the same to you: for ye shall assuredly receive the reward of your doings."<br> But mid gardens and delights shall they dwell who have feared God,<br> Rejoicing in what their Lord hath given them; and that from the pain of hell- fire hath their Lord preserved them.<br> "Eat and drink with healthy enjoyment, in recompense for your deeds."<br> On couches ranged in rows shall they recline; and to the damsels with large dark eyes will we wed them.<br> And to those who have believed, whose offspring have followed them in the faith, will we again unite their offspring; nor of the meed of their works will we in the least defraud them. Pledged to God is every man for his actions and their desert. <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> And fruits in abundance will we give them, and flesh as they shall desire:<br> Therein shall they pass to one another the cup which shall engender no light discourse, no motive to sin:<br> And youths shall go round among them beautiful as imbedded pearls:<br> And shall accost one another and ask mutual questions.<br> "A time indeed there was," will they say, "when we were full of care as to the future lot of our families;<br> But kind hath God been to us, and from the pestilential torment hath he preserved us;<br> For, heretofore we called upon Him--and He is the Beneficent, the Merciful."<br> Warn thou, then. For thou by the favour of thy Lord art neither soothsayer nor possessed.<br> Will they say, "A poet! let us await some adverse turn of his fortune?"<br> SAY, wait ye, and in sooth I too will wait with you.<br> Is it their dreams which inspire them with this? or is it that they are a perverse people?<br> Will they say, "He hath forged it (the Koran) himself?" Nay, rather it is that they believed not.<br> Let them then produce a discourse like it, if they speak the Truth.<br> Were they created by nothing? or were they the creators of themselves?<br> Created they the Heavens and Earth? Nay, rather, they have no faith.<br> Hold they thy Lord's treasures? Bear they the rule supreme?<br> Have they a ladder for hearing the angels? Let any one who hath heard them bring a clear proof of it.<br> Hath God daughters and ye sons?<br> Asketh thou pay of them? they are themselves weighed down with debts.<br> Have they such a knowledge of the secret things that they can write them down?<br> Desire they to lay snares for thee? But the snared ones shall be they who do not believe.<br> Have they any God beside God? Glory be to God above what they join with Him.<br> And should they see a fragment of the heaven falling down, they would say, "It is only a dense cloud."<br> Leave them then until they come face to face with the day when they shall swoon away:<br> A day in which their snares shall not at all avail them, neither shall they be helped.<br> And verily, beside this is there a punishment for the evildoers: but most of them know it not.<br> Wait thou patiently the judgment of thy Lord, for thou art in our eye; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord when thou risest up,<br> And in the night-season: Praise him when the stars are setting.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_128"></a><a href="052.htm#fr_128">3</a> The more prosaic style of this verse indicates a later origin than the context. Muir places the whole Sura in what he terms the fourth stage of Meccan Suras.</p>
