 <p align="center">MECCA.--55 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> The hour hath approached and the MOON hath been cleft:<br> But whenever they see a miracle they turn aside and say, This is well-devised magic.<br> And they have treated the prophets as impostors, and follow their own lusts; but everything is unalterably fixed.<br> A message of prohibition had come to them--<br> Consummate wisdom--but warners profit them not.<br> Quit them then. On the day when the summoner shall summon to a stern business,<br> With downcast eyes shall they come forth from their graves, as if they were scattered locusts,<br> Hastening to the summoner. "This," shall the infidels say, "is the distressful day."<br> Before them the people of Noah treated the truth as a lie. Our servant did they charge with falsehood, and said, "Demoniac!" and he was rejected.<br> Then cried he to his Lord, "Verily, they prevail against me; come thou therefore to my succour."<br> So we opened the gates of Heaven with water which fell in torrents,<br> And we caused the earth to break forth with springs, and their waters met by settled decree.<br> And we bare him on a vessel made with planks and nails.<br> Under our eyes it floated on: a recompence to him who had been rejected with unbelief.<br> And we left it a sign: but, is there any one who receives the warning?<br> And how great was my vengeance and my menace!<br> Easy for warning have we made the Koran--but, is there any one who receives the warning?<br> The Adites called the truth a lie: but how great was my vengeance and my menace;<br> For we sent against them a roaring wind in a day of continued distress:<br> It tore men away as though they were uprooted palm stumps.<br> And how great was my vengeance and my menace!<br> Easy for warning have we made the Koran--but, is there any one who receives the warning?<br> The tribe of Themoud treated the threatenings as lies:<br> And they said, "Shall we follow a single man from among ourselves? Then verily should we be in error and in folly.<br> To him alone among us is the office of warning entrusted? No! he is an impostor, an insolent person."<br> To-morrow shall they learn who is the impostor, the insolent.<br> "For we will send the she-camel to prove them: do thou mark them well, O Saleh, and be patient:<br> And foretell them that their waters shall <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">1</font></a> be divided between themselves and her, and that every draught shall come by turns to them."<br> But they called to their comrade, and he took a knife and ham-strung her.<br> And how great was my vengeance and my menance!<br> We sent against them a single shout; and they became like the dry sticks of the fold-builders.<br> Easy have we made the Koran for warning--but, is there any one who receives the warning?<br> The people of Lot treated his warning as a lie;<br> But we sent a stone-charged wind against them all, except the family of Lot, whom at daybreak we delivered,<br> By our special grace--for thus we reward the thankful.<br> He, indeed, had warned them of our severity, but of that warning they doubted.<br> Even this guess did they demand: therefore we deprived them of sight,<br> And said, "Taste ye my vengeance and my menace;"<br> And in the morning a relentless punishment overtook them.<br> Easy have we made the Koran for warning but, is there any one who receives the warning?<br> To the people of Pharaoh also came the threatenings:<br> All our miracles did they treat as impostures. Therefore seized we them as he only can seize, who is the Mighty, the Strong.<br> Are your infidels, O Meccans, better men than these? Is there an exemption for you in the sacred Books?<br> Will they say, "We are a host that lend one another aid?"<br> The host shall be routed, and they shall turn them back.<br> But, that Hour is their threatened time, and that Hour shall be most severe and bitter.<br> Verily, the wicked are sunk in bewilderment and folly.<br> On that day they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces. "Taste ye the touch of Hell."<br> All things have we created after a fixed decree:<br> Our command was but one word, swift as the twinkling of an eye.<br> Of old, too, have we destroyed the like of you--yet is any one warned?<br> And everything that they do is in the Books; <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Each action, both small and great, is written down.<br> Verily, amid gardens <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">3</font></a> and rivers shall the pious dwell.<br> In the seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King.</p>
