 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> By the train of THE SENT ones, <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And the swift in their swiftness;<br> By the scatterers who scatter,<br> And the distinguishers who distinguish;<br> And by those that give forth the word<br> To excuse or warn;<br> Verily that which ye are promised is imminent.<br> When the stars, therefore, shall be blotted out,<br> And when the heaven shall be cleft,<br> And when the mountains shall be scattered in dust,<br> And when the Apostles shall have a time assigned them;<br> Until what day shall that time be deferred?<br> To the day of severing!<br> And who shall teach thee what the day of severing is?<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> Have we not destroyed them of old?<br> We will next cause those of later times to follow them. <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Thus deal we with the evil doers.<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> Have we not created you of a sorry germ,<br> Which we laid up in a secure place,<br> Till the term decreed for birth?<br> Such is our power! and, how powerful are We!<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> Have we not made the earth to hold<br> The living and the dead?<br> And placed on it the tall firm mountains, and given you to drink of sweet water.<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> Begone to that Hell which ye called a lie:--<br> Begone to the shadows that lie in triple masses;<br> "But not against the flame shall they shade or help you:"--<br> The sparks which it casteth out are like towers--<br> Like tawny camels.<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> On that day they shall not speak,<br> Nor shall it be permitted them to allege excuses.<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> This is the day of severing, when we will assemble you and your ancestors.<br> If now ye have any craft try your craft on me.<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> But the god-fearing shall be placed amid shades and fountains,<br> And fruits, whatsoever they shall desire:<br> "Eat and drink, with health, <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">3</font></a> as the meed of your toils."<br> Thus recompense we the good.<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> "Eat ye and enjoy yourselves a little while. Verily, ye are doers of evil."<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!<br> For when it is said to them, bend the knee, they bend it not.<br> Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture<br> In what other revelation after this will they believe?</p>
