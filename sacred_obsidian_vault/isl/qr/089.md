 <p align="center">MECCA.--30 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> By the DAYBREAK and ten nights. <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> By that which is double and that which is single,<br> By the night when it pursues its course!<br> Is there not in this an oath becoming a man of sense?<br> Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with Ad,<br> At Irem adorned with pillars,<br> Whose like have not been reared in these lands!<br> And with Themoud who hewed out the rocks in the valley;<br> And with Pharaoh the impaler;<br> Who all committed excesses in the lands,<br> And multiplied wickedness therein.<br> Wherefore thy Lord let loose on them the scourge of chastisement, <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> For thy Lord standeth on a watch tower.<br> As to man, when his Lord trieth him and honoureth him and is bounteous to him,<br> Then saith he, "My Lord honoureth me:"<br> But when he proveth him and limiteth his gifts to him,<br> He saith, "My Lord despiseth me."<br> Aye. But ye honour not the orphan,<br> Nor urge ye one another to feed the poor,<br> And ye devour heritages, devouring greedily,<br> And ye love riches with exceeding love.<br> Aye. But when the earth shall be crushed with crushing, crushing,<br> And thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank,<br> And Hell on that day shall be moved up, <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">3</font></a>--Man shall on that day remember himself. But how shall remembrance help him?<br> He shall say, Oh! would that I had prepared for this my life! On that day none shall punish as God punisheth,<br> And none shall bind with such bonds as He.<br> Oh, thou soul which art at rest,<br> Return to thy Lord, pleased, and pleasing him:<br> Enter thou among my servants,<br> And enter thou my Paradise.</p>
