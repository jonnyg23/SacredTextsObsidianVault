 <p align="center">MECCA.--40 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> It needeth not that I swear by the day of the RESURRECTION,<br> Or that I swear by the self-accusing soul.<br> Thinketh man that we shall not re-unite his bones?<br> Aye! his very finger tips are we able evenly to replace.<br> But man chooseth to deny what is before him:<br> He asketh, "When this day of Resurrection?"<br> But when the eye shall be dazzled,<br> And when the moon shall be darkened,<br> And the sun and the moon shall be together, <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> On that day man shall cry, "Where is there a place to flee to?"<br> But in vain--there is no refuge--<br> With thy Lord on that day shall be the sole asylum.<br> On that day shall man be told of all that he hath done first and last;<br> Yea, a man shall be the eye witness against himself:<br> And even if he put forth his plea. . . . <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> (Move not thy tongue in haste to follow and master this revelation: <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> For we will see to the collecting and the recital of it;<br> But when we have recited it, then follow thou the recital,<br> And, verily, afterwards it shall be ours to make it clear to thee.)<br> Aye, but ye love the transitory,<br> And ye neglect the life to come.<br> On that day shall faces beam with light,<br> Outlooking towards their Lord;<br> And faces on that day shall be dismal,<br> As if they thought that some great calamity would befal them.<br> Aye, when the soul shall come up into the throat,<br> And there shall be a cry, "Who hath a charm that can restore him?"<br> And the man feeleth that the time of his departure is come,<br> And when one leg shall be laid over the other, <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> To thy Lord on that day shall he be driven on;<br> For he believed not, and he did not pray,<br> But he called the truth a lie and turned his back,<br> Then, walking with haughty men, rejoined his people.<br> That Hour is nearer to thee and nearer, <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> It is ever nearer to thee and nearer still.<br> Thinketh man that he shall be left supreme?<br> Was he not a mere embryo? <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">6</font></a><br> Then he became thick blood of which God formed him and fashioned him;<br> And made him twain, male and female.<br> Is not He powerful enough to quicken the dead?</p>

In either case we are led to the conclusion that, from the first, Muhammad had formed the plan of promulging a written book. Comp. Sura xx. 112.</p>
