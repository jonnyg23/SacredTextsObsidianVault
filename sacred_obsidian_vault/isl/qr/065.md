 <p align="center">MECCA.--12 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful</p>  
 <p>O PROPHET! when ye divorce women, divorce them at their special times. And reckon those times exactly, and fear God your Lord. Put them not forth from their houses, nor allow them to depart, unless they have committed a proven adultery. This is the precept of God; and whoso transgresseth the precept of God, assuredly imperilleth his own self. Thou knowest not whether, after this, God may not cause something new to occur which may bring you together again.</p>  
 <p>And when they have reached their set time, then either keep them with kindness, or in kindness part from them. And take upright witnesses from among you, and bear witness as unto God. This is a caution for him who believeth in God and in the latter day. And whoso feareth God, to him will He grant a prosperous issue, and will provide for him whence he reckoned not upon it.</p>  
 <p>And for him who putteth his trust in Him will God be all-sufficient. God truly will attain his purpose. For everything hath God assigned a period.</p>  
 <p>As to such of your wives as have no hope of the recurrence of their times, if ye have doubts in regard to them, then reckon three months, and let the same be the term of those who have not yet had them. And as to those who are with child, their period shall be until they are delivered of their burden. God will make His command easy to him who feareth Him.</p>  
 <p>This is God's command which He hath sent down to you: Whoso feareth God, his evil deeds will He cancel and will increase his reward.</p>  
 <p>Lodge the divorced wherever ye lodge, according to your means; and distress them not by putting them to straits. And if they are pregnant, then be at charges for the them till they are delivered of their burden; and if they suckle your children, then pay them their hire and consult among yourselves, and act generously: And if herin ye meet with obstacles, then let another female suckle for him.</p>  
 <p>Let him who hath abundance of his abundance; let him, too, whose store is scanty, give of what God hath vouchsafed to him. God imposeth burdens only according to the means which He hath given. God will cause ease to succeed difficulties.</p>  
 <p>How many cities have turned aside from the command of their Lord and of his apostles! Therefore did we reckon with them in a severe reckoning, and chastised them with a stern chastisement;</p>  
 <p>And they tasted the harmfulness of their own conduct: and the end of their conduct was ruin.</p>  
 <p>A vehement chastisement hath God prepared for them! Fear God, then, O ye men of understanding! <a name="fr_1103"></a><a href="#fn_1103"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>Believers! Now hath God sent down to you a warning! a prophet, who reciteth to you the clear signs of God, that he may bring those who believe, and do the things that are right, out of the darkness into the light. And-whoso believeth in God, and doeth the things that are right, God will cause them to enter the gardens beneath which the rivers flow, to remain therein for aye! A goodly provision now hath God made for him.</p>  
 <p>It is God who hath created seven heavens and as many earths. <a name="fr_1104"></a><a href="#fn_1104"><font size="1">3</font></a> The Divine command cometh down through them all, that ye may know that God hath power over all things, and that God in his knowledge embraceth all things!</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1102"></a><a href="065.htm#fr_1102">1</a> Comp. Sura [xci.] ii. 228, which this Sura is perhaps intended to supplement. Wahidi and Beidhawi state that it was revealed on account of Ibn Omar who had divorced his wife at improper time, and was obliged to take her again.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1103"></a><a href="065.htm#fr_1103">2</a> In order to make good the rhyme, verse 10 ought to be continued to the end of the first clause of verse II.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1104"></a><a href="065.htm#fr_1104">3</a> Lit. and of the earth, their likes. The style of this verse resembles that of the Meccan Suras. Hence, probably; a tradition in Omar ben Muhammad makes the whole Sura Meccan.</p>
