After a brilliant course of study he became master of sacred theology. For three years he read only the Scriptures, and knew the whole Bible by heart. He converted the Jews of Valencia, and their synagogue became a church.

He fell ill at Vannes in Brittany, and received the crown of everlasting glory in 1419.</p>
