 <p>ST. DAMASUS was born at Rome at the beginning of the fourth century.

On the death of Liberius our Saint was chosen to succeed him. Ursinus, a competitor for the high office, incited a revolt, but the holy Pope took only such action as was becoming to the common father of the faithful.

 <p>he convened several councils. He rebuilt the church of St. Laurence, which to this day is known as St. Laurence <i>in Damaso;</i> he made many valuable presents to this church, and settled upon it houses and lands in its vicinity. He likewise drained all the springs of the Vatican, which ran over the bodies that were buried there, and decorated the sepulchres of a great number of martyrs in the cemeteries, and adorned them with epitaphs in verse. Having sat eighteen years and two months, he died on the 10th of December, in 384, being near fourscore years of age.</p>
