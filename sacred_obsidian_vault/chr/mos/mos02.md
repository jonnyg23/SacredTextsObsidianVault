 <p>THERE are three ways in which this volume may be helpfully used.</p>  
 <p>1. By <b>reading straight through</b> as an ordinary book, making a pencil note in the margin of portions suitable for meditation and careful study.</p>  
 <p>2. Taking <b>chapter by chapter</b>, first reading the chapter in the Bible itself, then carefully noting the valuable and suggestive thoughts by this able minister of the Word of God.</p>  
 <p>3. As a <b>book of reference</b>. The <i>Subject Index</i> will readily indicate where any incident or event mentioned in the Gospel may be found. The Bible <i>chapters</i> are indicated at the head of each page, the verses at the beginning of each paragraph. The <b>black type</b> clearly indicates portions of the Gospel quoted.</p>  
 <p>Some of the quotations are from the Author's <i>New Translation</i> of the New Testament, now supplied in thin paper pocket edition, cloth, 2/; leather, 3/.</p>
