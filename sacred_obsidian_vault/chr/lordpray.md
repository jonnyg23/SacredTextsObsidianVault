 <h1>The Lord's Prayer in Latin:</h1>
 </center>
 
 PATER noster, qui
 es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum. Adveniat regnum
 tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra. Panem
 nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie, et dimitte nobis debita
 nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne
 nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo. Amen.

 <h1>The Lord's Prayer in English:</h1>
 </center>
          
 OUR Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy
 will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day
 our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
 those who trespass against us. And lead us not into
 temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
