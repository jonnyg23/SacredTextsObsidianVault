 </dir></dir></font><font size="5"><p>T</p></font>HOUGH I am young, a little one,<br>
 If I can speak, and go alone,<br>
 Then I must learn to know the Lord,<br>
 And learn to read his holy word.<br>
 'Tis time to seek to God, and pray<br>
 For what I want for every day<br>
 I have a precious soul to save,<br>
 And I a mortal body have.<br>
 Though I am young, yet I may die,<br>
 And hasten to eternity.<br>
 There is a dreadful fiery hell,<br>
 Where wicked ones must always dwell.<br>
 There is a heaven, full of joy,<br>
 Where godly ones will always stay.<br>
 To one of these in my soul must fly,<br>
 As in a moment, when I die.<br>
 When God, who made me, calls me home,<br>
 I must not stay; I must be gone.<br>
 He gives me life, he gives me breath,<br>
 And he can save my soul from death,<br>
 By Jesus Christ, my only Lord,<br>
 Aecordingr to his holy word.<br>
 He clothes my back, and keeps me warm,<br>
 He saves my bones and flesh from harm;<br>
 He gives me bread, and milk, and meat,<br>
 And all I have that's good to eat.<br>
 When I am sick, he, if he please,<br>
 Can make me well, and give me ease.<br>
 He gives me sleep and quiet rest,<br>
 Whereby my body is refreshed.<a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a><br>
 The Lord is good and kind to me,<br>
 And very thankful I must be.<br>
 I must not sin, as others do,<br>
 Lest I lie down in sorrow too;<br>
 For God is angry every day<br>
 With wicked ones who go astray.<br>
 From sinful words I must refrain;<br>
 I must not take God's name in vain<br>
 I must not work, I must not play,<br>
 Upon God's holy Sabbath day.<br>
 And if my parents speak the word,<br>
 I must obey them in the Lord,<br>
 Nor steal, nor lie, nor waste my days<br>
 In idle tales and foolish plays.<br>
 I must obey my Lord's commands,<br>
 Do something with my little hands.<br>
 Remember my Creator now,<br>
 In youth, when time will it allow.<br>
 Young Samuel, that little child,<br>
 He served the Lord, lived undefiled:<br>
 Him in his service God employed,<br>
 While Eli's wicked children died.<br>
 When wicked children, mocking, said<br>
 To a good man, <i>Go up, bald head</i>,<br>
 God was displeased with them, and sent<br>
 Two bears, which them in pieces rent<br>
 I must not, like these children vile,<br>
 Displease my God, myself defile<br>
 Like young Abijah, I must see<br>
 That good things may be found in me.<br>
 Young King Josiah, that blessed youth,<br>
 He sought the Lord and loved the truth,<br>
 He like a king did act his part,<br>
 And followed God with all his heart <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a><br>
 The little children, they did sing<br>
 Hosannas to their heavenly King.<br>
 That blessed child, young Timothy,<br>
 Did learn God's word most heedfully.<br>
 It seemed to be his recreation,<br>
 Which made him wise unto salvation,<br>
 By faith in Christ which he had gained,<br>
 By prayers and tears with faith unfeigned,<br>
 These good examples were for me;<br>
 Like these good children I must be.<br>
 Give me true faith in Christ my Lord,<br>
 Obedience to his holy word.<br>
 No word is in this world like thine;<br>
 There's none so pure, sweet, and divine.<br>
 From thence let me thy will behold,<br>
 And love, thy word above fine gold.<br>
 Mahe my heart in thy statutes sound,<br>
 And make my faith and love abound:<br>
 Lord, circumcise my heart to love thee,<br>
 And nothing in this world above thee.<br>
 Let me behold thy pleased face,<br>
 And make my soul to grow in grace,<br>
 And in the knowledge of my Lord<br>
 And Savior Christ, and of his word.

 <font size="5"><p>F</p></font>EAR thou the Lord, and prize him more<br>
 Than shining gold and richest ore<br>
 For when thy worldly treasure's past,<br>
 The love of God will ever last.
