 <i><font size="2"><p align="CENTER">Of the Fear of God</p></font></i>.
 <font size="5"><p>T</p></font>HEY that fear God least, have the greatest reason to fear him.
 <p>A fear of departing from God is a good means to keep us from departing from him.</p>
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p>
 <p>The more we fear God, the less we shall fear men,</p>
 <p>They that will not fear God in prosperity, will be afraid of him in adversity.</p>
 <i><font size="2"><p align="CENTER">Means to preserve Mercies</p></font></i>.
 <p>1. BE thankful for them.<br>
 2. Receive them as mercies, not as dues.<br>
 3. Prepare to part with them.<br>
 4. Expect the continuance of mercies from God; he is the strength of our life, the staff of our bread, the breath of our nostrils, and the length of our days.</p>
 <i><font size="2"><p align="CENTER">Of the Soul</p></font></i>.
 <p>IT matters not what a man loses, if he saves his soul; but if he loses his soul, it matters not what he saves.</p>
 <p>They that are least sensible of their souls wants are most miserable.</p>
 <p>It is our greatest wisdom to be watchful over the frame of our spirit--to observe what helps it and what injures it.</p>
 <p>If you lose your time, you lose your hopes; and if you lose your hopes, you lose your souls; and when your souls are lost, they shall never be ransomed: when your hopes are lost, they shall never be recovered; and when your time is lost, it shall never be redeemed.</p>
 <i><font size="2"><p align="CENTER">Of Death</p>
 </font></i><p>THF longest life is a lingering death,<br>
 First infancy dies, then childhood, then youth.</p>
