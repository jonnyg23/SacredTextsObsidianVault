            How great his Power is none can tell,

            Then let me join this holy Train;

         <center>
           And my first Off'rings bring; 
         </center>
         <center>
           The eternal GOD will not disdain 
         </center>
         <center>
           To hear an Infant sing.

           And Angels shall rejoice,

         </p><h3> CHRIST.</h3>
         If thou some longer time should have,  <br>
         Thou wouldst again to folly cleave:  <br>
         Therefore to thee I will not give,  <br>
         One day on earth longer to live.  
         <p>  
         </p><h3> Death.</h3>
         Youth, I am come to fetch thy breath,  <br>
         And carry thee to th' shades of death,  <br>
         No pity on thee can I show,  <br>
         Thou has thy God offended so.  <br>
         Thy soul and body I'll divide, </td>
     </tr>
     <tr> 
       <td><a name="Page80"></a>Thy body in the grave 
         I'll hide,  <br>
         And thy dear soul in hell must lie,  <br>
         With Devils to eternity.  
         <p>  
         </p><h3> <i>The conclusion.</i></h3>
         Thus end the days of woful youth,  <br>
         Who won't obey nor mind the truth;  <br>
         Nor hearken to what preachers say,  <br>
         But do their parents disobey.  <br>
         They in their youth go down to hell,  <br>
         Under eternal wrath to dwell.  <br>
         Many don't live out half their days,  <br>
         For cleaving unto sinful ways.

         to obey them in the LORD; their bible and catechism; their baptism; the 
         LORD's day; the LORD's death and resurrection; their own death and resurrection; 
         and the day of judgment, when all that are not fit for heaven must be 
         sent to hell. And they Should pray to GOD in the name of CHRIST, for saving 
         grace. </td>
