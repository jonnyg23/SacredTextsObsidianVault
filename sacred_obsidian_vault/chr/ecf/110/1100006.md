His intense moral earnestness has always been recognized, and the man has been honored because it was distinctly felt that the man gave power to the oration. “Golden mouth” avails little, unless it belongs to a golden man. The rhetorical training of his earlier years doubtless contributed much to his skill as a preacher, but his exegetical method was perhaps a still more important factor.</p>
