 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iii.xix-p2"></a>You accuse me of laziness and idleness, because I did not accept your Sasima, and because I have not bestirred myself like a Bishop, <a name="page_454"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 454</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.xix-Page_454"></a>and do not arm you against each other like a bone thrown into the midst of dogs.  My greatest business always is to keep free from business.  And to give you an idea of one of my good points, so much do I value freedom from business, that I think I might even be a standard to all men of this kind of magnanimity, and if only all men would imitate me the Churches would have no troubles; nor would the faith, which every one uses as a weapon in his private quarrels, be pulled in pieces.</p>
