 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.v.x-p2"></a>(Bosporius, Bishop of Colonia in Cappadocia Secunda, who had apparently taken a prominent part in the election and consecration of Eulalius to the See of Nazianzus, was accused of heresy by Helladius Archbishop of Cæsarea, and a Council met at Parnassus to try him, <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.v.x-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 383.  Gregory, not being able personally to attend this Synod, writes to Amphilochius, to beg him to undertake the defence of the accused.  The letter is lost, but Gregorys friend carried out his mission with success, and the following letter is to thank him for his kindness.)</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.v.x-p3"></a>The <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.v.x-p3.1"></a>Lord</span> fulfil all thy petitions (do not despise a fathers prayer), for you have abundantly refreshed my age, both by having gone to Parnassus, as you were invited to do, and by having refuted the calumny against the most Reverend and God-beloved Bishop.  For evil men love to set down their own faults to those who convict them.  For the age of this man is stronger than all the accusations, and so is his life, and we too who have often heard from him and taught others, and those whom he has recovered from error and added to the common body of the church; but yet the present evil times called for more accurate proof on account of the slanderers and evil-disposed; and this you have supplied us with, or rather you have supplied it to those who are of fickler mind and easily led away by such men.  But if you will undertake a longer journey, and will personally give testimony, and settle the matter with the other bishops, you will be doing a spiritual work worthy of your Perfection.  I and those with me salute your Fraternity.</p>
