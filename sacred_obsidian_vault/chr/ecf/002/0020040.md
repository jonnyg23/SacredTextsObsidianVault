 <p> <a name="iii.ii.iv"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.iv-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.—The Christians Worship God Alone.</h5>  
 <p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p1"></a>For what reason, men of Greece, do you wish to bring the civil powers, as in a pugilistic encounter, into collision with us? And, if I am not disposed to comply with the usages of some of them, why am I to be abhorred as a vile miscreant? <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">426</font></a>
  Does the sovereign order the payment of tribute, I am ready to render it. Does my master command me to act as a bondsman and to serve, I acknowledge the serfdom. Man is to be honoured as a fellow-man; <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">427</font></a>
  God alone is to be feared,—He who is not visible to human eyes, nor comes within the compass of human art. Only when I am commanded to deny Him, will I not obey, but will rather die than show myself false and ungrateful. Our God did not begin to be in time: <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">428</font></a>
  He alone is without beginning, and He Himself is the beginning of all things. God is a Spirit, <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">429</font></a>
  not pervading matter, but the Maker of material spirits, <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">430</font></a>
  and of the forms that are in matter; He is invisible, impalpable, being Himself the Father of both sensible and invisible things. Him we know from His creation, and apprehend His invisible power by His works. <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_430"><font size="1">431</font></a>
  I refuse to adore that workmanship which He has made for our sakes. The sun and moon were made for us: how, then, can I adore my own servants? How can I speak of stocks and stones as gods? For the Spirit that pervades matter <a name="fr_431"></a><a href="#fn_431"><font size="1">432</font></a>
  is inferior to the more divine spirit; and this, even when assimilated to the soul, is not to be honoured equally with the perfect God. Nor even ought the ineffable God to be presented with gifts; for He who is in want of nothing is not to be misrepresented by us as though He were indigent. But I will set forth our views more distinctly.</p>  <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.iv-Page_67"></a>

Terence breathes it from his wounded soul in slavery; and his immortal line, “Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto” (<i>Hæuntontimor.</i>, act. i. sc. 1, verse 25), looks as if it had been written in the second century of illumination.]</p>
