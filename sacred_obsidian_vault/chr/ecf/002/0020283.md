 <p> <a name="vi.iii.iii.v"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iii.iii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.—Behaviour in the Baths.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii.v-p1"></a>And of what sort are their baths? Houses skilfully constructed, compact, portable, transparent, covered with fine linen. And gold-plated chairs, and silver ones, too, and ten thousand vessels of gold and silver, some for drinking, some for eating, some for bathing, are carried about with them. Besides these, there are even braziers of coals; for they have arrived at such a pitch of self-indulgence, that they sup and get drunk while bathing. And articles of silver with which they make a show, they ostentatiously set out in the baths, and thus display perchance their wealth out of excessive pride, but chiefly the capricious ignorance, through which they brand effeminate men, who have been vanquished by women; proving at least that they themselves cannot meet and cannot sweat without a multitude of vessels, although poor women who have no display equally enjoy their baths. The dirt of wealth, then, has an abundant covering of censure. With this, as with a bait, they hook the miserable creatures that gape at the glitter of gold. For dazzling thus those fond of display, they artfully try to win the admiration of their lovers, who after a little insult them naked. They will scarce strip before their own husbands affecting a plausible pretence of modesty; but any others who wish, may see them at home shut up naked in their baths. For there they are not ashamed to strip before spectators, as if exposing their persons for sale. But Hesiod advises</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.iii.v-p1.1"></a> “Not to wash the skin in the womens bath.” <a name="fr_1626"></a><a href="#fn_1626"><font size="1">1627</font></a>
 <br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.iii.v-p3"></a>The baths are opened promiscuously to men and women; and there they strip for licentious indulgence (for from looking, men get to loving), as if their modesty had been washed away in the bath. <a name="fr_1627"></a><a href="#fn_1627"><font size="1">1628</font></a>
  Those who have not become utterly destitute of modesty shut out strangers; but bathe with their own servants, and strip naked before their slaves, and are rubbed by them; giving to the crouching menial liberty to lust, by permitting fearless handling. For those who are introduced before their naked mistresses while in the bath, study to strip themselves in order to audacity in lust, casting off fear in consequence of the wicked custom. The ancient athletes, <a name="fr_1628"></a><a href="#fn_1628"><font size="1">1629</font></a>
  ashamed to exhibit a man naked, preserved their modesty by going through the contest in drawers; but these women, divesting themselves of their modesty along with their tunic, wish to appear beautiful, but contrary to their wish are simply proved to be wicked. <a name="fr_1629"></a><a href="#fn_1629"><font size="1">1630</font></a>
  For through the body itself the wantonness of lust shines clearly; as in the case of dropsical people, the water covered by the skin. Disease in both is known from the look. Men, therefore, affording to women a noble example of truth, ought to be ashamed at their stripping before them, and guard against these dangerous sights; “for he who has looked curiously,” it is said, “hath sinned already.” <a name="fr_1630"></a><a href="#fn_1630"><font size="1">1631</font></a>
  At home, therefore, they ought to regard with modesty parents and domestics; in the ways, those they meet; in the baths, women; in solitude, themselves; and everywhere the Word, who is everywhere, “and without Him was not anything.” <a name="fr_1631"></a><a href="#fn_1631"><font size="1">1632</font></a>
  For so only shall one remain without falling, if he regard God as ever present with him.</p>
