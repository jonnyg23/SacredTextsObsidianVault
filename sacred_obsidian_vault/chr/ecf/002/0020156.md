 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii.xix-p1"></a>And neither does he make out that there was a second flood: on the contrary, he said that never again would there be a flood of water on the world; as neither indeed has there been, nor ever shall be. And he says that eight human beings were preserved in the ark, in that which had been prepared by Gods direction, not by Deucalion, but by Noah; which Hebrew word means in English <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">677</font></a>
  “rest,” as we have elsewhere shown that Noah, when he announced to the men then alive that there was a flood coming, prophesied to them, saying, Come thither, God calls you to repentance. On this account he was fitly called Deucalion. <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">678</font></a>
  And this Noah had three sons (as we mentioned in the second book), whose names  <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iii.xix-Page_117"></a>were Shem, and Ham, and Japhet; and these had three wives, one wife each; each man and his wife. This man some have surnamed Eunuchus. All the eight persons, therefore, who were found in the ark were preserved. And Moses showed that the flood lasted forty days and forty nights, torrents pouring from heaven, and from the fountains of the deep breaking up, so that the water overtopped every high hill 15 cubits. And thus the race of all the men that then were was destroyed, and those only who were protected in the ark were saved; and these, we have already said, were eight. And of the ark, the remains are to this day to be seen in the Arabian mountains. This, then, is in sum the history of the deluge.</p>
