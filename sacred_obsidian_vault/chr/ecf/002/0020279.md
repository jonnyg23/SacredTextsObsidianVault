 <p> <a name="vi.iii.iii.i"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p0.1"></a>Chapter I.—On the True Beauty.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p1.1"></a>It</span> is then, as appears, the greatest of all lessons to know ones self. For if one knows himself, he will know God; and knowing God, he will be made like God, not by wearing gold or long robes, but by well-doing, and by requiring as few things as possible. <a name="fr_1573"></a><a href="#fn_1573"><font size="1">1574</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p3"></a>Now, God alone is in need of nothing, and rejoices most when He sees us bright with the ornament of intelligence; and then, too, rejoices in him who is arrayed in chastity, the sacred stole of the body. Since then the soul consists of three divisions; <a name="fr_1574"></a><a href="#fn_1574"><font size="1">1575</font></a>
  the intellect, which is called the reasoning faculty, is the inner man, which is the ruler of this man that is seen. And that one, in another respect, God guides. But the irascible part, being brutal, dwells near to insanity. And appetite, which is the third department, is many-shaped above Proteus, the varying sea-god, who changed himself now into one shape, now into another; and it allures to adulteries, to licentiousness, to seductions.</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p4.4"></a> “At first he was a lion with  ample beard.” <a name="fr_1575"></a><a href="#fn_1575"><font size="1">1576</font></a>
 <br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p6"></a>While he yet retained the ornament, the hair of the chin showed him to be a man.</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p6.1"></a> “But after that a serpent, a pard, or a big sow.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p7"></a>Love of ornament has degenerated to wantonness. A man no longer appears like a strong wild beast,</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p7.1"></a> “But he became moist water, and a tree of lofty branches.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p8"></a>Passions break out, pleasures overflow; beauty fades, and falls quicker than the leaf on the ground, when the amorous storms of lust blow on it before the coming of autumn, and is withered by destruction.  For lust becomes and fabricates all things, and wishes to cheat, so as to conceal the man. But that man with whom the Word dwells does not alter himself, does not get himself up: he has the form which is of the Word; he is made like to God; he is beautiful; he does not ornament himself: his is beauty, the true beauty, for it is God; and that man becomes God, since God so wills. Heraclitus, then, rightly said, “Men are gods, and gods are men.” For the Word Himself is the manifest mystery: God in man, and man God. And the Mediator executes the Fathers will; for the Mediator is the Word, who is common to both—the Son of God, the Saviour of men; His Servant, our Teacher. And the flesh being a slave, as Paul testifies, how can one with any reason adorn the handmaid like a pimp? For that which is of flesh has the form of a servant. Paul says, speaking of the Lord, “Because He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant,” <a name="fr_1576"></a><a href="#fn_1576"><font size="1">1577</font></a>
  calling the outward man servant, previous to the Lord becoming a servant and wearing flesh. But the compassionate God Himself set the flesh free, and releasing it from destruction, and from bitter and deadly bondage, endowed it with incorruptibility, arraying the flesh in this, the holy embellishment of eternity—immortality.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p10"></a>There is, too, another beauty of men—love. “And love,” according to the apostle, “suffers long, and is kind; envieth not; vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.” <a name="fr_1577"></a><a href="#fn_1577"><font size="1">1578</font></a>
  For the decking of ones self out—carrying, as it does, the look of superfluity and uselessness—is vaunting ones self. Wherefore he adds, “doth not behave itself unseemly:” for a figure which is not ones own, and is against nature, is unseemly; but what is artificial is not ones own, as is clearly explained: “seeketh not,” it is said, “what is not her own.” For truth calls that its own which belongs to it; but the love of finery seeks what is not its own, being apart from God, and the Word, from love.</p>  <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.iii.i-Page_272"></a>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.iii.i-p12"></a>And that the Lord Himself was uncomely in aspect, the Spirit testifies by Esaias: “And we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness but His form was mean, inferior to men.” <a name="fr_1578"></a><a href="#fn_1578"><font size="1">1579</font></a>
  Yet who was more admirable than the Lord? But it was not the beauty of the flesh visible to the eye, but the true beauty of both soul and body, which He exhibited, which in the former is beneficence; in the latter—that is, the flesh—immortality.</p>
