 <p> <a name="iii.ii.i"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.i-p0.1"></a>Chapter I.—The Greeks Claim, Without Reason, the Invention of the Arts.</h5>  
 <p><a name="iii.ii.i-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iii.ii.i-p1.1"></a>Be</span> not, O Greeks, so very hostilely disposed towards the Barbarians, nor look with ill will on their opinions. For which of your institutions has not been derived from the Barbarians? The most eminent of the Telmessians invented the art of divining by dreams; the Carians, that of prognosticating by the stars; the Phrygians and the most ancient Isaurians, augury by the flight of birds; the Cyprians, the art of inspecting victims. To the Babylonians you owe astronomy; to the Persians, magic; to the Egyptians, geometry; to the Phœnicians, instruction by alphabetic writing. Cease, then, to miscall these imitations inventions of your own. Orpheus, again, taught you poetry and song; from him, too, you learned the mysteries. The Tuscans taught you the plastic art; from the annals of the Egyptians you learned to write history; you acquired the art of playing the flute from Marsyas and Olympus,—these two rustic Phrygians constructed the harmony of the shepherds pipe. The Tyrrhenians invented the trumpet; the Cyclopes, the smiths art; and a woman who was formerly a queen of the Persians, as Hellanicus tells us, the method of joining together epistolary tablets: <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">422</font></a>
  her name was Atossa. Wherefore lay aside this conceit, and be not ever boasting of your elegance of diction; for, while you applaud yourselves, your own people will of course side with you. But it becomes a man of sense to wait for the testimony of others, and it becomes men to be of one accord also in the pronunciation of their language. But, as matters stand, to you alone it has happened not to speak alike even in common intercourse; for the way of speaking among the Dorians is not the same as that of the inhabitants of Attica, nor do the Æolians speak like the Ionians. And, since such a discrepancy exists where it ought not to be, I am at a loss whom to call a Greek. And, what is strangest of all, you hold in honour expressions not of native growth, and by the intermixture of barbaric words have made your language a medley. On this account we have renounced your wisdom, though I was once a great proficient in it; for, as the comic poet <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">423</font></a>
  says,—</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.i-p3.1"></a> These are gleaners grapes and small talk,—<br>  Twittering places of swallows, corrupters of art.<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="iii.ii.i-p4"></a>Yet those who eagerly pursue it shout lustily, and croak like so many ravens. You have, too, contrived the art of rhetoric to serve injustice and slander, selling the free power of your speech for hire, and often representing the same thing at one time as right, at another time as not good. The poetic art, again, you employ to describe battles, and the amours of the gods, and the corruption of the soul.</p>
