 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxvi-p1"></a>And God showed great kindness to man in this, that He did not suffer him to remain in sin for ever; but, as it were, by a kind of banishment, cast him out of Paradise, in order that, having by punishment expiated, within an appointed time, the sin, and having been disciplined, he should afterwards be restored. Wherefore also, when man had been formed in this world, it is mystically written in Genesis, as if he had been twice placed in Paradise; so that the one was fulfilled when he was placed there, and the second will be fulfilled after the resurrection and judgment. For just as a vessel, when on being fashioned it has some flaw, is remoulded or remade, that it may become new and entire; so also it happens to man by death. For somehow  <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii.xxvi-Page_105"></a>or other he is broken up, that he may rise in the resurrection whole; I mean spotless, and righteous, and immortal. And as to Gods calling, and saying, Where art thou, Adam? God did this, not as if ignorant of this; but, being long-suffering, He gave him an opportunity of repentance and confession.</p>
