 <p> <a name="vi.iv.vi.x"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p0.1"></a>Chapter X.—The Gnostic Avails Himself of the Help of All Human Knowledge.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p1"></a>For to him knowledge (<i>gnosis</i>) is the principal thing.  Consequently, therefore, he applies to the subjects that are a training for knowledge, taking from each branch of study its contribution to the truth. Prosecuting, then, the proportion of harmonies in music; and in arithmetic noting the increasing and decreasing of numbers, and their relations to one another, and how the most of things fall under some proportion of numbers; studying geometry, which is abstract essence, he perceives a continuous distance, and an immutable essence which is different from these bodies. And by astronomy, again, raised from the earth in his mind, he is elevated along with heaven, and will revolve with its revolution; studying ever divine things, and their harmony with each other; from which Abraham starting, ascended to the knowledge of Him who created them. Further, the Gnostic will avail himself of dialectics, fixing on the distinction of genera into species, and will master <a name="fr_3325"></a><a href="#fn_3325"><font size="1">3326</font></a>
  the distinction of existences, till he come to what are primary and simple.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p3"></a>But the multitude are frightened at the Hellenic philosophy, as children are at masks, being afraid lest it lead them astray. But if the faith (for I cannot call it knowledge) which they possess be such as to be dissolved by plausible speech, let it be by all means dissolved, <a name="fr_3326"></a><a href="#fn_3326"><font size="1">3327</font></a>
  and let them confess that they will not retain the truth. For truth is immoveable; but false opinion dissolves. We choose, for instance, one purple by comparison with another purple. So that, if one confesses that he has not a heart that has been made right, he has not the table of the money-changers or the test of words. <a name="fr_3327"></a><a href="#fn_3327"><font size="1">3328</font></a>
  And how can he be any longer a money-changer, who is not able to prove and distinguish spurious coin, even offhand?</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p6"></a>Now David cried, “The righteous shall not be shaken for ever;” <a name="fr_3328"></a><a href="#fn_3328"><font size="1">3329</font></a>
  neither, consequently, by deceptive speech nor by erring pleasure.  <a name="page_499"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 499</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.vi.x-Page_499"></a>Whence he shall never be shaken from his own heritage. “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings;” <a name="fr_3329"></a><a href="#fn_3329"><font size="1">3330</font></a>
  consequently neither of unfounded calumny, nor of the false opinion around him. No more will he dread cunning words, who is capable of distinguishing them, or of answering rightly to questions asked. Such a bulwark are dialectics, that truth cannot be trampled under foot by the Sophists. “For it behoves those who praise in the holy name of the Lord,” according to the prophet, “to rejoice in heart, seeking the Lord. Seek then Him, and be strong. Seek His face continually in every way.” <a name="fr_3330"></a><a href="#fn_3330"><font size="1">3331</font></a>
  “For, having spoken at sundry times and in divers manners,” <a name="fr_3331"></a><a href="#fn_3331"><font size="1">3332</font></a>
  it is not in one way only that He is known.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p11"></a>It is, then, not by availing himself of these as virtues that our Gnostic will be deeply learned. But by using them as helps in distinguishing what is common and what is peculiar, he will admit the truth. For the cause of all error and false opinion, is inability to distinguish in what respect things are common, and in what respects they differ. For unless, in things that are distinct, one closely watch speech, he will inadvertently confound what is common and what is peculiar. And where this takes place, he must of necessity fall into pathless tracts and error.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p12"></a>The distinction of names and things also in the Scriptures themselves produces great light in mens souls. For it is necessary to understand expressions which signify several things, and several expressions when they signify one thing. The result of which is accurate answering. But it is necessary to avoid the great futility which occupies itself in irrelevant matters; since the Gnostic avails himself of branches of learning as auxiliary preparatory exercises, in order to the accurate communication of the truth, as far as attainable and with as little distraction as possible, and for defence against reasonings that plot for the extinction of the truth.  He will not then be deficient in what contributes to proficiency in the curriculum of studies and the Hellenic philosophy; but not principally, but necessarily, secondarily, and on account of circumstances. For what those labouring in heresies use wickedly, the Gnostic will use rightly.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p13"></a>Therefore the truth that appears in the Hellenic philosophy, being partial, the real truth, like the sun glancing on the colours both white and black, shows what like each of them is. So also it exposes all sophistical plausibility. Rightly, then, was it proclaimed also by the Greeks:—“Truth the queen is the beginning of great virtue.” <a name="fr_3332"></a><a href="#fn_3332"><font size="1">3333</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p2"></a> Our choice lies between the reading of the text, <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.1"></a>προσίσεται</span>; that of Hervetus, <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.2"></a>προσοίσεται</span>; the conjecture of Sylburgius, <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.3"></a>προσείσεται</span>, or <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.4"></a>προσήσεται</span>, used a little after in the phrase <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.5"></a>προσήσεται τὴν ἀλήθειαν</span>.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p4"></a> There is some difficulty in the sentence as it stands.
