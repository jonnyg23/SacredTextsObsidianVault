 <p> <a name="iv.ii.ii.xxx"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXX.—Cains Family and Their Inventions.</h5>  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p1"></a>Cain also himself had a son, whose name was Enoch; and he built a city, which he called by the name of his son, Enoch. From that time was there made a beginning of the building of cities, and this before the flood; not as Homer falsely says: <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">610</font></a>
 —</p>  <blockquote><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p2.1"></a> “Not yet had men a city built.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p3"></a>And to Enoch was born a son, by name Gaidad; who begat a son called Meel; and Meel begat Mathusala; and Mathusala, Lamech. And Lamech took unto him two wives, whose names were Adah and Zillah. At that time there was made a beginning of polygamy, and also of music.  For Lamech had three sons: Jabal, Jubal, Tubal. And Jabal became a keeper of cattle, and dwelt in tents; but Jubal is he who made known the psaltery and the harp; and Tubal became a smith, a forger in brass and iron. So far the seed of Cain is registered; and for the rest, the seed of his line has sunk into oblivion, on account of his fratricide of his brother. And, in place of Abel, God granted to Eve to conceive and bear a son, who was called Seth; from whom the remainder of the human race proceeds until now. And to those who desire to be informed regarding all generations, it is easy to give explanations by means of the holy Scriptures. For, as we have already mentioned, this subject, the order of the genealogy of man, has been partly handled by us in another discourse, in the first book of <i>The History.</i> <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">611</font></a>
  And all these things the Holy Spirit teaches us, who speaks through Moses and the rest of the prophets, so that the writings which belong to us godly people are more ancient, yea, and are shown to be more truthful, than all writers and poets. But also, concerning music, some have fabled that Apollo was the inventor, and others say that Orpheus discovered the art of music from the sweet voices of the birds. Their story is shown to be empty and vain, for these inventors lived many years after the flood. And what relates to Noah, who is called by some Deucalion, has been explained by us in the book before mentioned, and which, if you wish it, you are at liberty to read.</p>
