 <p> <a name="v.ii.xvii"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="v.ii.xvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XVII.—The Names of the Gods and Their Images are But of Recent Date.</h5>  
 <p><a name="v.ii.xvii-p1"></a>An apologist must adduce more precise arguments than I have yet given, both concering the names of the gods, to show that they are of recent origin, and concerning their images, to show that they are, so to say, but of yesterday. You yourselves, however, are thoroughly acquainted with these matters, since you are versed in all departments of knowledge, and are beyond all other men familiar with the ancients. I assert, then, that it was Orpheus, and Homer, and Hesiod who <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">746</font></a>
  gave both genealogies and names to those whom they call gods. Such, too, is the testimony of Herodotus. <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">747</font></a>
  “My opinion,” he says, “is that Hesiod and Homer preceded me by four hundred years, and no more; and it was they who framed a theogony for the Greeks, and gave the gods their names, and assigned them their several honours and functions, and described their forms.” Representations of the gods, again, were not in use at all, so long as statuary, and painting, and sculpture were unknown; nor did they become common until Saurias the Samian, and Crato the Sicyonian, and Cleanthes the Corinthian, and the Corinthian damsel <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">748</font></a>
  appeared, when drawing in outline was invented by Saurias, who sketched a horse in the sun, and painting by Crato, who painted in oil on a whitened tablet the outlines of a man and woman; and the art of making figures in relief (<span class="Greek"><a name="v.ii.xvii-p4.1"></a>κοροπλαθική</span>) was invented by the damsel, <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_748"><font size="1">749</font></a>
  who, being in love with a person, traced his shadow on a wall as he lay asleep, and her father, being delighted with the exactness of the resemblance (he was a potter), carved out the sketch and filled it up with clay: this figure is still preserved at Corinth. After these, Dædalus and Theodorus the Milesian further invented sculpture and statuary. You perceive, then, that the time since representations of form and the making of images began is so short, that we can name the artist of each particular god. The image of Artemis at Ephesus, for example, and that of Athenâ (or rather of Athelâ, for so is she named by those who speak more in the style of the mysteries; for thus was the ancient image made of the olive-tree called), and the sitting figure of the same goddess, were made by Endœus, a pupil of Dædalus; the Pythian god was the work of Theodorus and Telecles; and the Delian  <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a> <a name="v.ii.xvii-Page_137"></a>god and Artemis are due to the art of Tectæus and Angelio; Hera in Samos and in Argos came from the hands of Smilis, and the other statues <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_749"><font size="1">750</font></a>
  were by Phidias; Aphrodité the courtezan in Cnidus is the production of Praxiteles; Asclepius in Epidaurus is the work of Phidias. In a word, of not one of these statues can it be said that it was not made by man. If, then, these are gods, why did they not exist from the beginning? Why, in sooth, are they younger than those who made them? Why, in sooth, in order to their coming into existence, did they need the aid of men and art? They are nothing but earth, and stones, and matter, and curious art. <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">751</font></a>
