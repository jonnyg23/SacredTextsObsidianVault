 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii.xxii-p1"></a>Then concerning the building of the temple in Judæa, which Solomon the king built 566 years after the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, there is  <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iii.xxii-Page_118"></a>among the Tyrians a record how the temple was built; and in their archives writings have been preserved, in which the temple is proved to have existed 143 <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">682</font></a>
  years 8 months before the Tyrians founded Carthage (and this record was made by Hiram <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">683</font></a>
  (that is the name of the king of the Tyrians), the son of Abimalus, on account of the hereditary friendship which existed between Hiram and Solomon, and at the same time on account of the surpassing wisdom possessed by Solomon. For they continually engaged with each other in discussing difficult problems. And proof of this exists in their correspondence, which to this day is preserved among the Tyrians, and the writings that passed between them); as Menander the Ephesian, while narrating the history of the Tyrian kingdom, records, speaking thus: “For when Abimalus the king of the Tyrians died, his son Hiram succeeded to the kingdom. He lived 53 years. And Bazorus succeeded him, who lived 43, and reigned 17 years. And after him followed Methuastartus, who lived 54 years, and reigned 12. And after him succeeded his brother Atharymus, who lived 58 years, and reigned 9. He was slain by his brother of the name of Helles, who lived 50 years, and reigned 8 months. He was killed by Juthobalus, priest of Astarte, who lived 40 years, and reigned 12. He was succeeded by his son Bazorus, who lived 45 years, and reigned 7.  And to him his son Metten succeeded, who lived 32 years, and reigned 29. Pygmalion, son of Pygmalius succeeded him, who lived 56 years, and reigned 7. <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">684</font></a>
  And in the 7th year of his reign, his sister, fleeing to Libya, built the city which to this day is called Carthage.” The whole period, therefore, from the reign of Hiram to the founding of Carthage, amounts to 155 years and 8 months. And in the 12th year of the reign of Hiram the temple in Jerusalem was built. So that the entire time from the building of the temple to the founding of Carthage was 143 years and 8 months.</p>
