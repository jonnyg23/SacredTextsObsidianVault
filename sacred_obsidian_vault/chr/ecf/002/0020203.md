 <p><a name="v.ii.xxxiii-p1"></a>Therefore, having the hope of eternal life, we despise the things of this life, even to the pleasures of the soul, each of us reckoning her his wife whom he has married according to the laws laid down by us, and that only for the purpose of having children. For as the husbandman throwing the seed into the ground awaits the harvest, not sowing more upon it, so to us the procreation of children is the measure of our indulgence in appetite. Nay, you would find many among us, both men and women, growing old unmarried, in hope of living in closer communion with God. <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">825</font></a>
  But if the remaining in virginity and in the state of an eunuch brings nearer to God, while the indulgence of carnal thought and desire leads away from Him, in those cases in which we shun the thoughts, much more do we reject the deeds. For we bestow our attention, not on the study of words, but on the exhibition and teaching of actions,—that a person should either remain as he was born, or be content with one marriage; for a second marriage is only a specious adultery. <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">826</font></a>
  “For whosoever puts away his wife,” says He, “and  <a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a> <a name="v.ii.xxxiii-Page_147"></a>marries another, commits adultery;” <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">827</font></a>
  not permitting a man to send her away whose virginity he has brought to an end, nor to marry again. For he who deprives himself of his first wife, even though she be dead, is a cloaked adulterer, <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">828</font></a>
  resisting the hand of God, because in the beginning God made one man and one woman, and dissolving the strictest union of flesh with flesh, formed for the intercourse of the race.</p>
