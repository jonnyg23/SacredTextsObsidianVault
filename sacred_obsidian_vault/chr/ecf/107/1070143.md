 <p> <a name="iv.xv"></a>  
 </p><p class="c39"><a name="iv.xv-p1"></a> <i>De Sermone Domini in Monte, lib. i. 22, § 73.</i></p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.xv-p2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016">1 John 5.16</a><a name="iv.xv-p2.1"></a><i></i><i></i>. <i>Si quis scit peccare fratrem suum peccatum non ad mortem, postulabit, et dabit illi Dominus vitam qui peccat non ad mortem; est autem peccatum ad mortem; non pro illo dico ut roget.</i></p>  
 <p><a name="iv.xv-p3"></a>But what presses harder upon the present question [in the Lords command of praying for enemies and persecutors] is that saying of the apostle John, “If any man know that his brother sinneth a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and the Lord will give life to that man who sinneth not unto death: but there is a sin unto death: not for that do I say that he should ask.” For it manifestly shows that there are some “brethren” whom we are not commanded to pray for, whereas the Lord bids us pray even for our persecutors. Nor can this question be solved except we acknowledge, that there are some sins in brethren that are worse than the sin of enemies in persecuting. That “brethren” mean Christians, may be proved by many texts of Holy Writ; the plainest, however, is that of the apostle which he puts thus: “For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.”  <a name="fr_2549"></a><a href="#fn_2549"><font size="1">2550</font></a>
  For he has not added <i>our</i>; but thought it plain enough, when by the term <i>brother</i> he spake of the Christian that should have an unbelieving wife. And accordingly he says just afterwards, “But if the unbelieving depart, let her depart: but a brother or sister is not put under servitude in a matter of this sort.” The “sin,” therefore, of a brother, “unto death,” I suppose to be when, after the acknowledging of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, one fights against the brotherhood, and is set on by the fire-brands of hatred <a name="fr_2550"></a><a href="#fn_2550"><font size="1">2551</font></a>
  against the very grace through which he was reconciled to God. <a name="fr_2551"></a><a href="#fn_2551"><font size="1">2552</font></a>
  But “a sin not unto death” is when a person, not having alienated his love from his brother, yet through some infirmity of mind may have failed to exhibit the due offices of brotherhood. Wherefore, on the one hand, the Lord on the cross said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,” <a name="fr_2552"></a><a href="#fn_2552"><font size="1">2553</font></a>
  since they had not yet, by being made partakers of the grace of the Holy Spirit, entered into the fellowship of holy brotherhood; and blessed Stephen in the Acts of the Apostles prays for them who are stoning him; <a name="fr_2553"></a><a href="#fn_2553"><font size="1">2554</font></a>
  because they had not yet believed Christ, and were not fighting against that grace of communion. On the other hand, the apostle Paul does not pray for Alexander, and the reason I suppose, is, that this man was a brother, and had sinned “unto death,” <i>i.e.</i> by opposing the brotherhood in a spirit of hatred. <a name="fr_2554"></a><a href="#fn_2554"><font size="1">2555</font></a>
  Whereas for such as had not broken off the bonds of love, but had given way through fear, he prays that they may be forgiven. For so he says: “Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.” <a name="fr_2555"></a><a href="#fn_2555"><font size="1">2556</font></a>
  Then he subjoins for whom he prays, saying, “At my first answer no man   <a name="page_528"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 528</font></a> <a name="iv.xv-Page_528"></a>stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.” This difference of sins it is that distinguishes Judas with his treason from Peter with his denial. Not that to him who repenteth there is to be no forgiveness: lest we go against that sentence of the Lord, in which He commands always to forgive the brother who asks his brothers forgiveness: <a name="fr_2556"></a><a href="#fn_2556"><font size="1">2557</font></a>
  but that the mischief of that sin is, that the man cannot submit to the humiliation of begging for pardon, even when he is forced by his evil conscience both to acknowledge and to publish his sin. For when Judas had said, “I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood,” <a name="fr_2557"></a><a href="#fn_2557"><font size="1">2558</font></a>
  he went and hanged himself in desperation, rather than pray for forgiveness in humiliation. Wherefore it makes a great difference, what sort of repentance God forgives. For many are much quicker than others to confess that they have sinned, and are angry with themselves in such sort that they vehemently wish they had not sinned, while yet they cannot lay down their pride, and submit to have the heart humbled and broken so as to implore pardon: a state of mind which one may well believe to be, for the greatness of their sin, a part of their already begun damnation.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.xv-p13"></a>And this, perhaps, it is “to sin against the Holy Ghost:” <a name="fr_2558"></a><a href="#fn_2558"><font size="1">2559</font></a>
  <i> i.e.</i> through malice and envy to fight against brotherly charity after receiving the grace of the Holy Spirit: that sin which the Lord saith hath no forgiveness, either here or in the world to come. . . . For the Lord in saying to the Pharisees, “Whosoever shall speak an evil word against the Son of Man,” <a name="fr_2559"></a><a href="#fn_2559"><font size="1">2560</font></a>
  &amp;c., may have meant to warn them to come to the grace of God, and having received it, not to sin as they have now sinned. For now they have spoken an evil word against the Son of Man, and it may be forgiven them, if they be converted and believe and receive the Holy Spirit: which when they have received, if they will then have ill-will against the brotherhood and oppose the grace they have received, there is no forgiveness for them, either in this world or in the world to come.</p>
