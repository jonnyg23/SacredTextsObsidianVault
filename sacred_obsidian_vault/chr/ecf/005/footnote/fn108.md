Now, the Latin, repeating (in verse 8) the formula (hi tres unum sunt) which belongs to the dubious <i>protasis</i>, is so far evidence that such a verse existed in the old Greek. It is important that the Latin is not conformed to the received formula of the <i>apodosis</i>, " the three <i>agree</i> in one."] </p>
