    <h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> Introductory Notice<sup><a href="footnote/fn105.htm">1</a></sup> To an Anonymous Treatise Against the Heretic Novatian.</h2>  
 <p>--------</p>  
 <p>The writer of the following treatise was undoubtedly a contemporary of Cyprian, and wrote in the early part of the reign of Valerian (254-256), during an interval of peace to the Church. This much may be collected from the fact that he names one, and only one, persecution after that of Decius-namely, that of Gallus and Volusianus-and speaks of those who had lapsed under the former, as having been stedfast and victorious in the latter.<sup><a href="footnote/fn105.htm#P10590_3335412">2</a></sup> He is generally believed to have been an Africa, and Tillemont is only withheld from attributing the work to Cyprian himself by what he judges to be a difference of style. But although from the exordium it may be concluded that the writer was a bishop, yet, from his manifest uncertainty as to the fitting way to treat those who had lapsed, it is evident that Cyprian cannot have been the author; for that prelate, when the persecution of Gallus and Volusianus was just threatening, had already decided upon receiving to communion the penitents who had yielded to temptation under Decius.<sup><a href="footnote/fn105.htm#P10591_3336035">3</a></sup> </p>  
 <p>Ceillier<sup><a href="footnote/fn105.htm#P10593_3336079">4</a></sup> says that this treatise was written about the year 255, while Novatian was still alive,<sup><a href="footnote/fn105.htm#P10594_3336235">5</a></sup> and when the schism of Felicissimus was all but extinct.</p>  
 <p>Erasmus first published it among the known works of Cyprian in the year 1520.</p>  
 <p>Note.</p>  
 <p>The American editor subjoins as follows: Cyprian, and Cornelius afterward, had decided, with their councils, that the lapsed should be classed, and dealt with accordingly, as (1) <i>Libellatici</i>, those who had compounded with the heathen, and <i>bought off</i> from offering sacrifice; and (2) <i>Sacrificati</i>, those who had actually offered sacrifice to idols. Different degrees of discipline were awarded, but all were admitted to pardon finally. </p>
