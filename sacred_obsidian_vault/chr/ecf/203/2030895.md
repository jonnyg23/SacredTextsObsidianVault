 </p><p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xlvii-p1"></a>  46. That the righteous shall ever abide with Christ our Lord we have proved above, where we have shewn that the Apostle says, “Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” <a name="fr_3427"></a><a href="#fn_3427"><font size="1">3428</font></a>
  And do not marvel that the flesh of the saints is to be changed into such a glorious condition at the resurrection as to be caught up to meet God, suspended in the clouds and borne in the air, since the same Apostle, setting forth the great things which God bestows on them that love Him, says, “Who shall change our vile body that it may be made like unto His glorious body.” <a name="fr_3428"></a><a href="#fn_3428"><font size="1">3429</font></a>
  It is nowise absurd then, if the bodies of the saints are said to be raised up into the air, seeing that they are said to be renewed after the image of Christs body, which is seated at Gods right hand. But this also the holy Apostle adds, speaking either of himself or of others of his own place or merit, “He will raise us up together with Christ and make us sit together in the heavenly places.” <a name="fr_3429"></a><a href="#fn_3429"><font size="1">3430</font></a>
  Whence, since Gods saints have these promises and an infinite number like them respecting the resurrection of the righteous, it will now not be difficult to believe those also which the Prophets have foretold, namely, that “the righteous shall shine as the sun and as the brightness of the firmament in the kingdom of God.” <a name="fr_3430"></a><a href="#fn_3430"><font size="1">3431</font></a>
  For who will think it difficult that they should have the brightness of the sun, and be adorned with the splendour of the stars and of this firmament, for whom the life and conversation of Gods angels are being prepared in heaven, or who are represented as being hereafter to be conformed to the glory of Christs body? In reference to which glory, promised by the Saviours mouth, the holy Apostle says, “It is sown as an animal body; it will rise a spiritual body.” <a name="fr_3431"></a><a href="#fn_3431"><font size="1">3432</font></a>
  For if it is true, as it certainly is true, that God will vouchsafe to associate every one of the righteous and of the saints in companionship with the angels, it is certain that He will change their bodies also into the glory of a spiritual body.</p>
