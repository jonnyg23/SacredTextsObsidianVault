  presbyter of the Alexandrian church, and a pupil of the Pantaenus mentioned above, led the theological school at Alexandria after the death of his master and was teacher of the Catechetes. He is the author of notable volumes, full of eloquence and learning, both in sacred Scripture and in secular literature; among these are the <i>Stromata,</i> eight books, <i>Hypotyposes</i> eight books, <i>Against the nations</i> one book, <i>On pedagogy</i> <a name="fr_2444"></a><a href="#fn_2444"><font size="1">2445</font></a>
  three books, <i>On the Passover, Disquisition on fasting</i> and another book entitled, <i>What rich man is saved</i>? one book <i>On Calumny, On ecclesiastical canons and against those who follow the error of the Jews,</i> one book which he addressed to Alexander bishop of Jerusalem. He also mentions in his volumes of <i>Stromata</i> the work of Tatian <i>Against the nations</i> which we mentioned above and a <i>Chronography</i> of one Cassianus, a work which I have not been able to find. He also mentioned certain Jewish writers against the nations, one Aristobulus and Demetrius and Eupolemus who after the example of Josephus asserted the primacy of Moses and the Jewish people. There is a letter of Alexander the bishop of Jerusalem who afterwards ruled the church with Narcissus, on the ordination of Asclepiades the confessor, addressed to the Antiochians congratulating them, at the end of which he says “these writings honoured <a name="fr_2445"></a><a href="#fn_2445"><font size="1">2446</font></a>
  brethren I have sent to you by the blessed presbyter Clement, a man illustrious and approved, whom you also know and with whom now you will become better acquainted a man who, when he had come hither by the special providence of God, strengthened and enlarged the church of God.” Origen is known to have been his disciple. He flourished moreover during the reigns of Severus and his son Antoninus.</p>
