 </p><p class="c24"><a name="vi.xi.ii.vii-p1"></a>  6. Behold the discovery of this man of the new learning! a thing which escaped the notice of the Apostles when they delivered the faith to the Church; a thing which none of the saints knew till it was revealed to this man by the spirit of the flesh. He indeed cannot expound it without bringing in an indecency. Nevertheless, I will set it forth in his hearing both more worthily and more truly. Christ is the first fruits of those that sleep; <a name="fr_2827"></a><a href="#fn_2827"><font size="1">2828</font></a>
  he is also called <a name="fr_2828"></a><a href="#fn_2828"><font size="1">2829</font></a>
  the first begotten from the dead; as also the Apostle says, <a name="fr_2829"></a><a href="#fn_2829"><font size="1">2830</font></a>
  “Christ is the beginning, afterward they that are Christs.” Since then we have Christ as the undoubted first fruits of our resurrection, how can any question arise about the rest of us? It must be evident that, whatever the members, the hair, the flesh, the bones, were in which Christ rose, in the same shall we also rise. For this purpose he offered himself to the disciples to touch after his resurrection, so that no hesitation as to his resurrection should remain. Since then Christ has given his own resurrection as a typical instance, one that is quite evident, and (as I may say) capable of being felt and handled by the hand, who can be so mad as to think that he himself will rise otherwise than as He rose who opened the door of the resurrection? This also confirms the truth of this confession of ours that, while it is the actual natural flesh and no other which will rise, yet it will rise purged from its faults and having laid aside its corruption; so that the saying of the Apostle is true: <a name="fr_2830"></a><a href="#fn_2830"><font size="1">2831</font></a>
  “It is sown in corruption, it will be raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it will be raised in glory; it is sown a natural <a name="fr_2831"></a><a href="#fn_2831"><font size="1">2832</font></a>
  body, it will be raised a spiritual body.” Inasmuch then as it is a spiritual body, and glorious, and incorruptible, it will be furnished and adorned with its own proper members, not with members taken from elsewhere, according to that glorious image of which Christ is set forth as the perpetual type, as it is said by the Apostle: <a name="fr_2832"></a><a href="#fn_2832"><font size="1">2833</font></a>
  “Who shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory.”</p>
