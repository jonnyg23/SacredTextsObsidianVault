  of Alexandria, becoming blind while very young, and therefore ignorant of the rudiments of learning, displayed such a miracle of intelligence as to learn perfectly dialectics and even geometry, sciences which especially require sight. He wrote many admirable works: <i>Commentaries on all the Psalms, Commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew and John, On the doctrines,</i> also two books <i>Against the Arians,</i> and one book <i>On the Holy Spirit,</i> which I translated in Latin, eighteen volumes <i>On Isaiah,</i> three books of commentaries <i>On Hosea,</i> addressed to me, and five books <i>On Zechariah,</i> written at my request, also commentaries <i>On Job,</i> and many other things, to give an account of which would be a work of itself. <a name="fr_2539"></a><a href="#fn_2539"><font size="1">2540</font></a>
  He is still living, and has already passed his eighty-third year.</p>
