 </span> the presbyter, surnamed Sul<a name="page_390"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 390</font></a> <a name="v.iv.xx-Page_390"></a>pitius, of the province of Aquitania, a man distinguished by his birth, by his excellent literary work, by his devotion to poverty and by his humility, beloved also of the sainted men Martin bishop of Tours and Paulinus Nolanus, wrote small books which are far from despicable. He wrote to his sister many <i>Letters</i> exhorting to love of God and contempt of the world. These are well known. He wrote two to the above mentioned Paulinus Nolanus and others to others, but because, in some, family matters are included, they have not been collected for publication. He composed also a <i>Chronicle,</i> and wrote also to the profit of many, a <i>Life of the holy Martin,</i> monk and bishop, a man famous for signs and wonders and virtues. <a name="fr_2604"></a><a href="#fn_2604"><font size="1">2605</font></a>
  He also wrote a <i>Conference between Postumianus and Gallus,</i> in which he himself acted as mediator and judge of the debate. The subject matter was the manner of life of the oriental monks and of St. Martin—a sort of dialogue in two divisions. In the first of these he mentions a decree of the bishops at the synod of Alexandria in his own time to the effect that Origen is to be read, though cautiously, by those who are wise, for the good that is in him, and is to be rejected by the less able on account of the evil. In his old age, he was led astray by the Pelagians, and recognizing the guilt of much speaking, kept silent until his death, in order that by penitent silence he might atone for the sin which he had contracted by speaking.</p>
