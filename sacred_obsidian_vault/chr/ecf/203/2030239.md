 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.l-p3"></a>The characters of souls are often depicted in words and their unseen forms revealed; so now your reverences letter exhibits the piety of your holy soul. Your waiting for that sentence, your anxiety, your search for advocates and preparation for a defence, clearly indicate your souls zeal about divine things. We on the contrary are in a manner inactive and sleepy; we are nurtured in idleness, and stand in need of much assistance from prayers. Give them to us, O man beloved of God, that now at all events we may wake up and give some care to the soul.</p>
