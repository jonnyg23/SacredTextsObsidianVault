  a native of Asia, instructed in the Scriptures at Rome by Tatian whom we mentioned above, published many things especially a work <i>Against Marcion</i> in which he tells how the Marcionites differ from one another as well as from the church and says <a name="page_371"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 371</font></a> <a name="v.iii.xxxix-Page_371"></a>that the aged Apelles, another heretic, was once engaged in a discussion with him, and that he, Rhodo, held Apelles up to ridicule because he declared that he did not know the God whom he worshipped. He mentioned in the same book, which he wrote to Callistion, that he had been a pupil of Tatian at Rome. He also composed elegant treatises <i>On the six days of creation</i> and a notable work <i>against the Phrygians</i>. <a name="fr_2442"></a><a href="#fn_2442"><font size="1">2443</font></a>
  He flourished in the reigns of Commodus and Severus.</p>
