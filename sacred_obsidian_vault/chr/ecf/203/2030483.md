  a bishop of Poitiers in Aquitania, was a member of the party of Saturninus bishop of Arles. Banished into Phrygia by the Synod of Beziérs he composed twelve books <i>Against the Arians</i> and another book <i>On Councils</i> written to the Gallican bishops, and <i>Commentaries on the Psalms</i> that is on the first and second, from the fifty-first to the sixty-second, and from the one hundred and eighteenth to the end of the book. In this work he imitated Origen, but added also some original matter. There is a little book of his <i>To Constantius</i> which he presented to the emperor while he was living in Constantinople, and another <i>On Constantius</i> which he wrote after his death and a book <i>Against Valens and Ursacius,</i> containing a history of the Ariminian and Selucian Councils and <i>To Sallust the prefect</i> or<i>Against Dioscurus,</i> also a book of <i>Hymns and mysteries</i>, a commentary <i>On Matthew</i> and treatises On <i>Job,</i> which he translated freely from the Greek of Origen, and another elegant little work <i>Against Auxentius</i> and<i>Epistles</i> to different persons. They say he has written <i>On the Song of Songs</i> but this work is not known to us. He died at Poictiers during the reign of Valentinianus and Valens.</p>
