 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.iv.ix-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.iv.ix-p2.1"></a>The</span> illustrious emperor thus took heed of the apostolic decrees, but Audæus, a Syrian alike in race and in speech, appeared at that time as an inventor of new decrees. He had long ago begun to incubate iniquities and now appeared in his true character. At first he understood in an absurd sense the passage “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">698</font></a>
  From want of apprehension of the meaning of the divine Scripture he understood the Divine Being to have a human form, and conjectured it to be enveloped in bodily parts; for Holy Scripture frequently describes the divine operations under the names of human parts, since by these means the providence of God is made more easily intelligible to minds incapable of perceiving any immaterial ideas. To this impiety Audæus added others of a similar kind. By an eclectic process he adopted some of the doctrines of Manes <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">699</font></a>
  and denied that the God of the universe is creator of either fire or darkness. But these and all similar errors are concealed by the adherents of his faction.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.ix-p5"></a>They allege that they are separated from the assemblies of the Church. But since some of them exact a cursed usury, and some live unlawfully with women without the bond of wedlock, while those who are innocent of these practices live in free fellowship with the guilty, they hide the blasphemy of their doctrines by accounting as they do for their living by themselves. The plea is however an impudent one, and the natural result of Pharisaic teaching, for the Pharisees accused the Physician of souls and bodies in their question to the holy Apostles “How is it that your Master eateth with publicans and sinners?” <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">700</font></a>
  and through the prophet, God of such men says “Which say, come not near me for I am pure this is smoke of my wrath.” <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">701</font></a>
  But this is not a time to refute their unreasonable error. I therefore pass on to the remainder of my narrative. <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">702</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.iv.ix-p8"></a> Anthropomorphism, or the attribution to God of a human <i>form</i> is the frequent result of an unintelligent anthropopathism, which ascribes to God human <i>feelings.</i> Paganism did not rise higher than the material view. Judaism, sometimes apparently anthropomorphic, taught a Spiritual God. Tertullian uses expressions which exposed him to the charge of anthropomorphism, and the Pseudo Clementines (xvii. 2) go farther. The Audæus of the text appears to be the first founder of anything like an anthropomorphic sect.</p>
