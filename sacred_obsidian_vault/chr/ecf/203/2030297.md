 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.cviii-p2"></a>True indeed is the promise of Davids Psalm, for through him the Spirit of truth gave this promise to them that believe, “Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also to him; and he shall bring it to pass; and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noonday.” <a name="fr_1842"></a><a href="#fn_1842"><font size="1">1843</font></a>
  This we find too has come to pass in the case of your piety. For the great care you bestow upon them that are weeping for their orphanhood, and your struggles on behalf of the apostolic doctrines, are in every ones mouth, and so, as the prophets say, “Hidden things are made manifest.” Since I too have heard of your pietys admirable exertions I write to salute you, most godly sir, and beseech you to increase your glory by adding to your labours, and to fight on behalf of the doctrine of the Gospels, that we may both keep the inheritance of our fathers unimpaired, and bring our Master His talent with good usury. <a name="fr_1843"></a><a href="#fn_1843"><font size="1">1844</font></a>
