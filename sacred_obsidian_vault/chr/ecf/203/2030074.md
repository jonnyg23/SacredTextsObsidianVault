 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p7"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p7.1"></a>Germanicia</span> is a city on the coasts of Cilicia, Syria, and Cappadocia, and belongs to the province called Euphratisia. Eudoxius, the head of its church, directly he heard of the death of Leontius, betook himself to Antioch and clutched the see, where he ravaged the vineyard of the Lord like a wild boar. He did not even attempt to hide his evil ways, like Leontius, but raged in direct attack upon the apostolic decrees, and involved in various troubles all who had the hardihood to gainsay him. Now at this time Basilius had succeeded Marcellus, and held the helm of the church of Ancyra, the capital of Galatia, and Sebastia, the chief city of Armenia, was under the guidance of Eustathius. No sooner had these bishops heard of the iniquity and madness of Eudoxius, than they wrote to inform the Emperor Constantius of his audacity. Constantius was now still tarrying in the west, and, after the death of the tyrants, was endeavouring to heal the harm they had caused. Both bishops were well known to the Emperor and had great influence with him on account of the high character they bore.</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p2"></a> Eudoxius, eighth bishop of Constantinople, and formerly of Germanicia (Γερμανικεια, now Marash, or Banicia), was one of the most violent of the Arians. He was originally refused ordination by St. Eustathius, but on the deposition of that bishop in 331 the Eusebians pushed him forward. After ruling at Germanicia for some seventeen years he intruded himself on the see of Antioch.</p>  
 <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p3"></a>Under the patronage of the Acacians he became patriarch of Constantinople in 360, and died in 370.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p4"></a> Basilius, a learned physician, a Semiarian of Ancyra, was made bishop of that see on the deposition of Marcellus, in 336, and excommunicated at Sardica in 347. In 350 he was reinstated at the command of Constantius. He was again exiled under Acacian influence, failed to get restitution from Jovian, and probably died in exile. (Soc. ii, 20, 26, iv, 24.) Vide also Theod. ii, 23. His works are lost. Athanasius praises him as among those who were (de Synod. 603 ed. Migne) “not far from accepting the Homousion.”</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p5"></a> Eustathius was bishop of Sebasteia or Sebaste (Siwas) on the Halys, from 357 to 380.</p>  
 <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p6"></a>Basil, Ep. 244<a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p6.1"></a>, §9, says that he was a heretic “black who could not turn white”; but he exhibited many shades of theological colour, preserving through all vicissitudes a high personal character, and a something “more than human.” Basil Ep. 212<a name="iv.viii.ii.xx-p6.2"></a>, §2. Ordained by Eulalius, he was degraded because he insisted on wearing very unclerical costume. (Soc. ii, 43.) The question of the identity of this Eustathius with the Eustathius condemned at the Council of Ancyra is discussed in the <i>Dict. Christ. Ant</i>. i, 709.</p>
