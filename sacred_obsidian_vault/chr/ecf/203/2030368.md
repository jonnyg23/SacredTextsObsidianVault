 </p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.clxxix-p3"></a>I think that more than all the very holy and venerable bishop, my lord John, must have been gratified at my refusing either to give my consent to the condemnation of the very holy and venerable bishop Nestorius or to violate the pledges made at Tarsus, Chalcedon and Ephesus. <a name="fr_2309"></a><a href="#fn_2309"><font size="1">2310</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxxix-p5"></a>He remembers also what was frequently received from us at Antioch after our departure.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxxix-p6"></a>Let no one therefore deceive your holiness into the belief that I should ever do this, for God is without doubt on my side and strengthening me.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.clxxix-p2"></a> The complete letter is given in another Latin version Baluz. Synod. LXVI. Garnerius makes it the conclusion of the letter to Andrew of Samosata.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.clxxix-p4"></a> The order of events is reversed. John and his friends went from Ephesus to Chalcedon, from Chalcedon via Ancyra to Tarsus, where he was in his own patriarchate, and held a council, confirming Cyrils deposition, and pledging its members never to abandon Nestorius. Again at Antioch the same course was repeated.</p>
