 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.lxxxv-p1"></a>  <i>LXXXV. To the Bishop Basil. <a name="fr_1783"></a><a href="#fn_1783"><font size="1">1784</font></a>
 </i></p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.lxxxv-p3"></a>The chief good is said by the divine Paul to be love, <a name="fr_1784"></a><a href="#fn_1784"><font size="1">1785</font></a>
  and by love he ordered the nurslings of the faith to be fed. Of this love your piety possesses great wealth, and so has told me what was befitting and given me pleasant news. For to them that fear the Lord what can be pleasanter than the health and harmony of the doctrines of the truth? Be well assured, most godly sir, that we were much delighted to hear the intelligence of our common friend; and in proportion to our previous distress at hearing that he described the nature of flesh and of Godhead as one, and openly attributed the passion of salvation to the impassible Godhead, so were all rejoiced to read the letters of your holiness, and to learn that he maintains in their integrity the properties of the natures and denies both the change of God the Word into flesh, and the mutation of the flesh into the nature of Godhead, maintaining on the contrary that in the one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Word made man, the properties of either nature abide unconfounded. We praise the God of all for the harmony of divine faith. We have however written to either Cilicia, <a name="fr_1785"></a><a href="#fn_1785"><font size="1">1786</font></a>
  although our intelligence is imperfect, as to whether there are really any opponents of the truth, and have charged the godly bishops to search and examine if there are any who divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons, and either to bring them to their senses by admonition, or cut them off from the roll of the brethren. For in fact we equally repudiate both those who dare to assert one nature of flesh and Godhead, and those who divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons and strive to go beyond the definitions of the Apostles.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.lxxxv-p6"></a>But let your holiness be well assured that we are disposed to peace. For if the prophet says, “With them that hate peace I was peaceful,” <a name="fr_1786"></a><a href="#fn_1786"><font size="1">1787</font></a>
  much more readily do we welcome the peace of God.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.lxxxv-p8"></a>Some of those men who have been fed on lies have hurried to Alexandria and patched up calumnies against me, with the result that the godly bishop of that city, led away by their statements, although he had been fully informed by my letters, has sent a pious bishop to the imperial city. I beg you therefore to shew your accustomed kindness to him, and to confront falsehood with the truth.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.lxxxv-p2"></a> There appears to be nothing in this letter or in Letter CII. also addressed to bishop Basil to identify the recipient. Basil bishop of Seleucia in Isauria was at the Latrocinium and at Chalcedon. Basil, bishop of Trajanopolis was also present at the same councils. Garnerius is in favour of the former, and notes the date as 448.</p>
