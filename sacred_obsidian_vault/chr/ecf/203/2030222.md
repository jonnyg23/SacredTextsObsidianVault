 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.xxxiii-p1"></a>  <i>XXXIII. To Stasimus, Count and Primate. <a name="fr_1672"></a><a href="#fn_1672"><font size="1">1673</font></a>
 </i></p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xxxiii-p3"></a>To narrate the sufferings of the most honourable and dignified Celestinianus would require tragic eloquence. Tragic writers set forth fully the ills of humanity, but I can only in a word inform your excellency that his country is Libya, so long on all mens tongues, his city the far famed Carthage, his hereditary rank a seat in her famous council, his circumstances affluent. But all this is now a tale, mere words stripped bare of realities. The barbarian war has deprived him of all this. But such is fortune; she refuses to remain always with the same men and hastens to change her abode to dwell with others. <a name="fr_1673"></a><a href="#fn_1673"><font size="1">1674</font></a>
  I beg to introduce this guest to your excellency, and beseech you that he may enjoy your far famed beneficence. I beg also that through your excellency he may become known to all those who are in office and opulence, in order that you may both become a means of advantage to them and win the higher reward from our merciful God.</p>
