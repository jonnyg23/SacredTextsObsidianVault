 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.lvii-p3"></a>Besides other boons the Ruler of the universe has granted to us that of hearing of your excellencys honour, and of congratulating at once yourself on your elevation and your subjects on so gentle a rule. I have thought it wrong to give no expression to my satisfaction and to refrain from manifesting it by letter. Your magnificence knows quite well how warm is our affection towards you—an affection most warmly reciprocated. And being so filled with love we beseech the Giver of all good things ever to pour on you His manifold gifts.</p>
