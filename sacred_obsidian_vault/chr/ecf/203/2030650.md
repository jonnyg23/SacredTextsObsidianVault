 <p> <a name="vi.xi.ii.xiii"></a>
 </p><p class="c24"><a name="vi.xi.ii.xiii-p1"></a>  12. But I wrote a Preface <a name="fr_2839"></a><a href="#fn_2839"><font size="1">2840</font></a>
  to each of these works, and in both, but especially in the Preface to the work of Pamphilus, which was translated first, I set in the forefront an exposition of my faith, affirming that my belief is in accordance with the catholic faith; and I stated that whatever men might find in the original or in my translation, my share in it in no way implicated my own faith, and further, in reference to the <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.xi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></a>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> I gave this warning. I had found that in these books some things relating to the faith were set forth in a catholic sense, just as the Church proclaims them, while in other places, when the very same thing is in question, expressions of a contrary kind are used. I had thought it right to set forth these points in the way in which the author had set them forth when he had propounded the catholic view of them: on the other hand, when I found things which were contrary to the authors real opinion, I looked on them as things inserted by others, (for he witnesses by the complaints contained in his letter that this has been done), and therefore rejected them, or at all events considered that I might omit them as having none of the “godly edifying in the faith.” It will not, I think, be considered superfluous to insert these passages from my Prefaces, so that proof may be at hand for each statement. And further, to prevent the reader from falling into any mistake as to the passages which I insert from other documents, I have, where the quotation is from my own works, placed a single mark against the passage, but, where the words are those of my opponent, a double mark. <a name="fr_2840"></a><a href="#fn_2840"><font size="1">2841</font></a>
