  bishop of Ancyra, flourished in the reign of Constantinus and Constantius and wrote many volumes of various <i>Propositions</i> and especially against the Arians. Works of Asterius and Apollinarius against him are current, which accuse him of Sabellianism. Hilary too, in the seventh book of his work <i>Against the Arians,</i> mentions him as a heretic, but he defends himself against the charge through the fact that Julius and Athanasius bishops of Rome and Alexandria communed with him.</p>
