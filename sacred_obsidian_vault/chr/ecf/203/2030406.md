  a philosopher, and wearing the garb of philosopher, a citizen of Neapolis, a city of Palestine, and the son of Priscus Bacchius, laboured strenuously in behalf of the religion of Christ, insomuch that he delivered to Antoninus Pius and his sons and the senate, a work written <i>Against the nations,</i> and did not shun the ignominy of the cross. He addressed another book also to the successors of this Antoninus, Marcus Antoninus Verus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus. Another volume of his <i>Against the nations,</i> is also extant, where he discusses the nature of demons, and a fourth against the nations which he entitled, <i>Refutation</i> and yet another <i>On the sovereignty of God,</i> and another book which he entitled, <i>Psaltes,</i> and another <i>On the Soul,</i> the <i>Dialogue against the Jews,</i> which he held against Trypho, the leader of the Jews, and also notable volumes <i>Against Marcion,</i> which Irenæus also mentions in the fourth book <a name="fr_2420"></a><a href="#fn_2420"><font size="1">2421</font></a>
  <i>Against heresies,</i> also another book <i>Against all heresies</i> which he mentions in the <i>Apology</i> which is addressed to Antoninus Pius. He, when he had held <span class="Greek"><a name="v.iii.xxv-p4.1"></a>διατριβάς</span> in the city of Rome, and had convicted Crescens the cynic, who said many blasphemous things against the Christians, of gluttony and fear of death, and had proved him devoted to luxury and lusts, at last, accused of being a Christian, through the efforts and wiles of Crescens, he shed his blood for Christ.</p>
