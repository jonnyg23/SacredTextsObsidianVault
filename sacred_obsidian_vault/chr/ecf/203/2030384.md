 </span> the son of John, from the village of Bethsaida in the province of Galilee, brother of Andrew the apostle, and himself chief of the apostles, after having been bishop of the church of Antioch and having preached to the Dispersion <a name="fr_2337"></a><a href="#fn_2337"><font size="1">2338</font></a>
 —the believers in circumcision, <a name="fr_2338"></a><a href="#fn_2338"><font size="1">2339</font></a>
  in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia—pushed on to Rome in the second year of Claudius to overthrow Simon Magus, <a name="fr_2339"></a><a href="#fn_2339"><font size="1">2340</font></a>
  and held the sacerdotal chair there for twenty-five years until the last, that is the fourteenth, year of Nero. At his hands he received the crown of martyrdom being nailed to the cross with his head towards the ground and his feet raised on high, asserting that he was unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as his Lord. He wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him. Then too the Gospel according to Mark, who was his disciple and interpreter, is ascribed to him. On the other hand, the books, of which one is entitled his Acts, another his Gospel, a third his Preaching, a fourth his Revelation, a fifth his “Judgment” are rejected as apocryphal. <a name="fr_2340"></a><a href="#fn_2340"><font size="1">2341</font></a>

The <i>Acts, Gospel, Preaching</i> and <i>Revelation</i> are mentioned by Eusebius. The <i>Judgment</i> was added by Jerome. This last has been much discussed of late in connection with the recently discovered <i>Teaching of the Twelve.</i> The identification of the Teaching with the Judgment is credited to Dr. von Gebhardt (Salmon in Smith and Wace <i>Dict.</i> v. 4 (1887) pp. 810–11). The recent literature of it is immense. Compare Schaff, <i>Oldest Church Manual,</i> and literature in <i>Ante-Nic. Fath.</i> vol. 9 pp. 83–86.</p>
