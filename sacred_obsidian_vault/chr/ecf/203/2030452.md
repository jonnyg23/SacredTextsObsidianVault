  bishop of Alexandria, as presbyter had charge of the catechetical school under Heraclas, and was the most distinguished pupil of Origen. Consenting to the doctrine of Cyprian and the African synod, on the rebaptizing <a name="fr_2484"></a><a href="#fn_2484"><font size="1">2485</font></a>
  of heretics, he sent many letters to different people, which are yet extant; He wrote one to Fabius, bishop of the church at Antioch, <i>On penitence,</i> another <i>To the Romans,</i> by the hand of Hippolytus, two letters <i>To Xystus,</i> who had succeeded Stephen, two also <i>To Philemon and Dionysius,</i> presbyters of the church at Rome, and another <i>To</i> the same <i>Dionysius,</i> afterwards bishop of Rome; and <i>To Novatian,</i> treating of their claim that Novatian had been ordained bishop of Rome, against his will. The beginning of this epistle is as follows: “Dionysius to Novatian, his brother greeting. If you have been ordained unwillingly, as you say, you will prove it, when you shall willingly retire.”</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="v.iii.lxxi-p5"></a>There is another epistle of his also <i>To Dionysius and Didymus,</i> and many <i>Festal epistles on the passover,</i> written in a declamatory style, also one to the church of Alexandria <i>On exile,</i> one <i>To Hierax,</i> <a name="fr_2485"></a><a href="#fn_2485"><font size="1">2486</font></a>
 bishop in Egypt, and yet others <i>On mortality, On the Sabbath,</i> and<i>On the gymnasium,</i> also one <i>To Hermammon</i> and others <i>On the persecution of Decius,</i> and two books <i>Against Nepos the bishop,</i> who asserted in his writings a thousand years reign in the body. Among other things he diligently discussed the <i>Apocalypse of John,</i> and wrote <i>Against Sabellius</i> and <i>To Ammon,</i> bishop of Ber<a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 377</font></a> <a name="v.iii.lxxi-Page_377"></a>nice, and <i>To Telesphorus,</i> also <i>To Euphranor,</i> also four books <i>To Dionysius,</i> bishop of Rome, to the Laodiceans <i>On penitence</i>, to Origen <i>On martyrdom,</i> to the Armenians <i>On penitence,</i> <a name="fr_2486"></a><a href="#fn_2486"><font size="1">2487</font></a>
 also <i>On the order of transgression,</i> to Timothy <i>On nature,</i> to Euphranor <i>On temptation,</i> many letters also <i>To Basilides,</i> in one of which he asserts that he also began to write commentaries on Ecclesiastes. The notable epistle which he wrote against Paul of Samosata, a few days before his death is also current. He died in the twelfth year of Gallienus.</p>
