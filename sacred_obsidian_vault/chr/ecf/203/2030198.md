 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.ix-p2"></a>Your piety is annoyed and distressed at the sentence passed on me unjustly and without a trial. I am comforted that you are so feeling. Had I been justly condemned I should have been sorry at having given my judges reasonable grounds for what they have done, but, as it is, my conscience is quite clear, and I feel joyful and exultant and look forward to the remission of other sins on account of this injustice. Naboth lives in mens memories only because he suffered that unjust death. Only pray that we be not abandoned of God and let the enemy continue to do his worst. Gods good will is enough to make me very cheerful and if He is on my side I despise all my troubles as trifles. <a name="fr_1624"></a><a href="#fn_1624"><font size="1">1625</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.ix-p3"></a> Probably the condemnation referred to is the imperial Edict of March 449 relegating Theodoret to the limits of his own diocese. cf. Epp. 79. 80.</p>
