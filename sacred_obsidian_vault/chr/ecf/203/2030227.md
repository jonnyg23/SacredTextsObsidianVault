 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xxxviii-p2"></a>The divine feast of salvation has brought us the founts of Gods good gifts, the blessing of the Cross, and the immortality which sprang from our Lords death, the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ which gives promise of the resurrection of us all. These being the gifts of the feast, such its exhibition of the bounty of divine grace, it has filled us with spiritual gladness. But encompassed as we are on every side by many and <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a> <a name="iv.x.xxxviii-Page_263"></a>great calamities, the brightness of the feast is dimmed, and lamentation and wailing are mingled with our psalmody. Such sorrows does sin bring forth. It is sin which has filled our life with pangs; it is on account of sin that death is lovelier to us than life; it is on account of sin that when we think in imagination of that incorruptible tribunal we shudder even at the life to come. So may your piety pray that Gods loving-kindness may light on us, and that this gloomy and terrible cloud may be dispersed and sunshine again quickly give us joy.</p>
