  bishop of some church (the name of the city I have not been able to learn) wrote <i>A reckoning of the Paschal feast and chronological tables</i> which he worked out up to the first year of the Emperor Alexander. He also discussed the cycle of sixteen years, which the Greeks called <span class="Greek"><a name="v.iii.lxiii-p3.1"></a>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="v.iii.lxiii-p3.2"></a>κκαιδεκαετηρίδα</span> and gave the cue to Eusebius, who composed on the same Paschal feast a cycle of nineteen years, that is <span class="Greek"><a name="v.iii.lxiii-p3.3"></a>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="v.iii.lxiii-p3.4"></a>ννεακαιδεκαετηρίδα</span>. He wrote some commentaries on the Scriptures, among which are the following: <i>On the six days of creation, On Exodus, On the Song of Songs, On Genesis, On Zechariah, On the Psalms, On Isaiah, On Daniel, On the Apocalypse, On the Proverbs, On Ecclesiastes, On Saul, On the Pythonissa, On the Antichrist, On the resurrection, Against Marcion, On the Passover, Against all heresies,</i> and an exhortation <i>On the praise of our Lord and Saviour,</i> in which he indicates that he is speaking in the church in the presence of Origen. Ambrosius, who we have said was converted by Origen from the heresy of Marcion, to the true faith, urged Origen to write, in emulation of Hyppolytus, commentaries on the Scriptures, offering him seven, and even more secretaries, and their expenses, and an equal number of copyists, and what is still more, with incredible zeal, daily exacting work from him, on which account Origen, in one of his epistles, calls him his “Taskmaster.”</p>
