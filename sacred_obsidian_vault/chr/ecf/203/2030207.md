 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xviii-p2"></a>Whenever I cast my eyes on the divine law which calls those who are joined together in marriage “one flesh,” <a name="fr_1645"></a><a href="#fn_1645"><font size="1">1646</font></a>
  I am at a <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> <a name="iv.x.xviii-Page_257"></a>loss how to comfort the limb that has been sundered, because I take account of the greatness of the pang. But when I consider the course of nature, and the law which the Creator has laid down in the words “Dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return,” <a name="fr_1646"></a><a href="#fn_1646"><font size="1">1647</font></a>
  and all that goes on daily in all the world on land and sea—for either husbands first approach the end of life or this lot first befalls the wives—I find from these reflections many grounds of consolation; and above all the hopes that have been given us by our Lord and Saviour. For the reason of the accomplishment of the mystery of the incarnation was that we, being taught the defeat of death, should no more grieve beyond measure at the loss by death of those we love, but await the longed-for fulfilment of the hope of the resurrection. I entreat your Excellency to reflect on these things, and to overcome the pain of your grief; and all the more because the children of your common love are with you, and give you every ground of comfort. Let us then praise Him who governs our lives wisely, nor rouse His anger by immoderate lamentation, for in His wisdom He knows what is good for us, and in His mercy He gives it.</p>
