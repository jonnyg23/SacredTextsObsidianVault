 </p><p class="c24"><a name="vi.xii.i.xiii-p1"></a>  12. Otherwise, if everything which goes against Origen and his followers is supposed to be said by me against you, we must suppose that the letters of the popes Theophilus and Epiphanius and the rest of the bishops which at their desire I lately translated <a name="fr_3021"></a><a href="#fn_3021"><font size="1">3022</font></a>
  are meant to attack you and tear you to pieces; we must suppose too that the rescripts of the Emperors which order that the Origenists should be banished from Alexandria and from Egypt have been written at my dictation. The abhorrence shown by the Pontiff of the city of Rome against these men was nothing but a scheme of mine. The outburst of hatred which immediately after your translation blazed up through the whole world against Origen who before had been read without prejudice was the work of my pen. If I have got all this power, I wonder that you are not afraid of me. But I really acted with extreme moderation. In my public letter <a name="fr_3022"></a><a href="#fn_3022"><font size="1">3023</font></a>
  I took every precaution to prevent your supposing that anything in it was directed against you; but I wrote at the same time a short letter <a name="fr_3023"></a><a href="#fn_3023"><font size="1">3024</font></a>
  to you, expostulating with you on the subject of your praises. This letter my friends did not think it right to send you, because you were not at Rome, and because, as they tell me, you and your companions were scattering accusations of things unworthy of the Christian profession about my manner of life. But I have subjoined a copy of it to this book, so that you may understand what pain you gave me and with what brotherly self-restraint I bore it.</p>
