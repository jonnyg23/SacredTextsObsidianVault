 </p><p class="c23"><a name="v.ii.iv-p1"></a>  4. <i>Editions</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="v.ii.iv-p2"></a>The editions of Jerome are relatively as numerous as the <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iv-p2.1"></a>mss.</span> The <i>Illustrious men</i> is included in almost all the editions of his collected works, in his collected “minor writ<a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a> <a name="v.ii.iv-Page_355"></a>ings” and in many of the editions of his epistles (most of the editions in fact from 1468 to about 1530.)</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.iv-p3"></a>It is several times printed separately or with Gennadius or other catalogues. The editions of Gennadius are less numerous but he is often united with Jerome in the editions of Jeromes collected works, and generally in the separate editions.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.iv-p4"></a>The following list of editions is printed as illustrative. It does not pretend to be complete, but is simply a list of such as have been personally examined by the translator up to date; s. l. et a (6) + 390 ff, 62, 11.; s. l. et a. (1468?) 223ff, 2 col. 50 11.; Rome 1468. <i>P. de Max;</i> (Compluti?) 1470; Rome 1470; Mogunt 1470; s. l. et a. (Augsb. Zainer 1470); s. l. et a. 1470, 4º 23 11: s. a. “JA. RV” 1471?; Rome 1479; Parma 1480; Ven. 1488; Basil 1489; Ven. 1490; Basil 1492 Norimb. 1495; s. l. 1496?; Basil 1497; Lyons, 1508; Paris 1512; Lyons 1513; Lyons 1518 Basil 1525 Lyons 1526 (Erasmus); Basil 1526 (Erasm) Basil 1529 Lyons 1530 Paris 1534; Frankfort 1549; Bas. 1553; Bas. 1565; Rome 1565–; Rome 1576 Colon 1580; Paris 1609; Helmst 1611–12 Cologne 1616; Frf. [1622]; Antw. 1639 Frf. 1684; Paris 1706 (Martianay &amp; Pouget); Helmst. 1700; Hamb. 1718; Veron. 1734–42 (Vallarsi); repr. 1766–72; Florence 1791; Paris 1865 (Migne); Lpz. 1879 (Herding) Turin 1875, 1877, 1885 (Jerome only).</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.iv-p5"></a>Andreas, Erasmus, Victorinus, Graevius, Martianay, Miraeus, Fabricius, Cyprian are among the earlier editors but Erasmus is <i>facile princeps</i> in popularity of reprint. The edition of Vallarsi in 1734–42 was a decided advance toward a critical text. Various editors before him had made use of various <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iv-p5.1"></a>mss.</span> especially the “Corbeiensis” or “Sangermanensis” but secondarily <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iv-p5.2"></a>mss.</span> at Wulfenbüttel, Munich, the Bodleian, Nürnberg, “Sigbergensis,” “Gemblacensis,” “Marcianus” and others. Vallarsi founded his edition largely on a Verona <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iv-p5.3"></a>ms.</span> (still there) on the “Corbeiensis” so much used and praised before (now Paris Lat. 12161 “St. Crucis” one at Lucca of the 9th century and more or less on <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iv-p5.4"></a>mss.</span> employed by previous editors. This edition has remained the standard and is the one adopted for the Migne edition.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.iv-p6"></a>The most recent edition which pretends to a critical character is that of Herding (Lpz. 1879). The editions by Tamietti are simply school editions of Jerome only, and make no pretensions to a critical text. The edition of Herding is founded on a transcript of Vat. Reg. 2077, 7th century; Bamberg 677, 11th century; Bern, 11 cent. and a much mutilated Nürnberg <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iv-p6.1"></a>ms.</span> of the 14th century. But it appears that the transcript of Vaticanus only covered the Jerome and a few scanty readings from Gennadius and the same is true of the collation made for this editor later from the Paris <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iv-p6.2"></a>ms.</span> (Corbeiensis).</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.iv-p7"></a>Sittl, (Jahresber; u. class. Alterthumsw. 1888. 2 p. 243) says that the edition “without the preface which contains a collation of Codex Corbeiensis would be worthless.” This is a little strong, for the readings he gives from Vaticanus have a decided value in default of other sources for its readings and his strict following of this often produces a correct reading against Vallarsi who was naturally inclined to follow Veronensis and Corbeiensis both of which were probably a good deal manipulated after they left the hand of Gennadius. The collation of Corbeiensis besides excluding Gennadius is not over exact and some of the most effaced pages seem to have been given up entirely by the collator.</p>
