 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1"></a>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV</span>.—<i>Paulus, Bishop of Constantinople</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2.1"></a>Paulus <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">462</font></a>
 </span>, bishop of Constantinople, who faithfully maintained orthodox doctrines, was accused by the unsound Arians of exciting seditions, and of such other crimes as they usually laid to the charge of all those who preached true piety. The people, who feared the machinations of his enemies, would not permit him to go to Sardica. The Arians, taking advantage of the weakness of the emperor, procured from him an edict of banishment against Paulus, who was, accordingly, sent to Cucusus, a little town formerly included in Cappadocia, but now in Lesser Armenia. But these disturbers of the public peace were not satisfied with having driven the admirable Paulus into a desert. They sent the agents of their cruelty to despatch him by a violent death. St. Athanasius testifies to this fact in the defence which he wrote of his own flight. He uses the following words <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">463</font></a>
 : “They pursued Paulus, bishop of Constantinople, and having seized him at Cucusus, a city of Cappadocia, they had him strangled, using as their executioner Philippus the prefect, who was the protector of their heresy, and the active agent of their most atrocious projects <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">464</font></a>
 .”</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iv-p6"></a>Such were the murders to which the blasphemy of Arius gave rise. Their mad rage against the Only-begotten was matched by cruel deeds against His servants.</p>
