 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.lx-p1"></a>  <i>LX. To Dioscorus, Bishop of Alexandria.</i> <a name="fr_1704"></a><a href="#fn_1704"><font size="1">1705</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.lx-p3"></a>Among many forms of virtue by which we hear that your holiness is adorned (for all mens ears are filled by the flying fame of your glory, which speeds in all directions) special praise is unanimously given to your modesty, a characteristic of which our Lord in His law has given Himself as an ensample, saying, “Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart;” <a name="fr_1705"></a><a href="#fn_1705"><font size="1">1706</font></a>
  for though God is high, or rather most high He honoured at His incarnation the meek and lowly spirit. Looking then to Him, sir, you do not behold the multitude of your subjects nor the exaltation of your throne, but you see rather human nature, and lifes rapid changes, and follow the divine laws whose observance gives us the kingdom of heaven. Hearing of this modesty on the part of your holiness, I take courage in a letter to salute a person sacred and dear to God, and I offer prayers whereof the fruit is salvation. Occasion is given me to write by the very pious presbyter Eusebius, for when I heard of his journey thither I immediately indited this letter to call upon your holiness to support us by your prayers, and by your reply to give us a spiritual feast, sending to us who are hungry the blessed banquet of your words.</p>
