 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.lxxxvii-p1"></a>  <i>LXXXVII. To Domnus, Bishop of Apamea.</i> <a name="fr_1792"></a><a href="#fn_1792"><font size="1">1793</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.lxxxvii-p3"></a>The law of brotherly love demanded that I should receive many letters from your godliness at this time. For the divine Apostle charges us to weep with them that weep and rejoice with them that do rejoice. <a name="fr_1793"></a><a href="#fn_1793"><font size="1">1794</font></a>
  I have not received a single one, although just lately I was visited by some of the pious monks of your monastery with the pious presbyter Elias. Nevertheless I have written, and I salute your holiness; and I make you acquainted with the fact that the consolation of the Master has stood me in stead of all other, for in truth not even had I as many mouths as I have hairs on my head, could I worthily praise Him for my being deemed worthy of suffering on account of my confession of Him, and for the apparent disgrace which I hold more august than any honour. And if I be banished to the uttermost parts of the earth all the more will I praise Him as being counted worthy of greater blessings. Nevertheless I hope your holiness will put up prayers for the quiet of the holy churches. It is because of the storm that is assailing them that I wail and groan and lament. That quiet, as I know, was driven away by the Osrhoene clergy, <a name="fr_1794"></a><a href="#fn_1794"><font size="1">1795</font></a>
  who poured out countless words against me, although I had no share in their condemnation, nor in the sentence passed upon them; on the contrary, as your holiness knows, I besought <a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a> <a name="iv.x.lxxxvii-Page_283"></a>that the communion might be given to them at Easter. But slanderers find no difficulty in saying what they like. My consolation lies in the blessing of the Master who said, “Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” <a name="fr_1795"></a><a href="#fn_1795"><font size="1">1796</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.lxxxvii-p5"></a> The action of the Osrhoene clergy here referred to is their accusation of Theodorets friend Ibas of Edessa. The “sentence” was that of excommunication delivered by Ibas. The leaders of the cabal against him were instigated by Uranius, bishop of Himeria, one of Ibass suffragans. cf. note on p. 291.</p>
