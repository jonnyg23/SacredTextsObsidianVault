 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p1"></a>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p1.1"></a>Chapter X</span>.—<i>Of the heresy of the Messaliani</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p2.1"></a>At</span> this time also arose the heresy of the Messaliani. Those who translate their name into Greek call them Euchitæ. <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">703</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p4"></a>They have also another designation which arose naturally from their mode of action. From their coming under the influence of a certain demon, which they supposed to be the advent of the Holy Ghost, they are called enthusiasts. <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">704</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p6"></a>Men who have become infected with this plague to its full extent shun manual labour as iniquitous; and, giving themselves over to sloth, call the imaginations of their dreams prophesyings. Of this heresy Dadoes, Sabbas, Adelphius, Hermas, and Simeones were leaders, and others besides, who did not hold aloof from the communion of the Church, alleging that neither good nor harm came of the divine food of which Christ our Master said “Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood shall live for ever.” <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">705</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p8"></a>In their endeavor to hide their unsoundness they shamelessly deny it even after conviction, and abjure men whose opinions are in harmony with their own secret sentiments.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p9"></a>Under these circumstances Letoius, who was at the head of the church of Melitine, <a name="fr_705"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">706</font></a>
  a man full of divine zeal, saw that many monasteries, or, shall I rather say, brigands caves, had drunk deep of this disease. He therefore burnt them, and drove out the wolves from the flock.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p11"></a>In like manner the illustrious Amphilochius <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">707</font></a>
  to whom was committed the charge of the metropolis of the Lycaonians and who ruled all the people, no sooner learnt that this pestilence had invaded his diocese than he made it depart from his borders and freed from its infection the flocks he fed.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p13"></a>Flavianus, <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">708</font></a>
  also, the far famed high-priest of the Antiochenes, on learning that these men were living at Edessa and attacking with their peculiar poison all with whom <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.iv.x-Page_115"></a>they came in contact, sent a company of monks, brought them to Antioch, and in the following manner convicted them in their denial of their heresy. Their accusers, he said, were calumniating them, and the witnesses giving false evidence; and Adelphius, who was a very old man, he accosted with expressions of kindness, and ordered to take a seat at his side. Then he said “We, O venerable sir, who have lived to an advanced age, have more accurate knowledge of human nature, and of the tricks of the demons who oppose us, and have learnt by experience the character of the gift of grace. But these younger men have no clear knowledge of these matters, and cannot brook to listen to spiritual teaching. Wherefore tell me in what sense you say that the opposing spirit retreats, and the grace of the Holy Ghost supervenes.” The old man was won over by these words and gave vent to all his secret venom, for he said that no benefit accrues to the recipients of Holy Baptism, and that it is only by earnest prayer that the in-dwelling demon is driven out, for that every one born into the world derives from his first father slavery to the demons just as he does his nature; but that when these are driven away, then come the Holy Ghost giving sensible and visible signs of His presence, at once freeing the body from the impulse of the passions and wholly ridding the soul of its inclination to the worse; with the result that there is no more need for fasting that restrains the body, nor of teaching or training that bridles it and instructs it how to walk aright. And not only is the recipient of this gift liberated from the wanton motions of the body, but also clearly foresees things to come, and with the eyes beholds the Holy Trinity.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.x-p15"></a>In this wise the divine Flavianus dug into the foul fountain-head and succeeded in laying bare its streams. Then he thus addressed the wretched old man. “O thou that hast grown old in evil days, thy own mouth convicts thee, not I, and thou art testified against by thy own lips.” After their unsoundness had been thus exposed they were expelled from Syria, and withdrew to Pamphylia, which they filled with their pestilential doctrine.</p>
