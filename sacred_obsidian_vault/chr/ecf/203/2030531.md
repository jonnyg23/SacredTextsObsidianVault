  sacred and profane literature and distinguished, whom the book which is called the <i>Lives of the fathers</i> mentions as a most continent and erudite man, wrote many things of use to monks among which are these: <i>Suggestions against the eight principal sins.</i> He was first to mention or among the first at least to teach these setting against them eight books taken from the testimony of the Holy Scriptures only, after the example of our Lord, who always met <a name="page_388"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 388</font></a> <a name="v.iv.xii-Page_388"></a>his tempter with quotations from Scripture, so that every suggestion, whether of the devil or of depraved nature had a testimony against it. This work I have, under instructions, translated into Latin translating with the same simplicity which I found in the Greek. He composed also a book of <i>One hundred sentiments</i> for those living simply as anchorites, arranged by chapters, and one of <i>Fifty sentiments</i> for the erudite and studious, which I first translated into Latin. The former one, translated before, I restored, partly by retranslating and partly by emendation, so as to represent the true meaning of the author, because I saw that the translation was vitiated and confused by time. He composed also a doctrine of the common-life suited to Cenobites and Synodites, <a name="fr_2589"></a><a href="#fn_2589"><font size="1">2590</font></a>
  and to the virgin consecrated to God, a little book suitable to her religion and sex. He published also a few collections of opinions very obscure and, as he himself says of them, only to be understood by the hearts of monks, and these likewise I published in Latin. He lived to old age, mighty in signs and miracles.</p>
