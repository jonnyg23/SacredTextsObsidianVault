 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.clxiv-p1"></a>  <i>CLXIII. First Letter of the Commissioners of the East, sent to Chalcedon, among whom was Theodoretus.</i> <a name="fr_2269"></a><a href="#fn_2269"><font size="1">2270</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.clxiv-p4"></a>On our arrival at Chalcedon, for neither we ourselves nor our opponents were permitted to enter Constantinople, on account of the seditions of the excellent monks, we heard that eight days before we had appeared (behold the glory of the most pious prince) the lord Nestorius was dismissed from Ephesus, free to go where he would; whereat we are much distressed, since verily deeds done illegally and informally now seem to have some force. Let your holiness however be assured that we shall eagerly join the battle for the Faith, and are willing to fight even unto death. To-day, the 11th of the month Gorpiæum, <a name="fr_2270"></a><a href="#fn_2270"><font size="1">2271</font></a>
  we are expecting our very pious Emperor to cross over to the Rufinianum, <a name="fr_2271"></a><a href="#fn_2271"><font size="1">2272</font></a>
  and there to hear the trial.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.clxiv-p7"></a>We therefore beg your holiness to pray the Lord Christ to help us to be able to confirm the faith of the holy Fathers, and to pluck up by the roots these Chapters which have sprouted to the damage of the Church. We implore your holiness to think and act with us, and to abide in your ready devotion to the orthodox faith. When this letter was written the lord Himerius <a name="fr_2272"></a><a href="#fn_2272"><font size="1">2273</font></a>
  had not yet met us, being peradventure hindered on the road. But do not let this trouble you. Only let your piety strenuously support us, and we trust that gloom will disappear, and the truth shine forth.</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.x.clxiv-p2"></a> Another version of the title runs “To the very holy and wise synod assembled at Ephesus, Joannes, Paulus, Apringius, Theodoretus, greeting.” The letter may be dated in Sept. 431. Paul, bishop of Emesa, was ultimately an active peacemaker in the dispute. Apringius was bishop of Chalcis.</p>
