 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.viii.xxxiv-p1"></a>The postponement of the answer to the question raised.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.viii.xxxiv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.viii.xxxiv-p2.1"></a>Serenus</span>: Although your proposals would rob us of our whole nights rest, so that we should not notice the approach of the rising dawn, and should be tempted greedily to prolong our conference till sunrise, yet since the solving of the question raised, if we began to trace it out, would launch us on a wide and deep sea of questions, which the shortness of the time at our disposal would not permit us to traverse, I think it will be more convenient to reserve it for consideration another night, when by the raising of this question I shall receive from your very ready converse some spiritual joy and richer fruit, and we shall be able if the Holy Spirit grants us a prosperous breeze to penetrate more freely into the intricacies of the questions raised. Wherefore let us enjoy a little sleep, and so shake off the drowsiness that steals over our eyes, as the dawn approaches, and then we will go together to church, for the observance of Sunday bids us do this, and after service will come back, and as you wish, discuss with redoubled delight what the Lord may have given to us for our common improvement.</p>
