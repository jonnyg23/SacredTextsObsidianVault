 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxii-p1"></a>An objection, that abstinence ought to be concealed, but that things that have been declined should not be received.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: In the former instance we think there can be no doubt that it is better for our abstinence to be hidden than for it to be displayed to the inquirers, and in cases of this sort we also admit that a lie is unavoidable. But in the second there is no need for us to tell a lie, first because we can refuse what is offered by the service of a brother in such a way as to bind ourselves in no bond of determination, and next because when we once refuse we can keep our opinion unchanged.</p>
