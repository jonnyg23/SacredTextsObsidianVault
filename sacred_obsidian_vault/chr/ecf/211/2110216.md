 <p> <a name="ii.vi.ii.xxvii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="ii.vi.ii.xxvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXVII.</h4>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.vi.ii.xxvii-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.vi.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></a>Then</span> Herod, a foreigner, the son of Antipater of Askelon, asked and received the sovereignty of Judæa from the senate and people of Rome. Under him, the Jews began for the first time to have a foreigner as king. For as now the advent of Christ was at hand, it was necessary, according to the predictions of the prophets, that they should be deprived of their own rulers, that they might not look for anything beyond Christ. Under this Herod, in the thirty-third year of his reign, <span class="sc"><a name="ii.vi.ii.xxvii-p1.2"></a>Christ</span> was born on the twenty-fifth of December in the consulship of Sabinus and Rufinus. But we do not venture to touch on these things which are contained in the Gospels, and subsequently in the Acts of the Apostles, lest the character of our condensed work should, in any measure, detract from the dignity of the events; and I shall proceed to what remains. Herod reigned four years after the birth of the Lord; for the whole period of his reign comprised thirty-seven years. After him, came Archelaus the tetrarch, for eight years, and Herod for twenty-four years. Under him, in the eighteenth year of his reign, the Lord was crucified, Fufius Geminus and Rubellius Geminus being consuls; from which date up to the consulship of Stilico, there have elapsed three hundred and seventy-two years.</p>
