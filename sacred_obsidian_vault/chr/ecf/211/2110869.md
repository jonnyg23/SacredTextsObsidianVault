 <p> <a name="iv.v.v.ix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.v.v.ix-p0.1"></a>Chapter IX.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.v.ix-p1"></a>How from practical knowledge we must proceed to spiritual.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.v.ix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.v.ix-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> if you are anxious to attain to the light of spiritual knowledge, not wrongly for an idle boast but for the sake of being made better men, you are first inflamed with the longing for that blessedness, of which we read: “blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God,” <a name="fr_1883"></a><a href="#fn_1883"><font size="1">1884</font></a>
  that you may also attain to that of which the angel said to Daniel: “But they that are learned shall shine as the splendor of the firmament: and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever  <a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a> <a name="iv.v.v.ix-Page_439"></a>and ever;” and in another prophet: “Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge while there is time.” <a name="fr_1884"></a><a href="#fn_1884"><font size="1">1885</font></a>
  And so keeping up that diligence in reading, which I see that you have, endeavour with all eagerness to gain in the first place a thorough grasp of practical, i.e., ethical knowledge. For without this that theoretical purity of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only, who are perfected not by the words of others who teach them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after much expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their knowledge not from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing with the Psalmist: “From Thy commandments I have understanding;” and having overcome all their passions, they say with confidence: “I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.” <a name="fr_1885"></a><a href="#fn_1885"><font size="1">1886</font></a>
  For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm, understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart a holy tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge yourselves from the stain of all sins, and rid yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an impossibility for the soul which is taken up even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of knowledge or to become an author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading holy things. Be careful therefore in the first place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather to be careful about what I am going to say—that you may enjoin absolute silence on your lips, in order that your zeal for reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed by vain pride. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them. For from teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of spiritual knowledge will flourish. And so you should never venture to say anything in the conference of the Elders unless some ignorance that might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to know leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory, pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the knowledge which they perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the praise of men, to be rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one who is bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults, and especially to that of pride: and so if he is baffled by his encounter with practical and ethical knowledge, he will certainly not attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be then in all things “swift to hear, but slow to speak,” <a name="fr_1886"></a><a href="#fn_1886"><font size="1">1887</font></a>
  lest there come upon you that which is noted by Solomon: “If thou seest a man who is quick to speak, know that there is more hope of a fool than of him;” <a name="fr_1887"></a><a href="#fn_1887"><font size="1">1888</font></a>
  and do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not already performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we ought to keep to this order, as of Him it is said: “what Jesus began to do and to teach.” <a name="fr_1888"></a><a href="#fn_1888"><font size="1">1889</font></a>
  Take care then that you do not rush into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those of whom the Lord speaks in the gospel to the disciples: “What they say unto you, that observe and do, but not after their words: for they say and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on mens shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.” <a name="fr_1889"></a><a href="#fn_1889"><font size="1">1890</font></a>
  For if he who shall “break one of these commands, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven,” <a name="fr_1890"></a><a href="#fn_1890"><font size="1">1891</font></a>
  it follows that one who has dared to despise many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall certainly be considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest in the punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul on profound and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of mans, nor condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of the illumination of the Holy Ghost.</p>
