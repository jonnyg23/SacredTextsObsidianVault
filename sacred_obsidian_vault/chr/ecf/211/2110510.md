 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxv-p1"></a>The words of Abbot Moses which he said to me about the cure of accidie.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxv-p2.1"></a>When</span> I was beginning my stay in the desert, and had said to Abbot Moses, the chief of all the saints, that I had been terribly troubled yesterday by an attack of accidie, and that I could only be freed from it by running at once to Abbot Paul, he said, “You have not freed yourself from it, but rather have given yourself up to it as its slave and subject. For the enemy will henceforth attack you more strongly as a deserter and runaway, since it has seen that you fled at once when overcome in the conflict: unless on a second occasion when you join battle with it you make up your mind not to dispel its attacks and heats for the moment by deserting your cell, or by the inactivity of sleep, but rather learn to triumph over it by endurance and conflict.” Whence it is proved by experience that a fit of accidie should not be evaded by running away from it, but overcome by resisting it. <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_1002"><font size="1">1003</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxv-p3"></a> This Abbot Moses is probably the one to whom the first two Conferences are attributed (cf. also Conference VII. xxvi.); and possibly the second of this name (Moses the Libyan) mentioned by Sozomen, H. E. VI. xxix. Cf. also Palladius, the Lausiac History. c. xxii.</p>
