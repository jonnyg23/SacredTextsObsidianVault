 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.xviii-p1"></a>An objection that only those men employed lies with impunity, who lived under the law.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.xviii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.xviii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: It is no wonder that these schemes were properly employed in the Old Testament, and that some holy men laudably or at any rate venially told lies, as we see that many worse things were permitted to them owing to the rude character of the times. For why should we wonder that when the blessed David was fleeing from Saul, in answer to the inquiry of Abimelech the priest who said: “Why art thou alone, and is no man with thee?” he replied as follows: “The king hath commanded me a business, and said, Let no man know the thing for which thou art sent by me, for I have appointed my servants to such and such a place;” and again: “Hast thou here at hand a spear or a sword, for I brought not my own sword nor my own weapon with me, for the kings business required haste;” or this, when he was brought to Achish king of Gath, and feigned himself mad and frantic, “and changed his countenance before them, and slipped down between their hands; and stumbled against the doors of the gate and his spittle ran down on his beard;” <a name="fr_2022"></a><a href="#fn_2022"><font size="1">2023</font></a>
  when they were even allowed to enjoy crowds of wives and concubines, and no sin was on this account imputed to them, and when moreover they often shed the blood of their enemies with their own hand, and this was thought not only worthy of no blame, but actually praiseworthy? And all these things  <a name="page_466"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 466</font></a> <a name="iv.v.viii.xviii-Page_466"></a>we see by the light of the gospel are utterly forbidden, so that not one of them can be done without great sin and guilt. And in the same way we hold that no lie can be employed by any one, I will not say rightly, but not even venially, however it may be covered with the colour of piety, as the Lord says: “Let your speech be yea, yea, nay, nay: but whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one;” and the Apostle also agrees with this: “And lie not one to another.” <a name="fr_2023"></a><a href="#fn_2023"><font size="1">2024</font></a>
