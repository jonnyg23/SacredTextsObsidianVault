 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p1"></a>Of the solution of a question which Abbot Theodore obtained by prayer.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p2.1"></a>We</span> knew also Abbot Theodore, <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">869</font></a>
  a man gifted with the utmost holiness and with perfect knowledge not only in practical life, but also in understanding the Scriptures, which he had not acquired so much by study and reading, or worldly education, as by purity of heart alone: since he could with difficulty understand and speak but a very few words of the Greek language. This man when he was seeking an explanation of some most difficult question, continued without ceasing for seven days and nights in prayer until he discovered by a revelation from the Lord the solution of the question propounded.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxiii-p3"></a> Nothing further is known for certain of this Theodore. He may be the author of the VIth of the Conferences; but must be carefully distinguished from his more celebrated namesake, the friend of Pachomius, and third Abbot of Tabenna, who died before Cassians visit to Egypt.</p>
