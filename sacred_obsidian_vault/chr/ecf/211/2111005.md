 <p> <a name="iv.vi.v.v"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.v.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.v.v-p1"></a>How those who live under the grace of the Gospel ought to go beyond the requirement of the law.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.v.v-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.v.v-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> we ought to know that we from whom the requirements of the law are no longer exacted, but in whose ears the word of the gospel daily sounds: “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me,” <a name="fr_2168"></a><a href="#fn_2168"><font size="1">2169</font></a>
  when we offer to God tithes of our substance, are still in a way ground down beneath the burden of the law, and not able to rise to those heights of the gospel, those who conform to which are recompensed not only by blessings in this present life, but also by future rewards. For the law promises to those who obey it no rewards of the kingdom of heaven, but only solaces in this life, saying: “The man that doeth these things shall live in them.” <a name="fr_2169"></a><a href="#fn_2169"><font size="1">2170</font></a>
  But the Lord says to His disciples: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;” and: “Everyone that leaveth house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or field for My names sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.” <a name="fr_2170"></a><a href="#fn_2170"><font size="1">2171</font></a>
  And this with good reason. For it is not so praiseworthy for us to abstain from forbidden as from lawful things, and not to use these last out of reverence for Him, Who has permitted us to use them because of our weakness. And so if even those who, faithfully offering tithes of their fruits, are obedient to the more ancient precepts of the Lord, cannot yet climb the heights of the gospel, you can see very clearly how far short of it those fall who do not even do this. For how can those men be partakers of the grace of the gospel who disregard the  <a name="page_505"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 505</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.v.v-Page_505"></a>fulfilment even of the lighter commands of the law, to the easy character of which the weighty words of the giver of the law bear testimony, as a curse is actually invoked on those who do not fulfil them; for it says: “Cursed is everyone that does not continue in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.” <a name="fr_2171"></a><a href="#fn_2171"><font size="1">2172</font></a>
  But here on account of the superiority and excellence of the commandments it is said: “He that can receive it, let him receive it.” <a name="fr_2172"></a><a href="#fn_2172"><font size="1">2173</font></a>
  There the forcible compulsion of the lawgiver shows the easy character of the precepts; for he says: “I call heaven and earth to record against you this day, that if ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord your God ye shall perish from off the face of the earth.” <a name="fr_2173"></a><a href="#fn_2173"><font size="1">2174</font></a>
  Here the grandeur of sublime commands is shown by the very fact that He does not <i>order</i>, but <i>exhorts</i>, saying: “if thou wilt be perfect go” and do this or that. There Moses lays a burden that cannot be refused on those who are unwilling: here Paul meets with counsels those who are willing and eager for perfection. For that was not to be enjoined as a general charge, nor to be required, if I may so say, as a regular rule from all, which could not be secured by all, owing to its wonderful and lofty nature; but by counsels all are rather stimulated to grace, that those who are great may deservedly be crowned by the perfection of their virtues, while those who are small, and not able to come up to “the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,” <a name="fr_2174"></a><a href="#fn_2174"><font size="1">2175</font></a>
  although they seem to be lost to sight and hidden as it were by the brightness of larger stars, may yet be free from the darkness of the curses which are in the law, and not adjudged to suffer present evils or visited with eternal punishment. Christ therefore does not constrain anyone, by the compulsion of a command, to those lofty heights of goodness, but stimulates them by the power of free will, and urges them on by wise counsels and the desire of perfection. For where there is a command, there is duty, and consequently punishment. But those who keep those things to which they are driven by the severity of the law established escape the punishment with which they were threatened, instead of obtaining rewards and a recompense.</p>
