 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.iv.i.viii-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.i.viii-p1.1"></a>Accordingly</span>, setting out from that place, I made for the town of Bethlehem, which is six miles distant from Jerusalem, but requires sixteen stoppages <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">95</font></a>
  on the part of one journeying from Alexandria. The presbyter Jerome <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">96</font></a>
  rules the church of this place; for it is a parish of the bishop who has possession of Jerusalem. Having already in my former journey become acquainted with Hieronymus, he had easily brought it about that I with good reason deemed no one more worthy of my regard and love. For, besides the merit due to him on account of his Faith, and the possession of many virtues, he is a man learned not only in Latin and Greek, but also Hebrew, to such a degree that no one dare venture to compare himself with him in all knowledge. I shall indeed be surprised if he is not well known to you also through means of the works which he has written, since he is, in fact, read the whole world over.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.viii-p4"></a>“Well,” says the Gaul at this point, “he is, in truth, but too well known to us. For, some five years ago, I read a certain book of his, in which the whole tribe of our monks is most vehemently assaulted and reviled by him. For this reason, our Belgian friend is accustomed to be very angry, because he has said that we are in the habit of cramming ourselves even to repletion. But I, for my part, pardon the eminent man; and am of opinion that he had made the remark rather about Eastern than Western monks. For <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.i.viii-Page_28"></a>the love of eating is gluttony in the case of the Greeks, whereas among the Gauls it is owing to the nature they possess.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.viii-p5"></a>Then exclaimed I, “You defend your nation, my Gallic friend, by means of rhetoric; but I beg to ask whether that book condemns only this vice in the case of the monks?”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.viii-p6"></a>“No indeed,” replies he; “the writer passed nothing over, which he did not blame, scourge, and expose: in particular, he inveighed against avarice and no less against arrogance. He discoursed much respecting pride, and not a little about superstition; and I will freely own that he seemed to me to draw a true picture of the vices of multitudes.”</p>
