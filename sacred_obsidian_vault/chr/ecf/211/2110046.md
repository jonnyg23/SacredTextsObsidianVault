 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.iv.i.ix-p1"></a>“<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.i.ix-p1.1"></a>But</span> as to familiarities which take place between virgins and monks, or even clerics, how true and how courageous were his words! And, on account of these, he is said not to stand high in favor with certain people whom I am unwilling to name. For, as our Belgian friend is angry that we were accused of too great fondness for eating, so those people, again, are said to express their rage when they find it written in that little work,—The virgin despises her true unmarried brother, and seeks a stranger.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.ix-p2"></a>Upon this I exclaim, “You are going too far, my Gallic friend: take heed lest some one who perhaps owns to these things, hear what you are saying, and begin to hold you, along with Hieronymus, in no great affection. For, since you are a learned <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">97</font></a>
  man, not unreasonably will I admonish you in the verse of that comic poet who says,—Submission procures friends, while truth gives rise to hatred. Let rather, Postumianus, your discourse to us about the East, so well begun, now be resumed.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.ix-p4"></a>“Well,” says he, “as I had commenced to relate, I stayed with Hieronymus six months, who carried on an unceasing warfare against the wicked, and a perpetual struggle in opposition to the deadly hatred of ungodly men. The heretics hate him, because he never desists from attacking them; the clerics hate him, because he assails their life and crimes. But beyond doubt, all the good admire and love him; for those people are out of their senses, who suppose that he is a heretic. Let me tell the truth on this point, which is that the knowledge of the man is Catholic, and that his doctrine is sound. He is always occupied in reading, always at his books with his whole heart: he takes no rest day or night; he is perpetually either reading or writing something. In fact, had I not been resolved in mind, and had promised to God first to visit <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">98</font></a>
  the desert previously referred to, I should have grudged to depart even for the shortest time from so great a man. Handing over, then, and entrusting to him all my possessions and my whole family, which having followed me against my own inclination, kept me in a state of embarrassment, and thus being in a sort of way delivered from a heavy burden, and restored to freedom of action, I returned to Alexandria, and having visited the brethren there I set out from the place for upper Thebais, that is for the farthest off confines of Egypt. For a great multitude of monks were said to inhabit the widely extending solitudes of that wilderness. But here it would be tedious, were I to seek to narrate all the things which I witnessed: I shall only touch lightly on a few points.</p>
