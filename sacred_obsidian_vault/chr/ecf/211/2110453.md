 <p> <a name="iv.iii.viii.v"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.viii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.viii.v-p1"></a>How calm a monk ought to be.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.viii.v-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.viii.v-p2.1"></a>And</span> so a monk aiming at perfection, and desiring to strive lawfully in his spiritual combat, should be free from all sin of anger and wrath, and should listen to the charge which the “chosen vessel” gives him. “Let all anger,” says he, “and wrath, and clamour, and evil speaking, be taken away from among you, with all malice.” <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">927</font></a>
  When he says, “Let all anger be taken away from you,” he excepts none whatever as necessary or useful for us. And if need be, he should at once treat an erring brother in such a way that, while he manages to apply a remedy to one afflicted with perhaps a slight fever, he may not by his wrath involve himself in a more dangerous malady of blindness. For he who wants to heal anothers wound ought to be in good health and free from every affection of weakness himself, lest that saying of the gospel should be used to him, “Physician, first heal thyself;” <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">928</font></a>
  and lest, seeing a mote in his brothers eye, he see not the beam in his own eye, for how will he see to cast out the mote from his brothers eye, who has the beam of anger in his own eye? <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">929</font></a>
