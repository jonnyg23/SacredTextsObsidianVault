 <p> <a name="ii.v.i.vi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="ii.v.i.vi-p0.1"></a>Chapter VI.</h4>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.v.i.vi-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.i.vi-p1.1"></a>After</span> these, and several others who have discharged for us the duties of instruction, the Son of God himself will speak thus: “I, certainly, exalted on a lofty seat, holding heaven in my hand, and the earth in my fist, extended within and without, in the inside of all things which are produced, and on the outside of all <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">157</font></a>
  things that move, inconceivable, infinite in the power <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">158</font></a>
  of nature, invisible to sight, inaccessible to touch, in order that I might exist as the least of you (for the purpose of subduing the hardness of your heart and for softening your faithlessness by sound doctrines), condescended to be born in flesh, and, having laid aside the glory of God, I assumed the form of a servant, so that, sharing with you in bodily infirmity, I might in turn bring you to a participation in my glory, through obedience to the precept of salvation. I restored health to the sick and infirm, hearing to the deaf, sight to the blind, the power of speech to the dumb, and the use of their feet to the lame; that I might influence you, by heavenly signs, all the more easily to believe in me, and in those things which I had announced, I promised you the kingdom of heaven; I also, in order that you might have an example of escape from punishment, placed in Paradise the robber who acknowledged me almost at the moment of his death, that ye might follow even the faith of him who had been thought worthy of having his sins forgiven him. And that by my example in your behalf, ye yourselves also might be able to suffer; I suffered for you, that no man might hesitate to suffer for himself what God <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">159</font></a>
  had endured for man. I showed myself after my resurrection, in order that your faith might not be overthrown. I admonished the Jews in the person of Peter; I preached to the Gentiles in the person of Paul; and I do not regret doing so, for good results followed. The good have understood my work; the faithful have perfected it; the righteous have completed it; the merciful have consummated it: there have been a large number of martyrs, and a large number of saints. Those to whom I thus refer were undoubtedly in the same body and in the same world as you. Why, then, do I find no good work in you, ye descendants of vipers? Ye have shown no repentance for your wicked deeds, even at the very end of your earthly course. And what does it profit that ye honor me with your lips, when you deny me by your deeds and works? Where are now your riches, where your honors, where your powers, and where your pleasures? I pronounce no new sentence over you: you simply incur the judgment which I formerly predicted.”</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.i.vi-p4"></a> Clericus thinks this expression unscriptural, and fitted to support heresy. But it may be justified by such a passage as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028">Acts xx. 28</a><a name="ii.v.i.vi-p4.1"></a>, if <span class="Greek"><a name="ii.v.i.vi-p4.2"></a>θεοῦ</span> can be accepted as the correct reading, which is now generally agreed upon.</p>
