 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.v.vi-p1"></a>How the grace of the gospel supports the weak so that they can obtain pardon, as it secures to the perfect the kingdom of God.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.v.vi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.v.vi-p2.1"></a>And</span> as the word of the gospel raises those that are strong to sublime and lofty heights, so it suffers not the weak to be dragged down to the depths, for it secures to the perfect the fulness of blessing, and brings to those who are overcome through weakness pardon. For the law placed those who fulfilled its commands in a sort of middle state between what they deserved in either case, severing them from the condemnation due to transgressors, as it also kept them away from the glory of the perfect. But how wretched and miserable this is, you can see from comparing the state of this present life, in which it is considered a very poor thing for a man to sweat and labour only to avoid being regarded as guilty among good men, not also to be esteemed rich and honourable and renowned.</p>
