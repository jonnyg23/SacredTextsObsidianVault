 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.v.xviii-p1"></a>How fasting is not always suitable.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.v.xviii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.v.xviii-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> as we have premised this on the conditions of fasting, it seems well to subjoin the authority of Holy Scripture, by which it will be more clearly proved that fasting neither can nor should be always observed. In the Gospel when the Pharisees were fasting together with the disciples of John the Baptist, as the Apostles, as friends and companions of the heavenly Bridegroom, were not yet keeping the observance of a fast, the disciples of John (who thought that they acquired perfect righteousness by their fasts, as they were followers of that grand preacher of repentance who afforded a pattern to all the people by his own example, as he not only refused the differ<a name="page_511"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 511</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.v.xviii-Page_511"></a>ent kinds of food which are supplied for mans use, but actually altogether did without eating the bread which is common to all) complained to the Lord and said: “Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not?” to whom the Lord in His reply plainly showed that fasting is not suitable or necessary at all times, when any festival season or opportunity for love intervenes and permits an indulgence in food, saying: “Can the children of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then shall they fast;” <a name="fr_2191"></a><a href="#fn_2191"><font size="1">2192</font></a>
  words which although they were spoken before the resurrection of His Body, yet specially point to the season of Eastertide, in which after His resurrection for forty days He ate with His disciples, and their joy in His daily Presence did not allow them to fast.</p>
