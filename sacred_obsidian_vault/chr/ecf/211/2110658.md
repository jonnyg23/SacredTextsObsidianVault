 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.v.xvii-p1"></a>Of the lukewarmness of eunuchs.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.v.xvii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.v.xvii-p2.1"></a>Lastly</span>, on this account in those who are Eunuchs, we often detect the existence of this lukewarmness of mind, because, as they are so to speak free from the needs of the flesh, they fancy that they have no need either of the trouble of bodily abstinence, or of contrition of heart; and being rendered slack by this freedom from anxiety, they make no efforts either truly to seek or to acquire perfection of heart or even purity from spiritual faults. And this condition which is the result of their state in the flesh, becomes natural, which is altogether a worse state. For he who passes from the state of coldness to that of lukewarmness is branded by the Lords words as still more hateful.</p>
