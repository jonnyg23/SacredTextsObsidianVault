 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.vi.i.iv-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.vi.i.iv-p1.1"></a>Then</span> Noah first of all erected an altar to God, and offered sacrifices from among the birds. <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">252</font></a>

But by the ordination of God, in order that the labors of those engaged in the work might be hindered, they began to speak in a kind of languages very different from their accustomed form of speech, while no one understood the others. This led to their being all the more readily dispersed, because, regarding each other as foreigners, they were easily induced to separate.
