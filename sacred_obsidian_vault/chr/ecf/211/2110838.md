 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.ii.xiv-p1"></a>A question about complete chastity.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.ii.xiv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.ii.xiv-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: Now that you have finished your discourse on perfect chastity, we want also to ask somewhat more freely about the end of chastity. For we do not doubt that those lofty heights of love, by which, as you have hitherto explained, we mount to the image and likeness of God, cannot possibly exist without perfect purity. But we should like to know whether a lasting grant of it can be secured so that no incitement to lust may ever disturb the serenity of our heart, and that thus we may be enabled to pass the time of our sojourneying in the flesh free from this carnal passion, so as never to be inflamed by the fire of excitement.</p>
