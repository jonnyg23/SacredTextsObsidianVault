 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vi.iv-p1"></a>Of the miracle which Abbot Abraham wrought on the breasts of a woman.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vi.iv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vi.iv-p2.1"></a>Why</span> also need I mention the acts of Abbot Abraham, <a name="fr_1948"></a><a href="#fn_1948"><font size="1">1949</font></a>
  who was surnamed <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.vi.iv-p3.1"></a>ἁ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.vi.iv-p3.2"></a>πλοῦς</span>, i.e., the simple, from the simplicity of his life and his innocence. This man when he had gone from the desert to Egypt for the harvest in the season of Quinquagesima <a name="fr_1949"></a><a href="#fn_1949"><font size="1">1950</font></a>
  was pestered with tears and prayers by a woman who brought her little child, already pining away and half dead from lack of milk; he gave her a cup of water to drink signed with the sign of the cross; and when she had drunk it at once most marvellously her breasts that had been till then utterly dry flowed with a copious abundance of milk.</p>
