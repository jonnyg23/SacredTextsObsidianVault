 <p> <a name="iv.v.vii.xvii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.v.vii.xvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XVII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.xvii-p1"></a>Of those who hold that patience should be shown to worldly people rather than to the brethren.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.xvii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.xvii-p2.1"></a>This</span> too should be bitterly lamented; namely, that some of the brethren, when angered by some reproachful words, if they are besieged by the prayers of some one else who wants to smooth them down, when they hear that vexation ought not to be admitted or retained against a brother, according to what is written: “Whoever is angry with his brother is in danger of the judgment;” and: “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,” <a name="fr_1989"></a><a href="#fn_1989"><font size="1">1990</font></a>
  instantly assert that if a heathen or one living in the world had said or done this, it rightly ought to be endured. But who could stand a brother who was accessory to so great a fault, or gave utterance to so insolent a reproach with his lips! As if patience were to be shown only to unbelievers and blasphemers, and not to all in general, or as if anger should be reckoned as bad when it is against  <a name="page_456"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 456</font></a> <a name="iv.v.vii.xvii-Page_456"></a>a heathen, but good when it is against a brother; whereas certainly the obstinate rage of an angry soul brings about the same injury to ones self whoever may be the subject against whom it is aroused. But how terribly obstinate, aye and senseless is it for them, owing to the stupidity of their dull mind, not to be able to discern the meaning of these words, for it is not said: “Every one who is angry with a stranger shall be in danger of the judgment,” which might perhaps according to their interpretation except those who are partners of our faith and life, but the word of the Gospel most significantly expresses it by saying: “Every one who is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment.” And so though we ought according to the rule of truth to regard every man as a brother, yet in this passage one of the faithful and a partaker of our mode of life is denoted by the title of brother rather than a heathen.</p>
