But to yield to your wishes, as perhaps you fancy that I have no other proofs to use, hear the perfect mystery of mans salvation and eternal bliss, which Martha proclaims in the gospel. For what does she say? “Of a truth, Lord, I have believed that Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.” <a name="fr_2439"></a><a href="#fn_2439"><font size="1">2440</font></a>
  Learn the true faith from a woman. Learn the confession of eternal hope. Yet you have a splendid consolation: you need not blush to be taught the mystery of salvation by her, whose testimony God did not refuse to accept.</p>
