 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.ii.v-p1"></a>Of our answer to his excuse.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.ii.v-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.ii.v-p2.1"></a>At</span> this we were overwhelmed with no slight confusion and replied as follows: Although both the difficulty of the place and the solitary life itself, which even a robust youth could scarcely put up with, ought to be sufficient to teach us everything (and indeed without your saying anything they <i>do</i> teach and impress us a very great deal) yet still we ask you to lay aside your silence for a little and in a more worthy manner implant in us those principles by which we may be able to embrace, not so much by imitating it as by admiring it, that goodness which we see in you. For even if our coldness is known to you, and does not deserve to obtain what we are asking for, yet at least the trouble of so long a journey ought to be repaid by it, as we made haste to come here after our first beginning in the monastery of Bethlehem, owing to a longing for your instruction, and a yearning for our own good.</p>
