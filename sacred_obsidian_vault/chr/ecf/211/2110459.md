 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xi-p1"></a>Of those to whose wrath even the going down of the sun sets no limit.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xi-p2.1"></a>But</span> what am I to say of those (and I cannot say it without shame on my own part) to whose implacability even the going down of the sun sets no bound: but prolonging it for several days, and nourishing rancorous feelings against those against whom they have been excited, they say in words that they are not angry, but in fact and deed they show that <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.viii.xi-Page_261"></a>they are extremely disturbed? For they do not speak to them pleasantly, nor address them with ordinary civility, and they think that they are not doing wrong in this, because they do not seek to avenge themselves for their upset. But since they either do not dare, or at any rate are not able to show their anger openly, and give place to it, they drive in, to their own detriment, the poison of anger, and secretly cherish it in their hearts, and silently feed on it in themselves; without shaking off by an effort of mind their sulky disposition, but digesting it as the days go by, and somewhat mitigating it after a while.</p>
