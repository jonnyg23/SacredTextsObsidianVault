 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.xx-p1"></a>Of the feigned patience of some who offer the other cheek to be smitten.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.xx-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.xx-p2.1"></a>We</span> are not ignorant also of another kind of insanity, which we find in some of the brethren under colour of a counterfeit patience, as in this case it is not enough to have stirred up quarrels unless they incite them with irritating words so as to get themselves smitten, and when they have been touched by the slightest blow, at once they offer another part of their body to be smitten, as if in this way they could fulfil to perfection that command which says: “If a man smite thee on the right cheek, offer him the other also;” <a name="fr_1996"></a><a href="#fn_1996"><font size="1">1997</font></a>
  while they totally ignore the meaning and purpose of the passage. For they fancy that they are practising evangelical patience through the sin of anger, for the utter eradication of which not only was the exchange of retaliation and the irritation of strife forbidden, but the command was actually given us to mitigate the wrath of the striker by the endurance of a double wrong.</p>
