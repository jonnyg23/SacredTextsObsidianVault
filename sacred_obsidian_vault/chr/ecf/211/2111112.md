 <p> <a name="iv.vii.iv.viii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.iv.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.iv.viii-p1"></a>When confessing the Divinity of Christ we ought not to pass over in silence the confession of the cross.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.iv.viii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.iv.viii-p2.1"></a>But</span> let us see what else follows. In writing to the church of Corinth, he whom we spoke of above, the instructor of all the churches viz. Paul, speaks thus: “The Jews,” says he, “seek signs, and the Greeks ask for wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, to the Gentiles foolishness: but to them that are saved, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.” <a name="fr_2436"></a><a href="#fn_2436"><font size="1">2437</font></a>
  O most powerful teacher of the faith, who even in this passage, when teaching the Church thought it not enough to speak of Christ as God without adding that He was crucified on purpose that for the sake of the open and solid teaching of the faith he might proclaim Him, whom he called the crucified, to be the wisdom of God. He then employed no subtilty or circumlocution, nor did he when he preached the gospel of the Lord blush at the mention of the cross of Christ. And though it was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles to hear of God as born, God in bodily form, God suffering, God crucified, yet he did not weaken the force of his pious utterance because of the wickedness of the offence of the Jews: nor did he lessen the vigour of his faith because of the unbelief and the foolishness of others: but openly, persistently, and boldly proclaimed that He, whom a mother <a name="fr_2437"></a><a href="#fn_2437"><font size="1">2438</font></a>
  had borne, whom men had slain, the spear had pierced, the cross had stretched—was “the power and wisdom of God, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Gentiles foolishness.” But still that which was to some a stumbling-block and foolishness, was to others the power and wisdom of God. For as the persons differed, so was there a difference of their thoughts: and what a man who was void of sound understanding, and incapable of true good, foolishly denied in unbelief, that a wise faith could feel in its inmost soul to be holy and life giving.</p>
