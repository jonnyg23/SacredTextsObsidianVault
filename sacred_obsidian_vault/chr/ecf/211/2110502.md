 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.x.xvii-p1"></a>Different passages in which the Apostle declares that we ought to work, or in which it is shown that he himself worked.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.x.xvii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.x.xvii-p2.1"></a>In</span> the Epistle to the Ephesians also he thus gives a charge on this subject of work, saying: “He that stole, let him now steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.” <a name="fr_979"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">980</font></a>
  And in the Acts of the Apostles too we find that he not only taught this, but actually practised it himself. For when he had come to Corinth, he did not permit himself to lodge anywhere except with Aquila and Priscilla, because they were of the same trade which he himself was accustomed to practise. For we thus read: “After this, Paul departing from Athens came to Corinth; and finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, and Priscilla his wife, he came to them because they were of the same trade; and abode with them, and worked: for they were tent-makers by trade.” <a name="fr_980"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">981</font></a>
