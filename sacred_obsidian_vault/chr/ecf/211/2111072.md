 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xii-p1"></a>Of the value of work and the harm of idleness.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xii-p2.1"></a>And</span> so though we also might have the protection of our kinsfolk, yet we have preferred his abstinence to all riches, and have chosen to procure our daily bodily sustenance by our own exertions rather than rely on the sure provision made by our relations, having less inclination for idle meditation on holy Scripture of which you have spoken, and that fruitless attendance to reading than to this laborious poverty. And certainly we should most gladly pursue the former, if the authority of the apostles had taught us by their examples that it was better for us, or the rules of the Elders had laid it down for our good. But you must know that you are affected by this no less than by that harm of which I spoke above, because though your body may be sound and lusty, yet you are supported by anothers contributions, a thing which properly belongs only to the feeble. For certainly the whole human race, except only that class of monks, who live in accordance with the Apostles command by the daily labours of their own hands, looks for the charity of anothers compassion. Wherefore it is clear that not only those who boast that they themselves are supported either by the wealth of their relations or the labours of their servants or the produce of their farms, but also the kings of this world are supported by charity. This at any rate is embraced in the definition of our predecessors, who have laid down that anything that is taken for the requirements of daily food which has not been procured and prepared by the labour of our own hands, ought to be referred to charity, as the Apostle teaches, who altogether forbids the help of anothers bounty to the idle and says: “If a man does not work, neither let him eat.” <a name="fr_2310"></a><a href="#fn_2310"><font size="1">2311</font></a>
