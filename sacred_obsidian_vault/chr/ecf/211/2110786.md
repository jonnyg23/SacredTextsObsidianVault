 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.x.xvi-p1"></a>Of the kinds of prayer to which we ought to direct ourselves.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.x.xvi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.x.xvi-p2.1"></a>Yet</span> we ought by advancing in life and attaining to virtue to aim rather at those kinds of prayer which are poured forth either from the contemplation of the good things to come or from fervour of love, or which at least, to speak more humbly and in accordance with the measure of beginners, arise for the acquirement of some virtue or the extinction of some fault. For otherwise we shall not possibly attain to those sublimer kinds of supplication of which we spoke, unless our mind has been little by little and by degrees raised through the regular course of those intercessions.</p>
