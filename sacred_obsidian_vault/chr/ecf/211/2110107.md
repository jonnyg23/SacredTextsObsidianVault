 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.v.i.vii-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.i.vii-p1.1"></a>Then</span> will the Evangelist repeat this to the wretched beings, “Go ye <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">160</font></a>
  into outer darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” O ye miserable men, whom these words do not now impress! They shall then see their own punishment, and the glory of others. Let them use this present world, provided they do not enjoy that eternity which is prepared for the saints. Let them abound in riches: let them rest on gold; provided that there they be found needy and destitute. Let them be wealthy in this world, provided they be poor in eternity, for it is written regarding them, “The rich were in <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">161</font></a>
  want, and suffered hunger.” But the Scripture has added what follows respecting the good,—“but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.v.i.vii-p4"></a>Therefore, my sister, although those people mock at us, and although they call us foolish and unhappy, let us all the more joyfully exult in such reproaches, by which glory is heaped up for us, and punishment for them. And do not let us laugh at their folly, but rather grieve over their unhappiness; because there is among them a large number of our own people, whom if we win over, our glory shall be increased. But however they may conduct themselves, let  <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a> <a name="ii.v.i.vii-Page_58"></a>them be to us as Gentiles and publicans; but let us keep ourselves safe and sound. If they rejoice now over us lamenting, it will be our turn afterwards to rejoice over their suffering. Farewell, dearest sister, and tenderly beloved in Christ.</p>
