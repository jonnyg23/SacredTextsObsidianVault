 <p> <a name="iv.iv.ii.x"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.ii.x-p0.1"></a>Chapter X.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.ii.x-p1"></a>The answer that not the reward, but the doing of them will come to an end.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ii.x-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii.x-p2.1"></a>Moses</span>. I did not say that the reward for a good work would be taken away, as the Lord Himself says: “Whosoever shall give to one of the least of these, a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward:” <a name="fr_1092"></a><a href="#fn_1092"><font size="1">1093</font></a>
  but I maintain that the doing of a thing, which either bodily necessity, or the onslaught of the flesh, or the inequalities of this world, compel to be done, will be taken away. For diligence in reading, and self-denial in fasting, are usefully practised for purifying the heart and chastening the flesh in this life only, as long as “the flesh lusteth against the spirit,” <a name="fr_1093"></a><a href="#fn_1093"><font size="1">1094</font></a>
  and sometimes we see that even in this life they are taken away from those men who are worn out with excessive toil, or bodily infirmity or old age, and cannot be practised by them. How much more then will they come to an end hereafter, when “this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,” <a name="fr_1094"></a><a href="#fn_1094"><font size="1">1095</font></a>
  and the body which is now “a natural body” shall have risen “a spiritual body” <a name="fr_1095"></a><a href="#fn_1095"><font size="1">1096</font></a>
  and the flesh shall have begun to be such that it no longer lusts against the spirit? And of this the blessed Apostle also clearly speaks, when he says that “bodily exercise is profitable for a little: but godliness” (by which he certainly means love) “is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.” <a name="fr_1096"></a><a href="#fn_1096"><font size="1">1097</font></a>
  This clearly shows that what is said to be useful for a little, is not to be practised for all time, and cannot possibly by itself alone confer the highest state of perfection on the man who slaves at it. For the term “for a little” may mean either of the two things, i.e., it may refer to the shortness of the time, because bodily exercise cannot possibly last on with man both in this life and in the world to come: or it may refer to the smallness of the profit which results from exercising the flesh, because bodily austerities produce some sort of beginnings of progress, but not the actual perfection of love, which has the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come: and therefore we deem that the practice of the aforesaid works is needful, because without them we cannot climb the heights of love. For what you call works of religion and mercy are needful in this life while these inequalities and differences of conditions still prevail; but even here we should not look for them to be performed, unless such a large proportion of poor, needy, and sick folk abounded, which is brought about by the wickedness of men; viz., of those who have grasped and kept for their own use (without however using them) those things which were granted to all by the Creator of all alike. As long then as this inequality lasts in this world, this sort of work will be needful and useful to the man that practises it, as it brings to a good purpose and pious will the reward of an eternal inheritance: but it will come to an end in the life to come, where equality will reign, when there will be no longer inequality, on account of which these things must be done, but all men will pass from these manifold practical works to the love of God, and contemplation of heavenly things in continual purity of heart: to which those men who are urgent in devoting themselves to knowledge and purifying the heart, have chosen to give themselves up with all their might and main, betaking themselves, while they are still in the flesh, to that duty, in which they are to continue, when they have laid aside corruption, and when they come to that promise of the Lord the Saviour, which says “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” <a name="fr_1097"></a><a href="#fn_1097"><font size="1">1098</font></a>
