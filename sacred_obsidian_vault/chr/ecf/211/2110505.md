 <p> <a name="iv.iii.x.xx"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.x.xx-p0.1"></a>Chapter XX.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.x.xx-p1"></a>Of a lazy brother who tried to persuade others to leave the monastery.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.x.xx-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.x.xx-p2.1"></a>We</span> know a brother, whose name we would give if it would do any good, who, although he was remaining in the monastery and compelled to deliver to the steward his fixed task daily, yet for fear lest he might be led on to some larger portion of work, or put to shame by the example of one labouring more zealously, when he had seen some brother admitted into the monastery, who in the ardour of his faith wanted to make up the sale of a larger piece of work, if he found that he could not by secret persuasion check him from carrying out his purpose, he would by bad advice and whisperings persuade him to depart thence. And in order to get rid of him more easily he would pretend that he also had already been for many reasons offended, and wanted to leave, if only he could find a companion and support for the journey. And when by secretly running down the monastery he had wheedled him into consenting, and arranged with him the time at which to leave the monastery, and the place to which he should go before, and where he should wait for him, he himself, pretending that he would follow, stopped where he was. And when the other out of shame for his flight did not dare to return again to the monastery from which he had run away, the miserable author of his flight stopped behind in the monastery. It will be enough to have given this single instance of this sort of men in order to put beginners on their guard, and to show clearly what evils idleness, as Scripture says, <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">983</font></a>
  can produce in the mind of a monk, and how “evil communications corrupt good manners.” <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">984</font></a>
