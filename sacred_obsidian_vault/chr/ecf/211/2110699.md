 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.vii.viii-p1"></a>The answer to the foregoing question.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2.1"></a>Theodore</span>: We are talking about the actual qualities of things good and bad, and what we call indifferent; and not about the characters of the men who do these things. Nor ought any bad or wicked man to go unpunished because his evil deed was not able to do harm to a good man. For the endurance and goodness of a righteous man are of no profit to the man who is the cause of his death or suffering, but only to him who patiently endures what is inflicted on him. And so the one is justly punished for savage cruelty, because he meant to injure him, while the other nevertheless suffers no evil, because in the goodness of his heart he patiently endures his temptation and sufferings, and so causes all those things, which were inflicted upon him with evil intent, to turn out to his advantage, and to conduce to the bliss of eternal life.</p>
