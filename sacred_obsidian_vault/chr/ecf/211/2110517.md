 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xi.vi-p1"></a>That vainglory is not altogether got rid of by the advantages of solitude.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xi.vi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xi.vi-p2.1"></a>In</span> solitude also it does not cease from pursuing him who has for the sake of glory fled from intercourse with all men. And the more thoroughly a man has shunned the whole world, so much the more keenly does it pursue him. It tries to lift up with pride one man because of his great endurance of work and labour, another because of his extreme readiness to obey, another because he outstrips other men in humility. One man is tempted through the extent of his knowledge, another through the extent of his reading, another through the length of his vigils. Nor does this malady endeavour to wound a man except through his virtues; introducing hindrances which lead to death by means of those very things through which the supplies of life are sought. For when men are anxious to walk in the path of holiness and perfection, the enemies do not lay their snares to deceive them anywhere except in the way along which they walk, in accordance with that saying of the blessed David: “In the way wherein I walked have they laid a snare for me;” <a name="fr_1006"></a><a href="#fn_1006"><font size="1">1007</font></a>
  that in this very way of virtue along which we are walking, when pressing on to “the prize of our high calling,” <a name="fr_1007"></a><a href="#fn_1007"><font size="1">1008</font></a>
  we may be elated by our successes, and so sink down, and fall with the feet of our soul entangled and caught in the snares of vainglory. And so it results that those of us who could not be vanquished in the conflict with the foe are overcome by the very greatness of our triumph, or else (which is another kind of deception) that, overstraining the limits of that self-restraint which is possible to us, we fail of perseverance in our course on account of bodily weakness.</p>
