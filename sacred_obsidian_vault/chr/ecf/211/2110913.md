 <p> <a name="iv.v.vii.xxii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxii-p1"></a>The answer that Christ looks not only at the action but also at the will.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxii-p2.1"></a>Joseph</span>: As was said a little before, we must look not only at the thing which is done, but also at the character of the mind and the purpose of the doer. And therefore if you weigh with a careful scrutiny of heart what is done by each man and consider with what mind it is done or from what feeling it proceeds, you will see that the virtue of patience and gentleness cannot possibly be fulfilled in the opposite spirit, i.e., that of impatience and rage. Since our Lord and Saviour, when giving us a thorough lesson on the virtue of patience and gentleness (i.e., teaching us not only to profess it with our lips, but to store it up in the inmost recesses of the soul) gave us this summary of evangelical perfection, saying: “If any one smites thee on thy right cheek, offer him the other also” <a name="fr_1997"></a><a href="#fn_1997"><font size="1">1998</font></a>
  (doubtless the “<i>right</i>” cheek is mentioned, as another “right” cheek cannot be found except in the face of the inner man, so to speak), as by this He desires entirely to remove all incitement to anger from the deepest recesses of the soul, i.e., that if your external right cheek has received a blow from the striker, the inner man also humbly consenting may offer its right cheek to be smitten, sympathizing with the suffering of the outward man, and in a way submitting and subjecting its own body to wrong from the striker, that the inner man may not even silently be  <a name="page_458"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 458</font></a> <a name="iv.v.vii.xxii-Page_458"></a>disturbed in itself at the blows of the outward man. You see then that they are very far from evangelical perfection, which teaches that patience must be maintained, not in words but in inward tranquillity of heart, and which bids us preserve it whatever evil happens, that we may not only keep ourselves always from disturbing anger, but also by submitting to their injuries compel those, who are disturbed by their own fault, to become calm, when they have had their fill of blows; and so overcome their rage by our gentleness. And so also we shall fulfil these words of the Apostle: “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” <a name="fr_1998"></a><a href="#fn_1998"><font size="1">1999</font></a>
  And it is quite clear that this cannot be fulfilled by those who utter words of gentleness and humility in such a spirit and rage that they not only fail to lessen the fire of wrath which has been kindled, but rather make it blaze up the more fiercely both in their own feelings and in those of their enraged brother. But these, even if they could in some way keep calm and quiet themselves, would yet not bear any fruits of righteousness, while they claim the glory of patience on their part by their neighbours loss, and are thus altogether removed from that Apostolic love which “Seeketh not her own,” <a name="fr_1999"></a><a href="#fn_1999"><font size="1">2000</font></a>
  but the things of others. For it does not so desire riches in such a way as to make profit for itself out of ones neighbours loss, nor does it wish to gain anything if it involves the spoiling of another.</p>
