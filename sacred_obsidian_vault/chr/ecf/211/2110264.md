 <p> <a name="iii.xxiii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iii.xxiii-p1"></a>A more particular Exposition of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020">1 Tim. vi. 20</a><a name="iii.xxiii-p1.1"></a>.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iii.xxiii-p2"></a>[53.] <span class="sc"><a name="iii.xxiii-p2.1"></a>But</span> it is worth while to expound the whole of that passage of the apostle more fully, “O Timothy, keep the deposit, avoiding profane novelties of words.”</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xxiii-p3"></a>“O!” The exclamation implies fore-knowledge as well as charity. For he mourned in anticipation over the errors which he foresaw. Who is the Timothy of to-day, but either generally the Universal Church, or in particular, the whole body of The Prelacy, whom it behoves either themselves to possess or to communicate to others a complete knowledge of religion? What is “Keep the deposit”? “Keep it,” because of thieves, because of adversaries, lest, while men sleep, they sow tares over that good wheat which the Son of Man had sown in his field. “Keep the deposit.” What is “The deposit”? That which has been intrusted to thee, not that which thou hast thyself devised: a matter not of wit, but of learning; not of private adoption, but of public tradition; a matter brought to thee, not put forth by thee, wherein thou art bound to be not an author but a keeper, not a teacher but a disciple, not a leader but a follower. “Keep the deposit.” Preserve the talent of Catholic Faith inviolate, unadulterate. That which has been intrusted to thee, let it continue in thy possession, let it be handed on by thee. Thou hast received gold; give gold in turn. Do not substitute one thing for another. Do not for gold impudently substitute lead or brass. Give real gold, not counterfeit.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xxiii-p4"></a>O Timothy! O Priest! O Expositor! O Doctor! if the divine gift hath qualified thee by wit, by skill, by learning, be thou a Bazaleel of the spiritual tabernacle, <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_499"><font size="1">500</font></a>
  engrave the precious gems of divine doctrine, fit them in accurately, adorn them skilfully, add splendor, grace, beauty. Let that which formerly was believed, though imperfectly apprehended, as expounded by thee be clearly understood. Let posterity welcome, understood through thy exposition, what antiquity venerated without understanding. Yet teach still the same truths which thou hast learnt, so that though thou speakest after a new fashion, what thou speakest may not be new.</p>
