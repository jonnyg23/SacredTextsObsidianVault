 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xix-p1"></a>An illustration to help in forming an opinion on those who are only patient when they are not tried by any one.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xix-p2.1"></a>But</span> it is like all poisonous kinds of serpents or of wild beasts, which, while they remain in solitude and their own lairs, are still not harmless; <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">945</font></a>
  for they cannot really be said to be harmless, because they are not actually hurting anybody. For this results in their case, not from any feeling of goodness, but from the exigencies of solitude, and when they have secured an opportunity of hurting some one, at once they produce the poison stored up in them, and show the ferocity of their nature. And so in the case of men who are aiming at perfection, it is not enough not to be angry with <i>men</i>. For we recollect that when we were living in solitude a feeling of irritation would creep over us against our pen because it was too large or too small; against our penknife when it cut badly and with a blunt edge what we wanted cut; and against a flint if by chance when we were rather late and hurrying to the reading, a spark of fire flashed out, so that we could not remove  <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.viii.xix-Page_263"></a>and get rid of our perturbation of mind except by cursing the senseless matter, or at least the devil. Wherefore for a method of perfection it will not be of any use for there to be a dearth of men against whom our anger might be roused: since, if patience has not already been acquired, the feelings of passion which still dwell in our hearts can equally well spend themselves on dumb things and paltry objects, and not allow us to gain a continuous state of peacefulness, or to be free from our remaining faults: unless perhaps we think that some advantage and a sort of cure may be gained for our passion from the fact that inanimate and speechless things cannot possibly reply to our curses and rage, nor provoke our ungovernable temper to break out into a worse madness of passion.</p>
