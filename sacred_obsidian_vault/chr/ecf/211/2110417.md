 <p> <a name="iv.iii.vii.i"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.vii.i-p0.1"></a>Chapter I.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.vii.i-p1"></a>How our warfare with covetousness is a foreign one, and how this fault is not a natural one in man, as the other faults are.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.vii.i-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.vii.i-p2.1"></a>Our</span> third conflict is against covetousness which we can describe as the love of money; a foreign warfare, and one outside of our nature, and in the case of a monk originating only from the state of a corrupt and sluggish mind, and often from the beginning of his renunciation being unsatisfactory, and his love towards God being lukewarm at its foundation. For the rest of the incitements to sin planted in human nature seem to have their commencement as it were congenital with us, and somehow being deeply rooted in our flesh, and almost cœval with our birth, anticipate our powers of discerning good and evil, and although in very early days they attack a man, yet they are overcome with a long struggle.</p>
