 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.x-p1"></a>A question whether it is bad for a monk to have his wants supplied by his kinsfolk.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.x-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.x-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: On this subject you have certainly left no room for any further uncertainty. For we are sure that we cannot possibly keep up our present wretched garb, or our daily going barefoot in their neighbourhood, and that there we should not even procure with the same labour what is necessary for our sustenance, as here we are actually obliged to fetch our water on our necks for three miles. For shame on our part as well as on theirs would not in the least allow us to do this before them. However how will it hurt our plan of life if we are altogether set free from anxiety on the score of preparing our food, by being supplied by them with all things, and so give ourselves up simply to reading and prayer, that by the removal of that labour with which we are now distracted we may devote ourselves more earnestly to spiritual interests alone?</p>
