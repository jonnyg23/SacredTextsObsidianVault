 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.ix.iv-p1"></a>Of the double sense in which Holy Scripture may be taken.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ix.iv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ix.iv-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> on those passages which are brought forward with a clear explanation we also can constantly lay down the meaning and boldly state our own opinions. But those which the Holy Spirit, reserving for our meditation and exercise, has inserted in holy Scripture with veiled meaning, wishing some of them to be gathered from various proofs and conjectures, ought to be step by step and carefully brought together, so that their assertions and proofs may be arranged by the discretion of the man who is arguing or supporting them. For sometimes when a difference of opinion is expressed on one and the same subject, either view may be considered reasonable and be held without injury to the faith either firmly, or doubtfully, i.e., in such a way that neither is full belief nor absolute rejection accorded to it, and the second view need not interfere with the former, if neither of them is found to be opposed to the faith: as in this case: where Elias came in the person of John, <a name="fr_1523"></a><a href="#fn_1523"><font size="1">1524</font></a>
  and is again to be the precursor of the Lords Advent: and in the matter of the “Abomination of desolation” which “stood in the holy place,” by means of that idol of Jupiter which, as we read, was placed in the temple in Jerusalem, and which is again to stand in the Church through the coming of Antichrist, <a name="fr_1524"></a><a href="#fn_1524"><font size="1">1525</font></a>
  and all those things which follow in the gospel, which we take as having been fulfilled before the captivity of Jerusalem and still to be fulfilled at the end of this world. In which matters neither view is opposed to the other, nor does the first interpretation interfere with the second.</p>
