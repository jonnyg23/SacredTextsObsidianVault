 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.iii.ix-p1"></a>A question about the acquirement of true discretion.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.iii.ix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.iii.ix-p2.1"></a>To</span> this Germanus: It has been fully and completely shown both by recent instances and by the decisions of the ancients how discretion is in some sense the fountain head and the root of all virtues. We want then to learn how it ought to be gained, or how we can tell whether it is genuine and from God, or whether it is spurious and from the devil: so that (to use the figure of that gospel parable which you discussed on a former occasion, in which we are bidden to become good money changers <a name="fr_1179"></a><a href="#fn_1179"><font size="1">1180</font></a>
 ) we may be able to see the figure of the true king stamped on the coin and to detect what is not stamped on coin that is current, and that, as you said in yesterdays talk using an ordinary expression, we may reject it as counterfeit, under the teaching of that skill which you treated of with sufficient fulness and detail, and showed ought to belong to the man who is spiritually a good money changer of the gospel. For of what good will it be to have recognized the value of that virtue and grace if we do not know how to seek for it and to gain it?</p>
