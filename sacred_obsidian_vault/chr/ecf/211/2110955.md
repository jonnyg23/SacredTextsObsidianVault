 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.ii.ii-p1"></a>The words of Abbot Piamun, how monks who were novices ought to be taught by the example of their elders.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.ii.ii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.ii.ii-p2.1"></a>Whatever</span> man, my children, is desirous to attain skill in any art, unless he gives himself up with the utmost pains and carefulness to the study of that system which he is anxious to learn, and observes the rules and orders of the best masters of that work or science, is indulging in a vain hope to reach by idle wishes any similarity to those whose pains and diligence he avoids copying. For we know that some have come from your country to these parts, only to go round the monasteries for the sake of getting to know the brethren, not meaning to adopt the rules and  <a name="page_480"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 480</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.ii.ii-Page_480"></a>regulations, for the sake of which they travelled hither, nor to retire to the cells and aim at carrying out in action what they had learnt by sight or by teaching. And these people retained their character and pursuits to which they had grown accustomed, and, as is thrown in their teeth by some, are held to have changed their country not for the sake of their profit, but owing to the need of escaping want. For in the obstinacy of their stubborn mind, they not only could learn nothing, but actually would not stay any longer in these parts. For if they changed neither their method of fasting, nor their scheme of Psalms, nor even the fashion of their garments, what else could we think that they were after in this country, except only the supply of their victuals.</p>
