 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xviii-p1"></a>A question whether we should be drawn back to our country by a proper desire for greater silence.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xviii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xviii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: Among other kinds of illusions and mistakes on our part, which by the vain promise of spiritual advantages have fired us with a longing for our country (as your holiness has discovered by the keen insight of your mind), this stands out as the principal reason, that sometimes we are beset by our brethren and cannot possibly continue in unbroken solitude and continual silence, as we should like. And by this the course and measure of our daily abstinence, which we always want to maintain undisturbed for the chastening of our body, is sure to be interfered with on the arrival of some of the brethren. And this we certainly feel would never happen in our own country, where it is impossible to find anyone, or scarcely anyone who adopts this manner of life.</p>
