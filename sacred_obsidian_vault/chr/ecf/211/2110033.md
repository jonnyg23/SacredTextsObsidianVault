 <p> <a name="ii.iii.i"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ii.iii.i-p0.1"></a>Letter I. To Eusebius.</h3>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="ii.iii.i-p1"></a>Against Some Envious Assailants of Martin.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.iii.i-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.iii.i-p2.1"></a>Yesterday</span> a number of monks having come to me, it happened that amid endless fables, and much tiresome discourse, mention was made of the little work which I published concerning the life of that saintly man Martin, and I was most happy to hear that it was being eagerly and carefully read by multitudes. In the meantime, however, I was told that a certain person, under the influence of an evil spirit, had asked why Martin, who was said to have raised the dead and to have rescued houses from the flames, had himself recently become subject to the power of fire, and thus been exposed to suffering of a dangerous character. Wretched man, whoever he is, that expressed himself thus! We recognize his perfidious talk in the words of the Jews of old, who reviled the Lord, when hanging upon the cross, in the following terms: “He saved others; himself he cannot save.” <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">44</font></a>
  Truly it is clear that, whoever be the person referred to, if he had lived in those times, he would have been quite prepared to speak against the Lord in these terms, inasmuch as he blasphemes a saint of the Lord, after a like fashion. How then, I ask thee, whosoever thou art, how does the case stand? Was Martin really not possessed of power, and not a partaker of holiness, because he became exposed to danger from fire? O thou blessed man, and in all things like to the Apostles, even in the reproaches which are thus heaped upon thee! Assuredly those Gentiles are reported to have entertained the same sort of thought respecting Paul also, when the viper had bitten him, for they said, “This man must be a murderer, whom, although saved from the sea, the fates do not permit to live.” <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">45</font></a>
  But he, shaking off the viper into the fire, suffered no harm. They, however, imagined that he would suddenly fall down, and speedily die; but when they saw that no harm befell him, changing their minds, they said that he was a God. But, O thou most miserable of men, you ought, even from that example to have yourself been convinced of your falsity; so that, if it had proved a stumbling-block to thee that Martin appeared touched by the flame of fire, you should, on the other hand, have ascribed his being merely touched to his merits and power, because, though surrounded by flames, he did not perish. For acknowledge, thou miserable man, acknowledge what you seem ignorant of, that almost all the saints have been more remarkable for <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">46</font></a>
  the dangers they encountered, than even for the virtues they displayed. I see, indeed, Peter strong in faith, walking over the waves of the sea, in opposition to the nature of things, and that he pressed the unstable waters with his footprints. But not on that account does the preacher of the Gentiles <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">47</font></a>
  seem to me a smaller man, whom the waves swallowed up; and, after three days <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">48</font></a>
  and three nights, the water restored him emerging from the deep. Nay, I am almost inclined to think that it was a greater thing to have lived in the deep, than to have walked along the depths of the sea. But, thou foolish man, you had not, as I suppose, read these things; or, having read them, had not understood them. For the blessed Evangelist would not have recorded in holy writ an incident of that kind—under divine guidance—(except that, from such cases, the human mind might be instructed as to the dangers connected with shipwrecks and serpents!) and, as the Apostle relates, who gloried in his nakedness, and hunger, and perils from robbers, all these things are indeed to be endured in common by holy men, but that it has always been the chief excellence of the righteous in enduring and conquering such things, while amid all their trials, being patient and ever unconquerable, they overcame them all the more courageously, the heavier was the burden which they had to bear. Hence this event which is ascribed to the infirmity of Martin is, in reality, full of dignity and glory, since indeed, being tried  <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a> <a name="ii.iii.i-Page_19"></a>by a most dangerous calamity, he came forth a conqueror. But let no one wonder that the incident referred to was omitted by me in that treatise which I wrote concerning his life, since in that very work I openly acknowledged that I had not embraced all his acts; and that for the good reason that, if I had been minded to narrate them all, I must have presented an enormous volume to my readers. And indeed, his achievements were not of so limited a number that they could all be comprehended in a book. Nevertheless, I shall not leave this incident, about which a question has arisen, to remain in obscurity, but shall relate the whole affair as it occurred, lest I should appear perchance to have intentionally passed over that which might be put forward in calumniation of the saintly man.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iii.i-p8"></a>Martin having, about the middle of winter, come to a certain parish, <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">49</font></a>
  according to the usual custom for the bishops to visit the churches in the diocese, the clerics had prepared an abode for him in the private <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">50</font></a>
  part of the church, and had kindled a large fire beneath the floor which was decayed and very thin. <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">51</font></a>
  They also erected for him a couch consisting of a large amount of straw. Then, when Martin betook himself to rest, he was annoyed with the softness of the too luxurious bed, inasmuch as he had been accustomed to lie on the bare ground with only a piece of sackcloth stretched over him. Accordingly, influenced by the injury which had, as it were, been done him, he threw aside the whole of the straw. Now, it so happened that part of the straw which he had thus removed fell upon the stove. He himself, in the meantime, rested, as was his wont, upon the bare ground, tired out by his long journey. About midnight, the fire bursting up through the stove which, as I have said, was far from sound, laid hold of the dry straw. Martin, being wakened out of sleep by this unexpected occurrence, and being prevented by the pressing danger, but chiefly, as he afterwards related, by the snares and urgency of the devil, was longer than he ought to have been in having recourse to the aid of prayer. For, desiring to get outside, he struggled long and laboriously with the bolt by which he had secured the door. Ere long he perceived that he was surrounded by a fearful conflagration; and the fire had even laid hold of the garment with which he was clothed. At length recovering his habitual conviction that his safety lay not in flight, but in the Lord, and seizing the shield of faith and prayer, committing himself entirely to the Lord, he lay down in the midst of the flames. Then truly, the fire having been removed by divine interposition, he continued to pray amid a circle of flames that did him no harm. But the monks, who were before the door, hearing the sound of the crackling and struggling fire, broke open the barred door; and, the fire being extinguished, they brought forth Martin from the midst of the flames, all the time supposing that he must ere then have been burnt to ashes by a fire of so long continuance. Now, as the Lord is my witness, he himself related to me, and not without groans, confessed that he was in this matter beguiled by the arts of the devil; in that, when roused from sleep, he did not take the wise course of repelling the danger by means of faith and prayer. He also added that the flames raged around him all the time that, with a distempered mind, he strove to throw open the door. But he declared that as soon as he again sought assistance from the cross, and tried the weapons of prayer, the central flames gave way, and that he then felt them shedding a dewy refreshment over him, after having just experienced how cruelly they burned him. Considering all which, let every one who reads this letter understand that Martin was indeed tried by that danger, but passed through it with true acceptance. <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">52</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.iii.i-p7"></a> The writer here supposes that St. Paul was sunk for three days and three nights in the sea—a mistaken inference from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025">2 Cor. xi. 25</a><a name="ii.iii.i-p7.1"></a>. The construction of the very long sentence which soon follows is very confused, and has not been rigidly followed in our translation.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.iii.i-p11"></a> “pavimento”: this word usually means “a floor,” or “pavement,” but some take it here to be the same as <i>fornax</i>. This, however, can hardly be the case; and the meaning probably is that the church was heated, as the baths were, by means of a <i>hypocaustum</i>, or flue running below the pavement.</p>
