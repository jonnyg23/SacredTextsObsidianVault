 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xxii-p1"></a>The remedies by which we can root out anger from our hearts.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xxii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.viii.xxii-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> the athlete of Christ who strives lawfully ought thoroughly to root out the feeling of wrath. And it will be a sure remedy for this disease, if in the first place we make up our mind that we ought never to be angry at all, whether for good or bad reasons: as we know that we shall at once lose the light of discernment, and the security of good counsel, and our very uprightness, and the temperate character of righteousness, if the <a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.viii.xxii-Page_264"></a>main light of our heart has been darkened by its shadows: next, that the purity of our soul will presently be clouded, and that it cannot possibly be made a temple for the Holy Ghost while the spirit of anger resides in us; lastly, that we should consider that we ought never to pray, nor pour out our prayer to God, while we are angry. And above all, having before our eyes the uncertain condition of mankind, we should realize daily that we are soon to depart from the body, and that our continence and chastity, our renunciation of all our possessions, our contempt of wealth, our efforts in fastings and vigils will not help us at all, if solely on account of anger and hatred eternal punishments are awarded to us by the judge of the world.</p>
