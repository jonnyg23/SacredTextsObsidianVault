 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxiii-p1"></a>The answer that obstinacy in this decision is unreasonable.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxiii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxiii-p2.1"></a>Joseph</span>: There is no doubt that these are the decisions of those monasteries in which the infancy of your renunciation was, as you tell us, trained, as their leaders are accustomed to prefer their own will to their brothers supper, and most obstinately stick to what they have once intended. But our Elders, to whose faith the signs of Apostolical powers have borne witness, and who have treated everything with judgment and discretion of spirit rather than with stiff obstinacy of mind, have laid down that those men who give in to the infirmities of others, receive much richer fruits than those who persist in their determinations, and have declared that it is a better deed to conceal abstinence, as was said, by this needful and humble lie, rather than to display it with a proud show of truth.</p>
