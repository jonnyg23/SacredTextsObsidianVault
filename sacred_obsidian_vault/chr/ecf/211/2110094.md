 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.iv.iii.xiv-p1"></a>“<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.iii.xiv-p1.1"></a>But</span> clearly, as we experienced, he repaired, with manifold interest, his grace, which had been diminished for a time. I saw afterwards a possessed person brought to him at the gate <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">138</font></a>
  of the monastery; and that, before the man touched the threshold, he was cured.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.iii.xiv-p3"></a>“I lately heard one testifying that, when he was sailing on the Tuscan Sea, following that course which leads to Rome, whirlwinds having suddenly arisen, all on board were in extreme peril of their lives. In these circumstances, a certain Egyptian merchant, who was not yet a Christian, cried out, Save us, O God of Martin, upon which the tempest was immediately stilled, and they held their desired course, while the pacified ocean continued in perfect tranquillity.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.iii.xiv-p4"></a>“Lycontius, a believing man belonging to the lieutenants, when a violent disease was afflicting his family, and sick bodies were lying all through his house in sad proof of unheard-of calamity, implored the help of Martin by a letter. At this time the blessed man declared that the thing asked was difficult to be obtained, for he knew in his spirit that that house was then being scourged by Divine appointment. Yet he did not give up an unbroken course of prayer and fasting for seven whole days and as many nights, so that he at last obtained that which he aimed at in his supplications. Speedily, Lycontius, having experienced the Divine kindness, flew to him, at once reporting the fact and giving thanks, that his house had been delivered from all danger. He also offered a hundred pounds of silver, which the blessed man neither rejected nor accepted; but before the amount of money touched the threshold of the monastery, he had, without hesitation, destined it for the redemption of captives. And when it was suggested to him by the brethren, that some portion of it should be reserved for the expenses of the monastery, since it was difficult for all of them to obtain necessary food, while many of them were sorely in need of clothing, he replied, Let the church both feed and clothe us, as long as we do not appear to have provided, in any way, for our own wants.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.iii.xiv-p5"></a>“There occur to my mind at this point many miracles of that illustrious man, which it is more easy for us to admire than to narrate. You all doubtless recognize the truth of what I say: there are many doings of his which cannot be set forth in words. For instance, there is the following, which I rather think cannot be related by us just as it took place. A certain one of the brethren (you are not ignorant of his name, but his person must be concealed, lest we should cause shame to a godly man),—a certain one, I say, having found abundance of coals for his stove, drew a stool to himself, and was sitting, with outspread legs and exposed person, beside that fire, when Martin at once perceived that an improper thing was done under the sacred roof, and cried out with a loud voice, Who, by exposing his person, is dishonoring our habitation? When our brother heard this, and felt from his own conscience, that it was he who was rebuked, he immediately ran to us almost in a fainting condition, and acknowledged his shame; which was done, how<a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.iii.xiv-Page_53"></a>ever, only through the forth-putting of the power of Martin.</p>
