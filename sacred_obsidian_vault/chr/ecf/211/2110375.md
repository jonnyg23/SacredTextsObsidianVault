 <p> <a name="iv.iii.v.ii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p0.1"></a>Chapter II.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p1"></a>How the occasions of these faults, being found in everybody, are ignored by everybody; and how we need the Lords help to make them plain.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p2.1"></a>And</span> of these passions as the occasions are recognized by everybody as soon as they are laid open by the teaching of the elders, so before they are revealed, although we are all overcome by them, and they exist in every one, yet nobody knows of them. But we trust that we shall be able in some measure to explain them, if by your prayers that word of the Lord, which was announced by Isaiah, may apply to us also—“I will go before thee, and bring low the mighty ones of the land, I will break the gates of brass, and cut asunder the iron bars, and I will open to thee concealed treasures and hidden secrets” <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">820</font></a>
 —so that the word of the Lord may go before us also, and first may bring low the mighty ones of our land, i.e. these same evil passions which we are desirous to overcome, and which claim for themselves dominion and a most horrible tyranny in our mortal body; and may make them yield to our investigation and explanation, and thus breaking the gates of our ignorance, and cutting asunder the bars of vices which shut us out from true knowledge, may lead to the hidden things of our secrets, and reveal to us who have been illuminated, according to the Apostles word, “the hidden things of darkness, and may make manifest the counsels of the hearts,” <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">821</font></a>
  that thus penetrating with pure eyes of the mind to the foul darkness of vices, we may be able to disclose them and drag them forth to light; and may succeed in explaining their occasions and natures to those who are either free from them, or are still tied and bound by them, and so passing as the prophet says, <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">822</font></a>
  through the fire of vices which terribly inflame our minds, we may be able forthwith to pass also through the water of virtues which extinguish them unharmed, and being bedewed (as it were) with spiritual remedies may be found worthy to be brought in purity of heart to the consolations of perfection.</p>
