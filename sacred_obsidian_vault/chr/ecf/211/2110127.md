 <p> <a name="ii.v.ii.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="ii.v.ii.xix-p0.1"></a>Chapter XIX.</h4>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.v.ii.xix-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.ii.xix-p1.1"></a>When</span> you repeat <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">226</font></a>
  a psalm, consider whose words you are repeating and delight yourself more with true contrition of soul, than with the pleasantness of a trilling voice. For God sets a higher value on the tears of one thus praising <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">227</font></a>
  him, than on the beauty of his voice; as the prophet says, “Serve <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">228</font></a>
  the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.” Now, where there are fear and trembling, there is no lifting up of the voice, but humility of mind with lamentation and tears. Display diligence in all thy doings; for it is written, “Cursed <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">229</font></a>
  is the man who carelessly performs the work of the Lord.” Let grace grow in you with years; let righteousness increase with age; and let your faith appear the more perfect the older you become; for Jesus, who has left us an example how to live, increased not only in years as respected his body, but in wisdom and spiritual grace before God and men. Reckon all the time in which you do not perceive yourself growing better as positively lost. Maintain to the last that purpose of virginity which you have formed; for it is the part of virtue not merely to begin, but to finish, as the Lord says in the Gospel, “Whosoever <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">230</font></a>
  shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.” Beware, therefore, lest you furnish to any one an occasion even of evil desire, because thy God, betrothed to thee, is jealous; for an adulteress against Christ is more guilty than one against her husband. Be thou, therefore, a model of life to all; be an example; and excel in actual conduct those whom you precede in your consecration <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">231</font></a>
  to chastity. Show thyself in all respects a virgin; and let no stain of corruption be brought as a charge against thy person. And let one whose body is perfect in its purity be also irreproachable in conduct. Now, as we said in the beginning of this letter, that you have become a sacrifice pertaining to God, such a sacrifice as undoubtedly imparts its own sanctity also to others, that, as every one worthily receives from it, he himself also may be a partaker of sanctification, so then, let the other virgins also be sanctified through you, as by means of a divine offering. Show yourself to them so holy in all things, that, whosoever comes in contact with thy life, whether by hearing or seeing, may experience the power of sanctification, and may feel that such an amount of grace passes to him from your manner of acting, that, while he desires to imitate thee, he himself becomes worthy of being a sacrifice devoted to God.</p>
