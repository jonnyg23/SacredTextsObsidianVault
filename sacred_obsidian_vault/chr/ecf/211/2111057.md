 <p> <a name="iv.vi.vii.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xix-p0.1"></a>Chapter XIX.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xix-p1"></a>How even in the hour of prayer it is almost impossible to avoid sin.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xix-p2.1"></a>Whoever</span> then ascribes sinlessness to human nature must fight against no idle words but the witness and proof of his conscience which is on our side, and then only should maintain that he is without sin, when he finds that he is not torn away from this highest good: nay rather, whoever considering his own conscience, to say no more, finds that he has celebrated even one single service without the distraction of a single word or deed or thought, may say that he is without sin. Further because we admit that the discursive lightness of the human mind cannot get rid of these idle and empty things, we thus consequently confess with truth that we are not without sin. For with whatever care a man tries to keep his heart, he can never, owing to the resistance of the nature of the flesh, keep it according to the desire of his spirit. For however far the human mind may have advanced and progressed towards a finer purity of contemplation, so much the more will it see itself to be unclean, as it were in the mirror of its purity, because while the soul raises itself for a loftier vision and as it looks forth yearns for greater things than it performs, it is sure always to despise as inferior and worthless the things in which it is mixed up. Since a keener sight notices more; and a blameless life produces greater sorrow when found fault with; and amendment of life, and earnest striving after goodness multiplies groans and sighs. For no one can rest content with that stage to which he has advanced, and however much a man may be purified in mind, so much the more does he see himself to be foul, and find grounds for humiliation rather than for pride, and, however swiftly he may climb to greater heights, so much more does he see above him whither he is tending. Finally that chosen Apostle “whom Jesus loved,” <a name="fr_2288"></a><a href="#fn_2288"><font size="1">2289</font></a>
  who lay on His bosom, uttered this saying as if from the heart of the Lord:  <a name="page_531"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 531</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.vii.xix-Page_531"></a>“If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” <a name="fr_2289"></a><a href="#fn_2289"><font size="1">2290</font></a>
  And so if when we say that we have no sin, we have not the truth, that is Christ, in us, what good do we do except to prove ourselves by this very profession, criminals and wicked among sinners?</p>
