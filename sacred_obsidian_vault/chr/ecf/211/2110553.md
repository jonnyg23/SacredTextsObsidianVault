 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxii-p1"></a>That every proud soul is subject to spiritual wickedness to be deceived by it.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxii-p2.1"></a>And</span> this clearly shows that every soul of which the swellings of pride have taken possession, is given over to the Syrians of the soul, <a name="fr_1075"></a><a href="#fn_1075"><font size="1">1076</font></a>
  i.e., to spiritual wickedness, and that it is entangled in the lusts of the flesh, that the soul being at last humbled by earthly faults, and carnally polluted, may recognize its uncleanness, though while it stood erect in the coldness of its heart, it could not understand that through pride of heart it was rendered unclean in the sight of God; and by this means being humbled, a man may get rid of his former coldness, and being cast down and confused with the shame of his fleshly lusts, may thenceforward hasten to betake himself the more eagerly towards fervour and warmth of spirit.</p>
