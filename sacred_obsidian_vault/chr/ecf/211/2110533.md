 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xii.ii-p1"></a>How there are two kinds of pride.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.ii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.ii-p2.1"></a>And</span> of this pride there are two kinds: the one, that by which we said that the best of men and spiritually minded ones were troubled; the other, that which assaults even beginners and carnal persons. And though each kind of pride is excited with regard to both God and man by a dangerous elation, yet that first kind more particularly has to do with God; the second refers especially to men. Of the origin of this last and the remedies for it we will by Gods help treat as far as possible in the latter part of this book. We now propose to say a few things about that former kind, by which, as I mentioned before, those who are perfect are especially tried.</p>
