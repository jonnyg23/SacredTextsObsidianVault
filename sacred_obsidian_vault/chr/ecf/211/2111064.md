 <p> <a name="iv.vi.viii.iv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.viii.iv-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.iv-p1"></a>What sorts of work should be chosen by solitaries.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.iv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.iv-p2.1"></a>Everyone</span> therefore who constantly perseveres in this watchfulness will effectually fulfil what is very plainly expressed by the prophet Habakkuk: “I will stand upon my watch, and ascend upon the rock, and will look out to see what He shall say to me, and what I may answer to Him that reproveth me.” <a name="fr_2302"></a><a href="#fn_2302"><font size="1">2303</font></a>
  And how difficult and tiresome this is, is very clearly shown by the experience of those who live in the desert of Calamus or Porphyrion. <a name="fr_2303"></a><a href="#fn_2303"><font size="1">2304</font></a>
  For though they are separated from all the cities and dwellings of men by a longer stretch of desert than the wilderness of Scete (since by penetrating seven or eight days journey into the recesses of the vast wilderness, they scarcely arrive at their hiding places and cells) yet because there they are devoted to agriculture and not in the least confined to the cloister, whenever they come to these squalid districts in which we are living, or to Scete, they are annoyed by such harassing thoughts and such anxiety of mind that, as if they were beginners and men who had never given the slightest attention to the exercises of solitude, they cannot endure the life of the cells and the peace and quietness of them, and are at once driven forth and obliged to leave them, as if they were inexperienced and novices. For they have not learnt to still the motions of the inner man, and to quell the tempests of their thoughts by anxious care and persevering efforts, as, toiling day after day in work in the open air, they are moving about all day long in empty space, not only in the flesh but also in heart; and pour forth their thoughts openly as the body moves hither and thither. And therefore they do not notice the folly of their mind in longing for many things, nor can they put a check upon its vague discursiveness; and as they cannot bear sorrow of spirit they think that the fact of a continuance of silence is unendurable, and those who are never tired by hard work in the country, are beaten by silence and worn out by the length of their rest.</p>
