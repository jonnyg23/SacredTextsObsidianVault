 <p> <a name="iv.vi.vii.xi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XI.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xi-p1"></a>Explanation of the phrase: “For I delight in the law of God after the inner man,” etc.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xi-p2.1"></a>And</span> they “delight” indeed “in the law of God after the inner man,” which soars above all visible things and ever strives to be united to God alone, but they “see another law in their members,” i.e., implanted in their natural human condition, which “resisting the law of their mind,” <a name="fr_2265"></a><a href="#fn_2265"><font size="1">2266</font></a>
  brings their thoughts into captivity to the forcible law of sin, compelling them to forsake that chief good and submit to earthly notions, which though they may appear necessary and useful when they are taken up in the interests of some religious want, yet when they are set against that good which fascinates the gaze of all the saints, are seen by them to be bad and such as should be avoided, because by them in some way or other and for a short time they are drawn away from the joy of that perfect bliss. For the law of sin is really what the fall of its first father brought on mankind by that fault of his, against which there was uttered this sentence by the most just Judge: “Cursed is the ground in thy works; thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and in the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.” <a name="fr_2266"></a><a href="#fn_2266"><font size="1">2267</font></a>
  This, I say, is the law, implanted in the members of all mortals, which resists the law of our mind and keeps it back from the vision of God, and which, as the earth is cursed in our works after the knowledge of good and evil, begins to produce the thorns and thistles of thoughts, by the sharp pricks of which the natural seeds of virtues are choked, so that without the sweat of our brow we cannot eat our bread which “cometh down from heaven,” and which “strengtheneth mans heart.” <a name="fr_2267"></a><a href="#fn_2267"><font size="1">2268</font></a>
  The whole human race in general therefore is without exception subject to this law. For there is no one, however saintly, who does not take the  <a name="page_526"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 526</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.vii.xi-Page_526"></a>bread mentioned above with the sweat of his brow and anxious efforts of his heart. But many rich men, as we see, are fed on that common bread without any sweat of their brow.</p>
