 <p> <a name="iv.iii.xii.xxi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXI.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p1"></a>The instance of Joash, King of Judah, showing what was the consequence of his pride.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p2.1"></a>Some</span> such thing we read of in the book of Chronicles. For Joash the king of Judah at the age of seven was summoned by Jehoiada the priest to the kingdom and by the witness of Scripture is commended for all his actions as long as the aforesaid priest lived. But hear what Scripture relates of him after Jehoiadas death, and how he was puffed up with pride and given over to a most disgraceful state. “But after the death of Jehoiada the princes went in and worshipped the king: and he was soothed by their services and hearkened unto them. And they forsook the temple of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and served groves and idols, and great wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of this sin.” And after a little: “When a year was come about, the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and killed all the princes of the people, and they sent all the spoils to the king to Damascus. And whereas there came a very small number of the Syrians, the Lord delivered into their hands an infinite multitude, because they had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers: and on Joash they executed shameful judgments. And departing they left him in great diseases.” <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">1073</font></a>
  You see how the consequence of pride was that he was given over to shocking and filthy passions. For he who is puffed up with pride and has permitted himself to be worshipped as God, is (as the Apostle says) “given over to shameful passions and a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient.” <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">1074</font></a>
  And because, as Scripture says, “every one who exalts his heart is unclean before God,” <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">1075</font></a>
  he who is puffed up with swelling pride of heart is given over to most shameful confusion to be deluded by it, that when thus humbled he may know that he is unclean through impurity of the flesh and knowledge of impure desires,—a thing which he had refused to recognize in the pride of his heart; and also that the shameful infection of the  <a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.xii.xxi-Page_287"></a>flesh may disclose the hidden impurity of the heart, which he contracted through the sin of pride, and that through the patent pollution of his body he may be proved to be impure, who did not formerly see that he had become unclean through the pride of his spirit.</p>
