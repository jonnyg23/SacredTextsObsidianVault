 <p> <a name="iv.vii.viii.xxv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXV.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p1"></a>He shows that Ambrose agrees with S. Hilary.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxv-p2.1"></a>Ambrose</span>, that illustrious priest of God, who never leaving the Lords hand, ever shone like a jewel upon the finger of God, thus speaks in his book to the Virgins: “My brother is white and ruddy. <a name="fr_2663"></a><a href="#fn_2663"><font size="1">2664</font></a>
  White because He is the glory of the Father: ruddy because He was born of the Virgin. But remember that in Him the tokens of Divinity are of longer standing than the mysteries of the body. For He did not  <a name="page_618"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 618</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.viii.xxv-Page_618"></a>begin to exist from the Virgin, but He who was already in existence, came into the Virgin.” <a name="fr_2664"></a><a href="#fn_2664"><font size="1">2665</font></a>
  Again on Christmas Day: “See the miracle of the mother of the Lord: A Virgin conceived, a Virgin brought forth. She was a Virgin when she conceived, a Virgin when with child, a Virgin after the birth. As is said in Ezekiel: “And the gate was shut and not opened, because the Lord passed through it.” <a name="fr_2665"></a><a href="#fn_2665"><font size="1">2666</font></a>
  A splendid Virginity, and wondrous fruitfulness! The Lord of the world is born: and there are no cries from her who brought Him forth. The womb is left empty, and a true child is born, and yet the Virginity is not destroyed. It was right that when God was born the power of chastity should become greater, and that her purity should not be violated by the going forth of Him who had come to heal what was corrupt.” <a name="fr_2666"></a><a href="#fn_2666"><font size="1">2667</font></a>
  Again in his exposition of the gospel according to Luke he says that “one was especially chosen, to bring forth God, who was espoused to an husband.” <a name="fr_2667"></a><a href="#fn_2667"><font size="1">2668</font></a>
  He certainly declares that God was born of the Virgin. He calls Mary the mother of God. And where is that awful and execrable utterance of yours asking how can she be the mother of one of a different nature from her own. But if she is called mother by them, it is the human nature which was born not the Godhead. So, that illustrious teacher of the faith says both that she who bare Him was human, and that He who was born is God: and yet that this is no reason for unbelief, but only a miracle of faith.</p>
