 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xxiv-p1"></a>That covetousness cannot be overcome except by stripping ones self of everything.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xxiv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xxiv-p2.1"></a>This</span> is a sufficiently dreadful and clear instance of this tyranny, which, when once the mind is taken prisoner by it, allows it to keep to no rules of honesty, nor to be satisfied with any additions to its gains. For we must seek to put an end to this madness, not by riches, but by stripping ourselves of them. Lastly, when he (viz. Judas) had received the bag set apart for the distribution to the poor, and intrusted to his care for this purpose, that he might at least satisfy himself with plenty of money, and set a limit to his avarice, yet his plentiful supply only broke out into a still greedier incitement of desire, so that he was ready no longer secretly to rob the bag, but actually to sell the Lord Himself. For the madness of this avarice is not satisfied with any amount of riches.</p>
