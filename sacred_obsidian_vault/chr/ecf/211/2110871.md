 <p> <a name="iv.v.v.xi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.v.v.xi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XI.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.v.xi-p1"></a>Of the manifold meaning of the Holy Scriptures.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.v.xi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.v.xi-p2.1"></a>But</span> as the renewal of our soul grows by means of this study, Scripture also will begin to put on a new face, and the beauty of the holier meanings will somehow grow with our growth. For their form is adapted to the capacity of mans understanding, and will appear earthly to carnal people, and divine to spiritual ones, so that those to whom it formerly appeared to be involved in thick clouds, cannot apprehend its subtleties nor endure its light. But to make this which we are aiming at somewhat clearer by an instance, it will be enough to produce a single passage of the law, by which we can prove that all the heavenly commands as well are applied to men in accordance with the measure of our state. For it is written in the law: “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” <a name="fr_1895"></a><a href="#fn_1895"><font size="1">1896</font></a>
  This is rightly observed according to the simple meaning of the letter, by a man who is still in bondage to foul passions. But by one who has already forsaken these dirty acts and impure affections, it must be observed in the spirit, so that he may forsake not only the worship of idols but also all heathen superstitions and the observance of auguries and omens and all signs and days and times, or at any rate that he be not entangled in the conjectures of words and names which destroy the simplicity of our faith. For by fornication of this kind we read that Jerusalem was defiled, as she committed adultery “on every high hill and under every green tree,” <a name="fr_1896"></a><a href="#fn_1896"><font size="1">1897</font></a>
  whom also the Lord rebuked by the prophet, saying: “Let now the astrologers stand and save thee, they that gazed at the stars and counted the months, that from them they might tell the things that shall come to thee,” <a name="fr_1897"></a><a href="#fn_1897"><font size="1">1898</font></a>
  of which fornication elsewhere also  <a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a> <a name="iv.v.v.xi-Page_441"></a>the Lord says in rebuking them: “The spirit of fornication deceived them, and they went a whoring from their God.” <a name="fr_1898"></a><a href="#fn_1898"><font size="1">1899</font></a>
  But one who has forsaken both these kinds of fornication, will have a third kind to avoid, which is contained in the superstitions of the law and of Judaism; of which the Apostle says: “Ye observe days and months and times and years;” and again: Touch not, taste not, handle not.” <a name="fr_1899"></a><a href="#fn_1899"><font size="1">1900</font></a>
  And there is no doubt that this is said of the superstitions of the law, into which one who has fallen has certainly gone a whoring from Christ, and is not worthy to hear this from the Apostle: “For I have espoused you to one husband, to exhibit you as a chaste virgin to Christ.” <a name="fr_1900"></a><a href="#fn_1900"><font size="1">1901</font></a>
  But this that follows will be directed to him by the words of the same Apostle: “But I am afraid lest as the serpent by his cunning deceived Eve, so your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity which is in Christ Jesus.” <a name="fr_1901"></a><a href="#fn_1901"><font size="1">1902</font></a>
  But if one has escaped the uncleanness even of this fornication there will still be a fourth, which is committed by adulterous intercourse with heretical teaching. Of which too the blessed Apostle speaks: “I know that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock, and of yourselves also shall arise men speaking perverse things so as to lead astray the disciples after them.” <a name="fr_1902"></a><a href="#fn_1902"><font size="1">1903</font></a>
  But if a man has succeeded in avoiding even this, let him beware lest he fall by a more subtle sin into the guilt of fornication. I mean that which consists in wandering thoughts, because every thought which is not only shameful but even idle, and departing in however small a degree from God is regarded by the perfect man as the foulest fornication.</p>
