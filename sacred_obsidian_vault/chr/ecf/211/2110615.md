 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.iii.xxiv-p1"></a>Of the difficulty of uniformity in eating; and of the gluttony of brother Benjamin.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.iii.xxiv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.iii.xxiv-p2.1"></a>And</span> so far is this not done without difficulty, that those who know nothing of perfect  <a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.iii.xxiv-Page_318"></a>discretion would rather prolong their fasts for two days, and reserve for tomorrow what they should have eaten today, so that when they come to partake of food they may enjoy as much as they can desire.  And you know that lastly your fellow citizen Benjamin most obstinately stuck to this: as he would not every day partake of his two biscuits, nor, continually take his meagre fare with uniform self-discipline, but preferred always to continue his fasts for two days that when he came to eat he might fill his greedy stomach with a double portion, and by eating four biscuits enjoy a comfortable sense of repletion, and manage to fill his belly by means of a two days fast. And you doubtless remember what sort of an end there was to the life of this man who obstinately and pertinaciously relied on his own judgment rather than on the traditions of the Elders, for he forsook the desert and returned back to the vain philosophy of this world and earthly vanities, and so confirmed the above mentioned opinion of the Elders by the example of his downfall, and by his destruction teaches a lesson that no one who trusts in his own opinion and judgment can possibly climb the heights of perfection, nor fail to be deceived by the dangerous wiles of the devil.</p>
