 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxiv-p1"></a>How we ought not to ask for other things, except only those which are contained in the limits of the Lords Prayer.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxiv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxiv-p2.1"></a>You</span> see then what is the method and form of prayer proposed to us by the Judge Himself, who is to be prayed to by it, a form in which there is contained no petition for riches, no thought of honours, no request for power and might, no mention of bodily health and of temporal life. For He who is the Author of Eternity would have men ask of Him nothing uncertain, nothing paltry, and nothing temporal. And so a man will offer the greatest insult to His Majesty and Bounty, if he leaves on one side these eternal petitions and chooses rather to ask of Him something transitory and uncertain; and will also incur the indignation rather than the propitiation of the Judge by the pettiness of his prayer.</p>
