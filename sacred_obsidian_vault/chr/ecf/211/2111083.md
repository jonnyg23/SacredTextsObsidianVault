 <p> <a name="iv.vi.viii.xxiii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXIII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p1"></a>The answer with the explanation of the saying.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xxiii-p2.1"></a>Abraham</span>: We can prove by the easy teaching of our own experience that our Lord and Saviours saying is perfectly true, if we approach the way of perfection properly and in accordance with Christs will, and mortifying all our desires, and cutting off injurious likings, not only allow nothing to remain with us of this worlds goods (whereby our adversary would find at his pleasure opportunities of destroying and damaging us) but actually recognize that we are not our own masters, and truly make our own the Apostles words: “I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.” <a name="fr_2325"></a><a href="#fn_2325"><font size="1">2326</font></a>
  For what can be burdensome, or hard to one who has embraced with his whole heart the yoke of Christ, who is established in true humility and ever fixes his eye on the Lords sufferings and rejoices in all the wrongs that are offered to him, saying: “For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ: for when I am weak, then am I strong”? <a name="fr_2326"></a><a href="#fn_2326"><font size="1">2327</font></a>
  By what loss of any common thing, I ask, will he be injured, who boasts of perfect renunciation, and voluntarily rejects for Christs sake all the pomp of this world, and considers all and every of its desires as dung, so that he may gain Christ, and by continual meditation on this command of the gospel, scorns and gets rid of agitation at every loss: “For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” <a name="fr_2327"></a><a href="#fn_2327"><font size="1">2328</font></a>
  For the loss of what will he be vexed, who recognizes that everything that can be taken away from others is not their own, and proclaims with unconquered valour: “We brought nothing into this world: it is certain that we cannot carry anything out”? <a name="fr_2328"></a><a href="#fn_2328"><font size="1">2329</font></a>
  By the needs of what want will his courage be overcome, who knows how to do without “scrip for the way, money for the purse,” <a name="fr_2329"></a><a href="#fn_2329"><font size="1">2330</font></a>
  and, like the Apostle, glories “in many fasts, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness”? <a name="fr_2330"></a><a href="#fn_2330"><font size="1">2331</font></a>
  What effort, or what hard command of an Elder can disturb the peace of his bosom, who has no will of his own, and not only patiently but even gratefully accepts what is commanded him, and after the example of our Saviour, seeks to do not his own will, but the Fathers, as He says Himself to His Father: “Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt”? <a name="fr_2331"></a><a href="#fn_2331"><font size="1">2332</font></a>
  By what wrongs also, by what persecution will he be frightened, nay, what punishment can fail to be delightful to him, who always rejoices together with apostles in stripes, and longs to be counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ?</p>
