 <p> <a name="iv.vi.ii.xiii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XIII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p1"></a>The answer.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></a>Piamun</span>: True patience and tranquillity is neither gained nor retained without profound humility of heart: and if it has sprung from this source, there will be no need either of the good offices of the cell or of the refuge of the desert. For it will seek no external support from anything, if it has the internal support of the virtue of humility, its mother and its guardian. But if we are disturbed when attacked by anyone it is clear that the foundations of humility have not been securely laid in us, and therefore at the outbreak even of a small storm, our whole edifice is shaken and ruinously disturbed. For patience would not be worthy of praise and admiration if it only preserved its purposed tranquillity when attacked by no darts of enemies, but it is grand and glorious because when the storms of temptation beat upon it, it remains unmoved. For wherein it is believed that a man is annoyed and hurt by adversity, therein is he strengthened the more; and he is therein the more exercised, wherein he is thought to be annoyed. For everybody knows that patience gets its name from the passions and endurance, and so it is clear that no one can be called patient but one who bears without annoyance all the indignities offered to him, and so it is not without reason that he is praised by Solomon: “Better is the patient <a name="page_485"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 485</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.ii.xiii-Page_485"></a>man than the strong, and he who restrains his anger than he who takes a city;” and again: “For a long-suffering man is mighty in prudence, but a faint-hearted man is very foolish.” <a name="fr_2085"></a><a href="#fn_2085"><font size="1">2086</font></a>
  When then anyone is overcome by a wrong, and blazes up in a fire of anger, we should not hold that the bitterness of the insult offered to him is the <i>cause</i> of his sin, but rather the <i>manifestation</i> of secret weakness, in accordance with the parable of our Lord and Saviour which He spoke about the two houses, <a name="fr_2086"></a><a href="#fn_2086"><font size="1">2087</font></a>
  one of which was founded upon a rock, and the other upon the sand, on both of which He says that the tempest of rain and waters and storm beat equally: but that one which was founded on the solid rock felt no harm at all from the violence of the shock, while that which was built on the shifting and moving sand at once collapsed. And it certainly appears that it fell, not because it was struck by the rush of the storms and torrents, but because it was imprudently built upon the sand. For a saint does not differ from a sinner in this, that he is not himself tempted in the same way, but because he is not worsted even by a great assault, while the other is overcome even by a slight temptation. For the fortitude of any good man would not, as we said, be worthy of praise, if his victory was gained without his being tempted, as most certainly there is no room for victory where there is no struggle and conflict: for “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he has been proved he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love Him.” <a name="fr_2087"></a><a href="#fn_2087"><font size="1">2088</font></a>
  According to the Apostle Paul also “Strength is made perfect” not in ease and delights but “in weakness.” “For behold,” says He, “I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, and to the princes thereof, and to the priests thereof, and to all the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” <a name="fr_2088"></a><a href="#fn_2088"><font size="1">2089</font></a>
