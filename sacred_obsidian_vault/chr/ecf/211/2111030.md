 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.v.xxx-p1"></a>Of the origin and beginning of Lent.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.v.xxx-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.v.xxx-p2.1"></a>Howbeit</span> you should know that as long as the primitive church retained its perfection unbroken, this observance of Lent did not exist. For they were not bound by the requirements of this order, or by any legal enactments, nor confined in the very narrow limits of the fast, as the fast embraced equally the whole year round. But when the multitude of believers began day by day to decline from that apostolic fervour, and to look after their own wealth, and not to portion it out for the good of all the faithful in accordance with  <a name="page_516"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 516</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.v.xxx-Page_516"></a>the arrangement of the apostles, but having an eye to their own private expenses, tried not only to keep it but actually to increase it, not content with following the example of Ananias and Sapphira, then it seemed good to all the priests that men who were hampered by worldly cares, and almost ignorant, if I may say so, of abstinence and contrition, should be recalled to the pious duty by a fast canonically enjoined, and be constrained by the necessity of paying the legal tithes, as this certainly would be good for the weak brethren and could not do any harm to the perfect who were living under the grace of the gospel and by their voluntary devotion going beyond the law, so as to succeed in attaining to the blessedness which the Apostle speaks of: “For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law but under grace.” <a name="fr_2214"></a><a href="#fn_2214"><font size="1">2215</font></a>
  For of a truth sin cannot exercise dominion over one who lives faithfully under the liberty of grace.</p>
