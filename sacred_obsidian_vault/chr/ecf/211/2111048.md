 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.vii.x-p1"></a>How those who are on the way to perfection are truly humble, and feel that they always stand in need of Gods grace.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.vii.x-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.vii.x-p2.1"></a>When</span> then holy men feel that they are oppressed by the weight of earthly thoughts and fall away from their loftiness of mind, and that they are led away against their will or rather without knowing it, into the law of sin and death, and (to pass over other matters) are kept back by those actions which I described above, which are good and right though earthly, from the vision of God; they have something to groan over constantly to the Lord; they have something for which indeed to humble themselves, and in their contrition to profess themselves not in words only but in heart, sinners; and for this, while they continually ask of the Lords grace pardon for everything that day by day they commit when overcome by the weakness of the flesh, they should shed without ceasing true tears of penitence; as they see that being involved even to the very end of their life in the very same troubles, with continual sorrow for which they are tried, they cannot even offer their prayers without harassing thoughts. So then as they know by experience that through the hindrance of the burden of the flesh they cannot by human strength reach the desired end, nor be united according to their hearts desire with that chief and highest good, but that they are led away from the vision of it captive to worldly things, they betake themselves to the grace of God, “Who justifieth the ungodly,” <a name="fr_2263"></a><a href="#fn_2263"><font size="1">2264</font></a>
  and cry out with the Apostle: O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” <a name="fr_2264"></a><a href="#fn_2264"><font size="1">2265</font></a>
  For they feel that they cannot perform the good that they would, but are ever falling into the evil which they would not, and which they hate, i.e., wandering thoughts and care for carnal things.</p>
