 <p> <a name="iv.vi.viii.ix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ix-p0.1"></a>Chapter IX.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ix-p1"></a>That those need not fear the neighbourhood of their kinsfolk, who can emulate the mortification of Abbot Apollos.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ix-p2.1"></a>But</span> that you may be able fairly to measure the amount of your strength by a certain test of strictness I will point out to you what was done by a certain old man; viz., Abbot Apollos <a name="fr_2306"></a><a href="#fn_2306"><font size="1">2307</font></a>
  that if your secret scrutiny of your heart decides that you are not behind this man in purpose and goodness, you may venture on remaining in your country and living near your kinsfolk without detriment to your purpose or injury to your mode of life, and be sure that neither the feeling of nearness nor your love for the district can interfere with the strictness of this humble lot, <a name="fr_2307"></a><a href="#fn_2307"><font size="1">2308</font></a>
  which not only your own will but the needs also of your pilgrimage enforce upon you in this country. When then his own brother had come to this old man, whom we have mentioned, in the dead of night, begging him to come out for a little while from his monastery, to help him to rescue an ox, which as he sadly complained had stuck in the mire of a swamp a little way off, because he could not possibly rescue it alone, Abbot Apollos stolidly replied to his entreaties: “Why did you not ask our younger brother who was nearer to you as you passed by than I?” and when the other, thinking that he had forgotten the death of his brother who had been long ago buried, and that he was almost weak in his mind from excessive abstinence and continual solitude, replied: “How could I summon one who died fifteen years ago?” Abbot Apollos said: “Dont you know that I too have been dead to this world for twenty years, and that I cant from my tomb in this cell give you any assistance in what belongs to the affairs of this present life? And Christ is so far from allowing me ever so little to relax my purpose of mortification on which I have entered, for extricating your ox, that He did not even permit the very shortest intermission of it for my fathers funeral, which would have been undertaken much more readily properly and piously.” And so do ye now search out the secrets of your breast and carefully consider whether you also can continually preserve such strictness of mind with regard to your kinsfolk, and when you find that you are like him in this mortification of soul, then at last you may know that in the same way the neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brothers will not hurt you, when, I mean, you hold that though they are very close to you, you are dead to them, in such a way that you suffer neither them to be benefited by your assistance, nor yourselves to be relaxed by duties towards them.</p>
