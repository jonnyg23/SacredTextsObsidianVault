 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.x-p1"></a>On the best tests of truth.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.x-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.x-p2.1"></a>For</span> I remember, that when my youthful age suggested to me to cling to a partner, thoughts of this sort often mingled with our moral training and the Holy Scriptures, so that we fancied that nothing could be truer or more reasonable: but when we came together and began to produce our ideas, in the general discussion which was held, some things were first noted by the others as false and dangerous, and then presently were condemned and pronounced by common consent to be injurious; though before they had seemed to shine as if with a light infused by the devil, so that they would easily have caused discord, had not the charge of the Elders, observed like some divine oracle, restrained us from all strife, that charge; namely, whereby it was ordered by them almost with the force of a law, that neither of us should trust to his own judgments more than his brothers, if he wanted never to be deceived by the craft of the devil.</p>
