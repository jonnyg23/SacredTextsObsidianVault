 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p1"></a>How a monk ought to avoid women and bishops.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> this is an old maxim of the Fathers that is still current,—though I cannot produce it without shame on my own part, since I could not avoid my own sister, nor escape the hands of the bishop,—viz., that a monk ought by all means to fly from women and bishops.
