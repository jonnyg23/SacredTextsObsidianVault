 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xxi-p1"></a>How the Evangelist John is said to have shown the value of relaxation.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xxi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xxi-p2.1"></a>It</span> is said that the blessed John, while he was gently stroking a partridge with his hands suddenly saw a philosopher approaching him in the garb of a hunter, who was astonished that a man of so great fame and reputation should demean himself to such paltry and trivial amusements, and said: “Can you be that John, whose great and famous reputation attracted me also with the greatest desire for your acquaintance?
