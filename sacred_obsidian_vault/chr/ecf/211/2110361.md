 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxii-p1"></a>The charge which the same Abbot Pinufius gave to a brother whom he admitted into his monastery in our presence.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></a>This</span> old man, then, we afterwards diligently sought out in Egypt because we had been intimate with him in our own monastery; and I propose to insert in this work of mine an exhortation which he gave in our presence to a brother whom he admitted into the monastery, because I think that it may be useful. You know, said he, that after lying for so many days at the entrance you are to-day to be admitted. And to begin with you ought to know the reason of the difficulty put in your way. For it may be of great service to you in this road on which you are desirous to enter, if you understand the method of it and approach the service of Christ accordingly, and as you ought.</p>
