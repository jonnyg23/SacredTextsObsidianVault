 <p> <a name="iv.vi.iv.ix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.iv.ix-p0.1"></a>Chapter IX.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.iv.ix-p1"></a>How valuable to the perfect is the forgetfulness of sin.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.iv.ix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iv.ix-p2.1"></a>But</span> with regard to this that you said a little way back; viz., that you of set purpose go over the recollections of past sins, this ought certainly not to be done, nay, if it forcibly surprises you, it must be at once expelled. For it greatly hinders the soul from the contemplation of purity, and especially in the case of one who is living in solitude, as it entangles him in the stains of this world and swamps him in foul sins. For while you are recalling those things which you did through ignorance or wantonness in accordance with the prince of this world, though I grant you that while you are engaged in these thoughts no delight in them steals in, yet at least the mere taint of the ancient filthiness is sure to corrupt your soul with its foul stink, and to shut out the spiritual fragrance of goodness, i.e., the odour of a sweet savour. When then the recollection of past sins comes over your mind, you must recoil from it just as an honest and upright man runs away if he is sought out in public by an immodest and wanton woman either by words or by embraces. And certainly unless he at once withdraws himself from contact with her, and if he allows himself to linger the very least in impure talk, even if he refuses his consent to the shameful pleasures, yet he cannot avoid the brand of infamy and scorn in the judgment of all the passers by. So then we also, if by noxious recollections we are led to thoughts of this kind, ought at once to desist from dwelling upon them and to fulfil what we are commanded by Solomon: “But go forth,” says he, “do not linger in her place, nor fix thine eye on her;” <a name="fr_2147"></a><a href="#fn_2147"><font size="1">2148</font></a>
  lest if the angels see us taken up with unclean and foul thoughts, they may not be able to say to us in passing by: “The blessing of the Lord be upon you.” <a name="fr_2148"></a><a href="#fn_2148"><font size="1">2149</font></a>
  For it is impossible for the soul to continue in good thoughts, when the main part of the heart is taken up with foul and earthly considerations. For this saying of Solomons is true: “When thine eyes look on a strange woman, then shall thy mouth speak wickedly, and thou shalt lie as it were in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot in a great storm. But thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I felt no pain; and they mocked me, but I felt not.” <a name="fr_2149"></a><a href="#fn_2149"><font size="1">2150</font></a>
  So then we should forsake not only all foul but even all earthly thoughts and ever raise the desires of our soul to heavenly things, in accordance with this saying of our Saviour: “For where I am,” He says, “there also shall My servant be.” <a name="fr_2150"></a><a href="#fn_2150"><font size="1">2151</font></a>
  For it often happens that when anyone out of pity is in thought going over his own falls or those of other faulty persons, he is affected by the delight and assent to this most subtle attack, and that which was undertaken and started with a show of goodness ends with a filthy and damaging termination, for “there are ways which appear to men to be right, but the ends thereof will come to the depths of hell.” <a name="fr_2151"></a><a href="#fn_2151"><font size="1">2152</font></a>
