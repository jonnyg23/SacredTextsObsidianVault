 <p> <a name="iv.vi.iii.vi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vi-p0.1"></a>Chapter VI.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vi-p1"></a>Of the conveniences of the Cœnobium.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vi-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> I will briefly explain what advantages I now enjoy in this manner of life. <i>You</i> must consider my words and judge whether those advantages of the desert outweigh these comforts, and by this you will also be able to prove whether I chose to be cramped within the narrow limits of the Cœnobium from dislike or from desire of that purity of the solitary life. In this life then there is no providing for the days work, no distractions of buying and selling, no unavoidable care for the years food, no anxiety about bodily things, by which one has to get ready what is necessary not only for ones own wants but also for those of any number of visitors, finally no conceit from the praise of men, which is worse than all these things and sometimes in the sight of God does away with the good of even great efforts in the desert. But, to pass over those waves of spiritual pride and the deadly peril of vainglory in the life of the anchorite, let us return to this general burden which affects everybody, i.e., the ordinary anxiety in providing food, which has so far exceeded I say not the measure of that ancient strictness which altogether did without oil, but is beginning not to be content even with the relaxation of our own time according to which the requirements of all the supply of food for a year were satisfied by the preparation of a single pint of oil and a modius of lentils prepared for the use of visitors; but now the needful supply of food is scarcely met by two or three times that amount. And to such an extent has the force of this dangerous relaxation grown among some that, when they mix vinegar and sauce, they do not add that single drop of oil, which our predecessors who followed the rules of the desert with greater powers of abstinence, were accustomed to pour in simply for the sake of avoiding vainglory, <a name="fr_2109"></a><a href="#fn_2109"><font size="1">2110</font></a>
  but they  <a name="page_492"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 492</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iii.vi-Page_492"></a>break an Egyptian cheese for luxury and pour over it more oil than is required, and so take, under a single pleasant relish, two sorts of food which differ in their special flavour, each of which ought singly to be a pleasant refreshment at different times for a monk. To such a pitch however has this <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vi-p3.1"></a>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vi-p3.2"></a>λικὴ κτῆσις</span>, i.e., acquisition of material things grown, that actually under pretence of hospitality and welcoming guests anchorites have begun to keep a blanket in their cells—a thing which I cannot mention without shame—to omit those things by which the mind that is awed by and intent on spiritual meditation is more especially hampered; viz., the concourse of brethren, the duties of receiving the coming and speeding the parting guest, visits to each other and the endless worry of various confabulations and occupations, the expectation of which owing to the continuous character of these customary interruptions keeps the mind on the stretch even during the time when these bothers seem to cease. And so the result is that the freedom of the anchorites life is so hindered by these ties that it can never rise to that ineffable keenness of heart, and thus loses the fruits of its hermit life. And if this is now denied to me while I am living in the congregation and among others, at least there is no lack of peace of mind and tranquillity of heart that is freed from all business. And unless this is ready at hand for those also who live in the desert, they will indeed have to undergo the labours of the anchorites life, but will lose its fruits which can only be gained in peaceful stability of mind. Finally even if there is any diminution of my purity of heart while I am living in the Cœnobium, I shall be satisfied by keeping in exchange that one precept of the Gospel, which certainly cannot be less esteemed than all those fruits of the desert; I mean that I should take no thought for the morrow, and submitting myself completely to the Abbot seem in some degree to emulate</p>
