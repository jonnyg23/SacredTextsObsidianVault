 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.iii.xii-p1"></a>A confession of the modesty which made us ashamed to reveal our thoughts to the elders.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.iii.xii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.iii.xii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: The ground of that hurtful modesty, through which we endeavour to hide bad thoughts, is especially owing to this reason; viz., that we have heard of a superior of the Elders in the region of Syria, as it was believed, who, when one of the brethren had laid bare his thoughts to him in a genuine confession, was afterwards extremely indignant and severely chid him for them. Whence it results that while we press them upon our selves and are ashamed to make them known to the Elders, we cannot obtain the remedies that would heal them.</p>
