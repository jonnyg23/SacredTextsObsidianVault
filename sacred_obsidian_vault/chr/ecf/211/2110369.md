 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xl-p1"></a>That the monk should seek for examples of perfection not from many instances but from one or a very few.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xl-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xl-p2.1"></a>And</span> that you may the more easily arrive at this, the examples of the perfect life of one dwelling in the congregation, which you may imitate, should be sought from a very few or indeed from one or two only and not from too many. For apart from the fact that a life which is tested and refined and purified is only to be found in a few, there is this also to be gained, viz.: that a man is more thoroughly instructed and formed by the example of some <i>one</i>, towards the perfection which he sets before him, viz.: that of the Cœnobite life.</p>
