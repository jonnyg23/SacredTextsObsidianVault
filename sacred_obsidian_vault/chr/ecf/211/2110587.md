 <p> <a name="iv.iv.ii.xx"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.ii.xx-p0.1"></a>Chapter XX.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.ii.xx-p1"></a>About discerning the thoughts, with an illustration from a good money-changer.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ii.xx-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii.xx-p2.1"></a>We</span> ought then carefully to notice this threefold order, and with a wise discretion to analyse the thoughts which arise in our hearts, tracking out their origin and cause and author in the first instance, that we may be able to consider how we ought to yield ourselves to them in accordance with the desert of those who suggest them so that we may, as the Lords command bids us, become good money-changers, <a name="fr_1147"></a><a href="#fn_1147"><font size="1">1148</font></a>
  whose highest skill and whose training is to test what is perfectly pure gold and what is commonly termed <i>tested</i>, <a name="fr_1148"></a><a href="#fn_1148"><font size="1">1149</font></a>
  or what is not sufficiently purified in the fire; and also with unerring skill not to be taken in by a common brass denarius, if by being coloured with bright gold it is made like some coin of great value; and not only shrewdly to recognize coins stamped with the heads of usurpers, but with a still shrewder skill to detect those which have the image of the right king, but are not properly made, and lastly to be careful by the test of the balance to see that they are not under proper weight. All of which  <a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.ii.xx-Page_305"></a>things the gospel saying, which uses this figure, shows us that we ought also to observe spiritually; first that whatever has found an entrance into our hearts, and whatever doctrine has been received by us, should be most carefully examined to see whether it has been purified by the divine and heavenly fire of the Holy Ghost, or whether it belongs to Jewish superstition, or whether it comes from the pride of a worldly philosophy and only externally makes a show of religion. And this we can do, if we carry out the Apostles advice, “Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God.” <a name="fr_1149"></a><a href="#fn_1149"><font size="1">1150</font></a>
  But by this kind those men also are deceived, who after having been professed as monks are enticed by the grace of style, and certain doctrines of philosophers, which at the first blush, owing to some pious meanings not out of harmony with religion, deceive as with the glitter of gold their hearers, whom they have superficially attracted, but render them poor and miserable for ever, like men deceived by false money made of copper: either bringing them back to the bustle of this world, or enticing them into the errors of heretics, and bombastic conceits: a thing which we read of as happening to Achan in the book of Joshua the son of Nun, <a name="fr_1150"></a><a href="#fn_1150"><font size="1">1151</font></a>
  when he coveted a golden weight from the camp of the Philistines, and stole it, and was smitten with a curse and condemned to eternal death. In the second place we should be careful to see that no wrong interpretation fixed on to the pure gold of Scripture deceives us as to the value of the metal: by which means the devil in his craft tried to impose upon our Lord and Saviour as if He was a mere man, when by his malevolent interpretation he perverted what ought to be understood generally of all good men, and tried to fasten it specially on to Him, who had no need of the care of the angels: saying, “For He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, to keep Thee in all Thy ways: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone,” <a name="fr_1151"></a><a href="#fn_1151"><font size="1">1152</font></a>
  by a skilful assumption on his part giving a turn to the precious sayings of Scripture and twisting them into a dangerous sense, the very opposite of their true meaning, so as to offer to us the image and face of an usurper under cover of the gold colour which may deceive us. Or whether he tries to cheat us with counterfeits, for instance by urging that some work of piety should be taken up which as it does come from the true minds of the fathers, leads under the form of virtue to vice; and, deceiving us either by immoderate or impossible fasts, or by too long vigils, or inordinate prayers, or unsuitable reading, brings us to a bad end. Or, when he persuades us to give ourselves up to mixing in the affairs of others, and to pious visits, by which he may drive us away from the spiritual cloisters of the monastery, and the secrecy of its friendly peacefulness, and suggests that we take on our shoulders the anxieties and cares of religious women who are in want, that when a monk is inextricably entangled in snares of this sort he may distract him with most injurious occupations and cares. Or else when he incites a man to desire the holy office of the clergy under the pretext of edifying many people, and the love of spiritual gain, by which to draw us away from the humility and strictness of our life. All of which things, although they are opposed to our salvation and to our profession, yet when covered with a sort of veil of compassion and religion, easily deceive those who are lacking in skill and care. For they imitate the coins of the true king, because they seem at first full of piety, but are not stamped by those who have the right to coin, i.e., the approved Catholic fathers, nor do they proceed from the head public office for receiving them, but are made by stealth and by the fraud of the devil, and palmed off upon the unskilful and ignorant not without serious harm. And even although they seem to be useful and needful at first, yet if afterwards they begin to interfere with the soundness of our profession, and as it were to weaken in some sense the whole body of our purpose, it is well that they should be cut off and cast away from us like a member which may be necessary, but yet offends us and which seems to perform the office of the right hand or foot. For it is better, without one member of a command, i.e., its working or result, to continue safe and sound in other parts, and to enter as weak into the kingdom of heaven rather than with the whole mass of commands to fall into some error which by an evil custom separates us from our strict rule and the system purposed and entered upon, and leads to such loss, that it will never outweigh the harm that will follow, but will cause all our past fruits and the whole body of our work to be burnt in hell fire. <a name="fr_1152"></a><a href="#fn_1152"><font size="1">1153</font></a>
  Of which kind of illusions it is well said in the Proverbs: “There are ways which seem to be right to a man, but their latter end will come into the depths of hell,” <a name="fr_1153"></a><a href="#fn_1153"><font size="1">1154</font></a>
  and again “An evil man is harmful when he attaches himself to a good man,” <a name="fr_1154"></a><a href="#fn_1154"><font size="1">1155</font></a>
   <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.ii.xx-Page_306"></a>i.e., the devil deceives when he is covered with an appearance of sanctity: “but he hates the sound of the watchman,” <a name="fr_1155"></a><a href="#fn_1155"><font size="1">1156</font></a>
  i.e., the power of discretion which comes from the words and warnings of the fathers.</p>
