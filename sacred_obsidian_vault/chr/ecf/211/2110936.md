 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.xvi-p1"></a>The answer that Scripture truth is not to be altered on account of an offence given to the weak.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.xvi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.xvi-p2.1"></a>Joseph</span>: Occasions and opportunities for destroying themselves cannot possibly be wanting to those who are on the road to ruin, or rather who are anxious to destroy themselves; nor are those passages of Scripture to be rejected and altogether torn out of the volume, by which the perversity of heretics is encouraged, or the unbelief of the Jews increased, or the pride of heathen wisdom offended; but surely they are to be piously believed, and firmly held, and preached according to the rule of truth. And therefore we should not, because of anothers unbelief, reject the <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.v.viii.xvi-p2.2"></a>οἰκονομίας</span>, i.e., the “economy” of the prophets and saints which Scripture relates, lest while we are thinking that we ought to condescend to their infirmities, we stain ourselves with the sin not only of lying but of sacrilege. But, as we said, we ought to admit these according to the letter, and explain how they were rightly done. But for those who are wrongly disposed, the opening for lies will not be blocked up by this means, if we are trying either altogether to deny or to explain away by allegorical interpretations the truth of those things which we are going to bring forward or have already brought forward. For how will the authority of these passages injure them if their corrupt will is alone sufficient to lead them to sin?</p>
