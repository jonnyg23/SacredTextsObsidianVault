 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxiii-p1"></a>That idleness is the reason why there are not monasteries for monks in the West.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxiii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxiii-p2.1"></a>Hence</span> it is that in these countries we see no monasteries found with such numbers of brethren: for they are not supported by the resources of their own labour in such a way that they can remain in them continually; and if in some way or other, through the liberality of another, there should be a sufficient provision to supply them, yet love of ease and restlessness of heart does not suffer them to continue long in the place. Whence this saying has been handed down from the old fathers in Egypt: that a monk who works is attacked by but one devil; but an idler is tormented by countless spirits.</p>
