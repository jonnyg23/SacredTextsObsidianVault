 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.ii.xii-p1"></a>A question on perseverance in spiritual contemplation.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ii.xii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii.xii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>. Who then, while he is burdened with our frail flesh, can be always so intent on this contemplation, as never to think about the arrival of a brother, or visiting the sick, or manual labour, or at least about showing kindness to strangers and visitors?
