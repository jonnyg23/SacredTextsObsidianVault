 <p> <a name="iv.iv.vii.iii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.vii.iii-p0.1"></a>Chapter III.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.vii.iii-p1"></a>Of the three kinds of things there are in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.vii.iii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vii.iii-p2.1"></a>Altogether</span> there are three kinds of things in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent. And so we ought to know what is properly good, and what is bad, and what is indifferent, that our faith may be supported by true knowledge and stand firm in all temptations. We must then believe that in things which  <a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.vii.iii-Page_353"></a>are merely human there is no real good except virtue of soul alone, which leads us with unfeigned faith to things divine, and makes us constantly adhere to that unchanging good. And on the other hand we ought not to call anything bad, except sin alone, which separates us from the good God, and unites us to the evil devil. But those things are indifferent which can be appropriated to either side according to the fancy or wish of their owner, as for instance riches, power, honour, bodily strength, good health, beauty, life itself, and death, poverty, bodily infirmities, injuries, and other things of the same sort, which can contribute either to good or to evil as the character and fancy of their owner directs. For riches are often serviceable for our good, as the Apostle says, who charges “the rich of this world to be ready to give, to distribute to the needy, to lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that” by this means “they may lay hold on the true life.” <a name="fr_1370"></a><a href="#fn_1370"><font size="1">1371</font></a>
  And according to the gospel they are a good thing for those who “make to themselves friends of the unrighteous mammon.” <a name="fr_1371"></a><a href="#fn_1371"><font size="1">1372</font></a>
  And again, they can be drawn in the direction of what is bad when they are amassed only for the sake of hoarding them or for a life of luxury, and are not employed to meet the wants of the poor. And that power also and honour and bodily strength and good health are indifferent and available for either (good or bad) can easily be shown from the fact that many of the Old Testament saints enjoyed all these things and were in positions of great wealth and the highest honour, and blessed with bodily strength, and yet are known to have been most acceptable to God. And on the contrary those who have wrongfully abused these things and perverted them for their own purposes are not without good reason punished or destroyed, as the Book of Kings shows us has often happened. And that even life and death are in themselves indifferent the birth of S. John and of Judas proves. For in the case of the one his life was so profitable to himself that we are told that his birth brought joy to others also, as we read “And many shall rejoice at his birth;” <a name="fr_1372"></a><a href="#fn_1372"><font size="1">1373</font></a>
  but of the life of the other it is said: “It were good for that man if he had never been born.” <a name="fr_1373"></a><a href="#fn_1373"><font size="1">1374</font></a>
  Further it is said of the death of John and of all saints “Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints:” <a name="fr_1374"></a><a href="#fn_1374"><font size="1">1375</font></a>
  but of that of Judas and men like him “The death of the wicked is very evil.” <a name="fr_1375"></a><a href="#fn_1375"><font size="1">1376</font></a>
  And how useful bodily sickness sometimes may be the blessing on Lazarus, the beggar who was full of sores, shows us. For Scripture makes mention of no other good qualities or deserts of his, but it was for this fact alone; viz., that he endured want and bodily sickness with the utmost patience, that he was deemed worthy of the blessed lot of a place in Abrahams bosom. <a name="fr_1376"></a><a href="#fn_1376"><font size="1">1377</font></a>
  And with regard to want and persecution and injuries which everybody thinks to be bad, how useful and necessary they are is clearly proved by this fact; viz., that the saints not only never tried to avoid them, but actually either sought them with all their powers or bravely endured them, and thus became the friends of God, and obtained the reward of eternal life, as the blessed Apostle chants: “For which cause I delight myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong, for power is made perfect in infirmity.” <a name="fr_1377"></a><a href="#fn_1377"><font size="1">1378</font></a>
  And therefore those who are exalted with the greatest riches and honours and powers of this world, should not be deemed to have secured their chief good out of them (for this is shown to consist only in virtue) but only something indifferent, because just as to good men who use them well and properly they will be found to be useful and convenient (for they afford them opportunities for good works and fruits which shall endure to eternal life), so to those who wrongfully abuse their wealth, they are useless and out of place, and furnish occasions of sin and death.</p>
