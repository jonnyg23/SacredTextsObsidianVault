 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.vi.vii-p1"></a>How vainglory and pride can be consummated without any assistance from the body.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.vi.vii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vi.vii-p2.1"></a>And</span> to go on in the order which we proposed, with our account of the way in which the other passions act (our analysis of which was obliged to be interrupted by this account of gluttony and of the Lords temptation) vainglory and pride can be consummated even without the slightest assistance from the body. For in what way do those passions need any action of the flesh, which bring ample destruction on the soul they take captive simply by its assent and wish to gain praise and glory from men? Or what act on the part of the body was there in that pride of old in the case of the above mentioned Lucifer; as he only conceived it in his heart and mind, as the prophet tells us: “Who saidst in thine heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of God. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the most High.” <a name="fr_1326"></a><a href="#fn_1326"><font size="1">1327</font></a>
  And just as he had no one to stir him up to this pride, so his thoughts alone were the authors of the sin when complete and of his eternal fall; especially as no exercise of the dominion at which he aimed followed.</p>
