 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-p1"></a>How the fear of the Lord is our cross.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-p2.1"></a>The</span> fear of the Lord is our cross. As then one who is crucified no longer has the power of moving or turning his limbs in any direc<a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-Page_231"></a>tion as he pleases, so we also ought to affix our wishes and desires—not in accordance with what is pleasant and delightful to us now, but in accordance with the law of the Lord, where it constrains us. And as he who is fastened to the wood of the cross no longer considers things present, nor thinks about his likings, nor is perplexed by anxiety and care for the morrow, nor disturbed by any desire of possession, nor inflamed by any pride or strife or rivalry, grieves not at present injuries, remembers not past ones, and while he is still breathing in the body considers that he is dead to all earthly things, <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">800</font></a>
  sending the thoughts of his heart on before to that place whither he doubts not that he is shortly to come: so we also, when crucified by the fear of the Lord ought to be dead indeed to all these things, i.e. not only to carnal vices but also to all earthly things, <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">801</font></a>
  having the eye of our minds fixed there whither we hope at each moment that we are soon to pass. For in this way we can have all our desires and carnal affections mortified.</p>
