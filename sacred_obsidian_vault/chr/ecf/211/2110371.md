 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xlii-p1"></a>How a monk should not look for the blessing of patience in his own case as a result of the virtue of others, but rather as a consequence of his own longsuffering.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xlii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xlii-p2.1"></a>You</span> should therefore not look for patience in your own case from the virtue of others, thinking that then only can you secure it when you are not irritated by any (for it is not in your own power to prevent this from happening); but rather you should look for it as the consequence of your own humility and long-suffering which <i>does</i> depend on your own will.</p>
