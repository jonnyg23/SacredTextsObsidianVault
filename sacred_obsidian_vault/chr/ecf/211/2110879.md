 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.v.xix-p1"></a>How often even those who are not worthy can receive the grace of the saving word.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.v.xix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.v.xix-p2.1"></a>But</span> sometimes in the lavish generosity of God in His Providence, “Who willeth all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth,” <a name="fr_1936"></a><a href="#fn_1936"><font size="1">1937</font></a>
