 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxviii-p1"></a>How it was revealed to the Abbot concerning Patermucius that he had done the deed of Abraham; and how when the same Abbot died, Patermucius succeeded to the charge of the monastery.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxviii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></a>And</span> this mans faith and devotion was so acceptable to God that it was immediately approved by a divine testimony. For it was forthwith revealed to the Superior that by this obedience of his he had copied the deed of the patriarch Abraham. And when shortly afterwards the same Abbot of the monastery departed out of this life to Christ, he preferred him to all the brethren, and left him as his successor and as Abbot to the monastery.</p>
