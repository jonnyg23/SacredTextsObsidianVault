 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxx-p1"></a>That no determination should be made on those things which concern the needs of the common life.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxx-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxx-p2.1"></a>And</span> therefore a monk ought not hastily to make any promise on those things which merely concern bodily exercise, for fear lest he may stir up the enemy still more to attack what he is keeping as it were under the observance of the law, and so he may be more readily compelled to break it. Since every one who lives under the grace of liberty, and sets himself a law, thereby binds himself in a dangerous slavery, so that if by chance necessity constrains him to do what he might have ventured on lawfully, and indeed laudably and with thanksgiving, he is forced to act as a transgressor, and to fall into sin: “for where there is no law there is no transgression.” <a name="fr_2067"></a><a href="#fn_2067"><font size="1">2068</font></a>

 <p><a name="iv.v.viii.xxx-p4"></a>By this instruction and the teaching of the blessed Joseph we were confirmed as by a Divine oracle and made up our minds to stop in Egypt. But though henceforward we were but a little anxious about our promise, yet when seven years were over we were very glad to fulfil it. For we hastened to our monastery, at a time when we were confident of obtaining permission to return to the desert, and first paid our respects properly to our Elders; next we revived the former love in their minds as out of the ardour of their love they had not been at all softened by our very frequent letters to satisfy them, and in the last place, we entirely removed the sting of our broken promise and returned to the recesses of the desert of Scete, as they themselves forwarded us with joy.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.v.viii.xxx-p5"></a>This learning and doctrine of the illustrious fathers, our ignorance, O holy brother, has to the best of its ability made plain to you. And if perhaps our clumsy style has confused it instead of setting it in order, I trust that the blame which our clumsiness deserves will not interfere with the praise due to these grand <a name="page_474"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 474</font></a> <a name="iv.v.viii.xxx-Page_474"></a>men. Since it seemed to us a safer course in the sight of our Judge to state even in unadorned style this splendid doctrine rather than to hold our tongues about it, since if he considers the grandeur of the thoughts, the fact that the awkwardness of our style annoys him, need not be prejudicial to the profit of the reader, and for our part we are more anxious about its usefulness than its being praised. This at least I charge all those into whose hand this little book may fall; viz., that they must know that whatever in it pleases them belongs to the fathers, and whatever they dislike is all our own. <a name="fr_2068"></a><a href="#fn_2068"><font size="1">2069</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.v.viii.xxx-p6"></a> In this last chapter Cassian certainly makes his own the sentiments of Abbot Joseph on the permissibility of lying; and is therefore not unreasonably attacked for the teaching of this Conference by Prosper. “Contra Collatorem,” c. ix.</p>
