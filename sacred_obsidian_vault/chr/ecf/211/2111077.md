 <p> <a name="iv.vi.viii.xvii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XVII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p1"></a>How the weaker part of the soul is the first to yield to the devils temptations.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p2.1"></a>You</span> should then apply to this member or part of the soul which we have described as particularly wounded, the remedy of true humility: for as, so far as appears, it is weaker than the other powers of the soul in you, it is sure to be the first to yield to the assaults of the devil. As when some injuries come upon us, which are caused either by toil laid upon us or by a bad atmosphere, it is generally the case in the bodies of men that those which are the weaker are the first to give in and yield to those chances, and when the disease has more particularly laid hold <a name="page_539"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 539</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.viii.xvii-Page_539"></a>of them, it affects the sound parts of the body also with the same mischief, so also, when the pestilent blast of sin breathes over us the soul of each one of us is sure to be tempted above all by that passion, in the case of which its feebler and weaker portion does not make so stubborn a resistance to the powerful attacks of the foe, and to run the risk of being taken captive by those, in the case of which a careless watch opens an easier way to betrayal. For so Balsam <a name="fr_2315"></a><a href="#fn_2315"><font size="1">2316</font></a>
  gathered that Gods people could be by a sure method deceived, when he advised, that in that quarter, wherein he knew that the children of Israel were weak, the dangerous snares should be set for them, as he had no doubt that when a supply of women was offered to them, they would at once fall and be destroyed by fornication, because he was aware that the parts of their souls which were subject to desire were corrupted. So then the spiritual wickednesses tempt with crafty malice each one of us, by particularly laying insidious snares for those affections of the soul, in which they have seen that it is weak, as for instance, if they see that the reasonable parts of our soul are affected, they try to deceive us in the same way that the Scripture tells us that king Ahab was deceived by those Syrians, who said: “We know that the kings of Israel are merciful: And so let us put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes round our heads, and go out to the king of Israel, and say to him: Thy servant Benhadad saith: I pray thee, let my soul live.” And thereby he was affected by no true goodness, but by the empty praise of his clemency, and said: “If he still liveth, he is my brother;” and after this fashion they can deceive us also by the error of that reasonable part, and make us incur the displeasure of God owing to that from which we were hoping that we might gain a reward and receive the recompense of goodness, and to us too the same rebuke may be addressed: “Because thou hast let go from thy hand a man who was worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his people” <a name="fr_2316"></a><a href="#fn_2316"><font size="1">2317</font></a>
  Or when the unclean spirit says: “I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets,” <a name="fr_2317"></a><a href="#fn_2317"><font size="1">2318</font></a>
  he certainly spread the nets of deception by means of the reasonable feeling which he knew to be exposed to his deadly wiles. And this also the same spirit expected in the case of our Lord, when he tempted Him in these three affections of the soul, wherein he knew that all mankind had been taken captive, but gained nothing by his crafty wiles. For he approached that portion of his mind which was subject to desire, when he said: “Command that these stones be made bread;” the part subject to wrath, when he tried to incite Him to seek the power of the present life and the kingdoms of this world; the reasonable part when he said: “If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down from hence.” <a name="fr_2318"></a><a href="#fn_2318"><font size="1">2319</font></a>
  And in these his deception availed nothing for this reason because he found that there was nothing damaged in Him, in accordance with the supposition which he had formed from a false idea. Wherefore no part of His soul yielded when tempted by the wiles of the foe, “For lo,” He saith, “the prince of this world cometh and shall find nothing in Me.” <a name="fr_2319"></a><a href="#fn_2319"><font size="1">2320</font></a>
