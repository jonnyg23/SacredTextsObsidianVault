 <p> <a name="iv.iv.xi.iv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.xi.iv-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.xi.iv-p1"></a>Of our return to Abbot Isaac and question concerning the error into which the aforesaid old man had fallen.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.xi.iv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.xi.iv-p2.1"></a>Although</span> even besides the fresh matter which has lately arisen, our delight in the former conference which was held on the character of prayer would summon us to postpone everything else and return to your holiness, yet this grievous error of Abbot Sarapion, conceived, as we fancy, by the craft of most vile demons, adds somewhat to this desire of ours. For it is no small despair by which we are cast down when we consider that through the fault of this ignorance he has not only utterly lost all those labours which he has performed in so praiseworthy a manner for fifty years in this desert, but has also incurred the risk of eternal death. And so we want first to know why and wherefore so grievous an error has crept into him. And next we should like to be taught how we can arrive at that condition in prayer, of which you discoursed some time back not only fully but splendidly. For that admirable Con<a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 403</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.xi.iv-Page_403"></a>ference has had this effect upon us, that it has only dazzled our minds and has not shown us how to perform or secure it.</p>
