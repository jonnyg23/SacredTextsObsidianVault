 <p> <a name="iv.vi.vii.xii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xii-p1"></a>Of this also: “But we know that the law is spiritual,” etc.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xii-p2.1"></a>And</span> this law the Apostle also calls spiritual saying: “But we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.” <a name="fr_2268"></a><a href="#fn_2268"><font size="1">2269</font></a>
  For this law is spiritual which bids us eat in the sweat of our brow that “true bread which cometh down from heaven” <a name="fr_2269"></a><a href="#fn_2269"><font size="1">2270</font></a>
  but that sale under sin makes us carnal. What, I ask, or whose is that sin? Doubtless Adams, by whose fall and, if I may so say, ruinous transaction and fraudulent bargain we were sold. For when he was led astray by the persuasion of the serpent he brought all his descendants under the yoke of perpetual bondage, as they were alienated by taking the forbidden food. For this custom is generally observed between the buyer and seller, that one who wants to make himself over to the power of another, receives from his buyer a price for the loss of his liberty, and his consignment to perpetual slavery. And we can very plainly see that this took place between Adam and the serpent. For by eating of the forbidden tree he received from the serpent the price of his liberty, and gave up his natural freedom and chose to give himself up to perpetual slavery to him from whom he had obtained the deadly price of the forbidden fruit; and thenceforth he was bound by this condition and not without reason subjected all the offspring of his posterity to perpetual service to him whose slave he had become. For what can any marriage in slavery produce but slaves? What then? Did that cunning and crafty buyer take away the rights of ownership from the true and lawful lord? Not so. For neither did he overcome all Gods property by the craft of a single act of deception so that the true lord lost his rights of ownership, who though the buyer himself was a rebel and a renegade, yet oppressed him with the yoke of slavery; but because the Creator had endowed all reasonable creatures with free will, he would not restore to their natural liberty against their will those who contrary to right had sold themselves by the sin of greedy lust. Since anything that is contrary to goodness and fairness is abhorrent to Him who is the Author of justice and piety. For it would have been wrong for Him to have recalled the blessing of freedom granted, unfair for Him to have by His power oppressed man who was free, and by taking him captive, not to have allowed him to exercise the prerogative of the freedom he had received, as He was reserving his salvation for future ages, that in due season the fulness of the appointed time might be fulfilled. For it was right that his offspring should remain under the ancient conditions for so long a time, until by the price of His own blood the grace of the Lord redeemed them from their original chains and set them free in the primeval state of liberty, though He was able even then to save them, but would not, because equity forbade Him to break the terms of His own decree. Would you know the reason for your being sold? Hear thy Redeemer Himself proclaiming openly by Isaiah the prophet: “What is this bill of the divorce of your mother with which I have put her away? Or who is My creditor to whom I sold you? Behold you are sold for your iniquities and for your wicked deeds have I put your mother away.” Would you also plainly see why when you were consigned to the yoke of slavery He would not redeem you by the might of His own power? Hear what He added to the former passage, and how He charges the same servants of sin with the reason for their voluntary sale. “Is My hand shortened and become little that I cannot redeem, or is there no strength in Me to deliver?” <a name="fr_2270"></a><a href="#fn_2270"><font size="1">2271</font></a>
  But what it is which is always standing in the way of His most powerful pity the same prophet shows when he says: “Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save, neither is His ear heavy that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have divided between you and your God and your sins have hid His face from you that He should not hear.” <a name="fr_2271"></a><a href="#fn_2271"><font size="1">2272</font></a>
