 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vi.v-p1"></a>Of the cure of a lame man which the same saint wrought.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vi.v-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vi.v-p2.1"></a>Or</span> when the same man as he went to a village was surrounded by mocking crowds, who sneered at him and showed him a man who was for many years deprived of the power of walking from a contracted knee, and crawled from a weakness of long standing, they tempted him and said, “Show us, father Abraham, if you are the servant of God, and restore this man to his former health, that we may believe that the name of Christ, whom you worship, is not vain.” Then he at once invoked the name of Christ, and stooped down and laid hold of the mans withered foot and pulled it. And immediately at his touch the dried and bent knee was straightened, and he got back the use of his legs, which he had forgotten how to use in his long years of weakness, and went away rejoicing.</p>
