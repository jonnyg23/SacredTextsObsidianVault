 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.vi.i.xlii-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.vi.i.xlii-p1.1"></a>In</span> his room Abiud his son held the kingdom at Jerusalem for six years, although he is said in the Chronicles <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">314</font></a>
  to have reigned three years. Asab his son succeeded him, being the fifth from David, as he was his great-great-grandson. He was a pious worshiper of God; for, destroying the altars and the groves of the idols, he removed the traces of his fathers faithlessness. He formed an alliance with the king of Syria, and by his help inflicted much loss on the kingdom of Jeroboam, which was then held by his son, and often, after conquering the enemy, carried off spoil as the result of victory. After forty-one years he died, afflicted with disease in his feet. To him sin of a three-fold kind is ascribed; first, that he trusted too much to his alliance with the king of Syria; secondly, that he cast into prison a prophet of God who rebuked him for this; and thirdly, that, when suffering from disease in his feet, he sought a remedy, not from God, but from the physicians. In the beginning of his reign died Jeroboam, king of the ten tribes, and left his throne to his son Nabath. He, from his wicked works, and, both by his own and his <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">315</font></a>
  fathers doings, hateful to God, did not possess the kingdom more than two years, and his children, as being unworthy, were deprived <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">316</font></a>
  of the government. He had for his successor Baasa, the son of Achia, and he proved himself equally estranged from God. He died in the twenty-sixth year of his reign: and his power passed to Ela his son, but was not retained more than two years. For Zambri, leader of his cavalry, killed him at a banquet, and seized the kingdom,—a man equally odious to God and men. A portion of the people revolted from him, and the royal power was conferred on one Thamnis. But Zambri reigned before him seven years, and at the same time with him twelve years. And, on the death of Asab, Josaphat his son began to reign over part of the tribe of Judah, a man deservedly famous for his pious virtues. He lived at peace with Zambri; and he died, after a reign of twenty-five years.</p>
