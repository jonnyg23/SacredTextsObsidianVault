 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.vii-p1"></a>A question why the neighbourhood of our kinsfolk is considered to interfere with us, whereas it does not interfere in the case of those living in Egypt.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.vii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.vii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: It is a very useful and needful rule that is given for the kind of works that can be done within the cells. For we have often proved the value of this not only by the example of your holiness, based on the imitation of the virtues of the apostles, but also by our own experience. But it is not sufficiently clear why we ought so thoroughly to avoid the neighbourhood of our kinsfolk, which you did not reject altogether. For if we see you, blamelessly walking in all the way of perfection, and not only dwelling in your own country but some of you having not even retired far from their own village, why should that which does not hurt you be considered bad for us?</p>
