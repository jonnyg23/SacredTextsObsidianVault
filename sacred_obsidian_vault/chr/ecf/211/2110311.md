 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.ii.xiv-p1"></a>Of the way in which they devote themselves in their cells equally to manual labour and to prayer.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.ii.xiv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.ii.xiv-p2.1"></a>And</span> therefore they supplement their prayer by the addition of labour, lest slumber might steal upon them as idlers. For as they scarcely enjoy any time of leisure, so there is no limit put to their spiritual meditations. For practising equally the virtues of the body and of the soul, they balance what is due to the outer by what is profitable to the inner man; <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">707</font></a>
