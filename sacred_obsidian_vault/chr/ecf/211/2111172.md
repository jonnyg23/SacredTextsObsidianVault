 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.vii.xxi-p1"></a>The authority of Holy Scripture teaches that Christ existed from all eternity.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.vii.xxi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.vii.xxi-p2.1"></a>And</span> yet to return to what we said before, though all these things are so, as we have stated: how do we read that Jesus Christ (whom you assert to be a mere man) was ever existing even before His birth of a Virgin, and how is He proclaimed by prophets and apostles as God even before the worlds? As Paul says: “One Lord Jesus, through whom are all things.” <a name="fr_2578"></a><a href="#fn_2578"><font size="1">2579</font></a>
  And elsewhere he says: “For in Christ were created all things in heaven and on earth, both visible and invisible.” <a name="fr_2579"></a><a href="#fn_2579"><font size="1">2580</font></a>
  The  <a name="page_602"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 602</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.vii.xxi-Page_602"></a>Creed too, which is framed both by human and Divine authority, says: “I believe in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son.” And after other clauses: “Very God of Very God; by whom both the worlds were framed and all things were made.” And further: “Who for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary, and was crucified, and was buried.”</p>
