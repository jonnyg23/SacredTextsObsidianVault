 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xxxi-p1"></a>That no one can get the better of covetousness unless he stays in the Cœnobium: and how one can remain there.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xxxi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xxxi-p2.1"></a>But</span> we shall certainly not be suffered to do this, nor even to remain under the rule of a system, unless the virtue of patience, which can only spring from humility as its source, is first securely fixed and established in us. For the one teaches us not to trouble any one else; the other, to endure with magnanimity wrongs offered to us.</p>
