 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.viii.vii-p1"></a>Of the only case in which anger is useful to us.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.viii.vii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.viii.vii-p2.1"></a>We</span> have, it must be admitted, a use for anger excellently implanted in us for which alone it is useful and profitable for us to admit it, viz., when we are indignant and rage against the lustful emotions of our heart, and are vexed that the things which we are ashamed to do or say before men have risen up in the lurking places of our heart, as we tremble at the presence of the angels, and of God Himself, who pervades all things everywhere, and fear with the utmost dread the eye of Him from whom the secrets of our hearts cannot possibly be hid.</p>
