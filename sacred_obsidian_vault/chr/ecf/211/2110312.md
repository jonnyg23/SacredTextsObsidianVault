 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.ii.xv-p1"></a>Of the discreet rule by which every one must retire to his cell after the close of the prayers; and <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">708</font></a>
  of the rebuke to which any one who does otherwise is subject.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.ii.xv-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.ii.xv-p3.1"></a>And</span> so, when the Psalms are finished, and the daily assembly, as we said above, is broken up, none of them dares to loiter ever so little or to gossip with another: nor does he presume even to leave his cell throughout the whole day, or to forsake the work which he is wont to carry on in it, except when they happen to be called out for the performance of some necessary duty, which they fulfil by going out of doors so that there may not be any chattering at all among them. But every one does the work assigned to him in such a way that, by repeating by heart some Psalm or passage of Scripture, he gives no opportunity or time for dangerous schemes or evil designs, or even for idle talk, as both mouth and heart are incessantly taken up with spiritual meditations. For they are most particular in observing this rule, that none of them, and especially of the younger ones, may be caught stopping even for a moment or going anywhere together with another, or holding his hands in his. But, if they discover any who in defiance of the discipline of this rule have perpetrated any of these forbidden things, they pronounce them guilty of no slight fault, as contumacious and disobedient to the rules; nor are they free from suspicion of plotting and nefarious designs. And, unless they expiate their fault by public penance when all the brethren are gathered together, none of them is allowed to be present at the prayers of the brethren.</p>
