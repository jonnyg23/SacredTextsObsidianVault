 <p> <a name="ii.iv.iii.iv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="ii.iv.iii.iv-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.</h4>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.iv.iii.iv-p1"></a>“<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></a>You</span> knew the too barbarous and, beyond measure, bloody ferocity of Avitianus, a former courtier. He enters the city of the Turones with a furious spirit, while rows of people, laden with chains, followed him with melancholy looks, orders various kinds of punishments to be got ready for slaying them; and to the grave amazement of the city, he arranges them for the sad work on the following day. When this became known to Martin, he set out all alone, a little before midnight, for the palace of that beast. But when, in the silence of the depths of the night, and as all were at rest, no entrance was possible through the bolted doors, he lays himself down before that cruel threshold. In the meantime, Avitianus, buried in deep sleep, is smitten by an assailing angel, who says to him, Does the servant of God lie at your threshold, and do you continue sleeping? He, on listening to these words, rises, in much disturbance, from his bed; and calling his servants, he exclaims  <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.iii.iv-Page_48"></a>in terror, Martin is at the door: go immediately, and undo the bolts, that the servant of God may suffer no harm. But they, in accordance with the tendency of all servants, having scarcely stepped beyond the first threshold, and laughing at their master as having been mocked by a dream, affirm that there was no one at the door. This they did as simply inferring from their own disposition, that no one could be keeping watch through the night, while far less did they believe that a priest was lying at the threshold of another man during the horror of that night. Well, they easily persuaded Avitianus of the truth of their story. He again sinks into sleep; but, being ere long struck with greater violence than before, he exclaimed that Martin <i>was</i> standing at the door, and that, therefore, no rest either of mind or body was allowed him. As the servants delayed, he himself went forward to the outer threshold; and there he found Martin, as he had thought he would. The wretched man, struck by the display of so great excellence, exclaimed, Why, sir, have you done this to me? There is no need for you to speak: I know what you wish: I see what you require: depart as quickly as possible, lest the anger of heaven consume me on account of the injury done you: I have already suffered sufficient punishment. Believe me, that I have firmly determined in my own mind how I should now proceed. So then, after the departure of the holy man, he calls for his officials and orders all the prisoners to be set free, while presently he himself went his way. Thus Avitianus being put to flight, the city rejoiced, and felt at liberty.</p>
