 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xx-p1"></a>How contemptible it is to be overcome by covetousness.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xx-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xx-p2.1"></a>And</span> so if we want to strive lawfully in our spiritual combat, let us expel this dangerous enemy also from our hearts. For to overcome him does not so much show great virtue, as to be beaten by him is shameful and disgraceful. For when you are overpowered by a strong man, though there is grief in being overthrown, and distress at the loss of victory, yet some consolation may be derived by the vanquished  <a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.vii.xx-Page_255"></a>from the strength of their opponent. But if the enemy is a poor creature, and the struggle a feeble one, besides the grief for defeat there is confusion of a more disgraceful character, and a shame which is worse than loss.</p>
