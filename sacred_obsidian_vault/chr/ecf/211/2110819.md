 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.xi.xii-p1"></a>A question as to how spiritual thoughts can be retained without losing them.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.xi.xii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.xi.xii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: We think that you have described to us not only the system of this spiritual discipline for which we asked, but perfection itself; and this with great clearness and openness. For what can be more perfect and sublime than for the recollection of God to be embraced in so brief a meditation, and for it, dwelling on a single verse, to escape from all the limitations of things visible, and to comprise in one short word the thoughts of all our prayers. And therefore we beg you to explain to us one thing which still remains; viz., how we can keep firm hold of this verse which you have given us as a formula, in such a way that, as we have been by Gods grace set free from the trifles of worldly thoughts, so we may also keep a steady grasp on all spiritual ones.</p>
