 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.iv.xx-p1"></a>That nothing can be done in this world without God.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.iv.xx-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.iv.xx-p2.1"></a>But</span> it is right for us to hold with unswerving faith that nothing whatever is done in this world without God. For we must acknowledge that everything is done either by His will or by His permission, i.e., we must believe that whatever is good is carried out by the will of God and by His aid, and whatever is the reverse is done by His permission, when the Divine Protection is withdrawn from us for our sins and the hardness of our hearts, and suffers the devil and the shameful passions of the body to lord it over us. And the words of the Apostle most assuredly teach us this, when he says: “For this cause God delivered them up to shameful passions:” and again: “Because they did not like to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient.” <a name="fr_1280"></a><a href="#fn_1280"><font size="1">1281</font></a>
  And the Lord Himself says by the prophet: “But My people did not hear My voice and Israel did not obey me: Wherefore I gave them up unto their own hearts lusts. They shall walk after their own inventions.” <a name="fr_1281"></a><a href="#fn_1281"><font size="1">1282</font></a>
