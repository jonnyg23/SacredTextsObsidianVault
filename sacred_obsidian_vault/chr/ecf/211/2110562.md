 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> if we wish the summit of our building to be perfect and to rise well-pleasing to God, we should endeavour to lay its foundations not in accordance with the desires of our own lust, but according to the rules of evangelical strictness: which can only be the fear of God and humility, proceeding from kindness and simplicity of heart. But humility cannot possibly be acquired without giving up everything: and as long as a man is a stranger to this, he cannot possibly attain the virtue of obedience, or the strength of patience, or the serenity of kindness, or the perfection of love; without which things our hearts cannot possibly be a habitation for the Holy Spirit: as the Lord says through the prophet: “Upon whom shall My spirit rest, but on him that is humble and quiet and hears My words,” or according to those copies which express the Hebrew accurately: “To whom shall I have respect, but to him that is poor and little and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at My words?” <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">1082</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p3"></a> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002">Is. lxvi. 2</a><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p3.1"></a>. It is noteworthy that Cassian after giving a rendering which differs but slightly from that of the old Latin, as given in Sabbatiers great work, adds the version of “those copies which express the Hebrew accurately,” and thus shows his acquaintance with Jeromes new translation which he quotes. He does the same thing again in the Conferences, XXIII. viii.; and On the Incarnation Against Nestorius IV. iii.; V. ii., xv. Compare also Institutes VIII. xxi., and Conf. VIII. x.; where he also betrays a knowledge of the Vulgate. As a general rule, however, his translations are taken from the old Latin, or possibly in some cases are made by him from the LXX.</p>
