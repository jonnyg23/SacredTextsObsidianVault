 <p> <a name="iv.vii.ii.v"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.ii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.vii.ii.v-p1"></a>Heaven is the home of virginity, and the Son of God its Author, Who though He was a Virgin before the Virgin, yet being of the Virgin took the Virgin Church as His bride. Of her we have all been born. Some of her gifts are enumerated. Her daughters have a special excellence in that virginity is not a matter of precept, and that it is a most powerful help in the pursuit of piety.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.vii.ii.v-p2"></a>20. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.ii.v-p2.1"></a>It</span> is the custom in encomiums to speak of country and parentage of the subject, that the greatness of the offspring may be enhanced by mention of the father. Now I, who have not undertaken to praise but to set forth virginity, yet think it to the purpose to make known its country and its parent. First, let us settle where is its country. Now, if ones country be there where is the home of ones birth, without doubt heaven is the native country of chastity. And so she is a stranger here, but a denizen there.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vii.ii.v-p3"></a>21. And what is virginal chastity but purity free from stain? And whom can we judge to be its author but the immaculate Son of God, Whose flesh saw no corruption, Whose Godhead experienced no infection? Consider, then, how great are the merits of virginity. Christ was before the Virgin, Christ was of the Virgin. Begotten indeed of the Father before the ages, but born of the Virgin for the ages. The former was of His own nature, the latter is for our benefit. The former always was, the latter He willed.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vii.ii.v-p4"></a>22. Consider, too, another merit of virginity. Christ is the spouse of the Virgin, and if one may so say of virginal chastity, for virginity is of Christ, not Christ of virginity. He is, then, the Virgin Who was espoused, the Virgin Who bare us, Who fed us with her own milk, of whom we read: “How great things hath the virgin of Jerusalem done! The teats shall not fail from the rock, nor snow from Lebanon, nor the water which is borne by the strong wind.” <a name="fr_3179"></a><a href="#fn_3179"><font size="1">3180</font></a>
  Who is this virgin that is watered with the streams of the Trinity, from whose rock waters flow, whose teats fail not, and whose honey is poured forth? Now, according to the Apostle, the rock is Christ. <a name="fr_3180"></a><a href="#fn_3180"><font size="1">3181</font></a>
  Therefore,  <a name="page_367"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 367</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.ii.v-Page_367"></a>from Christ the teats fail not, nor brightness from God, nor the river from the Spirit. This is the Trinity which waters their Church, the Father, Christ, and the Spirit.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vii.ii.v-p7"></a>23. But let us now come down from the mother to the daughters. “Concerning virgins,” says the Apostle, “I have no commandment of the Lord.” <a name="fr_3181"></a><a href="#fn_3181"><font size="1">3182</font></a>
  If the teacher of the Gentiles had none, who could have one? And in truth he had no commandment, but he had an example. For virginity cannot be commanded, but must be wished for, for things which are above us are matters for prayer rather than under mastery. “But I would have you,” he says, “be without carefulness. For he who is without a wife is careful for the things which are the Lords, how he may please God.…And the virgin taketh thought for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and in spirit. For she that is married taketh thought for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.” <a name="fr_3182"></a><a href="#fn_3182"><font size="1">3183</font></a>
