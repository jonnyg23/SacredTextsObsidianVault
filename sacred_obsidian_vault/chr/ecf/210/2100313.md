 <p> <a name="iv.vi.iii.viii"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p1"></a>In urging repentance St. Ambrose turns to his own case, expressing the wish that he could wash our Lords feet like the woman in the Gospel, which is a great pattern of penitence, though such as cannot attain to it find acceptance. He prays for himself, especially that he may sorrow with sinners, who are better than himself. Those for whom Christ died are not to be contemned.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2"></a>66. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2.1"></a>Show</span>, then, your wound to the Physician that He may heal it. Though you show it not, He knows it, but waits to hear your voice. Do away your scars by tears. Thus did that woman in the Gospel, and wiped out the stench of her sin; thus did she  <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-Page_354"></a>wash away her fault, when washing the feet of Jesus with her tears.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p3"></a>67. Would that Thou, Lord Jesus, mightest reserve for me the washing off from Thy feet of the stains contracted since Thou walkest in me! O that Thou mightest offer to me to cleanse the pollution which I by my deeds have caused on Thy steps! But whence can I obtain living water, wherewith I may wash Thy feet? If I have no water I have tears, and whilst with them I wash Thy feet I trust to cleanse myself. Whence is it that Thou shouldst say to me: “His sins which are many are forgiven, because he loved much”? I confess that I owe more, and that more has been forgiven me who have been called to the priesthood from the tumult and strife of the law courts and the dread of public administration; and therefore I fear that I may be found ungrateful, if I, to whom more has been forgiven, love less.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p4"></a>68. But all are not able to equal that woman, who was deservedly preferred even to Simon, who was giving the feast to the Lord; who gave a lesson to all who desire to gain forgiveness, by kissing the feet of Christ, washing them with her tears, wiping them with her hair, and anointing them with ointment.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p5"></a>69. In a kiss is the sign of love, and therefore the Lord Jesus says: “Let her kiss Me with the kisses of her mouth.” <a name="fr_3127"></a><a href="#fn_3127"><font size="1">3128</font></a>
  What is the meaning of the hair, but that you may learn that, having laid aside all the pomp of worldly trappings, you must implore pardon, throw yourself on the earth with tears, and prostrate on the ground move pity. In the ointment, too, is set forth the savour of a good conversation. David was a king, yet he said: “Every night will I wash my bed, I will water my couch with tears.” <a name="fr_3128"></a><a href="#fn_3128"><font size="1">3129</font></a>
  And therefore he obtained such a favour, as that of his house the Virgin should be chosen, who by her child-bearing should bring forth Christ for us. Therefore is this woman also praised in the Gospel.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p8"></a>70. Nevertheless if we are unable to equal her, the Lord Jesus knows also how to aid the weak, when there is no one who can prepare the feast, or bring the ointment, or carry with her a spring of living water. He comes Himself to the sepulchre.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p9"></a>71. Would that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to come to this sepulchre of mine, O Lord Jesus, that Thou wouldst wash me with Thy tears, since in my hardened eyes I possess not such tears as to be able to wash away my offence. If Thou shalt weep for me I shall be saved; if I am worthy of Thy tears I shall cleanse the stench of all my offences; if I am worthy that Thou weep but a little, Thou wilt call me out of the tomb of this body and will say: “Come forth,” that my meditations may not be kept pent up in the narrow limits of this body, but may go forth to Christ, and move in the light, that I may think no more on works of darkness but on works of light. For he who thinks on sins endeavours to shut himself up within his own consciousness.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p10"></a>72. Call forth, then, Thy servant. Although bound with the chain of my sins I have my feet fastened and my hands tied; being now buried in dead thoughts and works, yet at Thy call I shall go forth free, and shall be found one of those sitting at Thy feast, and Thy house shall be filled with precious ointment. If Thou hast vouchsafed to redeem any one, Thou wilt preserve him. For it shall be said, “See, he was not brought up in the bosom of the Church, nor trained from childhood, but hurried from the judgment-seat, brought away from the vanities of this world, growing accustomed to the singing of the choir instead of the shout of the crier, but he continues in the priesthood not by his own strength, but by the grace of Christ, and sits among the guests at the heavenly table.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p11"></a>73. Preserve, O Lord, Thy work, guard the gift which Thou hast given even to him who shrank from it. For I knew that I was not worthy to be called a bishop, because I had devoted myself to this world, but by Thy grace I am what I am. And I am indeed the least of all bishops, and the lowest in merit; yet since I too have undertaken some labour for Thy holy Church, watch over this fruit, and let not him whom when lost Thou didst call to the priesthood, to be lost when a priest. And first grant that I may know how with inmost affection to mourn with those who sin; for this is a very great virtue, since it is written: “And thou shalt not rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction, and speak not proudly in the day of their trouble.” <a name="fr_3129"></a><a href="#fn_3129"><font size="1">3130</font></a>
  Grant that so often as the sin of any one who has fallen is made known to me I may suffer with him, and not chide him proudly, but mourn and weep, so that weeping over another I may mourn for myself, saying, “Tamar hath been more righteous than I.” <a name="fr_3130"></a><a href="#fn_3130"><font size="1">3131</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p14"></a>74. Perchance a maiden may have fallen, deceived and hurried away by those occa<a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-Page_355"></a>sions which are the sources of sins. Well, we who are older sin, too. In us, too, the law of this flesh wars against the law of our mind, and makes us captives of sin, so that we do what we would not. <a name="fr_3131"></a><a href="#fn_3131"><font size="1">3132</font></a>
  Her youth is an excuse for her, I now have none, for she ought to learn, we ought to teach. So that “Tamar hath been more righteous than I.”</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p16"></a>75. We inveigh against some ones covetousness, let us call to mind whether we ourselves have never done anything covetously; and if we have, since covetousness is the root of all evils, and is working in our bodies like a serpent secretly under the earth, let each of us say: “Tamar hath been more righteous than I.”</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p17"></a>76. If we have been seriously moved against any one, a layman may act hastily for a smaller matter than a bishop. Let us ponder that with ourselves and say, He who is reproved for quick temper is more righteous than I. For if we thus speak, we guard ourselves against this, that the Lord Jesus or one of His disciples should say to us: “Thou beholdest the mote in thy brothers eye, but beholdest not the beam which is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye.” <a name="fr_3132"></a><a href="#fn_3132"><font size="1">3133</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p19"></a>77. Let us, then, not be ashamed to say that our fault is more serious than that of him whom we think we must reprove, for this is what Judah did who reprimanded Tamar, and remembering his own fault said: “Tamar is more righteous than I.” In which saying there is a deep mystery and a moral precept; and therefore is his offence not reckoned to him, because he accused himself before he was accused by others.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p20"></a>78. Let us, then, not rejoice over the sin of any one, but rather let us mourn, for it is written: “Rejoice not against me, O my enemy, because I have fallen, for I shall arise; for if I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me, I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He maintain my cause, and execute judgment for me, and bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteousness. Mine enemy, too, shall see it and shall be covered with confusion, which said unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? Mine eyes shall behold her, and she shall be for treading down as the mire in the streets.” <a name="fr_3133"></a><a href="#fn_3133"><font size="1">3134</font></a>
  And this not unreservedly, for he who rejoices at the fall of another rejoices at the victory of the devil. Let us, then, rather mourn when we hear that one has perished for whom Christ died, Who despises not even the straw in time of harvest.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.viii-p22"></a>79. O that He may not cast away this straw at His harvest, the empty stalks of my produce; but may He gather it in, as is said by some one: “Woe is me, for I am become as one that gathereth straw in harvest, and grape gleanings in the vintage,” <a name="fr_3134"></a><a href="#fn_3134"><font size="1">3135</font></a>
  that He may eat of the firstfruits at least of His grace in me, though He approve not the later fruit.</p>

 <a href="2100314.htm">Next: Chapter IX. In what way faith is necessary for repentance. Means for paying our debts, in which work, prayer, tears, and fasting are of more value than money. Some instances are adduced, and St. Ambrose declares that generosity is profitable, but only when joined with faith; it is, moreover, liable to certain defects. He goes on to speak of some defects in repentance, such as too great haste in seeking reconciliation, considering abstinence from sacraments all that is needed, of committing sin in hope of repenting later.</a></center>
