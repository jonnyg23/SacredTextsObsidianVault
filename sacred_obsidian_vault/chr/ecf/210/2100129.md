 <p> <a name="iv.ii.ii.x"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p0.1"></a>Chapter IX.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p1"></a>The Holy Spirit is rightly called the ointment of Christ, and the oil of gladness; and why Christ Himself is not the ointment, since He was anointed with the Holy Spirit. It is not strange that the Spirit should be called Ointment, since the Father and the Son are also called Spirit. And there is no confusion between them, since Christ alone suffered death, Whose saving cross is then spoken of.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p2"></a>100. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p2.1"></a>Now</span> many have thought that the  <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii.x-Page_107"></a>Holy Spirit is the ointment of Christ. And well it is said ointment, because He is called the oil of gladness, the joining together of many graces giving a sweet fragrance. But God the Almighty Father anointed Him the Prince of priests, Who was, not like others anointed in a type under the Law, but was both according to the Law anointed in the body, and in truth was full with the virtue of the Holy Spirit from the Father above the Law.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p3"></a>101. This is the oil of gladness, of which the prophet says: “God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.” <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">915</font></a>
  Lastly, Peter says that Jesus was anointed with the Spirit, as you read: “Ye know that word which went through all Judea beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached, even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit.” <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">916</font></a>
  The Holy Spirit is, then, the oil of gladness.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p6"></a>102. And well did he say oil of gladness, lest you should think Him a creature; for it is the nature of this sort of oil that it will by no means mingle with moisture of another kind. Gladness, too, does not anoint the body, but brightens the inmost heart, as the prophet said: “Thou hast put gladness in my heart.” <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">917</font></a>
  So as he loses his pains who wishes to mix oil with moister matter, because since the nature of oil is lighter than others, when the others settle, it rises and is separated. How do those wretched pedlars think that the oil of gladness can by their tricks be mingled with other creatures, since of a truth corporeal things cannot be mingled with in corporeal, nor things created with uncreated?</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p8"></a>102. And well is that called oil of gladness wherewith Christ was anointed; for neither was usual nor common oil to be sought for Him, wherewith either wounds are dressed or heat assuaged; since the salvation of the world did not seek alleviation for His wounds, nor the eternal might of His wearied Body demand refreshment.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p9"></a>103. Nor is it wonderful if He have the oil of gladness, Who made those about to die rejoice, put off sadness from the world, destroyed the odour of sorrowful death. And so the Apostle says: “For we are the good odour of Christ to God;” <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">918</font></a>
  certainly showing that he is speaking of spiritual things. But when the Son of God Himself says: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me,” <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">919</font></a>
  He points out the ointment of the Spirit. Therefore the Spirit is the ointment of Christ.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p12"></a>104. Or since the Name of Jesus is as ointment poured out, if they wish to understand Christ Himself, and not the Spirit of Christ to be expressed under the name of ointment, certainly when the Apostle Peter says that the Lord Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit, it is without doubt plain that the Spirit also is called ointment.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p13"></a>105. But what wonder, since both the Father and the Son are said to be Spirit. Of which we shall speak more fully when we begin to speak of the Unity of the Name. Yet since most suitable place occurs here, that we may not seem to have passed on without a conclusion, let them read that both the Father is called Spirit, as the Lord said in the Gospel, “for God is Spirit;” <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">920</font></a>
  and Christ is called Spirit, for Jeremiah said: “The Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord.” <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">921</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p16"></a>106. So, then, both the Father is Spirit and Christ is Spirit, for that which is not a created body is spirit, but the Holy Spirit is not commingled with the Father and the Son, but is distinct from the Father and from the Son. For the Holy Spirit did not die, Who could not die because He had not taken flesh upon Him, and the eternal Godhead was incapable of dying, but Christ died according to the flesh.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p17"></a>107. For of a truth He died in that which He took of the Virgin, not in that which He had of the Father, for Christ died in that nature in which He was crucified. But the Holy Spirit could not be crucified, Who had not flesh and bones, but the Son of God was crucified, Who took flesh and bones, that on that cross the temptations of our flesh might die. For He took on Him that which He was not that He might hide that which He was; He hid that which He was that He might be tempted in it, and that which He was not might be redeemed, in order that He might call us by means of that which He was not to that which He was.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p18"></a>108. O the divine mystery of that cross, on which weakness hangs, might is free, vices are nailed, and triumphal trophies raised. So that a certain saint said: “Pierce my flesh with nails for fear of Thee;” <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">922</font></a>
  he says not with nails of iron, but of fear and faith. For the bonds of virtue are stronger than those of punishment. Lastly, his faith bound Peter, when he had followed the Lord as far as the hall of the high priest, whom no one had bound,  <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii.x-Page_108"></a>and punishment loosened not him, whom faith bound. Again, when he was bound by the Jews, prayer loosed him, punishment did not hold him, because he had not gone back from Christ.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p20"></a>109. Therefore do you also crucify sin, that you may die to sin; he who dies to sin lives to God; do you live to Him Who spared not His own Son, that in His body He might crucify our passions. For Christ died for us, that we might live in His revived Body. Therefore not our life but our guilt died in Him, “Who,” it is said, “bare our sins in His own Body on the tree; that being set free from our sins we might live in righteousness, by the wound of Whose stripes we are healed.” <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">923</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p22"></a>110. That wood of the cross is, then, as it were a kind of ship of our salvation, our passage, not a punishment, for there is no other salvation but the passage of eternal salvation. Whilst expecting death I do not feel it; whilst thinking little of punishment I do not suffer; whilst careless of fear I know it not.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.x-p23"></a>111. Who, then, is He by the wound of Whose stripes we are healed but Christ the Lord? of Whom the same Isaiah prophesied His stripes were our healing, <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">924</font></a>
  of Whom Paul the Apostle wrote in his epistle: “Who knew no sin, but was made sin for us.” <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">925</font></a>
  This, indeed, was divine in Him, that His Flesh did no sin, nor did the creature of the body take in Him sin. For what wonder would it be if the Godhead alone sinned not, seeing It had no incentives to sin? But if God alone is free from sin, certainly every creature by its own nature can be, as we have said, liable to sin.</p>
