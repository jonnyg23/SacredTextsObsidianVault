 <p> <a name="iv.ii.iii.v"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.ii.iii.v-p1"></a>The Holy Spirit gives life, not in a different way from the Father and the Son, nor by a different working.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.ii.iii.v-p2"></a>29. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.iii.v-p2.1"></a>And</span> what wonder is it the Spirit works Life, Who quickens as does the Father and as does the Son? And who can deny that quickening is the work of the Eternal Majesty? For it is written: “Quicken Thy servant.” <a name="fr_1043"></a><a href="#fn_1043"><font size="1">1044</font></a>
  He, then, is quickened who is a servant, that is, man, who before had not life, but received the privilege of having it.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iii.v-p4"></a>30. Let us then see whether the Spirit is quickened, or Himself quickens. Now it is written: “The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.” <a name="fr_1044"></a><a href="#fn_1044"><font size="1">1045</font></a>
  So, then, the Spirit quickens.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iii.v-p6"></a>31. But that you may understand that the quickening of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is no separate work, read how there is a oneness of quickening also, since God Himself quickens through the Spirit, for Paul said: “He Who raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies because of His Spirit Who dwelleth in you.”</p>

 <a href="2100143.htm">Next: Chapter V. The Holy Spirit, as well as the Father and the Son, is pointed out in holy Scripture as Creator, and the same truth was shadowed forth even by heathen writers, but it was shown most plainly in the Mystery of the Incarnation, after touching upon which, the writer maintains his argument from the fact that worship which is due to the Creator alone is paid to the Holy Spirit.</a></center>
