 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p1"></a>The good faith of those who are easily bought over with money or flattery is a frail thing to trust to.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p2"></a>117. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p2.1"></a>Who</span> would suppose that those who are bought over to obedience by money, <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">549</font></a>
  or those who are allured by adulation, would ever be faithful to them? For the former are ever ready to sell themselves, whilst the latter cannot put up with a hard rule. They are easily won with a little adulation, but if one reproves them by a word, they murmur against it, they give one up, they go away with hostile feelings, they forsake one in anger. They prefer to rule rather than to obey. They think that those whom they ought to have placed over them ought to be subject to themselves, as though indebted to them by their kindness.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p4"></a>118. What man is there that thinks those will be faithful to himself, whom he believes he will have to bind to himself by money or flattery? For he who takes thy money supposes that he is cheaply held, and looked down upon, unless the money is paid again and again. So he frequently expects his price; whilst the other, who is met with prayer and flattery, is always wanting to be asked.</p>

 <a href="2100087.htm">Next: Chapter XXIV. We must strive for preferment only by right means. An office undertaken must be carried out wisely and with moderation. The inferior clergy should not detract from the bishop's reputation by feigned virtues; nor again, should the bishop be jealous of a cleric, but he should be just in all things and especially in giving judgment.</a></center>
