 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.v.iii-p1"></a>What those who were to be initiated promised on entering the Church, of the witnesses to these promises, and wherefore they then turned themselves to the East.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.v.iii-p2"></a>5. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.iii-p2.1"></a>After</span> this the Holy of holies <a name="fr_2831"></a><a href="#fn_2831"><font size="1">2832</font></a>
