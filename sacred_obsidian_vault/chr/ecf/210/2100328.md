 <p> <a name="iv.vii.ii.viii"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-p1"></a>Taking the passage concerning the honeycomb in the Song of Songs, he expounds it, comparing the sacred virgins to bees.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-p2"></a>40. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-p2.1"></a>Let</span>, then, your work be as it were a honeycomb, for virginity is fit to be compared to bees, so laborious is it, so modest, so continent. The bee feeds on dew, it knows no marriage couch, it makes honey. The virgins dew is the divine word, for the words of God descend like the dew. The virgins modesty is unstained nature. The virgins produce is the fruit of the lips, without bitterness, abounding in sweetness. They work in common, and their fruit is in common.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-p3"></a>41. How I wish you, my daughter, to be an imitator of these bees, whose food is flowers, whose offspring is collected and brought together by the mouth. Do imitate her, my daughter. Let no veil of deceit be spread over your words; let them have no covering of guile, that they may be pure, and full of gravity.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-p4"></a>42. And let an eternal succession of merits be brought forth by your mouth. Gather not for yourself alone (for how do you know when your soul shall be required of you?), lest leaving your granaries heaped full with corn, which will be a help neither to your life nor to your merits, you be hurried thither where you cannot take your treasure with you. Be rich then, but towards the poor,  <a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 370</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-Page_370"></a>that as they share in your nature they may also share your goods.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vii.ii.viii-p5"></a>43. And I also point out to you what flower is to be culled, that one it is Who said: “I am the Flower of the field, and the Lily of the valleys, as a lily among thorns,” <a name="fr_3200"></a><a href="#fn_3200"><font size="1">3201</font></a>
  which is a plain declaration that virtues are surrounded by the thorns of spiritual wickedness, so that no one can gather the fruit who does not approach with caution.</p>

 <a href="2100329.htm">Next: Chapter IX. Other passages from the Song of Songs are considered with relation to the present subject, and St. Ambrose exhorting the virgin to seek for Christ, points out where He may be found. A description of His perfections follows, and a comparison is made between virgins and the angels.</a></center>
