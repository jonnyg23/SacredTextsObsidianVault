 <p> <a name="iv.iv.vii.v"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p1"></a>It is objected by heretics that Christ offered worship to His Father. But instead it is shown that this must be referred to His humanity, as is clear from an examination of the passage. However, it also offers fresh witness to His Godhead, as we often see it happening in other actions that Christ did.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p2"></a>48. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p2.1"></a>But</span> if any one were to say that the Son worships God the Father, because it is written, “Ye worship ye know not what, we know what we worship,” <a name="fr_2576"></a><a href="#fn_2576"><font size="1">2577</font></a>
  let him consider when it was said, and to whom, and to whose wishes it was in answer.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p4"></a>49. In the earlier verses of this chapter it was stated, not without reason, that Jesus, being weary with the journey, was sitting down, and that He asked a woman of Samaria to give Him drink; <a name="fr_2577"></a><a href="#fn_2577"><font size="1">2578</font></a>
  for He spoke as man; for as God He could neither be weary nor thirst.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p6"></a>50. So when this woman addressed Him as a Jew, and thought Him a prophet, He answers her, as a Jew who spiritually taught the mysteries of the Law: “Ye worship ye know not what, we know what we worship.” “We,” He says; for He joined Himself with men. But how is He joined with men, but according to the flesh? And to show that He answered as being incarnate, He added: “for salvation is of the Jews.” <a name="fr_2578"></a><a href="#fn_2578"><font size="1">2579</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p8"></a>51. But immediately after this He put aside His human feelings, saying: “But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father.” <a name="fr_2579"></a><a href="#fn_2579"><font size="1">2580</font></a>
  He said not: “We shall worship.” This He would certainly have said, if He had a share in our obedience.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p10"></a>52. And when we read that Mary worshipped Him, <a name="fr_2580"></a><a href="#fn_2580"><font size="1">2581</font></a>
  we ought to learn that it is not possible for Him under the same nature both to worship as a servant, and to be worshipped as Lord; but rather that as man He is said to worship among men, and that as Lord He is worshipped by His servants.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.v-p12"></a>53. Many things therefore we read and believe, in the light of the sacrament of the Incarnation. But even in the very feelings of our human nature we may behold the Divine Majesty. Jesus is wearied with His journey, that He may refresh the weary; He desires to drink, when about to give spiritual drink to the thirsty; He was hungry, when about to supply the food of salvation to the hungry; He dies, to live again; He is buried, to rise again; He hangs upon the dreadful tree, to strengthen those in dread; He veils the heaven with thick darkness, that He may give light; He makes the earth to shake, that He may make it strong; He rouses the sea, that He may calm it; He opens the tombs of the dead, that He may show they are the homes of the living; He is made of a Virgin, that men may believe He is born of God; He feigns not to know, that He may make the ignorant to know; as a Jew He is said to worship, that the Son may be worshipped as true God.</p>

 <a href="2100259.htm">Next: Chapter V. Ambrose answers those who press the words of the Lord to the mother of Zebedee's children, by saying that they were spoken out of kindness, because Christ was unwilling to cause her grief. Ample reason for such tenderness is brought forward. The Lord would rather leave the granting of that request to the Father, than declare it to be impossible. This answer of Christ's, however, is not to His detriment, as is shown both by His very words, and also by comparing them with other passages.</a></center>
