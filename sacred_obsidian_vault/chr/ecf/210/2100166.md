 <p> <a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XIV.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p1"></a>Besides the evidence adduced above, other passages can be brought to prove the sovereignty of the Three Persons. Two are quoted from the Epistles to the Thessalonians, and by collating other testimonies of the Scriptures it is shown that in them dominion is claimed for the Spirit as for the other Persons. Then, by quotation of another still more express passage in the second Epistle to the Corinthians, it is inferred both that the Spirit is Lord, and that where the Lord is, there is the Spirit.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p2"></a>94. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p2.1"></a>God</span>, then, is One, without violation of the majesty of the eternal Trinity, as is declared in the instance set before us. And not in that place alone do we see the Trinity expressed in the Name of the Godhead; but both in many places, as we have said also above, and especially in the epistles which the Apostle wrote to the Thessalonians, he most clearly set forth the Godhead and sovereignty of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. For you read as follows:  <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-Page_149"></a>“The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, as we also do toward you, to the stablishing of your hearts without blame in holiness before God and our Father at the coming of the Lord Jesus.” <a name="fr_1356"></a><a href="#fn_1356"><font size="1">1357</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p4"></a>95. Who, then, is the Lord Who makes us to increase and abound before God and our Father at the coming of the Lord Jesus? He has named the Father and has named the Son; Whom, then, has he joined with the Father and the Son except the Spirit? Who is the Lord Who establishes our hearts in holiness. For holiness is a grace of the Spirit, as, too, is said farther on: “In holiness of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” <a name="fr_1357"></a><a href="#fn_1357"><font size="1">1358</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p6"></a>96. Who, then, do you think is here named Lord, except the Spirit? And has not God the Father been able to teach you, Who says: “Upon Whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He Who baptizeth in the Holy Spirit”? <a name="fr_1358"></a><a href="#fn_1358"><font size="1">1359</font></a>
  For the Spirit descended in the likeness of a dove, <a name="fr_1359"></a><a href="#fn_1359"><font size="1">1360</font></a>
  that He might both bear witness to His wisdom, and perfect the sacrament of the spiritual laver, and show that His working is one with that of the Father and the Son.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p9"></a>97. And that you should not suppose that anything had fallen from the Apostle by oversight, but that he knowingly and designedly and inspired by the Spirit designated Him Lord, Whom he felt to be God, he repeated the same in the second Epistle to the Thessalonians, saying: “But the Lord direct your hearts in the love of God and in the patience of Christ.” <a name="fr_1360"></a><a href="#fn_1360"><font size="1">1361</font></a>
  If love be of God and patience of Christ, it ought to be shown Who is the Lord Who directs, if we deny that the direction is of the Holy Spirit.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p11"></a>98. But we cannot deny it, since the Lord said of Him: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He will lead you into all truth.” <a name="fr_1361"></a><a href="#fn_1361"><font size="1">1362</font></a>
  And David says of Him: “Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the right way.” <a name="fr_1362"></a><a href="#fn_1362"><font size="1">1363</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p14"></a>99. See what the voice of the Lord uttered concerning the Holy Spirit. The Son of God came, and because He had not yet shed forth the Spirit, He declared that we were living like little children without the Spirit. He said that the Spirit was to come Who should make of these little children stronger men, by an increase, namely, of spiritual age. And this He laid down not that He might set the power of the Spirit in the first place, but that He might show that the fulness of strength consists in the knowledge of the Trinity.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p15"></a>100. It is therefore necessary either that you mention some fourth person besides the Spirit of whom you ought to be conscious, or assuredly that you do not consider another to be Lord, except the Spirit Who has been pointed out.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p16"></a>101. But if you require the plain statement of the words in which Scripture has spoken of the Spirit as Lord, it cannot have escaped you that it is written: “Now the Lord is the Spirit.” <a name="fr_1363"></a><a href="#fn_1363"><font size="1">1364</font></a>
  Which the course of the whole passage shows to have been certainly said of the Holy Spirit. And so let us consider the apostolic statement: “As often as Moses is read,” says he, “a veil is laid over their heart; but when they shall be turned to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is the Spirit; but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” <a name="fr_1364"></a><a href="#fn_1364"><font size="1">1365</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p19"></a>102. So he not only called the Spirit Lord, but also added: “But where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. So we all with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are formed anew into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord the Spirit;” <a name="fr_1365"></a><a href="#fn_1365"><font size="1">1366</font></a>
  that is, we who have been before converted to the Lord, so as by spiritual understanding to see the glory of the Lord, as it were, in the mirror of the Scriptures, are now being transformed from that glory which converted us to the Lord, to the heavenly glory. Therefore since it is the Lord to Whom we are converted, but the Lord is that Spirit by Whom we are formed anew, who are converted to the Lord, assuredly the Holy Ghost is pointed out, for He Who forms anew receives those who are converted. For how should He form again those whom He had not received.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p21"></a>103. Though why should we seek for the expression of words, where we see the expression of unity? For although you may distinguish between Lord and Spirit, you cannot deny that where the Lord is, there too is the Spirit, and he who has been converted to the Lord will have been converted to the Spirit. If you cavil at the letter, you cannot injure the Unity; if you wish to separate the Unity, you confess the Spirit Himself as the Lord of power.</p>

 <a href="2100167.htm">Next: Chapter XV. Though the Spirit be called Lord, three Lords are not thereby implied; inasmuch as two Lords are not implied by the fact that the Son in the same manner as the Father is called Lord in many passages of Scripture; for Lordship exists in the Godhead, and the Godhead in Lordship, and these coincide without division in the Three Persons.</a></center>
