 <p> <a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XIII.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p1"></a>With the desire to learn what subjection to Christ means after putting forward and rejecting various ideas of subjection, he runs through the Apostles words; and so puts an end to the blasphemous opinions of the heretics on this matter. The subjection, which is shown to be future, cannot concern the Godhead, since there has always been the greatest harmony of wills between the Father and the Son. Also to that same Son in His Godhead all things have indeed been made subject; but they are said to be not yet subject to Him in this sense, because all men do not obey His commands. But after that they have been made subject, then shall Christ also be made subject in them, and the Fathers work be perfected.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p2"></a>153. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p2.1"></a>But</span> if the one name and right of God belong to both the Father and the Son, since the Son of God is also true God, and a King eternal, the Son of God is not made subject in His Godhead. Let us then, Emperor Augustus, think how we ought to regard His subjection.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p3"></a>154. How is the Son of God made subject? As the creature to vanity? But it is blasphemous to have any such idea of the Substance of the Godhead.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p4"></a>155. Or as every creature is to the Son of God, for it is rightly written: “Thou hast put all things in subjection under His feet”? <a name="fr_2721"></a><a href="#fn_2721"><font size="1">2722</font></a>
  But Christ is not made subject to Himself.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p6"></a>156. Or as a woman to a man, as we read: “Let the wives be subject to their husbands;” <a name="fr_2722"></a><a href="#fn_2722"><font size="1">2723</font></a>
  and again: “Let the woman learn in silence in all subjection”? <a name="fr_2723"></a><a href="#fn_2723"><font size="1">2724</font></a>
  But it is impious to compare a man to the Father, or a woman to the Son of God.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p9"></a>157. Or as Peter said: “Submit yourselves to every human creature”? <a name="fr_2724"></a><a href="#fn_2724"><font size="1">2725</font></a>
  But Christ was certainly not so subject.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p11"></a>158. Or as Paul wrote: “Submitting yourselves mutually to God and the Father in the fear of Christ”? <a name="fr_2725"></a><a href="#fn_2725"><font size="1">2726</font></a>
  But Christ was not subject either in His own fear, nor in the fear of another Christ. For Christ is but one. But note the force of these words, that we are subject to the Father, whilst we also fear Christ.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p13"></a>159. How, then, do we understand His subjection? Shall we review the whole chapter which the Apostle wrote, so as to give no appearance of having falsely withheld anything, or of having weakened its force with intention to deceive? “If in this life only,” he says, “we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But if Christ is risen from the dead, He is the first-fruits of them that sleep.” <a name="fr_2726"></a><a href="#fn_2726"><font size="1">2727</font></a>
  Ye see how he discusses the question of Christs Resurrection.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p15"></a>160. “For since by one man,” he says, “came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christs, who have believed in His coming. Then cometh the end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He shall have put down all rule and authority and power. For He must reign until He hath put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death; for He hath put all things under His  <a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-Page_304"></a>feet. But when He saith, all things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted Which did put all things under Him. But when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him, that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.” <a name="fr_2727"></a><a href="#fn_2727"><font size="1">2728</font></a>
  Thus also the same Apostle said to the Hebrews: “But now we see not yet all things put under Him.” <a name="fr_2728"></a><a href="#fn_2728"><font size="1">2729</font></a>
  We have heard the whole of the Apostles discourse.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p18"></a>161. How, then, do we speak of His subjection? The Sabellians and Marcionites say that this subjection of Christ to God the Father will be in such wise that the Son will be re-absorbed into the Father. If, then, the subjection of the Word means that God the Word is to be absorbed into the Father; then whatsoever is made subject to the Father and the Son will be absorbed into the Father and the Son, that God may be all and in all His creatures. But it is foolish to say so. There is therefore no subjection through re-absorption. For there are other things which are made subject, those, that is to say, which are created, and there is Another, to Whom that subjection is made. Let the expounders of a cruel re-absorption keep silence.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p19"></a>162. Would that they too were silent, who, as they cannot prove that the Word of God and Wisdom of God can be re-absorbed, attribute the weakness of subjection to His Godhead, saying that it is written: “But when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him.” <a name="fr_2729"></a><a href="#fn_2729"><font size="1">2730</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p21"></a>163. We see, then, that the Scripture states that He is not yet made subject, but that this is to come: Therefore now the Son is not made subject to God the Father. In what, then, do ye say that the Son will be made subject? If in His Godhead, He is not disobedient, for He is not at variance with the Father; nor is He made subject, for He is not a servant, but the only Son of His own proper Father. Lastly, when He created heaven, and formed the earth, He exercised both power and love. There is therefore no subjection as that of a servant in the Godhead of Christ. But if there is no subjection then the will is free.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p22"></a>164. But if they think of this as the subjection of the Son, namely, that the Father makes all things in union with His will, let them learn that this is really a proof of inseparable power. For the unity of Their will is one that began not in time, but ever existed. But where there is a constant unity of will, there can be no weakness of temporal subjection. For if He were made subject through His nature, He would always remain in subjection; but since He is said to be made subject in time, that subjection must be part of an assumed office and not of an everlasting weakness: especially as the eternal Power of God cannot change His state for a time, neither can the right of ruling fall to the Father in time. For if the Son ever will be changed in such wise as to be made subject in His Godhead, then also must God the Father, if ever He shall gain more power, and have the Son in subjection to Himself in His Godhead, be considered now in the meantime inferior according to your explanation.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p23"></a>165. But what fault has the Son been guilty of, that we should believe that He could hereafter be made subject in His Godhead? Has he as man seized for Himself the right to sit at His Fathers side, or has He claimed for Himself the prerogative of His Fathers throne, against His Fathers will? But He Himself says: “For I do always those things that please Him.” <a name="fr_2730"></a><a href="#fn_2730"><font size="1">2731</font></a>
  Therefore if the Son pleases the Father in all things, why should He be made subject, Who was not made subject before?</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p25"></a>166. Let us see then that there be not a subjection of the Godhead, but rather of us in the fear of Christ, a truth so full of grace, and so full of mystery. Wherefore, again, let us weigh the Apostles words: “But when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him: that God may be all in all.” What then dost thou say? Are not all things now subject unto Him? Are not the choirs of the saints made subject? Are not the angels, who ministered to Him when on the earth? <a name="fr_2731"></a><a href="#fn_2731"><font size="1">2732</font></a>
  Are not the archangels who were sent to Mary to foretell the coming of the Lord? Are not all the heavenly hosts? Are not the cherubim and seraphim, are not thrones and dominions and powers which worship and praise Him?</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p27"></a>167. How, then, will they be brought into subjection? In the way that the Lord Himself has said. “Take My yoke upon you.” <a name="fr_2732"></a><a href="#fn_2732"><font size="1">2733</font></a>
  It is not the fierce that bear the yoke, but the humble and the gentle. This clearly is no base subjection for men, but a glorious one: “that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things beneath; and that every tongue  <a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-Page_305"></a>should confess that Jesus is Lord in the glory of God the Father.” <a name="fr_2733"></a><a href="#fn_2733"><font size="1">2734</font></a>
  But for this reason all things were not made subject before, for they had not yet received the wisdom of God, not yet did they wear the easy yoke of the Word on the neck as it were of their mind. “But as many as received Him,” as it is written, “to them gave He power to become the sons of God.” <a name="fr_2734"></a><a href="#fn_2734"><font size="1">2735</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p31"></a>168. Will any one say that Christ is now made subject, because many have believed? Certainly not. For Christs subjection lies not in a few but in all. For just as I do not seem to be brought into subjection, if the flesh in me as yet lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, <a name="fr_2735"></a><a href="#fn_2735"><font size="1">2736</font></a>
  although I am in part subdued; so because the whole Church is the one body of Christ, we divide Christ as long as the human race disagrees. Therefore Christ is not yet made subject, for His members are not yet brought into subjection. But when we have become, not many members, but one spirit, then He also will become subject, in order that through His subjection “God may be all and in all.”</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xiv-p33"></a>169. But as Christ is not yet made subject, so is the work of God not yet perfected; for the Son of God said: “My meat is to do the will of My Father that sent Me, and to finish His work.” <a name="fr_2736"></a><a href="#fn_2736"><font size="1">2737</font></a>
  What manner of doubt is there that the subjection of the Son in me is still in the future, in whom the work of the Father is unfinished, because I myself am not yet perfect? I, who make the work of God to be unfinished, do I make the Son of God to be in subjection? But that is not a matter of wrong, it is a matter of grace. For in so far as we are made subject, it is to our profit, not to that of the Godhead, that we are made subject to the law, that we are made subject to grace. For formerly, as the Apostle himself has said, the wisdom of the flesh was at enmity with God, for “it was not made subject to the law,” <a name="fr_2737"></a><a href="#fn_2737"><font size="1">2738</font></a>
  but now it is made subject through the Passion of Christ.</p>

 <a href="2100268.htm">Next: Chapter XIV. He continues the discussion of the difficulty he has entered upon, and teaches that Christ is not subject but only according to the flesh. Christ, however, whilst in subjection in the Flesh, still gave proofs of His Godhead. He combats the idea that Christ is made subject in This. The humanity indeed, which He adopted, has been so far made subject in us, as ours has been raised in that very humanity of His. Lastly, we are taught, when that same subjection of Christ will take place.</a></center>
