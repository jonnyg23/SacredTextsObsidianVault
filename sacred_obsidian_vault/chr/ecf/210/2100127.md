 <p> <a name="iv.ii.ii.viii"></a>  <a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-Page_104"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VII.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p1"></a>The Holy Spirit is not a creature, seeing that He is infinite, and was shed upon the apostles dispersed through all countries, and moreover sanctifies the Angels also, to whom He makes us equal. Mary was full of the same likewise, so too, Christ the Lord, and so far all things high and low. And all benediction has its origin from His operation, as was signified in the moving of the water at Bethesda.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p2"></a>81. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p2.1"></a>Since</span> then, every creature is confined within certain limits of its own nature, and inasmuch as those invisible operations, which cannot be circumscribed by place and bounds, yet are closed in by the property of their own substance; how can any one dare to call the Holy Spirit a creature, Who has not a limited and circumscribed power? because He is always in all things and everywhere, which assuredly is the property of Divinity and Lordship, for: “The earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof.” <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">890</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p4"></a>81. And so, when the Lord appointed His servants the apostles, that we might recognize that the creature was one thing and the grace of the Spirit another, He appointed them to different places, because all could not be everywhere at once. But He gave the Holy Spirit to all, to shed upon the apostles though separated the gift of indivisible grace. The persons, then, were different, but the accomplishment of the working was in all one, because the Holy Spirit is one of Whom it is said: “Ye shall receive power, even the Holy Spirit coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the ends of the earth.” <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">891</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p6"></a>82. The Holy Spirit, then, is uncircumscribed and infinite, Who infused Himself into the minds of the disciples throughout the separate divisions of distant regions, and the remote bounds of the whole world, Whom nothing is able to escape or to deceive. And therefore holy David says: “Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy face.” <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">892</font></a>
  Of what Angel does the Scripture say this? of what Dominion? of what Power? of what Angel do we find the power diffused over many? For Angels were sent to few, but the Holy Spirit was poured upon whole peoples. Who, then, can doubt that that is divine which is shed upon many at once and is not seen; but that that is corporeal which is seen and held by individuals?</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p8"></a>83. But in like manner as the Spirit sanctifying the apostles is not a partaker of human nature; so, too, He sanctifying Angels, Dominions, and Powers, has no partnership with creatures. But if any think that the holiness of the Angels is not spiritual, but some other kind of grace belonging to the property of their nature, they will forsooth judge Angels to be inferior to men. For since themselves also confess that they would not dare to compare Angels to the Holy Spirit, and they cannot deny that the Holy Spirit is shed upon men; but the sanctification of the Spirit is a divine gift and favour, men who possess a better kind of sanctification will certainly be found to be preferred to the Angels. But since Angels come down to men to assist them, it must be understood that the nature of Angels is higher as it receives more of the grace of the Spirit, and that the favour awarded to us and to them comes from the same author.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p9"></a>84. But how great is that grace which makes even the lower nature of the lot of men equal to the gifts received by Angels, as the Lord Himself promised, saying: “Ye shall be as the Angels in heaven.” Nor is it difficult, for He Who made those Angels in the Spirit will by the same grace make men also equal to the Angels.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p10"></a>85. But of what creature can it be said that it fills all things, as is written of the Holy Spirit: “I will pour My Spirit upon all flesh.” <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">893</font></a>
  This cannot be said of an Angel. Lastly, Gabriel himself, when sent to Mary, said: “Hail, full of grace,” <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">894</font></a>
  plainly declaring the grace of the Spirit which was in her, because the Holy Spirit had come upon her, and she was about to have her womb full of grace with the heavenly Word.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p13"></a>86. For it is of the Lord to fill all things, Who says: “I fill heaven and earth.” <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">895</font></a>
  If, then, it is the Lord Who fills heaven and earth, Who can judge the Holy Spirit to be without a share in the dominion and divine power, seeing that He has filled the world, and what is beyond the whole world, filled Jesus the Redeemer of the whole world? For it is written: “But Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, departed from Jordan.” <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">896</font></a>
  Who, then, except one who possessed the same fulness could fill Him Who fills all things?</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p16"></a>87. But lest they should object that this was said according to the flesh, though He alone from Whose flesh went forth virtue to heal all, was more than all; yet, as the Lord fills all things, so, too, we read of the Spirit: “For the Spirit of the Lord filled the whole world.” <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">897</font></a>
  And you find it said of all  <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-Page_105"></a>who had consorted with the Apostles that, “filled with the Holy Spirit they spoke the word of God with boldness.” <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">898</font></a>
  You see that the Spirit gives both fulness and boldness, Whose operation the archangel announces to Mary, saying: “The Holy Spirit shall come on thee.” <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">899</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p20"></a>88. You read, too, in the Gospel that the Angel descended at the appointed time into the pool and troubled the water, and he who first went down into the pool was made whole. <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">900</font></a>
  What did the Angel declare in this type but the descent of the Holy Spirit, which was to come to pass in our day, and should consecrate the waters when invoked by the prayers of the priest? That Angel, then, was a herald of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as by means of the grace of the Spirit medicine was to be applied to our infirmities of soul and mind. The Spirit, then, has the same ministers as God the Father and Christ. He fills all things, possesses all things, works all and in all in the same manner as God the Father and the Son work.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.ii.viii-p22"></a>89. What, then, is more divine than the working of the Holy Spirit, since God Himself testifies that the Holy Spirit presides over His blessings, saying: “I will put My Spirit upon thy seed and My blessings upon thy children.” <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">901</font></a>
  For no blessing can be full except through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, too, the Apostle found nothing better to wish us than this, as He himself said: “We cease not to pray and make request for you that ye may be filled with the knowledge of His will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding walking worthily of God.” <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">902</font></a>
  He taught, then, that this was the will of God, that rather by walking in good works and words and affections, we should be filled with the will of God, Who puts His Holy Spirit in our hearts. Therefore if he who has the Holy Spirit is filled with the will of God, there is certainly no difference of will between the Father and the Son.</p>

 <a href="2100128.htm">Next: Chapter VIII. The Holy Spirit is given by God alone, yet not wholly to each person, since there is no one besides Christ capable of receiving Him wholly. Charity is shed abroad by the Holy Spirit, Who, prefigured by the mystical ointment, is shown to have nothing common with creatures; and He, inasmuch as He is said to proceed from the mouth of God, must not be classed with creatures, nor with things divisible, seeing He is eternal.</a></center>
