 <p class="c22"><a name="v-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="v-p1.1"></a>Of</span> the 91 Epistles considered genuine by the Benedictine Editors, sixty-three are referred by them to fairly certain dates, <a name="fr_3408"></a><a href="#fn_3408"><font size="1">3409</font></a>
  and a large number of these would well be worth translation, throwing as they do so clear a light on the events of St. Ambroses life, and in many cases on the history of the period. Only a few are here presented to the reader.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v-p3"></a>Perhaps some others might have been better selected, but if they were to be so few, it seemed as if these would give the best general impression of the indomitable energy and fearless constancy of the great Bishop.</p>
