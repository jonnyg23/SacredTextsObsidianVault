 <p> <a name="iv.viii.xi"></a> </p><h3 align="center"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p0.1"></a>Chapter X.</h3>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p1"></a>St. Ambrose returns again to the subject of Christ, speaking of His goodness in all misery. The various ways in which the good Physician treats our diseases, and the quickness of the healing if only we do not neglect to call upon Him. He touches upon the moral meaning of the will, which he shows was manifested in Peters mother-in-law, and lastly points out what a minister of Christ and specially a bishop ought to be, and says that they specially must rise through grace.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p2"></a>60. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p2.1"></a>But</span> let us return to the point, and not, while we are grieving over the wounds of our sins, leave the physician, and whilst ministering to the sores of others, let our own go on increasing. The Physician is then here asked for. Do not fear, because the Lord is great, that perhaps He will not condescend to come to one who is sick, for He often comes to us from heaven; and is wont to visit not only the rich but also the poor and the servants of the poor. <a name="fr_3365"></a><a href="#fn_3365"><font size="1">3366</font></a>
  And so now He comes, when called upon, to Peters mother-in-law. “And He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.” <a name="fr_3366"></a><a href="#fn_3366"><font size="1">3367</font></a>
  As He is worthy of being remembered, so, too, is He worthy of being longed for, worthy, too, of love, for His condescension to every single matter which affects men, and His marvellous acts. He disdains not to visit widows, and to enter the narrow rooms of a poor cottage. As God He commands, as man He visits.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p5"></a>61. Thanks be to the Gospel, by means of which we also, who saw not Christ when He came into this world, seem to be with Him when we read His deeds, that as they, to whom He drew near, borrowed faith from Him, so may He, when we believe His deeds, draw near to us.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p6"></a>62. Do you see what kinds of healing are with Him? He commands the fever, He commands the unclean spirits, at another place He lays hands on them. He was wont then to heal the sick, not only by word but also by touch. And do you then, who burn with many desires, taken either by the beauty or by the fortune of some one, implore Christ, call in the Physician, stretch forth your right hand to Him, let the hand of God touch your inmost being, and the grace of the heavenly Word enter the veins of your inward desires, let Gods right hand strike the secrets of your heart. He spreads clay on the eyes of some that they may see, <a name="fr_3367"></a><a href="#fn_3367"><font size="1">3368</font></a>
  and the Creator of all teaches us that we ought to be mindful of our own nature, and to discern the vileness of our body; for no one can see divine things except one who through knowledge of his vileness cannot be puffed up. Another is bidden to show himself to the priest, that he may for ever be free from the scales of leprosy. <a name="fr_3368"></a><a href="#fn_3368"><font size="1">3369</font></a>
  For he alone can preserve his purity, both of body and soul, who knows how to show himself to that priest, Whom we have received as an Advocate for our sins, and to Whom is plainly said: “Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.” <a name="fr_3369"></a><a href="#fn_3369"><font size="1">3370</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p10"></a>63. And be not afraid that there will be any delay in healing. He who is healed by Christ has no hindrances. You must  <a name="page_402"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 402</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.xi-Page_402"></a>use the remedy which you have received; and as soon as He has given the command, the blind man sees, the paralytic walks, the dumb speaks, the deaf hears, she that has a fever ministers, the lunatic is delivered. And do you, then, who ever after an unseemly fashion languish for desire of anything, entreat the Lord, show Him your faith, and fear no delay. Where there is prayer, the Word is present, desire is put to flight, lust departs. And be not afraid of offending by confession, take it rather as a right, for you who were before afflicted by an intense disease of the body will begin to minister to Christ.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p11"></a>64. And in this place can be seen the disposition of the will of Peters mother-in-law, from which she received for herself, as it were, the seed corn of what was to come, for to each his will is the cause of that which is to come. For from the will springs wisdom, which the wise man takes in marriage to himself, saying: “I desire to make her my spouse.” <a name="fr_3370"></a><a href="#fn_3370"><font size="1">3371</font></a>
  This will, then, which at first was weak and languid under the fever of various desires, afterwards by the office of the apostles rose up strong to minister unto Christ.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p13"></a>65. At the same time it is also shown what he ought to be who ministers to Christ, for first he must be free from the enticements of various pleasures, he must be free from inward languor of body and soul, that he may minister the Body and Blood of Christ. For no one who is sick with his own sins, and far from being whole, can minister the remedies of the healing of immortality. See what thou doest, O priest, and touch not the Body of Christ with a fevered hand. First be healed that thou mayest be able to minister. If Christ bids those who are now cleansed, but were once leprous, to show themselves to the priests, <a name="fr_3371"></a><a href="#fn_3371"><font size="1">3372</font></a>
  how much more is it fitting for the priest himself to be pure. That widow, then, cannot take it ill that I have not spared her, since I spare not myself.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p15"></a>66. Peters mother-in-law, it is written, rose up and ministered to them. Well is it said, rose up, for the grace of the apostleship was already furnishing a type of the sacrament. It is proper to the ministers of Christ to rise, according to that which is written: “Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.” <a name="fr_3372"></a><a href="#fn_3372"><font size="1">3373</font></a>

 <a href="2100360.htm">Next: Chapter XI. Having shown that the pretexts usually alleged for second marriages have no weight, St. Ambrose declares that he does not condemn them, though from the Apostle's words he sets forth their inconveniences, though the state of those twice married is approved in the Church, and he takes occasion to advert to those heretics who forbid them. And he says that it is because the strength of different persons varies that chastity is not commanded, but only recommended.</a></center>
