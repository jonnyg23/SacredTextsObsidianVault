 <p class="c32"><a name="v.xi-p1"></a>Addressed to the Emperor Theodosius after the massacre at Thessalonica. <a name="fr_3617"></a><a href="#fn_3617"><font size="1">3618</font></a>
  St. Ambrose begins by stating his reasons for not having met the Emperor on his return to Milan. He then mentions the sentiments of the bishops with regard to the slaughter at Thessalonica, and points out that repentance for that deed is necessary to obtain forgiveness and a victory over the devil, the instigator to that crime. St. Ambrose could not offer the sacrifice in the Emperors presence, and, as truly loving the Emperor, grieves and yet hopes.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="v.xi-p3"></a>1. <span class="sc"><a name="v.xi-p3.1"></a>The</span> memory of your old friendship is pleasant to me, and I gratefully call to mind the kindnesses which, in reply to my frequent intercessions, you have most graciously conferred on others. Whence it may be inferred that I did not from any ungrateful feeling avoid meeting you on your arrival, which I had always before earnestly desired. And I will now briefly set forth the reason for my acting as I did.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p4"></a>2. I saw that from me alone in your court the natural right of hearing was withdrawn, so that I was deprived also of the office of speaking; for you were frequently troubled because certain matters which had been decided in your consistory had come to my knowledge. I, therefore, am without a part in the common privilege, since the Lord Jesus says: “That nothing is hidden, which shall not be made known.” <a name="fr_3618"></a><a href="#fn_3618"><font size="1">3619</font></a>
  I, therefore, as reverently as I could, complied with the imperial will, and took heed that neither yourself should have any reason for displeasure, when I effected that nothing should be related to me of the imperial decrees; and that I, when present, either should not hear, through fear of all others, and so incur the reputation of connivance, or should hear in such a fashion that my ears might be open, my utterance prevented, that I might not be able to utter what I had heard lest I should injure and bring in peril those who had incurred the suspicion of treachery.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p6"></a>3. What, then, could I do? Should I not hear? But I could not close my ears with the wax of the old fables. Should I utter what I heard? But I was bound to be on my guard in my words against that which I  <a name="page_451"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 451</font></a> <a name="v.xi-Page_451"></a>feared in your commands, namely, lest some deed of blood should be committed. Should I keep silence? But then my conscience would be bound, my utterance taken away, which would be the most wretched condition of all. And where would be that text? If the priest speak not to him that erreth, he who errs shall die in his sin, and the priest shall be liable to the penalty because he warned not the erring. <a name="fr_3619"></a><a href="#fn_3619"><font size="1">3620</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p8"></a>4. Listen, august Emperor. I cannot deny that you have a zeal for the faith; I do confess that you have the fear of God. But you have a natural vehemence, which, if any one endeavours to soothe, you quickly turn to mercy; if any one stirs it up, you rouse it so much more that you can scarcely restrain it. Would that if no one soothe it, at least no one may inflame it! To yourself I willingly entrust it, you restrain yourself, and overcome your natural vehemence by the love of piety.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p9"></a>5. This vehemence of yours I preferred to commend privately to your own consideration, rather than possibly raise it by any action of mine in public. And so I have preferred to be somewhat wanting in duty rather than in humility, and that other, should rather think me wanting in priestly authority than that you should find me lacking in most loving reverence, that having restrained your vehemence your power of deciding on your counsel should not be weakened. I excuse myself by bodily sickness, which was in truth severe, and scarcely to be lightened but by great care. Yet I would rather have died than not wait two or three days for your arrival. But it was not possible for me to do so.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p10"></a>6. There was that done in the city of the Thessalonians of which no similar record exists, which I was not able to prevent happening; which, indeed, I had before said would be most atrocious when I so often petitioned against it, and that which you yourself show by revoking it too late you consider to be grave, <a name="fr_3620"></a><a href="#fn_3620"><font size="1">3621</font></a>
  this I could not extenuate when done. When it was first heard of, a synod had met because of the arrival of the Gallican Bishops. There was not one who did not lament it, not one who thought lightly of it; your being in fellowship with Ambrose was no excuse for your deed. Blame for what had been done would have been heaped more and more on me, had no one said that your reconciliation to our God was necessary.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p12"></a>7. Are you ashamed, O Emperor, to do that which the royal prophet David, the forefather of Christ, according to the flesh, did? To him it was told how the rich man who had many flocks seized and killed the poor mans one lamb, because of the arrival of his guest, and recognizing that he himself was being condemned in the tale, for that he himself had done it, he said: “I have sinned against the Lord.” <a name="fr_3621"></a><a href="#fn_3621"><font size="1">3622</font></a>
  Bear it, then, without impatience, O Emperor, if it be said to you: “You have done that which was spoken of to King David by the prophet.” For if you listen obediently to this, and say: “I have sinned against the Lord,” if you repeat those words of the royal prophet: “O come let us worship and fall down before Him, and mourn before the Lord our God, Who made us,” <a name="fr_3622"></a><a href="#fn_3622"><font size="1">3623</font></a>
  it shall be said to you also: “Since thou repentest, the Lord putteth away thy sin, and thou shalt not die.” <a name="fr_3623"></a><a href="#fn_3623"><font size="1">3624</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p16"></a>8. And again, David, after he had commanded the people to be numbered, was smitten in heart, and said to the Lord: “I have sinned exceedingly, because I have commanded this, and now, O Lord, take away the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have transgressed exceedingly.” <a name="fr_3624"></a><a href="#fn_3624"><font size="1">3625</font></a>
  And the prophet Nathan was sent again to him, to offer him the choice of three things, that he should select the one he chose—famine in the land for three years, or that he should flee for three months before his enemies, or mortal pestilence in the land for three days. And David answered: “These three things are a great strait to me, but let me fall into the hand of the Lord, for very many are His mercies, and let me not fall into the hands of man.” <a name="fr_3625"></a><a href="#fn_3625"><font size="1">3626</font></a>
  Now his fault was that he desired to know the number of the whole of the people which was with him, which knowledge he ought to have left to God alone.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p19"></a>9. And, we are told, when death came upon the people, on the very first day at dinner time, when David saw the angel smiting the people, he said: “I have sinned, and I, the shepherd, have done wickedly, and this flock, what hath it done? Let Thine hand be upon me, and upon my fathers house.” <a name="fr_3626"></a><a href="#fn_3626"><font size="1">3627</font></a>
  And so it repented the Lord, and He commanded the angel to spare the people, and David to offer a sacrifice, for sacrifices were then offered for sins; sacrifices are now those of penitence. And  <a name="page_452"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 452</font></a> <a name="v.xi-Page_452"></a>so by that humbling of himself he became more acceptable to God, for it is no matter of wonder that a man should sin, but this is reprehensible, if he does not recognize that he has erred, and humble himself before God.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p21"></a>10. Holy Job, himself also powerful in this world, says: “I hid not my sin, but declared it before all the people.” <a name="fr_3627"></a><a href="#fn_3627"><font size="1">3628</font></a>
  His son Jonathan said to the fierce King Saul himself: “Do not sin against thy servant David;” <a name="fr_3628"></a><a href="#fn_3628"><font size="1">3629</font></a>
  and: “Why dost thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?” <a name="fr_3629"></a><a href="#fn_3629"><font size="1">3630</font></a>
  For, although he was a king, yet he would have sinned if he slew the innocent. And again, David also, when he was in possession of the kingdom, and had heard that innocent Abner had been slain by Joab, the leader of his host, said: “I am guiltless and my kingdom is guiltless henceforth and for ever of the blood of Abner, the son of Ner,” <a name="fr_3630"></a><a href="#fn_3630"><font size="1">3631</font></a>
  and he fasted for sorrow.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p26"></a>11. I have written this, not in order to confound you, but that the examples of these kings may stir you up to put away this sin from your kingdom, for you will do it away by humbling your soul before God. You are a man, and it has come upon you, conquer it. Sin is not done away but by tears and penitence. Neither angel can do it, nor archangel. The Lord Himself, Who alone can say, “I am with you,” <a name="fr_3631"></a><a href="#fn_3631"><font size="1">3632</font></a>
  if we have sinned, does not forgive any but those who repent.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p28"></a>12. I urge, I beg, I exhort, I warn, for it is a grief to me, that you who were an example of unusual piety, who were conspicuous for clemency, who would not suffer single offenders to be put in peril, should not mourn that so many have perished. Though you have waged battle most successfully, though in other matters, too, you are worthy of praise, yet piety was ever the crown of your actions. The devil envied that which was your most excellent possession. Conquer him whilst you still possess that wherewith you may conquer. Do not add another sin to your sin by a course of action which has injured many.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p29"></a>13. I, indeed, though a debtor to your kindness, for which I cannot be ungrateful, that kindness which has surpassed that of many emperors, and has been equalled by one only; I, I say, have no cause for a charge of contumacy against you, but have cause for fear; I dare not offer the sacrifice if you intend to be present. Is that which is not allowed after shedding the blood of one innocent person, allowed after shedding the blood of many? I do not think so.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p30"></a>14. Lastly, I am writing with my own hand that which you alone may read. As I hope that the Lord will deliver me from all troubles, I have been warned, not by man, nor through man, but plainly by Himself that this is forbidden me. For when I was anxious, in the very night in which I was preparing to set out, you appeared to me in a dream to have come into the Church, and I was not permitted to offer the sacrifice. I pass over other things, which I could have avoided, but I bore them for love of you, as I believe. May the Lord cause all things to pass peaceably. Our God gives warnings in many ways, by heavenly signs, by the precepts of the prophets; by the visions even of sinners He wills that we should understand, that we should entreat Him to take away all disturbances, to preserve peace for you emperors, that the faith and peace of the Church, whose advantage it is that emperors should be Christians and devout, may continue.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p31"></a>15. You certainly desire to be approved by God. “To everything there is a time,” <a name="fr_3632"></a><a href="#fn_3632"><font size="1">3633</font></a>
  as it is written: “It is time for Thee, Lord, to work.” <a name="fr_3633"></a><a href="#fn_3633"><font size="1">3634</font></a>
  “It is an acceptable time, O Lord.” <a name="fr_3634"></a><a href="#fn_3634"><font size="1">3635</font></a>
  You shall then make your offering when you have received permission to sacrifice, when your offering shall be acceptable to God. Would it not delight me to enjoy the favour of the Emperor, to act according to your wish, if the case allowed it? And prayer by itself is a sacrifice, it obtains pardon, when the oblation would bring offence, for the one is a sign of humility, the other of contempt. For the Word of God Himself tells us that He prefers the performance of His commandments to the offering of sacrifice. God proclaims this, Moses declares it to the people, Paul preaches it to the Gentiles. Do that which you understand is most profitable for the time. “I prefer mercy,” it is said, “rather than sacrifice.” <a name="fr_3635"></a><a href="#fn_3635"><font size="1">3636</font></a>
  Are they not, then, rather Christians in truth who condemn their own sin, than they who think to defend it? “The just is an accuser of himself in the beginning of his words.” <a name="fr_3636"></a><a href="#fn_3636"><font size="1">3637</font></a>
  He who accuses himself when he has sinned is just, not he who praises himself.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p37"></a>16. I wish, O Emperor, that before this I  <a name="page_453"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 453</font></a> <a name="v.xi-Page_453"></a>had trusted rather to myself, than to your habits. When I consider that you quickly pardon, and quickly revoke your sentence, as you have often done; you have been anticipated, and I have not shunned that which I needed not to fear. But thanks be to the Lord, Who willeth to chastise His servants, that He may not lose them. This I have in common with the prophets, and you shall have it in common with the saints.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="v.xi-p38"></a>17. Shall I not value the father of Gratian more than my very eyes? Your other holy pledges also claim pardon. I conferred beforehand a dear name on those to whom I bore a common love. I follow you with my love, my affection, and my prayers. If you believe me, be guided by me; if, I say, you believe me, acknowledge what I say; if you believe me not, pardon that which I do, in that I set God before you. May you, most august Emperor, with your holy offspring, enjoy perpetual peace with perfect happiness and prosperity.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.xi-p2"></a> The mob at Thessalonica had barbarously murdered a number of the officers of the garrison of that city. The Emperor, being exceedingly angry, sent orders in obedience to which over seven thousand of the inhabitants were cruelly put to death. This act of vengeance shocked the public conscience, and St. Ambrose felt it his duty to speak out in the name of the Church.</p>
