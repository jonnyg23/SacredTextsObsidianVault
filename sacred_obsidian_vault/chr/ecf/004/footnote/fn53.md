 <sup>325 </sup>Because Christ plainly, as they understood Him, "made Himself the Son of God;" and hence, if they confessed that He had said the truth, and yet that they hanged Him on a tree, they would be pronouncing their own condemnation.</p>

 <sup>328 </sup>Quod qui praesumpsit mergentes spargitis ambo. What the meaning is I know not, unless it be this: if any one hints to you that you are in an error which is sinking you into perdition, you both join in trying to sink <i>him</i> (if "mergentes" be active; or "while you are sinking," if neuter), and in sprinkling him with your doctrine (or besprinkling him with abuse).</p>

 <sup>333 </sup>Fel miscetur <i>aceto</i>. The reading may have arisen - and it is not confined to our author - from confounding <font face="SPIonic">ocoj</font> with <font face="SPIonic">oinoj</font>. Comp. Matt. xxvii. 33 with Mark xv. 23.</p>

 <sup>334 </sup>This is an error, if the "coat" be meant.</p>

 <sup>335 </sup>Perhaps for "in ill<i>a</i>" we should read "in all<i>am</i>" - "on it," for "in it."</p>

 <sup>341 </sup>I read with Migne, "<i>Patris</i> sub imagine virtus," in preference to the conjecture which Oehler follows, "<i>Christi </i>sub imagine virtus." The reference seems clearly to be to Heb. i. 3.</p>
