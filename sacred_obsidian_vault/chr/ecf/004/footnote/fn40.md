 <sup>90 </sup>Virgo: a play on the word in connection with the "viro" and what follows.</p>

 <sup>91 </sup>Vir.</p>

 <sup>92 </sup>i.e., Adam's. The constructions, as will be seen, are oddly confused throughout, and I rather suspect some transposition of lines.</p>

 <sup>101 </sup>This would seem to refer to Lazarus; but it seems to be an assumption that his raising took place on a Sabbath.</p>
