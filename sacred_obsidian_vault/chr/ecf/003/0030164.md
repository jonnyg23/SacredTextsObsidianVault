 </p><p class="c30"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iii-p1.1"></a>Chapter III.—The Physical Philosophers Maintained the Divinity of the Elements; The Absurdity of the Tenet Exposed.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="iv.viii.ii.iii-p2"></a>From these developments of opinion, we see that your <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">814</font></a>
  physical class <i>of philosophers</i> are driven to the necessity of contending that the elements are gods, since it alleges that other gods are sprung from them; for it is only from gods that gods could be born. Now, although we shall have to examine these other gods more fully in the proper place, in the mythic section of the poets, yet, inasmuch as we must meanwhile treat of them in their connection with the present class, <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">815</font></a>
  we shall probably even from their present class, <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">816</font></a>
  when once we turn to the gods themselves, succeed in showing that they can by no means appear to be gods who are said to be sprung from the elements; so that we have at once a presumption <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">817</font></a>
  that the elements are not gods, since they which are born of the elements are not gods. In like manner, whilst we show that the elements are not gods, we shall, according to the law of natural relationship, <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">818</font></a>
  get a presumptive argument that they cannot rightly be maintained to be gods whose parents (in this case the elements) are not gods. It is a settled point <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">819</font></a>
  that a god is born of a god, and that what lacks divinity <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">820</font></a>
  is born of what is not divine. Now, so far as <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">821</font></a>
  the world of which your philosophers treat <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">822</font></a>
  (for I apply this term to the <i>universe</i> in the most comprehensive sense <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">823</font></a>
 ) contains the elements, ministering to them as its component parts (for whatever its own condition may be, the same of course will be that of its elements and constituent portions), it must needs have been formed either by some being, according to the enlightened view <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">824</font></a>
  of Plato, or else by none, according to the harsh opinion <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">825</font></a>
  of Epicurus; and since it was formed, by having a beginning, it must also have an end. That, therefore, which at one time before its beginning had no existence, and will by and by after its end cease to have an existence, cannot of course, by any possibility, seem to be a god, wanting as it does that essential character of divinity, eternity, which is reckoned to be <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">826</font></a>
  without beginning, and without end. If, however, it <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">827</font></a>
  is in no wise formed, and therefore ought to be accounted divine—since, as divine, it is subject neither to a beginning nor an end of itself—how is it that some assign generation to the elements, which they hold to be gods, when the Stoics deny that anything can be born of a god? Likewise, how is it that they wish those beings, whom they suppose to be born of the elements, to be regarded as gods, when they deny that a god can be born?  Now, what must hold good of the universe <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">828</font></a>
  will have to be predicated of the elements, I mean of heaven, and of earth, and of the stars, and of fire, which Varro has vainly proposed that you should believe <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">829</font></a>
  to be gods, and the parents of gods, contrary to that generation and nativity which he had declared to be impossible in a god. Now this same Varro had shown that the earth and the <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.ii.iii-Page_132"></a>stars were animated. <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">830</font></a>
  But if this be the case, they must needs be also mortal, according to the condition <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">831</font></a>
  of animated nature; for although the soul is evidently immortal, this attribute is limited to it alone: it is not extended to that with which it is associated, that is, the body. Nobody, however, will deny that the elements have body, since we both touch them and are touched by them, and we see certain bodies fall down from them. If, therefore, they are animated, laying aside the principle <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">832</font></a>
  of a soul, as befits their condition as bodies, they are mortal—of course not immortal. And yet whence is it that the elements appear to Varro to be animated?  Because, forsooth, the elements have motion. And then, in order to anticipate what may be objected on the other side, that many things else have motion—as wheels, as carriages, as several other machines—he volunteers the statement that he believes only such things to be animated as move of themselves, without any apparent mover or impeller from without, like the apparent mover of the wheel, or propeller of the carriage, or director of the machine. If, then, they are not animated, they have no motion of themselves. Now, when he thus alleges a power which is not apparent, he points to what it was his duty to seek after, even the creator and controller of the motion; for it does not at once follow that, because we do not see a thing, we believe that it does not exist. Rather, it is necessary the more profoundly to investigate what one does not see, in order the better to understand the character of that which is apparent. Besides if (you admit) only the existence of those things which appear and are supposed to exist simply because they appear, how is it that you also admit them to be gods which do not appear? If, moreover, those things seem to have existence which have none, why may they not have existence also which do not seem to have it? Such, for instance, as the Mover <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">833</font></a>
  of the heavenly beings. Granted, then, that things are animated because they move of themselves, and that they move of themselves when they are not moved by another:  still it does not follow that they must straightway be gods, because they are animated, nor even because they move of themselves; else what is to prevent all animals whatever being accounted gods, moving as they do of themselves? This, to be sure, is allowed to the Egyptians, but their <i>superstitious</i> vanity has another basis. <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">834</font></a>
