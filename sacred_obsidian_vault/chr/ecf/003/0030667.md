 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.ix.xx-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.ix.xx-p1.1"></a>Chapter XX.—The Scriptures Relied on by Praxeas to Support His Heresy But Few. They are Mentioned by Tertullian.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.ix.xx-p2"></a>But I must take some further pains to rebut their arguments, when they make selections from the Scriptures in support of their opinion, and refuse to consider the other points, which obviously maintain the rule of faith without any infraction of the unity of the Godhead, and with the full admission <a name="fr_8004"></a><a href="#fn_8004"><font size="1">8005</font></a>
  of the Monarchy. For as in the Old Testament Scriptures they lay hold of nothing else than, “I am God, and beside me there is no God;” <a name="fr_8005"></a><a href="#fn_8005"><font size="1">8006</font></a>
  so in the Gospel they simply keep in view the Lords answer to Philip, “I and my Father are one;” <a name="fr_8006"></a><a href="#fn_8006"><font size="1">8007</font></a>
  and, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me.” <a name="fr_8007"></a><a href="#fn_8007"><font size="1">8008</font></a>
  They would have the entire revelation of both Testaments yield to these three passages, whereas the only proper course is to understand the few statements in the light of the many. But in their contention they only act on the principle of all heretics. For, inasmuch as only a few testimonies are to be found (making for them) in the general mass, they pertinaciously set off the few against the many, and assume the later against the earlier. The rule, however, which has been from the beginning established for every case, gives its prescription against the later <i>assumptions</i>, as indeed it also does against the fewer.</p>
