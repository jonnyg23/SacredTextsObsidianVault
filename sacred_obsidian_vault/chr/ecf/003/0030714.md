 <p class="c19"><a name="vi.ii.vi-p2"></a>Whatever, then, our poor ability has attempted to suggest with reference to laying hold of repentance once for all, and perpetually retaining it, does indeed bear upon <i>all</i> who are given up to the Lord, as being all competitors for salvation in earning the favour of God; but is chiefly urgent in the case of those young novices who are only just beginning to bedew <a name="fr_8463"></a><a href="#fn_8463"><font size="1">8464</font></a>
  their ears with divine discourses, and who, as whelps in yet early infancy, and with eyes not yet perfect, creep about uncertainly, and say indeed that they renounce their former deed, and assume (the profession of) repentance, but neglect to complete it. <a name="fr_8464"></a><a href="#fn_8464"><font size="1">8465</font></a>
  For the very end of desiring importunes them to desire somewhat of their former <i>deeds</i>; just as fruits, when they are already beginning to turn into the sourness or bitterness of age, do yet still in some part flatter <a name="fr_8465"></a><a href="#fn_8465"><font size="1">8466</font></a>
  their own loveliness. Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their sins, <i>men</i> meanwhile steal the intervening time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time <a name="fr_8466"></a><a href="#fn_8466"><font size="1">8467</font></a>
  for sinning, rather than a time for learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of sins (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price.  For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award pardon: He proposes the redemption <a name="fr_8467"></a><a href="#fn_8467"><font size="1">8468</font></a>
  of release from penalty at this compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated, <a name="fr_8468"></a><a href="#fn_8468"><font size="1">8469</font></a>
  we believe likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of eternal life, first institutes a probation of our repentance. “But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.” <a name="fr_8469"></a><a href="#fn_8469"><font size="1">8470</font></a>
  By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while <i>the penitent</i> does not yet merit—so far as merit we can—his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts and desertions?  What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan himself <i>before</i> receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the divine benefit—the putting away of sins, I mean—is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say? “Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.” <a name="fr_8470"></a><a href="#fn_8470"><font size="1">8471</font></a>
  Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please over your deeds, “God is light.” <a name="fr_8471"></a><a href="#fn_8471"><font size="1">8472</font></a>
  But some think as if God were under a <i>necessity</i> of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the symbol of death, <a name="fr_8472"></a><a href="#fn_8472"><font size="1">8473</font></a>
  then He does so <i>unwillingly</i>. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted unwillingly?  For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this gift taken away from many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the faith of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the “recruit-classes” of learners, as if on that account he have a licence even now to sin.  As soon as you “know the Lord,” <a name="fr_8473"></a><a href="#fn_8473"><font size="1">8474</font></a>
  you should fear Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does <i>your</i> “knowing” Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in days bygone, when you knew Him <i>not</i>? What, moreover, is it <a name="page_662"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 662</font></a> <a name="vi.ii.vi-Page_662"></a>which distinguishes you from a perfected <a name="fr_8474"></a><a href="#fn_8474"><font size="1">8475</font></a>
  servant of God? Is there one Christ for the baptized, another for the learners?  Have they some different hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different necessity for repentance? That <i>baptismal</i> washing is a sealing of faith, which faith is begun and is commended by the faith of repentance. We are not washed <i>in order that</i> we <i>may</i> cease sinning, but <i>because</i> we <i>have</i> ceased, since in <i>heart</i> we have <i>been</i> bathed <a name="fr_8475"></a><a href="#fn_8475"><font size="1">8476</font></a>
  already. For the <i>first</i> baptism of a learner is <i>this</i>, a perfect fear; <a name="fr_8476"></a><a href="#fn_8476"><font size="1">8477</font></a>
  thenceforward, in so far as you have understanding of the Lord faith <i>is</i> sound, the conscience having once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the <i>baptismal</i> waters that we cease sinning, it is of <i>necessity</i>, not of <i>free-will</i>, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pre-eminent in goodness? he who is not <i>allowed</i>, or he whom <i>it displeases</i>, to be evil? he who is <i>bidden</i>, or he whose <i>pleasure it is</i>, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our persons, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism.  But if any entertain this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more sadness to think that he has <i>ceased</i> from sinning, than gladness that he hath <i>escaped</i> from it. And so it is becoming that learners <i>desire</i> baptism, but do not hastily <i>receive</i> it: for he who desires it, honours it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended, except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of true repentance? for he has feared to continue still in sin, lest he should not merit the reception <i>of baptism</i>. But the hasty receiver, inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it), <i>could</i> not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is, fear. <a name="fr_8477"></a><a href="#fn_8477"><font size="1">8478</font></a>
  Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver. And thus it sometimes deceives, <a name="fr_8478"></a><a href="#fn_8478"><font size="1">8479</font></a>
  for it promises to itself <i>the gift</i> before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish <i>the gift</i> is ever offended.</p>
