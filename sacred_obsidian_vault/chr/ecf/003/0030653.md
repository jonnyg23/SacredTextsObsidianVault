 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.ix.vi-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.ix.vi-p1.1"></a>Chapter VI.—The Word of God is Also the Wisdom of God. The Going Forth of Wisdom to Create the Universe, According to the Divine Plan.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.ix.vi-p2"></a>This power and disposition <a name="fr_7817"></a><a href="#fn_7817"><font size="1">7818</font></a>
  of the Divine Intelligence <a name="fr_7818"></a><a href="#fn_7818"><font size="1">7819</font></a>
  is set forth also in the Scriptures under the name of <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.vi-p4.1"></a>Σοφία</span>, Wisdom; for what can be better entitled to the name of Wisdom <a name="fr_7819"></a><a href="#fn_7819"><font size="1">7820</font></a>
  than the Reason or the Word of God?  Listen therefore to Wisdom herself, constituted in the character of a Second Person: “At the first the Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, with a view to His own works, before He made the earth, before the mountains were settled; moreover, before all the hills did He beget me;” <a name="fr_7820"></a><a href="#fn_7820"><font size="1">7821</font></a>
  that is to say, He created and generated me in His own intelligence. Then, again, observe the distinction between them implied in the companionship of Wisdom with the Lord. “When He prepared the heaven,” says <i>Wisdom</i>, “I was present with Him; and when He made His strong places upon the winds, which are the clouds above; and when He secured the fountains, (and all things) which are beneath the sky, I was by, arranging all things with Him; I was by, in whom He delighted; and daily, too, did I rejoice in His presence.” <a name="fr_7821"></a><a href="#fn_7821"><font size="1">7822</font></a>
  Now, as soon as it pleased God to put forth into their respective substances and forms the things which He had planned and ordered within Himself, in conjunction with His Wisdoms Reason and Word, He first put forth the Word Himself, having within Him His own inseparable Reason and Wisdom, in order that all things might be made through Him through whom they had been planned and disposed, yea, and already made, so far forth as (they were) in the mind and intelligence of God. This, however, was still wanting to them, that they should also be openly known, and kept permanently in their proper forms and substances.</p>
