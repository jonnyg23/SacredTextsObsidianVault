 <a href="0030173.htm">The Original Deities Were Human--With Some Very Questionable Characteristics. Saturn or Time Was Human. Inconsistencies of Opinion About Him.</a><br>
 <a href="0030174.htm">The Gods Human at First.  Who Had the Authority to Make Them Divine? Jupiter Not Only Human, But Immoral.</a><br>

 <a href="0030265.htm">Introduction, by the American Editor.</a><br>
 <a href="0030266.htm">The Prescription Against Heretics.</a><br>
 <a href="0030267.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030268.htm">Analogy Between Fevers and Heresies. Heresies Not to Be Wondered At: Their Strength Derived from Weakness of Men's Faith. They Have Not the Truth. Simile of Pugilists and Gladiators in Illustration.</a><br>
 <a href="0030269.htm">Weak People Fall an Easy Prey to Heresy, Which Derives Strength from the General Frailty of Mankind.  Eminent Men Have Fallen from Faith; Saul, David, Solomon. The Constancy of Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030270.htm">Warnings Against Heresy Given Us in the New Testament. Sundry Passages Adduced. These Imply the Possibility of Falling into Heresy.</a><br>
 <a href="0030271.htm">Heresy, as Well as Schism and Dissension, Disapproved by St. Paul, Who Speaks of the Necessity of Heresies, Not as a Good, But, by the Will of God, Salutary Trials for Training and Approving the Faith of Christians.</a><br>
 <a href="0030272.htm">Heretics are Self-Condemned. Heresy is Self-Will, Whilst Faith is Submission of Our Will to the Divine Authority.  The Heresy of Apelles.</a><br>
 <a href="0030273.htm">Pagan Philosophy the Parent of Heresies. The Connection Between Deflections from Christian Faith and the Old Systems of Pagan Philosophy.</a><br>
 <a href="0030274.htm">Christ's Word, Seek, and Ye Shall Find, No Warrant for Heretical Deviations from the Faith. All Christ's Words to the Jews are for Us, Not Indeed as Specific Commands, But as Principles to Be Applied.</a><br>
 <a href="0030275.htm">The Research After Definite Truth Enjoined on Us. When We Have Discovered This, We Should Be Content.</a><br>
 <a href="0030276.htm">One Has Succeeded in Finding Definite Truth, When He Believes. Heretical Wits are Always Offering Many Things for Vain Discussion, But We are Not to Be Always Seeking.</a><br>
 <a href="0030277.htm">After We Have Believed, Search Should Cease; Otherwise It Must End in a Denial of What We Have Believed.  No Other Object Proposed for Our Faith.</a><br>
 <a href="0030278.htm">A Proper Seeking After Divine Knowledge, Which Will Never Be Out of Place or Excessive, is Always Within the Rule of Faith.</a><br>
 <a href="0030279.htm">Summary of the Creed, or Rule of Faith. No Questions Ever Raised About It by Believers. Heretics Encourage and Perpetuate Thought Independent of Christ's Teaching.</a><br>
 <a href="0030280.htm">Curiosity Ought Not Range Beyond the Rule of Faith. Restless Curiosity, the Feature of Heresy.</a><br>
 <a href="0030281.htm">Heretics Not to Be Allowed to Argue Out of the Scriptures. The Scriptures, in Fact, Do Not Belong to Them.</a><br>
 <a href="0030282.htm">Apostolic Sanction to This Exclusion of Heretics from the Use of the Scriptures. Heretics, According to the Apostle, are Not to Be Disputed With, But to Be Admonished.</a><br>
 <a href="0030283.htm">Heretics, in Fact, Do Not Use, But Only Abuse, Scripture. No Common Ground Between Them and You.</a><br>
 <a href="0030284.htm">Great Evil Ensues to the Weak in Faith, from Any Discussion Out of the Scriptures. Conviction Never Comes to the Heretic from Such a Process.</a><br>
 <a href="0030285.htm">Appeal, in Discussion of Heresy, Lies Not to the Scriptures. The Scriptures Belong Only to Those Who Have the Rule of Faith.</a><br>
 <a href="0030286.htm">Christ First Delivered the Faith. The Apostles Spread It; They Founded Churches as the Depositories Thereof. That Faith, Therefore, is Apostolic, Which Descended from the Apostles, Through Apostolic Churches.</a><br>
 <a href="0030287.htm">All Doctrine True Which Comes Through the Church from the Apostles, Who Were Taught by God Through Christ. All Opinion Which Has No Such Divine Origin and Apostolic Tradition to Show, is Ipso Facto False.</a><br>
 <a href="0030288.htm">Attempt to Invalidate This Rule of Faith Rebutted. The Apostles Safe Transmitters of the Truth. Sufficiently Taught at First, and Faithful in the Transmission.</a><br>
 <a href="0030289.htm">The Apostles Not Ignorant. The Heretical Pretence of St. Peter's Imperfection Because He Was Rebuked by St. Paul. St. Peter Not Rebuked for Error in Teaching.</a><br>
 <a href="0030290.htm">St. Peter's Further Vindication. St. Paul Not Superior to St. Peter in Teaching. Nothing Imparted to the Former in the Third Heaven Enabled Him to Add to the Faith. Heretics Boast as If Favoured with Some of the Secrets Imparted to Him.</a><br>
 <a href="0030291.htm">The Apostles Did Not Keep Back Any of the Deposit of Doctrine Which Christ Had Entrusted to Them.  St. Paul Openly Committed His Whole Doctrine to Timothy.</a><br>
 <a href="0030292.htm">The Apostles Did in All Cases Teach the Whole Truth to the Whole Church. No Reservation, Nor Partial Communication to Favourite Friends.</a><br>
 <a href="0030293.htm">Granted that the Apostles Transmitted the Whole Doctrine of Truth, May Not the Churches Have Been Unfaithful in Handing It On? Inconceivable that This Can Have Been the Case.</a><br>
 <a href="0030294.htm">The One Tradition of the Faith, Which is Substantially Alike in the Churches Everywhere, a Good Proof that the Transmission Has Been True and Honest in the Main.</a><br>
 <a href="0030295.htm">The Truth Not Indebted to the Care of the Heretics; It Had Free Course Before They Appeared.  Priority of the Church's Doctrine a Mark of Its Truth.</a><br>
 <a href="0030296.htm">Comparative Lateness of Heresies. Marcion's Heresy. Some Personal Facts About Him. The Heresy of Apelles. Character of This Man; Philumene; Valentinus; Nigidius, and Hermogenes.</a><br>
 <a href="0030297.htm">Truth First, Falsehood Afterwards, as Its Perversion. Christ's Parable Puts the Sowing of the Good Seed Before the Useless Tares.</a><br>
 <a href="0030298.htm">None of the Heretics Claim Succession from the Apostles. New Churches Still Apostolic, Because Their Faith is that Which the Apostles Taught and Handed Down. The Heretics Challenged to Show Any Apostolic Credentials.</a><br>
 <a href="0030299.htm">Present Heresies (Seedlings of the Tares Noted by the Sacred Writers) Already Condemned in Scripture.  This Descent of Later Heresy from the Earlier Traced in Several Instances.</a><br>
 <a href="0030300.htm">No Early Controversy Respecting the Divine Creator; No Second God Introduced at First. Heresies Condemned Alike by the Sentence and the Silence of Holy Scripture.</a><br>
 <a href="0030301.htm">Let Heretics Maintain Their Claims by a Definite and Intelligible Evidence. This the Only Method of Solving Their Questions.  Catholics Appeal Always to Evidence Traceable to Apostolic Sources.</a><br>
 <a href="0030302.htm">The Apostolic Churches the Voice of the Apostles. Let the Heretics Examine Their Apostolic Claims, in Each Case, Indisputable. The Church of Rome Doubly Apostolic; Its Early Eminence and Excellence. Heresy, as Perverting the Truth, is Connected Therewith.</a><br>
 <a href="0030303.htm">Heretics Not Being Christians, But Rather Perverters of Christ's Teaching, May Not Claim the Christian Scriptures. These are a Deposit, Committed to and Carefully Kept by the Church.</a><br>
 <a href="0030304.htm">Harmony of the Church and the Scriptures. Heretics Have Tampered with the Scriptures, and Mutilated, and Altered Them.  Catholics Never Change the Scriptures, Which Always Testify for Them.</a><br>
 <a href="0030305.htm">What St. Paul Calls Spiritual Wickednesses Displayed by Pagan Authors, and by Heretics, in No Dissimilar Manner. Holy Scripture Especially Liable to Heretical Manipulation. Affords Material for Heresies, Just as Virgil Has Been the Groundwork of Literary Plagiarisms, Different in Purport from the Original.</a><br>
 <a href="0030306.htm">No Difference in the Spirit of Idolatry and of Heresy. In the Rites of Idolatry, Satan Imitated and Distorted the Divine Institutions of the Older Scriptures. The Christian Scriptures Corrupted by Him in the Perversions of the Various Heretics.</a><br>
 <a href="0030307.htm">The Conduct of Heretics:  Its Frivolity, Worldliness, and Irregularity. The Notorious Wantonness of Their Women.</a><br>
 <a href="0030308.htm">Heretics Work to Pull Down and to Destroy, Not to Edify and Elevate. Heretics Do Not Adhere Even to Their Own Traditions, But Harbour Dissent Even from Their Own Founders.</a><br>
 <a href="0030309.htm">Loose Company Preferred by Heretics. Ungodliness the Effect of Their Teaching the Very Opposite of Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear of God, Both in Religious Ordinances and Practical Life.</a><br>
 <a href="0030310.htm">Heresy Lowers Respect for Christ, and Destroys All Fear of His Great Judgment. The Tendency of Heretical Teaching on This Solemn Article of the Faith. The Present Treatise an Introduction to Certain Other Anti-Heretical Works of Our Author.</a><br>
 <a href="0030311.htm">Elucidations.</a><br>
 <a href="0030312.htm">The Five Books Against Marcion.</a><br>
 <a href="0030313.htm">Introductory Notes.</a><br>
 <a href="0030314.htm">Book I</a><br>
 <a href="0030315.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030316.htm">Marcion, Aided by Cerdon, Teaches a Duality of Gods; How He Constructed This Heresy of an Evil and a Good God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030317.htm">The Unity of God.  He is the Supreme Being, and There Cannot Be a Second Supreme.</a><br>
 <a href="0030318.htm">Defence of the Divine Unity Against Objection. No Analogy Between Human Powers and God's Sovereignty. The Objection Otherwise Untenable, for Why Stop at Two Gods?</a><br>
 <a href="0030319.htm">The Dual Principle Falls to the Ground; Plurality of Gods, of Whatever Number, More Consistent. Absurdity and Injury to Piety Resulting from Marcion's Duality.</a><br>
 <a href="0030320.htm">Marcion Untrue to His Theory. He Pretends that His Gods are Equal, But He Really Makes Them Diverse. Then, Allowing Their Divinity, Denies This Diversity.</a><br>
 <a href="0030321.htm">Other Beings Besides God are in Scripture Called God. This Objection Frivolous, for It is Not a Question of Names. The Divine Essence is the Thing at Issue. Heresy, in Its General Terms, Thus Far Treated.</a><br>
 <a href="0030322.htm">Specific Points.  The Novelty of Marcion's God Fatal to His Pretensions. God is from Everlasting, He Cannot Be in Any Wise New.</a><br>
 <a href="0030323.htm">Marcion's Gnostic Pretensions Vain, for the True God is Neither Unknown Nor Uncertain. The Creator, Whom He Owns to Be God, Alone Supplies an Induction, by Which to Judge of the True God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030324.htm">The Creator Was Known as the True God from the First by His Creation. Acknowledged by the Soul and Conscience of Man Before He Was Revealed by Moses.</a><br>
 <a href="0030325.htm">The Evidence for God External to Him; But the External Creation Which Yields This Evidence is Really Not Extraneous, for All Things are God's. Marcion's God, Having Nothing to Show for Himself, No God at All. Marcion's Scheme Absurdly Defective, Not Furnishing Evidence for His New God's Existence, Which Should at Least Be Able to Compete with the Full Evidence of the Creator.</a><br>
 <a href="0030326.htm">Impossibility of Acknowledging God Without This External Evidence Of His Existence. Marcion's Rejection of Such Evidence for His God Savours of Impudence and Malignity.</a><br>
 <a href="0030327.htm">The Marcionites Depreciate the Creation, Which, However, is a Worthy Witness of God. This Worthiness Illustrated by References to the Heathen Philosophers, Who Were Apt to Invest the Several Parts of Creation with Divine Attributes.</a><br>
 <a href="0030328.htm">All Portions of Creation Attest the Excellence of the Creator, Whom Marcion Vilifies. His Inconsistency Herein Exposed. Marcion's Own God Did Not Hesitate to Use the Creator's Works in Instituting His Own Religion.</a><br>
 <a href="0030329.htm">The Lateness of the Revelation of Marcion's God. The Question of the Place Occupied by the Rival Deities. Instead of Two Gods, Marcion Really (Although, as It Would Seem, Unconsciously) Had Nine Gods in His System.</a><br>
 <a href="0030330.htm">Marcion Assumes the Existence of Two Gods from the Antithesis Between Things Visible and Things Invisible. This Antithetical Principle in Fact Characteristic of the Works of the Creator, the One God--Maker of All Things Visible and Invisible.</a><br>
 <a href="0030331.htm">Not Enough, as the Marcionites Pretend, that the Supreme God Should Rescue Man; He Must Also Have Created Him. The Existence of God Proved by His Creation, a Prior Consideration to His Character.</a><br>
 <a href="0030332.htm">Notwithstanding Their Conceits, the God of the Marcionites Fails in the Vouchers Both of Created Evidence and of Adequate Revelation.</a><br>
 <a href="0030333.htm">Jesus Christ, the Revealer of the Creator, Could Not Be the Same as Marcion's God, Who Was Only Made Known by the Heretic Some CXV. Years After Christ, and That, Too, on a Principle Utterly Unsuited to the Teaching of Jesus Christ, I.e., the Opposition Between the Law and the Gospels.</a><br>
 <a href="0030334.htm">Marcion, Justifying His Antithesis Between the Law and the Gospel by the Contention of St. Paul with St. Peter, Shown to Have Mistaken St. Paul's Position and Argument.  Marcion's Doctrine Confuted Out of St. Paul's Teaching, Which Agrees Wholly with the Creator's Decrees.</a><br>
 <a href="0030335.htm">St. Paul Preached No New God, When He Announced the Repeal of Some of God's Ancient Ordinances.  Never Any Hesitation About Belief in the Creator, as the God Whom Christ Revealed, Until Marcion's Heresy.</a><br>
 <a href="0030336.htm">God's Attribute of Goodness Considered as Natural; The God of Marcion Found Wanting Herein. It Came Not to Man's Rescue When First Wanted.</a><br>
 <a href="0030337.htm">God's Attribute of Goodness Considered as Rational. Marcion's God Defective Here Also; His Goodness Irrational and Misapplied.</a><br>
 <a href="0030338.htm">The Goodness of Marcion's God Only Imperfectly Manifested; It Saves But Few, and the Souls Merely of These. Marcion's Contempt of the Body Absurd.</a><br>
 <a href="0030339.htm">God is Not a Being of Simple Goodness; Other Attributes Belong to Him. Marcion Shows Inconsistency in the Portraiture of His Simply Good and Emotionless God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030340.htm">In the Attribute of Justice, Marcion's God is Hopelessly Weak and Ungodlike. He Dislikes Evil, But Does Not Punish Its Perpetration.</a><br>
 <a href="0030341.htm">Dangerous Effects to Religion and Morality of the Doctrine of So Weak a God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030342.htm">This Perverse Doctrine Deprives Baptism of All Its Grace. If Marcion Be Right, the Sacrament Would Confer No Remission of Sins, No Regeneration, No Gift of the Spirit.</a><br>
 <a href="0030343.htm">Marcion Forbids Marriage.  Tertullian Eloquently Defends It as Holy, and Carefully Discriminates Between Marcion's Doctrine and His Own Montanism.</a><br>
 <a href="0030344.htm">Book II</a><br>
 <a href="0030345.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030346.htm">The True Doctrine of God the Creator. The Heretics Pretended to a Knowledge of the Divine Being, Opposed to and Subversive of Revelation. God's Nature and Ways Past Human Discovery. Adam's Heresy.</a><br>
 <a href="0030347.htm">God Known by His Works.  His Goodness Shown in His Creative Energy; But Everlasting in Its Nature; Inherent in God, Previous to All Exhibition of It. The First Stage of This Goodness Prior to Man.</a><br>
 <a href="0030348.htm">The Next Stage Occurs in the Creation of Man by the Eternal Word. Spiritual as Well as Physical Gifts to Man. The Blessings of Man's Free-Will.</a><br>
 <a href="0030349.htm">Marcion's Cavils Considered. His Objection Refuted, I.e., Man's Fall Showed Failure in God. The Perfection of Man's Being Lay in His Liberty, Which God Purposely Bestowed on Him. The Fall Imputable to Man's Own Choice.</a><br>
 <a href="0030350.htm">This Liberty Vindicated in Respect of Its Original Creation; Suitable Also for Exhibiting the Goodness and the Purpose of God. Reward and Punishment Impossible If Man Were Good or Evil Through Necessity and Not Choice.</a><br>
 <a href="0030351.htm">If God Had Anyhow Checked Man's Liberty, Marcion Would Have Been Ready with Another and Opposite Cavil. Man's Fall Foreseen by God. Provision Made for It Remedially and Consistently with His Truth and Goodness.</a><br>
 <a href="0030352.htm">Man, Endued with Liberty, Superior to the Angels, Overcomes Even the Angel Which Lured Him to His Fall, When Repentant and Resuming Obedience to God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030353.htm">Another Cavil Answered, I.e., the Fall Imputable to God, Because Man's Soul is a Portion of the Spiritual Essence of the Creator. The Divine Afflatus Not in Fault in the Sin of Man, But the Human Will Which Was Additional to It.</a><br>
 <a href="0030354.htm">Another Cavil Met, I.e., the Devil Who Instigated Man to Sin Himself the Creature of God. Nay, the Primeval Cherub Only Was God's Work.  The Devilish Nature Superadded by Wilfulness. In Man's Recovery the Devil is Vanquished in a Conflict on His Own Ground.</a><br>
 <a href="0030355.htm">If, After Man's Sin, God Exercised His Attribute of Justice and Judgment, This Was Compatible with His Goodness, and Enhances the True Idea of the Perfection of God's Character.</a><br>
 <a href="0030356.htm">The Attributes of Goodness and Justice Should Not Be Separated. They are Compatible in the True God. The Function of Justice in the Divine Being Described.</a><br>
 <a href="0030357.htm">Further Description of the Divine Justice; Since the Fall of Man It Has Regulated the Divine Goodness.  God's Claims on Our Love and Our Fear Reconciled.</a><br>
 <a href="0030358.htm">Evil of Two Kinds, Penal and Criminal. It is Not of the Latter Sort that God is the Author, But Only of the Former, Which are Penal, and Included in His Justice.</a><br>
 <a href="0030359.htm">The Severity of God Compatible with Reason and Justice. When Inflicted, Not Meant to Be Arbitrary, But Remedial.</a><br>
 <a href="0030360.htm">To the Severity of God There Belong Accessory Qualities, Compatible with Justice. If Human Passions are Predicated of God, They Must Not Be Measured on the Scale of Human Imperfection.</a><br>
 <a href="0030361.htm">Trace God's Government in History and in His Precepts, and You Will Find It Full of His Goodness.</a><br>
 <a href="0030362.htm">Some of God's Laws Defended as Good, Which the Marcionites Impeached, Such as the Lex Talionis. Useful Purposes in a Social and Moral Point of View of This, and Sundry Other Enactments.</a><br>
 <a href="0030363.htm">The Minute Prescriptions of the Law Meant to Keep the People Dependent on God. The Prophets Sent by God in Pursuance of His Goodness.  Many Beautiful Passages from Them Quoted in Illustration of This Attribute.</a><br>
 <a href="0030364.htm">The Marcionites Charged God with Having Instigated the Hebrews to Spoil the Egyptians. Defence of the Divine Dispensation in that Matter.</a><br>
 <a href="0030365.htm">The Law of the Sabbath-Day Explained. The Eight Days' Procession Around Jericho. The Gathering of Sticks a Violation.</a><br>
 <a href="0030366.htm">The Brazen Serpent and the Golden Cherubim Were Not Violations of the Second Commandment.  Their Meaning.</a><br>
 <a href="0030367.htm">God's Purposes in Election and Rejection of the Same Men, Such as King Saul, Explained, in Answer to the Marcionite Cavil.</a><br>
 <a href="0030368.htm">Instances of God's Repentance, and Notably in the Case of the Ninevites, Accounted for and Vindicated.</a><br>
 <a href="0030369.htm">God's Dealings with Adam at the Fall, and with Cain After His Crime, Admirably Explained and Defended.</a><br>
 <a href="0030370.htm">The Oath of God:  Its Meaning. Moses, When Deprecating God's Wrath Against Israel, a Type of Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030371.htm">Other Objections Considered. God's Condescension in the Incarnation. Nothing Derogatory to the Divine Being in This Economy. The Divine Majesty Worthily Sustained by the Almighty Father, Never Visible to Man. Perverseness of the Marcionite Cavils.</a><br>
 <a href="0030372.htm">The Tables Turned Upon Marcion, by Contrasts, in Favour of the True God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030373.htm">Marcion's Own Antitheses, If Only the Title and Object of the Work Be Excepted, Afford Proofs of the Consistent Attributes of the True God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030374.htm">Book III</a><br>
 <a href="0030375.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030376.htm">Why Christ's Coming Should Be Previously Announced.</a><br>
 <a href="0030377.htm">Miracles Alone, Without Prophecy, an Insufficient Evidence of Christ's Mission.</a><br>
 <a href="0030378.htm">Marcion's Christ Not the Subject of Prophecy. The Absurd Consequences of This Theory of the Heretic.</a><br>
 <a href="0030379.htm">Sundry Features of the Prophetic Style: Principles of Its Interpretation.</a><br>
 <a href="0030380.htm">Community in Certain Points of Marcionite and Jewish Error. Prophecies of Christ's Rejection Examined.</a><br>
 <a href="0030381.htm">Prophecy Sets Forth Two Different Conditions of Christ, One Lowly, the Other Majestic. This Fact Points to Two Advents of Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030382.htm">Absurdity of Marcion's Docetic Opinions; Reality of Christ's Incarnation.</a><br>
 <a href="0030383.htm">Refutation of Marcion's Objections Derived from the Cases of the Angels, and the Pre-Incarnate Manifestations of the Son of God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030384.htm">The Truly Incarnate State More Worthy of God Than Marcion's Fantastic Flesh.</a><br>
 <a href="0030385.htm">Christ Was Truly Born; Marcion's Absurd Cavil in Defence of a Putative Nativity.</a><br>
 <a href="0030386.htm">Isaiah's Prophecy of Emmanuel. Christ Entitled to that Name.</a><br>
 <a href="0030387.htm">Isaiah's Prophecies Considered. The Virginity of Christ's Mother a Sign. Other Prophecies Also Signs. Metaphorical Sense of Proper Names in Sundry Passages of the Prophets.</a><br>
 <a href="0030388.htm">Figurative Style of Certain Messianic Prophecies in the Psalms. Military Metaphors Applied to Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030389.htm">The Title Christ Suitable as a Name of the Creator's Son, But Unsuited to Marcion's Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030390.htm">The Sacred Name Jesus Most Suited to the Christ of the Creator. Joshua a Type of Him.</a><br>
 <a href="0030391.htm">Prophecies in Isaiah and the Psalms Respecting Christ's Humiliation.</a><br>
 <a href="0030392.htm">Types of the Death of Christ. Isaac; Joseph; Jacob Against Simeon and Levi; Moses Praying Against Amalek; The Brazen Serpent.</a><br>
 <a href="0030393.htm">Prophecies of the Death of Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030394.htm">The Subsequent Influence of Christ's Death in the World Predicted. The Sure Mercies of David. What These are.</a><br>
 <a href="0030395.htm">The Call of the Gentiles Under the Influence of the Gospel Foretold.</a><br>
 <a href="0030396.htm">The Success of the Apostles, and Their Sufferings in the Cause of the Gospel, Foretold.</a><br>
 <a href="0030397.htm">The Dispersion of the Jews, and Their Desolate Condition for Rejecting Christ, Foretold.</a><br>
 <a href="0030398.htm">Christ's Millennial and Heavenly Glory in Company with His Saints.</a><br>
 <a href="0030399.htm">Book IV</a><br>
 <a href="0030400.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030401.htm">St. Luke's Gospel, Selected by Marcion as His Authority, and Mutilated by Him. The Other Gospels Equally Authoritative. Marcion's Terms of Discussion, However, Accepted, and Grappled with on the Footing of St. Luke's Gospel Alone.</a><br>
 <a href="0030402.htm">Marcion Insinuated the Untrustworthiness of Certain Apostles Whom St. Paul Rebuked. The Rebuke Shows that It Cannot Be Regarded as Derogating from Their Authority. The Apostolic Gospels Perfectly Authentic.</a><br>
 <a href="0030403.htm">Each Side Claims to Possess the True Gospel. Antiquity the Criterion of Truth in Such a Matter. Marcion's Pretensions as an Amender of the Gospel.</a><br>
 <a href="0030404.htm">By the Rule of Antiquity, the Catholic Gospels are Found to Be True, Including the Real St. Luke's. Marcion's Only a Mutilated Edition. The Heretic's Weakness and Inconsistency in Ignoring the Other Gospels.</a><br>
 <a href="0030405.htm">Marcion's Object in Adulterating the Gospel. No Difference Between the Christ of the Creator and the Christ of the Gospel. No Rival Christ Admissible. The Connection of the True Christ with the Dispensation of the Old Testament Asserted.</a><br>
 <a href="0030406.htm">Marcion Rejected the Preceding Portion of St. Luke's Gospel. Therefore This Review Opens with an Examination of the Case of the Evil Spirit in the Synagogue of Capernaum. He Whom the Demon Acknowledged Was the Creator's Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030407.htm">Other Proofs from the Same Chapter, that Jesus, Who Preached at Nazareth, and Was Acknowledged by Certain Demons as Christ the Son of God, Was the Creator's Christ. As Occasion Offers, the Docetic Errors of Marcion are Exposed.</a><br>
 <a href="0030408.htm">Out of St. Luke's Fifth Chapter are Found Proofs of Christ's Belonging to the Creator, E.g. In the Call of Fishermen to the Apostolic Office, and in the Cleansing of the Leper. Christ Compared with the Prophet Elisha.</a><br>

 <a href="0030446.htm">Book V</a><br>
 <a href="0030447.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030448.htm">On the Epistle to the Galatians. The Abolition of the Ordinances of the Mosaic Law No Proof of Another God. The Divine Lawgiver, the Creator Himself, Was the Abrogator. The Apostle's Doctrine in the First Chapter Shown to Accord with the Teaching of the Old Testament. The Acts of the Apostles Shown to Be Genuine Against Marcion. This Book Agrees with the Pauline Epistles.</a><br>
 <a href="0030449.htm">St. Paul Quite in Accordance with St. Peter and Other Apostles of the Circumcision. His Censure of St. Peter Explained, and Rescued from Marcion's Misapplication. The Strong Protests of This Epistle Against Judaizers. Yet Its Teaching is Shown to Be in Keeping with the Law and the Prophets.  Marcion's Tampering with St. Paul's Writings Censured.</a><br>
 <a href="0030450.htm">Another Instance of Marcion's Tampering with St. Paul's Text. The Fulness of Time, Announced by the Apostle, Foretold by the Prophets.  Mosaic Rites Abrogated by the Creator Himself. Marcion's Tricks About Abraham's Name. The Creator, by His Christ, the Fountain of the Grace and the Liberty Which St. Paul Announced. Marcion's Docetism Refuted.</a><br>
 <a href="0030451.htm">The First Epistle to the Corinthians. The Pauline Salutation of Grace and Peace Shown to Be Anti-Marcionite. The Cross of Christ Purposed by the Creator.  Marcion Only Perpetuates the Offence and Foolishness of Christ's Cross by His Impious Severance of the Gospel from the Creator. Analogies Between the Law and the Gospel in the Matter of Weak Things, and Foolish Things and Base Things.</a><br>
 <a href="0030452.htm">The Divine Way of Wisdom, and Greatness, and Might. God's Hiding of Himself, and Subsequent Revelation. To Marcion's God Such a Concealment and Manifestation Impossible.  God's Predestination. No Such Prior System of Intention Possible to a God Previously Unknown as Was Marcion's. The Powers of the World Which Crucified Christ. St. Paul, as a Wise Master-Builder, Associated with Prophecy.  Sundry Injunctions of the Apostle Parallel with the Teaching of the Old Testament.</a><br>
 <a href="0030453.htm">St. Paul's Phraseology Often Suggested by the Jewish Scriptures. Christ Our Passover--A Phrase Which Introduces Us to the Very Heart of the Ancient Dispensation. Christ's True Corporeity. Married and Unmarried States. Meaning of the Time is Short. In His Exhortations and Doctrine, the Apostle Wholly Teaches According to the Mind and Purposes of the God of the Old Testament. Prohibition of Meats and Drinks Withdrawn by the Creator.</a><br>
 <a href="0030454.htm">Man the Image of the Creator, and Christ the Head of the Man. Spiritual Gifts. The Sevenfold Spirit Described by Isaiah. The Apostle and the Prophet Compared. Marcion Challenged to Produce Anything Like These Gifts of the Spirit Foretold in Prophecy in His God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030455.htm">The Doctrine of the Resurrection. The Body Will Rise Again. Christ's Judicial Character. Jewish Perversions of Prophecy Exposed and Confuted. Messianic Psalms Vindicated. Jewish and Rationalistic Interpretations on This Point Similar.  Jesus--Not Hezekiah or Solomon--The Subject of These Prophecies in the Psalms. None But He is the Christ of the Old and the New Testaments.</a><br>
 <a href="0030456.htm">Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body, Continued. How are the Dead Raised? and with What Body Do They Come? These Questions Answered in Such a Sense as to Maintain the Truth of the Raised Body, Against Marcion. Christ as the Second Adam Connected with the Creator of the First Man.  Let Us Bear the Image of the Heavenly.  The Triumph Over Death in Accordance with the Prophets. Hosea and St. Paul Compared.</a><br>

The Veil of Obdurate Blindness Upon Israel, Not Reprehensible on Marcion's Principles. The Jews Guilty in Rejecting the Christ of the Creator. Satan, the God of This World. The Treasure in Earthen Vessels Explained Against Marcion. The Creator's Relation to These Vessels, I.e. Our Bodies.</a><br>
 <a href="0030458.htm">The Eternal Home in Heaven. Beautiful Exposition by Tertullian of the Apostle's Consolatory Teaching Against the Fear of Death, So Apt to Arise Under Anti-Christian Oppression. The Judgment-Seat of Christ--The Idea, Anti-Marcionite.  Paradise. Judicial Characteristics of Christ Which are Inconsistent with the Heretical Views About Him; The Apostle's Sharpness, or Severity, Shows Him to Be a Fit Preacher of the Creator's Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="0030459.htm">The Epistle to the Romans. St. Paul Cannot Help Using Phrases Which Bespeak the Justice of God, Even When He is Eulogizing the Mercies of the Gospel. Marcion Particularly Hard in Mutilation of This Epistle. Yet Our Author Argues on Common Ground. The Judgment at Last Will Be in Accordance with the Gospel. The Justified by Faith Exhorted to Have Peace with God. The Administration of the Old and the New Dispensations in One and the Same Hand.</a><br>
 <a href="0030460.htm">The Divine Power Shown in Christ's Incarnation. Meaning of St. Paul's Phrase. Likeness of Sinful Flesh. No Docetism in It. Resurrection of Our Real Bodies. A Wide Chasm Made in the Epistle by Marcion's Erasure. When the Jews are Upbraided by the Apostle for Their Misconduct to God; Inasmuch as that God Was the Creator, a Proof is in Fact Given that St. Paul's God Was the Creator. The Precepts at the End of the Epistle, Which Marcion Allowed, Shown to Be in Exact Accordance with the Creator's Scriptures.</a><br>
 <a href="0030461.htm">The First Epistle to the Thessalonians. The Shorter Epistles Pungent in Sense and Very Valuable. St. Paul Upbraids the Jews for the Death First of Their Prophets and Then of Christ. This a Presumption that Both Christ and the Prophets Pertained to the Same God. The Law of Nature, Which is in Fact the Creator's Discipline, and the Gospel of Christ Both Enjoin Chastity. The Resurrection Provided for in the Old Testament by Christ. Man's Compound Nature.</a><br>
 <a href="0030462.htm">The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians. An Absurd Erasure of Marcion; Its Object Transparent. The Final Judgment on the Heathen as Well as the Jews Could Not Be Administered by Marcion's Christ. The Man of Sin--What? Inconsistency of Marcion's View. The Antichrist. The Great Events of the Last Apostasy Within the Providence and Intention of the Creator, Whose are All Things from the Beginning. Similarity of the Pauline Precepts with Those of the Creator.</a><br>
 <a href="0030463.htm">The Epistle to the Laodiceans. The Proper Designation is to the Ephesians. Recapitulation of All Things in Christ from the Beginning of the Creation.  No Room for Marcion's Christ Here.  Numerous Parallels Between This Epistle and Passages in the Old Testament. The Prince of the Power of the Air, and the God of This World--Who?  Creation and Regeneration the Work of One God. How Christ Has Made the Law Obsolete. A Vain Erasure of Marcion's. The Apostles as Well as the Prophets from the Creator.</a><br>
 <a href="0030464.htm">Another Foolish Erasure of Marcion's Exposed. Certain Figurative Expressions of the Apostle, Suggested by the Language of the Old Testament. Collation of Many Passages of This Epistle, with Precepts and Statements in the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and the Prophets. All Alike Teach Us the Will and Purpose of the Creator.</a><br>
 <a href="0030465.htm">The Epistle to the Colossians. Time the Criterion of Truth and Heresy. Application of the Canon. The Image of the Invisible God Explained. Pre-Existence of Our Christ in the Creator's Ancient Dispensations.  What is Included in the Fulness of Christ. The Epicurean Character of Marcion's God. The Catholic Truth in Opposition Thereto. The Law is to Christ What the Shadow is to the Substance.</a><br>
 <a href="0030466.htm">The Epistle to the Philippians. The Variances Amongst the Preachers of Christ No Argument that There Was More Than One Only Christ. St. Paul's Phrases--Form of a Servant, Likeness, and Fashion of a Man--No Sanction of Docetism. No Antithesis (Such as Marcion Alleged) in the God of Judaism and the God of the Gospel Deducible from Certain Contrasts Mentioned in This Epistle. A Parallel with a Passage in Genesis. The Resurrection of the Body, and the Change Thereof.</a><br>
 <a href="0030467.htm">The Epistle to Philemon.  This Epistle Not Mutilated.  Marcion's Inconsistency in Accepting This, and Rejecting Three Other Epistles Addressed to Individuals.  Conclusions. Tertullian Vindicates the Symmetry and Deliberate Purpose of His Work Against Marcion.</a><br>

 <a href="0030469.htm">Against Hermogenes.</a><br>
 <a href="0030470.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030471.htm">Hermogenes, After a Perverse Induction from Mere Heretical Assumptions, Concludes that God Created All Things Out of Pre-Existing Matter.</a><br>
 <a href="0030472.htm">An Argument of Hermogenes. The Answer:  While God is a Title Eternally Applicable to the Divine Being, Lord and Father are Only Relative Appellations, Not Eternally Applicable. An Inconsistency in the Argument of Hermogenes Pointed Out.</a><br>
 <a href="0030473.htm">Hermogenes Gives Divine Attributes to Matter, and So Makes Two Gods.</a><br>
 <a href="0030474.htm">Hermogenes Coquets with His Own Argument, as If Rather Afraid of It. After Investing Matter with Divine Qualities, He Tries to Make It Somehow Inferior to God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030475.htm">The Shifts to Which Hermogenes is Reduced, Who Deifies Matter, and Yet is Unwilling to Hold Him Equal with the Divine Creator.</a><br>
 <a href="0030476.htm">Hermogenes Held to His Theory in Order that Its Absurdity May Be Exposed on His Own Principles.</a><br>
 <a href="0030477.htm">On His Own Principles, Hermogenes Makes Matter, on the Whole, Superior to God.</a><br>
 <a href="0030478.htm">Sundry Inevitable But Intolerable Conclusions from the Principles of Hermogenes.</a><br>
 <a href="0030479.htm">To What Straits Hermogenes Absurdly Reduces the Divine Being. He Does Nothing Short of Making Him the Author of Evil.</a><br>
 <a href="0030480.htm">Hermogenes Makes Great Efforts to Remove Evil from God to Matter. How He Fails to Do This Consistently with His Own Argument.</a><br>
 <a href="0030481.htm">The Mode of Controversy Changed. The Premisses of Hermogenes Accepted, in Order to Show into What Confusion They Lead Him.</a><br>

 <a href="0030484.htm">The Truth, that God Made All Things from Nothing, Rescued from the Opponent's Flounderings.</a><br>
 <a href="0030485.htm">A Series of Dilemmas.  They Show that Hermogenes Cannot Escape from the Orthodox Conclusion.</a><br>
 <a href="0030486.htm">The Truth of God's Work in Creation. You Cannot Depart in the Least from It, Without Landing Yourself in an Absurdity.</a><br>
 <a href="0030487.htm">An Eulogy on the Wisdom and Word of God, by Which God Made All Things of Nothing.</a><br>
 <a href="0030488.htm">An Appeal to the History of Creation.  True Meaning of the Term Beginning, Which the Heretic Curiously Wrests to an Absurd Sense.</a><br>
 <a href="0030489.htm">Meaning of the Phrase--In the Beginning. Tertullian Connects It with the Wisdom of God, and Elicits from It the Truth that the Creation Was Not Out of Pre-Existent Matter.</a><br>
 <a href="0030490.htm">A Retort of Heresy Answered. That Scripture Should in So Many Words Tell Us that the World Was Made of Nothing is Superfluous.</a><br>
 <a href="0030491.htm">This Conclusion Confirmed by the Usage of Holy Scripture in Its History of the Creation.  Hermogenes in Danger of the Woe Pronounced Against Adding to Scripture.</a><br>
 <a href="0030492.htm">Hermogenes Pursued to Another Passage of Scripture. The Absurdity of His Interpretation Exposed.</a><br>
 <a href="0030493.htm">Earth Does Not Mean Matter as Hermogenes Would Have It.</a><br>
 <a href="0030494.htm">The Assumption that There are Two Earths Mentioned in the History of the Creation, Refuted.</a><br>
 <a href="0030495.htm">The Method Observed in the History of the Creation, in Reply to the Perverse Interpretation of Hermogenes.</a><br>
 <a href="0030496.htm">Some Hair-Splitting Use of Words in Which His Opponent Had Indulged.</a><br>

 <a href="0030501.htm">The Account of the Creation in Genesis a General One, Corroborated, However, by Many Other Passages of the Old Testament, Which Give Account of Specific Creations. Further Cavillings Confuted.</a><br>
 <a href="0030502.htm">Statement of the True Doctrine Concerning Matter. Its Relation to God's Creation of the World.</a><br>
 <a href="0030503.htm">A Presumption that All Things Were Created by God Out of Nothing Afforded by the Ultimate Reduction of All Things to Nothing. Scriptures Proving This Reduction Vindicated from Hermogenes' Charge of Being Merely Figurative.</a><br>

 <a href="0030508.htm">These Latter Speculations Shown to Be Contradictory to the First Principles Respecting Matter, Formerly Laid Down by Hermogenes.</a><br>
 <a href="0030509.htm">Shapeless Matter an Incongruous Origin for God's Beautiful Cosmos. Hermogenes Does Not Mend His Argument by Supposing that Only a Portion of Matter Was Used in the Creation.</a><br>
 <a href="0030510.htm">Sundry Quotations from Hermogenes. Now Uncertain and Vague are His Speculations Respecting Motion in Matter, and the Material Qualities of Good and Evil.</a><br>

 <a href="0030515.htm">Against the Valentinians.</a><br>
 <a href="0030516.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030517.htm">These Heretics Brand the Christians as Simple Persons. The Charge Accepted, and Simplicity Eulogized Out of the Scriptures.</a><br>
 <a href="0030518.htm">The Folly of This Heresy.  It Dissects and Mutilates the Deity.  Contrasted with the Simple Wisdom of True Religion. To Expose the Absurdities of the Valentinian System is to Destroy It.</a><br>
 <a href="0030519.htm">The Heresy Traceable to Valentinus, an Able But Restless Man. Many Schismatical Leaders of the School Mentioned. Only One of Them Shows Respect to the Man Whose Name Designates the Entire School.</a><br>
 <a href="0030520.htm">Many Eminent Christian Writers Have Carefully and Fully Refuted the Heresy. These the Author Makes His Own Guides.</a><br>
 <a href="0030521.htm">Although Writing in Latin He Proposes to Retain the Greek Names of the Valentinian Emanations of Deity.  Not to Discuss the Heresy But Only to Expose It. This with the Raillery Which Its Absurdity Merits.</a><br>
 <a href="0030522.htm">The First Eight Emanations, or Æons, Called the Ogdoad, are the Fountain of All the Others.  Their Names and Descent Recorded.</a><br>
 <a href="0030523.htm">The Names and Descent of Other Æons; First Half a Score, Then Two More, and Ultimately a Dozen Besides.  These Thirty Constitute the Pleroma.  But Why Be So Capricious as to Stop at Thirty?</a><br>
 <a href="0030524.htm">Other Capricious Features in the System. The Æons Unequal in Attributes. The Superiority of Nus; The Vagaries of Sophia Restrained by Horos. Grand Titles Borne by This Last Power.</a><br>
 <a href="0030525.htm">Another Account of the Strange Aberrations of Sophia, and the Restraining Services of Horus.  Sophia Was Not Herself, After All, Ejected from the Pleroma, But Only Her Enthymesis.</a><br>
 <a href="0030526.htm">The Profane Account Given of the Origin of Christ and the Holy Ghost Sternly Rebuked. An Absurdity Respecting the Attainment of the Knowledge of God Ably Exposed.</a><br>
 <a href="0030527.htm">The Strange Jumble of the Pleroma. The Frantic Delight of the Members Thereof. Their Joint Contribution of Parts Set Forth with Humorous Irony.</a><br>
 <a href="0030528.htm">First Part of the Subject, Touching the Constitution of the Pleroma, Briefly Recapitulated.  Transition to the Other Part, Which is Like a Play Outside the Curtain.</a><br>

 <a href="0030583.htm">Chapter I</a><br>
 <a href="0030584.htm">The Jewish Sadducees a Link Between the Pagan Philosophers and the Heretics on This Doctrine.  Its Fundamental Importance Asserted.  The Soul Fares Better Than the Body, in Heretical Estimation, as to Its Future State. Its Extinction, However, Was Held by One Lucan.</a><br>
 <a href="0030585.htm">Some Truths Held Even by the Heathen. They Were, However, More Often Wrong Both in Religious Opinions and in Moral Practice.  The Heathen Not to Be Followed in Their Ignorance of the Christian Mystery. The Heretics Perversely Prone to Follow Them.</a><br>
 <a href="0030586.htm">Heathens and Heretics Alike in Their Vilification of the Flesh and Its Functions, the Ordinary Cavils Against the Final Restitution of So Weak and Ignoble a Substance.</a><br>
 <a href="0030587.htm">Some Considerations in Reply Eulogistic of the Flesh. It Was Created by God. The Body of Man Was, in Fact, Previous to His Soul.</a><br>
 <a href="0030588.htm">Not the Lowliness of the Material, But the Dignity and Skill of the Maker, Must Be Remembered, in Gauging the Excellence of the Flesh. Christ Partook of Our Flesh.</a><br>
 <a href="0030589.htm">The Earthy Material of Which Flesh is Created Wonderfully Improved by God's Manipulation. By the Addition of the Soul in Man's Constitution It Became the Chief Work in the Creation.</a><br>
 <a href="0030590.htm">Christianity, by Its Provision for the Flesh, Has Put on It the Greatest Honour. The Privileges of Our Religion in Closest Connection with Our Flesh. Which Also Bears a Large Share in the Duties and Sacrifices of Religion.</a><br>

 <a href="0030596.htm">A Sufficient Cause for the Resurrection of the Flesh Occurs in the Future Judgment of Man. It Will Take Cognisance of the Works of the Body No Less Than of the Soul.</a><br>
 <a href="0030597.htm">As the Flesh is a Partaker with the Soul in All Human Conduct, So Will It Be in the Recompense of Eternity.</a><br>
 <a href="0030598.htm">The Heretics Called the Flesh “The Vessel of the Soul,” In Order to Destroy the Responsibility of the Body. Their Cavil Turns Upon Themselves and Shows the Flesh to Be a Sharer in Human Actions.</a><br>

 <a href="0030602.htm">Figurative Senses Have Their Foundation in Literal Fact. Besides, the Allegorical Style is by No Means the Only One Found in the Prophetic Scriptures, as Alleged by the Heretics.</a><br>
 <a href="0030603.htm">No Mere Metaphor in the Phrase Resurrection of the Dead. In Proportion to the Importance of Eternal Truths, is the Clearness of Their Scriptural Enunciation.</a><br>
