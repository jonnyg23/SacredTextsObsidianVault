 <p class="c19"><a name="iv.iv.vii-p2"></a>A whole day the zeal of faith will direct its pleadings to this quarter: bewailing that a Christian should come from idols into the Church; should come from an adversary workshop into the house of God; should raise to God the Father hands which are the mothers of idols; should pray to God with the hands which, out of doors, are prayed to in opposition to God; should apply to the Lords body those hands which confer bodies on demons. Nor is this sufficient. Grant that it be a small matter, if from other hands they receive what they contaminate; but even those very hands deliver to others what they have contaminated. Idol-artificers are chosen even into the ecclesiastical order. Oh wickedness! Once did the Jews lay brands on Christ; these mangle His body daily.  Oh hands to be cut off! Now let the saying, “If thy hand make thee do evil, amputate it,” <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">200</font></a>
  see to it whether it were uttered by way of similitude <i>merely</i>. What hands more to be amputated than those in which scandal is done to the Lords body?</p>
