 <p class="c19"><a name="v.vi.xxxv-p2"></a>There are some who do not claim the first place for Bythus, but only a lower one. They put their Ogdoad in the foremost rank; itself, however, derived from a Tetrad, but under different names. For they put Pro-arche (<i>Before the Beginning</i>) first, Anennœtos (<i>Inconceivable</i>) second, Arrhetos (<i>Indescribable</i>) third, Aoratos (<i>Invisible</i>) fourth. Then after Pro-arche they say Arche (<i>Beginning</i>) came forth and occupied the first and the fifth place; from Anennœtos came Acataleptos (<i>Incomprehensible</i>) in the second and the sixth place; from Arrhetos came Anonomastos (<i>Nameless</i>) in the third and the seventh place; from Aoratos <a name="fr_6918"></a><a href="#fn_6918"><font size="1">6919</font></a>
  came Agennetos (<i>Unbegotten</i>) in the fourth and the eight place. Now by what method he arranges this, that each of these Æons should be born in two places, and that, too, at such intervals, I prefer to be ignorant of than to be informed. For what can be right in a system which is propounded with such absurd particulars?</p>
