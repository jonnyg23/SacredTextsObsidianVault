Ungodliness the Effect of Their Teaching the Very Opposite of Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear of God, Both in Religious Ordinances and Practical Life.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.iii.xliii-p2"></a>It has also been a subject of remark, how extremely frequent is the intercourse which heretics hold with magicians, with mountebanks, with astrologers, with philosophers; and the reason is, <a name="fr_2292"></a><a href="#fn_2292"><font size="1">2293</font></a>
  that they are men who devote themselves to curious questions. “Seek, and ye shall find,” is everywhere in their minds. Thus, from the very nature of their conduct, may be estimated the quality of their faith. In their discipline we have an index of their doctrine. They say that God is not to be feared; therefore all things are in their view free and unchecked. Where, however is God not feared, except where He <i>is</i> not? Where God is not, there truth also is not. Where there is no truth, then, naturally enough, there is also such a discipline as theirs. But where God is, there exists “the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom.” <a name="fr_2293"></a><a href="#fn_2293"><font size="1">2294</font></a>
  Where the fear of God is, there is seriousness, an honourable and yet thoughtful <a name="fr_2294"></a><a href="#fn_2294"><font size="1">2295</font></a>
  diligence, as well as an anxious carefulness and a well-considered admission (to the sacred ministry) <a name="fr_2295"></a><a href="#fn_2295"><font size="1">2296</font></a>
  and a safely-guarded <a name="fr_2296"></a><a href="#fn_2296"><font size="1">2297</font></a>
  communion, and promotion after good service, and a scrupulous submission (to authority), and a devout attendance, <a name="fr_2297"></a><a href="#fn_2297"><font size="1">2298</font></a>
  and a modest gait, and a united church, and God <i>in</i> all things.</p>
