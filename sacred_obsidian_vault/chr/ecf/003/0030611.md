 <p class="c19"><a name="v.viii.xxix-p2"></a>Inasmuch, then, as even the figurative portions of Scripture, and the arguments of facts, and some plain statements <i>of Holy Writ</i>, throw light upon the resurrection of the flesh (although without specially naming the very substance), how much more effectual for de<a name="page_566"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 566</font></a> <a name="v.viii.xxix-Page_566"></a>termining the question will not those passages be which indicate the actual substance of the body by expressly mentioning it! Take Ezekiel: “And the hand of the Lord,” says he, “was upon me; and the Lord brought me forth in the Spirit, and set me in the midst of a plain which was full of bones; and He led me round about them in a circuit: and, behold, there were many on the face of the plain; and, lo, they were very dry. And He said unto me, Son of man, will these bones live? And I said, O Lord God, Thou knowest. And He said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones; and thou shalt say, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God to these bones, Behold, I bring upon you the breath <i>of life</i>, and ye shall live: and I will give unto you the spirit, and I will place muscles over you, and I will spread skin upon you; and ye shall live, and shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as the Lord commanded me: and while I prophesy, behold there is a voice, behold also a movement, and bones approached bones. And I saw, and behold sinews and flesh came up over them, and muscles were placed around them; but there was no breath in them. And He said unto me, Prophesy to the wind, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe in these dead men, and let them live. So I prophesied to the wind, as He commanded me, and the spirit entered into the bones, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, strong and exceeding many. And <i>the Lord</i> said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.  They say themselves, Our bones are become dry, and our hope is perished, and we in them have been violently destroyed.  Therefore prophesy unto them, (and say), Behold, even I will open your sepulchres, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people, and will bring you into the land of Israel: and ye shall know how that I the Lord opened your sepulchres, and brought you, O my people, out of your sepulchres; and I will give my Spirit unto you, and ye shall live, and shall rest in your own land:  and ye shall know how that I the Lord have spoken and done these things, saith the Lord.” <a name="fr_7488"></a><a href="#fn_7488"><font size="1">7489</font></a>
