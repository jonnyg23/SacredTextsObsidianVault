 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.iii.xii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.iii.xii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XII.—A Proper Seeking After Divine Knowledge, Which Will Never Be Out of Place or Excessive, is Always Within the Rule of Faith.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.iii.xii-p2"></a>As for us, although we must still seek, and <i>that</i> always, yet where ought our search to be made?  Amongst the heretics, where all things are foreign <a name="fr_1988"></a><a href="#fn_1988"><font size="1">1989</font></a>
  and opposed to our own verity, and to whom we are forbidden to draw near? What slave looks for food from a stranger, not to say an enemy of his master? What soldier expects to get bounty and pay from kings who are unallied, I might almost say hostile—unless forsooth he be a deserter, and a runaway, and a rebel? Even that old woman <a name="fr_1989"></a><a href="#fn_1989"><font size="1">1990</font></a>
  searched for the piece of silver within her own house. It was also at his neighbours door that the persevering assailant kept knocking. Nor was it to a hostile judge, although a severe one, that the widow made her appeal. No man gets instruction <a name="fr_1990"></a><a href="#fn_1990"><font size="1">1991</font></a>
  from that which tends to destruction. <a name="fr_1991"></a><a href="#fn_1991"><font size="1">1992</font></a>
  No man receives illumination from a quarter where all is darkness. Let our “seeking,” therefore be in that which is our own, and from those who are our own: and concerning that which is our own,—that, and only that, <a name="fr_1992"></a><a href="#fn_1992"><font size="1">1993</font></a>
  which can become an object of inquiry without impairing the rule of faith.</p>
