 <p class="c19"><a name="vi.ii.ii-p2"></a>But if they acted as men who had any part in God, and thereby in reason also, they would first weigh well the importance of repentance, and would never apply it in such a way as to make it a ground for <i>convicting themselves of</i> perverse self-amendment. In short, they would regulate the limit of their repentance, because they would reach (a limit) in sinning too—by fearing God, I mean.  But where there is no fear, in like manner there is no amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the fruit for which God sowed it; that is, mans salvation. For God—after so many and so great sins of human temerity, begun by the first of the race, Adam, after the condemnation of man, together with the dowry of the world <a name="fr_8423"></a><a href="#fn_8423"><font size="1">8424</font></a>
  after his ejection from paradise and subjection to death—when He had hasted back to His own mercy, did from that time onward inaugurate repentance in His own self, by rescinding the sentence of His first wrath, engaging to grant pardon to His own work and image. <a name="fr_8424"></a><a href="#fn_8424"><font size="1">8425</font></a>
  And so He gathered together a people for Himself, and fostered them with many liberal distributions of His bounty, and, after so often finding them most ungrateful, ever exhorted them to repentance and sent out the voices of the universal company of the prophets to prophesy. By and by, promising freely the grace which in the last times He was intending to pour as a flood of light on the universal world <a name="fr_8425"></a><a href="#fn_8425"><font size="1">8426</font></a>
  through His <a name="page_658"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 658</font></a> <a name="vi.ii.ii-Page_658"></a>Spirit, He bade the baptism of repentance lead the way, with the view of first preparing, <a name="fr_8426"></a><a href="#fn_8426"><font size="1">8427</font></a>
  by means of the sign and seal of repentance, them whom He was calling, through grace, to (inherit) the promise surely made to Abraham. John holds not his peace, saying, “Enter upon repentance, for now shall salvation approach the nations” <a name="fr_8427"></a><a href="#fn_8427"><font size="1">8428</font></a>
 —the Lord, that is, bringing salvation according to Gods promise. To Him John, as His harbinger, directed the repentance (which he preached), whose province was the purging of mens minds, that whatever defilement inveterate error had imparted, whatever contamination in the heart of man ignorance had engendered, <i>that</i> repentance should sweep and scrape away, and cast out of doors, and thus prepare the home of the heart, by making it clean, for the Holy Spirit, who was about to supervene, that He might with pleasure introduce Himself there-into, together with His celestial blessings. Of these blessings the title is <i>briefly</i> one—the salvation of man—the abolition of former sins being the preliminary step. This <a name="fr_8428"></a><a href="#fn_8428"><font size="1">8429</font></a>
  is the (final) cause of repentance, this her work, in taking in hand the business of divine mercy. What is profitable to man does service to God.  The <i>rule</i> of repentance, however, which we learn when we know the Lord, retains a definite form,—<i>viz</i>., that no violent hands so to speak, be ever laid on <i>good</i> deeds or thoughts. <a name="fr_8429"></a><a href="#fn_8429"><font size="1">8430</font></a>
  For God, never giving His sanction to the reprobation of good <i>deeds</i>, inasmuch as they are His own (of which, being the author, He must necessarily be the defender too), is in like manner the acceptor of them, and if the acceptor, likewise the rewarder. Let, then, the ingratitude of men see to it, <a name="fr_8430"></a><a href="#fn_8430"><font size="1">8431</font></a>
  if it attaches repentance even to good works; let their gratitude see to it too, if the desire of earning it be the incentive to well-doing: earthly and mortal are they each. For how small is your gain if you do good to a grateful man! or your loss if to an ungrateful! A <i>good</i> deed has <span class="sc"><a name="vi.ii.ii-p10.1"></a>God</span> as its debtor, just as an <i>evil</i> has too; for a judge is rewarder of every cause. Well, since, God as Judge presides over the exacting and maintaining <a name="fr_8431"></a><a href="#fn_8431"><font size="1">8432</font></a>
  of justice, which to Him is most dear; and since it is with an eye to justice that He appoints all the sum of His discipline, is there room for doubting that, just as in all our acts universally, so also in the case of repentance, justice must be rendered to God?—which duty can indeed only be fulfilled on the condition that repentance be brought to bear <i>only</i> on <i>sins</i>. Further, no deed but an <i>evil</i> one deserves to be called <i>sin</i>, nor does any one err by well-doing. But if he does not err, why does he invade (the province of) repentance, the private ground of such as do err? Why does he impose on his goodness a duty proper to wickedness? Thus it comes to pass that, when a thing is called into play where it ought not, there, where it ought, it is neglected.</p>
