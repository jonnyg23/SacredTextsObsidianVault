 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.v.xxxiii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXIII.—Statement of the True Doctrine Concerning Matter. Its Relation to Gods Creation of the World.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.v.xxxiii-p2"></a>But although Hermogenes finds it amongst his own colourable pretences <a name="fr_6481"></a><a href="#fn_6481"><font size="1">6482</font></a>
  (for it was not in his power to discover it in the Scriptures of God), it is enough for us, both that it is certain that all things were made by God, and that there is no certainty whatever that they were made out of Matter. And even if Matter had <i>previously</i> existed, we must have believed that it had been really made by God, since we maintained (no less) when we held the rule of faith to be, <a name="fr_6482"></a><a href="#fn_6482"><font size="1">6483</font></a>
  that nothing except God was uncreated. <a name="fr_6483"></a><a href="#fn_6483"><font size="1">6484</font></a>
  Up to this point there is room for controversy, until Matter is brought to the test of the Scriptures, and fails to make good its case. <a name="fr_6484"></a><a href="#fn_6484"><font size="1">6485</font></a>
  The conclusion of the whole is this: I find that there was nothing made, except out of nothing; because that which I find was made, I know did not <i>once</i> exist. Whatever <a name="fr_6485"></a><a href="#fn_6485"><font size="1">6486</font></a>
  was made out of something, has its origin in something made: for instance, out of the ground was made the grass, and the fruit, and the cattle, and the form of man himself; so from the waters were produced the animals which swim and fly. The original fabrics <a name="fr_6486"></a><a href="#fn_6486"><font size="1">6487</font></a>
  out of which such creatures were produced I may call their <i>materials</i>, <a name="fr_6487"></a><a href="#fn_6487"><font size="1">6488</font></a>
  but then even these were created by God.</p>
