 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.vi.xvi-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.vi.xvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XVI.—Achamoth Purified from All Impurities of Her Passion by the Paraclete, Acting Through Soter, Who Out of the Above-Mentioned Impurities Arranges Matter, Separating Its Evil from the Better Qualities.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.vi.xvi-p2"></a>She, too, resorts to prayers, after the manner of her mother.  But Christ, Who now felt a dislike to quit the Pleroma, appoints the Paraclete as his deputy. To her, therefore, he despatches Soter, <a name="fr_6789"></a><a href="#fn_6789"><font size="1">6790</font></a>
  (who must be the same as Jesus, to whom the Father imparted the supreme power over the whole body of the Æons, by subjecting them all to him, so that “by him,” as the apostle says, “all things were created” <a name="fr_6790"></a><a href="#fn_6790"><font size="1">6791</font></a>
 ), with a retinue and cortege of contemporary angels, and (as one may suppose) with the dozen fasces. Hereupon Achamoth, being quite struck with the pomp of his approach, immediately covered herself with a veil, moved at first with a dutiful feeling of veneration and modesty; but afterwards she surveys him calmly, and his prolific equipage. <a name="fr_6791"></a><a href="#fn_6791"><font size="1">6792</font></a>
  With such energies as she had derived from the contemplation, she meets him with the salutation, <span class="Greek"><a name="v.vi.xvi-p5.1"></a>Κύριε, χαῖρε</span> (“Hail, Lord”)! Upon this, I suppose, he receives her, confirms and conforms her in knowledge, as well as cleanses <a name="fr_6792"></a><a href="#fn_6792"><font size="1">6793</font></a>
  her from all the outrages of Passion, without, however, utterly severing them, with an indiscriminateness like that which had happened in the casualties which befell her mother. For such vices as had become inveterate and confirmed by practice he throws together; and when he had consolidated them in one mass, he fixes them in a separate body, so as to compose the corporeal condition of Matter, extracting out of her inherent, incorporeal passion such an aptitude of nature <a name="fr_6793"></a><a href="#fn_6793"><font size="1">6794</font></a>
  as might qualify it to attain to a reciprocity of bodily substances, <a name="fr_6794"></a><a href="#fn_6794"><font size="1">6795</font></a>
  which should emulate one another, so that a twofold condition of the substances might be arranged; <i>one</i> full of evil through its faults, <i>the other</i> susceptible of passion from conversion.  This will prove to be Matter, which has set us in battle array against Hermogenes, and all others who presume to teach that God made all things out of Matter, not out of nothing.</p>
