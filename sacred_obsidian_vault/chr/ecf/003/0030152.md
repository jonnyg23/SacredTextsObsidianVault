 —The Charge of Worshipping a Cross. The Heathens Themselves Made Much of Crosses in Sacred Things; Nay, Their Very Idols Were Formed on a Crucial Frame.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="iv.viii.i.xii-p3"></a>As for him who affirms that we are “the <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.i.xii-Page_122"></a>priesthood of a cross,” <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">655</font></a>
  we shall claim him <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">656</font></a>
  as our co-religionist. <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">657</font></a>
  A cross is, in its material, a sign of wood; amongst yourselves also the object of worship is a wooden figure. Only, whilst with you the figure is a human one, with us the wood is its own figure.  Never mind <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">658</font></a>
  for the present what is the shape, provided the material is the same: the form, too, is of no importance, <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">659</font></a>
  if so be it be the actual body of a god.  If, however, there arises a question of difference on this point what, (let me ask,) is the difference between the Athenian Pallas, or the Pharian Ceres, and wood formed into a cross, <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">660</font></a>
  when each is represented by a rough stock, without form, and by the merest rudiment of a statue <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">661</font></a>
  of unformed wood? Every piece of timber <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">662</font></a>
  which is fixed in the ground in an erect position is a part of a cross, and indeed the greater portion of its mass.  But an entire cross is attributed to us, with its transverse beam, <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">663</font></a>
  of course, and its projecting seat. Now you have the less to excuse you, for you dedicate to religion only a mutilated imperfect piece of wood, while others consecrate to the sacred purpose a complete structure. The truth, however, after all is, that your religion is <i>all cross</i>, as I shall show. You are indeed unaware that your gods in their origin have proceeded from this hated cross. <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">664</font></a>
  Now, every image, whether carved out of wood or stone, or molten in metal, or produced out of any other richer material, must needs have had plastic hands engaged in its formation. Well, then, this modeller, <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">665</font></a>
  before he did anything else, <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">666</font></a>
  hit upon the form of a wooden cross, because even our own body assumes as its natural position the latent and concealed outline of a cross. Since the head rises upwards, and the back takes a straight direction, and the shoulders project laterally, if you simply place a man with his arms and hands outstretched, you will make the general outline of a cross. Starting, then, from this rudimental form and prop, <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">667</font></a>
  as it were, he applies a covering of clay, and so gradually completes the limbs, and forms the body, and covers the cross within with the shape which he meant to impress upon the clay; then from this design, with the help of compasses and leaden moulds, he has got all ready for his image which is to be brought out into marble, or clay, or whatever the material be of which he has determined to make his god. (This, then, is the process:) after the cross-shaped frame, the clay; after the clay, the god.  In a well-understood routine, the cross passes into a god through the clayey medium. The cross then you consecrate, and from it the consecrated (deity) begins to derive his origin. <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">668</font></a>
  By way of example, let us take the case of a tree which grows up into a system of branches and foliage, and is a reproduction of its own kind, whether it springs from the kernel of an olive, or the stone of a peach, or a grain of pepper which has been duly tempered under ground. Now, if you transplant it, or take a cutting off its branches for another plant, to what will you attribute what is produced by the propagation?  Will it not be to the grain, or the stone, or the kernel? Because, as the third stage is attributable to the second, and the second in like manner to the first, so the third will have to be referred to the first, through the second as the mean. We need not stay any longer in the discussion of this point, since by a natural law every kind of produce throughout nature refers back its growth to its original source; and just as the product is comprised in its primal cause, so does that cause agree in character with the thing produced. Since, then, in the production of your gods, you worship the cross which originates them, here will be the original kernel and grain, from which are propagated the wooden materials of your idolatrous images. Examples are not far to seek. Your victories you celebrate with religious ceremony <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">669</font></a>
  as deities; and they are the more august in proportion to the joy they bring you. The frames on which you hang up your trophies must be crosses: these are, as it were, the very core of your pageants. <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">670</font></a>
  Thus, in your victories, the religion of your camp makes even crosses objects of worship; your standards it adores, your standards are the sanction of its oaths; your standards it prefers before Jupiter himself. But all that parade <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">671</font></a>
  of images, and that display of pure gold, are (as so many) necklaces of the crosses. In like manner also, in the banners and ensigns, which your soldiers guard with no less sacred care, you have the streamers (and) vestments of your crosses. You are ashamed, I suppose, to worship unadorned and simple crosses.</p>
