 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.vii.xxv-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.vii.xxv-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXV.—Conclusion. This Treatise Forms a Preface to the Other Work, “On the Resurrection of the Flesh,” Proving the Reality of the Flesh Which Was Truly Born, and Died, and Rose Again.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.vii.xxv-p2"></a>But let this suffice on our present subject; for I think that by this time proof enough has been adduced of the flesh in Christ having both been born of the virgin, and being human in its nature. And this discussion alone might have been sufficient, without encountering the isolated opinions which have been raised from different quarters. We have, however, challenged these opinions to the test, both of the arguments which sustain them, and of the Scriptures which are appealed to, and this we have done <i>ex abundanti</i>; so that we have, by showing what the flesh of Christ was, and whence it was derived, also predetermined the question, against all objectors, of what that flesh was not. The resurrection, however, of our own flesh will have to be maintained in another little treatise, and so bring to a close this present one, which serves as a general preface, and which will pave the way <i>for the approaching subject</i> now that it is plain what kind of body that was which rose again in Christ.</p>
