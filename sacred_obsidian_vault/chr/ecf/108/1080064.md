 </p><p class="c10"><a name="ii.LV-p1"></a> <a name="ii.LV-p1.1"></a><span class="c20"><a name="ii.LV-p1.2"></a>Psalm LV. <a name="fr_1975"></a><a href="#fn_1975"><font size="1">1976</font></a>
 </span></p>  
 <p class="c26"><a name="ii.LV-p3"></a>1. Of this Psalm the title is: “At the end, in hymns, understanding to David himself.” What the “end” is, we will briefly call to your recollection, because ye have known it. “For the end of the Law is Christ, for righteousness unto every man believing.” <a name="fr_1976"></a><a href="#fn_1976"><font size="1">1977</font></a>
  Be the attention therefore directed unto the End, directed unto Christ. Wherefore is He called the end? Because whatever we do, to Him we refer it, and when to Him we shall have come home, more to ask we shall not have. For there is an end spoken of which doth consume, there is an end spoken of which doth make perfect. In one sense, for instance, we understand it, when we hear, there is ended the food which was in eating; and in another sense we understand it when we  hear, there is ended the vesture which was in weaving: in each case we hear, there is ended; but the food so that it no longer is, the vesture so that it is perfected. Our end therefore ought to be our perfection, our perfection Christ. For in Him we are made perfect, because of Himself the Head, the Members are we. And he hath been spoken of as “the End of the Law,” because without Him no one doth make perfect the Law. When therefore ye hear in the Psalms, “At the end,”—for  many Psalms are thus superscribed,—be not your thought upon consuming, but upon consummation.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p5"></a>2. “In hymns:” in praises. For whether we are troubled and are straitened, or whether we rejoice and exult, He is to be praised, who both in tribulations doth instruct, and in gladness doth comfort. For the praise of God from the heart and mouth of a Christian man ought not to depart; not that he may be praising in prosperity, and speaking evil in adversity; but after the manner that this Psalm doth prescribe, “I will speak good of the Lord in every time,  alway the praise of Him is in my mouth.” Thou dost rejoice; acknowledge a Father indulging: thou art troubled; acknowledge a Father chastening. Whether He indulge, or whether He chasten, He is instructing one for whom He is preparing an inheritance.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p6"></a>3. What then is, “Understanding to David himself”? David indeed was, as we know, a holy prophet, king of Israel, son of Jesse: <a name="fr_1977"></a><a href="#fn_1977"><font size="1">1978</font></a>
  but because out of his seed there came for our salvation after the flesh the Lord Jesus Christ, <a name="fr_1978"></a><a href="#fn_1978"><font size="1">1979</font></a>
  often under that name He is figured, and David instead of Christ is in a figure set down, because of the origin of the Flesh of the Same. For after some sort He is Son of David, after some sort He is the Lord of David; Son of David after the flesh, Lord of David after the divinity. For if by Him have been made all things, <a name="fr_1979"></a><a href="#fn_1979"><font size="1">1980</font></a>
  by Him also David himself hath been made, out of whose seed He came to men. Moreover, when the Lord had questioned the Jews, whose Son they affirmed Christ to be, they made answer, “Davids:” where the Lord chides the Jews, when they said that He was the Son of David. <a name="fr_1980"></a><a href="#fn_1980"><font size="1">1981</font></a>
  He saw that they had stayed at the flesh, and had lost sight of the divinity; and He reproveth them by propounding a question: “How then doth David himself in spirit call Him Lord, The Lord hath said unto my Lord.…If then He in spirit calleth Him Lord, how is He is Son?” <a name="fr_1981"></a><a href="#fn_1981"><font size="1">1982</font></a>
  A question He propounded; His being Son He denied not. Ye have heard “Lord;” say ye how He is his “Son:” ye have heard “Son;” say how He is “Lord.” This question the Catholic Faith solveth. How “Lord”? Because “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_210"></a>God, and the Word was God.” <a name="fr_1982"></a><a href="#fn_1982"><font size="1">1983</font></a>
  How “Son”? Because “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” <a name="fr_1983"></a><a href="#fn_1983"><font size="1">1984</font></a>
  Because then David in a figure is Christ, but Christ, as we have often reminded your Love, is both Head and Body; neither ought we to speak of ourselves as alien from Christ, of whom we are members, nor to count ourselves as if we were any other thing: because “The two shall be in one flesh.” <a name="fr_1984"></a><a href="#fn_1984"><font size="1">1985</font></a>
  “This is a great Sacrament,” saith the Apostle, “but I speak in regard of Christ and the Church.” <a name="fr_1985"></a><a href="#fn_1985"><font size="1">1986</font></a>
  Because then whole Christ is “Head and Body;” when we hear, “Understanding to David himself,” understand we ourselves also in David. Let the members of Christ understand, and Christ in His members understand, and the members of Christ in Christ understand: because Head and Members are one Christ. The Head was in heaven, and was saying, “Why dost thou persecute Me?” <a name="fr_1986"></a><a href="#fn_1986"><font size="1">1987</font></a>
  We with Him are in heaven through hope, Himself is with us on earth through love. Therefore “understanding to David himself.” Be we admonished when we hear, and let the Church understand: for there belongeth to us great diligence to understand in what evil we now are, and from what evil we desire to be delivered, remembering the Prayer of the Lord, where at the end we say, “Deliver us from evil.” <a name="fr_1987"></a><a href="#fn_1987"><font size="1">1988</font></a>
  Therefore amid many tribulations of this world, this Psalm complaineth somewhat of understanding. He lamenteth not with it, who hath not understanding. But furthermore, dearly beloved, we ought to remember, that after the image of God we have been made, and that not in any other part than in the understanding itself. For in many things by beasts we are surpassed: but when a man knoweth himself to have been made after the image of God, <a name="fr_1988"></a><a href="#fn_1988"><font size="1">1989</font></a>
  therein something in himself he acknowledgeth to be more than hath been given to dumb animals. But on consideration of all those things which a man hath, he findeth himself in this thing peculiarly distinguished from a dumb animal, in that he hath himself an understanding. Whence certain men despising in themselves that peculiar and especial thing which from their Maker they had received, the Maker Himself reproveth, saying, “Do not become like horse and mule, in which  there is no understanding.” <a name="fr_1989"></a><a href="#fn_1989"><font size="1">1990</font></a>
 …</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p20"></a>4. “Hear Thou, O God, my entreaty, and despise not my prayer: give heed unto me, and hearken unto me” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001">Psa. 55.1</a><a name="ii.LV-p20.1"></a>). Of one earnest, anxious, of one set in tribulation, are these words. He is praying, suffering many things, from evil yearning to be delivered: it remaineth that we hear in what evil he is, and when he beginneth to speak, let us acknowledge there ourselves to be; in order that the tribulation being shared, we  may conjoin prayer. “I have been made sad in my exercise, and have been troubled” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002">Psa. 55.2</a><a name="ii.LV-p20.2"></a>). Where made sad, where troubled? “In my exercise,” he saith. Of evil men, whom he suffereth, he hath made mention, and the same suffering of evil men he hath called his “exercise.” Think ye not that without profit there are evil men in this world, and that no good God maketh of them. Every evil man either on this account liveth that he  may be corrected, or on this account liveth that through him a good man may be exercised. O that therefore they that do now exercise us would be converted, and together with us be exercised! Nevertheless, so long as they are such as to exercise, let us not hate them: because in that wherein any one of them is evil, whether unto the end he is to persevere, we know not; and ofttimes when to thyself thou seemest to have been hating an enemy, thou hast been hating a brother, and knowest  not. The devil and his angels in the holy Scriptures have been manifested to us, that for fire everlasting they have been destined. Of them only must amendment be despaired of.…Therefore since this rule of Love for thee is fixed, that imitating the Father thou shouldest love an enemy: for, He saith, “love your enemies:” <a name="fr_1990"></a><a href="#fn_1990"><font size="1">1991</font></a>
  in this precept how wouldest thou be exercised, if thou hadst no enemy to suffer? Thou seest then that he profiteth thee somewhat: and let God sparing evil men profit thee, so that thou show mercy: because perchance thou too, if thou art a good man, out of an evil man hast been made a good man: and if God spared not evil men, not even thou wouldest be found to return thanks. May He therefore spare others, that hath spared thee also. For it were not right, when  thou hadst passed through, to close up the way of godliness.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p22"></a>5. Whence then doth this man pray, set among evil men, with whose enmities he was being exercised? Why saith he, “I have been made sad in my exercise, and have been troubled”? While he is extending his love so as to love enemies, he hath been affected with disgust, being bayed at all around by the enmities of many men, by the frenzy of many and under a sort of human infirmity he hath sunk. He hath seen himself now begin to be pierced through with an evil  suggestion of the devil, to bring on hatred against his enemies: wrestling against hatred in order to perfect love herself, in the very fight, and in the wrestling, he hath been troubled. For there is his voice in another Psalm, “Mine eye hath been troubled, because of anger.” And what followeth there? “I have waxen old among all mine enemies.” <a name="fr_1991"></a><a href="#fn_1991"><font size="1">1992</font></a>
  As if in storm and waves he were beginning to sink, like <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_211"></a>Peter. <a name="fr_1992"></a><a href="#fn_1992"><font size="1">1993</font></a>
  For he doth trample the waves of this world, that loveth enemies. Christ on the sea was walking fearless, from whose heart there could not by any means be taken away the love of an enemy, who hanging on the Cross did say, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” <a name="fr_1993"></a><a href="#fn_1993"><font size="1">1994</font></a>
  Peter too would walk. He as Head, Peter as Body: because, “Upon this rock,” He saith, “I will build My Church.” <a name="fr_1994"></a><a href="#fn_1994"><font size="1">1995</font></a>
  He was bidden to walk, and he was walking by the Grace of Him bidding, not by his own strength. But when he saw the wind mighty, he feared; and then he began to sink, being troubled in his exercise. By what mighty wind? “By the voice of the enemy, and by the tribulation of the sinner” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003">Psa. 55.3</a><a name="ii.LV-p26.2"></a>). Therefore, in the same manner as he cried out on the waves, “Lord, I perish, save me,”   <a name="fr_1995"></a><a href="#fn_1995"><font size="1">1996</font></a>
  a similar voice from this man hath preceded, “Hearken unto me.” Wherefore? For what sufferest thou? Of what dost thou groan? “I have been made sad in my exercise.” To be exercised indeed among evil men Thou hast set me, but too much they have risen up, beyond my powers: calm Thou one troubled, stretch forth a hand to one sinking. “For they have brought down upon me iniquity, and in anger they were shadowing me.” Ye have heard of waves and winds:  one as it were humbled they were insulting, and he was praying: on every side against him with the roar of insult they were raging, but he within was calling upon Him whom they did not see.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p28"></a>6. But this man being troubled and made sad was praying, his eye being disturbed as it were on account of anger. <a name="fr_1996"></a><a href="#fn_1996"><font size="1">1997</font></a>
  But the anger of a brother if it shall have been inveterate is then hatred. Anger doth trouble the eye, hatred doth quench it: anger is a straw, hatred is a beam. Sometimes thou hatest and chidest an angry man: in thee is hatred, in him whom thou chidest anger: with reason to thee is said, “Cast out first the beam from thine own eye, and so thou shalt see to cast out the straw from thy brothers eye.” <a name="fr_1997"></a><a href="#fn_1997"><font size="1">1998</font></a>
  For that ye may know how much difference there is between anger and hatred: day by day men are angry with their sons, show me them that hate their <a name="fr_1998"></a><a href="#fn_1998"><font size="1">1999</font></a>
  sons! This man being troubled was praying even when made sad, wrestling against all revilings of all revilers; not in order that he might conquer any one of them by giving back reviling, but that he might not hate any one of them. Hence he prayeth, hence asketh: “From the voice of the enemy and from the tribulation of the sinner.” “My heart hath been troubled in me” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#004">Psa. 55.4</a><a name="ii.LV-p31.2"></a>). This is the same as elsewhere  hath been said, “Mine eye because of anger hath been troubled.” <a name="fr_1999"></a><a href="#fn_1999"><font size="1">2000</font></a>
  And if eye hath been troubled, what followeth? “And fear of death hath fallen upon me.” Our life is love: if life is love, death is hatred. When a man hath begun to fear lest he should hate him that he was loving, it is death he is fearing; and a sharper death, and a more inward death, whereby soul is killed, not body. Thou didst mind a man raging against thee; what was he to do, against whom thine own Lord had given thee security, saying, “Fear not them that  kill the body”? <a name="fr_2000"></a><a href="#fn_2000"><font size="1">2001</font></a>
  He by raging killeth body, thou by keeping hatred hast killed soul; and he the body of another, thou thine own soul. “Fear,” therefore, “of death hath fallen upon me.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p34"></a>7. “Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and darkness hath covered me” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005">Psa. 55.5</a><a name="ii.LV-p34.1"></a>). “And I have said,” “He that hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.” <a name="fr_2001"></a><a href="#fn_2001"><font size="1">2002</font></a>
  If love is light, hatred is darkness. And what saith to himself one set in that weakness and troubled in that exercise? “Who shall give me wings as to a dove, and I shall fly and shall rest?” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006">Psa. 55.6</a><a name="ii.LV-p35.2"></a>). Either for death he was wishing, or for solitude he was longing. So long, he saith, as this is the work with me, as this command is given me, that I should love enemies, the revilings of these men, increasing and shadowing me, do derange mine eye, perturb my sight, penetrate my heart, slay my soul. I could wish to depart, but <a name="fr_2002"></a><a href="#fn_2002"><font size="1">2003</font></a>
  weak I am, lest by abiding I should add sins to sins: or at least may I be separated for a little space from mankind, lest my wound suffer from frequent blows, in order that when it hath been made whole it may be brought back to the exercise. This is what takes place, brethren, and there ariseth ofttimes in the mind of the servant of God a longing for solitude, for no other reason than because of the multitude of tribulations and scandals, and he saith, “Who shall give  me wings?” Doth he find himself without wings, or rather with bound wings? If they are wanting, be they given; if bound, be they loosed; because even he that looseth a birds wings, either giveth, or giveth back to it its wings. For it had not as though its own them, wherewith it could not fly. Bound wings make a burden. “Who,” he saith, “shall give me wings as to a dove, and I shall fly and shall rest?” Shall rest, where? I have said there are two senses here:  either, as saith the Apostle, “To be dissolved and to be with Christ, for it is by far the best thing.” <a name="fr_2003"></a><a href="#fn_2003"><font size="1">2004</font></a>
 …Even he that amended cannot be, is thine, either by the fellowship of the human race, or ofttimes by Church Communion; he is within, what wilt thou do? whither wilt go? whither separate thyself, in order that these things thou mayest not suffer? But go to him, <a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_212"></a>speak, exhort, coax, threaten, reprove. I have done all things, whatever powers I had I have expended and have drained, nothing I see have I prevailed; all my labour hath been spent out,  sorrow hath remained. How then shall my heart rest from such men, except I say, “Who shall give me wings?” “As to a dove,” however, not as to a raven. A dove seeketh a flying away from troubles, but she loseth not love. For a dove as a type of love is set forth, and in her the plaint is loved. Nothing is so fond of plaints as a dove: day and night she complaineth, as though she were set here where she ought to complain. What then saith this lover? Revilings of men to  bear I am unable, they roar, with frenzy are carried away, are inflamed with indignation, in anger they shadow <a name="fr_2004"></a><a href="#fn_2004"><font size="1">2005</font></a>
  me; to do good to them I am unable; O that I might rest somewhere, being separated from them in body, not in love; lest in me there should be troubled love itself: with my words and my speech no good can I do them, by praying for them perchance I shall do good. These words men say, but ofttimes they are so bound, that to fly they are not able. For perchance they are not bound with any birdlime, but are bound by duty. But if they are bound with care and duty, and to  leave it are unable, let them say, “I was wishing to be dissolved and to be with Christ, for it is by far the best thing: to abide in the flesh is necessary because of you.” <a name="fr_2005"></a><a href="#fn_2005"><font size="1">2006</font></a>
  A dove bound back by affection, not by cupidity, was not able to fly away because of duty to be fulfilled, not because of little merit. Nevertheless a longing in heart must needs be; nor doth any man suffer this longing, but he that hath begun to walk in that narrow way: <a name="fr_2006"></a><a href="#fn_2006"><font size="1">2007</font></a>
  in order that he may know that there are not wanting to the Church persecutions, even in this time, when a calm is seen in the Church, at least with respect to those persecutions which our Martyrs have suffered. But there are not wanting persecutions, because a true saying is this, “All that will godly to live in Christ, shall suffer persecution.” <a name="fr_2007"></a><a href="#fn_2007"><font size="1">2008</font></a>
 …</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p42"></a>8. “Behold I have gone afar fleeing, and have abode in the desert” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#007">Psa. 55.7</a><a name="ii.LV-p42.1"></a>). In what desert? Wherever thou shalt be, there will gather them together other men, the desert with thee they will seek, will attach themselves to thy life, thou canst not thrust back the society of brethren: there are mingled with thee also evil men; still exercise is thy due portion, “Behold I have gone afar, and have abode in the  desert.” In what desert? It is perchance in the conscience, whither no man entereth, where no one is with thee, where thou art and God. For if in the desert, in any place, what wilt thou do with men gathering themselves together? For thou wilt not be able to be separated from mankind, so long as among men thou livest. <a name="fr_2008"></a><a href="#fn_2008"><font size="1">2009</font></a>
 …</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p44"></a>9. “I was looking for him that should save me from weakness of mind and tempest” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#008">Psa. 55.8</a><a name="ii.LV-p44.1"></a>). Sea there is, tempest there is: nothing for thee remaineth but to cry out, “Lord, I perish.” <a name="fr_2009"></a><a href="#fn_2009"><font size="1">2010</font></a>
  Let Him stretch forth hand, who doth the waves tread fearlessly, let Him relieve thy dread, let Him confirm in Himself thy security, let Him speak to thee within, and say to thee, “Give heed to Me, what I have borne:” an evil brother perchance thou art suffering, or an enemy without art suffering; which of these have I not suffered? There roared without Jews, within a disciple was betraying. There rageth therefore tempest, but He doth save men from weakness of  mind, and tempest. Perchance thy ship is being troubled, because He in thee is sleeping. The sea was raging, the bark wherein the disciples were sailing was being tossed; but Christ was sleeping: at length it was seen by them that among them was sleeping the Ruler <a name="fr_2010"></a><a href="#fn_2010"><font size="1">2011</font></a>
  and Creator of winds; they drew near and awoke Christ; <a name="fr_2011"></a><a href="#fn_2011"><font size="1">2012</font></a>
  He commanded <a name="fr_2012"></a><a href="#fn_2012"><font size="1">2013</font></a>
  the winds, and there was a great calm. With reason then perchance thy heart is troubled, because thou hast forgotten Him on whom thou hast believed: beyond endurance thou art suffering, because it hath not come into thy mind what for thee Christ hath borne. If unto thy mind cometh not Christ, He sleepeth: awake Christ, recall faith. For then in thee Christ is sleeping, if thou hast forgotten the sufferings of Christ: then in thee Christ is watching, if thou hast  remembered the sufferings of Christ. But when with full heart thou shalt have considered what He hath suffered, wilt not thou too with equanimity endure? and perchance rejoicing, because thou hast been found in some likeness of the sufferings of thy King. When therefore on these things thinking thou hast begun to be comforted and to rejoice, He hath arisen, He hath commanded the winds; therefore there is a great calm. “I was looking for Him that should save me from weakness of mind and  tempest.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p49"></a>10. “Sink, O Lord, and divide the tongues of them” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009">Psa. 55.9</a><a name="ii.LV-p49.1"></a>). He is referring to men troubling him and shadowing him, and he hath wished this thing not of anger, brethren. They that have wickedly lifted up themselves, for them it is expedient that they be sunk. They that have wickedly conspired, it is expedient for them that their tongues should be divided: to good let them consent, and let their tongues agree together. But if to one purpose <a name="fr_2013"></a><a href="#fn_2013"><font size="1">2014</font></a>
  there were a whispering against me, <a name="fr_2014"></a><a href="#fn_2014"><font size="1">2015</font></a>
  he saith, all mine ene<a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_213"></a>mies, let them lose their “one purpose” in evil, divided be the tongues of them, let them not with themselves agree together. “Sink, O Lord, and divide the tongues of them.” Wherefore “sink”? Because themselves they have lifted up. Wherefore “divide”? Because for an evil thing they have united. Recollect that tower of proud men made after the deluge: what said the proud men? Lest we perish in a  deluge, let us make a lofty tower. <a name="fr_2015"></a><a href="#fn_2015"><font size="1">2016</font></a>
  In pride they were thinking themselves to be fortified, they builded up a lofty tower, and the Lord divided the tongues of them. Then they began not to understand one another; hence arose the beginning of many tongues. For before, one tongue there was: but one tongue for men agreeing was good, one tongue for humble men was good: but when that gathering together did into a union of pride fall headlong, God spared them; even though He divided the tongues, lest by  understanding one another they should make a destructive unity. Through proud men, divided were the tongues; through humble Apostles, united were the tongues. Spirit of pride dispersed tongues, Spirit Holy united tongues. For when the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples, with the tongues of all men they spake, <a name="fr_2016"></a><a href="#fn_2016"><font size="1">2017</font></a>
  by all men they were understood: tongues dispersed, into one were united. Therefore if still they rage and are Gentiles, it is expedient for them divided to have their tongues. They would have one tongue; let them come to the Church; because even among the diversity of tongues of flesh, one is the tongue in faith of heart.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p54"></a>11. “For I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.” With reason this man was seeking the desert, for he saw iniquity and contradiction in the city. There is a certain city turbulent: the same it was that was building a tower, the same was confounded and called Babylon, the same through innumerable nations dispersed: <a name="fr_2017"></a><a href="#fn_2017"><font size="1">2018</font></a>
  thence is gathered the Church into the desert of a good conscience. For he saw contradiction in the city. “Christ cometh.”—“What Christ?” thou contradictest.—“Son of God.”—“And hath God a Son?” thou contradictest.—“He was born of a virgin, suffered, rose again.”—“And whence is it possible for this to be done?” thou contradictest.—Give heed at least to the glory of the Cross itself. Now on the brow of kings that Cross hath been fixed,  over which enemies insulted. The effect hath proved the virtue. <a name="fr_2018"></a><a href="#fn_2018"><font size="1">2019</font></a>
  It hath subdued the world, not with steel, but with wood. The wood of the Cross deserving of insults hath seemed to enemies, and before the wood itself standing they were wagging the head, and saying, “If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross.” <a name="fr_2019"></a><a href="#fn_2019"><font size="1">2020</font></a>
  He was stretching forth His hands to a people unbelieving and contradicting. For if just he is that of faith liveth, <a name="fr_2020"></a><a href="#fn_2020"><font size="1">2021</font></a>
  unjust he is that hath not faith. By that which here he saith “iniquity,” I understand unbelief. The Lord therefore was seeing in the city iniquity and contradiction, and was stretching forth His hands to a people unbelieving and contradicting: and nevertheless waiting for these same, He was saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” <a name="fr_2021"></a><a href="#fn_2021"><font size="1">2022</font></a>
  Even now indeed there rage the remnant of that city, even now they contradict. From the brows of all men now He is stretching forth hands to the remnant unbelieving and contradicting.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p60"></a>12. “Day and night there will compass it upon the walls thereof iniquity, and labour.” <a name="fr_2022"></a><a href="#fn_2022"><font size="1">2023</font></a>
  “Upon the walls thereof;” upon the fortifications thereof, holding as it were the heads thereof, the noble men thereof. If that noble man were a Christian, not one would remain a pagan! Oft-times men say, “no one would remain a pagan, if he were a Christian.” Ofttimes men say, “If he too were made a Christian, who would remain a pagan?” Because therefore not yet they are made Christians, as if walls they are of that city unbelieving and contradicting.  How long shall these walls stand? Not always shall they stand. The Ark is going around the walls of Jericho: there shall come a time at the seventh going round of the Ark, when all the walls of the city unbelieving and contradicting shall fall. <a name="fr_2023"></a><a href="#fn_2023"><font size="1">2024</font></a>
  Until it come to pass, this man is being troubled in his exercise; and enduring the remains of men contradicting, he would choose wings for flying away, would choose the rest of the desert. Yea let him continue amid men contradicting, let him endure menaces, drink revilings, and look for Him that will save him from weakness of mind and tempest: let him look upon the Head, the pattern for his life, <a name="fr_2024"></a><a href="#fn_2024"><font size="1">2025</font></a>
  let him be made calm in hope, even if he is troubled in fact. “Day and night there will compass it upon the walls thereof iniquity; and labour in the midst thereof and injustice.” And for this reason labour is there, because iniquity is there: because injustice is there, therefore also labour is there. But let them hear him stretching forth hands. “Come unto Me, all ye that labour.” <a name="fr_2025"></a><a href="#fn_2025"><font size="1">2026</font></a>
  Ye cry, ye contradict, ye revile: He on the contrary, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour,” in your pride, and ye shall rest in My humility. “Learn of Me,” He saith, “for meek I am and humble in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.” <a name="fr_2026"></a><a href="#fn_2026"><font size="1">2027</font></a>
  For whence do they labour, but because they are not meek and humble in <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_214"></a>heart? God humble was made, let man blush to be proud.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p66"></a>13. “There hath not failed from the streets thereof usury and deceit” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#011">Psa. 55.11</a><a name="ii.LV-p66.1"></a>). Usury and deceit are not hidden at least, because they are evil things, but in public they rage. For he that in his house doth any evil thing, however for his evil thing doth blush: “In the streets thereof usury and deceit.” Money-lending <a name="fr_2027"></a><a href="#fn_2027"><font size="1">2028</font></a>
  even hath a profession, Money-lending also is called a science; a corporation is spoken of, a corporation as if necessary to the state, and of its profession it payeth revenue; so entirely indeed in the streets is that which should have been hidden. There is also another usury worse, when thou forgivest not that which to thee is owed; and the eye is disturbed in that verse of the prayer, “Forgive us our debts—as we too forgive our debtors.”   <a name="fr_2028"></a><a href="#fn_2028"><font size="1">2029</font></a>
  For what there wilt thou do, when thou art going to pray, and coming to that same verse? An insulting word thou hast heard: thou wouldest exact the punishment of condemnation. Do but consent to exact just so much as thou hast given, thou usurer of injuries! With the fist thou hast been smitten, slaying thou seekest. Evil usury! How wilt thou go to prayer? If thou shalt have left praying, which way wilt thou come round unto the Lord? Behold thou wilt say:  “Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, as in heaven so on earth.” Thou wilt say, “Our daily bread give us to-day.” Thou wilt come to, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.” <a name="fr_2029"></a><a href="#fn_2029"><font size="1">2030</font></a>
  Even in that evil city let there abound these usuries; let them not enter the walls where the breast is smitten! What wilt thou do? because there thou and that verse are <a name="fr_2030"></a><a href="#fn_2030"><font size="1">2031</font></a>
  in the midst? Petitions for thee hath a heavenly Lawyer composed. <a name="fr_2031"></a><a href="#fn_2031"><font size="1">2032</font></a>
  He that knew what used there to be done, said to thee, “Otherwise thou shalt not obtain.” “Verily, verily, I say unto you, that if ye shall have forgiven men sins, they shall be forgiven you; but if ye shall not have forgiven sins unto men, neither will your Father forgive you.” <a name="fr_2032"></a><a href="#fn_2032"><font size="1">2033</font></a>
  Who saith this? He that knoweth what there is being done, in the place whereat thou art standing to make request. See how Himself hath willed to be thy Advocate; Himself thy Counsellor, <a name="fr_2033"></a><a href="#fn_2033"><font size="1">2034</font></a>
  Himself the Assessor of the Father, Himself thy Judge hath said, “Otherwise thou shalt not receive.” What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not receive, unless thou shalt speak; wilt not receive if falsely thou shalt speak. Therefore either thou must do and speak, or else what thou askest thou wilt not earn; because they that this do not do, are in the midst of those evil usuries. Be they engaged therein, that yet do idols either adore or desire: do not thou, O people of  God, do not thou, O people of Christ, do not thou the Body of Him the Head! Give heed to the bond <a name="fr_2034"></a><a href="#fn_2034"><font size="1">2035</font></a>
  of thy peace, give heed to the promise of thy life. For what doth it profit thee, that thou exactest for injuries which thou hast endured? doth vengeance refresh thee? Therefore, over the evil of another shalt thou rejoice? Thou hast suffered evil; pardon thou; be not ye two. <a name="fr_2035"></a><a href="#fn_2035"><font size="1">2036</font></a>

 <p><a name="ii.LV-p76"></a>14. “For if an enemy had upbraided me” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012">Psa. 55.12</a><a name="ii.LV-p76.1"></a>). And indeed above he was “troubled in his exercise” by the voice of the enemy and by the tribulation of the sinner, perhaps being placed in that city, that proud city that was building a tower, which was “sunk,” <a name="fr_2036"></a><a href="#fn_2036"><font size="1">2037</font></a>
  that divided might be the tongues: give heed to his inward groaning because of perils from false brethren. “For if an enemy had upbraided me, I would have undergone it assuredly, and if he that did hate me had over me spoken great words,” that is, through pride had on me trampled, did magnify himself above me, did threaten me all in his power: “I would hide myself assuredly from him.” From him that is abroad, thou wouldest hide thyself where? Amid those that  are within. But now see whether anything else remaineth, but that thou seek solitude. “But thou,” he saith, “man of one mind, my guide and my friend” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013">Psa. 55.13</a><a name="ii.LV-p77.2"></a>). Perchance sometimes good counsel thou hast given, perchance sometimes thou hast gone before me, and some wholesome advice thou hast given me: in the Church of God together we have been. “But thou,…that together with me didst take sweet morsels” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#014">Psa. 55.14</a><a name="ii.LV-p77.3"></a>). What are the sweet morsels? Not all they that are present know: but let them not be soured that do know, in order that they may be able to say to them that as yet know not: “Taste ye and see, how sweet is the Lord.” <a name="fr_2037"></a><a href="#fn_2037"><font size="1">2038</font></a>
  “In the House of God we have walked with consent.” Whence then dissension? Thou that wast within, hast become one without. He hath walked with me in the House of God with consent: another house hath he set up against the House of God. Wherefore hath that been forsaken, wherein we have walked with consent? <a name="fr_2038"></a><a href="#fn_2038"><font size="1">2039</font></a>
  wherefore hath that been deserted, wherein together we did take sweet morsels?</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p80"></a>15. “Let there come death upon them, and let them go down unto Hell living” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015">Psa. 55.15</a><a name="ii.LV-p80.1"></a>). How hath he cited and hath made us call to mind that first beginning of schism, when in that first people of the Jews certain proud men <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_215"></a>separated themselves, and would without have sacrificed? A new death upon them came: the earth opened herself, and swallowed them up alive. <a name="fr_2039"></a><a href="#fn_2039"><font size="1">2040</font></a>
  “Let there come,” he saith, “death upon them, and let them go down into Hell living.” What is “living”? knowing that they are perishing, and yet perishing. Hear of living men perishing and being swallowed up in a gulf of the earth, that is, being swallowed up in the voraciousness of earthly desires. <a name="fr_2040"></a><a href="#fn_2040"><font size="1">2041</font></a>
  Thou sayest to a man, What aileth thee, brother? Brethren we are, one God we invoke, in one Christ we believe, one Gospel we hear, one Psalm we sing, one Amen we respond, one Hallelujah we sound, one Easter we celebrate: why art thou without and I am within? Ofttimes one straitened, and perceiving how true are the charges which are made, saith, May God requite our ancestors! Therefore alive he perisheth. In the next place thou continuest and thus givest warning.  At least let the evil of separation stand alone, why dost thou adjoin thereto that of rebaptism? Acknowledge in me what thou hast; and if thou hatest me, spare thou Christ in me. And this evil thing doth frequently and very greatly displease them.…Because they themselves have the Scriptures in their hands, and know well by daily reading how the Church Catholic through the whole world is so spread, that in a word all contradiction is void; and that there cannot be found any support for  their schism they know well: therefore unto the lower places living they go down, because the evil which they do, they know evil to be. But the former a fire of divine indignation consumed. For being inflamed with desire of strife, from their evil leaders they would not depart. There came upon fire a fire, upon the heat of dissension the heat of consuming. “For naughtiness is in their lodgings, in the midst of them.” “In their lodgings,” <a name="fr_2041"></a><a href="#fn_2041"><font size="1">2042</font></a>
  wherein they tarry and pass away. For here they are not alway to be: and nevertheless in defence of a temporal animosity they are fighting so fiercely. “In their lodgings is iniquity; in the midst of them is iniquity:” no part of them is so near the middle of them as their heart.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p84"></a>16. “Therefore to the Lord I have cried out” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016">Psa. 55.16</a><a name="ii.LV-p84.1"></a>). The Body of Christ and the oneness of Christ in anguish, in weariness, in uneasiness, in the tribulation of its exercise, that One Man, Oneness in One Body set, when He was wearying His soul in crying out from the ends of the earth; saith, “From the ends of the earth to Thee I have cried out, when My heart was being vexed.” <a name="fr_2042"></a><a href="#fn_2042"><font size="1">2043</font></a>
  Himself one, but a oneness <a name="fr_2043"></a><a href="#fn_2043"><font size="1">2044</font></a>
  that One! and Himself one, not in one place one, but from the ends of the earth is crying as one. How from the ends of the earth should there cry one, except there were one? “I to the Lord have cried out.” Rightly do thou cry out to the Lord, cry not to Donatus: lest for thee he be instead of the Lord a lord, that under the Lord would not be a fellow-servant.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p87"></a>17. “In evening, in morning, at noon-day I will recount and will tell forth, and He shall hearken to my voice” <a name="fr_2044"></a><a href="#fn_2044"><font size="1">2045</font></a>
  (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#018">Psa. 55.18</a><a name="ii.LV-p88.2"></a>). Do thou proclaim glad tidings, keep not secret that which thou hast received, “in evening” of things gone by, “in morning” of things to be, at “noonday” of things ever to be. Therefore, to that which he saith “in evening” belongeth that which he recounteth: to that which he saith, “in morning,” belongeth that which he telleth forth: to that which he saith “at noon-day,” belongeth that wherein his voice is hearkened to. For the  end is at noon-day; that is to say, whence there is no going down unto setting. For at noon-day there is light full high, the splendour of wisdom, the fervour of love. “In evening and in morning and at noon-day.” “In evening,” the Lord on the Cross; “in morning,” in Resurrection; “at noon-day,” in Ascension. I will recount in evening the patience of Him dying, I will tell forth in morning the life of Him rising, I will pray that He hearken at noon-day sitting at the  right hand of the Father. He shall hearken to my voice, That intercedeth for us. <a name="fr_2045"></a><a href="#fn_2045"><font size="1">2046</font></a>
  How great is the security of this man. How great the consolation, how great the refuge “from weakness of mind and tempest,” against evil men, against ungodly men both without and within, and in the case of those that are without though they had been within.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p90"></a>18. Therefore, my Brethren, those that in the very congregation of these walls ye see to be rebellious men, proud, seeking their own, lifted up; not having a zeal for God that is chaste, sound, quiet, but ascribing to themselves much; ready for dissension, but not finding opportunity; are the very chaff of the Lords floor. <a name="fr_2046"></a><a href="#fn_2046"><font size="1">2047</font></a>
  From hence these few men the wind of pride hath dislodged: the whole floor will not fly, save when He at the last shall winnow. But what shall we do, save with this man sing, with this man pray, with this man mourn and say securely, “He shall redeem in peace my soul” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#018">Psa. 55.18</a><a name="ii.LV-p91.2"></a>). Against them that love not peace: “in peace He shall redeem my soul.” “Because with those that hated peace I was  peace-making.”  <a name="fr_2047"></a><a href="#fn_2047"><font size="1">2048</font></a>
  “He shall redeem in peace my soul, from those that draw near to me.” For from those that are afar from me, it is an easy case: not so soon doth he deceive me that saith, Come, pray to an idol: he is very far from <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_216"></a>me. Art thou a Christian? A Christian, he saith. Out of a neighbouring place he is my adversary, he is at hand. “He shall redeem in peace my soul, from those that draw near to me: for in many things they were with  me.” Wherefore have I said, “draw near to me”? Because “in many things they were with me.” In this verse two propositions occur. “In many things they were with me.” Baptism we had both of us, in that they were with me: the Gospel we both read, they were in that with me: the festivals of martyrs we celebrated, they were there with me: Easters solemnity we attended, they were there with me. But not entirely with me: in schism not with me, in heresy not with  me. In many things with me, in few things not with me. But in these few things wherein not with me, there is no profit to them of the many things wherein they were with me. For see, brethren, how many things hath recounted the Apostle Paul: one thing, he hath said, if it shall have been wanting, in vain are those things. “If with the tongues of men and of angels I shall speak,” he saith, “if I have all prophecy, and all faith, and all knowledge; if mountains I shall remove, if I  shall bestow all my goods upon the poor, if I shall deliver my body even so that it be burned.” <a name="fr_2048"></a><a href="#fn_2048"><font size="1">2049</font></a>
  How many things he hath enumerated! To all these many things let there be wanting one thing, charity; the former in number are more, the latter in weight is greater. Therefore in all Sacraments they are with me, in one charity not with me: “In many things they were with me.” Again, by a different expression: “For in many things they were with me.” They that themselves have separated from me, with me they were, not in few things, but in many things. For  throughout the whole world few are the grains, many are the chaffs. Therefore he saith what? In chaff with me they were, in wheat with me they were not. And the chaff is nearly related to the wheat, from one seed it goeth forth, in one field is rooted, with one rain is nourished, the same reaper it suffereth, the same threshing sustaineth, the same winnowing awaiteth, <i> but</i> not into one barn entereth.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p94"></a>19. “God will hear me, and He shall humble them That is before ages” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019">Psa. 55.19</a><a name="ii.LV-p94.1"></a>). For they rely on some leader or other of theirs that hath begun but yesterday. “He shall humble them That is before ages.” For even if with reference to time Christ is of Mary the Virgin, nevertheless before ages: “In the beginning He is the Word and the Word with God, and the Word God.” <a name="fr_2049"></a><a href="#fn_2049"><font size="1">2050</font></a>
  “He shall humble them That is before ages. For to them is no changing:” of them I “speak to whom is no changing.” He knew of some to persevere, and in the perseverance of their own wickedness to die. For we see them, and to them is no changing: they that die in that same perverseness, in that same schism, to them is no changing. God shall humble them, shall humble them in damnation, because they are exalted in dissension. To them is no changing, because  they are not changed for the better, but for the worse: neither while they are here, nor in the resurrection. For all we shall rise again, but <a name="fr_2050"></a><a href="#fn_2050"><font size="1">2051</font></a>
  not all shall be changed. Wherefore? Because “To them is no changing: and they have not feared God.”…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p97"></a>20. “He stretcheth forth His hand in requiting” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020">Psa. 55.20</a><a name="ii.LV-p97.1"></a>). “They have polluted His Testament.” Read the testament which they have polluted: “In thy seed shall be blessed all nations.” <a name="fr_2051"></a><a href="#fn_2051"><font size="1">2052</font></a>
  Thou against these words of the Testator sayest what? The Africa of holy Donatus hath alone deserved this grace, in him hath remained the Church of Christ. Say at least the Church of Donatus. Wherefore addest thou, of Christ? Of whom it is said, “In thy seed shall be blessed all nations.” After Donatus wilt thou go? Set aside Christ, and then secede. See therefore what followeth: “They have polluted His Testament.” What Testament? To Abraham have  been spoken the promises, and to his seed. The Apostle saith, “Nevertheless, a mans testament confirmed no one maketh void, or super-addeth to: to Abraham have been spoken the promises, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as if in many; but as if in one, And to thy Seed, which is Christ.” <a name="fr_2052"></a><a href="#fn_2052"><font size="1">2053</font></a>
  In this Christ, therefore, what Testament hath been promised? “In thy seed shall be blessed all nations.” Thou that hast given up the unity of all nations, and in a part hast remained, hast polluted His Testament.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p100"></a>21. “And His heart hath drawn near” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022">Psa. 55.22</a><a name="ii.LV-p100.1"></a>). Of whom do we understand it, except of Him, by the anger of whom they have been divided? How “hath his heart drawn near”? In such sort, that we may understand His will. For by heretics hath been vindicated the Catholic Church, and by those that think evil have been proved those that think well. For many things lay hid in the Scriptures: and when heretics  had been cut off, with questions they troubled the Church of God: then those things were opened which lay hid, and the will of God was understood. <a name="fr_2053"></a><a href="#fn_2053"><font size="1">2054</font></a>
  Thence is said in another Psalm, “In order that they might be excluded that have been proved with silver.” <a name="fr_2054"></a><a href="#fn_2054"><font size="1">2055</font></a>
  For let them be excluded, He hath said, let them come forth, let them appear. Whence even in silver-working men are called “excluders,” that is, pressers out <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_217"></a>of form from the sort of confusion of the lump. Therefore many men that could understand and expound the Scriptures very excellently, were hidden among the people of God: but they did not declare the solution of difficult questions, when no reviler again urged them. For was the  Trinity perfectly treated of before the Arians snarled thereat? Was repentance perfectly treated of before the Novatians opposed? So not perfectly of Baptism was it treated, before rebaptizers removed outside <a name="fr_2055"></a><a href="#fn_2055"><font size="1">2056</font></a>
  contradicted; nor of the very oneness of Christ were the doctrines clearly stated which have been stated, save after that this separation began to press upon the weak: in order that they that knew how to treat of and solve these questions (lest the weak should perish vexed with the questions of the ungodly), by their discourses and disputations should bring out unto open day the dark things of the Law. <a name="fr_2056"></a><a href="#fn_2056"><font size="1">2057</font></a>
 …This obscure sense see in what manner the Apostle bringeth out into light; “It is needful,” he saith, “that also heresies there be, in order that men proved may be made manifest among you.” <a name="fr_2057"></a><a href="#fn_2057"><font size="1">2058</font></a>
  What is “men proved”? Proved with silver, proved with the word. What is “may be made manifest”? May be brought out. <a name="fr_2058"></a><a href="#fn_2058"><font size="1">2059</font></a>
  Wherefore this? Because of heretics. So therefore these also “have been divided because of the anger of His countenance, and His heart hath drawn near.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p107"></a>22. “His discourses have been softened above oil, and themselves are darts” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#021">Psa. 55.21</a><a name="ii.LV-p107.1"></a>). For certain things in the Scriptures were seeming hard, while they were obscure; when explained, they have been softened. For even the first heresy in the disciples of Christ, as it were from the hardness of His discourse arose. For when He said, “Except a man shall have eaten My flesh and shall have drunk My blood, he shall  not have life in himself:” they, not understanding, said to one another, “Hard is this discourse, who can hear it?” Saying that, “Hard is this discourse,” they separated from Him: He remained with the others, the twelve. When they had intimated to Him, that by His discourse they had been scandalized, “Will ye also,” He saith, “choose to go?” Then Peter: “Thou hast the Word of life eternal: to whom shall we go?” <a name="fr_2059"></a><a href="#fn_2059"><font size="1">2060</font></a>
  Attend, we beseech you, and ye little ones learn godliness. Did Peter by any means at that time understand the secret of that discourse of the Lord? Not yet he understood: but that good were the words which he understood not, godly he believed. Therefore if hard is a discourse, and not yet is understood, be it hard to an ungodly man, but to thee be it by godliness softened: for whenever it is solved, it both will become for thee oil, and even unto the bones it will  penetrate.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p109"></a>23. Furthermore, just as Peter, after their having been scandalized by the hardness, as they thought, of the discourse of the Lord, even then said, “to whom shall we go?” so he hath added, “Cast upon the Lord thy care, and He shall Himself nourish thee up” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022">Psa. 55.22</a><a name="ii.LV-p109.1"></a>). A little one thou art, not yet thou understandest the secret things of words: perchance from thee the bread is hidden, and as yet with milk thou must be fed: <a name="fr_2060"></a><a href="#fn_2060"><font size="1">2061</font></a>
  be not angry with the breasts: they will make thee fit for the table, for which now little fitted thou art. Behold by the division of heretics many hard things have been softened: His discourses that were hard have been softened above oil, and they are themselves darts. They have armed men preaching the Gospel: and the very discourses are aimed at the breast of every one that heareth, by men instant in season and out of season: by those discourses, by those  words, as though by arrows, hearts of men unto the love of peace are smitten. Hard they were, and soft they have been made. Being softened they have not lost their virtue, but into darts have been converted.…Upon the Lord cast thyself. Behold thou wilt cast thyself upon the Lord, let no one put himself in the place of the Lord. “Cast upon the Lord thy care.”…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p111"></a>24. But to the others what? “But Thou, O God, shall bring them down unto the pit of corruption” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023">Psa. 55.23</a><a name="ii.LV-p111.1"></a>). The pit of corruption is the darkness of sinking under. When blind leadeth blind, they both fall into a ditch. <a name="fr_2061"></a><a href="#fn_2061"><font size="1">2062</font></a>
  God bringeth them down into the pit of corruption, not because He is the author of their own guilt, but because He is Himself the judge of their iniquities. “For God hath delivered them unto the desires of their heart.” <a name="fr_2062"></a><a href="#fn_2062"><font size="1">2063</font></a>
  For they have loved darkness, and not light; they have loved blindness, and not seeing. For behold the Lord Jesus hath shone out to the whole world, let them sing in unity with the whole world: “For there is not one that can hide himself from the heat of Him.” <a name="fr_2063"></a><a href="#fn_2063"><font size="1">2064</font></a>
  But they passing over from the whole to a part, from the body to a wound, from life to a limb cut off, shall meet with what, but going into the pit of corruption?</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p115"></a>25. “Men of bloods and of deceitfulness.” Men of bloods, because of slayings he calleth them: and O that they were corporal and not spiritual slayings. For blood from the flesh going forth, is seen and shuddered at: who seeth the blood of the heart in a man rebaptized? Those deaths require other eyes. Although even about these visible deaths Circumcelliones armed <a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218</font></a> <a name="ii.LV-Page_218"></a>everywhere remain not quiet. And if we think of these visible deaths,  there are men of bloods. Give heed to the armed man, whether he is a man of peace and not of blood. If at least a club only he were to carry, well; but he carrieth a sling, carrieth an axe, carrieth stones, carrieth lances; and carrying these weapons, wherever they may they scour, for the blood of innocent men they thirst. <a name="fr_2064"></a><a href="#fn_2064"><font size="1">2065</font></a>
  Therefore even with regard to these visible deaths there are men of bloods. But even of them let us say, O that such deaths alone they perpetrated, and souls they slew not. These that are men of bloods and of deceit, let them not suppose that we thus wrongly understand men of bloods, of them that kill souls: they themselves of their Maximianists <a name="fr_2065"></a><a href="#fn_2065"><font size="1">2066</font></a>
  have so understood it. For when they condemned them, in the very sentence of their Council they have set down these words: “Swift are the feet of them to shed the blood” (of the proclaimers <a name="fr_2066"></a><a href="#fn_2066"><font size="1">2067</font></a>
 ), “tribulation and calamity are in the ways of them, and the way of peace they have not known.” <a name="fr_2067"></a><a href="#fn_2067"><font size="1">2068</font></a>
  This of the Maximianists they have said. But I ask of them, when have the Maximianists shed the bodys blood; not because they too would not shed, if there were so great a multitude as could shed, but because of the fear in their minority rather they have suffered somewhat from others, than have themselves at any time done any such thing. Therefore I question the Donatist and say: In thy Council thou hast set down of the Maximianists, “Swift are the feet of them to  shed blood.” Show me one of whom the Maximianists have hurt so much as a finger! What other thing to me is he to answer, than that which I say? They that have separated themselves from unity, <a name="fr_2068"></a><a href="#fn_2068"><font size="1">2069</font></a>
  and who slay souls by leading astray, spiritually, not carnally, do shed blood. Very well thou hast expounded, but in thy exposition acknowledge their own deeds. “Men of bloods and of deceitfulness.” In guile is deceitfulness, in dissimulation, in seduction. What therefore of those very men that have been divided because of the anger of His countenance? They are themselves men of bloods and of deceit.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LV-p121"></a>26. But of them he saith what? “They shall not halve their days.” What is, “They shall not halve their days”? They shall not make progress as much as they think: within the time which they expect, they shall perish. For he is that partridge, whereof hath been said, “In the half of his days they shall leave him, and in his last days he shall be an unwise one.” <a name="fr_2069"></a><a href="#fn_2069"><font size="1">2070</font></a>
  They make progress, but for a time. For what saith the Apostle? “But evil men and seducers shall make progress for the worse, themselves erring, and other men into error driving.” <a name="fr_2070"></a><a href="#fn_2070"><font size="1">2071</font></a>
  But “a blind man leading a blind man, together into a ditch they fall.” <a name="fr_2071"></a><a href="#fn_2071"><font size="1">2072</font></a>
  Deservedly they fall “into the pit of corruption.” What therefore saith he? They shall make progress for the worse: not however for long. For a little before he hath said, “But further they shall not make progress:” <a name="fr_2072"></a><a href="#fn_2072"><font size="1">2073</font></a>
  that is, “shall not halve their days.” Let the Apostle proceed and tell wherefore: “For the madness of them shall be manifest to all men, as also was that of the others.” “But I in Thee will hope, O Lord.” But deservedly they shall not halve their days, because in man they have hoped. But I from days temporal have reached unto day eternal. Wherefore? Because in Thee I have hoped, O Lord.</p>
