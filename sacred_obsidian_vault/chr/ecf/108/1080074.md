 </p><p class="c10"><a name="ii.LXIII-p1"></a> <a name="ii.LXIII-p1.1"></a><span class="c20"><a name="ii.LXIII-p1.2"></a>Psalm LXIII. <a name="fr_2458"></a><a href="#fn_2458"><font size="1">2459</font></a>
 </span></p>  
 <p class="c26"><a name="ii.LXIII-p3"></a>1. This psalm hath the title, “For David himself, when he was in the desert of Idumæa.” By the name of Idumæa is understood this world. For Idumæa was a certain nation of men going astray, where idols were worshipped. In no good sense is put this Idumæa. If not in a good sense it is put, it must be understood that this life, wherein we suffer so great toils, and wherein to so great necessities we are made subject, by the name of Idumæa is  signified.  <a name="fr_2459"></a><a href="#fn_2459"><font size="1">2460</font></a>
  Even here is a desert where there is much thirst, and ye are to hear the voice of One now thirsting in the desert. But if we acknowledge ourselves as thirsting, we shall acknowledge ourselves as drinking also. For he that thirsteth in this world, in the world to come shall be satisfied, according to the Lords saying, “Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, <a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a> <a name="ii.LXIII-Page_259"></a>for the same shall be satisfied.”   <a name="fr_2460"></a><a href="#fn_2460"><font size="1">2461</font></a>
  Therefore in this world we ought not to love fulness. Here we must thirst, in another place we shall be filled. But now in order that we may not faint in this desert, He sprinkleth upon us the dew of His word, and leaveth us not utterly to dry up, so that there should not be in our case any seeking of us again, but that we may so thirst as that we may drink. But in order that we may drink, with somewhat of His Grace we are sprinkled: nevertheless we thirst. And  what saith our soul to God?</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p6"></a>2. “God, my God, unto Thee from the light I watch” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001">Psa. 63.1</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p6.1"></a>). What is to watch? It is, not to sleep. What is to sleep? There is a sleep of the soul; there is a sleep of the body. Sleep of body we all ought to have: because if sleep of body is not taken, a man fainteth, the body itself fainteth. For our frail body cannot long sustain a soul watching and on the stretch on active works; if for a long time the soul shall have been intent on active pursuits, the body being frail and earthly holdeth her not,  sustaineth her not for ever in activity, and fainteth and falleth. Therefore God hath granted sleep to the body, whereby are recruited the members of the body, in order that they may be able to sustain the soul watching. But of this let us take heed, namely, that our soul herself sleep not: for evil is the sleep of the soul. Good is the sleep of the body, whereby is recruited the health of the body. But the sleep of the soul is to forget her God. Whatsoever soul shall have forgotten  her God, sleepeth. Therefore the Apostle saith to certain persons that forgot their God, and being as it were in sleep, did act the follies of the worship of idols—the Apostle, I say, saith to certain persons, “Rise, thou that sleepest, and rise up from the dead, and Christ shall enlighten thee.” <a name="fr_2461"></a><a href="#fn_2461"><font size="1">2462</font></a>
  Was the Apostle waking up one sleeping in body? Nay, but he was waking a soul sleeping, inasmuch as he was waking her, in order that she might be lightened by Christ. Therefore as to these same watchings saith this man, “God, my God, unto Thee from the light I watch.” For thou wouldest not watch of thyself, unless there should arise thy Light, to wake thee from sleep. For Christ lighteneth souls, and maketh them to watch: but if His light He taketh away, they  slumber. For for this cause to Him there is said in another psalm, “Lighten mine eyes, that I may never slumber in death.” <a name="fr_2462"></a><a href="#fn_2462"><font size="1">2463</font></a>
 …</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p9"></a>3. “My soul hath thirsted for Thee” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002">Psa. 63.2</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p9.1"></a>). Behold that desert of Idumæa. See how here he thirsteth: but see what good thing is here, “Hath thirsted for Thee.” For there are they that thirst, but not for God. For every one that willeth anything to be granted to him, is in the heat of longing; the longing itself is the thirst of the soul. And see ye what <a name="fr_2463"></a><a href="#fn_2463"><font size="1">2464</font></a>
  longings there are in the hearts of men: one longeth for gold, another longeth for silver, another longeth for possessions, another inheritance, another abundance of money, another many herds, another a wife, another honours, another sons. Ye see those longings, how they are in the hearts of men. All men are inflamed with longing, and scarce is found one to say, “My soul hath thirsted for Thee.” For men thirst for the world: and perceive not themselves to be in  the desert of Idumæa, where their souls ought to thirst for God.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p11"></a>4. Wisdom therefore must be thirsted after, righteousness must be thirsted after. With it we shall not be satisfied, with it we shall not be filled, save when this life shall have been ended, and we shall have come to that which God hath promised. For God hath promised equality with Angels: <a name="fr_2464"></a><a href="#fn_2464"><font size="1">2465</font></a>
  and now the Angels thirst not as we do, they hunger not as we do; but they have the fulness of truth, of light, of immortal wisdom. Therefore blessed they are, and out of so great blessedness, because they are in that City, the Heavenly Jerusalem, afar from whence we now are sojourning in a strange land, they observe us sojourners, and they pity us, and by the command of the Lord they help us, in order that to this common country sometime we may return, and there with them  sometime with the Lords fountain of truth and eternity we may be filled. Now therefore let our soul thirst: whence doth our flesh also thirst, and this in many ways? “In many ways for Thee,” he saith, “my flesh also.” Because to our flesh also is promised Resurrection. As to our soul is promised blessedness, so also to our flesh is promised resurrection.…For if God hath made us that were not, is it a great thing for Him to make again us that were? Therefore let not this  seem to you to be incredible, because ye see dead men as it were decaying, and passing into ashes and into dust. Or if any dead man be burned, or if dogs tear him in pieces, do ye think that from this he will not rise again? All things which are dismembered, and into a sort of dust do decay, are entire with God. For into those elements of the world they pass, whence at first they have come, when we were made: we do not see them; but yet God will bring them forth, He knoweth whence,  because even before we were, He created us from whence He knew. Such a resurrection of the flesh therefore to us is promised, as that, although it be the same flesh that now we carry <a name="fr_2465"></a><a href="#fn_2465"><font size="1">2466</font></a>
  which is to rise again, yet it hath not <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a> <a name="ii.LXIII-Page_260"></a>the corruption which now it hath. For now because of the corruption of frailty, if we eat not, we faint and are hungry; if we drink not, we faint and are thirsty; if long time we watch, we faint and sleep; if long time we sleep, we faint, therefore we watch.…Secondly, see how without any standing is our flesh: for infancy passeth away into boyhood, and thou seekest infancy, and infancy is not, for now instead of  infancy is boyhood: again this same also passeth into youth, thou seekest boyhood and findest not: the young man becometh a middle-aged man, thou seekest the young man and he is not: the middle-aged man becometh an old man, thou seekest a middle-aged man and findest not: and an old man dieth, thou seekest an old man and findest not: our age therefore standeth not still: everywhere is weariness, everywhere faintness, everywhere corruption. Observing what a hope of resurrection God  promiseth to us, in all those our manifold faintings we thirst for that incorruption: and so our flesh manifoldly doth thirst for God.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p14"></a>5. Nevertheless, my brethren, the flesh of a good Christian and a believer even in this world for God doth thirst: for if the flesh hath need of bread, if it hath need of water, if it hath need of wine, if it hath need of money, if this flesh hath need of a beast, from God it ought to seek it, not from demons and idols and I know not what powers of this world. For there are certain who when they suffer hunger in this world, leave God and ask Mercury or ask  Jove to give unto them, or her whom they call “Heavenly,” <a name="fr_2466"></a><a href="#fn_2466"><font size="1">2467</font></a>
  or any the like demons: not for God their flesh thirsteth. But they that thirst for God, <a name="fr_2467"></a><a href="#fn_2467"><font size="1">2468</font></a>
  everywhere ought to thirst for Him, both soul and flesh: for to the soul also God giveth His bread, that is the Word of Truth: and to the flesh God giveth the things which are necessary, for God hath made both soul and flesh. For the sake of thy flesh thou askest of demons: hath God made the soul, and the demons made the flesh? He that hath made the soul, the Same hath made the flesh also: He that hath made both of them, the Same feedeth both of them. Let either  part of us thirst for God, and after labour manifold let either simply be filled.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p17"></a>6. But where thirsteth our soul, and our flesh manifoldly, not for any one but for Thee, O Lord, that is our God? it thirsteth where? “In a land desert, and without way, and without water.” Of this world we have spoken, the same is Idumæa, this is the desert of Idumæa, whence the Psalm hath received its title. “In a land desert.” Too little it is to say “desert,” where no man dwelleth; it is besides, both “without way, and without  water.” O that the same desert had even a way: O that into this a man running, even knew where he might thence get forth!…Evil is the desert, horrible, and to be feared: and nevertheless God hath pitied us, and hath made for us a way in the desert, Himself our Lord Jesus Christ: <a name="fr_2468"></a><a href="#fn_2468"><font size="1">2469</font></a>
  and hath made for us a consolation in the desert, in sending to us preachers of His Word: and hath given to us water in the desert, by fulfilling with the Holy Spirit His preachers, in order that there might be created in them a well of water springing up unto life everlasting. <a name="fr_2469"></a><a href="#fn_2469"><font size="1">2470</font></a>
  And, lo! we have here all things, but they are not of the desert.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p20"></a>7. “Thus in a holy thing I have appeared to Thee, that I might see Thy power and Thy glory” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#003">Psa. 63.3</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p20.1"></a>).…Unless a man first thirst in that desert, that is in the evil wherein he is, he never arriveth at the good, which is God. But “I have appeared to Thee,” he saith, “in a holy thing.” Now in a holy thing is there great consolation. “I have appeared to Thee,” is what? In order that Thou mightest see  me: and for this reason Thou hast seen me, in order that I might see Thee. “I have appeared to Thee, that I might see.” He hath not said, “I have appeared to Thee, that Thou mightest see:” but, “I have appeared to Thee, that I might see Thy power and Thy glory.” Whence also the Apostle, “But now,” he saith, “knowing God, nay, having been known of God.” <a name="fr_2470"></a><a href="#fn_2470"><font size="1">2471</font></a>
  For first ye have appeared to God, in order that to you God might be able to appear. “That I might see Thy power and Thy glory.” In truth in that forsaken place, that is, in that desert, if as though from the desert a man striveth to obtain enough for his sustenance, he will never see the power of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord, but he will remain to die of thirst, and will find neither way, nor consolation, nor water, whereby he may endure in the desert. But  when he shall have lifted up himself to God, so as to say to Him out of all his inward parts, “My soul hath thirsted for Thee; how manifoldly for Thee also my flesh!” lest perchance even the things necessary for the flesh of others he ask, and not of God, or else long not for that resurrection of the flesh, which God hath promised to us: when, I say, he shall have lifted up himself, he will have no small consolations.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p22"></a>8. …But ye have heard but now when the Gospel was being read in what terms He hath notified His Majesty: “I and My Father are One.” <a name="fr_2471"></a><a href="#fn_2471"><font size="1">2472</font></a>
  Behold how great a Majesty and how <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a> <a name="ii.LXIII-Page_261"></a>great an Equality with the Father hath come down to the flesh because of our infirmity. Behold how greatly beloved we have been, before that we loved God. If before that we loved God, so much by Him we were beloved, as that His Son, Equal with Himself, He made a Man for our sake, what doth He reserve for us now loving Him? Therefore many men think it to be a very small thing that the Son of God hath appeared  on earth; because they are not in the Holy One, to them hath not appeared the power of the Same and the glory of the Same: that is, not yet have they a heart made holy, whence they may perceive the eminence of that virtue, and may render thanks to God, nor that to which for their own sakes so great an One came, unto what a nativity, unto what a Passion, they are not able to see, His glory and His power. <a name="fr_2472"></a><a href="#fn_2472"><font size="1">2473</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p25"></a>9. “For better is Thy mercy than <a name="fr_2473"></a><a href="#fn_2473"><font size="1">2474</font></a>
  lives.” Many are the lives of men, but one life God promiseth: and He giveth not this to us as if for our merits but for His mercy.…For what is so just a thing as that a sinner should be punished? Though a just thing it be that a sinner should be punished, it hath belonged to the mercy of Him not to punish a sinner but to justify him, and of a sinner to make a just man, and of an ungodly man to make a godly man. Therefore “His mercy is better than lives.”  What lives? Those which for themselves men have chosen. One hath chosen for himself a life of business, another a country life, another a life of usury, another a military life; one this, another that. Divers are the lives, but “better is Thy” life “than” our “lives.”…“My lips shall praise Thee.” My lips would not praise Thee, unless before me were to go Thy mercy. By Thy gift Thee I praise, through Thy mercy Thee I praise. For I should not be able to praise God,  unless He gave me to be able to praise Him.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p27"></a>10. “So I will speak good of Thee in my life, and in Thy name I will lift up my hands” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005">Psa. 63.5</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p27.1"></a>). Now in my life which to me Thou hast given, not in that which I have chosen after the world with the rest among many lives, but that which Thou hast given to me through Thy mercy, that I should praise Thee. “So I will speak good of Thee in my life.” What is “so”? That to Thy mercy I may ascribe my life  wherein Thee I praise, not to my merits. “And in Thy name I will lift up my hands.” Lift up therefore hands in prayer. Our Lord hath lifted up for us His hands on the Cross, and stretched out were His hands for us, and therefore were His hands stretched out on the Cross, in order that our hands might be stretched out unto good works: because His Cross hath brought us mercy. Behold, He hath lifted up hands, and hath offered for us Himself a Sacrifice to God, and through that  Sacrifice have been effaced all our sins. Let us also lift up our hands to God in prayer: and our hands being lifted up to God shall not be confounded, if they be exercised in good works. For what doth he that lifteth up hands? Whence hath it been commanded that with hands lifted up we should pray to God? For the Apostle saith, “Lifting up pure hands without anger and dissension.” <a name="fr_2474"></a><a href="#fn_2474"><font size="1">2475</font></a>
  It is in order that when thou liftest up hands to God, there may come into thy mind thy works. For whereas those hands are lifted up that thou mayest obtain that which thou wilt, those same hands thou thinkest in good works to exercise, that they may not blush to be lifted up to God. “In thy name I will lift up my hands.” Those are our prayers in this Idumæa, in this desert, in the land without water and without way, where for us Christ is the Way,    <a name="fr_2475"></a><a href="#fn_2475"><font size="1">2476</font></a>
  but not the way of this earth.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p30"></a>11. …Already our fathers are dead, but God liveth: here we could not always have fathers, but there we shall alway have one living Father, when we have our father-land.…What sort of country is that? But thou lovest here riches. God Himself shall be to thee thy riches. But thou lovest a good fountain. What is more passing clear than that wisdom? What more bright? Whatsoever is an object of love here, in place of all thou shalt have Him that hath made  all things, “as though with marrow and fatness my soul should be filled: and lips of exultation shall praise Thy name.” In this desert, in Thy name I will lift up my hands: let my soul be filled as though with marrow and fatness, “and my lips with exultation shall praise Thy name.” For now is prayer, so long as there is thirst: when thirst shall have passed away, there passeth away praying and there succeedeth praising. “And lips of exultation shall praise Thy name.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p31"></a>12. “If I have remembered Thee upon my bed, in the dawnings I did meditate on thee (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#007">Psa. 63.7</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p31.1"></a>): because Thou hast become my helper” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008">Psa. 63.8</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p31.2"></a>). His “bed” he calleth his rest. When any one is at rest, let him be mindful of God; when any one is at rest, let him not by rest be dissolved, and forget God: if mindful he is of God when he is at rest, in his actions on God he doth meditate. For the dawn he hath called actions, because every man at dawn beginneth to do something. What therefore hath he said? If therefore I was not mindful on my bed, in the dawn also I did not meditate on Thee. Can he  that thinketh not of God when he is at leisure, in his actions think of God? But he that is mindful of Him when he <a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a> <a name="ii.LXIII-Page_262"></a>is at rest, on the Same doth meditate when he is doing, lest in action he should come short. Therefore he hath added what? “Because Thou has become my helper.” For unless God aid our good works, they cannot be accomplished by us. And worthy things we ought to work: that is, as though in the light, since by Christ showing the way we work.  Whosoever worketh evil things, in the night he worketh, not in the dawn; according to the Apostle, saying, “They that are drunken, in the night are drunken; and they that sleep, in the night do sleep; let us that are of the day, be sober.” <a name="fr_2476"></a><a href="#fn_2476"><font size="1">2477</font></a>
  He exhorteth us that after the day we should walk honestly: “As in the day, honestly let us walk.” <a name="fr_2477"></a><a href="#fn_2477"><font size="1">2478</font></a>
  And again, “Ye,” he saith, “are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness.” <a name="fr_2478"></a><a href="#fn_2478"><font size="1">2479</font></a>
  Who are sons of night, and sons of darkness? They that work all evil things. To such a degree they are sons of night, that they fear lest the things which they work should be seen.…No one therefore in the dawn worketh, except him that in Christ worketh. But he that while at leisure is mindful of Christ, on the Same doth meditate in all his actions, and He is a helper to him in a good work, lest through his weakness he fail. “And in the covering of Thy wings I  will exult.” I am cheerful in good works, because over me is the covering of Thy wings. If thou protect me not, forasmuch as I am a chicken, the kite will seize me. For our Lord Himself saith in a certain place to that Jerusalem, a certain city, where He was crucified: “Jerusalem,” He saith, “Jerusalem, how often I have willed to gather thy sons, as though a hen her chickens, and thou wouldest not.” <a name="fr_2479"></a><a href="#fn_2479"><font size="1">2480</font></a>
  Little ones we are: therefore may God protect us under the shadow of His wings. What when we shall have grown greater? A good thing it is for us that even then He should protect us, so that under Him the greater, alway we be chickens. For alway He is greater, however much we may have grown. Let no one say, let Him protect me while I am a little one: as if sometime he would attain to such magnitude, as should be self-sufficient. Without the protection of God,  nought thou art. Alway by Him let us desire to be protected: then alway in Him we shall have power to be great, if alway under Him little we be. “And in the covering of Thy wings I will exult.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p36"></a>13. “My soul hath been glued on behind Thee” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009">Psa. 63.9</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p36.1"></a>). See ye one longing, see ye one thirsting, see ye how he cleaveth to God. Let there spring up in you this affection. If already it is sprouting, let it be rained upon and grow: let it come to such strength, that ye also may say from the whole heart, “My soul hath been glued on behind Thee.” Where is that same glue? The glue itself is love. Have thou  love, wherewith as with glue thy soul may be glued on behind God. Not with God, but behind God; that He may go before, thou mayest follow. For he that shall have willed to go before God, by his own counsel would live, and will not follow the commandments of God. Because of this even Peter was rebuked, when he willed to give counsel to Christ, who was going to suffer for us.…“Far be it from Thee, O Lord, be Thou merciful to Thyself.” And the Lord, “Go back behind Me, Satan: for  thou savourest not the things which are of God, but the things which are of men.” <a name="fr_2480"></a><a href="#fn_2480"><font size="1">2481</font></a>
  Wherefore, the things which are of men? Because to go before Me thou desirest, go back behind Me, in order that thou mayest follow me: so that now following Christ he might say, “My soul hath been glued on behind Thee.” With reason he addeth, “Me Thy right hand hath taken up.” This Christ hath said in us: that is in the Man <a name="fr_2481"></a><a href="#fn_2481"><font size="1">2482</font></a>
  which He was bearing for us, which He was offering for us, He hath said this. The Church also said this in Christ, she saith it in her Head: for she too hath suffered here great persecutions, and by her individual members even now she suffereth.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p39"></a>14. “But themselves in vain have sought my soul. They shall go unto the lower places of the earth” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009">Psa. 63.9</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p39.1"></a>). Earth they were unwilling to lose, when they crucified Christ: into the lower places of the earth they have gone. What are the lower places of the earth? Earthly lusts. Better it is to walk upon earth, than by lust to go under earth. For every one that in prejudice of his salvation desireth earthly  things, is under the earth: because earth he hath put before him, earth upon himself he hath put, and himself beneath he hath laid. They therefore fearing to lose earth, said what of the Lord Jesus Christ, when they saw great multitudes go after Him, forasmuch as He was doing wonderful things? “If we shall have let Him go alive, there will come the Romans, and will take away from us both place and nation.” <a name="fr_2482"></a><a href="#fn_2482"><font size="1">2483</font></a>
  They feared to lose earth, and they went under the earth: there befell them even what they feared. For they willed to kill Christ, that they might not lose earth; and earth they therefore lost, because Christ they slew. For when Christ had been slain, because the Lord Himself had said to them, “The kingdom shall be taken from you, and shall be given up to a nation doing righteousness:” <a name="fr_2483"></a><a href="#fn_2483"><font size="1">2484</font></a>
  there followed them great calamities of persecutions: there conquered them Roman emperors, and kings of the nations: they were shut out from <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a> <a name="ii.LXIII-Page_263"></a>that very place where they crucified Christ, and now that place is full of Christian praisers: it hath no Jew, it hath been cleared of the enemies of Christ, it hath been fulfilled with the praisers of Christ. Behold, they have lost at the hands of the Romans the place, because Christ they slew, who to this  end slew, that they might not lose the place at the hands of the Romans. Therefore, “They shall enter into the lower places of the earth.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXIII-p42"></a>15. “They shall be delivered unto the hands of the sword” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010">Psa. 63.10</a><a name="ii.LXIII-p42.1"></a>). In truth, thus it hath visibly befallen them, they have been taken by storm by enemies breaking in. “Portions of foxes they shall be.” Foxes he calleth the kings of the world, that then were when Judæa was conquered. Hear in order that ye may know and perceive, that those he calleth foxes. Herod the king the Lord Himself hath called a fox. “Go ye,” He saith, “and tell that fox.” <a name="fr_2484"></a><a href="#fn_2484"><font size="1">2485</font></a>
  See and observe, my brethren: Christ as King they would not have, and portions of foxes they have been made. For when Pilate the deputy governor in Judæa slew Christ at the voices of the Jews, he said to the same Jews, “Your King shall I crucify?” <a name="fr_2485"></a><a href="#fn_2485"><font size="1">2486</font></a>
  Because He was called King of the Jews, and He was the true King. And they rejecting Christ said, “We have no king but Cæsar.” They rejected a Lamb, chose a fox: deservedly portions of foxes they were made.</p>
