 </p><p class="c10"><a name="ii.LXXI-p1"></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-p1.1"></a><span class="c20"><a name="ii.LXXI-p1.2"></a>Psalm LXXI. <a name="fr_3071"></a><a href="#fn_3071"><font size="1">3072</font></a>
 </span></p>  
 <p class="c26"><a name="ii.LXXI-p3"></a>1. In all the holy Scriptures the grace of God that delivereth us commendeth itself to us, in order that it may have us commended. This is sung of in this Psalm, whereof we have undertaken to speak.…This grace the Apostle commendeth: by this he got to have the Jews for enemies, boasting of the letter of the law and of their own justice. This then commending in the lesson which hath been read, he saith thus: “For I am the least of the Apostles, that am  not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.” <a name="fr_3072"></a><a href="#fn_3072"><font size="1">3073</font></a>
  “But therefore mercy,” he saith, “I obtained, because ignorant I did it in unbelief.” <a name="fr_3073"></a><a href="#fn_3073"><font size="1">3074</font></a>
  Then a little afterwards, “Faithful the saying is, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am first.” <a name="fr_3074"></a><a href="#fn_3074"><font size="1">3075</font></a>
  Were there before him not any sinners? What then, was he the first then? Yea, going before all men not in time, but in evil disposition. “But therefore,” he saith, “mercy I obtained,” in order that in me Christ Jesus might show all long-suffering, for the imitation of those that shall believe in Him unto life eternal: that is, every sinner and unjust man, already despairing of himself, already having the mind of a gladiator, <a name="fr_3075"></a><a href="#fn_3075"><font size="1">3076</font></a>
  so as to do whatsoever he willeth, because he must needs be condemned, may yet observe the Apostle Paul, to whom so great cruelty and so very evil a disposition was forgiven by God; and by not despairing of himself may he be turned unto God. This grace God doth commend to us in this Psalm also.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p8"></a>2. The title then of this Psalm is, as usual, a title intimating on the threshold what is being done in the house: “To David himself for the sons of Jonadab, and for those that were first led captive.” Jonadab (he is commended to us in the prophecy of Jeremiah) was a certain man, who had enjoined his sons not to drink wine, and not to dwell in houses, but in tents. But the commandment of the father the sons kept and observed, and by this earned a  blessing from the Lord. <a name="fr_3076"></a><a href="#fn_3076"><font size="1">3077</font></a>
  Now the Lord had not commanded this, but their own father. But they so received it as though it were a commandment from the Lord their God; for even though the Lord had not commanded that they should drink no wine and should dwell in tents; yet the Lord had commanded that sons should obey their father. In this case alone a son ought not to obey his father, if his father should have commanded anything contrary to the Lord his God. For indeed the father ought not to be  angry, when God is preferred before him. But when a father doth command that which is not contrary to God; he must be heard as God is: because to obey ones father God hath enjoined. God then blessed the sons of Jonadab because of their obedience, and thrust them in the teeth of His disobedient people, reproaching them, because while the sons of Jonadab were obedient to their father, they obeyed not their God. But while Jeremiah was treating of these topics, he had this object in  regard to the people of Israel, that they should prepare themselves to be led for captivity into Babylon, and should not hope for any other thing, but that they were to be captives. The title then of this Psalm seemeth from thence to have taken its hue, so that when he had said, “Of the sons of Jonadab;” he added, “and of them that were first led captive:” not that the sons of Jonadab were led captive, but because to them that were to be led captive there were <a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 316</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_316"></a>opposed the sons of Jonadab, because they were obedient to their father: in order that they might understand that they had been made captive, because they were not obedient to God. It is added also that Jonadab is interpreted, “the Lords spontaneous one.” What is this, the Lords spontaneous one? Serving God freely with the will. What is, the Lords spontaneous one? “In me are, O God, Thy vows, which I will render of praise to Thee.”   <a name="fr_3077"></a><a href="#fn_3077"><font size="1">3078</font></a>
  What is, the Lords spontaneous one? “Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee.” <a name="fr_3078"></a><a href="#fn_3078"><font size="1">3079</font></a>
  For if the Apostolic teaching admonisheth a slave to serve a human master, not as though of necessity, but of good will, and by freely serving make himself in heart free; how much more must God be served with whole and full and free will, who seeth thy very will?…The first man made us captive, the second man hath delivered us from captivity. “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.” But in Adam they die through the fleshs nativity, in  Christ they are delivered through the hearts faith. It was not in thy power not to be born of Adam: it is in thy power to believe in Christ. Howsoever much then thou shalt have willed to belong to the first man, unto captivity thou wilt belong. And what is, shalt have willed to belong? or what is, shalt belong? Already thou belongest: cry out, “Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” <a name="fr_3079"></a><a href="#fn_3079"><font size="1">3080</font></a>
  Let us hear then this man crying out this.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p13"></a>3. “O God, in Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001">Psa. 71.1</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p13.1"></a>). Already I have been confounded, but not for everlasting. For how is he not confounded, to whom is said, “What fruit had ye in these things wherein ye now blush?” <a name="fr_3080"></a><a href="#fn_3080"><font size="1">3081</font></a>
  What then shall be done, that we may not be confounded for everlasting? “Draw near unto Him, and be ye enlightened, and your faces shall not blush.” <a name="fr_3081"></a><a href="#fn_3081"><font size="1">3082</font></a>
  Confounded ye are in Adam, withdraw from Adam, draw near unto Christ, and then ye shall not be confounded. “In Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting.” If in myself I am now <a name="fr_3082"></a><a href="#fn_3082"><font size="1">3083</font></a>
  confounded, in Thee I shall not be confounded for everlasting.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p17"></a>4. “In Thine own righteousness deliver me, and save me” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#002">Psa. 71.2</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p17.1"></a>). Not in mine own, but in Thine own: for if in mine own, I shall be one of those whereof he saith, “Being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and their own righteousness willing to establish, to the righteousness of God they were not made subject.” <a name="fr_3083"></a><a href="#fn_3083"><font size="1">3084</font></a>
  Therefore, “in Thine own righteousness,” not in mine. For mine is what? Iniquity hath gone before. And when I shall be righteous, Thine own righteousness it will be: for by righteousness given to me by Thee I shall be righteous; and it shall be so mine, as that it be Thine, that is, given to me by Thee. For I believe on Him that justifieth an ungodly man, so that my faith is counted for righteousness. <a name="fr_3084"></a><a href="#fn_3084"><font size="1">3085</font></a>
  Even so then the righteousness shall be mine, not however as though mine own, not as though by mine own self given to myself: as they thought who through the letter made their boast, and rejected grace.…It is a small thing then that thou acknowledge the good thing which is in thee to be from God, unless also on that account thou exalt not thyself above him that hath not yet, who perchance when he shall have received, will outstrip thee. For when Saul was a stoner of  Stephen, <a name="fr_3085"></a><a href="#fn_3085"><font size="1">3086</font></a>
  how many were the Christians of whom he was persecutor! Nevertheless, when he was converted, all that had gone before he surpassed. Therefore say thou to God that which thou hearest in the Psalm, “In Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting: in Thine own righteousness,” not in mine, “deliver me, and save me.” “Incline unto me Thine ear.” This also is a confession of humility. He that saith, “Incline unto me,” is  confessing that he is lying like a sick man laid at the feet of the Physician standing. Lastly, observe that it is a sick man that is speaking: “Incline unto me Thine ear, and save me.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p21"></a>5. “Be Thou unto me for a protecting God” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003">Psa. 71.3</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p21.1"></a>). Let not the darts of the enemy reach unto me: for I am not able to protect myself. And a small thing is “protecting:” he hath added, “and for a walled place, that Thou mayest save me.” “For a walled place” be Thou to me, be Thou my walled place.…Behold, God Himself hath become the place of thy fleeing unto, who at first was the fearful object of  thy fleeing from. “For a walled place,” he saith, be Thou to me, “that Thou mayest save me.” I shall not be safe except in Thee: except Thou shalt have been my rest, my sickness shall not be able to be made whole. Lift me from the earth; upon Thee I will lie, in order that I may rise unto a walled place. What can be better walled? When unto that place thou shalt have fled for refuge, tell me what adversaries thou wilt dread? Who will lie in wait, and come at thee? A  certain man is said from the summit of a mountain to have cried out, when an Emperor was passing by, “I speak not <a name="fr_3086"></a><a href="#fn_3086"><font size="1">3087</font></a>
  of thee:” the other is said to have looked back and to have said, “Nor I of thee.” He had despised an Emperor with glittering arms, with mighty army. From whence? From a strong place. If he was secure on a high spot of earth, how secure art thou on Him by whom heaven <a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 317</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_317"></a>and earth were made? I, if for myself I shall have chosen another place, shall not be able to be safe. Choose thou indeed, O man, if thou shalt have found one, a place  better walled. There is not then a place whither to flee from Him, except we flee to Him. If thou wilt escape Him angry, flee to Him appeased. “For my firmament and my refuge Thou art.” “My firmament” is what? Through Thee I am firm, and by Thee I am firm. “For my firmament and my refuge Thou art:” in order that I may be made firm by Thee, in whatever respects I shall have been made infirm in myself, I will flee for refuge unto Thee. For firm the grace of Christ  maketh thee, and immovable against all temptations of the enemy. But there is there too human frailness, there is there still the first captivity, there is there too the law in the members fighting against the law of the mind, and willing to lead captive in the law of sin: <a name="fr_3087"></a><a href="#fn_3087"><font size="1">3088</font></a>
  still the body which is corrupt presseth down the soul. <a name="fr_3088"></a><a href="#fn_3088"><font size="1">3089</font></a>
  Howsoever firm thou be by the grace of God, so long as thou still bearest an earthly vessel, wherein the treasure of God is, something must be dreaded even from that same vessel of clay. <a name="fr_3089"></a><a href="#fn_3089"><font size="1">3090</font></a>
  Therefore “my firmament Thou art,” in order that I may be firm in this world against all temptations. But if many they are, and they trouble me: “my refuge Thou art.” For I will confess mine infirmity, to the end that I may be timid like a “hare,” because I am full of thorns like a “hedgehog.” And as in another Psalm is said, “The rock is a refuge for the hedgehogs and the hares:” <a name="fr_3090"></a><a href="#fn_3090"><font size="1">3091</font></a>
  but the Rock was Christ. <a name="fr_3091"></a><a href="#fn_3091"><font size="1">3092</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p28"></a>6. “O God, deliver me from the hand of the sinner” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004">Psa. 71.4</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p28.1"></a>). Generally, sinners, among whom is toiling he that is now to be delivered from captivity: he that now crieth, “Unhappy man I, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <a name="fr_3092"></a><a href="#fn_3092"><font size="1">3093</font></a>
  Within is a foe, that law in the members; there are without also enemies: unto what cryest thou? Unto Him, to whom hath been cried, “From my secret sins cleanse me, O Lord, and from strange sins spare Thy servant.” <a name="fr_3093"></a><a href="#fn_3093"><font size="1">3094</font></a>
 …But these sinners are of two kinds: there are some that have received Law, there are others that have not received: all the heathen have not received Law, all Jews and Christians have received Law. Therefore the general term is sinner; either a transgressor of the Law, if he hath received Law; or only unjust without Law, if he hath not received the Law. Of both kinds speaketh the Apostle, and saith, “They that without Law have sinned, without Law shall perish, and  they that in the Law have sinned, by the Law shall be judged.” <a name="fr_3094"></a><a href="#fn_3094"><font size="1">3095</font></a>
  But thou that amid both kinds dost groan, say to God that which thou hearest in the Psalm, “My God, deliver me from the hand of the sinner.” Of what sinner? “From the hand of him that transgresseth the Law, and of the unjust man.” He that transgresseth the Law is indeed also unjust; for not unjust he is not, that transgresseth the Law: but every one that transgresseth the Law is unjust, not every unjust man doth transgress the Law. For, “Where there is  not a Law,” saith the Apostle, “neither is there transgression.” <a name="fr_3095"></a><a href="#fn_3095"><font size="1">3096</font></a>
  They then that have not received Law, may be called unjust, transgressors they cannot be called. Both are judged after their deservings. But I that from captivity will to be delivered through Thy grace, cry to Thee, “Deliver me from the hand of the sinner.” What is, from the hand of him? From the power of him, that while he is raging, he lead me not unto consenting with him; that while he lieth in wait, he persuade not to iniquity. “From the hand of the  sinner and of the unjust man.”…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p33"></a>7. Lastly, there followeth the reason why I say this: “for Thou art my patience” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005">Psa. 71.5</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p33.1"></a>). Now if He is patience rightly, He is that also which followeth, “O Lord, my hope from my youth.” My patience, because my hope: or rather my hope, because my patience. “Tribulation,” saith the Apostle, “worketh patience, patience probation, but probation hope, but hope confoundeth not.”   <a name="fr_3096"></a><a href="#fn_3096"><font size="1">3097</font></a>
  With reason in Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting. “O Lord, my hope from my youth.” From thy youth is God thy hope? Is He not also from thy boyhood, and from thine infancy? Certainly, saith he. For see what followeth, that thou mayest not think that I have said this, “my hope from my youth,” as if God noways profited mine infancy or my boyhood; hear what followeth: “In Thee I have been strengthened from the womb.”  Hear yet: “From the belly of my mother Thou art my Protector” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006">Psa. 71.6</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p34.2"></a>). Why then, “from my youth,” except it was the period from which I began to hope in Thee? For before in Thee I was not hoping, though Thou wast my Protector, that didst lead me safe unto the time, when I learned to hope in Thee. But from my youth I began in Thee to hope, from the time when Thou didst arm me against the Devil, so that in the girding of Thy host being armed with Thy faith, love, hope, and the rest of Thy gifts, I waged conflict against  Thine invisible enemies, and heard from the Apostle, “There is not for us a wrestling against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and powers,” etc. <a name="fr_3097"></a><a href="#fn_3097"><font size="1">3098</font></a>
  There a young man it is that doth fight against these <a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_318"></a>things: but though he be a young man, he falleth, unless He be the hope of Him to whom he crieth, “O Lord, my hope from my youth.” “In Thee is my singing alway.” Is it only from the time when I began to hope in Thee until now? Nay, but “alway.” What is, “alway”? Not only in the time of faith, but also in the time of sight. For now, “So long as we are in the body we  are absent from the Lord: for by faith we walk, not by sight:” <a name="fr_3098"></a><a href="#fn_3098"><font size="1">3099</font></a>
  there will be a time when we shall see that which being not seen we believe: but when that hath been seen which we believe, we shall rejoice: but when that hath been seen which they believed not, ungodly men shall be confounded. Then will come the substance whereof there is now the hope. But, “Hope which is seen is not hope. But if that which we see not we hope for, through patience we wait for it.” <a name="fr_3099"></a><a href="#fn_3099"><font size="1">3100</font></a>
  Now then thou groanest, now unto a place of refuge thou runnest, in order that thou mayest be saved; now being in infirmity thou entreatest the Physician: what, when thou shalt have received perfect soundness also, what when thou shall have been made “equal to the Angels of God,” <a name="fr_3100"></a><a href="#fn_3100"><font size="1">3101</font></a>
  wilt thou then perchance forget that grace, whereby thou hast been delivered? Far be it.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p39"></a>8. “As it were a monster I have become unto many” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007">Psa. 71.7</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p39.1"></a>). Here in time of hope, in time of groaning, in time of humiliation, in time of sorrow, in time of infirmity, in time of the voice from the fetters—here then what? “As it were a monster I have become unto many.” Why, “As it were a monster”? Why do they insult me that think me a monster? Because I believe that which I see not. For they being happy in those things which they see, exult in drink, in wantonness, in chamberings, in covetousness, in  riches, in robberies, in secular dignities, in the whitening of a mud wall, in these things they exult: but I walk in a different way, contemning those things which are present, and fearing even the prosperous things of the world, and secure in no other thing but the promises of God. And they, “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” <a name="fr_3101"></a><a href="#fn_3101"><font size="1">3102</font></a>
  What sayest thou? Repeat it: “let us eat,” he saith, “and drink.” Come now, what hast thou said afterwards? “for to-morrow we die.” Thou hast terrified, not led me astray. Certainly by the very thing which thou hast said afterwards, thou hast stricken me with fear to consent with thee. “For to-morrow we die,” thou hast said: and there hath preceded, “Let us eat and drink.” For when thou hadst said, “Let us eat and drink;” thou didst  add, “for to-morrow we die.” Hear the other side from me, “Yea let us fast and pray, for to-morrow we die.” I keeping this way, strait and narrow, “as it were a monster have become unto many: but Thou art a strong helper.” Be Thou with me, O Lord Jesus, to say to me, faint not in the narrow way, I first have gone along it, I am the way itself, <a name="fr_3102"></a><a href="#fn_3102"><font size="1">3103</font></a>
  I lead, in Myself I lead, unto Myself I lead home. Therefore though “a monster I have become unto many;” nevertheless I will not fear, for “Thou art a strong Helper.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p42"></a>9. “Let my mouth be fulfilled with praise, that with hymn I may tell of Thy glory, all the day long Thy magnificence” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#008">Psa. 71.8</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p42.1"></a>). What is “all the day long”? Without intermission. In prosperity, because Thou dost comfort: in adversity, because Thou dost correct: before I was in being, because Thou didst make; when I was in being, because Thou didst give health: when I had sinned, because Thou didst forgive; when I was converted, because Thou didst help; when I had persevered, because Thou didst crown.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p43"></a>10. My hope from my youth, “cast me not away in time of old age” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#009">Psa. 71.9</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p43.1"></a>). What is this time of old age? “When my strength shall fail, forsake Thou not me.” Here God maketh this answer to thee, yea indeed let thy strength fail, in order that in thee mine may abide: in order that thou mayest say with the Apostle, “When I am made weak, then I am mighty.” <a name="fr_3103"></a><a href="#fn_3103"><font size="1">3104</font></a>
  Fear not, that thou be cast away in that weakness, in that old age. But why? Was not thy Lord made weak on the Cross? Did not most mighty men and fat bulls before Him, as though a man of no strength, made captive and oppressed, shake the head and say, “If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross”? <a name="fr_3104"></a><a href="#fn_3104"><font size="1">3105</font></a>
  Has he deserted because He was made weak, who preferred not to come down from the Cross, lest He should seem not to have displayed power, but to have yielded to them reviling? What did He hanging teach thee, that would not come down, but patience amid men reviling, but that thou shouldest be strong in thy God? Perchance too in His person was said, “As it were a monster I have become unto many, and Thou art a strong Helper.” <a name="fr_3105"></a><a href="#fn_3105"><font size="1">3106</font></a>
  In His person according to His weakness, not according to His power; according to that whereby He had transformed us into Himself, not according to that wherein He had Himself come down. For He became a monster unto many. And perchance the same was the old age of Him; because on account of its oldness it is not improperly called old age, and the Apostle saith, “Our old man hath been crucified together with Him.” <a name="fr_3106"></a><a href="#fn_3106"><font size="1">3107</font></a>
  If there was there our old man, old age was there; because old, old age. <a name="fr_3107"></a><a href="#fn_3107"><font size="1">3108</font></a>
  Nevertheless, because a true saying is, “Renewed <a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_319"></a>as an eagles shall be Thy youth;” <a name="fr_3108"></a><a href="#fn_3108"><font size="1">3109</font></a>
  He rose Himself the third day, promised a resurrection at the end of the world. Already there hath gone before the Head, the members are to follow. Why dost thou fear lest He should forsake thee, lest He cast thee away for the time of old age, when thy strength shall have failed? Yea at that time in thee will be the strength of Him, when thy strength shall have failed.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p50"></a>11. Why do I say this? “For mine enemies have spoken against me, and they that were keeping watch for My soul, have taken counsel together (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010">Psa. 71.10</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p50.1"></a>): saying, God hath forsaken Him, persecute Him, and seize Him, for there is no one to deliver Him” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011">Psa. 71.11</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p50.2"></a>). This hath been said concerning Christ. For He that with the great power of Divinity, wherein He is equal to the Father, had raised to life dead persons, on a sudden in the hands of enemies became weak, and as if having no power, was seized. When would He have been seized, except they had first said in their heart, “God hath forsaken Him?” Whence there was that voice on the Cross, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?”   <a name="fr_3109"></a><a href="#fn_3109"><font size="1">3110</font></a>
  So then did God forsake Christ, though “God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself,” <a name="fr_3110"></a><a href="#fn_3110"><font size="1">3111</font></a>
  though Christ was also God, out of the Jews indeed according to the flesh, “Who is over all things, God blessed for ever,” <a name="fr_3111"></a><a href="#fn_3111"><font size="1">3112</font></a>
 —did God forsake Him? Far be it. But in our old man our voice it was, because our old man was crucified together with Him: <a name="fr_3112"></a><a href="#fn_3112"><font size="1">3113</font></a>
  and of that same our old man He had taken a Body, because Mary was of Adam. Therefore the very thing which they thought, from the Cross He said, “Why hast Thou forsaken Me?” <a name="fr_3113"></a><a href="#fn_3113"><font size="1">3114</font></a>
  Why do these men think Me left alone to their evil? What is, think Me forsaken in their evil? “For if they had known, the Lord of glory they had never crucified. <a name="fr_3114"></a><a href="#fn_3114"><font size="1">3115</font></a>
  Persecute and seize Him.” More familiarly however, brethren, let us take this of the members of Christ, and acknowledge our own voice in these words: because even He used such words in our person, not in His own power and majesty; but in that which He became for our sakes, not according to that which He was, who hath made us.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p57"></a>12. “O Lord, my God, be not far from me” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#012">Psa. 71.12</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p57.1"></a>). So it is, and the Lord is not far off at all. For, “The Lord is nigh unto them that have bruised the heart.” <a name="fr_3115"></a><a href="#fn_3115"><font size="1">3116</font></a>
  “My God, unto my help look Thou.” “Be they confounded and fail that engage <a name="fr_3116"></a><a href="#fn_3116"><font size="1">3117</font></a>
  my soul” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#013">Psa. 71.13</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p59.1"></a>). What hath he desired? “Be they confounded and fail.” Why hath he desired it? “That engage my soul”? What is, “That engage my soul”? Engaging as it were unto some quarrel. For they are said to be engaged that are challenged to quarrel. If then so it is, let us beware of men that engage our soul. What is, “That engage our soul”? First provoking us to withstand God, in order that in our evil things God may displease us. For  when art thou right, so that to thee the God of Israel may be good, good to men right in heart? <a name="fr_3117"></a><a href="#fn_3117"><font size="1">3118</font></a>
  When art thou right? Wilt thou hear? When in that good which thou doest, God is pleasing to thee; but in that evil which thou sufferest, God is not displeasing to thee. See ye what I have said, brethren, and be ye on your guard against men that engage your souls. For all men that deal with you in order to make you be wearied in sorrows and tribulations, have this aim, namely, that God may be displeasing to you in that which ye suffer, and there may go forth from your  mouth, “What is this? For what have I done?” Now then hast thou done nothing of evil, and art thou just, He unjust? A sinner I am, thou sayest, I confess, just I call not myself. But what, sinner, hast thou by any means done so much evil as he with whom it is well? As much as Gaiuseius? <a name="fr_3118"></a><a href="#fn_3118"><font size="1">3119</font></a>
  I know the evil doings of him, I know the iniquities of him, from which I, though a sinner, am very far; and yet I see him abounding in all good things, and I am suffering so great evil things. I do not then say, O God, “what have I done” to Thee, because I have done nothing at all of evil; but because I have not done so much as to deserve to suffer these things. Again, art thou just, He unjust? Wake up, wretched man, thy soul hath been engaged! I have not, he  saith, called myself just. What then sayest thou? A sinner I am, but I did not commit so great sins, as to deserve to suffer these things. Thou sayest not then to God, just I am, and Thou art unjust: but thou sayest, unjust I am, but Thou art more unjust. Behold thy soul hath been engaged, behold now thy soul wageth war. What? Against whom? Thy soul, against God; that which hath been made against Him by whom it was made. Even because thou art in being to cry out against Him,  thou art ungrateful. Return, then, to the confession of thy sickness, and beg the healing hand of the Physician. Think thou not they are happy who flourish for a time. Thou art being chastised, they are being spared: perchance for thee chastised and amended an inheritance is being kept in reserve.…Lastly, see what followeth, “Let them put on confusion and shame, that think evil things to me.” “Confusion and shame,” confusion because of a bad conscience, shame because of  modesty. Let this befall them, and they will be good.…</p>

What is this? “I will add to all Thy praise,” ought to move us. More perfect wilt thou make the praise of God? Is there anything to be superadded? If already that is all praise, wilt thou add anything? God was praised in all His good deeds, in every creature of His, in the whole establishment of all things, in the  government and regulation of ages, in the order of seasons, in the height of Heaven, in the fruitfulness of the regions of earth, in the encircling of the sea, in every excellency of the creature everywhere brought forth, in the sons of men themselves, in the giving of the Law, in delivering His people from the captivity of the Egyptians, and all the rest of His wonderful works: not yet He had been praised for having raised up flesh unto life eternal. Be there then this praise added by the  Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ: in order that here we may perceive His voice above all past praise: thus it is that we rightly understand this also.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p63"></a>14. “My mouth shall tell out Thy righteousness” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#015">Psa. 71.15</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p63.1"></a>): not mine. From thence I will add to all Thy praise: because even that I am righteous, if righteous I am, is Thy righteousness in me, not mine own: for Thou dost justify the ungodly. <a name="fr_3119"></a><a href="#fn_3119"><font size="1">3120</font></a>
  “All the day long Thy salvation.” What is, “Thy salvation”? Let no one assume to himself, that he saveth himself, “Of the Lord is Salvation.” <a name="fr_3120"></a><a href="#fn_3120"><font size="1">3121</font></a>
  Not any one by himself saveth himself, “Vain is mans salvation.” <a name="fr_3121"></a><a href="#fn_3121"><font size="1">3122</font></a>
  “All the day long Thy Salvation:” at all times. Something of adversity cometh, preach the Salvation of the Lord: something of prosperity cometh, preach the Salvation of the Lord. Do not preach in prosperity, and hold thy peace in adversity: otherwise there will not be that which hath been said, “all the day long.” For all the day long is day together with its own night. Do we when we say, for example, thirty days have gone by, mention the nights also;  do we not under the very term days include the nights also? In Genesis what was said? “The evening was made, and the morning was made, one day.” <a name="fr_3122"></a><a href="#fn_3122"><font size="1">3123</font></a>
  Therefore a whole day is the day together with its own night: for the night doth serve the day, not the day the night. Whatever thou doest in mortal flesh, ought to serve righteousness: whatever thou doest by the commandment of God, be it not done for the sake of the advantage of the flesh, lest day serve night. Therefore all the day long speak of the praise of God, to wit, in prosperity and in adversity; in prosperity, as though in the day time; in adversity, as  though in the night time: all the day long nevertheless speak of the praise of God, so that thou mayest not have sung to no purpose, “I will bless God at every time, alway the praise of Him is in my mouth.” <a name="fr_3123"></a><a href="#fn_3123"><font size="1">3124</font></a>
 …</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p69"></a>15. Therefore, he saith, “For I have not known tradings.” <a name="fr_3124"></a><a href="#fn_3124"><font size="1">3125</font></a>
  What are these tradings? Let traders hear and change their life; and if they have been such, be not such; let them not know what they have been, let them forget; lastly, let them not approve, not praise; let them disapprove, condemn, be changed, if trading is a sin. For on this account, O thou trader, because of a certain eagerness for getting, whenever thou shalt have suffered loss, thou wilt blaspheme; and there will not be in thee that which hath been spoken of,  “all the day long Thy praise.” But whenever for the price of the goods which thou art selling, thou not only liest, but even falsely swearest; how in thy mouth all the day long is there the praise of God? While, if thou art a Christian, even out of thy mouth the name of God is being blasphemed, so that men say, see what sort of men are Christians! Therefore if this man for this reason speaketh the praise of God all the day long, because he hath not known tradings; let Christians amend  themselves, let them not trade. But a trader saith to me, behold I bring indeed from a distant quarter merchandise unto these places, wherein there are not those things which I have brought, by which means I may gain a living: I ask but as reward for my labour, that I may sell dearer than I have bought: for whence can I live, when it hath been written, “the worker is worthy of his reward”? <a name="fr_3125"></a><a href="#fn_3125"><font size="1">3126</font></a>
  But he is treating of lying, of false swearing. This is the fault of me, not of trading: for I should not, if I would, be unable to do without this fault. I then, the merchant, do not shift mine own fault to trading: but if I lie, it is I that lie, not the trade. For I might say, for so much I bought, but for so much I will sell; if thou pleasest, buy. For the buyer hearing this truth would not be offended, and not a whit less all men would resort to me:  because they would love truth more than gain. Of this then, he saith, admonish me, that I lie not, that I forswear not; not to relinquish business whereby I maintain myself. For to what dost thou put me when thou puttest me away from this? Perchance to some craft? I will be a shoemaker, I will make shoes for men. Are not they too liars? are not they too false-swearers? Do they not, when they have contracted to make shoes for one man, when they have received money from another man,  give up that which they were making, and undertake to make for another, and deceive him for whom they have promised to make speedily? Do they not often say, to-day I am about it, to-day Ill get <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_321"></a>them done? Secondly, in the very sewing do they not commit as many frauds? These are their doings and these are their sayings: but they are themselves evil, not the calling which they profess. All evil artificers, then, not fearing God, either for gain, or for fear of  loss or want, do lie, do forswear themselves; there is no continual praise of God in them. How then dost thou withdraw me from trading? Wouldest thou that I be a farmer, and murmur against God thundering, so that, fearing hail, I consult a wizard, in order to learn what to do to protect me against the weather; so that I desire famine for the poor, in order that I may be able to sell what I have kept in store? Unto this dost thou bring me? But good farmers, thou sayest, do not such  things. Nor do good traders do those things. But why, even to have sons is an evil thing, for when their head is in pain, evil and unbelieving mothers seek for impious charms and incantations? These are the sins of men, not of things. A trader might thus speak to me—Look then, O Bishop, how thou understand the tradings which thou hast read in the Psalm: lest perchance thou understand not, and yet forbid me trading. Admonish me then how I should live; if well, it shall be well with  me: one thing however I know, that if I shall have been evil, it is not trading that maketh me so, but my iniquity. Whenever truth is spoken, there is nothing to be said against it.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p72"></a>16. Let us inquire then what he hath called tradings, which indeed he that hath not known, all the day long doth praise God. Trading <a name="fr_3126"></a><a href="#fn_3126"><font size="1">3127</font></a>
  even in the Greek language is derived from action, and in the Latin from want of inaction: but whether it be from action or want of inaction, let us examine what it is. For they that are active traders, rely as it were upon their own action, they praise their works, they attain not to the grace of God. Therefore traders are opposed to that grace which this Psalm doth commend. For it doth commend that grace, in order that no one may boast of his own works. Because in  a certain place is said, “Physicians shall not raise to life,” <a name="fr_3127"></a><a href="#fn_3127"><font size="1">3128</font></a>
  ought men to abandon medicine? But what is this? Under this name are understood proud men, promising salvation to men, whereas “of the Lord is Salvation.” <a name="fr_3128"></a><a href="#fn_3128"><font size="1">3129</font></a>
 …With reason the Lord drave from the Temple them to whom He said, “It is written, My House shall be called the House of prayer, but ye have made it a house of trading;” <a name="fr_3129"></a><a href="#fn_3129"><font size="1">3130</font></a>
  that is, boasting of your works, seeking no inaction, nor hearing the Scripture speaking against your unrest and trading, “be ye still, and see that I am the Lord.” <a name="fr_3130"></a><a href="#fn_3130"><font size="1">3131</font></a>
 …</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p78"></a>17. But there is in some copies, “For I have not known literature.” Where some books have “trading,” there others “literature:” how they may accord is a hard matter to find out; and yet the discrepancy of interpreters perchance showeth the meaning, introduceth no error. Let us inquire then how to understand literature also, lest we offend grammarians in the same way as we did traders a little before: because a grammarian too may live honourably  in his calling, and neither forswear nor lie. Let us examine then the literature which he hath not known, in whose mouth all the day long is the praise of God. There is a sort of literature of the Jews: for to them let us refer this; there we shall find what hath been said: just as when we were inquiring about traders, on the score of actions and works, we found that to be called detestable trading, which the Apostle hath branded, saying, “For being ignorant of Gods righteousness,  and willing to establish their own, to the righteousness of God they were not made subject.” <a name="fr_3131"></a><a href="#fn_3131"><font size="1">3132</font></a>
 …Just as then we found out the former charge against traders, that is men boasting of action, exalting themselves because of business which admitteth no inaction, unquiet men rather than good workmen; because good workmen are those in whom God worketh; so also we find a sort of literature among the Jews.…Moses wrote five books: but in the five porches encircling the pool, <a name="fr_3132"></a><a href="#fn_3132"><font size="1">3133</font></a>
  sick men were lying, but they could not be healed. See how the letter remained, convicting the guilty, not saving the unrighteous. For in those five porches, a figure of the five books, sick men were given over rather than made whole. What then in that place did make whole a sick man? The moving of the water. When that pool was moved there went down a sick man, and there was made whole one, one <a name="fr_3133"></a><a href="#fn_3133"><font size="1">3134</font></a>
  because of unity: whatsoever other man went down unto that same moving was not made whole. How then was there commended the unity of the Body crying from the ends of the earth? Another man was not healed, except again the pool were moved. The moving of the pool then did signify the perturbation of the people of the Jews when the Lord Jesus Christ came. For at the coming of an Angel the water in the pool was perceived to be moved. The water then encircled with five  porches was the Jewish nation encircled by the Law. And in the porches the sick lay, and in the water alone when troubled and moved they were healed. The Lord came, troubled was the water; He was crucified, may He come down in order that the sick man may be made whole. What is, may He come down? May He humble Himself. Therefore whosoever ye be that <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_322"></a>love the letter without grace, in the porches ye will remain, sick ye will be, lying ill, not growing  well.…For the same figure also it is that Eliseus at first sent a staff by his servant to raise up the dead child. There had died the son of a widow his hostess; it was reported to him, to his servant he gave his staff: go thou, he saith, lay it on the dead child. Did the prophet not know what he was doing? The servant went before, he laid the staff upon the dead, the dead arose not. “For if there had been given a law which could have made alive, surely out of the law there had  been righteousness.”  <a name="fr_3134"></a><a href="#fn_3134"><font size="1">3135</font></a>
  The law sent by the servant made not alive: and yet he sent his staff by the servant, who himself afterwards followed, and made alive. <a name="fr_3135"></a><a href="#fn_3135"><font size="1">3136</font></a>
  For when that infant arose not, Eliseus came himself, now bearing the type of the Lord, who had sent before his servant with the staff, as though with the Law: he came to the child that was lying dead, he laid his limbs upon it. The one was an infant, the other a grown man: he contracted and shortened in a manner the size of his full growth, in order that he might fit the dead child. The dead then arose, when he being alive adapted himself to the dead: and the  Master did that which the staff did not; and grace did that which the letter did not. They then that have remained in the staff, glory in the letter; and therefore are not made alive. But I will to glory concerning Thy grace.…In that same grace I glorying “literature have not known:” that is, men on the letter relying, and from grace recoiling, with whole heart I have rejected.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p84"></a>18. With reason there followeth, “I will enter into the power of the Lord:” not mine own, but the Lords. For they gloried in their own power of the letter, therefore grace joined to the letter they knew not.…But because “the letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh alive:” <a name="fr_3136"></a><a href="#fn_3136"><font size="1">3137</font></a>
  “I have not known literature, and I will enter into the power of the Lord.” Therefore this verse following doth strengthen and perfect the sense, so as to fix it in the hearts of men, and not suffer any other interpretation to steal in from any quarter. “O Lord, I will be mindful of Thy righteousness alone” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016">Psa. 71.16</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p85.2"></a>). Ah! “alone.” Why hath he added “alone,” I ask you? It would suffice to say, “I will be mindful of Thy righteousness.” “alone,” he saith, entirely: there of mine own I think not. “For what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if also thou hast received, why dost thou glory as if thou hast not received.” <a name="fr_3137"></a><a href="#fn_3137"><font size="1">3138</font></a>
  Thy righteousness alone doth deliver me, what is mine own alone is nought but sins. May I not glory then of my own strength, may I not remain in the letter; may I reject “literature,” that is, men glorying of the letter, and on their own strength perversely, like men frantic, relying: may I reject such men, may I enter into the power of the Lord, so that when I am weak, then I may be mighty; in order that Thou in me mayest be mighty, for, “I will be mindful of Thy  righteousness alone.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p87"></a>19. “O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#017">Psa. 71.17</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p87.1"></a>). What hast thou taught me? That of Thy righteousness alone I ought to be mindful. For reviewing my past life, I see what was owing to me, and what I have received instead of that which was owing to me. There was owing punishment, there hath been paid grace: there was owing hell, there hath been given life eternal. “O God, Thou hast taught me from my  youth.” From the very beginning of my faith, wherewith Thou hast renewed me, Thou didst teach me that nothing had preceded in me, whence I might say that there was owing to me what Thou hast given. For who is turned to God save from iniquity? Who is redeemed save from captivity? But who can say that unjust was his captivity, when he forsook his Captain and fell off to the deserter? God is for our Captain, <a name="fr_3138"></a><a href="#fn_3138"><font size="1">3139</font></a>
  the devil a deserter: the Captain gave a commandment, the deserter suggested guile: <a name="fr_3139"></a><a href="#fn_3139"><font size="1">3140</font></a>
  where were thine ears between precept and deceit? was the devil better than God? Better he that revolted <a name="fr_3140"></a><a href="#fn_3140"><font size="1">3141</font></a>
  than He that made thee? Thou didst believe what the devil promised, and didst find what God threatened. Now then out of captivity being delivered, still however in hope, not yet in substance, walking by faith, not yet by sight, “O God,” he saith, “Thou hast taught me from my youth.” From the time that I have been turned to Thee, <a name="fr_3141"></a><a href="#fn_3141"><font size="1">3142</font></a>
  renewed by Thee who had been made by Thee, re-created who had been created, re-formed who had been formed: from the time that I have been converted, I have learned that no merits of mine have preceded, but that Thy grace hath come to me <i>gratis,</i> in order that I might be mindful of Thy righteousness alone.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p92"></a>20. What next after youth? For, “Thou hast taught me,” he saith, “from my youth:” what after youth? For in that same first conversion of thine thou didst learn, how before conversion thou wast not just, but iniquity preceded, in order that iniquity being banished, there might succeed love: and having been renewed into a new man, only in hope, not yet in substance, thou didst learn how nothing of thy good had preceded, and by the grace of God thou wast  converted to God: now perchance since the time that thou hast been converted wilt thou have anything of thine own, and on thy own <a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 323</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_323"></a>strength oughtest thou to rely? Just as men are wont to say, now leave me, it was necessary for thee to show me the way; it is sufficient, I will walk in the way. And he that hath shown thee the way, “wilt thou not that I conduct thee to the place?” But thou, if thou art conceited, “let me alone, it is enough, I will walk in the  way.” Thou art left, and through thy weakness again thou wilt lose the way. Good were it for thee that He should have conducted thee, who first put thee in the way. But unless He too lead thee, again also thou wilt stray: say to Him then, “Conduct me, O Lord, in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth.” <a name="fr_3142"></a><a href="#fn_3142"><font size="1">3143</font></a>
  But thy having entered on the way, is youth, the very renewal and beginning of the faith. For before thou wast walking through thy own ways a vagabond; straying through woody places, through rough places, torn in all thy limbs, thou wast seeking a home, that is, a sort of settlement of thy spirit, where thou mightest say, it is well; and being in security mightest say it, at rest from every uneasiness, from every trial, in a word from every captivity; and thou didst not  find. What shall I say? Came there to thee one to show thee the way? There came to thee the Way itself, and thou wast set therein by no merits of thine preceding, for evidently thou wast straying. What, since the time that thou hast set foot therein dost thou now direct thyself? Doth He that hath taught thee the way now leave thee? No, he saith: “Thou hast taught me from my youth; and even until now I will tell forth Thy wonderful works.” For a wonderful thing is that which  still Thou doest; namely, that Thou dost direct me, who in the way hast put me: and these are Thy wonderful works. What dost thou think to be the wonderful works of God? What is more wonderful among Gods wonderful works, than the raising the dead? But am I by any means dead, thou sayest? Unless dead thou hadst been, there would not have been said to thee, “Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall enlighten thee.” <a name="fr_3143"></a><a href="#fn_3143"><font size="1">3144</font></a>
  Dead are all unbelievers, all unrighteous men; in body they live, but in heart they are extinct. But he that raiseth a man dead according to the body, doth bring him back to see this light and to breathe this air: but he that raiseth is not himself light and air to him; he beginneth to see, as he saw before. A soul is not so resuscitated. For a soul is resuscitated by God; though even a body is resuscitated by God: but God, when He doth resuscitate a body, to the  world doth bring it back: when He doth resuscitate a soul, to Himself He bringeth it back. If the air of this world be withdrawn, there dieth body: if God be withdrawn, there dieth soul. When then God doth resuscitate a soul, unless there be with her He that hath resuscitated, she being resuscitated liveth not. For He doth not resuscitate, and then leave her to live to herself: in the same manner as Lazarus, when he was resuscitated after being four days dead, was resuscitated by  the Lords corporal presence.…The Lord withdrew from that same city or from that spot, did Lazarus cease to live? Not so is the soul resuscitated: God doth resuscitate her, she dieth if God shall have withdrawn. For I will speak boldly, brethren, but yet the truth. Two lives there are, one of the body, another of the soul: as the life of the body is the soul, so the life of the soul is God: in like manner as, if the soul forsake, the body dieth: so the soul dieth, if God  forsake. This then is His grace, namely, that He resuscitate and be with us. Because then He doth resuscitate us from our past death, and doth renew in a manner our life, we say to Him, “O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth.” But because He doth not withdraw from those whom He resuscitateth, lest when He shall have withdrawn from them they die, we say to Him, “and even until now I will tell forth Thy wonderful works:” because while Thou art with me I live, and of my soul  Thou art the life, which will die if she be left to herself. Therefore while my life is present, that is, my God, “even until now,” what next?</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p95"></a>21. “And even unto oldness <a name="fr_3144"></a><a href="#fn_3144"><font size="1">3145</font></a>
  and old age” <a name="fr_3145"></a><a href="#fn_3145"><font size="1">3146</font></a>
  (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018">Psa. 71.18</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p97.1"></a>). These are two terms for old age, and are distinguished by the Greeks. For the gravity succeeding youth hath another name among the Greeks, and after that same gravity the last age coming on hath another name; for <span class="Greek"><a name="ii.LXXI-p97.2"></a>πρεσβύτης</span> signifieth grave, and <span class="Greek"><a name="ii.LXXI-p97.3"></a>γ™ρων</span> old. But because in the Latin language the distinction of these two terms holdeth not, both words implying old age are inserted, oldness  and old age: but ye know them to be two ages. “Thou hast taught me Thy grace from my youth; and even until now;” after my youth, “I will tell forth Thy wonderful works,” because Thou art with me in order that I may not die, who hast come in order that I may rise: “and even unto oldness and old age,” that is, even unto my last breath, unless with me Thou shalt have been, there will not be any merit of mine; may Thy grace alway remain with me. Even one man would say this,  thou, he, I; but because this voice is that of a certain great Man, that is, of the Unity itself, for it is the voice of the Church; let us investigate the youth of the Church. When Christ came, He was crucified, dead, rose again, called the Gentiles, they began to be converted, became Martyrs strong in Christ, there <a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_324"></a>was shed faithful blood, there arose a harvest for the Church: this is Her youth. But seasons advancing let the Church confess, let Her say, “Even until  now I will tell forth Thy wonderful works.” Not only in youth, when Paul, when Peter, when the first Apostles told: even in advancing age I myself, that is, Thy Unity, Thy members, Thy Body, “will tell forth Thy marvellous works.” What then? “And even unto oldness and old age,” I will tell forth Thy wonderful works: even until the end of the world here shall be the Church. For if She were not to be here even unto the end of the world; to whom did the Lord say, “Behold, I  am with you always, even unto the consummation of the world”? Why was it necessary that these things should be spoken in the Scriptures? Because there were to be enemies of the Christian Faith who would say, “for a short time are the Christians, hereafter they shall perish, and there shall come back idols, there shall come back that which was before. How long shall be the Christians?” <a name="fr_3146"></a><a href="#fn_3146"><font size="1">3147</font></a>
  “Even unto oldness and old age:” that is, even unto the end of the world. When thou, miserable unbeliever, dost expect Christians to pass away, thou art passing away thyself without Christians: and Christians even unto the end of the world shall endure; and as for thee with thine unbelief when thou shalt have ended thy short life, with what face wilt thou come forth to the Judge, whom while thou wast living thou didst blaspheme? Therefore “from my youth, and  even until now, and even unto oldness and old age, O Lord, forsake not me.” It will not be, as mine enemies say, even for a time. “Forsake not me, until I tell forth Thine arm to every generation that is yet to come.” And the Arm of the Lord hath been revealed to whom? <a name="fr_3147"></a><a href="#fn_3147"><font size="1">3148</font></a>
  The Arm of the Lord is Christ. Do not Thou then forsake me: let not them rejoice that say, “only for a set time the Christians are.” May there be persons to tell forth Thine arm. To whom? “To every generation that is yet to come.” If then it be to every generation that is yet to come, it will be even unto the end of the world: for when the world is ended, no longer any generation will come on.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p100"></a>22. “Thy power and Thy righteousness” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019">Psa. 71.19</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p100.1"></a>). That is, that I may tell forth to every generation that is yet to come, Thine arm. And what hath Thine arm effected? This then let me tell forth, that same grace to every generation succeeding: let me say to every man that is to be born, nothing thou art by thyself, on God call thou, thine own are sins, merits are Gods: <a name="fr_3148"></a><a href="#fn_3148"><font size="1">3149</font></a>
  punishment to thee is owing, and when reward shall have come, His own gifts He will crown, not thy merits. Let me say to every generation that is to come, out of captivity thou hast come, unto Adam thou didst belong. Let me say this to every generation that is to come, that there is no strength of mine, no righteousness of mine; but “Thy strength and Thy righteousness, O God, even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.” “Thy power and Thy  righteousness,” as far as what? even unto flesh and blood? Nay, “even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.” For the high places are the heavens, in the high places are the Angels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers: to Thee they owe it that they are; to Thee they owe it that they live, to Thee they owe it that righteously they live, to Thee they owe it that blessedly they live. “Thy power and Thy righteousness,” as far as what? “Even unto the most  high mighty works which Thou hast made.” Think not that man alone belongeth to the grace of God. What was Angel before he was made? What is Angel, if He forsake him who hath created? Therefore “Thy power and Thy justice even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p102"></a>23. And man exalteth himself: and in order that he may belong to the first captivity, he heareth the serpent suggesting, “Taste, and ye shall be as Gods.” <a name="fr_3149"></a><a href="#fn_3149"><font size="1">3150</font></a>
  Men as Gods? “O God, who is like unto Thee?” Not any in the pit, not in Hell, not in earth, not in Heaven, for all things Thou hast made. Why doth the work strive with the Maker? “O God, who is like unto Thee?” But as for me, saith miserable Adam, and Adam is <a name="fr_3150"></a><a href="#fn_3150"><font size="1">3151</font></a>
  every man, while I perversely will to be like unto Thee, behold what I have become, so that from captivity to Thee I cry out: I with whom it was well under a good king, have been made captive under my seducer; and cry out to Thee, because I have fallen from Thee. And whence have I fallen from Thee? While I perversely seek to be like unto Thee.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p105"></a>24. Ill straying, ill presuming, doomed to die by withdrawing from the path <a name="fr_3151"></a><a href="#fn_3151"><font size="1">3152</font></a>
  of righteousness: behold he breaketh the commandment, he hath shaken off from his neck the yoke of discipline, uplifted with high spirit he hath broken in sunder the reins of guidance: where is he now? Truly captive he crieth, “O Lord, who is like unto Thee?” I perversely willed to be like unto Thee, and I have been made like unto a beast! Under Thy dominion, under Thy commandment, I was indeed like: “But a man in honour set hath not perceived, he hath been  compared to beasts without sense, <a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_325"></a>and hath been made like unto them.” <a name="fr_3152"></a><a href="#fn_3152"><font size="1">3153</font></a>
  Now out of the likeness of beasts cry though late and say, “O God, who is like unto Thee?”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p108"></a>25. “How great troubles hast Thou shown to me, many and evil!” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020">Psa. 71.20</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p108.1"></a>). Deservedly, proud servant. For thou hast willed perversely to be like thy God, who hadst been made after the image of thy Lord. <a name="fr_3153"></a><a href="#fn_3153"><font size="1">3154</font></a>
  Wouldest thou have it to be well with thee, when withdrawing from that good? Truly God saith to thee, if thou withdrawest from Me, and it is well with thee, I am not thy good. Again, if He is good, and in the highest degree good, and of Himself to Himself good, and by no foreign good thing good, and is Himself our chief good; by withdrawing from Him, what wilt thou be but evil? Also if He is Himself our blessedness, what will there be to one withdrawing from Him,  except misery? Return thou then after misery, and say, “O Lord, who is like unto Thee? How great troubles hast Thou shown to me, many and evil!”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p110"></a>26. But this was discipline; admonition, not desertion. Lastly, giving thanks, he saith what? “And being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” But when before? What is this “again”? Thou hast fallen from a high place, O man, disobedient slave, O thou proud against thy Lord, thou hast fallen. There hast come to pass in thee, “every one that exalteth himself shall be  humbled:” may there come to pass in thee, “every one that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” <a name="fr_3154"></a><a href="#fn_3154"><font size="1">3155</font></a>
  Return thou from the deep. I return, he saith, I return, I acknowledge; “O God, who is like unto Thee? How great troubles hast Thou shown to me, many and evil! and being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” “We perceive,” I hear. Thou hast brought us back from the bottomless places of the earth, hast brought us back from the depth and drowning of sin. But why “again”? When had  it already been done? Let us go on, if perchance the latter parts of the Psalm itself do not explain to us the thing which here we do not yet perceive, namely, why he hath said “again.” Therefore let us hear: “How great troubles Thou hast shown to me, many and evil! And being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” What then? “Thou hast multiplied Thy righteousness, and being turned Thou hast comforted  me, and from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou hast brought me back” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#021">Psa. 71.21</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p111.2"></a>). Behold a second “again”! If we labour to unravel this “again” when written once, who will be able to unravel it when doubled? Now “again” itself is a redoubling, and once more there is written “again.” May He be with us from whom is grace, may there be with us the arm also which we are telling forth to every generation that  is to come: may He be with us Himself, and as with the key of His Cross open to us the mystery that is locked up. For it was not to no purpose that when He was crucified the veil of the temple was rent in the midst, but to show that through His Passion the secret things of all mysteries were opened. <a name="fr_3155"></a><a href="#fn_3155"><font size="1">3156</font></a>
  May He then Himself be with men passing over unto Him, be the veil taken away: <a name="fr_3156"></a><a href="#fn_3156"><font size="1">3157</font></a>
  may our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ tell us why such a voice of the Prophet hath been sent before, “Thou hast shown to me troubles many and evil: and being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” Behold this is the first “again” which hath been written. Let us see what this is, and we shall see why there is a second “again.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p114"></a>27. …Therein Christ died, wherein thou art to die: and therein Christ rose again, wherein thou art to rise again. By His example He taught thee what thou shouldest not fear, for what thou shouldest hope. Thou didst fear death, He died: thou didst despair of rising again, He rose again. But thou sayest to me, He rose again, do I by any means rise again? But He rose again in that which for thee He received of thee. Therefore thy nature in Him hath  preceded thee; and that which was taken of thee, hath gone up before thee: therein therefore thou also hast ascended. Therefore He ascended first, and we in Him: because that flesh is of the human race.…Behold one “again.” Hear of its being fulfilled from the Apostle: “If then ye have risen with Christ, the things which are above seek ye, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God; the things which are above mind ye, not the things which are upon the earth.”   <a name="fr_3157"></a><a href="#fn_3157"><font size="1">3158</font></a>
  He then hath gone before: already we also have risen again, but still in hope. Hear the Apostle Paul saying this same thing: “Even we ourselves groan in ourselves, looking for the adoption, the redemption of our body.” What is it then that Christ hath granted to thee? Hear that which followeth: “For by hope we are saved: but hope which is seen is not hope. For that which a man seeth, why doth he hope for? But if that which we see not we hope for,  through patience we wait for it.” We have been brought back therefore again from the bottomless places in hope. Why again? Because already Christ had gone before. But because we shall rise again in substance, for now in hope we are living, now after faith we are <a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXI-Page_326"></a>walking; we have been brought back from the bottomless places of the earth, by believing in Him who before us hath risen again from the bottomless place of the earth.…Thou hast heard one  “again,” thou hast heard the other: “again;” one “again” because of Christ going before; and the other, yet however in hope, and a thing which remaineth to be in substance. “Thou hast multiplied Thy righteousness,” <a name="fr_3158"></a><a href="#fn_3158"><font size="1">3159</font></a>
  already in me believing, already in those that first have risen again in hope.…“Thou hast multiplied Thy righteousness, and being turned Thou hast comforted me:” and because of the body to rise again at the end, even from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p117"></a>28. “For I will confess to Thee in the vessels of a Psalm Thy truth” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#022">Psa. 71.22</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p117.1"></a>). The vessels of a Psalm are a Psaltery. But what is a Psaltery? An instrument of wood and strings. <a name="fr_3159"></a><a href="#fn_3159"><font size="1">3160</font></a>
  What doth it signify? There is some difference between it and a harp:…there seemeth to be signified by the Psaltery the Spirit, by the harp the flesh. And because he had spoken of two bringings back of ours from the bottomless places of the earth, one after the Spirit in hope, the other after the body in substance; hear thou of these two: “For I will confess to Thee in the vessels of a Psalm Thy truth.” This after the Spirit: concerning the body what? “I  will psalm to Thee on a harp, Holy One of Israel.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXI-p119"></a>29. Again hear this because of that same “again” and “again.” “My lips shall exult when I shall psalm to Thee” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#023">Psa. 71.23</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p119.1"></a>). Because lips are wont to be spoken of both belonging to the inner and to the outward man, it is uncertain in what sense lips have been used: there followeth therefore, “And my soul which Thou hast redeemed.” Therefore regarding the inward lips having been saved in hope, brought back from the bottomless places of the earth in faith and love, still however waiting for the redemption of our body, <a name="fr_3160"></a><a href="#fn_3160"><font size="1">3161</font></a>
  we say what? Already he hath said, “And my soul which Thou hast redeemed.” But lest thou shouldest think the soul alone redeemed, wherein now thou hast heard one “again,” “but still,” he saith; why still? “but still my tongue also:” therefore now the tongue of the body: “all day long shall meditate of Thy righteousness” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#024">Psa. 71.24</a><a name="ii.LXXI-p120.2"></a>): that is, in eternity without end. But when shall this be?  Hereafter at the end of the world, at the resurrection of the body and the changing into the Angelic state. Whence is it proved that this is spoken of the end, “but still my tongue also all day long shall meditate of Thy righteousness”? “When they shall have been confounded and shall have blushed, that seek evil things for me.” When shall they be confounded, when shall they blush, save at the end of the world? For in two ways they shall be confounded, either when they shall  believe in Christ, or when Christ shall have come. For so long as the Church is here, so long as grain groaneth amid chaff, so long as wheat groaneth amid tares, <a name="fr_3161"></a><a href="#fn_3161"><font size="1">3162</font></a>
  so long as vessels of mercy groan amid vessels of wrath made for dishonour, <a name="fr_3162"></a><a href="#fn_3162"><font size="1">3163</font></a>
  so long as lily groaneth amid thorns, there will not be wanting enemies to say, “When shall he die, and his name perish?” <a name="fr_3163"></a><a href="#fn_3163"><font size="1">3164</font></a>
  “Behold there shall come the time when Christians shall be ended and shall be no more: as they began at a set time, so even unto a particular time they shall be.” But while they are saying these things and without end <a name="fr_3164"></a><a href="#fn_3164"><font size="1">3165</font></a>
  are dying, and while the Church is continuing preaching the Arm of the Lord <a name="fr_3165"></a><a href="#fn_3165"><font size="1">3166</font></a>
  to every generation that is to come; there shall come Himself also at last in His glory, <a name="fr_3166"></a><a href="#fn_3166"><font size="1">3167</font></a>
  there shall rise again all the dead, each with his cause: there shall be severed good men to the right hand, but evil men to the left, and they shall be confounded that did insult, they shall blush that did mock: and so my tongue after resurrection shall meditate of Thy righteousness, all day long of Thy praise, “when they shall have been confounded and shall have blushed, that seek evil things for me.”</p>
