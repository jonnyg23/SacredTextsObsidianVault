 <p><a name="v.vii.v-p1"></a><a name="v.vii.v-p1.1"></a><a name="v.vii.v-p1.2"></a><a name="v.vii.v-p1.3"></a>Some ignorantly <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_1002"><font size="1">1003</font></a>
  deny Him, or rather have been denied by Him, being the advocates of death rather than of the truth. These persons neither have the prophets persuaded, nor the law of Moses, nor the Gospel even to this day, nor the sufferings we have individually endured. For they think also the same thing regarding us. <a name="fr_1003"></a><a href="#fn_1003"><font size="1">1004</font></a>
  For what does any one profit me, if he commends me, but blasphemes my Lord, not confessing that He was [truly] possessed of a body? <a name="fr_1004"></a><a href="#fn_1004"><font size="1">1005</font></a>
  But he who does not acknowledge this, has in fact altogether denied Him, being enveloped in death. <a name="fr_1005"></a><a href="#fn_1005"><font size="1">1006</font></a>
  I have not, however, thought good to write the names of such persons, inasmuch as they are unbelievers. Yea, far be it from me to make any mention of them, until they repent and return to [a true belief in] Christs passion, which is our resurrection.</p>
