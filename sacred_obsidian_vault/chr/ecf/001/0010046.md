 <p><a name="ii.ii.xli-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xli-p1.1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xli-p1.2"></a><a name="ii.ii.xli-p1.3"></a>Let every one of you, brethren, give thanks to God in his own order, living in all good conscience, with becoming gravity, and not going beyond the rule of the ministry prescribed to him. Not in every place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only. And even there they are not offered in any place, but only at the altar before the temple, that which is offered being first carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already mentioned. Those, therefore, who do anything beyond that which is agreeable to His will, are punished with death. Ye see, <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">177</font></a>
  brethren, that the greater the knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us, the greater also is the danger to which we are exposed.</p>
