 <p><a name="viii.ii.xiii-p1"></a>What sober-minded man, then, will not acknowledge that we are not atheists, worshipping as we do the Maker of this universe, and declaring, as we have been taught, that He has no need of streams of blood and libations and incense; whom we praise to the utmost of our power by the exercise of prayer and thanksgiving for all things wherewith we are supplied, as we have been taught that the only honour that is worthy of Him is not to consume by fire what He has brought into being for our sustenance, but to use it for ourselves and those who need, and with gratitude to Him to offer thanks by invocations and hymns <a name="fr_1781"></a><a href="#fn_1781"><font size="1">1782</font></a>
  for our creation, and for all the means of health, and for the various qualities of the different kinds of things, and for the changes of the seasons; and to present before Him petitions for our existing again in incorruption through faith in Him. <a name="viii.ii.xiii-p2.5"></a><a name="viii.ii.xiii-p2.6"></a>Our teacher of these things is Jesus Christ, who also was born for this purpose, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judæa, in the times of Tiberius Cæsar; and that we reasonably worship Him, having learned that He is the Son of the true  <a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a> <a name="viii.ii.xiii-Page_167"></a>  God Himself, and holding Him in the second place, and the prophetic Spirit in the third, we will prove. <a name="viii.ii.xiii-p2.7"></a>For they proclaim our madness to consist in this, that we give to a crucified man a place second to the unchangeable and eternal God, the Creator of all; for they do not discern the mystery that is herein, to which, as we make it plain to you, we pray you to give heed.</p>
