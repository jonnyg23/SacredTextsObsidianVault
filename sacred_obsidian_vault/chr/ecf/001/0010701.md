 <p> <a name="ix.ii.v"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.ii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.—Account given by the heretics of the formation of Achamoth; origin of the visible world from her disturbances.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.v-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.ii.v-p1.1"></a>The following are the transactions which they narrate as having occurred outside of the Pleroma: <a name="ix.ii.v-p1.2"></a>The enthymesis of that Sophia who dwells above, which they also term Achamoth, <a name="fr_2710"></a><a href="#fn_2710"><font size="1">2711</font></a>
  being removed from the Pleroma, together with her passion, they relate to have, as a matter of course, become violently excited in those places of darkness and vacuity [to which she had been banished]. For she was excluded from light <a name="fr_2711"></a><a href="#fn_2711"><font size="1">2712</font></a>
  and the Pleroma, and was without form or figure, like an untimely birth, because she had received nothing <a name="fr_2712"></a><a href="#fn_2712"><font size="1">2713</font></a>
  [from a male parent]. But the Christ dwelling on high took pity upon her; and having extended himself through and beyond Stauros, <a name="fr_2713"></a><a href="#fn_2713"><font size="1">2714</font></a>
  he imparted a figure to her, but merely as respected substance, and not so as to convey intelligence. <a name="fr_2714"></a><a href="#fn_2714"><font size="1">2715</font></a>
  Having effected this, he withdrew his influence, and returned, leaving Achamoth to herself, in order that she, becoming sensible of her suffering as being severed from the Pleroma, might be influenced by the desire of better things, while she possessed in the meantime a kind of odour of immortality left in her by Christ and the Holy Spirit. Wherefore also she is called by two names—Sophia after her father (for Sophia is spoken of as being her father), and Holy Spirit from that Spirit who is along with Christ. Having then obtained a form, along with intelligence, and being immediately deserted by that Logos who had been invisibly present with her—that is, by Christ —she strained herself to discover that light which had forsaken her, but could not  <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a> <a name="ix.ii.v-Page_321"></a>  effect her purpose, inasmuch as she was prevented by Horos. <a name="ix.ii.v-p6.1"></a>And as Horos thus obstructed her further progress, he exclaimed, <span class="upper"><a name="ix.ii.v-p6.2"></a>Iao</span>, <a name="fr_2715"></a><a href="#fn_2715"><font size="1">2716</font></a>
  whence, they say, this name <i>Iao</i> derived its origin. And when she could not pass by Horos on account of that passion in which she had been involved, and because she alone had been left without, she then resigned herself to every sort of that manifold and varied state of passion to which she was subject; and thus she suffered grief on the one hand because she had not obtained the object of her desire, and fear on the other hand, lest life itself should fail her, as light had already done, while, in addition, she was in the greatest perplexity. All these feelings were associated with ignorance. And this ignorance of hers was not like that of her mother, the first Sophia, an Æon, due to degeneracy by means of passion, but to an [innate] opposition [of nature to knowledge]. <a name="fr_2716"></a><a href="#fn_2716"><font size="1">2717</font></a>
  Moreover, another kind of passion fell upon her (Achamoth), namely, that of desiring to return to him who gave her life.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.v-p9"></a>2. <a name="ix.ii.v-p9.1"></a>This collection [of passions] they declare was the substance of the matter from which this world was formed. For from [her desire of] returning [to him who gave her life], every soul belonging to this world, and that of the Demiurge <a name="fr_2717"></a><a href="#fn_2717"><font size="1">2718</font></a>
  himself, derived its origin. All other things owed their beginning to her terror and sorrow. For from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed; from her smile all that is lucent; and from her grief and perplexity all the corporeal elements of the world. For at one time, as they affirm, she would weep and lament on account of being left alone in the midst of darkness and vacuity; while, at another time, reflecting on the light which had forsaken her, she would be filled with joy, and laugh; then, again, she would be struck with terror; or, at other times, would sink into consternation and bewilderment.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.v-p11"></a>3. Now what follows from all this? No light tragedy comes out of it, as the fancy of every man among them pompously explains, one in one way, and another in another, from what kind of passion and from what element being derived its origin. They have good reason, as seems to me, why they should not feel inclined to teach these things to all in public, but only to such as are able to pay a high price for an acquaintance with such profound mysteries. For these doctrines are not at all similar to those of which our Lord said, “Freely ye have received, freely give.” <a name="fr_2718"></a><a href="#fn_2718"><font size="1">2719</font></a>
  They are, on the contrary, abstruse, and portentous, and profound mysteries, to be got at only with great labour by such as are in love with falsehood. For who would not expend all that he possessed, if only he might learn in return, that from the tears of the enthymesis of the Æon involved in passion, seas, and fountains, and rivers, and every liquid substance derived its origin; that light burst forth from her smile; and that from her perplexity and consternation the corporeal elements of the world had their formation?</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.v-p13"></a>4. I feel somewhat inclined myself to contribute a few hints towards the development of their system. For when I perceive that waters are in part fresh, such as fountains, rivers, showers, and so on, and in part salt; such as those in the sea, I reflect with myself that all such waters cannot be derived from her tears, inasmuch as these are of a saline quality only. It is clear, therefore, that the waters which are salt are alone those which are derived from her tears. But it is probable that she, in her intense agony and perplexity, was covered with perspiration. And hence, following out their notion, we may conceive that fountains and rivers, and all the fresh water in the world, are due to this source. For it is difficult, since we know that all tears are of the same quality, to believe that waters both salt and fresh proceeded from them. The more plausible supposition is, that some are from her tears, and some from her perspiration. And since there are also in the world certain waters which are hot and acrid in their nature, thou must be left to guess their origin, how and whence. Such are some of the results of their hypothesis.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.v-p14"></a>5. They go on to state that, when the mother Achamoth had passed through all sorts of passion, and had with difficulty escaped from them, she turned herself to supplicate the light which had forsaken her, that is, Christ. He, however, having returned to the Pleroma, and being probably unwilling again to descend from it, sent forth to her the Paraclete, that is, the Saviour. <a name="fr_2719"></a><a href="#fn_2719"><font size="1">2720</font></a>
  <a name="ix.ii.v-p15.2"></a>This being was endowed with all power by the Father, who placed everything under his authority, the Æons <a name="fr_2720"></a><a href="#fn_2720"><font size="1">2721</font></a>
  doing so likewise, so that “by him were all things, visible and invisible, created, thrones, divinities, dominions.” <a name="fr_2721"></a><a href="#fn_2721"><font size="1">2722</font></a>
  He then was sent to her along with his contemporary angels. And they related that Achamoth, filled with reverence, at first veiled herself through modesty, but that by and by, when she had looked upon him with all his endowments, and had acquired strength from his appearance, she ran forward to meet him. He then imparted to her form as respected intelligence, and brought healing to her passions, separating them from her, but not  <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a> <a name="ix.ii.v-Page_322"></a>  so as to drive them out of thought altogether. For it was not possible that they should be annihilated as in the former case, <a name="fr_2722"></a><a href="#fn_2722"><font size="1">2723</font></a>
  because they had already taken root and acquired strength [so as to possess an indestructible existence]. All that he could do was to separate them and set them apart, and then commingle and condense them, so as to transmute them from incorporeal passion into unorganized matter. <a name="fr_2723"></a><a href="#fn_2723"><font size="1">2724</font></a>
  He then by this process conferred upon them a fitness and a nature to become concretions and corporeal structures, in order that two substances should be formed,—the one evil, resulting from the passions, and the other subject indeed to suffering, but originating from her conversion. And on this account (i.e., on account of this hypostatizing of ideal matter) they say that the Saviour virtually <a name="fr_2724"></a><a href="#fn_2724"><font size="1">2725</font></a>
  created the world. But when Achamoth was freed from her passion, she gazed with rapture on the dazzling vision of the angels that were with him; and in her ecstasy, conceiving by them, they tell us that she brought forth new beings, partly after her own image, and partly a spiritual progeny after the image of the Saviours attendants.</p>
