 <p> <a name="v.v.vii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.v.vii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VII.—Reason of desiring to die.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.v.vii-p1"></a><a name="v.v.vii-p1.1"></a>The prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are [in Rome] help him; rather be ye on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not speak of Jesus Christ, and yet set your desires on the world. Let not envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you, exhort you to it, be ye persuaded to listen to me, but rather give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My love <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">866</font></a>
  has been crucified, and there is no  <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a> <a name="v.v.vii-Page_77"></a>  fire in me desiring to be fed; <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">867</font></a>
  but there is within me a water that liveth and speaketh, <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">868</font></a>
  saying to me inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. <a name="v.v.vii-p4.2"></a>I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.v.vii-p5"></a><a name="v.v.vii-p5.1"></a>The prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are [in Rome] help him; rather be ye on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not speak of Jesus Christ, and yet prefer this world to Him. Let not envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you, exhort you to it, be ye persuaded, but rather give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die for the sake of Christ. My love <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">869</font></a>
  has been crucified, and there is no fire in me that loves anything; but there is living water springing up in me, <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">870</font></a>
  and which says to me inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. <a name="v.v.vii-p7.2"></a>I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.</p>
