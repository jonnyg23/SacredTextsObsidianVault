 <p> <a name="viii.iv.lxxxv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p0.1"></a>Chapter LXXXV.—He proves that Christ is the Lord of Hosts from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#000">Ps. xxiv.</a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p0.2"></a>, and from his authority over demons.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.3"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p1.4"></a>“Moreover, some of you venture to expound the prophecy which runs, Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may enter, <a name="fr_2279"></a><a href="#fn_2279"><font size="1">2280</font></a>
  as if it referred likewise to Hezekiah, and others of you [expound it] of Solomon; but neither to the latter nor to the former, nor, in short, to any of your kings, can it be proved to have reference, but to this our Christ alone, who appeared without comeliness, and inglorious, as Isaiah and David and all the Scriptures said; who is the Lord of hosts, by the will of the Father who conferred on Him [the dignity]; who also rose from the dead, and ascended to heaven, as the Psalm and the other Scriptures manifested when they announced Him to be Lord of hosts; and of this you may, if you will, easily be persuaded by the occurrences which take place before your eyes. For every demon, when exorcised in the name of this very Son of God —who is the First-born of every creature, who became man by the Virgin, who suffered, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate by your nation, who died, who rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven —is overcome and subdued. But though you exorcise any demon in the name of any of those who were amongst you—either kings, or righteous men, or prophets, or patriarchs—it will not be subject to you. But if any of you exorcise it in [the name of] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, it will perhaps be subject to you. Now assuredly your exorcists, I have said, <a name="fr_2280"></a><a href="#fn_2280"><font size="1">2281</font></a>
  make use of craft when they exorcise, even as the Gentiles do, and employ fumigations and incantations. <a name="fr_2281"></a><a href="#fn_2281"><font size="1">2282</font></a>
  But that they are angels and powers whom the word of prophecy by David [commands] to lift up the gates, that He who rose from the dead, Jesus Christ, the Lord of hosts, according to the will of the Father, might enter, the word of David has likewise showed; which I shall again recall to your attention for the sake of those who were not with us yesterday, for whose benefit, moreover, I sum up many things I said yesterday. And now, if I say this to you, although I have repeated it many times, I know that it is not absurd so to do. For it is a ridiculous thing to see the sun, and the moon, and the other stars, continually keeping the same course, and bringing round the different seasons; and to see the computer who may be asked how many are twice two, because he has frequently said that they are four, not ceasing to say again that they are four; and equally so other things, which are confidently admitted, to be continually mentioned and admitted in like manner; yet that he who founds his discourse on the prophetic Scriptures should leave them and abstain from constantly referring to the same Scriptures, because it is thought he can bring forth something better than Scripture. The passage, then, by which I proved that God reveals that there are both angels and hosts in heaven is this: Praise  <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-Page_242"></a>  the Lord from the heavens: praise Him in the highest. Praise Him, all His angels: praise Him, all His hosts. ” <a name="fr_2282"></a><a href="#fn_2282"><font size="1">2283</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p6"></a>Then one of those who had come with them on the second day, whose name was Mnaseas, said, “We are greatly pleased that you undertake to repeat the same things on our account.”</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lxxxv-p7"></a>And I said, “Listen, my friends, to the Scripture which induces me to act thus. Jesus commanded [us] to love even [our] enemies, as was predicted by Isaiah in many passages, in which also is contained the mystery of our own regeneration, as well, in fact, as the regeneration of all who expect that Christ will appear in Jerusalem, and by their works endeavour earnestly to please Him. These are the words spoken by Isaiah: Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at His word. Say, our brethren, to them that hate you and detest you, that the name of the Lord has been glorified. He has appeared to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, <a name="fr_2283"></a><a href="#fn_2283"><font size="1">2284</font></a>
  a voice of the Lord who rendereth recompense to the proud. Before she that travailed brought forth, and before the pains of labour came, she brought forth a male child. Who hath heard such a thing? and who hath seen such a thing? has the earth brought forth in one day? and has she produced a nation at once? for Zion has travailed and borne her children. But I have given such an expectation even to her that does not bring forth, said the Lord. Behold, I have made her that begetteth, and her that is barren, saith the Lord. Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and hold a joyous assembly, all ye that love her. Be glad, all ye that mourn for her, that ye may suck and be filled with the breast of her consolation, that having suck ye may be delighted with the entrance of His glory. ” <a name="fr_2284"></a><a href="#fn_2284"><font size="1">2285</font></a>
