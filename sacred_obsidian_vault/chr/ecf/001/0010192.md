 <p><a name="v.vi.v-p1"></a><a name="v.vi.v-p1.1"></a><a name="v.vi.v-p1.2"></a>My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly [over you], I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but Jesus Christ, for whose sake being bound I fear the more, inasmuch as I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain to that portion which through mercy has been allotted me, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus, and to the apostles as to the presbytery of the Church. <a name="v.vi.v-p1.3"></a><a name="v.vi.v-p1.4"></a>And let us also love the prophets, because they too have proclaimed the Gospel, <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">917</font></a>
  and placed their hope in Him, <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">918</font></a>
  and waited for Him; in whom also believing, they were saved, through union to Jesus Christ, being holy men, worthy of love and admiration, having had witness borne to them by Jesus Christ, and being reckoned along with [us] in the Gospel of the common hope.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.vi.v-p4"></a><a name="v.vi.v-p4.1"></a>My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly [over you], I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but the Lord Jesus through me; for whose sake being bound, I fear the more, for I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain that to which I have been called, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus Christ, and to the apostles as the presbytery of the Church. <a name="v.vi.v-p4.2"></a>I do also love the prophets as those who announced Christ, and as being partakers of the same Spirit with the apostles. <a name="v.vi.v-p4.3"></a>For as the false prophets and the false apostles drew [to themselves] one and the same wicked, deceitful, and seducing <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">919</font></a>
  spirit; so also did the prophets and the apostles receive from God, through Jesus Christ, one and the same Holy Spirit, who is good, and sovereign, <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">920</font></a>
  and true, and the Author of [saving] knowledge. <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">921</font></a>
  For there is one God of the Old and New Testament, “one Mediator between God and men,” for the creation of both intelligent and sensitive beings, and in order to exercise a beneficial and suitable providence [over them]. There is also one Comforter, who displayed <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">922</font></a>
  His power in Moses, and the prophets, and apostles. All the saints, therefore, were saved by Christ, hoping in Him, and waiting for Him; and they obtained through Him salvation, being holy ones, worthy of love and admiration, having testimony borne to them by Jesus Christ, in the Gospel of our common hope.</p>
