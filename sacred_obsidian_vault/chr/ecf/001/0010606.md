 <p> <a name="viii.v.ii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.v.ii-p0.1"></a>Chapter II.—The Greek theogony exposed.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.v.ii-p1"></a><a name="viii.v.ii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.v.ii-p1.2"></a>But since, next to Homer, Hesiod wrote his <i>Works and Days</i>, who will believe his drivelling theogony? For they say that Chronos, the son of Ouranos, <a name="fr_2496"></a><a href="#fn_2496"><font size="1">2497</font></a>
  in the beginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule; and that, being seized with a panic lest he should himself suffer in the same way, he preferred devouring his children; but that, by the craft of the Curetes, Jupiter was conveyed away and kept in secret, and afterwards bound his father with chains, and divided the empire; Jupiter receiving, as the story goes, the air, and Neptune the deep, and Pluto the portion of Hades. But Pluto ravished Proserpine; and Ceres sought her child wandering through the deserts. And this myth was celebrated in the Eleusinian fire. <a name="fr_2497"></a><a href="#fn_2497"><font size="1">2498</font></a>
  Again, Neptune ravished Melanippe when she was drawing water, besides abusing a host of Nereids not a few, whose names, were we to recount them, would cost us a multitude of words. And as for Jupiter, he was a various adulterer, with Antiope as a satyr, with Danaë as gold, and with Europa as a bull; with Leda, moreover, he assumed wings. For the love of Semele proved both his unchastity and the jealousy of Semele. And they say that he carried off the Phrygian Ganymede to be his cup-bearer. These, then, are the exploits of the sons of Saturn. And your illustrious son of Latona [Apollo], who professed soothsaying, convicted himself of lying. He pursued Daphne, but did not gain possession of her; and to Hyacinthus, <a name="fr_2498"></a><a href="#fn_2498"><font size="1">2499</font></a>
  who loved him, he did not foretell his death. And I say nothing of the masculine character of Minerva, nor of the feminine nature of Bacchus, nor of the fornicating disposition of Venus. Read to Jupiter, ye Greeks, the law against parricides, and the penalty of adultery, and the ignominy of pæderasty. Teach Minerva and Diana the works of women, and Bacchus the works of men. What seemliness is  <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a> <a name="viii.v.ii-Page_272"></a>  there in a womans girding herself with armour, or in a mans decorating himself with cymbals, and garlands, and female attire, and accompanied by a herd of bacchanalian women?</p>
