 <p> <a name="ix.vi.ii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.vi.ii-p0.1"></a>Chapter I.—The Lord acknowledged but one God and Father.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.ii-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.vi.ii-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.vi.ii-p1.2"></a><span class="upper"><a name="ix.vi.ii-p1.3"></a>Since</span>, therefore, this is sure and stedfast, that no other God or Lord was announced by the Spirit, except Him who, as God, rules over all, together with His Word, and those who receive the Spirit of adoption, <a name="fr_3804"></a><a href="#fn_3804"><font size="1">3805</font></a>
  that is, those who believe in the one and true God, and in Jesus Christ the Son of God; and likewise that the apostles did of themselves term no one else as God, or name [no other] as Lord; and, what is much more important, [since it is true] that our Lord [acted likewise], who did also command us to confess no one as Father, except Him who is in the heavens, who is the one God and the one Father;—those things are clearly shown to be false which these deceivers and most perverse sophists advance, maintaining that the being whom they have themselves invented is by nature both God and Father; but that the Demiurge is naturally neither God nor Father, but is so termed merely by courtesy (<i>verbo tenus</i>), because of his ruling the creation, these perverse mythologists state, setting their thoughts against God; and, putting aside the doctrine of Christ, and of themselves divining falsehoods, they dispute against the entire dispensation of God. For they maintain that their Æons, and gods, and fathers, and lords, are also still further termed heavens, together with their Mother, whom they do also call “the Earth,” and “Jerusalem,” while they also style her many other names.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.ii-p3"></a>2. Now to whom is it not clear, that if the Lord had known many fathers and gods, He would not have taught His disciples to know [only] one God, <a name="fr_3805"></a><a href="#fn_3805"><font size="1">3806</font></a>
  and to call Him alone Father? But He did the rather distinguish those who by word merely (<i>verbo tenus</i>) are termed gods, from Him who is truly God, that they should not err as to His doctrine, nor understand one [in mistake] for another. And if He did indeed teach us to call one Being Father and God, while He does from time to time Himself confess other fathers and gods in the same sense, then He will appear to enjoin a different course upon His disciples from what He follows Himself. Such conduct, however, does not bespeak the good teacher, but a misleading and invidious one. The apostles, too, according to these mens showing, are proved to be transgressors of the commandment, since they confess the Creator as God, and Lord, and Father, as I have shown—if He is not alone God and Father. Jesus, therefore, will be to them the author and teacher of such transgression, inasmuch as He commanded that one Being should be called Father, <a name="fr_3806"></a><a href="#fn_3806"><font size="1">3807</font></a>
  thus imposing upon them the necessity of confessing the Creator as their Father, as has been pointed out.</p>
