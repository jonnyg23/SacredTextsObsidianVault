 <p><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p1"></a>“But you ought to believe Zechariah when he shows in parable the mystery of Christ, and announces it obscurely. The following are his words: Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I shall dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be added to the Lord in that day. And they shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee; and they shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee. And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and He shall choose Jerusalem again. Let all flesh fear before the Lord, for He is raised up out of His holy clouds. And He showed me Jesus (Joshua) the high priest standing before the angel [of the Lord <a name="fr_2381"></a><a href="#fn_2381"><font size="1">2382</font></a>
 ]; and the devil stood at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said to the devil, The Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Behold, is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? ” <a name="fr_2382"></a><a href="#fn_2382"><font size="1">2383</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p4"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p4.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p4.2"></a>As Trypho was about to reply and contradict me, I said, “Wait and hear what I say first: for I am not to give the explanation which you suppose, as if there had been no priest of the name of Joshua (Jesus) in the land of Babylon, where your nation were prisoners. But even if I did, I have shown that if there <a name="fr_2383"></a><a href="#fn_2383"><font size="1">2384</font></a>
  was a priest named Joshua (Jesus) in your nation, yet the prophet had not seen him in his revelation, just as he had not seen either the devil or the angel of the Lord by eyesight, and in his waking condition, but in a trance, at the time when the revelation was made to him. <a name="fr_2384"></a><a href="#fn_2384"><font size="1">2385</font></a>
  <a name="viii.iv.cxv-p6.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p6.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p6.3"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p6.4"></a>But I now say, that as [Scripture] said that the Son of Nave (Nun) by the name Jesus (Joshua) wrought powerful works and exploits which proclaimed beforehand what would be performed by our Lord; so I proceed now to show  <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.cxv-Page_257"></a>  that the revelation made among your people in Babylon in the days of Jesus (Joshua) the priest, was an announcement of the things to be accomplished by our Priest, who is God, and Christ the Son of God the Father of all.</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.cxv-p7"></a>“Indeed, I wondered,” continued I, “why a little ago you kept silence while I was speaking, and why you did not interrupt me when I said that the son of Nave (Nun) was the only one of contemporaries who came out of Egypt that entered the Holy Land along with the men described as younger than that generation. For you swarm and light on sores like flies. For though one should speak ten thousand words well, if there happen to be one little word displeasing to you, because not sufficiently intelligible or accurate, you make no account of the many good words, but lay hold of the little word, and are very zealous in setting it up as something impious and guilty; in order that, when you are judged with the very same judgment by God, you may have a much heavier account to render for your great audacities, whether evil actions, or bad interpretations which you obtain by falsifying the truth. For with what judgment you judge, it is righteous that you be judged withal.</p>
