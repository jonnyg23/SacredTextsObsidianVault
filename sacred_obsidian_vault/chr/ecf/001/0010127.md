 <p> <a name="v.ii.iv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.ii.iv-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.—The same continued.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.ii.iv-p1"></a><a name="v.ii.iv-p1.1"></a>Wherefore it is fitting that ye should run together in accordance with the will of your bishop, which thing also ye do. For your justly renowned presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your  <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a> <a name="v.ii.iv-Page_51"></a>  concord and harmonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. And do ye, man by man, become a choir, that being harmonious in love, and taking up the song of God in unison, ye may with one voice sing to the Father through Jesus Christ, so that He may both hear you, and perceive by your works that ye are indeed the members of His Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in an unblameable unity, that thus ye may always enjoy communion with God.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.ii.iv-p2"></a><a name="v.ii.iv-p2.1"></a>Wherefore it is fitting that ye also should run together in accordance with the will of the bishop who by Gods appointment <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">515</font></a>
  rules over you. Which thing ye indeed of yourselves do, being instructed by the Spirit. For your justly-renowned presbytery, being worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Thus, being joined together in concord and harmonious love, of which Jesus Christ is the Captain and Guardian, do ye, man by man, become but one choir; so that, agreeing together in concord, and obtaining <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_515"><font size="1">516</font></a>
  a perfect unity with God, ye may indeed be one in harmonious feeling with God the Father, and His beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord. For, says He, “Grant unto them, Holy Father, that as I and Thou are one, they also may be one in us.” <a name="fr_516"></a><a href="#fn_516"><font size="1">517</font></a>
  It is therefore profitable that you, being joined together with God in an unblameable unity, should be the followers of the example of Christ, of whom also ye are members.</p>
