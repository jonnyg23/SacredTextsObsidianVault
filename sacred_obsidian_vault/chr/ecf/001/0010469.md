 <p> <a name="viii.iv.viii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.—Justin by his colloquy is kindled with love to Christ.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.viii-p1"></a>“When he had spoken these and many other things, which there is no time for mentioning at present, he went away, bidding me attend to them; and I have not seen him since. But straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of the prophets, and of those men who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found this philosophy alone to be safe and profitable. Thus, and for this reason, I am a philosopher. Moreover, I would wish that all, making a resolution similar to my own, do not keep themselves away from the words of the Saviour. For they possess a terrible power in themselves, and are sufficient to inspire those who turn aside from the path of rectitude with awe; while the sweetest rest is afforded those who make a diligent practice of them. If, then, you have any concern for yourself, and if you are eagerly looking for salvation, and if you believe in God, you may—since you are not indifferent to the matter <a name="fr_1963"></a><a href="#fn_1963"><font size="1">1964</font></a>
  —become acquainted with the Christ of God, and, after being initiated, <a name="fr_1964"></a><a href="#fn_1964"><font size="1">1965</font></a>
  live a happy life.”</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.viii-p4"></a>When I had said this, my beloved friends <a name="fr_1965"></a><a href="#fn_1965"><font size="1">1966</font></a>
  those who were with Trypho laughed; but he, smiling, says, “I approve of your other remarks, and admire the eagerness with which you study divine things; but it were better for you still to abide in the philosophy of Plato, or of some other man, cultivating endurance, self-control, and moderation, rather than be deceived by false words, and follow the opinions of men of no reputation. For if you remain in that mode of philosophy, and live blamelessly, a hope of a better destiny were left to you; but when you have forsaken God, and reposed confidence in man, what safety still awaits you? If, then, you are willing to listen to me (for I have already considered you a friend), first be circumcised, then observe what ordinances have been enacted with respect to the Sabbath, and the feasts, and  <a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.viii-Page_199"></a>  the new moons of God; and, in a word, do all things which have been written in the law: and then perhaps you shall obtain mercy from God. But Christ —if He has indeed been born, and exists anywhere—is unknown, and does not even know Himself, and has no power until Elias come to anoint Him, and make Him manifest to all. And you, having accepted a groundless report, invent a Christ for yourselves, and for his sake are inconsiderately perishing.”</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="viii.iv.viii-p2"></a> According to one interpretation, this clause is applied to God: “If you believe in God, seeing He is not indifferent to the matter,” etc. Maranus says that it means: A Jew who reads so much of Christ in the Old Testament, cannot be indifferent to the things which pertain to Him.</p>
