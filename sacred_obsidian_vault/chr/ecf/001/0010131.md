 <p><a name="v.ii.viii-p1"></a><a name="v.ii.viii-p1.1"></a>Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived, inasmuch as ye are wholly devoted to God. For since there is no strife raging among you which might distress you, ye are certainly living in accordance with Gods will. I am far inferior to you, and require to be sanctified by your Church of Ephesus, so renowned throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief,  <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a> <a name="v.ii.viii-Page_53"></a>  nor unbelief the works of faith. But even those things which ye do according to the flesh are spiritual; for ye do all things in Jesus Christ.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.ii.viii-p2"></a><a name="v.ii.viii-p2.1"></a>Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived; for ye are wholly devoted to God. For when there is no evil desire within you, which might defile and torment you, then do ye live in accordance with the will of God, and are [the servants] of Christ. Cast ye out that which defiles <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">539</font></a>
  you, who are of the <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">540</font></a>
  most holy Church of the Ephesians, which is so famous and celebrated throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith. <a name="v.ii.viii-p4.1"></a>But ye, being full of the Holy Spirit, do nothing according to the flesh, but all things according to the Spirit. Ye are complete in Christ Jesus, “who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.” <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_540"><font size="1">541</font></a>
