 <p><a name="ii.ii.lix-p1"></a>Send back speedily to us in peace and with joy these our messengers to you: Claudius Ephebus and Valerius Bito, with Fortunatus: that they may the sooner announce to us the peace and harmony we so earnestly desire and long for [among you], and that we may the more quickly rejoice over the good order re-established among you. <a name="ii.ii.lix-p1.1"></a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, and with all everywhere that are the called of God through Him, by whom be to Him glory, honour, power, majesty, and eternal dominion, <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">260</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.ii.lix-p4"></a> [Note St. Clements frequent doxologies.] [N.B.—The language of Clement concerning the Western progress of St. Paul (cap. v.) is our earliest postscript to his Scripture biography. It is sufficient to refer the reader to the great works of Conybeare and Howson, and of Mr. Lewin, on the <i>Life and Epistles of St. Paul</i>. See more especially the valuable note of Lewin (vol. ii. p. 294) which takes notice of the opinion of some learned men, that the great Apostle of the Gentiles preached the Gospel in Britain. The whold subject of St. Pauls relations with British Christians is treated by Williams, in his <i>Antiquities of the Cymry</i>, with learning and in an attractive manner. But the reader will find more ready to his hand, perhaps, the interesting note of Mr. Lewin, on Claudia and Pudens (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021">2 Tim. iv. 21</a><a name="ii.ii.lix-p4.1"></a>), in his <i>Life and Epistles of St. Paul</i>, vol. ii. p. 392. See also Paleys <i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>, p. 40. London, 1820.]</p>
