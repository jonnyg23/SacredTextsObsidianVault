 <p> <a name="viii.iv.civ"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.civ-p0.1"></a>Chapter CIV.—Circumstances of Christs death are predicted in this Psalm.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.civ-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.civ-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.civ-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.civ-p1.3"></a>“And the statement, Thou hast brought me into the dust of death; for many dogs have surrounded me: the assembly of the wicked have beset me round. They pierced my hands and my feet. They did tell all my bones. They did look and stare upon me. They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture,—was a prediction, as I said before, of the death to which the synagogue of the wicked would condemn Him, whom He calls both dogs and hunters, declaring that those who hunted Him were both gathered together and assiduously striving to condemn Him. And this is recorded to have happened in the memoirs of His apostles. And I have shown that, after His crucifixion, they who crucified Him parted His garments among them.</p>
