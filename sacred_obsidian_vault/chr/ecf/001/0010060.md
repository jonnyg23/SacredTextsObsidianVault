 <p><a name="ii.ii.lv-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.lv-p1.1"></a><a name="ii.ii.lv-p1.2"></a>To bring forward some examples from among the heathen: Many kings and princes, in times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an oracle, have given themselves up to death, in order that by their own blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens [from destruction]. Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be brought to an end within  <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.lv-Page_20"></a>  them. We know many among ourselves who have given themselves up to bonds, in order that they might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery, that with the price <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">244</font></a>
  which they received for themselves, they might provide food for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly exploits. <a name="ii.ii.lv-p2.3"></a>The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman. <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">245</font></a>
  <a name="ii.ii.lv-p3.2"></a>Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction. For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the everlasting God, who seeth all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the people for whose sake she had encountered peril. <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">246</font></a>
