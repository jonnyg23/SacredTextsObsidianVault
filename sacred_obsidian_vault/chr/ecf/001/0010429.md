 <p><a name="viii.ii.lvi-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.lvi-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.ii.lvi-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.ii.lvi-p1.3"></a>But the evil spirits were not satisfied with saying, before Christs appearance, that those who were said to be sons of Jupiter were born of him; but after He had appeared, and been born among men, and when they learned how He had been foretold by the prophets, and knew that He should be believed on and looked for by every nation, they again, as was said above, put forward other men, the Samaritans Simon and Menander, who did many mighty works by magic, and deceived many, and still keep them deceived. For even among yourselves, as we said before, <a name="fr_1886"></a><a href="#fn_1886"><font size="1">1887</font></a>
  Simon was in the royal city Rome in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, and so greatly astonished the sacred senate and people of the Romans, that he was considered a god, and honoured, like the others whom you honour as gods, with a statue. Wherefore we pray that the sacred senate and your people may, along with yourselves, be arbiters of this our memorial, in order that if any one be entangled by that mans doctrines, he may learn the truth, and so be able to escape error; and as for the statue, if you please, destroy it.</p>
