 <p> <a name="ix.ii.xxiv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXIII.—Doctrines and practices of Simon Magus and Menander.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p1.2"></a>Simon the Samaritan was that magician of whom Luke, the disciple and follower of the apostles, says, “But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime used magical arts in that city, and led astray the people of Samaria, declaring that he himself was some great one, to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This is the power of God, which is called great. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had driven them mad by his sorceries.” <a name="fr_2933"></a><a href="#fn_2933"><font size="1">2934</font></a>
  This Simon, then—who feigned faith, supposing that the apostles themselves performed their cures by the art of magic, and not by the power of God; and with respect to their filling with the Holy Ghost, through the imposition of hands, those that believed in God through Him who was preached by them, namely, Christ Jesus—suspecting that even this was done through a kind of greater knowledge of magic, and offering money to the apostles, thought he, too, might receive this power of bestowing the Holy Spirit on whomsoever he would,—was addressed in these words by Peter: “Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be purchased with money: thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.” <a name="fr_2934"></a><a href="#fn_2934"><font size="1">2935</font></a>
  He, then, not putting faith in God a whit the more, set himself eagerly to contend against the apostles, in order that he himself might seem to be a wonderful being, and applied himself with still greater zeal to the study of the whole magic art, that he might the better bewilder and overpower multitudes of men. <a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p3.2"></a>Such was his procedure in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, by whom also he is said to have been honoured with a statue, on account of his  <a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 348</font></a> <a name="ix.ii.xxiv-Page_348"></a>  magical power. <a name="fr_2935"></a><a href="#fn_2935"><font size="1">2936</font></a>
  This man, then, was glorified by many as if he were a god; and he taught that it was himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, but descended in Samaria as the Father while he came to other nations in the character of the Holy Spirit. He represented himself, in a word, as being the loftiest of all powers, that is, the Being who is the Father over all, and he allowed himself to be called by whatsoever title men were pleased to address him.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p5"></a>2. Now this Simon of Samaria, from whom all sorts of heresies derive their origin, formed his sect out of the following materials:—<a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p5.1"></a><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p5.2"></a>Having redeemed from slavery at Tyre, a city of Phœnicia, a certain woman named Helena, he was in the habit of carrying her about with him, declaring that this woman was the first conception of his mind, the mother of all, by whom, in the beginning, he conceived in his mind [the thought] of forming angels and archangels. For this Ennœa leaping forth from him, and comprehending the will of her father, descended to the lower regions [of space], and generated angels and powers, by whom also he declared this world was formed. But after she had produced them, she was detained by them through motives of jealousy, because they were unwilling to be looked upon as the progeny of any other being. As to himself, they had no knowledge of him whatever; but his Ennœa was detained by those powers and angels who had been produced by her. She suffered all kinds of contumely from them, so that she could not return upwards to her father, but was even shut up in a human body, and for ages passed in succession from one female body to another, as from vessel to vessel. She was, for example, in that Helen on whose account the Trojan war was undertaken; for whose sake also <a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p5.3"></a>Stesichorus <a name="fr_2936"></a><a href="#fn_2936"><font size="1">2937</font></a>
  was struck blind, because he had cursed her in his verses, but afterwards, repenting and writing what are called <i>palinodes</i>, in which he sang her praise, he was restored to sight. Thus she, passing from body to body, and suffering insults in every one of them, at last became a common prostitute; and she it was that was meant by the lost sheep. <a name="fr_2937"></a><a href="#fn_2937"><font size="1">2938</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p8"></a>3. For this purpose, then, he had come that he might win her first, and free her from slavery, while he conferred salvation upon men, by making himself known to them. For since the angels ruled the world ill because each one of them coveted the principal power for himself, he had come to amend matters, and had descended, transfigured and assimilated to powers and principalities and angels, so that he might appear among men to be a man, while yet he was not a man; and that thus he was thought to have suffered in Judæa, when he had not suffered. Moreover, the prophets uttered their predictions under the inspiration of those angels who formed the world; for which reason those who place their trust in him and Helena no longer regarded them, but, as being free, live as they please; for men are saved through his grace, and not on account of their own righteous actions. For such deeds are not righteous in the nature of things, but by mere accident, just as those angels who made the world, have thought fit to constitute them, seeking, by means of such precepts, to bring men into bondage. On this account, he pledged himself that the world should be dissolved, and that those who are his should be freed from the rule of them who made the world.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p9"></a>4. <a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p9.1"></a>Thus, then, the mystic priests belonging to this sect both lead profligate lives and practise magical arts, each one to the extent of his ability. They use exorcisms and incantations. Love-potions, too, and charms, as well as those beings who are called “Paredri” (familiars) and “Oniropompi” (dream-senders), and whatever other curious arts can be had recourse to, are eagerly pressed into their service. They also have an image of Simon fashioned after the likeness of Jupiter, and another of Helena in the shape of Minerva; and these they worship. In fine, they have a name derived from Simon, the author of these most impious doctrines, being called Simonians; and from them “knowledge, falsely so called,” <a name="fr_2938"></a><a href="#fn_2938"><font size="1">2939</font></a>
  received its beginning, as one may learn even from their own assertions.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p11"></a>5. <a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p11.1"></a><a name="ix.ii.xxiv-p11.2"></a>The successor of this man was Menander, also a Samaritan by birth, and he, too, was a perfect adept in the practice of magic. He affirms that the primary Power continues unknown to all, but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a saviour, for the deliverance of men. The world was made by angels, whom, like Simon, he maintains to have been produced by Ennœa. He gives, too, as he affirms, by means of that magic which he teaches, knowledge to this effect, that one may overcome those very angels that made the world; for his disciples obtain the <i>resurrection</i> by being baptized into him, and can die no more, but remain in the possession of immortal youth.</p>
