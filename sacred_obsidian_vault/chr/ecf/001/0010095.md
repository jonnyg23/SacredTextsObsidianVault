 <p> <a name="iv.ii.xiii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XIII.—Concerning the transmission of epistles.</h3>  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p1"></a><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p1.1"></a>Both you and Ignatius <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">411</font></a>
  wrote to me, that if any one went [from this] into Syria, he should carry your letter <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">412</font></a>
  with him; which request I will attend to if I find a fitting opportunity, either personally, or through some other acting for me, that your desire may be fulfilled. The Epistles of Ignatius written by him <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">413</font></a>
  to us, and all the rest [of his Epistles] which we have by us, we have sent to you, as you requested. They are subjoined to this Epistle, and by them ye may be greatly profited; for they treat of faith and patience, and all things that tend to edification in our Lord. Any <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">414</font></a>
  more certain information you may have obtained respecting both Ignatius himself, and those that were <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">415</font></a>
  with him, have the goodness to make known <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">416</font></a>
  to us.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p4"></a> Reference is here made to the two letters of Ignatius, one to Polycarp himself, and the other to the church at Smyrna.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p7"></a> Polycarp was aware of the death of Ignatius (chap. ix.), but was as yet apparently ignorant of the circumstances attending it. [Who can fail to be touched by these affectionate yet entirely calm expressions as to his martyred friend and brother? Martyrdom was the habitual end of Christs soldiers, and Polycarp expected his own; hence his restrained and temperate words of interest.]</p>
