 <p><a name="v.iv.xiii-p1"></a><a name="v.iv.xiii-p1.1"></a>The love of the Smyrnæans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember in your prayers the Church which is in Syria, from which also I am not worthy to receive my appellation, being the last <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">815</font></a>
  of them. Fare ye well in Jesus Christ, while ye continue subject to the bishop, as to the command [of God], and in like manner to the presbytery. And do ye, every man, love one another with an undivided heart. Let my spirit be sanctified <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">816</font></a>
  by yours, not only now, but also when I shall attain to God. For I am as yet exposed to danger. <a name="v.iv.xiii-p3.4"></a>But the Father is faithful in Jesus Christ to fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may ye be found unblameable.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.iv.xiii-p4"></a><a name="v.iv.xiii-p4.1"></a>The love of the Smyrnæans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember our Church which is in Syria, from which I am not worthy to receive my appellation, being the last <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">817</font></a>
  of those of that place. <a name="v.iv.xiii-p5.1"></a>Fare ye well in the Lord Jesus Christ, while ye continue subject to the bishop, and in like manner to the presbyters and to the deacons. And do ye, every man, love one another with an undivided heart. My spirit salutes you, <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">818</font></a>
  not only now, but also when I shall have attained to God; for I am as yet exposed to danger. <a name="v.iv.xiii-p6.4"></a>But the Father of Jesus Christ is faithful to fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may we be found without spot. May I have joy of you in the Lord.</p>
