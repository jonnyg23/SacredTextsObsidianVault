 <p><a name="viii.ix.ix-p1"></a>The soul can with difficulty be recalled to those good things from which it has fallen, and  <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a> <a name="viii.ix.ix-Page_301"></a>  is with difficulty dragged away from those evils to which it has become accustomed. If at any time thou showest a disposition to blame thyself, then perhaps, through the medicine of repentance, I should cherish good hopes regarding thee. But when thou altogether despisest fear, and rejectest with scorn the very faith of Christ, it were better for thee that thou hadst never been born from the womb.—<i>From the writings of</i> <span class="upper"><a name="viii.ix.ix-p1.1"></a>John of Damascus</span>.</p>
