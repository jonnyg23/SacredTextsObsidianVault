 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xxv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xxv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXV.—The Jews boast in vain that they are sons of Abraham.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xxv-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xxv-p1.1"></a>“Those who justify themselves, and say they are sons of Abraham, shall be desirous even in a small degree to receive the inheritance along with you; <a name="fr_2008"></a><a href="#fn_2008"><font size="1">2009</font></a>
  as the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Isaiah, cries, speaking thus while he personates them: Return from heaven, and behold from the habitation of Thy holiness and glory. Where is Thy zeal and strength? Where is the multitude of Thy mercy? for Thou hast sustained us, O Lord. For Thou art our Father, because Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel has not recognised us. But Thou, O Lord, our Father,  <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.xxv-Page_207"></a>  deliver us: from the beginning Thy name is upon us. O Lord, why hast Thou made us to err from Thy way? and hardened our hearts, so that we do not fear Thee? Return for Thy servants sake, the tribes of Thine inheritance, that we may inherit for a little Thy holy mountain. We were as from the beginning, when Thou didst not bear rule over us, and when Thy name was not called upon us. If Thou wilt open the heavens, trembling shall seize the mountains before Thee: and they shall be melted, as wax melts before the fire; and fire shall consume the adversaries, and Thy name shall be manifest among the adversaries; the nations shall be put into disorder before Thy face. When Thou shall do glorious things, trembling shall seize the mountains before Thee. From the beginning we have not heard, nor have our eyes seen a God besides Thee: and Thy works, <a name="fr_2009"></a><a href="#fn_2009"><font size="1">2010</font></a>
  the mercy which Thou shall show to those who repent. He shall meet those who do righteousness, and they shall remember Thy ways. Behold, Thou art wroth, and we were sinning. Therefore we have erred and become all unclean, and all our righteousness is as the rags of a woman set apart: and we have faded away like leaves by reason of our iniquities; thus the wind will take us away. And there is none that calleth upon Thy name, or remembers to take hold of Thee; for Thou hast turned away Thy face from us, and hast given us up on account of our sins. And now return, O Lord, for we are all Thy people. The city of Thy holiness has become desolate. Zion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse; the house, our holiness, and the glory which our fathers blessed, has been burned with fire; and all the glorious nations <a name="fr_2010"></a><a href="#fn_2010"><font size="1">2011</font></a>
  have fallen along with it. And in addition to these [misfortunes], O Lord, Thou hast refrained Thyself, and art silent, and hast humbled us very much. ” <a name="fr_2011"></a><a href="#fn_2011"><font size="1">2012</font></a>

 <p><a name="viii.iv.xxv-p6"></a>And Trypho remarked, “What is this you say? that none of us shall inherit anything on the holy mountain of God?”</p>
