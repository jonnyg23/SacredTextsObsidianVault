 <p><a name="viii.ii.vii-p1"></a>But some one will say, Some have ere now been arrested and convicted as evil-doers. For  <a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a> <a name="viii.ii.vii-Page_165"></a>  you condemn many, many a time, after inquiring into the life of each of the accused severally, but not on account of those of whom we have been speaking. <a name="fr_1776"></a><a href="#fn_1776"><font size="1">1777</font></a>
  <a name="viii.ii.vii-p2.1"></a>And this we acknowledge, that as among the Greeks those who teach such theories as please themselves are all called by the one name “Philosopher,” though their doctrines be diverse, so also among the Barbarians this name on which accusations are accumulated is the common property of those who are and those who seem wise. For all are called Christians. <a name="viii.ii.vii-p2.2"></a><a name="viii.ii.vii-p2.3"></a>Wherefore we demand that the deeds of all those who are accused to you be judged, in order that each one who is convicted may be punished as an evil-doer, and not as a Christian; and if it is clear that any one is blameless, that he may be acquitted, since by the mere fact of his being a Christian he does no wrong. <a name="fr_1777"></a><a href="#fn_1777"><font size="1">1778</font></a>
  For we will not require that you punish our accusers; <a name="fr_1778"></a><a href="#fn_1778"><font size="1">1779</font></a>
  they being sufficiently punished by their present wickedness and ignorance of what is right.</p>
