 <p> <a name="ix.ii.viii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.ii.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VII.—The mother Achamoth, when all her seed are perfected, shall pass into the Pleroma, accompanied by those men who are spiritual; the Demiurge, with animal men, shall pass into the intermediate habitation; but all material men shall go into corruption. Their blasphemous opinions against the true incarnation of Christ by the Virgin Mary. Their views as to the prophecies. Stupid ignorance of the Demiurge.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.viii-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.ii.viii-p1.1"></a>When all the seed shall have come to perfection, they state that then their mother Achamoth shall pass from the intermediate place, and enter in within the Pleroma, and shall receive as her spouse the Saviour, who sprang from all the Æons, that thus a conjunction may be formed between the Saviour and Sophia, that is, Achamoth. These, then, are the bridegroom and bride, while the nuptial chamber is the full extent of the Pleroma. The spiritual seed, again, being divested of their animal souls, <a name="fr_2740"></a><a href="#fn_2740"><font size="1">2741</font></a>
  and becoming intelligent spirits, shall in an irresistible and invisible manner enter in within the Pleroma, and be bestowed as brides on those angels who wait upon the Saviour. <a name="ix.ii.viii-p2.1"></a>The Demiurge himself will pass into the place of his mother Sophia; <a name="fr_2741"></a><a href="#fn_2741"><font size="1">2742</font></a>
  that is, the intermediate habitation. In this intermediate place, also, shall the souls of the righteous repose; but nothing of an animal nature shall find admittance to the Pleroma. When these things have taken place as described, then shall that fire which lies hidden in the world blaze forth and burn; and while destroying all matter, shall also be extinguished along with it, and have no further existence. They affirm that the Demiurge was acquainted with none of these things before the advent of the Saviour.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.viii-p4"></a>2. <a name="ix.ii.viii-p4.1"></a>There are also some who maintain that he also produced Christ as his own proper son, but of an animal nature, and that mention was <a name="fr_2742"></a><a href="#fn_2742"><font size="1">2743</font></a>
  made of him by the prophets. This Christ passed through Mary <a name="fr_2743"></a><a href="#fn_2743"><font size="1">2744</font></a>
  just as water flows through a tube; and there descended upon him in the form of a dove at the time of his baptism, that Saviour who belonged to the Pleroma, and was formed by the combined efforts of all its inhabitants. In him there existed also that spiritual seed which proceeded from Achamoth. They hold, accordingly, that our Lord, while preserving the type of the first-begotten and primary tetrad, was compounded of these four substances,—of that which is spiritual, in so far as He was from Achamoth; of that which is animal, as being from the Demiurge by a special dispensation, inasmuch as He was formed [corporeally] with unspeakable skill; and of the Saviour, as respects that dove which descended upon Him. He also continued free from all suffering, since indeed it was not possible that He should suffer who was at once incomprehensible and invisible. And for this reason the Spirit of Christ, who had been placed within Him, was taken away when He was brought before Pilate. They maintain, further, that not even the seed which He had received from the mother [Achamoth] was subject to suffering; for it, too, was impassible, as being spiritual, and invisible even to the Demiurge himself. It follows, then, according to them, that the animal Christ, and that which had been formed mysteriously by a special dispensation, underwent suffering, that the mother might exhibit through him a type of the Christ above, namely, of him who extended himself through Stauros, <a name="fr_2744"></a><a href="#fn_2744"><font size="1">2745</font></a>
  and imparted to Achamoth shape, so far as substance was concerned. For they declare that all these transactions were counterparts of what took place above.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.viii-p8"></a>3. They maintain, moreover, that those souls which possess the seed of Achamoth are superior to the rest, and are more dearly loved by the Demiurge than others, while he knows not the true cause thereof, but imagines that they are what they are through his favour towards them. Wherefore, also, they say he distributed them to prophets, priests, and kings; and they declare that many things were spoken <a name="fr_2745"></a><a href="#fn_2745"><font size="1">2746</font></a>
  by this seed through the prophets, inasmuch as it was endowed with a transcendently lofty nature. The  <a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a> <a name="ix.ii.viii-Page_326"></a>  mother also, they say, spake much about things above, and that both through him and through the souls which were formed by him. Then, again, they divide the prophecies [into different classes], maintaining that one portion was uttered by the mother, a second by her seed, and a third by the Demiurge. In like manner, they hold that Jesus uttered some things under the influence of the Saviour, others under that of the mother, and others still under that of the Demiurge, as we shall show further on in our work.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.viii-p10"></a>4. The Demiurge, while ignorant of those things which were higher than himself, was indeed excited by the announcements made [through the prophets], but treated them with contempt, attributing them sometimes to one cause and sometimes to another; either to the prophetic spirit (which itself possesses the power of self-excitement), or to [mere unassisted] man, or that it was simply a crafty device of the lower [and baser order of men]. <a name="fr_2746"></a><a href="#fn_2746"><font size="1">2747</font></a>
  He remained thus ignorant until the appearing of the Lord. <a name="ix.ii.viii-p11.1"></a>But they relate that when the Saviour came, the Demiurge learned all things from Him, and gladly with all, his power joined himself to Him. <a name="ix.ii.viii-p11.2"></a><a name="ix.ii.viii-p11.3"></a>They maintain that he is the centurion mentioned in the Gospel, who addressed the Saviour in these words: “For I also am one having soldiers and servants under my authority; and whatsoever I command they do.” <a name="fr_2747"></a><a href="#fn_2747"><font size="1">2748</font></a>
  They further hold that he will continue administering the affairs of the world as long as that is fitting and needful, and specially that he may exercise a care over the Church; while at the same time he is influenced by the knowledge of the reward prepared for him, namely, that he may attain to the habitation of his mother.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.viii-p13"></a>5. They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material, and animal, represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer found in one person, <a name="fr_2748"></a><a href="#fn_2748"><font size="1">2749</font></a>
  but constitute various kinds [of men]. <a name="ix.ii.viii-p14.1"></a>The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption. The animal, if it make choice of the better part, finds repose in the intermediate place; but if the worse, it too shall pass into destruction. But they assert that the spiritual principles which have been sown by Achamoth, being disciplined and nourished here from that time until now in righteous souls (because when given forth by her they were yet but weak), at last attaining to perfection, shall be given as brides to the angels of the Saviour, while their animal souls of necessity rest for ever with the Demiurge in the intermediate place. And again subdividing the animal souls themselves, they say that some are by nature good, and others by nature evil. The good are those who become capable of receiving the [spiritual] seed; the evil by nature are those who are never able to receive that seed.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.viii-p6"></a> “Thus,” says Harvey, “we may trace back to the Gnostic period the Apollinarian error, closely allied to the Docetic, that the body of Christ was not derived from the blessed Virgin, but that it was of heavenly substance, and was only brought forth into the world through her instrumentality.”</p>
