 <p><a name="v.iv.xii-p1"></a>I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are with me, who have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in the spirit. <a name="v.iv.xii-p1.1"></a>My bonds, which I carry about with me for the sake of Jesus Christ (praying that I may attain to God), exhort you. <a name="v.iv.xii-p1.2"></a><a name="v.iv.xii-p1.3"></a>Continue in harmony among yourselves, and in prayer with one another; for it becomes every one of you, and especially the presbyters, to refresh the bishop, to the honour of the Father, of Jesus Christ, and of the apostles. I entreat you in love to hear me, that I may not, by having written, be a testimony against you. And do ye also pray for me, who have need of your love, along with the mercy of God, that I may be worthy of the lot for which I am destined, and that I may not be found reprobate.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.iv.xii-p2"></a>I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are with me, whose rulers have refreshed me in every respect, both in the flesh and in the spirit. <a name="v.iv.xii-p2.1"></a>My bonds, which I carry about with me for the sake of Jesus Christ (praying that I may attain to God), exhort you. <a name="v.iv.xii-p2.2"></a><a name="v.iv.xii-p2.3"></a>Continue in harmony among yourselves, and in supplication; for it becomes every one of you, and especially the presbyters, to refresh the bishop, to the honour of the Father, and to the honour of Jesus Christ and of the apostles. I entreat you in love to hear me, that I may not, by having thus written, be a testimony against you. And do ye also pray for me, who have need of your love, along with the mercy of God, that I may be thought worthy to attain the lot for which I am now designed, and that I may not be found reprobate.</p>
