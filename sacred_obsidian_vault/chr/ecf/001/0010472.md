 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XI.—The law abrogated; the New Testament promised and given by God.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xi-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xi-p1.1"></a>“There will be no other God, O Trypho, nor was there from eternity any other existing” (I thus addressed him), “but He who made and disposed all this universe. Nor do we think that there is one God for us, another for you, but that He alone is God who led your fathers out from Egypt with a strong hand and a high arm. Nor have we trusted in any other (for there is no other), but in Him in whom you also have trusted, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. <a name="viii.iv.xi-p1.2"></a>But we do not trust through Moses or through the law; for then we would do the same as yourselves. But now <a name="fr_1967"></a><a href="#fn_1967"><font size="1">1968</font></a>
 —(for I have read that there shall be a final law, and a covenant, the chiefest  <a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.xi-Page_200"></a>  of all, which it is now incumbent on all men to observe, as many as are seeking after the inheritance of God. For the law promulgated on Horeb is now old, and belongs to yourselves alone; but <i>this</i> is for all universally. Now, law placed against law has abrogated that which is before it, and a covenant which comes after in like manner has put an end to the previous one; and an eternal and final law—namely, Christ —has been given to us, and the covenant is trustworthy, after which there shall be no law, no commandment, no ordinance. Have you not read this which Isaiah says: Hearken unto Me, hearken unto Me, my people; and, ye kings, give ear unto Me: for a law shall go forth from Me, and My judgment shall be for a light to the nations. My righteousness approaches swiftly, and My salvation shall go forth, and nations shall trust in Mine arm? <a name="fr_1968"></a><a href="#fn_1968"><font size="1">1969</font></a>
  And by Jeremiah, concerning this same new covenant, He thus speaks: Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt <a name="fr_1969"></a><a href="#fn_1969"><font size="1">1970</font></a>
 ). If, therefore, God proclaimed a new covenant which was to be instituted, and this for a light of the nations, we see and are persuaded that men approach God, leaving their idols and other unrighteousness, through the name of Him who was crucified, Jesus Christ, and abide by their confession even unto death, and maintain piety. Moreover, by the works and by the attendant miracles, it is possible for all to understand that He is the new law, and the new covenant, and the expectation of those who out of every people wait for the good things of God. For the true spiritual Israel, and descendants of Judah, Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham (who in uncircumcision was approved of and blessed by God on account of his faith, and called the father of many nations), are we who have been led to God through this crucified Christ, as shall be demonstrated while we proceed.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="viii.iv.xi-p2"></a> Editors suppose that Justin inserts a long parenthesis here, from “for” to “Egypt.” It is more natural to take this as an anacoluthon. Justin was going to say, “But now we trust through Christ,” but feels that such a statement requires preliminary explanation.</p>
