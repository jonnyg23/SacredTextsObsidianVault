 <p> <a name="v.xxv.vii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.xxv.vii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VII.—Ignatius appears in a vision after his death.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.xxv.vii-p1"></a><a name="v.xxv.vii-p1.1"></a>Now these things took place on the thirteenth day before the Kalends of January, that is, on the twentieth of December, <a name="fr_1434"></a><a href="#fn_1434"><font size="1">1435</font></a>
  Sura and Senecio being then the consuls of the Romans for the second time. Having ourselves been eye-witnesses of these things, and having spent the whole night in tears within the house, and having entreated the Lord, with bended knees and much prayer, that He would give us weak men full assurance respecting the things which were done, <a name="fr_1435"></a><a href="#fn_1435"><font size="1">1436</font></a>
  it came to pass, on our falling into a brief slumber, that some of us saw the blessed Ignatius suddenly standing by us and embracing us, while others beheld him again praying for us, and others still saw him dropping with sweat, as if he had just come from his great labour, and standing by the Lord. When, therefore, we had with great joy witnessed these things, and had compared our several visions <a name="fr_1436"></a><a href="#fn_1436"><font size="1">1437</font></a>
  together, we sang praise to God, the giver of all good things, and expressed our sense of the happiness of the holy [martyr]; and now we have made known to you both the day and the time [when these things happened], that, assembling ourselves together according to the time of his martyrdom, we may have fellowship with the champion and noble martyr of Christ, who trod under foot the devil, and perfected the course which, out of love to Christ, he had desired, in Christ Jesus our Lord; by whom, and with whom, be glory and power to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, for evermore! Amen.</p>
