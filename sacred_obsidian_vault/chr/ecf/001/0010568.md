 <p> <a name="viii.iv.cvii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.cvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter CVII.—The same is taught from the history of Jonah.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.cvii-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cvii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cvii-p1.2"></a>“And that He would rise again on the third day after the crucifixion, it is written <a name="fr_2358"></a><a href="#fn_2358"><font size="1">2359</font></a>
  in the memoirs that some of your nation, questioning Him, said, Show us a sign; and He replied to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and no sign shall be given them, save the sign of Jonah. And since He spoke this obscurely, it was to be understood by the audience that after His crucifixion He should rise again on the third day. And He showed that your generation was more wicked and more adulterous than the city of Nineveh; for the latter, when Jonah preached to them, after he had been cast up on the third day from the belly of the great fish, that after three (in other versions, forty) <a name="fr_2359"></a><a href="#fn_2359"><font size="1">2360</font></a>
  days they should all perish, proclaimed a fast of all creatures, men and beasts, with sackcloth, and with earnest lamentation, with true repentance from the heart, and turning away from unrighteousness, in the belief that God is merciful and kind to all who turn from wickedness; so that the king of that city himself, with his nobles also, put on sackcloth and remained fasting and praying, and obtained their request that the city should not be overthrown. But when Jonah was grieved that on the (fortieth) third day, as he proclaimed, the city was not overthrown, by the dispensation of a gourd <a name="fr_2360"></a><a href="#fn_2360"><font size="1">2361</font></a>
  springing up from the earth for him, under which he sat  <a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.cvii-Page_253"></a>  and was shaded from the heat (now the gourd had sprung up suddenly, and Jonah had neither planted nor watered it, but it had come up all at once to afford him shade), and by the other dispensation of its withering away, for which Jonah grieved, [God] convicted him of being unjustly displeased because the city of Nineveh had not been overthrown, and said, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night. And shall I not spare Nineveh, the great city, wherein dwell more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle? <a name="fr_2361"></a><a href="#fn_2361"><font size="1">2362</font></a>
