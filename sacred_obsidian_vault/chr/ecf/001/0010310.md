 <p><a name="v.xviii.vi-p1"></a>But time would fail me if I should endeavour to enumerate <a name="fr_1372"></a><a href="#fn_1372"><font size="1">1373</font></a>
  all those that pleased God in their youth, having been entrusted by God with either the prophetical, the priestly, or the kingly office. And those which have been mentioned may suffice, by way of bringing the subject to thy remembrance. But I entreat thee not to reckon me presumptuous or ostentatious [in writing as I have done]. For I have set forth these statements, not as instructing thee, but simply as suggesting the matter to the remembrance of my father in God. For I know my own place, <a name="fr_1373"></a><a href="#fn_1373"><font size="1">1374</font></a>
  and do not compare myself with such as you. I salute thy holy clergy, and thy Christ-loving people who are ruled under thy care as their pastor. All the faithful with us salute thee. Pray, blessed shepherd, that I may be in health as respects God.</p>
