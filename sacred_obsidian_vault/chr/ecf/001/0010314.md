 <p><a name="v.xix.iii-p1"></a>I have gladly acted as requested in thy letter, <a name="fr_1378"></a><a href="#fn_1378"><font size="1">1379</font></a>
  having no doubt respecting those persons whom thou didst prove to be men of worth. For I am sure that thou barest testimony to them in the exercise of a godly judgment, <a name="fr_1379"></a><a href="#fn_1379"><font size="1">1380</font></a>
  and not through the influence of carnal favour. And thy numerous quotations of Scripture passages exceedingly delighted me, which, when I had read, I had no longer a single doubtful thought respecting the matter. For I did not hold that those things were simply to be glanced over by my eyes, of which I had received from thee such an incontrovertible demonstration. May I be in place of thy soul, because thou lovest Jesus, the Son of the living God. Wherefore also He Himself says to thee, “I love them that love Me; and those that seek Me shall find peace.” <a name="fr_1380"></a><a href="#fn_1380"><font size="1">1381</font></a>
