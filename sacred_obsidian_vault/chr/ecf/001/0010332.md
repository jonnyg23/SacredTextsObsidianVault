 <p> <a name="v.xxv.vi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.xxv.vi-p0.1"></a>Chapter VI.—Ignatius is devoured by the beasts at Rome.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.xxv.vi-p1"></a><a name="v.xxv.vi-p1.1"></a>They pushed forth therefore from the place which is called Portus; <a name="fr_1424"></a><a href="#fn_1424"><font size="1">1425</font></a>
  and (the <a name="fr_1425"></a><a href="#fn_1425"><font size="1">1426</font></a>
  fame of all relating to the holy martyr being already spread  <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a> <a name="v.xxv.vi-Page_131"></a>  abroad) we met the brethren full of fear and joy; rejoicing indeed because they were thought worthy to meet with Theophorus, but struck with fear because so eminent a man was being led to death. Now he enjoined some to keep silence who, in their fervent zeal, were saying <a name="fr_1426"></a><a href="#fn_1426"><font size="1">1427</font></a>
  that they would appease the people, so that they should not demand the destruction of this just one. He being immediately aware of this through the Spirit, <a name="fr_1427"></a><a href="#fn_1427"><font size="1">1428</font></a>
  and having saluted them all, and begged of them to show a true affection towards him, and having dwelt [on this point] at greater length than in his Epistle, <a name="fr_1428"></a><a href="#fn_1428"><font size="1">1429</font></a>
  and having persuaded them not to envy him hastening to the Lord, he then, after he had, with all the brethren kneeling [beside him], entreated the Son of God in behalf of the Churches, that a stop might be put to the persecution, and that mutual love might continue among the brethren, was led with all haste into the amphitheatre. Then, being immediately thrown in, according to the command of Cæsar given some time ago, the public spectacles being just about to close (for it was then a solemn day, as they deemed it, being that which is called the thirteenth <a name="fr_1429"></a><a href="#fn_1429"><font size="1">1430</font></a>
  in the Roman tongue, on which the people were wont to assemble in more than ordinary numbers <a name="fr_1430"></a><a href="#fn_1430"><font size="1">1431</font></a>
 ), he was thus cast to the wild beasts close beside the temple, <a name="fr_1431"></a><a href="#fn_1431"><font size="1">1432</font></a>
  that so by them the desire of the holy martyr Ignatius should be fulfilled, according to that which is written, “The desire of the righteous is acceptable <a name="fr_1432"></a><a href="#fn_1432"><font size="1">1433</font></a>
  [to God],” to the effect that he might not be troublesome to any of the brethren by the gathering of his remains, even as he had in his Epistle expressed a wish beforehand that so his end might be. For only the harder portions of his holy remains were left, which were conveyed to Antioch and wrapped <a name="fr_1433"></a><a href="#fn_1433"><font size="1">1434</font></a>
  in linen, as an inestimable treasure left to the holy Church by the grace which was in the martyr.</p>
