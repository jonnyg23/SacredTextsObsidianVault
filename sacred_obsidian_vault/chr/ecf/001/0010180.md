 <p> <a name="v.v.iv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.v.iv-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.—Allow me to fall a prey to the wild beasts.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p1"></a><a name="v.v.iv-p1.1"></a>I write to the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die for God, unless ye hinder me. I beseech of you not to show an unseasonable good-will towards me. Suffer me to become food for the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my body; so that when I have fallen asleep [in death], I may be no trouble to any one. Then shall I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these instruments <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">846</font></a>
  I may be found a sacrifice [to God]. I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto you. They were apostles; I am but a condemned man: they were free, <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">847</font></a>
  while I am, even until now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain.</p>

  as the servants of God; while I am, even until now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus Christ, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being in bonds for Him, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain.</p>
