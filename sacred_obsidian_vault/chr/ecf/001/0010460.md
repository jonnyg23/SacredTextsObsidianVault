 <p><a name="viii.iii.xv-p1"></a><a name="viii.iii.xv-p1.1"></a>And I despised the wicked and deceitful doctrine of Simon <a name="fr_1945"></a><a href="#fn_1945"><font size="1">1946</font></a>
  of my own nation. And if you give this book your authority, we will expose him before all, that, if possible, they may be converted. For this end alone did we compose this treatise. <a name="viii.iii.xv-p2.1"></a>And our doctrines are not shameful, according to a sober judgment, but are indeed more lofty than all human philosophy: and if not so, they are at least unlike the doctrines of the Sotadists, and Philænidians, and Dancers, and Epicureans, and such other teachings of the poets, which all are allowed to acquaint themselves with both as acted and as written. And henceforth we shall be silent, having done as much as we could, and having added the prayer that all men everywhere may be counted worthy of the truth. And would that you also, in a manner becoming piety and philosophy, <a name="fr_1946"></a><a href="#fn_1946"><font size="1">1947</font></a>
  would for your own sakes judge justly!</p>
