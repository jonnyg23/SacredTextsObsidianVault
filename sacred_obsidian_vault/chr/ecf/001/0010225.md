 <p> <a name="v.x.ii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.x.ii-p0.1"></a>Chapter II.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.x.ii-p1"></a>If thou lovest the good disciples only, thou hast no grace; [but] rather subdue those that are evil by gentleness. All [sorts of] wounds are not healed by the same medicine. Mitigate [the pain of] cutting <a name="fr_1133"></a><a href="#fn_1133"><font size="1">1134</font></a>
  by tenderness. Be wise as the serpent in everything, and innocent, with respect to those things which are requisite, even as the dove. For this reason thou art [composed] of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest entice <a name="fr_1134"></a><a href="#fn_1134"><font size="1">1135</font></a>
  those things which are visible before thy face, and mayest ask, as to those which are concealed from thee, that they [too] may be revealed to thee, in order that thou be deficient in nothing, and mayest abound in all gifts. The time demands, even as a pilot does a ship, and as one who stands exposed to the tempest does a haven, that thou shouldst be worthy of God. Be thou watchful as an athlete of God. That which is promised to us is life eternal, which cannot be corrupted, of which things thou art also persuaded. In everything I will be instead <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1135"><font size="1">1136</font></a>
  of thy soul, and my bonds which thou hast loved.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.x.ii-p2"></a> Cureton observes, as one alternative here, that “the Syrian translator seems to have read <span class="Greek"><a name="v.x.ii-p2.1"></a>παράξυσμα</span> for <span class="Greek"><a name="v.x.ii-p2.2"></a>παροξυσμούς</span>.”</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.x.ii-p3"></a> Or, “flatter,” probably meaning to “deal gently with.”</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.x.ii-p4"></a> Thus the Syriac renders <span class="Greek"><a name="v.x.ii-p4.1"></a>ἀντίψυχον</span> in the Greek.</p>
