 <p><a name="v.v.ix-p1"></a>Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it, and your love [will also regard it]. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">874</font></a>
  But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. <a name="v.v.ix-p2.2"></a>My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches that have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">875</font></a>
  near to me in the way, I mean according to the flesh, <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">876</font></a>
  have gone before me, <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">877</font></a>
  city by city, [to meet me.]</p>  
 <p><a name="v.v.ix-p6"></a>Remember in your prayers the Church which is in Syria, which, instead of me, has now for its shepherd the Lord, who says, “I am the good Shepherd.” And He alone will oversee it, as well as your love towards Him. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. <a name="v.v.ix-p6.1"></a>My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches which have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not near to me in the way, have brought me forward, city by city.</p>
