 <p><a name="vi.i-p1"></a><a name="vi.i-p1.1"></a>[<span class="upper"><a name="vi.i-p1.2"></a>a.d.</span> 100.] <span class="upper"><a name="vi.i-p1.3"></a>The</span> writer of this Epistle is supposed to have been an Alexandrian Jew of the times of Trajan and Hadrian. He was a layman; but possibly he bore the name of “Barnabas,” and so has been confounded with his holy and apostolic name-sire. It is more probable that the Epistle, being anonymous, was attributed to St. Barnabas, by those who supposed that apostle to be the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and who discovered similarities in the plan and purpose of the two works. It is with great reluctance that I yield to modern scholars, in dismissing the ingenious and temperate argument of Archbishop Wake <a name="fr_1437"></a><a href="#fn_1437"><font size="1">1438</font></a>
  for the apostolic origin of this treatise. The learned Lardner <a name="fr_1438"></a><a href="#fn_1438"><font size="1">1439</font></a>
  shares his convictions; and the very interesting and ingenious views of Jones <a name="fr_1439"></a><a href="#fn_1439"><font size="1">1440</font></a>
  never appeared to me satisfactory, weighed with preponderating arguments, on the other side. <a name="fr_1440"></a><a href="#fn_1440"><font size="1">1441</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p6"></a>The Maccabæan spirit of the Jews never burned more furiously than after the destruction of Jerusalem, and while it was kindling the conflagration that broke out under Barchochebas, and blazed so terribly in the insurrection against Hadrian. <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1441"><font size="1">1442</font></a>
  It is not credible that the Jewish Christians at Alexandria and elsewhere were able to emancipate themselves from their national spirit; and accordingly the old Judaizing, which St. Paul had anathematized and confuted, would assert itself again. If such was the occasion of this Epistle, as I venture to suppose, a higher character must be ascribed to it than could otherwise be claimed. This accounts, also, for the degree of favour with which it was accepted by the primitive faithful.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p8"></a>It is interesting as a specimen of their conflicts with a persistent Judaism which St. Paul had defeated and anathematized, but which was ever cropping out among believers originally of the Hebrews. <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1443</font></a>
  Their own habits of allegorizing, and their Oriental tastes, must be borne in mind, if we are readily disgusted with our authors fancies and refinements. St. Paul himself pays a practical tribute to their modes of thought, in his Epistle to the <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024">Galatians iv. 24</a><a name="vi.i-p9.1"></a>. This is the <i>ad hominem</i> form of rhetoric, familiar to all speakers, which laid even the apostle open to the slander of enemies (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016">2 Cor. xii. 16</a><a name="vi.i-p9.2"></a>),—that he was “crafty,” and caught men with guile. It is interesting to note the more Occidental spirit of Cyprian, as compared with our author, when he also contends with Judaism. Doubtless we have in the pseudo-Barnabas something of that <i>œconomy</i> which  <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a> <a name="vi.i-Page_134"></a>  is always capable of abuse, and which was destined too soon to overleap the bounds of its moral limitations.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p10"></a>It is to be observed that this writer sometimes speaks as a Gentile, a fact which some have found it difficult to account for, on the supposition that he was a Hebrew, if not a Levite as well. But so, also, St. Paul sometimes speaks as a Roman, and sometimes as a Jew; and, owing to the mixed character of the early Church, he writes to the <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001">Romans iv. 1</a><a name="vi.i-p10.1"></a> as if they were all Israelites, and again to the same Church (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013">Rom. xi. 13</a><a name="vi.i-p10.2"></a>) as if they were all Gentiles. So this writer sometimes identifies himself with Jewish thought as a son of Abraham, and again speaks from the Christian position as if he were a Gentile, thus identifying himself with the catholicity of the Church.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p11"></a>But the subject thus opened is vast; and “the Epistle of Barnabas,” so called, still awaits a critical editor, who at the same time shall be a competent expositor. Nobody can answer these requisitions, who is unable, for this purpose, to be a Christian of the days of Trajan.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p12"></a>But it will be observed that this version has great advantages over any of its predecessor, and is a valuable acquisition to the student. The learned translators have had before them the entire Greek text of the fourth century, disfigured is true by corruptions, but still very precious, the rather as they have been able to compare it with the text of Hilgenfeld. Their editorial notes are sufficient for our own plan; and little has been left for me to do, according to the scheme of this publication, save to revise the “copy” for printing. I am glad to presume no further into such a labyrinth, concerning which the learned and careful Wake modestly professes, “I have endeavoured to attain to the sense of my author, and to make him as plain and easy as I was able. If in anything I have chanced to mistake him, I have only this to say for myself: that he must be better acquainted with the road than I pretend to be, who will undertake to travel so long a journey in the dark and never to miss his way.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p13"></a>The following is the original <span class="upper"><a name="vi.i-p13.1"></a>Introductory Notice</span>:—</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p14"></a><span class="upper"><a name="vi.i-p14.1"></a>Nothing</span> certain is known as to the author of the following Epistle. The writers name is Barnabas, but scarcely any scholars now ascribe it to the illustrious friend and companion of St. Paul. External and internal evidence here come into direct collision. The ancient writers who refer to this Epistle unanimously attribute it to Barnabas the Levite, of Cyprus, who held such an honourable place in the infant Church. Clement of Alexandria does so again and again (<i>Strom.</i>, ii. 6, ii. 7, etc.). Origen describes it as “a Catholic Epistle” (<i>Cont. Cels.</i>, i. 63), and seems to rank it among the Sacred Scriptures (<i>Comm. in Rom.</i>, i. 24). Other statements have been quoted from the fathers, to show that they held this to be an authentic production of the apostolic Barnabas; and certainly no other name is ever hinted at in Christian antiquity as that of the writer. But notwithstanding this, the internal evidence is now generally regarded as conclusive against this opinion. On perusing the Epistle, the reader will be in circumstances to judge of this matter for himself. He will be led to consider whether the spirit and tone of the writing, as so decidedly opposed to all respect for Judaism—the numerous inaccuracies which it contains with respect to Mosaic enactments and observances —the absurd and trifling interpretations of Scripture which it suggests—and the many silly vaunts of superior knowledge in which its writer indulges—can possibly comport with its ascription to the fellow—labourer of St. Paul. When it is remembered that no one ascribes the Epistle to the apostolic Barnabas till the times of Clement of Alexandria, and that it is ranked by Eusebius among the “spurious” writings, which, however much known and read in the Church, were never regarded as authoritative, little doubt can remain that the external evidence is of itself weak, and should not make us hesitate for a moment in refusing to ascribe this writing to Barnabas the Apostle.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p15"></a>The date, object, and intended reader of the Epistle can only be doubtfully inferred from some statements which it contains. It was clearly written after the destruction of Jerusalem,  <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a> <a name="vi.i-Page_135"></a>  since reference is made to that event (chap. xvi.), but how long after is matter of much dispute. The general opinion is, that its date is not later than the middle of the second century, and that it cannot be placed earlier than some twenty or thirty years before. In point of style, both as respects thought and expression, a very low place must be assigned it. We know nothing certain of the region in which the author lived, or where the first readers were to be found. The intention of the writer, as he himself states (chap. i), was “to perfect the knowledge” of those to whom he wrote. Hilgenfeld, who has devoted much attention to this Epistle, holds that “it was written at the close of the first century by a Gentile Christian of the school of Alexandria, with the view of winning back, or guarding from a Judaic form of Christianity, those Christians belonging to the same class as himself.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.i-p16"></a>Until the recent discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, the first four and a half chapters were known only in an ancient Latin version. The whole Greek text is now happily recovered, though it is in many places very corrupt. We have compared its readings throughout, and noted the principal variations from the text represented in our version. We have also made frequent reference to the text adopted by Hilgenfeld in his recent edition of the Epistle (Lipsiæ, T. O. Weigel, 1886).  <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a> <a name="vi.i-Page_136"></a>  </p>
