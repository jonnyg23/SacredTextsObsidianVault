 <p><a name="ii.ii.ix-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.ix-p1.1"></a>Wherefore, let us yield obedience to His excellent and glorious will; and imploring His mercy and loving-kindness, while we forsake all fruitless labours, <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">43</font></a>
  and strife, and envy, which leads to death, let us turn and have recourse to His compassions. Let us stedfastly contemplate those who have perfectly ministered to His excellent glory. <a name="ii.ii.ix-p2.2"></a>Let us take (for instance) Enoch, who, being found righteous in obedience, was translated, and death was never known to happen to him. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">44</font></a>
  Noah, being found faithful, preached regeneration to the world through his ministry; and the Lord saved by him the animals which, with one accord, entered into the ark.</p>
