 <p> <a name="viii.vii.iii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.vii.iii-p0.1"></a>Chapter III.—Testimonies to a future judgment.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.vii.iii-p1"></a><a name="viii.vii.iii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.vii.iii-p1.2"></a>Then further concerning Him, that He alone is powerful, both to institute judgment on the deeds performed in life, and on the ignorance of the Deity [displayed by men], I can adduce witnesses from your own ranks; and first Sophocles, <a name="fr_2599"></a><a href="#fn_2599"><font size="1">2600</font></a>
  who speaks as follows:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.iii-p2.2"></a>“That time of times shall come, shall surely come,<br>  When from the golden ether down shall fall<br>  Fires teeming treasure, and in burning flames<br>  All things of earth and heaven shall be consumed;<br>  And then, when all creation is dissolved,<br>  The seas last wave shall die upon the shore,<br>  The bald earth stript of trees, the burning air<br>  No winged thing upon its breast shall bear.<br>  There are two roads to Hades, well we know; <a name="fr_2600"></a><a href="#fn_2600"><font size="1">2601</font></a>
  <br>  By this the righteous, and by that the bad,<br>  On to their separate fates shall tend; and He,<br>  Who all things had destroyed, shall all things save.”<br> </blockquote>  
 <p><a name="viii.vii.iii-p4"></a><a name="viii.vii.iii-p4.1"></a>And Philemon <a name="fr_2601"></a><a href="#fn_2601"><font size="1">2602</font></a>
  again:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.iii-p5.1"></a>“Thinkst thou, Nicostratus, the dead, who here<br>  Enjoyed whateer of good life often man,<br>  Escape the notice of Divinity,<br>  As if they might forgotten be of Him?<br>  Nay, theres an eye of Justice watching all;<br>  For if the good and bad find the same end,<br>  Then go thou, rob, steal, plunder, at thy will,<br>  Do all the evil that to thee seems good.<br>  Yet be not thou deceived; for underneath<br>  There is a throne and place of judgment set,<br>  Which God the Lord of all shall occupy;<br>  Whose name is terrible, nor shall I dare<br>  To breathe it forth in feeble human speech.”<br> </blockquote>  
 <p><a name="viii.vii.iii-p6"></a><a name="viii.vii.iii-p6.1"></a>And Euripides: <a name="fr_2602"></a><a href="#fn_2602"><font size="1">2603</font></a>
 —</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.iii-p7.1"></a>“Not grudgingly he gives a lease of life,<br>  That we the holders may be fairly judged;<br>  And if a mortal man doth think to hide<br>  His daily guilt from the keen eye of God,<br>  It is an evil thought; so if perchance<br>  He meets with leisure-taking Justice, she<br>  Demands him as her lawful prisoner:<br>  But many of you hastily commit<br>  A twofold sin, and say there is no God.<br>  But, ah! there is; there is. Then see that he<br>  Who, being wicked, prospers, may redeem<br>  The time so precious, else hereafter waits<br>  For him the due reward of punishment.”<br> </blockquote>
