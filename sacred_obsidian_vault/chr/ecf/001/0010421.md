 <p><a name="viii.ii.xlviii-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.xlviii-p1.1"></a>And that it was predicted that our Christ  <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a> <a name="viii.ii.xlviii-Page_179"></a>  should heal all diseases and raise the dead, hear what was said. <a name="viii.ii.xlviii-p1.2"></a>There are these words: “At His coming the lame shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerer shall be clear speaking: the blind shall see, and the lepers shall be cleansed; and the dead shall rise, and walk about.” <a name="fr_1866"></a><a href="#fn_1866"><font size="1">1867</font></a>
  And that He did those things, you can learn from the Acts of Pontius Pilate. And how it was predicted by the Spirit of prophecy that He and those who hoped in Him should be slain, hear what was said by Isaiah. These are the words: “Behold now the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth. From the presence of wickedness is the righteous man taken, and his burial shall be in peace: he is taken from our midst.” <a name="fr_1867"></a><a href="#fn_1867"><font size="1">1868</font></a>
