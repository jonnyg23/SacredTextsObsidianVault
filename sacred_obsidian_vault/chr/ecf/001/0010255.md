 <p><a name="v.xiv.iii-p1"></a>Mindful of him, do ye by all means know that Jesus the Lord was truly born of Mary, being made of a woman; and was as truly crucified. For, says he, “God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus.” <a name="fr_1186"></a><a href="#fn_1186"><font size="1">1187</font></a>
  And He really suffered, and died, and rose again. For says [Paul], “If Christ should become passible, and should be the first to rise again from the dead.” <a name="fr_1187"></a><a href="#fn_1187"><font size="1">1188</font></a>
  And again, “In that He died, He died unto sin once: but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God.” <a name="fr_1188"></a><a href="#fn_1188"><font size="1">1189</font></a>
  Otherwise, what advantage would there be in [becoming subject to] bonds, if Christ has not died? what advantage in patience? what advantage in [enduring] stripes? And why such facts as the following: Peter was crucified; Paul and James were slain with the sword; John was banished to Patmos; Stephen was stoned to death by the Jews who killed the Lord? But, [in truth,] none of these sufferings were in vain; for the Lord was really crucified by the ungodly.</p>
