 <p> <a name="viii.ii.xlv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.ii.xlv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XLV.—Christs session in heaven foretold.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.ii.xlv-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.xlv-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.ii.xlv-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.ii.xlv-p1.3"></a>And that God the Father of all would bring Christ to heaven after He had raised Him from the dead, and would keep Him there <a name="fr_1859"></a><a href="#fn_1859"><font size="1">1860</font></a>
  until He has subdued His enemies the devils, and until the number of those who are foreknown by Him as good and virtuous is complete, on whose account He has still delayed the consummation—hear what was said by the prophet David. These are his words: “The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The Lord shall send to Thee the rod of power out of Jerusalem; and rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies. With Thee is the government in the day of Thy power, in the beauties of Thy saints: from the womb of morning <a name="fr_1860"></a><a href="#fn_1860"><font size="1">1861</font></a>
  have I begotten Thee.” <a name="fr_1861"></a><a href="#fn_1861"><font size="1">1862</font></a>
  That which he says, “He shall send to Thee the rod of power out of Jerusalem,” is predictive of the mighty, word, which His apostles, going forth from Jerusalem, preached everywhere; and though death is decreed against those who teach or at all confess the name of Christ, we everywhere both embrace and teach it. And if you also read these words in a hostile spirit, ye can do no more, as I said before, than kill us; which indeed does no harm to us, but to you and all who unjustly hate us, and do not repent, brings eternal punishment by fire.</p>
