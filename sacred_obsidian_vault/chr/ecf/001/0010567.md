 <p> <a name="viii.iv.cvi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.cvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter CVI.—Christs resurrection is foretold in the conclusion of the Psalm.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.cvi-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cvi-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cvi-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.cvi-p1.3"></a>“The remainder of the Psalm makes it manifest that He knew His Father would grant to Him all things which He asked, and would raise Him from the dead; and that He urged all who fear God to praise Him because He had compassion on all races of believing men, through the mystery of Him who was crucified; and that He stood in the midst of His brethren the apostles (who repented of their flight from Him when He was crucified, after He rose from the dead, and after they were persuaded by Himself that, before His passion He had mentioned to them that He must suffer these things, and that they were announced beforehand by the prophets), and when living with them sang praises to God, as is made evident in the memoirs of the apostles. The words are the following: I will declare Thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I praise Thee. Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him; all ye, the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of Israel fear Him. And when it is said that He changed the name of one of the apostles to Peter; and when it is written in the memoirs of Him that this so happened, as well as that He changed the names of other two brothers, the sons of Zebedee, to Boanerges, which means sons of thunder; this was an announcement of the fact that it was He by whom Jacob was called Israel, and Oshea called Jesus (Joshua), under whose name the people who survived of those that came from Egypt were conducted into the land promised to the patriarchs. And that He should arise like a star from the seed of Abraham, Moses showed before hand when he thus said, A star shall arise from Jacob, and a leader from Israel; <a name="fr_2356"></a><a href="#fn_2356"><font size="1">2357</font></a>
  and another Scripture says, Behold a man; the East is His name. <a name="fr_2357"></a><a href="#fn_2357"><font size="1">2358</font></a>
  Accordingly, when a star rose in heaven at the time of His birth, as is recorded in the memoirs of His apostles, the Magi from Arabia, recognising the sign by this, came and worshipped Him.</p>
