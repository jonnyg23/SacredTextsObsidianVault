 <p><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p1.2"></a>But we, after we have thus washed him who has been convinced and has assented to our teaching, bring him to the place where those who are called brethren are assembled, in order that we may offer hearty prayers in common for ourselves and for the baptized [illuminated] person, and for all others in every place, that we may be counted worthy, now that we have learned the truth, by our works also to be found good citizens and keepers of the commandments, so that we may be saved with an everlasting salvation. Having ended the prayers, we salute one another with a kiss. <a name="fr_1907"></a><a href="#fn_1907"><font size="1">1908</font></a>
  <a name="viii.ii.lxv-p2.2"></a>There is then brought to the president of the brethren <a name="fr_1908"></a><a href="#fn_1908"><font size="1">1909</font></a>
  bread and a cup of wine mixed with water; and he taking them, gives praise and glory to the Father of the universe, through the name of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and offers thanks at considerable length for our being counted worthy to receive these things at His hands. And when he has concluded the prayers and thanksgivings, all the people present express their assent by saying Amen. This word Amen answers in the Hebrew language to <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p3.2"></a>γένοιτο</span> [so be it]. And when the president has given thanks, and all the people have expressed their assent, those who are called by us deacons give to each of those present to partake of the bread and wine mixed with water over which the thanksgiving was pronounced, and to those who are absent they carry away a portion.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p2"></a> The kiss of charity, the kiss of peace, or “the peace” (<span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p2.1"></a>ἡ εἰπήνη</span>), was enjoined by the Apostle Paul in his Epistles to the Corinthians, Thessalonians, and Romans, and thence passed into a common Christian usage. It was continued in the Western Church, under regulations to prevent its abuse, until the thirteenth century. Stanley remarks (<i>Corinthians</i>, i. 414), “It is still continued in the worship of the Coptic Church.”</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p3"></a> <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.lxv-p3.1"></a>τῷ προεστῶτι τῶν ἀδελφῶν</span>. This expression may quite legitimately be translated, “to that one of the brethren who was presiding.”</p>
