 <p> <a name="v.vii.xi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.vii.xi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XI.—Request to them to send a messenger to Antioch.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.vii.xi-p1"></a><a name="v.vii.xi-p1.1"></a>Your prayer has reached to the Church which is at Antioch in Syria. Coming from that place bound with chains, most acceptable to God, <a name="fr_1044"></a><a href="#fn_1044"><font size="1">1045</font></a>
  I salute all; I who am not worthy to be styled from thence, inasmuch as I am the least of them. Nevertheless, according to the will of God, I have been thought worthy [of this honour], not that I have any sense <a name="fr_1045"></a><a href="#fn_1045"><font size="1">1046</font></a>
  [of having deserved it], but by the grace of God, which I wish may be perfectly given to me, that through your prayers I may attain to God. In order, therefore, that your work may be complete both on earth and in heaven, it is fitting that, for the honour of God, your Church should elect some worthy delegate; <a name="fr_1046"></a><a href="#fn_1046"><font size="1">1047</font></a>
  so that he, journeying into Syria, may congratulate them that they are [now] at peace, and are restored to <a name="fr_1047"></a><a href="#fn_1047"><font size="1">1048</font></a>
  their proper greatness, and that their proper constitution <a name="fr_1048"></a><a href="#fn_1048"><font size="1">1049</font></a>
  has been re-established among them. It seems then to me a becoming thing, that you should send some one of your number with an epistle, so that, in company with them, he may rejoice <a name="fr_1049"></a><a href="#fn_1049"><font size="1">1050</font></a>
  over the tranquility which, according to the will of God, they have obtained, and because that, through your prayers, they have now reached the harbour. As persons who are perfect, ye should also aim at <a name="fr_1050"></a><a href="#fn_1050"><font size="1">1051</font></a>
  those things which are perfect. For when ye are desirous to do well, God is also ready to assist you.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.vii.xi-p9"></a><a name="v.vii.xi-p9.1"></a>Your prayers have reached to the Church of Antioch, and it is at peace. Coming from that place bound, I salute all; I who am not worthy to be styled from thence, inasmuch as I am the least of them. Nevertheless, according to the will of God, I have been thought worthy [of this honour], not that I have any sense <a name="fr_1051"></a><a href="#fn_1051"><font size="1">1052</font></a>
  [of having deserved it], but by the grace of God, which I wish may be perfectly given to me, that through your prayers I may attain to God. In order, therefore, that your work may be complete both on earth and in heaven, it is fitting that, for the honour of God, your Church should elect some worthy delegate; <a name="fr_1052"></a><a href="#fn_1052"><font size="1">1053</font></a>
  so that he, journeying into Syria, may congratulate them that they are [now] at peace, and are restored to their proper greatness, and that their proper constitution <a name="fr_1053"></a><a href="#fn_1053"><font size="1">1054</font></a>
  has been re-established among them. What appears to me proper to be done is this, that you should send some one of your number with an epistle, so that, in company with them, he may rejoice over the tranquillity which, according to the will of God, they have obtained, and because that, through your prayers, I have secured Christ as a safe harbour. As persons who are perfect, ye should also aim at <a name="fr_1054"></a><a href="#fn_1054"><font size="1">1055</font></a>
  those things which are perfect. For when ye are desirous to do well, God is also ready to assist you.</p>
