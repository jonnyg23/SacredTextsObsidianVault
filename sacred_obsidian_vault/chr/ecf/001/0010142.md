 <p><a name="v.ii.xix-p1"></a><a name="v.ii.xix-p1.1"></a><a name="v.ii.xix-p1.2"></a><a name="v.ii.xix-p1.3"></a>Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as was also her offspring, and the death of the Lord; three mysteries of renown, <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">613</font></a>
  which were wrought in silence by <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">614</font></a>
  God. How, then, was He manifested to the world? <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">615</font></a>
  A star shone forth in heaven above all the other stars, the light of which was inexpressible, while its novelty struck men with astonishment. And all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star, and its light was exceedingly great above them all. And there was agitation felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to everything else [in the heavens]. Hence every kind of magic was destroyed, and every bond of wickedness disappeared; ignorance was removed, and the old kingdom abolished, God Himself being manifested in human form for the renewal of eternal life. And now that took a beginning which had been prepared by God. Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition of death.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.ii.xix-p5"></a><a name="v.ii.xix-p5.1"></a><a name="v.ii.xix-p5.2"></a>Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as was also her offspring, and the death of the Lord; three mysteries of renown, <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">616</font></a>
  which were wrought in silence, but have been revealed to us. A star shone forth in heaven above all that were before it, and its light was inexpressible, while its novelty struck men with astonishment. And all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star. It far exceeded them all in brightness, and agitation was felt as to whence this new spectacle [proceeded]. Hence worldly wisdom became folly; conjuration was seen to be mere trifling; and magic became utterly ridiculous. Every law <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">617</font></a>
  of wickedness vanished away; the darkness of ignorance was dispersed; and tyrannical authority was destroyed, God being manifested as a man, and man displaying power as God. But neither was the former a mere imagination, <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">618</font></a>
  nor did the second imply a bare humanity; <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">619</font></a>
  but the one was absolutely true, <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">620</font></a>
  and the other an economical arrangement. <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">621</font></a>
  Now that received a beginning which was perfected by God. <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">622</font></a>
  Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition of death.</p>
