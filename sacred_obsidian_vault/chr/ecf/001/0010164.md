 <p> <a name="v.iv.ii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.iv.ii-p0.1"></a>Chapter II.—Be subject to the bishop, etc.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.iv.ii-p1"></a><a name="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></a>For, since ye are subject to the bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye appear to me to live not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for us, in order, by believing in His death, ye may escape from death. <a name="v.iv.ii-p1.2"></a><a name="v.iv.ii-p1.3"></a>It is therefore necessary that, as ye indeed do, so without the bishop ye should do nothing, but should also  <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a> <a name="v.iv.ii-Page_67"></a>  be subject to the presbytery, as to the apostle of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall [at last] be found. It is fitting also that the deacons, as being [the ministers] of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in every respect be pleasing to all. <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">735</font></a>
  For they are not ministers of meat and drink, but servants of the Church of God. <a name="v.iv.ii-p2.1"></a>They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation [against them], as they would do fire.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.iv.ii-p3"></a>Be ye subject to the bishop as to the Lord, for “he watches for your souls, as one that shall give account to God.” <a name="fr_735"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">736</font></a>
  <a name="v.iv.ii-p4.2"></a>Wherefore also, ye appear to me to live not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for us, in order that, by believing in His death, ye may by baptism be made partakers of His resurrection. It is therefore necessary, whatsoever things ye do, to do nothing without the bishop. <a name="v.iv.ii-p4.3"></a><a name="v.iv.ii-p4.4"></a>And be ye subject also to the presbytery, as to the apostles of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall be found in Him. It behoves you also, in every way, to please the deacons, who are [ministers] of the mysteries of Christ Jesus; for they are not ministers of meat and drink, but servants of the Church of God. <a name="v.iv.ii-p4.5"></a>They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation [against them], as they would a burning fire. Let them, then, prove themselves to be such.</p>
