 <p><a name="v.x.v-p1"></a>Flee wicked arts; but all the more discourse regarding them. <a name="v.x.v-p1.1"></a>Speak to my sisters, that they love in our Lord, and that their husbands be sufficient for them in the flesh and spirit. Then, again, charge my brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they love their wives, as our Lord His Church. If any man is able in power to continue in purity, <a name="fr_1139"></a><a href="#fn_1139"><font size="1">1140</font></a>
  to the honour of the flesh of our Lord, let him continue so without boasting; if he boasts, he is undone; if he become known apart from the bishop, he has destroyed himself. <a name="fr_1140"></a><a href="#fn_1140"><font size="1">1141</font></a>
  It is becoming, therefore, to men and women who marry, that they marry with the counsel of the bishop, that the marriage may be in our Lord, and not in lust. Let everything, therefore, be [done] for the honour of God.</p>
