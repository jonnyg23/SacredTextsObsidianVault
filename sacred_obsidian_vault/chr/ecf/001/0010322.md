  Ignatius to the Christ-bearing Mary.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.xxii.i-p2"></a><a name="v.xxii.i-p2.1"></a><a name="v.xxii.i-p2.2"></a><a name="v.xxii.i-p2.3"></a><span class="upper"><a name="v.xxii.i-p2.4"></a>Thou</span> oughtest to have comforted and consoled me who am a neophyte, and a disciple of thy [beloved] John. For I have heard things wonderful to tell respecting thy [son] Jesus, and I am astonished by such a report. But I desire with my whole heart to obtain information concerning the things which I have heard from thee, who wast always intimate and allied with Him, and who wast acquainted with [all] His secrets. I have also written to thee at another time, and have asked thee concerning the same things. Fare thou well; and let the neophytes who are with me be comforted of thee, and by thee, and in thee. Amen.</p>
