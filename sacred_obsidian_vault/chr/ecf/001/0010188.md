 <p> <a name="v.vi.i"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.vi.i-p0.1"></a>Chapter I.—Praise of the bishop.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.vi.i-p1"></a><span class="upper"><a name="v.vi.i-p1.1"></a>Which</span> bishop, <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">884</font></a>
  I know, obtained the ministry which pertains to the common [weal], not of himself, neither by men, <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">885</font></a>
  nor through vainglory, but by the love of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ; at whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by his silence is able to accomplish more than those who vainly talk. For he is in harmony with the commandments [of God], even as the harp is with its strings. Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all anger is after the example of the infinite <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">886</font></a>
  meekness of the living God.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.vi.i-p5"></a><span class="upper"><a name="v.vi.i-p5.1"></a>Having</span> beheld your bishop, I know that he was not selected to undertake the ministry which pertains to the common [weal], either by himself or by men, <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">887</font></a>
  or out of vainglory, but by the love of Jesus Christ, and of God the Father, who raised Him from the dead; at whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by His silence is able to accomplish more than they who talk a great deal. For he is in harmony with the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, even as the strings are with the harp, and is no less blameless than was Zacharias the priest. <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">888</font></a>
  Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all anger is after the example of the infinite meekness of the living God.</p>
