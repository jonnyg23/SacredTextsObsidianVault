 <p><a name="v.xviii.iv-p1"></a>Moreover, the wise Daniel, while he was a young man, passed judgment on certain vigorous old man, <a name="fr_1364"></a><a href="#fn_1364"><font size="1">1365</font></a>
  showing them that they were abandoned wretches, and not [worthy to be reckoned] elders, and that, though Jews by extraction, they were Canaanites in practice. And Jeremiah, when on account of his youth he declined the office of a prophet entrusted to him by God, was addressed in these words: “Say not, I am a youth; for thou shalt go to all those to whom I send thee, and thou shalt speak according to all that I command thee; because I am with thee.” <a name="fr_1365"></a><a href="#fn_1365"><font size="1">1366</font></a>
  And the wise Solomon, when only in the twelfth year of his age, <a name="fr_1366"></a><a href="#fn_1366"><font size="1">1367</font></a>
  had wisdom to decide the important question concerning the children of the two women, <a name="fr_1367"></a><a href="#fn_1367"><font size="1">1368</font></a>
  when it was unknown to whom these respectively belonged; so that the whole people were astonished at such wisdom in a child, and venerated him as being not a mere youth, but a full-grown man. And he solved the hard questions of the queen of the Ethiopians, which had profit in them as the streams of the Nile [have fertility], in such a manner that that woman,  <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a> <a name="v.xviii.iv-Page_121"></a>  though herself so wise, was beyond measure astonished. <a name="fr_1368"></a><a href="#fn_1368"><font size="1">1369</font></a>
