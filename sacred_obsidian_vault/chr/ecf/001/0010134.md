 <p><a name="v.ii.xi-p1"></a><a name="v.ii.xi-p1.1"></a>The last times are come upon us. <a name="v.ii.xi-p1.2"></a>Let us therefore be of a reverent spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, that it tend not to our condemnation. For let us either stand in awe of the wrath to come, or show regard for the grace which is at present displayed— one of two things. Only [in one way or another] let us be found in Christ Jesus unto the true life. <a name="v.ii.xi-p1.3"></a>Apart from Him, let nothing attract <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">568</font></a>
  you, for whom I bear about these bonds, these spiritual jewels, by which may I arise through your prayers, of which I entreat I may always be a partaker, that I may be found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who have always been of the same mind with the apostles through the power of Jesus Christ.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.ii.xi-p3"></a><a name="v.ii.xi-p3.1"></a>The last times are come upon us. <a name="v.ii.xi-p3.2"></a>Let us therefore be of a reverent spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, lest we despise the riches of His goodness and forbearance. <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">569</font></a>
  For let us either fear the wrath to come, or let us love the present joy in the life that now is; and let our present and true joy be only this, to be found in Christ Jesus, that we may truly live. Do not at any time desire so much as even to breathe apart from Him. <a name="v.ii.xi-p4.2"></a>For He is my hope; He is my boast; He is my never-failing riches, on whose account I bear about with me these bonds from Syria to Rome, these spiritual jewels, in which may I be perfected through your prayers, and become a partaker of the sufferings of Christ, and have fellowship with Him in His death, His resurrection from the dead, and His everlasting life. <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">570</font></a>
  May I attain to this, so that I may be found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who have always had intercourse with the apostles by the power of Jesus Christ, with Paul, and John, and Timothy the most faithful.</p>
