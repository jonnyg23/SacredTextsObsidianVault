 <p><a name="viii.ii.xxxix-p1"></a>And when the Spirit of prophecy speaks as predicting things that are to come to pass, He speaks in this way: “For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” <a name="fr_1848"></a><a href="#fn_1848"><font size="1">1849</font></a>
  And that it did so come to pass, we can convince you. <a name="viii.ii.xxxix-p2.2"></a>For from Jerusalem there went out into the world, men, twelve in number, and these illiterate, of no ability in speaking: but by the power of God they proclaimed to every race of men that they were sent  <a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a> <a name="viii.ii.xxxix-Page_176"></a>  by Christ to teach to all the word of God; and we who formerly used to murder one another do not only now refrain from making war upon our enemies, but also, that we may not lie nor deceive our examiners, willingly die confessing Christ. For that saying, “The tongue has sworn but the mind is unsworn,” <a name="fr_1849"></a><a href="#fn_1849"><font size="1">1850</font></a>
  might be imitated by us in this matter. But if the soldiers enrolled by you, and who have taken the military oath, prefer their allegiance to their own life, and parents, and country, and all kindred, though you can offer them nothing incorruptible, it were verily ridiculous if we, who earnestly long for incorruption, should not endure all things, in order to obtain what we desire from Him who is able to grant it.</p>
