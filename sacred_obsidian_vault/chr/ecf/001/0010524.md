 <p> <a name="viii.iv.lxiii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter LXIII.—It is proved that this God was incarnate.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lxiii-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxiii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxiii-p1.2"></a>And Trypho said, “This point has been proved to me forcibly, and by many arguments, my friend. It remains, then, to prove that He submitted to become man by the Virgin, according to the will of His Father; and to be crucified, and to die. Prove also clearly, that after this He rose again and ascended to heaven.”</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lxiii-p2"></a>I answered, “This, too, has been already demonstrated  <a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.lxiii-Page_229"></a>  by me in the previously quoted words of the prophecies, my friends; which, by recalling and expounding for your sakes, I shall endeavour to lead you to agree with me also about this matter. The passage, then, which Isaiah records, Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken away from the earth, <a name="fr_2178"></a><a href="#fn_2178"><font size="1">2179</font></a>
 —does it not appear to you to refer to One who, not having descent from men, was said to be delivered over to death by God for the transgressions of the people?—of whose blood, Moses (as I mentioned before), when speaking in parable, said, that He would wash His garments in the blood of the grape; since His blood did not spring from the seed of man, but from the will of God. <a name="viii.iv.lxiii-p3.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxiii-p3.3"></a>And then, what is said by David, In the splendours of Thy holiness have I begotten Thee from the womb, before the morning star. <a name="fr_2179"></a><a href="#fn_2179"><font size="1">2180</font></a>
  The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,  <a name="fr_2180"></a><a href="#fn_2180"><font size="1">2181</font></a>
 —does this not declare to you <a name="fr_2181"></a><a href="#fn_2181"><font size="1">2182</font></a>
  that [He was] from of old, <a name="fr_2182"></a><a href="#fn_2182"><font size="1">2183</font></a>
  and that the God and Father of all things intended Him to be begotten by a human womb? And speaking in other words, which also have been already quoted, [he says]: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of rectitude is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast hated iniquity: therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. [He hath anointed Thee] with myrrh, and oil, and cassia from Thy garments, from the ivory palaces, whereby they made Thee glad. Kings daughters are in Thy honour. The queen stood at Thy right hand, clad in garments embroidered with gold. <a name="fr_2183"></a><a href="#fn_2183"><font size="1">2184</font></a>
  Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and the house of thy father; and the King shall desire thy beauty: because he is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship Him. <a name="fr_2184"></a><a href="#fn_2184"><font size="1">2185</font></a>
  Therefore these words testify explicitly that He is witnessed to by Him who established these things, <a name="fr_2185"></a><a href="#fn_2185"><font size="1">2186</font></a>
  as deserving to be worshipped, as God and as Christ. Moreover, that the word of God speaks to those who believe in Him as being one soul, and one synagogue, and one church, as to a daughter; that it thus addresses the church which has sprung from His name and partakes of His name (for we are all called Christians), is distinctly proclaimed in like manner in the following words, which teach us also to forget [our] old ancestral customs, when they speak thus: <a name="fr_2186"></a><a href="#fn_2186"><font size="1">2187</font></a>
  Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline thine ear; forget thy people and the house of thy father, and the King shall desire thy beauty: because He is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship Him. ”</p>
