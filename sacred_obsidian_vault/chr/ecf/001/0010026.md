 <p><a name="ii.ii.xxi-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxi-p1.1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxi-p1.2"></a>Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us all. [For thus it must be] unless we walk worthy of Him, and with one mind do those things which are good and well-pleasing in His sight. <a name="ii.ii.xxi-p1.3"></a>For [the Scripture] saith in a certain place, “The Spirit of the Lord is a candle searching the secret parts of the belly.” <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">90</font></a>
  Let us reflect how near He is, and that none of the thoughts or reasonings in which we engage are hid from Him. It is right, therefore, that we should not leave the post which His will has assigned us. <a name="ii.ii.xxi-p2.2"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxi-p2.3"></a>Let us rather offend those men who are foolish, and inconsiderate, and lifted up, and who glory in the pride of their speech, than [offend] God. Let us reverence the Lord Jesus Christ, whose blood was given for us; let us esteem those who have the rule over us; <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">91</font></a>
  let us honour the aged <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">92</font></a>
  among us; let us train up the young men in the fear of God; let us direct our wives to that which is good. Let them exhibit the lovely habit of purity [in all their conduct]; let them show forth the sincere disposition of meekness; let them make manifest the command which they have of their tongue, by their manner <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">93</font></a>
  of speaking; let them display their love, not by preferring <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">94</font></a>
  one to another, but by showing equal affection to all that piously fear God. Let your children be partakers of true Christian training; let them learn of how great avail humility is with God—how much the spirit of pure affection can prevail with Him—how excellent and great His fear is, and how it saves all those who walk in <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">95</font></a>
  it with a pure mind. For He is a Searcher of the thoughts and desires [of the heart]: His breath is in us; and when He pleases, He will take it away.</p>
