 <p> <a name="viii.ii.liv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.ii.liv-p0.1"></a>Chapter LIV.—Origin of heathen mythology.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.ii.liv-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.liv-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.ii.liv-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.ii.liv-p1.3"></a><a name="viii.ii.liv-p1.4"></a><a name="viii.ii.liv-p1.5"></a>But those who hand down the myths which the poets have made, adduce no proof to the youths who learn them; and we proceed to demonstrate that they have been uttered by the influence of the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the human race. For having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come, and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were said with regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things which were said by the poets. And these things were said both among the Greeks and among all nations where they [the demons] heard the prophets foretelling that Christ would specially be believed in; but that in hearing what was said by the prophets they did not accurately understand it, but imitated what was said of our Christ, like men who are in error, we will make plain. The prophet Moses, then, was, as we have already said, older than all writers; and by him, as we have also said before, it was thus predicted: “There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it is reserved; and He shall be the desire of the Gentiles, binding His foal to the vine, washing His robe in the blood of the grape.” <a name="fr_1881"></a><a href="#fn_1881"><font size="1">1882</font></a>
  The devils, accordingly, when they heard these prophetic words, said that Bacchus was the son of Jupiter, and gave out that he was the discoverer of the vine, and they number wine <a name="fr_1882"></a><a href="#fn_1882"><font size="1">1883</font></a>
  [or, the ass] among his mysteries; and they taught that, having been torn in pieces, he ascended into heaven. And because in the prophecy of Moses it had not been expressly intimated whether He who was to come was the Son of God, and whether He would, riding on the foal, remain on earth or ascend into heaven, and because the name of “foal” could mean either the foal of an ass or the foal of a horse, they, not knowing whether He who was foretold would bring the foal of an ass or of a horse as the sign of His coming, nor whether He was the Son of God, as we said above, or of man, gave out that Bellerophon, a man born of man, himself ascended to heaven on his horse Pegasus. And when they heard it said by the other prophet Isaiah, that He should be born of a virgin, and by His own means ascend into heaven, they pretended that Perseus was spoken of. And when they knew what was said, as has been cited above, in the prophecies written aforetime, “Strong as a giant to run his course,” <a name="fr_1883"></a><a href="#fn_1883"><font size="1">1884</font></a>
  they said that Hercules was strong, and had journeyed over the whole earth. And when, again, they learned that it had been foretold that He should heal every sickness, and raise the dead, they produced Æsculapius.</p>

It may be added, that <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.liv-p3.4"></a>ἀναγράφουσι</span> is much more suitable to <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.liv-p3.5"></a>ὄνον</span> than to <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.liv-p3.6"></a>οἶνον</span>.</p>
