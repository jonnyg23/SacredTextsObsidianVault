 <p><a name="iv.i-p1"></a><a name="iv.i-p1.1"></a>[<span class="upper"><a name="iv.i-p1.2"></a>a.d.</span> 65–100–155.] <span class="upper"><a name="iv.i-p1.3"></a>The</span> Epistle of Polycarp is usually made a sort of preface to those of Ignatius, for reasons which will be obvious to the reader. Yet he was born later, and lived to a much later period. They seem to have been friends from the days of their common pupilage under St. John; and there is nothing improbable in the conjecture of Usher, that he was the “angel of the church in Smyrna,” to whom the Master says, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” His pupil Irenæus gives us one of the very few portraits of an apostolic man which are to be found in antiquity, in a few sentences which are a picture: “I could describe the very place in which the blessed Polycarp sat and taught; his going out and coming in; the whole tenor of his life; his personal appearance; how he would speak of the conversations he had held with John and with others who had seen the Lord. How did he make mention of their words and of whatever he had heard from them respecting the Lord.” Thus he unconsciously tantalizes our reverent curiosity. Alas! that such conversations were not written for our learning. But there is a wise Providence in what is withheld, as well as in the inestimable treasures we have received.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p2"></a>Irenæus will tell us more concerning him, his visit to Rome, his rebuke of Marcion, and incidental anecdotes, all which are instructive. The expression which he applied to Marcion is found in this Epistle. Other facts of interest are found in the Martyrdom, which follows in these pages. His death, in extreme old age under the first of the Antonines, has been variously dated; but we may accept the date we have given, as rendered probable by that of the Paschal question, which he so lovingly settled with Anicetus, Bishop of Rome.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p3"></a>The Epistle to the Philippians is the more interesting as denoting the state of that beloved church, the firstborn of European churches, and so greatly endeared to St. Paul. It abounds in practical wisdom, and is rich in Scripture and Scriptural allusions. It reflects the spirit of St. John, alike in its lamb-like and its aquiline features: he is as loving as the beloved disciple himself when he speaks of Christ and his church, but “the son of thunder” is echoed in his rebukes of threatened corruptions in faith and morals. Nothing can be more clear than his view of the doctrines of grace; but he writes like the disciple of St. John, though in perfect harmony with St. Pauls hymn-like eulogy of Christian love.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p4"></a>The following is the original <span class="upper"><a name="iv.i-p4.1"></a>Introductory Notice</span>:—</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p5"></a><span class="upper"><a name="iv.i-p5.1"></a>The </span>authenticity of the following Epistle can on no fair grounds be questioned. It is abundantly established by external testimony, and is also supported by the internal evidence. Irenæus says (<i>Adv. Hær.</i>, iii. 3): “There is extant an Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians, most satisfactory, from which those that have a mind to do so may learn the character of his  <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a> <a name="iv.i-Page_32"></a>  faith,” etc. This passage is embodied by Eusebius in his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> (iv. 14); and in another place the same writer refers to the Epistle before us as an undoubted production of Polycarp (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, iii. 36). Other ancient testimonies might easily be added, but are superfluous, inasmuch as there is a general consent among scholars at the present day that we have in this letter an authentic production of the renowned Bishop of Smyrna.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p6"></a>Of Polycarps life little is known, but that little is highly interesting. Irenæus was his disciple, and tells us that “Polycarp was instructed by the apostles, and was brought into contact with many who had seen Christ” (<i>Adv. Hær.</i>, iii. 3; Euseb. <i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, iv. 14). There is also a very graphic account given of Polycarp by Irenæus in his Epistle to Florinus, to which the reader is referred. It has been preserved by Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, v. 20).</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p7"></a>The Epistle before us is not perfect in any of the Greek <span class="upper"><a name="iv.i-p7.1"></a>mss.</span> which contain it. But the chapters wanting in Greek are contained in an ancient Latin version. While there is no ground for supposing, as some have done, that the whole Epistle is spurious, there seems considerable force in the arguments by which many others have sought to prove chap. xiii. to be an interpolation.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p8"></a>The date of the Epistle cannot be satisfactorily determined. It depends on the conclusion we reach as to some points, very difficult and obscure, connected with that account of the martyrdom of Polycarp which has come down to us. We shall not, however, probably be far wrong if we fix it about the middle of the second century.</p>
