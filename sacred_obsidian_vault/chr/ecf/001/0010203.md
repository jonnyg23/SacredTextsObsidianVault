 <p><a name="v.vii.iv-p1"></a>I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the same opinions [as I do]. But I  <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a> <a name="v.vii.iv-Page_88"></a>  guard you beforehand from those beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with; only you must pray to God for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power of [effecting] this. But if these things were done by our Lord only in appearance, then am I also only in appearance bound. And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But, [in fact,] he who is near to the sword is near to God; he that is among the wild beasts is in company with God; provided only he be so in the name of Jesus Christ. I undergo all these things that I may suffer together with Him, <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_1000"><font size="1">1001</font></a>
  He who became a perfect man inwardly strengthening me. <a name="fr_1001"></a><a href="#fn_1001"><font size="1">1002</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.vii.iv-p4"></a>I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the same opinions [as I do]. But I guard you beforehand from these beasts in the shape of men, from whom you must not only turn away, but even flee from them. Only you must pray for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance. For if the Lord were in the body in appearance only, and were crucified in appearance only, then am I also bound in appearance only. And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But, [in fact,] I endure all things for Christ, not in appearance only, but in reality, that I may suffer together with Him, while He Himself inwardly strengthens me; for of myself I have no such ability.</p>
