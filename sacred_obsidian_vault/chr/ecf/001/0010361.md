 <p> <a name="vii.ii.i"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="vii.ii.i-p0.1"></a>I. From the exposition of the oracles of the Lord. <a name="fr_1733"></a><a href="#fn_1733"><font size="1">1734</font></a>
 </h3>  
 <p><a name="vii.ii.i-p2"></a>[<span class="upper"><a name="vii.ii.i-p2.1"></a>The</span> writings of Papias in common circulation are five in number, and these are called an Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord. Irenæus makes mention of these as the only works written by him, in the following words: “Now testimony is borne to these things in writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John, and a friend of Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books were composed by him.” Thus wrote Irenæus. Moreover, Papias himself, in the introduction to his books, makes it manifest that he was not himself a hearer and eye-witness of the holy apostles; but he tells us that he received the truths of our religion <a name="fr_1734"></a><a href="#fn_1734"><font size="1">1735</font></a>
  from those who were acquainted with them [the apostles] in the following words:]</p>  
 <p><a name="vii.ii.i-p4"></a>But I shall not be unwilling to put down, along with my interpretations, <a name="fr_1735"></a><a href="#fn_1735"><font size="1">1736</font></a>
  whatsoever instructions I received with care at any time from the elders, and stored up with care in my memory, assuring you at the same time of their truth. For I did not, like the multitude, take pleasure in those who spoke much, but in those who taught the truth; nor in those who related strange commandments, <a name="fr_1736"></a><a href="#fn_1736"><font size="1">1737</font></a>
  but in those who rehearsed the commandments given by the Lord to faith, <a name="fr_1737"></a><a href="#fn_1737"><font size="1">1738</font></a>
  and proceeding from truth itself. If, then, any one who had attended on the elders came, I asked minutely after their sayings,—what Andrew or Peter said, or what was said by Philip, or by Thomas, or by James, or by John, or by Matthew, or by any other of the Lords disciples: which things <a name="fr_1738"></a><a href="#fn_1738"><font size="1">1739</font></a>
  Aristion and the presbyter John, the disciples of the Lord, say. For I imagined that what was to be got from books was not so profitable to me as what came from the living and abiding voice.</p>
