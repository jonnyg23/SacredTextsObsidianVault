 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvii-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></a>Cerinthus, again, a man who was educated <a name="fr_2954"></a><a href="#fn_2954"><font size="1">2955</font></a>
  in the wisdom of the Egyptians, taught that the world was not made by the primary God, but by a certain Power far separated from him, and at a distance from that Principality who is supreme  <a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a> <a name="ix.ii.xxvii-Page_352"></a>  over the universe, and ignorant of him who is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a virgin, but as being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course of human generation, while he nevertheless was more righteous, prudent, and wise than other men. Moreover, after his baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and performed miracles. But at last Christ departed from Jesus, and that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvii-p3"></a>2. <a name="ix.ii.xxvii-p3.1"></a>Those who are called Ebionites agree that the world was made by God; but their opinions with respect to the Lord are similar to those of Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They use the Gospel according to Matthew only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining that he was an apostate from the law. As to the prophetical writings, they endeavour to expound them in a somewhat singular manner: they practise circumcision, persevere in the observance of those customs which are enjoined by the law, and are so Judaic in their style of life, that they even adore Jerusalem as if it were the house of God.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvii-p4"></a>3. <a name="ix.ii.xxvii-p4.1"></a>The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that Nicolas who was one of the seven first ordained to the diaconate by the apostles. <a name="fr_2955"></a><a href="#fn_2955"><font size="1">2956</font></a>
  They lead lives of unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is very plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, [when they are represented] as teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practise adultery, and to eat things sacrificed to idols. Wherefore the Word has also spoken of them thus: “But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.” <a name="fr_2956"></a><a href="#fn_2956"><font size="1">2957</font></a>
