 <p> <a name="ix.iii.x"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.iii.x-p0.1"></a>Chapter IX.—There is but one Creator of the world, God the Father: this the constant belief of the Church.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.iii.x-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.iii.x-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.iii.x-p1.2"></a>That God is the Creator of the world is accepted even by those very persons who in many ways speak against Him, and yet acknowledge Him, styling Him the Creator, and an angel, not to mention that all the Scriptures call out [to the same effect], and the Lord teaches us of this Father <a name="fr_3026"></a><a href="#fn_3026"><font size="1">3027</font></a>
  who is in heaven, and no other, as I shall show in the sequel of this work. For the present, however, that proof which is derived from those who allege doctrines opposite to ours, is of itself sufficient,—all men, in fact, consenting to this truth: the ancients on their part preserving with special care, from the tradition of the first-formed man, this persuasion, while they celebrate the praises of one God, the Maker of heaven and earth; others, again, after them, being reminded of this fact by the prophets of God, while the very heathen learned it from creation itself. For even creation reveals Him who formed it, and the very work made suggests Him who made it, and the world manifests Him who ordered it. The Universal Church, moreover, through the whole world, has received this tradition from the apostles.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iii.x-p3"></a>2. This God, then, being acknowledged, as I have said, and receiving testimony from all to the fact of His existence, that Father whom they conjure into existence is beyond doubt untenable, and has no witnesses [to his existence]. Simon Magus was the first who said that he himself was God over all, and that the world was formed by his angels. Then those who succeeded him, as I have shown in the first book, <a name="fr_3027"></a><a href="#fn_3027"><font size="1">3028</font></a>
  by their several opinions, still further depraved [his teaching] through their impious and irreligious doctrines against the Creator. These [heretics now referred to], <a name="fr_3028"></a><a href="#fn_3028"><font size="1">3029</font></a>
  being the disciples of those mentioned, render such as assent to them worse than the heathen. For the former “serve the creature rather than the Creator,” <a name="fr_3029"></a><a href="#fn_3029"><font size="1">3030</font></a>
  and “those which are not gods,” <a name="fr_3030"></a><a href="#fn_3030"><font size="1">3031</font></a>
  notwithstanding that they ascribe the first place in Deity to that God who was the Maker of this universe. But the latter maintain that He, [i.e., the Creator of this world,] is the fruit of a defect, and describe Him as being of an animal nature, and as not knowing that Power which is above Him, while He also exclaims, “I am God, and besides Me there is no other God.” <a name="fr_3031"></a><a href="#fn_3031"><font size="1">3032</font></a>
  Affirming that He lies, they are themselves liars, attributing all sorts of wickedness to Him; and conceiving of one who is not above this Being as really having an existence, they are thus convicted by their own views of blasphemy against that God who really exists, while they conjure into existence a god who has no existence, to their own condemnation. And thus those who declare themselves “perfect,” and as being possessed of the knowledge of all things, are found to be worse than the heathen, and to entertain more blasphemous opinions even against their own Creator.</p>
