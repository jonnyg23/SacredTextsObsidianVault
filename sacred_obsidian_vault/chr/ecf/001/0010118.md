 <p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p1"></a>Since, then, ye requested that we would at large make you acquainted with what really took place, we have for the present sent you this summary account through our brother Marcus. When, therefore, ye have yourselves read this Epistle, <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">474</font></a>
  be pleased to send it to the brethren at a greater distance, that they also may glorify the Lord, who makes such choice of His own servants. <a name="iv.iv.xx-p2.1"></a>To Him who is able to bring us all by His grace and goodness <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">475</font></a>
  into his everlasting kingdom, through His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, to Him be glory, and honour, and power, and majesty, for ever. Amen. Salute all the saints. They that are with us salute you, and Evarestus, who wrote this Epistle, with all his house.</p>
