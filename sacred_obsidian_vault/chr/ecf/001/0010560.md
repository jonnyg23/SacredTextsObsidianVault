 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xcix"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xcix-p0.1"></a>Chapter XCIX.—In the commencement of the Psalm are Christs dying words.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xcix-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcix-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcix-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcix-p1.3"></a>And when I had said these words, I continued: “Now I will demonstrate to you that the whole Psalm refers thus to Christ, by the words which I shall again explain. What is said at first—O God, my God, attend to me: why hast Thou forsaken me?—announced from the beginning that which was to be said in the time of Christ. For when crucified, He spake: O God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? And what follows: The words of my transgressions are far from my salvation. O my God, I will cry to Thee in the day-time, and Thou wilt not hear; and in the night-season, and it is not for want of understanding in me. These, as well as the things which He was to do, were spoken. For on the day on which He was to be crucified, <a name="fr_2324"></a><a href="#fn_2324"><font size="1">2325</font></a>
  having taken three of His disciples to the hill called Olivet, situated opposite to the temple in Jerusalem, He prayed in these words: Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. <a name="fr_2325"></a><a href="#fn_2325"><font size="1">2326</font></a>
  And again He prayed: Not as I will, but as Thou wilt; <a name="fr_2326"></a><a href="#fn_2326"><font size="1">2327</font></a>
  showing by this that He had become truly a suffering man. But lest any one should say, He did not know then that He had to suffer, He adds immediately in the Psalm: And it is not for want of understanding in me. Even as there was no ignorance on Gods part when He asked Adam where he was, or asked Cain where Abel was; but [it was done] to convince each what kind of man he was, and in order that through the record [of Scripture] we might have a knowledge of all: so likewise Christ declared that ignorance was not on His side, but on theirs, who thought that He was not the Christ, but fancied they would put Him to death, and that He, like some common mortal, would remain in Hades.</p>
