 <p> <a name="ix.vi.xxii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.vi.xxii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXI.—Abrahams faith was identical with ours; this faith was prefigured by the words and actions of the old patriarchs.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xxii-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.vi.xxii-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.vi.xxii-p1.2"></a>But that our faith was also prefigured in Abraham, and that he was the patriarch of our faith, and, as it were, the prophet of it, the apostle has very fully taught, when he says in the Epistle to the Galatians: “He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, announced beforehand unto Abraham, that in him all nations should be blessed. So then they which be of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.” <a name="fr_4113"></a><a href="#fn_4113"><font size="1">4114</font></a>
  For which [reasons the apostle] declared that this man was not only the prophet of faith, but also the father of those who from among the Gentiles believe in Jesus Christ, because his faith and ours are one and the same: for he believed in things future, as if they were already accomplished, because of the promise of God; and in like manner do we also, because of the promise of God, behold through faith that inheritance [laid up for us] in the [future] kingdom.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xxii-p3"></a>2. <a name="ix.vi.xxii-p3.1"></a>The history of Isaac, too, is not without a  <a name="page_493"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 493</font></a> <a name="ix.vi.xxii-Page_493"></a>  symbolical character. For in the Epistle to the Romans, the apostle declares: “Moreover, when Rebecca had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac,” she received answer <a name="fr_4114"></a><a href="#fn_4114"><font size="1">4115</font></a>
  from the Word, “that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people are in thy body; and the one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.” <a name="fr_4115"></a><a href="#fn_4115"><font size="1">4116</font></a>
  From which it is evident, that not only [were there] prophecies of the patriarchs, but also that the children brought forth by Rebecca were a prediction of the two nations; and that the one should be indeed the greater, but the other the less; that the one also should be under bondage, but the other free; but [that both should be] of one and the same father. Our God, one and the same, is also their God, who knows hidden things, who knoweth all things before they can come to pass; and for this reason has He said, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” <a name="fr_4116"></a><a href="#fn_4116"><font size="1">4117</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xxii-p7"></a>3. <a name="ix.vi.xxii-p7.1"></a>If any one, again, will look into Jacobs actions, he shall find them not destitute of meaning, but full of import with regard to the dispensations. Thus, in the first place, at his birth, since he laid hold on his brothers heel, <a name="fr_4117"></a><a href="#fn_4117"><font size="1">4118</font></a>
  he was called Jacob, that is, <i>the supplanter</i>—one who holds, but is not held; binding the feet, but not being bound; striving and conquering; grasping in his hand his adversarys heel, that is, victory. For to this end was the Lord born, the type of whose birth he set forth beforehand, of whom also John says in the Apocalypse: “He went forth conquering, that He should conquer.” <a name="fr_4118"></a><a href="#fn_4118"><font size="1">4119</font></a>
  In the next place, [Jacob] received the rights of the first-born, when his brother looked on them with contempt; even as also the younger nation received Him, Christ, the first-begotten, when the elder nation rejected Him, saying, “We have no king but Cæsar.” <a name="fr_4119"></a><a href="#fn_4119"><font size="1">4120</font></a>
  But in Christ every blessing [is summed up], and therefore the latter people has snatched away the blessings of the former from the Father, just as Jacob took away the blessing of this Esau. For which cause his brother suffered the plots and persecutions of a brother, just as the Church suffers this self-same thing from the Jews. In a foreign country were the twelve tribes born, the race of Israel, inasmuch as Christ was also, in a strange country, to generate the twelve-pillared foundation of the Church. Various coloured sheep were allotted to this Jacob as his wages; and the wages of Christ are human beings, who from various and diverse nations come together into one cohort of faith, as the Father promised Him, saying, “Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.” <a name="fr_4120"></a><a href="#fn_4120"><font size="1">4121</font></a>
  And as from the multitude of his sons the prophets of the Lord [afterwards] arose, there was every necessity that Jacob should beget sons from the two sisters, even as Christ did from the two laws of one and the same Father; and in like manner also from the handmaids, indicating that Christ should raise up sons of God, both from freemen and from slaves after the flesh, bestowing upon all, in the same manner, the gift of the Spirit, who vivifies us. <a name="fr_4121"></a><a href="#fn_4121"><font size="1">4122</font></a>
  But he (Jacob) did all things for the sake of the younger, she who had the handsome eyes, <a name="fr_4122"></a><a href="#fn_4122"><font size="1">4123</font></a>
  Rachel, who prefigured the Church, for which Christ endured patiently; who at that time, indeed, by means of His patriarchs and prophets, was prefiguring and declaring beforehand future things, fulfilling His part by anticipation in the dispensations of God, and accustoming His inheritance to obey God, and to pass through the world as in a state of pilgrimage, to follow His word, and to indicate beforehand things to come. For with God there is nothing without purpose or due signification.</p>
