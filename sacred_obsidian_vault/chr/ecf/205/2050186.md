 </p><p class="c49"><a name="x.ii.ii.v-p1"></a>  IV. <i>That the construction of man throughout signifies his ruling power</i> <a name="fr_1595"></a><a href="#fn_1595"><font size="1">1597</font></a>

 <p class="c12"><a name="x.ii.ii.v-p3"></a>1. For as in our own life artificers fashion a tool in the way suitable to its use, so the best Artificer made our nature as it were a formation fit for the exercise of royalty, preparing it at once by superior advantages of soul, and by the very form of the body, to be such as to be <a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 391</font></a> <a name="x.ii.ii.v-Page_391"></a>adapted for royalty: for the soul immediately shows its royal and exalted character, far removed as it is from the lowliness of private station, in that it owns no lord, and is self-governed, swayed autocratically by its own will; for to whom else does this belong than to a king? And further, besides these facts, the fact that it is the image of that Nature which rules over all means nothing else than this, that our nature was created to be royal from the first. For as, in mens ordinary use, those who make images <a name="fr_1596"></a><a href="#fn_1596"><font size="1">1598</font></a>
  of princes both mould the figure of their form, and represent along with this the royal rank by the vesture of purple, and even the likeness is commonly spoken of as “a king,” so the human nature also, as it was made to rule the rest, was, by its likeness to the King of all, made as it were a living image, partaking with the archetype both in rank and in name, not vested in purple, nor giving indication of its rank by sceptre and diadem (for the archetype itself is not arrayed with these), but instead of the purple robe, clothed in virtue, which is in truth the most royal of all raiment, and in place of the sceptre, leaning on the bliss of immortality, and instead of the royal diadem, decked with the crown of righteousness; so that it is shown to be perfectly like to the beauty of its archetype in all that belongs to the dignity of royalty.</p>
