 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XII.—Of the Kinds of Beneficence, and Works of Mercy.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p1"></a>This is that perfect justice which protects human society, concerning which philosophers <a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-Page_176"></a>speak. This is the chief and truest advantage of riches; not to use wealth for the particular pleasure of an individual, but for the welfare of many; not for ones own immediate enjoyment, but for justice, which alone does not perish. We must therefore by all means keep in mind, that the hope of receiving in return must be altogether absent from the duty of showing mercy: for the reward of this work and duty must be expected from God alone; for if you should expect it from man, then that will not be kindness, but the lending of a benefit at interest; <a name="fr_1169"></a><a href="#fn_1169"><font size="1">1170</font></a>
  nor can he seem to have deserved well who affords that which he does, not to another, but to himself. And yet the matter comes to this, that whatever a man has bestowed upon another, hoping for no advantage from him, he really bestows upon himself, for he will receive a reward from God. God has also enjoined, that if at any time we make a feast, we should invite to the entertainment those who cannot invite us in return, and thus make us a recompense, so that no action of our life should be without the exercise of mercy. Nor, however, let any one think that he is debarred from intercourse with his friends or kindness with his neighbours. But God has made known to us what is our true and just work: we ought thus to live with our neighbours, provided that we know that the one manner of living relates to man, the other to God. <a name="fr_1170"></a><a href="#fn_1170"><font size="1">1171</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p4"></a>Therefore hospitality is a principal virtue, as the philosophers also say; but they turn it aside from true justice, and forcibly apply <a name="fr_1171"></a><a href="#fn_1171"><font size="1">1172</font></a>
  it to advantage. <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p5.2"></a>Cicero says: <a name="fr_1172"></a><a href="#fn_1172"><font size="1">1173</font></a>
  “Hospitality was rightly praised by <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p6.2"></a>Theophrastus. For (as it appears to me) it is highly becoming that the houses of illustrious men should be open to illustrious guests.” He has here committed the same error which he then did, when he said that we must bestow our bounty on “suitable” persons. For the house of a just and wise man ought not to be open to the illustrious, but to the lowly and abject. For those illustrious and powerful men cannot be in want of anything, since they are sufficiently protected and honoured by their own opulence. But nothing is to be done by a just man except that which is a benefit. But if the benefit is returned, it is destroyed and brought to an end; for we cannot possess in its completeness that for which a price has been paid to us. Therefore the principle of justice is employed about those benefits which have remained safe and uncorrupted; but they cannot thus remain by any other means than if they are be stowed upon those men who can in no way profit us. But in receiving illustrious men, he looked to nothing else but utility; nor did the ingenious man conceal what advantage he hoped from it. For he says that he who does that will become powerful among foreigners by the favour of the leading men, whom he will have bound to himself by the right of hospitality and friendship. O by how many arguments might the inconsistency of <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p6.3"></a>Cicero be proved, if this were my object! Nor would he be convicted so much by my words as by his own. For he also says, that the more any one refers all his actions to his own advantage, the less he is a good man. He also says, that it is not the part of a simple and open man to ingratiate himself in the favour of others, <a name="fr_1173"></a><a href="#fn_1173"><font size="1">1174</font></a>
  to pretend and allege anything, to appear to be doing one thing when he is doing another, to feign that he is bestowing upon another that which he is bestowing upon himself; but that this is rather the part of one who is designing <a name="fr_1174"></a><a href="#fn_1174"><font size="1">1175</font></a>
  and crafty, deceitful and treacherous. But how could he maintain that that ambitious hospitality was not evil intention? <a name="fr_1175"></a><a href="#fn_1175"><font size="1">1176</font></a>
  “Do you run round through all the gates, that you may invite to your house the chief men of the nations and cities as they arrive, that by their means you may acquire influence with their citizens; and wish yourself to be called just, and kind, and hospitable, though you are studying to promote your own advantage?” But did he not say this rather incautiously? For what is less suitable for <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p9.2"></a>Cicero? But through his ignorance of true justice he knowingly and with foresight fell into this snare. And that he might be pardoned for this, he testified that he does not give precepts with reference to true justice, which he does not hold, but with reference to a sketch and outline of justice. Therefore we must pardon this teacher who uses sketches and outlines, <a name="fr_1176"></a><a href="#fn_1176"><font size="1">1177</font></a>
  nor must we require the truth from him who admits that he is ignorant of it.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p11"></a>The ransoming of captives is a great and noble exercise of justice, of which the same <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p11.1"></a>Tullius also approved. <a name="fr_1177"></a><a href="#fn_1177"><font size="1">1178</font></a>
  “And this liberality,” he says, “is serviceable even to the state, that captives should be ransomed from slavery, and that those of slender resources should be provided for. And I greatly prefer this practice of liberality to lavish expenditure on shows. This is the part of great and eminent men.” Therefore it is the appropriate work of the just to support the poor and to ransom captives, since <a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-Page_177"></a>among the unjust if any do these things they are called great and eminent. For it is deserving of the greatest praise for those to confer benefit from whom no one expected such conduct. For he who does good to a relative, or neighbour, or friend, either deserves no praise, or certainly no great praise, because he is bound to do it, and he would be impious and detestable if he did not do that which both nature itself and relationship require; and if he does it, he does it not so much for the sake of obtaining glory as of avoiding censure. But he who does it to a stranger and an unknown person, he truly is worthy of praise, because he was led to do it by kindness only. Justice therefore exists there, where there is no obligation of necessity for conferring a benefit. He ought not therefore to have preferred this duty of generosity to expenditure on shows; for this is the part of one making a comparison, and of two goods choosing that which is the better. For that profusion of men throwing away their property into the sea is vain and trifling, and very far removed from all justice. Therefore they are not even to be called gifts, <a name="fr_1178"></a><a href="#fn_1178"><font size="1">1179</font></a>
  in which no one receives but he who does not deserve to receive.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p14"></a>Nor is it less a great work of justice to protect and defend orphans and widows who are destitute and stand in need of assistance; and therefore that divine law prescribes this to all, since all good judges deem that it belongs to their office to favour them with natural kindness, and to strive to benefit them. But these works are especially ours, since we have received the law, and the words of God Himself giving us instructions. For they perceive that it is naturally just to protect those who need protection, but they do not perceive why it is so. For God, to whom everlasting mercy belongs, on this account commands that widows and orphans should be defended and cherished, that no one through regard and pity for his pledges <a name="fr_1179"></a><a href="#fn_1179"><font size="1">1180</font></a>
  should be prevented from undergoing death in behalf of justice and faith, but should encounter it with promptitude and boldness, since he knows that he leaves his beloved ones to the care of God, and that they will never want protection. Also to undertake the care and support of the sick, who need some one to assist them, is the part of the greatest kindness, and of great beneficence; <a name="fr_1180"></a><a href="#fn_1180"><font size="1">1181</font></a>
  and he who shall do this will both gain a living sacrifice to God, and that which he has given to another for a time he will himself receive from God for eternity. The last and greatest office of piety is the burying of strangers and the poor; which subject those teachers of virtue and justice have not touched upon at all. For they were unable to see this, who measured all their duties by utility. For in the other things which have been mentioned above, although they did not keep the true path, yet, since they discovered some advantage in these things, retained as it were by a kind of inkling <a name="fr_1181"></a><a href="#fn_1181"><font size="1">1182</font></a>
  of the truth, they wandered to a less distance; but they abandoned this because they were unable to see any advantage in it.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p18"></a>Moreover, there have not been wanting those who esteemed burial as superfluous, and said that it was no evil to lie unburied and neglected; but their impious wisdom is rejected alike by the whole human race, and by the divine expressions which command the performance of the rite. <a name="fr_1182"></a><a href="#fn_1182"><font size="1">1183</font></a>
  But they do not venture to say that it ought not to be done, but that, if it happens to be omitted, no inconvenience is the result. Therefore in that matter they discharge the office, not so much of those who give precepts, as of those who suggest consolation, that if this shall by chance have occurred to a wise man, he should not deem himself wretched on this account. But we do not speak of that which ought to be endured by a wise man, but of that which he himself ought to do. Therefore we do not now inquire whether the whole system of burial is serviceable or not; but this, even though it be useless, as they imagine, must nevertheless be practised, even on this account only, that it appears among men to be done rightly and kindly. For it is the feeling which is inquired into, and it is the purpose which is weighed. Therefore we will not suffer the image and workmanship of God to lie exposed as a prey to beasts and birds, but we will restore it to the earth, from which it had its origin; and although it be in the case of an unknown man, we will fulfil the office of relatives, into whose place, since they are wanting, let kindness succeed; and wherever there shall be need of man, there we will think that our duty is required. <a name="fr_1183"></a><a href="#fn_1183"><font size="1">1184</font></a>
  But in what does the nature of justice more consist than in our affording to strangers through kindness, that which we render to our own relatives through affection? And this kindness is much more sure and just when it is now afforded, not to the man who is insensible, but to God alone, to whom a just work is a most acceptable sacrifice. Some one will perhaps say: If I shall do all these things, I shall have no possessions. For what if a great number of men shall be in want, shall suffer cold, shall be taken captive, shall die, since one who acts thus must deprive himself of his property even in a single day, shall I throw away the estate <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-Page_178"></a>acquired by my own labour or by that of my ancestors, so that after this I myself must live by the pity of others?  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xii-p21"></a>Why do you so pusillanimously fear poverty, which even your philosophers praise, and bear witness that nothing is safer and nothing more calm than this? That which you fear is a haven against anxieties. Do you not know to how many dangers, to how many accidents, you are exposed with these evil resources? These will treat you well if they shall pass without your bloodshed. But you walk about laden with booty, and you bear spoils which may excite the minds even of your own relatives. Why, then, do you hesitate to lay that out well which perhaps a single robbery will snatch away from you, or a proscription suddenly arising, or the plundering of an enemy? Why do you fear to make a frail and perishable good everlasting, or to entrust your treasures to God as their preserver, in which case you need not fear thief and robber, nor rust, nor tyrant? He who is rich towards God can never be poor. <a name="fr_1184"></a><a href="#fn_1184"><font size="1">1185</font></a>
  If you esteem justice so highly, lay aside the burthens which press you, and follow it; free yourself from fetters and chains, that you may run to God without any impediment. It is the part of a great and lofty mind to despise and trample upon mortal affairs. But if you do not comprehend this virtue, that you may bestow your riches upon the altar <a name="fr_1185"></a><a href="#fn_1185"><font size="1">1186</font></a>
  of God, in order that you may provide for yourself firmer possessions than these frail ones, I will free you from fear. All these precepts are not given to you alone, but to all the people who are united in mind, and hold together as one man. If you are not adequate to the performance of great works alone, cultivate justice with all your power, in such a manner, however, that you may excel others in work as much as you excel them in riches. And do not think that you are advised to lessen or exhaust your property; but that which you would have expended on superfluities, turn to better uses. Devote to the ransoming of captives that from which you purchase beasts; maintain the poor with that from which you feed wild beasts; bury the innocent dead with that from which you provide men for the sword. <a name="fr_1186"></a><a href="#fn_1186"><font size="1">1187</font></a>
  What does it profit to enrich men of abandoned wickedness, who fight with beasts, <a name="fr_1187"></a><a href="#fn_1187"><font size="1">1188</font></a>
  and to equip them for crimes? Transfer things about to be miserably thrown away to the great sacrifice, that in return for these true gifts you may have an everlasting gift from God. Mercy has a great reward; for God promises it, that He will remit all sins. If you shall hear, He says, the prayers of your suppliant, I also will hear yours; if you shall pity those in distress, I also will pity you in your distress. But if you shall not regard nor assist them, I also will bear a mind like your own against you, and I will judge you by your own laws. <a name="fr_1188"></a><a href="#fn_1188"><font size="1">1189</font></a>
