 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1"></a>Wherefore, since all these things are true and certain, in harmony with the predicted announcement of the prophets, since <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.1"></a>Trismegistus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.2"></a>Hystaspes and the <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.3"></a>Sibyls have foretold the same things, it cannot be doubted that all hope of life and salvation is placed in the religion of God alone. Therefore, unless a man shall have received Christ, whom God has sent, and is about to send for our redemption, unless he shall have known the Supreme God through Christ, unless he shall have kept His commandments and law, he will fall into those punishments of which we have spoken. Therefore frail things must be despised, that we may gain those which are substantial; earthly things must be scorned, that we may be honoured with heavenly things; temporal things must be shunned, that we may reach those which are eternal. Let every one train himself to justice, mould himself to self-restraint, prepare himself for the contest, equip himself for virtue, that if by any chance an adversary shall wage war, he may be driven from that which is upright and good by no force, no terror, and no tortures, may give <a name="fr_1607"></a><a href="#fn_1607"><font size="1">1608</font></a>
  himself up to no senseless fictions, but in his uprightness acknowledge the true and only God, may cast away pleasures, by the attractions of which the lofty soul is depressed to the earth, may hold fast innocency, may be of service to as many as possible, may gain for himself incorruptible treasures by good works, that he may be able, with God for his judge, to gain for the merits of his virtue either the crown of faith, or the reward of immortality.  </p>
