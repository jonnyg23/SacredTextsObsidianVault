 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xix-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIX.—Of the Affections and Their Use; And of the Three Furies.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xix-p1"></a>When the Stoics attempt to uproot the affections from man as diseases, they are opposed by the Peripatetics, who not only retain, but also defend them, and say that there is nothing in man which is not produced in him with great reason and foresight. They say this indeed rightly, if they know the true limits of each subject. Accordingly they say that this very affection of anger is the whetstone of virtue, as though no one could fight bravely against enemies unless he were excited by anger; by which they plainly show that they neither know what virtue is, nor why God gave anger to man. And if this was given to us for this purpose, that we may employ it for the slaying of men, what is to be thought more savage than man, what more resembling the wild beasts, than that animal which God formed for communion and innocence? There are, then, three affections which drive men headlong to all crimes: (1) anger, (2) desire, and (3) lust. <a name="fr_1221"></a><a href="#fn_1221"><font size="1">1222</font></a>
  On which account the poets have said that there are three furies which harass the minds of men: anger longs for revenge, desire for riches, lust for pleasures. But God has appointed fixed limits to all of these; and if they pass these limits and begin to be too great, they must necessarily pervert their nature, and be changed into diseases and vices. And it is a matter of no great labour to show what these limits are. <a name="fr_1222"></a><a href="#fn_1222"><font size="1">1223</font></a>
  Cupidity <a name="fr_1223"></a><a href="#fn_1223"><font size="1">1224</font></a>
  is given us for providing those things which are necessary for life; concupiscence, <a name="fr_1224"></a><a href="#fn_1224"><font size="1">1225</font></a>
  for the procreation of offspring; the affection of indignation, <a name="fr_1225"></a><a href="#fn_1225"><font size="1">1226</font></a>
  for restraining the faults of those who are in our power, that is, in order that tender age may be formed by a severer discipline to integrity and justice: for if this <span><a name="iii.ii.vi.xix-p6.1"></a>time of life</span> is not restrained by fear, <a name="fr_1226"></a><a href="#fn_1226"><font size="1">1227</font></a>
  licence will produce boldness, and this will break out into every disgraceful and daring action. Therefore, as it is both just and necessary to employ anger towards the young, so it is both pernicious and impious to use it towards those of our own age. It is impious, because humanity is injured; pernicious, because if they oppose, it is necessary either to destroy them or to perish. But that this which I have spoken of is the reason why the affection of anger has been given to man, may be understood from the precepts of God Himself, who commands that we should not be angry with those who revile and injure us, but that we should always have our hands over the young; that is, that when they err, we should correct them with continual stripes, <a name="fr_1227"></a><a href="#fn_1227"><font size="1">1228</font></a>
  lest by useless love and excessive indulgence they should be trained to evil and nourished to vices. But those who are inexperienced in affairs and ignorant of reason, have expelled those affections which have been given to man for good uses, and they wander more widely than reason demands. <a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xix-Page_186"></a>From this cause they live unjustly and impiously. They employ anger against their equals in age: hence disagreements, hence banishments, hence wars have arisen contrary to justice. They use desire for the amassing of riches: hence frauds, hence robberies, hence all kinds of crimes have originated. They use lust only for the enjoyment of pleasures: hence debaucheries, hence adulteries, hence all corruptions have proceeded. Whoever, therefore, has reduced those affections within their proper limits, which they who are ignorant of God cannot do, he is patient, he is brave, he is just. <a name="fr_1228"></a><a href="#fn_1228"><font size="1">1229</font></a>
