 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p0.1"></a><span><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p0.2"></a>CHAP. XVI.—OF THE DEVASTATION</span> of the World, and Its Prophetic Omens. <a name="fr_1397"></a><a href="#fn_1397"><font size="1">1398</font></a>
 </h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p2"></a>But, test any one should think this incredible, I will show how it will come to pass. First, the kingdom will be enlarged, and the chief power, dispersed among many and divided, <a name="fr_1398"></a><a href="#fn_1398"><font size="1">1399</font></a>
  will be diminished. Then civil discords will perpetually be sown; nor will there be any rest from deadly wars, until ten kings arise at the same time, who will divide the world, not to govern, but to consume it. These, having increased their armies to an immense extent, and having deserted the cultivation of the fields, which is the beginning of overthrow and disaster, will lay waste and break in pieces and consume all things. Then a most powerful enemy will suddenly arise against him from the extreme boundaries of the northern region, who, having destroyed three of that number who shall then be in possession of Asia, shall be admitted into alliance by the others, and shall be constituted prince of all. He shall harass the world with an intolerable rule; shall mingle things divine and human; shall contrive things impious to relate, and detestable; shall meditate new designs in his breast, that he may establish the government for himself: he will change the laws, and appoint his own; he will contaminate, plunder, spoil, and put to death. And at length, the name being changed and the seat of government being transferred, confusion and the disturbance of mankind will follow. Then, in truth, a detestable and abominable time shall come, in which life shall be pleasant to none of men.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p4"></a>Cities shall be utterly overthrown, and shall perish; not only by fire and the sword, but also by continual earthquakes and overflowings of waters, and by frequent diseases and repeated famines. For the atmosphere will be tainted, and become corrupt and pestilential—at one time by unseasonable rains, at another by barren drought, now by colds, and now by excessive heats. Nor will the earth give its fruit to man: no field, or tree, or vine will produce anything; but after they have given the greatest hope in the blossom, they will fail in the fruit. Fountains also shall be dried up, together with the rivers; so that there shall not be a sufficient supply for drinking; and waters shall be changed into blood or bitterness. On account of these things, beasts shall fail on the land, and birds in the air, and fishes in the sea. Wonderful prodigies also in heaven shall confound the minds of men with the greatest terrors, and the trains of comets, and the darkness of the sun, and the colour of the moon, and the gliding of the falling stars. Nor, however, will these things take place in the accustomed manner; but there will suddenly appear stars unknown and unseen by the eyes; the sun will be perpetually darkened, so that there will be scarcely any distinction between the night and the day; the moon will now fail, not for three hours only, but overspread with perpetual blood, will go through extraordinary movements, so that <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-Page_214"></a>it will not be easy for man to ascertain the courses of the heavenly bodies or the system of the times; for there will either be summer in the winter, or winter in the summer. Then the year will be shortened, and the month diminished, and the day contracted into a short space; and stars shall fall in great numbers, so that all the heaven will appear dark without any lights. The loftiest mountains also will fall, and be levelled with the plains; the sea will be rendered unnavigable.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p5"></a>And that nothing may be wanting to the evils of men and the earth, the trumpet shall be heard from heaven, which the <a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p5.1"></a>Sibyl foretells in this manner:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p5.2"></a>   “The trumpet from heaven shall utter its wailing voice.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p6"></a>And then all shall tremble and quake at that mournful sound. <a name="fr_1399"></a><a href="#fn_1399"><font size="1">1400</font></a>
  But then, through the anger of God against the men who have not known righteousness, the sword and fire, famine and disease, shall reign; and, above all things, fear always overhanging. Then they shall call upon God, but He will not hear them; death shall be desired, but it will not come; not even shall night give rest to their fear, nor shall sleep approach to their eyes, but anxiety and watchfulness shall consume the souls of men; they shall deplore and lament, and gnash their teeth; they shall congratulate the dead, and bewail the living. Through these and many other evils there shall be desolation on the earth, and the world shall be disfigured and deserted, which is thus expressed in the verses of the <a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p7.4"></a>Sibyl:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p7.5"></a>   “The world shall be despoiled of beauty, through the destruction of men.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvi-p8"></a>For the human race will be so consumed, that scarcely the tenth part of men will be left; and from whence a thousand had gone forth, scarcely a hundred will go forth. Of the worshippers of God also, two parts will perish; and the third part, which shall have been proved, will remain.  </p>
