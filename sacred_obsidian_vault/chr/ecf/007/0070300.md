 <p> <a name="iii.iv.xiii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIII.—Of the Lower Members.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p1"></a><span><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p1.1"></a>Poteram nunc ego ipsorum quoque genitalium membrorum mirificam rationem tibi exponere, nisi me pudor ab hujusmodi sermone revocaret: itaque a nobis indumento verecundiæ, quæ sunt pudenda velentur. Quod ad hanc rem attinet, queri satis est, homines impios ac profanos summum nefas admittere, qui divinum et admirabile Dei opus, ad propagandam successionem inexcogitabili ratione provisum et effectum, vel ad turpissimos quæ stus, vel ad obscœnæ libidinis pudenda opera convertunt, ut jam nihil aliud ex re sanctissima petant, quam inanem et sterilem voluptatem.</span>  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p2"></a>How is it with respect to the other parts of the body? Are they without order and beauty? The flesh rounded off into the <span><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p2.1"></a>nates</span>, how adapted to the office of sitting! and this also more firm than in the other limbs, lest by the pressure of the bulk of the body it should give way to the bones. Also the length of the thighs drawn out, and strengthened by broader muscles, in order that it might more easily sustain the weight of the body; and as this is gradually contracted, it is bounded <a name="fr_1906"></a><a href="#fn_1906"><font size="1">1907</font></a>
  by the knees, the comely joints <a name="fr_1907"></a><a href="#fn_1907"><font size="1">1908</font></a>
  of which supply a bend which is most adapted for walking and sitting. Also the legs not drawn out in an equal manner, lest an unbecoming figure should deform the feet; but they are at once strengthened and adorned by <a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.xiii-Page_295"></a>well-turned <a name="fr_1908"></a><a href="#fn_1908"><font size="1">1909</font></a>
  calves gently standing out and gradually diminishing.   </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p6"></a>But in the soles of the feet there is the same plan as in the hands, but yet very different: for since these are, as it were, the foundations of the whole body, <a name="fr_1909"></a><a href="#fn_1909"><font size="1">1910</font></a>
  the admirable Artificer has not made them of a round appearance, lest man should be unable to stand, or should need other feet for standing, as is the case with quadrupeds; but He has formed them of a longer and more extended shape, that they might make the body firm by their flatness, <a name="fr_1910"></a><a href="#fn_1910"><font size="1">1911</font></a>
  from which circumstance their name was given to them. The toes are of the same number with the fingers, for the sake of appearance rather than utility; and on this account they are both joined together, and short, and put together by gradations; and that which is the greatest of these, since it was not befitting that it should be separated from the others, as in the hand, has been so arranged in order, that it appears to differ from the others in magnitude and the small space which intervenes. This beautiful union <a name="fr_1911"></a><a href="#fn_1911"><font size="1">1912</font></a>
  of them strengthens the pressure of the feet with no slight aid; for we cannot be excited to running, unless, our toes being pressed against the ground, and resting upon the soil, we take an impetus and a spring. I appear to have explained all things of which the plan is capable of being understood. I now come to those things which are either doubtful or obscure.  </p>
