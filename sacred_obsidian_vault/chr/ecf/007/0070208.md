 <p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p0.1"></a>Chap. XX.—Of the Gods Peculiar to the Romans.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1"></a>I have spoken of the religious rites which are common to all nations. I will now speak of the gods which the Romans have peculiar to themselves. Who does not know that the wife of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.1"></a>Faustulus, the nurse of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.2"></a>Romulus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.3"></a>Remus, in honour of whom the Larentinalia were instituted, was a harlot? And for this reason she was called <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.4"></a>Lupa, and represented in the form of a wild beast. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.5"></a>Faula also and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.6"></a>Flora were harlots, of whom the one was the mistress of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.7"></a>Hercules, as <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.8"></a>Verrius relates; the other, having acquired great wealth by her person, made the people her heir, and on this account the games called Floralia are celebrated in her honour.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2"></a><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.1"></a>Tatius consecrated the statue of a woman which had been found in the principal sewer, and called it by the name of the goddess <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.2"></a>Cloacina. The Romans, being besieged by the Gauls, made engines for throwing weapons of the hair of women; and on this account they erected an altar and temple to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.3"></a>Venus Calva: <a name="fr_1467"></a><a href="#fn_1467"><font size="1">1468</font></a>
  also to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p3.2"></a>Jupiter Pistor, <a name="fr_1468"></a><a href="#fn_1468"><font size="1">1469</font></a>
  because he had advised them in a dream to make all their corn into bread, and to throw it upon the enemy; and when this had been done, the Gauls, despairing of being able to reduce the Romans by famine, had abandoned the siege. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p4.2"></a>Tullus Hostilius made Fear and Pallor gods. Mind is also worshipped; but if they had possessed it, they would never, I believe, have thought that it ought to be worshipped. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p4.3"></a>Marcellus originated Honour and Virtue.  </p>
