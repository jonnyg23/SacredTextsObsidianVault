 <p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxx"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxx-p0.1"></a>Chap. XXXIV.—That Men are Born to Justice.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxx-p1"></a>Let us now see what is proposed to the wise man as the chief good. <a name="fr_1495"></a><a href="#fn_1495"><font size="1">1496</font></a>
  That men are born to justice is not only taught by the sacred writings, but is sometimes acknowledged even by these same philosophers. Thus <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxx-p2.2"></a>Cicero says: “But of all things which fall under the discussion of learned men, nothing assuredly is more excellent than that it should be clearly understood that we are born to justice.” This is most true. <a name="fr_1496"></a><a href="#fn_1496"><font size="1">1497</font></a>
  For we are not born to wickedness, since we are a social and sociable animal. The wild beasts are produced to exercise their fierceness; for they are unable to live in any other way than by prey and bloodshed. These, however, although pressed by extreme hunger, nevertheless refrain from animals of their own kind. Birds also do the same, which must feed upon the carcases of others. How much more is it befitting, that man, who is united with man both in the interchange of language and in communion of feeling, should spare man, and love him! For this is justice.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxx-p4"></a>But since wisdom has been given to man alone, that he may understand God, and this alone makes the difference between man and the dumb animals, justice itself is bound up in two duties. He owes the one to God as to a father, the other to man as to a brother; for we are produced by the same God. Therefore it has been deservedly and rightly said, that wisdom is the knowledge of divine and human affairs. For it is right that we should know what we owe to God, and what to man; namely, to God religion, to man affection. But the former belongs to wisdom, the latter to virtue; and justice comprises both. If, therefore, it is evident that man is born to justice, it is necessary that the just man should be subject to evils, that he may exercise the virtue with which he is endued. For virtue is the enduring of evils. He will avoid pleasures as an evil: he will despise riches, because they are frail; and if he has them, he will liberally bestow them, to preserve the wretched: he will not be desirous of honours, because they are short and transitory; he will do injury to no one; if he shall suffer, he will not retaliate; and he will not take vengeance upon one who plunders his property. For he will deem it unlawful to injure a man; and if there shall be any one who would compel him to depart from God, he will not refuse tortures nor death. Thus it will come to pass, that he must necessarily live in poverty and lowliness, and in insults, or even tortures.  </p>
