 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xvii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XVII.—Of the False Prophet, and the Hardships of the Righteous, and His Destruction.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvii-p1"></a>But I will more plainly set forth the manner in which this happens. When the close of the times draws nigh, a great prophet shall be sent from God to turn men to the knowledge of God, and he shall receive the power of doing wonderful things. <a name="fr_1400"></a><a href="#fn_1400"><font size="1">1401</font></a>
  Wherever men shall not hear him, he will shut up the heaven, and cause it to withhold its rains; he will turn their water into blood, and torment them with thirst and hunger; and if any one shall endeavour to injure him, fire shall come forth out of his mouth, and shall burn that man. By these prodigies and powers he shall turn many to the worship of God; and when his works shall be accomplished, another king shall arise out of Syria, born from an evil spirit, the overthrower and destroyer of the human race, who shall destroy that which is left by the former evil, together with himself. He shall fight against the prophet of God, and shall overcome, and slay him, and shall suffer him to lie unburied; but after the third day he shall come to life again; and while all look on and wonder, he shall be caught up into heaven. But that king will not only be most disgraceful in himself, but he will also be a prophet of lies; and he will constitute and call himself God, and will order himself to be worshipped as the Son of God; and power will be given him to do signs and wonders, by the sight of which he may entice men to adore him. He will command fire to come down from heaven, and the sun to stand and leave his course, and an image to speak; and these things shall be done at his word,—by which miracles <a name="fr_1401"></a><a href="#fn_1401"><font size="1">1402</font></a>
  many even of the wise shall be enticed by him. Then he will attempt to destroy the temple of God, and persecute the righteous people; and there will be distress and tribulation, <a name="fr_1402"></a><a href="#fn_1402"><font size="1">1403</font></a>
  such as there never has been from the beginning of the world.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xvii-p5"></a>As many as shall believe him and unite themselves to him, shall be marked by him as sheep; but they who shall refuse his mark will either flee to the mountains, or, being seized, will be slain with studied <a name="fr_1403"></a><a href="#fn_1403"><font size="1">1404</font></a>
  tortures. He will also enwrap righteous men with the books of the prophets, and thus burn them; and power will be given him to desolate <a name="fr_1404"></a><a href="#fn_1404"><font size="1">1405</font></a>
  the whole earth for forty-two months. That will be the time in which righteousness shall be cast out, and innocence be hated; in which the wicked shall prey upon the good as enemies; neither law, nor order, nor military discipline shall be preserved; no one shall reverence hoary locks, nor recognise the duty of piety, nor pity sex or infancy; all things shall be confounded and mixed together against right, and against the laws of nature. Thus the earth shall be laid waste, as though by one common robbery. When these things shall so happen, then the righteous and the followers of truth shall separate themselves from the wicked, and flee into solitudes. And when he hears of this, the impious king, inflamed with anger, will come with a great army, and bringing up all his forces, will surround all the mountain in which the righteous shall be situated, that he may seize them. But they, when they shall see themselves <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xvii-Page_215"></a>to be shut in on all sides and besieged, will call upon God with a loud voice, and implore the aid of heaven; and God shall hear them, and send from heaven a great king to rescue and free them, and destroy all the wicked with fire and sword.  </p>
