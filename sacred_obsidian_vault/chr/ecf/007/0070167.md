 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p1"></a>And since we are speaking of the errors of philosophers, the Stoics divide nature into two parts—the one which effects, the other which affords itself tractable for action. They say that in the former is contained all the power of perception, in the latter the material, and that the one cannot act without the other. How can that which handles and that which is handled be one and the same thing? If any one should say that the potter is the same as the clay, or that the clay is the same as the potter, would he not plainly appear to be mad? But these men comprehend under the one name of nature two things which are most widely different, God and the world, the Maker and the work; and say that the one can do nothing without the other, as though God were mixed up in nature with the world. For sometimes they so mix them together, that God Himself is the mind of the world, and that the world is the body of God; as though the world and God began to exist at the same time, and God did not Himself make the world. And they themselves also confess this at other times, when they say that it was made for the sake of men, and that God could, if He willed it, exist without the world, inasmuch as God is the divine and eternal mind, separate and free from a body. And since they were unable to understand His power and majesty, they mixed Him <a name="fr_1296"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">1297</font></a>
  with the world, that is, with His own work. Whence is that saying of <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p2.4"></a>Virgil: <a name="fr_1297"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">1298</font></a>
 —  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p3.2"></a>   “A spirit whose celestial flame<br>    Glows in each member of the frame,<br>    And stirs the mighty whole.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p4"></a><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-Page_197"></a>What, then, becomes of their own saying, that the world was both made and is governed by the divine providence? For if He made the world, it follows that He existed without the world; if He governs it, it is plain that it is not as the mind governs the body, but as a master rules the house, as a pilot the ship, as a charioteer the chariot. Nor, however, are they mixed with those things which they govern. For if all these things which we see are members of God, then God is rendered insensible by them, since the members are without sensibility, and mortal, since we see that the members are mortal.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p5"></a>I can enumerate how often lands shaken by sudden motions <a name="fr_1298"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">1299</font></a>
  have either opened or sunk down precipitously; how often cities and islands have been overwhelmed by waves, and gone into the deep; marshes have inundated fruitful plains, rivers and pools have been dried up; <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">1300</font></a>
  mountains also have either fallen precipitously, or have been levelled with plains. Many districts, and the foundations of many mountains, are laid waste by latent and internal fire. And this is not enough, if God does not spare His own members, unless it is permitted man also to have some power over the body of God. Seas are built up, mountains are cut down, and the innermost bowels of the earth are dug out to draw forth riches. Why, should I say that we cannot even plough without lacerating the divine body? So that we are at once wicked and impious in doing violence to the members of God. Does God, then, suffer His body to be harassed, and endure to weaken Himself, or permit this to be done by man? Unless by chance that divine intelligence which is mixed with the world, and with all parts of the world, abandoned the first outer aspect <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">1301</font></a>
  of the earth, and plunged itself into the lowest depths, that it might be sensible of no pain from continual laceration. But if this is trifling and absurd, then they themselves were as devoid of intelligence as those are who have not perceived that the divine spirit is everywhere diffused, and that all things are held together by it, not however in such a manner that God, who is incorruptible, should Himself be mixed with heavy and corruptible elements. Therefore that is more correct which they derived from <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p8.2"></a>Plato, that the world was made by God, and is also governed by His providence. It was therefore befitting that <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p8.3"></a>Plato, and those who held the same opinion, should teach and explain what was the cause, what the reason, for the contriving of so great a work; why or for the sake of whom He made it.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p9"></a>But the Stoics also say the world was made for the sake of men. I hear. But <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p9.1"></a>Epicurus is ignorant on what account or who made men themselves. For <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p9.2"></a>Lucretius, when he said that the world was not made by the gods, thus spoke: <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">1302</font></a>
    </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p10.2"></a>   “To say, again, that for the sake of men they have willed to set in order the glorious nature of the world”—<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p11"></a>then he introduced:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p11.1"></a>   “Is sheer folly. For what advantage can our gratitude bestow on immortal and blessed beings, that for our, sake they should take in hand to administer aught?”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p12"></a>And with good reason. For they brought forward no reason why the human race was created or established by God. It is our business to set forth the mystery of the world and man, of which they, being destitute, were able neither to reach nor see the shrine of truth. Therefore, as I said a little before, when they had assumed that which was true, that is, that the world was made by God, and was made for the sake of men, yet, since their argument failed them in the consequences, they were unable to defend that which they had assumed. In fine, <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p12.1"></a>Plato, that he might not make the work of God weak and subject to ruin, said that it would remain for ever. If it was made for the sake of men, and so made as to be eternal, why then are not they on whose account it was made eternal? If they are mortal on account of whom it was made, it must also itself be mortal and subject to dissolution, for it is not of more value than those for whose sake it was made. But if his argument <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">1303</font></a>
  were consistent, he would understand that it must perish because it was made, and that nothing can remain for ever except that which cannot be touched.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p14"></a>But he who says that it was not made for the sake of men has no argument. For if he says that the Creator contrived these works of such magnitude on His own account, why then were we produced? Why do we enjoy the world itself? what means the creation of the human race, and of the other living creatures? why do we intercept the advantages of others? why, in short, do we grow, decrease, and perish? What reason is implied in our production itself? what in our perpetual succession? Doubtless God wished us to be seen, and to frame, as it were, impressions <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">1304</font></a>
  with various representations of Himself, with which He might delight Himself. Nevertheless, if it were so, He would esteem living creatures as His care, and especially man, to whose command He made all things subject. But with regard to those who say that the world always existed: I omit that point, that itself cannot exist without some beginning, from which they are unable to extricate themselves; but I <a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-Page_198"></a>say this, if the world always existed, it can have no systematic arrangement. <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">1305</font></a>
  For what could arrangement have effected in that which never had a beginning? For before anything is done or arranged, there is need of counsel that it may be determined how it should be done; nor can anything be done without the foresight of a settled plan. Therefore the plan precedes every work. Therefore that which has not been made has no plan. But the world has a plan by which it both exists and is governed; therefore also it was made: if it was made, it will also be destroyed. Let them therefore assign a reason, if they can, why it was either made in the beginning or will hereafter be destroyed.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p17"></a>And because <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p17.1"></a>Epicurus or <a name="iii.ii.vii.iii-p17.2"></a>Democritus was unable to teach this, he said that it was produced of its own accord, the seeds <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1305"><font size="1">1306</font></a>
  coming together in all directions; and that when these are again resolved, discord and destruction will follow. Therefore he perverted <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1306"><font size="1">1307</font></a>
  that which he had correctly seen, and by his ignorance of system entirely overthrew the whole system, and reduced the world, and all things which are done in it, to the likeness of a most trifling dream, if no plan exists in human affairs. But since the world and all its parts, as we see, are governed by a wonderful plan; since the framing of the heaven, and the course of the stars and of the heavenly bodies, which is harmonious <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1307"><font size="1">1308</font></a>
  even in variety itself, the constant and wonderful arrangement of the seasons, the varied fruitfulness of the lands, the level plains, the defences and heapings up of mountains, the verdure and productiveness of the woods, the most salubrious bursting forth of fountains, the seasonable overflowings of rivers, the rich and abundant flowing <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1308"><font size="1">1309</font></a>
  in of the sea, the opposite and useful breathing <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">1310</font></a>
  of the winds, and all things, are fixed with the greatest regularity: who is so blind as to think that they were made without a cause, in which a wonderful disposition of most provident arrangement shines forth? If, therefore, nothing at all exists nor is done without a cause; if the providence of the Supreme God is manifest from the disposition of things, His excellency from their greatness, and His power from their government: therefore they are dull and mad who have said that there is no providence. I should not disapprove if they denied the existence of gods with this object, that they might affirm the existence of one; but when they did it with this intent, that they might say that there is none, he who does not think that they were senseless is himself senseless.  </p>
