 <p> <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p0.1"></a>Chap. XI.—Of Living Creatures, of Man; Prometheus, Deucalion, the ParcÆ.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p1"></a>Therefore, having finished the world, He commanded that animals of various kinds and of dissimilar forms should be created, both great and smaller. And they were made in pairs, that is, one of each sex; from the offspring of which both the air and the earth and the seas were filled. And God gave nourishment to all these by their kinds <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">262</font></a>
  from the earth, that they might be of service to men: some, for instance, were for food, others for clothing; but those which are of great strength He gave, that they might assist in cultivating the earth, whence they were called beasts of burthen. <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">263</font></a>
  And thus, when all things had been settled with a wonderful arrangement, He determined to prepare for Himself an eternal kingdom, and to create innumerable souls, on whom He might bestow immortality. Then He made for Himself a figure endowed with perception and intelligence, that is, after the likeness of His own image, than which nothing can be more perfect: He formed man out of the dust of the ground, from which he was called man, <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">264</font></a>
  because He was made from the earth. Finally, <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p4.4"></a>Plato says that the human form <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">265</font></a>
  was godlike; as does the <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p5.6"></a>Sibyl, who says,—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p5.7"></a>    “Thou art my image, O man, possessed of right reason.” <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">266</font></a>
 <br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p7"></a>The poets also have not given a different account respecting this formation of man, however they may have corrupted it; for they said that man was made by <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p7.1"></a>Prometheus from clay. They were not mistaken in the matter itself, but in the name of the artificer. For they had never come into contact with a line of the truth; but the things which were handed down by the oracles of the prophets, and contained in the sacred book <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">267</font></a>
  of God; those things collected from fables and obscure opinion, and distorted, as the truth is wont to be corrupted by the multitude when spread abroad by various conversations, everyone adding something to that which he had heard,— those things they comprised in their poems; and in this, indeed, <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.2"></a>they acted</span> foolishly, in that they attributed so wonderful and divine a work to man. For what need was there that man should be formed of clay, when he might be generated in the same way in which <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.3"></a>Prometheus himself was born from <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.4"></a>Iapetus? For if he was a man, he was able to beget a man, but not to make one. But his punishment on Mount <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-Page_59"></a>Caucasus declares that he was not of the gods. But no one reckoned his father <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.5"></a>Iapetus or his uncle <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">268</font></a>
  <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.1"></a>Titan as gods, because the high dignity of the kingdom was in possession of <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.2"></a>Saturn only, by which he obtained divine honours, together with all his descendants. This invention of the poets admits of refutation by many arguments. It is agreed by all that the deluge took place for the destruction of wickedness, and for its removal from the earth. Now, both philosophers and poets, and writers of ancient history, assert the same, and in this they especially agree with the language of the prophets. If, therefore, the flood took place for the purpose of destroying wickedness, which had increased through the excessive multitude of men, how was <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.3"></a>Prometheus the maker of man, when his son <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.4"></a>Deucalion is said by the same writers to have been the only one who was preserved on account of his righteousness? How could a single descent <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">269</font></a>
  and a single generation have so quickly filled the world with men? But it is plain that they have corrupted this also, as they did the former account; since they were ignorant both at what time the flood happened on the earth, and who it was that deserved on account of his righteousness to be saved when the human race perished, and how and with whom he was saved: all of which are taught by the inspired <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">270</font></a>
  writings. It is plain, therefore, that the account which they give respecting the work of <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p11.1"></a>Prometheus is false.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p12"></a>But because I had said <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">271</font></a>
  that the poets are not accustomed to speak that which is altogether untrue, but to wrap up in figures and thus to obscure their accounts, I do not say that they spoke falsely in this, but that first of all <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p13.3"></a>Prometheus made the image of a man of rich and soft clay, and that he first originated the art of making statues and images; inasmuch as he lived in the times of <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p13.4"></a>Jupiter, during which temples began to be built, and new modes of worshipping the gods introduced. And thus the truth was corrupted by falsehood; and that which was said to have been made by God began also to be ascribed to man, who imitated the divine work. But the making of the true and living man from clay is the work of God. And this also is related by Hermes, <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">272</font></a>
  who not only says that man was made by God, after the image of God, but he even tried to explain in how skilful a manner He formed each limb in the human body, since there is none of them which is not as available for the necessity of use as for beauty. But even the Stoics, when they discuss the subject of providence, attempt to do this; and <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p14.4"></a>Tully followed them in many places. But, however, he briefly treats of a subject so copious and fruitful, which I now pass over on this account, because I have lately written a particular book on this subject to my disciple <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p14.5"></a>Demetrianus. But I cannot here omit that which some erring philosophers say, that men and the other animals arose from the earth without any author; whence that expression of Virgil: <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">273</font></a>
 —  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p15.3"></a>   “And the earth-born <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">274</font></a>
  race of men raised its head from the hard fields.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p17"></a>And this opinion is especially entertained by those who deny the existence of a <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p17.1"></a>divine</span> providence. For the Stoics attribute the formation of animals to divine skill. But <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p17.2"></a>Aristotle freed himself from labour and trouble, by saying that the world always existed, and therefore that the human race, and the other things which are in it, had no beginning, but always had been, and always would be. But when we see that each animal separately, which had no previous existence, begins to exist, and ceases to exist, it is necessary that the whole race must at some time have begun to exist, and must cease at some time because it had a beginning.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p18"></a>For all things must necessarily be comprised in three periods of time—the past, the present, and the future. The commencement <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">275</font></a>
  belongs to the past, existence to the present, dissolution to the future. And all these things are seen in the case of men individually: for we begin when we are born; and we exist while we live; and we cease when we die. On which account they would have it that there are three Parcæ: <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">276</font></a>
  one who warps the web of life for men; the second, who weaves it; the third, who cuts and finishes it. But in the whole race of men, because the present time only is seen, yet from it the past also, that is, the commencement, and the future, that is, the dissolution, are inferred. For since it exists, it is evident that at some time it began to exist, for nothing can exist without a beginning; and because it had a beginning, it is evident that it will at some time have an end. For that cannot, as a whole, be immortal, which consists of mortals. For as we all die individually, it is possible that, by some calamity, all may perish simultaneously: either through the unproductiveness of the earth, which sometimes happens in particular cases; or through the general spread of pestilence, which often desolates separate cities and countries; or by the conflagration of the world, as is said to have happened in the case of Phaethon; or by a deluge, as is reported in the time of <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p20.5"></a>Deucalion, when <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-Page_60"></a>the whole race was destroyed with the exception of one man. And if this deluge happened by chance, it might assuredly have happened that he who was the only survivor should perish. But if he was reserved by the will of divine providence, as it cannot be denied, to recruit mankind, it is evident that the life and the destruction of the human race are in the power of God. And if it is possible for it to die altogether, because it dies in parts, it is evident that it had an origin at some time; and as the liability to decay <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">277</font></a>
  bespeaks a beginning, so also it gives proof of an end. And if these things are true, <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.1"></a>Aristotle will be unable to maintain that the world also itself had no beginning. But if <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.2"></a>Plato and <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.3"></a>Epicurus extort this from <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.4"></a>Aristotle, yet <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.5"></a>Plato and <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.6"></a>Aristotle, who thought that the world would be everlasting, will, notwithstanding their eloquence, be deprived of this also by <a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.7"></a>Epicurus, because it follows, that, <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.8"></a>as it had a beginning</span>, it must also have an end. But we will speak of these things at greater length in the last book. Now let us revert to the origin of man.  </p>
