 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1"></a>Whence did <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.1"></a>Ceres bring forth <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.2"></a>Proserpine, except from debauchery? Whence did <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.3"></a>Latona bring forth her twins, except from crime? <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.4"></a>Venus having been subject to the lusts of gods and men, when she reigned in Cyprus, invented the practice of courtesanship, and commanded women to make traffic of themselves, that she might not alone be infamous. Were the virgins themselves, <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.5"></a>Minerva and <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.6"></a>Diana, chaste? Whence, then, did <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.7"></a>Erichthonius arise? Did <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.8"></a>Vulcan shed his seed upon the ground, and was man born from that as a fungus? Or why did <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.9"></a>Diana banish <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.10"></a>Hippolytus either to a retired place, or give him up to a woman, where he might pass his life in solitude among unknown groves, and having now changed his name, might be called <a name="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.11"></a>Virbius? What do these things signify but impurity, which the poets do not venture to confess?  </p>
