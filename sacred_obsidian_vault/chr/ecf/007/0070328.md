 <p> <a name="iii.v.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.v.xix-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIX.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xix-p1"></a>Matters having been thus concerted, <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.1"></a>Diocletian and <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.2"></a>Galerius went in procession to publish the nomination of <span><a name="iii.v.xix-p1.3"></a>Cæsars</span>. Every one looked at <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.4"></a>Constantine; for there was no doubt that the choice would fall on him. The troops present, as well as the chief soldiers of the other legions, who had been summoned to the solemnity, fixed their eyes on <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.5"></a>Constantine, exulted in the hope of his approaching election, and occupied themselves in prayers for his prosperity. Near three miles from Nicomedia there is an eminence, on the summit of which <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.6"></a>Galerius formerly received the purple; and <span><a name="iii.v.xix-p1.7"></a>there</span> a pillar, with the statue of <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.8"></a>Jupiter, was placed. Thither the procession went. An assembly of the soldiers was called. <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.9"></a>Diocletian, with tears, harangued them, and said that he was become infirm, that he needed repose after his fatigues, and that he would resign the empire into hands more vigorous and able, and at the same time appoint new <span><a name="iii.v.xix-p1.10"></a>Cæsars</span>. The spectators, with the utmost earnestness, waited for the nomination. Suddenly he declared that <a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a> <a name="iii.v.xix-Page_309"></a>the <span><a name="iii.v.xix-p1.11"></a>Cæsars</span> were <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.12"></a>Severus and <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.13"></a>Maximin. The amazement was universal. <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.14"></a>Constantine stood near in public view, and men began to question amongst themselves whether his name too had not been changed into <span><a name="iii.v.xix-p1.15"></a>Maximin</span>; when, in the sight of all, <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.16"></a>Galerius, stretching back his hand, put <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.17"></a>Constantine aside, and drew <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.18"></a>Daia forward, and, having divested him of the garb of a private person, set him in the most conspicuous place. All men wondered who he could be, and from whence he came; but none ventured to interpose or move objections, so confounded were their minds at the strange and unlooked-for event. <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.19"></a>Diocletian took off his purple robe, put it on <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.20"></a>Daia, and resumed his own original name of <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.21"></a>Diocles. He descended from the tribunal, and passed through Nicomedia in a chariot; and then this old emperor, like a veteran soldier freed from military service, was dismissed into his own country; while <a name="iii.v.xix-p1.22"></a>Daia, lately taken from the tending of cattle in forests to serve as a common soldier, immediately made one of the life-guard, presently a tribune, and next day <span><a name="iii.v.xix-p1.23"></a>Cæsar</span>, obtained authority to trample under foot and oppress the empire of the East; a person ignorant alike of war and of civil affairs, and from a herdsman become a leader of armies.  </p>
