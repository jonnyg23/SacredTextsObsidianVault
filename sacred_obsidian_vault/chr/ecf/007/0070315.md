 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.vi-p1"></a><a name="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></a>Aurelian might have recollected the fate of the captived emperor, yet, being of a nature outrageous and headstrong, he forgot both <span><a name="iii.v.vi-p1.2"></a>his</span> sin and its punishment, and by deeds of cruelty irritated the divine wrath. He was not, however, permitted to accomplish what he had devised; for just as he began to give a loose to his rage, he was slain. His bloody edicts had not yet reached the more distant provinces, when he himself lay all bloody on the earth at Cænophrurium in Thrace, assassinated by his familiar friends, who had taken up groundless suspicions against him.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.vi-p2"></a>Examples of such a nature, and so numerous, ought to have deterred succeeding tyrants; nevertheless they were not only not dismayed, but, in their misdeeds against God, became more bold and presumptuous.  </p>
