 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p1"></a>These are the opinions entertained by the philosophers respecting God. But if we have discovered that these things which have been spoken are false, there remains that one last resource, in which alone the truth can be found, which has never been embraced by philosophers, nor at any time defended: that it follows that God is angry, since He is moved by kindness. This opinion is to be maintained and asserted by us; for <a name="fr_1650"></a><a href="#fn_1650"><font size="1">1651</font></a>
  this is the sum and turning-point on which the whole of piety and religion depend: and no honour can be due to God, if He affords nothing to His worshippers; and no fear, if He is not angry with him who does not worship Him. <a name="fr_1651"></a><a href="#fn_1651"><font size="1">1652</font></a>
