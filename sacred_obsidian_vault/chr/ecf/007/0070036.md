 <p> <a name="iii.ii.ii.vi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-p0.1"></a>Chap. vI.—that neither the whole universe nor the elements are god, nor are they possessed of life.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-p1"></a>In like manner, if the land on which we tread, and which we subdue and cultivate for food, is not a god, then the plains and mountains will not be gods; and if these are not so, it follows that the whole of the earth cannot appear to be God. In like manner, if the water, which is <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-Page_49"></a>adapted to the wants <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">168</font></a>
  of living creatures for the purpose of drinking and bathing, is not a god, neither are the fountains <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-p2.1"></a>gods</span> from which the water flows. And if the fountains are not gods, neither are the rivers, which are collected from the fountains. And if the rivers also are not gods, it follows that the sea, which is made up of rivers, cannot be considered as God. But if neither the heaven, nor the earth, nor the sea, which are the parts of the world, can be gods, it follows that the world altogether is not God; whereas the same Stoics contend that it is both living and wise, and therefore God. But in this they are so inconsistent, that nothing is said by them which they do not also overthrow. For they argue thus: It is impossible that that which produces from itself sensible objects should itself be insensible. But the world produces man, who is endowed with sensibility; therefore it must also itself be sensible. Also they argue: that cannot be without sensibility, a part of which is sensible; therefore, because man is sensible, the world, of which man is a part, also possesses sensibility. The propositions <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">169</font></a>
  themselves are true, that that which produces a being endowed with sense is itself sensible; and that that possesses sense, a part of which is endowed with sense. But the assumptions by which they draw their conclusions are false; for the world does not produce man, nor is man a part of the world. For the same God who created the world, also created man from the beginning: and man is not a part of the world, in the same manner in which a limb is a part of the body; for it is possible for the world to be without man, as it is for a city or house. Now, as a house is the dwelling-place of one man, and a city of one people, so also the world is the abode <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">170</font></a>
  of the whole human race; and that which is inhabited is one thing, that which inhabits another. But these persons, in their eagerness to prove that which they had falsely assumed, that the world is possessed of sensibility, and is God, did not perceive the consequences of their own arguments. For if man is a part of the world, and if the world is endowed with sensibility because man is sensible, therefore it follows that, because man is mortal, the world must also of necessity be mortal, and not only mortal, but also liable to all kinds of disease and suffering. And, on the contrary, if the world is God, its parts also are plainly immortal: therefore man also is God, because he is, as you say, a part of the world. And if man, then also both beasts of burden and cattle, and the other kinds of beasts and of birds, and fishes, since these also in the same manner are possessed of sensibility, and are parts of the world. But this is endurable; for the Egyptians worship even these. But the matter comes to this: that even frogs, and gnats, and ants appear to be gods, because these also have sensibility, and are parts of the world. Thus arguments drawn from a false <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-p4.3"></a>source</span> always lead to foolish and absurd conclusions. Why should I mention that the same <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-p4.4"></a>philosophers</span> assert that the world was constructed <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">171</font></a>
  for the sake of gods and men as a common dwelling? Therefore the world is neither god, nor living, if it has been made: for a living creature is not made, but born; and if it has been built, it has been built as a house or ship <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-p5.3"></a>is built</span>. Therefore there is a builder of the world, <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.vi-p5.4"></a>even</span> God; and the world which has been made is distinct from Him who made it. Now, how inconsistent and absurd is it, that when they affirm that the heavenly fires <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">172</font></a>
  and the other elements of the world are gods, they also say that the world itself is God! How is it possible that out of a great heap of gods one God can be made up? If the stars are gods, it follows that the world is not God, but the dwelling-place of gods. But if the world is God, it follows that all the things which are in it are not gods, but members <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">173</font></a>
  of God, which clearly cannot by themselves <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">174</font></a>
  take the name of God. For no one can rightly say that the members of one man are many men; but, however, there is no similar comparison between a living being and the world. For because a living being is endowed with sensibility, its members also have sensibility; nor do they become senseless <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">175</font></a>
  unless they are separated from the body. But what resemblance does the world present to this? Truly they themselves tell us, since they do not deny that it was made, that it might be, as it were, a common abode for gods and men. If, therefore, it has been constructed as an abode, it is neither itself God, nor are the elements which are its parts; because a house cannot bear rule over itself, nor can the parts of which a house consists. Therefore they are refuted not only by the truth, but even by their own words. For as a house, made for the purpose of being inhabited, has no sensibility by itself, and is subject to the master who built or inhabits it; so the world, having no sensibility of itself, is subject to God its Maker, who made it for His own use.   </p>
