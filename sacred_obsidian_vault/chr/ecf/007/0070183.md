 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIX.—Of the Advent of Christ to Judgment, and of the Overcoming of the False Prophet.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p1"></a>The world therefore being oppressed, since the resources of men shall be insufficient for the overthrow of a tyranny of immense strength, inasmuch as it will press upon the captive world with great armies of robbers, that calamity so great will stand in need of divine assistance. Therefore God, being aroused both by the doubtful danger and by the wretched lamentation of the righteous, will immediately send a deliverer. Then the middle of the heaven shall be laid open in the dead and darkness of the night, that the light of the descending God may be manifest in all the world as lightning: of which the <a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p1.1"></a>Sibyl spoke in these words:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p1.2"></a>   “When He shall come, there will be fire and darkness in the midst of the black night.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p2"></a>This is the night which is celebrated by us in watchfulness on account of the coming of our King and God: <a name="fr_1405"></a><a href="#fn_1405"><font size="1">1406</font></a>
  of which night there is a twofold meaning; because in it He then received life when He suffered, and hereafter He is about to receive the kingdom of the world. For He is the Deliverer, and Judge, and Avenger, and King, and God, whom we call Christ, who before He descends will give this sign: There shall suddenly fall from heaven a sword, that the righteous may know that the leader of the sacred warfare is about to descend; and He shall descend with a company of angels to the middle of the earth, and there shall go before Him an unquenchable fire, and the power of the angels shall deliver into the hands of the just that multitude which has surrounded the mountain, and they shall be slain from the third hour until the evening, and blood shall flow like a torrent; and all his forces being destroyed, the wicked one shall alone escape, and his power shall perish from him.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p4"></a>Now this is he who is called Antichrist; but he shall falsely call himself Christ, and shall fight against the truth, and being overcome shall flee; and shall often renew the war, and often be conquered, until in the fourth battle, all the wicked being slain, subdued, and captured, he shall at length pay the penalty of his crimes. But other princes also and tyrants who have harassed the world, together with him, shall be led in chains to the king; and he shall rebuke them, and reprove them, and upbraid them with their crimes, and condemn them, and consign them to deserved tortures. Thus, wickedness being extinguished and impiety suppressed, the world will be at rest, which having been subject <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-Page_216"></a>to error and wickedness for so many ages, endured dreadful slavery. No longer shall gods made by the hands be worshipped; but the images being thrust out from their temples and couches, shall be given to the fire, and shall be burnt, together with their wonderful gifts: which also the <a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p4.1"></a>Sibyl, in accordance with the prophets, announced as about to take place:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p4.2"></a>   “But mortals shall break in pieces the images and all the wealth.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p5"></a>The <a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p5.1"></a>Erythræan Sibyl also made the same promise:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xix-p5.2"></a>   “And the works made by the hand of the gods shall be burnt up.”<br>  </blockquote>
