 <p> <a name="iii.iii.xii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.iii.xii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XII.—Of Religion and the Fear of God.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.xii-p1"></a>Now, since we have replied to the impious and detestable wisdom, <a name="fr_1713"></a><a href="#fn_1713"><font size="1">1714</font></a>
  or rather senselessness of some, let us return to our proposed subject. We have said that, if religion is taken away, neither wisdom nor justice can be retained: wisdom, because the understanding of the divine nature, in which we differ from the brutes, is found in man alone; justice, because unless God, who cannot be deceived, shall restrain our desires, we shall live wickedly and impiously. Therefore, that our actions should be viewed by God, pertains not only to the usefulness of common life, but even to the truth; because, if religion and justice are taken away, having lost our reason, we either descend to the senselessness <a name="fr_1714"></a><a href="#fn_1714"><font size="1">1715</font></a>
  of the herds; or to the savageness of the beasts, yea, even more so, since the beasts spare animals of their own kind. What will be more savage, what more unmerciful, than man, if, the fear of a superior being taken away, he shall be able either to escape the notice of or to despise the might of the laws? It is therefore the fear of God alone which guards the mutual society of men, by which life itself is sustained, protected, and governed. But that fear is taken away if man is persuaded that God is without anger; for that He is moved and indignant when unjust actions are done, not only the common advantage, but even reason itself, and truth, persuade us. We must again return to the former subjects, that, as we have taught that the world was made by God, we may teach why it was made.  </p>
