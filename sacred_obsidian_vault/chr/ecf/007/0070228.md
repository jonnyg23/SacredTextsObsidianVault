 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1"></a>There are innumerable sayings and doings of the philosophers, by which their foolishness may be shown. Therefore, since we are unable to enumerate them all, a few will be sufficient. It is enough that it is understood that the philosophers were neither teachers of justice, of which they were ignorant, nor of virtue, of which they falsely boast. For what can they teach, who often confess their own ignorance? I omit to mention <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.1"></a>Socrates, whose opinion is well known. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.2"></a>Anaxagoras proclaims that all things are over-spread with darkness. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.3"></a>Empedocles says that the paths for finding out the truth of the senses are narrow. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.4"></a>Democritus asserts that truth lies sunk in a deep well; and because they nowhere find it, they therefore affirm that no wise man has as yet existed. Since, therefore, human wisdom has no existence (<a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.5"></a>Socrates says in the writings of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.6"></a>Plato), let us follow that which is divine, and let us give thanks to God, who has revealed and delivered it to us; and let us congratulate ourselves, that through the divine bounty we possess the truth and wisdom, which, though sought by so many intellects through so many ages, philosophy <a name="fr_1509"></a><a href="#fn_1509"><font size="1">1510</font></a>
  was not able to discover.  </p>
