 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxv-p0.1"></a>Chap. XXV.—Of the Last Times, and of the City of Rome.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxv-p1"></a>These are the things which are spoken of by the prophets as about to happen hereafter: but I have not considered it necessary to bring forward their testimonies and words, since it would be an endless task; nor would the limits of my book receive so great a multitude of subjects, since so many with one breath speak similar things; and at the same time, lest weariness should be occasioned to the readers if I should heap together things collected and transferred from all; moreover, that I might confirm those very things which I said, not by my own writings, but in an especial manner by the writings of others, and might show that not only among us, but even with those very persons who revile us, the truth is preserved, <a name="fr_1425"></a><a href="#fn_1425"><font size="1">1426</font></a>
  which they refuse to acknowledge. <a name="fr_1426"></a><a href="#fn_1426"><font size="1">1427</font></a>
  But he who wishes to know these things more accurately may draw from the fountain itself, and he will know more things worthy of admiration than we have comprised in these books. Perhaps some one may now ask when these things of which we have spoken are about to come to pass? I have already shown above, that when six thousand years shall be completed this change must take place, and that the last day of the extreme conclusion is now drawing near. It is permitted us to know respecting the signs, which are spoken by the prophets, for they foretold signs by which the consummation of the times is to be expected by us from day to day, and to be feared. When, however, this amount will be completed, those teach, who have written respecting the times, collecting them from the sacred writings and from various histories, how great is the number of years from the beginning of the world. And although they vary, and the amount of the number as reckoned by them differs considerably, yet all expectation does not exceed the limit of two hundred years. The subject itself declares that the fall and ruin of the world will shortly take place; except that while the city of Rome remains it appears that nothing of this kind is to be feared. <a name="fr_1427"></a><a href="#fn_1427"><font size="1">1428</font></a>
  But when that capital of the world shall have fallen, and shall have begun to be a street, <a name="fr_1428"></a><a href="#fn_1428"><font size="1">1429</font></a>
  which the Sibyls say shall come to pass, who can doubt that the end has now arrived to the affairs of men and the whole world? It is that city, that only, which still sustains all things; and the God of heaven is to be entreated by us and implored—if, indeed, His arrangements and decrees can be delayed—lest, sooner than we think for, that detestable tyrant should come who will undertake so great a deed, and dig out that eye, by the destruction of which the world itself is about to fall. Now let us return, to set forth the other things which are then about to follow.  </p>
