 <p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIV.—The Actions of Saturnus and Uranus Taken from the Historians.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1"></a>Let us pass on to former things, that we may discover the origin of the whole error. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.1"></a>Saturnus is said to have been born of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.2"></a>Cœlus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.3"></a>Terra. This is plainly incredible; but there is a certain reason why it is thus related, and he who is ignorant of this rejects it as a fable. That <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.4"></a>Uranus was the father of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.5"></a>Saturnus, both <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.6"></a>Hermes affirms, and sacred history teaches. When <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.7"></a>Trismegistus said that there were very few men of perfect learning, he enumerated among them his relatives, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.8"></a>Uranus, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.9"></a>Saturnus, and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.10"></a>Mercurius. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.11"></a>Euhemerus relates that the same <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.12"></a>Uranus was the first who reigned on earth, using these words: “In the beginning <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.13"></a>Cœlus first had the chief power on earth: he instituted and prepared that kingdom for himself together with his brothers.” <a name="fr_1466"></a><a href="#fn_1466"><font size="1">1467</font></a>
