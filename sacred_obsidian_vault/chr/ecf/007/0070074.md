 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p1"></a>Since, therefore, the leading men among the philosophers are themselves discovered to be of such emptiness, what shall we think of those lesser <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">463</font></a>
  ones, who are accustomed never to appear to themselves so wise, as when they boast of their contempt of money? Brave spirit! But I wait to see their conduct, and what are the results of that contempt. They avoid as an evil, and abandon the property handed down to them from their parents. And lest they should suffer shipwreck in a storm, they plunge headlong of their own accord in a calm, being resolute not by virtue, but by perverse fear; as those who, through fear of being slain by the enemy, slay themselves, that by death they may avoid death. So these men, without honour and without influence, throw away the means by which they might have acquired the glory of liberality. <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p2.1"></a>Democritus is praised because he abandoned his fields, and suffered them to become public pastures. I should approve of it, if he had given them. But nothing is done wisely which is useless and evil if it is done by all. But this negligence is tolerable. What shall I say of him who changed his possessions into money, which he threw into the sea? I doubt whether he was in his senses, or deranged. Away, he says, ye evil desires, into the deep. I will cast you away, lest I myself should be cast away by you. If you have so great a contempt for money, employ it in acts of kindness and humanity, bestow it upon the poor; this, which you are about to throw away, may be a succour to many, so that they may not die through famine, or thirst, or nakedness. Imitate at least the madness and fury of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p2.2"></a>Tuditanus; <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">464</font></a>
  scatter abroad your property to be seized by the people. You have it in your power both to escape the possession of money, and yet to lay it out to advantage; for whatever has been profitable to many is securely laid out.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p4"></a>But who approves of the equality of faults as laid down by <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p4.1"></a>Zeno? But let us omit that which is always received with derision by all. This is sufficient to prove the error of this madman, that he places pity among vices and diseases. He deprives us of an affection, which involves almost the whole course of human life. For since the nature of man is more feeble than that of the other animals, which divine providence <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-Page_94"></a>has armed with natural means of protection, <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">465</font></a>
  either to endure the severity of the seasons or to ward off attacks from their bodies, because none of these things has been given to man, he has received in the place of all these things the affection of pity, which is truly called humanity, by which we might mutually protect each other. For if a man were rendered savage by the sight of another man, which we see happen in the case of those animals which are of a solitary <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">466</font></a>
  nature, there would be no society among men, no care or system in the building of cities; and thus life would not even be safe, since the weakness of men would both be exposed to the attacks of the other animals, and they would rage among themselves after the manner of wild beasts. Nor is his madness less in other things.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p7"></a>For what can be said respecting him who asserted that snow was black? How naturally it followed, that he should also assert that pitch was white! This is he who said that he was born for this purpose, that he might behold the heaven and the sun, who beheld nothing on the earth when the sun was shining. <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p7.1"></a>Xenophanes most foolishly believed mathematicians who said that the orb of the moon was eighteen times larger than the earth; and, as was consistent with this folly, he said that within the concave surface of the moon there was another earth, and that there another race of men live in a similar manner to that in which we live on this earth. Therefore these lunatics have another moon, to hold forth to them a light by night, as this does to us. And perhaps this globe of ours may be a moon to another earth below this. <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">467</font></a>
  <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxiii-p8.2"></a>Seneca says that there was one among the Stoics who used to deliberate whether he should assign to the sun also its own inhabitants; he acted foolishly in doubting. For what injury would he have inflicted if he had assigned them? But I believe the heat deterred him, so as not to imperil so great a multitude; lest, if they should perish through excessive heat, so great a calamity should be said to have happened by his fault.  </p>
