 <p> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIX.—Cicero and Others of the Wisest Men Teach the Immortality of the Soul, But in an Unbelieving Manner; And that a Good or an Evil Death Must Be Weighed from the Previous Life.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p1"></a>But those who assert the advantage of death, because they know nothing of the truth, thus reason: If there is nothing after death, death is <a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-Page_90"></a>not an evil; for it takes away the perception of evil. But if the soul survives, death is even an advantage; because immortality follows. And this sentiment is thus set forth by <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p1.1"></a>Cicero concerning the Laws: <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">450</font></a>
  “We may congratulate ourselves, since death is about to bring either a better state than that which exists in life, or at any rate not a worse. For if the soul is in a state of vigour without the body, it is a divine life; and if it is without perception, assuredly there is no evil.” Cleverly argued, as it appeared to himself, as though there could be no other state. But each conclusion is false. For the sacred writings <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">451</font></a>
  teach that the soul is not annihilated; but that it is either rewarded according to its righteousness, or eternally punished according to its crimes. For neither is it right, that he who has lived a life of wickedness in prosperity should escape the punishment which he deserves; nor that he who has been wretched on account of his righteousness, should be deprived of his reward. And this is so true, that <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p3.4"></a>Tully also, in his <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p3.5"></a>Consolation, declared that the righteous and the wicked do not inhabit the same abodes. For those same wise men, he says, did not judge that the same course was open for all into the heaven; for they taught that those who were contaminated by vices and crimes were thrust down into darkness, and lay in the mire; but that, on the other hand, souls that were chaste, pure, upright, and uncontaminated, being also refined by the study and practice of virtue, by a light and easy course take their flight to the gods, that is, to a nature resembling their own. But this sentiment is opposed to the former argument. For that is based on the assumption that every man at his birth is presented with immortality. What distinction, therefore, will there be between virtue and guilt, if it makes no difference whether a man be <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p3.6"></a>Aristides or <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p3.7"></a>Phalaris, whether he be <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p3.8"></a>Cato or <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p3.9"></a>Catiline? But a man does not perceive this opposition between sentiments and actions, unless he is in possession of the truth. If any one, therefore, should ask me whether death is a good or an evil, I shall reply that its character depends upon the course of the life. For as life itself is a good if it is passed virtuously, but an evil if it is spent viciously, so also death is to be weighed in accordance with the past actions of life. And so it comes to pass, that if life has been passed in the service of God, death is not an evil, for it is a translation to immortality. But if not so, death must necessarily be an evil, since it transfers men, as I have said, to everlasting punishment. <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">452</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p5"></a>What, then, shall we say, but that they are in error who either desire death as a good, or flee from life as an evil? unless they are most unjust, who do not weigh the fewer evils against the greater number of blessings. For when they pass all their lives in a variety of the choicest gratifications, if any bitterness has chanced to succeed to these, they desire to die; and they so regard it as to appear never to have fared well, if at any time they happen to fare ill. Therefore they condemn the whole of life, and consider it as nothing else than filled with evils. Hence arose that foolish sentiment, that this state which we imagine to be life is death, and that that which we fear as death is life; and so that the first good is not to be born, that the second is an early death. And that this sentiment may be of greater weight, it is attributed to <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p5.1"></a>Silenus. <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">453</font></a>
  <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p6.3"></a>Cicero in his <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p6.4"></a>Consolation says: “Not to be born is by far the best thing, and not to fall upon these rocks of life. But the next thing is, if you have been born, to die as soon as possible, and to flee from the violence of fortune as from a conflagration.” That he believed this most foolish expression appears from this, that he added something of his own for its embellishment. I ask, therefore, for whom he thinks it best not to be born, when there is no one at all who has any perception; for it is the perception which causes anything to be good or bad. In the next place, why did he regard the whole of life as nothing else than rocks, and a conflagration; as though it were either in our power not to be born, or life were given to us by fortune, and not by God, or as though the course of life appeared to bear any resemblance to a conflagration?   </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p7"></a>The saying of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p7.1"></a>Plato is not dissimilar, that he gave thanks to nature, first that he was born a human being rather than a dumb animal; in the next place, that he was a man rather than a woman; that he was a Greek rather than a barbarian; <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">454</font></a>
  lastly, that he was an Athenian, and that he was born in the time of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p8.1"></a>Socrates. It is impossible to say what great blindness and errors are produced by ignorance of the truth would altogether contend that nothing in the affairs of men was ever spoken more foolishly. As though, if he had been born a barbarian, or a woman, or, in fine, an ass, he would be the same <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p8.2"></a>Plato, and not that very being which had been produced. But he evidently believed <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p8.3"></a>Pythagoras, who, in order that he might prevent men from feeding on animals, said that souls passed from the bodies of men to the bodies of other animals; which is both foolish and impossible. It is foolish, because it was unnecessary to introduce souls that have long existed into new bodies, <a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-Page_91"></a>when the same Artificer who at one time had made the first, was always able to make fresh ones; it is impossible, because the soul endued with right reason can no more change the nature of its condition, than fire can rush downwards, or, like a river, pour its flame obliquely. <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">455</font></a>
  The wise man therefore imagined, that it might come to pass that the soul which was then in <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.2"></a>Plato might be shut up in some other animal, and might be endued with the sensibility of a man, so as to understand and grieve that it was burthened with an incongruous body. How much more rationally would he have acted, if he had said that he gave thanks because he was born with a good capacity, and capable of receiving instruction, and that he was possessed of those resources which enabled him to receive a liberal education! For what benefit was it that he was born at Athens? Have not many men of distinguished talent and learning lived in other cities, who were better individually than all the Athenians? How many thousands must we believe that there were, who, though born at Athens, and in the times of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.3"></a>Socrates, were nevertheless unlearned and foolish? For it is not the walls or the place in which any one was born that can invest a man with wisdom. Of what avail was it to congratulate himself that he was born in the times of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.4"></a>Socrates? Was <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.5"></a>Socrates able to supply talent to learners? It did not occur to <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.6"></a>Plato that <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.7"></a>Alcibiades also, and <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.8"></a>Critias, were constant hearers of the same <a name="iii.ii.iii.xix-p9.9"></a>Socrates, the one of whom was the most active enemy of his country, the other the most cruel of all tyrants.  </p>
