 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.li-p1"></a>But they say that those are rightly and deservedly punished, who dislike the public rites of religion handed down to them by their ancestors. What if those ancestors were foolish in undertaking vain religious rites, as we have shown before, <a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.viii.li-Page_245"></a>shall we be prohibited from following true and better things? Why do we deprive ourselves of liberty, and become enslaved to the errors of others, as though bound <a name="fr_1569"></a><a href="#fn_1569"><font size="1">1570</font></a>
  to them? Let it be permitted us to be wise, let it be permitted us to inquire into the truth. But, however, if it pleases them to defend <span><a name="iii.ii.viii.li-p2.2"></a>the folly</span> <a name="fr_1570"></a><a href="#fn_1570"><font size="1">1571</font></a>
  of their ancestors, why are the Egyptians suffered to escape, who worship cattle and beasts of every kind as deities? Why are the gods themselves made the subjects of comic <a name="fr_1571"></a><a href="#fn_1571"><font size="1">1572</font></a>
  representations? and why is he honoured who derides them most wittily? Why are philosophers attended to, who either say that there are no gods, or that, if there are any, they take no interest in, and do not regard the affairs of men, or argue that there is no providence at all, which rules the world?  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.li-p5"></a>But they alone of all are judged impious who follow God and the truth. And since this is at once justice, and wisdom, they lay to its charge either impiety or folly, and do not perceive what it is which deceives them, when they call evil good, and good evil. Many indeed of the philosophers, and especially <a name="iii.ii.viii.li-p5.1"></a>Plato and <a name="iii.ii.viii.li-p5.2"></a>Aristotle, spoke many things about justice, asserting and extolling that virtue with the greatest praise, because it gives to each its due, because it maintains equity in all things; and whereas the other virtues are as it were silent, and shut up within, that it is justice alone which is neither concerned <a name="fr_1572"></a><a href="#fn_1572"><font size="1">1573</font></a>
  for itself only, nor hidden, but altogether shows itself <a name="fr_1573"></a><a href="#fn_1573"><font size="1">1574</font></a>
  abroad, and is ready for conferring a benefit, so as to assist as many as possible: as though in truth justice ought to be in judges only, and those placed in any post of authority, and not in all men.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.li-p8"></a>And yet there is no one of men, not even of the lowest and of beggars, who is not capable of justice. But because they did not know what it was, from what source it proceeded, and what was its mode of operation, they assigned to a few only that highest virtue, that is, the common good of all, and said that it aimed at <a name="fr_1574"></a><a href="#fn_1574"><font size="1">1575</font></a>
  no advantages peculiar to itself, but only the interests of others. And not without reason was <a name="iii.ii.viii.li-p9.2"></a>Carneades raised up, a man of the greatest talent and penetration, to refute their speech, and overthrow the justice, which had no firm foundation; not because he thought that justice was to be blamed, but that he might show that its defenders brought forward no firm or certain argument respecting justice.  </p>
