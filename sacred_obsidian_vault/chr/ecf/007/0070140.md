 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p0.1"></a>Chap. II.—Of the Worship of False Gods and the True God.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p1"></a>Therefore they sacrifice fine and fat victims to God, as though He were hungry; they pour forth wine to Him, as though He were thirsty; they kindle lights to Him, as though He were in darkness. <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">1082</font></a>
  But if they were able to conjecture or to conceive in their mind what those heavenly goods are, the greatness of which we cannot imagine, while we are still encompassed with an earthly body, they would at once know that they are most foolish with their empty offices. Or if they would contemplate that heavenly light which we call the sun, they will at once perceive how God has no need of their candles, who has Himself given so clear and bright a light for the use of man. <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1082"><font size="1">1083</font></a>
  And when, in so small a circle, which on account of its distance appears to have a measure no greater than that of a human head, there is still so much brilliancy that mortal eye cannot behold it, and if you should direct your eye to it for a short time mist and darkness would overspread your dimmed eyes, what light, I pray, what brightness, must we suppose that there is in God, with whom there is no night? For He has so attempered this very light, that it might neither injure living creatures by excessive brightness or vehement heat, and has given it so much of these properties as mortal bodies might endure or the ripening of the crops require. Is that man, therefore, to be thought in his senses, who presents the light of candles and torches as an offering to Him who is the Author and Giver of light? The light which He requires from us is of another kind, and that indeed not accompanied with smoke, but (as the poet says) clear and bright; I mean the light of the mind, on account of which we are called by the poets <span class="Foreign"><a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p3.1"></a>photes</span>, <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1083"><font size="1">1084</font></a>
  which light no one can exhibit unless he has known God. But their gods, because they are of the earth, stand in need of lights, that they may not be in darkness; and their worshippers, because they have no taste for anything heavenly, are recalled to the earth even by the religious rites to which they are devoted. <a name="fr_1084"></a><a href="#fn_1084"><font size="1">1085</font></a>
  For on the earth there is need of a light, because its system and nature are dark. Therefore they do not attribute to the gods a heavenly perception, but rather a human one. And on this account they believe that the same things are necessary and pleasing to them as to us, who, when hungry, have need of food; or, when thirsty, of drink; or, when we are cold, require a garment; or, when the sun has withdrawn himself, require a light that we may be able to see. <a name="fr_1085"></a><a href="#fn_1085"><font size="1">1086</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p7"></a>From nothing, therefore, can it be so plainly proved and understood that those gods, since they once lived, are dead, as from their worship itself, which is altogether of the earth. For what heavenly influence can there be in the shedding of the blood of beasts, with which they stain their altars? unless by chance they imagine that the gods feed upon that which men shrink from touching. And whoever shall have offered to them this food, <a name="fr_1086"></a><a href="#fn_1086"><font size="1">1087</font></a>
  although he be an assassin, an adulterer, a sorcerer, or a parricide, he will he happy and prosperous. Him they love, him they defend, to him they afford all things which he shall wish for. <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p8.2"></a>Persius therefore deservedly ridicules superstitions of this kind in his own style: <a name="fr_1087"></a><a href="#fn_1087"><font size="1">1088</font></a>
  “With what bribe,” he says, “dost thou win the ears of gods? Is it with lungs and rich intestines?” He plainly perceived that there is no need of flesh for appeasing the majesty of heaven, but of a pure mind and a just spirit, and a breast, as he himself says, which is generous with a natural love of honour. This is the religion of heaven—not that which consists of corrupt things, but of the virtues of the soul, which has its origin from heaven; this is true worship, in which the mind of the worshipper presents itself as an undefiled offering to God. But how this is to be obtained, how it is to be afforded, the discussion of this book will show; for nothing can be so illustrious and so suited to man as to train men to righteousness. <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1088"><font size="1">1089</font></a>

 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11"></a>In <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.1"></a>Cicero, <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.2"></a>Catulus in the <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.3"></a>Hortensius, while he prefers philosophy to all things, says that he would rather have one short treatise respecting duty, than a long speech in behalf of a seditious man <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.4"></a>Cornelius. And this is plainly to be regarded not as the opinion of <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.5"></a>Catulus, who perhaps did not utter this saying, but as that of <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.6"></a>Cicero, who wrote it. I believe that he wrote it for the purpose of recommending these books which he was about to write on Offices, in which very books he testifies that nothing in the whole <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.ii-Page_164"></a>range of philosophy is better and more profitable than to give precepts for living. But if this is done by those who do not know the truth, how much more ought we to do it, who are able to give true precepts, <a name="fr_1089"></a><a href="#fn_1089"><font size="1">1090</font></a>
  being taught and enlightened by God? Nor, however, shall we so teach as though we were delivering the first elements of virtue, which would be an endless task, but as though we had undertaken the instruction of him who, with them, appears to be already perfect. For while their precepts remain, which they are accustomed to give correctly, with a view to uprightness, we will add to them things which were unknown to them, for the completion and consummation of righteousness, which they do not possess. But I will omit those things which are common to us with them, that I may not appear to borrow from those whose errors I have determined to convict and bring to light.  </p>
