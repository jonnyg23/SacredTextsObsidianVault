 <p> <a name="vi.ii.iv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p0.1"></a>from the fourth chapter.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p1"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></a>1. “After this, I beheld, and, lo, a door was opened in heaven.”] The new testament is announced as an open door in heaven.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p2"></a>“And the first voice which I heard <span><a name="vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></a>was</span>, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up hither.”] Since the door is shown to be opened, it is manifest that previously it had been closed to men. And it was sufficiently and fully laid open when Christ ascended with His body to the Father into heaven. Moreover, the first <a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 348</font></a> <a name="vi.ii.iv-Page_348"></a>voice which he had heard when he says that it spoke with him, without contradiction condemns those who say that one spoke in the prophets, another in the Gospel; since it is rather He Himself who comes, that is the same who spoke in the prophets. For <a name="vi.ii.iv-p2.2"></a>John was of the circumcision, and all that people which had heard the announcement of the Old Testament was edified with his word.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p3"></a>“That very same voice,” said he, “that I had heard, that said unto me, Come up hither.”] That is the Spirit, whom a little before he confesses that he had seen walking as the Son of man in the midst of the golden candlesticks. And he now gathers from Him what had been foretold in similitudes by the law, and associates with this scripture all the former prophets, and opens up the Scriptures. And because our Lord invited in His own name all believers into heaven, He forthwith poured out the Holy Spirit, who should bring them to heaven. He says:—  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p4"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p4.1"></a>2. “Immediately I was in the Spirit.”] And since the mind of the faithful is opened by the Holy Spirit, and that is manifested to them which was also foretold to the fathers, he distinctly says:—  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p5"></a>“And, behold, a throne was set in heaven.”] The throne set: what is it but the throne of judgment and of the King?  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p6"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p6.1"></a>3. “And He that sat upon the throne was, to look upon, like a jasper and a sardine stone.”] Upon the throne he says that he saw the likeness of a jasper and a sardine stone. The jasper is of the colour of water, the sardine of fire. These two are thence manifested to be placed as judgments upon Gods tribunal until the consummation of the world, of which judgments one is already completed in the deluge of water, and the other shall be completed by fire.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p7"></a>“And there was a rainbow about the throne.”] Moreover, the rainbow round about the throne has the same colours. The rainbow is called a bow from what the Lord spake to Noah and to his sons, <a name="fr_2263"></a><a href="#fn_2263"><font size="1">2264</font></a>
  that they should not fear any further deluge in the generation of God, but fire. For thus He says: I will place my bow in the clouds, that ye may now no longer fear water, but fire.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p9"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p9.1"></a>6. “And before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal.”] That is the gift of baptism which He sheds forth through His Son in time of repentance, before He executes judgment. It is therefore before the throne, that is, the judgment. And when he says a sea of glass like to crystal, he shows that it is pure water, smooth, not agitated by the wind, not flowing down as on a slope, but given to be immoveable as the house of God.   </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p10"></a>“And round about the throne were four living creatures.”] The four living creatures are the four Gospels.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p11"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.1"></a>7–10. “The first living creature was like to a lion, and the second was like to a calf, and the third had a face like to a man, and the fourth was like to a flying eagle; and they had six wings, and round about and within they were full of eyes; and they had no rest, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord Omnipotent. And the four and twenty elders, falling down before the throne, adored God.”] The four and twenty elders are the twenty-four books of the prophets and of the law, which give testimonies of the judgment. Moreover, also, they are the twenty-four fathers—twelve apostles and twelve patriarchs. And in that the living creatures are different in appearance, this is the reason: the living creature like to a lion designates <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.2"></a>Mark, in whom is heard the voice of the lion roaring in the desert. And in the figure of a man, <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.3"></a>Matthew strives to declare to us the genealogy of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.4"></a>Mary, from whom Christ took flesh. Therefore, in enumerating from <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.5"></a>Abraham to <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.6"></a>David, and thence to <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.7"></a>Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man: therefore his announcement sets forth the image of a man. <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.8"></a>Luke, in narrating the priesthood of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.9"></a>Zacharias as he offers a sacrifice for the people, and the angel that appears to him with respect of the priesthood, and the victim in the same description bore the likeness of a calf. <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.10"></a>John the evangelist, like to an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues about the Word of God. <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.11"></a>Mark, therefore, as an evangelist thus beginning, “The beginning of the Gospel of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.12"></a>Jesus Christ, as it is written in <a name="vi.ii.iv-p11.13"></a>Isaiah the prophet;” <a name="fr_2264"></a><a href="#fn_2264"><font size="1">2265</font></a>
  The voice of one crying in the wilderness,” <a name="fr_2265"></a><a href="#fn_2265"><font size="1">2266</font></a>
 —has the effigy of a lion. And <a name="vi.ii.iv-p13.2"></a>Matthew, “The book of the generation of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p13.3"></a>Jesus Christ, the son of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p13.4"></a>David, the son of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p13.5"></a>Abraham:” <a name="fr_2266"></a><a href="#fn_2266"><font size="1">2267</font></a>
  this is the form of a man. But <a name="vi.ii.iv-p14.2"></a>Luke said, “There was a priest, by name <a name="vi.ii.iv-p14.3"></a>Zachariah, of the course of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p14.4"></a>Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p14.5"></a>Aaron:” <a name="fr_2267"></a><a href="#fn_2267"><font size="1">2268</font></a>
  this is the likeness of a calf. But <a name="vi.ii.iv-p15.2"></a>John, when he begins, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” <a name="fr_2268"></a><a href="#fn_2268"><font size="1">2269</font></a>
  sets forth the likeness of a flying eagle. Moreover, not only do the evangelists express their four similitudes in their <span><a name="vi.ii.iv-p16.2"></a>respective</span> openings of the Gospels, but also the Word itself of God the Father Omnipotent, which is His Son our Lord <a name="vi.ii.iv-p16.3"></a>Jesus Christ, bears the same likeness in the time of His advent. When He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion and a lions whelp. And when for mans salvation He was made man to overcome death, and to set all men free, and that He offered <a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a> <a name="vi.ii.iv-Page_349"></a>Himself a victim to the Father on our behalf, He was called a calf. And that He overcame death and ascended into the heavens, extending His wings and protecting His people, He was named a flying eagle. Therefore these announcements, although they are four, yet are one, because it proceeded from one mouth. Even as the river in paradise, although it is one, was divided into four heads. Moreover, that for the announcement of the New Testament those living creatures had eyes within and without, shows the spiritual providence which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and beholds the things which are coming after that are within and without.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p17"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p17.1"></a>8. “Six wings.”] These are the testimonies of the books of the Old Testament. Thus, twenty and four make as many as there are elders sitting upon the thrones. But as an animal cannot fly unless it have wings, so, too, the announcement of the New Testament gains no faith unless it have the fore-announced testimonies of the Old Testament, by which it is lifted from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what has been told before, and is afterwards found to have happened, that begets an undoubting faith. Again, also, if wings be not attached to the living creatures, they have nothing whence they may draw their life. For unless what the prophets foretold had been consummated in Christ, their preaching was vain. For the Catholic Church holds those things which were both before predicted and afterwards accomplished. And it flies, because the living animal is reasonably lifted up from the earth. But to heretics who do not avail themselves of the prophetic testimony, to them also there are present living creatures; but they do not fly, because they are of the earth. And to the Jews who do <span><a name="vi.ii.iv-p17.2"></a>not</span> receive the announcement of the New Testament there are present wings; but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to men, not adjusting facts to their words. And the books of the Old Testament that are received are twenty-four, which you will find in the epitomes of <a name="vi.ii.iv-p17.3"></a>Theodore. But, moreover (as we have said), four and twenty elders, patriarchs and apostles, are to judge His people. For to the apostles, when they asked, saying, “We have forsaken all that we had, and followed Thee: what shall we have?” our Lord replied, “When the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” <a name="fr_2269"></a><a href="#fn_2269"><font size="1">2270</font></a>
  But of the fathers also who should judge, says the patriarch <a name="vi.ii.iv-p18.2"></a>Jacob, “<a name="vi.ii.iv-p18.3"></a>Dan also himself shall judge his people among his brethren, even as one of the tribes in Israel.” <a name="fr_2270"></a><a href="#fn_2270"><font size="1">2271</font></a>
   </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p20"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p20.1"></a>5. “And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and seven torches of fire burning.”] And the lightnings, and voices, and thunders proceeding from the throne of God, and the seven torches of fire burning, signify announcements, and promises of adoption, and threatenings. For lightnings signify the Lords advent, and the voices the announcements of the New Testament, and the thunders, that the words are from heaven. The burning torches of fire <span><a name="vi.ii.iv-p20.2"></a>signify</span> the gift of the Holy Spirit, that it is given by the wood of the passion. And when these things were doing, he says that all the elders fell down and adored the Lord; while the living creatures—that is, of course, the actions recorded in the Gospels and the teaching of the Lord—gave Him glory and honour. <a name="fr_2271"></a><a href="#fn_2271"><font size="1">2272</font></a>
  In that they had fulfilled the word that had been previously foretold by them, they worthily and with reason exult, feeling that they have ministered the mysteries and the word of the Lord. Finally, also, because He had come who should remove death, and who alone was worthy to take the crown of immortality, all for the glory of His most excellent doing had crowns.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.iv-p22"></a><a name="vi.ii.iv-p22.1"></a>10. “And they cast their crowns under His feet.”] That is, on account of the eminent glory of Christs victory, they cast all their victories under His feet. This is what in the Gospel the Holy Spirit consummated by showing, For when about finally to suffer, our Lord had come to Jerusalem, and the people had gone forth to meet Him, some strewed the road with palm branches cut down, others threw down their garments, doubtless these were setting forth two peoples—the one of the patriarchs, the other of the prophets; that is to say, of the great men who had any kind of palms of their victories against sin, and cast them under the feet of Christ, the victor of all. And the palm and the crown signify the same things, and these are not given save to the victor.  </p>
