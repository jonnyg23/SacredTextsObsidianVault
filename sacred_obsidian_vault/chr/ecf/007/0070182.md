 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XVIII.—Of the Fortunes of the World at the Last Time, and of the Things Foretold by the Soothsayers.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1"></a>That these things will thus take place, all the prophets have announced from the inspiration of God, and also the soothsayers at the instigation of the demons. For <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1.1"></a>Hystaspes, whom I have named above, having described the iniquity of this last time, says that the pious and faithful, being separated from the wicked, will stretch forth their hands to heaven with weeping and mourning, and will implore the protection of <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1.2"></a>Jupiter: that <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1.3"></a>Jupiter will look to the earth, and hear the voices of men, and will destroy the wicked. All which things are true except one, that he attributed to <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1.4"></a>Jupiter those things which God will do. But that also was withdrawn from the account, not without fraud on the part of the demons, viz., that the Son of God would then be sent, who, having destroyed all the wicked, would set at liberty the pious. Which, however, <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1.5"></a>Hermes did not conceal. For in that book which is entitled the <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1.6"></a>Complete Treatise, after an enumeration of the evils concerning which we have spoken, he added these things: “But when these things thus come to pass, then He who is Lord, and Father, and God, and the Creator of the first and one God, looking upon what is done, and opposing to the disorder His own will, that is, goodness, and recalling the wandering and cleansing wickedness, partly inundating it with much water, and partly burning it with most rapid fire, and sometimes pressing it with wars and pestilences, He brought His world to its ancient state and restored it.” The Sibyls also show that it would not be otherwise than that the Son of God should be sent by His supreme Father, to set free the righteous from the hands of the wicked, and to destroy the unrighteous, together with their cruel tyrants. One of whom thus wrote:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p1.7"></a>   “He shall come also, wishing to destroy the city of the blest; and a king sent against him from the gods shall slay all the great kings and chief men: then judgment shall thus come from the Immortal to men.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p2"></a>Also another <a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p2.1"></a>Sibyl:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p2.2"></a>   “And then God shall send a king from the sun, who shall cause all the earth to cease from disastrous war.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p3"></a>And again another:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xviii-p3.1"></a>   “He will take away the intolerable yoke of slavery which is placed on our neck, and he will do away with impious laws and violent chains.”<br>  </blockquote>
