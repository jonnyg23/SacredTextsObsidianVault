 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1"></a>Now <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.1"></a>Daia, in gratifying his libidinous desires, made his own will the standard of right; and therefore he would not refrain from soliciting the widow of <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.2"></a>Galerius, the Empress <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.3"></a>Valeria, to whom he had lately given the appellation of mother. After the death of her husband, she <a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 317</font></a> <a name="iii.v.xxxix-Page_317"></a>had repaired to <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.4"></a>Daia, because she imagined that she might live with more security in his dominions than elsewhere, especially as he was a married man; but the flagitious creature became instantly inflamed with a passion for her. <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.5"></a>Valeria was still in weeds, the time of her mourning not being yet expired. He sent a message to her proposing marriage, and offering, on her compliance, to put away his wife. She frankly returned an answer such as she alone could dare to do: first, that she would not treat of marriage while she was in weeds, and while the ashes of <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.6"></a>Galerius, <span><a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.7"></a>her</span> husband, and, by adoption, the father of <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p1.8"></a>Daia, were yet warm; next, that he acted impiously, in proposing to divorce a faithful wife to make room for another, whom in her turn he would also cast off; and, lastly, that it was indecent, unexampled, and unlawful for a woman of her title and dignity to engage a second time in wedlock. <a name="fr_1991"></a><a href="#fn_1991"><font size="1">1992</font></a>
  This bold answer having been reported to <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p2.1"></a>Daia, presently his desires changed into rage and furious resentment. He pronounced sentence of forfeiture against the princess, seized her goods, removed her attendants, tortured her eunuchs to death, and banished her and her mother <a name="iii.v.xxxix-p2.2"></a>Prisca: but he appointed no particular place for her residence while in banishment; and hence he insultingly expelled her from every abode that she took in the course of her wanderings; and, to complete all, he condemned the ladies who enjoyed most of her friendship and confidence to die on a false accusation of adultery.  </p>
