 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.lii-p1"></a>I relate all those things on the authority of well-informed persons; and I thought it proper to commit them to writing exactly as they happened, lest the memory of events so important should perish, and lest any future historian of the persecutors should corrupt the truth, either by suppressing their offences against God, or the judgment of God against them. To His everlasting mercy ought we to render thanks, that, having at length looked on the earth, He deigned to collect again and to restore His flock, partly laid waste by ravenous wolves, and partly scattered abroad, and to extirpate those noxious wild beasts who had trod down its pastures, and destroyed its resting-places. <a name="fr_1997"></a><a href="#fn_1997"><font size="1">1998</font></a>
  Where now are <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a> <a name="iii.v.lii-Page_322"></a>the surnames of the <span><a name="iii.v.lii-p2.3"></a>Jovii</span> and the <span><a name="iii.v.lii-p2.4"></a>Herculii</span>, once so glorious and renowned amongst the nations; surnames insolently assumed at first by <a name="iii.v.lii-p2.5"></a>Diocles and <a name="iii.v.lii-p2.6"></a>Maximian, and afterwards transferred to their successors? The Lord has blotted them out and erased them from the earth. Let us therefore with exultation celebrate the triumphs of God, and oftentimes with praises make mention of His victory; let us in our prayers, by night and by day, beseech Him to confirm for ever that peace which, after a warfare of ten years, He has bestowed on His own: and do you, above all others, my best beloved <a name="iii.v.lii-p2.7"></a>Donatus, who so well deserve to be heard, implore the Lord that it would please Him propitiously and mercifully to continue His pity towards His servants, to protect His people from the machinations and assaults of the devil, and to guard the now flourishing churches in perpetual felicity.  </p>
