 <p> <a name="iii.v.ii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.v.ii-p0.1"></a>Chap. II.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.ii-p1"></a>In the latter days of the Emperor <a name="iii.v.ii-p1.1"></a>Tiberius, in the consulship of <a name="iii.v.ii-p1.2"></a>Ruberius Geminus and <a name="iii.v.ii-p1.3"></a>Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of April, <a name="fr_1960"></a><a href="#fn_1960"><font size="1">1961</font></a>
  as I find it written, <a name="iii.v.ii-p2.1"></a>Jesus Christ was crucified by the Jews. <a name="fr_1961"></a><a href="#fn_1961"><font size="1">1962</font></a>
  After He had risen again on the third day, He gathered together His apostles, whom fear, at the time of His being laid hold on, had put to flight; and while He sojourned with them forty days, He opened their hearts, interpreted to them the Scripture, which hitherto had been wrapped up in obscurity, ordained and fitted them for the preaching of His word and doctrine, and regulated all things concerning the institutions of the New Testament; and this having been accomplished, a cloud and whirlwind enveloped Him, and caught Him up from the sight of men unto heaven.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.ii-p4"></a>His apostles were at that time eleven in number, to whom were added <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.1"></a>Matthias, in the room of the traitor <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.2"></a>Judas, and afterwards <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.3"></a>Paul. Then were they dispersed throughout all the earth to preach the Gospel, as the Lord their Master had commanded them; and during twenty-five years, and until the beginning of the reign of the Emperor <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.4"></a>Nero, they occupied themselves in laying the foundations of the Church in every province and city. And while <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.5"></a>Nero reigned, the Apostle <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.6"></a>Peter came to Rome, and, through the power of God committed unto him, wrought certain miracles, and, by turning many to the true religion, built up a faithful and stedfast temple <a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a> <a name="iii.v.ii-Page_302"></a>unto the Lord. When <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.7"></a>Nero heard of those things, and observed that not only in Rome, but in every other place, a great multitude revolted daily from the worship of idols, and, condemning their old ways, went over to the new religion, he, an execrable and pernicious tyrant, sprung forward to raze the heavenly temple and destroy the true faith. He it was who first persecuted the servants of God; he crucified <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.8"></a>Peter, and slew <a name="iii.v.ii-p4.9"></a>Paul: <a name="fr_1962"></a><a href="#fn_1962"><font size="1">1963</font></a>
  nor did he escape with impunity; for God looked on the affliction of His people; and therefore the tyrant, bereaved of authority, and precipitated from the height of empire, suddenly disappeared, and even the burial-place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that, having been conveyed to a distant region, he is still reserved alive; and to him they apply the Sibylline verses concerning  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.v.ii-p5.5"></a>   “The fugitive, who slew his own mother, being to come from the uttermost boundaries of the earth;”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.v.ii-p6"></a>as if he who was the first should also be the last persecutor, and thus prove the forerunner of Antichrist! But we ought not to believe those who, affirming that the two prophets <a name="iii.v.ii-p6.1"></a>Enoch and <a name="iii.v.ii-p6.2"></a>Elias have been translated into some remote place that they might attend our Lord when He shall come to judgment, <a name="fr_1963"></a><a href="#fn_1963"><font size="1">1964</font></a>
  also fancy that <a name="iii.v.ii-p7.3"></a>Nero is to appear hereafter as the forerunner of the devil, when he shall come to lay waste the earth and overthrow mankind.  </p>
