 <p> <a name="iii.ii.iii.ix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.iii.ix-p0.1"></a>Chap. IX.—Of the Chief Good, and the Worship of the True God, and a Refutation of Anaxagoras.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1"></a>I now come to the chief good of true wisdom, the nature of which is to be determined in this manner: first, it must be the property of man alone, and not belong to any other animal; secondly, it must belong to the soul only, and <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.iii.ix-Page_77"></a>not be shared with the body; lastly, it cannot fall to the lot of any one without knowledge and virtue. Now this limitation excludes and does away with all the opinions of those <span><a name="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1.1"></a>whom I have mentioned</span><span><a name="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1.2"></a>;</span> for their sayings contain nothing of this kind. I will now say what this is, that I may show, as I designed, that all philosophers were blind and foolish, who could neither see, nor understand, nor surmise at any time what was fixed as the chief good for man. <a name="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1.3"></a>Anaxagoras, when asked for what purpose he was born, replied that he might look upon the heaven and the sun. This expression is admired by all, and judged worthy of a philosopher. But I think that he, being unprepared with an answer, uttered this at random, that he might <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">394</font></a>
  not be silent. But if he had been wise, he ought to have considered and reflected with himself; for if any one is ignorant of his own condition, he cannot even he a man. But let us imagine that the saying was not uttered on the spur of the moment. Let us see how many and what great errors he committed in three words. First, he erred in placing the whole duty of man in the eyes alone, referring nothing to the mind, but everything to the body. But if he had been blind, would he lose the duty of a man, which cannot happen without the ruin <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">395</font></a>
  of the soul? What of the other parts of the body? Will they be destitute, each of its own duty? Why should I say that more depends upon the ears than upon the eye, since learning and wisdom can be gained by the ears only, but not by the eyes only? Were you born for the sake of seeing the heaven and the sun? Who introduced you to this <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">396</font></a>
  sight? or what does your vision contribute to the heaven and the nature of things? Doubtless that you may praise this immense and wonderful work. Therefore confess that God is the Creator of all things, who introduced you into this world, as a witness and praiser of His great work. You believe that it is a great thing to behold the heaven and the sun: why, therefore, do you not give thanks to Him who is the author of this benefit? why do you not measure with your mind the excellence, the providence, and the power of Him whose works you admire? For it must be, that He who created objects worthy of admiration, is Himself much more to be admired. If any one had invited you to dinner, and you had been well entertained, should you appear in your senses, if you esteemed the mere pleasure more highly than the author of the pleasure? So entirely do philosophers refer all things to the body, and nothing at all to the mind, nor do they see beyond that which fails under their eyes. <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">397</font></a>
 But all the offices of the body being put aside, the business of man is to be placed in the mind alone. Therefore we are not born for this purpose, that we may see those things which are created, but that we may contemplate, that is, behold with our mind, the Creator of all things Himself. Wherefore, if any one should ask a man who is truly wise for what purpose he was born, he will answer without fear or hesitation, that he was born for the purpose of worshipping God, who brought us into being for his cause, that we may serve Him. But to serve God is nothing else than to maintain and preserve justice by good works. But he, as a man ignorant of divine things, reduced a matter of the greatest magnitude to the least, by selecting two things only, which he said were to be beheld by him. But if he had said that he was born to behold the world, although he would comprise all things in this, and would use an expression of greater <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">398</font></a>
  sound, yet he would not have completed the duty of man; for as much as the soul excels the body, so much does God excel the world, for God made and governs the world. Therefore it is not the world which is to be contemplated by the eye, for each is a body; <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">399</font></a>
  but it is God who is to be contemplated by the soul: for God, being Himself immortal, willed that the soul also should be everlasting. But the contemplation of God is the reverence and worship of the common Parent of mankind. And if the philosophers were destitute of this, and in their ignorance of divine things prostrated themselves to the earth, we must suppose that <a name="iii.ii.iii.ix-p6.1"></a>Anaxagoras neither beheld the heaven nor the sun, though he said that he was born that he might behold them. The object proposed to man is therefore plain <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">400</font></a>
  and easy, if he is wise; and to it especially belongs humanity. <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">401</font></a>
  For what is humanity itself, but justice? what is justice, but piety? And piety <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">402</font></a>
  is nothing else than the recognition of God as a parent.  </p>
