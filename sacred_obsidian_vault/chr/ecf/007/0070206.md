 <p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIII.—The Actions of Jupiter are Related from the Historian Euhemerus.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1"></a>But let us leave the poets; let us come to history, which is supported both by the credibility of the facts and by the antiquity of the times. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.1"></a>Euhemerus was a Messenian, a very ancient writer, who gave an account of the origin of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.2"></a>Jupiter, and his exploits, and all his posterity, gathered from the sacred inscriptions of ancient temples; he also traced out the parents of the other gods, their countries, actions, commands, and deaths, and even their sepulchres. And this history <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.3"></a>Ennius translated into Latin, whose words are these:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.4"></a>   “As these things are written, so is the origin and kindred of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.6"></a>Jupiter and his brothers; after this manner it is handed clown to us in the sacred writing.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2"></a>The same <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.1"></a>Euhemerus therefore relates that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.2"></a>Jupiter, when he had five times gone round the world, and had distributed governments to his friends and relatives, and had given laws to men, and had wrought many other benefits, being endued with immortal glory and everlasting remembrance, ended his life in Crete, and departed to the gods, and that his sepulchre is in Crete, in the town of Gnossus, and that upon it is engraved in ancient Greek letters Zankronou, which is <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.3"></a>Jupiter the son of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.4"></a>Saturnus. It is plain, therefore, from the things which I have related, that he was a man, and reigned on the earth.  </p>
