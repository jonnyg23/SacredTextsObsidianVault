 <p> <a name="iii.v.xvii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XVII.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p1"></a>The wicked plan having been carried into execution, <a name="iii.v.xvii-p1.1"></a>Diocletian, whom prosperity had now abandoned, set out instantly for Rome, <span><a name="iii.v.xvii-p1.2"></a>there</span> to celebrate the commencement of the twentieth year of his reign. That solemnity was performed on the twelfth of the kalends of December; <a name="fr_1976"></a><a href="#fn_1976"><font size="1">1977</font></a>
  and suddenly the emperor, unable to bear the Roman freedom of speech, peevishly and impatiently burst away from the city. The kalends of January <a name="fr_1977"></a><a href="#fn_1977"><font size="1">1978</font></a>
  approached, at which day the consulship, for the ninth time, was to be offered to him; yet, rather than continue thirteen days longer in Rome, he chose that his first appearance as consul should be at Ravenna. Having, however, begun his journey in winter, amidst intense cold and incessant rains, he contracted a slight but lingering disease: it harassed him without intermission, so that he was obliged for the most part to be carried in a litter. Then, at the close of summer, he made a circuit along the banks of the Danube, and so came to Nicomedia. His disease had now become more grievous and oppressing; yet he caused himself to be brought out, in order to dedicate that circus which, at the conclusion of the twentieth year of his reign, he had erected. Immediately he grew so languid and feeble, that prayers for his life were put up to all the gods. Then suddenly, on the ides of December, <a name="fr_1978"></a><a href="#fn_1978"><font size="1">1979</font></a>
  there was heard in the palace sorrow, and weeping, and lamentation, and the courtiers ran to and fro; there was silence throughout the city, and a report went of the death, and even of the burial, of <a name="iii.v.xvii-p4.1"></a>Diocletian: but early on the morrow it was suddenly rumoured that he still lived. At this the countenance of his domestics and courtiers changed from melancholy to gay. Nevertheless there were who suspected his death to be kept secret until the arrival of <a name="iii.v.xvii-p4.2"></a>Galerius Cæsar, lest in the meanwhile the soldiery should attempt some change in the government; and this suspicion grew so universal, that no one would believe the emperor alive, until, on the kalends of March, <a name="fr_1979"></a><a href="#fn_1979"><font size="1">1980</font></a>
  he appeared in public, but so wan, his illness having lasted almost a year, as hardly to be known again. The fit of stupor, resembling death, happened on the ides of December; and although he in some measure recovered, yet he never attained to perfect health again, for he became disordered in his judgment, being at certain times insane and at others of sound mind.  </p>
