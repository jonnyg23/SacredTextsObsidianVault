 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xiv-p1"></a><a name="vi.ii.xiv-p1.1"></a>6. “And I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven.”] The angel flying through the midst of heaven, whom he says that he saw, we have already treated of above, as being the same <a name="vi.ii.xiv-p1.2"></a>Elias who anticipates the kingdom of Antichrist in his prophecy.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xiv-p2"></a><a name="vi.ii.xiv-p2.1"></a>8. “And another angel following him.”] The other angel following, he speaks of as the same prophet who is the associate of his prophesying. But that he says,—  </p>
