 <p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p0.1"></a>Chap. VIII.—Of Æsculapius, Apollo, Mars, Castor and Pollux, and of Mercurius and Bacchus.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1"></a><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.1"></a>Tarquitius relates that <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.2"></a>Æsculapius was born of doubtful parents, and that on this account he was exposed; and being taken up by hunters, and fed by the teats of a hound, was given to <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.3"></a>Chiron for instruction. He lived at Epidaurus, and was buried at Cynosuræ, as <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.4"></a>Cicero says, <a name="fr_1460"></a><a href="#fn_1460"><font size="1">1461</font></a>
  when he had been killed by lightning. But <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p2.3"></a>Apollo, his father, did not disdain to take charge of anothers flock that he might receive a wife; <a name="fr_1461"></a><a href="#fn_1461"><font size="1">1462</font></a>
  and when he had unintentionally killed a boy whom he loved, he inscribed his own lamentations on a flower. <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p3.6"></a>Mars, a man of the greatest bravery, was not free from the charge of adultery, since he was made a spectacle, being bound with a chain together with the adulteress.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4"></a><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.1"></a>Castor and <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.2"></a>Pollux carried off the brides of others, but not with impunity, to whose death and burial <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.3"></a>Homer bears witness, not with poetical, but simple faith. <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.4"></a>Mercurius, who was the father of <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.5"></a>Androgynus by his intrigue with <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.6"></a>Venus, deserved to be a god, because he invented the lyre and the <span><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.7"></a>palæstra.</span> Father <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.8"></a>Bacchus, after subduing India as a conqueror, having by chance come to Crete, saw <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.9"></a>Ariadne on the shore, whom <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.10"></a>Theseus had forced and deserted. Then, being inflamed by love, he united her in marriage to <a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-Page_227"></a>himself, and placed her crown, as the poets say, conspicuously among the stars. The mother of the gods <a name="fr_1462"></a><a href="#fn_1462"><font size="1">1463</font></a>
  herself, while she lived in Phrygia after the banishment and death of her husband, though a widow, and aged, was enamoured of a beautiful youth; and because he was not faithful, she mutilated, and rendered him effeminate: on which account even now she delights in the <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p5.3"></a>Galli <a name="fr_1463"></a><a href="#fn_1463"><font size="1">1464</font></a>
  as her priests.  </p>
