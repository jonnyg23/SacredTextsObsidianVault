 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xiii-p1"></a>Next day an edict was published, depriving the Christians of all honours and dignities; <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a> <a name="iii.v.xiii-Page_306"></a>ordaining also that, without any distinction of rank or degree, they should be subjected to tortures, and that every suit at law should be received against them; while, on the other hand, they were debarred from being plaintiffs in questions of wrong, adultery, or theft; and, finally, that they should neither be capable of freedom, nor have right of suffrage. A certain person tore down this edict, and cut it in pieces, improperly indeed, but with high spirit, saying in scorn, “These are the triumphs of Goths and Sarmatians.” Having been instantly seized and brought to judgment, he was not only tortured, but burnt alive, in the forms of law; and having displayed admirable patience under sufferings, he was consumed to ashes.  </p>
