 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xx-p1"></a><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.1"></a>Galerius having effected the expulsion of the two old men, began to consider himself alone as the sovereign of the Roman empire. Necessity had required the appointment of <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.2"></a>Constantius to the first rank; but <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.3"></a>Galerius made small account of one who was of an easy temper, and of health declining and precarious. He looked for the speedy death of <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.4"></a>Constantius. And although that prince should recover, it seemed not difficult to force him to put off the imperial purple; for what else could he do, if pressed by his three colleagues to abdicate? <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.5"></a>Galerius had <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.6"></a>Licinius ever about his person, his old and intimate acquaintance, and his earliest companion in arms, whose counsels he used in the management of all affairs; yet he would not nominate Licinius to the dignity of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.7"></a>Cæsar</span>, with the title of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.8"></a>son</span>, for he purposed to nominate him, in the room of <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.9"></a>Constantius, to the dignity of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.10"></a>emperor</span>, with the title of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.11"></a>brother</span>, while he himself might hold sovereign authority, and rule over the whole globe with unbounded licence. After that, he meant to have solemnized the <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.12"></a>vicennial</span> festival; to have conferred on his son <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.13"></a>Candidianus, then a boy of nine years of age, the office of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.14"></a>Cæsar</span>; and, in conclusion, to have resigned, as <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.15"></a>Diocletian had done. And thus, <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.16"></a>Licinius and <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.17"></a>Severus being emperors, and <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.18"></a>Maximin and <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.19"></a>Candidianus in the next station of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.20"></a>Cæsars</span>, he fancied that, environed as it were by an impregnable wall, he should lead an old age of security and peace. Such were his projects; but God, whom he had made his adversary, frustrated all those imaginations.  </p>
