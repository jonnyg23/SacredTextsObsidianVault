 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xv-p1"></a>And now <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.1"></a>Diocletian raged, not only against his own domestics, but indiscriminately against all; and he began by forcing his daughter <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.2"></a>Valeria and his wife <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.3"></a>Prisca to be polluted by sacrificing. <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.4"></a>Eunuchs, once the most powerful, and who had chief authority at court and with the emperor, were slain. Presbyters and other officers of the Church were seized, without evidence by witnesses or confession, condemned, and together with their families led to execution. In burning alive, no distinction of sex or age was regarded; and because of their great multitude, they were not burnt one after another, but a herd of them were encircled with the same fire; and servants, having millstones tied about their necks, were cast into the sea. Nor was the persecution less grievous on the rest of the people of God; for the judges, dispersed through all the temples, sought to compel every one to sacrifice. The prisons were crowded; tortures, hitherto unheard of, were invented; and lest justice should be inadvertently administered to a Christian, altars were placed in the courts of justice, hard by the tribunal, that every litigant might offer incense before his cause could be heard. Thus judges were no otherwise approached than divinities. <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.5"></a>Mandates also had gone to <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.6"></a>Maximian Herculius and <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.7"></a>Constantius, requiring their concurrence in the execution of the edicts; for in matters even of such mighty importance their opinion was never once asked. <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.8"></a>Herculius, a person of no merciful temper, yielded ready obedience, and enforced the edicts throughout his dominions of Italy. <a name="iii.v.xv-p1.9"></a>Constantius, on the other hand, lest he should have seemed to dissent from the injunctions of his superiors, permitted the demolition of churches,—mere walls, and capable of being built up again,—but he preserved entire that true temple of God, which is the human body. <a name="fr_1974"></a><a href="#fn_1974"><font size="1">1975</font></a>
