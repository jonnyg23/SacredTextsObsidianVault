 <p> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p0.1"></a>Chap. XXV.—Of Learning Philosophy, and What Great Qualifications are Necessary for Its Pursuit.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p1"></a>We must now speak a few things concerning philosophy in general, that having strengthened our cause we may conclude. That greatest imitator of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p1.1"></a>Plato among our writers thought that philosophy was not for the multitude, because none but learned men could attain to it. “Philosophy,” says <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p1.2"></a>Cicero, <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">471</font></a>
  “is contented with a few judges, of its own accord designedly avoiding the multitude.” It is not therefore wisdom, if it avoids the concourse of men; since, if wisdom is given to man, it is given to all without any distinction, so that there is no one at all who cannot acquire it. But they so embrace virtue, which is given to the human race, that they alone of all appear to wish to enjoy that which is a public good; being as envious as if they should wish to bind or tear out the eyes of others that they may not see the sun. For what else is it to deny wisdom to men, than to take away from their minds the true and divine light? But if the nature of man is capable of wisdom, it was befitting that both workmen, and country people, and women, and all, in short, who bear the human form, should be taught to be wise; and that the people should be brought together from every language, and condition, and sex, and age. Therefore it is a very strong argument that philosophy neither tends to wisdom, nor is of itself wisdom, that its mystery is only made known by the beard and cloak of the philosophers. <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">472</font></a>
  The Stoics, moreover, perceived this, who said that philosophy was to be studied both by slaves and women; <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p3.2"></a>Epicurus also, who invites those who are altogether unacquainted with letters to philosophy; and <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p3.3"></a>Plato also, who wished to compose a state of wise men.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p4"></a>They attempted, indeed, to do that which truth required; but they were unable to proceed beyond words. First, because instruction in many arts is necessary for an application to philosophy. Common learning must be acquired on account of practice in reading, because in so great a variety of subjects it is impossible that all things should be learned by hearing, or retained in the memory. No little attention also must be given to the grammarians, in order that you may know the right method of speaking. That must occupy many years. Nor must there be ignorance of rhetoric, that you may be able to utter and express the things which you have learned. Geometry also, and music, and astronomy, are necessary, because these arts have some connection with philosophy; and the whole of these subjects cannot be learned by women, who must learn within the years of their maturity the duties which are hereafter about to be of service to them for domestic uses; nor by servants, who must live in service during those years especially in which they are able to learn; nor by the poor, or labourers, or rustics, who have to gain their daily support by labour. And on this account <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p4.1"></a>Tully says that philosophy is averse from the multitude. But yet <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p4.2"></a>Epicurus will receive the ignorant. <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">473</font></a>
  How, then, will they understand those things which are said respecting the first principles of things, the perplexities and intricacies of which are scarcely attained to by men of cultivated minds?  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p6"></a>Therefore, in subjects which are involved in obscurity, and confused by a variety of intellects, and set off by the studied language of eloquent men, what place is there for the unskilful and ignorant? Lastly, they never taught any women to study philosophy, except <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p6.1"></a>Themiste <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">474</font></a>
  only, within the whole memory of man; nor slaves, except <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p7.6"></a>Phædo <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">475</font></a>
  only, who is said, when living in oppressive slavery, to have been ransomed and taught by <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.7"></a>Cebes. They also enumerate <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.8"></a>Plato and <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.9"></a>Diogenes: these, however, were not slaves, though they had fallen into servitude, for they <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-Page_96"></a>had been taken captive. A certain <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.10"></a>Aniceris is said to have ransomed <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.11"></a>Plato for eight sesterces. And on this account <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.12"></a>Seneca severely rebuked the ransomer himself, because he set so small value upon <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.13"></a>Plato. He was a madman, as it seems to me, who was angry with a man because he did not throw away much money; doubtless he ought to have weighed gold as though to ransom the corpse of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.14"></a>Hector, or to have insisted upon the payment of more money than the seller demanded. Moreover, they taught none of the barbarians, with the single exception of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xxv-p8.15"></a>Anacharsis the Scythian, who never would have dreamed of philosophy had he not previously learned both language and literature.  </p>
