 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.XC-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XC-p1.1"></a>Letter XC. From Theophilus to Epiphanius.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XC-p2"></a>Theophilus writes to Epiphanius to convoke a council in Cyprus for the condemnation of Origenism and asks him to transmit to Constantinople by a trustworthy messenger a copy of its decrees together with the synodical letter of Theophilus himself. His anxiety about this last point is caused by the news that certain of the excommunicated monks have set sail for Constantinople to lay their case before the bishop, John Chrysostom. The date of the letter is 400 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XC-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XC-p3"></a>Theophilus to his well-beloved lord, brother, and fellow-bishop Epiphanius.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XC-p4"></a>The Lord has said to his prophet “See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and…to build and to plant.” <a name="fr_2626"></a><a href="#fn_2626"><font size="1">2627</font></a>
  In every age he bestows the same grace upon his church, that His Body <a name="fr_2627"></a><a href="#fn_2627"><font size="1">2628</font></a>
  may be preserved intact and that the poison of heretical opinions may nowhere prevail over it. And now also do we see the words fulfilled. For the church of Christ “not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing” <a name="fr_2628"></a><a href="#fn_2628"><font size="1">2629</font></a>
  has with the sword of the gospel cut down the Origenist serpents crawling out of their caves, and has delivered from their deadly contagion the fruitful host of the monks of Nitria. I have compressed a short account of my proceedings (it was all that time would allow) into the general letter <a name="fr_2629"></a><a href="#fn_2629"><font size="1">2630</font></a>
  which I have addressed indiscriminately to all. As your excellency has often fought in contests of the kind before me, it is your present duty to strengthen the hands of those who are in the field and to gather together to this end the bishops of your entire island. <a name="fr_2630"></a><a href="#fn_2630"><font size="1">2631</font></a>
  A synodical letter should be sent to myself and the bishop of Constantinople <a name="fr_2631"></a><a href="#fn_2631"><font size="1">2632</font></a>
  and to any others whom you think fit; that by universal consent Origen himself may be expressly condemned and also the infamous heresy of which he was the author. I have learned that certain calumniators of the true faith, named Ammonius, Eusebius, and Euthymius, filled with a fresh access of enthusiasm in behalf of the heresy, have taken ship for Constantinople, to ensnare with their deceits as many new converts as they can and to confer anew with the old companions of their impiety. Let it be your care, therefore, to set forth the course of the matter to all the bishops throughout Isauria and Pamphylia and the rest of the neighbouring provinces: moreover, if you think fit, you can add my letter, so that all of us gathered together in one spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ may deliver these men unto Satan for the destruction of the impiety which possesses them. <a name="fr_2632"></a><a href="#fn_2632"><font size="1">2633</font></a>
  And to ensure the speedy arrival of my despatches at Constantinople, send a diligent messenger, one of the clergy (as I send fathers from the monasteries of Nitria with others also of the monks, learned men and continent) that when they arrive they may be able themselves to relate what has been done. Above all I beg of you to offer up earnest prayers to the Lord that we may be able in this contest also to gain the victory; for no small joy has filled the hearts of the people both in Alexandria and throughout all Egypt, because a few men have been expelled from the Church that the body of it might be kept pure. Salute the brothers who are with you. The people <a name="fr_2633"></a><a href="#fn_2633"><font size="1">2634</font></a>
  with us salute you in the Lord.</p>
