 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iii.iii-p2"></a><i>The Preface to these books was written <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iii.iii-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 404; Jerome speaks of the death of Paula, which took place in that year, and the work is addressed to Eustochium alone. The Preface is chiefly occupied with a defence of his translation. He tells those who carp at it that they are not bound to read it, and mentions that the Church had given no final sanction to the LXX., but read the book of Daniel in Theodotions version. The books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, were probably the last of the Vulgate translation; the Preface declares Jeromes intention of devoting himself henceforward to the Commentaries on the Prophets, a work which took up the remainder of his life.</i></p>
