 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.XCI-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XCI-p1.1"></a>Letter XCI. From Epiphanius to Jerome.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XCI-p2"></a>An exultant letter from Epiphanius in which he describes the success of his council (convened at the suggestion of Theophilus), sends Jerome a copy of its synodical letter. and urges him to go on with his work of translating into Latin documents bearing on the Origenistic controversy. Written in 400 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XCI-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XCI-p3"></a>To his most loving lord, son, and brother, <a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a> <a name="v.XCI-Page_185"></a>the presbyter Jerome, Epiphanius sends greeting in the Lord. The general epistle written <a name="fr_2634"></a><a href="#fn_2634"><font size="1">2635</font></a>
  to all Catholics belongs particularly to you; for you, having a zeal for the faith against all heresies, particularly oppose the disciples of Origen and of Apollinaris whose poisoned roots and deeply planted impiety almighty God has dragged forth into our midst, that having been unearthed at Alexandria they might wither throughout the world. For know, my beloved son, that Amalek has been destroyed root and branch and that the trophy of the cross has been set up on the hill of Rephidim. <a name="fr_2635"></a><a href="#fn_2635"><font size="1">2636</font></a>
  For as when the hands of Moses were held up on high Israel prevailed, so the Lord has strengthened His servant Theophilus to plant His standard against Origen on the altar of the church of Alexandria; that in him might be fulfilled the words: “Write this for a memorial, for I will utterly put out Origens heresy from under heaven together with that Amalek himself.” And that I may not appear to be repeating the same things over and over and thus to be making my letter tedious, I send you the actual missive written to me that you may know what Theophilus has said to me, and what a great blessing the Lord has granted to my last days in approving the principles which I have always proclaimed by the testimony of so great a prelate. I fancy that by this time you also have published something and that, as I suggested in my former letter to you on this subject, you have elaborated a treatise for readers of your own language. For I hear that certain of those who have made shipwreck <a name="fr_2636"></a><a href="#fn_2636"><font size="1">2637</font></a>
  have come also to the West, and that, not content with their own destruction, they desire to involve others in death with them; as if they thought that the multitude of sinners lessens the guilt of sin and the flames of Gehenna do not grow in size in proportion as more logs are heaped upon them. With you and by you we send our best greetings to the reverend brothers who are with you in the monastery serving God.</p>
