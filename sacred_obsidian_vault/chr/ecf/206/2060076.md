 <p class="c16"><a name="v.LXV-p2"></a>A commentary on Ps. XLV. addressed to Marcellas friend and companion Principia (see Letter CXXVII.). Jerome prefaces what he has to say by a defence of his practice of writing for women, a practice which had exposed him to many foolish sneers. He deals with the same subject in his dedication of the Commentary of Sophronius. The date of the letter is 397 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXV-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>
