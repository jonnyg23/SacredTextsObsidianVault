 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.CXXXVIII-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.CXXXVIII-p1.1"></a>Letter CXXXVIII. To Riparius.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXXVIII-p2"></a>Jerome praises Riparius for his zeal on behalf of the Catholic faith and for his efforts to put down the Pelagians. He then describes the attack made by these heretics upon the monasteries of Bethlehem. Now, he is glad to say, they have at last been driven from Palestine. Most of them, that is, for some still linger at Joppa including one of their chief leaders. The date is <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXXXVIII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 417.</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXXVIII-p3"></a>That you fight Christs battles against the enemies of the Catholic Faith your own letters have informed me as well as the reports of many persons, but I am told that you find the winds contrary and that those who ought to have been the worlds champions have backed the cause of perdition to each others ruin. You are to know that in this part of the world, without any human help and merely by the decree of Christ, Catiline <a name="fr_3889"></a><a href="#fn_3889"><font size="1">3890</font></a>
  has been driven not only from the capital but from the borders of Palestine. Lentulus, however, and many of his fellow-conspirators still linger to our sorrow in Joppa. I myself have thought it better to change my abode than to surrender the true faith; and have chosen to leave my pleasant home rather than to suffer contamination from heresy. For I could not communicate with men who would either have insisted on my instant submission or would else have summoned me to support my opinions by the sword. A good many, I dare say, have told you the story of my sufferings and of the vengeance which Christs uplifted hand has on my behalf taken upon my enemies. I would beg of you, therefore, to complete the task which you have taken up and not, while you are in it, <a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 282</font></a> <a name="v.CXXXVIII-Page_282"></a>to leave Christs church without a defender. Every one knows the weapons that must be used in this warfare; and you, I feel sure will ask for no others. You must contend with all your might against the foe; but it must be not with physical force but with that spiritual charity which is never overcome. The reverend brothers who are with me, unworthy as I am, salute you warmly. The reverend brother, the deacon Alentius, is sure to give you, my worshipful friend, a faithful narrative of all the facts. May Christ our Lord, of His almighty power, keep you safe and mindful of me, truly reverend sir and esteemed brother.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.CXXXVIII-p4"></a> Pelagius would naturally be understood by Catiline, and Celestius by Lentulus, who was Catilines lieutenant. But it is known that, after the Synod of Diospolis which acquitted them, Celestius went to Africa, Ephesus, Constantinople, and Rome, while Pelagius apparently remained in Palestine, where he died.</p>
