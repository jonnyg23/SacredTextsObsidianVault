 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p1.1"></a>Letter LXXXIV. To Pammachius and Oceanus.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p2"></a>A calm letter in which Jerome defines and justifies his own attitude towards Origen, but unduly minimizes his early enthusiasm for him. He admires him in the same way that Cyprian admired Tertullian but does not in any way adopt his errors. He then describes his own studies and recounts his obligations to Apollinaris, Didymus, and a Jew named Bar-anina. The rest of the letter deals with the errors of Origen, the state of the text of his writings, and the eulogy of him composed by the martyr Pamphilus (the authenticity of which Jerome assails without any sufficient reason). The date of the letter is 400 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p3"></a>Jerome to the brothers Pammachius and Oceanus, with all good wishes.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p4"></a>1. The sheets that you send me <a name="fr_2547"></a><a href="#fn_2547"><font size="1">2548</font></a>
  cover me at once with compliments and confusion; for, while they praise my ability, they take away my sincerity in the faith. But as both at Alexandria and at Rome and, I may say, throughout the whole world good men have made it a habit to take the same liberties with my name, esteeming me only so far that they cannot bear to be heretics without having me of the number, I will leave aside personalities and only answer specific charges. For it is of no benefit to a cause to <a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXIV-Page_176"></a>encounter railing with railing and to retaliate for attacks upon oneself by attacks upon ones opponents. We are commanded not to return evil for evil <a name="fr_2548"></a><a href="#fn_2548"><font size="1">2549</font></a>
  but to overcome evil with good, <a name="fr_2549"></a><a href="#fn_2549"><font size="1">2550</font></a>
  to take our fill of insults, and to turn the other cheek to the smiter. <a name="fr_2550"></a><a href="#fn_2550"><font size="1">2551</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p9"></a>2. It is charged against me that I have sometimes praised Origen. If I am not mistaken I have only done so in two places, in the short preface (addressed to Damasus) to his homilies on the Song of Songs and in the prologue to my book of Hebrew Names. In these passages do the dogmas of the church come into question? Is anything said of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost? or of the resurrection of the flesh? or of the condition and material of the soul? I have merely praised the simplicity of his rendering and commentary and neither the faith nor the dogmas of the Church come in at all. Ethics only are dealt with and the mist of allegory is dispelled by a clear explanation. I have praised the commentator but not the theologian, the man of intellect but not the believer, the philosopher but not the apostle. But if men wish to know my real judgement upon Origen; let them read my commentaries upon Ecclesiastes, let them go through my three books upon the epistle to the Ephesians: they will then see that I have always opposed his doctrines. How foolish it would be to eulogize a system so far as to endorse its blasphemy! The blessed Cyprian takes Tertullian for his master, as his writings prove; yet, delighted as he is with the ability of this learned and zealous writer he does not join him in following Montanus and Maximilla. <a name="fr_2551"></a><a href="#fn_2551"><font size="1">2552</font></a>
  Apollinaris is the author of a most weighty book against Porphyry, and Eusebius has composed a fine history of the Church; yet of these the former has mutilated Christs incarnate humanity, <a name="fr_2552"></a><a href="#fn_2552"><font size="1">2553</font></a>
  while the latter is the most open champion of the Arian impiety. <a name="fr_2553"></a><a href="#fn_2553"><font size="1">2554</font></a>
  “Woe,” says Isaiah, “unto them that call evil good and good evil; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.” <a name="fr_2554"></a><a href="#fn_2554"><font size="1">2555</font></a>
  We must not detract from the virtues of our opponents—if they have any praiseworthy qualities—but neither must we praise the defects of our friends. Each several case must be judged on its own merits and not by a reference to the persons concerned. While Lucilius is rightly assailed by Horace <a name="fr_2555"></a><a href="#fn_2555"><font size="1">2556</font></a>
  for the unevenness of his verses, he is equally rightly praised for his wit and his charming style.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p15"></a>3. In my younger days I was carried away with a great passion for learning, yet I was not like some presumptuous enough to teach myself. At Antioch I frequently listened to Apollinaris of Laodicea, and attended his lectures; yet, although he instructed me in the holy scriptures, I never embraced his disputable doctrine as to their meaning. At length my head became sprinkled with gray hairs so that I looked more like a master than a disciple. Yet I went on to Alexandria and heard Didymus. <a name="fr_2556"></a><a href="#fn_2556"><font size="1">2557</font></a>
  And I have much to thank him for: for what I did not know I learned from him, and what I knew already I did not forget. So excellent was his teaching. Men fancied that I had now made an end of learning. Yet once more I came to Jerusalem and to Bethlehem. What trouble and expense it cost me to get Baraninas <a name="fr_2557"></a><a href="#fn_2557"><font size="1">2558</font></a>
  to teach me under cover of night. For by his fear of the Jews he presented to me in his own person a second edition of Nicodemus. <a name="fr_2558"></a><a href="#fn_2558"><font size="1">2559</font></a>
  Of all of these I have frequently made mention in my works. The doctrines of Apollinaris and of Didymus are mutually contradictory. The squadrons of the two leaders must drag me in different directions, for I acknowledge both as my masters. If it is expedient to hate any men and to loath any race, I have a strange dislike to those of the circumcision. For up to the present day they persecute our Lord Jesus Christ in the synagogues of Satan. <a name="fr_2559"></a><a href="#fn_2559"><font size="1">2560</font></a>
  Yet can anyone find fault with me for having had a Jew as a teacher? Does a certain person dare to bring forward against me the letter I wrote to Didymus calling him my master? It is a great crime, it would seem, for me a disciple to give to one both old and learned the name of master. And yet when I ask leave to look at the letter which has been held over so long to discredit me at last, there is nothing in it but courteous language and a few words of greeting. Such charges are both foolish and frivolous. It would be more to the point to exhibit a passage in which I have defended heresy or praised some wicked doctrine of Origen. In the portion of Isaiah which describes the crying of the two seraphim <a name="fr_2560"></a><a href="#fn_2560"><font size="1">2561</font></a>
  he explains these to be the Son and the Holy Ghost; but have not I altered this hateful explanation into a reference to the two testaments? <a name="fr_2561"></a><a href="#fn_2561"><font size="1">2562</font></a>
  <a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXIV-Page_177"></a>I have the book in my hand as it was published twenty years ago. In numbers of my works and especially in my commentaries I have, as occasion has offered, mangled this heathen school. And if my opponents allege that I have done more than anyone else to form a collection of Origens books, I answer that I only wish I could have the works of all theological writers that by diligent study of them, I might make up for the slowness of my own wits. I have made a collection of his books, I admit; but because I know everything that he has written I do not follow his errors. I speak as a Christian to Christians: believe one who has tried him. His doctrines are poisonous, they are unknown to the Holy Scriptures, nay more, they do them violence. I have read Origen, I repeat, I have read him; and if it is a crime to read him, I admit my guilt: indeed, these Alexandrian writings have emptied my purse. If you will believe me, I have never been an Origenist: if you will not believe me, I have now ceased to be one. But if even this fails to convince you, you will compel me in self-defence to write against your favourite, so that, if you will not believe me when I disclaim him, you will have to believe me when I attack him. But I find readier credence when I go wrong than when I shew amendment. And this is not surprising, for my would-be friends suppose me a fellow-disciple with them in the arcana of their system. I am loath, they fancy, to profess esoteric doctrines before persons who according to them are brute-like and made of clay. For it is an axiom with them that pearls ought not to be lightly cast before swine, nor that which is holy given to the dogs. <a name="fr_2562"></a><a href="#fn_2562"><font size="1">2563</font></a>
  They agree with David when he says: “Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee;” <a name="fr_2563"></a><a href="#fn_2563"><font size="1">2564</font></a>
  and when in another place he describes the righteous man as one “who speaketh truth with his neighbour,” <a name="fr_2564"></a><a href="#fn_2564"><font size="1">2565</font></a>
  that is with those who “are of the household of faith.” <a name="fr_2565"></a><a href="#fn_2565"><font size="1">2566</font></a>
  From these passages they conclude that those of us who as yet are uninitiated ought to be told falsehoods, lest, being still unweaned babes, we should be choked by too solid food. Now that perjury and lying enter into their mysteries and form a bond between them appears most clearly from the sixth book of Origens Miscellanies, <a name="fr_2566"></a><a href="#fn_2566"><font size="1">2567</font></a>
  in which he harmonizes the Christian doctrine <a name="fr_2567"></a><a href="#fn_2567"><font size="1">2568</font></a>
  with the conceptions of Plato.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p28"></a>4. What must I do then? deny that I am of Origens opinion? They will not believe me. Swear that I am not? They will laugh and say that I deal in lies. I will do the one thing which they dread. I will bring forward their sacred rites and mysteries, and will expose the cunning whereby they delude simple folk like myself. Perhaps, although they refuse credence to my voice when I deny, they may believe my pen when I accuse. Of one thing they are particularly apprehensive, and that is that their writings may some day be taken as evidence against their master. They are ready to make statements on oath and to disclaim them afterwards with an oath as false as the first. When asked for their signatures they use shifts and seek excuses. One says: “I cannot condemn what no one else has condemned.” Another says: “No decision was arrived at on the point by the Fathers.” <a name="fr_2568"></a><a href="#fn_2568"><font size="1">2569</font></a>
  It is thus that they appeal to the judgment of the world to put off the necessity of assenting to a condemnation. Another says with yet more assurance: “how am I to condemn men whom the council of Nicæa has left untouched? For the council which condemned Arius would surely have condemned Origen too, had it disapproved of his doctrines.” They were bound in other words to cure all the diseases of the church at once and with one remedy; and by parity of reasoning we must deny the majesty of the Holy Ghost because nothing was said of his nature in that council. But the question was of Arius, not of Origen; of the Son, not of the Holy Ghost. The bishops at the council proclaimed their adherence to a dogma which was at the time denied; they said nothing about a difficulty which no one had raised. And yet they covertly struck at Origen as the source of the Arian heresy: for, in condemning those who deny the Son to be of the substance of the Father, they have condemned Origen as much as Arius. On the ground taken by these persons we have no right to condemn Valentine, <a name="fr_2569"></a><a href="#fn_2569"><font size="1">2570</font></a>
  Marcion, <a name="fr_2570"></a><a href="#fn_2570"><font size="1">2571</font></a>
  or the Cataphrygians, <a name="fr_2571"></a><a href="#fn_2571"><font size="1">2572</font></a>
  or Manichæus, none of whom are named by the council of Nicæa, and yet there is no doubt that in time they were prior to it. But when they find themselves pressed either to subscribe or to leave the Church, you may see some strange twisting. They qualify their words, they arrange them anew, they use vague expressions; so as, if possible, to hold both our confession and that of our opponents, to be called indifferently heretics and Catholics. As if it were not in the same spirit that the Delphian Apollo (or, as he is sometimes called, Loxias) gave his oracles <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXIV-Page_178"></a>to Crœsus and to Pyrrhus; cheating with a similar device two men widely separated in time. <a name="fr_2572"></a><a href="#fn_2572"><font size="1">2573</font></a>
  To make my meaning clear I will give a few examples.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p34"></a>5. We believe, say they, in the resurrection of the body. This confession, if only it be sincere, is free from objection. But as there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial <a name="fr_2573"></a><a href="#fn_2573"><font size="1">2574</font></a>
  and as thin air and the æther are both according to their natures called bodies, they use the word body instead of the word flesh in order that an orthodox person hearing them say body may take them to mean flesh while a heretic will understand that they mean spirit. This is their first piece of craft, and if this is found out, they devise fresh wiles, and, pretending innocence themselves, accuse us of malice. As though they were frank believers they say, “We believe in the resurrection of the flesh.” Now when they have said this, the ignorant crowd thinks it ought to be satisfied, particularly because these exact words are found in the creed. <a name="fr_2574"></a><a href="#fn_2574"><font size="1">2575</font></a>
  If you go on to question them farther, a buzz of disapproval is heard in the ring and their backers cry out: “You have heard them say that they believe in the resurrection of the flesh; what more do you want?” the popular favour is transferred from our side to theirs, and while they are called honest, we are looked on as false accusers. But if you set your face steadily and keeping a firm hold of their admission about the flesh, proceed to press them as to whether they assert the resurrection of that flesh which is visible and tangible, which walks and speaks, they first laugh and then signify their assent. And when we inquire whether the resurrection will exhibit anew the hair and the teeth, the chest and the stomach, the hands and the feet, and all the other members of the body, then no longer able to contain their mirth they burst out laughing and tell us that in that case we shall need barbers, and cakes, and doctors, and cobblers. Do we, they ask us in turn, believe that after the resurrection mens cheeks will still be rough and those of women smooth, and that sex will differentiate their bodies as it does at present? Then if we admit this, they at once deduce from our admission conclusions involving the grossest materialism. Thus, while they maintain the resurrection of the body as a whole, they deny the resurrection of its separate members.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p37"></a>6. The present is not a time to speak rhetorically against a perverse doctrine. Neither the rich vocabulary of Cicero nor the fervid eloquence of Demosthenes could adequately convey the warmth of my feeling, were I to attempt to expose the quibbles by which these heretics, while verbally professing a belief in the resurrection, in their hearts deny it. For their women finger their breasts, slap their chests, pinch their legs and arms, and say, “What will a resurrection profit us if these frail bodies are to rise again? No, if we are to be like angels, <a name="fr_2575"></a><a href="#fn_2575"><font size="1">2576</font></a>
  we shall have the bodies of angels.” That is to say they scorn to rise again with the flesh and bones wherewith even Christ rose. <a name="fr_2576"></a><a href="#fn_2576"><font size="1">2577</font></a>
  Now suppose for a moment that in my youth I went astray and that, trained as I was in the schools of heathen philosophy, I was ignorant, in the beginning of my faith, of the dogmas of Christianity, and fancied that what I had read in Pythagoras and Plato and Empedocles was also contained in the writings of the apostle: Supposing, I say, that I believed all this, why do you yet follow the error of a mere babe and sucking child in Christ? Why do you learn irreligion of one who as yet knew not religion? After shipwreck one has still a plank to cling to; <a name="fr_2577"></a><a href="#fn_2577"><font size="1">2578</font></a>
  and one may atone for sin by a frank confession. You have followed me when I have gone astray; follow me also now that I have been brought back. In youth we have wandered; now that we are old let us mend our ways. Let us unite our tears and our groans; let us weep together, and return to the Lord our Maker. <a name="fr_2578"></a><a href="#fn_2578"><font size="1">2579</font></a>
  Let us not wait for the repentance of the devil; for this is a vain anticipation and one that will drag us into the deep of hell. Life must be sought or lost here. If I have never followed Origen, it is in vain that you seek to discredit me: if I have been his disciple, imitate my penitence. You have believed my confession; credit also my denial.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p42"></a>7. But it will be said, “If you knew these things, why did you praise him in your works?” I should praise him today but that you and men like you praise his errors. I should still find his talent attractive, but that some people have been attracted by his impiety. “Read <a name="fr_2579"></a><a href="#fn_2579"><font size="1">2580</font></a>
  all things,” says the apostle, “hold fast that which is good.” <a name="fr_2580"></a><a href="#fn_2580"><font size="1">2581</font></a>
  Lactantius in his books and particularly in his letters to Demetrian altogether denies the subsistence of the Holy Spirit, and following the error of the Jews says that the passages in which he is spoken of refer to the Father or to the Son and that the words holy spirit merely prove <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXIV-Page_179"></a>the holiness of these two persons in the Godhead. But who can forbid me to read his <i>Institutes</i>—in which he has written against the Gentiles with much ability—simply because this opinion of his is to be abhorred? Apollinaris <a name="fr_2581"></a><a href="#fn_2581"><font size="1">2582</font></a>
  has written excellent treatises against Porphyry, and I approve of his labours, although I despise his doctrine in many points because of its foolishness. If you too for your parts will but admit that Origen errs in certain things I will not say another syllable. Acknowledge that he thought amiss concerning the Son, and still more amiss concerning the Holy Spirit, point out the impiety of which he has been guilty in speaking of mens souls as having fallen from heaven, and shew that, while in word he asserts the resurrection of the flesh, he destroys the force of this language by other assertions. As, for instance, that, after many ages and one “restitution of all things,” <a name="fr_2582"></a><a href="#fn_2582"><font size="1">2583</font></a>
  it will be the same for Gabriel as for the devil, for Paul as for Caiaphas, for virgins as for prostitutes. When once you have rejected these misstatements and have parted them with your censors wand from the faith of the Church, I may read what is left with safety, and having first taken the antidote need no longer dread the poison. For instance it will do me no harm to say as I have said, “Whereas in his other books Origen has surpassed all other writers, in commenting on the Song of Songs he has surpassed himself”; nor will I fear to face the words with which formerly in my younger days I spoke of him as a doctor of the churches. <a name="fr_2583"></a><a href="#fn_2583"><font size="1">2584</font></a>
  Will it be pretended, that I was bound to accuse a man whose works I was translating by special request? that I was bound to say in my preface, “This writer whose books I translate is a heretic: beware of him, reader, read him not, flee from the viper: or, if you are bent on reading him, know that the treatises which I have translated have been garbled by heretics and wicked men; yet you need not fear, for I have corrected all the places which they have corrupted,” that in other words I ought to have said: “the writer that I translate is a heretic, but I, his translator, am a Catholic.” The fact is that you and your party in your anxiety to be straightforward, ingenuous, and honest, have paid too little regard to the precepts of rhetoric and to the devices of oratory. For in admitting that his books <i>On First Principles</i> are heretical and in trying to lay the blame of this upon others, you raise difficulties for your readers; you induce them to examine the whole life of the author and to form a judgment on the question from the remainder of his writings. I on the other hand have been wise enough to emend silently what I wished to emend: thus by ignoring the crime I have averted prejudice from the criminal. Doctors tell us that serious maladies ought not to be subjected to treatment, but should be left to nature, lest the remedies applied should intensify the disease. It is now almost one hundred and fifty years since Origen died at Tyre. <a name="fr_2584"></a><a href="#fn_2584"><font size="1">2585</font></a>
  Yet what Latin writer has ever ventured to translate his books <i>On the Resurrection</i> and <i>On First Principles</i>, his <i>Miscellanies</i> <a name="fr_2585"></a><a href="#fn_2585"><font size="1">2586</font></a>
  and his <i>Commentaries</i> or as he himself calls them his <i>Tomes?</i> <a name="fr_2586"></a><a href="#fn_2586"><font size="1">2587</font></a>
  Who has ever cared by so infamous a work to cover himself with infamy? I am not more eloquent than Hilary or truer to the faith than Victorinus who both have rendered his <i>Homilies</i> <a name="fr_2587"></a><a href="#fn_2587"><font size="1">2588</font></a>
 not in exact versions but in independent paraphrases. Recently also Ambrose appropriated his <i>Six Days Work</i>, <a name="fr_2588"></a><a href="#fn_2588"><font size="1">2589</font></a>
  but in such a way that it expressed the views of Hippolytus and Basil rather than of Origen. You profess to take me for your model, and blind as moles in relation to others you scan me with the eyes of gazelles. Well, had I been ill-disposed towards Origen, I might have translated these very books so as to make his worst writings known to Latin readers; but this I have never done; and, though many have asked me, I have always refused. For it has never been my habit to crow over the mistakes of men whose talents I admire. Origen himself, were he still alive, would soon fall out with you his would-be patrons and would say with Jacob: “Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land.” <a name="fr_2589"></a><a href="#fn_2589"><font size="1">2590</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p54"></a>8. Does any one wish to praise Origen? Let him praise him as I do. From his childhood he was a great man, and truly a martyrs son. <a name="fr_2590"></a><a href="#fn_2590"><font size="1">2591</font></a>
  At Alexandria he presided over the school of the church, succeeding a man of great learning the presbyter Clement. So greatly did he abhor sensuality that, out of a zeal for God but yet one not according to knowledge, <a name="fr_2591"></a><a href="#fn_2591"><font size="1">2592</font></a>
  he castrated himself with a knife. Covetousness he trampled under foot. He knew the scriptures by heart and laboured hard day and night to explain their meaning. He delivered in church more than a thousand sermons, and published innumerable commentaries which he called tomes. These I now pass over, for it is not my purpose to catalogue his writings. Which of us can read all that he has written? and who can fail to ad<a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXIV-Page_180"></a>mire his enthusiasm for the scriptures? If some one in the spirit of Judas the Zealot <a name="fr_2592"></a><a href="#fn_2592"><font size="1">2593</font></a>
  brings up to me his mistakes, he shall have his answer in the words of Horace:</p>  
 <p class="c33"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p58"></a>Tis true that sometimes Homer sleeps, but then</p>  
 <p class="c33"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p59"></a>Hes not without excuse:</p>  
 <p class="c34"><a name="v.LXXXIV-p60"></a>The fault is venial, for his work is long. <a name="fr_2593"></a><a href="#fn_2593"><font size="1">2594</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p62"></a>Let us not imitate the faults of one whose virtues we cannot equal. Other men have erred concerning the faith, both Greeks and Latins, but I must not mention their names lest I should be supposed to defend Origen not by his own merits but by the errors of others. This, you will say, is to accuse them and not to excuse him. You would be right, if I had declared him not to have erred, or if I had professed a belief that the apostle Paul or an angel from heaven <a name="fr_2594"></a><a href="#fn_2594"><font size="1">2595</font></a>
  ought to be listened to in a depravation of the faith. But as it is seeing I frankly admit him to be wrong, I may read him on the same terms as I read others, because if he is wrong so also are they. But you may say, If error is common to many, why do you assail him alone? I answer, because he alone is praised by you as an apostle. Take away your exaggerated love for him, and I am ready to take away the greatness of my dislike. While you gather other mens faulty statements out of their books merely to defend Origen in his error, you extol this latter to the sky and will not allow that he has erred at all. Whosoever you are who are thus preaching new doctrines, I beseech you, spare the ears of the Romans, spare the faith of a church which an apostle has praised. <a name="fr_2595"></a><a href="#fn_2595"><font size="1">2596</font></a>
  Why after four hundred years do you try to teach us Romans doctrines of which until now we have known nothing? Why do you publicly proclaim opinions which Peter and Paul <a name="fr_2596"></a><a href="#fn_2596"><font size="1">2597</font></a>
  refused to profess? Until now no such teaching has been heard of, and yet the world has become christian. For my part I will hold fast in my old age the faith wherein I was born again in my boyhood. <a name="fr_2597"></a><a href="#fn_2597"><font size="1">2598</font></a>
  They speak of us as claytowners, <a name="fr_2598"></a><a href="#fn_2598"><font size="1">2599</font></a>
  made out of dirt, brutish and carnal, because, say they, we refuse to receive the things of the spirit; but of course they themselves are citizens of Jerusalem and their mother is in heaven. <a name="fr_2599"></a><a href="#fn_2599"><font size="1">2600</font></a>
  I do not despise the flesh in which Christ was born and rose again, or scorn the mud which, baked into a clean vessel, reigns in heaven. And yet I wonder why they who detract from the flesh live after the flesh, <a name="fr_2600"></a><a href="#fn_2600"><font size="1">2601</font></a>
  and cherish and delicately nurture that which is their enemy. Perhaps indeed they wish to fulfil the words of scripture: “love your enemies and bless them that persecute you.” <a name="fr_2601"></a><a href="#fn_2601"><font size="1">2602</font></a>
  I love the flesh, but I love it only when it is chaste, when it is virginal, when it is mortified by fasting: I love not its works but itself, that flesh which knows that it must be judged, and therefore dies as a martyr for Christ, which is scourged and torn asunder and burned with fire.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p71"></a>9. The folly also of their contention that certain heretics and ill-disposed persons have tampered with Origens writings may be shewn thus. Could any person be more wise, more learned, or more eloquent than were Eusebius and Didymus, Origens supporters? Of these the former in the six volumes of his <i>Apology</i> <a name="fr_2602"></a><a href="#fn_2602"><font size="1">2603</font></a>
 asserts that Origen is of the same mind with himself; while the latter, though he tries to excuse his errors, admits that he has made them. Not being able to deny what he finds written, he endeavours to explain it away. It is one thing to say that additions have been made by heretics, but another to maintain that heretical statements are commendable. Origens case would be unique if his writings were falsified all over the world and if in one day by an edict like that of Mithridates <a name="fr_2603"></a><a href="#fn_2603"><font size="1">2604</font></a>
  all the truth were shorn from his volumes. Even supposing that some one treatise of his has been tampered with, can it be possible that all his works, published as they were at different times and places, have been corrupted? Origen himself in a letter written to Fabian, bishop of Rome, <a name="fr_2604"></a><a href="#fn_2604"><font size="1">2605</font></a>
  expresses penitence for having made erroneous statements, and charges Ambrose <a name="fr_2605"></a><a href="#fn_2605"><font size="1">2606</font></a>
  with over haste in making public what was meant only for private circulation. And yet to this day his disciples search for shifts to prove that all that excites disapprobation in his writings is due not to him but to others.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p76"></a>10. Moreover, when they speak of Pamphilus as one who praised Origen, I am personally much obliged to them for accounting me worthy to be calumniated with that martyr. For if, sirs, you tell me that Origens books have been tampered with by his enemies to bring them into discredit; why may not I in my turn allege that his friends and followers have attributed to Pamphilus a volume composed by themselves to vindicate their master from disrepute by the testimony of a martyr? Lo and behold, you yourselves <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXIV-Page_181"></a>correct in Origens books passages which (according to you) he never wrote: and yet you are surprised if a man is said to have published a book which as a matter of fact he did not publish. But while your statements can easily be brought to the test by an appeal to Origens published works; as Pamphilus has published nothing else, it is easier for calumny to fix a book upon him. For shew me any other work of Pamphilus; you will nowhere find any, this is his only one. How then can I know that it is by Pamphilus? You will tell me, that the style and tone ought to inform me. Well, I shall never believe that a man so learned has dedicated the first fruits of his talent to defend doubtful and discredited positions. The very name of an apology which the treatise bears implies a previous charge made; for nothing is defended that is not first attacked. I will now bring forward but a single argument, one, however, the force of which only folly and effrontery can deny. The treatise attributed to Pamphilus contains nearly the first thousand lines of Eusebiuss sixth book in defence of Origen. <a name="fr_2606"></a><a href="#fn_2606"><font size="1">2607</font></a>
  Yet in the remaining parts of his work the writer brings forward passages by which he seeks to prove that Origen was a Catholic. Now Eusebius and Pamphilus were in such thorough harmony with each other that they seemed to have but one soul between them, and one even went so far as to adopt the others name. <a name="fr_2607"></a><a href="#fn_2607"><font size="1">2608</font></a>
  How then could they have disagreed so fundamentally on this point, Eusebius in all his works proving Origen to be an Arian, and Pamphilus describing him as a supporter of the Nicene council, which had not yet been held? It is evident from this consideration that the book belongs not to Pamphilus but to Didymus or somebody else, who having cut off the head of Eusebiuss sixth book supplied the other members himself. But I am willing to be generous and to allow that the book is written by Pamphilus, only by Pamphilus not yet a martyr. For he must have written the book before he underwent martyrdom. And why, you will say, was he accounted worthy of martyrdom? Surely that he might efface his error by a martyrs death, and wash away his one fault by shedding his blood. How many martyrs there have been all the world over who before their deaths have been the slaves of sins! Are we then to palliate the sins because those who committed them have afterwards become martyrs?</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXIV-p79"></a>11. This reply to your letter, my most loving brothers, I have dictated in all haste; and, overcoming my scruples, I have taken up my pen against a man whose ability I once eulogized. I would sooner, indeed, risk my reputation than my faith. My friends have placed me in the awkward dilemma that if I say nothing I shall be held guilty, and if I offer a defence I shall be accounted an enemy. Both alternatives are hard; but of the two I will choose that which is the least so. A quarrel can be made up, but blasphemy can find no forgiveness. I leave to your judgment to discover how much labour I have expended in translating the books <i>On First Principles</i>; for on the one hand if one alters anything from the Greek the work becomes less a version than a perversion; and on the other hand a literal adherence to the original by no means tends to preserve the charm of its eloquence.</p>
