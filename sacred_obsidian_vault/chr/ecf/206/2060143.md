 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXXII-p2"></a>In this letter Augustine deals with the statement of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010">James ii. 10</a><a name="v.CXXXII-p2.1"></a> (“whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all”) and explains it by saying that every breach of the law is a breach of love. He also takes occasion to criticise two doctrines of the schools then prevalent, (1) that all sins are equal and (2) that he who has one virtue has all and that all virtues are wanting to him who lacks one.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXXXII-p3"></a>The date of the letter is 415 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXXXII-p3.1"></a>a.d.</span> Its number in the Letters of Augustine is CLXVII.</p>
