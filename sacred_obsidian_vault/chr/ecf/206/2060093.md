 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.LXXXII-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.LXXXII-p1.1"></a>Letter LXXXII. To Theophilus Bishop of Alexandria.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXII-p2"></a>Two years after his former attempt (see Letter LXIII.) Theophilus again wrote to Jerome urging him to be reconciled with John of Jerusalem. Jerome replies that there is nothing he desires more earnestly than peace but that this must be real and not a hollow truce. He speaks very bitterly of John who has, he alleges, intrigued to procure his banishment from Palestine. He also deals with the ordination of his brother Paulinian (for which see Letter LI.) and defends himself for having translated Origens commentaries by adducing the example of Hilary of Poitiers. This letter should be compared with the Treatise “Against John of Jerusalem” in this volume. Its date is 399 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXXXII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXII-p3"></a>1. Your letter shews you to possess that heritage of the Lord of which when going to the Father he said to the apostles, “peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,” <a name="fr_2495"></a><a href="#fn_2495"><font size="1">2496</font></a>
  and to own the happiness described in the words, “blessed are the peace-makers.” <a name="fr_2496"></a><a href="#fn_2496"><font size="1">2497</font></a>
  You coax as a father, you teach as a master, you enjoin as a bishop. You come to me not with a rod and severity but in a spirit of kindness, gentleness, and meekness. <a name="fr_2497"></a><a href="#fn_2497"><font size="1">2498</font></a>
  Your opening words echo the humility of Christ who saved men not with thunder and lightning <a name="fr_2498"></a><a href="#fn_2498"><font size="1">2499</font></a>
  but as a wailing babe in the manger and as a silent sufferer upon the cross. You <a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 171</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXII-Page_171"></a>have read the prediction made in one who was a type of Him, “Lord, remember David and all his meekness,” <a name="fr_2499"></a><a href="#fn_2499"><font size="1">2500</font></a>
  and you know how it was fulfilled afterwards in Himself. “Learn of me,” He said, “for I am meek and lowly in heart.” <a name="fr_2500"></a><a href="#fn_2500"><font size="1">2501</font></a>
  You have quoted many passages from the sacred books in praise of peace, you have flitted like a bee over the flowery fields of scripture, you have culled with cunning eloquence all that is sweet and conducive to concord. I was already running after peace, but you have made me quicken my pace: my sails were set for the voyage but your exhortation has filled them with a stronger breeze. I drink in the sweet streams of peace not reluctantly and with aversion but eagerly and with open mouth.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p10"></a>2. But what can I do, I who can only wish for peace and have no power to bring it about? Even though the wish may win its recompense with God, its futility must still sadden him who cherishes it. When the apostle said, “as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men,” <a name="fr_2501"></a><a href="#fn_2501"><font size="1">2502</font></a>
  he knew quite well that the realisation of peace depends upon the consent of two parties. The prophet truly cries “They say Peace, peace: and yet there is no peace.” <a name="fr_2502"></a><a href="#fn_2502"><font size="1">2503</font></a>
  To overthrow peace by actions while professing it in words is not hard. To point out its advantages is one thing and to strive for it another. Mens speeches may be all for unity but their actions may enforce bondage. I wish for peace as much as others; and not only do I wish for it, I ask for it. But the peace which I want is the peace of Christ; a true peace, a peace without rancour, a peace which does not involve war, a peace which will not reduce opponents but will unite friends. How can I term domination peace? I must call things by their right names. Where there is hatred there let men talk of feuds; and where there is mutual esteem, there only let peace be spoken of. For my part I neither rend the church nor separate myself from the communion of the fathers. From my very cradle, I may say, I have been reared on Catholic milk; and no one can be a better churchman than one who has never been a heretic. But I know nothing of a peace that is without love or of a communion that is without peace. In the gospel I read:—“if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.” <a name="fr_2503"></a><a href="#fn_2503"><font size="1">2504</font></a>
  If then we may not offer gifts that are our own unless we are at peace with our brothers; how much less can we receive the body of Christ if we cherish enmity in our hearts? How can I conscientiously approach Christs eucharist and answer the Amen <a name="fr_2504"></a><a href="#fn_2504"><font size="1">2505</font></a>
  if I doubt the charity of him who ministers it?</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p15"></a>3. Hear me, I beg you with patience and do not take truthfulness for flattery. Is any man reluctant to communicate with you? Does any turn his face away when you hold out your hand? Does any at the holy banquet offer you the kiss of Judas? <a name="fr_2505"></a><a href="#fn_2505"><font size="1">2506</font></a>
  At your approach the monks instead of trembling rejoice. They race to meet you and leaving their dens in the desert are fain to master you by their humility. What compels them to come forth? Is it not their love for you? What draws together the scattered dwellers in the desert? Is it not the esteem in which they hold you? A parent ought to love his children; and not only a parent but a bishop ought to be loved by his children. Neither ought to be feared. There is an old saying: <a name="fr_2506"></a><a href="#fn_2506"><font size="1">2507</font></a>
  “whom a man fears he hates; and whom he hates, he would fain see dead.” Accordingly, while for the young the holy scripture makes fear the beginning of knowledge, <a name="fr_2507"></a><a href="#fn_2507"><font size="1">2508</font></a>
  it also tells us that “perfect love casteth out fear.” <a name="fr_2508"></a><a href="#fn_2508"><font size="1">2509</font></a>
  You exact no obedience from them; therefore the monks obey you. You offer them a kiss; therefore they bow the neck. You shew yourself a common soldier; therefore they make you their general. Thus from being one among many you become one above many. Freedom is easily roused if attempts are made to crush it. No one gets more from a free man than he who does not force him to be a slave. I know the canons of the church; I know what rank her ministers hold; and from men and books I have daily up to the present learned and gathered many things. The kingdom of the mild David was quickly dismembered by one who chastised his people with scorpions and fancied that his fingers were thicker than his fathers loins. <a name="fr_2509"></a><a href="#fn_2509"><font size="1">2510</font></a>
  The Roman people refused to brook insolence even in a king. <a name="fr_2510"></a><a href="#fn_2510"><font size="1">2511</font></a>
  Moses was leader of the host of Israel; he brought ten plagues upon Egypt; sky, earth, and sea alike obeyed his commands: yet he is spoken of as “very meek above all the men which were” at that time “upon the face of the earth.” <a name="fr_2511"></a><a href="#fn_2511"><font size="1">2512</font></a>
  He maintained his forty-years supremacy because he tempered the insolence of office with gentleness and meekness. When he was being stoned by the people he <a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 172</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXII-Page_172"></a>made intercession for them; <a name="fr_2512"></a><a href="#fn_2512"><font size="1">2513</font></a>
  nay more he wished to be blotted out of Gods book sooner than that the flock committed to him should perish. <a name="fr_2513"></a><a href="#fn_2513"><font size="1">2514</font></a>
  He sought to imitate the Shepherd who would, he knew, carry on his shoulders even the wandering sheep. “The good Shepherd”—they are the Lords own words—“layeth down his life for the sheep.” <a name="fr_2514"></a><a href="#fn_2514"><font size="1">2515</font></a>
  One of his disciples can wish to be anathema from Christ for his brethrens sake, his kinsmen according to the flesh who were Israelites. <a name="fr_2515"></a><a href="#fn_2515"><font size="1">2516</font></a>
  If then Paul can desire to perish that the lost may not be lost, how much should good parents not provoke their children to wrath <a name="fr_2516"></a><a href="#fn_2516"><font size="1">2517</font></a>
  or by too great severity embitter those who are naturally mild.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p28"></a>4. The limits of a letter compel me to restrain myself; otherwise, indignation would make me diffuse. In an epistle which its writer regards as conciliatory but which to me appears full of malice my opponent <a name="fr_2517"></a><a href="#fn_2517"><font size="1">2518</font></a>
  admits that I have never calumniated him or accused him of heresy. Why then does he calumniate me by spreading a rumour that I am infected with that awful malady and am in revolt against the Church? Why is he so ready to spare his real assailants and so eager to injure me who have done nothing to injure him? Before my brothers ordination he said nothing of any dogmatic difference between himself and pope Epiphanius. What then can have “forced” him—I use his own word—publicly to argue a point which no one had yet raised? One so full of wisdom as you knows well the danger of such discussions and that silence is in such cases the safest course; except, indeed, on some occasion which renders it imperative to deal with great matters. What ability and eloquence it must have needed to compress into a single sermon—as he boasts to have done <a name="fr_2518"></a><a href="#fn_2518"><font size="1">2519</font></a>
 —all the topics which the most learned writers have treated in detail in voluminous treatises! But this is nothing to me: it is for the hearers of the sermon to notice and for the writer of the letter to realize. But as for me he ought of his own accord to acquit me of bringing the charge against him. I was not present and did not hear the sermon. I was only one of the many, indeed hardly one of them; for while others were crying out I held my peace. Let us confront the accused and the accuser, and let us give credit to him whose services, life, and doctrine are seen to be the best.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p31"></a>5. You see, do you not, that I shut my eyes to many things and touch upon others only in the most cursory manner, hinting at what I suppose rather than saying out what I think.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p32"></a>I understand and approve your manœuvres; <a name="fr_2519"></a><a href="#fn_2519"><font size="1">2520</font></a>
  how in the interests of the peace of the Church you stop your ears when you come within range of the Sirens. Moreover, trained as you have been from childhood in sacred studies, you know exactly what is meant by each expression which you use. You knowingly employ ambiguous terms and carefully balanced sentences so as not to condemn others <a name="fr_2520"></a><a href="#fn_2520"><font size="1">2521</font></a>
  or repudiate us. <a name="fr_2521"></a><a href="#fn_2521"><font size="1">2522</font></a>
  But it is not a pure faith and a frank confession which look for quibbles or circumlocutions. What is simply believed must be professed with equal simplicity. For my part I could cry out—though it were amid the swords and fires of Babylon, “why does the answer evade the question? why is there no frank, straightforward declaration?” From beginning to end all is shrinking, compromise, ambiguity: as though he were trying to walk on spikes of corn. His blood boils with eagerness for peace; yet he will not give a straightforward answer! others are free to insult him; for, when he is insulted, he does not venture to retaliate. I meantime hold my peace: for the present I shall let it be thought that I am too busy, or ignorant, or afraid; for how would he treat me were I to accuse him, if when I praise him—as he admits himself that I do—he secretly traduces me?</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p36"></a>6. His whole letter is less an exposition of his faith than a mass of calumnies aimed at myself. Without any of those mutual courtesies which men may use towards each other without flattery, he takes up my name again and again, flouts it, and bandies it about as though I were blotted out of the book of the living. He thinks that he has beaten me black and blue with his letter; and that I live for the trifles at which he aims, I who from my boyhood have been shut up in a monastic cell, and have always made it my aim to be rather than to seem a good man. Some of us, it is true, he mentions with respect, but only that he may afterwards wound us more deeply. As if, forsooth, we too have no open secrets to reveal! One of his charges is that we have allowed a slave to be ordained. Yet he himself has clergymen of the same class, and he must have read of Onesimus who, being made regenerate by Paul in prison, <a name="fr_2522"></a><a href="#fn_2522"><font size="1">2523</font></a>
  from a slave became a deacon. Then he throws out that the slave in question was a common informer; and, lest he should be compelled to prove the charge, declares he has it from hearsay only! Why, <a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXII-Page_173"></a>if I had chosen to repeat the talk of the crowd and to listen to scandal-mongers, he would have learned before now that I too know what all the world knows and have heard the same stories as other people. He declares farther that ordination has been given to this slave as a reward for a slander spread abroad by him. Does not such cunning and subtlety appal one? And is there any answer to eloquence so overwhelming? Which is best, to spread a calumny or to suffer from one? To accuse a man whose love you may afterwards wish for, or to pardon a sinner? And is it more tolerable that a common informer should be made a consul than that he should be made an ædile? <a name="fr_2523"></a><a href="#fn_2523"><font size="1">2524</font></a>
  He knows what I pass over in silence and what I say; what I myself have heard and what—from the fear of Christ—I perhaps refuse to believe.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p39"></a>7. He charges me with having translated Origen into Latin. In this I do not stand alone for the confessor Hilary has done the same, and we are both at one in this that while we have rendered all that is useful, we have cut away all that was harmful. Let him read our versions for himself, if he knows how (and as he constantly converses and daily associates with Italians, <a name="fr_2524"></a><a href="#fn_2524"><font size="1">2525</font></a>
  I think he cannot be ignorant of Latin); or else, if he cannot quite take it in, let him use his interpreters and then he will come to know that I deserve nothing but praise for the work on which he grounds a charge against me. For, while I have always allowed to Origen his great merit as an interpreter and critic of the scriptures, I have invariably denied the truth of his doctrines. Is it I then that let him loose upon the crowd? Is it I that act sponsor to other preachers like him? No, for I know that a difference must be made between the apostles and all other preachers. The former always speak the truth; but the latter being men sometimes go astray. It would be a strange defence of Origen surely to admit his faults and then to excuse them by saying that other men have been guilty of similar ones! As if, when you cannot venture to defend a man openly, you may hope to shield him by imputing his mistake to a number of others! As for the six thousand volumes of Origen of which he speaks, it is impossible that any one should have read books which have never been written: and I for my part find it easier to suppose that this falsehood is due to the man who professes to have heard it rather than to him who is said to have told it. <a name="fr_2525"></a><a href="#fn_2525"><font size="1">2526</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p42"></a>8. Again he avers that my brother <a name="fr_2526"></a><a href="#fn_2526"><font size="1">2527</font></a>
  is the cause of the disagreement which has arisen, a man who is content to stay in a monastic cell and who regards the clerical office as onerous rather than honourable. And although up to this very day he has spoon-fed us with insincere protestations of peace, he has caused commotion in the minds of the western bishops <a name="fr_2527"></a><a href="#fn_2527"><font size="1">2528</font></a>
  by telling them that a mere youth, hardly more than a boy, has been ordained <a name="fr_2528"></a><a href="#fn_2528"><font size="1">2529</font></a>
  presbyter of Bethlehem in his own diocese. If this is the truth, all the bishops of Palestine must be aware of it. For the monastery of the reverend pope Epiphanius—called the old monastery—where my brother was ordained presbyter is situated in the district of Eleutheropolis <a name="fr_2529"></a><a href="#fn_2529"><font size="1">2530</font></a>
  and not in that of Ælia. <a name="fr_2530"></a><a href="#fn_2530"><font size="1">2531</font></a>
  Furthermore his age is well known to your Holiness; and as he has now attained to thirty years I apprehend that no blame can attach to him on that score. Indeed this particular age is stamped as full and complete by the mystery of Christs assumed manhood. Let him call to mind the ancient law, and he will see that after his twenty-fifth year a Levite might be chosen to the priesthood; <a name="fr_2531"></a><a href="#fn_2531"><font size="1">2532</font></a>
  or if in this passage he prefers to follow the Hebrew he will find that candidates for the priesthood must be thirty years old. And that he may not venture to say that “old things are passed away; and, behold, all things are become new,” <a name="fr_2532"></a><a href="#fn_2532"><font size="1">2533</font></a>
  let him hear the apostles words to Timothy, “Let no man despise thy youth.” <a name="fr_2533"></a><a href="#fn_2533"><font size="1">2534</font></a>
  Certainly when my opponent was himself ordained bishop, he was not much older than my brother is now. And if he argues that youth is no hindrance to a bishop but that it is to a presbyter because a young elder <a name="fr_2534"></a><a href="#fn_2534"><font size="1">2535</font></a>
  is a contradiction in terms, I ask him this question: Why has he himself ordained a presbyter of this age or younger still, and that too to minister in another mans church? But if he cannot be at peace with my brother unless he consents to submit and to renounce the bishop who has ordained him, he shews plainly that his object is not peace but revenge, and that he will not rest satisfied with the quietude of repose and peace unless he is able to inflict to the full every penalty that he now threatens. Had he himself ordained my brother, it would have made no difference to this latter. So dearly does he love seclusion that he would even then have continued to live <a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXII-Page_174"></a>quietly and would not have exercised his office. And should the bishop have seen fit to rend the church on that score, he would then have owed him nothing save the respect which is due to all who offer sacrifice. <a name="fr_2535"></a><a href="#fn_2535"><font size="1">2536</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p53"></a>9. So much for his prolix defence of himself or I should rather say his attack on me. In this letter I have only answered him briefly and cursorily that from what I have said he may perceive what I do not say, and may know that as I am a human being I am a rational animal and well able to understand his shrewdness, and that I am not so obtuse or brutish as to catch only the sound of his words and not their meaning. I now ask of you to pardon my chagrin and to allow that if it is arrogant to answer back, it is yet more arrogant to bring baseless charges. Yet my answer has indicated what I might have said rather than has actually said it. Why do men look for peace at a distance? and why do they wish to have it enforced by word of command? Let them shew themselves peacemakers, and peace will follow at once. Why do they use the name of your holiness to terrorize us, when your letter—strange contrast to their harsh and menacing words—breathes only peace and meekness? For that the letter which Isidore the presbyter has brought for me from you does make for peace and harmony I know by this, that these insincere professors of a wish for peace have refused to deliver it to me. Let them choose whichever alternative they please. Either I am a good man or I am a bad one. If I am a good one let them leave me in quiet: if I am a bad one, why do they desire to be in bad company? Surely my opponent has learnt by experience the value of humility. He who now tears asunder things which, formerly separate, he of his own will put together, proves that in severing now what he then joined, he is acting at the instigation of another. <a name="fr_2536"></a><a href="#fn_2536"><font size="1">2537</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p55"></a>10. Recently he sought and obtained a decree of exile against me, and I only wish that he had been able to carry it out, <a name="fr_2537"></a><a href="#fn_2537"><font size="1">2538</font></a>
  so that, as the will is imputed to him for the deed, so I too not in will only but in deed might wear the crown of exile. The church of Christ has been founded by shedding its own blood not that of others, by enduring outrage not by inflicting it. Persecutions have made it grow; martyrdoms have crowned it. Or if the Christians among whom I live are unique in their love of severity and know only how to persecute and not how to undergo persecution, there are Jews here, there are heretics professing various false doctrines, and in particular the foulest of all, I mean, Manichæism. Why is it that they do not venture to say a word against them? Why am I the only person they wish to drive into exile? Am I who communicate with the church the only person of whom it can be said that he rends the church? I put it to you, is it not a fair demand either that they should expel these others as well as myself, or that, if they keep them, they should keep me too? All the same they honour men by sending them into exile, for by so doing they separate them from the company of heretics. It is a monk, <a name="fr_2538"></a><a href="#fn_2538"><font size="1">2539</font></a>
  shame to say, who menaces monks and obtains decrees of exile against them; and that too a monk who boasts that he holds an apostolic chair. But the monastic tribe does not succumb to terrorism: it prefers to expose its neck to the impending sword rather than to allow its hands to be tied. Is not every monk an exile from his country? Is he not an exile from the whole world? Where is the need for the public authority, the cost of a rescript, the journeyings up and down the earth to obtain one? Let him but touch me with his little finger, and I will go into exile of myself. “The earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof.” <a name="fr_2539"></a><a href="#fn_2539"><font size="1">2540</font></a>
  Christ is not shut up in any one spot.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.LXXXII-p59"></a>11. Moreover when he writes that, though I seem to be separated from communion with him, I in reality hold communion with him through you and through the church of Rome: he need not go so far afield, for I am connected with him in the same way also here in Palestine. And lest even this should appear distant, in this village of Bethlehem I hold communion with his presbyters as much as I can. Thus it is clear that a private chagrin is not to be taken for the cause of the church, and that one mans choler, or even that of several stirred up by him, ought not to be styled the displeasure of the church. Accordingly I now repeat what I said at the beginning of my letter that I for my part am desirous of Christs peace, that I pray for harmony, and that I request you to admonish him not to exact peace but to purpose it. Let him be satisfied with the pain which he has caused by the insults that he has inflicted upon me in the past. Let him efface old wounds by a little new charity. Let him shew himself what he was before, when of his own choice he bestowed upon me his esteem. Let his words no longer be tinged with a gall that flows from the heart of another. Let him do what he wishes himself, and not what others <a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a> <a name="v.LXXXII-Page_175"></a>force him to wish. Either as a pontiff, let him exercise authority over all alike, or as a follower of the apostle, let him serve all for the salvation of all. <a name="fr_2540"></a><a href="#fn_2540"><font size="1">2541</font></a>
  If he will shew himself such, I am ready freely to yield and to hold out my arms; he will find me a friend and a kinsman, and will perceive that in Christ I am submissive to him as to all the saints. “Charity,” writes the apostle, “suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not;…is not puffed up…beareth all things, believeth all things.” <a name="fr_2541"></a><a href="#fn_2541"><font size="1">2542</font></a>
  Charity is the mother of all virtues, and the apostles words about faith, hope and charity <a name="fr_2542"></a><a href="#fn_2542"><font size="1">2543</font></a>
  are like that threefold cord which is not quickly broken. <a name="fr_2543"></a><a href="#fn_2543"><font size="1">2544</font></a>
  We believe, we hope, and through our faith and hope we are joined together in the bond of charity. <a name="fr_2544"></a><a href="#fn_2544"><font size="1">2545</font></a>
  It is for these virtues that I and others have left our homes, it is for these that we would live peaceably without any contention in the fields and alone; paying all due veneration to Christs pontiffs—so long as they preach the right faith—not because we fear them as lords but because we honour them as fathers deferring also to bishops as bishops, but refusing to serve under compulsion, beneath the shadow of episcopal authority, men whom we do not choose to obey. I am not so much puffed up in mind as not to know what is due to the priests of Christ. For he who receives them, receives not them but Him, whose bishops they are. <a name="fr_2545"></a><a href="#fn_2545"><font size="1">2546</font></a>
  But let them be content with the honour which is theirs. Let them know that they are fathers and not lords, especially in relation to those who scorn the ambitions of the world and count peace and repose the best of all things. And may Christ who is Almighty God grant to your prayers that I and my opponent may be united not in a feigned and hollow peace but in true and sincere mutual esteem, lest biting and devouring one another we be consumed one of another. <a name="fr_2546"></a><a href="#fn_2546"><font size="1">2547</font></a>
