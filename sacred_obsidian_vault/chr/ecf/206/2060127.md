 <p><a name="v.CXVI-p2"></a>A long letter in which Augustine for the third time (see Letters LVI., LXVII.) restates his opinion about Jeromes theory of the dispute between Peter and Paul at Antioch. In doing so, however, he disclaims all desire to hurt Jeromes feelings, apologizes for the tone of his previous letters, and again explains that it is not his fault that they have failed so long to reach Jerome.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXVI-p3"></a>Written shortly after the preceding.</p>
