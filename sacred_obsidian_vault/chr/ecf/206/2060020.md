 <p> <a name="v.IX"></a>
 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.IX-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.IX-p1.1"></a>Letter IX. To Chrysogonus, a Monk of Aquileia.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.IX-p2"></a>A bantering letter to an indifferent correspondent. Of the same date as the preceding.</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.IX-p3"></a>Heliodorus, <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">125</font></a>
  who is so dear to us both, and who loves you with an affection no less <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a> <a name="v.IX-Page_11"></a>deep than my own, may have given you a faithful account of my feelings towards you; how your name is always on my lips, and how in every conversation which I have with him I begin by recalling my pleasant intercourse with you, and go on to marvel at your lowliness, to extol your virtue, and to proclaim your holy love.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.IX-p5"></a>Lynxes, they say, when they look behind them, forget what they have just seen, and lose all thought of what their eyes have ceased to behold. And so it seems to be with you. For so entirely have you forgotten our joint attachment that you have not merely blurred but erased the writing of that epistle which, as the apostle tells us, <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">126</font></a>
  is written in the hearts of Christians. The creatures that I have mentioned lurk on branches of leafy trees and pounce on fleet roes or frightened stags. In vain their victims fly, for they carry their tormentors with them, and these rend their flesh as they run. Lynxes, however, only hunt when an empty belly makes their mouths dry. When they have satisfied their thirst for blood, and have filled their stomachs with food, satiety induces forgetfulness, and they bestow no thought on future prey till hunger recalls them to a sense of their need.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.IX-p7"></a>Now in your case it cannot be that you have already had enough of me. Why then do you bring to a premature close a friendship which is but just begun? Why do you let slip what you have hardly as yet fully grasped? But as such remissness as yours is never at a loss for an excuse, you will perhaps declare that you had nothing to write. Had this been so, you should still have written to inform me of the fact.</p>
