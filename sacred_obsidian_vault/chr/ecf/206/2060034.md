 <p> <a name="v.XXIII"></a>
 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.XXIII-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XXIII-p1.1"></a>Letter XXIII. To Marcella.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XXIII-p2"></a>Jerome writes to Marcella to console her for the loss of a friend who, like herself, was the head of a religious society at Rome. The news of Leas death had first reached Marcella when she was engaged with Jerome in the study of the 73d psalm. Later in the day he writes this letter in which, after extolling Lea, he contrasts her end with that of the consul-elect, Vettius Agorius Prætextatus, a man of great ability and integrity, whom he declares to be now “in Tartarus.” Written at Rome in 384 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XXIII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XXIII-p3"></a>1. To-day, about the third hour, just as I was beginning to read with you the seventy-second psalm <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">678</font></a>
 —the first, that is, of the third book—and to explain that its title belonged partly to the second book and partly to the third—the previous book, I mean, concluding with the words “the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended,” <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">679</font></a>
  and the next commencing with the words “a psalm of Asaph” <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">680</font></a>
 —and just as I had come on the passage in which the righteous man declares: “If I say, I will speak thus; behold I should offend against the generation of thy children,” <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">681</font></a>
  a verse which is differently rendered in our Latin version: <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">682</font></a>
 —suddenly the news came that our most saintly friend Lea had departed from the body. As was only natural, you turned deadly pale; for there are few persons, if any, who do not burst into tears when the earthen vessel breaks. <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">683</font></a>
  But if you wept it was not from doubt as to her future lot, but only because you had not rendered to her the last sad offices which are due to the dead. Finally, as we were still conversing together, a second message informed us that her remains had been already conveyed to Ostia.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXIII-p10"></a>2. You may ask what is the use of repeating all this. I will reply in the apostles words, “much every way.” <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">684</font></a>
  First, it shows that all must hail with joy the release of a soul which has trampled Satan under foot, and won for itself, at last, a crown of <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a> <a name="v.XXIII-Page_42"></a>tranquillity. Secondly, it gives me an opportunity of briefly describing her life. Thirdly, it enables me to assure you that the consul-elect, <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">685</font></a>
  that detractor of his age, <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">686</font></a>
  is now in Tartarus. <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">687</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXIII-p15"></a>Who can sufficiently eulogize our dear Leas mode of living? So complete was her conversion to the Lord that, becoming the head of a monastery, she showed herself a true mother <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">688</font></a>
  to the virgins in it, wore coarse sackcloth instead of soft raiment, passed sleepless nights in prayer, and instructed her companions even more by example than by precept. So great was her humility that she, who had once been the mistress of many, was accounted the servant of all; and certainly, the less she was reckoned an earthly mistress the more she became a servant of Christ. She was careless of her dress, neglected her hair, and ate only the coarsest food. Still, in all that she did, she avoided ostentation that she might not have her reward in this world. <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">689</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXIII-p18"></a>3. Now, therefore, in return for her short toil, Lea enjoys everlasting felicity; she is welcomed into the choirs of the angels; she is comforted in Abrahams bosom. And, as once the beggar Lazarus saw the rich man, for all his purple, lying in torment, so does Lea see the consul, not now in his triumphal robe but clothed in mourning, and asking for a drop of water from her little finger. <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">690</font></a>
  How great a change have we here! A few days ago the highest dignitaries of the city walked before him as he ascended the ramparts of the capitol like a general celebrating a triumph; the Roman people leapt up to welcome and applaud him, and at the news of his death the whole city was moved. Now he is desolate and naked, a prisoner in the foulest darkness, and not, as his unhappy wife <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">691</font></a>
  falsely asserts, set in the royal abode of the milky way. <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">692</font></a>
  On the other hand Lea, who was always shut up in her one closet, who seemed poor and of little worth, and whose life was accounted madness, <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">693</font></a>
  now follows Christ and sings, “Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of our God.” <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">694</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXIII-p24"></a>4. And now for the moral of all this, which, with tears and groans, I conjure you to remember. While we run the way of this world, we must not clothe ourselves with two coats, that is, with a twofold faith, or burthen ourselves with leathern shoes, that is, with dead works; we must not allow scrips filled with money to weigh us down, or lean upon the staff of worldly power. <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">695</font></a>
  We must not seek to possess both Christ and the world. No; things eternal must take the place of things transitory; <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">696</font></a>
  and since, physically speaking, we daily anticipate death, if we wish for immortality we must realize that we are but mortal.</p>
