 <p> <a name="vii.iv.iv"></a>
 </p><p class="c26"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p1.1"></a>Galatians.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p2"></a>The Commentary is in three books, with full Prefaces.</p>  
 <p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p3"></a>Book I., Ch. i. 1–iii. 9.</p>  
 <p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p4"></a>Addressed to Paula and Eustochium, <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p4.1"></a>a.d.</span> 387.</p>  
 <p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p5"></a>The Preface to this book begins with a striking description of the noble Roman lady Albina, which is as follows:</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p6"></a>Only a few days have elapsed since, having finished my exposition of the Epistle of Paul to Philemon, I had passed to Galatians, turning my course backwards and passing over many intervening subjects. But all at once letters unexpectedly arrived from Rome with the news that the venerable Albina has been recalled to the presence of the Lord, and that the saintly Marcella, bereft of the company of her mother, demands more than ever such solace as you can give, my dear Paula and Eustochium. This for the present is impossible on account of the great distance to be traversed by sea and land, and I could, therefore, wish to apply to the wound so suddenly inflicted at least the healing virtue of Scripture. I know full well her zeal and faith; I know how brightly the fire burns in her bosom, how she rises superior to her sex, and soars so far above human nature itself, that she crosses the Red Sea of this world, sounding the loud timbrel of the inspired volumes. Certainly, when I was at Rome, she never saw me for ever so short a time without putting some question to me respecting the Scriptures, and she did not, like the Pythagoreans, accept the “Ipse dixit” of her teacher, nor did authority, unsupported by the verdict of reason, influence her; but she tested all things, and weighed the whole matter so sagaciously that I perceived I had not a disciple so much as a judge. And so, believing that my labours would be most acceptable to her who is at a distance, and profitable for you who are with me here, I will approach a work unattempted by any writers in our language before me, and which scarcely any of the Greeks themselves have handled in a manner worthy of the dignity of the subject.</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p7"></a><a name="page_497"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 497</font></a> <a name="vii.iv.iv-Page_497"></a><i>Jerome then speaks of Victorinus, who had published a commentary on St. Paul, but “was busily engaged with secular literature and knew nothing of the Scriptures,” and of the great Greek writers, Origen, <a name="fr_5418"></a><a href="#fn_5418"><font size="1">5419</font></a>
 Didymus, and <a name="fr_5419"></a><a href="#fn_5419"><font size="1">5420</font></a>
 Appolinaris, Eusebius of Emessa, and Theodorus of Heraclea, and says he has plucked flowers out of their gardens, so that the Commentary is more theirs than his. The expository part of the Preface is chiefly remarkable as giving the view of St. Pauls rebuke of St. Peter in</i> <a name="vii.iv.iv-p9.1"></a><i>Galatians ii</i><i>., which occasioned the controversy between Jerome and Augustin. Jerome says:</i></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p10"></a>Paul does not go straight to the point, but is like a man walking in secret passages: his object is to exhibit Peter as doing what was expedient for the people of the circumcision committed to him, since, if a too sudden revolt took place from their ancient mode of life, they might be offended and not believe in the Cross; he wished, moreover, to show, inasmuch as the evangelisation of the Gentiles had been entrusted to himself that he had justice on his side in defending as true that which another only pretended was a dispensation. That wretch Porphyry <a name="fr_5420"></a><a href="#fn_5420"><font size="1">5421</font></a>
 Bataneotes by no means understood this, and, therefore, in the first book of the work which he wrote against us, he raised the objection that Peter was rebuked by Paul for not walking uprightly as an evangelical teacher. His desire was to brand the former with error and the latter with impudence, and to bring against us as a body the charge of erroneous notions and false doctrine, on the ground that the leaders of the Churches are at variance among themselves.</p>  
 <p class="c50"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p12"></a>In the Preface to Book II. Jerome describes the origin of the Galatians as a Gaulish tribe settled in Asia; but he takes them as slow of understanding, and says that the Gauls still preserve this character, just as the Roman Church preserves the character for which it was praised by St. Paul, for it still has crowds frequenting its churches and the tombs of its martyrs, and “nowhere else does the Amen resound so loudly, like spiritual thunder, and shake the temples of the idols”; and similarly the traits of the churches of Corinth and Thessalonica are still preserved; in the first, the looseness of behaviour and of doctrine, and the conceit of worldly knowledge; in the second, the love of the brethren side by side with the disorderly conduct of busybodies. And he speaks of the condition of Galatia in his own day as follows:</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p13"></a>Any one who has seen by how many schisms Ancyra, the metropolis of Galatia, is rent and torn, and by how many differences and false doctrines the place is debauched, knows this as well as I do. I say nothing of <a name="fr_5421"></a><a href="#fn_5421"><font size="1">5422</font></a>
 Cataphrygians, <a name="fr_5422"></a><a href="#fn_5422"><font size="1">5423</font></a>
 Ophites, Borborites, and Manichæans; for these are familiar names of human woe. Who ever heard of Passaloryncitæ, and <a name="fr_5423"></a><a href="#fn_5423"><font size="1">5424</font></a>
 Ascodrobi, and <a name="fr_5424"></a><a href="#fn_5424"><font size="1">5425</font></a>
 Artotyritæ, and other portents—I can hardly call them names—in any part of the Roman Empire? The traces of the ancient foolishness remain to this day. One remark I must make, and so fulfil the promise with which I started. While the Galatians, in common with the whole East, speak Greek, their own language is almost identical with that of the <a name="fr_5425"></a><a href="#fn_5425"><font size="1">5426</font></a>
 Treviri; and if through contact with the Greek they have acquired a few corruptions, it is a matter of no moment. The Africans have to some extent changed the Phenician language, and Latin itself is daily undergoing changes through differences of place and time.</p>  
 <p class="c50"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p19"></a>The Preface to Book III. opens with the following passage, describing, in contrast with his own simple exposition, the arts of the preachers of his day.</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p20"></a>We are now busily occupied with our third book on Galatians, and, my friends, Paula and Eustochium, we are well aware of our weakness, and are conscious that our slender ability flows in but a small stream and makes little roar and rattle. For these are the qualities (to such a pass have we come) which are now expected even in the Churches; the simplicity and purity of apostolic language is neglected; we meet as if we were in the <a name="fr_5426"></a><a href="#fn_5426"><font size="1">5427</font></a>
 Athenæum, or the lecture rooms, to kindle the applause of the bystanders; what is now required is a discourse painted and tricked out with spurious rhetorical skill, and which, like a strumpet in the streets, does not aim at instructing the public, but at winning their favour; like a psaltery or a sweet-sounding lute, it must soothe the ears of the audience; and the passage of the prophet Ezekiel is suitable for our times, where the Lord says to him, “Thou art become unto them as the sound of a pleasant lute which is well made, for they hear thy words but do them not.”</p>  
 <p class="c50"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p22"></a>Jerome then speaks of the composition of his commentaries as follows:</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p23"></a>How far I have profited by my unflagging study of Hebrew I leave to others to decide; <a name="page_498"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 498</font></a> <a name="vii.iv.iv-Page_498"></a>what I have lost in my own language, I can tell. In addition to this, on account of the weakness of my eyes and bodily infirmity generally, I do not write with my own hand; and I cannot make up for my slowness of utterance by greater pains and diligence, as is said to have been the case with Virgil, of whom it is related that he treated his books as a bear treats her cubs, and licked them into shape. I must summon a secretary, and either say whatever comes uppermost; or, if I wish to think a little and hope to produce something superior, my helper silently reproves me, clenches his fist, wrinkles his brow, and plainly declares by his whole bearing that he has come for nothing.</p>  
 <p class="c50"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p24"></a>He then points out how the Scriptures have dispossessed the great writers of the pre-Christian world.</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p25"></a>How few there are who now read Aristotle. How many are there who know the books, or even the name of Plato? You may find here and there a few old men, who have nothing else to do, who study them in a corner. <a name="fr_5427"></a><a href="#fn_5427"><font size="1">5428</font></a>
  But the whole world speaks the language of our Christian peasants and fishermen, the whole world re-echoes their words. And so their simple words must be set forth with simplicity of style; for the word <i>simple</i> applies to their <i>words</i>, not their meaning. But if, in response to your prayers, I could, in expounding their epistles, have the same spirit which they had when they dictated them, you would then see in the Apostles as much majesty and breadth of true wisdom as there is arrogance and vanity in the learned men of the world. To make a brief confession of the secrets of my heart, I should not like any one who wished to understand the Apostle to find a difficulty in understanding my writings, and so be compelled to find some one to interpret the interpreter.</p>
