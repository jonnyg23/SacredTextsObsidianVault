 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CX-p2"></a>Augustines answer to Letter CII. He now tries to soothe Jeromes wounded feelings, begs him to overlook the offence that he has committed, and implores him not to break off the friendly relations hitherto maintained between them. He touches on the quarrel between Jerome and Rufinus and sincerely hopes that no such breach may ever separate Jerome from himself. The tone of the letter is throughout conciliatory and is marked in places with deep feeling. More than once Augustine dwells on Jeromes words (“would that I could embrace you and that by mutual converse we might learn one from the other,” Letter CII. §2) and speaks of the comfort which they have brought to him.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CX-p3"></a>The date of the letter is 404 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CX-p3.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>
