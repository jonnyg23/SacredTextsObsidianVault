 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.XXXIX-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XXXIX-p1.1"></a>Letter XXXIX. To Paula.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXIX-p2"></a>Blæsilla died within three months of her conversion, and Jerome now writes to Paula to offer her his sympathy and, if possible, to moderate her grief. He asks her to remember that Blæsilla is now in paradise, and so far to control herself as to prevent enemies of the faith from cavilling at her conduct. Then he concludes with the prophecy (since more than fulfilled) that in his writings Blæsillas name shall never die. Written at Rome in 389 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XXXIX-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXIX-p3"></a>1. “Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears: that I might weep,” not as Jeremiah says, “For the slain of my people,” <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">789</font></a>
  nor as Jesus, for the miserable fate of Jerusalem, <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">790</font></a>
  but for holiness, mercy, innocence, chastity, and all the virtues, for all are gone now that Blæsilla is dead. For her sake I do not grieve, but for myself I must; my loss is too great to be borne with resignation. Who can recall with dry eyes the glowing faith which induced a girl of twenty to raise the standard of the Cross, and to mourn the loss of her virginity more than the death of her husband? Who can recall without a sigh the earnestness of her prayers, the brilliancy of her conversation, the tenacity of her memory, and the quickness of her intellect? Had you heard her speak Greek you would have deemed her ignorant of Latin; yet when she used the tongue of Rome her words were free from a foreign accent. She even rivalled the great Origen in those acquirements which won for him the admiration of Greece. For in a few months, or rather days, she so completely mastered the difficulties of Hebrew as to emulate her mothers zeal in learning and singing the psalms. Her attire was plain, but this plainness was not, as it often is, a mark of pride. Indeed, her self-abasement was so perfect that she dressed no better than her maids, and was only distinguished from them by the greater ease of her walk. Her steps tottered with weakness, her face was pale and quivering, her slender neck scarcely upheld her head. Still she always had in her hand a prophet or a gospel. As I think of her my eyes fill with tears, sobs impede my voice, and such is my emotion that my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth. As she lay there dying, her poor frame parched with burning fever, and her relatives gathered round her bed, her last words were: “Pray to the Lord Jesus, that He may pardon me, because what I would have done I have not been able to do.” Be at peace, dear Blæsilla, in full assurance that your garments are always white. <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">791</font></a>
  For yours is the purity of an everlasting virginity. I feel confident that my words are true: conversion can never be too late. The words to the dying robber are a pledge of this: “Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise.” <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_791"><font size="1">792</font></a>
  When at last her spirit was delivered from the burden of the flesh, and had returned to Him who gave it; <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">793</font></a>
  when, too, after her long pilgrimage, she had ascended up into her ancient heritage, her obsequies were celebrated with customary splendor. People of rank headed the procession, a pall made of cloth of gold covered her bier. But I seemed to hear a voice from heaven, saying: “I do not recognize these trappings; such is not the garb I used to wear; this magnificence is strange to me.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p9"></a>2. But what is this? I wish to check a mothers weeping, and I groan myself. I make no secret of my feelings; this entire letter is written in tears. Even Jesus wept for Lazarus because He loved him. <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">794</font></a>
  But he is a poor comforter who is overcome by his own sighs, and from whose afflicted heart tears are wrung as well as words. Dear Paula, my agony is as great as yours. Jesus knows it, whom Blæsilla now follows; the holy angels know it, whose company she now enjoys. I was her father in the spirit, her foster-father in affection. Sometimes I say: “Let the day perish wherein I was born,” <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">795</font></a>
  and again, “Woe is me, my mother, <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a> <a name="v.XXXIX-Page_50"></a>that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth.” <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">796</font></a>
  I cry: “Righteous art thou, O Lord…yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?” <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">797</font></a>
  and “as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked, and I said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most high? Behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.” <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">798</font></a>
  But again I recall other words, “If I say I will speak thus, behold I should offend against the generation of thy children.” <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">799</font></a>
  Do not great waves of doubt surge up over my soul as over yours? How comes it, I ask, that godless men live to old age in the enjoyment of this worlds riches? How comes it that untutored youth and innocent childhood are cut down while still in the bud? Why is it that children three years old or two, and even unweaned infants, are possessed with devils, covered with leprosy, and eaten up with jaundice, while godless men and profane, adulterers and murderers, have health and strength to blaspheme God? Are we not told that the unrighteousness of the father does not fall upon the son, <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">800</font></a>
  and that “the soul that sinneth it shall die?” <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">801</font></a>
  Or if the old doctrine holds good that the sins of the fathers must be visited upon the children, <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">802</font></a>
  an old mans countless sins cannot fairly be avenged upon a harmless infant. And I have said: “Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been plagued.” <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">803</font></a>
  Yet when I have thought of these things, like the prophet I have learned to say: “When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.” <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">804</font></a>
  Truly the judgments of the Lord are a great deep. <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">805</font></a>
  “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!” <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">806</font></a>
  God is good, and all that He does must be good also. Does He decree that I must lose my husband? I mourn my loss, but because it is His will I bear it with resignation. Is an only son snatched from me? The blow is hard, yet it can be borne, for He who has taken away is He who gave. <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">807</font></a>
  If I become blind a friends reading will console me. If I become deaf I shall escape from sinful words, and my thoughts shall be of God alone. And if, besides such trials as these, poverty, cold, sickness, and nakedness oppress me, I shall wait for death, and regard them as passing evils, soon to give way to a better issue. Let us reflect on the words of the sapiential psalm: “Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments.” <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">808</font></a>
  Only he can speak thus who in all his troubles magnifies the Lord, and, putting down his sufferings to his sins, thanks God for his clemency.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p25"></a>The daughters of Judah, we are told, rejoiced, because of all the judgments of the Lord. <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">809</font></a>
  Therefore, since Judah means confession, and since every believing soul confesses its faith, <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">810</font></a>
  he who claims to believe in Christ must rejoice in all Christs judgments. Am I in health? I thank my Creator. Am I sick? In this case, too, I praise Gods will. For “when I am weak, then am I strong;” and the strength of the spirit is made perfect in the weakness of the flesh. Even an apostle must bear what he dislikes, that ailment for the removal of which he besought the Lord thrice. Gods reply was: “My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">811</font></a>
  Lest he should be unduly elated by his revelations, a reminder of his human weakness was given to him, just as in the triumphal car of the victorious general there was always a slave to whisper constantly, amid the cheerings of the multitude, “Remember that thou art but man.” <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">812</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p30"></a>3. But why should that be hard to bear which we must one day ourselves endure? And why do we grieve for the dead? We are not born to live forever. Abraham, Moses, and Isaiah, Peter, James, and John, Paul, the “chosen vessel,” <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">813</font></a>
  and even the Son of God Himself have all died; and are we vexed when a soul leaves its earthly tenement? Perhaps he is taken away, “lest that wickedness should alter his understanding…for his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from the people” <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">814</font></a>
 —lest in lifes long journey he should lose his way in some trackless maze. We should indeed mourn for the dead, but only for him whom Gehenna receives, whom Tartarus devours, and for whose punishment the eternal fire burns. But we who, in departing, are accompanied by an escort of angels, and met <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a> <a name="v.XXXIX-Page_51"></a>by Christ Himself, should rather grieve that we have to tarry yet longer in this tabernacle of death. <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">815</font></a>
  For “whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.” <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">816</font></a>
  Our one longing should be that expressed by the psalmist: “Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged, that I have dwelt with them that dwell in Kedar, that my soul hath made a far pilgrimage.” <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">817</font></a>
  Kedar means darkness, and darkness stands for this present world (for, we are told, “the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not” <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">818</font></a>
 ). Therefore we should congratulate our dear Blæsilla that she has passed from darkness to light, <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">819</font></a>
  and has in the first flush of her dawning faith received the crown of her completed work. Had she been cut off (as I pray that none may be) while her thoughts were full of worldly desires and passing pleasures, then mourning would indeed have been her due, and no tears shed for her would have been too many. As it is, by the mercy of Christ she, four months ago, renewed her baptism in her vow of widowhood, and for the rest of her days spurned the world, and thought only of the religious life. Have you no fear, then, lest the Saviour may say to you: “Are you angry, Paula, that your daughter has become my daughter? Are you vexed at my decree, and do you, with rebellious tears, grudge me the possession of Blæsilla? You ought to know what my purpose is both for you and for yours. You deny yourself food, not to fast but to gratify your grief; and such abstinence is displeasing to me. Such fasts are my enemies. I receive no soul which forsakes the body against my will. A foolish philosophy may boast of martyrs of this kind; it may boast of a Zeno <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">820</font></a>
  a Cleombrotus, <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">821</font></a>
  or a Cato. <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">822</font></a>
  My spirit rests only upon him “that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word. <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">823</font></a>
  Is this the meaning of your vow to me that you would lead a religious life? Is it for this that you dress yourself differently from other matrons, and array yourself in the garb of a nun? Mourning is for those who wear silk dresses. In the midst of your tears the call will come, and you, too, must die; yet you flee from me as from a cruel judge, and fancy that you can avoid falling into my hands. Jonah, that headstrong prophet, once fled from me, yet in the depths of the sea he was still mine. <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">824</font></a>
  If you really believed your daughter to be alive, you would not grieve that she had passed to a better world. This is the commandment that I have given you through my apostle, that you sorrow not for them that sleep, even as the Gentiles, which have no hope. <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">825</font></a>
  Blush, for you are put to shame by the example of a heathen. The devils handmaid <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">826</font></a>
  is better than mine. For, while she imagines that her unbelieving husband has been translated to heaven, you either do not or will not believe that your daughter is at rest with me.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p45"></a>4. Why should I not mourn, you say? Jacob put on sackcloth for Joseph, and when all his family gathered round him, refused to be comforted. “I will go down,” he said, “into the grave unto my son mourning.” <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">827</font></a>
  David also mourned for Absalom, covering his face, and crying: “O my son, Absalom…my son, Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son!” <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">828</font></a>
  Moses, <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">829</font></a>
  too, and Aaron, <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">830</font></a>
  and the rest of the saints were mourned for with a solemn mourning. The answer to your reasoning is simple. Jacob, it is true, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain, and thought to meet only in the grave (his words were: “I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning”), but he only did so because Christ had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian cherubim. <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">831</font></a>
  (Hence in the story of Dives and Lazarus, Abraham and the beggar, though really in a place of refreshment, are described as being in hell. <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">832</font></a>
 ) And David, who, after interceding in vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, knowing that it had not sinned, did well to weep for a son who had been a parricide—in will, if not in deed. <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">833</font></a>
  And when we read that, for Moses and Aaron, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation for Stephen. <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">834</font></a>
  This great lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a> <a name="v.XXXIX-Page_52"></a>is what the Scripture says of Jacob: “Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph and his brethren”; and a few lines farther on: “And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.” Finally, “they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.” <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">835</font></a>
  This solemn lamentation does not impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the funeral ceremony. In like manner, when we read of weeping made for Moses and Aaron, <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">836</font></a>
  this is all that is meant.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p56"></a>I cannot adequately extol the mysteries of Scripture, nor sufficiently admire the spiritual meaning conveyed in its most simple words. We are told, for instance, that lamentation was made for Moses; yet when the funeral of Joshua is described <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">837</font></a>
  no mention at all is made of weeping. The reason, of course, is that under Moses—that is under the old Law—all men were bound by the sentence passed on Adams sin, and when they descended into hell <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">838</font></a>
  were rightly accompanied with tears. For, as the apostle says, “death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned.” <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">839</font></a>
  But under Jesus, <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">840</font></a>
  that is, under the Gospel of Christ, who has unlocked for us the gate of paradise, death is accompanied, not with sorrow, but with joy. The Jews go on weeping to this day; they make bare their feet, they crouch in sackcloth, they roll in ashes. And to make their superstition complete, they follow a foolish custom of the Pharisees, and eat lentils, <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">841</font></a>
  to show, it would seem, for what poor fare they have lost their birthright. <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">842</font></a>
  Of course they are right to weep, for as they do not believe in the Lords resurrection they are being made ready for the advent of antichrist. But we who have put on Christ <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">843</font></a>
  and according to the apostle are a royal and priestly race, <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">844</font></a>
  we ought not to grieve for the dead. “Moses,” the Scripture tells us, “said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people.” <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">845</font></a>
  Rend not your clothes, he says, neither mourn as pagans, lest you die. For, for us sin is death. In this same book, Leviticus, there is a provision which may perhaps strike some as cruel, yet is necessary to faith: the high priest is forbidden to approach the dead bodies of his father and mother, of his brothers and of his children; <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">846</font></a>
  to the end, that no grief may distract a soul engaged in offering sacrifice to God, and wholly devoted to the Divine mysteries. Are we not taught the same lesson in the Gospel in other words? Is not the disciple forbidden to say farewell to his home or to bury his dead father? <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">847</font></a>
  Of the high priest, again, it is said: “He shall not go out of the sanctuary, and the sanctification of his God shall not be contaminated, for the anointing oil of his God is upon him.” <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">848</font></a>
  Certainly, now that we have believed in Christ, and bear Him within us, by reason of the oil of His anointing which we have received, <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">849</font></a>
  we ought not to depart from His temple—that is, from our Christian profession—we ought not to go forth to mingle with the unbelieving Gentiles, but always to remain within, as servants obedient to the will of the Lord.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p70"></a>5. I have spoken plainly, lest you might ignorantly suppose that Scripture sanctions your grief; and that, if you err, you have reason on your side. And, so far, my words have been addressed to the average Christian woman. But now it will not be so. For in your case, as I well know, renunciation of the world has been complete; you have rejected and trampled on the delights of life, and you give yourself daily to fasting, to reading, and to prayer. Like Abraham, <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">850</font></a>
  you desire to leave your country and kindred, to forsake Mesopotamia and the Chaldæans, to enter into the promised land. Dead to the world before your death, you have spent all your mere worldly substance upon the poor, or have bestowed it upon your children. I am the more surprised, therefore, that you should act in a manner which in others would justly call for reprehension. You call to mind Blæsillas companionship, her conversation, and her endearing ways; and you cannot endure the thought that you have lost them all. I pardon you the tears of a mother, but I ask you to restrain your grief. When I think of the parent I cannot blame you for weeping: but when I think of the Christian and the recluse, the mother disappears from my view. Your wound is still fresh, and any touch of mine, however gentle, is more <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a> <a name="v.XXXIX-Page_53"></a>likely to inflame than to heal it. Yet why do you not try to overcome by reason a grief which time must inevitably assuage? Naomi, fleeing because of famine to the land of Moab, there lost her husband and her sons. Yet when she was thus deprived of her natural protectors, Ruth, a stranger, never left her side. <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">851</font></a>
  And see what a great thing it is to comfort a lonely woman! Ruth, for her reward, is made an ancestress of Christ. <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">852</font></a>
  Consider the great trials which Job endured, and you will see that you are over-delicate. Amid the ruins of his house, the pains of his sores, his countless bereavements, and, last of all, the snares laid for him by his wife, he still lifted up his eyes to heaven, and maintained his patience unbroken. I know what you are going to say: “All this befell him as a righteous man, to try his righteousness.” Well, choose which alternative you please. Either you are holy, in which case God is putting your holiness to the proof; or else you are a sinner, in which case you have no right to complain. For if so, you endure far less than your deserts.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p74"></a>Why should I repeat old stories? Listen to a modern instance. The holy Melanium, <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">853</font></a>
  eminent among Christians for her true nobility (may the Lord grant that you and I may have part with her in His day!), while the dead body of her husband was still unburied, still warm, had the misfortune to lose at one stroke two of her sons. The sequel seems incredible, but Christ is my witness that my words are true. Would you not suppose that in her frenzy she would have unbound her hair, and rent her clothes, and torn her breast? Yet not a tear fell from her eyes. Motionless she stood there; then casting herself at the feet of Christ, she smiled, as though she held Him with her hands. “Henceforth, Lord,” she said, “I will serve Thee more readily, for Thou hast freed me from a great burden.” But perhaps her remaining children overcame her determination. No, indeed; she set so little store by them that she gave up all that she had to her only son, and then, in spite of the approaching winter, took ship for Jerusalem.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p76"></a>6. Spare yourself, I beseech you, spare Blæsilla, who now reigns with Christ; at least spare Eustochium, whose tender years and inexperience depend on you for guidance and instruction. Now does the devil rage and complain that he is set at naught, because he sees one of your children exalted in triumph. The victory which he failed to win over her that is gone he hopes to obtain over her who still remains. Too great affection towards ones children is disaffection towards God. Abraham gladly prepares to slay his only son, and do you complain if one child out of several has received her crown? I cannot say what I am going to say without a groan. When you were carried fainting out of the funeral procession, whispers such as these were audible in the crowd. “Is not this what we have often said. She weeps for her daughter, killed with fasting. She wanted her to marry again, that she might have grandchildren. How long must we refrain from driving these detestable monks out of Rome? Why do we not stone them or hurl them into the Tiber? They have misled this unhappy lady; that she is not a nun from choice is clear. No heathen mother ever wept for her children as she does for Blæsilla.” What sorrow, think you, must not Christ have endured when He listened to such words as these! And how triumphantly must Satan have exulted, eager as he is to snatch your soul! Luring you with the claims of a grief which seems natural and right, and always keeping before you the image of Blæsilla, his aim is to slay the mother of the victress, and then to fall upon her forsaken sister. I do not speak thus to terrify you. The Lord is my witness that I address you now as though I were standing at His judgment seat. Tears which have no meaning are an object of abhorrence. Yours are detestable tears, sacrilegious tears, unbelieving tears; for they know no limits, and bring you to the verge of death. You shriek and cry out as though on fire within, and do your best to put an end to yourself. But to you and others like you Jesus comes in His mercy and says: “Why weepest thou? the damsel is not dead but sleepeth.” <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">854</font></a>
  The bystanders may laugh him to scorn; such unbelief is worthy of the Jews. If you prostrate yourself in grief at your daughters tomb you too will hear the chiding of the angel, “Why seek ye the living among the dead?” <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">855</font></a>
  It was because Mary Magdalene had done this that when she recognized the Lords voice calling her and fell at His feet, He said to her: “Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;” <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">856</font></a>
  that is to say, you are not worthy to touch, as risen, one whom you suppose still in the tomb.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p80"></a>7. What crosses and tortures, think you, must not our Blæsilla endure to see Christ <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a> <a name="v.XXXIX-Page_54"></a>angry with you, though it be but a little! At this moment she cries to you as you weep: “If ever you loved me, mother, if I was nourished at your breast, if I was taught by your precepts, do not grudge me my exaltation, do not so act that we shall be separated forever. Do you fancy that I am alone? In place of you I now have Mary the mother of the Lord. Here I see many whom before I have not known. My companions are infinitely better than any that I had on earth. Here I have the company of Anna, the prophetess of the Gospel; <a name="fr_856"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">857</font></a>
  and—what should kindle in you more fervent joy—I have gained in three short months what cost her the labor of many years to win. Both of us widows indeed, we have been both rewarded with the palm of chastity. Do you pity me because I have left the world behind me? It is I who should, and do, pity you who, still immured in its prison, daily fight with anger, with covetousness, with lust, with this or that temptation leading the soul to ruin. If you wish to be indeed my mother, you must please Christ. She is not my mother who displeases my Lord.” Many other things does she say which here I pass over; she prays also to God for you. For me, too, I feel sure, she makes intercession and asks God to pardon my sins in return for the warnings and advice that I bestowed on her, when to secure her salvation I braved the ill will of her family.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXIX-p82"></a>8. Therefore, so long as breath animates my body, so long as I continue in the enjoyment of life, I engage, declare, and promise that Blæsillas name shall be forever on my tongue, that my labors shall be dedicated to her honor, and that my talents shall be devoted to her praise. No page will I write in which Blæsillas name shall not occur. Wherever the records of my utterance shall find their way, thither she, too, will travel with my poor writings. Virgins, widows, monks and priests, as they read, will see how deeply her image is impressed upon my mind. Everlasting remembrance will make up for the shortness of her life. Living as she does with Christ in heaven, she will live also on the lips of men. The present will soon pass away and give place to the future, and that future will judge her without partiality and without prejudice. As a childless widow she will occupy a middle place between Paula, the mother of children, and Eustochium the virgin. In my writings she will never die. She will hear me conversing of her always, either with her sister or with her mother.</p>
