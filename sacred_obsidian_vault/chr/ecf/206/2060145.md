 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXXIV-p2"></a>Jerome acknowledges the receipt of Letters CXXXI. and CXXXII. and excuses himself from answering the questions raised in them on the twofold ground (1) that the times are evil and (2) that it is inexpedient that he should be supposed to differ from Augustine. He prays for the speedy extinction of Pelagianism, regrets that he cannot send Augustine a critical Latin text of the O.T., and concludes with a number of salutations from himself and those with him. The date of the letter is 416 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXXXIV-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> Its number in Augustines Letters is CLXXII.</p>
