 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.vi.xviii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XVIII</span>.—<i>The Emperor consulting an Oracle, the Demon gives no Response, being awed by the Nearness of Babylas the Martyr.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.vi.xviii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vi.xviii-p2.1"></a>Having</span> ordered that the pagan temples at Antioch should be opened, he was very eager to obtain an oracle from <i>Apollo of Daphne.</i> But the demon that inhabited the temple remained silent through fear of his neighbor, Babylas <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">538</font></a>
   the martyr; for the coffin which contained the body of that saint was close by. When the emperor was informed of this circumstance, he commanded that the coffin should be immediately <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a> <a name="ii.vi.xviii-Page_89"></a>removed: upon which the Christians of Antioch, including women and children, transported the coffin from Daphne to the city, with solemn rejoicings and chanting of psalms. The psalms <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">539</font></a>
   were such as cast reproach on the gods of the heathen, and those who put confidence in them and their images. </p>
