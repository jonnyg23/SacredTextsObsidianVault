 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p2.1"></a>While</span> the Church everywhere was under the sway of these eminent men, the clergy and people were excited to the imitation of their virtue and zeal. Nor was the Church of this era distinguished only by these illustrious examples of piety; for the relics of the proto-prophets, <a name="fr_1573"></a><a href="#fn_1573"><font size="1">1574</font></a>
   Habakkuk, and a little while after, Micah, were brought to light about this time. As I understand, God made known the place where both these bodies were deposited by a divine vision in a dream to Zebennus, who was then acting as bishop of the church of Eleutheropolis. The relics of Habakkuk were found at Cela, a city formerly called Ceila. The tomb of Micah was discovered at a distance of ten stadia from Cela, at a place called Berathsatia. <a name="fr_1574"></a><a href="#fn_1574"><font size="1">1575</font></a>
   This tomb was ignorantly styled by the people of the country, “the tomb of the faithful”; or, in their native language, Nephsameemana. These events, which occurred during the reign of Theodosius, were sufficient for the good repute of the Christian religion. </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p5"></a>After conquering Eugenius, <a name="fr_1575"></a><a href="#fn_1575"><font size="1">1576</font></a>
   Theodosius the emperor remained for some time at Milan, and here he was attacked with a serious malady. He recalled to mind the prediction of the monk, John, and conjectured that his sickness was unto death. He sent in haste for his son Honorius from Constantinople; and on seeing him by, he seemed to be easier, so that he was able to be present at the sports of the Hippodrome. After dinner, however, he suddenly grew worse, and sent to desire his son to preside at the spectacle. He died on the following night. This event happened during the consulate of the brothers Olybrius and Probianus. <a name="fr_1576"></a><a href="#fn_1576"><font size="1">1577</font></a>
