 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.iv.xi-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XI</span>.—<i>Of the Bishop Paphnutius.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.iv.xi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xi-p2.1"></a>As</span> we have promised above <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">195</font></a>
   to make some mention of Paphnutius and Spyridon, it is time to speak of them here. Paphnutius then was bishop of one of the cities in Upper Thebes: he was a man so favored divinely that extraordinary miracles were done by him. In the time of the persecution he had been deprived of one of his eyes. The emperor honored this man exceedingly, and often sent for him to the palace, and kissed the part where the eye had been torn out. So great devoutness characterized the emperor Constantine. Let this single fact respecting Paphnutius suffice: I shall now explain another thing which came to pass in consequence of his advice, both for the good of the Church and the honor of the clergy. It seemed fit to the bishops to introduce a new law into the Church, that those who were in holy orders, I speak of bishops, presbyters, and deacons, should have no conjugal intercourse with the wives whom they had married while still laymen. <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">196</font></a>
   Now when discussion on this matter was impending, Paphnutius having arisen in the midst of the assembly of bishops, earnestly entreated them not to impose so heavy a yoke on the ministers of religion: asserting that marriage itself is honorable, and the bed undefiled; <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">197</font></a>
   urging before God that they ought not to injure the Church by too stringent restrictions. For all men, said he, cannot bear the practice of rigid continence; neither perhaps would the chastity of the wife of each be preserved: and he termed the intercourse of a man with his lawful wife chastity. It would be sufficient, he thought, that such as had previously entered on their sacred calling should abjure matrimony, according to the ancient tradition of the Church: but that none should be separated from her to whom, while yet unordained, he had been united. And these sentiments he expressed, although himself without experience of marriage, and, to speak plainly, without ever having known a woman: for from a boy he had been brought up in a monastery, <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">198</font></a>
   and was specially renowned above all men for his chastity. The whole assembly of the clergy assented to the reasoning of Paphnutius: wherefore they silenced all further debate on this point, leaving it to the discretion of those who were husbands to exercise abstinence if they so wished in reference to their wives. Thus much concerning Paphnutius. </p>
