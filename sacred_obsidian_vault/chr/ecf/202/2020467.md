 </p><p class="c32"><a name="iii.xii.x-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xii.x-p1.1"></a>Chapter X</span>.—<i>Concerning Martyrius of Cilicia. Translation of the Remains of St. Paul the Confessor, and of Meletius, Bishop of Antioch</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.xii.x-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xii.x-p2.1"></a>Nectarius</span> made himself acquainted with the routine of sacerdotal ceremonies under the instruction of Cyriacus, <a name="fr_1533"></a><a href="#fn_1533"><font size="1">1534</font></a>
   bishop of Adana, whom he had requested Diodorus, bishop of Tarsus, to leave with him for a short period. Nectarius also retained several other Cilicians with him, amongst whom was Martyrius, his physician, who had been a witness of the irregularities of his youth. Nectarius was desirous of ordaining him deacon; but Martyrius refused the honor under the plea of his own unworthiness of such a divine service, and called upon Nectarius himself to witness as to the course of his past life. To this Nectarius replied as follows: “Although I am now a priest, do you not know that my past career was a more guilty one than yours, inasmuch as you were but an instrument in my numerous profligacies?” “But you, O blessed one,” replied Martyrius, “were cleansed by baptism, and were then accounted worthy of the priesthood. Both these ordinances are appointed by the Divine law for purification from sin, and it seems to me that you now differ in no respect from a new-born infant; but I long ago received holy baptism, and have since continued in the same abusive course.” It was under this plea that he excused himself from receiving ordination; and I commend the man for his refusal, and therefore would give him a part in my history. </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.xii.x-p4"></a>The Emperor Theodosius, on being informed of various events connected with Paul, <a name="fr_1534"></a><a href="#fn_1534"><font size="1">1535</font></a>
   formerly bishop of Constantinople, caused his body to be removed to the church erected by Macedonius, his enemy, and buried there. This temple is a spacious and most distinguished edifice, and is still named after Paul. Hence many persons who are ignorant of the facts of the case, particularly women and the mass of the people, imagine that Paul, the apostle, is interred therein. The remains of Meletius were at the same time conveyed to Antioch, and deposited near the tomb of Babylas the martyr. It is said that through every public way, by the command of the emperor, the relics were received within the walls in every city, contrary to Roman custom, and were honored with singing of psalms antiphonally in such places, until they were transferred to Antioch. </p>
