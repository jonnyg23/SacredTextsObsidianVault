 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.x.xlv-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xlv-p1.1"></a>Chapter XLV</span>.—<i>The Body of John Chrysostom transferred to Constantinople, and placed in the Church of the Apostles by the Emperor at the Instigation of Proclus.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xlv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xlv-p2.1"></a>Not</span> long after this, Proclus the bishop brought back to the Church those who had separated themselves from it on account of Bishop Johns deposition, he having soothed the irritation by a prudent expedient. What this was we must now recount. Having obtained the emperors permission, he removed the body of John from Comana, where it was buried, to Constantinople, in the thirty-fifth year after his deposition. And when he had carried it in solemn procession through the city, he deposited it with much honor in the church termed <i>The Apostles.</i> By this means the admirers of that prelate were conciliated, and again associated in communion with the [catholic] Church. This happened on the 27th of January, in the sixteenth consulate of the Emperor Theodosius. <a name="fr_1035"></a><a href="#fn_1035"><font size="1">1036</font></a>
   But it astonishes me that envy, which has been vented against Origen since his death, has spared John. For the former was excommunicated by Theophilus about two hundred years after his decease; while the latter was restored to communion by Proclus in the thirty-fifth year after his death! So different was Proclus from Theophilus. And men of observation and intelligence cannot be deceived in reference to how these things were done and are continually being done. </p>
