 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.v.xliii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.v.xliii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XLIII</span>.—<i>Of Eustathius Bishop of Sebastia.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.v.xliii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.v.xliii-p2.1"></a>But</span> Eustathius bishop of Sebastia in Armenia was not even permitted to make his defense; because he had been long before deposed by Eulalius, his own father, who was bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, for dressing in a style unbecoming the sacerdotal office. <a name="fr_439"></a><a href="#fn_439"><font size="1">440</font></a>
   Let it be noted that Meletius was appointed his successor, of whom we shall hereafter speak. Eustathius indeed was subsequently condemned by a Synod convened on his account at Gangra in Paphlagonia; he having, after his deposition by the council at Cæsarea, done many things repugnant to the ecclesiastical canons. For he had forbidden marriage, <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_440"><font size="1">441</font></a>
   and maintained that meats were to be abstained from: he even separated many from their wives, and persuaded those who disliked to assemble in the churches to commune at home. Under the pretext of piety, he also seduced servants from their masters. He himself wore the habit of a philosopher, and induced his followers to adopt a new and extraordinary garb, directing that the hair of women should be cropped. He permitted the prescribed fasts to be neglected, but recommended fasting on Sundays. In short, he forbade prayers to be offered in the houses of married persons: and declared that both the benediction and the communion of a presbyter who continued to live with a wife whom he might have lawfully married, while still a layman, ought to be shunned as an abomination. For doing and teaching these things and many others of a similar nature, a Synod convened, as we have said, at Gangra <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">442</font></a>
   in Paphlagonia de<a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a> <a name="ii.v.xliii-Page_73"></a>posed him, and anathematized his opinions. This, however, was done afterwards. But on Macedonius being ejected from the see of Constantinople, Eudoxius, who now looked upon the see of Antioch as secondary in importance, was promoted to the vacant bishopric; being consecrated by the Acacians, who in this instance cared not to consider that it was inconsistent with their former proceedings. For they who had deposed Dracontius because of his translation from Galatia to Pergamos, were clearly acting in contrariety to their own principles and decisions, in ordaining Eudoxius, who then made a second change. After this they sent their own exposition of the faith, in its corrected and supplementary form, to Arminium, ordering that all those who refused to sign it should be exiled on the authority of the emperors edict. They also informed such other prelates in the East as coincided with them in opinion of what they had done; and more especially Patrophilus bishop of Scythopolis, who on leaving Seleucia had proceeded directly to his own city. Eudoxius having been constituted bishop of the imperial city, the great church named <i>Sophia</i> was at that time consecrated, <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">443</font></a>
   in the tenth consulate <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">444</font></a>
   of Constantius, and the third of Julian Cæsar, on the 15th day of February. It was while Eudoxius occupied this see, that he first uttered that sentence which is still everywhere current, The Father is impious, the Son is pious. When the people seemed startled by this expression, and a disturbance began to be made, Be not troubled, said he, on account of what I have just said: for the Father is impious, because he worships no person; but the Son is pious because he worships the Father. Eudoxius having said this, the tumult was appeased, and great laughter was excited in the church: and this saying of his continues to be a jest, even in the present day. The heresiarchs indeed frequently devised such subtle phrases as these, and by them rent the church asunder. Thus was the Synod at Constantinople terminated. </p>

Almost all the canons of the synod seem to be addressed against the teachings of Eustathius. The fourth canon is expressly on the celibacy of the clergy, as follows: If any one maintains that, when a married priest offer the sacrifice, no one should take part in the service, let him be anathema.</p>
