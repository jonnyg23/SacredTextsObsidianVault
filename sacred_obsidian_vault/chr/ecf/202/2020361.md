Restoration of the Other Eastern Bishops to their own Sees. Ejection of Macedonius again; and Accession of Paul to the See</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.viii.xxiv-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.xxiv-p2.1"></a>The</span> bishops, Ursacius and Valens, to Athanasius, our brother in the Lord. <a name="fr_1279"></a><a href="#fn_1279"><font size="1">1280</font></a>
   </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.viii.xxiv-p4"></a>“We take the opportunity of the departure of Museus, our brother and fellow-presbyter, who is going to your esteemed self, O beloved brother, to send you amplest greeting from Aquileia through him, and hope that our letter will find you in good health. You will afford us great encouragement if you will write us a reply to this letter. Know that we are at peace and in ecclesiastical communion with you.”</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.viii.xxiv-p5"></a>Athanasius therefore returned under such circumstances from the West to Egypt. Paul, Marcellus, Asclepas, and Lucius, whom the edict of the emperor had returned from exile, received their own sees. Immediately on the return of Paul to Constantinople Macedonius retired, and held church in private. There was a great tumult at Ancyra on the deposition of Basil from the church there, and the reinstallation of Marcellus. The other bishops were reinstated in their churches without difficulty. <a name="fr_1280"></a><a href="#fn_1280"><font size="1">1281</font></a>
