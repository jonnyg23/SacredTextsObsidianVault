 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.iv.iv-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.iv-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV</span>.—<i>War arises between Constantine and Licinius on Account of the Christians.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.iv.iv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.iv-p2.1"></a>By</span> this course he drew upon himself the emperor Constantines heaviest displeasure; and they became enemies, the pretended treaty of friendship between them having been violated. Not long afterwards they took up arms against each other as declared enemies. And after several engagements both by sea and land, Licinius was at last utterly defeated near Chrysopolis in Bithynia, a port of the Chalcedonians, and surrendered himself to Constantine. Accordingly he having taken him alive, treated him with the utmost humanity, and would by no means put him to death, but ordered him to <a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.iv-Page_3"></a>take up his abode and live in tranquillity at Thessalonica. He having, however, remained quiet a short time, managed afterwards to collect some barbarian mercenaries and made an effort to repair his late disaster by a fresh appeal to arms. The emperor being made acquainted with his proceedings, directed that he should be slain, which was carried into effect. Constantine thus became possessed of the sole dominion, and was accordingly proclaimed sovereign Autocrat, <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">118</font></a>
   and again sought to promote the welfare of Christians. This he did in a variety of ways, and Christianity enjoyed unbroken peace by reason of his efforts. But an internal dissension soon succeeded this state of repose, the nature and origin of which I shall now endeavor to describe. </p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.iv.iv-p3"></a>After a victory the soldiers greeted their prince with acclamations of Emperor! Augustus! So also did the citizens on his triumphal entry into the city. So it appears Constantine was formally greeted on assuming the sole control of affairs.</p>
