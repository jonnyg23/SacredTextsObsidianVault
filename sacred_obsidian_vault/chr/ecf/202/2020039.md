 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.iv.xxx-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xxx-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXX</span>.—<i>Athanasius is found Innocent of what he was accused; his Accusers take to Flight.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.iv.xxx-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xxx-p2.1"></a>Matters</span> having been brought to this issue with regard to Arsenius, the contrivers of this imposture were reduced to perplexity; and Achab, <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">246</font></a>
   who was also called John, one of the principal accusers, having slipped out of court in the tumult, effected his escape. Thus Athanasius cleared himself from this charge, without having recourse to any pleading; <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">247</font></a>
   for he was confident that the sight only of Arsenius alive would confound his calumniators. </p>
