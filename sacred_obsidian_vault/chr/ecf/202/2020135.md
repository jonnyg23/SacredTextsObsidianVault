   a son was born to Valentinian, the emperor in the Western parts, to whom the same name as his fathers was given. For Gratian had been born previously to his becoming emperor. </p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.vii.x-p3"></a>Sozomen (VI. 10) says the same. There were two Valentinians in the second generation; one a son of Valens, and another the son of Valentinian the Elder. According to Idatius <i>Fasti,</i> it was the former that was born during the consulate of Gratian and Dagalaifus; so that Socrates was in error here, confusing perhaps the two younger Valentinians. Valesius adduces other reasons proving the same, which it is unnecessary to repeat here.</p>
