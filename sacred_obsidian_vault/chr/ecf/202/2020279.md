 </p><p class="c32"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></a>Chapter III</span>.—<i>By the Vision of the Cross, and by the Appearance of Christ, Constantine is led to embrace Christianity.—He receives Religious Instruction from our Brethren.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p2.1"></a>We</span> have been informed that Constantine was led to honor the Christian religion by the concurrence of several different events, particularly by the appearance of a sign from heaven.</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p3"></a>When he first formed the resolution of entering into a war against Maxentius, he was beset with doubts as to the means of carrying on his military operations, and as to the quarter whence he could look for assistance. In the midst of his perplexity, he saw, in a vision, the sight of the cross <a name="fr_1070"></a><a href="#fn_1070"><font size="1">1071</font></a>
   shining in heaven. He was amazed at the spectacle, but some holy angels who were standing by, exclaimed, “Oh, Constantine! by this symbol, conquer!” And it is said that Christ himself appeared to him, and showed him the symbol of the cross, and commanded him to construct one like unto it, and to retain it as his help in battle, as it would insure the victory. </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p5"></a>Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, <a name="fr_1071"></a><a href="#fn_1071"><font size="1">1072</font></a>
   affirms that he heard the emperor declare with an oath, as the sun was on the point of inclining about the middle of the day, he and the soldiers who were with him saw in heaven the trophy of the cross <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a> <a name="iii.vi.iii-Page_242"></a>composed of light, and encircled by the following words: “By this sign, conquer.” </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p7"></a>This vision met him by the way, when he was perplexed as to whither he should lead his army. While he was reflecting on what this could mean, night came; and when he fell asleep, Christ appeared <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">1073</font></a>
   with the sign which he had seen in heaven, and commanded him to construct a representation of the symbol, and to use it as his help in hostile encounters. There was nothing further to be elucidated; for the emperor clearly apprehended the necessity of serving God. </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p9"></a>At daybreak, <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">1074</font></a>
   he called together the priests of Christ, and questioned them concerning their doctrines. They opened the sacred Scriptures, and expounded the truths relative to Christ, and showed him from the prophets, how the signs which had been predicted, had been fulfilled. The sign which had appeared to him was the symbol, they said, of the victory over hell; for Christ came among men, was stretched upon the cross, died, and returned to life the third day. On this account, they said, there was hope that at the close of the present dispensation, there would be a general resurrection of the dead, and entrance upon immortality, when those who had led a good life would receive accordingly, and those who had done evil would be punished. Yet, continued they, the means of salvation and of purification from sin are provided; namely, for the uninitiated, <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">1075</font></a>
   initiation according to the canons of the church; and for the initiated, abstinence from renewed sin. But as few, even among holy men, are capable of complying with this latter condition, another method of purification is set forth, namely, repentance; for God, in his love towards man, bestows forgiveness on those who have fallen into sin, on their repentance, and the confirmation of their repentance by good works. </p>
