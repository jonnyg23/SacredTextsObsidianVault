When this was made known, the Emperor Constantius was affected most painfully; he was therefore baptized by Euzoïus, and immediately prepared to undertake an expedition against Julian.

Constantius had lived forty-five years, having reigned thirty-eight years; thirteen of which he was his fathers colleague in the empire, and after his fathers death for twenty-five years [sole emperor], the history of which latter period is contained in this book. </p>
