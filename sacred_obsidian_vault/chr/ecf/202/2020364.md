 </p><p class="c32"><a name="iii.ix.ii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.ix.ii-p1.1"></a>Chapter II</span>.—<i>Constantius again ejects Athanasius, and banishes those who represented the Homoousian Doctrine. Death of Paul, Bishop of Constantinople. Macedonius: his Second Usurpation of the See, and his Evil Deeds</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.ix.ii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.ix.ii-p2.1"></a>The</span> emperor, <a name="fr_1284"></a><a href="#fn_1284"><font size="1">1285</font></a>
   deceived by the calumnies of the heterodox, changed his mind, and, in opposition to the decrees of the council of Sardica, exiled the bishops whom he had previously restored. Marcellus was again deposed, and Basil re-acquired possession of the bishopric of Ancyra. Lucius was thrown into prison, and died there. Paul was condemned to perpetual banishment, and was conveyed to Cucusum, in Armenia, where he died. I have never, however, been able to ascertain whether or not he died a natural death. It is still reported, that he was strangled by the adherents of Macedonius. <a name="fr_1285"></a><a href="#fn_1285"><font size="1">1286</font></a>
   As soon as he was sent into exile, Macedonius seized the government of his church; and, being aided by several orders of monks whom he had incorporated at Constantinople, and by alliances with many of the neighboring bishops, he commenced, it is said, a persecution against those who held the sentiments of Paul. He ejected them, in the first place, from the church, and then compelled them to enter into communion with himself. Many perished from wounds received in the struggle; some were deprived of their possessions; some, of the rights of citizenship; and others were branded on the forehead with an iron instrument, in order that they might be stamped as infamous. The emperor was displeased when he heard of these transactions, and imputed the blame of them to Macedonius and his adherents. </p>
