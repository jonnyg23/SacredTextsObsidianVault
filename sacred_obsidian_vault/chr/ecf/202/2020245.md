 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.x.xxviii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xxviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—<i>Proclus ordained Bishop of Cyzicus by Sisinnius, but rejected by the People.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xxviii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xxviii-p2.1"></a>The</span> bishop of Cyzicus having died, Sisinnius ordained Proclus to the bishopric of that city. But while he was preparing to depart thither, the inhabitants anticipated him, by electing an ascetic named Dalmatius. This they did in disregard of a law which forbade their ordination of a bishop without the sanction of the bishop of Constantinople; <a name="fr_990"></a><a href="#fn_990"><font size="1">991</font></a>
   but they pretended that <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a> <a name="ii.x.xxviii-Page_169"></a>this was a special privilege granted to Atticus personally. Proclus therefore continued destitute of the presidency over his own church, but acquired celebrity for his discourses in the churches of Constantinople. We shall however speak of him more particularly in an appropriate place. Sisinnius having survived his appointment to the bishopric by barely two entire years, was removed by death on the 24th of December, in the consulate of Hierius and Ardaburius. <a name="fr_991"></a><a href="#fn_991"><font size="1">992</font></a>
   For his temperance, integrity of life, and benignity to the poor, he was deservedly eminent; he was moreover singularly affable and guileless in disposition, and this rendered him rather averse to business, so that by men of active habits he was accounted indolent. </p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.x.xxviii-p3"></a>The Council in its 6th Canon declared that no one should be ordained bishop without the consent of his metropolitan; but that the bishop of Constantinople was the metropolitan of the Cyzicenes does not appear unless the decree of the (Canon 3d) Council of Constantinople making the latter a patriarchate is to be understood as rendering the see of Cyzicus subordinate to that of Constantinople, as an individual church is to the metropolitan. Cf. Bingham, <i>Christ. Antiq.</i> II. 16. 12.</p>
