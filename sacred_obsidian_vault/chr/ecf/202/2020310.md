 </p><p class="c32"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p1.1"></a>Chapter VIII</span>.—<i>How the Armenians and Persians embraced Christianity</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p2.1"></a>Subsequently</span> the Christian religion became known to the neighboring tribes and was very greatly disseminated. <a name="fr_1154"></a><a href="#fn_1154"><font size="1">1155</font></a>
   The Armenians, I have understood, were the first to embrace Christianity. <a name="fr_1155"></a><a href="#fn_1155"><font size="1">1156</font></a>
   It is said that Tiridates, then the sovereign of that nation, became a Christian by means of a marvelous Divine sign which was wrought in his own house; and that he issued commands to all the subjects, by a herald, to adopt the same religion. <a name="fr_1156"></a><a href="#fn_1156"><font size="1">1157</font></a>
   I think that the beginning of the conversion of the Persians <a name="fr_1157"></a><a href="#fn_1157"><font size="1">1158</font></a>
   was owing to their intercourse with the Osroenians and Armenians; for it is likely that they would converse with such Divine men and make experience of their virtue. </p>
