 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.x.xlvii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xlvii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XLVII</span>.—<i>The Empress Eudocia goes to Jerusalem; sent there by the Emperor Theodosius.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xlvii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xlvii-p2.1"></a>Moreover</span> the Emperor Theodosius offered up thanksgivings to God for the blessings which had been conferred upon him; at the same time reverencing Christ with the most special honors. He also sent his wife Eudocia to Jerusalem, <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1038"><font size="1">1039</font></a>
   she having bound herself by a vow to go thither, should she live to see the marriage of her daughter. The empress therefore, on her visit to the sacred city, adorned its churches with the most costly gifts; and both then, and after her return, decorated all the churches in the other cities of the East with a variety of ornaments. </p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.x.xlvii-p3"></a>On this visit of the empress to Jerusalem, see Evagrius, <i>H. E.</i> I. 20–23. During this visit for some reason or other—variously stated by the authors of the period—an alienation occurred between the emperor and Eudocia. See above, chap. 21, note 2.</p>
