 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.vii.xxix-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vii.xxix-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXIX</span>.—<i>Damasus ordained Bishop of Rome. Sedition and Loss of Life caused by the Rivalry of Ursinus.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.vii.xxix-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vii.xxix-p2.1"></a>While</span> the emperor Valentinian governed in peace, and interfered with no sect, Damasus after Liberius undertook the administration of the bishopric at Rome; <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">658</font></a>
   whereupon a great disturbance was caused on the following account. <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">659</font></a>
   A certain Ursinus, a deacon of that church, had been nominated among others when the election of a bishop took place; as Damasus <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">660</font></a>
   was preferred, this Ursinus, unable to bear the disappointment of his hopes, held schismatic assemblies apart from the church, and even induced certain bishops of little distinction to ordain him in secret. This ordination was made, not in a church, <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">661</font></a>
   but in a retired place called the Palace of Sicine, whereupon dissension arose among the people; their disagreement being not about any article of faith or heresy, but simply as to who should be bishop. Hence frequent conflicts arose, insomuch that many lives were sacrificed in this contention; and many of the clergy as well as laity were punished on that account by Maximin, the prefect of the city. Thus was Ursinus obliged to desist from his pretensions at that time, and those who were minded to follow him were reduced to order. </p>
