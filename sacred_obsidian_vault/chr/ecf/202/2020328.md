 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.vii.xxvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vii.xxvi-p2.1"></a>The</span> temple, <a name="fr_1191"></a><a href="#fn_1191"><font size="1">1192</font></a>
   called the “Great Martyrium,” which was built in the place of the skull at Jerusalem, was completed about the thirtieth year <a name="fr_1192"></a><a href="#fn_1192"><font size="1">1193</font></a>
   of the reign of Constantine; and Marianus, an official, who was a short-hand writer of the emperor, came to Tyre and delivered a letter from the emperor to the council, commanding them to repair quickly to Jerusalem, in order to consecrate the temple. Although this had been previously determined upon, yet the emperor deemed it necessary that the disputes which prevailed among the bishops who had been convened at Tyre should be first adjusted, and that they should be purged of all discord and grief before going to the consecration of the temple. For it is fitting to such a festival for the priests to be like-minded. When the bishops arrived at Jerusalem, the temple was therefore consecrated, as likewise numerous ornaments and gifts, which were sent by the emperor and are still preserved in the sacred edifice; their costliness and magnificence is such that they cannot be looked upon without exciting wonder. Since that period the anniversary of the consecration has been celebrated with great pomp by the church of Jerusalem; <a name="fr_1193"></a><a href="#fn_1193"><font size="1">1194</font></a>
   the festival continues eight days, initiation by baptism is administered, and people from every <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a> <a name="iii.vii.xxvi-Page_277"></a>region under the sun resort to Jerusalem during this festival, and visit the sacred places. </p>
