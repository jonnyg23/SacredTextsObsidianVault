 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.vi.xxiv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.xxiv-p2.1"></a>After</span> an investigation had been made into the conduct of Melitius when in Egypt, the Synod sentenced him to reside in Lycus, <a name="fr_1134"></a><a href="#fn_1134"><font size="1">1135</font></a>
   and to retain only the name of bishop; and prohibited him from ordaining any one either in a city or a village. Those who had previously been ordained by him, were permitted by this law, to remain in communion and in the ministry, but were to be accounted secondary in point of dignity to the clergy in church and parish. <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1135"><font size="1">1136</font></a>
   When by death an appointment became vacant, they were allowed to succeed to it, if deemed worthy, by the vote of the multitude, but in this case, were to be ordained by the bishop of the Church of Alexandria, for they were interdicted from exercising any power or influence in elections. This regulation appeared just to the Synod, <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> <a name="iii.vi.xxiv-Page_257"></a>for Melitius <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1136"><font size="1">1137</font></a>
   and his followers had manifested great rashness and temerity in administering ordination; so that it also deprived the ordinations which differed from those of Peter of all consideration. He, when he conducted the Alexandrian Church, fled on account of the persecution then raging, but afterwards suffered martyrdom. </p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.xxiv-p3"></a>Lycus (Lycopolis) is not named in the letter of the Synod which says simply that he should reside in his own city. Soz. took the fact from Athan. <i>Apol. cont. Arian.</i> 71, where Melitius, in the brief to Alexander, calls himself bishop of Lycus. This is a proof of our historians use of the same documents to amplify the statements of Socrates.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.xxiv-p5"></a>The best text reads Melitius, not Meletius, so Athanas. and Soc.; usually the books write Meletius and Meletians. We follow the reading.</p>
