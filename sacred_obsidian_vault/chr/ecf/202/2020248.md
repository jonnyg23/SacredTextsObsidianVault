 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xxxi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xxxi-p2.1"></a>Nestorius</span> indeed acted contrary to the usage of the Church, and caused himself to be hated in other ways also, <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_1000"><font size="1">1001</font></a>
   as is evident from what happened during his episcopate. For Anthony bishop of Germa, a city of the Hellespont, actuated by the example of Nestorius in his intolerance of heretics, began to persecute the Macedonians, under the pretext of carrying out the intentions of the patriarch. The Macedonians for some time endured his annoyance; but when Anthony proceeded to farther extremities, unable any longer to bear his harsh treatment, they were led to a sad desperation, and suborning two men, who put right in a secondary place and profit first, they assassinated their tormenter. When the Macedonians had perpetrated this crime, Nestorius took occasion from it to increase his violence of conduct against them, and prevailed on the emperor to take away their churches. They were therefore deprived of not only those which they possessed at Constantinople, before the old walls of the imperial city, but of those also which they had at Cyzicus, and many others that belonged to them in the rural districts of the Hellespont. Many of them therefore at that time came over to the Catholic church, and professed the homoousian faith. But as the proverb says, drunkards never want wine, nor the contentious strife: and so it fell out with regard to Nestorius, who after having exerted himself to expel others from the church, was himself ejected on the following account. </p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.x.xxxi-p3"></a>By a slight change in the Greek text Valesius renders this phrase but caused others also to imitate him, alleging that the conduct of Anthony of Germa was in imitation of Nestorius; but the emendation seems unnecessary. Socrates means that Nestorius made himself odious in other ways, perhaps through other persons such as Anthony, &amp;c.</p>
