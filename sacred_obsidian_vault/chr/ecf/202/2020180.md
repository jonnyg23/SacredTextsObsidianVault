 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.viii.xvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.viii.xvi-p2.1"></a>About</span> the same period, the following events took place at Antioch in Syria. After the death of Paulinus, the people who had been under his superintendence refused to submit to the authority of Flavian, but caused Evagrius to be ordained bishop of their own party. <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">735</font></a>
   As he did not survive his ordination long, no other was constituted in his place, Flavian having brought this about: nevertheless those who disliked Flavian on account of his having violated his oath, held their assemblies apart. <a name="fr_735"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">736</font></a>
   Meanwhile Flavian left no stone unturned, as the phrase is, to bring these also under his control; and this he soon after effected, when he appeased the anger of Theophilus, then bishop of Alex<a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 126</font></a> <a name="ii.viii.xvi-Page_126"></a>andria, by whose mediation he conciliated, Damasus bishop of Rome also. For both these had been greatly displeased with Flavian, as well for the perjury of which he had been guilty, as for the schism he had occasioned among the previously united people. Theophilus therefore being pacified, sent Isidore a presbyter to Rome, and thus reconciled Damasus, who was still offended; representing to him the propriety of overlooking Flavians past misconduct, for the sake of producing concord among the people. Communion being in this way restored to Flavian, the people of Antioch were in the course of a little while induced to acquiesce in the union secured. Such was the conclusion of this affair at Antioch. But the Arians of that city being ejected from the churches, were accustomed to hold their meetings in the suburbs. Meanwhile Cyril bishop of Jerusalem having died about this time, <a name="fr_736"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">737</font></a>
   was succeeded by John. </p>

E.</i> V. 23) says that there was a double violation of order in the ordination of Evagrius; first in that he was ordained by his predecessor, and secondly in that he was ordained by one bishop, whereas the canon required that not less than three should take part in an episcopal ordination.</p>
