 </p><p class="c32"><a name="iii.vi.xx-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.xx-p1.1"></a>Chapter XX</span>.—<i>After having given Audience to both Parties, the Emperor condemned the Followers of Arius and banished them</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.vi.xx-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.xx-p2.1"></a>The</span> next debate by the priests turned upon doctrine. <a name="fr_1122"></a><a href="#fn_1122"><font size="1">1123</font></a>
   The emperor gave patient attention to the speeches of both parties; he applauded those who spoke well, rebuked those who displayed a tendency to altercation, and according to his apprehension of what he heard, for he was not wholly unpracticed in the Greek tongue, he addressed himself with kindness to each one. Finally all the priests agreed with one another and conceded that the Son is consubstantial with the Father. At the commencement of the conference there were but seventeen who praised the opinion of Arius, but eventually the majority of these yielded assent to the general view. To this judgment the emperor likewise deferred, for he regarded the unanimity of the conference to be a divine approbation; and he ordained that any one who should be rebellious thereto, should forthwith be sent into banishment, as guilty of endeavoring to overthrow the Divine definitions. I had thought it necessary to reproduce the very document concerning the matter, as an example of the truth, in order that posterity might possess in a fixed and clear form the symbol of the faith which proved pacificatory at the time but since some pious friends, who understood such matters, recommended that these truths ought to be spoken of and heard by the initiated and their initiators <a name="fr_1123"></a><a href="#fn_1123"><font size="1">1124</font></a>
   only, I agreed with their council; for it is not unlikely that some of the uninitiated may read this book. While I have concealed such of the prohibited material as I ought to keep silent about, I have not altogether left the reader ignorant of the opinions held by the synod. </p>
