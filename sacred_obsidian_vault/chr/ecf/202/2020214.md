 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.ix.xxii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.ix.xxii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXI</span>.—<i>John dies in Exile.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.ix.xxii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.ix.xxii-p2.1"></a>John</span> taken into exile died in Comana on the Euxine, on the 14th of September, in the following <a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a> <a name="ii.ix.xxii-Page_152"></a>consulate, which was the seventh of Honorius, and the second of Theodosius. <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">893</font></a>
   A man, as we have before observed, <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">894</font></a>
   who on account of zeal for temperance was inclined rather to anger than forbearance: and his personal sanctity of character led him to indulge in a latitude of speech which to others was intolerable. Indeed, it is most inexplicable to me, how with a zeal so ardent for the practice of self-control and blamelessness of life, he should in his sermons appear to teach a loose view of temperance. For whereas by the Synod of bishops repentance was accepted but once from those who had sinned after baptism; he did not scruple to say, Approach, although you may have repented a thousand times. <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">895</font></a>
   For this doctrine, many even of his friends censured him, but especially Sisinnius bishop of the Novatian; who wrote a book condemnatory of the above quoted expression of Chrysostoms, and severely rebuked him for it. But this occurred long before. <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">896</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.ix.xxii-p5"></a>These words are not found in any of Chrysostoms extant homilies. There is no reason, however, for thinking that they were not uttered by him in a sermon now not in existence. Socrates remarks on Chrysostoms attitude made here are among the considerations which have led some to think that he was a Novatian. Cf. Introd. p. x.</p>
