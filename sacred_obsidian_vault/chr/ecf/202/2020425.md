 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.xi.ix-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xi.ix-p2.1"></a>The</span> Christians who represented the Nicene doctrines and the followers of the Novatian views <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1443</font></a>
   were treated with equal severity in the city of Constantinople. </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.xi.ix-p4"></a>They were all ultimately expelled from the city; and the churches of the Novatians were closed by order of the emperor. The other party had no churches to be closed, having been <a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a> <a name="iii.xi.ix-Page_352"></a>deprived of them all during the reign of Constantius.</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="iii.xi.ix-p5"></a>At this period, Agelius who, from the time of Constantius, had governed the church of the Novatians at Constantinople, was condemned to banishment. It is said that he was especially remarkable for his course of life according to the ecclesiastical laws. With respect to his mode of life, he had attained to the highest degree of philosophy, namely, freedom from worldly possessions; this was evidenced by his daily conduct; he had but one tunic, and always walked barefooted. Not long after his banishment, he was recalled, received the churches under him, and boldly convened churches through the influence of Marcian, a man of extraordinary virtue and eloquence, who had formerly been enrolled among the troops of the palace, but at this period was a presbyter of the Novatian heresy, and the teacher of grammar to Anastasia and Carosa, <a name="fr_1443"></a><a href="#fn_1443"><font size="1">1444</font></a>
   the daughters of the emperor. There are still baths at Constantinople which bear the names of these princesses. It was for the sake of Marcian alone that the privilege above-mentioned was conceded to the Novatians. </p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.ix-p6"></a>According to Am. Marcel. xxvi. 6, 14, the Anastasian baths were so called after a sister of Constantine. But Soz. supposes that there were baths in his day named after the sisters, not the one, but both. Soc. says only Anastasia. Cf. Idatius, <i>Desc.
