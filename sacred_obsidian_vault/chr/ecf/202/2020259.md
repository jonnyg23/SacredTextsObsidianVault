 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.x.xlii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xlii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XLII</span>.—<i>Panegyric of the Emperor Theodosius Younger.</i> <a name="fr_1029"></a><a href="#fn_1029"><font size="1">1030</font></a>
   </p>   
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xlii-p3"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xlii-p3.1"></a>For</span> these reasons the emperor had the highest esteem for Proclus. For in fact he himself was a pattern to all true clergymen, and never approved of those who attempted to persecute others. Nay I may venture to affirm, that in meekness he surpassed all those who have ever faithfully borne the sacerdotal office. And what is recorded of Moses in the book of Numbers, <a name="fr_1030"></a><a href="#fn_1030"><font size="1">1031</font></a>
   Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth—may most justly be applied at this day; for the Emperor Theodosius is meek above all the men which are upon the face of the earth. It is because of this meekness that God subdued his enemies without martial conflicts, as the capture of the usurper John, <a name="fr_1031"></a><a href="#fn_1031"><font size="1">1032</font></a>
   and the subsequent discomfiture of the barbarians clearly demonstrate. For the God of the universe has afforded this most devout emperor in our times supernatural aid of a similar kind to what was vouchsafed to the righteous heretofore. I write not these things from adulation, but truthfully narrate facts such as everybody can attest. </p>
