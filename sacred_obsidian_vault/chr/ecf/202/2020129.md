 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.vii.iv-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vii.iv-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV</span>.—<i>The Macedonians hold a Synod at Lampsacus, during a Period of Both Secular and Ecclesiastical Agitation; and after confirming the Antiochian Creed, and anathematizing that promulgated at Ariminum, they again ratify the Deposition of Acacius and Eudoxius.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.vii.iv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vii.iv-p2.1"></a>While</span> these events were taking place there could be no peace either in the church or in the state. Now those who had been empowered by the emperor to hold a council assembled at Lampsacus in the consulate just mentioned: this was seven years after the council of Seleucia. There, after confirming the Antiochian Creed, to which they had subscribed at Seleucia, <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">572</font></a>
   they anathematized that which had been set forth at Ariminum <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">573</font></a>
   by their former associates in opinion. They moreover again condemned the party of Acacius and Eudoxius, and declared their deposition to have been just. <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">574</font></a>
   The civil war which was then impending prevented Eudoxius bishop of Constantinople from either gainsaying or revenging these determinations. Wherefore Eleusius bishop of Cyzicus and his adherents became for a little while the stronger party; inasmuch as they supported the views of Macedonius, which although before but obscurely known, acquired great publicity through the Synod at Lampsacus. This Synod, I think, was the cause of the increase of the Macedonians in the Hellespont; for Lampsacus is situated in one of the narrow bays of the Hellespont. Such was the issue of this council. </p>
