 </p><p class="c32"><a name="iii.ix.iii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.ix.iii-p1.1"></a>Chapter III</span>.—<i>Martyrdom of the Holy Notaries</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.ix.iii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.ix.iii-p2.1"></a>The</span> persecution increased in violence, <a name="fr_1286"></a><a href="#fn_1286"><font size="1">1287</font></a>
   and led to deeds of blood. Martyrius and Marcian were among those who were slain. They had lived in Pauls house, <a name="fr_1287"></a><a href="#fn_1287"><font size="1">1288</font></a>
   and were delivered up by Macedonius to the governor, as having been guilty of the murder of Hermogenes, and of exciting the former sedition against him. Martyrius was a sub-deacon, and Marcian a singer and a reader of Holy Scripture. Their tomb is famous, and is situated before the walls of Constantinople, as a memorial of the martyrs; it is placed in a house of prayer, which was commenced by John and completed by Sisinnius; these both afterwards presided over the church of Constantinople. For they who had been unworthily adjudged to have no part in the honors of martyrdom, were honored by God, because the very place where those conducted to death had been decapitated, and which previously was not approached on account of ghosts, was now purified, and those who were under the influence of demons were released from the disease, and many other notable miracles were wrought at the tomb. These are the particulars which should be stated concerning Martyrius and Marcian. If what I have related appears <a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a> <a name="iii.ix.iii-Page_302"></a>to be scarcely credible, it is easy to apply for further information to those who are more accurately acquainted with the circumstances; and perhaps far more wonderful things are related concerning them than those which I have detailed. </p>
