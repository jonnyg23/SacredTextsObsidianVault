 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.vii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.vii-p2.1"></a>Shortly</span> afterwards Theophilus bishop of Alexandria having fallen into a lethargic state, died on the 15th of October, <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">921</font></a>
   in the ninth consulate of Honorius, and the fifth of Theodosius. A great contest immediately arose about the appointment of a successor, some seeking to place Timothy the archdeacon in the episcopal chair; and others desiring Cyril, who was a nephew of Theophilus. A tumult having arisen on this account among the people, Abundantius, the commander of the troops in Egypt, took sides with Timothy. [Yet the partisans of Cyril triumphed.] <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">922</font></a>
   Whereupon on the third day after the death of Theophilus, Cyril came into possession of the episcopate, with greater power than Theophilus had ever exercised. For from that time the bishopric of Alexandria went beyond the limits of its sacerdotal functions, and assumed the administration of secular matters. <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">923</font></a>
   Cyril immediately therefore shut up the churches of the Novatians at Alexandria, and took possession of all their consecrated vessels and ornaments; and then stripped their bishop Theopemptus of all that he had. </p>
