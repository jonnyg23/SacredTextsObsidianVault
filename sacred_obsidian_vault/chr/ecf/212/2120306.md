 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.iv-p4"></a>Gregory to John, Bishop of Constantinople.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.iv-p5"></a>If the virtue of charity consists in the love of ones neighbour, and we are commanded to love our neighbours as ourselves, how is it that your Blessedness does not love me even as yourself?  For I know with what ardour, with what anxiety, you wished to fly from the burden of the episcopate; and yet you made no opposition to this same burden of the episcopate being imposed on me.  It is evident, then, that you do not love me as yourself, seeing that you have wished me to take on myself that load which you were unwilling should be imposed on you.  But since I, unworthy and weak, have taken charge of an old and grievously shattered ship (for on all sides the waves enter, and the planks, battered by a daily and violent storm, sound of shipwreck), I beseech thee by Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.iv-p5.1"></a>God</span> to stretch out the hand of thy prayer to me in this my danger, since thou canst pray the more strenuously as thou standest further removed from the confusion of the tribulations which we suffer in this land.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.iv-p6"></a>My synodical epistle I will transmit with all possible speed, having despatched Bacauda, our brother and fellow-bishop, immediately after my ordination, as the bearer of this letter, while pressed by many and serious engagements.</p>
