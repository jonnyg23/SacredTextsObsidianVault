 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.ii.vii-p2"></a>That those who fly from the burden of rule through humility are then truly humble when they resist not the divine decrees.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.ii.vii-p3"></a>There are some also who fly by reason only of their humility, lest they should be preferred to others to whom they esteem themselves unequal.  And theirs, indeed, if it be surrounded by other virtues, is then true humility before the eyes of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.ii.vii-p3.1"></a>God</span>, when it is not pertinacious in rejecting what it is enjoined to undertake with profit.  For neither is he truly humble, who understands how the good pleasure of the Supernal Will ought to bear sway, and yet contemns its sway.  But, submitting himself to the divine disposals, and averse from the vice of obstinacy, if he be already prevented with gifts whereby he may profit others also, he ought, when enjoined to undertake supreme rule, in his heart to flee from it, but against his will to obey.</p>
