 <p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-p2"></a><i>To Gennadius, Patrician</i> <a name="fr_1679"></a><a href="#fn_1679"><font size="1">1680</font></a>

 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-p4"></a>Gregory to Gennadius, Patrician of Africa.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-p5"></a>We doubt not that your Excellency remembers how two years ago we wrote in behalf of Paul our brother and fellow-bishop, asking you to afford him the support of your Dignity in his desire to come to us on account of the trouble he was said to be undergoing from persecution on the part of the Donatists, to the end that, since it had been reported to us that he could get no aid against them there, we might, after ascertaining the truth, give him advice with fraternal sympathy, and treat with him as to what should be done in the way of a wholesome arrangement against the madness of pestiferous presumption.  And, so far as our aforesaid brother gave us to understand, he not only failed to get succour from any one, but was prevented by various hindrances from being able to come with safety to the Roman city.  Yet, when we had caused your epistle to be read to him, he replied that he is not suffering from the ill-will of certain persons because he repressed the Donatists, but rather says that he is in disfavour with many for his defence of the Catholic faith; and he told me many things besides, which, since this is not a fit time for mentioning them, we have thought best to keep to ourselves.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-p6"></a>  <a name="page_208b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-Page_208b"></a>Since, then, the question before us is not one of earthly affairs, but of the health of souls, and your assertion and his are different, we have been unable to say anything particularly in reply, not having investigated the truth, seeing that, when we received the letters of your Excellency, we were confined by bodily sickness.  But when Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-p6.1"></a>God</span>, if it should please Him, shall have restored us to our former health, we will sift the truth as we can by diligent enquiry.  And according to what we may be able to learn we will so settle the case through the mercy of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-p6.2"></a>God</span> that not only the health of souls in the cure whereof you deign to take an interest, lost now by them that err, may be restored, but also that which the maintainers of the true faith still possess may, through the protecting grace of our Redeemer, be preserved.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xliii-p7"></a>But with regard to the above-named bishop, whom you assert to be deprived of communion, we greatly wonder how it is that a letter from your Excellency, and not from his primate, has announced this to us.</p>
