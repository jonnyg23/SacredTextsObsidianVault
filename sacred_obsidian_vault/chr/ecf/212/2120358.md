 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.iii-p5"></a>We execute more efficiently our heavenly commission, if we share our burdens with our brethren.  For this cause we appoint thee, our most reverend brother and fellow-bishop, to have administration over all the churches of Sicily in the name of the Apostolical See, so that whosoever there is reckoned as being in a condition of religion may by our authority be subject to thy Fraternity, to the end that it may not hereafter be necessary for them to make such long sea-voyages in resorting to us for slight causes.  But if by any chance there are matters of difficulty which can by no means be settled by the judgment of thy Fraternity, in these only let our judgment be solicited, that so we may occupy ourselves more efficaciously in greater causes, being relieved from the least.  And be it understood that we give this delegation of authority, not to thy place, but to thy person, because we have learnt from thy past life what we may presume of thee in thy future conduct.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.ii.iii-p3"></a> Maximianus had been a monk, and for a time abbot, in Gregorys monastery of St. Andrew at Rome, had accompanied him to Constantinople, and been recommended by him soon after his own accession, and elected Bishop of Syracuse (<i>Joan. Diac. Vit. S. Greg</i>. ii. 11, 12).  He was highly esteemed by Gregory, and mentioned in his Dialogues as having been miraculously delivered from shipwreck on his return from Constantinople to Rome (<i>Dialog</i>. iii. 36.  Cf. <i>Hom</i>. 34 <i>in Evang</i>.).  His appointment now as delegate of the Roman See in Sicily would relieve Peter the subdeacon of his temporary jurisdiction over the ecclesiastics there.  Maximianus died in November, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.iii-p3.1"></a>a.d.</span> 594.  See V. 17, 22.  It is to be observed that the general authority now given to Maximianus was granted to him personally, and not permanently to the See of Syracuse.</p>
