 <p class="c26"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p2"></a><span class="c4"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></a>To the Archimandrites of Constantinople <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">326</font></a>
 .</span></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p4"></a>To his well-beloved sons Faustus, Martinus, and the rest of the archimandrites, Leo the bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p5"></a>He acknowledges their zeal and refers them to the Tome.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p6"></a>As on behalf of the faith which Eutyches has tried to disturb, I was sending legates <i>de latere</i> <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">327</font></a>
  to assist the defence of the Truth, I thought it fitting that I should address a letter to you also, beloved:  whom I know for certain to be so zealous in the cause of religion that you can by no means listen calmly to such blasphemous and profane utterances:  for the Apostles command lingers in your hearts, in which it is said, “If any man hath preached unto you any gospel other than that which he received, let him be anathema <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">328</font></a>
 .”  And we also decide that the opinion of the said Eutyches is to be rejected, which, as we have learnt from perusing the proceedings, has been deservedly condemned:  so that, if its foolish maintainer will abide by his perverseness, he may have fellowship with those whose error he has followed.  For one who says that Christ had not a human, that is our, nature, is deservedly put out of Christs Church.  But, if he be corrected through the pity of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p8.2"></a>Gods</span> Spirit and acknowledge his wicked error, so as to condemn unreservedly what catholics reject, we wish him not to be denied mercy, that the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p8.3"></a>Lords</span> Church may suffer no loss:  for the repentant can always be readmitted, it is only error that must be shut out.  Upon the mystery of great godliness <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">329</font></a>
 , whereby through the Incarnation of the Word of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p9.4"></a>God</span> comes our justification and redemption, what is our opinion, drawn from the tradition of the fathers, is now sufficiently explained according to my judgment in the letter which I have sent to our brother Flavian the bishop <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">330</font></a>
 :  so that through the declaration of your chief you may know what, according to the gospel of our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p10.1"></a>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, we desire to be fixed in the hearts of all the faithful.  Dated 13th June, in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>

Sardic., canon 7, where the fathers ask the Roman bishop to send some one <i>e latere suo</i> (<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxii-p7.1"></a>a.d.</span> 347).</p>
