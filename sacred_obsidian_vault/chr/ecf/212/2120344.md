 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xlii-p4"></a>If our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.1"></a>Lord</span> Himself by the testimony of Holy Scripture declares Himself to be the husband of widows and father of orphans, we also, the members of His body, ought with the souls supreme affection to set ourselves to imitate the head, and saving justice, to stand by orphans and widows if need be.  And, having been given to understand that Catella, a religious woman who has a son serving here in the holy Roman Church over which under <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.2"></a>God</span> we preside, is being troubled by the exactions and molestations of certain persons, we think it needful to exhort your Fraternity by this letter not to refuse (saving justice) to afford your protection to this same woman, knowing that by things of this kind you both make the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.3"></a>Lord</span> your debtor and bind us to you the more in the bonds of charity.  For we wish the causes of the aforesaid woman, whether now or in future, to be terminated by your judgment, that she may be relieved from the annoyance of legal proceedings, and yet be by no means excused from submitting to a just judgment.  Now I pray the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.4"></a>Lord</span> to direct your life in a prosperous course towards Himself, and Himself to bring you in His mercy to the kingdom of glory which is to come.</p>
