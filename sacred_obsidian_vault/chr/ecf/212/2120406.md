 <p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p2"></a><i>To Libertinus, Præfect</i> <a name="fr_1490"></a><a href="#fn_1490"><font size="1">1491</font></a>

 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p4"></a>Gregory to Libertinus, Præfect of Sicily.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p5"></a>From the very beginning of your administration <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p5.1"></a>God</span> has willed you to go forth to vindicate His cause, and of His mercy has reserved for you this reward, with praise attending it.  For it is reported that one Nasas, a most wicked Jew, has with a temerity that calls for punishment erected an altar under the name of the blessed Elias, and by sacrilegious seduction has enticed many Christians to worship there; nay, has also, it is said, acquired Christian slaves, and devoted them to his own service and profit.  Whilst, then, he ought to have been most severely punished for such great crimes, the glorious Justinus <a name="fr_1491"></a><a href="#fn_1491"><font size="1">1492</font></a>
 , soothed (as has been written to us) by the charm of avarice, put off avenging the injury done to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p6.1"></a>God</span>.  But let your Glory institute a strict examination into all these things, and, if it should be found manifest that such things have been done, make haste to visit   <a name="page_132b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.iii.xx-Page_132b"></a>them most strictly and corporally on this wicked Jew, in such sort that you may thereby both conciliate the favour of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p6.2"></a>God</span> to yourself, and shew yourself by this example, to your own reward, a model to posterity.  Moreover, set at liberty, without any equivocation, according to the injunctions of the laws <a name="fr_1492"></a><a href="#fn_1492"><font size="1">1493</font></a>
 , whatever Christian slaves it shall appear that he has acquired; lest (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p7.1"></a>God</span> forbid) the Christian religion should be polluted by being subjected to Jews.  Do you therefore with all speed correct these things most strictly, that not only may we give thanks to you for this discipline, but also bear testimony to your goodness in case of need.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.iii.xx-p7"></a> In Cod. <i>lib</i>. 1, <i>tit</i>. 10; “Judæus servum Christianum nec comparare debebit, nec largitatis aut alioquocunque titulo consequetur.  Quod si aliquis Judæorum…, non solum mancipii damno multetur, verum etiam capitali sententia puniatur.”  Eusebius also (<i>De Vita Constantini</i>, <i>lib</i>. iv. c. 27) speaks of a law passed by Constantine forbidding Jews to have Christian slaves, and ordering any that might be found to be set at liberty, and the Jew to be fined.  Cf. II. 21.</p>
