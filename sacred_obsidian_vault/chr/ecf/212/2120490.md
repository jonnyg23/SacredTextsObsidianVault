 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p2"></a>To Queen Brunichild.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p3"></a>Gregory to Brunichild, Queen of the Franks <a name="fr_1630"></a><a href="#fn_1630"><font size="1">1631</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p6"></a>The laudable and God-pleasing goodness of your Excellence is manifested both by your government of your kingdom and by your education of your son <a name="fr_1631"></a><a href="#fn_1631"><font size="1">1632</font></a>
 .  To him you have not only with provident solicitude conserved intact the glory of temporal things, but have also seen to the rewards of eternal life, having planted his mind in the root of the true faith with maternal, as became you, and laudable care of his education.  Whence not undeservedly it ensues that he should surpass all the kingdoms of the nations <a name="fr_1632"></a><a href="#fn_1632"><font size="1">1633</font></a>
 , in that he both worships purely and confesses truly the Creator of these nations.  But that faith may shine forth in him the more laudably in his works, let the words of your exhortation kindle him, to the end that, as royal power shews him lofty among men, so goodness of conduct may make him great before <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p8.2"></a>God</span>.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p9"></a>Now inasmuch as past experience in many instances gives us confidence in the Christianity of your Excellence, we beg of you, for the love of Peter, Prince of the apostles, whom we know that you love with your whole heart, that you would cherish with the aid of your patronage our most beloved son the presbyter Candidus <a name="fr_1633"></a><a href="#fn_1633"><font size="1">1634</font></a>
 , who is the bearer of these presents, together with the little patrimony for the government of which we have sent him, to the end that, strengthened by the favour of your support, he may be able both to manage profitably this little patrimony, which is evidently beneficial towards the expenses of the poor, and also to recover into the possession of this little patrimony anything that may have been taken away from it.  For it is not without increase of your praise that after so long a time a man belonging to Church has been sent for the management of this patrimony.  Let your Excellency, then, deign so willingly to give your attention to what we request of you that the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, to whom the power of binding and loosing has been given by the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p10.1"></a>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, may both grant to your Excellence to rejoice here in your offspring, and after courses of many years   <a name="page_190b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vi.iv-Page_190b"></a>cause you to be found, absolved from all ills before the face of the eternal Judge.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p4"></a> This is the first of the ten letters of Gregory to the notorious Brunechild.  A daughter of Athanagild, king of the Visigoths in Spain, she had married Sigebert I., one of the grandsons of Clovis, who reigned over that part of the dominion of the Franks which was called Austrasia, having on her marriage renounced Arianism for Catholicity.  Sigebert having been assassinated <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p4.1"></a>a.d.</span> 575, his son Childebert II., then only five years old, was proclaimed King of Austrasia; whereupon Brunechild herself became the virtual ruler of the kingdom.  So she was again after the death of Childebert, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p4.2"></a>a.d.</span> 596, as guardian of Theodebert II., his illegitimate son, who succeeded him at the age of ten years.  See <i>Pedigree of Kings of Gaul</i>, p. xxx.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p5"></a>The praises lavished on her by Gregory in this and his other epistles to her appear strangely inconsistent with the character given her by the historians of the time.  It has been suggested in explanation; 1. That the historians may have maligned her, attributing to her crimes that were not her own; 2. That, whatever her misdemeanours, Gregory might not have heard of them, knowing of her only as a faithful Catholic, and a supporter of the Church; 3. That no such misdemeanours had become notorious when Gregory wrote to her in such flattering terms, the worst doings imputed to her having in fact been after his death.  She survived him some nine years.  Still, when we consider Gregorys diplomatic turn, together with his habitual deference to potentates apparent elsewhere, we cannot think it unlikely that he might ignore purposely in his addresses to them even their known moral delinquencies, so long as he could enlist their support of religion and orthodoxy, or their loyalty to the see of Rome.  And, after all, Brunechild may not have been much worse than some other Frank royalties, all of whom he would be naturally and properly desirous of conciliating, and making the best of them he could.  A less defensible instance of apparently politic flattery is found in his letters to the Emperor Phocas and his Empress Leontia after the deposition and murder of Mauricius.  See XIII. 31, 38, 39, and <i>Proleg</i>., p. xxvii.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p7"></a> Childebert II. (see last note), who had been a minor when he came to the throne.  He would now, if the epistle was written, as supposed, in the 14th Indiction (595–6), be about 25 years old.</p>
 <a name="fn_1632"></a><a href="2120490.htm#fr_1632">189b:1633</a> <a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p7.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p8"></a> Since the death of his uncle Guntramn, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p8.1"></a>a.d.</span> 593, he had become King of Burgundy as well as of Austrasia.</p>
 <a name="fn_1633"></a><a href="2120490.htm#fr_1633">189b:1634</a> <a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p9.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vi.iv-p10"></a> It was the sending of Candidus, a presbyter from Rome, to take charge of the patrimony in Gaul in place of Dynamius, a patrician, who had previously managed it (see <i>Ep</i>. 6), that offered occasion for this and the following letter.</p>
