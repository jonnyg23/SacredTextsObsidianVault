 <p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p2"></a><i>To Victor and Columbus, Bishops</i> <a name="fr_1558"></a><a href="#fn_1558"><font size="1">1559</font></a>

 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p4"></a>Gregory to Victor and Columbus, Bishops of Africa.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p5"></a>After what manner a disease, if neglected in its beginning, acquires strength we have proved from our own necessities, whosoever of us have had our lot in this life.  If, then, it were met by the foresight of skilful physicians at its birth, we know that it would cease before doing very much harm from being attended to too late.  On this consideration, then, reason ought to impel us, when diseases of souls are beginning, to make haste to resist them by all the means in our power, lest, while we neglect applying wholesome medicines, they steal away from us the lives of many whom we are striving to win for our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p5.1"></a>God</span>.  Wherefore it behoves us so with watchful carefulness to guard the folds of sheep which we see ourselves to be put over as keepers that the prowling wolf may find everywhere shepherds to resist him, and may have no way of entrance thereinto.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p6"></a>For indeed we find that the stings of the Donatists have in your parts so disturbed the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p6.1"></a>Lords</span> flock, as though it were guided by no shepherds control.  And there has been reported to us what we cannot speak of without heavy sorrow, seeing that very many have already been torn by their poisoned teeth.  Lastly, in order with most wicked audacity to drive catholic priests from their churches, they are said, in their most atrocious wickedness, even to have slain many besides, on whom the water of regeneration had conferred salvation, by rebaptizing them.  All this saddens our mind exceedingly, for that, while you are placed there, it has been allowed to damned presumption to perpetrate such wickedness.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p7"></a>In this matter we exhort your Fraternity by this present writing, that, after discussion held and a council assembled, you should eagerly and with all your power so oppose this still nascent disease that neither may it acquire strength from neglect nor scatter the woes of pestilence in the flock committed to your charge.  For, if in any way whatever (as we do not believe will be the case) you neglect to resist iniquity in its beginning, they will wound very many with the sword of their error.  And it is in truth a most serious thing to allow to be ensnared in the noose of diabolical fraud those whom we are able to rescue beforehand from being entangled.  Moreover it is better to prevent any one from being wounded than to search out how one that is wounded may be healed.  Considering this, therefore, hasten ye by sedulous prayer and all the means in your power, to quell sacrilegious wickedness, so that subsequent news, through the aid of the grace of Christ, may cause us more joy for the punishment of those men than sadness for their excesses.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxvii-p8"></a>Furthermore, take all possible pains to send to us with all speed our brother and fellow-bishop Paul <a name="fr_1559"></a><a href="#fn_1559"><font size="1">1560</font></a>
 , to the end that, on learning more particularly from him the causes of so great a crime, we may be able by the succour of our Creator to apply the medicine of fitting rebuke to this most atrocious wickedness.</p>
