 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xiv-p3"></a>Gregory to John, Bishop of Syracuse.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xiv-p4"></a>Moved by the benevolence of the Apostolic See and by the order of ancient custom, we have thought fit to grant to thy Fraternity, who art known to have received the office of government in the Church of Syracuse, the use of the pallium; that is, at such times and in such manner as thou knowest without doubt that it was used by thy predecessor; nevertheless admonishing thee that, as thou rejoicest in having received from us the use of this decoration for the honour of thy priestly office, so also by probity of manners and deeds thou strive to adorn the office thou hast received unto our glory in Christ.  For thus wilt thou be conspicuous for decorations mutually answering to each other, if with this habit for the body the excellence also of thy mind agrees.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xiv-p5"></a>For all privileges which are known to have been granted formerly to thy Church we confirm by our authority, and decree that they shall remain inviolate.</p>
