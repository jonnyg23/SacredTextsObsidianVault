 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.vii-p2"></a>To Respecta, Abbess.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.vii-p3"></a>Gregory to Respecta, Abbess of Massilia (<i>Marseilles</i>) in Gaul.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.vii-p4"></a>The demand of a pious wish ought to be accomplished by a consequent result, that so the benefit demanded may be validly attained, and sincerity of devotion may laudably shine forth.  Accordingly to the monastery consecrated to the honour of Saint Cassian wherein you are selected to preside—in accordance with the petition of our children Dynamius and Aureliana, who are shewn, in their religious devotion, to have united it to the house in their possession by connecting the buildings—we have seen fit to allow these privileges:—We appoint that on the death of the abbess of the aforesaid monastery, not a stranger, but one whom the congregation may choose for itself from among its own members, shall be ordained; whom (provided however that she be judged worthy of this ministry) the bishops of the same place shall ordain.  Further, with regard to the property and management of the same monastery, we decree that neither bishop nor any ecclesiastic shall have any power; but appoint that these things shall in all respects pertain to the charge of thy Solicitude, or of her who may be abbess in the same place after thee.  If on the day of the Saints anniversary, or of the dedication,   <a name="page_216b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vii.vii-Page_216b"></a>of the aforesaid monastery the bishop should resort thither for celebrating the sacred solemnities of mass, still his office must be so executed that his chair be not placed there, except on the aforesaid days while he is celebrating there the solemnities of mass.  And when he departs, let his chair be at the same time removed from the same oratory.  But on all other days let the offices of mass be performed by the presbyter whom the same bishop may appoint</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.vii-p5"></a>Furthermore, with regard to the life and deeds of the handmaidens of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.vii-p5.1"></a>God</span>, or of the abbess who may be constituted in the above-written monastery, we enjoin on the bishop, in the fear of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.vii-p5.2"></a>God</span>, to devote careful attention to them; so that, if any of those who dwell there, her fault demanding it, ought to be subjected to punishment, he may himself visit the offence according to the vigour of the sacred canons.  These things, then, being by us ordained and granted, do thou, in the ordering of thy congregation, study to shew thyself so earnestly attentive in all respects that the malice of the malignant foe may find nothing there that can be contaminated.  All these things, therefore, embraced in this paper of injunctions, we ordain to be observed, under Christs protection, in all respects and by all persons for ever in thy monastery, to the end that the benefits of the privileges allowed may always continue firm and inviolate.  The month of November, Indict. 15.</p>
