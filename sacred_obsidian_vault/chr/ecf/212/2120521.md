 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p5"></a>Having regard to your sincere charity we are well assured that out of love for Peter, the Prince of the apostles, you will devotedly afford your succour to our men; especially since the nature of the case requires you to give assistance even of your own accord, and the more when you see them labour.  Wherefore we inform your Holiness that, the Lord so ordering it, we have despatched Augustine, the servant of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p5.1"></a>God</span>, the bearer of these presents, whose zeal and earnestness are well known to us, with other servants of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxv-p5.2"></a>God</span>, in behalf of souls in those parts; from whose account of things when you have fully learnt what is enjoined on him, let your Fraternity bestow your succour on him in all ways which the case may require, that you may be able, as is becoming and fit, to be helpers of a good work.  Let, then, your Fraternity study to shew yourself so devoted in this matter that your action may prove to us the truth of the good report that we have heard of you.  We commend to you in all respects our most beloved common son, Candidus the presbyter, to whom we have committed the patrimony of our Church situated in those parts.</p>
