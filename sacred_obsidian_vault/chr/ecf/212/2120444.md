 <p> <a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii"></a>
 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></a>Epistle XXXI.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p2"></a>To Theodorus, Physician.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p3"></a>Gregory to Theodorus, Physician to the Emperor.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4"></a>I myself give thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.1"></a>God</span>, that distance does not separate the hearts of those who truly love each other mutually.  For lo, most sweet and glorious son, we are far apart in body, and yet are present with each other in charity.  This your works, this your letters testify, this I experienced in you when present, this I recognize in your Glory when absent.  May this make you both beloved of men and worthy for ever before Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.2"></a>God</span>.  For, charity being the mother of virtues, you bring forth the fruits of good works for this reason that you keep in your soul the very root of those fruits.  Now what you have sent me, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.3"></a>God</span> inspiring you, for the redemption of captives, I confess that I have received both with joy and with sorrow.  With joy, that is, for you, whom I thus perceive to be preparing a mansion in the heavenly country; but with exceeding sorrow for myself, who, over and above my care of the property of the holy apostle Peter, must now also give an account of the property of my most sweet son, the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.4"></a>Lord</span> Theodorus, and be held responsible for having spent it carefully or negligently.  But may Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.5"></a>God</span>, who has poured into your mind the bowels of His own mercy, who has granted to you to take anxious thought for what is said of our Saviour by the excellent preacher—<i>That, though he was rich, yet for us he became poor</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009">2 Cor. viii. 9</a><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p4.6"></a>)—may He, at the coming of the same Saviour, shew you to be rich in virtues, cause you to stand free from all fault, and grant to you heavenly for earthly joys, abiding joys for transitory.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p5"></a>As to what you say you desire to be done for you near the most sacred body of the holy apostle Peter, be assured that, though your tongue were silent, your charity bids the doing of it.  Would indeed that we were worthy to pray for you:  but that I am not worthy I have no doubt.  Still, however, there are here many worthy folk, who are being redeemed from the enemy by your offering, and serve our Creator faithfully, with regard to whom you have done what is written; <i>Lay up alms in the bosom of the poor, and it shall pray for thee</i> (<a href="../../../bib/apo/sir029.htm#015">Ecclesiasticus 29.15</a><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p5.1"></a>).</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p6"></a>But, since he loves the more who presumes the more, I have some complaint against the most sweet disposition of my most glorious son the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p6.1"></a>Lord</span> Theodorus; namely that he has received from the holy Trinity the gift of genius, the gift of wealth, the gift of mercy and charity, and yet is unceasingly bound up in secular causes, is occupied in continual processions, and neglects to read daily the words of his Redeemer.  For what is sacred Scripture but a kind of epistle of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p6.2"></a>God</span> to His creature?  And surely, if your Glory were resident in any other place, and were to receive letters from an earthly emperor, you would not loiter, you would not rest, you would not give sleep to your eyes, till you had learnt what the earthly emperor had written.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7"></a>The Emperor of Heaven, the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.1"></a>Lord</span> of men and angels, has sent thee his epistles for thy lifes behoof; and yet, glorious son, thou neglectest to read these epistles ardently.  Study then, I beseech thee, and daily meditate on the words of thy Creator.  Learn the heart of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.2"></a>God</span> in the words of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.3"></a>God</span>, that thou mayest sigh more ardently for the things that are eternal, that your soul may be kindled with greater longings for heavenly joys.  For a man will have the greater rest here in proportion as he has now no rest in the love of his Maker.  But, that you may act thus, may Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p7.4"></a>God</span> pour into you the Spirit the Comforter:  may He fill your soul with His presence, and in filling it, compose it.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p8"></a>As to me, know ye that I suffer here many and innumerable bitternesses.  But I give thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p8.1"></a>God</span> that I suffer far less than I deserve.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-p9"></a>I commend to your Glory my son, your patient, the lord Narses.  I know indeed that you hold him as in all respects commended to you; but I beg you to do what you are doing, that, in asking for what I see is being done, I may by my asking have a share in your reward.  Furthermore, I have received the blessing <a name="fr_1553"></a><a href="#fn_1553"><font size="1">1554</font></a>
  of your Excellency with the charity wherewith it was sent to me.  And I have presumed to send you, in acknowledgment of your love, a duck with two small ducklings, that, as often as your eye is led to look at it, the memory also of me may be  <a name="page_157b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.iv.xxiii-Page_157b"></a>recalled to you among the occupations and tumults of business.</p>
