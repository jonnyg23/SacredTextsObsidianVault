 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xxxii-p4"></a>The divine precepts admonish us to love our neighbours as ourselves; and, seeing that we are enjoined to love them with this charity, how much more ought we to succour them by supplies to their carnal needs, that we may relieve their distress, if not in all respects, yet at least with some support.  Inasmuch, then, as we have found that the son of the most worthy Godiscalchus is in distress, not only from loss of sight, but also from want of food, we hold it necessary to provide for him as far as possible.  Wherefore we enjoin thy Experience by this present order to supply to him for sustaining life twenty-four <i>modii</i> of wheat every year, and also twelve <i>modii</i> of beans and twenty <i>decimates</i> <a name="fr_1365"></a><a href="#fn_1365"><font size="1">1366</font></a>
 of wine; which may afterwards be debited in thy accounts.  So act, therefore, that the bearer of these presents may have to complain of no delay in receiving the gifts of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxii-p5.1"></a>Lord</span>, and that thou mayest be found partaker in the well administered benefit.</p>
