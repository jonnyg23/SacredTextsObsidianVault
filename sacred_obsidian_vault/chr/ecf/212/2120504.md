 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p2"></a>To the Salonitans.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p3"></a>Gregory to his most beloved sons, the clergy and nobles dwelling at Salona <a name="fr_1649"></a><a href="#fn_1649"><font size="1">1650</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p5"></a>It has come to my ears, that certain men of perverse disposition, in order to poison your minds, beloved, have tried to insinuate to you that I am moved by some grudge against Maximus, and that I am desiring to carry out not so much what is canonical as what anger dictates.  But far, far be it from the priestly mind to be moved in any cause by private feeling.  It is on the contrary as taking thought for you, beloved, and as fearing the judgment of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p5.1"></a>God</span> on my own soul, that I desire the case of this same Maximus to be thoroughly investigated, as to whether he is burdened by no such crimes as are a bar to ordination, and makes no attempt to attain to the priestly office through simoniacal heresy; that is by giving bribes to some of his electors.  He will then be a free intercessor for you before the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p5.2"></a>Lord</span>, if he shall come to the place of intercession bound by no sins of his own.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p6"></a>And yet his sin of pride is already manifestly shewn, in that, having been summoned to come to us, he resists under various excuses, shuns coming, is afraid to come.  What then is he afraid of, if his conscience does not accuse him with respect to the things he is charged with?  Lo, beloved, ye have now been long without a pastor, and may Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p6.1"></a>God</span> make known to you how earnestly and from the bottom of my heart I sympathize with you in your destitution.  For I hear what ravages are being made in the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p6.2"></a>Lords</span> flock.  But, when there is no shepherd, who may watch against the wolves?  Wherefore urge ye the aforesaid Maximus to come hither to us, to the end that we may confirm him if we are able to find him innocent; but, if the things that are said of him should turn out to be true, that you, beloved, may be no longer left destitute through the interposition of his person.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p7"></a>For as to me, be assured that I am not moved against him by any grudge or any animosity of private feeling; but whatever may be canonical and just with the help of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p7.1"></a>God</span> I will determine.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p8"></a>  <a name="page_197b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-Page_197b"></a>But I have been greatly astonished that among so many clergy and people of the Church of Salona hardly two in sacred orders have been found—to wit our brother and fellow-bishop Paulinus and my most beloved son Honoratus, archdeacon of the same Church—who refused to communicate with Maximus when he seized the priesthood, and who remembered that they were Christians.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p9"></a>For you ought, most dear sons, to have considered your own orders, and recognized as rejected him whom the Apostolical See rejected, that he might first be purged, if he could be, from the charges brought against him, and that then your Love might communicate with him without being partakers in his liability.  We however are bound to your Charity in the bowels of loving-kindness; and, since we have learnt that some of you were pressed by force to accept him and communicate with him, we implore Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xviii-p9.1"></a>God</span> to absolve you from all guilt of your own sins and from all implication in the liability of others, and to give you the grace of His protection in the present life, and grant to us to rejoice for you in the eternal country.</p>
