 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p1.1"></a>Epistle V.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p2"></a>To Theoctista, Sister of the Emperor.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p3"></a>Gregory to Theoctista, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.v-p4"></a>With how great devotion my mind prostrates itself before your Venerableness I cannot fully express in words; nor yet do I labour to give utterance to it, since, even though I were silent, you read in your heart your own sense   <a name="page_75b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.i.v-Page_75b"></a>of my devotion.  I wonder, however, that you withdrew your countenance, till of late bestowed on me, from this my recent engagement in the pastoral office; wherein, under colour of episcopacy, I have been brought back to the world; in which I am involved in such great earthly cares as I do not at all remember having been subjected to even in a lay state of life.  For I have lost the deep joys of my quiet, and seem to have risen outwardly while inwardly falling down.  Whence I grieve to find myself banished far from the face of my Maker.  For I used to strive daily to win my way outside the world, outside the flesh; to drive all phantasms of the body from the eyes of my soul, and to see incorporeally supernal joys; and not only with my voice but in the core of my heart I used to say, <i>My heart hath said unto Thee, I have sought Thy face, Thy face, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p4.1"></a>Lord</span>, will I seek</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008">Ps. xxvi. 8</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p4.2"></a>).  Moreover desiring nothing, fearing nothing, in this world, I seemed to myself to stand on a certain summit of things, so that I almost believed to be fulfilled in me what I had learnt of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p4.3"></a>Lords</span> promise through the prophet, <i>I will lift thee up upon the high places of the earth</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000">Isa. 1:0</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014">Isa. 58:14</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p4.4"></a>).  For he is lifted up upon the high places of the earth who treads under foot through looking down upon them in his mind even the very things of the present world which seem lofty and glorious.  But, having been suddenly dashed from this summit of things by the whirlwind of this trial, I have fallen into fears and tremors, since, even though I have no fears for myself, I am greatly afraid for those who have been committed to me.  On every side I am tossed by the waves of business, and sunk by storms, so that I may truly say, <i>I am come into the depth of the sea, and the storm hath overwhelmed me</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002">Psa. 69.2</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p4.5"></a> <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">1300</font></a>
 ).  After business I long to return to my heart; but, driven therefrom by vain tumults of thoughts, I am unable to return.  From this cause, then, that which is within me is made to be far from me, so that I cannot obey the prophetic voice which says, <i>Return to your heart, transgressors</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000">Isa. 1:0</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008">Isa. 46:8</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p5.1"></a>).  But, pressed by foolish thoughts, I am impelled only to exclaim, <i>My heart hath failed me</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012">Psa. 40.12</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p5.2"></a> <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">1301</font></a>
 ).  I have loved the beauty of the contemplative life as a Rachel, barren, but keen of sight and fair (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#000">Gen. xxix</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p6.1"></a>.), who, though in her quietude she is less fertile, yet sees the light more keenly.  But, by what judgment I know not, Leah has been coupled with me in the night, to wit, the active life; fruitful, but tender-eyed; seeing less, but bringing forth more.  I have longed to sit at the feet of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p6.2"></a>Lord</span> with Mary, to take in the words of His mouth; and lo, I am compelled to serve with Martha in external affairs, to be careful and troubled about many things (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039">Luke x. 39</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p6.3"></a>, <i>seq.</i>).  A legion of demons having been, as I believed, cast out of me, I wished to forget those whom I had known, and to rest at the feet of the Saviour; and lo it is said to me, so as to compel me against my will, <i>Return to thine house, and declare how great things the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p6.4"></a>Lord</span> hath done for thee</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019">Mark v. 19</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p6.5"></a>).  But who in the midst of so many earthly cares may be able to preach the wondrous works of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p6.6"></a>God</span>, it being already difficult for me even to call them to mind?  For, pressed as I am in this office of dignity by a crowd of secular occupations, I see myself to be of those of whom it is written, <i>While they were being raised up thou didst cast them down</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018">Psa. 73.18</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p6.7"></a> <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">1302</font></a>
 ).  For he said not, Thou didst cast them down after they had been raised up, but while they were being raised up; because all bad men fall inwardly, while through the support of temporal dignity they seem outwardly to rise.  Wherefore their very raising up is their fall, because, while they rely on false glory, they are emptied of true glory.  Hence, again, he says, <i>Consuming away as smoke shall they consume away</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020">Psa. 37.20</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p7.1"></a> <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">1303</font></a>
 ).  For smoke in rising consumes away, and in extending itself vanishes.  And so indeed it comes to pass when present felicity accompanies the life of a sinner, since whereby he is shewn to be exalted, thereby it is brought about that he should cease to be.  Hence, again, it is written, <i>My <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p8.1"></a>God</span>, make them like a wheel</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013">Psa. 83.13</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p8.2"></a> <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">1304</font></a>
 ).  For a wheel is lifted up in its hinder parts, and in its fore parts falls.  But to us the things that are behind are the goods of the present world, which we leave behind us; but the things that are before are those which are eternal and permanent, to which we are called, as Paul bears witness, saying, <i>Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013">Phil. iii. 13</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p9.1"></a>).  The sinner, therefore, when he is advanced in the present life, is made to be as a wheel, since, while falling in the things which are before, he is lifted up in the things which are behind.  For, when he enjoys in this life the glory which he must leave behind, he falls from that which comes after this life.  There are indeed many who know how so to control their outward advancement as by no means to fall inwardly thereby.  Whence it is written, <i><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p9.2"></a>God</span> casteth not away the mighty, seeing that He also Himself is mighty</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005">Job xxxvi. 5</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p9.3"></a>).  And it is said through Solomon,   <a name="page_76b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.i.v-Page_76b"></a><i>A man of understanding shall possess governments</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005">Prov. i. 5</a><a name="iii.v.i.v-p9.4"></a>).  But to me these things are difficult, since they are also exceedingly burdensome; and what the mind has not received willingly it does not control fitly.  Lo, our most serene <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.v-p9.5"></a>Lord</span> the Emperor has ordered an ape to be made a lion.  And, indeed, in virtue of his order it can be called a lion, but a lion it cannot be made.  Wherefore his Piety must needs himself take the blame of all my faults and short-comings, having committed a ministry of power to a weak agent.</p>
