 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xxiii-p4"></a>We were glad to receive thine own and thy congregations petition, and accede to thy requests, in accordance with the statutes of the Fathers and with form of law.  For to our brother and fellow-bishop Castorius a letter has been sent by our order, whereby we have taken away entirely from him and his successors all power to harm thy monastery; so that neither may he any longer come among you to be a burden to you, nor schedules be made of the property of the monastery, nor any public procession <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1443</font></a>
  take place there; this only jurisdiction being still left to him, that he must ordain in the place of a deceased abbot another whom the common consent of the congregation may have chosen as worthy.  But now, these things being thus accomplished, be you diligent in the work of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxiii-p5.1"></a>God</span>, and assiduously devote yourselves to prayer, lest you should seem not so much to have sought security of mind for prayer, as to have wished to escape strict episcopal control over you while living amiss.</p>
