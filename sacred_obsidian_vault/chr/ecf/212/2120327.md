 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xxv-p2"></a>To Peter, Bishop of Terracina.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xxv-p3"></a>Gregory to Peter, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xxv-p4"></a>Joseph, a Jew, the bearer of these presents, has informed us that, the Jews dwelling in the camp of Terracina having been accustomed to assemble in a certain place for celebrating their festivities, thy Fraternity had expelled them thence, and that they had migrated, and this with thy knowledge and consent, to another place for in like manner observing their festivities; and now they complain that they have been expelled anew from this same place.  But, if it is so, we desire thy Fraternity to abstain from giving cause of complaint of this kind, and that they be allowed, as has been the custom, to assemble in the place which, as we have already said, they had obtained with thy knowledge for their place of meeting.  For those who dissent from the Christian religion must needs be gathered together to unity of faith by gentleness, kindness, admonition, persuasion, lest those whom the sweetness of preaching and the anticipated terror of future judgment might have invited to believe should be repelled by threats and terrors.  It is right, then, that they should come together kindly to hear the word of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxv-p4.1"></a>God</span> from you rather than that they should become afraid of overstrained austerity.</p>
