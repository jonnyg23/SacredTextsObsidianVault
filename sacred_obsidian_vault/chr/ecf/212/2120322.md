 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p1.1"></a>Epistle XXVII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p2"></a>To Anastasius, Archbishop of Corinth.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p3"></a>Gregory to Anastasius, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p4"></a>In proportion as the judgments of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p4.1"></a>God</span> are unsearchable ought they to be an object of fear to human apprehension; so that mortal reason, being unable to comprehend them, may of necessity bow under them the neck of a humble heart, to the end that it may follow with the minds obedient steps where the will of the Ruler may lead.  I, then, considering that my infirmity cannot reach to the height of the apostolic See, had rather have declined this burden, lest, having pastoral rule, I should succumb in action through inadequate administration.  But, since it is not for us to go against the will of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p4.2"></a>Lord</span> who disposes all, I obediently followed the way in which it pleased the merciful hand of the Ruler to deal with me.  For it was necessary that your Fraternity should be informed, even though the present opportunity had not occurred, how the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p4.3"></a>Lord</span> had vouchsafed that I, however unworthy, should preside over the apostolic See.  Since, then, reason required this to be done, and an opportunity having occurred through our sending to you the bearer of these presents, that is, Boniface the guardian (<i>defensorem</i>), we are careful not only to offer to your Fraternity by letter the good wishes of charity, but also to inform you of our ordination, as we believe you would wish us to do.  Wherefore let your Charity, by a letter in reply, cause us to rejoice for the unity of the Church and the acceptable news of your own welfare; to the end that our bodily absence from each other, which distance of place causes us to endure, may become as presence through interchange of letters.  We exhort you, also, since we have despatched the above-mentioned   <a name="page_83b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.i.xx-Page_83b"></a>bearer of these presents on certain necessary business to the feet of the most clement prince, and since the mutability of the time is wont to generate many hindrances on the way, that your priestly affection would bestow upon him whatever may be necessary either in provision for his journey by land or in procuring for him the means of navigation, that through <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xx-p4.4"></a>Gods</span> mercy, he may be able the more quickly to accomplish his intended journey.</p>
