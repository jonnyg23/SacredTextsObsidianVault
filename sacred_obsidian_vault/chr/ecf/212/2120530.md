 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p1.1"></a>Epistle LXV.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p2"></a>To Mauricius, Emperor.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p3"></a>Gregory to Mauricius Augustus.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p4"></a>Amidst the cares of warfare and innumerable anxieties which you sustain in your unwearied zeal for the government of the Christian republic, it is a great cause of joy to me along with the whole world that your Piety ever watches over custody of the faith whereby the empire of our lords is resplendent.  Whence I fully trust that, as you guard the causes of God with the love of a religious mind, so <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p4.1"></a>God</span> guards and aids yours with the grace of His Majesty.  Now after what manner the serenity of your Piety, out of regard to righteousness and zeal for the purest religion, has been moved against the most flagitious pravity of the Donatists, the tenor of the commands which you have sent most clearly shews.  But the most reverend bishops who have come from the African province assert that these have been so disregarded through ill-advised connivance that neither is the judgment of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p4.2"></a>God</span> held in fear there, nor are the imperial commands so far carried into effect; adding also this:  that in the aforesaid province, through the bribes of the Donatists prevailing, the Catholic faith is publicly let to sale.  But on the other hand the glorious Gennadius <a name="fr_1680"></a><a href="#fn_1680"><font size="1">1681</font></a>
  has likewise complained of one of those who made such complaints:  and two others also have borne like testimony with him on the subject.  But, inasmuch as in this case a secular judge was concerned, I have thought it right to send these bishops to the footsteps of your Piety, that they may represent in person to your most serene ears what they declare themselves to have endured for the catholic faith.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xliv-p6"></a>For these reasons I beseech the Christianity of my lords, for the weal of their souls and life of their most pious offspring, to give orders by a strict mandate for the punishment of such as you find to be such as have been described, and to arrest with the hand of rescue the ruin of those who are perishing, and to apply the medicine of correction to insane minds, and cure them of the poisonous bite of error; that so, the darkness of pestiferous pravity having been driven away by the remedy of your provision, and the true faith having shed abroad in those parts the rays of its serenity, heavenly triumph may await you before the eyes of our Redeemer, because whomsoever you defend outwardly from the enemy, them you also set free inwardly from the poison of diabolical fraud; which is a still more glorious thing.</p>
