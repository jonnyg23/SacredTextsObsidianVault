 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.v.iii-p2"></a>To Dominicus, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.v.iii-p3"></a>Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of Carthage.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.iii-p4"></a>Prosper your delegate (<i>responsalis</i>), the bearer of these presents, has been with us, and after other expressions of your charity handed us your second letters with an allegation of the imperial commands, and a paper giving an account of the synod that has been held among you <a name="fr_1577"></a><a href="#fn_1577"><font size="1">1578</font></a>
 .  Having read all, we rejoiced for your pastoral zeal, and that our most pious lords had given no ear to the calumnies of venal persons brought against you on the plea of religion; but especially that your Fraternity has so taken pains to preserve the African province as in no wise to neglect to restrain with priestly fervour the devious sects of heretics; concerning the quieting of whom we remember having laid down the law so fully, even before consulting the letters of your Charity, that we do not believe that anything needs to be said again in reply to you about them.  Although, however, this is so, and though we desire all heretics to be repressed always with vigour and reason by catholic priests, yet, on looking thoroughly into what has been done among you, we are in fact apprehensive lest offence should thereby be caused (which thing may the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.iii-p5.1"></a>Lord</span> avert) to the primates of other councils.  For at the conclusion of your acts you have promulged a sentence, in which, while ordering the searching out of those heretics, you have brought in that those who neglect the duty are to be punished by forfeiture of their possessions and dignities.  It is therefore best, most dear brother, that, in dealing with matters outside ourselves that require correction, charity among ourselves should first be preserved, and that we should be subject in mind (as I judge to be peculiarly proper to your Gravity) even to persons below us in dignity.  For you will then more advantageously meet the errors of heretics with your whole united powers when, as befits your priesthood, you study to keep ecclesiastical concord among yourselves.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.v.iii-p5"></a> This had been a synod held at Carthage for the suppression of the Donatists.  Cf. I. 74, note 8.  Gregory, while fully approving, as he shows elsewhere, of strict enforcement of the imperial laws against them, expresses fear in this epistle lest the council lately held might have gone too far, so as to endanger the unity of the African Church, in exceeding the decrees of synods that had been held elsewhere, and especially in ordering severe measures against bishops or others who might be remiss in the work of suppressing heresy.</p>
