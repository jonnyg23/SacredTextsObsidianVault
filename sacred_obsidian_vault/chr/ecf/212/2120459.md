 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.v.v-p2"></a>To John, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.v.v-p3"></a>Gregory to John, Bishop of Ravenna.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.v-p4"></a>I find that your Fraternity is greatly distressed on account of being forbidden by the censure of reason to wear the pallium in litanies.  But through the most excellent Patrician, and through the most eminent Prefect, and through other noble men of your city, you have urgently requested to have this allowed you.  Now we, having made careful enquiry of Adeodatus, some time thy Fraternitys deacon, have ascertained that it was never the custom of thy predecessors to use the pallium during litanies, except at the solemnities of the blessed John the Baptist, the blessed Apostle Peter, and the blessed martyr Apollinaris.  But we were by no means bound to believe him, since many of our delegates have often been at your Fraternitys city, who declare that they never saw anything of the kind.  And in this matter credence is rather to be given to many than to one, who is attesting something in behalf of his own Church.  But, since we do not wish your Fraternity to be distressed, or the petition of our sons to be of no avail with us, we concede the use of the pallium, until we shall gain some more accurate knowledge, on the days of the Nativity of the Blessed John the Baptist, of the blessed Apostle Peter, and the blessed martyr Apollinaris, and on the day of the celebration of your ordination.  But in the sacristy, according to former custom, after the sons of the Church have been received and dismissed, your Fraternity may put on the pallium, and so proceed to the solemnization of mass, arrogating to yourself nothing more in the daring of rash presumption; lest, while something is snatched at out of order in exterior habiliment, what might have been done in due order be neglected.  Given in the month of October; Indiction 13.</p>
