 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p1.1"></a>Epistle LVII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p2"></a><i>From John, Bishop of Ravenna to Pope Gregory</i> <a name="fr_1506"></a><a href="#fn_1506"><font size="1">1507</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p4"></a>My most reverend fellow-servant Castorius, notary of your Apostolical See, has delivered to me my <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p4.1"></a>Lords</span> epistle, compounded of honey and of venom; which has yet so infixed its stings as still to leave place for healing appliances.  For my <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p4.2"></a>Lord</span>, while he reproves pride and speaks of divine judgment following it, in a certain way professes himself with reason to be mild and placid.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p5"></a>You have alleged, then, that I, ambitious of novelty, have usurped the use of the pallium beyond what had been indulged to my predecessors.  This let not the conscience of my own lord, which is governed by the divine right hand, in any way allow itself to believe; nor let him open his most sacred ears to the uncertainty of common report.  First, because I, though a sinner, still know how grave a thing it is to transgress the limits assigned to us by the Fathers, and that all elation leads to nothing but a fall.  For, if our ancestors did not tolerate pride in kings, how much more is it not to be endured in priests!  Then, I remember how I was nourished in the lap and in the bosom of your most holy Roman Church, and therein by the aid of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p5.1"></a>God</span> advanced.  And how should I be so daring as to presume to oppose that most holy see, which transmits its laws to the universal Church, for maintaining whose authority, as <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p5.2"></a>God</span> knows, I have seriously excited the ill-will of many enemies   <a name="page_139b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-Page_139b"></a>against myself?  But let not my most blessed lord suppose that I have attempted anything contrary to ancient custom, as is attested by many and nearly all the citizens of this city, and as the above-written most reverend notary, even though he had taken no part in the proceedings, might have testified, inasmuch as it was not till the sons of the Church were descending from the sacristy <a name="fr_1507"></a><a href="#fn_1507"><font size="1">1508</font></a>
 , and the deacons were coming in for proceeding immediately [to the altar] that the first deacon has been accustomed to invest the bishop of the Church of Ravenna with the pallium, which he has also been accustomed in like manner to use in solemn litanies.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p7"></a>Wherefore let no one endeavour to insinuate anything against me to my lord, since if any one wishes to do so, he cannot prove that any novelty has been introduced by me.  For in what manner I have obeyed your commands and served your interests when cause required, may Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p7.1"></a>God</span> make manifest to your most sincere heart:  and I attribute it to my sins that after so many labours and difficulties which I endure within and without I should deserve to experience such a change.  But again this among other things consoles me, that most holy fathers sometimes chastise their sons for the purpose only of advancing them the more, and that, after this devotion and satisfaction, you will not only conserve to the holy Church of Ravenna her ancient privileges, but even confer greater ones in your own times.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p8"></a>For with respect to the napkins, the use of which by my presbyters and deacons your Apostleship alleges to be a presumption, I confess in truth that it irks me to say anything on the subject, since the truth by itself, which alone prevails with my lord, is sufficient.  For this being allowed to the smaller churches constituted around the city, the apostleship of my lord will also be able in all ways to find, if he deigns to enquire of the venerable clergy of his own first Apostolical See, that as often as priests or levites of the Church of Ravenna have come to Rome for the ordination of bishops or for business, they all have <i>proceeded</i> <a name="fr_1508"></a><a href="#fn_1508"><font size="1">1509</font></a>
  with napkins before the eyes of your most holy predecessors without any blame.  Wherefore also at the time when I, sinner as I am, was ordained there by your predecessor, all my presbyters and deacons used them while <i>proceeding</i> <a name="fr_1509"></a><a href="#fn_1509"><font size="1">1510</font></a>
  in attendance on the lord pope.  And since our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p10.1"></a>God</span> in His providence has placed all things in your hand and most pure conscience, I adjure you by the very Apostolical See, which you formerly adorned by your character, and now govern with due dignity, that you in no respect diminish on account of my deservings the privileges of the Church of Ravenna, which is intimately yours; but, even according to the voice of prophecy, let it be laid upon me and upon my fathers house, according to its deserving.  I have, therefore, for your greater satisfaction, subjoined all the privileges which have been indulged by your predecessors to the holy Church of Ravenna, though none the less finding assurance in your venerable archives in reference to the times of the consecration of my predecessors.  But now whatever, after ascertaining the truth, you may command to be done, is in <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p10.2"></a>Gods</span> power and yours; since I, desiring to obey the commands of my lords Apostleship, have taken care, notwithstanding ancient custom, to abstain till I receive further orders.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxix-p3"></a> See <i>Ep</i>. 56.  John of Ravenna, notwithstanding his obsequious language in this letter, appears to have been by no means disposed to give way.  For see Gregorys subsequent letter to him (V. 15), in which he is sharply accused of duplicity.  And not only he, but his successor in the see also, appear to have continued the practice of wearing the pallium in public processions.  What he says in the letter before us of his having incurred odium by his defence of the authority of the Roman See may be noted as significant of some jealousy of such authority at Ravenna.</p>
