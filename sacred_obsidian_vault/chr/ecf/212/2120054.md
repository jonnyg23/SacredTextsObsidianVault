 </p><p class="c23"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p1"></a> <span class="c16"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p1.1"></a>Letter XLIV.</span></p>  
 <p class="c26"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p2"></a><span class="c4"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p2.1"></a>To Theodosius Augustus.</span></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p3"></a>Leo, the bishop, and the holy Synod which is assembled at Rome to Theodosius Augustus.</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p4"></a>I.  <i>He exposes the unscrupulous nature of the proceedings at Ephesus.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p5"></a>From your clemencys letter, which in your love of the catholic Faith you sent sometime ago to the see of the blessed Apostle Peter, we drew such confidence in your defence of truth and peace that we thought nothing harmful could happen in so plain and well-ordered a matter; especially when those who were sent to the episcopal council, which you ordered to be held at Ephesus, were so fully instructed that, if the bishop of Alexandria had allowed the letters, which they brought either to the holy synod or to Flavian the bishop, to be read in the ears of the bishops, by the declaration of the most pure Faith, which being Divinely inspired we both have received and hold, all noise of disputings would have been so completely hushed that neither ignorance could any longer disport itself, nor jealousy find occasion to do mischief.  But because private interests are consulted under cover of religion, the disloyalty of a few has wrought that which must wound the whole Church.  For not from some untrustworthy messenger, but from a most faithful narrator of the things which have been done, Hilary, our deacon, who, lest he should be compelled by force to subscribe to their proceedings, with great difficulty made his escape, we have learnt that a great many priests came together at the synod, whose numbers would doubtless have assisted the debate and decision, if he who claimed for himself the chief place had consented to maintain priestly moderation, in order that, according to custom, when all had freely expressed their opinion, after quiet and fair deliberation, that might be ordained which was both agreeable to the Faith and helpful to those in error.  But we have been told that all who had come were not present at the actual decision:  for we have learnt that some were rejected while others were admitted, who at the aforesaid priests requisition surrendered themselves to an unrighteous subscription, knowing they would suffer harm unless they obeyed his commands, and that such a resolution was brought forward by him that in attacking one man he might wreak his fury of the whole Church.  Which our delegates from the Apostolic See saw to be so blasphemous and opposed to the catholic Faith that no pressure could force them to assent; for in the same synod they stoutly protested, as they ought, that the Apostolic See would never receive what was being passed:  since the whole mystery of the Christian Faith is absolutely destroyed (which Heaven forfend in your Graces reign), unless this abominable wickedness, which exceeds all former blasphemies, be abolished.</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p6"></a>II.  <i>And entreats the Emperor to help in reversing their decision.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p7"></a>But because the devil with wicked subtlety deceives the unwary, and so mocks the imprudence of some by a show of piety as to persuade them to things harmful instead of profitable, we pray your Grace, renounce all complicity in this endangering of religion and Faith, and afford in the treatment of Divine things that which is granted in worldly matters by the equity of your laws, that human presumption may not do violence to Christs Gospel.  Behold, I, O most Christian and honoured Emperor, with my fellow-priests <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">372</font></a>
  fulfilling towards your revered clemency the offices of sincere love, and desiring you in all things to please <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p8.2"></a>God</span>, to whom prayers are offered for you by the Church, lest before   <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.xliv-Page_54"></a>the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p8.3"></a>Lord</span> Christs tribunal we be judged guilty for our silence,—we beseech you in the presence of the Undivided Trinity of the One Godhead, Whom such an act wrongs (for He is Himself the Guardian and the Author of your empire), and in the presence of Christs holy angels, order everything to be in the position in which they were before the decision until a larger number of priests be assembled from the whole world.  Suffer not yourself to be weighted with anothers sin because (and we must say it) we are afraid lest He, Whose religion is being destroyed, be provoked to wrath.  Keep before your eyes, and with all your mental vision gaze reverently upon the blessed Peters glory, and the crowns which all the Apostles have in common with him and the palms of all the martyrs, who had no other reason for suffering than the confession of the true Godhead and the true Manhood in Christ.</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p9"></a>III.  <i>He asks for a Council in Italy.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p10"></a>And because this mystery is now being impiously opposed by a few ignorant persons, all the churches of our parts, and all the priests entreat your clemency, with groans and tears seeing that our delegates faithfully protested, and bishop Flavian gave them an appeal in writing, to order a general synod to be held in Italy, which shall either dismiss or appease all disputes in such a way that there be nothing any longer either doubtful in the Faith or divided in love, and to it, of course, the bishops of the Eastern provinces must come, and if any of them were overcome by threats and injury, and deviated from the path of truth, they may be fully restored by health-giving measures, and they themselves, whose case is harder, if they acquiesce in wiser counsels, may not fall from the unity of the Church.  And how necessary this request is after the lodging of an appeal is witnessed by the canonical decrees passed at Nicæa by the bishops of the whole world, which are added below <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">373</font></a>
 .  Show favour to the catholics after your own and your parents custom.  Give us such liberty to defend the catholic Faith as no violence, no fear of the world, while your revered clemency is safe, shall be able to take away.  For it is the cause not only of the Church but of your Kingdom and prosperity that we plead, that you may enjoy the peaceful sway of your provinces.  Defend the Church in unshaken peace against the heretics, that your empire also may be defended by Christs right hand.  Dated the 13th of October, in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p8"></a> <i>Cum consacerdotibus meis</i>.  The Gk. version here reads the singular (<span class="Greek"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p8.1"></a>μετὰ τοῦ συλλειτουργοῦ μου</span>).  This, if intentional and not a slip, is, I suppose, Flavian, of whose death Leo was not yet apprized.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.iv.xliv-p11"></a> Both Quesnel and the Ball. agree that the Canon here quoted by Leo really belongs not to the Nicene collection, but to that of Sardica (about 344), in which it stands as no. 4.  (Exactly the same mistake is made in Letter LVI., where Galla Placidia Augusta quotes Canon 5 of Sardica to Theodosius as <i>secundum definitiones Nicœni concilii</i>).  Cf. Gores Leo, pp. 113, 114.  The wording of this fourth Canon is as follows:  “Gaudentius, the bishop said, If it please you to add to this admirable declaration which you have passed, I propose that whensoever one bishop has been deposed by the judgment of other bishops, and appeals for his case to be heard in <i>Civitas Novorum</i>, the other bishop cannot by any means be considered confirmed in the same See after the appeal of the one who appears to be deposed, until he receive the decision of the judges there.”  In applying this to the present case, Leo no doubt proposed to substitute <i>Urbs Roma</i> for <i>Civitas Novorum</i> , though this was hardly the same thing.</p>
