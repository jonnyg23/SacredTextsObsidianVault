 <p> <a name="iii.v.vii.ix"></a>
 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p1.1"></a>Epistle XV.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p2"></a>To George, Presbyter.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p3"></a>Gregory to George, Presbyter, and to Theodore, deacon, of the Church of Constantinople.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p4"></a>Mindful of your goodness and charity, I greatly blame myself, that I gave you leave to return so soon:  but, since I saw you pressing me importunately once and again for leave to go, I considered that it might be a serious matter for your Love to tarry with us longer.  But, after I had learnt that you had lingered so long on your journey owing to the winter season, I confess that I was sorry that you had been sent away so soon.  For, if your Love was unable to accomplish your intended journey, it had been better that you had lingered with me than away from me.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5"></a>Moreover, after your departure I learnt from information given me by my most beloved sons the deacons that your Love had said that our Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.1"></a>Lord</span> and Saviour Jesus Christ, when He descended into hell, saved all who there acknowledged Him as <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.2"></a>God</span>, and delivered them from the pains due to them.  With regard to this subject I desire that your Charity should think very differently.  For, when He descended into hell, He delivered through His grace those only who both believed that He should come and observed His precepts in their lives.  For it is evident that after the incarnation of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.3"></a>Lord</span> no one can be saved, even of those who hold His faith, who have not the life of faith; since it is written, <i>They acknowledge that they know <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.4"></a>God</span>, but in deeds they deny Him</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016">Tit. i. 16</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.5"></a>).  And John says, <i>He that saith that he knows Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004">1 John ii. 4</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.6"></a>).  James also, the brother of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.7"></a>Lord</span>, writes saying, <i>Faith without works is dead</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020">Jam. ii. 20</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.8"></a>).  If, then, believers now are not saved without good works, while the unbelieving and reprobate without good action were saved by our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.9"></a>Lord</span> descending into hell, then the lot of those who never saw the incarnation of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.10"></a>Lord</span> was better than that of these who have been born after the mystery of His incarnation.  But what fatuity it argues to say or think this the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.11"></a>Lord</span> Himself testifies to His disciples, when He says, <i>Many kings and prophets have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017">Matt. 13:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024">Luke 10:24</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.12"></a>).  But, that I may not   <a name="page_217b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vii.ix-Page_217b"></a>detain your Love with argument of my own, learn what Philaster, in the book which he wrote about heresies, says about this heresy.  His words are these; “They are heretics who say that the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.13"></a>Lord</span> descended into hell, and announced himself after death to all who were already there, so that in acknowledging Him there they might be saved; seeing that this is contrary to the prophet David where he says, <i>But in hell who shall acknowledge thee</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006">Ps. vi. 6</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.14"></a>)?  And to the Apostle; <i>As many as have sinned without law shall perish without law</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012">Rom. ii. 12</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.15"></a>).”  And with his words the blessed Augustine also agrees in the book which he wrote about heresies.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6"></a>Considering, therefore, all these things, hold ye nothing but what the true faith teaches through the Catholic Church: namely, that the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.1"></a>Lord</span> in descending into hell rescued from infernal durance those only whom while living in the flesh He preserved through His grace in faith and good conduct.  For in that which He says in the Gospel, <i>When I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to myself</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032">John xii. 32</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.2"></a>), He means all that are elect.  For one could not be drawn to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.3"></a>God</span> after death who had separated himself from <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.4"></a>God</span> by evil living.  May Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.5"></a>God</span> keep you under His protection, that, wherever ye are, ye may feel in soul and body the aid of His grace.</p>
