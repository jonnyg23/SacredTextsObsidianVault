 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p2"></a>To Brunichild, Queen of the Franks.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p3"></a>Gregory to Brunichild, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p4"></a>The Christianity of your Excellence has been so truly known to us of old that we do not in the least doubt of your goodness, but rather hold it to be in all ways certain that you will devoutly and zealously concur with us in the cause of faith, and supply most abundantly the succour of your religious sincerity.  Being for this reason well assured, and greeting you with paternal charity, we inform you that it has come to our knowledge how that the nation of the Angli, by <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p4.1"></a>Gods</span> permission, is  <a name="page_206b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vi.xl-Page_206b"></a>desirous of becoming Christian, but that the priests who are in their neighbourhood have no pastoral solicitude with regard to them.  And lest their souls should haply perish in eternal damnation, it has been our care to send to them the bearer of these presents, Augustine the servant of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p4.2"></a>God</span>, whose zeal and earnestness are well known to us, with other servants of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p4.3"></a>God</span>; that through them we might be able to learn their wishes, and, as far as is possible, you also striving with us, to take thought for their conversion.  We have also charged them that for carrying out this design they should take with them presbyters from the neighbouring regions.  Let, then, your Excellency, habitually prone to good works, on account as well of our request as of regard to the fear of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p4.4"></a>God</span>, deign to hold him as in all ways commended to you, and earnestly bestow on him the favour of your protection, and lend the aid of your patronage to his labour and, that he may have the fullest fruit thereof, provide for his going secure under your protection to the above-written nation of the Angli, to the end that our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p4.5"></a>God</span>, who has adorned you in this world with good qualities well-pleasing to Him, may cause you to give thanks here and in eternal rest with His saints.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xl-p5"></a>Furthermore, commending to your Christianity our beloved son Candidus, presbyter and <i>rector</i> of the patrimony of our Church which is situated in your parts, we beg that he may in all things obtain the favour of your protection.</p>
