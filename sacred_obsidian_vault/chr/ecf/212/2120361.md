 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.ii.vi-p3"></a>Gregory to Castorius, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.vi-p4"></a>The illustrious lady Timothea has intimated to us by a petitionary notification, as is set forth below, that she has founded an oratory within the city of Ariminum in a place belonging to her, which she desires to have consecrated in honour of the holy cross.  And, accordingly, dearest brother, if the said construction is in the jurisdiction of thy city, and if it is known that no body has been buried there, then, after reception in the first place of a legitimate endowment, that is, of two-thirds of her whole property (excepting slaves), of her movables and fixtures and live stock, the usufract being reserved to her for her life, and such endowment having been secured by municipal deeds, thou wilt solemnly consecrate the aforesaid oratory without any public mass, on the condition that no baptistery shall be constructed in the same place in future times, and that thou appoint not a cardinal presbyter <a name="fr_1402"></a><a href="#fn_1402"><font size="1">1403</font></a>
 .  And if perchance she should prefer having masses said there, let her know that she must ask thy Love for a presbyter, to the end nothing else may be presumed by any other priest whatever.  Further, thou wilt reverently deposit the holy things <a name="fr_1403"></a><a href="#fn_1403"><font size="1">1404</font></a>
  she has provided.</p>
