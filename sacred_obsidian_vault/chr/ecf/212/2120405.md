 <p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iii.xix-p2"></a><i>To Sabinus, Guardian (Defensorem).</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xix-p3"></a>Gregory to Sabinus, Guardian of Sardinia.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xix-p4"></a>Certain serious matters having come to our ears which require canonical correction, we therefore charge thy Experience not to neglect to cause Januarius, our brother and fellow-bishop, together with John the notary, to appear before us with all speed, all excuses being laid aside, that in his presence what has been reported to us may be subjected to a thorough investigation.  Further, if the religious women Pompeiana and Theodosia, according to their request, should wish to come hither, afford them your succour in all ways, that they may be able, through your assistance, to accomplish their desires:  but especially be careful by all means to bring with you the most eloquent Isidore, as he has requested, that, the merits of his case which he is known to have against the Church of Caralis having been fully gone into, he may be able to have it legally terminated.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xix-p5"></a>Furthermore, some personal misdemeanours having been reported to us of the presbyter Epiphanius, it is necessary for you to investigate everything diligently, and to make haste to bring at the same time with you the women with whom he is said to have sinned, or others whom you suppose to know anything about the matter; that so the truth may be clearly laid open to the rigour of ecclesiastical discipline.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xix-p6"></a>Now you will take care to accomplish all these things so efficiently as to lay yourself open to no blame for negligence, knowing that it will be entirely at your peril if this our order should in any way be slackly executed.</p>
