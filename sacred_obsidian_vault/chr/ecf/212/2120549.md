 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p1.1"></a>Epistle XXVIII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p2"></a>To Theodore, Physician.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p3"></a>Gregory to Theodore, Physician at Constantinople.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p4"></a>My most beloved son the deacon Sabinianus <a name="fr_1708"></a><a href="#fn_1708"><font size="1">1709</font></a>
 , on his return to me, brought me no letter from your Glory; but he conveyed hither what had been sent for the poor and captives; whence I understood the reason.  It was that you would not speak by letters to a man, having by a good deed made your address to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.1"></a>God</span>.  For this same deed of yours has a voice of its own, which calls to the secret ears of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.2"></a>God</span>, as it is written, <i>Hide thy alms in the bosom of the poor, and it shall entreat for thee</i> (<a href="../../../bib/apo/sir029.htm#015">Ecclesiasticus 29.15</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.3"></a>).  And indeed to me, I confess, it is sad to expend what is not my own, and to add to the accounts which I keep of the substance of the Church those also of the property of my most sweet son the lord Theodore.  And yet I rejoice with your benignity that you carefully attend to and observe what the Truth says; <i>Give alms, and behold, all things are clean unto you</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041">Luke xi. 41</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.4"></a>); and this which is written, <i>Even as water quencheth fire, so alms quench sin</i> (<a href="../../../bib/apo/sir003.htm#033">Ecclesiasticus 3.33</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.5"></a>).  Paul the apostle also says, <i>Let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be a supply to your want</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014">2 Cor. viii. 14</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.6"></a>).  Tobias admonishes his son, saying, <i>If thou hast much, give abundantly; but if thou hast little, of that little impart willingly</i> (<a href="../../../bib/apo/tob004.htm#009">Tob. iv. 9</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.7"></a>).  You therefore observe all these precepts:  but we beg you to pray for us, lest we should dispense the fruits of your labours indiscreetly, and not as need requires; lest from that whereby you diminish sins we should heap up sins.  Now may Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p5.8"></a>God</span> keep you under His protection, and so grant you human favour in an earthly court as to bring you after a long life to the eternal joys of a heavenly court.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.xvii-p6"></a>We send you as the benediction of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, whom you greatly love, a key from his most sacred body, in which is enclosed iron from his chains, that what bound his neck for martyrdom, may loose yours from all sins.</p>
