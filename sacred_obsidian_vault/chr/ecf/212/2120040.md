 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxx-p3"></a>Much shorter than, but to nearly the same effect as, xxxi., which was written on the same day as this.  As xxx. has a Greek translation accompanying it and is duly dated, whereas xxxi. has neither, the Ballerinii would seem to be correct in thinking that xxx. was despatched but did not reach Pulcheria (cf. Lett. xlv. i.) and that xxxi. was for some reason never used.  Of the two we have printed xxxi. by preference, as being the fuller discussion of the subject.</p>
