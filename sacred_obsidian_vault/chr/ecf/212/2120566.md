 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.viii.v-p2"></a>To Amos, Patriarch of Jerusalem.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.viii.v-p3"></a>Gregory to Amos, Bishop of Jerusalem.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii.v-p4"></a>Being confident that your Fraternity pays regard to the ordinances of the canons and the vigour of discipline, lest the falseness of one of your clerics should succeed in imposing on you so as to escape the strictness of ecclesiastical order, we have thought it right to inform you of his fault, that through your solicitude he may be subjected to the discipline from which he has fled.  We understand, then, that Peter, an acolyte, whom we had caused to serve under our son the deacon Sabinianus, our ecclesiastical representative in the royal city, has fled, and resorted to your Church.  If this is true, let your Fraternity be at pains to secure him, and send him back hither when   <a name="page_234b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 234b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.viii.v-Page_234b"></a>an opportunity occurs.  But if by chance, fearing this, he shall have departed from your Church, and be lurking in various places to escape detection, order him to be diligently sought for in all your parishes, and, when found, send him back to us, as we have before said.  And we desire also to notify through you that he is deprived of communion:  nor let him dare to receive the mysteries of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.v-p4.1"></a>Lords</span> body and blood until he shall return to us, unless by chance he should be in imminent peril of death.</p>
