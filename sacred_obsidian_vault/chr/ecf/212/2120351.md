 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xlix-p2"></a>To All the Bishops of Numidia.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xlix-p3"></a>Gregory to all the Bishops of Numidia.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xlix-p4"></a>If ever, most dear brethren in Christ, a troublesome mixture of tares intrudes itself among green corn, it is necessary for the hand of the husbandman to root it up entirely, lest the future fruit of the fertile corn should be obstructed.  Wherefore let us too, who, however unworthy, have undertaken the cultivation of the field of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlix-p4.1"></a>Lord</span>, hasten to render the corn pure from all offence of tares, that the field of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlix-p4.2"></a>Lord</span> may fructify with more abundant increase.  Now you requested through Hilarus our chartulary <a name="fr_1388"></a><a href="#fn_1388"><font size="1">1389</font></a>
  from our predecessor of blessed memory that you might retain all the customs of past time, which, from the beginnings of the ordinances of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, long antiquity has so far retained.  And we, indeed, according to the tenour of your representation, allow your custom (so long as it clearly makes no claim to the prejudice of the catholic faith) to remain undisturbed, whether as to constituting primates or as to other points; save that with respect to those who attain to the episcopate from among the Donatists, we by all means forbid them to be advanced to the dignity of primacy, even though their standing should denote them for that position <a name="fr_1389"></a><a href="#fn_1389"><font size="1">1390</font></a>
 .  But let it suffice them to take care of the people committed to them, without aiming at the topmost place of the primacy in preference to those prelates whom the Catholic faith hath both taught and engendered in the bosom of the Church.  Do you, therefore, most dear brethren, anticipate our admonitions in the zeal of the charity of the Lord, knowing that the strict Judge will bring into examination all we do, and will approve every one of us with regard not to the prerogative of a higher rank, but to the merits of our works.  I beseech you, therefore, love ye one another mutually, having peace among yourselves in Christ, and with one purpose of heart oppose ye heretics and enemies of the Church.  Be ye solicitous for the souls of your neighbours:  persuade all ye can to faith by the preaching of charity, holding before them also the terror of the future judgment; inasmuch as ye are appointed to be shepherds, and the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlix-p6.1"></a>Lord</span> of the flocks expects from the shepherds to whom He has committed them the fruit of a multiplied flock.  And if He should foresee an augmentation of His own flock through your bestowal of more diligent care upon it, He will assuredly adorn you with manifold gifts of the heavenly kingdom.  Furthermore, addressing to you the greeting of fraternal love, I pray the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlix-p6.2"></a>Lord</span> that He would make you, whom He has chosen to be shepherds of souls, worthy in His sight, and Himself so order our deeds here that He may accept them as they deserve in the future life.</p>
