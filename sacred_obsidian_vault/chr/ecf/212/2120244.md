 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.ii.xi-p2"></a>What manner of man ought to come to rule.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.ii.xi-p3"></a>That man, therefore, ought by all means to be drawn with cords to be an example of good living who already lives spiritually, dying to all passions of the flesh; who disregards worldly prosperity; who is afraid of no adversity; who desires only inward wealth; whose intention the body, in good accord with it, thwarts not at all by its frailness, nor the spirit greatly by its disdain:  one who is not led to covet the things of others, but gives freely of his own; who through the bowels of compassion is quickly moved to pardon, yet is never bent down from the fortress of rectitude by pardoning more than is meet; who perpetrates no unlawful deeds, yet deplores those perpetrated by others as though they were his own; who out of affection of heart sympathizes with anothers infirmity, and so rejoices in the good of his neighbour as though it were his own advantage; who so insinuates himself as an example to others in all he does that among them he has nothing, at any rate of his own past deeds, to blush for; who studies so to live that he may be able to water even dry hearts with the streams of doctrine; who has already learnt by the use and trial of prayer that he can obtain what he has requested from the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.ii.xi-p3.1"></a>Lord</span>, having had already said to him, as it were, through the voice of experience, <i>While thou art yet speaking, I will say, Here am I</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000">Isa. 1:0</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009">Isa. 58:9</a><a name="iii.iv.ii.xi-p3.2"></a>).  For if perchance any one should come to us asking us to intercede for him with some great man, who was incensed against him, but to us unknown, we should at once reply, We cannot go to intercede for you, since we have no familiar acquaintance with that man.  If, then, a man blushes to become an intercessor with another man on whom he has no claim, with what idea can any one grasp the post of intercession with <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.ii.xi-p3.3"></a>God</span> for the people, who does not know himself to be in favour with Him through the merit of his own life?  And how can he ask of Him pardon for others while ignorant whether towards himself He is appeased?  And in this matter there is yet another thing to be more anxiously feared; namely, lest one who is supposed to be competent to appease wrath should himself provoke it on account of guilt of his own.  For we all know well that, when one who is in disfavour is sent to intercede with an incensed person, the mind of the latter is provoked to greater severity.  Wherefore let one who is still tied and bound with earthly desires beware lest by more grievously incensing the strict judge, while he delights himself in his place of honour, he become the cause of ruin to his subordinates.</p>
