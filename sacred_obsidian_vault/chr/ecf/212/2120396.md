 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.x-p3"></a>Gregory to Maximianus, bishop of Syracuse</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.x-p4"></a>I wrote some time ago to your Fraternity desiring you to send to the Roman city those who had alleged anything against Gregory, bishop of the city of Agrigentum <a name="fr_1480"></a><a href="#fn_1480"><font size="1">1481</font></a>
 .  And we exhort you by this present epistle that this should be immediately done.  Wherefore hasten to send with speed the persons themselves, and the rest of the documents, that is the reports of proceedings and the petitions that have been given in.  Nor do we allow any delay or excuse to be sought; to the end that, when they have been sent, as we have said, with speed to the Roman city, we may know how, with the help of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.x-p5.1"></a>God</span>, we may most advantageously deal with him.</p>
