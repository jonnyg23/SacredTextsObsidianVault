 <p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.viii.iv-p2"></a><i>To various Metropolitans and Bishops</i> <a name="fr_1732"></a><a href="#fn_1732"><font size="1">1733</font></a>

 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.viii.iv-p4"></a>Gregory to Eusebius of Thessalonica, Urbitius of Dyracchium, Constantius ofMediolanum <i>(Milan</i>), Andrew of Nicopolis, John of Corinth, John of Prima Justiniana, John <i>Cretensi Scoritano</i>, John of Larissa, Marinianus of Ravenna, Januarius of Caralis (<i>Cagliari</i>) in Sardinia, and all the bishops of Sicily.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii.iv-p5"></a>I have taken care to transmit to your Fraternity the law which the most pious Emperor has issued, to the effect that such as are bound by engagements of military service or public liabilities, may not in any case, in order to escape risk of being called to account, assume the condition of ecclesiastics, or become monks:  and this I especially press upon you, that such as are involved in secular engagements are not to be received hastily among the clergy of the Church, since, while they live in an ecclesiastical condition no otherwise than they had lived before, they are by no means trying to escape secular affairs, but to change them.  But, if any such should even seek a monastery, they are by no means to be received unless they have first been absolved from their public liabilities.  Further, if any from the military order are in haste to become monks, they are not to be received rashly, or until their life has been fully enquired into.  And, according to the regular rule, they ought to undergo a probation of three years, and then, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.iv-p5.1"></a>God</span> granting it, assume the monastic habit.  And if they have thus been proved and accepted, and are anxious, for the good of their souls, to do penance for the sins they have committed, then, with a view to their heavenly life and gain, monastic profession should not be denied them.  With respect to this matter also, believe me, the most serene and most Christian Emperor is in every way pacified, and willingly allows the monastic profession of those whom he knows not to be implicated in public liabilities.  The Month of December, first Indiction.</p>
