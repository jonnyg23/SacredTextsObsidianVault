 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p1.1"></a>Epistle XXV.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p2"></a>To the Nobles and Proprietors in Sardinia.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p3"></a>Gregory to the Nobles, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p4"></a>I have learnt from the report of my brother and fellow-bishop Felix, and my son the servant of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p4.1"></a>God</span>, Cyriacus <a name="fr_1545"></a><a href="#fn_1545"><font size="1">1546</font></a>
 , that nearly all of you have peasants (<i>rusticos</i> <a name="fr_1546"></a><a href="#fn_1546"><font size="1">1547</font></a>
 ) on your estates given to idolatry.  And this has made me very sorry, since I know that the guilt of subjects weighs down the life of their superiors, and that, when sin in a subject is not corrected, sentence is flung back on those who are over them.  Wherefore, magnificent sons, I exhort that with all care and all solicitude ye be zealous for your souls, and see what account you will render to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p6.1"></a>God</span> for your subjects.  For indeed they have been committed to you for this end, that both they may serve for your advantage in earthly things, and you, through your care for them, may provide for their souls in the things that are eternal.  If, then, they pay what they owe you, why pay you not them what you owe them?  That is to say, your Greatness should assiduously admonish them, and restrain them from the error of idolatry, to the end that by their being drawn to the faith you may make Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p6.2"></a>God</span> propitious to yourselves.  For, lo, you observe how the end of this world is close at hand; you see that now a human, now a divine, sword rages against us:  and yet you, the worshippers of the true <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p6.3"></a>God</span>, behold stones adored by those who are committed to you, and are silent <a name="fr_1547"></a><a href="#fn_1547"><font size="1">1548</font></a>
 .  What, I pray you, will you say in the tremendous judgment, when you have received <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.1"></a>Gods</span> enemies into your power, and yet disdain to subdue them to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.2"></a>God</span> and recall them to Him?  Wherefore, addressing you with due greeting, I beg that your Greatness would be earnestly on the watch to give yourselves to zeal for <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.3"></a>God</span>, and hasten to inform me in your letters which of you has brought how many to Christ.  If, then, haply from any cause you are unable to do this, enjoin it on our aforesaid brother and fellow-bishop Felix, or my son Cyriacus, and afford them succour for the work of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xviii-p7.4"></a>God</span>, that so in the retribution to come you may be in a state to partake of life by so much the more as you now afford succour to a good work.</p>
