 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.iv-p3"></a>Gregory to Theodelinda, Queen of the Lombards <a name="fr_1525"></a><a href="#fn_1525"><font size="1">1526</font></a>

 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.iv-p5"></a>It has come to our knowledge by the report of certain persons that your Glory has been led on by some bishops even to such an offence against holy Church as to withdraw yourself from the communion of Catholic unanimity.  Now the more we sincerely love you, the more seriously are we distressed about you, that you believe unskilled and foolish men, who not only do not know what they talk about, but can hardly understand what they have heard.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.iv-p6"></a>For they say that in the times of Justinian of pious memory, some things were ordained contrary to the council of Chalcedon; and, while they neither read themselves nor believe those who do, they remain in the same error which they themselves feigned to themselves concerning us.  For we, our conscience bearing witness, declare that nothing was altered, nothing violated, with respect to the faith of this same holy council of Chalcedon; but that whatever was done in the times of the aforesaid Justinian was so done that the faith of the council of Chalcedon should in no respect be disturbed.  Further, if any one presumes to speak or think anything contrary to the faith of the said synod, we detest his   <a name="page_146b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.iv.iv-Page_146b"></a>opinion, with interposition of anathema.  Since then you know the integrity of our faith under the attestation of our conscience, it remains that you should never separate yourself from the communion of the Catholic Church, lest all those tears of yours, and all those good works should come to nothing, if they are found alien from the true faith.  It therefore becomes your Glory to send a communication with all speed to my most reverend brother and fellow-bishop Constantius, of whose faith, as well as his life, I have long been well assured, and to signify by your letters addressed to him how kindly you have accepted his ordination, and that you are in no way separated from the communion of his Church; although I think that what I say on this subject is superfluous:  for, though there has been some degree of doubtfulness in your mind, I think that it has been removed from your heart on the arrival of my son John the abbot, and Hippolytus the notary.</p>
