 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></a>Epistle XXXII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p2"></a>To Narses the Patrician.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p3"></a>Gregory to Narses, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p4"></a>Your most sweet Charity has said much to me in your letters in praise of my good deeds, to all which I briefly reply, <i>Call me not Noemi, that is beautiful; but call me Mara, that is bitter; for I am full of bitterness</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020">Ruth i. 20</a><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p4.1"></a>).</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p5"></a>But as to the cause of the presbyters <a name="fr_1554"></a><a href="#fn_1554"><font size="1">1555</font></a>
 , which is pending with my brother and fellow-bishop, the most reverend Patriarch John, we have, as I think, for our adversary the very man whom you assert to be desirous of observing the canons.  Further, I declare to thy Charity that I am prepared, with the help of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p6.1"></a>God</span>, to prosecute this same cause with all my power and influence.  And, should I see that in it the canons of the Apostolic See are not observed, Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p6.2"></a>God</span> will give unto me what I may do against the contemners of the same.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p7"></a>As to what your Charity has written to me, asking me to give thanks for you to my son the chief physician and ex-præfect Theodorus, I have done so, and have by no means ceased to commend you as much as I could.  Further, I beg you to pardon me for replying to your letters with brevity; for I am pressed by such great tribulations that it is not allowed me either to read or to speak much by letter.  This only I say to thee, <i>For the voice of groaning I have forgotten to eat my bread</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004">Psa. 102.4</a><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p7.1"></a> <a name="fr_1555"></a><a href="#fn_1555"><font size="1">1556</font></a>
 ).  All that are with you I beg you to salute in my name.  Give my salutations to the lady Dominica, whose letter I have not answered, because, though she is Latin, she wrote to me in Greek.</p>
