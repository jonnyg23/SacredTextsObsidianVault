 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p3"></a>To Peter, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p4"></a>Gregory to Peter, Bishop of Corsica <a name="fr_1725"></a><a href="#fn_1725"><font size="1">1726</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p6"></a>On receiving the letters of your Fraternity we returned great thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p6.1"></a>God</span>, that you had been so good as to refresh us with the news of the gathering in of many souls.  And accordingly let your Fraternity strive anxiously to bring to perfection, with the help of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p6.2"></a>Lord</span>, the work which you have begun.  And with regard to those who have once been faithful, but from negligence or under constraint have returned to the worship of idols, make haste to bring them back to the faith, imposing on them a penance of a few days, that they may bewail their guilt, and keep to that to which they return, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p6.3"></a>God</span> helping them, the more firmly as they shall have perfectly deplored that from which they now depart; and with regard to those who have not yet been baptized, let thy Fraternity make haste, by admonishing, by beseeching, by alarming them about the coming judgment, and also by giving reasons why they should not worship stocks and stones, to gather them in to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p6.4"></a>God</span>; that so, at His advent, when the strict day of judgment comes, thy Holiness may be found in the number of the Saints.  For what more profitable work or more lofty canst thou be engaged in than taking thought for the quickening and gathering together of souls and bringing in immortal gain to thy <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p6.5"></a>Lord</span>, Who has given to thee the post of preaching?</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p7"></a>Further, we send thy Fraternity fifty <i>solidi</i> for procuring vestments for those who are to be baptized; and we have also caused to be given to the presbyter of the Church situated in Mount Negeugnus <a name="fr_1726"></a><a href="#fn_1726"><font size="1">1727</font></a>
  the possession which thy Fraternity has asked for, so that its value may be deducted from the money that he had been accustomed to receive.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p9"></a>Further, your Fraternity has asked to be allowed to make for yourself an episcopal residence in the church that is not far from the same mountain; which proposal I most gladly accede to, since the nearer you are, the more will you be able to do good to the souls that are there.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii.i-p10"></a>In consideration of your Holinesss intercessions for him we have made the bearer of these presents an acolyte, and have sent him back to attend upon you, in order that, if he should be of still more service in winning souls, he may be in a position to be still further advanced.</p>
