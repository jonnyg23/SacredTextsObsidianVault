 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.i.xli-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.i.xli-p1.1"></a>Epistle LXI.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xli-p2"></a>To Gennadius, Patrician and Exarch of Africa.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xli-p3"></a>Gregory to Gennadius, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xli-p4"></a>That you have unceasingly the fear of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xli-p4.1"></a>God</span> before your eyes, and pursue justice, the subdued necks of enemies testify; but, that the grace of Christ may keep your Glory in the same prosperity, restrain, as you have been wont, with speedy prohibition whatever things you discover to be committed wrongfully, so that, fortified with the arms of justice, you may overcome hostile attacks with the power of faith, which is the top of all virtue.  Now Marinianus, our brother and fellow-bishop of the city of Turris <a name="fr_1373"></a><a href="#fn_1373"><font size="1">1374</font></a>
  has tearfully represented to us that the poor of his city are being vexed everywhere, and afflicted by expenses in the way of gifts or payments <a name="fr_1374"></a><a href="#fn_1374"><font size="1">1375</font></a>
 ; and further that the religious <a name="fr_1375"></a><a href="#fn_1375"><font size="1">1376</font></a>
  of his church endure serious molestation from the men of Theodorus the <i>magister militum</i>, and suffer bodily injuries; and that this thing is breaking out to such a pitch that (shocking to say) they are thrust into prison, and that he himself also is seriously hindered by the aforesaid glorious person in causes pertaining to his Church.  How opposed such things are, if indeed they are true, to the discipline of the republic you yourselves know.  And, since it befits your Excellency to amend all these things, greeting your Eminence I demand of you that you suffer them to be done no more; but straightly order him to abstain from harming the Church, and that none be aggrieved by burdens laid upon them, or payments <a name="fr_1376"></a><a href="#fn_1376"><font size="1">1377</font></a>
 , beyond what reason allows, and that, if there should be any suits, they be determined not by the terror of power, but by order of law.  I pray you, then, so correct all these things, the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xli-p8.1"></a>Lord</span> inspiring you, by the menace of your injunction that the glorious Theodorus and his men may abstain from such things, if not out of regard to rectitude, yet at any rate out of fear inspired by your command; that so, to the advancement of your credit and reward, justice with liberty may flourish in the parts committed to your charge.</p>
