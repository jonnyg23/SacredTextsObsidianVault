 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p1.1"></a>Epistle VIII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p2"></a>To the Bishops of Epirus.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p3"></a>Gregory to Theodorus, Demetrius, Philip, Zeno, and Alcissonus, Bishops of Epirus.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p4"></a>The notification of your letters, most dear brethren, has made known to us that our brother Andrew has, by the favour of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.1"></a>God</span>, been solemnly ordained bishop of the city of Nicopolis.  And, since you signify that his consecration has taken place with the assent of the clergy and provincials, we rejoice; and we pray that the good which you testify of him may remain in him, and by the co-operation of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.2"></a>Gods</span> grace receive increase, since the goodness of prelates is the safety of their subordinates.  It is your duty then to make haste studiously to imitate what you show by your praises to be pleasing to you in his person.  For it is faulty before men and penal  <a name="page_191b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vi.vii-Page_191b"></a>before <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.3"></a>God</span> for any one to be unwilling to imitate the good that pleases him.  Wherefore let your obedience supply credit to your testimony.  Let no one gainsay him in what, with preservation of integrity, he may enjoin for the common profit of the Church.  Let each one of you willingly exhibit his devotion that, while there is among you priestly concord pleasing to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p4.4"></a>God</span> and constant, no ill feeling may avail to loose you from the bond of mutual charity, or difference disturb you.  For neither will there be access to your hearts for the crafty foe, since he knows that he can in no degree be admitted or received, where sincere charity finds place.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p5"></a>Moreover be ye attentive, most dear brethren, and bestow on the flock committed to you the vigilance which ye have taken upon yourselves, and which ye owe; meet the frauds of the enemy by attention and prayer.  Surrender with uncontaminated faith to our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p5.1"></a>God</span> the people over which ye are, that your priestly office may avail you not for a penalty but for a crown before the sight of the eternal Judge.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p6"></a>Know ye then that we have sent a pallium to the above-written Andrew our brother and fellow-bishop, and have granted him all the privileges which our predecessors conferred on his predecessors.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p7"></a>Furthermore, it has come to our ears that sacred orders in your parts are conferred for a consideration given.  And, if this is so, I say it with tears, I declare it with groans, &amp;c.  [See Lib. V. Ep. 53<a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p7.1"></a>, to “become a heretic”] <a name="fr_1639"></a><a href="#fn_1639"><font size="1">1640</font></a>
 .  On this account I admonish and conjure you to be altogether attentive to this, that no giving of a consideration, no favour, no supplication of any persons whatsoever, put in any claim in regard to sacred orders, but that one be promoted to this office whom gravity of manners and behaviour commends.  For if, as we do not believe will be the case, we should perceive anything of the kind to be done, we will correct it, as is fit, with canonical severity.  Now may Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.vii-p8.1"></a>God</span>, who orders all things wonderfully by the power of His wisdom, and guards what He has ordered, grant unto you both to will and to do what He commands.</p>
