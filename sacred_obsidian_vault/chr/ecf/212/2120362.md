 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4"></a>I appointed thy Fraternity to preside for the present over the church of Naples, to the end that thou mightest convert all thou canst to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.1"></a>God</span> by persuasive preaching.  And, while thou oughtest to be giving thy whole mind to this work, thou art in haste to return before bringing forth this fruit to the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.2"></a>Lord</span>, and requestest me to settle the affairs of this same church speedily, my mind being meanwhile by no means unoccupied in this matter.  But, being desirous of fortifying securely the well-being of this Church, I hold it needful to consider the matter with long continued deliberation, so as to be able to arrange its affairs by the ordination of a worthy whom Christ may reveal to us.  Wherefore let thy Fraternity meanwhile study to watch for the good of souls, so that the opinion I have of thee may be strengthened by the effect of thy working.  All thou hast written concerning the deacon Peter has now been made known to us by the ex-consul Theodorus.  And so, now that I know that he is constant to thee, and, according to thy testimony, studies the advantage of the Church, he ought to be afraid of no ones opposition or enmity, but persevere in benefiting the Church and serving <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.vii-p4.3"></a>God</span> all the more watchfully as he feels that others have a grudge against him; that so they may have no power at all to injure him.  Moreover, thy Fraternity ought not hereafter to be suspected with regard to him; since no surreptitious proceedings will have effect on me <a name="fr_1404"></a><a href="#fn_1404"><font size="1">1405</font></a>
