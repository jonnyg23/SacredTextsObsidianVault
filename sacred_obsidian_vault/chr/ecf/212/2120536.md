 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p2"></a>To Mauricius Augustus.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p3"></a>Gregory to Mauricius Augustus.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p4"></a>Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p4.1"></a>God</span>, who has made your Piety to be the guardian of ecclesiastical peace, preserves you by the same faith which, through unity among priests, you preserve; and when you submit your heart humbly to the yoke of heavenly loving-kindness, it is brought to pass by heavenly grace that you tread your enemies under the foot of valour.  For it cannot be of small advantage that, when John of holy memory had departed this life, your Piety long hesitated, and somewhat deferred the time, while seeking counsel in the fear of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p4.2"></a>God</span>, in order, to wit, that the cause of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p4.3"></a>God</span> might be ordered, as it should be, with great fear <a name="fr_1686"></a><a href="#fn_1686"><font size="1">1687</font></a>
 .  Whence also I think that my brother and fellow-priest Cyriacus is proved to be exceedingly fit for pastoral rule, in that the long deliberation of your Piety has raised him to this degree.  And we all know how diligent and how practised he has long been in the administration of ecclesiastical affairs.  Whence also I doubt not that it has been brought about by Divine ordering that one who had administered  <a name="page_214b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vii.iv-Page_214b"></a>the least things well should fitly undertake the greater, and should pass from the charge of affairs to the government of souls.  Wherefore in all our prayers we beseech Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p5.1"></a>God</span> to repay this good work to the Serenity of our lords and to their pious offspring both in the present world and also with a perpetual recompense, and to grant to my aforesaid brother and fellow-priest, who has been put over the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p5.2"></a>Lords</span> flock, to shew himself fully solicitous in the care of souls; that he may be able irreprovably both to correct what is wrong in his subjects and to foster what is right unto further increase; to the end that the judgment of your Piety concerning him may be approved, not only before men, but also before the eyes of the Supernal Majesty.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vii.iv-p6"></a>The venerable men, George the presbyter and Theodore the deacon, in consideration of the command of my lords and the imminence of the winter season, I have not allowed to be delayed in this city.</p>
