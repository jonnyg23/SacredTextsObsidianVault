 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.iii.i-p4"></a>How one who has in due order arrived at a place of rule ought to demean himself in it.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iii.i-p5"></a>The conduct of a prelate ought so far to transcend the conduct of the people as the life of a shepherd is wont to exalt him above the flock.  For one whose estimation is such that the people are called his flock is bound anxiously to consider what great necessity is laid upon him to maintain rectitude.  It is necessary, then, that in thought he should be pure, in action chief; discreet in keeping silence, profitable in speech; a near neighbour to every one in sympathy, exalted above all in contemplation; a familiar friend of good livers through humility, unbending against the vices of evil-doers through zeal for righteousness; not relaxing in his care for what is inward from being occupied in outward things, nor neglecting to provide for outward things in his solicitude for what is inward.  But the things which we have thus briefly touched on let us now unfold and discuss more at length.</p>
