 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xvi-p4"></a>Having read the contradictory letters which thou and thy bishop have addressed to us against each other, we grieve that there is so little charity between you.  Nevertheless we enjoin thee to continue in the administration of thy office, and, if the cause of offence between you can, under the power of grace, be settled on the spot, we believe it will be   <a name="page_80b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.i.xvi-Page_80b"></a>greatly to the advantage of your souls.  But in case the discord between you has so set you in arms against each other that you have no will to allay the swelling of your offence, do thou without delay come to be heard before us, and let thy bishop send to us on his own behalf such person as he may choose, furnished with instructions; that, after minutely considering the whole case, we may settle what may appear fit between the parties.  But we would have thee know that we shall make strict enquiry of thee on all points, as to whether the ornaments <a name="fr_1319"></a><a href="#fn_1319"><font size="1">1320</font></a>
 , either those of thine own church, or such as have been collected from various churches, are being now kept with all care and fidelity.  For, if any of them shall be found to have been lost through negligence or through any persons dishonesty, thou wilt be involved in the guilt of this, being, in virtue of thy office of Archdeacon, peculiarly responsible for the custody of the said church.</p>
