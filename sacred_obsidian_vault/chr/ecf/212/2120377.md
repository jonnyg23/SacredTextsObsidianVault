 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p1.1"></a>Epistle XLI.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p2"></a>To Castorius, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p3"></a>Gregory to Castorius, Bishop of Ariminum (Rimini).</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p4"></a>What lamentable supplications have been poured out to us by Luminosus, abbot of the   <a name="page_112b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-Page_112b"></a>monastery of St. Andrew and St. Thomas, in the city of Ariminum, appears from the text of the subjoined petition.  With regard to this matter we exhort thy Fraternity that, on the death of the abbot of this same monastery, thy church shall under no pretext interfere in scheduling or taking charge of the property of the said monastery, acquired or to be acquired.  And we desire thee to ordain as abbot of the same monastery none other but him whom the whole congregation may by common consent demand as being worthy in character and apt for monastic discipline.  Moreover, we entirely forbid public masses to be celebrated there by the bishop, lest occasion be given for popular assemblies in the retreats of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p4.1"></a>Gods</span> servants, and also lest too frequent an entrance of women be a cause of scandal (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p4.2"></a>God</span> forbid), especially to the simpler souls.  Further, we ordain that this paper by us written shall be carefully held to, and kept in force and unadulterated in all future time by thee and the bishops that shall be ordained after thee; that so, with the help of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p4.3"></a>God</span>, both thy church may be content with its own rights and no more, and also the said monastery, being subject henceforth to none but general or canonical jurisdiction, and free from all annoyances and vexations, may accomplish its divine work with the utmost devotion of heart.</p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p5"></a>[In place of the epistle as above given, the following, with the appended paper on the privileges of monasteries, is found in some Codices.]</p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p6"></a>Gregory to Castorius, Bishop of Ariminum.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p7"></a>What lamentable supplications Luminosus, abbot of the monastery of Saints Andrew and Thomas, in the city of Ariminum, has poured out to us, appears from the text of the subjoined petition.  For from his account we learn that in very many monasteries the monks have suffered many prejudices and annoyances from prelates.  It is therefore the duty of thy Fraternity to make provision for their future quiet by a wholesome arrangement, to the end that those who have their conversation therein in <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p7.1"></a>Gods</span> service may, His grace assisting them, persevere with minds free from disturbance.  But, lest from a custom which ought to be rather amended than continued, any one should presume to cause any kind of annoyance to monks, it is necessary that the things which we have caused to be enumerated below should be so carefully observed by the fraternity of bishops that no possible occasion of introducing disquiet may be found hereafter.</p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p8"></a>Of the privileges of Monasteries.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p9"></a>We therefore interdict in the name of our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p9.1"></a>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, and forbid by the authority of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, in whose stead we preside over this Roman Church, that any bishop or secular person hereafter presume in any way to devise occasions of interfering with regard to the revenues, property, or writings of monasteries, or of the cells or vills thereto appertaining, or have recourse to any tricks or exactions:  but, if any case should by chance arise as to land disputed between their churches and any monasteries, and it cannot be arranged amicably, let it be terminated without intentional delay before selected abbots and other fathers who fear <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p9.2"></a>God</span>, sworn upon the most holy Gospels.  Also on the death of the abbot of any congregation, let no stranger be ordained, or any but one of the same congregation whom the society of the brethren shall of its own accord have elected unanimously, and who shall have been elected without fraud or venality.  But, if they cannot find a suitable person among themselves, let them in like manner elect some one from some other monastery to be ordained.  Nor, when an abbot has been constituted, let any person whatever on any pretext be put over him, unless perchance (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p9.3"></a>God</span> forbid) crimes be apparent which are shewn to be punishable by the sacred canons.  Likewise the rule is to be observed, that monks must not, without the consent of the abbot, be removed from monasteries for constituting other monasteries, or for sacred orders, or for any clerical office.  We also disallow ecclesiastical schedules of the property of a monastery to be made by bishops.  But if, circumstances requiring it, the abbot of a place should have questions with other abbots concerning property that has come into possession, let the matter be terminated also by their counsel or judgment.  On the death also of an abbot let not the bishop on any pretext intermeddle in the scheduling or taking charge of the property of the monastery, acquired, or given, or to be acquired.  We also entirely forbid public masses to be celebrated by him in a convent, lest in the retreats of the servants of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-p9.4"></a>God</span> and their places of refuge any opportunity for a popular concourse be afforded, or an unwonted entrance of women should ensue, which would be by no means of advantage to their souls.  Nor let him dare to place his episcopal chair there, or have any power whatever of command, or of holding any ordination, even the most ordinary, unless he should be requested to do so by the abbot of the place; that so the monks may always remain under the  <a name="page_113b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.ii.xxii-Page_113b"></a>power of their abbots:  and let no bishop detain a monk in any church without a testimonial and permission from his abbot, or promote one without such permission to any dignity.  We ordain, then, that this paper by us written be kept to for all future time, in force and unadulterated, by all bishops; that both they may be content with the rights of their own churches and no more, and that the monasteries be subject to no ecclesiastical conditions, or compelled services, or obedience of any kind to secular authorities (saving only canonical jurisdiction <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1441"><font size="1">1442</font></a>
 ), but, freed from all vexations and annoyances, may accomplish their divine work with the utmost devotion of heart.</p>
