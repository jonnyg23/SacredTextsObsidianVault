  that of Cyril of blessed memory, which agrees throughout with our views, may become known to all the brethren; in order that being furnished with arguments they may fortify themselves with spiritual strength against those who think fit to insult the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.lxii-p6.1"></a>Lords</span> Incarnation with their misbeliefs.  You have a favourable opportunity, beloved brother, of recommending the commencement of your episcopacy to all the churches and to our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.lxii-p6.2"></a>God</span>, if you will carry out these things in the way we have charged and enjoined you.  But the matters which were not to be committed to paper, in reliance on <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.lxii-p6.3"></a>Gods</span> aid, you shall carry out effectually, as we have said, and laudably, when you have learnt about them from the mouths of our aforesaid sons.  <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.lxii-p6.4"></a>God</span> keep you safe, dearest brother.  Dated 5th of May, in the consulship of the most glorious Valentinianus (for the 7th time) and of the famous Avienus (450).</p>
