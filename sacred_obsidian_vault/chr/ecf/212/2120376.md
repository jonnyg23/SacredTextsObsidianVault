 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxi-p2"></a>To John, Bishop of Squillacium (Squillace, in Calabria).</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxi-p3"></a>Gregory to John, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xxi-p4"></a>The care of our pastoral office warns us to appoint for bereaved churches bishops of their own, who may govern the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxi-p4.1"></a>Lords</span> flock with pastoral solicitude.  Accordingly we have held it necessary to appoint thee, John, bishop of the <i>civitas Lissitana</i> (<i>Lissus</i>, hodie, <i>Alessio?</i>), which has been captured by the enemy, to be cardinal <a name="fr_1439"></a><a href="#fn_1439"><font size="1">1440</font></a>
  in the Church of Squillacium, that thou mayest carry on the cure of souls once undertaken by thee, having regard to future retribution.  And although, being driven from thine own Church by the invading enemy, thou must govern another Church which is now without a shepherd, yet it must be on condition that, in case of the former city being set free from the enemy, and under the protection of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxi-p5.1"></a>God</span> restored to its former state, thou return to the Church in which thou wast first ordained.  If, however, the aforesaid city continues to suffer under the calamity of captivity, thou must remain in this Church wherein thou art by us incardinated <a name="fr_1440"></a><a href="#fn_1440"><font size="1">1441</font></a>
 .  Moreover, we enjoin thee never to make unlawful ordinations, or allow any bigamist, or one who has taken a wife who was not a virgin, or one ignorant of letters, or one maimed in any part of his body, or a penitent, or one liable to any condition of service, to attain to sacred orders.  And, shouldest thou find any of this kind, thou must not dare to advance them.  Africans generally, and unknown strangers, applying for ecclesiastical orders, on no account accept seeing that some Africans are Manichæans, and some have been rebaptized; while many strangers, though being in minor orders, are proved to have pretended to a higher dignity.  We also admonish thy Fraternity to watch wisely over the souls committed to thee, and to be more intent on winning souls than on the profits of the present life.  Be diligent in keeping and disposing of the goods of the Church, that the coming Judge, when He comes to judge, may approve thee as having in all respects worthily executed the office of shepherd which thou hast taken upon thee.</p>
