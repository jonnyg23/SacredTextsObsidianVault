 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xxxv-p5"></a>Since we have undertaken, however undeserving, a place of government, it is our duty to succour our brethren in need, so far as our power extends.  Januarius, then, our brother and fellow-bishop of the metropolitan city of Caralis (<i>Cagliari</i>), has been here in the city of Rome, and informed us that the glorious <i>magister militum</i>, Theodorus, who is known to have received the dukedom of the island of Sardinia, is doing many things there contrary to the commands of our most pious lords, whereby with fitting clemency and gentleness they removed many hardships of proprietors, or of citizens of their empire.  Wherefore we desire you at a suitable time to represent the case to our most pious lords in accordance with what the provincials of the aforesaid island justly and reasonably demand; seeing that on a previous occasion also their sacred imperial letters were sent to the glorious <i>Magister militum</i> Edancius, who was in the seventh indiction duke of Sardinia, in which they ordered all these present grievances to be redressed, to the end that their commands, proceeding from the bountifulness of their piety, might be observed unshaken by dukes who might come in course of time to be in power, and that the benefit thereof might not be squandered away by administrators; that so a quiet life might be led under the clement empire of our lords, and for the ordinance which with tranquil mind they grant to their subjects they might receive multiplied compensation at the coming of the eternal judge.</p>
