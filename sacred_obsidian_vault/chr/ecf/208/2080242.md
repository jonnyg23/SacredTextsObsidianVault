 <p class="c20"><a name="ix.clxx-p5"></a><span class="c14"><a name="ix.clxx-p5.1"></a>You</span> have undertaken a kindly and charitable task in getting together the captive troop of the insolent Glycerius (at present I must so write), and, so far as in you lay, covering our common shame.  It is only right that your reverence should undo this dishonour with a full knowledge of the facts about him.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.clxx-p6"></a>This grave and venerable Glycerius of yours was ordained by me deacon of the church of Venesa <a name="fr_2560"></a><a href="#fn_2560"><font size="1">2561</font></a>
  to serve the presbyter, and look after the work of the Church, for, though the fellow is in other respects intractable, he is naturally clever at manual labour.  No sooner was he appointed than he neglected his work, as though there had been absolutely nothing to do.  But, of his own private power and authority, he got together some wretched virgins, some of whom came to him of their own accord (you know how young people are prone to anything of this <a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218</font></a> <a name="ix.clxx-Page_218"></a>kind), and others were unwillingly forced to accept him as leader of their company.  Then he assumed the style and title of patriarch, and began all of a sudden to play the man of dignity.  He had not attained to this on any reasonable or pious ground; his only object was to get a means of livelihood, just as some men start one trade and some another.  He has all but upset the whole Church, scorning his own presbyter, a man venerable both by character and age; scorning his chorepiscopus, and myself, as of no account at all, continually filling the town and all the clergy with disorder and disturbance.  And now, on being mildly rebuked by me and his chorepiscopus, that he may not treat us with contempt (for he was trying to stir the younger men to like insubordination), he is meditating conduct most audacious and inhuman.  After robbing as many of the virgins as he could, he has made off by night.  I am sure all this will have seemed very sad to you.  Think of the time too.  The feast was being held there, and, as was natural, large numbers of people were gathered together.  He, however, on his side, brought out his own troop, who followed young men and danced round them, causing all well-disposed persons to be most distressed, while loose chatterers laughed aloud.  And even this was not enough, enormous as was the scandal.  I am told that even the parents of the virgins, finding their bereavement unendurable, wishful to bring home the scattered company, and falling with not unnatural sighs and tears at their daughters feet, have been insulted and outraged by this excellent young man and his troop of bandits.  I am sure your reverence will think all this intolerable.  The ridicule of it attaches to us all alike.  First of all, order him to come back with the virgins.  He might find some mercy, if he were to come back with a letter from you.  If you do not adopt this course, at least send the virgins back to their mother the Church.  If this cannot be done, at all events do not allow any violence to be done to those that are willing to return, but get them to return to me.  Otherwise I call God and man to witness that all this is ill done, and a breach of the law of the Church.  The best course would be for Glycerius to come back with a letter, <a name="fr_2561"></a><a href="#fn_2561"><font size="1">2562</font></a>
  and in a becoming and proper frame of mind; if not, let him be deprived of his ministry. <a name="fr_2562"></a><a href="#fn_2562"><font size="1">2563</font></a>

I. it is preceded by lxxi., unquestionably addressed to Gregory of Nazianzus, and inscribed “to the same.”  In the <i>Codex Harl.</i> it is inscribed <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.clxx-p4.2"></a>Γρηγορί&amp; 251· ἑταίρῳ</span>.  Garnier, however (<i>Vit. S. Bas</i>. xxxi. § iv.) allows that there are arguments in favor of Gregory of Nyssa.  Probably it is the elder Gregory who is addressed.  See Prolegomena.</p>
