   But I have so much the more ground for congratulating you on being worthy of the privilege of enjoying, at such a moment, the society of one who is fighting such a good fight in the cause of the truth, and I am sure that you, who nobly support and stimulate his zeal, will be thought worthy by the Lord of a lot like his.  What a blessing, to enjoy in unbroken quiet the society of the man so rich in learning and experienced in life!  Now, at least, you must, I am sure, know how wise he is.  In days gone by his mind was necessarily given to many divided cares, and you were too busy a man to give your sole heed to the spiritual fountain which springs from his pure heart.  God grant that you may be a comfort to him, and never yourself want consolation from others.  I am sure of the disposition of your heart, alike from the experience which I, for a short time, have had of you, and from the exalted teaching your illustrious instructor, with whom to pass one single day is a sufficient provision for the journey to salvation.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ix.clxix-p6"></a> Eusebius was now in exile in Thrace.  On this picturesque scene of his forced departure from his diocese, the agony of his flock at losing him, and his calm submission to the tyranny of Valens, see Theodoret iv. 12 and 13, pp. 115, 116, of this edition.</p>
