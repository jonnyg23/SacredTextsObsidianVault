 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxx-p5"></a>I do not hesitate therefore to entrust to this brother the accompanying letter:  I know that he will meet with all that he wishes, and that you will count me but as a benefactor in furnishing occasion for the gratification of your kind inclinations.  He craves your advocacy.  His cause he will explain in person, if you but deign to regard him with a favourable eye, and embolden him to speak freely in the presence of so august an authority.  Accept my assurance that any kindness shewn to him, I shall regard as personal to myself.  His special reason for leaving Tyana and coming to me was the high value he attached to the presentation of a letter written by myself in support of his application.  That he may not be disappointed of his hope; that I may continue in the enjoyment of your consideration; that your interest in all that is good may, in this present matter, find scope for its full exercise—are the <a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a> <a name="ix.cclxxx-Page_312"></a>grounds on which I crave a gracious reception for him, and a place amongst those nearest to you.</p>
