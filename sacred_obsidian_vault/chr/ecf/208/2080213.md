 <p class="c55"><a name="ix.cxli-p3"></a><i>To the Church of Antioch</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c20"><a name="ix.cxli-p4"></a>1.  “<span class="c14"><a name="ix.cxli-p4.1"></a>Oh</span> that I had wings like a dove for then would I fly away” <a name="fr_2463"></a><a href="#fn_2463"><font size="1">2464</font></a>
  to you, and satisfy my longing to meet you.  But now it is not only wings that I want, but a whole body, for mine has suffered from long sickness, and now is quite worn away with continuous <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a> <a name="ix.cxli-Page_204"></a>affliction.  For no one can be so hard of heart, so wholly destitute of sympathy and kindness, as to hear the sigh that strikes my ear from every quarter, as though from some sad choir chanting a symphony of lamentation, without being grieved at heart, being bent to the ground, and wasting away with these irremediable troubles.  But the holy God is able to provide a remedy for the irremediable, and to grant you a respite from your long toils.  I should like you to feel this comfort and, rejoicing in the hope of consolation, to submit to the present pain of your afflictions.  Are we paying the penalty of our sins?  Then our plagues are such as to save us for the future from the wrath of God.  Are we called upon through these temptations to fight for the truth?  Then the righteous Giver of the prizes will not suffer us to be tried above that which we are able to bear, but, in return for our previous struggles, will give us the crown of patience and of hope in Him.  Let us, therefore, not flinch from fighting a good fight on behalf of the truth, nor, in despair, fling away the labours we have already achieved.  For the strength of the soul is not shewn by one brave deed, nor yet by effort only for a short time; but He Who tests our hearts wishes us to win crowns of righteousness after long and protracted trial.  Only let our spirit be kept unbroken, the firmness of our faith in Christ be maintained unshaken, and ere long our Champion will appear; He will come and will not tarry.  Expect tribulation after tribulation, hope upon hope; yet a little while; yet a little while.  Thus the Holy Ghost knows how to comfort His nurslings by a promise of the future.  After tribulations comes hope, and what we are hoping for is not far off, for let a man name the whole of human life, it is but a tiny interval compared with the endless age which is laid up in our hopes.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.cxli-p6"></a>2.  Now I accept no newer creed written for me by other men, nor do I venture to propound the outcome of my own intelligence, lest I make the words of true religion merely human words; but what I have been taught by the holy Fathers, that I announce to all who question me.  In my Church the creed written by the holy Fathers in synod at Nicæa is in use.  I believe that it is also repeated among you; but I do not refuse to write its exact terms in my letter, lest I be accused of taking too little trouble.  It is as follows: <a name="fr_2464"></a><a href="#fn_2464"><font size="1">2465</font></a>
   This is our faith.  But no definition was given about the Holy Ghost, the Pneumatomachi not having at that date appeared.  No mention was therefore made of the need of anathematizing those who say that the Holy Ghost is of a created and ministerial nature.  For nothing in the divine and blessed Trinity is created.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ix.cxli-p7"></a> Here follows in the text the Nicene Creed with the anathemas.  The Ben. note points out that the Nicene Creed was brought to Cæsarea by St. Leontius, and was vigorously defended by his successor Hermogenes.  <i>cf. Letter</i> lxxxi.  Dianius, who next followed in the see, signed several Arian formulæ.  The Nicene Creed, however, had been maintained at Cæsarea, and in <i>Letter</i> li. Dianius is described as supporting it.</p>
