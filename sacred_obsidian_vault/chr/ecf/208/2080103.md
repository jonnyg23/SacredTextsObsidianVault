  the only comfort I had in life.  Do not smile, if, old as I am, I lament my orphanhood.  Forgive me if I cannot endure separation from a soul, to compare with whom I see nothing in the future that lies before me.  So once more my complaints have come back to me; once more I am confined to my bed, tossing about in my weakness, and every hour all but looking for the end of life; and the Churches are in somewhat the same condition as my body, no good hope shining on them, and their state always changing for the worse.  In the meantime Neocæsarea and Ancyra have decided to have successors of the dead, and so far they are at peace.  Those who are plotting against me have not yet been permitted to do anything worthy of their bitterness and wrath.  This we make no secret of attributing to your prayers on behalf of the Churches.  Weary not then in praying for the Churches and in entreating God.  Pray give all salutations to those who are privileged to minister to your Holiness.</p>
