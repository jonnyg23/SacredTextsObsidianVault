 <p class="c20"><a name="ix.cxxv-p4"></a><span class="c14"><a name="ix.cxxv-p4.1"></a>It</span> is sometimes said that slaves to the passion of love, when by some inevitable necessity they are separated from the object of their desire, are able to stay the violence of their passion by indulging the sense of sight, if haply they can look at the picture of the beloved object.  Whether this be true or not I cannot say; but what has befallen me in your case, my friend, is not very different.  I have felt a disposition towards your godly and guileless soul, somewhat, if I may so say, of the nature of love; but the gratification of my desire, like that of all other blessings, is made difficult to me by the opposition of my sins.  However, I have seemed to see a very good likeness of you in the presence of my very reverend brothers.  And if it had been my lot to fall in with you when far away from them, I should have fancied that I saw them in you.  For the measure of love in each of you is so great, that in both of you there is a plain contest for the superiority.  I have thanked God for this.  If any longer life be left me, I pray that my life may be made sweet through you, just as now I look on life as a wretched thing to be avoided, because I am separated from the companionship of those I love best.  For, in my judgment, there is nothing in which one can be cheerful when cut off from those who truly love us.</p>
