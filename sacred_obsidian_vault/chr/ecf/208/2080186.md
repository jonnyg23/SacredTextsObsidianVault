 <p class="c20"><a name="ix.cxiv-p5"></a><span class="c14"><a name="ix.cxiv-p5.1"></a>On</span> meeting this man, I heartily thanked God that by means of his visit He had comforted me in many afflictions and had through him shewn me clearly your love.  I seem to see in one mans disposition the zeal of all of you for the truth.  He will tell you of our discourses with one another.  What you ought to learn directly from me is as follows.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.cxiv-p6"></a>We live in days when the overthrow of the Churches seems imminent; of this I have long been cognisant.  There is no edification of the Church; no correction of error; no sympathy for the weak; no single defence of sound brethren; no remedy is found either to heal the disease which has already seized us, or as a preventive against that which we expect.  Altogether the state of the Church (if I may use a plain figure though it may seem too humble an one) is like an old coat, which is always being torn and can never be restored to its original strength.  At such a time, then, there is need of great effort and diligence that the Churches may in some way be benefited.  It is an advantage that parts hitherto severed should be united.  Union would be effected if we were willing to accommodate ourselves to the weaker, where we can do so without injury to souls; since, then, many mouths are open against the Holy Ghost, and many tongues whetted to blasphemy against Him, we implore you, as far as in you lies, to reduce the blasphemers to a small number, and to receive into communion all who do not assert the Holy Ghost to be a creature, that the blasphemers may be left alone, and may either be ashamed and return to the truth, or, if they abide in their error, may cease to have any importance from the smallness of their numbers.  Let us then seek no more than this, but propose to all the brethren, who are willing to join <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a> <a name="ix.cxiv-Page_190"></a>us, the Nicene Creed.  If they assent to that, let us further require that the Holy Ghost ought not to be called a creature, nor any of those who say so be received into communion.  I do not think that we ought to insist upon anything beyond this.  For I am convinced that by longer communication and mutual experience without strife, if anything more requires to be added by way of explanation, the Lord Who worketh all things together for good for them that love Him, <a name="fr_2381"></a><a href="#fn_2381"><font size="1">2382</font></a>
  will grant it.</p>
