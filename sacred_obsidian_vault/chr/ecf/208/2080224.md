   The phrase of the Stoics runs, “since things do not happen as we like, we like what happens;” but I cannot make my mind fall in with what is happening.  That some men should do what they do not like because they cannot help it, I have no objection.  You doctors do not cauterise a sick man, or make him suffer pain in some other way, because you like it; but you often adopt this treatment in obedience to the necessity of the case.  Mariners do not willingly throw their cargo overboard; but in order to escape shipwreck they put up with the loss, preferring a life of penury to death.  Be sure that I look with sorrow and with many groans upon the separation of those who are holding themselves aloof.  But yet I endure it.  To lovers of the truth nothing can be put before God and hope in Him. <a name="fr_2501"></a><a href="#fn_2501"><font size="1">2502</font></a>
