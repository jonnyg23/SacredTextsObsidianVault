  peradventure through the aid of your prayers I may be able to fulfil my earnest wish, may find you at your own fireside, and, with abundant leisure, may take my fill of your vast treasures of wisdom.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ix.xxviii-p4"></a> This, the first of twenty-two letters addressed by Basil to Eusebius of Samosata, has no particular interest.  Eusebius, the friend of Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and of Meletius, was bishop of Samosata (in Commagene on the Euphrates, now Samsat) from 360 to 373, and was of high character and sound opinions.  Theodoret (<i>Ecc. Hist</i>. iv. 15), in mentioning his exile to Thrace in the persecution under Valens, calls him “that unflagging labourer in apostolic work,” and speaks warmly of his zeal.  Concerning the singular and touching circumstances of his death, <i>vide</i> Theodoret, <i>E.H</i>. v. 4, and my note in the edition of this series, p. 134.</p>
