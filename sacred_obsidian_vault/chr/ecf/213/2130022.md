 <p><a name="ii.v.xvi-p4"></a>Our son the glorious exconsul Leontius has made a serious complaint to us of our brother and fellow-bishop Leo; and his complaint has altogether disturbed us, since a bishop ought not to have acted so precipitately and lightly.  This case we have committed, to be thoroughly enquired into, to our Guardian (<i>defensoris</i>) Romanus when he comes to you.  Further, the messenger who was sent by him (<i>i.e. by Leontius</i>) complains of your Fraternity, that in the defence of the illustrious physician Archelaus the interests of our brother and fellow-bishop, the Metropolitan Domitian, suffer damage <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
 .  And indeed your Fraternity ought justly to protect your sons, or it may be in this case the interests of holy Church, and to give no occasion for evil-speaking to adversaries.  I doubt not, however, even while thus speaking, that you do take heed to this:  yet we have enjoined on the same Romanus, when he comes to you, to arrange with you what is right with regard to this case also.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.xvi-p5"></a> This Domitian was bishop of Melitina and Metropolitan of Armenia, being a relation of the Emperors, see III. 67.  The physician Archelaus is commended in an epistle not translated (V. 32) to Cyprian, the previous <i>rector patrimonii</i> in Sicily, for protection in some question about property.</p>
