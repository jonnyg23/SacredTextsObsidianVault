 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xlvi-p2"></a><i>To Aregius, Bishop of Vapincum</i> <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">67</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xlvi-p4"></a>Gregory to Aregius, Bishop in Gaul.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xlvi-p5"></a>The affliction of your Fraternity, which we have learnt that you have had for the loss of your people, has given us such cause of grief that, since charity makes us two one, we feel our heart to be especially in your tribulations.  But in the midst of this we have been much consoled by your having brought your mind to discern how it becomes <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a> <a name="ii.v.xlvi-Page_27"></a>you to bear sorrow patiently, and, in the hope of another life, not to have long continued grief for death.  Still, lest some tribulation should still maintain itself in your soul, I exhort you to rest from sorrow, to cease to be sad.  For it is unseemly to addict oneself to wearisomeness of affliction for those of whom it is to be believed that they have attained to true life by dying.  Those have perhaps just excuse for long continued grief who know not of another life, and have no trust that there is a passing from this world to a better.  We, however, who know this, who believe it and teach it, ought not to be too much distressed for them that depart, lest what in others has a show of affection, be to us rather a matter of blame.  For it is, as it were, a kind of distrust to be tormented by sadness in opposition to what everyone preaches, as the Apostle says, <i>But we would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012">1 Thess. iv. 12</a><a name="ii.v.xlvi-p5.1"></a>).</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xlvi-p6"></a>Having, therefore, this reason before us, dearest brother, we should try, as we have said, not to afflict ourselves about the dead, but bestow affection on the living, to whom pity may be of advantage and love bear fruit.  Let us henceforth hasten, by reproving, exhorting, persuading, soothing, comforting, to profit all we can.  Let our tongue be an encouragement to the good, a goad to the bad; let it beat down the puffed up, appease the angry, stir up the slow, kindle the idle by exhortation, persuade the shrinkers back, soothe the rough, comfort the despairing; that, as we are called leaders, we may shew the way of salvation to them that are advancing forward.  Let us be vigilant in keeping guard, let us defend all approaches against the snares of the enemy.  And, if ever error should have drawn aside a sheep of the flocks committed to us through devious ways, let us strive with all our endeavours to recall it to the Lords sheepfolds, so that from the name of shepherd which we bear we may reap not punishment, but a reward.  Seeing, then, that in all this there is need of the help of divine grace, let us implore the clemency of Almighty God with continual prayers, to the end that for doing these things He may give us the will and grant us the power, and, with the fruit of good work, direct us in that way in which He has declared Himself to be the Shepherd of shepherds; that so, through Him, without whom we cannot rise to the doing of anything, we may be able to accomplish all</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xlvi-p7"></a>Furthermore, our common son, Peter the deacon, has given us to understand that your Fraternity at the time when you were here requested that we would grant to yourself and your archdeacon license to use dalmatics <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>
 .  But, because compelled by the sickness of your people, you departed in such haste that the very grief that weighed upon you did not suffer you to press the matter any longer, as was fit and as the nature of your request required; and because we had many engagements, and consideration of ecclesiastical propriety did not allow us to concede a new thing inconsiderately and suddenly; for these reasons the carrying into effect of the thing demanded has been long postponed.  Now, however, recalling to mind your Charitys good deservings, by the tenor of this our authority we grant you your request, and have granted to thee or to thy archdeacon to be decorated by the use of dalmatics; and we have sent the same dalmatics by the hands of our most beloved son, the abbot Cyriacus.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xlvi-p9"></a>Furthermore, at the synod which we have decreed should be assembled through our brother and fellow-bishop Syagrius against simoniacal heresy, we desire thee to be present; and we have ordered the pallium which we have sent for our said brother to be accordingly given him, on condition of his promising to remove from holy Church, by a definition of the synod, the unlawful things which we have prohibited.  Concerning which synod we desire thy Fraternity to report to us fully by letter all its proceedings, that thou thyself, whose holiness we are well acquainted with, mayest inform us about everything.</p>
