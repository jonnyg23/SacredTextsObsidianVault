 </p><p class="c16"><a name="iii.vii.v-p1"></a> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vii.v-p1.1"></a>Hymn IV.</span></p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vii.v-p2"></a>1.  The thief gained the faith which gained him, <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">534</font></a>
  and brought him up and placed him in paradise.  He saw in the Cross a tree of life; that was the fruit, he was the eater in Adams stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p4"></a>The fool, who goes astray, grazes the faith, as it were an eye, <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">535</font></a>
  by all manner of questions.  The probing of the finger blinds the eye, and much more doth that prying blind. the faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p6"></a>For even the diver pries not into his pearl.  In it do all merchants rejoice without prying into whence it came; even the king who is crowned therewith does not explore it.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p7"></a>2.  Because Balaam was foolish, a foolish beast in the ass spoke with him, because he despised God Who spoke with him.  Thee too let the pearl reprove in the asss stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p8"></a>The people that had a heart of stone, by a Stone He set at nought, <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">536</font></a>
  for lo, a stone hears words.  Witness its work that has reproved them; and you, ye deaf ones, let the pearl reprove today.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p10"></a>With the swallow <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">537</font></a>
  and the crow did He put men to shame; with the ox, yea with the ass, <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">538</font></a>
  did He put them to shame; let the pearl reprove now, O ye birds and things on earth and things below.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p13"></a>3.  Not as the moon does thy light fill or wane; the Sun whose light is greater than all, lo! of Him it is that a type is shadowed out in thy little compass.  O type of the Son, one spark of Whom is greater than the sun!—</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p14"></a>The pearl itself is full, for its light is full; neither is there any cunning worker who can steal from it; for its wall is its own beauty, yea, its guard also!  It lacks not, since it is entirely perfect.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p15"></a>And if a man would break thee to take a part from thee, thou art like the faith which with the heretics perishes, seeing they have broken it in pieces and spoiled it:  for is it any better than this to have the faith scrutinised?</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p16"></a>The faith is an entire nature that may not be corrupted.  The spoiler gets himself <a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a> <a name="iii.vii.v-Page_297"></a>mischief by it:  the heretic brings ruin on himself thereby.  He that chases the light from his pupils blinds himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p17"></a>Fire and air are divided when sundered.  Light alone, of all creatures, as its Creator, is not divided; it is not barren, for that it also begets without losing thereby.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p18"></a>4.  And if a man thinks that thou art framed [by art] he errs greatly; thy nature proclaims that thou, as all stones, art not the framing of art; and so thou art a type of the Generation which no making framed.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p19"></a>Thy stone flees from a comparison with the Stone [which is] the Son.  For thy own generation is from the midst of the deep, that of the Son of thy Creator is from the highest height; He is not like thee, in that He is like His Father.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p20"></a>And as they tell, two wombs bare thee also.  Thou camest down from on high a fluid nature; thou camest up from the sea a solid body.  By means of thy second birth thou didst show thy loveliness to the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p21"></a>Hands fixed thee, when thou wast embodied, into thy receptacles; for thou art in the crown as upon a cross, and in a coronet as in a victory; thou art upon the ears, as if to fill up what was lacking; thou extendest over all.</p>
