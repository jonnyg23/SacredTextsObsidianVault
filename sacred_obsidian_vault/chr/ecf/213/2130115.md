 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p3"></a>Gregory to Quiricus, Bishop, and the other catholic bishops in Hiberia <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">183</font></a>

 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p5"></a>Since to charity nothing is afar off, let those who are divided in place be joined by letter.  The bearer of these presents, coming to the Church of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, asserted that he had received letters for us from your Fraternity, and had lost them, with other things also, in the city of Jerusalem.  In them, as he says, you were desirous of enquiring with regard to priests and people who have been bewildered in the error of Nestorian heresy, when they return to the Catholic Church which is the mother of all the elect, whether they should be baptized, or joined to the bowels of the same mother <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a> <a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-Page_83"></a>Church by confession only of the one true faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p6"></a>And indeed we have learnt from the ancient institution of the Fathers that whosoever among heretics are baptized in the name of the Trinity, when they return to holy Church, may be recalled to the bosom of mother Church either by unction of chrism, or by imposition of hands, or by profession of the faith only.  Hence the West reconciles Arians to the holy Catholic Church by imposition of hands, but the East by the unction of holy chrism.  But Monophysites and others are received by a true confession only, because holy baptism, which they have received among heretics, then acquires in them the power of cleansing, when either the former receive the Holy Spirit by imposition of hands, or the latter are united to the bowels of the holy and universal Church by reason of their confession of the true faith.  Those heretics, however, who are not baptized in the name of the Trinity, such as the <i>Bonosiaci</i> and the <i>Cataphrygæ</i>, because the former do not believe in Christ the Lord, and the latter with a perverse understanding believe a certain bad man, Montanus, to be the Holy Spirit, like unto whom are many others;—these, when they come to holy Church, are baptized, because what they received while in their error, not being in the name of the Holy Trinity, was not baptism.  Nor can this be called an iteration of baptism, which, as has been said, had not been given in the name of the Trinity.  But the Nestorians, since they are baptized in the name of the Holy Trinity—though darkened by the error of their heresy in that, after the manner of Jewish unbelief, they believe not the Incarnation of the Only-begotten—when they come to the Holy Catholic Church, are to be taught, by firm holding and profession of the true faith, to believe in one and the same Son of God and man, our Lord God Jesus Christ, the same existing in Divinity before the ages, and the same made man in the end of the ages, because <i>The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh. i. 14</a><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p6.1"></a>).</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p7"></a>But we say that the Word was made flesh not by losing what He was, but by taking what He was not.  For in the mystery of His Incarnation the Only-begotten of the Father increased what was ours, but diminished not what was His.  Therefore the Word and the flesh is one Person, as He says Himself, <i>No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014">Joh. iii. 14</a><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p7.1"></a>).  He Who is the Son of God in heaven was the Son of man who spoke on earth.  Hence John says, <i>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020">1 Joh. v. 20</a><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p7.2"></a>).  And as to what understanding He has given us, he straightway added, <i>That we may know the true God.</i>  Whom in this place does he mean as the true God but the Father Almighty?  But, as to what he conceives also of the Almighty Son, he added, And that we may be in his true Son Jesus Christ.  Lo, he says that the Father is the true God, and that Jesus Christ is His true Son.  And what he conceives this true Son to be he shews more plainly; <i>This is the true God, and eternal life</i>.  If, then, according to the error of Nestorius the Word were one and the man Jesus Christ were another, he who is true man would not be the true God and eternal life.  But the Only-begotten Son, the Word before the Ages, was made man.  He is, then, the true God and eternal life.  Certainly, when the holy Virgin was about to conceive Him, and heard the angel speaking to her, she said, <i>Behold the hand-maid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#038">Luke i. 38</a><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p7.3"></a>).  And, when she had conceived Him, and went to Elizabeth her kinswoman, at once she heard, <i>Whence am I worthy that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</i>  Lo, the same Virgin is called both the handmaid and the mother of the Lord.  For she is the handmaid of the Lord, because the Word before the Ages, the Only-begotten, is equal to the Father; but the mother, because in her womb from the Holy Spirit and of her flesh He was made man.  Nor is she the handmaid of one and the mother of another, because, when the Only-begotten of God, existing before the ages, of her womb was made man, by an inscrutable miracle she became both the handmaid of man by reason of the divinity and the mother of the Word by reason of the flesh.  It was not that the flesh was first conceived in the womb of the Virgin, and the divinity afterwards came into the flesh; but that as soon as the Word came into the womb, immediately the Word, retaining the excellence of His own nature, was made flesh.  And the Only-begotten Son of God, through the womb of the Virgin, was born a perfect man, that is, in verity of flesh and of rational soul.  Whence also He is called Anointed above his fellows, as the Psalmist says, <i>God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007">Psa. 45.7</a><a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-p7.4"></a>) <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>
 .  For He is anointed with oil, that is to say with the gift of the Holy Spirit.  But He was anointed above His fellows, because all we men first exist as sinners, and afterwards are sanctified through the unction of the Holy Spirit.  But He Who, existing as God before the ages, was conceived as man through the <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a> <a name="ii.vii.xxxiii-Page_84"></a>Holy Spirit in the Virgins womb at the end of the ages, was there anointed by the same Spirit, even where He was conceived.  Nor was He first conceived and afterwards anointed; but to be conceived by the Holy Spirit of the flesh of the Virgin was itself to be anointed by the Holy Spirit.  This truth, then, concerning His nativity let all who are brought back from the perverse error of Nestorius confess before the holy congregation of your Fraternity, anathematising the same Nestorius with all his followers, and all other heresies.  The venerable synods also which the universal Church receives let them promise to receive and venerate; and let your Holiness without any hesitation receive them in your assembly, allowing them to retain their own orders, in order that, while you both carefully sift the secrets of their hearts, and teach them through true knowledge the right things they ought to hold, and in gentleness make no difficulty or contradiction with them with respect to their own orders, you may snatch them from the mouth of the ancient foe; and that the retribution of eternal glory with Almighty God may increase to you the more as you gather together many who may glory with you in the Lord without end.  Now may the Holy Trinity keep you in its protection while you pray for us, and grant you in its love still more manifold gifts.</p>
