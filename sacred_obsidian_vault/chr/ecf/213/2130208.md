 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xxxii-p3"></a>1. I heard Death and Satan, as they disputed, which was the more powerful, among men.  <i>R., To Thee be glory, Son of the Shepherd of All, Who deliveredst His flock from the secret wolves that devoured it</i>, the Evil One and Death!—2. Death showed his power, that he conquers all; Satan showed his guile, that he makes all to sin.—3. <i>Death</i>, To thee, O Evil One, none hearkens save he that wills:  to me he that wills and he that wills not, even to me they come.—4. <i>Satan</i>, Thine, O Death, is but the force of tyranny:  mine are snares and nets of subtlety.—5. <i>D</i>., Hear, O Evil One, that who so is subtle breaks off thy yoke:  but none is there that is able to escape my yoke.—6. <i>S</i>., Thou, Death, on him that is sick provest thy might:  but I over them that are whole, am exceeding powerful.—7. <i>D</i>., The Evil One prevails not over all those that revile him:  but for me he that has cursed me and he that curses me, come into my hands.—8. <i>S</i>., Thou, Death, from God, hast gotten thy might:  I alone by none am I helped, when I lead <i>men</i> to sin.—9. <i>D</i>., Thou, O Evil-One, like a weakling:  while like a king I exercise my dominion.—10. <i>S</i>., Thou art a fool, O Death, not to know how great am I:  who suffice to capture free will, the sovereign power.—11. <i>D</i>., Thou, O Evil One, like a thief, lo! thou goest round:  I like a lion break in pieces and <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.xxxii-Page_207"></a>fear not.—12. <i>S</i>., To thee, O Death, none does service or worship:  to me kings do service of sacrifice as to God.—13. <i>D</i>., On Death there are many that call, as on a kind Power:  on thee, O Evil One, none has called or calls.—14. <i>S</i>., Markest thou not this, O Death, how many there are:  who in sundry fashions call on me and make oblation?—15. <i>D</i>. Hated is thy name, O Satan, nor canst thou clear it:  thy name every one curses, hide thy reproach.—16. <i>S</i>., Thine ear, O Death, has waxed dull, that thou hearest not:  how against thee all men groan, conceal thyself.—17. <i>D</i>., My face is shown to the world, for I am guileless:  not like thee who without guile canst not abide.—18. <i>S</i>., Thou hast not in aught surpassed me for it is true:  that thou art hateful as I to the sons of men.—19. <i>D</i>., Of me all men are afraid as of a lord:  but as for thee they hate thee as the Evil One.—20. <i>S</i>., For thee, O Death, they hate thy name, and also thy work:  my name they hate but my delights they greatly love.—21. <i>D</i>., To bitterness of teeth is turned, this thy sweetness:  penitence of soul cleaves ever unto thy lusts.—22. <i>S</i>., Sheol is hated because in her is no repentance:  a pit that swallows and closes on all movements.—23. <i>D</i>., Sheol is a gulf wherein whoso falls shall rise again:  sin is hated because it cuts off the hope of man.—24. <i>S</i>., Though I mislike penitents, I give place <i>for repentance</i>:  thou cuttest off hope from the sinner who dies in his sin.—25. <i>D</i>., It was of thee that at first his hope was cut off:  for he whom thou hast not caused to sin dies happily.—26. Blessed <i>is</i> He who raised against each other those cursed servants:  that we might see them as they have seen us and mocked at us.—27. This that we have seen of them is a pledge, my brethren:  of what we shall see of them hereafter when we rise again.</p>
