 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.v.xxiv-p2"></a>To Theodelinda, Queen of the Lombards.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xxiv-p3"></a>Gregory to Theodelinda, &amp;c.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xxiv-p4"></a>How your Excellency has laboured earnestly and kindly, as is your wont, for the conclusion of peace we have learnt from the report of our son, the abbot Probus.  Nor indeed was it otherwise to be expected of your Christianity than that you would in all ways skew your assiduity and goodness in the cause of peace.  Wherefore we give thanks to Almighty God, who so rules your heart with His loving-kindness that, as He has given you a right faith, so He also grants you to work always what is pleasing in His sight.  For you may be assured, most excellent daughter, that for the saving of so much bloodshed on both sides you have acquired no small reward.  On this account, returning thanks for your goodwill, we implore the mercy of our God to repay you with good in body and soul here and in the world to come.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xxiv-p5"></a>Moreover, greeting you with fatherly affection, we exhort you so to deal with your most excellent consort that he may not reject the alliance of the Christian republic.  For, as I believe you know yourself, it is in many ways profitable that he should be inclined to betake himself to its friendship.  Do you then, after your manner, always strive for what tends to goodwill and conciliation between the parties, and labour wherever an occasion of reaping a reward presents itself, that you may commend your good deeds the more before the eyes of Almighty God.</p>
