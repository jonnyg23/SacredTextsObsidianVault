 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xli-p4"></a>Gregory to Gulfaris, &amp;c.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xli-p5"></a>The bearers of these presents, who come <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a> <a name="ii.v.xli-Page_22"></a>to us from the Istrian parts, have reported such good things of your Glory as to inflame us ardently to return you thanks.  For we learn that, among the cares of the government of those parts which has been committed to you, you are especially anxious to win souls, and that you so take pains to recall the hearts of wanderers to the unity of the Church that, as far as your desire goes, you would have no one there separated from the Apostolic Church; and that so great love of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, inflames you that you long with all your heart to restore the sheepfold of him to whom the keys were delivered by the Lord the Creator of all.  Have, glorious son, from such and so great a work, a confident anticipation of divine retribution, wherein not only our admonition but also the words of the apostle confirm thee, since he who shall have caused a sinner to be converted from the error of his way shall save his soul from death, and cover a multitude of sins (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#000">James v</a><a name="ii.v.xli-p5.1"></a>.).  For, however great be temporal affluence, or at any rate prosperity, it has its end,—the limit of death.  But this pursuit of winning souls, which you have taken up, retains the certainty of its hope fixed; to wit, the retribution of eternal life.  Wherefore, greeting you with fatherly affection, we exhort your Glory that you the more earnestly give effect to the zeal for the unity of our holy faith which the Author of unity Himself has given you; and that, recalling whomsoever you can from the error of their schism into the bosom of Mother Church, you cherish them with continual admonition.  And accomplish this also,—so to protect with the succour of your defence those whom the Lord through you may grant to be restored to His fold that there may be no quarter to which those who are still in error may be able to resort for the accusation of such as return to sound counsels.  For, while you uphold the cause of God on earth, He Himself will prosperously direct your actions here with the aid of His protection, and there will remain for you, in the eternal life which you long for, retribution for your so great well-doing.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.xli-p3"></a> As to Gregorys renewed efforts, now with better hope after the accession of Callinicus as Exarch of Italy to recover the Istrian schismatics in the matter of “the Three Chapters,” see above, IX. 9, 10.  Gulfaris, addressed in this epistle, was in military command in Istria, and appears to have exerted himself to further the aims of Gregory, who ever gladly availed himself of the aid of the secular arm.  Other letters on the same subject follow.</p>
