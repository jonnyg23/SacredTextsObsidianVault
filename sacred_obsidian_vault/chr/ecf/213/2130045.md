 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxxix-p2"></a><i>To Anatolius, Constantinopolitan Deacon</i> <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">55</font></a>

 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xxxix-p4"></a>Gregory to Anatolius, &amp;c.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xxxix-p5"></a>To good and devoted sons it is worth our labour so to respond as to double, because we are paying a debt, what it would befit us of our own mere motion to bestow upon them.  Seeing, then, that the bearer of these presents, our son the magnificent Marcellinus <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">56</font></a>
 , has demeaned himself as he has in the cause of our brother and fellow-bishop Maximus and in that of the Istrians, and is anxious to employ himself for the advantage of our Church, therefore, that he may be able more and more to shew his sincere affection not only in words but also in deeds, we hereby exhort thy Love to co-operate with him when he comes to the royal city with entire zeal and earnestness, and to be at pains so to assist him with all the succour in thy power, that, supported by the aid of Almighty God and thine, he may have the less difficulty to contend with there.  Thou wilt also study so to attend to him as to one who is in very truth our own, and so to bestow on him the efficiency of thy charity, that he may both recognise a return made to him for the past, and also be able to entertain a great hope of retribution in the future for his devotion which he promises to exhibit in the service of the Church.  But inasmuch as, so far as we have learnt, the most serene lord the Emperor had commanded our aforesaid magnificent son to hasten to wait upon him immediately, it is fitting for thee to seek an opportunity of intimating that it was no faulty disobedience, but the cause of our brother and fellow-bishop Maximus, that has detained him:  which cause, though late, has nevertheless through his exertions been brought to a conclusion.  But this we desire thy Love to attend to carefully; not to allow thyself to be mixed up in any cause whatever where there is oppression of the poor; lest haply, under pressure to some extent from persons in power, thou shouldest be driven to do what could not be of advantage to thy soul.  Dealing, then, with all matters in the fear of God, consider especially the eternal reward.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.xxxix-p6"></a> Supposed to be identical with Marcellus, Proconsul of Dalmatia, who, having originally and for some time afterwards supported Maximus as bishop of Salona against Gregory, had apparently made overtures for reconciliation with the latter.  See IX. 5, and on the whole subject III. 47, note 2.  He seems to have now fully satisfied Gregory, whose laudation of him in this letter is in marked contrast to the tone of IX. 5, addressed to Marcellus himself previously.</p>
