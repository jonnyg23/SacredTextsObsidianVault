 </p><p class="c37"><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p1"></a> <a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.xvii-Page_185"></a><span class="c50"><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></a>Hymn XVI.</span></p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p2"></a>1.  Herein <i>is</i> a mirror to be blamed,—if its clearness is darkened—because there are spots on its substance;—for the foulness that is on it becomes—a covering before them that look on it.  <i>R.  Blessed be He Who polished our mirror!</i></p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p3"></a>2.  For that comeliness is not adorned in it,—and blemishes are not brought to view in it,—it is altogether a damage to comely things;—seeing that their comeliness gain not—adornments as <i>their</i> profit.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p4"></a>3.  Blemishes are not rooted out by it,—likewise adornments are not multiplied by it.—A blemish that remains is as a loss;—that there is no adornment is a defect:—loss is met together with defect.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p5"></a>4.  If our mirror <i>be</i> darkness,—it is altogether joy to the hateful;—because their blemishes <i>are</i> not reproved:—but if polished and shining,—it is our freedom that is adorned.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p6"></a>5.  Twofold is the loss in defect,—for the hateful and for the goodly;—in that the goodly gain no crown,—and likewise the hateful get no adorning:—the mirror divides the loss.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p7"></a>6.  Never does the mirror drive—by compulsion him that looks therein:—<i>so</i> likewise grace which followed—upon the righteousness of the Law,—does not possess the compulsion of the Law.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p8"></a>7.  Righteousness was unto childhood,—its adorner of compulsion;—for when mankind was in childhood,—she adorned it by compulsion,—while she robbed it not of its freedom.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p9"></a>8.  Righteousness used blandishment,—and the rod <i>to deal</i> with childhood;—when she smote it she roused it; her rod restrained frowardness, her blandishment softened the minds.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p10"></a>          *          *          *          *          *          *          *          *          *          *          *</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p11"></a>9.  [If one turn from the Gospel,] wherewith we are adorned to-day, my brethren,—to another gospel he is a child:—in a time of greatness of understanding,—he is become without understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p12"></a>10.  For in the degree of full age,—he has gone down to childhood;—and he loves the law of bondmen,—which when he is confident smites him,—and when he rejoices buffets him.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p13"></a>11.  Whatsoever ornament <i>is</i> compulsion,—is not true but is borrowed.—This is a great thing in Gods eyes,—that a man should be adorned by himself:—therefore took He away compulsion.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p14"></a>12.  For even as of <i>His</i> prudence—in its <i>own</i> time He employed compulsion,—so <i>likewise</i> of His prudence,—He took it away at a time—when gentleness was desired in its stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p15"></a>13.  For as it is befitting to Youth,—that it should be made to haste under the rod;—<i>so</i> <i>is</i> it very hateful that under the rod—Wisdom should be brought to serve,—that compulsion should be lord over her.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p16"></a>14.  Behold therefore how likewise—God has ordered my successions—in the pastors I have had,—and in the teachers He has given me,—and in the fathers He has reckoned unto me!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p17"></a>15.  For weighed out according to their times—<i>were</i> the helps of their qualities;—namely in him in whom it was needful, fear; and in whom it was profitable, heartening; and in whom it was becoming, meekness.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p18"></a><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.xvii-Page_186"></a>16.  By measure He made my steps advance:—to my childhood He assigned terror; likewise to my youth, fear;—to my <i>age of</i> wisdom and prudence,—He assigned and gave meekness.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p19"></a>17.  In the frowardness of the degree of childhood,—<i>my</i> instructor was a fear to me:—his rod restrained me from wantonness,—and from mischief the terror of him,—and from indulgence the fear of him.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p20"></a>18.  Another father He gave to my youth:—what there was in me of childishness,—that was there in him of hardness; what there was in me of maturity,—that was in him <i>as</i> meekness.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p21"></a>19.  When I rose from the degrees—of childhood and of youth,—there passed away the terror <i>that was</i> first,—there passed away the fear <i>that</i> <i>was</i> second;—He gave me a kind pastor.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p22"></a>20.  Lo! for my full age his food;—and for my wisdom his interpretations;—and for my peace his meekness;—and for my repose his kindness;—and for my chastity his gravity!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p23"></a>21.  Blessed is He who as in a balance—weighed out and gave me fathers:—for according to my times <i>were</i> my helps;—and according to my sicknesses my medicines;—and according to my comelinesses my adornments!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p24"></a>22.  We then <i>are</i> they that have disturbed—the succession and fair order;—for in a time of mildness—lo! we crave for hardness,—that Thou should rebuke us as though <i>we were</i> children!</p>
