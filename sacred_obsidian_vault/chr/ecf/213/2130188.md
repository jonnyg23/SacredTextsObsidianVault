 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xii-p2"></a>1.  Thy chastening is, <i>as</i> a mother of our infancy:—her rebuke is merciful, in that Thou hast restrained,—the children from folly, and they have been made wise!  <i>R., Glory be to thy justice!</i></p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p3"></a>2.  Let us search out Thy justice; for who is sufficient—to measure its help? since by it the wanton—are oftentimes made chaste.—</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p4"></a>3.  Oftentimes Thy hand, O my Lord, has made the sick whole,—for it is the healer in secret of their diseases,—and the fount of their life.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p5"></a>4.  Exceeding gently, the finger of Thy justice,—in love and compassion, touches the wounds—of him that is to be healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p6"></a>5.  Exceeding mild and merciful, is her cutting to him that is wise:—her sharp remedy, in its mighty love,—consumes the corrupt <i>part</i>.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p7"></a>6.  Exceeding welcome her wrath, to him that is discerning;—but her remedies are hated, of the fool who has delight—in the trouble of his limbs.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p8"></a>7.  Exceeding eager is she, to bind the cut she has made;—when she has smitten she pities, that from between these two—she may breed healing.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p9"></a>8. Exceeding welcome her wrath, and her anger pleasant,—and sweet her bitterness, sweetening bitter things—that they may be made pleasant.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p10"></a>9.  A cause of negligence is Thy indulgence to the careless;—a cause of profit, is Thy rod among the slothful—so that they become <i>as</i> traffickers.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p11"></a>10.  The cause of our affliction, it is Thy justice;—the cause of our carelessness, it is Thy graciousness,—for our understanding has turned foolish.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p12"></a>11.  Pharaoh hardened himself, because of Thy graciousness;—for when the plagues were stayed, his cruelties waxed strong,—and he lied to his promises.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p13"></a>12.  Justice requited him, because he lied greatly against her,—even <i>Grace</i> her freeborn sister; yea she restrained him again—that he should not again provoke.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p14"></a>13.  Rebuke, O my Lord, my guide, for it has been false as Egypt —my prayers testify, that I am not as she,—for Thy door have I not forsaken.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p15"></a>14.  Let Thy cross, O my Lord, which stands, in my breaches that are open,—repair again the <i>breaches</i> that are hidden; for instead of those without,—those within have cleft me asunder!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p16"></a>15.  A sea has broken through, and cast down, the watch tower wherein I had triumphed.—Iniquity has dared to set up, a temple wherein I am shamed:  its drink-offering chokes me.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p17"></a>16.  My prayers on my walls, my persecutors have heard:—the sun and his worshippers, are ashamed of their magicians,—for I have triumphed by Thy cross.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p18"></a>17.  <i>All</i> creatures cried out, when they saw the struggle,—while Truth with falsehood, on my battered walls, fought and was crowned conqueror.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p19"></a>18.  The force of Truth, chastised falsehood:—in its chastisement it felt <i>Truth</i>, and through its <i>own</i> sins, it earned her victory.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p20"></a>19.  I have great alarm; for since my deliverance,—the honourable and mighty, who were devoted to my altar, have built in me high places.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p21"></a>20.  My seven senses, O my Lord, even though they had been as fountains of tears, yet my tears were <i>too</i> little—to lament our ruin.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p22"></a>21.  The streets that <i>were</i> in sackcloth, and ashes cried out,—disturbed by the play, akin to that which <i>was</i>,—in the wilderness before the calf.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p23"></a>22.  Poison seeks and wears, the beauty of lilies;—and though their buds may conceal, and hidden disguise it,—it blossoms in their bitter flowers.</p>
