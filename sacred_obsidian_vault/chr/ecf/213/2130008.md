 <p><a name="ii.v.ii-p4"></a>What we have learnt about our brother the bishop Januarius the bearers of these presents, as well as the copies of our letters, will sufficiently inform you; and so let thy Experience judiciously carry into effect the excommunication which we have decreed to be pronounced on his perverse counsellors, that they may learn by falling not to walk unwarily.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.ii-p5"></a>Moreover, we have sent back by Redemptus the guardian (<i>defensorem</i>), the bearer of these presents, the wheat which had been sent to us under the name of a present.  Let thy experience see that neither thou nor he who brought it presume to partake of anything out of it as a bounty <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a>
 , but restore the whole of it without abatement to the several persons, or to all of them together, and send me their receipts for the value; for, should I ascertain that anything has been done otherwise than as I direct, I will visit the offence with no slight severity.</p>
