 </p><p class="c16"><a name="iii.v.viii-p1"></a> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.v.viii-p1.1"></a>Hymn VII.</span></p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.viii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii-p2.1"></a>The</span> Son of the Maker is like unto His Father as Maker!  He made Himself a pure body, He clothed Himself with it, and came forth and clothed our weakness with glory, which in His mercy He brought from the Father.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p3"></a>From Melchizedek, the High Priest, a hyssop came to Thee, a throne and crown from the house of David, a race and family from Abraham.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p4"></a>Be thou unto me a Haven, for Thine own sake, O great Sea.  Lo! the Psalms of David Thy Father, and the words also of the Prophets, came forth unto me, as it were ships.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p5"></a>David Thy father, in the hundred and tenth Psalm, twined together two numbers as it were crowns to Thee, and came [to Thee], O Conqueror!  With these shalt Thou be crowned, and unto the throne shalt Thou ascend and sit.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p6"></a>A great crown is the number that is twined in the hundred, wherein is crowned Thy Godhead!  A little crown is that of the number ten, which crowns the Head of Thy Manhood, O Victorious One!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p7"></a>For Thy sake women sought after men.  Tamar desired him that was widowed, and Ruth loved a man that was old, yea, that Rahab, that led men captive, was captivated by Thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p8"></a>Tamar went forth, and in the darkness <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">458</font></a>
  stole the Light, and in uncleanness stole the Holy One, and by uncovering her nakedness she went in and stole Thee, O glorious One, that bringest the pure out of the impure.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p10"></a>Satan saw her and trembled, and hasted to trouble her.  He brought the judgment to her mind, and she feared not; stoning and the sword, and she trembled not.  He that teacheth adultery hindered adultery, because he was a hinderer of Thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p11"></a>For holy was the adultery of Tamar, for Thy sake.  Thee it was she thirsted after, O pure Fountain.  Judah defrauded her of drinking Thee.  The thirsty womb stole a dew-draught of Thee from the spring thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p12"></a>She was a widow for Thy sake.  Thee did she long for, she hasted and was also an harlot for Thy sake.  Thee did she vehemently desire, and was sanctified in that it was Thee she loved.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p13"></a>May Tamar rejoice that her Lord hath come and hath made her name known for the son of her adultery!  Surely the name she gave him <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">459</font></a>
  was calling unto Thee to come to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p15"></a>For Thee honorable women shamed themselves, Thou that givest chastity to all!  Thee she stole away in the midst of the ways, who pavest the way into the kingdom!  Because it was life that she stole, the sword was not able to put her to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p16"></a>Ruth lay down by a man in the threshingfloor for Thy sake; her love made her bold for Thy sake, O Thou that teachest all penitents boldness.  Her ears refused [to listen to] any voices for the sake of Thy voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p17"></a>The live coal that glowed went up into the bed, of Boaz, lay down there, saw the High Priest, in whose loins was hidden a fire for his incense! <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">460</font></a>
   She hasted and was a heifer to Boaz, that should bring forth Thee, the fatted Calf.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.viii-p19"></a><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a> <a name="iii.v.viii-Page_241"></a>She went gleaning for her love of Thee; she gathered straw.  Thou didst quickly pay her the reward of her lowliness; and instead of ears of corn, the Root of Kings, and instead of straws, the Sheaf of Life, didst Thou make to spring from her.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.viii-p18"></a> The introduction of Ruth after Tamara was doubtless suggested by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012">Ruth 4:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003">Matt. 1:3</a><a name="iii.v.viii-p18.1"></a>, etc.  St. E. seems to mean, “Ruth saw by faith Christ the High Priest, in whose loins was to be that Fire of Righteousness which alone could make the incense (i.e. the child which rose up from Ruth, who is called a coal) to be acceptable.”</p>
