 </p><p class="c16"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p1"></a> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p1.1"></a>Hymn XVI.</span></p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p2"></a>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p2.1"></a>Resp</span>.—<i>Glory to all of Thee from all of us!</i>  (bis.)</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p3"></a>1.  Who then that is mortal man, can declare concerning the All-Life giver,—Who quitted the height of His Majesty, and abased Himself to humility?—<i>Thou</i> Who exaltest all in Thy Birth, exalt my weak mind,—to declare of Thy Birth; not that I should search out Thy Majesty,—but that I should proclaim Thy grace.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p4"></a>R., Blessed be He Who conceals and reveals in His discourses!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p5"></a>2.  It is a great marvel that the Son, dwelt wholly in a body;—abode therein wholly and it sufficed for Him; dwelt therein though not bounded <i>thereby</i>.—His Will was wholly therein; His bounds reached wholly to His Father.—Who is sufficient to tell, how though He dwelt wholly in a body.—He likewise dwelt wholly in all?</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p6"></a>R., Blessed is He Who though without bounds was bounded!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p7"></a>3.  Thy Majesty is concealed from us; Thy Grace is revealed before us.—I will be silent, O Lord of Thy Majesty; and I will tell of Thy grace.—Thy grace clove to Thee, and bowed Thee down to our vileness:—Thy grace made Thee a babe; Thy grace made Thee man:—it straitened, it enlarged, Thy Majesty.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p8"></a>R., Blessed be the might that became little and became great!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p9"></a>4.  Glory to Him Who became lowly, though lofty He was by His nature!—He became in His love the firstborn of Mary, Firstborn though He be of Godhead.—He became in name the offspring of Joseph, offspring though He be of the Most High.—<a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a> <a name="iii.v.xvii-Page_256"></a>He became by His own Will man, God though He be by His Nature.—Glorified <i>be</i> Thy Will and Thy Nature!</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p10"></a>R., Blessed be Thy Glory which put on our image!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p11"></a>5.  Yea, O Lord, Thy Birth, has become mother of <i>all</i> creatures; for it travailed anew and gave birth, to mankind which gave birth to Thee.  Thou wast born of it bodily; it was born of Thee spiritually.—All that Thou camest <i>for</i> to birth, <i>was</i> that man might be born in Thy likeness.—Thy Birth became the author of birth to all.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p12"></a>R., Blessed be He Who became a youth and to all gave youth!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p13"></a>6.  When mans hope had broken down, hope was increased by Thy Birth.—Good tidings of hope they bore, the Heavenly Ones to men.—Satan who cut off our hope, his own hope by his own hands had cut off.—when he saw that hope was increased:  Thy Birth became to the hopeless,—a fountain teaming with hope.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p14"></a>R., Blessed be He Who bore the tidings of hope!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p15"></a>7.  The day of Thy Birth is like Thee, for it is desired and loved as Thou.—We who saw not Thy Birth, and its flame as in its own time,—in this Thy day we see Thee, even as Thou wast a babe;—beloved by all men, lo! in Thee the Churches rejoice;—Thy day adorns and is adorned.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p16"></a>R., Blessed be Thy day which was ordained for us!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p17"></a>8.  Thy day has given us a gift, to which the Father has none other like;—It was not Seraphim He sent us, nor yet did Cherubim come down among us;—there came not Watchers <i>or</i> Ministers, but the Firstborn to Whom they minister.—Who can suffice to give thanks, that the Majesty which is beyond measure—is laid in the lowly manger!</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p18"></a>R., Blessed be He Who gave us what He had won!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p19"></a>9.  That generation Thy Birth made glad, and our generation Thy day makes glad:  twofold <i>was</i> the happiness of that generation, for they saw Thy Birth and also Thy day:—less <i>is</i> the happiness of them that come after, for the day of Thy Birth they see only.—Yet because they that then were, doubted, greater is the happiness of them that come after,—who though they have not seen Thee have believed in Thee.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p20"></a>R., Blessed be Thy happiness that is added to us!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p21"></a>10.  The Magi exalted from afar; the Scribes murmured near at hand;—the prophet showed his message, and Herod his wrath;—the scribes showed their doctrine, the Magi showed their offerings.  It is a marvel that to Him, the Babe, they of His own house hasted with their swords, and they that were strangers with their offerings.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p22"></a>R., Blessed be Thy Birth which has stirred up all!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p23"></a>11.  The bosom of Mary amazes me, that it sufficed for Thee, Lord, and embraced Thee.—All creation were too small, to conceal Thy Majesty;—Heaven and earth too narrow, to be in the likeness of wings, <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">506</font></a>
  to cover Thy Godhead.—Too small for Thee was the bosom of earth; great enough for Thee was the bosom of Mary.—He dwelt in the bosom and healed in her bosom.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p25"></a>R.,</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p26"></a>12.  He was wrapped meanly in swaddling clothes, and offerings were offered Him.—He put on garments in youth, and from them there came forth helps:  He put on the waters of baptism, and from them there shone forth beams:—He put on linen cloths in death, and in them were shown forth triumphs; with His humiliations, His exaltations.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p27"></a>R., Blessed be He Who joined His Glory to His Passion!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p28"></a>13.  All these <i>are</i> the changes of raiment, which Mercy put off and put on,—when He strove to put on Adam, the glory which he had put off.—He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes as <i>Adam</i> with leaves; and clad in garments instead of skins.—He was baptized for <i>Adams</i> sin, and buried for <i>Adams</i> death:—He rose and raised <i>Adam</i> into Glory.</p> 
 <p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xvii-p29"></a>R., Blessed be He Who came down and clothed him and went up!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p30"></a><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> <a name="iii.v.xvii-Page_257"></a>14.  Though Thy Birth had sufficed, for Adams sons as for Adam;—O Mighty One Who didst become a babe, in Thy Birth anew hast Thou begotten me!—O pure One Who wast baptized, let Thy Washing wash away our filth—O Living One who wast buried, may we gain life in Thy death!—I will praise all of Thee in Him that fills all.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.v.xvii-p31"></a><i>R., Glory to all of Thee from all of us!</i></p>
