 </p><p class="c41"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p1.1"></a>Letter LXVII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p2"></a>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 402.)</p>  
 <p class="c40"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p3"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p3.1"></a>To My Lord Most Beloved and Longed For, My Honoured Brother in Christ, and Fellow-Presbyter, Jerome, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span></p>  
 <p><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p4"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p4.1"></a>Chap. I.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p5"></a>1. I have heard that my letter has come to your hand. I have not yet received a reply, but I do not on this account question your affection; doubtless something has hitherto prevented you. Wherefore I know and avow that my prayer should be, that God would put it in your power to forward your reply, for He has already given you power to prepare it, seeing that you can do so with the utmost ease if you feel disposed.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p6"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p6.1"></a>Chap. II.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p7"></a>2. I have hesitated whether to give credence or not to a certain report which has reached me; but I felt that I ought not to hesitate as to writing a few lines to you regarding the matter. To be brief, I have heard that some brethren have told your Charity that I have written a book against you and have sent it to Rome. Be assured that this is false: I call God to witness that I have not done this. But if perchance there be some things in some of my writings in which I am found to have been of a different opinion from you, I think you ought to know, or if it cannot be certainly known, at least to believe, that such things have been written not with a view of contradicting you, but only of stating my own views. In saying this, however, let me assure you that not only am I most ready to hear in a brotherly spirit the objections which you may entertain to anything in my writings which has displeased you, but I entreat, nay implore you, to acquaint me with them; and thus I shall be made glad either by the correction of my mistake, or at least by the expression of your goodwill.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p8"></a>3. Oh that it were in my power, by our living near each other, if not under the same roof, to enjoy frequent and sweet conference with you in the Lord! Since, however, this is not granted, I beg you to take pains that this one way in which we can be together in the Lord be kept up; nay more, improved and perfected. Do not refuse to write me in return, however seldom.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVII-p9"></a>Greet with my respects our holy brother Paulinianus, and all the brethren who with you, and because of you, rejoice in the Lord. May you, remembering us, be heard by the Lord in regard to all your holy desires, my lord most beloved and longed for, my honoured brother in Christ.</p>
