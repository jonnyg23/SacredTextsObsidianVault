Commenting on this passage of the Apocrypha (<i>De Mus</i>. vi. 40), he says, that while the souls happiness and life is in God, “what is to go into outer things, but to cast out its <i>inward parts</i>, that is, to place itself far from God—not by distance of place, but by the affection of the mind?”</p>
