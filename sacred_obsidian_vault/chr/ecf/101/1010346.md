 <p class="c58"><a name="vii.1.XXXIX-p3"></a><i><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.XXXIX-p3.1"></a>To My Lord Augustin, a Father</span></i> <a name="fr_1602"></a><a href="#fn_1602"><font size="1">1603</font></a>
 <i><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.XXXIX-p4.1"></a>Truly Holy and Most Blessed, Jerome Sends Greeting in Christ.</span></i></p>

 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XXXIX-p6"></a>1. Last year I sent by the hand of our brother, the subdeacon Asterius, a letter conveying to your Excellency a salutation due to you, and readily rendered by me; and I think that my letter was delivered to you. I now write again, by my holy brother the deacon Præsidius, begging you in the first place not to forget me, and in the second place to receive the bearer of this letter, whom I commend to you with the request that you recognise him as one very near and dear to me, and that you encourage and help him in whatever way his circumstances may demand; not that he is in need of anything (for Christ has amply endowed him), but that he is most eagerly desiring the friendship of good men, and thinks that in securing this he obtains the most valuable blessing. His design in travelling to the West you may learn from his own lips.</p>

 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XXXIX-p8"></a>2. As for us, established here in our monastery, we feel the shock of waves on every side, and are burdened with the cares of our lot as pilgrims. But we believe in Him who hath said, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,” <a name="fr_1603"></a><a href="#fn_1603"><font size="1">1604</font></a>
  and are confident that by His grace and guidance we shall prevail against our adversary the devil.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XXXIX-p10"></a>I beseech you to give my respectful salutation to the holy and venerable brother, our father Alypius. The brethren who, with me, devote themselves to serve the Lord in this monastery, salute you warmly. May Christ our Almighty God guard you from harm, and keep you mindful of me, my lord and father truly holy and venerable.</p>
