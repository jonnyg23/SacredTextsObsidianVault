 </p><p class="c41"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p1.1"></a>Letter CCVIII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p2"></a>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 423.)</p>  
 <p class="c40"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p3"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p3.1"></a>To the Lady Felicia, His Daughter in the Faith, and Worthy of Honour Among the Members of Christ, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p4"></a>1. I do not doubt, when I consider both your faith and the weakness or wickedness of others, that your mind has been disturbed, for even a holy apostle, full of compassionate love, confesses a similiar experience, saying, “Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?” <a name="fr_2893"></a><a href="#fn_2893"><font size="1">2894</font></a>
  Wherefore, as I myself share your pain, and am solicitous for your welfare in Christ, I have thought it my duty to address this letter, partly consolatory, partly hortatory, to your Holiness, because in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, in which all His members are one, you are very closely related to us, being loved as an honourable member in that body, and partaking with us of life in His Holy Spirit.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p6"></a>2. I exhort you, therefore, not to be too much troubled by those offences which for this very reason were foretold as destined to come, that when they came we might remember that they had been foretold, and not be greatly disconcerted by them. For the Lord Himself in His gospel foretold them, saying, “Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe unto that man by whom the offence cometh!” <a name="fr_2894"></a><a href="#fn_2894"><font size="1">2895</font></a>
  These are the men of whom the apostle said, “They seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christs.” <a name="fr_2895"></a><a href="#fn_2895"><font size="1">2896</font></a>
  There are, therefore, some who hold the honourable office of shepherds in order that they may provide for the flock of Christ; others occupy that position that they may enjoy the temporal honours and secular advantages connected with the office. It must needs happen that these two kinds of pastors, some dying, others succeeding them, should continue in the Catholic Church even to the end of time, and the judgment of the Lord. If, then, in the times of the apostles there were men such that Paul, grieved by their conduct, enumerates among his trials, “perils among false brethren,” <a name="fr_2896"></a><a href="#fn_2896"><font size="1">2897</font></a>
  and yet he did not haughtily cast them out, but patiently bore with them, how much more must such arise in our times, since the Lord most plainly says concerning this age which is drawing to a close, “that because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold.” <a name="fr_2897"></a><a href="#fn_2897"><font size="1">2898</font></a>
  The word which follows, however, ought to console and exhort us, for He adds, “He that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.”</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p11"></a>3. Moreover, as there are good shepherds and bad shepherds, so also in flocks there are good and bad. The good are represented by the name of sheep, but the bad are called goats: they feed, nevertheless, side by side in the same pastures, until the Chief Shepherd, who is called the One Shepherd, shall come and separate them one from another according to His promise, “as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats.” On us He has laid the duty of gathering the flock; to Himself He has reserved the work of final separation, because it pertains properly to Him who cannot err. For those presumptuous servants, who have lightly ventured to separate before the time which the Lord has reserved in His own hand, have, instead of <a name="page_559"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 559</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CCVIII-Page_559"></a>separating others, only been separated themselves from Catholic unity; for how could those have a clean flock who have by schism become unclean?</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p12"></a>4. In order, therefore, that we may remain in the unity of the faith, and not, stumbling at the offences occasioned by the chaff, desert the threshing-floor of the Lord, but rather remain as wheat till the final winnowing, <a name="fr_2898"></a><a href="#fn_2898"><font size="1">2899</font></a>
  and by the love which imparts stability to us bear with the beaten straw, our great Shepherd in the gospel admonishes us concerning the good shepherds, that we should not, on account of their good works, place our hope in them, but glorify our heavenly Father for making them such; and concerning the bad shepherds (whom He designed to point out under the name of Scribes and Pharisees), He reminds us that they teach that which is good though they do that which is evil. <a name="fr_2899"></a><a href="#fn_2899"><font size="1">2900</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p15"></a>5. Concerning the good shepherds He thus speaks: “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” <a name="fr_2900"></a><a href="#fn_2900"><font size="1">2901</font></a>
  Concerning the bad shepherds He admonishes the sheep in these words: “The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat: all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.” <a name="fr_2901"></a><a href="#fn_2901"><font size="1">2902</font></a>
  When these are listened to, the sheep of Christ, even through evil teachers, hear His voice, and do not forsake the unity of His flock, because the good which they hear them teach belongs not to the shepherds but to Him, and therefore the sheep are safely fed, since even under bad shepherds they are nourished in the Lords pastures. They do not, however, imitate the actions of the bad shepherds, because such actions belong not to the world but to the shepherds themselves. In regard, however, to those whom they see to be good shepherds, they not only hear the good things which they teach, but also imitate the good actions which they perform. Of this number was the apostle, who said: “Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.” <a name="fr_2902"></a><a href="#fn_2902"><font size="1">2903</font></a>
  He was a light kindled by the Eternal Light, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and was placed on a candlestick because He gloried in His cross, concerning which he said: “God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <a name="fr_2903"></a><a href="#fn_2903"><font size="1">2904</font></a>
  Moreover, since he sought not his own things, but the things which are Jesus Christs, whilst he exhorts to the imitation of his own life those whom he had “begotten through the gospel,” <a name="fr_2904"></a><a href="#fn_2904"><font size="1">2905</font></a>
  he yet severely reproved those who, by the names of apostles, introduced schisms, and he chides those who said, “I am of Paul; was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?” <a name="fr_2905"></a><a href="#fn_2905"><font size="1">2906</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p22"></a>6. Hence we understand both that the good shepherds are those who seek not their own, but the things of Jesus Christ, and that the good sheep, though imitating the works of the good shepherds by whose ministry they have been gathered together, do not place their hope in them, but rather in the Lord, by Whose blood they are redeemed; so that when they may happen to be placed under bad shepherds, preaching Christs doctrine and doing their own evil works, they will do what they teach, but will not do what they do, and will not, on account of these sons of wickedness, forsake the pastures of the one true Church. For there are both good and bad in the Catholic Church, which, unlike the Donatist sect, is extended and spread abroad, not in Africa only, but through all nations; as the apostle expresses it, “bringing forth fruit, and increasing in the whole world.” <a name="fr_2906"></a><a href="#fn_2906"><font size="1">2907</font></a>
  But those who are separated from the Church, as long as they are opposed to it cannot be good; although an apparently praiseworthy conversation seems to prove some of them to be good, their separation from the Church itself renders them bad, according to the saying of the Lord: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.” <a name="fr_2907"></a><a href="#fn_2907"><font size="1">2908</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCVIII-p25"></a>7. Therefore, my daughter, worthy of all welcome and honour among the members of Christ, I exhort you to hold faithfully that which the Lord has committed to you, and love with all your heart Him and His Church who suffered you not, by joining yourself with the lost, to lose the recompense of your virginity, or perish with them. For if you should depart out of this world separated from the unity of the body of Christ, it will avail you nothing to have preserved inviolate your virginity. But God, who is rich in mercy, has done in regard to you that which is written in the gospel: when the invited guests excused themselves to the master of the feast, he said to the servants, “Go ye, therefore, into the highways and hedges, and as many as ye shall find compel them to come in.” <a name="fr_2908"></a><a href="#fn_2908"><font size="1">2909</font></a>
  Although, however, you owe sincerest affection to those good servants of His through whose instrumentality you were compelled to come in, yet it is your duty, <a name="page_560"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 560</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CCVIII-Page_560"></a>nevertheless, to place your hope on Him who prepared the banquet, by whom also you have been persuaded to come to eternal and blessed life. Committing to Him your heart, your vow, and your sacred virginity, and your faith, hope, and charity, you will not be moved by offences, which shall abound even to the end; but, by the unshaken strength of piety, shall be safe and shall triumph in the Lord, continuing in the unity of His body even to the end. Let me know, by your answer, with what sentiments you regard my anxiety for you, to which I have to the best of my ability given expression in this letter. May the grace and mercy of God ever protect you!</p>
