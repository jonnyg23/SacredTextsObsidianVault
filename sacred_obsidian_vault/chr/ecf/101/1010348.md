 <p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.XLI-p2"></a>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.XLI-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 397.)</p>  
 <p class="c40"><a name="vii.1.XLI-p3"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.XLI-p3.1"></a>To Father Aurelius, Our Lord Most Blessed and Worthy of Veneration, Our Brother Most Sincerely Beloved, and Our Partner in the Sacerdotal Office, Alypius and Augustin Send Greeting in the Lord.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLI-p4"></a>1. “Our mouth is filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing,” <a name="fr_1618"></a><a href="#fn_1618"><font size="1">1619</font></a>
  by your letter informing us that, by the help of that God whose inspiration guided you, you have carried into effect your pious purpose concerning all our brethren in orders, and especially concerning the regular delivering of a sermon to the people in your presence by the presbyters, through whose tongues thus engaged your love sounds louder in the hearts than their voice does in the ears of men. Thanks be unto God! Is there anything better for us to have in our heart, or utter with our lips, or record with our pen, than this? Thanks be unto God! No other phrase is more easily spoken, and nothing more pleasant in sound, profound in significance, and profitable in practice, than this. Thanks be unto God, who has endowed you with a heart so true to the interests of your sons, and who has brought to light what you had latent in the inner soul, beyond the reach of human eye, giving you not only the will to do good, but the means of realizing your desires. So be it, certainly so be it! let these works shine before men, that they may see them, and rejoice and glorify your Father in heaven. <a name="fr_1619"></a><a href="#fn_1619"><font size="1">1620</font></a>
  In such things delight yourself in the Lord; and may your prayers for these presbyters be graciously heard on their behalf by Him whose voice you do not consider it beneath you to hear when He speaks by them! May they go on, and walk, yea, run in the way of the Lord! May the small and the great be blessed together, being made glad by those who say unto them, “Let us go into the house of the Lord!” <a name="fr_1620"></a><a href="#fn_1620"><font size="1">1621</font></a>
  Let the stronger lead; let the weaker imitate their example, being followers of them, as they are of Christ. May we all be as ants pursuing eagerly the path of holy industry, as bees labouring amidst the fragrance of holy duty; and may fruit be brought forth in patience by the saving grace of stedfastness unto the end! May the Lord “not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able, but with the temptation may He make a way to escape, that we may be able to bear it”! <a name="fr_1621"></a><a href="#fn_1621"><font size="1">1622</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLI-p9"></a>2. Pray for us: we value your prayers as worthy to be heard, since you go to God with so great an offering of unfeigned love, and of praise brought to Him by your works. Pray that in us also these works may shine, for He to whom you pray knows with what fulness of joy we behold them shining in you. Such are our desires; such are the abounding comforts which in the multitude of our thoughts within us delight our souls. <a name="fr_1622"></a><a href="#fn_1622"><font size="1">1623</font></a>
  It is so now because such is the promise of God; and as He hath promised, so shall it be in the time to come. We beseech you, by Him who hath blessed you, and has by you bestowed this blessing on the people whom you serve, to order any of the presbyters sermons which you please to be transcribed, and after revisal sent to us. For I on my part am not neglecting what you required of me; and as I have written often before, I am still longing to know what you think of Tychonius seven Rules or Keys. <a name="fr_1623"></a><a href="#fn_1623"><font size="1">1624</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLI-p12"></a>We warmly commend to you our brother Hilarinus, leading physician and magistrate of Hippo. As to our brother Romanus, we know how actively you are exerting yourself on his behalf, and that we need ask nothing but that God may prosper your endeavours.</p>
