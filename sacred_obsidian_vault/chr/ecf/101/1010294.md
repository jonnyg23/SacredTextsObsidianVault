 <p class="c10"><a name="vi.XIII.XXVIII-p2"></a>43. And Thou, O God, sawest everything that Thou hadst made, and behold it was very good. <a name="fr_1416"></a><a href="#fn_1416"><font size="1">1417</font></a>
  So we also see the same, and behold all are very good. In each particular kind of Thy works, when Thou hadst said, “Let them be made,” and they were made, Thou sawest that it was good. Seven times have I counted it written that Thou sawest that that which Thou madest was “good;” and this is the eighth, that Thou sawest all things that Thou hadst made, and behold they are not only good, but also “very good,” as being now taken together. For individually they were only good, but all taken together they were both good and very good. All beautiful bodies also express this; for a body which consists of members, all of which are beautiful, is by far more beautiful than the several members individually are by whose well-ordered union the whole is completed, though these members also be severally beautiful. <a name="fr_1417"></a><a href="#fn_1417"><font size="1">1418</font></a>
