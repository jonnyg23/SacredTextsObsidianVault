 <p class="c10"><a name="vi.XIII.IV-p2"></a>5. What, therefore, could there be wanting unto Thy good, which Thou Thyself art, although these things had either never been, or had remained formless,—the which Thou madest not out of any want, but out of the plenitude of Thy goodness, restraining them and converting them to form not as though Thy joy were perfected by them? For to Thee, being perfect, their imperfection is displeasing, and therefore were they perfected by Thee, and were pleasing unto Thee; but not as if Thou wert imperfect, and wert to be perfected in their perfection. For Thy good Spirit was borne over the waters, <a name="fr_1177"></a><a href="#fn_1177"><font size="1">1178</font></a>
  not borne up by them as if He rested upon them. For those in whom Thy good Spirit is said to rest, <a name="fr_1178"></a><a href="#fn_1178"><font size="1">1179</font></a>
  He causes to rest in Himself. But Thy incorruptible and unchangeable will, which in itself is all-sufficient for itself, was borne over that life which Thou hadst made, to which to live is not all one with living happily, since, flowing in its own darkness, it liveth also; for which it remaineth to be converted unto Him by whom it was made, and to live more and more by “the fountain of life,” and in His light to “see light,” <a name="fr_1179"></a><a href="#fn_1179"><font size="1">1180</font></a>
  and to be perfected, and enlightened, and made happy.</p>
