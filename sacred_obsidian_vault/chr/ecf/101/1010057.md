 </p><p class="c41"><a name="vi.III.XI-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="vi.III.XI-p1.1"></a>Chapter XI.—He Refers to the Tears, and the Memorable Dream Concerning Her Son, Granted by God to His Mother.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vi.III.XI-p2"></a>19. And Thou sendedst Thine hand from above, <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">261</font></a>
  and drewest my soul out of that profound darkness, when my mother, Thy faithful one, wept to thee on my behalf more than mothers are wont to weep the bodily death of their children. For she saw that I was dead by that faith and spirit which she had from Thee, and Thou heardest her, O Lord. Thou heardest her, and despisedst not her tears, when, pouring down, they watered the earth <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">262</font></a>
  under her eyes in every place where she prayed; yea, Thou heardest her. For whence was that dream with which Thou consoledst her, so that she permitted me to live with her, and to have my meals at the same table in the house, which she had begun to avoid, hating and detesting the blasphemies of my error? For she saw herself standing on a certain wooden rule, <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">263</font></a>
  and a bright youth advancing towards her, joyous and smiling <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a> <a name="vi.III.XI-Page_67"></a>upon her, whilst she was grieving and bowed down with sorrow. But he having inquired of her the cause of her sorrow and daily weeping (he wishing to teach, as is their wont, and not to be taught), and she answering that it was my perdition she was lamenting, he bade her rest contented, and told her to behold and see “that where she was, there was I also.” And when she looked she saw me standing near her on the same rule. Whence was this, unless that Thine ears were inclined towards her heart? O Thou Good Omnipotent, who so carest for every one of us as if Thou caredst for him only, and so for all as if they were but one!</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vi.III.XI-p6"></a>20. Whence was this, also, that when she had narrated this vision to me, and I tried to put this construction on it, “That she rather should not despair of being some day what I was,” she immediately, without hesitation, replied, “No; for it was not told me that where he is, there shalt thou be, but where thou art, there shall he be”? I confess to Thee, O Lord, that, to the best of my remembrance (and I have oft spoken of this), Thy answer through my watchful mother—that she was not disquieted by the speciousness of my false interpretation, and saw in a moment what was to be seen, and which I myself had not in truth perceived before she spoke—even then moved me more than the dream itself, by which the happiness to that pious woman, to be realized so long after, was, for the alleviation of her present anxiety, so long before predicted. For nearly nine years passed in which I wallowed in the slime of that deep pit and the darkness of falsehood, striving often to rise, but being all the more heavily dashed down. But yet that chaste, pious, and sober widow (such as Thou lovest), now more buoyed up with hope, though no whit less zealous in her weeping and mourning, desisted not, at all the hours of her supplications, to bewail my case unto Thee. And her prayers entered into Thy presence, <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">264</font></a>
  and yet Thou didst still suffer me to be involved and re-involved in that darkness.</p>
