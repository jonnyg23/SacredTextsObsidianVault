 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.7-p2"></a>It is very right that these blessed and immortal spirits, who inhabit celestial dwellings, and rejoice in the communications of their Creators fullness, firm in His eternity, assured in His truth, holy by His grace, since they compassionately and tenderly regard us miserable mortals, and wish us to become immortal and happy, do not desire us to sacrifice to themselves, but to Him whose sacrifice they know themselves to be in common with us.  For we and they together are the one city of God, to which it is said in the psalm, “Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God;” <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">398</font></a>
  the human part sojourning here below, the angelic aiding from above.  For from that heavenly city, in which Gods will is the intelligible and unchangeable law, from that heavenly council-chamber,—for they sit in counsel regarding us,—that holy Scripture, descended to us by the ministry of angels, in which it is written, “He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed,” <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">399</font></a>
 —this Scripture, this law, these precepts, have been confirmed by such miracles, that it is sufficiently evident to whom these immortal and blessed spirits, who desire us to be like themselves, wish us to sacrifice.</p>
