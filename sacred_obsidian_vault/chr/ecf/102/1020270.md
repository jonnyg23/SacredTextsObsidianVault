 <p> <a name="iv.IX.23"></a>  <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a> <a name="iv.IX.23-Page_178"></a>  
 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.IX.23-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.IX.23-p1.1"></a>Chapter 23.—That the Name of Gods is Falsely Given to the Gods of the Gentiles, Though Scripture Applies It Both to the Holy Angels and Just Men.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.IX.23-p2"></a>If the Platonists prefer to call these angels gods rather than demons, and to reckon them with those whom Plato, their founder and master, maintains were created by the supreme God, <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">362</font></a>
  they are welcome to do so, for I will not spend strength in fighting about words.  For if they say that these beings are immortal, and yet created by the supreme God, blessed but by cleaving to their Creator and not by their own power, they say what we say, whatever name they call these beings by.  And that this is the opinion either of all or the best of the Platonists can be ascertained by their writings.  And regarding the name itself, if they see fit to call such blessed and immortal creatures gods, this need not give rise to any serious discussion between us, since in our own Scriptures we read, “The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken;” <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">363</font></a>
  and again, “Confess to the God of gods;” <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">364</font></a>
  and again, “He is a great King above all gods.” <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">365</font></a>
   And where it is said, “He is to be feared above all gods,” the reason is forthwith added, for it follows, “for all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.” <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">366</font></a>
   He said, “above all gods,” but added, “of the nations;” that is to say, above all those whom the nations count gods, in other words, demons.  By them He is to be feared with that terror in which they cried to the Lord, “Hast Thou come to destroy us?”  But where it is said, “the God of gods,” it cannot be understood as the god of the demons; and far be it from us to say that “great King above all gods” means “great King above all demons.”  But the same Scripture also calls men who belong to Gods people “gods:”  “I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you children of the Most High.” <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">367</font></a>
   Accordingly, when God is styled God of gods, this may be understood of these gods; and so, too, when He is styled a great King above all gods.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.IX.23-p9"></a> Nevertheless, some one may say, if men are called gods because they belong to Gods people, whom He addresses by means of men and angels, are not the immortals, who already enjoy that felicity which men seek to attain by worshipping God, much more worthy of the title?  And what shall we reply to this, if not that it is not without reason that in holy Scripture men are more expressly styled gods than those immortal and blessed spirits to whom we hope to be equal in the resurrection, because there was a fear that the weakness of unbelief, being overcome with the excellence of these beings, might presume to constitute some of them a god?  In the case of men this was a result that need not be guarded against.  Besides, it was right that the men belonging to Gods people should be more expressly called gods, to assure and certify them that He who is called God of gods is their God; because, although those immortal and blessed spirits who dwell in the heavens are called gods, yet they are not called gods of gods, that is to say, gods of the men who constitute Gods people, and to whom it is said, “I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you the children of the Most High.”  Hence the saying of the apostle, “Though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him.” <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">368</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.IX.23-p11"></a>We need not, therefore, laboriously contend about the name, since the reality is so obvious as to admit of no shadow of doubt.  That which we say, that the angels who are sent to announce the will of God to men belong to the order of blessed immortals, does not satisfy the Platonists, because they believe that this ministry is discharged, not by those whom they call gods, in other words, not by blessed immortals, but by demons, whom they dare not affirm to be blessed, but only immortal, or if they do rank them among the blessed immortals, yet only as good demons, and not as gods who dwell in the heaven of heavens remote from all human contact.  But, though it may seem mere wrangling about a name, yet the name of demon is so detestable that we cannot bear in any sense to apply it to the holy angels.  Now, therefore, let us close this book in the assurance that, whatever we call these immortal and blessed spirits, who yet are only creatures, they do not act as mediators to introduce to everlasting felicity miserable mortals, from whom they are severed by a twofold distinction.  And those others who are mediators, in so far as they have immortality in common with their superiors, and misery in common with their inferiors (for they are justly miserable in punishment of their wickedness), cannot bestow upon us, but rather grudge that we should possess, the blessedness from which they themselves are excluded.  And so the friends of the demons have nothing considerable to allege why we should rather worship them as  <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a> <a name="iv.IX.23-Page_179"></a>  our helpers than avoid them as traitors to our interests.  As for those spirits who are good, and who are therefore not only immortal but also blessed, and to whom they suppose we should give the title of gods, and offer worship and sacrifices for the sake of inheriting a future life, we shall, by Gods help, endeavor in the following book to show that these spirits, call them by what name, and ascribe to them what nature you will, desire that religious worship be paid to God alone, by whom they were created, and by whose communications of Himself to them they are blessed.</p>
