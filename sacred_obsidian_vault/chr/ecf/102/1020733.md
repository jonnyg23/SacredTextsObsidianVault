 <p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxxvii-p2"></a>For if he takes up rashly a meaning which the author whom he is reading did not intend, he often falls in with other statements which he cannot harmonize with this meaning.  And if he admits that these statements are true and certain, then it follows that the meaning he had put upon the former passage cannot be the true one:  and so it comes to pass, one can hardly tell how, that, out of love for his own opinion, he begins to feel more angry with Scripture than he is with himself.  And if he should once permit that evil to creep in, it will utterly destroy him.  “For we walk by faith, not by sight.” <a name="fr_1753"></a><a href="#fn_1753"><font size="1">1754</font></a>
   Now faith will totter if the authority of Scripture begin to shake.  And then, if faith totter, love itself will grow cold.  For if a man has fallen from faith, he must necessarily also fall from love; for he cannot love what he does not believe to exist.  But if he both believes and loves, then through good works, and through diligent attention to the precepts of morality, he comes to hope also that he shall attain the object of his love.  And so these are the three things to which all knowledge and all prophecy are subservient:  faith, hope, love.</p>
