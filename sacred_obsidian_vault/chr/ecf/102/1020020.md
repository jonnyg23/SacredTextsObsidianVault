 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.ii.xv-p2"></a>But, say they, many Christians were even led away captive.  This indeed were a most pitiable fate, if they could be led away to any place where they could not find their God.  But for this calamity also sacred Scripture affords great consolation.  The three youths <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">73</font></a>
  were captives; Daniel was a captive; so were other prophets:  and God, the comforter, did not fail them.  And in like manner He has not failed His own people in the power of a nation which, though barbarous, is yet human,—He who did not abandon the prophet <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">74</font></a>
  in the belly of a monster.  These things, indeed, are turned to ridicule rather than credited by those with whom we are debating; though they believe what they read in their own books, that Arion of Methymna, the famous lyrist, <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">75</font></a>
  when he was thrown overboard, was received on a dolphins back and carried to land.  But that story of ours about the prophet Jonah is far more incredible,—more incredible because more marvellous, and more marvellous because a greater exhibition of power.</p>
