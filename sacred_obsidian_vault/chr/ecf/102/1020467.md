 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVI.18-p2"></a>Abraham, then, having departed out of Haran in the seventy-fifth year of his own age, and in the hundred and forty-fifth of his fathers, went with Lot, his brothers son, and Sarah his wife, into the land of Canaan, and came even to Sichem, where again he received the divine oracle, of which it is thus written:  “And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said unto him, Unto thy seed will I give this land.” <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">904</font></a>
