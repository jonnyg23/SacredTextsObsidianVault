 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIV.10-p2"></a>But it is a fair question, whether our first parent or first parents (for there was a marriage of two), before they sinned, experienced in their animal body such emotions as we shall not experience in the spiritual body when sin has been purged and finally abolished.  For if they did, then how were they blessed in that boasted place of bliss, Paradise?  For who that is affected by fear or grief can be called absolutely blessed?  And what could those persons fear or suffer in such affluence of blessings, where neither death nor ill-health was feared, and where nothing was wanting which a good will could desire, and nothing present which could interrupt mans mental or bodily enjoyment?  Their love to God was unclouded, and their mutual affection was that of faithful and sincere marriage; and from this love flowed a wonderful delight, because they always enjoyed what was loved.  Their avoidance of sin was tranquil; and, so long as it was maintained, no other ill at all could invade them and bring sorrow.  Or did they perhaps desire to touch and eat the forbidden fruit, yet feared to die; and thus both fear and desire already, even in that blissful place, preyed upon those first of mankind?  Away with the thought that such could be the case where there was no sin!  And, indeed, this is already sin, to desire those things which the law of God forbids, and to abstain from them through fear of punishment, not through love of righteousness.  Away, I say, with the thought, that before there was any sin, there should already have been committed regarding that fruit the very sin which our Lord warns us against regarding a woman:  “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” <a name="fr_720"></a><a href="#fn_720"><font size="1">721</font></a>
   As happy, then, as were these our first parents, who were agitated by no mental perturbations, and annoyed by no bodily discomforts, so happy should the whole human race have been, had they not introduced that evil which they have transmitted to their posterity, and had none of their descendants committed iniquity worthy of damnation; but this original blessedness continuing until, in virtue of that benediction which said, “Increase and multiply,” <a name="fr_721"></a><a href="#fn_721"><font size="1">722</font></a>
  the number of the predestined saints should have been completed, there would then have been bestowed that higher felicity which is enjoyed by the most blessed angels,—a blessedness in which there should have been a secure assurance that no one would sin, and no one die; and so should the saints have lived, after no taste of labor, pain, or death, as now they shall live in the resurrection, after they have endured all these things.</p>
