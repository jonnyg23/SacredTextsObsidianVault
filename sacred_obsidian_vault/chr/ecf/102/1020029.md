 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.ii.xxiv-p2"></a>Besides Lucretia, of whom enough has already been said, our advocates of suicide have some difficulty in finding any other prescriptive example, unless it be that of Cato, who killed himself at Utica.  His example is appealed to, not because he was the only man who did so, but because he was so esteemed as a learned and excellent man, that it could plausibly be maintained that what he did was and is a good thing to do.  But of this action of his, what can I say but that his own friends, enlightened men as he, prudently dissuaded him, and therefore judged his act to be that of a feeble rather than a strong spirit, and dictated not by honorable feeling forestalling shame, but by weakness shrinking from hardships?  Indeed, Cato condemns himself by the advice he gave to his dearly loved son.  For if it was a disgrace to live under Cæsars rule, why did the father urge the son to this disgrace, by encouraging him to trust absolutely to Cæsars generosity?  Why did he not persuade him to die along with himself?  If Torquatus was applauded for putting his son to death, when contrary to orders he had engaged, and engaged successfully, with the enemy, why did conquered Cato spare his conquered son, though he did not spare himself?  Was it more disgraceful to be a victor contrary to orders, than to submit to a victor contrary to the received ideas of honor?  Cato, then, cannot have deemed it to be shameful to live under Cæsars rule; for had he done so, the fathers sword would have delivered his son from this disgrace.  The truth is, that his son, whom he both hoped and desired would be spared by Cæsar, was not more loved by him than Cæsar was envied the glory of pardoning him (as indeed Cæsar himself is reported to have said <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a>
 ); or if envy is too strong a word, let us say he was <i>ashamed</i> that this glory should be his.</p>
