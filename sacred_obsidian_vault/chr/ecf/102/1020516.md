 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVII.23-p2"></a>So also in the kingdom of Judah pertaining to Jerusalem prophets were not lacking even in the times of succeeding kings, just as it pleased God to send them, either for the prediction of what was needful, or for correction of sin and instruction in righteousness; <a name="fr_1131"></a><a href="#fn_1131"><font size="1">1132</font></a>
  for there, too, although far less than in Israel, kings arose who grievously offended God by their impieties, and, along with their people, who were like them, were smitten with moderate scourges.  The no small merits of the pious kings there are praised indeed.  But we read that in Israel the kings were, some more, others less, yet all wicked.  Each part, therefore, as the divine providence either ordered or permitted, was both lifted up by prosperity and weighed down by adversity of various kinds; and it was afflicted not only by foreign, but also by civil wars with each other, in order that by certain existing causes the mercy or anger of God might be manifested; until, by His growing indignation, that whole nation was by the conquering Chaldeans not only overthrown in its abode, but also for the most part transported to the lands of the Assyrians,—first, that part of the thirteen tribes called Israel, but afterwards Judah also, when Jerusalem and that most noble temple was cast down,—in which lands it rested seventy years in captivity.  Being after that time sent forth thence, they rebuilt the overthrown temple.  And although very many stayed in the lands of the strangers, yet the kingdom no longer had two separate parts, with different kings over each, but in Jerusalem there was  <a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a> <a name="iv.XVII.23-Page_360"></a>  one prince over them; and at certain times, from every direction wherever they were, and from whatever place they could, they all came to the temple of God which was there.  Yet not even then were they without foreign enemies and conquerors; yea, Christ found them tributaries of the Romans.</p>
