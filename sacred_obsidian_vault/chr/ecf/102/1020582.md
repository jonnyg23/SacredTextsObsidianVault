 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.9-p2"></a>The philosophers who wished us to have the gods for our friends rank the friendship of the holy angels in the fourth circle of society, advancing now from the three circles of society on earth to the universe, and embracing heaven itself.  And in this friendship we have indeed no fear that the angels will grieve us by their death or deterioration.  But as we cannot mingle with them as familiarly as with men (which itself is one of the grievances of this life), and as Satan, as we read, <a name="fr_1276"></a><a href="#fn_1276"><font size="1">1277</font></a>
  sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light, to tempt those whom it is necessary to discipline, or just to deceive, there is great need of Gods mercy to preserve us from making friends of demons in disguise, while we fancy we have good angels for our friends; for the astuteness and deceitfulness of these wicked spirits is equalled by their hurtfulness.  And is this not a great misery of human life, that we are involved in such ignorance as, but for Gods mercy, makes us a prey to these demons?  And it is very certain that the philosophers of the godless city, who have maintained that the gods were their friends, had fallen a prey to the malignant demons who rule that city, and whose eternal punishment is to be shared by it.  For the nature of these beings is sufficiently evinced by the sacred or rather sacrilegious observances which form their worship, and by the filthy games in which their crimes are celebrated, and which they themselves originated and exacted from their worshippers as a fit propitiation.</p>
