 <p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxxv-p2"></a>39.  Of all, then, that has been said since  <a name="page_533"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 533</font></a> <a name="v.iv.xxxv-Page_533"></a>  we entered upon the discussion about things, this is the sum:  that we should clearly understand that the fulfillment and the end of the Law, and of all Holy Scripture, is the love of an object which is to be enjoyed, and the love of an object which can enjoy that other in fellowship with ourselves.  For there is no need of a command that each man should love himself.  The whole temporal dispensation for our salvation, therefore, was framed by the providence of God that we might know this truth and be able to act upon it; and we ought to use that dispensation, not with such love and delight as if it were a good to rest in, but with a transient feeling rather, such as we have towards the road, or carriages, or other things that are merely means.  Perhaps some other comparison can be found that will more suitably express the idea that we are to love the things by which we are borne only for the sake of that towards which we are borne.</p>
