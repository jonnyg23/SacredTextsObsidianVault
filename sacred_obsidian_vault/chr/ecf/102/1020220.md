 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.VIII.1-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VIII.1-p1.1"></a>Chapter 1.—That the Question of Natural Theology is to Be Discussed with Those Philosophers Who Sought a More Excellent Wisdom.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VIII.1-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.VIII.1-p2.1"></a>We</span> shall require to apply our mind with far greater intensity to the present question than was requisite in the solution and unfolding of the questions handled in the preceding books; for it is not with ordinary men, but with philosophers that we must confer concerning the theology which they call natural.  For it is not like the fabulous, that is, the theatrical; nor the civil, that is, the urban theology:  the one of which displays the crimes of the gods, whilst the other manifests their criminal desires, which demonstrate them to be rather malign demons than gods.  It is, we say, with philosophers we have to confer with respect to this theology,—men whose very name, if rendered into Latin, signifies those who profess the love of wisdom.  Now, if wisdom is God, who made all things, as is attested by the divine authority and truth, <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">296</font></a>
  then the philosopher is a lover of God.  But since the thing itself, which is called by this name, exists not in all who glory in the name,—for it does not follow, of course, that all who are called philosophers are lovers of true wisdom,—we must needs select from the number of those with whose opinions we have been able to acquaint ourselves by reading, some with whom we may not unworthily engage in the treatment of this question.  For I have not in this work undertaken to refute all the vain opinions of the philosophers, but only such as pertain to theology, which Greek word we understand to mean an account or explanation of the divine nature.  Nor, again, have I undertaken to refute all the vain theological opinions of all the philosophers, but only of such of them as, agreeing in the belief that there is a divine nature, and that this divine nature is concerned about human affairs, do nevertheless deny that the worship of the one unchangeable God is sufficient for the obtaining of a blessed life after death, as well as at the present time; and hold that, in order to obtain that life, many gods, created, indeed, and appointed to their several spheres by that one God, are to be worshipped.  These approach nearer to the truth than even Varro; for, whilst he saw no difficulty in extending natural theology in its entirety even to the world and the soul of the world, these acknowledge God as existing above all that is of the nature of soul, and as the Creator not only of this visible world, which is often called heaven and earth, but also of every soul whatsoever, and as Him who gives blessedness to the rational soul,—of which kind is the human soul,—by participation in His own unchangeable and incorporeal light.  There is no one, who has even a slender knowledge of these things, who does not know of the Platonic  <a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a> <a name="iv.VIII.1-Page_145"></a>  philosophers, who derive their name from their master Plato.  Concerning this Plato, then, I will briefly state such things as I deem necessary to the present question, mentioning beforehand those who preceded him in time in the same department of literature.</p>
