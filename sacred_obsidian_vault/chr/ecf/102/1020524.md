 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.6-p2"></a>Apis, then, who died in Egypt, was not the king of Egypt, but of Argos.  He was succeeded by his son Argus, from whose name the land was called Argos and the people Argives, for under the earlier kings neither the place nor the nation as yet had this name.  While he then reigned over Argos, and Eratus over Sicyon, and Balæus still remained king of Assyria, Jacob died in Egypt a hundred and forty-seven years old, after he had, when dying, blessed his sons and his grandsons by Joseph, and prophesied most plainly of Christ, saying in the blessing of Judah, “A prince shall not fail out of Judah, nor a leader from his thighs, until those things come which are laid up for him; and He is the expectation of the nations.” <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1135"><font size="1">1136</font></a>
   In the reign of Argus, Greece began to use fruits, and to have crops of corn in cultivated fields, the seed having been brought from other countries.  Argus also began to be accounted a god after his death, and was honored with a temple and sacrifices.  This honor was conferred in his reign, before being given to him, on a private individual for being the first to yoke oxen in the plough.  This was one Homogyrus, who was struck by lightning.</p>
