 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.VI.9-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VI.9-p1.1"></a>Chapter 9.—Concerning the Special Offices of the Gods.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.9-p2"></a>And as to those very offices of the gods, so meanly and so minutely portioned out, so that they say that they ought to be supplicated, each one according to his special function,—about which we have spoken much already, though not all that is to be said concerning it,—are they not more consistent with mimic buffoonery than divine majesty?  If any one should use two nurses for his infant, one of whom should give nothing but food, the other nothing but drink, as these make use of two goddesses for this purpose, Educa and Potina, he should certainly seem to be foolish, and to do in his house a thing worthy of a mimic.  They would have Liber to have been named from “liberation,” because through him males at the time of copulation are liberated by the emission of the seed.  They also say that Libera (the same in their opinion as Venus) exercises the same function in the case of women, because they say that they also emit seed; and they also say that on this account the same part of the male and of the female is placed in the temple, that of the male to Liber, and that of the female to Libera.  To these things they add the women assigned to Liber, and the wine for exciting lust.  Thus the Bacchanalia are celebrated with the utmost insanity, with respect to which Varro himself confesses that such things would not be done by the Bacchanals except their minds were highly excited.  These things, however, afterwards displeased a saner senate, and it ordered them to be discontinued.  Here, at length, they perhaps perceived how much power unclean spirits, when held to be gods, exercise over the minds of men.  These things, certainly, were not to be done in the theatres; for there they play, not rave, although to have gods who are delighted with such plays is very like raving.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.9-p3"></a>But what kind of distinction is this which he makes between the religious and the superstitious man, saying that the gods are feared <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">243</font></a>
  by the superstitious man, but are reverenced <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">244</font></a>
  as parents by the religious man, not feared as enemies; and that they are all so good that they will more readily spare those who are impious than hurt one who is innocent?  And yet he tells us that three gods are assigned as guardians to a woman after she has been delivered, lest the god Silvanus come in and molest her; and that in order to signify the presence of these protectors, three men go round the house during the night, and first strike the threshold with a hatchet, next with a pestle, and the third time sweep it with a brush, in order that these symbols of agriculture having been exhibited, the god Silvanus might be hindered from entering, because neither are trees cut down or pruned without a hatchet, neither is grain ground without a pestle, nor corn heaped up without a besom.  Now from these three things three gods have been named:  Intercidona, from the cut <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">245</font></a>
  made by the hatchet; Pilumnus, from the pestle; Diverra, from the besom;—by which guardian gods the woman who has been de  <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> <a name="iv.VI.9-Page_118"></a>  livered is preserved against the power of the god Silvanus.  Thus the guardianship of kindly-disposed gods would not avail against the malice of a mischievous god, unless they were three to one, and fought against him, as it were, with the opposing emblems of cultivation, who, being an inhabitant of the woods, is rough, horrible, and uncultivated.  Is this the innocence of the gods?  Is this their concord?  Are these the health-giving deities of the cities, more ridiculous than the things which are laughed at in the theatres?</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.9-p7"></a>When a male and a female are united, the god Jugatinus presides.  Well, let this be borne with.  But the married woman must be brought home:  the god Domiducus also is invoked.  That she may be in the house, the god Domitius is introduced.  That she may remain with her husband, the goddess Manturnæ is used.  What more is required?  Let human modesty be spared.  Let the lust of flesh and blood go on with the rest, the secret of shame being respected.  Why is the bed-chamber filled with a crowd of deities, when even the groomsmen <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">246</font></a>
  have departed?  And, moreover, it is so filled, not that in consideration of their presence more regard may be paid to chastity, but that by their help the woman, naturally of the weaker sex, and trembling with the novelty of her situation, may the more readily yield her virginity.  For there are the goddess Virginiensis, and the god-father Subigus, and the goddess-mother Prema, and the goddess Pertunda, and Venus, and Priapus. <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">247</font></a>
   What is this?  If it was absolutely necessary that a man, laboring at this work, should be helped by the gods, might not some one god or goddess have been sufficient?  Was Venus not sufficient alone, who is even said to be named from this, that without her power a woman does not cease to be a virgin?  If there is any shame in men, which is not in the deities, is it not the case that, when the married couple believe that so many gods of either sex are present, and busy at this work, they are so much affected with shame, that the man is less moved, and the woman more reluctant?  And certainly, if the goddess Virginiensis is present to loose the virgins zone, if the god Subigus is present that the virgin may be got under the man, if the goddess Prema is present that, having been got under him, she may be kept down, and may not move herself, what has the goddess Pertunda to do there?  Let her blush; let her go forth.  Let the husband himself do something.  It is disgraceful that any one but himself should do that from which she gets her name.  But perhaps she is tolerated because she is said to be a goddess, and not a god.  For if she were believed to be a male, and were called Pertundus, the husband would demand more help against him for the chastity of his wife than the newly-delivered woman against Silvanus.  But why am I saying this, when Priapus, too, is there, a male to excess, upon whose immense and most unsightly member the newly-married bride is commanded to sit, according to the most honorable and most religious custom of matrons?</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.9-p10"></a>Let them go on, and let them attempt with all the subtlety they can to distinguish the civil theology from the fabulous, the cities from the theatres, the temples from the stages, the sacred things of the priests from the songs of the poets, as honorable things from base things, truthful things from fallacious, grave from light, serious from ludicrous, desirable things from things to be rejected, we understand what they do.  They are aware that that theatrical and fabulous theology hangs by the civil, and is reflected back upon it from the songs of the poets as from a mirror; and thus, that theology having been exposed to view which they do not dare to condemn, they more freely assail and censure that picture of it, in order that those who perceive what they mean may detest this very face itself of which that is the picture,—which, however, the gods themselves, as though seeing themselves in the same mirror, love so much, that it is better seen in both of them who and what they are.  Whence, also, they have compelled their worshippers, with terrible commands, to dedicate to them the uncleanness of the fabulous theology, to put them among their solemnities, and reckon them among divine things; and thus they have both shown themselves more manifestly to be most impure spirits, and have made that rejected and reprobated theatrical theology a member and a part of this, as it were, chosen and approved theology of the city, so that, though the whole is disgraceful and false, and contains in it fictitious gods, one part of it is in the literature of the priests, the other in the songs of the poets.  Whether it may have other parts is another question.  At present, I think, I have sufficiently shown, on account of the division of Varro, that the theology of the city and that of the theatre belong to one civil theology.  Wherefore, because they are both equally disgraceful, absurd, shameful, false, far be it from religious men to hope for eternal life from either the one or the other.</p>  <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a> <a name="iv.VI.9-Page_119"></a>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.9-p11"></a>In fine, even Varro himself, in his account and enumeration of the gods, starts from the moment of a mans conception.  He commences the series of those gods who take charge of man with Janus, carries it on to the death of the man decrepit with age, and terminates it with the goddess Nænia, who is sung at the funerals of the aged.  After that, he begins to give an account of the other gods, whose province is not man himself, but mans belongings, as food, clothing, and all that is necessary for this life; and, in the case of all these, he explains what is the special office of each, and for what each ought to be supplicated.  But with all this scrupulous and comprehensive diligence, he has neither proved the existence, nor so much as mentioned the name, of any god from whom eternal life is to be sought,—the one object for which we are Christians.  Who, then, is so stupid as not to perceive that this man, by setting forth and opening up so diligently the civil theology, and by exhibiting its likeness to that fabulous, shameful, and disgraceful theology, and also by teaching that that fabulous sort is also a part of this other, was laboring to obtain a place in the minds of men for none but that natural theology, which he says pertains to philosophers, with such subtlety that he censures the fabulous, and, not daring openly to censure the civil, shows its censurable character by simply exhibiting it; and thus, both being reprobated by the judgment of men of right understanding, the natural alone remains to be chosen?  But concerning this in its own place, by the help of the true God, we have to discuss more diligently.</p>
