 <p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xi-p2"></a>11.  But of this we should have been wholly incapable, had not Wisdom condescended to adapt Himself to our weakness, and to show us a pattern of holy life in the form of our own humanity.  Yet, since we when we come to Him do wisely, He when He came to us was considered by proud men to have done very foolishly.  And since we when we come to Him become strong, He when He came to us was looked upon as weak.  But “the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.” <a name="fr_1723"></a><a href="#fn_1723"><font size="1">1724</font></a>
   And thus, though Wisdom was Himself our home, He made Himself also the way by which we should reach our home.</p>
