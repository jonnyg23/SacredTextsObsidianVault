 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.VII.32-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VII.32-p1.1"></a>Chapter 32.—That at No Time in the Past Was the Mystery of Christs Redemption Awanting, But Was at All Times Declared, Though in Various Forms.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VII.32-p2"></a>This mystery of eternal life, even from the beginning of the human race, was, by certain signs and sacraments suitable to the times, announced through angels to those to whom it was meet.  Then the Hebrew people was congregated into one republic, as it were, to  <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a> <a name="iv.VII.32-Page_141"></a>  perform this mystery; and in that republic was foretold, sometimes through men who understood what they spake, and sometimes through men who understood not, all that had transpired since the advent of Christ until now, and all that will transpire.  This same nation, too, was afterwards dispersed through the nations, in order to testify to the scriptures in which eternal salvation in Christ had been declared.  For not only the prophecies which are contained in words, nor only the precepts for the right conduct of life, which teach morals and piety, and are contained in the sacred writings,—not only these, but also the rites, priesthood, tabernacle or temple, altars, sacrifices, ceremonies, and whatever else belongs to that service which is due to God, and which in Greek is properly called  <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.VII.32-p2.1"></a>λατρεία</span>,—all these signified and fore-announced those things which we who believe in Jesus Christ unto eternal life believe to have been fulfilled, or behold in process of fulfillment, or confidently believe shall yet be fulfilled.</p>
