 </p><p class="c34"><a name="v.vi.xi-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="v.vi.xi-p1.1"></a>Chapter 11.—Rule for Interpreting Phrases Which Seem to Ascribe Severity to God and the Saints.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="v.vi.xi-p2"></a>17.  Every severity, therefore, and apparent cruelty, either in word or deed, that is ascribed in Holy Scripture to God or His saints, avails to the pulling down of the dominion of lust.  And if its meaning be clear, we are not to give it some secondary reference, as if it were spoken figuratively.  Take, for example, that saying of the apostle:  “But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds:  to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.” <a name="fr_1860"></a><a href="#fn_1860"><font size="1">1861</font></a>
   But this is addressed to those who, being unwilling to subdue their lust, are themselves involved in the destruction of their lust.  When, however, the dominion of lust is overturned in a man over whom it had held sway, this plain expression is used:  “They that are Christs have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.” <a name="fr_1861"></a><a href="#fn_1861"><font size="1">1862</font></a>
   Only that, even in these instances, some words are used figuratively, as for example, “the wrath of God” and “crucified.”  But these are not so numerous, nor placed in such a way as to obscure the sense, and make it allegorical or enigmatical, which is the kind of expression properly called <i>figurative</i>.  But in the saying addressed to Jeremiah, “See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down,” <a name="fr_1862"></a><a href="#fn_1862"><font size="1">1863</font></a>
  there is no doubt the whole of the language is figurative, and to be referred to the end I have spoken of.</p>
