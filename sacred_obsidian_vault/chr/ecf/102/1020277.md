 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.X.6-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.X.6-p1.1"></a>Chapter 6.—Of the True and Perfect Sacrifice.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.6-p2"></a>Thus a true sacrifice is every work which is done that we may be united to God in holy fellowship, and which has a reference to that supreme good and end in which alone we can be truly blessed. <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">390</font></a>
   And therefore even the mercy  <a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 184</font></a> <a name="iv.X.6-Page_184"></a>  we show to men, if it is not shown for Gods sake, is not a sacrifice.  For, though made or offered by man, sacrifice is a divine thing, as those who called it <i>sacrifice</i> <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">391</font></a>
  meant to indicate.  Thus man himself, consecrated in the name of God, and vowed to God, is a sacrifice in so far as he dies to the world that he may live to God.  For this is a part of that mercy which each man shows to himself; as it is written, “Have mercy on thy soul by pleasing God.” <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">392</font></a>
   Our body, too, as a sacrifice when we chasten it by temperance, if we do so as we ought, for Gods sake, that we may not yield our members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but instruments of righteousness unto God. <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">393</font></a>
   Exhorting to this sacrifice, the apostle says, “I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.” <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">394</font></a>
   If, then, the body, which, being inferior, the soul uses as a servant or instrument, is a sacrifice when it is used rightly, and with reference to God, how much more does the soul itself become a sacrifice when it offers itself to God, in order that, being inflamed by the fire of His love, it may receive of His beauty and become pleasing to Him, losing the shape of earthly desire, and being remoulded in the image of permanent loveliness?  And this, indeed, the apostle subjoins, saying, “And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed in the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.” <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">395</font></a>
   Since, therefore, true sacrifices are works of mercy to ourselves or others, done with a reference to God, and since works of mercy have no other object than the relief of distress or the conferring of happiness, and since there is no happiness apart from that good of which it is said, “It is good for me to be very near to God,” <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">396</font></a>
  it follows that the whole redeemed city, that is to say, the congregation or community of the saints, is offered to God as our sacrifice through the great High Priest, who offered Himself to God in His passion for us, that we might be members of this glorious head, according to the form of a servant.  For it was this form He offered, in this He was offered, because it is according to it He is Mediator, in this He is our Priest, in this the Sacrifice.  Accordingly, when the apostle had exhorted us to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, our reasonable service, and not to be conformed to the world, but to be transformed in the renewing of our mind, that we might prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God, that is to say, the true sacrifice of ourselves, he says, “For I say, through the grace of God which is given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.  For, as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another, having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us.” <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">397</font></a>
   This is the sacrifice of Christians:  we, being many, are one body in Christ.  And this also is the sacrifice which the Church continually celebrates in the sacrament of the altar, known to the faithful, in which she teaches that she herself is offered in the offering she makes to God.</p>
