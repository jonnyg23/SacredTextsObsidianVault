 </p><p class="c32"><a name="iv.ii.i-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></a>Preface, Explaining His Design in Undertaking This Work.</span></p>  
 <p class="c26"><a name="iv.ii.i-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.ii.i-p2.1"></a>The</span>  glorious city of God <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">28</font></a>
  is my theme in this work, which you, my dearest son Marcellinus, <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">29</font></a>
  suggested, and which is due to you by my promise.  I have undertaken its defence against those who prefer their own gods to the Founder of this city,—a city surpassingly glorious, whether we view it as it still lives by faith in this fleeting course of time, and sojourns as a stranger in the midst of the ungodly, or as it shall dwell in the fixed stability of its eternal seat, which it now with patience waits for, expecting until “righteousness shall return unto judgment,” <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>
  and it obtain, by virtue of its excellence, final victory and perfect peace.  A great work this, and an arduous; but God is my helper.  For I am aware what ability is requisite to persuade the proud how great is the virtue of humility, which raises us, not by a quite human arrogance, but by a divine grace, above all earthly dignities that totter on this shifting scene.  For the King and Founder of this city of which we speak, has in Scripture uttered to His people a dictum of the divine law in these words:  “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.” <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
   But this, which is Gods prerogative, the inflated ambition of a proud spirit also affects, and dearly loves that this be numbered among its attributes, to</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="iv.ii.i-p7"></a>“Show pity to the humbled soul,</p>  
 <p class="c33"><a name="iv.ii.i-p8"></a>And crush the sons of pride.” <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">32</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p10"></a>And therefore, as the plan of this work we have undertaken requires, and as occasion offers, we must speak also of the earthly city, which, though it be mistress of the nations, is itself ruled by its lust of rule.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.ii.i-p3"></a> [Augustin uses the term <i>civitas Dei</i> (<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.ii.i-p3.1"></a>πόλις θεοῦ</span>)  of the church universal as a commonwealth and community founded and governed by God.  It is applied in the Bible to Jerusalem or the church of the Old Covenant (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Ps. 40:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004">4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001">Ps. 48:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008">8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003">Ps. 87:3</a><a name="iv.ii.i-p3.2"></a>), and to the heavenly Jerusalem or the church perfect (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010">Heb. 11:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016">16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022">Heb. 12:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev. 3:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002">Rev. 21:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014">Rev. 22:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019">19</a><a name="iv.ii.i-p3.3"></a>).  Augustin comprehends under the term the whole Kingdom of God under the Jewish and Christian dispensation both in its militant and triumphant state, and contrasts it with the perishing kingdoms of this <i>world</i>.  His work treats of both, but he calls it, <i>a meliore, The City of God.</i>—P.S.]</p>
