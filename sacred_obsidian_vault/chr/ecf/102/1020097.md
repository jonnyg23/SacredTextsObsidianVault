 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.III.24-p2"></a>The civil wars originated in the seditions which the Gracchi excited regarding the agrarian laws; for they were minded to divide among the people the lands which were wrongfully possessed by the nobility.  But to reform an abuse of so long standing was an enterprise full of peril, or rather, as the event proved, of destruction.  For what disasters accompanied the death of the older Gracchus! what slaughter ensued when, shortly after, the younger brother met the same fate!  For noble and ignoble were indiscriminately massacred; and this not by legal authority and procedure, but by mobs and armed rioters.  After the death of the younger Gracchus, the consul Lucius Opimius, who had given battle to him within the city, and had defeated and put to the sword both himself and his confederates, and had massacred many of the citizens, instituted a judicial examination of others, and is reported to have put to death as many as 3000 men.  From this it may be gathered how many fell in the riotous encounters, when the result even of a judicial investigation was so bloody.  The assassin of Gracchus himself sold his head to the consul for its weight in gold, such being the previous agreement.  In this massacre, too, Marcus Fulvius, a man of consular rank, with all his children, was put to death.</p>
