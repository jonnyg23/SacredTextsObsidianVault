 <p class="c21"><a name="v.IV_1.30-p2"></a>63.  But whether a man is going to address the people or to dictate what others will deliver or read to the people, he ought to pray God to put into his mouth a suitable discourse.  For if Queen Esther prayed, when she was about to speak to the king touching the temporal welfare of her race, that God would put fit words into her mouth, <a name="fr_2022"></a><a href="#fn_2022"><font size="1">2023</font></a>
  how much more ought he to pray for the same blessing who labors in word and doctrine for the eternal welfare of men?  Those, again, who are to deliver what others compose for them ought, before they receive their discourse, to pray for those who are preparing it; and when they have received it, they ought to pray both that they themselves may deliver it well, and that those to whom they address it may give ear; and when the discourse has a happy issue, they ought to render thanks to Him from whom they know such blessings come, so that all the praise may be His “in whose hand are both we and our words.” <a name="fr_2023"></a><a href="#fn_2023"><font size="1">2024</font></a>
