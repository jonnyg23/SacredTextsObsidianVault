 <p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxxiv-p2"></a>38.  And mark that even when He who is Himself the Truth and the Word, by whom all things were made, had been made flesh that He might dwell among us, the apostle yet says:  “Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more.” <a name="fr_1748"></a><a href="#fn_1748"><font size="1">1749</font></a>
   For Christ, desiring not only to give the possession to those who had completed the journey, but also to be Himself the way to those who were just setting out, determined to take a fleshly body.  Whence also that expression, “The Lord created <a name="fr_1749"></a><a href="#fn_1749"><font size="1">1750</font></a>
  me in the beginning of His way,” <a name="fr_1750"></a><a href="#fn_1750"><font size="1">1751</font></a>
  that is, that those who wished to come might begin their journey in Him.  The apostle, therefore, although still on the way, and following after God who called him to the reward of His heavenly calling, yet forgetting those things which were behind, and pressing on towards those things which were before, <a name="fr_1751"></a><a href="#fn_1751"><font size="1">1752</font></a>
  had already passed over the beginning of the way, and had now no further need of it; yet by this way all must commence their journey who desire to attain to the truth, and to rest in eternal life.  For He says:  “I am the way, and the truth, and the life;” <a name="fr_1752"></a><a href="#fn_1752"><font size="1">1753</font></a>
  that is, by me men come, to me they come, in me they rest.  For when we come to Him, we come to the Father also, because through an equal an equal is known; and the Holy Spirit binds, and as it were seals us, so that we are able to rest permanently in the supreme and unchangeable Good.  And hence we may learn how essential it is that nothing should detain us on the way, when not even our Lord Himself, so far as He has condescended to be our way, is willing to detain us, but wishes us rather to press on; and, instead of weakly clinging to temporal things, even though these have been put on and worn by Him for our salvation, to pass over them quickly, and to struggle to attain unto Himself, who has freed our nature from the bondage of temporal things, and has set it down at the right hand of His Father.</p>
