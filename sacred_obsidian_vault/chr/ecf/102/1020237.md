 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.VIII.18-p2"></a>In vain, therefore, have Apuleius, and they who think with him, conferred on the demons the honor of placing them in the air, between the ethereal heavens and the earth, that they may carry to the gods the prayers of men, to men the answers of the gods:  for Plato held, they say, that no god has intercourse with man.  They who believe these things have thought it unbecoming that men should have intercourse with the gods, and the gods with men, but a befitting thing that the demons should have intercourse with both gods and men, presenting to the gods the petitions of men, and conveying to men what the gods have granted; so that a chaste man, and one who is a stranger to the crimes of the magic arts, must use as patrons, through whom the gods may be induced to hear him, demons who love these crimes, although the very fact of his not loving them ought to have recommended him to them as one who deserved to be listened to with greater readiness and willingness on their part.  They love the abominations of the stage, which chastity does not love.  They love, in the sorceries of the magicians, “<i>a thousand arts of inflicting harm</i>,” <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">314</font></a>
  which innocence does not love.  Yet both chastity and innocence, if they wish to obtain anything from the gods, will not be able to do so by their own merits, except their enemies act as mediators on their behalf.  Apuleius need not attempt to justify the fictions of the poets, and the mockeries of the stage.  If human modesty can act so faithlessly towards itself as not only to love shameful things, but even to think that they are pleasing to the divinity, we can cite on the other side their own highest authority and teacher, Plato.</p>
