 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.8-p2"></a>In our present wretched condition we frequently mistake a friend for an enemy, and an enemy for a friend.  And if we escape this pitiable blindness, is not the unfeigned confidence and mutual love of true and good friends our one solace in human society, filled as it is with misunderstandings and calamities?  And yet the more friends we have, and the more widely they are scattered, the more numerous are our fears that some portion of the vast masses of the disasters of life may light upon them.  For we are not only anxious lest they suffer from famine, war, disease, captivity, or the inconceivable horrors of slavery, but we are also affected with the much more painful dread that their friendship may be changed into perfidy, malice, and injustice.  And when these contingencies actually occur,—as they do the more frequently the more friends we have, and the more widely they are scattered,—and when they come to our knowledge, who but the man who has experienced it can tell with what pangs the heart is torn?  We would, in fact, prefer to hear that they  <a name="page_406"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 406</font></a> <a name="iv.XIX.8-Page_406"></a>  were dead, although we could not without anguish hear of even this.  For if their life has solaced us with the charms of friendship, can it be that their death should affect us with no sadness?  He who will have none of this sadness must, if possible, have no friendly intercourse.  Let him interdict or extinguish friendly affection; let him burst with ruthless insensibility the bonds of every human relationship; or let him contrive so to use them that no sweetness shall distil into his spirit.  But if this is utterly impossible, how shall we contrive to feel no bitterness in the death of those whose life has been sweet to us?  Hence arises that grief which affects the tender heart like a wound or a bruise, and which is healed by the application of kindly consolation.  For though the cure is affected all the more easily and rapidly the better condition the soul is in, we must not on this account suppose that there is nothing at all to heal.  Although, then, our present life is afflicted, sometimes in a milder, sometimes in a more painful degree, by the death of those very dear to us, and especially of useful public men, yet we would prefer to hear that such men were dead rather than to hear or perceive that they had fallen from the faith, or from virtue,—in other words, that they were spiritually dead.  Of this vast material for misery the earth is full, and therefore it is written, “Is not human life upon earth a trial?” <a name="fr_1273"></a><a href="#fn_1273"><font size="1">1274</font></a>
   And with the same reference the Lord says, “Woe to the world because of offenses!” <a name="fr_1274"></a><a href="#fn_1274"><font size="1">1275</font></a>
  and again, “Because iniquity abounded, the love of many shall wax cold.” <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1275"><font size="1">1276</font></a>
   And hence we enjoy some gratification when our good friends die; for though their death leaves us in sorrow, we have the consolatory assurance that they are beyond the ills by which in this life even the best of men are broken down or corrupted, or are in danger of both results.</p>
