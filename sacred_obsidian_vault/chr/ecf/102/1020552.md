 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.34-p2"></a>Daniel and Ezekiel, other two of the greater prophets, also first prophesied in the very captivity of Babylon.  Daniel even defined the time when Christ was to come and suffer by the exact date.  It would take too long to show this by computation, and it has been done often by others before us.  But of His power and glory he has thus spoken:  “I saw in a night vision, and, behold, one like the Son of man was coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient of days, and He was brought into His presence.  And to Him there was given dominion, and honor, and a kingdom:  and all people, tribes, and tongues shall serve Him.  His power is an everlasting power, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.” <a name="fr_1197"></a><a href="#fn_1197"><font size="1">1198</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.34-p4"></a>Ezekiel also, speaking prophetically in the person of God the Father, thus foretells Christ, speaking of Him in the prophetic manner as David, because He assumed flesh of the seed of David, and on account of that form of a servant in which He was made man, He who is the Son of God is also called the servant of God.  He says, “And I will set up over my sheep one Shepherd, who will feed them, even my servant David; and He shall feed them, and He shall be their shepherd.  And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a prince in the midst of them.  I the Lord have spoken.” <a name="fr_1198"></a><a href="#fn_1198"><font size="1">1199</font></a>
   And in another place he says, “And one King shall be over them all:  and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms:  neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, and their abominations, and all their iniquities.  And I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.  And my servant David shall be king over them, and there shall be one Shepherd for them all.” <a name="fr_1199"></a><a href="#fn_1199"><font size="1">1200</font></a>
