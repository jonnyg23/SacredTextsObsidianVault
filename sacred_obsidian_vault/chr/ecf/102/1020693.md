 <p class="c21"><a name="v.i-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="v.i-p2.1"></a>The</span> four books of St. Augustin <i>On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana, iv libri)</i> are a compend of exegetical theology to guide the reader in the understanding and interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, according to the analogy of faith.  The first three books were written <span class="c20"><a name="v.i-p2.2"></a>a.d.</span> 397; the fourth was added 426.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="v.i-p3"></a>He speaks of it in his <i> Retractations</i>, Bk. <i>ii</i>., chap. 4, as follows:</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="v.i-p4"></a>“Finding that the books on Christian Doctrine were not finished, I thought it better to complete them before passing on to the revision of others.  Accordingly, I completed the third book, which had been written as far as the place where a quotation is made from the Gospel about the woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened. <a name="fr_1701"></a><a href="#fn_1701"><font size="1">1702</font></a>
   I added also the last book, and finished the whole work in four books [in the year 426]:  the first three affording aids to the interpretation of Scripture, the last giving directions as to the mode of making known our interpretation.  In the second book, <a name="fr_1702"></a><a href="#fn_1702"><font size="1">1703</font></a>
  I made a mistake as to the authorship of the book commonly called the Wisdom of Solomon.  For I have since learnt that it is not a well-established fact, as I said it was, that Jesus the son of Sirach, who wrote the book of Ecclesiasticus, wrote this book also:  on the contrary, I have ascertained that it is altogether more probable that he was not the author of this book.  Again, when I said, The authority of the Old Testament is contained within the limits of these forty-four books, <a name="fr_1703"></a><a href="#fn_1703"><font size="1">1704</font></a>
  I used the phrase Old Testament in accordance with ecclesiastical usage.  But the apostle seems to restrict the application of the name Old Testament to the law which was given on Mount Sinai. <a name="fr_1704"></a><a href="#fn_1704"><font size="1">1705</font></a>
   And in what I said as to St. Ambrose having, by his knowledge of chronology, solved a great difficulty, when he showed that Plato and Jeremiah were contemporaries, <a name="fr_1705"></a><a href="#fn_1705"><font size="1">1706</font></a>
  my memory betrayed me.  What that great bishop really did say upon this subject may be seen in the book which he wrote, On Sacraments or Philosophy.” <a name="fr_1706"></a><a href="#fn_1706"><font size="1">1707</font></a>
