 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.26-p2"></a>Wherefore, as the life of the flesh is the soul, so the blessed life of man is God, of whom the sacred writings of the Hebrews say, “Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.” <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">1303</font></a>
   Miserable, therefore, is the people which is alienated from God.  Yet even this people has a peace of its own which is not to be lightly esteemed, though, indeed, it shall not in the end enjoy it, because it makes no good use of it before the end.  But it is our interest that it enjoy this peace meanwhile in this life; for as long as the two cities are commingled, we also enjoy the peace of Babylon.  For from Babylon the people of God is so freed that it meanwhile sojourns in its company.  And therefore the apostle also admonished the Church to pray for kings and those in authority, assigning as the reason, “that we may live a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and love.” <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">1304</font></a>
   And the prophet Jeremiah, when predicting the captivity that was to befall the ancient people of God, and giving them the divine command to go obediently to Babylonia, and thus serve their God, counselled them also to pray for Babylonia, saying, “In the peace thereof shall ye have peace,” <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">1305</font></a>
 —the temporal peace which the good and the wicked together enjoy.</p>
