 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.iii-p2"></a>2.  Let those rage against you who know not with what labor the truth is to be found and with what difficulty error is to be avoided.  Let those rage against you who know not how rare and hard it is to overcome the fancies of the flesh by the serenity of a pious disposition.  Let those rage against you who know not the difficulty of curing the eye of the inner man that he may gaze upon his Sun,—not that sun <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.iii-Page_130"></a>which you worship, and which shines with the brilliance of a heavenly body in the eyes of carnal men and of beasts,—but that of which it is written through the prophet, "The Sun of righteousness has arisen upon me;" <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">265</font></a>
  and of which it is said in the gospel, "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">266</font></a>
   Let those rage against you who know not with what sighs and groans the least particle of the knowledge of God is obtained.  And, last of all, let those rage against you who have never been led astray in the same way that they see that you are.</p>
