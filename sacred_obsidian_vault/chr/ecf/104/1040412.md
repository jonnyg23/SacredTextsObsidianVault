 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.ix.xiii-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.ix.xiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 13.—</span>24.  Venantius of Tinisa <a name="fr_1793"></a><a href="#fn_1793"><font size="1">1794</font></a>
  said:  "If a husband, going on a journey into foreign countries, had entrusted the guardianship of his wife to a friend, he would surely keep her that was entrusted to his care with the utmost diligence, that her chastity and holiness might not be defiled by any one.  Christ our Lord and God, when going to the Father, committed His bride to our care:  do we keep her uncorrupt and undefiled, or do we betray her purity and chastity to adulterers and corrupters?  For he who   makes the baptism of Christ common with heretics betrays the bride of Christ to adulterers." <a name="fr_1794"></a><a href="#fn_1794"><font size="1">1795</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.ix.xiii-p4"></a>25.  We answer:  What of those who, when they are baptized, turn themselves to the Lord with their lips and not with their heart? do not they possess an adulterous mind?  Are not they themselves lovers of the world, which they renounce in words and not in deeds; and they corrupt good manners through evil communications, saying, "Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die?" <a name="fr_1795"></a><a href="#fn_1795"><font size="1">1796</font></a>
   Did not the discourse of the apostle take heed even against such as these, when he says, "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds [also] should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ?" <a name="fr_1796"></a><a href="#fn_1796"><font size="1">1797</font></a>
   When, therefore, Cyprian held the baptism of Christ to be in common with such men, did he therefore betray the bride of Christ into the hands of adulterers, or did he not rather recognize the necklace of the Bridegroom even on an adulteress?</p>
