 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.cv-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.cv-p1.1"></a>Chapter 105.—</span>238.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.cv-p1.2"></a>Petilianus</span> said:  "But he thus praises the ointment of concord among brethren:  Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!  It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard; that went down to the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion:  for there   the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. <a name="fr_2292"></a><a href="#fn_2292"><font size="1">2293</font></a>
   Thus, he says, is unity anointed, even as the priests are anointed."</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.cv-p3"></a>239.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.cv-p3.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  What you say is true.  For that priesthood in the body of Christ had an anointing, and its salvation is secured by the bond of unity.  For indeed Christ Himself derives His name from chrism, that is, from anointing.  Him the Hebrews call the Messiah, which word is closely akin <a name="page_592"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 592</font></a> <a name="v.v.iv.cv-Page_592"></a>to the Phœnician language, as is the case with very many other Hebrew words, if not with almost all.    <a name="fr_2293"></a><a href="#fn_2293"><font size="1">2294</font></a>
   What then is meant by the head in that priesthood, what by the beard, what by the skirts of the garments?  So far as the Lord enables me to understand, the head is none other than the Saviour of the body, of whom the apostle says, "And He is the head of the body, the Church." <a name="fr_2294"></a><a href="#fn_2294"><font size="1">2295</font></a>
   By the beard is not unsuitably understood fortitude.  Therefore, on those who show themselves to be brave in His Church, and cling to the light of His countenance, to preach the truth without fear, there descends from Christ Himself, as from the head, a sacred ointment, that is to say, the sanctification of the Spirit.  By the skirts of the garments we are here given to understand that which is at the top of the garments, through which the head of Him who gives the   clothing enters.  By this are signified those who are perfected in faith within the Church.  For in the skirts is perfection.  And I presume you must remember what was said to a certain rich man:  "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me." <a name="fr_2295"></a><a href="#fn_2295"><font size="1">2296</font></a>
   He indeed went away sorrowful, slighting what was perfect, choosing what was imperfect.  But does it follow that there were wanting those who were so made perfect by such a surrender of earthly things, that the ointment of unity descended upon them, as from the head upon the skirts of the garments?  For, putting aside the apostles, and those who were immediately associated with those leaders and teachers of the Church, whom we understand to be represented with greater   dignity and more conspicuous fortitude in the beard, read in the Acts of the Apostles, and see those who "brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles feet.  Neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own:  but they had all things common:  and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.  And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul." <a name="fr_2296"></a><a href="#fn_2296"><font size="1">2297</font></a>
   I doubt not that you are aware that it is so written.  Recognize, therefore, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.  Recognize the beard of Aaron; recognize the skirts of the spiritual garments.  Search the Scriptures themselves, and see where those things began to be done; you will find that it was in Jerusalem.  From this skirt of the garment is woven together the whole fabric of unity throughout all nations.  By this the Head entered   into the garment, that Christ should be clothed with all the variety of the several nations of the earth, because in this skirt of the garment appeared the actual variety of tongues.  Why, therefore, is the Head itself, whence that ointment of unity descended, that is, the spiritual fragrance of brotherly love,—why, I say, is the Head itself exposed to your resistance, while it testifies and declares that "repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations,   beginning at Jerusalem"? <a name="fr_2297"></a><a href="#fn_2297"><font size="1">2298</font></a>
   And by this ointment you wish the sacrament of chrism to be understood, which is indeed holy as among the class of visible signs, like baptism itself, but yet can exist even among the worst of men, wasting their life in the works of the flesh, and never destined to possess the kingdom of heaven, and having therefore nothing to do either with the beard of Aaron, or with the skirts of his garments, or with any fabric of priestly clothing.  For where do you intend to place   what the apostle enumerates as "the manifest works of the flesh, which," he says, "are these:  fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, poisonings, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like:  of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" <a name="fr_2298"></a><a href="#fn_2298"><font size="1">2299</font></a>
   I put aside fornications, which are committed in secret; interpret uncleanness as you please, I am willing to put it aside as well.  Let us put on one side also poisons, since no one is openly a compounder or giver of poisons.  I put aside also heresies, since you will have it so.  I am in doubt whether I ought to put aside idolatry, since the apostle classes with it covetousness, which is openly rife among you.  However, setting aside all these, are there none among you   lascivious, none covetous, none open in their indulgence of enmities, none fond of strife, or fond of emulation, wrathful, given to seditions, envious, drunken, wasting their time in revellings?  Are none of such a character anointed among you?  Do none die well known among you to be given to such things, or openly indulging in them?  If you say there are none, I would have you consider whether you do <a name="page_593"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 593</font></a> <a name="v.v.iv.cv-Page_593"></a>not come under the description yourself, since you are manifestly telling   lies in the desire for strife.  But if you are yourself severed from men of this sort, not by bodily separation, but by dissimilarity of life, and if you behold with lamentation crowds like these around your altars, what shall we say, since they are anointed with holy oil, and yet, as the apostle assures us with the clearness of truth, shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Must we do such impious despite to the beard of Aaron and to the skirts of his garments, as to suppose that they are to be   placed there?  Far be that from us.  Separate therefore the visible holy sacrament, which can exist both in the good and in the bad,—in the former for their reward, in the latter for judgment; separate it from the invisible unction of charity, which is the peculiar property of the good.  Separate them, separate them, ay, and may God separate you from the party of Donatus, and call you back again into the Catholic Church, whence you were torn by them while yet a catechumen, to be bound by them   in the bond of a deadly distinction.  Now are ye not in the mountains of Zion, the dew of Hermon on the mountains of Zion, in whatever sense that be received by you; for you are not in the city upon a hill, which has this as its sure sign, that it cannot be hid.  It is known therefore unto all nations.  But the party of Donatus is unknown to the majority of nations, therefore is it not the true city.</p>
