 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxv-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></a>Chapter 35.—</span>81.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxv-p1.2"></a>Petilianus</span> said:  "Nor indeed will it be possible that the Holy Spirit should be implanted in the heart of any one by the laying on of the hands of the priest, unless the water of a pure conscience has gone before to give him birth."</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxv-p2"></a>82.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxv-p2.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  In these few words of yours two errors are involved; and one of them, indeed, has no great bearing on the question which is being discussed between us, but yet it helps to convict you of want of skill.  For the Holy Spirit came upon a hundred and twenty men, without the laying on of any persons hands, and again upon Cornelius the centurion and those who were with him, even before they were baptized.    <a name="fr_2083"></a><a href="#fn_2083"><font size="1">2084</font></a>
   But the second error in these words of yours entirely overthrows your whole case.  For you say that the water of a pure conscience must necessarily precede to give new birth, before the Holy Spirit can follow on it.  Accordingly, either all the water consecrated in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is water of a pure conscience, not for the merits of those by whom it is administered, or by whom it is received, but in virtue of the stainless   merits of Him who instituted this baptism; or else if only a pure conscience on the part both of the ministrant and the recipient can produce the water of a pure conscience, what do you make of those whom you find to have been baptized by men who bore a conscience stained with as yet undiscovered guilt, especially if there exist among the said baptized persons any one that should confess that he at the time when he was baptized had a bad conscience, in that he might possbily have desired to use   that opportunity for the accomplishment of some sinful act?  When, therefore, it shall be made clear to you that neither the man who administered baptism, nor the man who received it, had a pure conscience, will you give your judgment that he ought to be baptized afresh?  You will assuredly neither say nor do anything of the sort.  The purity therefore of baptism is entirely unconnected with the purity or impurity of the conscience either of the giver or the recipient.  Will you therefore dare   to say that the deceiver, or the robber, or the oppressor of the fatherless and widows, or the sunderer of marriages, or the betrayer, the seller, the divider of the patrimony of other men, <a name="fr_2084"></a><a href="#fn_2084"><font size="1">2085</font></a>
  was a man of pure conscience?  Or will you further dare to say that those were men of pure conscience, whom it is hard to imagine wanting in such times, men who made interest with the man I have described, that they might be baptized, not for the sake of Christ, nor for the sake of eternal life, but to conciliate earthly friendships, and to satisfy earthly desires?  Further, if you do not venture to say that these were men of pure conscience, then if you find any of their   number who have been baptized, give to them the water of a pure conscience, which they as yet have not received; and if you will not do this, then leave off casting in our teeth a matter which you do not understand, lest you should be forced to answer in reply to us about a matter which you know full well.</p>
