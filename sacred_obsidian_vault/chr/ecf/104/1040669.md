 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.vi.xii-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.vi.xii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 10.—</span>43.  But this, they say, is the very thing which disquiets us,—If we are unrighteous, wherefore do you seek our company?  To which question we answer, We seek the company of you who are unrighteous, that you may not remain unrighteous; we seek for you who are lost, that we may rejoice over you as soon as you are found, saying, This our brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.  <a name="fr_2549"></a><a href="#fn_2549"><font size="1">2550</font></a>
   Why, then, he says, do you not baptize me, that you might wash me from my sins?  I reply:  Because I do not do despite to the stamp of the monarch, when I correct the ill-doing of a deserter.  Why, he says, do I not even do penance in your body?  Nay truly, except you have done penance, you cannot be saved; for how shall you rejoice that you have been reformed, unless you first grieve that you had been astray?  What, then, he says, do we receive with you, when we come over to your side?  I answer, You do not indeed receive baptism, which was able to exist in you outside the framework of the body of Christ, although it could not profit you; but you receive the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace <a name="fr_2550"></a><a href="#fn_2550"><font size="1">2551</font></a>
  without which no one can see God; and you receive charity, which, as it is written, "shall cover the multitude of sins." <a name="fr_2551"></a><a href="#fn_2551"><font size="1">2552</font></a>
   And in regard to this great blessing, without which we have the apostles testimony that neither the tongues of men or of angels, nor the understanding of all mysteries, nor the gift of prophecy, nor faith so great as to be able to remove mountains, nor the bestowal of all ones goods to feed the poor, nor giving ones body to be burned, can profit anything; <a name="fr_2552"></a><a href="#fn_2552"><font size="1">2553</font></a>
  if, I say, you think this mighty blessing to be worthless or of trifling value, you are deservedly but miserably astray; and deservedly you must necessarily perish, unless you come over to Catholic unity.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xii-p6"></a>44.  If, then, they say, it is necessary that we should repent of having been outside, and hostile to the Church, if we would gain salvation, how comes it that after the repentance which you exact from us we still continue to be clergy, or it may be even bishops in your body?  This would not be the case, as indeed, in simple truth, we must confess it should not be the case, were it not that the evil is cured by the compensating power of peace itself.  But let them give themselves this lesson, and most especially let those feel sorrow in their hearts, who are lying in this deep death of severance from the Church, that they may recover their life even by this sort of wound inflicted on our Catholic mother Church.  For when the bough that has been cut off is grafted in, a new wound is made in the tree, to admit of its reception, that life may be given to the branch which was perishing for lack of the life that is furnished by the root.  But when the newly-received branch has become identified with the stock in which it is received, the result is both vigor and fruit; but if they do not become identified, the engrafted bough withers, but the life of <a name="page_649"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 649</font></a> <a name="v.vi.xii-Page_649"></a>the tree continues unimpaired.  For there is further a mode of grafting of such a kind, that without cutting away any branch that is within, the branch that is foreign to the tree is inserted, not indeed without a wound, but with the slightest possible wound inflicted on the tree.  In like manner, then, when they come to the root which exists in the Catholic Church, without being deprived of any position which belongs to them as clergy or bishops after ever so deep repentance of their error, there is a kind of wound inflicted as it were upon the bark of the mother tree, breaking in upon the strictness of her discipline; but since neither he that planteth is anything, neither he that watereth, <a name="fr_2553"></a><a href="#fn_2553"><font size="1">2554</font></a>
  so soon as by prayers poured forth to the mercy of God peace is secured through the union of the engrafted boughs with the parent stock, charity then covers the multitude of sins.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xii-p8"></a>45.  For although it was made an ordinance in the Church, that no one who had been called upon to do penance for any offense should be admired into holy orders, or return to or continue in the body of the clergy, <a name="fr_2554"></a><a href="#fn_2554"><font size="1">2555</font></a>
  this was done not to cause despair of any indulgence being granted, but merely to maintain a rigorous discipline; otherwise an argument will be raised against the keys that were given to the Church, of which we have the testimony of Scripture:  "Whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." <a name="fr_2555"></a><a href="#fn_2555"><font size="1">2556</font></a>
   But lest it should so happen that, after the detection of offenses, a heart swelling with the hope of ecclesiastical preferment might do penance in a spirit of pride, it was determined, with great severity, that after doing penance for any mortal sin, no one should be admitted to the number of the clergy, in order that, when all hope of temporal preferment was done away, the medicine of humility might be endowed with greater strength and truth.  For even the holy David did penance for deadly sin, and yet was not degraded from his office.  And we know that the blessed Peter, after shedding the bitterest of tears, repented that he had denied his Lord, and yet remained an apostle.  But we must not therefore be induced to think that the care of those in later times was in any way superfluous, who, when there was no risk of endangering salvation, added something to humiliation, in order that the salvation might be more thoroughly protected,—having, I suppose, experienced a feigned repentance on the part of some who were influenced by the desire of the power attaching to office.  For experience in many diseases necessarily brings in the invention of many remedies.  But in cases of this kind, when, owing to the serious ruptures of dissensions in the Church, it is no longer a question of danger to this or that particular individual, but whole nations are lying in ruin, it is right to yield a little from our severity, that true charity may give her aid in healing the more serious evils.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xii-p11"></a>46.  Let them therefore feel bitter grief for their detestable error of the past, as Peter did for his fear that led him into falsehood, and let them come to the true Church of Christ, that is, to the Catholic Church our mother; let them be in it clergy, let them be bishops unto its profit, as they have been hitherto in enmity against it.  We feel no jealousy towards them, nay, we embrace them; we wish, we advise, we even compel those to come in whom we find in the highways and hedges, although we fail as yet in persuading some of them that we are seeking not their property, but themselves.  The Apostle Peter, when he denied his Savior, and wept, and did not cease to be an apostle, had not as yet received the Holy Spirit that was promised; but much more have these men not received Him, when, being severed from the framework of the body, which is alone enlivened by the Holy Spirit, they have usurped the sacraments of the Church outside the Church and in hostility to the Church, and have fought against us in a kind of civil war, with our own arms and our own standards raised in opposition to us.  Let them come; let peace be concluded in the virtue of Jerusalem, which virtue is Christian charity,—to which holy city it is said, "Peace be in thy virtue, and plenteousness within thy palaces." <a name="fr_2556"></a><a href="#fn_2556"><font size="1">2557</font></a>
   Let them not exalt themselves against the solicitude of their mother, which she both has entertained and does entertain with the object of gathering within her bosom themselves, and all the mighty nations whom they are, or recently were, deceiving; at them not be puffed up with pride, that she receives them in such wise; let them not attribute to the evil of their own exaltation the good which she on her part does in order to make peace.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xii-p13"></a>47.  So it has been her wont to come to the aid of multitudes who were perishing through schisms and heresies.  This displeased Lucifer, <a name="fr_2557"></a><a href="#fn_2557"><font size="1">2558</font></a>
  when it was carried out in receiving and healing those who had perished beneath the poison of the Arian heresy; and, being displeased at it, he fell into the darkness of <a name="page_650"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 650</font></a> <a name="v.vi.xii-Page_650"></a>schism, losing the light of Christian charity.  In accordance with this principle the Church of Africa has recognized the Donatists from the very beginning, obeying herein the decree of the bishops who gave sentence in the Church at Rome between Cæcilianus and the party of Donatus; and having condemned one bishop named Donatus, <a name="fr_2558"></a><a href="#fn_2558"><font size="1">2559</font></a>
  who was proved to have been the author of the schism, they determined that the others should be received, after correction, with full recognition of their orders even if they had been ordained outside the Church,—not that they could have the Holy Spirit even outside the unity of the body of Christ, but, in the first place, for the sake of those whom it was possible they might deceive while they remained outside, and prevent from obtaining that gift; and, secondly, that their own weakness also being mercifully received within, might thus be rendered capable of cure, no obstinacy any longer standing in the way to close their eyes against the evidence of truth.  For what other intention could have given rise to their own conduct, when they received with full recognition of their orders the followers of Maximianus, whom they had condemned as guilty of sacrilegious schism, as their council <a name="fr_2559"></a><a href="#fn_2559"><font size="1">2560</font></a>
  shows, and to fill whose places they had already ordained other men, when they saw that the people did not depart from their company, that all might not be involved in ruin?  And on what other ground did they neither speak against nor question the validity of the baptism which had been administered outside by men whom they had condemned?  Why, then, do they wonder, why do they complain, and make it the subject of their calumnies, that we receive them in such wise to promote the true peace of Christ, while yet they do not remember what they themselves have done to promote the false peace of Donatus, which is opposed to Christ?  For if this act of theirs be borne in mind, and intelligently used in argument against them, they will have no answer whatsoever that they can make.</p>
