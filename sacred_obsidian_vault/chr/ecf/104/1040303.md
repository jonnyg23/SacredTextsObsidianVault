 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.vi.v-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.vi.v-p1.1"></a>Chapter 5.—</span>8.  "Further," Cyprian goes on to say, "in vain do some, who are overcome by reason, oppose to us custom, as though custom were superior to truth, or that were not to be followed in spiritual things which has been revealed by the Holy Spirit, as the better way." <a name="fr_1357"></a><a href="#fn_1357"><font size="1">1358</font></a>
   This is clearly true, since reason and truth are to be preferred to custom.  But when truth supports custom, nothing should be more strongly maintained.  Then he proceeds as follows:  "For one may pardon a man who merely errs, as the Apostle Paul says of himself, Who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly; <a name="fr_1358"></a><a href="#fn_1358"><font size="1">1359</font></a>
  but he who, after inspiration and revelation given, perseveres advisedly and knowingly in his former error, sins without hope of pardon on the ground of ignorance.  For he rests on a kind of presumption and obstinacy, when he is overcome by reason."  This is most true, that his sin is much more grievous who has sinned wittingly than his who has sinned through ignorance.  And so in the case of the holy Cyprian, who was not only learned, but also patient of instruction,   which he so fully himself understood to be a part of the praise of the bishop whom the apostle describes, <a name="fr_1359"></a><a href="#fn_1359"><font size="1">1360</font></a>
  that he said, "This also should be approved in a bishop, that he not only teach with knowledge, but also learn with patience." <a name="fr_1360"></a><a href="#fn_1360"><font size="1">1361</font></a>
   I do not doubt that if he had had the opportunity of discussing this question, which has been so long and so much disputed in the Church, with the pious and learned men to whom we owe it that subsequently that ancient custom was confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council, he would have shown, without hesitation, not only how learned he was in those things which he had grasped with all the security of truth, but also how ready he was to receive instruction in what he   had failed to perceive.  And yet, since it is so clear that it is much more grievous to sin wittingly than in ignorance, I should be glad if any one would tell me which is the worse,—the man who falls into heresy, not knowing how great a sin it is, or the man who refuses to abandon his covetousness, knowing its enormity?  I might even put the question thus:  If one man unwittingly fall into heresy, and another knowingly refuse to depart from idolatry, since the apostle himself says, "The   covetous man, which is an idolater;" and Cyprian too understood the same passage in just the same way, when he says, in his letter to Antonianus, "Nor let the new heretics flatter themselves in this, that they say they do not communicate with idolaters, whereas there are amongst them both adulterers and covetous persons, who are held guilty of the sin of idolatry; for know this, and understand, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance   in the kingdom of Christ and of God; <a name="fr_1361"></a><a href="#fn_1361"><font size="1">1362</font></a>
  and again, Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry." <a name="fr_1362"></a><a href="#fn_1362"><font size="1">1363</font></a>
   I ask, therefore, which sins more deeply,—he who ignorantly has fallen into heresy, or he who wittingly has refused to abandon covetousness, that is idolatry?  According to that rule by which the sins of those who sin wittingly are placed before those of the ignorant, the man who is covetous with knowledge takes the first place in sin.  But as it is possible that the greatness of the actual sin should produce the same effect in the case of heresy that the witting   commission of the sin produces in that of covetousness, let us suppose the ignorant heretic to be on <a name="page_450"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 450</font></a> <a name="v.iv.vi.v-Page_450"></a>a par in guilt with the consciously covetous man, although the evidence which Cyprian himself has advanced from the apostle does not seem to prove this.  For what is it that we abominate in heretics except their blasphemies?  But when he wished to show that ignorance of the sin may conduce to ease in obtaining pardon, he advanced a proof from the case of the apostle,   when he says, "Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly." <a name="fr_1363"></a><a href="#fn_1363"><font size="1">1364</font></a>
   But if possible, as I said before, let the sins of the two men—the blasphemy of the unconscious, and the idolatry of the conscious sinner—be esteemed of equal weight; and let them be judged by the same sentence,—he who, in seeking for Christ, falls into a truth-like setting forth of what is false, and he who wittingly resists Christ speaking through His apostle, "seeing that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance   in the kingdom of Christ and of God," <a name="fr_1364"></a><a href="#fn_1364"><font size="1">1365</font></a>
 —and then I would ask why baptism and the words of the gospel are held as naught in the former case, and accounted valid in the latter, when each is alike found to be estranged from the members of the dove.  Is it because the former is an open combatant outside, that he should not be admitted, the latter a cunning assenter within the fold, that he may not be expelled?</p>
