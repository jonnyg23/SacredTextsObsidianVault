  called sacrilegious and vipers, and swift to shed blood, to be compared with Dathan and Abiram and Korah, and are condemned in cutting terms of abhorrence; and are as openly received again with undiminished honors in company with those whom they have baptized.  Such are the fruits of these men, who do all this for the peace of Donatus, that they may clothe themselves in sheeps clothing, and reject the peace of Christ throughout the world that they may be ravening wolves   within the fold.</p>
