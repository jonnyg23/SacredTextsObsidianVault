 <p> <a name="v.v.iv.cvi"></a>  
 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.cvi-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.cvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter 106.—</span>240.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.cvi-p1.2"></a>Petilianus</span> said:  "Woe unto you, therefore, who, by doing violence to what is holy, cut away the bond of unity; whereas the prophet says, If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them:  but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?"</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.cvi-p2"></a>241.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.cvi-p2.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  I seemed too a little while ago, when we were disputing about the oil of the sinner, to anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared, whether you yourself were not a sinner.  You have had the hardihood to say as much.  What a portentous sin!  For in that you assert yourself to be a priest, what else have you maintained by quoting this testimony of the prophet, save that you are wholly without   sin?  For if you have sin, who is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the words?  For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people, quoting from the prophet:  "If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them:  but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him? <a name="fr_2299"></a><a href="#fn_2299"><font size="1">2300</font></a>
  to the intent that they may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping away their sins to your prayers.  Truly ye are great men, exalted above your fellows, heavenly, godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for the people, and will not have the people pray for you!  Are you more righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who was wont to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught?  "Continue," he says, "in prayer, and watch in   the same with thanksgiving; withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak." <a name="fr_2300"></a><a href="#fn_2300"><font size="1">2301</font></a>
   See how prayer is made for an apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop.  Do you perceive of how devilish a nature your pride is?  Prayer is made for an apostle, that he may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak.  Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you ought not.  Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says, "If we say that we   have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?" <a name="fr_2301"></a><a href="#fn_2301"><font size="1">2302</font></a>
   Finally, are you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very epistle, going so far as to say, "The most righteous king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?"—a thing which he never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, "Thy God, whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee." <a name="fr_2302"></a><a href="#fn_2302"><font size="1">2303</font></a>
   But on this subject we have already said much.  With regard to the question now before us, viz., that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony, though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with you, but by the testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only men that could be saved from a certain   excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all the rest. <a name="fr_2303"></a><a href="#fn_2303"><font size="1">2304</font></a>
   A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous for righteousness, prays, and says, "While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God." <a name="fr_2304"></a><a href="#fn_2304"><font size="1">2305</font></a>
   And you say that you are without sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if <a name="page_594"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 594</font></a> <a name="v.v.iv.cvi-Page_594"></a>the people sin, you pray for them:  but if you sin, who shall pray for you?  For clearly by the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the prophet would have to be understood in these words, which you do not understand.  For now that no one may ask why this was said, I will explain it so far as by Gods grace I   shall be able.  God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a Priest of such a sort that none should pray for Him.  He was Himself prefigured in the times of the first people and the first temple, in which all things were figures for our ensample.  Therefore the high priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that inner sanctuary; <a name="fr_2305"></a><a href="#fn_2305"><font size="1">2306</font></a>
  just as our High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies, whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here. <a name="fr_2306"></a><a href="#fn_2306"><font size="1">2307</font></a>
   It is with this reference that the prophet says, "If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them:  but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?"  Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor need that one should pray for him.  And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by the people; <a name="fr_2307"></a><a href="#fn_2307"><font size="1">2308</font></a>
  but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not made.  Hear John confessing this, and saying, "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.  And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins." <a name="fr_2308"></a><a href="#fn_2308"><font size="1">2309</font></a>
   "<i>We</i> have," he says; and "for <i>our</i> sins."  I pray you, learn humility, that you may not fall, or rather, that in time you may arise again.  For had you not already fallen, you never would have used such words.</p>
