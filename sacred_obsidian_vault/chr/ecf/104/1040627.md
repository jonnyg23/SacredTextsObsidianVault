   And since this is done anxiously and habitually in both parties, by almost all concerned, how comes it that so many are found to be reprobates subsequently to the time of having undertaken this ministry, except that, on the one hand, human care is often deceived, and, on the other hand, those who have begun well occasionally deteriorate?  And since things of this sort happen so frequently as to allow no man to hide them or to forget them, what is the <a name="page_611"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 611</font></a> <a name="v.v.v.xxx-Page_611"></a>reason that Petilianus now teaches us insultingly, in a few words, that the baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism, since our question is, by what means the conscience of the recipient is to be cleansed, when the stain on the conscience of him that gives, but not in holiness, has been concealed from view, if the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient.  "Since I see," he says, "that you are unacquainted   with the order of the sacrament, I tell you this as shortly as I can:  you were bound both to examine your baptizer, and to be examined by him."  What an answer to make!  He is surrounded in so many places by such a multitude of men that have been baptized by ministers who, having in the first instance seemed righteous and chaste, have subsequently been convicted and degraded in consequence of the disclosure of their faults:  and he thinks that he is avoiding the force of this question, in   which we ask by what means the conscience of the recipient is to be cleansed, when he is unacquainted with the stain upon the conscience of him that gives but not in holiness, if the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,—he thinks, I say, that he is avoiding the force of this question, by saying shortly that the baptizer ought to be examined.  Nothing is more unfortunate than not to be consistent with truth, by which every one   is so shut in, that he cannot find a means of escape.  We ask from whom he is to receive faith who is baptized by one that is faithless?  The answer is, "He ought to have examined his baptizer."  Is it therefore the case that, since he does not examine him, and so even unwittingly receives his faith from one that is faithless, he receives not faith but guilt?  Why then are those men not baptized afresh, who are found to have been baptized by men that are detected and convicted reprobates, while   their true character was yet concealed?</p>
