 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xvi-p2"></a>But in all these things, whatever are small are called by contrary names in comparison with greater things; as in the form of a man <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a> <a name="iv.x.xvi-Page_354"></a>because the beauty is greater, the beauty of the ape in comparison with it is called deformity.  And the imprudent are deceived, as if the former is good, and the latter evil, nor do they regard in the body of the ape its own fashion, the equality of members on both sides, the agreement of parts, the protection of safety, and other things which it would be tedious to enumerate.</p>
