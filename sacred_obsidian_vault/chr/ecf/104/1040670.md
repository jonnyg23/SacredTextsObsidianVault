 <p> <a name="v.vi.xiii"></a>   
 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.vi.xiii-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.vi.xiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 11.—</span>48.  But as to what they say, arguing as follows:  If we have sinned against the Holy Ghost, in that we have treated your baptism with contempt, why is it that you seek us, seeing that we cannot possibly receive remission of this sin, as the Lord says, "Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come?" <a name="fr_2560"></a><a href="#fn_2560"><font size="1">2561</font></a>
 —they do not perceive that according to their interpretation of the passage none can be delivered.  For who is there that does not speak against the Holy Ghost and sin against him, whether we take the case of one who is not yet a Christian, or of one who shares in the heresy of Arius, or of Eunomius, or of Macedonius, who all say that He is a creature; or of Photinus, who denies that He has any substance at all, saying that there is only one God, the Father; or of any of the other heretics, whom it would now take too long a time to mention in detail?  Are none, therefore, of these to be delivered?  Or if the Jews themselves, against whom the Lord directed His reproach, were to believe in Him, would they not be allowed to be baptized? for the Saviour does not say, Shall be forgiven in baptism:  but "Shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xiii-p3"></a>49.  Let them understand, therefore, that it is not every sin, but only some sin, against the Holy Ghost which is incapable of forgiveness.  For just as when our Lord said, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin," <a name="fr_2561"></a><a href="#fn_2561"><font size="1">2562</font></a>
  it is clear that He did not wish it to be understood that they would have been free from all sin, since they were filled with many grievous sins, but that they would have been free from some special sin, the absence of which would have left them in a position to receive remission of all the sins which yet remained in them, viz., the sin of not believing in Him when He came to them; for they could not have had this sin, had He not come.  In like manner, also, when He said, "Whosoever sinneth against the Holy Ghost,"or, "Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost;" it is clear that He does not refer to every sin of whatsoever kind against the Holy Ghost, in word or deed, but would have us understand some special and peculiar sin.  But this is the hardness of heart even to the end of this life, which leads a man to refuse to accept remission of his sins in the unity of the body of Christ, to which life is given by the Holy Ghost.  For when He had said to His disciples "Receive the Holy Ghost," immediately added, Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained." <a name="fr_2562"></a><a href="#fn_2562"><font size="1">2563</font></a>
   Whosoever therefore has resisted or fought against this gift of the grace of God, or has been estranged from it in any way whatever to the end of this mortal life, shall not receive the remission of that sin, either in this world, or in the world to come, seeing that it is so great a sin that in it is included every sin; but it cannot <a name="page_651"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 651</font></a> <a name="v.vi.xiii-Page_651"></a>be proved to have been committed by any one, till he has passed away from life.  But so long as he lives here, "the goodness of God," as the apostle says, "is leading him to repentance;" but if he deliberately, with the utmost perseverance in iniquity, as the apostle adds in the succeeding verse, "after his hardness and impenitent heart, treasures up unto himself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God," <a name="fr_2563"></a><a href="#fn_2563"><font size="1">2564</font></a>
  he shall not receive forgiveness, neither in this world, neither in that which is to come.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xiii-p7"></a>50.  But those with whom we are arguing, or about whom we are arguing, are not to be despaired of, for they are yet in the body; but they cannot seek the Holy Spirit, except in the body of Christ, of which they possess the outward sign outside the Church, but they do not possess the actual reality itself within the Church of which that is the outward sign, and therefore they eat and drink damnation to themselves. <a name="fr_2564"></a><a href="#fn_2564"><font size="1">2565</font></a>
   For there is but one bread which is the sacrament of unity, seeing that, as the apostle says, "We, being many, are one bread, and one body." <a name="fr_2565"></a><a href="#fn_2565"><font size="1">2566</font></a>
   Furthermore, the Catholic Church alone is the body of Christ, of which He is the Head and Saviour of His body. <a name="fr_2566"></a><a href="#fn_2566"><font size="1">2567</font></a>
   Outside this body the Holy Spirit giveth life to no one seeing that, as the apostle says himself, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us;" <a name="fr_2567"></a><a href="#fn_2567"><font size="1">2568</font></a>
  but he is not a partaker of the divine love who is the enemy of unity.  Therefore they have not the Holy Ghost who are outside the Church; for it is written of them, "They separate themselves being sensual, having not the Spirit." <a name="fr_2568"></a><a href="#fn_2568"><font size="1">2569</font></a>
   But neither does he receive it who is insincerely in the Church, since this is also the intent of what is written:  "For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit." <a name="fr_2569"></a><a href="#fn_2569"><font size="1">2570</font></a>
   If any one, therefore, wishes to receive the Holy Spirit, let him beware of continuing in alienation from the Church, let him beware of entering it in the spirit of dissimulation; or if he has already entered it in such wise, let him beware of persisting in such dissimulation, in order that he may truly and indeed become united with the tree of life.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xiii-p14"></a>51.  I have despatched to you a somewhat lengthy epistle, which may prove burdensome among your many occupations.  If, therefore, it may be read to you even in portions, the Lord will grant you understanding, that you may have some answer which you can make for the correction and healing of those men who are commended to you as to a faithful son by our mother the Church, that you may correct and heal them, by the aid of the Lord wherever you can, and howsoever you can, either by speaking and replying to them in your own person, or by bringing them into communication with the doctors of the Church.</p>
