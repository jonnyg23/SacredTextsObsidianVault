 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxiv-p2"></a>80.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxiv-p2.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  Where then is what you said above, that there was not one baptism of John and another of Christ, but that there was one baptism, consecrated in three stages, of which three stages John gave the water, Christ the Spirit, and the Comforter the fire?  Why then did the apostles repeat the water in the case of those to whom John had already administered water belonging to the one baptism which is consecrated in three   stages?  Surely you must see how necessary it is that every one should understand the meaning of what he is discussing.</p>
