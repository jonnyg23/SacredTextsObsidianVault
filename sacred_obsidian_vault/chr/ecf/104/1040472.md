   there are many still remaining in this life and in this province who have severed themselves, and many from whom they have severed themselves; many who have erected an altar, and many against whom that altar has been erected; many who have condemned, and many who have been condemned; who have received, and who have been received; who have been baptized outside, and not baptized again within:  if all these things in the cause of unity defile, let the defiled hold their   tongues; if these things in the cause of unity do not defile, let them submit to correction, and terminate their strife.</p>
