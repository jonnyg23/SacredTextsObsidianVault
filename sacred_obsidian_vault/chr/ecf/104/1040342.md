 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.vii.xvii-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.vii.xvii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 17.—</span>22.  But, having considered and handled all these points, we have now come to that peaceful utterance of Cyprian at the end of the epistle, with which I am never sated, though I read and re-read it again and again,—so great is the pleasantness of brotherly love which breathes forth from it, so great the sweetness of charity in which it abounds.  "These things," he says, "we have written unto you, dearest brother, shortly,   according to our poor ability, prescribing to or prejudging no one, lest each bishop should not do what he thinks right, in the free exercise of his own will.  We, so far as in us lies, do not contend on the subject of heretics with our colleagues and fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain concord and peace in the Lord; especially as the apostle also says, If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. <a name="fr_1511"></a><a href="#fn_1511"><font size="1">1512</font></a>
   We observe patiently and gently charity of spirit, the honor of our brotherhood, the bond of faith, the harmony of the priesthood.  For this reason also, to the best of our poor ability, by the permission and the inspiration of God we have written this treatise on The Good of Patience, which we have sent to you in consideration of our mutual love." <a name="fr_1512"></a><a href="#fn_1512"><font size="1">1513</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.vii.xvii-p4"></a>23.  There are many things to be considered in these words, wherein the brightness of Christian charity shines forth in this man, who "loved the beauty of the Lords house, and the place of the tabernacle of His habitation." <a name="fr_1513"></a><a href="#fn_1513"><font size="1">1514</font></a>
   First, that he did not conceal what he felt; then, that he set it forth so gently and peacefully, in that he maintained the peace of the Church with those who thought otherwise, because he understood how great healthfulness was bound up in the bond of peace, loving it so much, and maintaining it with sobriety, seeing and feeling that even men who think differently may entertain their several sentiments with saving charity.  For he would not say that he could maintain   divine concord or the peace of the Lord with evil men; for the good man can observe peace towards wicked men, but he cannot be united with them in the peace which they have not.  Lastly, that prescribing to no one, and prejudging no one, lest each bishop should not do what he thinks right in the free exercise of his own will, he has left for us also, whatsoever we may be, a place for treating peacefully of those things with him.  For he is present, not only in his letters, but by that very   charity which existed in so extraordinary a degree in him, and which can never die.  Longing, therefore, with the aid of his prayers, to cling to and be in union with him, if I be not hindered by the unmeetness of my sins, I will learn if I can through his letters with how great peace and comfort the Lord administered His Church through him; and, putting on the bowels of humility through the moving influence of his discourse, if, in common with the Church at large, I entertain any doctrine more   true than his, I will not prefer my heart to his, even in the point in which he, though holding different views, was yet not severed from the Church throughout the world.  For in that, when that question was yet undecided for want of full discussion, though his sentiments differed from those of many of his colleagues, yet he observed so great moderation, that he would not mutilate the sacred fellowship of the Church of God by any stain of schism, a greater strength of excellence appeared in him   than would have been shown if, without that virtue, he had held views on every point not only true, but coinciding with their own.  Nor should I be acting as he would wish, if I were to pretend to prefer his talent and his fluency of discourse and copiousness of learning to the holy Council of all nations, whereat he was assuredly present through the unity of his spirit, especially as he is now placed in such full light of truth as to see with perfect certainty what he was here seeking in the   spirit of perfect peace.  For out of that rich abundance he smiles at all that here seems eloquence in us, as though it were the first essay of infancy; there he sees by what rule of piety he acted here, that nothing should be dearer in the Church to him than unity.  There, too, with unspeakable delight he beholds with what prescient and most merciful providence the Lord, that He might heal our swellings, "chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise,"    <a name="fr_1514"></a><a href="#fn_1514"><font size="1">1515</font></a>
  and, in the ordering of the members of His Church, placed all things in such a healthful way, that men should not say <a name="page_472"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 472</font></a> <a name="v.iv.vii.xvii-Page_472"></a>that they were chosen to the help of the gospel for their own talent or learning, of whose source they yet were ignorant, and so be puffed up with deadly pride.  Oh, how Cyprian rejoices!  With how much more perfect calmness does he behold how greatly it conduces to the health of the human race, that in the writings even of   Christian and pious orators there should be found what merits blame, and in the writings of the fishermen there should nothing of the sort be found!  And so I, being fully assured of this joy of that holy soul, neither in any way venture to think or say that my writings are free from every kind of error, nor, in opposing that opinion of his, wherein it seemed to him that those who came from among heretics were to be received otherwise than either they had been in former days, as he himself   bears witness, or are now received, as is the reasonable custom, confirmed by a plenary Council of the whole Christian world, do I set against him my own view, but that of the holy Catholic Church, which he so loved and loves, in which he brought forth such abundant fruit with tolerance, whose entirety he himself was not, but in whose entirety he remained; whose root he never left, but, though he already brought forth fruit from its root, he was purged by the heavenly Husbandman that he should   bring forth more fruit; <a name="fr_1515"></a><a href="#fn_1515"><font size="1">1516</font></a>
  for whose peace and safety, that the wheat might not be rooted out together with the tares, he both reproved with the freedom of truth, and endured with the grace of charity, so many evils on the part of men who were placed in unity with himself.</p>
