 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.ci-p3"></a>230.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.ci-p3.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  You do the destruction which you speak of, not with a visible sword, but with that of which it is said, "The sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword." <a name="fr_2276"></a><a href="#fn_2276"><font size="1">2277</font></a>
   For with this sword of accusation and calumny against the world of which you are wholly ignorant, you destroy the souls of those who lack experience.  But if you find fault with a most wicked communion, as you term it, I would bid you presently, not with my words, but with your own, to ascend, descend, enter, turn yourself about, change sides, be such as was Optatus.  But if you return to your senses, and shall find that you are not such as he, not because he refused to   partake of the sacraments with you, but because you took offense at what he did, then you will acquit the world of crimes which do not belong to it, and you will find yourself involved in the sin of schism.</p>
