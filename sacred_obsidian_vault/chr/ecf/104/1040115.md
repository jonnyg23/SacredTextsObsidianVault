 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xiv-p2"></a>16.  "In the beginning, then," he says, "these two substances were divided.  The empire of light was held by God the Father, who is perpetual in holy origin, magnificent in virtue, true in His very nature, ever rejoicing in His own eternity, possessing in Himself wisdom and the vital senses, by which He also includes the twelve members of His light, which are the plentiful resources of his kingdom.  Also in each of His members are stored thousands of untold and priceless treasures.  But the Father Himself, chief in praise, incomprehensible in greatness, has united to Himself happy and glorious worlds, incalculable in number and duration, along with which this holy and illustrious Father and Progenitor resides, no poverty or infirmity being admitted in His magnificent realms.  And these matchless realms are so founded on the region of light and bliss, that no one can ever move or disturb them." <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">279</font></a>
 </p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xiv-p4"></a>17.  Where is the proof of all this?  And where did Manichæus learn it?  Do not frighten me with the name of the Paraclete.  For, in the first place, I have come not to put faith in unknown things, but to get the knowledge of undoubted truths, according to the caution enjoined on me by yourselves.  For you know how bitterly you taunt those who believe without consideration.  And what is more, this writer, who here begins to tell of very doubtful things, himself promised a little before to give complete and well-grounded knowledge.</p>
