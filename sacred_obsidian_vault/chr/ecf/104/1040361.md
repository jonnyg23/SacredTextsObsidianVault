 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.viii.vii-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.viii.vii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 7.—</span>10.  I have already, I think, argued to the best of my power, in the preceding books, in the interests of Catholic unanimity and counsel, in whose unity these continued as pious members, in reply not only to the letter which Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus, but also to that which he sent to Quintus, and that which, in conjunction with certain of his colleagues, he sent to certain other colleagues, and that which he sent to   Pompeius.  Wherefore it seems now to be fitting to consider also what the others severally thought, and that with the liberty of which he himself would not deprive us, as he says, "Judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain different opinions."  And that he did not say this with the object of arriving at the hidden thoughts of his colleagues, extracted as it were from their secret lurking-places, but because he really loved peace and unity, is very easily to be   seen from other passages of the same sort, where he wrote to individuals as to Jubaianus himself.  "These things," he says, "we have written very shortly in answer to you, most beloved brother, according to our poor ability, not preventing any one of the bishops by our writing or judgment, from acting as he thinks right, having a free exercise of his own judgment." <a name="fr_1592"></a><a href="#fn_1592"><font size="1">1593</font></a>
   And that it might not seem that any one, because of his entertaining different opinions in this same free exercise of his judgment, should be driven from the society of his brethren, he goes on to say, "We, so far as lies in us, do not strive on behalf of heretics against our colleagues and fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain godly unity and the peace of our Lord;" <a name="fr_1593"></a><a href="#fn_1593"><font size="1">1594</font></a>
  and a little later he says, "Charity of spirit, respect for our fraternity, the bond of faith, the harmony of the priesthood, are by us maintained with patience and gentleness." <a name="fr_1594"></a><a href="#fn_1594"><font size="1">1595</font></a>
   And so also in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, when he was asked whether there was any difference in the efficacy of baptism by sprinkling or by immersion, "In this matter," he says, "I am too modest and diffident to prevent any one by my judgment from thinking as he deems right, and acting as he thinks." <a name="fr_1595"></a><a href="#fn_1595"><font size="1">1596</font></a>
   By which discourses he clearly shows that these subjects were being handled by them at a time when they were not yet received as decided beyond all question, but were being investigated with great care as being yet unrevealed.  We, therefore, maintaining on the subject of the identity of all baptisms what must be acknowledged everywhere to be the custom <a name="fr_1596"></a><a href="#fn_1596"><font size="1">1597</font></a>
  of the universal Church, and what is confirmed by the decision of general Councils, <a name="fr_1597"></a><a href="#fn_1597"><font size="1">1598</font></a>
  and taking greater confidence also from the words of Cyprian, which allowed me even then to hold opinions differing from his own without forfeiting the right of communion, seeing that greater importance and praise were attached to unity, such as the blessed Cyprian and his colleagues, with whom he held that Council, maintained with those of different opinions, disturbing and overthrowing thereby the seditious calumnies of heretics and schismatics in the name of the Lord   Jesus Christ, who, speaking by His apostle, says, "Forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;" <a name="fr_1598"></a><a href="#fn_1598"><font size="1">1599</font></a>
  and again, by the mouth of the same apostle, "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you," <a name="fr_1599"></a><a href="#fn_1599"><font size="1">1600</font></a>
 —we, I say, propose for consideration and discussion the opinions of the holy bishops, without violating the bond of unity and peace with them, in maintaining which we imitate them so far as we can by the aid of the Lord Himself.</p>
