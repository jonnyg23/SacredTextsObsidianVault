 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.v.xix-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.v.xix-p1.1"></a>Chapter 19.—</span>25.  They indeed who say that baptism is not to be repeated, because only hands were laid on those whom Philip the deacon had baptized, <a name="fr_1315"></a><a href="#fn_1315"><font size="1">1316</font></a>
  are saying what is quite beside the point; and far be it from us, in seeking the truth, to use such arguments as this.  Wherefore we are all the further from "yielding to heretics," <a name="fr_1316"></a><a href="#fn_1316"><font size="1">1317</font></a>
  if we deny that what they possess of Christs Church is their own property, and do not refuse to acknowledge the standard of our General because of the crimes of deserters; nay, all the more because "the Lord our God is a jealous God," <a name="fr_1317"></a><a href="#fn_1317"><font size="1">1318</font></a>
  let us refuse, whenever we see anything of His with an alien, to allow him to consider it his own.  For of a truth the jealous God Himself rebukes the woman who commits fornication against Him, as the type of an erring people, and says that she gave to her lovers what belonged to Him, and again received from them what was not theirs but His.  In the hands of the adulterous woman and the adulterous lovers, God in His wrath, as a jealous God, recognizes His gifts; and do we   say that baptism, consecrated in the words of the gospel, belongs to heretics? and are we willing, from consideration of their deeds, to attribute to them even what belongs to God, as though they had the power to pollute it, or as though they could make what is Gods to be their own, because they themselves have refused to belong to God?</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.v.xix-p5"></a>26.  Who is that adulterous woman whom the prophet Hosea points out, who said, "I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and everything that befits me?" <a name="fr_1318"></a><a href="#fn_1318"><font size="1">1319</font></a>
   Let us grant that we may understand this also of the people of the Jews that went astray; yet whom else are the false Christians (such as are all heretics and schismatics) wont to imitate, except false Israelites?  For there were also true Israelites, as the Lord Himself bears witness to Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile." <a name="fr_1319"></a><a href="#fn_1319"><font size="1">1320</font></a>
   But who are true Christians, save those of whom the same Lord said, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me?" <a name="fr_1320"></a><a href="#fn_1320"><font size="1">1321</font></a>
   But what is it to keep His commandments, except to abide in love?  Whence also He says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another;" and again, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." <a name="fr_1321"></a><a href="#fn_1321"><font size="1">1322</font></a>
   But who can doubt that this was spoken not only to those <a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 445</font></a> <a name="v.iv.v.xix-Page_445"></a>who heard His words with their fleshly ears when He was present with them, but also to those who learn His words through the gospel, when He is sitting on His throne in heaven?  For He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill. <a name="fr_1322"></a><a href="#fn_1322"><font size="1">1323</font></a>
   But the fulfilling of the law is love. <a name="fr_1323"></a><a href="#fn_1323"><font size="1">1324</font></a>
   And in this Cyprian abounded greatly, insomuch that though he held a different view concerning baptism, he yet did not forsake the unity of the Church, and was in the Lords vine a branch firmly rooted, bearing fruit, which the heavenly Husbandman purged with the knife of suffering, that it should bear more fruit. <a name="fr_1324"></a><a href="#fn_1324"><font size="1">1325</font></a>
   But the enemies of this brotherly love, whether they are openly without, or appear to be within, are false Christians, and antichrists.  For when they have found an opportunity, they go out, as it is written:  "A man wishing to separate himself from his friends, seeketh opportunities." <a name="fr_1325"></a><a href="#fn_1325"><font size="1">1326</font></a>
   But even if occasions are wanting, while they seem to be within, they are severed from that invisible bond of love.  Whence St. John says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us." <a name="fr_1326"></a><a href="#fn_1326"><font size="1">1327</font></a>
   He does not say that they ceased to be of us by going out, but that they went out because they were not of us.  The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the truth, and were overthrowing the faith of some; whose word was eating as a canker.  Yet in saying that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonor,—I suppose because they had not as yet gone out.  Or if they had already   gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the honorable vessels, unless it was in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the severed meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to honor and some to dishonor?  For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy:  "But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness.  And their word will   eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His.  And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.  If a   man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the masters use, and prepared unto every good work." <a name="fr_1327"></a><a href="#fn_1327"><font size="1">1328</font></a>
   But what is it to purge oneself from such as these, except what he said just before, "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."  And lest any one should think that, as being in one great house with them, he might perish with such as these, he has most carefully forewarned them, "The Lord knoweth them that are His,"—those, namely, who, by departing from iniquity, purge themselves from the vessels made to dishonor, lest they should perish with them   whom they are compelled to tolerate in the great house.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.v.xix-p16"></a>27.  They, therefore, who are wicked, evildoers, carnal, fleshly, devilish, think that they receive at the hands of their seducers what are the gifts of God alone, whether sacraments, or any spiritual workings about present salvation.  But these men have not love towards God, but are busied about those by whose pride they are led astray, and are compared to the adulterous woman, whom the prophet introduces as saying, "I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread   and my water, my wool and my flax, and my oil, and everything that befits me."  For thus arise heresies and schisms, when the fleshly people which is not founded on the love of God says, "I will go after my lovers," with whom, either by corruption of her faith, or by the puffing up of her pride, she shamefully commits adultery.  But for the sake of those who, having undergone the difficulties, and straits, and barriers of the empty reasoning of those by whom they are led astray, afterwards feel   the prickings of fear, and return to the way of peace, to seeking God in all sincerity,—for their sake He goes on to say, "Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.  And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them:  and she shall seek them, but she shall not find them:  then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now."  Then, that they may not attribute   to their seducers what they have that is sound, and derived from the doctrine of truth, by which they lead them astray to the falseness of their own dogmas and dissensions; that they may not think that what is sound in them belongs to them, he immediately added, "And she did not know that I gave her corn, and <a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 446</font></a> <a name="v.iv.v.xix-Page_446"></a>wine, and oil, and multiplied her money; but she made vessels of gold and silver for Baal." <a name="fr_1328"></a><a href="#fn_1328"><font size="1">1329</font></a>
   For she had said above, "I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread," etc., not at all understanding that all this, which was held soundly and lawfully by her seducers, was of God, and not of men.  Nor would even they themselves claim these things for themselves, and as it were assert a right in them, had not they in turn been led astray by a people which had gone astray, when faith is reposed in them, and such honors are paid to them, that they should be enabled   thereby to say such things, and claim such things for themselves, that their error should be called truth, and their iniquity be thought righteousness, in virtue of the sacraments and Scriptures, which they hold, not for salvation, but only in appearance.  Accordingly, the same adulterous woman is addressed by the mouth of Ezekiel:  "Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them;   and tookest my <a name="fr_1329"></a><a href="#fn_1329"><font size="1">1330</font></a>
  broidered garments, and coveredst them:  and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.  My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before thine idols for a sweet savor:  and this thou hast done." <a name="fr_1330"></a><a href="#fn_1330"><font size="1">1331</font></a>
   For she turns all the sacraments, and the words of the sacred books, to the images of her own idols, with which her carnal mind delights to wallow.  Nor yet, because those images are false, and the doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, <a name="fr_1331"></a><a href="#fn_1331"><font size="1">1332</font></a>
  are those sacraments and divine utterances therefore so to lose their due honor, as to be thought to belong to such as these; seeing that the Lord says," Of my gold, and my silver, and my broidered garments, and mine oil, and mine incense, and my meat," and so forth.  Ought we, because those erring ones think that these things belong to their seducers, therefore not to recognize whose they really are, when He Himself says, "And she did not know that I gave her corn, and   wine, and oil, and multiplied her money"?  For He did not say that she did not have these things because she was an adulteress; but she is said to have had them, and that not as belonging to herself or her lovers, but to God, whose alone they are.  Although, therefore, she had her fornication, yet those things wherewith she adorned it, whether as seduced or in her turn seducing, belonged not to her, but to God.  If these things were spoken in a figure of the Jewish nation, when the scribes and   Pharisees were rejecting the commandment of God in order to set up their own traditions, so that they were in a manner committing whoredom with a people which was abandoning their God; and yet for all that, whoredom at that time among the people, such as the Lord brought to light by convicting it, did not cause that the mysteries should belong to them, which were not theirs but Gods, who, in speaking to the adulteress, says that all these things were His; whence the Lord Himself also sent   those whom He cleansed from leprosy to the same mysteries, that they should offer sacrifice for themselves before the priests, because that sacrifice had not become efficacious for them, which He Himself afterwards wished to be commemorated in the Church for all of them, because He Himself proclaimed the tidings to them all;—if this be so, how much the more ought we, when we find the sacraments of the New Testament among certain heretics or schismatics, not to attribute them to these men, nor   to condemn them, as though we could not recognize them?  We ought to recognize the gifts of the true husband, though in the possession of an adulteress, and to amend, by the word of truth, that whoredom which is the true possession of the unchaste woman, instead of finding fault with the gifts, which belong entirely to the pitying Lord.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.v.xix-p21"></a>28.  From these considerations, and such as these, our forefathers, not only before the time of Cyprian and Agrippinus, but even afterwards, maintained a most wholesome custom, that whenever they found anything divine and lawful remaining in its integrity even in the midst of any heresy or schism, they approved rather than repudiated it; but whatever they found that was alien, and peculiar to that false doctrine or division, this they convicted in the light of the   truth, and healed.  The points, however, which remain to be considered in the letter written by Jubaianus, must, I think, when looking at the size of this book, be taken in hand and treated with a fresh beginning.</p>
