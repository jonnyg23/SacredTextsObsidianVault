 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxiv-p2"></a>But God cannot be said to have measure, lest He should seem to be spoken of as limited.  Yet He is not immoderate by whom measure is bestowed upon all things, so that they may in any measure exist.  Nor again ought God to be called measured, as if He received measure from any one.  But if we say that He is the highest measure, by chance we say something; if indeed in speaking of the highest measure we mean the highest good.  For every measure in so far as it is a measure is good; whence nothing can be called measured, modest, modified, without praise, although in another sense we use measure for limit, and speak of no measure where there is no limit, which is sometimes said with praise as when it is said:  "And of His kingdom there shall be no limit." <a name="fr_1094"></a><a href="#fn_1094"><font size="1">1095</font></a>
   For it might also be said, "There shall be no measure," so that measure might be used in the sense of limit; for He who reigns in no measure, assuredly does not reign at all.</p>
