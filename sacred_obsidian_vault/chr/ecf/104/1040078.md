 </p><p class="c38"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p1.1"></a>Chapter 19.—Crimes of the Manichæans.</span></p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p2"></a>67.  We see then, now, the nature of your three symbols.  These are your customs.  This is the end of your notable precepts, in which there is nothing sure, nothing steadfast, nothing consistent, nothing irreproachable, but all doubtful, or rather undoubtedly and entirely false, all contradictory, abominable, absurd.  In a word, evil practices are detected in your customs so many and so serious, that one wishing to denounce them all, if he were at all able to enlarge, would require at least a separate treatise for each.  Were you to observe these, and to act up to your profession, no childishness, or folly, or absurdity would go beyond yours; and when you praise and teach these things without doing them, you display craft and deceit and malevolence equal to anything that can be described or imagined.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p3"></a>68.  During nine full years that I attended you with great earnestness and assiduity, I could not hear of one of your elect who was not found transgressing these precepts, or at least was not suspected of doing so.  Many were caught at wine and animal food, many at the baths; but this we only heard by report.  Some were proved to have seduced other mens wives, so that in this case I could not doubt the truth of the charge.  But suppose this, too, a report rather than a fact.  I myself saw, and not I only, but others who have either escaped from that superstition, or will, I hope, yet escape,—we saw, I say, in a square in Carthage, on a road much frequented, not one, but more than three of the elect walking behind us, and accosting some women with such indecent sounds and gestures as to outdo the boldness and insolence of all ordinary rascals.  And it was clear that this was quite habitual, and that they behaved in this way to one another, for no one was deterred by the presence of a companion, showing that most of them, if not all, were affected with this evil tendency.  For they did not all come from one house, but lived in quite different places, and quite accidentally left together the place where they had met.  It was a great shock to us, and we lodged a complaint about it.  But who thought of inflicting punishment,—I say not by separation from the church, but even by severe rebuke in proportion to the heinousness of the offence?</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p4"></a>69.  All the excuse given for the impunity of those men was that, at that time, when their meetings were forbidden by law, it was feared that the persons suffering punishment might retaliate by giving information.  What then of their assertion that they will always have persecution in this world, for which they suppose that they will be thought the more of? for this is the application they make of the words about the world hating them.  <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">186</font></a>
   And they will have it that truth must be sought for among them, because, in the promise of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, it is said that the world cannot receive Him. <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">187</font></a>
   This is not the place to discuss this question.  But clearly, <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a> <a name="iv.v.xxi-Page_88"></a>if you are always to be persecuted, even to the end of the world, there will be no end to this laxity, and to the unchecked spread of all this immorality, from your fear of giving offence to men of this character.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p7"></a>70.  This answer was also given to us, when we reported to the very highest authorities that a woman had complained to us that in a meeting, where she was along with other women, not doubting of the sanctity of these people, some of the elect came in, and when one of them had put out the lamp, one, whom she could not distinguish, tried to embrace her, and would have forced her into sin, had she not escaped by crying out.  How common must we conclude the practice to have been which led to the misdeed on this occasion!  And this was done on the night when you keep the feast of vigils.  Forsooth, besides the fear of information being given, no one could bring the offender before the bishop, as he had so well guarded against being recognized.  As if all who entered along with him were not implicated in the crime; for in their indecent merriment they all wished the lamp to be put out.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p8"></a>71.  Then what wide doors were opened for suspicions, when we saw them full of envy, full of covetousness, full of greed for costly foods, constantly at strife, easily excited about trifles!  We concluded that they were not competent to abstain from the things they professed to abstain from, if they found an opportunity in secret or in the dark.  There were two of sufficiently good character, of active minds, and leaders in their debates, with whom we had a more particular and intimate acquaintance than with the rest.  One of them was much associated with us, because he was also engaged in liberal studies; he is said to be now an elder there.  These two were very jealous of one another, and one accused the other—not openly, but in conversation, as he had opportunity, and in whispers—of having made a criminal assault on the wife of one of the followers.  He again, in clearing himself to us, brought the same charge against another of the elect, who lived with this follower as his most trusted friend.  He had, going in suddenly, caught this man with the woman, and his enemy and rival had advised the woman and her paramour to raise this false report about him, that he might not be believed if he gave any information.  We were much distressed, and took it greatly to heart, that although there was a doubt about the assault on the woman, the jealous feeling in those two men, than whom we found none better in the place, showed itself so keenly, and inevitably raised a suspicion of other things. <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">188</font></a>
 </p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p10"></a>72.  Another thing was, that we very often saw in theatres men belonging to the elect, men of years and, it was supposed, of character, along with a hoary-headed elder.  We pass over the youths, whom we used to come upon quarrelling about the people connected with the stage and the races; from which we may safely conclude how they would be able to refrain in secret, when they could not subdue the passion by which they were exposed in the eyes of their followers, bringing on them disgrace and flight.  In the case of the saint, whose discussions we attended in the street of the fig-sellers, would his atrocious crime have been discovered if he had been able to make the dedicated virgin his wife without making her pregnant?  The swelling womb betrayed the secret and unthought-of iniquity.  When her brother, a young man, heard of it from his mother, he felt keenly the injury, but refrained, from regard to religion, from a public accusation.  He succeeded in getting the man expelled from that church, for such conduct cannot always be tolerated; and that the crime might not be wholly unpunished, he arranged with some of his friends to have the man well beaten and kicked.  When he was thus assailed, he cried out that they should spare him, from regard to the authority of the opinion of Manichæus, that Adam the first hero had sinned, and was a greater saint after his sin.</p>   
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.v.xxi-p11"></a>73.  This, in fact, is your notion about Adam and Eve. <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">189</font></a>
   It is a long story; but I will touch only on what concerns the present matter.  You say that Adam was produced from his parents, the abortive princes of darkness; that he had in his soul the most part of light, and very little of the opposite race.  So while he lived a holy life, on account of the prevalence of good, still the opposite part in him was stirred up, so that he was led away into conjugal intercourse.  Thus he fell and sinned, but afterwards lived in greater holiness.  Now, my complaint is not so much about this wicked man, who, under the garb of an elect and holy man, brought such shame and reproach on a family of strangers by his shocking immorality.  I do not charge you with this.  Let it be attributed to the abandoned character of the man, and not to your habits.  I blame the man for the atrocity, and not you.  Still there is <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a> <a name="iv.v.xxi-Page_89"></a>this in you all that cannot, as far as I can see, be admitted or tolerated, that while you hold the soul to be part of God, you still maintain that the mixture of a little evil prevailed over the superior force and quantity of good.  Who that believes this, when incited by passion, will not find here an excuse, instead of checking and controlling his passion?</p>
