 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.ix.liii-p2"></a>102.  But the safe course for us is, not to advance with any rashness of judgment in setting forth a view which has neither been started in any regionary Council of the Catholic Church nor established in a plenary one; but to assert, with all the confidence of a voice that cannot be gainsaid, what has been confirmed by the consent of the universal Church, under the direction of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ.  Nevertheless, if any one were to press   me—supposing I were duly seated in a Council in which a question were raised on points like these—to declare what my own opinion was, without reference to the previously expressed views of others, whose judgment I would rather follow, if I were under the influence of the same feelings as led me to assert what I have said before, I should have no hesitation in saying that all men possess baptism who have received it in any place, from any sort of men, provided that it were consecrated in the   words of the gospel, and received without deceit on their part with some degree of faith; although it would be of no profit to them for the salvation of their souls if they were without charity, by which they might be grafted into the Catholic Church.  For "though I have faith," says the apostle, "so that I could remove mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing." <a name="fr_1915"></a><a href="#fn_1915"><font size="1">1916</font></a>
   Just as already, from the established decrees of our predecessors, I have no hesitation in saying that all those have baptism who, though they receive it deceitfully, yet receive it in the Church, or where the Church is thought to be by those in whose society it is received, of whom it was said, "They went out from us." <a name="fr_1916"></a><a href="#fn_1916"><font size="1">1917</font></a>
   But when there was no society of those who so believed, and when the man who received it did not himself hold such belief, but the whole thing was done as a farce, or a comedy, or a jest,—if I were asked whether the baptism which was thus conferred should be approved, I should declare my opinion that we ought to pray for the declaration of Gods judgment through the medium of some revelation seeking it with united prayer and earnest groanings of suppliant devotion, humbly   deferring all the time to the decision of those who were to give their judgment after me, in case they should set forth anything as already known and determined.  And, therefore, how much the more must I be considered to have given my opinion now without prejudice to the utterance of more diligent research or authority higher than my own!</p>
