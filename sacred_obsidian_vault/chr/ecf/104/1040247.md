 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.iii.v-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.iii.v-p1.1"></a>Chapter 5.—</span>6.  I prefer, he says, to receive Christs baptism where both parties agree that it exists.  But those whom you intend to join say that it cannot be received there rightly; and those who say that it can be received there rightly are the party whom you mean to quit.  What they say, therefore, whom you yourself consider of inferior authority, in opposition to what those say whom you yourself prefer, is, if not false, at any rate, to   use a milder term, at least uncertain.  I entreat you, therefore, to prefer what is true to what is false, or what is certain to what is uncertain.  For it is not only those whom <a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 415</font></a> <a name="v.iv.iii.v-Page_415"></a>you are going to join, but you yourself who are going to join them, that confess that what you want can be rightly received in that body which you mean to join when you have received it elsewhere.  For if you had any doubts whether it could be rightly received there, you would also have doubts   whether you ought to make the change.  If, therefore, it is doubtful whether it be not sin to receive baptism from the party of Donatus, who can doubt but that it is certain sin not to prefer receiving it where it is certain that it is not sin?  And those who are baptized there through ignorance, thinking that it is the true Church of Christ, are guilty of less sin in comparison than these, though even they are wounded by the impiety of schism; nor do they escape a grievous hurt, because others   suffer even more.  For when it is said to certain men, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you," <a name="fr_1155"></a><a href="#fn_1155"><font size="1">1156</font></a>
  it is not meant that the men of Sodom shall escape torment, but only that the others shall be even more grievously tormented.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.iii.v-p3"></a>7.  And yet this point had once, perhaps, been involved in obscurity and doubt.  But that which is a source of health to those who give heed and receive correction, is but an aggravation of the sin of those who, when they are no longer suffered to be ignorant, persist in their madness to their own destruction.  For the condemnation of the party of Maximianus, and their restoration after they had been condemned, together with those whom they had sacrilegiously,   to use the language of their own Council, <a name="fr_1156"></a><a href="#fn_1156"><font size="1">1157</font></a>
  baptized in schism, settles the whole question in dispute, and removes all controversy.  There is no point at issue between ourselves and those Donatists who hold communion with Primianus, which could give rise to any doubt that the baptism of Christ may not only be retained, but even conferred by those who are severed from the Church.  For as they themselves are obliged to confess that those whom Felicianus baptized in schism received true baptism, inasmuch as they now   acknowledge them as members of their own body, with no other baptism than that which they received in schism; so we say that that is Christs baptism, even without the pale of Catholic communion, which they confer who are cut off from that communion, inasmuch as they had not lost it when they were cut off.  And what they themselves think that they conferred on those persons whom Felicianus baptized in schism, when they admitted them to reconcilation with themselves, viz., not that they should   receive that which they did not as yet possess, but that what they had received to no advantage in schism, and were already in possession of, should be of profit to them, this God really confers and bestows through the Catholic communion on those who come from any heresy or schism in which they received the baptism of Christ; viz., not that they should begin to receive the sacrament of baptism as not possessing it before, but that what they already possessed should now begin to profit   them.</p>
