   Whosoever, therefore, has incurred the guilt of treason, has forfeited, like you, his baptism.  Again, after that the betrayer of Christ had himself been condemned, He thus more fully confirmed His words to the eleven apostles:  Now are ye clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.  Abide in me, and I in you. <a name="fr_2041"></a><a href="#fn_2041"><font size="1">2042</font></a>
   And again He said to these same eleven, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. <a name="fr_2042"></a><a href="#fn_2042"><font size="1">2043</font></a>
   Seeing, then, that these things were said to the eleven apostles, when the traitor, as we have seen, had been condemned, you likewise, being <i>traditors</i>, are similarly without both peace and baptism."</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxii-p5"></a>50.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxii-p5.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  If therefore every <i>traditor</i> has forfeited his baptism, it will follow that every one who, having been baptized by you, has afterwards become a <i>traditor</i>, ought to be baptized afresh.  And if you do not do this, you yourselves sufficiently prove the falseness of the saying, "Whosoever therefore has incurred the guilt of treason, has forfeited, like you, his baptism."  For if he has forfeited it, let   him return and receive it again; but if he returns and does not receive it, it is clear that he had not forfeited it.  Again, if the reason why it was said to the apostles, "Now are ye clean," and "My peace I give unto you," was that the traitor had already left the room, then was not that supper of so great a sacrament clean and able to give peace, which He distributed to all before his going out?  And if you venture to say this with your eyes closed against the truth, what can we do save   exclaim the more, See how blindness comes in punishment of the madness of those who wish to be, as the apostle says, "teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm?" <a name="fr_2043"></a><a href="#fn_2043"><font size="1">2044</font></a>
   And yet, unless blindness came in the way of their pertinacity, it was not a very difficult matter that you should understand and see that the Lord did not say in the presence of Judas, Ye are not yet clean, but "Now are ye clean."  He added, however, "But not all," because there was one there who was not clean; yet if he had been polluting the others by his presence, it would not have been declared to them, "Now are ye clean," but, as I said before, Ye are not yet   clean.  But, after Judas had gone out, He said to them, "Now are ye clean," and did not add the words, But not all, because he had now departed in whose presence indeed, as had been said to them, they were already clean, but not all, because there was one there unclean.  Wherefore in these words the Lord rather declared that in the one company of men receiving the same sacraments, the uncleanness of some members cannot hurt the clean.  Certainly, if you think that there are among us men like   Judas, you might apply to us the words, "Ye are clean, but not all."  But this is not what you say; but you say that because of the presence of some who are unclean, therefore we are all unclean.  This the Lord did not say to the disciples in the presence of Judas, and therefore whoever says this has not learned from the good Master what He says.</p>
