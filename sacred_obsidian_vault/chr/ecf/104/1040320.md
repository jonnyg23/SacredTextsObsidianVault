 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.vi.xxii-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.vi.xxii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 22.—</span>30.  That the place of baptism is sometimes supplied by martyrdom is supported by an argument by no means trivial, which the blessed Cyprian adduces <a name="fr_1458"></a><a href="#fn_1458"><font size="1">1459</font></a>
  from the thief, to whom, though he was not baptized, it was yet said, "To-day shall thou be with me in Paradise." <a name="fr_1459"></a><a href="#fn_1459"><font size="1">1460</font></a>
   On considering which, again and again, I find that not only martyrdom for the sake of Christ may supply what was wanting of baptism, but also faith and conversion of heart, if recourse may not be had to the celebration of the mystery of baptism for want of time. <a name="fr_1460"></a><a href="#fn_1460"><font size="1">1461</font></a>
   For neither was that thief crucified for the name of Christ, but as the reward of his own deeds; nor did he suffer because he believed, but he believed while suffering.  It was shown, therefore, in the case of that thief, how great is the power, even without the visible sacrament of baptism, of what the apostle says, "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." <a name="fr_1461"></a><a href="#fn_1461"><font size="1">1462</font></a>
   But the want is supplied invisibly only when the administration of baptism is prevented, not by contempt for religion, but by the necessity of the moment.  For much more in the case of Cornelius and his friends, than in the case of that robber, might it seem superfluous that they should also be baptized with water, seeing that in them the gift of the Holy Spirit, which, according to the testi<a name="page_461"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 461</font></a> <a name="v.iv.vi.xxii-Page_461"></a>mony of holy Scripture, was received by other men only   after baptism, had made itself manifest by every unmistakable sign appropriate to those times when they spoke with tongues.  Yet they were baptized, and for this action we have the authority of an apostle as the warrant.  So far ought all of us to be from being induced by any imperfection in the inner man, if it so happen that before baptism a person has advanced, through the workings of a pious heart, to spiritual understanding, to despise a sacrament which is applied to the body by the hands   of the minister, but which is Gods own means for working spiritually a mans dedication to Himself.  Nor do I conceive that the function of baptizing was assigned to John, so that it should be called Johns baptism, for any other reason except that the Lord Himself, who had appointed it, in not disdaining to receive the baptism of His servant, <a name="fr_1462"></a><a href="#fn_1462"><font size="1">1463</font></a>
  might consecrate the path of humility, and show most plainly by such an action how high a value was to be placed on His own baptism, with which He Himself was afterwards to baptize.  For He saw, like an excellent physician of eternal salvation, that overweening pride would be found in some, who, having made such progress in the understanding of the truth and in uprightness of character that they would not hesitate to place themselves, both in life and knowledge, above many   that were baptized, would think it was unnecessary for them to be baptized, since they felt that they had attained a frame of mind to which many that were baptized were still only endeavoring to raise themselves.</p>
