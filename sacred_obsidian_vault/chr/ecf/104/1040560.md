 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.lxxiii-p3"></a>162.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxxiii-p3.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  Tell me whether you have said anything which may not equally be said against you in turn by any slanderous and evil-speaking tongue.  But from what has been said by me before, any one who wishes may find out that these things may be said against you, not by way of empty abuse, but with the support of truthful testimony.  As, however, the opportunity is presented to us we must not pass this by.  There is no doubt   that to the ancient people of God circumcision stood in the place of baptism.  I ask, therefore, putting the case that the Pharisees against whom those words you quote are spoken, had made some proselyte, who, if he were to imitate them, would, as it is said, become twofold more the child of hell than themselves, supposing that he were to be converted, and desire to imitate Simeon, or Zacharias, or Nathanael, would it be necessary that he should be circumcised again by them?  And if it is   absurd to put this case why, although in empty fashion and with empty sounds you compare us to men like this, do you nevertheless baptize after us?  But if you are really men like this, how much better and how much more in accordance with truth do we act in not baptizing after you, as neither was it right that those whom I have mentioned should be circumcised after the worst of Pharisees!  Furthermore, when such men sit in the seat of Moses, for which the Lord preserved its due honor, why do   you blaspheme the apostolic chair on account of men whom, justly or unjustly, you compare with these?</p>
