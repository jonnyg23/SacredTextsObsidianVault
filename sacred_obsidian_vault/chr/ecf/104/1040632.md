 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.v.v.xxxv-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.v.xxxv-p1.1"></a>Chapter 35.—</span>Was the water administered by this man not lying? or is the oil of the fornicator not the oil of the sinner? or must we hold what the Catholic Church says, and what is true, that that water and that oil are not his by whom they were administered, but His whose name was then invoked?  Why did they who were baptized by that hypocrite, whose sins were concealed, fail to try the spirit, to prove that it was not of God?  For the   Holy Spirit of discipline was even then fleeing from the hypocrite. <a name="fr_2398"></a><a href="#fn_2398"><font size="1">2399</font></a>
   Was it that He was fleeing from him, but at the same time not deserting His sacraments, though ministered by him?  Lastly, since you do not deny that those men have been already cleansed, whom you take no care to have cleansed now that he is condemned, see whether, after shedding over the subject so many mists in so many different ways, Petilianus, after all, in any place gives any answer to the question by what means these men have been cleansed, if what we look for to   cleanse the conscience of the recipient is the conscience of one that gives in holiness, such as the man who was secretly unclean could not have had.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.v.xxxv-p3"></a>41.  Making then, no answer to this which is so urgently asked of him, and, in the next place, even seeking for himself a latitude of speech, he says, "since both prophets and apostles have been cautious enough to fear these things, with what face do you say that the baptism of the sinner is holy to those who believe with a good conscience?"  Just as though I or any Catholic maintained that that baptism was of the sinner which is administered or received with a sinner   to officiate, instead of being His in virtue of belief in whose name the candidate is baptized!  Then he goes off to an invective against the traitor Judas, saying against him whatever he can, quoting the testimony of the prophets uttered concerning him so long a time before, as though he would steep the Church of Christ dispersed throughout the world, whose cause is involved in this discussion, in the impiety of the traitor Judas,—not considering what this very thing should have recalled to   his mind, that we ought no more to doubt that that is the Church of Christ which is spread abroad throughout the world, since this was prophesied with truth so many years before, than we ought to doubt that it was necessary that Christ should be betrayed by one of His disciples, because this was prophesied in like manner.</p>
