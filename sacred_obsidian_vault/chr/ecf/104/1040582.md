 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xcv-p2"></a>217.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xcv-p2.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  We neither drag you to us against your will, nor do we kill our foes; but whatever we do in our dealings with you, though we may do it contrary to your inclination, yet we do it from our love to you, that you may voluntarily correct yourselves, and live an amended life.  For no one lives against his will; and yet a boy, in order to learn this lesson of his own free will, <a name="fr_2260"></a><a href="#fn_2260"><font size="1">2261</font></a>
  is beaten contrary to his inclination, and that often by the very man that is most dear to him.  And this, indeed, is what the kings would desire to say to you if they were to strike you, for to this end their power has been ordained of God.  But you cry out even when they are not striking you.</p>
