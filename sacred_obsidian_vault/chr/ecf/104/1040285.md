   He indeed chose to say error, not custom; but in saying "for even Peter, who at the first circumcised, afterwards gave way to Paul when he declared the truth," he shows plainly enough that there was a custom also on the subject of baptism at variance with his views.  At the same time, also, he warns us that it was not impossible that Cyprian might have held an opinion about baptism at variance with that required by the truth, as held by the Church both before and after   him, if even Peter could hold a view at variance with the truth as taught us by the Apostle Paul. <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1275"><font size="1">1276</font></a>
