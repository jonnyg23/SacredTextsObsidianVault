 </p><p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.xxxix-p1"></a>  86. And a certain general, Balacius by name, persecuted us Christians bitterly on account of his regard for the Arians—that name of ill-omen. And as his ruthlessness was so great that he beat virgins, and stripped and scourged monks, Antony at this time wrote a letter as follows, and sent it to him. I see wrath coming upon thee, wherefore cease to persecute the Christians, lest haply wrath catch hold of thee, for even now it is on the point of coming upon thee <a name="fr_1138"></a><a href="#fn_1138"><font size="1">1139</font></a>
 . But Balacius laughed and threw the letter on the ground, and spit on it, and insulted the bearers, bidding them tell this to Antony: Since thou takest thought for the monks, soon I will come after thee also. And five days had not passed before wrath came upon him. For Balacius and Nestorius, the Prefect of Egypt <a name="fr_1139"></a><a href="#fn_1139"><font size="1">1140</font></a>
 , went forth to the first halting-place from Alexandria, which is called Chæreu, and both were on horseback, and the horses belonged to Balacius, and were the quietest of all his stable. But they had not gone far towards the place when the horses began to frisk with one another as they are wont to do; and suddenly the quieter, on which Nestorius sat <a name="fr_1140"></a><a href="#fn_1140"><font size="1">1141</font></a>
 , with a bite dismounted Balacius, and attacked him, and tore his thigh so badly with its teeth that he was borne straight back to the city, and in three days died. And all wondered because what Antony had foretold had been so speedily fulfilled.</p>
