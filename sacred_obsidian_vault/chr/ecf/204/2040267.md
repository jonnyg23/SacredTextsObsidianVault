 <p class="c11"><a name="xviii.ii.ii-p2"></a>But as to the slanderous charge which has been preferred against me before your Grace, respecting correspondence with the most pious Augustus, your brother Constans <a name="fr_1286"></a><a href="#fn_1286"><font size="1">1287</font></a>
 , of blessed and everlasting memory (for my enemies report this of me, and have ventured to assert it in writing), the former events <a name="fr_1287"></a><a href="#fn_1287"><font size="1">1288</font></a>
  are sufficient to prove this also to be untrue. Had it been alleged by another set of persons, the matter would indeed have been a fit subject of enquiry, but it would have required strong evidence, and open proof in presence of both parties: but when the same persons who invented the former charge, are the authors also of this, is it not reasonable to conclude from the issue of the one, the falsehood of the other? For this cause they again conferred together in private, thinking to be able to deceive your Piety before I was aware. But in this they failed: you would not listen to them as they desired, but patiently gave me an opportunity to make my defence. And, in that you were not immediately moved to demand vengeance, you acted only as was righteous in a Prince, whose duty it is to wait for the defence of the injured party. Which if you will vouchsafe to hear, I am confident that in this matter also you will condemn those reckless men, who have no fear of that God, who has commanded us not to speak falsely before the king <a name="fr_1288"></a><a href="#fn_1288"><font size="1">1289</font></a>
