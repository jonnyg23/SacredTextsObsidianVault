 </p><p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.xxxi-p1"></a>  69. And once also the Arians having lyingly asserted that Antonys opinions were the same as theirs, he was displeased and wroth against them. Then being summoned by the bishops and all the brethren, he descended from the mountain, and having entered Alexandria <a name="fr_1115"></a><a href="#fn_1115"><font size="1">1116</font></a>
 , he denounced the Arians, saying that their heresy was the last of all and a forerunner of Antichrist. And he taught the people that the Son of God was not a created being, neither had He come into being from non-existence, but that He was the Eternal Word and Wisdom of the Essence of the Father. And therefore it was impious to say, there was a time when He was not, for the Word was always co-existent with the Father. Wherefore have no fellowship with the most impious Arians. For there is no communion between light and darkness <a name="fr_1116"></a><a href="#fn_1116"><font size="1">1117</font></a>
 . For you are good Christians, but they, when they say that the Son of the Father, the Word of God, is a created being, differ in nought from the heathen, since they worship that which is created, rather than God the creator <a name="fr_1117"></a><a href="#fn_1117"><font size="1">1118</font></a>
 . But believe ye that the Creation itself is angry with them because they number the Creator, the Lord of all, by whom all things came into being, with those things which were originated.</p>
