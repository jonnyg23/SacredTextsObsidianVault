 <p class="c11"><a name="xix.ii.xii-p2"></a>Wherefore also the Word Himself, being made man for our sakes, condescended to hide Himself when He was sought after, as we do: and also when He was persecuted, to flee and avoid the designs of His enemies. For it became Him, as by hunger and thirst and suffering, so also by hiding Himself and fleeing, to shew that He had taken our flesh, and was made man. Thus at the very first, as soon as He became man, when He was a little child, He Himself by His Angel commanded Joseph, Arise, and take the young Child and His Mother, and flee into Egypt; for Herod will seek the young Childs life <a name="fr_1435"></a><a href="#fn_1435"><font size="1">1436</font></a>
 . And when Herod was dead, we find Him withdrawing to Nazareth by reason of Archelaus his son. And when afterwards He was shewing Himself to be God, and made whole the withered hand, the Pharisees went out, and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him; but when Jesus knew it, He withdrew Himself from thence <a name="fr_1436"></a><a href="#fn_1436"><font size="1">1437</font></a>
 . So also when He raised Lazarus from the dead, from that day forth, says the Scripture, they took counsel for to put Him to death. Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence into the country near to the wilderness <a name="fr_1437"></a><a href="#fn_1437"><font size="1">1438</font></a>
 . Again, when our Saviour said, Before Abraham was, I am, the Jews took up stones to cast at Him; but Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the temple <a name="fr_1438"></a><a href="#fn_1438"><font size="1">1439</font></a>
 . And going through the midst of them, He went His way, and so passed by <a name="fr_1439"></a><a href="#fn_1439"><font size="1">1440</font></a>
 .</p>
