 <p class="c11"><a name="xix.ii.v-p2"></a>Of the great Hosius <a name="fr_1408"></a><a href="#fn_1408"><font size="1">1409</font></a>
 , who answers to his name, that confessor of a happy old age, it is superfluous for me to speak, for I suppose it is known unto all men that they caused him also to be banished; for he is not an obscure person, but of all men the most illustrious, and more than this. When was there a Council held, in which he did not take the lead <a name="fr_1409"></a><a href="#fn_1409"><font size="1">1410</font></a>
 , and by right counsel convince every one? Where is there a Church that does not possess some glorious monuments of his patronage? Who has ever come to him in sorrow, and has not gone away rejoicing? What needy person ever asked his aid, and did not obtain what he desired? And yet even on this man they made their assault, because knowing the calumnies which they invent in behalf of their iniquity, he would not subscribe to their designs against us. And if afterwards, upon the repeated stripes above measure that were inflicted upon him, and the conspiracies that were formed against his kinsfolk, he yielded <a name="fr_1410"></a><a href="#fn_1410"><font size="1">1411</font></a>
  to them for a time <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1411"><font size="1">1412</font></a>
 , as being old and infirm in body, yet at least their wickedness is shewn even in this circumstance; so zealously did they endeavour by all means to prove that they were not truly Christians.</p>
