 </p><p class="c41"><a name="xix.ii.xiii-p1"></a>  13. <i>Example of Our Lord.</i></p>  
 <p class="c11"><a name="xix.ii.xiii-p2"></a>When they see these things, or rather even hear of them, for see they do not, will they not desire, as it is written, to become fuel of fire <a name="fr_1440"></a><a href="#fn_1440"><font size="1">1441</font></a>
 , because their counsels and their words are contrary to what the Lord both did and taught? Also when John was martyred, and his disciples buried his body, when Jesus heard of it, He departed thence by ship into a desert place apart <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1441"><font size="1">1442</font></a>
 . Thus the Lord acted, and thus He taught. Would that these men were even now ashamed of their conduct, and confined their rashness to man, nor proceeded to such extreme madness as even to charge our Saviour with cowardice! for it is against Him that they now utter their blasphemies. But no one will endure such madness; nay it will be seen that they do not understand the Gospels. The cause must be a reasonable and just one, which the Evangelists represent as weighing with our Saviour to withdraw and to flee; and we ought therefore to assign the same for the conduct of all the Saints. (For whatever is written concerning our Saviour in His human nature, ought to be considered as applying to the whole race of mankind <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1443</font></a>
 ; because He took our body, and exhibited in Himself human infirmity.) Now of this cause John has written thus, They sought to take Him: but no man laid hands on Him, because His hour was not yet come <a name="fr_1443"></a><a href="#fn_1443"><font size="1">1444</font></a>
 . And before it came, He Himself said to His Mother, Mine hour is not yet come <a name="fr_1444"></a><a href="#fn_1444"><font size="1">1445</font></a>
 : and to them who were called His brethren, My time is not yet come <a name="fr_1445"></a><a href="#fn_1445"><font size="1">1446</font></a>
 . And again, when His time was come, He said to the disciples, Sleep on now, and take your rest: for behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners <a name="fr_1446"></a><a href="#fn_1446"><font size="1">1447</font></a>
 .</p>
