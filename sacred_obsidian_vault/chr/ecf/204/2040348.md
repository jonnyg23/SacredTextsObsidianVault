 </p><p class="c41"><a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-p1"></a>  <span class="c10"><a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-p1.1"></a>Chapter III</span>.—<span class="c10"><a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-p1.2"></a>The Importance of the Subject</span>. <i>The Arians affect Scripture language, but their doctrine new, as well as unscriptural. Statement of the Catholic doctrine, that the Son is proper to the Fathers substance, and eternal. Restatement of Arianism in contrast, that He is a creature with a beginning: the controversy comes to this issue, whether one whom we are to believe in as God, can be so in name only, and is merely a creature. What pretence then for being indifferent in the controversy? The Arians rely on state patronage, and dare not avow their tenets.</i></p>  
 <p class="c11"><a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-p2"></a>8. If then the use of certain phrases of divine Scripture changes, in their opinion, the blasphemy of the Thalia into reverent language, of course they ought also to deny Christ with the present Jews, when they see how they study the Law and the Prophets; perhaps too they will deny the Law <a name="fr_1852"></a><a href="#fn_1852"><font size="1">1853</font></a>
  and the Prophets like Manichees <a name="fr_1853"></a><a href="#fn_1853"><font size="1">1854</font></a>
 , because the latter read some portions of the Gospels. If such bewilderment and empty speaking be from ignorance, Scripture will teach them, that the devil, the author of heresies, because of the ill savour which attaches to evil, borrows Scripture language, as a cloak wherewith to sow the ground with his own poison also, and to seduce the simple. Thus he deceived Eve; thus he framed former heresies; thus he persuaded Arius at this time to make a show of speaking against those former ones, that he might introduce his own without observation. And yet, after all, the man of craft did not escape. For being irreligious towards the Word of God, he lost his all at once <a name="fr_1854"></a><a href="#fn_1854"><font size="1">1855</font></a>
 , and betrayed to all men his ignorance of other heresies too <a name="fr_1855"></a><a href="#fn_1855"><font size="1">1856</font></a>
 ; and having not a particle of truth in his belief, does but pretend to it. For how can he speak truth concerning the Father, who denies the Son, that reveals concerning Him? or how can he be orthodox concerning the Spirit, while he speaks profanely of the Word that supplies the Spirit? and who will trust him concerning the Resurrection, denying, as he does, Christ for us the first-begotten from the dead? and how shall he not err in respect to His incarnate presence, who is simply ignorant of the Sons genuine and true generation from the Father? For thus, the former Jews also, denying the Word, and saying, We have no king but Cæsar <a name="fr_1856"></a><a href="#fn_1856"><font size="1">1857</font></a>
 , were forthwith stripped of all they had, and forfeited the light of the Lamp, the odour of ointment, knowledge of prophecy, and the Truth itself; till now they understand nothing, but are walking as in darkness. For who was ever yet a hearer of such a doctrine <a name="fr_1857"></a><a href="#fn_1857"><font size="1">1858</font></a>
 ? or whence or from whom did the abettors and hirelings <a name="fr_1858"></a><a href="#fn_1858"><font size="1">1859</font></a>
  of the heresy gain it? who thus expounded to them when they were at school <a name="fr_1859"></a><a href="#fn_1859"><font size="1">1860</font></a>
 ? who told them, Abandon the worship of the creation, and then draw near and worship a creature and a work <a name="fr_1860"></a><a href="#fn_1860"><font size="1">1861</font></a>
 ? But if they themselves own that they have heard it now for the first time, how can they deny that this heresy is foreign, and not from our fathers <a name="fr_1861"></a><a href="#fn_1861"><font size="1">1862</font></a>
 ? But what is not from our fathers, but has come to light in this day, how can it be but that of which the blessed Paul <a name="fr_1862"></a><a href="#fn_1862"><font size="1">1863</font></a>
  has foretold, that in the latter times some shall depart from the sound faith, <a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a> <a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-Page_311"></a>giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, in the hypocrisy of liars; cauterized in their own conscience, and turning from the truth <a name="fr_1863"></a><a href="#fn_1863"><font size="1">1864</font></a>
 ?</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-p15"></a>9. For, behold, we take divine Scripture, and thence discourse with freedom of the religious Faith, and set it up as a light upon its candlestick, saying:—Very Son of the Father, natural and genuine, proper to His essence, Wisdom Only-begotten, and Very and Only Word of God is He; not a creature or work, but an offspring proper to the Fathers essence. Wherefore He is very God, existing one <a name="fr_1864"></a><a href="#fn_1864"><font size="1">1865</font></a>
  in essence with the very Father; while other beings, to whom He said, I said ye are Gods <a name="fr_1865"></a><a href="#fn_1865"><font size="1">1866</font></a>
 , had this grace from the Father, only by participation <a name="fr_1866"></a><a href="#fn_1866"><font size="1">1867</font></a>
  of the Word, through the Spirit. For He is the expression of the Fathers Person, and Light from Light, and Power, and very Image of the Fathers essence. For this too the Lord has said, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father <a name="fr_1867"></a><a href="#fn_1867"><font size="1">1868</font></a>
 . And He ever was and is and never was not. For the Father being everlasting, His Word and His Wisdom must be everlasting <a name="fr_1868"></a><a href="#fn_1868"><font size="1">1869</font></a>
 . On the other hand, what have these persons to shew us from the infamous Thalia? Or, first of all, let them read it themselves, and copy the tone of the writer; at least the mockery which they will encounter from others may instruct them how low they have fallen; and then let them proceed to explain themselves. For what can they say from it, but that God was not always a Father, but became so afterwards; the Son was not always, for He was not before His generation; He is not from the Father, but He, as others, has come into subsistence out of nothing; He is not proper to the Fathers essence, for He is a creature and work? And Christ is not very God, but He, as others, was made God by participation; the Son has not exact knowledge of the Father, nor does the Word see the Father perfectly; and neither exactly understands nor knows the Father. He is not the very and only Word of the Father, but is in name only called Word and Wisdom, and is called by grace Son and Power. He is not unalterable, as the Father is, but alterable in nature, as the creatures, and He comes short of apprehending the perfect knowledge of the Father. Wonderful this heresy, not plausible even, but making speculations against Him that is, that He be not, and everywhere putting forward blasphemy for reverent language! Were any one, after inquiring into both sides, to be asked, whether of the two he would follow in faith, or whether of the two spoke fitly of God,—or rather let them say themselves, these abettors of irreligion, what, if a man be asked concerning God (for the Word was God), it were fit to answer <a name="fr_1869"></a><a href="#fn_1869"><font size="1">1870</font></a>
 . For from this one question the whole case on both sides may be determined, what is fitting to say,—He was, or He was not; always, or before His birth; eternal, or from this and from then; true, or by adoption, and from participation and in idea <a name="fr_1870"></a><a href="#fn_1870"><font size="1">1871</font></a>
 ; to call Him one of things originated, or to unite Him to the Father; to consider Him unlike the Father in essence, or like and proper to Him; a creature, or Him through whom the creatures were originated; that He is the Fathers Word, or that there is another word beside Him, and that by this other He was originated, and by another wisdom; and that He is only named Wisdom and Word, and is become a partaker of this wisdom, and second to it?</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-p23"></a>10. Which of the two theologies sets forth our Lord Jesus Christ as God and Son of the Father, this which you vomited forth, or that which we have spoken and maintain from the Scriptures? If the Saviour be not God, nor Word, nor Son, you shall have leave to say what you will, and so shall the Gentiles, and the present Jews. But if He be Word of the Father and true Son, and God from God, and over all blessed for ever <a name="fr_1871"></a><a href="#fn_1871"><font size="1">1872</font></a>
 , is it not becoming to obliterate and blot out those other phrases and that Arian Thalia, as but a pattern of evil, a store of all irreligion, into which, whoso falls, knoweth not that giants perish with her, and reacheth the depths of Hades <a name="fr_1872"></a><a href="#fn_1872"><font size="1">1873</font></a>
 ? This they know themselves, and in their craft they conceal it, not having the courage to speak out, but uttering something else <a name="fr_1873"></a><a href="#fn_1873"><font size="1">1874</font></a>
 . For if they speak, a condemnation will follow; and if they be suspected, proofs from Scripture will be cast <a name="fr_1874"></a><a href="#fn_1874"><font size="1">1875</font></a>
  at them from every side. Wherefore, in their craft, as children of this world, after feeding their <a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a> <a name="xxi.ii.i.iii-Page_312"></a>so-called lamp from the wild olive, and fearing lest it should soon be quenched (for it is said, the light of the wicked shall be put out <a name="fr_1875"></a><a href="#fn_1875"><font size="1">1876</font></a>
 ,) they hide it under the bushel <a name="fr_1876"></a><a href="#fn_1876"><font size="1">1877</font></a>
  of their hypocrisy, and make a different profession, and boast of patronage of friends and authority of Constantius, that what with their hypocrisy and their professions, those who come to them may be kept from seeing how foul their heresy is. Is it not detestable even in this, that it dares not speak out, but is kept hid by its own friends, and fostered as serpents are? for from what sources have they got together these words? or from whom have they received what they venture to say <a name="fr_1877"></a><a href="#fn_1877"><font size="1">1878</font></a>
 ? Not any one man can they specify who has supplied it. For who is there in all mankind, Greek or Barbarian, who ventures to rank among creatures One whom he confesses the while to be God and says, that He was not till He was made? or who is there, who to the God in whom he has put faith, refuses to give credit, when He says, This is My beloved Son <a name="fr_1878"></a><a href="#fn_1878"><font size="1">1879</font></a>
 , on the pretence that He is not a Son, but a creature? rather, such madness would rouse an universal indignation. Nor does Scripture afford them any pretext; for it has been often shewn, and it shall be shewn now, that their doctrine is alien to the divine oracles. Therefore, since all that remains is to say that from the devil came their mania (for of such opinions he alone is sower <a name="fr_1879"></a><a href="#fn_1879"><font size="1">1880</font></a>
 ), proceed we to resist him—for with him is our real conflict, and they are but instruments;—that, the Lord aiding us, and the enemy, as he is wont, being overcome with arguments, they may be put to shame, when they see him without resource who sowed this heresy in them, and may learn, though late, that, as being Arians, they are not Christians.</p>
