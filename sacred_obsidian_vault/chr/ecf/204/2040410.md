 —from the Festal Letters of Pope Athanasius.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p5"></a>The Festal Letters of Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, which he sent year by year, to the several cities and all the provinces subject to him; that is, from Pentapolis, and on to Libya, Ammoniaca, the greater and the lesser Oasis, Egypt, and Augustamnica, with the Heptanomis of <a name="fr_3824"></a><a href="#fn_3824"><font size="1">3825</font></a>
  the upper and middle Thebais; [commencing] from the 44th <a name="fr_3825"></a><a href="#fn_3825"><font size="1">3826</font></a>
  year of the Diocletian Era, in which the Paschal Festival was on xvi <a name="fr_3826"></a><a href="#fn_3826"><font size="1">3827</font></a>
  Pharmuthi; xviii Kal. Mai; xviii Moon; when Alexander, his predecessor, having departed this life on xxii Pharmuthi <a name="fr_3827"></a><a href="#fn_3827"><font size="1">3828</font></a>
 , he [Athan.] succeeded him after the Paschal festival on xiv Pauni, Indict. i, Januarius and Justus being Consuls, the governor Zenius of Italy being the Præfect of Egypt, Epact xxv; Gods, i.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p10"></a>I. (Aug. 29, 328, to Aug. 28, <span class="c10"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p10.1"></a>a.d.</span> 329.) In this year, Easter-day was on xi Pharmuthi; viii. Id. Ap.; xxii Moon; Coss. Constantinus Aug. viii, Constantinus Cæs. IV; the same governor Zenius being Præfect of Egypt; Indict. ii; Epact vi; Gods, ii. This was the first Letter he [Athan.] sent; for he was ordained Bishop in the preceding year after the Paschal feast, Alexander, as is known, having despatched one for that year, before he was released from life. This was in the 45th of the Diocletian era.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p11"></a>II. (329–330.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xiii Kal. Mai; xv Moon; Coss. Gallicianus, Symmachus; the governor Magninianus the Cappadocian being Præfect of Egypt; Indict. iii; Epact xvii; Gods, iii. In this year he went through the Thebais.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p12"></a>III. (330–331.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvi Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Coss. Annius Bassus, Ablavius; the governor Hyginus <a name="fr_3828"></a><a href="#fn_3828"><font size="1">3829</font></a>
  of Italy, Præfect of Egypt; Epact xxviii; Indict. iv. He sent this Letter while journeying on his return from the Imperial Court. For in this year he went to the Imperial Court to the Emperor Constantine the Great, having been summoned before him, on account of an accusation his enemies made, that he had been appointed when too young. He appeared, was thought worthy of favour and honour, and returned <a name="fr_3829"></a><a href="#fn_3829"><font size="1">3830</font></a>
  when the fast was half finished.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p15"></a>IV. (331–332.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvii <a name="fr_3830"></a><a href="#fn_3830"><font size="1">3831</font></a>
  Pharmuthi; xx Moon; iv Non. Apr.; Epact ix; Gods, vi; Coss. Pacatianus, Hilarianus; the same governor Hyginus, Præfect of Egypt; Indict. v. In this year he went through Pentapolis, and was in Ammoniaca.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p17"></a>V. (332–333.) In this year, Easter-day was on xx Pharmuthi; xv Moon; xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xx; Gods, vii; Coss. Dalmatius, Zenophilus; the governor Paternus <a name="fr_3831"></a><a href="#fn_3831"><font size="1">3832</font></a>
 , Præfect of Egypt; Indict. vi.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p19"></a>VI. (333–334.) In this year, Easter-day was on xii Pharmuthi; xvii Moon; vii Id. Apr.; Indict. vii; Epact i; Gods, i; Coss. Optatus, Paulinus; the same governor Paternus <a name="fr_3832"></a><a href="#fn_3832"><font size="1">3833</font></a>
  Præfect of Egypt. In this year he went through the lower country. In it he was summoned to a Synod, his enemies having previously devised mischief against him in Cæsarea of Palestine; but becoming aware of the conspiracy, he excused himself from attending.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p21"></a>VII. (334–335.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiv <a name="fr_3833"></a><a href="#fn_3833"><font size="1">3834</font></a>
  Pharmuthi; xx Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Indict. viii; Epact xii; Gods, ii; Coss. Constantius <a name="fr_3834"></a><a href="#fn_3834"><font size="1">3835</font></a>
 , Albinus; the same governor Paternus, Præfect of Egypt.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p24"></a>VIII. (335–336.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiii Pharmuthi, xx Moon; xiv Kal. Mai; Indict. ix; Epact xxiii; Gods, iv; Coss. Nepotianus, Facundus; the governor Philagrius, the Cappadocian, Præfect of Egypt. In this year he went to that Synod of his enemies which was assembled at Tyre. Now he journeyed from this place on xvii Epiphi <a name="fr_3835"></a><a href="#fn_3835"><font size="1">3836</font></a>
 , but when a discovery was made of the plot against him, he removed thence and fled in an open boat to Constantinople. Arriving there on ii Athyr <a name="fr_3836"></a><a href="#fn_3836"><font size="1">3837</font></a>
 , after eight days he presented himself before the Emperor Constantine, and spoke plainly. But his enemies, by various secret devices, influenced the Emperor, who suddenly condemned him to exile, and he set out on the tenth of Athyr <a name="fr_3837"></a><a href="#fn_3837"><font size="1">3838</font></a>
  to Gaul, to Constans Cæsar, the son of Augustus. On this account he wrote no Festal Letter.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p28"></a>IX. (336–7.) In this year, Easter-day was on viii Pharmuthi; xvi Moon; iv <a name="fr_3838"></a><a href="#fn_3838"><font size="1">3839</font></a>
  Non. Ap.; Indict. x; Epact iv; Gods, v; Coss. Felicianus, Titianus; the governor Philagrius, the Cappadocian, Præfect of Egypt. He was in Treviri of Gaul, and on this account was unable to write a Festal Letter.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p30"></a>X. (337–8.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxx Phamenoth; vii Kal. Ap.; xix <a name="fr_3839"></a><a href="#fn_3839"><font size="1">3840</font></a>
  Moon, Indict. xi; Epact xv; Gods, vi; Coss. Ursus, Polemius; the governor Theodorus <a name="fr_3840"></a><a href="#fn_3840"><font size="1">3841</font></a>
 , of Heliopolis, Præfect of Egypt. In this year, Constantine having died on xxvii Pachon <a name="fr_3841"></a><a href="#fn_3841"><font size="1">3842</font></a>
 , Athanasius, now liberated, returned from Gaul triumphantly on xxvii <a name="fr_3842"></a><a href="#fn_3842"><font size="1">3843</font></a>
  Athyr. In this year, too, there were many events. Antony, the great leader, came to Alexandria, and though he remained there only two days, shewed himself wonderful in many things, and healed many. He went away on the third of Messori. <a name="fr_3843"></a><a href="#fn_3843"><font size="1">3844</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p36"></a>XI. (338–9.) In this year, Easter-day was on xx Pharmuthi; xx Moon; xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xxvi; Gods, vii; Indict. xii; Coss. Constantius II, Constans I <a name="fr_3844"></a><a href="#fn_3844"><font size="1">3845</font></a>
 ; the governor Philagrius, the Cappadocian, Præfect of Egypt. In this year, again, there were many tumults. On the xxii Phamenoth <a name="fr_3845"></a><a href="#fn_3845"><font size="1">3846</font></a>
  he was pursued in the night, and the next day he fled from the Church of Theonas, after he had baptized many. Then, four days after, Gregorius the Cappadocian entered the city as Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p39"></a>XII. (339–340.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiv <a name="fr_3846"></a><a href="#fn_3846"><font size="1">3847</font></a>
  Pharmuthi; xv Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Epact vii; Gods, ii; Indict. xiii; Coss. Acyndinus, Proclus; the same governor Philagrius, Præfect of Egypt. Gregorius continued his acts of violence, and therefore [Ath.] wrote no Festal Letter. The Arians proclaimed [Easter] on xxvii Phamenoth, and were much ridiculed on account of this error. Then altering it in the middle of the fast, they kept it with us on iv <a name="fr_3847"></a><a href="#fn_3847"><font size="1">3848</font></a>
  Pharmuthi, as above. He [Athanasius] gave notice of it to the presbyters of Alexandria in a short note, not being able to send a letter as usual, on account of his flight and the treachery.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p42"></a>XIII. (340–341.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xvi Moon; xiii. Kal. Mai; Epact xviii; <a name="page_504"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 504</font></a> <a name="xxv.iii.ii-Page_504"></a>Gods, iii; Indict. xiv; Coss. Marcellinus, Probinus; the governor Longinus, of Nicæa, Præfect of Egypt. Augustamnica was separated. <a name="fr_3848"></a><a href="#fn_3848"><font size="1">3849</font></a>
  On account of Gregorius continuing in the city, and exercising violence, although this illness commenced, the Pope did not write a Festal Letter even this time <a name="fr_3849"></a><a href="#fn_3849"><font size="1">3850</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p45"></a>XIV. (341–2.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvi Pharmuthi; xx <a name="fr_3850"></a><a href="#fn_3850"><font size="1">3851</font></a>
  Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Epact xxix; Gods, iv; Indict. xv; Coss. Constantius III, Constans II; the governor Longinus of Nicæa, Præfect of Egypt. Because Gregorius was in the city, [though] severely ill, the Pope was unable to send [any Letter].</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p47"></a>XV. (342–3.) In this year, Easter-day was on i Pharmuthi; xv Moon; vi Kal. Ap.; Epact xi; Gods, v; Indict. i; Coss. Placidus, Romulus; the same governor Longinus, of Nicæa, Præfect of Egypt. In this year the Synod of Sardica was held <a name="fr_3851"></a><a href="#fn_3851"><font size="1">3852</font></a>
 ; and when the Arians had arrived, they returned to Philippopolis, for Philagrius gave them this advice there. In truth, they were blamed everywhere, and were even anathematised by the Church of Rome, and having written a recantation to Pope Athanasius, Ursacius and Valens were put to shame. There was an agreement made at Sardica respecting Easter, and a decree was issued to be binding for fifty years, which the Romans and Alexandrians everywhere announced in the usual manner. Again he [Athan.] wrote a Festal Letter.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p49"></a>XVI. (343–4.) In this year, Easter-day was on xx Pharmuthi; xix Moon; xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xxi; Gods, vi[i], Coss. Leontius, Sallustius; the governor Palladius, of Italy, Præfect of Egypt; Indict. ii. Being at Naissus on his return from the Synod, he there celebrated Easter <a name="fr_3852"></a><a href="#fn_3852"><font size="1">3853</font></a>
 . Of this Easter-day he gave notice in few words to the presbyters of Alexandria, but he was unable to do so to the country.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p51"></a>XVII. (344–5.) In this year, Easter-day was on xii Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; vii. Id. Ap.; Epact ii; Gods, i; Indict. iii; Coss. Amantius, Albinus; the governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. Having travelled to Aquileia, he kept Easter there. Of this Easter-day, he gave notice in few words to the presbyters of Alexandria, but not to the country.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p52"></a>XVIII. (345–6.) In this year, Easter-day was on iv Pharmuthi; xxi <a name="fr_3853"></a><a href="#fn_3853"><font size="1">3854</font></a>
  Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Epact xiv; Gods, ii; Indict. iv; Coss. Constantius <a name="fr_3854"></a><a href="#fn_3854"><font size="1">3855</font></a>
  Aug. IV, Constans Aug. III; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. Gregorius having died on the second of Epiphi <a name="fr_3855"></a><a href="#fn_3855"><font size="1">3856</font></a>
 , he returned from Rome and Italy, and entered the city and the Church. Moreover he was thought worthy of a grand reception, for on the xxiv Paophi <a name="fr_3856"></a><a href="#fn_3856"><font size="1">3857</font></a>
 , the people and all those in authority met him a hundred miles distant, and he continued in honour. He had already sent the Festal Letter for this year, in few words, to the presbyters.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p57"></a>XIX. (346–7.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvii Pharmuthi xv. Moon; Prid. Id. Apr.; Epact xxv; Gods, iii; Indict. v; Coss. Rufinus, Eusebius; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. He wrote this Letter while residing here in Alexandria, giving notice of some things which he had not been able to do before.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p58"></a>XX. (347–8.) In this year, Easter-day was on vii Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; iii Non. Ap.; Epact vi; Gods, v <a name="fr_3857"></a><a href="#fn_3857"><font size="1">3858</font></a>
  Indict. vi; Coss. Philippus, Salia; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. This Letter also he sent while residing in Alexandria.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p60"></a>XXI. (348–9.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxx Phamenoth;…xix Moon,…vii Kal. Ap.; Epact xvii; Gods, vi; Indict. vii. But because the Romans refused, for they said they held a tradition from the Apostle Peter not to pass the twenty-sixth day of Pharmuthi, nor..the thirtieth of Phamenoth, xxi Moon,……………… <a name="fr_3858"></a><a href="#fn_3858"><font size="1">3859</font></a>
 , vii Kal. Ap.; Coss. Limenius, Catullinus; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. He sent this also while residing in Alexandria.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p62"></a>XXII. (349–50.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiii Pharmuthi; xix Moon, the second hour; vi Id. Ap.; Epact xxviii; Gods, vii; Indict. viii; Coss. Sergius, Nigrianus; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. In this year, Constans was slain by Magnentius, and Constantius held the empire alone; then he wrote to the Pope [Athan.], telling him to fear nothing because of the death of Constans, but to confide in him as he had done in Constans while living.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p63"></a>XXIII. (350–1.) In this year, Easter day was on v Pharmuthi; Moon xviii; Prid. Kal. Ap.; Epact ix; Gods, i; Indict. ix; the Consulship after that of Sergius and Nigrianus; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, again Præfect of Egypt.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p64"></a>XXIV. (351–2.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; xiii Kal. Mai, Epact xx; Gods, iii; Indict. x, Coss. Constantius Aug. V, Constantius Cæsar I; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, Præfect of Egypt. Gallus was proclaimed Cæsar <a name="fr_3859"></a><a href="#fn_3859"><font size="1">3860</font></a>
 , and his name changed into Constantius.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p66"></a>XXV. (352–3.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvi Pharmuthi; xxi Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Epact i; Gods, iv; Indict. xi; Coss. Constantius Aug. VI, Constantius Cæsar II; the governor Sebastianus of Thrace, præfect of Egypt. In this year, Serapion <a name="fr_3860"></a><a href="#fn_3860"><font size="1">3861</font></a>
 , Bishop of Thmuis, and Triadelphus of Nicion, and the presbyters Petrus and Astricius, with others, were sent to the emperor Constantius, through fear of mischief from the Arians. They returned, having effected nothing. In this year, Montanus, Silentiarius of the Palace, [was sent]…against [the] <a name="fr_3861"></a><a href="#fn_3861"><font size="1">3862</font></a>
  Bishop, but, a tumult having been excited, he retired, having failed to effect anything.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p69"></a>XXVI. (353–4.) In this year, Easter-day was on i <a name="fr_3862"></a><a href="#fn_3862"><font size="1">3863</font></a>
  Pharmuthi; xvii Moon; vi Kal. Ap.; Epact xii; Gods, v; Indict. xii; Coss. Constantius Aug. VII, Constantius Cæsar III.; the same governor Sebastianus of Thrace, Præfect of Egypt.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p71"></a>XXVII. (354–5.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxi Pharmuthi; xviii Moon; xvi Kal. Mai; Epact xxiii; Gods, vi; Indict. xiii; Coss. Arbetion, Lollianus; the governor Maximus the Elder of Nicæa, Prefect of Egypt. In this year, Diogenes, the Secretary of the Emperor, entered with the design of seizing the Bishop. But he, too, having raged in vain, went away quietly.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p72"></a>XXVIII. (355–6.) In this year, Easter-day was on xii Pharmuthi; xvii Moon; vii Id. Ap.; Epact iv; Gods, i; Indict. xiv, Coss. Constantius Aug. VIII, Julianus Cæsar I; the same governor Maximus the <a name="page_505"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 505</font></a> <a name="xxv.iii.ii-Page_505"></a>Elder of Nicæa, Præfect of Egypt, who was succeeded by Cataphronius of Byblus. In this year, Syrianus Dux, having excited a tumult in the Church on the thirteenth of Mechir, on the fourteenth <a name="fr_3863"></a><a href="#fn_3863"><font size="1">3864</font></a>
  at night entered Theonas with his soldiers; but he was unable to capture [Athanasius], for he escaped in a miraculous manner.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p74"></a>XXIX (356–7.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxvii Phamenoth; xvii Moon; x Kal. Ap., Epact xv; Gods, ii; Indict. xv; Coss. Constantius Aug. IX, Julianus Cæsar II; the same governor Cataphronius, of Byblus, Præfect of Egypt, to whom succeeded Parnassius. Then Georgius entered on the thirtieth of Mechir, and acted with excessive violence. But Athanasius, the Bishop, had fled, and was sought for in the city with much oppression, many being in danger on this account. Therefore no Festal Letter was written <a name="fr_3864"></a><a href="#fn_3864"><font size="1">3865</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p76"></a>XXX. (357–8.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvii Pharmuthi; Prid. Id. Ap.; xvii Moon; Epact xxvi; Gods, iii; Indict. i; Coss. Tatianus, Cerealis; the governor Parius of Corinth, Præfect of Egypt. Athanasius, the Bishop, lay concealed in the city of Alexandria. But Georgius left on the fifth of Paophi <a name="fr_3865"></a><a href="#fn_3865"><font size="1">3866</font></a>
  being driven away by the multitude. On this account, neither this year was the Pope able to send a Festal Letter.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p78"></a>XXXI. (358–9.) In this year, Easter-day was on ix <a name="fr_3866"></a><a href="#fn_3866"><font size="1">3867</font></a>
  Pharmuthi; Prid. Non. Ap.; xx Moon; Epact vii; Gods, iv; Indict. ii; Coss. Eusebius, Hypatius; the same governor Parius, who was succeeded by Italicianus of Italy for three months; after him Faustinus, of Chalcedon. Neither this year did the Pope write [any Letter].</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p80"></a>XXXII. (359–60.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxviii Pharmuthi; ix Kal. Mai; xxi Moon; Epact xviii; Gods, vi; Indict. iii; Coss. Constantius Aug. X, Julianus Cæsar III; the governor Faustinus, of Chalcedon, Præfect of Egypt. This Præfect and Artemius Dux, having entered a private house and a small cell, in search of Athanasius the Bishop, bitterly tortured Eudæmonis, a perpetual virgin. On this account no [Letter] was written this year.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p81"></a>XXXIII. (360–1.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiii Pharmuthi, vi Id. Ap.; xvii Moon; Epact xxix; Gods, vii; Indict. iv; Coss. Taurus, Florentius; the same governor Faustinus <a name="fr_3867"></a><a href="#fn_3867"><font size="1">3868</font></a>
 , Præfect of Egypt, who was succeeded by Gerontius the Armenian. He was unable to send [a Letter]. In this year, Constantius died <a name="fr_3868"></a><a href="#fn_3868"><font size="1">3869</font></a>
 , and Julianus holding the empire alone, there was a cessation of the persecution against the Orthodox. For commands were issued everywhere from the emperor Julianus, that the Orthodox ecclesiastics who had been persecuted in the time of Constantius should be let alone.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p84"></a>XXXIV. (361–2.) In this year, Easter-day was on v <a name="fr_3869"></a><a href="#fn_3869"><font size="1">3870</font></a>
  Pharmuthi; Prid. Kal. Ap.; xxv Moon; Epact x; Gods, i; Indict. v; Coss. Mamertinus, Nevitta; the same governor Gerontius, who was succeeded by Olympus of Tarsus. In this year, in Mechir, Athanasius the Bishop returned to the Church, after his flight, by the command of Julianus Augustus, who pardoned all the Bishops and Clergy in exile, as was before said. This year, then, he wrote [a Letter].</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p86"></a>XXXV. (362–3.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxv Pharmuthi; xii Kal. Mai; xx Moon; Epact xxi; Gods, ii; Indict. vi; Coss. Julianus Augustus IV, Sallustius; the same governor Olympus, Præfect of Egypt. Pythiodorus Trico of Thebes, a Philosopher, brought a decree of Julianus on the twenty-seventh of Paophi, and set it in action against the Bishop first, and uttered many threats. So he [Athan.] left the city at once, and went up to the Thebais. And when after eight months Julianus died, and his death was announced, Athanasius returned secretly by night to Alexandria.

  at the Eastern Hierapolis, and met the emperor Jovian, by whom he was dismissed with honour. He sent this festal Letter to all the country, while being driven by persecution from Memphis to the Thebais, and it was delivered as usual.</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.ii-p88"></a>XXXVI. (363–4). In this year, Easter-day was on ix Pharmuthi; Prid. Non. Ap.; xvi Moon; Epact iii; Gods, iv; Indict. vii; Coss.
