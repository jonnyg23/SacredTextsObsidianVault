 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.i-p49"></a>[Antonys answers to a philosopher, and to Didymus, are given by Socrates IV. 23, 25: the following is from Hanmers translation of Socr. I. 21: “The same time lived Antony the monk in the deserts of Ægypt. But inasmuch as Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, hath lately set forth in a several volume, intituled of his life, his manners and converasiton, how openly he buckled with divils, how he over-reached their slights and subtle combats, and wrought many marvellous and strange miracles, I think it superfluous on my part to intreat thereof.]</p>
