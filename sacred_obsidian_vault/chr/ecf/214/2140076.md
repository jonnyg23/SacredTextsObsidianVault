 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xv-p7"></a>If the purchaser of ecclesiastical properties has realized more by the temporary revenue of such properties than the price of the purchase, the Synod thinks there is no occasion to restore him this price, as he has already received a sufficient indemnity from the revenue, and as, according to the rules then in force, <i>interest</i> drawn from the purchase money was not permitted.  Besides, the purchaser had done wrong in buying ecclesiastical property during the vacancy of a see (<i>sede vacante</i>).  Beveridge and Routh have shown that in the text <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xv-p7.1"></a>ἀνακαλεῖσθαι</span> and <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xv-p7.2"></a>πρόσοδον</span> must be read. <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">117</font></a>
