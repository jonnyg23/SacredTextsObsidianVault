 <p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lv-p2"></a>That a strange cleric is under no circumstances to be received by another.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lv-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lv-p3.1"></a>Epigonius</span>, the bishop, said:  This has been decreed in many councils, also just now it has been confirmed by your prudence, most blessed brethren, that no bishop should receive a strange cleric into his diocese without the consent of the bishop to whose jurisdiction the cleric belongs.  But I say that Julian, who is ungrateful for the layouts bestowed upon him by God through my littleness, is so rash and audacious, that a certain man who was baptized by me, when he was a most needy boy, commended to me by the same, and when for many years he had been fed and reared by me, it is certain that this one, as I have said, was baptized in my church, by my own unworthy hands; this same man began to exercise the office of reader in the Mappalien diocese, and read there for nearly two years, with a most incomprehensible contempt of my littleness, the aforenamed Julian took this man, whom he declared to be a citizen of his own city Vazarita, and without consulting me ordained him deacon.  If, most blessed brethren, that is permissible, let it be declared to us; but if not, let such an impudent one be restrained that he may in no way mix himself in someones communion.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lv-p4"></a>Numidius, the bishop, said:  If, as it seems, Julian did this without your worthiness being asked for his consent, nor even consulted, we all judge that this was done iniquitously and unworthily.  Wherefore unless Julian shall correct his error, and shall return the cleric to your people with proper satisfaction, since what he did was contrary to the decrees of the council, let him be condemned and separated from us on account of his contumacy.  Epigonius, the bishop, said:  Our father in age, and most ancient by his promotion, that laudable man, our brother and colleague Victor wishes that this petition should be made general to all.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lv-p7"></a>Since Julian has ordained a reader of Epigoniuss to the diaconate, unless he shall shew authority received from him to do so, he shall increase the penalty of his contumacy.</p>
