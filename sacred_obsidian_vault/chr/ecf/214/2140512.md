 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p3.1"></a>At</span> the suggestion moreover of our brother Olympius, <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">401</font></a>
  we are pleased to decree this also:  That if a bishop suffer violence and is unjustly cast out either on account of his discipline or for his confession of [the faith of] the Catholic Church or for his defence of the truth, and, fleeing from danger, although innocent and devout [or, innocent and being under charge of high treason], comes to another city, let him not be forbidden to stay there until he is restored or until deliverance can be found from the violence and injustice that have been done him.  For it would be harsh indeed and most oppressive that one who has suffered unjust expulsion should not be harboured by us; as such a man ought to be received with the greatest consideration and cordiality.*</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p5"></a>All said:  This also is our pleasure.</p> 
 <p class="c31"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p6"></a>(<i>Latin</i>.)</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p7"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p7.1"></a>At</span> the suggestion of our brother Olympius, we are pleased to decree this also:  That if any suffer violence and is unjustly cast out on account of his discipline and his Catholic confession or for his defence of the truth, and, fleeing from dangers, although innocent and devout, comes to another city, let him not be forbidden to stay there until he can return or his wrong has been redressed.  For it is harsh and unfeeling that he who is suffering persecution should not be received; indeed, great cordiality and abundant consideration should be shown him.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p8"></a>All the synod said:  All that has been decreed the Catholic Church spread abroad throughout all the world will preserve and maintain.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p9"></a>And all the bishops of the various provinces who had assembled subscribed thus:</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p10"></a>I, N., bishop of the city of N. and the province of N., so believe as above is written.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p13"></a>If a bishop goes into another province after he has been unjustly expelled from his own, he should be received, until he has been delivered from his injury.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p14"></a>This is Canon XXI. of the Latin and the last.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p16"></a>St. Gregory seems to have had this canon in mind when he wrote to the bishops of Illyria (Lib. III., <i>Epist</i>. xliij.), who had been cast out by the hostility of the barbarians.</p>
