 <p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xxiii-p4"></a>We should know that not every book which is called Scripture is to be received as a safe guide.  For some are tolerably sound and others are more than doubtful.  Therefore the books which the inspiration of God hath given I will enumerate.  [Then follows a list of the proto-canonical books of the Old Testament, Esther alone being omitted.  All the deutero-canonical books are omitted.  He then continues] to these some add Esther.  I must now show what are the books of the New Testament.  [Then follow all the books of the New Testament except the Revelation.  He continues,] But some add to these the Revelation of John, but by far the majority say that it is spurious.  This is the most true canon of the divinely given Scriptures.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xxiii-p6"></a>We have thus four [five if we accept the Laodicean list as genuine,] different canons of Holy Scripture, all having the approval of the Council in Trullo and of the Seventh Ecumenical.  From this there seems but one conclusion possible, viz.:  that the approval given was not specific but general.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="xvii.xxiii-p3"></a> That is the canon of Holy Scripture.  I have substituted my own Epitome, in the room of Johnsons, translating the original as it is found in Beveridges <i>Synodicon</i>, Tom. II., p. 179.  It is also in Aristenuss <i>Epitome</i>.  Balsamon has no scholion on this passage.</p>
