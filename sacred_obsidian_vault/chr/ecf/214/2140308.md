 <p class="c31"><a name="xi.viii-p3"></a>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. IV., col. 368.)</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xi.viii-p4"></a>After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out:  This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles.  So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe.  Anathema to him who does not thus believe.  Peter has spoken thus through Leo.  So taught the Apostles.  Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril.  Everlasting be the memory of Cyril.  Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe.  This is the true faith.  Those of us who are orthodox thus believe.  This is the faith of the fathers.  Why were not these things read at Ephesus [i.e. at the heretical synod held there]?  These are the things Dioscorus hid away.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xi.viii-p5"></a>[<i>Some explanations were asked by the Illyrian bishops and the answers were found satisfactory, but yet a delay of a few days was asked for, and some bishops petitioned for a general pardon of all who had been kept out.  This proposition made great confusion, in the midst of which the session was dissolved by the judges</i>.  (Col. 371<a name="xi.viii-p5.1"></a>.)]</p>
